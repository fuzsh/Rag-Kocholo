        "text": "The MCU has featured an endless series of villains being defeated, but perhaps it has been laid low by the most unexpected villain of all – the hardcore of American cinemagoers.\n\nIn April 2021 I wrote about being knocked sideways by my introduction to the concept of the Power Law. For instance in retail 80% of the complaints come from 20% of the customers, and this kind of weird statistic holds true for many various fields of human behaviour. But it really seems to strike with a vengeance at the North American Box Office. According to a 2019 survey just 11% of American cinemagoers accounted for 47% of all the cinema tickets sold. Which is staggering, until you reflect. I saw The Dark Knight five times in the cinema. I was one of those ideal marks for repeat viewing. So if I go from buying 7 tickets for the LOTR trilogy to 0 tickets for the Hobbit trilogy, as I did, then it’s very bad for business. And if a studio truly alienates this fraction of the audience, it’s goodnight Vienna. It blows my mind that a studio could aim at 90% of the population, and lose basically 50% of the box office by doing so.\n\nThe MPA survey was based on 2019, the all-conquering year for the MCU with Avengers: Endgame. And it was the end of an era in more ways than just the exit of several of the MCU’s original characters. That was the last year before Covid changed things, forever. Per 2019’s analysis 24% of the combined USA/Canada population does not go to movies, at all. The remaining 76% of the population averages 4.6 tickets per year. Of that 76% that go to the movies, occasional moviegoers, a bloc of 54% who go less than once a month, buy 51% of the tickets. The 11% of infrequent moviegoers who go once a year buy 2% of tickets. But the 11% of frequent moviegoers, who go at least once a month, buy 47% of the tickets. When you see those two represented on pie charts side by side, as in the MPA report, you realise the frequent moviegoers are carrying the load for the 24% refuseniks as well as the uncommitted 9% of the frequent moviegoers.\n\nThat’s a lot of weight to carry…. Cinema is no longer as important as it once was. The archetypal Saturday night movie experience memorably recounted by Gus Van Sant on the Bret Easton Ellis Podcast, where the entire high school rocked up to the cinema because that’s what you did on Saturday night before anything else you might get up to, is long vanished. No amount of hype will bring that world back, just like no amount of fraud can hide the fact you can’t buy a house for the same price your parents did because of inflation, and that inflation didn’t magically not affect the price of cinema tickets too. As the Atlantic put it the other year, Americans used to go to the movies like they went to church, now they go to the movies like they go to the doctor. Infrequently, and unwillingly. And that’s where I think something may have changed that I hadn’t considered before. Enter Keynes and the Multiplier Effect. Has the MCU buckled under contact with … The Multiplier?\n\nEarly 2016 found everyone being whacked over the head with The Force Awakens as the most popular film in the history of popularity and film. Andrew O’Hehir of Salon.com weighed into the fray with irrepressible sarcasm and statistics:\n\nIf you squint and fudge in just the right light, The Force Awakens is now sorta-kinda the biggest hit in United States history, and has maybe a 50/50 shot of catching Avatar for the No. 1 global spot.\n\nActually, a further word on Disney’s loud crowing this week about SW: TFA having reached the status of Biggest Movie Ever. That word would be “oh no, you don’t.” If you adjust for inflation — which is, y’know, how actual economic comparisons are done — it’s not even close. According to Box Office Mojo’s seemingly reasonable calculations, The Force Awakens is now roughly the No. 21 movie of all time, well below such titles as The Lion King, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and The Exorcist. It will certainly climb a fair bit higher, but I’m not convinced it will earn the extra $300 million required to catch Doctor Zhivago at No. 8. And I would bet Donald Trump’s bottom dollar that it won’t get anywhere near the all-time champ, Gone With the Wind, which made almost $200 million in 1939 dollars, in a nation with less than half our current population where the typical movie ticket cost less than a quarter.\n\nThe new Star Wars is a big movie, for sure. But it’s not quite as ginormous and culture-dominating and universally beloved as Disney wants us to think it is. The bigness of TFA, or at least the idea of its bigness, is a central element of the Mouse House strategy to spin Star Wars into a marketing, merchandising and entertainment empire.\n\nI propose that the importance of this idea of bigness was dependent on frequent moviegoers, hereinafter to be referred to as The 11%. Who are these people? Who knows? But probably they are the kind of people who go to a Star Wars movie or an MCU movie or a Jurassic World movie two times over opening weekend. And this inflates the opening weekend box office. Creating the impression that everybody is going to see Movie X. Whereas in fact maybe only 11 people out of a random sample of 100 have gone to Movie X, they’ve just gone to it an unhealthy amount of times. But more likely a lot of people did go. But because The 11% went repeatedly, it seriously warped the perception of the movie’s bigness. This dragged out the recalcitrant 2% of infrequent moviegoers to buy tickets, and it made the occasional moviegoer decide to check this particular movie out – as happened in 2015 with The Force Awakens and Jurassic World. The 11% make movies big. Or they used to\n\nThe fall of Star Wars might be a case in point here. There can be little doubt that the 11% were out in force in December 2015. But when they were served The Force Regurgitated it might have given them pause. There was already a tremendous amount of bad faith going on. Disney bought Star Wars and then unceremoniously junked the entire Expanded Universe. Revered novels, beloved comic books. Thirty years of fan investment. Gone. And then came The Last Jedi. I still haven’t seen it. Out of complete lack of interest. I know many people disagree mightily with its choices regarding Luke Skywalker. Not least because Mark Hamill let us all know his Voltairean approach: I disagree with what you are writing for my character, sir, but I am contractually obliged to act it out. I have previously written here that its DVD release seemed to be accompanied by American websites lambasting upset fans with a ‘party line’. JJ Abrams, apparently oblivious to the lesson of 2016’s Ghostbusters, (don’t piss all over the customer until after you’ve got their money) then endorsed the line: “Their problem isn’t Star Wars, their problem is being threatened. Star Wars is a big galaxy, and you can sort of find almost anything you want to in Star Wars. If you are someone who feels threatened by women and needs to lash out against them, you can probably find an enemy in Star Wars”. Solo then sank without trace at the box office. Almost as if a very small number of personally insulted people had crossed their arms and said Nope. And then The Rise of Skywalker also bombed. To be clear, these films still made a lot of money. But they cost an awful lot… And the Star Wars numbers were trending downwards.\n\nThe Rise of Skywalker made 1.077 billion, and 515.2 million of that came from North America. The Force Awakens made 2.066 billion, and 936.6 million of that came from North America. Those are numbers going defiantly in the wrong direction, and without adjusting for four years of inflation. They tell the same story of decline as afflicted the Hobbit trilogy, where each movie made less, whereas with the Lord of the Rings each movie made more. At the same time in 2019 Avengers: Endgame made 2.799 billion, and 858.3 million came from North America. The 11% were still there, they were just being selective. And being selective means that in 2019 Captain Marvel, sold as a tee-up for Avengers: Endgame, could make 426.8 million in North America, while its sequel The Marvels limped in at 84.5 million in North America. Again, almost as if a very small number of personally insulted people had crossed their arms and said Nope. And then went to Oppenheimer, in Imax, twice.\n\nMemorial Day 2024, a weekend that will live in box office infamy, when Furiosa was suddenly and unexpectedly attacked by The Garfield Movie. As the Atlantic noted, “excepting 2020, when the pandemic kept theaters closed, these numbers added up to the lowest Memorial Day domestic box office in nearly three decades”. Ruh-Roh, to quote another well belov’d cartoon animal. Barbie and Oppenheimer were movies that dragged out the infrequent cinemagoer and the occasional cinemagoer, and The 11% was probably more invested in the latter than the former. (I am making some assumptions about the make-up of The 11%, prove me wrong) But that’s a 2015 duopoly surrounded by the fiery wrecks of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, The Flash, Blue Beetle, Shazam!: Fury of the Gods, and The Marvels. I’ve previously suggested James Gunn’s unwise canning of the DCEU may have destroyed all the films yet to be released because The 11% did not take kindly to his decisions: drop Henry Cavill and Gal Gadot, keep Jennifer Holland (who just happens to be his wife).\n\nBut the fall of the DCEU was nothing like the collapse from Olympus of the MCU. Since Avengers: Endgame, the MCU has developed not necessarily to Disney’s advantage. Indeed the Deadpool & Wolverine trailer is now permitted to joke about how dire the situation has become. And it has possibly structural implications for Hollywood writ large. “Currently, the benchmark for a successful summer movie season is $4 billion,” writes Shirley Li in the Atlantic, “and summer ticket sales are already 22 percent behind 2023 and 41 percent behind 2019.” Should Hollywood be accepting a changed reality? That between 2019 and 2024 something has changed, so that now they only have 60% of their market left? Taking out a billion dollar Marvel movie or two definitely accounts for that missing chunk. The problem is, in the absence of another detailed MPA survey, knowing who has gone, and why. There can’t be any doubt that Covid completely ruptured the movie-going habit. I readily acknowledge that in myself, and consider it simply changed priorities. But is there something else?\n\nI checked out of the MCU a long, long time ago, and for years after was frustrated at how the media, especially in America, fawned over it. Almost as if they were so hopelessly dependent on its box-office lustre for clicks that they were afraid to say anything less than laudatory, in case it might cause Disney to sever their access. So when it became acceptable for Disney to attack its fans, cf JJ Abrams, they pitched in with gusto. And then, after the box-office bubble of the MCU had burst, they started writing about how the MCU was actually flailing about, and how a lot of it, post-2019, had not been very good. Which is what the fans had been saying, but they’d been too busy attacking them for being awful people to judge whether they were making awful arguments or not. Were these movies riddled with embarrassingly awful and frankly unnecessary CGI? Yes. Were they becoming borderline incomprehensible without a subscription to Disney+ to keep up with a firehose of subpar content? Yes.\n\nWas there a concerted effort to, cf Kathleen Kennedy, pivot the MCU away from a male audience towards a female audience? Um, yes… And it was being done with all the skill and writing vim that had accompanied the successful reorientation of Star Wars. (Sigh) But here’s the rub. The audience for The Marvels was more male than female. Four years after the girlbosses assemble scene in Avengers: Endgame. The female audience that was being targeted was patently non-existent. It would turn up for Barbie, repeatedly, and dressed in pink. But it simply would not show up for any of what had become cruelly dubbed The M-She-U. But a failure to attract a new audience isn’t a catastrophe so long as you haven’t torched your existing audience in the attempt. Um. Yeah, about that. JJ Abrams had some strange ideas about why men didn’t respond well to his creation Rey. And he attacked them, and they left. The MCU introduced a number of characters best described as insufferable, and then savaged anyone finding them insufferable.\n\nAnd now there is a big old crater at the North American box-office where the MCU’s takings used to be located. The 11% held enormous power. 47% of the box-office was in their hands. And if they chose to cross their arms, I argue, the absence of their multiplier effect could take out a damned good chunk of the remaining 53% of the box-office a studio might be expecting to get. Know your audience. I remember reading a statistical study using Facebook data on interests and likes where it was convincingly shown, before its release, that Sony had gravely miscalculated in thinking there was any overlap between women going to Bridesmaids and women interested in going to Wiig and McCarthy in Feig’s Ghostbusters. It would be like assuming people who went to Drive would go to Barbie too, because Ryan Gosling was in both. Can Hollywood entice back The 11%? Or are they just done with movie-going forever, and the reason that the streaming of anime in North America has gone thru the roof recently?\n\nIf you tell people that a film wasn’t made for them, loudly, bitterly, and in public, well, they might just take you at your word.\n\nAs the title suggests, so forth.\n\nSome people are never happy\n\nI remember vividly some people moaning about Inception, claiming that because it didn’t have lashings of nudity and wildly explicit sex it was totally invalid as an exploration of dreams. The film that should have made oodles of money rather than Inception, in the eyes of these latter-day Freudians, was Vanishing Waves a couple of years later, which had lashings of nudity and wildly explicit sex. But are all dreams about running naked in sand dunes at night, chasing someone else who’s naked, and sometimes being chased by them, and never quite catching up or being caught up to? Or are all dreams about meeting someone for the first time and having naked sex in an empty sun-drenched room? Surely there are other kinds of dreams… And Christopher Nolan has a perfect right to explore those other kinds of dreams. Fast forward to this summer, Nolan surprises everyone with an R rating for Oppenheimer. His first since Insomnia in 2002. The reason? Lashings of nudity and wildly explicit sex, particularly striking in his depiction of Oppenheimer’s reveries. And these people … moan about him not showing The Bomb dropping on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And also moan about him not devoting a subplot to the clearance of Native Americans from the Los Alamos site. You cannot win. If complaining is both a valid method and a criteria for criticism then, pffft. Somebody will always have something to complain about, regarding anything and everything. This is why Leonard Bernstein’s children decided to tell these people to STFU about how “problematic” it was for Bradley Cooper to don a prosthetic nose to play him in Maestro. Much like Nicole Kidman did to Oscar-winning effect in The Hours when playing Virginia Woolf. Bernstein’s children were happy for Cooper to don the nose and felt “any strident complaints around this issue” were perhaps “disingenuous attempts to bring a successful person down a notch — a practice we observed all too often perpetrated on our own father.” Given that this chorus of complaining had started months before anybody had even seen the film it was a very necessary and deserved strike, and seems to have had the desired effect. People are curious to see what writer/director/star Bradley Cooper is going to do with the life of an American titan. As they should be. And instead of obsessing over Nolan’s problematic treatment of whatever, perhaps the moaners should appreciate what he actually did – the father of The Bomb hears the news of Hiroshima on the radio like everyone else, because once the science is done, he is not needed by the powers that be anymore, and his brainchild is taken away.\n\nWarners, get your Gunn\n\nThis is the way the Snyderverse ends, not with a bang but a whimper. Why did The Flash, Blue Beetle and (it looks likely) Aquaman 2 all bomb? There are various reasons, (comically bad CGI, notorious actors, calling Batman a fascist…) but I’m fairly sure James Gunn publicly canning the entire DCEU before any of these films had even been released sure helped. Was he, in his new role as guardian of the DC flame for Warner Bros, seriously unaware of the doom loop noted on Netflix whereby cancelling shows without a resolution makes people hesitant to commit to new shows? People afraid to commit to new shows lest they also go nowhere leads to poor ratings because of this hesitancy which leads to those shows then being cancelled, proving the hesitaters right, so that more people join their ranks next time, and so on and so on in an unstoppable Kessler syndrome. Again, it is worth noting the power law that applies to American cinema. You could lose 47% of your box office takings by alienating just 11% of cinemagoers. And those cinemagoers are probably the ones who are extremely online; hyper aware that Gunn had cancelled Wonder Woman 3 with Gal Gadot, and prevented Henry Cavill returning as Superman, while simultaneously committing to his wife Jennifer Holland’s much loved (cough) Harcourt character continuing on into the new DCU. Alienate this group at your peril…\n\nLast Orders in Soho\n\nIt now seems likely that Last Night in Soho was not just the swansong of the late Diana Rigg but also the final film of her fellow 1960s icon Terence Stamp. Which is a terrible disappointment, because director Edgar Wright shamefully wasted both of their talents on his misguided time-travel horror. I was excited to see this movie before Covid scuppered its September 2020 release, but when I finally caught up with it on Netflix in the company of The Engineer, a fellow devotee of The Avengers, it was a huge let down. For all the world it seemed like Wright had gone down the same rabbit hole as Tarantino had just before him when curating movies for Sony Movies Classics – assuming everyone has seen as many obscure 1960s films as he has. Wright, from interviews, seems to believe he was interrogating the attitudes of 1960s films that were beloved and problematic. Actually he’s preaching about God knows what in films that nobody’s seen in sixty years, and then wondering why we aren’t responding to his homily in the way he expected. The obscurantist imperative strikes again. I mean what is the point of making a film in 2020 to castigate the 1960s? Won’t someone else make a film in 2080 to castigate the 2020s? For heaven’s sake even now there is plenty to castigate in Wright’s muddled movie. The level of unapologetic misandry on display takes the breath away. To complain about prostitution dehumanising women, Wright, without irony, puts a blurred facemask on all of the clients to dehumanise them. Before blithely endorsing the villain’s justification for murdering them all and hiding their bodies for sixty years, because they deserved it for paying a prostitute for sex. Uh, okay. A late revelation about a character not being evil after all is undermined by him being nicknamed ‘Handsy’, so he cannot be redeemed. And the barman who gave him that nickname, instead of confronting him over his behaviour, is also not good because he is therefore complicit in the power structures of (cough) “toxic masculinity”. There is only one male character in the entire movie who is portrayed at all positively, and he is a manic pixie dream boy so painfully lacking in any level of believability that he barely makes it to being one-dimensional. With all this intrusive lecturing and terrible writing (and thinking) it is little surprise that, almost from the off, I noticed that this film was entirely lacking in the directorial vim one expects from Edgar Wright. My jaw dropped when I saw how he depicted Thomasin McKenzie arriving in London. Tony Zhou once made an entire video essay about how Wright was so much more visually interesting than the boring movie cliches of establishing that we are arriving in a new location. He used to be…\n\nJupiter Ascending\n\nThe Wachowskis return, oh joy, in 3-D, more joy, with a tale of a young woman (Mila Kunis) who discovers that she shares the same DNA as the Queen of the Universe, and goes on the run with a genetically engineered former soldier (Channing Tatum), oh, and he’s part wolf… The unloveable Eddie Redmayne is the villain, but the extremely loveable Tuppence Middleton is also in the cast, and, oddly, there’s a cameo from Terry Gilliam, whose work is said to be an influence on the movie. Alongside Star Wars, Greek mythology, and the comic-book Saga it seems…\n\nFifty Shades of Grey\n\nJamie Dornan is Christian Grey, Dakota Johnson is Bella Swan Anastasia Steele, Universal are terrible gamblers. Take one novel: which is 100pp of hilariously obvious Twilight homage leading to pornography for hundreds more and an unsatisfactory ending; a sensation because of the ability to secretly read it. Now hire art-house director Sam Taylor-Johnson to make an R-rated film focused on the romance, after 5 Twilight movies of said romance shtick; and force people to say out loud what film they’re seeing, or at least be seen going to it. Sit back, and watch this gamble fail.\n\nBlackhat\n\nMichael Mann returns with his first film since 2009’s uninspired Public Enemies. Chris Hemsworth, now officially a god in Iceland again, plays a hacker who gets a free pass from jail to help Viola Davis’ FBI agent liaise with her Chinese counterpart (pop star Wang Leehom) following a devastating cyber-attack in China which led to a nuclear incident. Hemsworth is distracted in his mission by Lust, Caution’s Chen Lien, and, if you’ve read the vituperative reviews, an appalling script. Mann’s been on a losing streak for a while, and his hi-def video camera infatuation only doubles down on that.\n\nIn the Heart of the Sea\n\nMarch sees director Ron Howard take on Moby Dick. Or rather, tell the true story that inspired Moby Dick, rather than try and out-do John Huston. Chris Hemsworth, Cillian Murphy, Ben Whishaw, and Brendan Gleeson are among the hapless crew of the whaling ship Essex out of New England that runs afoul of a curiously vindictive sperm whale in 1820. Martin Sheen starred in a rather good BBC version of this disaster its grisly aftermath at Christmas 2013. Who knows if Howard will match that, but he’ll definitely throw more CGI at the screen.\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron\n\nJoss Whedon takes off the Zak Penn training wheels and scripts this sequel to 2012’s hit solo. James Spader voices the titular evil AI, unleashed by Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man when fiddling about in Samuel L Jackson’s Pandora’s Box of Shield secrets. The great Elizabeth Olsen is Scarlet Witch, and Aaron Johnson is Quicksilver, but I find it hard to work up any enthusiasm for another ticked box on the Marvel business plan. Why? CGI and Marvel empire-building fatigue, a lack of interest in most of the characters, and great weariness with Whedon’s predictable subversion.\n\nLost River\n\nWhat is the difference between a homage and le rip-off? The French should know and they loudly booed Ryan Gosling’s directorial debut as little more than Nicolas Winding Refn and David Lynch meeting up for a whimsical night out. Gosling also wrote this tale of a boy who finds a town under the sea down a river, and has to be rescued by his mother. Matt Smith, Christina Hendricks, Saoirse Ronan, Eva Mendes, and Ben Mendelsohn are the actors roped in by Gosling to flesh out his magical realist vision of a hidden beauty lurking underneath decrepit Detroit.\n\nFar From the Madding Crowd\n\nBathsheba (Carey Mulligan), a wilful, flirtatious young woman unexpectedly inherits a large farm and becomes romantically involved with three widely divergent men: rich landowner William Boldwood (Michael Sheen), dashing Sgt. Troy (Tom Sturridge), and poor farmer Gabriel Oak (Matthias Schoenaerts). John Schlesinger’s 1967 film of Hardy’s classic novel is a formidable predecessor for this May release. This version from director Thomas Vinterberg (Festen, The Hunt), was co-scripted with David Nicholls of One Day fame; another man whose tendencies are not exactly of a sunny disposition. Can the promising young cast overcome Vinterberg’s most miserabilist tendencies?\n\nTomorrowland\n\nWell this is a curio… Brad Bird directs George Clooney and Secret Circle star Britt Robertson in a script he co-wrote with Damon LOST Lindelof about a genius inventor and a parallel universe, or something. Nobody really seems to know what it’s about. But then given Lindelof’s resume even after we’ve watched it we probably won’t know what it’s about. Bird proved extremely capable with live-action in Mission: Impossible 4, but explicitly viewed the talky scenes as mere connective tissue between well-executed set-pieces; pairing him with ‘all questions, no answers’ man seems like a recipe for more puzzled head-scratching.\n\nAnt-Man\n\nAnt-Man was in 2015: Hopes until director and co-writer Edgar Wright walked because Marvel shafted him after years of development. I was highly interested in seeing Paul Rudd’s burglar become a miniature super-hero who’s simpatico with ants after encountering mad scientist Michael Douglas and his hot daughter Evangeline Lilly; when it was from the madman who made Scott Pilgrim Vs the World. When this deservedly nonsensical take on a preposterous property is being helmed by Peyton Reed; whose only four features are Bring It On, Down With Love, The Break-Up, and Yes Man; my interest levels drop to zero.\n\nTerminator: Genisys\n\nQuietly brushing 2009’s Terminator: Salvation into the dustbin of history in July is this script by Laeta Kalogridis (Pathfinder, Night Watch) and Patrick Lussier (Drive Angry). Game of Thrones’ Alan Taylor directs, which presumably explains Emilia Clarke’s baffling casting as Jason Clarke’s mother. That’s going to take some quality Sarah Connor/John Connor timeline shuffling. And this is all about timelines. Arnie returns! Byung-Hun Lee is a T-1000! Courtney B Vance is Miles Dyson! YAY!!!!! Jai Courtney is Kyle Reese … BOOOOOO!!!!!!! Did we learn nothing from McG’s fiasco? We do not need another muscle-bound actor with zip charisma.\n\nFantastic Four\n\nAugust sees Josh Trank shoulder the unenviable task of rebooting the Fantastic Four after two amiable but forgettable movies. Trank impressed mightily with the disturbing found-footage super-yarn Chronicle, and scripted this effort with X-scribe Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater (The Lazarus Effect). The cast is interesting; Miles Teller as Reed Richards, Kate Mara as Sue Storm, Michael B Jordan as Johnny Storm, Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm, and Toby Kebbel as Dr Doom; but this has had a troubled production, and carries an albatross around its neck as it must bore us senseless with another bloody origin story.\n\nThe Man from UNCLE\n\nAugust sees CIA agent Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and KGB man Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) on a mission to infiltrate a mysterious criminal organization during the height of the cold war. Steven Soderbergh nearly made this with George Clooney from a Scott Z Burns script. Instead we get Guy Ritchie and Sherlock Holmes scribe Lionel Wigram. Sigh. Hugh Grant plays Waverley, while the very talented female leads Alicia (Omnipresent) Vikander and Elizabeth Debicki will highlight the lack of suavity and comic timing of the male leads; particularly troublesome given the show was dry tongue-in-cheek super-spy nonsense.\n\nBlack Mass\n\nPoor old Johnny Depp is having something of an existential crisis at the moment. People moan and complain when he does his quirky thing (Mortdecai). But when he doesn’t do his quirky thing people moan and complain that he’s dull (Transcendence). September sees him team up with Benedict Cumberbatch and Joel Edgerton for Scott Cooper’s 1980s period thriller about the FBI’s real-life alliance with Boston crime boss Whitey Bulger, exploring how the bureau’s original good intention of running an informant was derailed by Bulger’s clever connivance, ending up as a sort of state-sanctioned take-over of the criminal underworld.\n\nThe Martian\n\nRidley Scott just can’t stop making movies lately, but he’s having a considerably harder time making good movies. November sees the release of The Martian starring Matt Damon as an astronaut stranded on Mars after being presumed dead in a ferocious storm. The supporting cast includes Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Michael Pena, Sebastian Shaw, Kate Mara, and the regrettably inevitable Jessica Chastain. Damon must try to send an SOS forcing NASA to figure out how on earth to go back and rescue him. Drew Goddard wrote the script. There’s the reason this might work.\n\nThe Hateful Eight\n\nNovember sees the return of Quentin Tarantino. The writer/director who never grew up follows his rambling gore-fest Django Unchained with another Western. But this one is shot in Ultra Panavision 70, despite being set indoors, and has more existential aspirations. Yeah… Samuel L Jackson, Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, Walton Goggins, and Zoe Bell return to the fold for this tale of bounty hunters holed up during a blizzard, while newcomers to Quentinland include Bruce Dern, Demian Bichir, and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Nobody’s told Tarantino to stop indulging himself in years so expect endless speechifying and outrageous violence.\n\nNoah\n\nArriving in March is Darren Aronofsky’s soggy biblical epic starring Russell Crowe as Noah, and Anthony Hopkins as Noah’s dad, the oldest man imaginable Methuselah. Jennifer Connelly, Emma Watson, and Logan Lerman round out the family, and Ray Winstone is the beastly villain of the piece. Aronofsky doesn’t lack chutzpah, he passed off horror flick Black Swan as a psychological drama in which Natalie Portman did all her own dancing after all, but this will undoubtedly sink without trace in its own CGI flood because it apparently tackles head-on the troublesome references to the Sons of God while somehow making Noah an ecological warrior – which neatly alienates its target audience.\n\n300: Rise of an Empire\n\nThe ‘sequel’ to 300 finally trundles into cinemas 7 years and about three name changes later. Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) urges the Greeks to unite in action against the invading army of Persian ruler Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), while Athenian Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) leads the Hellenic fleet against the Persian fleet (which we’re supposed to accept is) led by the Greek Artemisia (Eva Green). 300 is a fine film, if you regard it, following PG Wodehouse’s dictum, as a sort of musical comedy without the music. Zack Snyder took it deadly seriously… and has co-written this farrago of CGI, macho nonsense, Bush-era patriotic bombast, and deplorable history.\n\nThe Raid 2: Berandal\n\nMarch sees the return of super-cop Rama (Iko Uwais), as, picking up immediately after the events of the first film, he goes undercover in prison to befriend the convict son of a fearsome mob boss, in the hope of uncovering corruption in Jakarta’s police force. 2012’s The Raid was bafflingly over-praised (Gareth Evans’ script could’ve been for a film set in Detroit, and in the machete scene a villain clearly pulled a stroke to avoid disarming Rama), so this bloated sequel, running at nearly an hour longer than its predecessor, is a considerable worry. At least there’ll be some variety with subway fights, and car chases promised.\n\nTranscendence\n\nNolan’s abrasive DP Wally Pfister makes the leap to the big chair in April with this sci-fi suspense thriller. Dr. Caster (Johnny Depp), a leading pioneer in the field of A.I., uploads himself into a computer upon an assassination attempt, soon gaining a thirst for omnipotence. Pfister has enlisted Nolan regulars Morgan Freeman and Cillian Murphy, as well as Paul Bettany, Rebecca Hall, Kate Mara, and the inimitable Clifton Collins Jr, and Jack Paglen’s script was on the Black List; so why is this a fear? Well, remember when Spielberg’s DP tried to be a director? And when was the last time Depp’s acting was bearable and not a quirkfest?\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2\n\nMay 2nd sees the return of the franchise we didn’t need rebooted… Aggravatingly Andrew Garfield as Spidey and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey are far better actors than Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, but the material they were given felt inevitably over-familiar. Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci wrote the sequel, and, after Star Trek ‘2’, their Sleepy Hollow riffs so much on Supernatural it casts doubt on their confidence in their own original ideas, which is a double whammy as far as over-familiarity goes. And there’s too many villains… Electro (Jamie Foxx), Rhino (Paul Giamatti), Harry Osborn/Green Goblin (Dane DeHaan), and Norman Osborn(/Green Goblin too?) (Chris Cooper).\n\nBoyhood\n\nRichard Linklater and Michael Winterbottom as transatlantic parallels gains ground as it transpires they’ve both been pulling the same trick over the last decade. Linklater in Boyhood tells the life of a child (Ellar Salmon) from age six to age 18, following his relationship with his parents (Ethan Hawke, Patricia Arquette) before and after they divorce. Linklater has spent a few weeks every year since 2002 shooting portions of this film, so Salmon grows up and his parents lose their looks. Hawke has described it as “time-lapse photography of a human being”, but is it as good as Michael Chabon’s similar set of New Yorker stories following a boy’s adolescence?\n\nEdge of Tomorrow\n\nTastefully released on the 70th anniversary of D-Day, Tom Cruise plays a soldier, fighting in a world war against invading aliens, who finds himself caught in a time loop of his last day in the battle, though he becomes better skilled along the way. So far, so Groundhog Day meets Source Code. On the plus side it’s directed by Doug Liman (Swingers, Mr & Mrs Smith), who needs to redeem himself for 2008’s Jumper, and it co-stars Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton. On the minus side three different screenwriters are credited (including Christopher McQuarrie and Jez Butterworth), and, given how ‘development’ works, there’s probably as many more uncredited.\n\nJupiter Ascending\n\nThe Wachowskis return in July, oh joy, in 3-D, more joy, with a tale of a young woman (Mila Kunis) who discovers that she shares the same DNA as the Queen of the Universe, and goes on the run with a genetically engineered former soldier (Channing Tatum), oh, and he’s part wolf… The cast includes the unloveable Eddie Redmayne, but also the extremely loveable Tuppence Middleton and the always watchable Sean Bean, and, oddly, a cameo from Terry Gilliam, whose work is said to be an influence on the movie. Although with bits of Star Wars, Greek mythology, and apparently the comic-book Saga floating about, what isn’t an influence?\n\nSin City: A Dame to Kill For\n\nAn unnecessary prequel to 2005’s horrid Sin City follows the story of Dwight McCarthy (Josh Brolin) and his dangerous relationship with the seductive Ava Lord (Eva Green). Shot in 2012 but trapped in post-production hell the CGI-fest will finally be ready for August, we’re promised. Apparently this Frank Miller comic is bloodier than those utilised in the original, which seems barely possible, and original cast Jessica Alba, Bruce Willis and Jaime King return alongside newcomers Juno Temple and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. But who cares? The original’s awesome trailer promised cartoon Chandler fun, and delivered gruesome, witless, sadistic, and misogynistic attempts at noir from Miller’s pen.\n\nGuardians Of The Galaxy\n\nAlso in August, Marvel aim to prove that slapping their logo on anything really will sell tickets as many galaxies away Chris Pratt’s cocky pilot (in no way modelled on Han Solo) falls in with alien assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana), warrior Drax The Destroyer (wrestler Dave Bautista), tree-creature Groot (Vin Diesel’s voice uttering one line), and badass rodent Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper’s voice), going on the run with a powerful object with half the universe on their tail. Writer/director James Gunn (Slither, Super) has form, and reunites with Michael Rooker as well casting Karen Gillan as a villain, but this silly CGI madness sounds beyond even him.\n\nFar From the Madding Crowd\n\nBathsheba Everdene (Carey Mulligan), a wilful, flirtatious young woman unexpectedly inherits a large farm and becomes romantically involved with three widely divergent men: the rich landowner William Boldwood (Michael Sheen), the exciting Sgt. Troy (Tom Sturridge), and the poor farmer Gabriel Oak (Matthias Schoenaerts). John Schlesinger’s 1967 film of Thomas Hardy’s classic novel is a formidable predecessor. This version is from slightly morbid director Thomas Vinterberg (Festen, The Hunt), in his first period outing, and, worryingly, he co-scripted this with David Nicholls of One Day fame; whose own tendencies are not exactly of a sunny disposition. Can the promising young cast overcome Vinterberg’s most miserabilist tendencies?\n\nThe Man from UNCLE\n\nProbably a Christmas blockbuster this reboot of the 1960s show teams CIA agent Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and KGB man Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) on a mission to infiltrate a mysterious criminal organization during the height of the cold war. Steven Soderbergh nearly made this with George Clooney from a Scott Z Burns script. Instead we get Guy Ritchie and his Sherlock Holmes scribe Lionel Wigram. Sigh. Hugh Grant plays Waverley, while the very talented female leads Alicia Vikander and Elizabeth Debicki will highlight the lack of suavity and comic timing of the male leads; particularly troublesome given the show was very dryly done tongue-in-cheek super-spy nonsense.\n\nExodus\n\nAnother year, another Ridley Scott flick among my greatest cinematic fears… Thankfully Fassbender is not implicated in this disaster in waiting. Instead it is Christian Bale who steps into Charlton Heston’s sandals as the leader of the Israelites Moses in this Christmas blockbuster – don’t ask… Joel Edgerton is the Pharoah Rameses who will not let Moses’ people go, Aaron Paul is Joshua, and the ensemble includes Sigourney Weaver, Ben Kingsley, Emun Elliott and John Turturro. But Tower Heist scribes Adam Cooper & Bill Collage are the chief writers, with Steve Zaillian rewriting for awards prestige, and Scott’s on an epic losing streak, so this looks well primed for CGI catastrophe…\n\nI’ve written two pieces about Zack Snyder and one about re-booting the Superman franchise, so here’s my clever ploy to avoid repeating myself by this time writing a blog about Zack Snyder’s re-booting of Superman.\n\nMan of Steel hits cinemas this Friday. The promotional push has come oddly late, here at any rate, with nary a poster or TV spot visible until June 3rd for a movie out June 14th. But Warner Bros has obvious confidence in this project, muttering as they are of their expectations that it will break the $1 billion dollar mark, so it’s obviously a considered choice. But have Zack Snyder’s choices as the rebooting director been equally considered? It’s long been my contention that limits are good, that Tarantino’s CSI: LV special ‘Grave Danger’ is better than Death Proof and Kill Bill: Vols 1 & 2 because he had to creatively respond to artistic limitations rather than engage in his usual self-indulgence. Inglourious Basterds likewise needed to be a hit with some urgency so he had to rein himself in from his original grandiose vision. You could even speculate, as I have, that, given a small budget Richard Kelly’s imagination is focused onto small-scale scenarios which hum with wit and heart, but that given a large budget his vision becomes hopelessly diffuse as it expands over ever more elaborate conspiracies; always involving water, time-travel or aliens. I say this because I think that, unlike the unloved Sucker-Punch which was co-written and directed by Snyder as an R movie and then edited into a PG-13 after the shoot, receiving Goyer’s PG-13 Man of Steel script and bringing his flourishes to bear is the best thing that could happen to him creatively.\n\nSnyder has cast intriguingly and well. Laurence Fishburne has the natural authority you want from a Perry White, Amy Adams has the comic timing and also the abrasiveness to be Lois Lane, and the double-act of Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as the Kents looks very promising. Russell Crowe as Jor-El looks like a solid choice, although it depends largely on the levels of pompousness depicted on Krypton – which we’re promised will be a caped society, whatever that means, perhaps Gerard Butler’s Sparta. By far the best choice is Michael Shannon as General Zod, a move every bit as bizarre as Scarecrow and French Connection star Gene Hackman putting aside grittiness and realism to don a comedy wig as Lex Luthor in 1978. Shannon, from the latest trailer, is bringing the baffled questioning tone of his Revolutionary Road madman as well as the customary menacing fury of Boardwalk Empire and The Iceman. Indeed the only obvious dud in the casting is picking Henry Cavill as Superman, so, only mildly important then… Cavill is physically perfect for the part, but being built like Superman is only half the task, you need the comic timing to be Clark too. Brandon Routh had the physique for Superman, but his Clark wasn’t very good, and the film suffered as a result. Cavill abundantly does not have great comic timing, which makes the promises from Snyder and Goyer that this Clark is an interpretation we’ve never seen before a worrying admission/pre-emption of comic timing failure.\n\nAnd comedy is the big worry when it comes to Man of Steel. The teaser trailer which made it look like Clark was going to spend the whole film moping around the Pacific Northwest ruing the Discovery Channel’s decision to once again not pick his crew to feature on the next season of Deadliest Catch started the concerns. The next trailer deepened those concern, eschewing as it did super-action and seeming to promise a deeply sombre Superman which would resemble nothing else so much as a dramatisation of Seth Cohen’s essay on the loneliness of being Superman which moved his teacher to tears… Finally we got a trailer that softened the pomposity of grand thematic statements about sacrifice, leadership, moral examples by showing us some super-action, but sadly said super-action looked as if it was directed by Michael Bay in blacks, blues, greys and red with cinematographer Janusz Kaminski on hand with his customary supernova to backlight the action. It also seemed to suggest this interpretation’s Lois might play like the reporter in Mr Deeds Goes to Town, debunking the small-town hero under the guise of romance and then feeling guilty. Except Goyer can’t write Capra. Indeed, under his own steam he’s given us Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, Nick Fury: Agent of Shield and Jumper, while the Brothers Nolan, without him, have penned Memento, The Prestige and Inception. You feel sure the Nolans work hard to pen gags, but Superman cinematically needs some good gags or it will implode.\n\nAnd then there’s the CGI… Brandishing the ‘Produced by Christopher Nolan, director of The Dark Knight trilogy’ on your promotional material only goes so far. Nolan shoots on film, on location and in meticulously dressed sound-stages, and with largely practical effects – oftentimes where anybody else would just use ghastly CGI – rendered with a very precise eye for detail by cinematographer Wally Pfister. Snyder really … doesn’t. Zod’s CGI armour and awful looking spaceship stood out for me like a sore thumb, because, along with the CGI cape for Superman, they’re the sort of bizarre decisions that could really blight a movie. Richard Donner said his Superman aimed at not at reality but at verisimilitude, but it appears Snyder has with customary abandon decided to abandon verisimilitude and go for total fantasy. Partly this is because of the times we live in, but also partly because Snyder is not particularly attached to reality at the best of times. But no matter how sombre the trailers make it look, no matter how emotionally devastating the handling of Clark’s pivotal relationships are, and no matter how thrilling it is too see a Superman Begins in which his morality is in formation – and close to Hancock than himself as a result – the scripting by David S Goyer won’t matter a damn if you just tune out when you notice that, like certain action sequences in the blighted Star Wars prequels, not one thing onscreen is actually real. And Sucker-Punch does not inspire confidence there…\n\nSo, there you go. This Man of Steel has a strong chance of crash-landing, but it could soar – let’s hope…\n\nI realise with a shock that I’ve been neglecting Michael Fassbender in this blog, so it’s only right to devote my 100th blog post to the man from Kerry.\n\nFassbender has risen in just seven years from playing the villain in a Sky One show to playing the nascent super-villain in a keenly anticipated summer blockbuster. Next week will see a piece focusing on my concept of Fassbendering, but this week let’s focus on how he made this journey. Fassbender had appeared in Band of Brothers but arguably first truly came to public consciousness as the actor in that famous Guinness ad at the end of 2003 who dived off the Cliffs of Moher and swam to New York to say “Sorry” to his brother for hitting on the brother’s girlfriend. Characteristically Fassbender ended the ad by grinning and appearing to hit on the brother’s girlfriend again. He then played the resident Big Bad in Sky One’s Buffy homage/rip-off Hex. As fallen angel Azazeal he impressed with dark charisma, cut-glass English accent, and the distinct vibe that he was enjoying this part far too much.\n\n2004 also saw him star in Canadian TV movie A Bear Called Winnie where, as a compassionate vet in the Canadian Army who rescued an orphaned bear cub en route to Britain for WWI, he showed an admirable ability to goof around with the adorable pet bear that would be immortalised as Winnie the Pooh. He then played the first of his continuing series of historical figures in Gunpowder, Treason and Plot as Guy Fawkes, and ended 2004 in Rupert Everett’s BBC TV movie Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silk Stocking, displaying his fine ability to be ambiguous as the murder suspect that Holmes insists is a killer despite all evidence clearing him. He then had a showy turn as he smoked and drank his way thru After the Funeral in 2006 as a dissolute possible murderer in ITV’s Poirot, before making the jump from TV movie to actual movie, and London to Hollywood; notably later than his contemporaries Colin Farrell and Cillian Murphy.\n\nFassbender’s ridiculous role as Stelios in Zack Snyder’s bombastic 300 was where things really caught fire. As the film opens with the 300 marching off to battle Fassbender is already grinning, perhaps because he’s realised just how flashy this supporting role is… Stelios is the Spartan who jumps in slow motion to chop off the arm of the Persian who threatens the Spartans with a thousand nation army, “Our arrows will blot out the sun”. Fassbender delivers the famous riposte in a supremely nonchalant manner, and later forms one half of a Spartan Legolas/Gimili style partnership in mayhem and has a slo-mo fight alongside Astinos where they attack and sever Persian limbs left, right and centre. When the Persian mystics are throwing bombs it is Fassbender who runs out, catches one and throws it back, then shelters behind his shield as the arsenal of bombs explodes. Who does something awesome in the denouement to enable Leonidas be even more awesome? Fassbender, of course. Who holds hands with Leonidas for their butch last lines? Fassbender. This is the kind of thing that gets you noticed when your film is an unexpected massive hit.\n\n2008 saw him tackle two more historical figures and also contribute an upsetting turn to stark English horror Eden Lake. I reviewed that film and argued for it as a socio-economic horror as Fassbender and Kelly Reilly’s polite middle-class London couple travel to an idyllic camping spot only to be mercilessly harassed by hoodie-wearing teenagers who steal their jeep, leading to a nigh unwatchable scene where Fassbender’s innocent victim comes up against the gang’s barbed wire and box-cutters. If Fassbender had undercut his 300 image by playing sacrificial lamb to Kelly Reilly’s survivor type he made up for in Channel 4’s Civil War mini-series The Devil’s Whore where he scooped the most dashing role, coveted by Dominic West, as the Levellers’ leader Thomas Rainsborough. He made Rainsborough so charismatic that you could understand why people ignored the contradiction of an aristocrat leading a prototypical socialist movement. The series itself lost momentum after Rainsborough’s tragic demise, which not only underscored Fassbender’s outshining of West and John Simm as leading man, but ironically hammered home the loss to history of the progressive ideas of the Levellers; stifled by Cromwell only to return as demands by the Chartists in the 1840s and actions by Clement Attlee in the 1940s.\n\nFassbender combined elements of those roles as sacrificial lamb and charismatic leader for his tour de force performance as Bobby Sands in Steve McQueen’s debut film Hunger. I regard Hunger as a biopic so utterly oblique as to de-politicise its subject; indeed in its shocking single depiction of just what it is the IRA does it invalidates all accusations that McQueen and co-writer Enda Walsh are somehow ‘fellow travellers’. Turner Prize-winner McQueen reinvented the possibilities of cinema with a film that could almost be a video installation on how the human body slowly declines into death, and how beauty can be found in the mundane. Fassbender was luminous in his one lengthy scene with dialogue, where he argues with Liam Cunningham’s priest, forcing you to appreciate both his point of view and why men would follow this man out on hunger strike and die for him. Fassbender also emulated his acting hero Daniel Day-Lewis as he lost 14 kilos while playing the part and weighed just 59 kilos by the end of shooting. Writing about it at the time I praised Fassbender’s “awesome commitment to the part in the third act as he just wastes away in front of your eyes. This is a mesmerising performance of insane dedication that should see Fassbender go on to even juicier roles.”\n\nAnd go on to juicier roles he did, as 2009 saw Fassbender work with two auteurs, and also Joel Schumacher. Tarantino’s riotous rewriting of history, Inglourious Basterds, oddly enough saw Fassbender being one of the few people playing things straight in his supporting role as Lt. Archie Hicox. As a former film critic dispatched behind enemy lines, most of his lines were delivered (allegedly in a Kerry accent initially) in his second language, German, bar glorious exceptions like “There’s a special place reserved in Hell for people who waste good scotch”. He then starred as Connor opposite newcomer Kate Jarvis as Mia in Andrea Arnold’s kitchen sink drama Fish Tank. A bracingly abrasive picture of life on an Essex council estate punctuated by moments of amazing lyrical beauty, Fassbender’s character opens up possibilities for his girlfriend’s two daughters in a stunning pastoral sequence where he gives them the attention and affection their mother denies them, and encourages Mia to channel her simmering rage at her life into focused attempts to escape it thru professional dancing. Arnold has made the most layered use of the possibilities of Fassbender’s ready smile, as his grinning Connor appears at first as the perfect surrogate father before she traumatically reverses that winning charm. This disquieting role emphasised Fassbender’s freedom from leading men’s crippling need to be loved in every role. Schumacher’s Blood Creek meanwhile may well be remembered eventually as the film where Superman and Magneto clash, but that would require that someone in the world sees it first.\n\nIn 2010 he reunited with both Dominic West and Liam Cunningham for Neil Marshall’s nonsensical historical British action film Centurion, which all concerned presumably filed under ‘guilty pleasure’. He ended the year in a nonsensical historical American action film as henchman Burke in Jonah Hex. His first appearance in the trailer saw him grinning manically while setting fire to a barn with someone in it, but sadly the film was shredded from its initial intentions. One hopes that Fassbender may eventually get to properly work with the madmen/auteurs behind the Crank films. And that leads us to right now, one week before the release of X-Men: First Class…\n\nSo, why is Fassbender a personal hero? Obviously some of it has to do with Fassbendering, but it’s also because Fassbender is a genuinely talented actor with an immense range as well as a charming whimsicality. He can play comedy and tragedy, heroes and villains, equally well, and move from blockbuster to art-house, whimsy to avant-garde, with ease. His part as the younger version of Ian McKellen’s Magneto, as he begins the slow and half-justified decent into super-villainy, is one of the performances I’m anticipating most this year. X-Men: First Class, and Soderbergh’s Haywire in August, as well as Ridley Scott’s Alien prequel Promotheus next year, should catapult Fassbender into the genuine leading man status that Colin Farrell so narrowly missed out on through choosing big-name directors working on vanity projects rather than good scripts. Fassbender in addition appears to be about to make the leap without sacrificing his ability to take on interesting roles in smaller films; with roles as Carl Jung (his latest historical figure) in Cronenberg’s drama A Dangerous Method, Rochester in a pared down Jane Eyre, and the lead in a new Steve McQueen film Shame, all of which are due to be released in the same period as the Vaughn, Soderbergh and Scott blockbusters mentioned above.\n\nThe Rise of Fassbender is only just beginning…"
