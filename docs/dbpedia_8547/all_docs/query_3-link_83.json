        "text": "Hollywood actor Ryan Reynolds, the star, writer, and producer of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's latest offering 'Deadpool and Wolverine,' shared his thoughts on the casting of Henry Cavill as the Wolverine variant, Cavillrine. \"I can't think of a more impossible or frustrating role to recast than something like Wolverine,\" Reynolds remarked during a recent interview.\n\nRyan continued, \"As an actor, that would be awful and intimidating stepping into that. You'd have to really reinvent it and take it a different way.\" He highlighted the unique challenge of filling the shoes of an iconic character that has been firmly established in the public's mind.\n\nadvertisement\n\nReynolds expressed his admiration for Cavill, suggesting that if there were ever a need to cast a new Wolverine, Cavill would be his top choice. \"It was born of, if I had to cast someone as Wolverine and the guy who has made it canon in every way, shape, and form on-screen and off wasn't available for some reason...Henry Cavill,\" he stated.\n\nReynolds further shared his appreciation for Cavill's participation, noting the enjoyable nature of their collaboration. \"Just the conversation with Henry was fun. It's one of the few cameos that's a real cameo,\" he said.\n\nReynolds concluded by emphasising his willingness to support Cavill, saying, \"We love Henry and I'll do anything for him to pay that forward.\"\n\nDirector Shawn Levy credited Reynolds for the idea, mentioning that it came about quickly after discussions regarding the Superman/DC franchise. \"It was not long after the Superman/DC shuffling of the deck and it was on our minds. It was the idea, the name, the text, and an answer all in 15 minutes. That idea was hatched by Ryan. Named by Ryan in that same instance,\" Levy confirmed."
