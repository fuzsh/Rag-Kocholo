        "text": "Henry Cavill is hanging up his cape.\n\nThe actor, 39, recently revealed he won't be reprising his role as Superman in James Gunn's latest film.\n\n\"I have just had a meeting with James Gunn and Peter Safran and it's sad news, everyone,\" he announced in a Dec. 14 Instagram post. \"I will, after all, not be returning as Superman.\"\n\nThe news may surprise followers as Cavill announced on Oct. 24 that he was coming back to play Clark Kent, even sharing a teaser image on Instagram and saying \"the image you see in this post and what you saw in Black Adam are just a very small taste of things to come.\" However, it appears that plans have since changed.\n\n\"After being told by the studio to announce my return back in October, prior to their hire, this news isn't the easiest, but that's life,\" Cavill, who announced that same month that he was leaving The Witcher and that Liam Hemsworth is taking over his role in the Netflix hit, continued. \"The changing of the guard is something that happens. I respect that. James and Peter have a universe to build. I wish them and all involved with the new universe the best of luck, and the happiest of fortunes.\"\n\nGunn—who Warner Bros. declared co-chairman and co-CEO of DC Studios along with Safran on Oct. 25—also shed some light on why Cavill won't be slipping back into the Superman suit for this new movie.\n\n\"Peter & I have a DC slate ready to go, which we couldn't be more over-the-moon about; we'll be able to share some exciting information about our first projects at the beginning of the new year,\" he wrote in a series of tweets that same day. \"Among those on the slate is Superman. In the initial stages, our story will be focusing on an earlier part of Superman's life, so the character will not be played by Henry Cavill.\"\n\nBut could moviegoers see Cavill fly back onto their screens in the future?\n\n\"But we just had a great meeting with Henry and we're big fans,\" Gunn continued, \"and we talked about a number of exciting possibilities to work together in the future.\""
