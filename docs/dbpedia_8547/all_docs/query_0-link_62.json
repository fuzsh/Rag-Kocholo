        "text": "The time is 1963, and Cavill plays Napoleon Solo, a former criminal turned US superspy. He’s in East Berlin to rescue an auto mechanic named Gaby (Ex Machina’s Alicia Vikander), whose father is at the heart of a plot to enrich uranium and build nuclear weapons. While trying to get her over the wall, Solo is interrupted by Illya Kuryakin (Hammer, taking his best Boris Badenov accent for a spin), a Russian spy with the same mission. Eventually the two men are forced by their respective bosses to team up to find Gaby’s father. With neither trusting the other — and the wild card of Gaby’s affections in play — the requisite hijinks ensue.\n\nDon’t worry if you don’t know the TV show; judging from the film, I’m not sure Ritchie or his writing partner did either. But from a production standpoint, the film is beautiful: the costume design evokes the idealized ‘60s perfectly, and the photography is so lush I found myself lost in the hazy glow of Cavill and Hammer’s chiseled visages (I’m joking, but only partly). Ritchie’s films have always had an undeniable, kinetic energy to them, and while the vibe feels a little forced this time around — slapping music on and turning it up to 11 only works the first four times, thank you — there are nevertheless hints of a fun, engaging movie here. I couldn’t help but wonder what it would have been like if it was Clooney’s scowl and charm wrapped up in Solo’s suit, pulling the audience along with sheer charismatic will. Instead…\n\nBoth Cavill and Hammer are different versions of the same problem, one Ritchie has never had to contend with in quite this way. Whether it’s Downey, Jude Law, Statham — hell, even Gerard Butler — the director has always worked best with actors that seem perched on the edge of instability. It lends a vitality to the proceedings that matches up perfectly with his own, nearly out-of-control sensibilities — but more importantly, it’s a quality almost all of the best stars — the most memorable, the most beloved — have had. In a time when the film industry is relying on the safe, consistent box office of the comic book movie more than ever before, things like personality and voice — whether on the part of writers, directors, or actors — are more vital than ever. Iron Man isn’t huge simply because of Marvel Comics; it’s huge because of the undeniable draw of Robert Downey, Jr.\n\nSome of our best actors seem perched on the edge of instability\n\nOf course, that’s not really the way the game is played, is it? Actors have to struggle out of the straightjacket of typecasting to maintain any kind of diversity in their work — even more so if they want to attain that status of full-fledged movie star — even though that’s the very thing that gives their careers longevity and depth. Brad Pitt is now looked upon as a stalwart, but it wasn’t his golden-boy turns in Troy and Meet Joe Black that made it possible; it was a perfect mix of conventional roles ping-ponged with the weird (12 Monkeys), the horrifying (Se7en), and the outright ill-advised (Fight Club).\n\nThe Man From UNCLE likely won’t pull in the kind of box office numbers to warrant the trilogy it’s hoping to start, and I can’t really say that audiences will be missing out on a whole lot. Hopefully it will encourage both of these actors to take some risks (Cavill certainly can’t be hurting for a payday). I’d like to see Hammer in his Se7en, Cavill in his American Beauty. I’d like to see them get the chance to step outside the magazine cover roles they seem to be continually steered toward, and for their directors to stop worrying about turning them into movie stars, and to see what they can really do.\n\nThe Man From UNCLE is now playing."
