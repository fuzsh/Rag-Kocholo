        "text": "This story has been UPDATED with the statement below from Warner Bros.\n\nHenry Cavill is reportedly done with the role of Superman. Per the Hollywood Reporter, the actor has apparently parted ways with Warner Bros. after three films in the role. The trade paper's reporter Tatiana Siegel also tweeted: \"As for who broke up with whom, Warner Bros. was the one who decided to move on from Henry Cavill.\"\n\nFollowing Man of Steel, Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League, Cavill was in talks to cameo in the upcoming Shazam! According to THR, contract talks broke down, and the chances for a further appearance are all but through. Apparently, scheduling conflicts have become an issue for Cavill and the studio, which is supported by the actor's new role as Geralt in Netflix's The Witcher.\n\nIn a statement to THR, Warner Bros. said: \"While no decisions have been made regarding any upcoming Superman films, weâ€™ve always had great respect for and a great relationship with Henry Cavill, and that remains unchanged.\"\n\nOn Warner Bros.' side, sources have reportedly said another Superman solo movie is several years away, with the studio's focus shifted towards releasing a Supergirl origin story. The traditional DC timeline means Cavill's Superman would likely be a baby in any movie about the superheroine's early years, ruling out any need for him.\n\nOne source told THR that Warner Bros. has recognised the current DC universe hasn't connected, and is attempting to reset it.\n\nIf Cavill has left, it's another major change to the established DCEU. Ben Affleck will reportedly leave the role of Batman following Suicide Squad 2, and DC Films as a whole has a new boss following the commercial and critical disappointment of Justice League.\n\nUPDATE 2: Cavill's manager, Dany Garcia, tweeted the following response shortly before Warners released their statement:\n\nJoe Skrebels is IGN's UK News Editor, and he now wants Geralt to appear in Shazam! instead. Follow him on Twitter."
