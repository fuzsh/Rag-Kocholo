He served from 1945 until 1952, where he stayed on as part of the occupying force after Hitler's defeat (8 May 1945).\n\nDuring his stint in the army Napoleon Solo began stealing and selling arts and antiques with great success, continuing his illegal practices after leaving the army. He was so prolific and successful, \"4 countries created a special task force with the sole purpose of bringing him to justice\". He was eventually caught in June of 1958 [3] and sentenced to 15 years [4] for robbery, handling stolen goods and serial theft of arts and antiquities.\n\nCIA service[]\n\nThe CIA, in deference to Solo's skill set and expertise, offered to suspend his sentence in return for his services as an intelligence operative, presumably in mid or late June 1958. He quickly becomes the best in the bureau.\n\nOn June 10, 1963, Napoleon gets Gaby Teller out of East Berlin. [5]\n\nU.N.C.L.E. service[]\n\nAfter their mission in Rome, Napoleon is recruited by Waverly, a British intelligence officer of MI5, to the newly named team U.N.C.L.E. where he along with Gaby Teller and Illya Kuryakin are immediately assigned a new mission in Istanbul.
