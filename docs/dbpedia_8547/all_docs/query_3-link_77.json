        "text": "Our December cover guy Henry Cavill is starring as Geralt of Rivia in the upcoming The Witcher series, but fans might not know this isn't Cavill's first time on the small screen. For three years, he played Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk on the historical period show The Tudors. But let's be real here: Most of us think of Cavill as Superman. Cavill has played the superhero in Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and Justice League, and the franchise has grossed about $2 billion worldwide.\n\nSo while we're pumped about The Witcher, let's take a look back at Cavill's career with a list of the actor's best movies.\n\nThe Count of Monte Cristo\n\nThis 2002 movie based on the classic novel by Alexandre Dumas was one of Cavill's first big screen roles. Director Kevin Reynolds told Men's Health that he auditioned \"a crop of tadpoles\" before choosing Cavill to play Albert Mondego.\n\nStardust\n\n2007's Stardust featured an ensemble cast including Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Claire Danes, Charlie Cox, and Ian McKellen. The fantasy film was based on the Neil Gaiman novel of the same name—a magical story of a young man who tries to fetch a falling star for the woman he loves.\n\nTristan & Isolde\n\nDirector Ridley Scott had wanted to make Tristan & Isolde since the 1970s, and he ended up producing the 2006 romantic drama. Cavill's co-star James Franco later called the movie his \"favorite mistake,\" partly because he seriously injured his knee during filming.\n\nImmortals\n\nCavill played the mythological character Theseus in this 2011 film, and he had to get in Greek god shape in order to fulfill his role. \"It was my first experience working on a movie and having my shirt off for most of the damn time,\" Cavill told Men's Health. He went on a strict diet for six months and trained in martial arts in order to film the movie's fight scenes.\n\nThe Man from U.N.C.L.E.\n\n2015 saw Cavill star in this spy film, which was based on the 1964 TV series of the same name. Cavill's character was the double-crossing American agent Napoleon Solo, and his performance actually led to his roles in Mission: Impossible—Fallout and The Witcher.\n\n\"Something in Henry's comic timing told me he had talents that weren’t being exploited,\" Mission: Impossible director Christopher McQuarrie told Men's Health. \"I found he had a charming sense of humor—at which point I knew he could be a villain. The best villains enjoy their work.\"\n\nMission: Impossible – Fallout\n\nCavill definitely brought a villain's flair—and a lot of muscle—into the furious CIA assassin August Walker, and his fight scenes in the movie are a marvel to watch.\n\nIn 2018, Cavill told Collider about the intense training he went through for that bathroom scene: \"We trained and got the fight choreography and the various stunts drilled into our muscle memory during any moments that we could get away from the shooting schedule. Overall the bathroom fight took 4 weeks to shoot, which, for a scene as intense as that, definitely felt uncomfortably long.\"\n\nThe film was a hit, and it made over $700 million worldwide.\n\nEnola Holmes"
