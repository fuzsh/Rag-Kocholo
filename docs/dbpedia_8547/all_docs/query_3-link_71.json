        "text": "In one short scene, the merc with the mouth encounters a Wolverine variant played by Cavill, who smokes a cigar while working on a motorbike. He responds to Deadpool by punching him with his Adamantium claws, which sends the red-suited antihero flying backward.\n\nThis version of Wolverine is called \"The Cavillerine\" in the credits. He appears to be a direct response to fans' suggestions that the Superman actor should play Wolverine alongside the Avengers in the MCU.\n\nThis was largely because no one expected Jackman to return to the role after he left the character behind in 2017's \"Logan.\"\n\nOn Monday, Cavill broke his silence about the role and wrote on Instagram: \"To be safe, I shaved the moustache off for this one. Just the moustache.\"\n\nAside from the fact that Wolverine famously has a mutton chops beard with no mustache, Cavill's joke appears to be a subtle reference to 2017's \"Justice League.\"\n\nAudiences might remember that Cavill was working on \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" when he returned to the \"Justice League\" set for reshoots.\n\nHe wasn't allowed to shave his \"Fallout\" mustache to shoot new \"Justice League\" scenes, but Warner Bros. attempted to overcome this by using CGI to give Superman a clean-shaven look.\n\nRelated stories\n\nHowever, the result was less than ideal and fans tore into the scenes where it was obvious Cavill's face had been edited.\n\nStill, \"Fallout\" earned $791 million worldwide according to Box Office Mojo — making it the highest earning entry in the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise — and the sequel was met with widespread praise from audiences and critics alike.\n\nThe same could not be said for \"Justice League.\" Even though it made $661 million, it wasn't enough to break even, and it was widely panned.\n\nDC fans even started a campaign to convince Warner Bros. to release the original version of the film, which director Zack Snyder worked on before leaving the project after his daughter's death in 2017."
