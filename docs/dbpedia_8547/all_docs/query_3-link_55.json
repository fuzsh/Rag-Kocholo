        "text": "Appearing on Conan last night, actor Henry Cavill, who played Superman in 2013's Man of Steel and most recently in this year's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, recalled how he came to land the iconic part. As it turns out, Cavill was playing World of Warcraft when director Zack Snyder called to inform him that he landed the role for Man of Steel.\n\n\"I was playing World of Warcraft at the time and I had my priorities straight,\" he said, referencing why he didn't pick up right away. \"It was an important part of a particular dungeon that I was going through.\"\n\nHe didn't realize it was Snyder calling. When he did, he quickly grabbed his phone--but it was too late.\n\n\"I looked across at the last moment and I saw Zack Snyder's name on the phone, so I grabbed the phone and then I missed it. I called him back immediately and said, 'I'm really sorry; I was saving someone's life.'\"\n\nIt all worked out, as Cavill played Superman in Man of Steel and was brought back for Dawn of Justice. Cavill is also signed up to play Superman in Snyder's upcoming Justice League movies.\n\nThis isn't the first time Cavill has talked about his gaming habits and Snyder's call specifically, as he told Vanity Fair in 2013 that he thought Snyder was calling him to tell him he didn't get the part."
