        "text": "Brandon Routh played Superman in the 2006 comic book movie “Superman Returns,” which followed the Man of Steel as he returns to Earth after a prolonged absence and reconnects with Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) and faces off against Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey). Although Routh earned acclaim for channeling Christopher Reeve, the film nosedived at the box office with just $391 million worldwide and did not lead to a new franchise for the actor. Routh reprised this iteration of Superman on episodes of The CW comic book series “The Flash,” “Legends of Tomorrow” and “Batwoman.”\n\nHenry Cavill played Superman in Zack Snyder’s DC Universe, starting with his own 2013 standalone movie “Man of Steel” and continuing with 2016’s “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” and 2017’s “Justice League.” He intended to return as the superhero after reprising Superman in the post-credits scene of 2022’s “Black Adam,” which set up a future in the DC Universe where he’d go toe-to-toe against Dwayne Johnson.\n\nJust over a month later, Warner Bros. and DC Studios announced Gunn and Safran as the latter company’s new bosses. The duo were tasked with overhauling the DC Universe on the big screen, and their plan included bringing in a new Superman actor to anchor their universe. It was an especially tough blow for Cavill, who had exited his starring role on Netflix’s “The Witcher” presumably because his future appeared to include more Superman projects prior to Gunn and Safran’s hiring.\n\nNicolas Cage made a surprise cameo appearance as the Man of Steel in 2022’s “The Flash,” closing the loop on a role that he was supposed to play for director Tim Burton in a failed Superman movie that never got off the ground. The duo were supposed to make “Superman Lives” in 1998 from a script by Kevin Smith. The plot focused on Superman’s fight against Doomsday. Despite spending over $30 million on the film’s casting and pre-production, Warner Bros. pulled the plug on “Superman Lives” due to creative differences.\n\n“If you really wanted to know what I was going do with that character, look at my performance in ‘City of Angels,’” Cage once told USA Today about what fans could’ve expected from his iteration of Superman. “I was supposed [to play] Clark Kent after that and I was already developing this alien otherness playing this angel. That is a perfect example of the tonality you would’ve gotten for Kal-El and for Clark Kent: Clark would’ve been a little more amusing but Kal-El had the sensitivity and the goodness and the vulnerability and all those feelings that were kind of angelic and also terrifying.”\n\nDavid Corenswet is making his debut as the Man of Steel in James Gunn’s 2025 tentpole “Superman,” previously titled “Superman: Legacy.” The movie is kicking off a brand new DC Universe that will span movies, television series and video games. Gunn is overseeing the DC Universe along with Peter Safran.\n\nCorenswet is getting the big break of a lifetime as the star of “Superman,” which marks his first time leading a major Hollywood tentpole film. The 30-year-old actor is best known for his supporting roles in two Ryan Murphy-created Netflix series, “The Politician” and “Hollywood.” His most notable film role prior to “Superman” was in “Pearl,” the Ti West-directed horror movie starring Mia Goth.\n\n“Superman” is set to open in theaters July 11, 2025, from Warner Bros."
