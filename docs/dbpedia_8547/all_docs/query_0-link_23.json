        "text": "Armie Hammer has given several of the worst performances in recent years — see, or rather don’t, “Mirror Mirror” and “J. Edgar.” The big surprise in “The Man from U.N.C.L.E” is that Henry Cavill is even worse.\n\nMuch worse: Cavill gives the most slappable performance of the year as Napoleon Solo, a CIA agent who, in 1963 Europe, is forced to work with Russian counterpart Illya Kuryakin (Hammer) to help the daughter (Alicia Vikander) of a German atomic scientist stop neo-Nazis from acquiring the Bomb.\n\nCavill’s Solo, and the movie, are aggressively quippy, which is what happens when screenwriters set out to be funny but give up when they’re halfway there. Cavill’s brand of heavy sarcasm is rife with ironic emphases and smarmy pauses: “Not very good at this whole ‘subtlety’ thing, are you?” It’s the tone of an “SNL” actor — Chris Parnell, maybe — playing an actor playing a doctor in a fake commercial for hemorrhoids.\n\nThe studied nonchalance kills any chance at making director/co-writer Guy Ritchie’s shootouts and chases exciting. He apes Sergio Leone by freezing the action, making the music swell and sometimes cutting away to a digression — one aside involves Solo helping himself to a glass of wine while speedboats are going up in flames around him.\n\nRitchie’s plot, a rough draft of a James Bond movie, doesn’t seem to interest him much — a climactic amphibious assault is staged like a Duran Duran video. Though Elizabeth Debicki is amusing as a neo-Nazi princess who looks as if she came straight from a Leni Riefenstahl fashion shoot, mostly we see the two lead spies tussle in public lavatories, traipse in and out of one another’s hotel rooms and exchange lines like, “I’ll take the top” and “I’ll take the bottom.” Somehow the movie manages to be even gayer than “J. Edgar.” A key conversation happens with Hammer staring at Cavill’s posterior, and the boys spat about their favorite ladies’ fashion accessories.\n\nVikander’s Gaby, a supposed love interest, has to literally tackle Illya to get him to notice her, and watching the 75-pound actress flatten the sequoia-sized Hammer is especially bizarre. When forced to touch her thigh to check a tracking device, he looks like a man gingerly reaching into a baseboard to flush out a nest of spiders.\n\nOnly an energetic chase at the end, a multigenre musical score and Hugh Grant, as a Brit of dubious loyalty, partially redeem the film. It falls to Grant to deliver the one funny line, after Solo executes what he thinks is a debonair move: “I watched your trick with the tablecloth. Were you once a waiter?”"
