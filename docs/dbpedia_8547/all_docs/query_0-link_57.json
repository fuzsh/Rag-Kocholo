        "text": "It was a pleasure to host actor Henry Cavill when he came to BAM to record ADR for the upcoming spy movie “The Man from U.N.C.L.E.”! In a session engineered by Dave Leffel, Cavill recorded additional dialogue on our ADR Stage for the film via an ISDN connection with WB De Lane Lea Studios in London. This connection allowed writer and director Guy Ritchie to provide direction during the session. “The Man from U.N.C.L.E.” is a “spy-fi” movie based on a popular TV series of the same name that aired in the late 1960s. Set at the height of the Cold War, the movie centers on two secret agents in their attempt to stop an international criminal organization in its tracks. In the film Cavill plays Napoleon Solo, an American CIA agent who forms an unlikely partnership with his Russian counterpart Illya Kuryakin (portrayed by actor Armie Hammer). Other stars of the film include Elizabeth Debicki, Alicia Vikander, Hugh Grant, and Jared Harris. Henry Cavill is best known for his portrayal of Superman in “Man of Steel” and the upcoming “Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice,” and has also appeared on projects such as “Immortals” and “The Tudors.” “The Man from U.N.C.L.E.” is set to premiere in August of 2015.\n\nTo read more about Henry Cavill, click here: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0147147/\n\nTo read more about “The Man from U.N.C.L.E.”, click here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1638355/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_4"
