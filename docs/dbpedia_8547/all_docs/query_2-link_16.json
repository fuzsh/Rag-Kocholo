        "text": "The Gentleman\n\nRepresenting the\n\nUnited Network Command\n\nfor\n\nLaw and Enforcement\n\n(Click on the image to zoom in and out.)\n\n... isn't a likely name for a hit television show. Nor was Solo, the original title proposed for the series. That offered too many opportunities for discourteous jibes. So The Man from UNCLE it was.\n\nThe Man From UNCLE sprang up from the spy-fiction craze that began with the release of the movie Dr. No. The picture was based on the novel by Ian Fleming and told of the adventures of British Secret Service Agent Number 007.\n\nDr. No ended up being the sleeper of 1962. Although the critics seemed lukewarm, the box office raked in enough dough that the studio repaid the banks in a few months. The second Bond film, From Russia With Love, was released the next year. It brought in even more money and made Sean Connery a star.\n\nBy the beginning of 1964 the spy craze was in full swing, and a third Bond film, Goldfinger, was released. The timing couldn't have been better. The first show of the Man From Uncle - \"The Vulcan Affair\" - was broadcast on September 22, 1964, just five days after Goldfinger hit the theaters.\n\nThe Man From Uncle followed the American television standard that you had to have good guys fight bad guys but you didn't want to offend anyone. So the show's premise was there was a vaguely structured international criminal organization that had some ill-defined agenda for controlling the world. It had infiltrated every country from the local to national levels and was wreaking havoc and mayhem on a weekly basis. Their nefarious plans included espionage, sabotage, kidnappings, and even assassinations. But somehow no one ever noticed the organization even existed.\n\nOf course, any secret criminal organization needs a snappy acryonymatic name that everyone can remember. Since a name like SPECTRE was already taken and someone else had dibs on KAOS, the bad guys picked the name THRUSH.\n\nNaturally everyone wanted to know what the letters meant. It was a stretch but eventually a paperback novelist decided they stood for the Technological Hierarchy for the Removal of Undesirables and the Subjugation of Humanity\".\n\nOf course, the \"good\" governments of the world had to get together and create their own organization to thwart the evil plans of THRUSH. Naturally no one should know this organization exists either. And they also needed a acryonymiacal name but one that showed they were good guys. So they decided on The United Network Command for Law and Enforcement which acronyms down to the family friendly name UNCLE.\n\nThe two principle agents of UNCLE were an American named Napoleon Solo played by Robert Vaughn and a Russian named Ilya Kuryakin played by David McCallum (who is actually Scottish). The headquarters of UNCLE are in New York City but with branch offices ranging from Singapore to Tulsa. Napoleon and Ilya's boss was the effective but placid Alexander Waverly.\n\nThe \"front\" for UNCLE's headquarters was Del Floria's Tailor Shop (Dry Cleaning and Pressing) in the East 40's. To get into the headquarters proper the agents entered through a fitting room with a false wall. Mr. Del Floria had to push the steam lever of the pressing machine twice to open the door to let the agents in.\n\nTHRUSH also needed secure headquarters all over the world that no one knew about. How they tackled this was explained in The Arabian Affair. Since there is no 13th story in buildings, THRUSH just installed their offices in the space between the 12th and 14th floors. So anywhere with tall buildings had a THRUSH office. But you do wonder why no one ever noticed there were people getting on and off the elevator on a floor that didn't exist.\n\nA surprise to students of popular culture is just who first came up with the hero's name. That was none other than the creator of James Bond, Ian Fleming. Norman Felton, who with Sam Rolfe is credited with creating the series, arranged to meet with Ian and discuss the projected series. Ian suggested the hero be dubbed Napoleon Solo, a name suggested by one of the characters in his book Goldfinger.\n\nOriginally Norman and Sam wanted Ian as a consultant and were willing to pay him $25,000 per episode. But a combination of reluctance on the part of the producers of the Bond films plus Ian's own poor health led him to drop out of the project.\n\nThat one of the biggest hits in television lasted only four seasons is flabbergasting today when comedy shows last nigh on half a century and aren't even funny. Other classic and iconic television programs with surprisingly short runs have been The Wild Wild West (also four seasons), Monty Python's Flying Circus (yes, four seasons), and of course Star Trek (only three).1\n\nAs for shows that have had decades long runs that should have been dropped after a single season (or episode) are ...\n\nWell, never mind.\n\nWhat stamped UNCLE apart from other weekly television shows was the complexity of its production. The scenes were generally brief and were supposed to range over the world. You might start in the UNCLE headquarters and then move to exotic locales like the Yukon then to Japan to a monastery in Italy, and to - get this - the Cardiac Indian Reservation in Oklahoma.2 Multiple set-ups per day were needed to keep the action moving as the static three camera set up de rigueur for sit-coms just wouldn't do.\n\nSince the action for a single episode was supposed to be spread out over many cities and countries, there was a need for appropriate sets to serve as the streets of New York, islands in the Mediterranean, the casbah in the Middle East, jungles in the Caribbean Islands, the deserts of Arabia, and an American surburbanite home. Forty sets for an episode weren't unusual, and one show, \"The Prince of Darkness Affair\", (with a campy Dracula-like character played by Martin Landau) required over eighty separate sets. Fortunately what was available on the sound stages and the back lots of the studio usually sufficed, thank you.\n\nTo save time and money, the scenes in television programs and movies aren't filmed in the order as they appear on the screen. Scenes at a single location are shot at the same set-up even if they appear at different points in the plot.3 The personal lives of the actors' also affected the schedule. Because Leo G. Carroll's health wasn't the best, he would have all his scenes filmed at a sitting. Robert Vaughn was studying for his Ph. D. in Communications at the University of Southern California. So his time on the set would be adjusted to allow him to attend classes and give him time for the writing of his thesis, Only Victims: A Study of Show Business Blacklisting.\n\nAs indicated in the title of the pilot - Solo - Napoleon was clearly the star, and there were several shows with only minimal Kuryakin. In the first season, there were three episodes where Ilya didn't appear at all. But he became so popular that in the third season David McCallum was upped from \"co-starring\" status to full-star billing with Robert. Later there were some episodes where Ilya was the main character.\n\nAnd no, the distinctive hairstyle for Ilya (whose middle name was the non-existent Russian patronym Nickovetch) was not created just for the show. David began sporting his bangs in 1956 and he once pointed out that he did not have a Beatle haircut. It was the Beatles, he said, who had a McCallum haircut.\n\nAs unthinkable as it is, the Man From UNCLE almost had no Ilya at all. In the original pilot, the chief of UNCLE was not Alexander Waverly played by Leo G. Carroll. Instead it was Mr. Allison and was played by Will Kuluva.\n\nBut after the pilot was completed, Norman Felton got a call from one of NBC's top brass. He couldn't remember the actor's name, the executive said, but he wanted the guy with the \"K\" name to be replaced with someone older. \"You mean Kuluva?\" Norm asked. Yes, the executive said, that's the guy.\n\nSo Norm began looking for a more senior replacement for the head of UNCLE. Since Will was in his fifties, Norm contacted Leo G. Carroll, a veteran stage actor with cinematic credits and who was now edging into his late seventies. Leo said, sure, he'd take the part.\n\nLater Norman got another call. Wasn't Leo, although a good actor, a bit too old to play the head of a major intelligence organization? Norm scratched his head. But wasn't that what the big bosses wanted?\n\nUpon further discussion, it dawned on Norman that the executive had not meant the actor with the \"K\" name - Kuluva. Instead it was the actor playing the \"K\" character - \"Kuryakin\". That is, the executive had wanted to replace David McCallum with an actor with a less boyish visage. Given that David and Leo's characters were major contributors to the show's success this is an instructive example of how brilliant business decisions are made.\n\nSometimes Ilya's name gave the actors problems as well. In one of the early shows one of the UNCLE clerical staff mispronounced the name and in \"The Very Important Zombie Affair\" Captain Ramirez (Rodolfo Acosta) says the name as kur-EYE-yan. Evidently the director simply chose not to re-shoot. The correct pronunciation is, of course, kur-ee-YAH-kin.\n\nAlthough Leo's role tended to be limited compared to Robert's and David's, the unflappable demeanor and dry wit of Alexander Wavery soon became popular with the viewers, and even in some of the earlier shows he was given an expanded role. His grandchildren also told him they would like to see him do more than just sit behind his desk. So the writers gave Leo extra action in The Five Summit Affair, The Bow-Wow Affair, and The Deep-Six Affair. In the first season's The Deadly Decoy Affair, Mr. Waverly actually deals a THRUSH baddie a karate chop.\n\nThe Man From UNCLE went off the air over half a century ago, but it's still popular with the fans although what passed for high technology in the 1960's is now creaky and quaint: room sized \"mainframe\" computers with flashing lights and reel-to-reel tapes, cord-tethered black dial telephones and public coin fed payphones, and even typewriters. The villains are often drawn from common stereotypes of the era: the evil industrialist, the Fez-wearing middle easterner, the mad scientist, and given the timeframe of the show, there's always the \"escaped Nazi\" who's trying to keep the ideals of the Reich alive. If someone talks with a non-American accent, he's probably a bad guy.\n\nYes, although the ladies were usually the episode's \"innocent\" - an everyday person who somehow gets swept into the adventure - some villains were women. They did, though, tend to be drawn from a less stereotypical evil-person pool than the fellows. Of course, they could still be beautiful blondes, redheads, or brunettes. But in \"The Suburbia Affair\" the THRUSH villain is a grey-haired middle aged matron played by Reta Shaw - and she was mean! In \"The Hula Doll Affair\", one of the fully comedic episodes, brothers Peter and Simon Sweet are both THRUSH agents and both are bucking for the promotion to be the head of THRUSH New York. The Sweet brothers are played by Pat Harrington and - get this - Jan Murray with the role of their doting mother filled by Patsy Kelly. Unknown to her sons -SPOILER ALERT! - Mama Sweet is also a THRUSH agent and is actually the head of the board of directors that will decide who gets the promotion.\n\nNot all episodes are created equal and some episodes were created more equal than others. Although today many viewers won't even look at a show in black and white, the first season's programs are ranked among the top. Certainly no one can forget \"The Project Strigas Affair\" where Werner Klemperer (yes, \"Colonel Klink) does a good job playing a bad guy diplomat and his assistant is played by none other than Leonard Nimoy, \"Mr. Spock\". And the two innocents are Perry Anne Gardner and - yes - William Shatner, \"Captain Kirk\". Oddly, Bill said he didn't remember meeting Leonard during the filming. Another favorite is \"The Never-Never Affair\" featuring Barbara Feldon (\"Agent 99\") as a bespectacled UNCLE translator who wants to become an agent. Here Napoleon's over developed sense of humor almost causes a major security breach, and Cesar Romero stars as the suave urbane THRUSH agent.\n\nOf the later shows in color, one of the best had to be \"The Foxes and Hounds Affair\" where Vincent Price plays the THRUSH villain Victor Marton - not as suave as Cesar but suave enough. Victor is trying to steal a mind reading machine that the magician-inventor wants to give to UNCLE. Of course, he fails.\n\nAlthough \"The Very Important Zombie Affair\" has every voodoo stereotype in evidence, Claude Akins is quite good as an evil Caribbean dictator named El Supremo who has transformed one of his western friendly political opponents into a zombie. \"The Dippy Blonde Affair\" actually makes you feel sorry for the THRUSH head of station played by Robert Strauss. It seems decidedly strange that the THRUSH engineer Harry Pendleton (Fabrizio Mioni) permits his girlfriend Jojo (the \"dippy blonde\" played by Joyce Jameson) who knows nothing of THRUSH to freely enter the headquarters and walk around at will. She even attends THRUSH parties where she was noted as \"the martini champion.\" Maybe now we know why THRUSH was never able to conquer the world.\n\nAnother of the top shows was \"The Minus-X Affair\" where UNCLE is working with scientist Dr. Lillian Stemmler (Eve Arden) to make a chemical called \"Plus-X\" that makes people smarter. But Dr. Stemmler is actually a THRUSH agent and is also working on \"Minus-X\" which makes people revert back to their childhood. If the guards at important military bases are exposed to Minus-X then THRUSH agents could just walk in and take what they want. There is some doubt about Dr. Stemmler's loyalty to THRUSH but Arthur Rollo, her boss (played by Theodore Marcuse), has kidnapped her estranged and party-girl daughter, Leslie, so that Dr. Stemmler doesn't slack off on the job. Naturally UNCLE prevails and THRUSH is worsted.\n\nSome shows were played mostly for comedy. There was not only the \"Hula Doll Affair\", but \"The Hot Number Affair\" features then husband and wife rock duo Sonny Bono and Cher Sarkisian. They work for two New York garment salesmen, played by George Tobias and Ned Glass (both characters are named \"Harry\"). The bad guy - and he's really bad - is played by long time character actor Joe Mantell (famous for playing Angle who was Ernest Borgnine's best friend in Marty). The \"Hot Number Affair\" has been panned as one of the worst episodes, but others see it as good fun.\n\nThe Man From UNCLE was not the first of the 1960's television spy series. That accolade must go to the British program The Avengers. It starred (among others) Honor Blackman as judo expert Cathy Gale, although her fans also remember her as Hera in Jason and the Argonauts and Miss Galore in Goldfinger. Premiered in 1961, The Avengers was not only pre-UNCLE but pre-James Bond!4\n\nFor a while it looked like spy shows would displace the Western. Airing soon after The Man From Uncle were I Spy, It Takes a Thief, Secret Agent, Mission Impossible, The Prisoner (filmed in Britain), and the spy spoof Get Smart. But there was always The Wild Wild West for those who wanted to have their spies and cowboys, too.\n\nAnd yes, there were Man From UNCLE movies before the more recent post-Millennium incarnation. The first movie was essentially the pilot (in color) with some added scenes. Released as To Trap a Spy, Robert and David played Napoleon and Ilya, but their boss was Mr. Allison as played by Will Kuluva. Instead of THRUSH, UNCLE was battling WASP. A pared down and black and white version - with Leo G. Carroll as Mr. Waverly and THRUSH instead of WASP - became the first show broadcast \"The Vulcan Affair\".\n\nThe seven other movies with Robert, David, and Leo, were put together from other television episodes supplemented with some extra scenes specifically shot for the movie (to add a bit of steam for the paying audience) or scenes borrowed from other episodes. Possibly because the movies were largely the same as the programs that everyone watched on television and for nothing, some were released only in England and not in the United States.\n\nThe added scenes also gave extra opportunity for continuity errors. For instance the movie One Spy Too Many was created from the television episode \"The Alexander the Greater Affair\". Alexander (played by a young Rip Torn) is - what else? - an evil business magnate who wants to take over the world. His chief henchman is Parviz (David Sheiner) and Parviz appears early in the show where he is a typical mustachioed villain with a smoothly shaven pate. But in an added scene filmed just for the movie, he seems to be wearing a bald cap. Also Yvonne Craig - Batgirl on Batman - is slipped into the movie version as Maude Waverly, Mr. Waverly's niece. Her job seems to be mostly hanging around headquarters and teasing Napoleon. Yvonne had a more substantial role in the first season's \"The Brain Killer Affair\".\n\nThe Man From Uncle had one of those notable openings that was a hallmark of 1960's television. THRUSH agents have infiltrated UNCLE headquarters with an assignment to assassinate Mr. Waverly. But one of them encounters an UNCLE agent seen only in front silhouette. The THRUSH agent fires his gun only to have the bullet splinter a clear protective shield. Repeated shots are no more effective. Then lights come up and it's Napoleon!\n\nNaturally from time to time Napoleon and Ilya get captured by THRUSH villains. And rather than soil their own hands with doing away with the UNCLE agent, the villains tie them up with some fiendish contraption that will do them in after a few minutes. Because the THRUSH agents seem to have a squeamish side, they always leave and so give Napoleon and Ilya plenty of time to escape.\n\nThis kill-'em-but-let-'em-escape scenario was best exemplified in the two-part episode \"The Alexander the Greater Affair\". At the end of Part I, Alexander leaves Ilya and Alexander's ex-wife Tracey (Dorothy Provine) tied up and suspended above a deep pit while a candle burns through the rope. Napoleon is strapped onto a table with a slowly descending Edgar Allan Poe type pendulum swinging above him. Of course, Napoleon manages to escape before being cleft in twain and manages to save Ilya and Tracey.5\n\nThe closing of the show became almost as iconic as the opening. The credits were displayed on fast cuts of scenes from the shows with Ilya and Napoleon in action. And each show closed with the notice:\n\nWe wish to thank the\n\nUnited Network Command for Law\n\nand Enforcement, without whose\n\nassistance this program would\n\nnot have been possible.\n\nThis statement likely suckered in some of the more credulous to believe there really was an UNCLE and a THRUSH, much as the \"disclaimer\" from the movie The Andromeda Strain had some believing the action of the movie really happened. In the movie there was a splash card that was displayed on the screen:\n\nThis film contains the four day history of a major American scientific crisis. We received the help of many generous people attached to Project Scoop at Vandenberg Air Force Base and the Wildfire Laboratory in Flatrock, Nevada. They encourage us to tell the story accurately and in detail. The documents presented here are soon to be made public. They do not in any way jeopardize national security.\n\nAlthough this statement was included - as stated on a popular informational website - to \"enhance\" the story, some people swallowed it. But The Andromeda Strain was pure fiction.\n\nSo may have it been with The Man From UNCLE. But if UNCLE's viewers were careful to look at the fine print below the - quote - \"acknowledgements\" - unquote - they would also have read:\n\nThe events, characters, and firms depicted in this photoplay\n\nare fictitious. Any similarity to actual persons, living or\n\ndead, or to actual firms, is purely coincidental.\n\nThat's any events, characters, and FIRMS are fictitious. That includes Napoleon, Ilya, Del Floria's, THRUSH, and yes, UNCLE.\n\nThat there could be people who think that an acknowledgement is true, even when it's immediately followed by a disclaimer stating that it's fiction, is enough, well, it's enough to make you say\n\nU.
