        "text": "Article content\n\nHenry Cavill is feeling just super, man.\n\nAnd why shouldn’t he be? After spending the first chunk of his career in small and mostly unheralded roles, the 32-year-old Brit has gunned for James Bond, flirted with Fifty Shades of Grey and is the titular bulletproof hero of Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel. He’ll soon square off against Ben Affleck’s Caped Crusader in next year’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. And in the meantime, he’s donning some slick ’60s duds for director Guy Ritchie’s big-screen adaptation of The Man from U.N.C.L.E., the adventures of two rival spies forced to work together to save the world.\n\n“I think The Man from U.N.C.L.E. would make an incredible franchise,” Cavill said on the phone from London. The precedent is surely there: Ritchie, who for a time was most famous for directing Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (as well as being Madonna’s ex-husband), has since turned Sherlock Holmes into a pair of blockbuster movies starring Robert Downey, Jr.\n\nCavill is hoping lightning strikes again with The Man from U.N.C.L.E., in which he plays slick American spy Napoleon Solo opposite Armie Hammer (The Social Network, The Lone Ranger) as ruthless Soviet agent Illya Kuryakin.\n\nRather than updating the movie for modern audiences, Ritchie chose to set The Man from U.N.C.L.E. in its original timeframe, the swinging Sixties during the height of the Cold War between the U.S. and the former Soviet Union. While the gadgetry might be a bit low-tech, the clothes, cars and settings are awesomely retro.\n\nBut the original TV show, which starred Robert Vaughn as Napoleon Solo and David McCallum as Illya Kuryakin, might not be familiar to anyone under the age of 40. That includes Cavill, who had never seen The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and went out of his way to avoid watching it after being cast.\n\nMobile users, please view here.\n\n“I wanted to create my own character, rather than just subconsciously copying someone else’s work. Guy (Ritchie) is very particular about his storytelling, and the fact that we’re building our own thing here.” Cavill said.\n\n“Even if you watch something with no intention of taking something, subconsciously you may end up doing something. And now I can say this Napoleon Solo is entirely the creation of myself and the team that worked on this movie.”\n\nCavill knows a thing or two about inhabiting the skin of famous fictional characters. He was the runner-up to play James Bond when the part ultimately went to Daniel Craig for 2006’s Casino Royale, and some speculate Cavill will be the logical replacement when Craig finally decides to hang up his Walther\n\nPPK. Has The Man From U.N.C.L.E. – originally created by 007 author Ian Fleming – scratched Cavill’s suave spy itch, or would he still be up for drinking a few shaken (not stirred) martinis?\n\n“That’s a question which I will only come to answer if it ever lands in my lap,” said a coy Cavill. “I mean, I can’t really answer it now because I can’t realistically think about it. The Man From U.N.C.L.E. – despite being written by the same author – the idea and the concept is just a very different thing to Bond. And if Bond comes around, then I’ll be able to answer that question.\n\n“I have had no talks about it so far, but we’ll see. We will see.”\n\nCavill is equally cagey about the Fifty Shades of Grey franchise. He’d been rumoured to be playing the role of Christian Grey in the original movie – something he denies was ever in the works – and there’s been tons of scuttlebutt suggesting he might play Jack Hyde in the upcoming sequel, Fifty Shades Darker.\n\n“I’ve had this question a few times and I’m really enjoying this answer, because it’s just fun: the answer is I can’t talk about that right now,” said Cavill. “That’s my answer. I can’t talk about it right now.” (Cavill has since suggested that he’s been leading people along with that response, since no one would believe his denials anyway. Sorry, ladies.)\n\nCavill is a little more forthcoming when it comes to Superman, the character he’ll likely end up playing through several more films, including a true Man of Steel sequel and the upcoming Justice League movies. Batman v Superman generated some significant buzz with a new trailer released at the recent San Diego Comic-Con, even if some less superhero-savvy folks (and those who’ve never read Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns) wonder how the heck Superman and Batman could come to blows. Like, wouldn’t Superman knock Bats into orbit with a single punch?\n\n“The idea with Superman is that it’s not that he can’t beat someone, it’s that he chooses to hold back,” said Cavill.\n\nHe wouldn’t be drawn out on how the rivalry (and the fisticuffs) between Superman and Ben Affleck’s Batman will play out when Batman v Superman hits theatres next March, but he doesn’t dispute the fact that DC and Warner Bros. are sticking to a darker, grittier flavour in their films, compared to the brighter, lighter fare coming from Marvel.\n\n“There’s definitely a difference, they’re at two opposite ends of the spectrum,” Cavill said. “It’s got to be different. I love it when all the Marvel movies do well, because it’s important. If people are liking superhero movies, then they’re going to like the movies that I’m in, too.”\n\nJust as there’s room in the world for Ian Fleming’s dark and dangerous James Bond alongside Ian Fleming’s glib and flippant Napoleon Solo, there’s room for two different types of superhero films.\n\n“I like telling this story, and I like these movies being out there, I enjoy all of them,” Cavill said. “And if they were the same, if we had the same type of tone and mood in DC movies as there are in Marvel movies, then it would get boring,” Cavill said.\n\n“Marvel is the opposite taste to DC and DC is the opposite taste to Marvel, and it’s great that they both exist. I think it’s fantastic.”\n\nINSIDE HENRY CAVILL’S WORLD OF WARCRAFT OBSESSION\n\nFantasy video games might seem like the domain of socially awkward basement-dwelling nerds, but that’s only if you believe outmoded, unfounded stereotypes. Here in 2015, anyone can be a diehard gamer. Even Superman himself.\n\nWhen Man of Steel director Zack Snyder originally called Henry Cavill to let the actor know he’d won the role of Superman in early 2011, Cavill didn’t pick up his phone. He was too busy playing World of Warcraft.\n\n“I’m a big PC gamer, for sure,” said Cavill, who frantically rang Snyder back after realizing the importance of the call he’d just ignored.\n\nA successful and ridiculously good-looking movie star might not seem like the typical demographic for an online role-playing game, which allows players from around the world to slay monsters and search for loot across a vast fantasy realm. But Cavill, who stars in this month’s The Man from U.N.C.L.E., is the real deal.\n\n“Last time I played I was a sword and board warrior, and I like doing sword and board stuff just because I loved PvP,” Cavill said. (Translated into English, that means he likes playing as a warrior with a one-handed weapon and a shield, because he enjoys player vs. player combat as opposed to just playing cooperatively alongside others.)\n\n“Even though it’s not an optimized class and spec, it’s fun because a lot of people who are optimized can’t necessarily deal with sword and board,” said Cavill, getting even more deliciously nerdy. “And so you just ruin their day.”\n\nThe insane career boost that came with Man of Steel means Cavill hasn’t played World of Warcraft for a long time. But he still games whenever he can – “I’ve been playing a lot of Total War lately,” he said, referring to the historical strategy game series – and he doesn’t let his schedule stand in the way.\n\n“You make time to do anything you want. And if I set time aside then that becomes my gaming time, and everyone else can keep on calling me and keep on getting ignored,” Cavill said.\n\n“And then eventually I will pick up and call people back.”\n\nTwitter: @stevetilley\n\nsteve.tilley@sunmedia.ca"
