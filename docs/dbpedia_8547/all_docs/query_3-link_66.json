        "text": "Has the Man of Steel joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe? A new rumor suggests Marvel Studios has cast former Superman actor Henry Cavill in a mystery role.\n\nHenry Cavill has become a veritable action icon over the past decade. Following his breakout role as Superman in Man of Steel, Cavill has become the face of multiple action blockbusters from The Witcher to Warhammer. Now, it seems the actor is ready to take on the MCU, with a new rumor from scooper MyTimeToShineHello suggesting that he’s accepted an offer from Marvel Studios (though not as Doctor Doom in The Fantastic Four reboot).\n\nThere’s certainly no shortage of characters that the actor could play. Many fans have floated the idea that Henry Cavill should play the MCU’s Captain Britain due to the actor’s country of origin. However, given Marvel Studios has announced its plans to scale back and focus on core IP characters, it’s not likely such an underrated hero would be making their big screen debut anytime in the near future.\n\nAnother popular fancast is Hyperion, or any other Marvel-created Superman clone. While it’s perhaps a bit cheeky to cast Henry Cavill as a derivative character in the MCU, the actor has way too much star power for Marvel Studios to waste on a minor character for a joke. Though given the Squadron Supreme was rumored for Loki season 2, it does have some merit.\n\nFinally, some fans speculate that Henry Cavill could be the new face of the X-Men. While it’s likely Marvel Studios would want younger actors to play the leads in a potential MCU reboot of the franchise, X-Men fans have been photoshopping Cavill as Cyclops, Wolverine and Beast since he was cast as Superman.\n\nUltimately, it’s impossible to know what role Marvel Studios has in store for Henry Cavill if he has indeed been cast in the MCU. Given the actor is one of the hottest names in Hollywood right now, it’s certain there’s something good up their sleeves!"
