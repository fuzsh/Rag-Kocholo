        "text": "\"Actor's Watch\" focuses on watches worn by actors in movies, television, etc.\n\nFor the 142nd installment, we will be looking at Henry Cavill's watch .\n\nIn 2005, Henry Cavill, then 22 years old, made it to the final audition for the role of James Bond, but was sadly rejected as he was \" too young for the role . As a result, Daniel Craig , then 37 years old, won the role and became popular as the longest-serving Bond actor in history, as movie fans will know.\n\n*Source: https://deadline.com/\n\nAlthough he didn't get the role of Bond, he continued to pursue his acting career while working as a model for famous brands. He eventually landed the role of Superman in the Hollywood blockbuster \" Man of Steel \" (2013), and continued to play the same role in \" Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice \" (2016) and \" Justice League \" (2017), which quickly gained him more fans and made him a star actor.\n\nThis time, we would like to take a closer look at the watch he wore in the movie.\n\nCodename: UNCLE\n\nThe Man from UNCLE (2015)\n\n*Source: https://www.vanityfair.com/\n\nIn the 1960s, in the midst of the Cold War, a genius scientist specializing in nuclear development goes missing. The CIA and the KGB, suspecting that a mysterious international criminal organization plotting to spread nuclear weapons is behind the incident, decide to overcome their longstanding conflict and join forces to solve the case.\n\nThe two men selected for the joint operation to search for the scientist are Napoleon Solo ( Henry Cavill ), a former criminal and womanizer with excellent behavioral psychology analysis and situational judgment, and Illya Kuryakin ( Armie Hammer ), a KGB officer with a strict but high fighting ability. Both are known as notorious spies. The two, who have completely different ways of thinking and investigative methods, head for Rome, which is considered to be the headquarters of an international crime organization, together with the scientist's daughter Gabriella ( Alicia Vikander ).\n\n*Source: https://bamfstyle.com/\n\nThe American spy drama \" Napoleon Solo \" (1960-1970) was popular all over the world in the 1960s. In the remake \" The Man from UNCLE \" (2015), which was stylishly produced using the latest film technology while keeping the historical background and fashion intact, Henry Cavill plays the lead role of Napoleon Solo, a CIA agent with a weakness for women.\n\nThe watch he wears in this film is a vintage Omega De Ville Chronograph (Ref. BA 141.0009) to match the setting of the film. This choice seems to be a tribute to Robert Vaughn, who played Napoleon Solo in the 1960s TV series, who also wore an Omega watch.\n\nSuspect - Madness on Thin Ice\n\nNIGHT HUNTER (2018)\n\n*Source: https://www.ign.com/\n\nThe body of a young woman is found in the back of a truck transporting lumber. Investigator Marshall ( Henry Cavill ), who investigated the scene, deduces that the woman, who was being chased by someone, jumped off a bridge and fell into the back of the moving truck, dying. At the same time, Lara, the adopted daughter of former judge Cooper ( Ben Kingsley ), is kidnapped by someone. However, a beacon she was wearing reveals that she is being held captive in a mansion on the outskirts of town. The police who raided the mansion arrest the man believed to be the culprit, Simon ( Brendan Fletcher ), and rescue several young women along with Lara. The body found in the back of the truck was also thought to be that of a woman who had attempted to escape from Simon.\n\nSimon is interrogated to solve the case, but he seems to have a mental disability, and no matter what he is asked, he just behaves like a child, so the investigation doesn't progress at all. Meanwhile, another incident occurs. Is Simon really the culprit?\n\n*Source: https://m.imdb.com/\n\nThe suspense film \" Suspect - Madness on Thin Ice \" (2018) depicts an investigator investigating a series of female abuse cases that occurred in a rural area of ​​Minnesota. Henry Cavill plays a workaholic \"sloppy\" investigator who doesn't care about his family or appearance, while other award-winning actors such as Ben Kingsley and Stanley Tucci play supporting roles.\n\nThe watch he wears in the film is a Timex Expedition (Ref. T49997) , a quartz military watch that is inexpensive but highly visible and durable. It is an extremely casual watch that is attached and removed with a Velcro fastener instead of a clasp or buckle. This further emphasizes the character of Marshall, a workaholic agent who doesn't want to think about anything other than work.\n\nMission: Impossible - Fallout\n\nMISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – FALLOUT (2018)\n\n*Source: https://www.netflixjunkie.com/\n\nIMF agent Ethan Hunt ( Tom Cruise ) heads out to a gang to recover stolen plutonium. However, the site of the transaction is attacked by a terrorist organization called \"God's Disciples,\" and the plutonium is stolen from Ethan. The goal of \"God's Disciples\" is to use the stolen plutonium to carry out simultaneous nuclear bombings in three cities.\n\nEthan, who is pursuing the \"Messenger of God,\" gets information that an arms dealer is trying to sell plutonium to a man named John Lark, and infiltrates a nightclub in Paris where the two are in contact. However, the CIA director is suspicious of Ethan's actions and assigns CIA agent Walker ( Henry Cavill ) to accompany him as a supervisor. Ethan succeeds in making contact with the arms dealer, but in exchange for handing over the plutonium, he is asked to hand over a terrorist...\n\n*Source: https://www.pinterest.com\n\n\"Mission : Impossible - Fallout \" (2018) is the sixth installment of the popular spy action series \" Mission: Impossible \" produced and starring Tom Cruise . Henry Cavill plays \"Walker\", a CIA agent sent to watch over Ethan Hunt, but his true identity is...\n\nThe watch he wears in the film is the Suunto Spartan Sports Wrist HR (Ref. SS023310000) . Suunto, a Finnish compass manufacturer with over 80 years of history, is now known as a leading manufacturer of outdoor watches. In this film, Henry Cavill performs more intense action scenes than Tom Cruise, so it would be hard to imagine him being able to wear anything less than a sturdy watch.\n\nsummary\n\nWhat did you think.\n\nAlthough he is a cool and handsome man, he is also able to wear not only dress watches that go well with a suit, but also military and outdoor watches that can withstand intense action in a sexy way, which is something that only former model Henry Cavill can do.\n\n*Source: https://www.independent.co.uk/\n\nHenry Cavill gained popularity for his role as Superman in \" Man of Steel ,\" but he has announced on his own social media account that \" my time wearing the cape is over, \" and it seems that he has unfortunately stepped down from the role of Superman. However, I personally think that the fact that he was able to graduate before the image of \"Superman actor\" was fully established is actually a positive thing for him in terms of playing other roles.\n\nHenry Cavill has proven that he is capable of playing complicated characters such as the tough detective in \" Suspects .\" Even if he loses the role of Bond or is dropped from the role of Superman, he is no longer the kind of weak actor whose career will be tarnished by such things.\n\nWe look forward to seeing what watch Henry Cavill, the Man of Steel, who wears any watch with style, will wear in his next film.\n\nsee you!"
