        "text": "What stands out most in the new spy comedy/thriller “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.”?\n\nThe international intrigue?\n\nThe chase sequences?\n\nThe romance?\n\nThe banter?\n\nNope, nope, nope and nope.\n\nIt’s the way actor Henry Cavill, who played Superman in 2013’s “Man of Steel,” delivers his lines as Napoleon Solo.\n\nIf you’re familiar with the 1960s TV spy series on which this movie is based, you know that Solo is an American spy who teams up with a Russian Illya Kuryakin. (And if you’re not familiar with the show, you know now.) In the show, Solo (Robert Vaughn) and Kuryakin (David McCallum) were agents for the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement (yep, U.N.C.L.E). In the movie, directed and co-written by Guy Ritchie (“Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,” “Snatch”), set during the Kennedy administration and more of an origin story, Solo is a thief-turned-CIA-agent and Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) is KGB, and they’re brought together for a common goal.\n\nBut back to Cavill’s delivery. It’s fascinating. He’s playing Solo as the epitome of sophistication and cool, and in doing so, he drains the character of everything but sophistication and cool — and you can hear it in his voice. When he talks, it’s in a hipper-than-thou monotone that would be perfect for the voiceover of a TV ad pitching some luxury item. There’s no personality, no humanity. Just “sophistication.” Just “cool.”\n\nSolo’s soullessness reflects the movie as a whole. It’s mildly witty, mildly entertaining without ever coming to life. It seems more an exercise in classic-TV-show adaptation than something that stands on its own.\n\nIt has some virtues. Alicia Vikander, the Swedish actress who’s had a powerful impact in “Ex Machina” and “Testament of Youth,” plays an East German who works with the good guys, and she’s appealing. And Hammer is amusing when showing Kuryakin fighting a losing battle in controlling his temper and proclivity for violence. But Vikander and Hammer, whose characters are supposed to be attracted to each other, fail to conjure up any romantic sparks. Like “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,” they just sort of go through the motions.\n\nWhat: “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.”\n\nStar rating: **½\n\nStarring: Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer, Alicia Vikander and Hugh Grant\n\nDirected by: Guy Ritchie\n\nWritten by: Ritchie and Lionel Wigram\n\nBased on: the television series by Sam Rolfe\n\nRunning time: 116 minutes\n\nRating: PG-13 (for action violence, some suggestive content and partial nudity)\n\nWhere: Flagship Cinemas New Bedford, AMC Dartmouth Mall 11, Flagship Cinemas Wareham\n\nNow Showing"
