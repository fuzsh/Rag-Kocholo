        "text": "He was not cast as James Bond, nor Batman, though he auditioned for both. But British actor Henry Cavill has finally found his perfect fit of a world-saving hero: he's been cast as Superman in Zack Snyder's forthcoming take on the Man of Steel.\n\nThe 27-year-old actor is best known for his role in the US TV show The Tudors, in which he plays Charles Brandon, confidante to Jonathan Rhys Meyers's Henry VIII. He will begin filming on the Warner Brothers film at Vancouver film studios in Canada this summer, ahead of a December 2012 release.\n\nThe actor's appointment means that all three of the major big screen superhero series feature actors with British roots in the lead role. Christian Bale, who was born in Haverfordwest in Wales, is set to reprise his role as Batman in a third film for Christopher Nolan, who is also producing Superman, while Surrey-raised Andrew Garfield has signed on to play Spider-Man in Marc Webb's forthcoming series reboot.\n\nCavill auditioned for the role of Batman before losing out to Bale for the 2005 film, and was also reportedly up for James Bond prior to Daniel Craig's appointment for 2006's Casino Royale. He was also in the running to play Superman and his alter ego Clark Kent prior to Bryan Singer's 2006 venture Superman Returns, with Brandon Routh eventually winning the role. For good measure, Cavill was at one point the first choice of studio executives to play the role of Edward Cullen in vampire romance series Twilight, eventually losing out to Robert Pattinson.\n\nA studio insider told the Wrap that the Jersey-born actor had impressed Nolan during the casting process and won the role following a screen test. The new Superman film is being written by Nolan and David S Goyer, who together penned both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight (the latter with Nolan's brother Jonathan). Snyder, director of 300 and Watchmen, signed on in October.\n\n\"In the pantheon of superheroes, Superman is the most recognised and revered character of all time, and I am honoured to be a part of his return to the big screen,\" Snyder said. \"I also join Warner Bros, Legendary and the producers in saying how excited we are about the casting of Henry. He is the perfect choice to don the cape and 'S' shield.\"\n\nBefore he hits the big screen in Superman, Cavill will first be seen in the swords-and-sandals epic The Immortals for director Tarsem Singh, in which he will play the role of Greek warrior Theseus."
