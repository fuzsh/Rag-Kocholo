This is going to be an action-packed movie that is both intellectually stimulating and physically exhilarating.\"\n\nRelated: Why Henry Cavill isn't returning as Superman\n\nThe project is the latest in a long line for Cavill following his departure as Superman at the end of last year, with the actor spearheading an adaptation of the Warhammer video-game series.\n\n\"For 30 years I have dreamt of seeing a Warhammer universe in live action. Now, after 22 years of experience in this industry, I finally feel that I have the skill set and experience to guide a Warhammer Cinematic Universe into life,\" he said when announcing the television series.\n\n\"Having a home like Amazon will give us the freedom to be true to the massive scope of Warhammer,\" he added. \"To all of you Warhammer fans out there, I promise to respect this IP that we love. I promise to bring you something familiar. And I endeavour to bring you something fantastic that is, as of yet, unseen.\""
