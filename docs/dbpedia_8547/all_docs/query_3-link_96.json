        "text": "When you look as though you were designed by German engineers to make the planet’s men feel inferior about their physiques, how do you go about humanizing yourself to the masses? If you’re Henry Cavill, the chiseled human specimen playing Superman in the upcoming DC Comics feature Man of Steel, you do so by sitting down for a magazine profile, as the British actor did recently forDetails.\n\nIn the cover story, available in full here, Cavill lets down his muscle-bound guard to show that he is a modest 30-year-old with arguably geeky hobbies, embarrassing childhood nicknames, and a fondness for fried foods, just like the rest of us. Below, the most humanizing revelations about the Man of Steelstar:\n\nWhether or not you believe it, Cavill claims that he was a hefty child.\n\n“I was fat,” he says. “I was Fat Cavill.” Later in the story, Cavill reveals that it was not until he got a role in an adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo at age 17 that he lost 21 pounds and “wasn’t Fat Cavill anymore.”\n\nHe seems to be a homebody.\n\n“I’m not much of a schmoozer,” he tells Detailsas he walks to a restaurant 30 miles away from Burbank. He adds that he is “not much of an eventgoer. I’d rather stay close to here. This doesn’t feel like L.A. It doesn’t feel like work.”\n\nHe modestly cops to Hollywood rejections.\n\nThe other tentpole that eluded Cavill: “I screen-tested for James Bond when I was 22,” he says. “But Daniel [Craig] was above and beyond the best choice.”\n\nHe has geeky hobbies.\n\nWhile shooting the sex-soaked period drama [Showtime’s The Tudors] in Dublin from 2007 through 2010, Cavill spent his downtime buried in Robert Jordan’s fantasy series Wheel of Time. “The books are about the rise of a chosen one with great powers,” Cavill says. “I’d stay up until five, six in the morning reading. I couldn’t put them down.”\n\nHe has more geeky hobbies.\n\n“When I found out I got the [Man of Steel] part,” he says, “I was home playingWorld of Warcraft. Zack called, and I thought he was calling to let me down easy. But then it dawned on me that he was giving me the part. I had to play it cool.\n\nHe prefers deep-fried food over healthy menu alternatives.\n\n“If you’re looking for healthy, the mahimahi is good with the spinach and the steamed broccoli,” he says. “But I keep wanting to get the fish and chips. . . . I’m going for the fish and chips.”\n\nHe was not immune to emotional weakness as a youth.\n\nAt boarding school, Cavill was prone to homesickness. “I bawled on the phone to my mom four times a day,” he says. “I became an easy target.” Being Fat Cavill didn’t exactly boost the boy’s self-esteem, but it did help him form an early understanding of his breakout character’s inner life. “My version of Superman,” he says, “is essentially of a guy who has spent his whole life alone.”\n\nBefore he was famous, he had a fan moment with a famous actor.\n\nThe other touchstone moment at boarding school involved Russell Crowe, who plays Cavill’s father, Jor-El, in Man of Steel. “He was on campus filming Proof of Life,” Cavill says. “Everyone was standing in a semicircle, and I thought, ‘We look ridiculous, staring like he’s some kind of prize pony.’ So I walked up and said, ‘Hi, my name is Henry. I’m thinking of becoming an actor. What’s the acting world like?’ He said something like, ‘Sometimes it’s great. Sometimes it’s not so great. It’s fun acting. And they pay well.’”\n\nRelated photos:Henry Cavill and the Other Stars of Bruce Weber’s Hollywood Portfolio\n\nHollywood\n\nThe Real Reason Matt Damon Loves Working With Casey Affleck\n\n“You need to get every idea out,” says the star of The Instigators, in a joint interview with Affleck. “You get there a lot faster if you’re not worried about people’s feelings. So, in other words, we talk a lot of shit to each other.”\n\nPolitics\n\nThe Woman Who Engineered Donald Trump’s Rise From the Ashes of 2020\n\nIn an excerpt of Trump in Exile, Meridith McGraw reveals how the former president was overwhelmed by the dysfunction his election loss brought upon Mar-a-Lago—until Susie Wiles took the wheel of his comeback campaign. “I don’t know who’s in charge,” he told Wiles. “I need you to fix it.”\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon’s Ewan Mitchell Is Channeling Tony Soprano and Robert De Niro\n\nMitchell, who plays the one-eyed Prince Aemond, drops by Still Watching to chat about his character’s motivations and surprising vulnerability.\n\nTelevision\n\nIn The Day of the Jackal, Eddie Redmayne’s Shape-Shifting Assassin Meets His Match\n\nLashana Lynch faces off against Redmayne in Peacock’s bold reimagining of the classic cat-and-mouse novel, a thrilling escape with unsettling political parallels.\n\nHollywood\n\nUnstoppable Tackles the Inspiring True Story of a One-Legged Wrestling Champion\n\nThe crowd-pleasing sports drama starring Jharrel Jerome and Jennifer Lopez will have its world premiere at the Toronto Film Festival.\n\nHollywood\n\nThe Universe According to Geraldine Viswanathan\n\nAfter breaking out in Blockers, the actor has continued to shoot for the stars, soaring toward her biggest year yet with a Will Ferrell–Reese Witherspoon comedy and a new role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nAward Season\n\nHow Ripley Changed Dakota Fanning: “If I Can Do That, I Can Do Anything”\n\nAfter nearly 25 years onscreen, Fanning just received her first Emmy nomination for the Netflix series. She tells Vanity Fair why it represents her next chapter in Hollywood: “People feel like they know me, but then they also don’t.”\n\nRoyals\n\nPrince Harry Says Meghan Markle Isn’t Safe in the UK: “All It Takes Is One Lone Actor”\n\nIn a recent interview about his ongoing legal battles against a handful of British tabloids, the prince said the danger is that it only takes “one person who reads this stuff to act on what they have read.”\n\nHollywood\n\nThe Dark Questions Netflix’s Lou Pearlman Doc Dirty Pop Doesn’t Answer\n\nThe new docuseries rehashes Pearlman’s audacious Ponzi scheme and impact on ’90s pop culture while glossing over the darker allegations that shadowed the late boy-band manager.\n\nAward Season\n\nBaby Reindeer’s Jessica Gunning Never Saw Martha as a Villain\n\n“She’s so much more than that,” says the newly minted Emmy nominee of her breakout role in the Netflix hit series."
