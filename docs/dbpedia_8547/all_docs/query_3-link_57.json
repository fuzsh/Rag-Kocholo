        "text": "Henry Cavill (b. 5 May 1983) is a British actor who portrayed Geralt of Rivia in Netflix's The Witcher from seasons 1-3.[1] He is a self professed \"witcher-nerd\", having read the books and played all the games twice, which helped him get the role.\n\nHe later stepped down from playing as Geralt, with Liam Hemsworth taking over in season 4.[1]\n\nMajor works[]\n\nMan of Steel (2013) - as Superman\n\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) - as Superman\n\nJustice League (2017) - as Superman\n\nMission Impossible - Fallout (2018) - as August Walker/John Lark\n\nTrivia[]\n\nCavill is known to be an avid gamer to the point he missed a phone call asking him to play Superman because he was too busy playing World of Warcraft.\n\nWhen asked who he chooses, Triss or Yennefer, Cavill notes when he played the games, and especially after reading the books, he feels at Geralt's core it's Yennefer and even when he can choose in the games, Cavill always goes for Yennefer.[2]\n\nVideos[]"
