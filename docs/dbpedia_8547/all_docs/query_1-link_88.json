        "text": "Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer have been spotted together for the first time while on set for their new film The Man From U.N.C.L.E. in Rome.\n\nCavill was spotted a couple of weeks ago looking very dapper in a two piece suit and vintage briefcase while filming some night scenes in Pozzuoli, Italy, but Hammer was nowhere to be found.\n\nNow we have images of both hunks, who play rival spies that come together to fight the threats from the organization U.N.C.L.E.\n\nThe film, directed by Guy Ritchie (Sherlock Holmes) is a reboot of the successful sixties television series in which Robert Vaughn and David McCallum played Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin respectively.\n\nSolo, the CIA agent will be portrayed by Henry Cavill this time around, while Kuryakin, a KGB spy is played by Armie Hammer.\n\nHenry Cavill is coming from his success as the new Superman in Zack Snyder’s film Man Of Steel, while Hammer hasn’t been as lucky and is looking to redeem himself from the flop that was The Lone Ranger.\n\nThe pair is getting a lot of attention from fans who have come to watch the shoot in the streets of Rome. Cavill was spotted doing some sightseeing while in the ancient city and also took time to greet fans, snapping some photos and signing autographs.\n\nIt is not certain when Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer will be seen in The Man From U.N.C.L.E., no release date has been announced as of yet. Stay tuned for more updates."
