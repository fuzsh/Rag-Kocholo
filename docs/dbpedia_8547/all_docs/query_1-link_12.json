        "text": "How do you convert a television show to the movie screen? It is a conundrum that has plagued movie studios for decades now. For every Mission: Impossible, The Fugitive or 21 Jump Street -- movies that figure out how to extend the premise of the original program – there are far too many I Spy, Land of the Lost or Entourage adaptations out there. It’s a tricky line to balance, and one that many are going to try and figure out because TV shows will continue to inspire movies – and vice versa.\n\nOne of the latest attempts at reviving the past reaches theaters on August 14. Guy Ritchie, who recently energized Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes, is applying his dry wit and stylish visuals to the 1960s Cold War spy series The Man From U.N.C.L.E., except instead of modernizing the story, he’s sending 2015 audiences into the past. Henry Cavill (Man of Steel), Armie Hammer (The Lone Ranger) and Alicia Vikander (Ex Machina) are adding sex appeal and gritty humor to the spy genre, turning the time-tested subsection of action thrillers on its head.\n\nOn a frigid day in 2014, I was lucky enough to join a handful of film journalists on the London set of Guy Ritchie’s The Man From U.N.C.L.E. to interview the cast and crew, watch them film scenes, and get a general sense of how they plan to recreate this sliver of Cold War history. Here, then, are the five most interesting things I found out!\n\nThe Stars’ Inspiration Is Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\n\nWhile it’s true that Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer are playing classic Man From U.N.C.L.E. partners Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin, respectively, we heard from numerous people on set that the vobe the duo keeps giving off mirrors that of Robert Redford and Paul Newman in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. You can pick this up in the banter they have in the most recent trailer (above), as well as in the first tease, which Warner Bros. released a few months back. Ritchie, in particular, talked to us at length about trying to find a tone that resembled Butch Cassidy, even while admitting that audiences initially dismissed George Roy Hill’s 1969 classic because it was a \"comedy.\" Ritchie told us:\n\nSimilar to how Ritchie feels Butch Cassidy changed the idea of a Western, he’s hoping U.N.C.L.E. can alter the idea of a secret agent movie. But how? Let’s keep exploring.\n\nObviously, James Bond Is An Influence For U.N.C.L.E.\n\nIt’s very hard to talk about the 1960s, the Cold War, handsome spies and beautiful double agents without thinking about 007 (and, yes, Austin Powers). And instead of shunning the comparison, the team behind Man from U.N.C.L.E. embraced it. When we interviewed Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer, they admitted that they get \"plenty of gadgets\" to play with, though Cavill quickly pointed out that Hammer’s KGB agent is far more tech savvy than his Napoleon Solo.\n\nWhen we spoke to producer Lionel Wigram about their approach to the material, he referenced Bond, the novels of John Le Carre, as well as Guy Ritchie’s Sherlock, as the balance they are trying to achieve. Wigram told us that the villain of the film isn’t THRUSH (which was the thrust of the television show, and a clone of SMERSH). But he said of the tone of U.N.C.L.E.:\n\nThat means action, right? Let’s get in to some of the film’s major set pieces, and its practical effects.\n\nThe Film’s ‘Big Set’ Will Be An Actual Underground Lair\n\nThere were four major interiors that we toured as part of the set visit, and through these trips, we learned that Guy Ritchie was creating the 1960s, on every level, and not cheating through the use of green screen. We walked through the hallways and tunnels of an Italian castle (rebuilt on a soundstage outside of London). We stood on the bridge of an airplane carrier, pushing the buttons and turning the knobs of the actual control panels! And we visited the film’s benchmark set – an underground lab, where a massive bomb is being built.\n\nIn helping to sell the size and scope of this fun summer romp, Armie Hammer told us:\n\nBut by physically recreating the time period, it helped the actors get (and stay) in character. Everyone we spoke to praised the work of costume designer Joanna Johnston, a frequent collaborator of Steven Spielberg who dressed characters in Saving Private Ryan, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, War Horse and Lincoln, to name just a few. Of her contributions, Hammer raved:\n\nBut is it faithful to the TV show? Keep reading!\n\nYeah, The Cast Didn’t Really Grow Up On The TV Show\n\nThough Ritchie and Wigram talked about how the show was a favorite growing up, Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer and Alicia Vikander were really open about not being up-to-date on the original TV series. Vikander said she watched \"a couple of episodes\" and was aware of the property. It was a bigger deal to her father back home in Sweden when he heard that they were remaking the movie, and that his daughter would be a part of it.\n\nHammer said that after he landed the role of Illya Kuryakin, he rented the series on DVD to \"see what all the fuss was about.\" Cavill said he never did, telling us:\n\nWhen we asked him if he ever went back and checked out old episodes, he said he hadn’t. Probably too busy brushing up on Superman comic books.\n\nThis Will Be A Guy Ritchie Action Picture, Through And Through\n\nYes, there will be humor. And yes, this is a period film, with elaborate costumes and sets that recreate luxurious, globetrotting locales of the 1960s. \"We’ve been on speed boats together,\" said Hammer. \"I’ve been on the back of [Cavill’s] Vespa, riding around Rome.\" But the draw of The Man from UNCLE, for both the cast and for the audience, is the approach Guy Ritchie has to all source material, which was on display in movies like Lock, Stock, Snatch, Revolver, RockNRolla and, most recently, the two Sherlock Holmes movies.\n\nSaid Henry Cavill:\n\nEven though the director admitted to us that secret agents aren’t his bag. So he had to look at them differently, through his own unique lens. Said Ritchie:"
