Of these he spins Relation out, he weaves its fabric up So that it speaks darkly, as music does Singing the secret history of the mind. And when in this the visible world appears, And it does do, mountain, flower, cloud, and tree, All haunted here and there with the human face, It happens as by accident, although The accident is of design. It is because Language first rises from the speechless world That the painterly intelligence Can say correctly that he makes his world, Not imitates the one before his eyes. Hence the delightsome gardens, the dark shore, The terrifying forests where nightfall Enfolds a lost and tired traveler. And hence the careless crowd deludes itself By likening his hieroglyphic signs And secret alphabets to the drawings of a child. That likeness is significant the other side\n\nOf what they see, for his simplicities Are not the first ones, but the furthest ones, final refinements of his thought made visible. He is the painter of the human mind Finding and faithfully reflecting the mindfulness That is in things, and not the things themselves. For such a man, art is an act of faith: Prayer the study of it, as Blake says, And praise the practice; nor does he divide Making from teaching or from theory. The three are one, and in his house of art There shines a happiness through darkest themes, As though spirit and sense were not at odds.\n\nvi\n\nHis dream an emblem to us of the life of thought, The same dream that then flared before intelligence When light first went forth looking for the eye.

Mitchell for the School of Criticism and Theory held at Dartmouth College in the summer of 1990. Besides losing many a tennis match to Professor Mitchell, conversations with him and fellow classmates Mario Klarer and Enric Sulla helped shape my thinking on word and image relations. So too am I grateful to the many participants in my yearly Word and Image sessions at the American Association for Italian Studies conventions. I have profited greatly from their expertise and enthusiasm. I would like to think that the final result is a compilation of these moments that sheds some light not only on specific issues related to the work of Italo Calvino but on larger matters of word and image relations as well. Having spent many years on this still continuing project, I have a large number of people to thank. I would like to express my gratitude to those most directly involved. To my friends Marco Belpoliti, Salvino Bizzarre, Maria Jose Calvo Montoro, Rocco Capozzi, Andrea Dini, Joseph Francese, Glenn Pierce, Jose Ruano della Haza, Anthony J. Tamburri, Beno Weiss, from whom I have learned much. To my unknown peer reviewers, whose comments and suggestions helped crystalize my thinking in several important areas. Special thanks to the Humanities and Social Sciences Federation of Canada Aid to Scholarly Publications Programme and to the editors of the Modern Language Review for permission to reprint a revised version of 'De Chirico City: Calvinian Ambulations.' Heartfelt gratitude to Vida Abedi, whose patience and precision helped forge the final manuscript. The late Gian Paolo Biasin read the manuscript and was eminently\n\nx Preface\n\nand unforgettably generous with advice and encouragement. His approval was especially gratifying. Above all I thank my wife, Hoda Eid, for her sustaining encouragement. She is my image of eidos, an intellectual presence felt in each eidolon; I also thank Alessandro, my son, my new eikon of knowledge.

This fantastic iconology has become my habitual way of expressing my love of painting. I have adopted the method of telling my own stories, starting from pictures famous in the history of art or at any rate pictures that have made an impact on me. Italo Calvino1\n\nIn a letter to Francois Wahl dated 1 December I960, Calvino thanks Wahl for the kind words expressed on his behalf. After praising his friend's critical acumen - 'E' la prima volta che ho la soddisfazione d'avere una definizione critica cosi' intelligente e completa' (This is the first time that I have the satisfaction of receiving such an intelligent and complete critique') - the author gives reasons for his satisfaction: 'perche e la prima volta che si analizza il mio modo di immaginare e costruire una storia' ('because it is the first time that my method for imagining and constructing a story is analysed'). He then states: Insomma, quello cui io tendo, Tunica cosa che vorrei poter insegnare e un modo di guardare cioe di essere in mezzo al mondo. In fondo la letteratura non puo insegnare altro. In short, my aim, the only thing that I would wish to teach is a way of seeing, a way, that is, to be in the world. In essence, literature cannot teach anything else.2\n\n4 Painting with Words, Writing with Pictures\n\nThis is one of the first of many statements Calvino would make regarding the visual propensity of his narrative imagination, in which he locates the art of looking as central to his poetics of writing. Typically, the candid observation is made privately and to a friend. When read with other, similar statements it is easy to deduce that the author's selfproclaimed 'punto di partenza sia I'immagine' ('point of departure is the image'), an image seen up close - scrutinized - and that his narrative act 'svilupppi una logica' ('develops a logic') that is 'interna deU'immagine stessa' (350; 'inside the image itself). However, what I find most compelling in this private correspondence is the author's attitude towards the lack of any real action in his stories: Giustamente Lei osserva che questo processo logico portato alle ultime conseguenze a un certo punto si spegne e annulla in un terzo momento: quello della contemplazione. (350) You correctly observe that this logical process, taken to its ultimate consequences, at a certain point is extinguished and nullifies itself in a third moment: that of contemplation.\n\nTaking the argument beyond the simple notion of looking at things to be written about, the author juxtaposes two eternally opposite creative impulses: he is exasperated at the lack of temporal flow in his narrative, yet exhilarated by the notion of narrative space, of tranquil contemplation. These counter-tendencies suggest a sense of uneasiness, of irresolution, of incompleteness that, like the cloven viscount, the protagonist of // visconte dimezzato (1952), divides the author between active storytelling with action characters and a self-effacing, psychological predisposition towards inactive prose, a style more in tune with his visual 'rapporto verso il mondo' ('relation with the world'). Although he claims to have suspected a dormant love of action ('ho sempre pensato d'amare 1'azione, la pratica'; T always thought I loved action, experience'), Calvino admits, 'di fatto non sono un uomo d'azione istintivamente, ma solo per volonta e spinta razionale' ('in fact I am not a man of action by instinct, but only by volition and rational thrust'). Sounding very much like a divided viscount finally accepting and acknowledging a 'shortcoming' in his narrative ('1'azione costituisce sempre per me un problema'; 'for me, action always constitutes a problem') Calvino again praises the critic for his perspicacity:\n\nIntroduction 5 scoprire che i miei racconti hanno tutti questo problema dell'agitazione inutile e dell'azione reale, e per me una acquisizione preziosa. (350) to discover that all my short stories share this problem of useless agitation and real action, is for me a valuable acquisition.\n\nBut how sincere is this disclosure? The year is 1960. The letter to Wahl postdates the Note attached to the heraldic trilogy 7 nostri antenati (1960; Our Ancestors) by six months.3 In this Note the author had already publicly revealed the inspirational font for his stories in the often-quoted phrase, 'All'origine di ogni storia che ho scritto c'e un'immagine che mi gira per la testa, nata chissa come e che mi porto dietro magari per anni' (354; 'At the origin of every story I have written there is an image that revolves in my head, born who knows how and that I carry with me even for years'). He had, in short, already admitted the need for a spatial fix. Is the author tipping his hand to a friend, characteristically reprising a motif that adumbrates the heart of his literary enterprise? Is he signalling a new-found well of personal and professional vigour? Was he wondering, in private, to a friend capable of rendering the news public, if anyone was listening? The Note, like the collection of essays Una pietra sopra (1980), was published at an important moment and marks the beginning of a transitional phase (1960-7) in the author's career. The letter to Wahl consolidates the moment. It signals, to those able to follow the traces, a turn in inspirational fonts and creative spirits. No longer willing to search, to quote Wolfgang Iser, for 'the simultaneity of the mutually exclusive/4 Calvino now gives in to his ekphrastic impulse, despite its inevitably paradoxical consequences. The Note continues with a telling description of his working method: A poco a poco mi viene da sviluppare questa immagine in una storia con un principio e una fine, e nello stesso tempo - ma i due processi sono spesso paralleli e indipendenti - mi convince che essa racchiude qualche significato. (354) Slowly I begin to develop this image into a story with a beginning and an end, and at the same time - but the two processes are often parallel and independent - I convince myself that it holds some significance.\n\nIn other words, the spatial image that pervades his imagination is\n\n6 Painting with Words, Writing with Pictures\n\neventually translated into a temporal sequence, the eidolon into a story. An all-encompassing and seemingly inexhaustible paradigmatic space is constricted to the syntactic requisites of finite temporal verbs. The bemoaned inaction that Wahl espies and that so paralyses the author is energized into effective action during the act of writing - 'E' solo scrivendo che ogni cosa finisce per andare al suo posto' (354; 'It is only through writing that everything winds up in its place') - but is never, and cannot be translated into a story. Although the passive image is transformed into an active word sequence, inaction remains inactivity, visual space is translated into contemplation. In other words, any action Calvino attempts to narrate has the habit of freezing itself within a spatial frame. Calvino closes his comments to his friend Wahl with the following sentence: 'II suo discorso potrebbe essere ampliato in un vasto saggio' (354; 'Your argument could be broadened into a lengthy essay'). The present study intends to do just that and proceeds on two basic premises. It postulates first that Calvino's narrative is generated by an imagocentric program and, second, that the nature of Calvino's literary proposals is ekphrastic. These tendencies must, however, contend with the arbitrary and sightless nature of the writing experience. Language belies the transiency of the creative moment and tends to thwart the dream of corporeal presence, because words cannot have capacity. They cannot, literally, contain space. Calvino's images are word bound and therefore affected by the representational means used to present their reality. I will thus examine not so much the function, place, or quality of images in the writings of Calvino but instead search for the grain of Calvino's thinking by assessing a primary facet of shared human thinking, perception; that act that transforms a perceived phenomenon into a description, a meditation, a story, a text. Calvino himself puts it succinctly when speaking of his fascination with the writing style of Lucretius. 'Cio che ci interessa,' he states, 'e il modo in cui... e descritta un'esperienza che pare semplicissima e che invece sfugge a chiunque voglia fissarla sulla pagina'5 (\"That which interests us is the manner in which ... an apparently simple experience is described when instead it eludes anyone who wishes to fix it on the page'). I am interested, then, in the difficult interface between word and image that Calvino struggled with throughout his career, and in the act of perception that rendered visible that which was invisible and transformed what was seen into what is read. To be sure, the notion that Calvino's literary enterprise is visual in\n\nIntroduction 7\n\ninspiration is not novel. Broached by many but never fully examined, the subject receives its most eloquent and extended statement to date in Marco Belpoliti's L'occhio di Calvino.6 An excellent study, Belpoliti presents a far-reaching overview of Calvino's visual tendencies with a subtending critical discourse that highlights the author's recurring imagery (the labyrinth, the net, the crystal, and the spiral, for example), his tendency to 'think with his eyes/ the irresistible urge to read the world as if it were an inexhaustible and seamless surface. Both our works benefit from conversations held during conferences in Italy and Spain, where our common interest in the nature of seeing in Calvino was discovered. Our studies are the result of an idea whose time had come. Yet, where Belpoliti is analytical, separating parts to better understand the whole, I am more synthetic, more systematic, and limit myself to assembling elements that form a snapshot of Calvino's narrative system from a visual perspective. Where Belpoliti ably uncovers the basic principles of visuality critically expressed by the author, I move from these principles to practical application. I wish to display Calvino's underlying visual tendency by presenting turnstile moments of ideological/thematic/methodological transition that reveal what Mieke Bal would call a mode of discourse that produces specific visual effects.7 Calvino's main effect is to be variably different from others in writing style but also visually different, both in the appearance of his works and in the visual images he imagines. Even within his own corpus of words the author constantly sought variety and difference. The term 'difference' is apropos because Calvino has always been considered different, an outsider; never really a communist, never a realist, never really a fantasist. An uneasily cornered 'scoiattolo' (squirrel) as it were, he shares the squirrel's tendency to live in high places (Calvino's apartments in Paris and Rome were always on the uppermost floor), the ability, therefore, to view things from above, the ultimate necessity (personal and professional) of benign aloofness, of salutatory distance ('Alle volte,' he stated in an interview, 'bisogna saper restare soli; e' 1'unico modo per far capire che le cose che contano non sono quelle/;8 'Sometimes one must remain alone; it is the only way to demonstrate what is truly important'). Calvino's enduring legacy is that though he was an ever-present cultural operator to be reckoned with, he never really entered the fray. While he expressed measured opinions with eloquent, if not terse, aplomb, he was also able to scurry with wonderfilled surefootedness amidst the most playful of ideas and notions. Yet Calvino has also expressed a certain monological constancy. There is\n\n8 Painting with Words, Writing with Pictures\n\nembedded within his discourse a propensity towards descriptive exercises. The exercises are always discursive; they are part of the cognitive process that Calvino calls writing. They are necessarily sensory in nature, incorporating all the senses but privileging the primary sense of vision. For Calvino, thinking began at the eye. The idea and indeed the inherent danger of recording visual experience is not new to culture. From Plato's Cratylus to Michael Ann Holly's Past Looking: Historical Imagination and the Rhetoric of the Image,9 the scope and aims of the two contending signifying systems, verbal as opposed to imagistic, have haunted attempts to imitate reality. The conflict over both the nature and careless use of words, icons, verbal images, metaphor, and metonymy has produced a swinging pendulum of logocentric versus imagocentric values. In our century, the classic accounts of Aristotle, Alberti, Leonardo, Burke, Lessing, and Panofsky have gained increasing currency as historians of systems of signification attempt to erase the traditional boundaries between the arts.10 Modern philosophers (the early Wittgenstein, Derrida), psychologists (Arnheim, Kennedy, Hagen), constructionists (Hochberg), iconologists (Gombrich), modern theorists (Goodman, Mitchell, Krieger), and art historians (Bryson, Holly) are investigating the corollaries between entrenched verbal and visual canons and contemporary conventions.11 Literary theorists have turned to Roland Barthes's multi-tracked and laterally connected arguments about textuality that display the complex symmetries and subversive complementarities of their aesthetic ideals.12 Calvino's propensity towards description may be interpreted as endorsing one of Barthes's principal theses, that the surface is always more telling than depth. His exaltation of Tightness,' 'quickness,' and Visibility' as ideals to be preserved for the next millennium recalls Nietzsche's panegyrics on spectacle and visibility. While genre theory has given preference to active narratives, that is, those narratives that assert action rather than description, in his work Calvino subverted this traditional power structure in favour of a discourse that privileges vision, description, and contemplation as a means of active intellectual involvement, what St Augustine called distension. Yet, by using these terms to characterize his writings we are led to the inevitable (and now characteristic) picture of the artist as a loner, a creator of inert protagonists, an author who passively watched the world as an ocular spectacle, never participating but always remaining off the socio-political map. This is the image that Calvino cultivated\n\nIntroduction 9 both in his private and public life. Such a view, however, tends to trivialize his art, leaving it on the margins of the social canvas. The reality is that Calvino understood voyeurism as both a contemporary malaise and a postmodern necessity. Calvino's ideas on the visual nature of language, combined with his use of scientific theory as a reliable touchstone for the creative process, have gained currency in contemporary theories of perception generated by developments in gender-related issues. Consideration of his love of paintings, then, is an essential key to making sense of Calvino's visual writing style. Calvino approached the world from a consistently perceptual or imagocentric vantage point. The juxtaposing of verbal images that inspire the visions his narratives portray often follows the same patterns that characterize representational art. Though critics often suggest in passing the possible influences of cartoon characters and fairy-tale images in Calvino's work, and may allude to the allencompassing, all-embracing outreach of the author's gathering vision, the truth is that issues of imaging, of what happens to thefabula of the world once it enters the Calvino story machine, are always considered from a thematic perspective or within ideological contextualizations that often become reductionist. No one has ever addressed the practical issues of imaging, perception, imagining, or representation.13 Calvino wrote a number of introductions to art catalogues, commented on art exhibitions, and published newspaper travelogues in which he described visits to museums and archeological sites. Often the author rearranged what he saw into playful voyages inside the artworks, essentially animating their visual signs with verbal narrative. Calvino was obviously interested in more than simply recording these memorable 'border crossings' (the terminology is Lessing's). Yet critics have either treated these writings as peripheral to his work as a serious artist or dismissed them altogether as para-literary games. Consider the amusing and meditative essays contained in Collezione di sabbia (1984). These are, to my mind, Calvino's port of call. This is a book of things: things, not events, that have been looked at and discerned; things examined and collated, things re-presented and re-invented and re-told. These things provide the stimulus for the author's imaginative act, the fabula of the author's intreccio. The essays effectively demonstrate Calvino's disposition towards the experience of looking. They provide an opportunity to observe how Calvino perceived the world while demonstrating how far he had come from // sentiero del nidi di ragno (1947; The Path to the Nest of Spiders). While writers continued to\n\n10 Painting with Words, Writing with Pictures\n\nlook for a story that created a possible reality, Calvino gripped reality itself. The world, the real world, was critical to his performance. By drawing objects closer to himself, he was able to shift focus from his audience to the thing itself. By understanding this ability to connect, visually, with the specific objects of his gaze we may better understand the intimate nature of his narrative. Moreover, we may be able to eventually uncover the visual sources, the art, that inspired Calvino's creative writing. But this could be the subject of another study. Active vision renders Collezione di sabbia a remarkable illustrated book of emblems, a list of costumes, interests, anatomical parts, and adventures that are captioned, so to speak, by Calvino's verbal aphorisms. Most of these pieces appeared in newspapers over a long period of time; none are subordinate to an overarching structure beyond a general classification that identifies them as impressionistic, visual reportage. As in his ruminations on paintings, however, these exercises free the author from the responsibility of inventing new possible narrative worlds and concentrate on those already extant. He merely needs to discover those that exist in what he sees. In an insightful review of Collezione di sabbia, Giorgio Ficara14 begins with two contrasting ideas regarding discovery. One is Petrarch's optimistic notion that the antipods are waiting to be discovered and that \"1 di' nostro vola / a gente che di la forse 1'aspetta' ('our day flies / towards people that perhaps await it there'). The other citation is from Leopardi. The poet laments novelty, deploring the futile attempt at attenuating Nature's malignity: 'E figurato e il mondo in breve carta; / Ecco tutto simile, e discoprendo, / solo il nulla s'accresce' ('The world is already imagined on brief papers; / Everything is similar, and discovering, / only the void increases'). The question for Calvino, however, is no longer whether voyages of discovery are legitimate, but whether, as Calvino speculates in the Collezione di sabbia piece 'Com'era nuovo il Nuovo Mondo,' we would even be capable of discerning a new world if one were discovered: 'se un nuovo Nuovo Mondo venisse scoperto ora, lo sapremmo vedere7.' (15; 'if a new New World were discovered now, would we be able to see it?'). From youthful musings on goats in 'Le capre ci guardano'15 to wondering whether it was possible to follow the undulations of a breaking wave in Palomar (1983), Calvino maintained a vantage of the world imbued with the childlike wonder and amazement of the traveller. Is it possible today to 'scartare dalla mente tutte le immagini che siamo abituati ad associare all'aspettativa d'un mondo diverse (quelle della\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nfantascienza, per esempio) per cogliere la diversita vera che si presenterebbe ai nostri occhi?' (15; 'discard from the mind all the images that we are accustomed to associate with the expectations of a diverse world (those of science fiction, for example) in order to capture the true diversity that would present itself to our eyes?'). Since we are all conditioned to notice only that which is immediately identifiable as part of our world, it is entirely possible that 'un Nuovo Mondo ci si apre tutti i giorni, e noi non lo vediamo' (15; 'a New World opens itself to us each day, and we do not see it'). Not unless, Calvino continues, we remain in the guise of a traveller to which everything is new. Calvino's writings on extraliterary topoi propose just such an exercise in visual recognition. I hypothesize that these writings confirm an innate visualizing tendency latent in Calvino's style that may reveal definite extraliterary sources of inspiration for much of his narrative. His lifelong interest in cinematic images, music, theatre, paintings and sketches, art exhibits, and collections of paraphernalia moves well beyond vicarious pursuits. The author actively engaged his creative talents with a variety of arts in an attempt to derive personal pleasure and enhance artistic plenitude. His attempts to transcribe the world into finely detailed descriptions, when considered with the theoretical scope of his articles on cognitive functions and the senses, convince me that for Calvino words and images were perhaps the same thing.16 While it is indeed arguable whether seeing is an appropriate metaphor for writing, the central self-conscious theme of most of his works is the visualization of space through words. For Calvino, to relate to the world is to see it, to transpose it, fully, onto the white page before him, the so-called allegorical canvas of the mind. This descriptive impulse is sustained by a pictorially evocative technique that orders reality within a measurable grid, deciphers the world, transforming a visual experience into a depicted temporalized event. To describe the world with words is thus tantamount to locating, not fixing, it in time, to taking an evolving snapshot, to deciphering and depicting it. For Barthes, these de-picted objects can never translate the world nor may an author use the object as its own referent because reality is never still but in constant emersion. An author must instead transcodify reality from one system of referents to another, equally suspect one.17 Though literature may install a fictive form of visual presence, literary language is made up of names which are never truly transparent. They are visual markers and have no essential content. This problem is the focus of Calvino's essay 'The Written and the Unwritten Word'18 and is part\n\n12 Painting with Words, Writing with Pictures of the unresolvable dilemma of Calvino's art. It is no small irony that the very words used to depict the world may in no way reflect it. This is an issue Calvino grappled with time and again. If, as Barthes states, every literary description is a view,19 Calvino's views enfranchise the primacy of the visual as the hallmark of his narrative activity. While the author's painterly inclinations reach their maximum import in Palomar (in the interview 'E 1'occhio scruta il caos del mondo' Calvino states 'Ho voluto scrivere come un tempo disegnavano i pittori'20 ['I wanted to write the way painters once painted']), it is interesting that as early as the 1955 essay 'II midollo del leone' Calvino was contemplating a literature that would somehow breach its confines and be all things to all readers: E sempre con curiosita e speranza e meraviglia che il giovane, 1'operaio, il contadino che ha preso gusto a leggere, aprono un libro nuovo. Sempre cosi' vorremmo che venissero aperti anche i nostri.21 It is always with curiosity and hope and marvel that the youth, the worker, the farmer who has acquired the pleasure of reading, opens a new book. It is always in this fashion that we would wish our books to be opened. This type of literature would demand a purview that was more innovative than fictive, more artistic than narrative,22 a style that inspires 'meraviglia' and 'speranza' ('marvel' and 'hope'), two requisites that recall baroque canons of intricate design and visual haptic texture. Calvino described such a system of fiction building in the 1960 Note to / nostri antenati when speaking of the process that generated // visconte dimezzato: Dunque, da un po' di tempo pensavo a un uomo tagliato in due per lungo, e che ognuna delle due parti andava per conto suo. La storia di un soldato, in una guerra moderna? Ma la solita satira espressionista era fritta e rifritta: meglio una guerra dei tempi andati, i Turchi, un colpo di scimitarra, no: meglio un colpo di cannone, cosi' si sarebbe creduto che una meta era andata distrutta, invece poi saltava fuori. (355) Therefore, for some time I had been thinking of a man cut in half, with each of these two parts living on its own. The story of a soldier, in a mod\n\nIntroduction 13 ern war? But the usual expressionist satire had been done and redone: better a war from some remote past, the Turks, a scimitar's blow, no: better a cannon blast, in this way it would be assumed that one half had been destroyed, only to reappear later.\n\nCalvino continues thinking aloud until he confesses a telling analogy. Come un pittore puo usare un ovvio contrasto di colori perche gli serve a dare evidenza a una forma, cosi' io avevo usato un ben noto contrasto narrative per dare evidenza a quel che mi interessava, cioe il dimidiamento. (355) Just as a painter might use an obvious colour contrast because it serves to highlight a shape, I had used a well-known narrative contrast to highlight what really interested me, that is, division.\n\nThis 1960 reference to painting galvanizes an early possible model of interaction between discursive and imagistic signifying practices that will evolve to include paintings. It is an act of recognition that writing, for Calvino, is a production, rather than a perception of meaning. It is an admission he enhances years later in Turti ad arte': La pittura mi e servita sempre come spinta a rinnovarmi, come ideale di invenzione libera, di essere sempre se stessi facendo sempre qualcosa di nuovo.23 I have always used painting as a stimulus of personal renewal, as an ideal of free invention, always remaining the same while always doing something new.\n\nCritics have signalled a shift in texture and perspective in the new and improved sixties Calvino, with a cosmic dimension replacing a provincial one. I would contend, instead, that concomitant to the author's move from capricious inventions of fantasy to the objective categories of science there is an easing from temporality and differentiation (narratives that tell a story) to spatiality and density (image-bound, nondiscursive gestalts).24 Calvino is tapping into his original pleasures of writing, a pleasure we will attempt to pursue to its ultimate conclusion. This not only involved combinatorics (a skill he possessed in early tales25 and honed while a member of the experimental French\n\n14 Painting with Words, Writing with Pictures\n\ngroup OuLiPo, Ouvroir de Litterature Potentielle) but also an expanding confidence in his own creative possibilities as a depictive writer. In this study I do not pretend to supply ideal solutions of what Calvino's narrative project is or what, indeed, it is meant to be. Rather, my interpretation serves as a model for possible further explorations of the images that he used, be they drawn from real or imaginary experiences (stories written in the fifties), gleaned from readings in parascientific literature (the sixties), hammered from playful excursions into narratology (the seventies), inspired from collected paraphernalia in exhibitions (the eighties), or meticulously rendered from personal perceptions before artworks. I thus intend to approach Calvino's writings as a composite of this variegated and self-pollinating system of images. What this approach does in the first instance is displace the notion of sign from the hegemony of logocentrism. The question of action or inaction, addressed by Calvino in his letter to Wahl, is therefore of utmost importance, for it augurs parallel discussions of linear and spiral, of time and space, of word and image, as well as tangential issues of gender. I will also map the visual pathways of Calvino's writings by examining what I consider transitional short stories, introductions and prefaces to art catalogues, his critical and imaginative essays on art. Finally, I will examine Calvino's descriptions of specific paintings and use of cultural icons. As a lateral thinker, the author was able to make intriguing connections between the most disparate items. Calvino's methodological gaze will prove invaluable, as it permits us an illuminated vision of things as if they had never been fathomed.\n\nChapter One\n\nFrom Word to Image\n\nTime and Space are Real Beings, a Male and a Female. Time is a Man, Space is a Woman. William Blake1\n\n/ live in an age which is over saturated with theories and abstract discourse, in reaction, I try to focus my attention on the things I see, on images. Italo Calvino2\n\nThis chapter examines Calvino's move from a narrative constructed with words to one built on images. The nature of this migration is subtle. Indeed, one can argue that the author's visual project is indigenous, that curt, crisp, revelatory images are the hallmark of his entire writing experience. For Francois Wahl Lo choc del reale provoca 1'apparizione d'un'immagine: e ancora il reale ed e gia un'altra cosa; 1'immagine traduce un'esperienza, ma significa di piu e su un altro piano. Ed ecco che questo simbolo si mette a vivere; sviluppa una logica sua propria; porta con se una rete d'avvenimenti, di personaggi; impone il suo tono, il suo linguaggio.3 The shock of reality provokes the apparition of an image: it is still reality and it is already something else; the image translates an experience, but it signifies more and on another plane. And so this symbol comes to live; develops its own logic; carries with it a series of events, characters; imposes its own tone, its own language.\n\n16 Painting with Words, Writing with Pictures\n\nThese images are nevertheless coerced by language to travel uneasy ideological paths: the fabulous path to the origin (nest) of spiders, the cosmological path to the origin (science) of concepts, the hyperscrutinizing path to the origin (natural history) of the senses, for example. Calvino will feel confident with his hidden talent only after 1963, a watershed year for both a renewal of his narrative topoi (the use of infinite universal paradigms) and a renewed and enhanced critical reception. My hypothesis is that Calvino's attention to visual representations is commensurate with his lifelong ambition to extend the wordbound limits of the literary medium. I speculate that Calvino, like his twentieth-century counterparts in the visual arts, would have liked to have turned the word itself into an image of meaning, but preferred the comfortable, controlled climate of his writing table. This explains his toying with sister arts analogies. In this chapter, then, I will ground my arguments within an interarts analogy that contrasts the colours of nature and paint with verbal language and structure. I will not stress the traditional mirroring function of the two arts, nor attempt to resolve the greater epistemological questions of communication, but will instead focus on the paradoxical nature of the two media by interpreting them as signs of reality, as perceptual systems in their own right. This semiotic concreteness allows Calvino to juxtapose verbal and visual sign systems in an unlimited cultural semiosis while maintaining the vigilant awareness of his own dominant discourse. Overreaching Boundaries One of the fundamental structures of the modern imagination is the visual metaphor. Images have achieved a power over us that was only dreamed of (and feared) in the past. The power unleashed by the spatial visualization of culture has broken down the hierarchical orders of institutionalized linear discourses (particularly philosophy, art history, literature) that promoted self-sufficient, singular, often exclusionary, aesthetic canons. The success of the figurative paradigm in contemporary culture has spawned irredentist claims by art historians who wish to safeguard the exclusive visual and spatial component of their medium. Literary proponents of narrative space, on the other hand, hold that current notions of architectonic design and spatial topicality in the temporal arena of literature are inferred by the nature of the medium. These critics argue that spatial metaphors never intended to physically occupy the body of a text but are, nevertheless, an essential\n\nFrom Word to Image 17\n\nand not incidental component of the reading experience. There is a considerable body of literature that attempts to either reconcile or exacerbate the obvious differences between the arts.4 Strategies for explaining away the exceptions to the rule of a space-time differentiation have produced valid theories, but they have also renewed age-old fears of logocentric versus imagocentric values. W.J.T. Mitchell views objections to the notion of literary space as symptomatic of a traditional ekphrastic fear that promotes an attitude of mistrust of and anxiety towards all sorts of images, be they mental, pictorial, verbal, or perceptual.5 The relevance of the word and image controversy is essential to my argument for it strikes at the very nature of Calvino's writing style and his use of imagery and images. Conventionally, the term image is applied to patterns of reality presented to the eye; that is, photos, projections, displays, and so forth. In a standard sense, these items have a visual appearance; they look like the something that is undisputably being represented. So-called mental images, on the other hand, those relegated to the realm of perception, occur as a pattern of nervous activity in the lateral geniculate nucleus within the spectator. The epistemology of these two types of images is decidedly different. Indeed, the format of the neural hardware that reproduces the event on the mind's canvas has no direct relationship to the pre-retinal scene of which it is said to be an image. Yet, whether they impress themselves upon our senses or develop, often unintentionally, as phantasms within, images are part of a fundamental principle of what Michel Foucault calls 'the order of things.'6 Narrative, too, is one of the fundamental order-making operations of culture. Working primarily through tropisms, the process of narrativization converts impressions into mental images. Description is the primary vehicle for constructing the contiguous chain of events in space-time that we interpret as a story. It has been acknowledged that Calvino's narrative is subtended by a visual writing style that is primarily descriptive in nature. His discourse proceeds by a series of synecdochic or metonymic details which stand as it were for the totality of items being represented, and he is able to generate additional meaning through connotation and metaphoric patterning. This narrative is, in fact, subtended by the image and reveals a fabulatory 'delight in design.'7 This purely visual universe moves beyond natural likeness towards an imaging of the world that is based on a verbal (temporal) sign system grounded in iconicity (spatiality). In such a scenario, man is both imagined and re-imagined and is able to play a role in the re-imagination of himself.\n\n18 Painting with Words, Writing with Pictures\n\nCalvino has often been deemed an aloof and detached writer: the visual index of his narrative is such that reality is explored from a willed and comfortable distance. Yet, the visual component of his work has received scant and, for the most part, unsatisfactory critical attention.8 Scholars have preferred to focus on his eclectic and ludic use of modern literary techniques, the fantasy-like quality of his narrative, or the use of scientifically inspired patterns and forms. I wish instead to read Calvino's fiction as part of a visual system that develops cognitive patterns which attempt to create a synergism between verbal and visual language systems. For this reason, I am zeroing in on a particular aspect of this visual system, that is, the painterly, or descriptive posture this attitude privileges. It was Calvino himself who made the most extensive comparisons between the words he used and the sources (real and imagined) that may have inspired them. An innovative and unorthodox writer, his fiction moves beyond simple classifications and welcomes just this sort of interart and interdisciplinary comparison. The son of scientists, Calvino wrote essays in the sixties postulating the use of scientific equations as sources for literary inspiration and often fused ideas of relativity and quantum mechanics, simultaneity and cybernetics into his creative work, especially the cosmicomic tales. These critical and creative writings present a synthesis of scientific knowledge and literary form, polysemic inversions and narrative possibilities that may be seen to augur current epistemological questions. For example, by mythologizing the most obscure formulae of the new physics in the collection of stories Ti con zero (1967, T Zero) Calvino confronted the reader with the possibility that alternate explanations exist regarding the interaction of man and the universe. Several short stories in I racconti (1958) can be seen as possible early metaphors for both word processing ('La notte dei numeri' ['The Night of Numbers']) and the perceptual problematic inherent to virtual reality ('L'avventura di un lettore' [The Adventure of a Reader'], 'L'avventura di un soldato' [The Adventure of a Soldier'], 'L'avventura di un viaggiatore' [The Adventure of a Traveller']), and cyberspace paradigms ('La Signora Paulatim' ['Mrs. Paulatim']). His article 'Cibernetica e fantasmi' (1967; 'Cybernetics and Ghosts') postulated the creation of 'una macchina poetico-elettronica' ('a poetic-electronic machine') that could 'proporre nuovi modi d'intendere la scrittura' ('propose new ways of conceiving writing').9 Finally, in 'Che testa,' an article regarding the interface of the human senses and the world, Calvino, taking his cues from research into interactive information systems, postulated the primacy\n\nFrom Word to Image 19\n\nof vision and touch as metaphors of human consciousness.10 He even intended to write five short stories each highlighting a different sense. It should be apparent from these few examples that Calvino viewed literature as an investigative activity that may examine the existential, spiritual and, why not, neurophysiological processes that shape worldly experience. Calvino was an iconic thinker. By this I do not mean that his work is representational, although its underlying strategy is the re-assembly of reality through minute verbal descriptions. Rather, the descriptive process causes the author to create icons (be they literary images, verbal diagrams, or visual metaphors) that tend to generate textual resemblance while at the same time eschewing closeness. Thus, if the patterns and symmetries generated in the text correspond to or imitate existing elemental relations, their iconicity as an image or diagram of reality is intensified. This occurs in the early war tales where terror, not facts, are highlighted through intense descriptions, as well as in the cosmicomic tales where theories, not reality, are mimicked through style. If, instead, Calvino establishes a symbolic circuit through which he affords insight into a particular relation of logocentric meaning to imagocentric meaning (for example, in the Palomar stories where the image constructed by words is simultaneously deconstructed by its slippery context, or, and more pertinently, in his interpretations of paintings and artworks), then his text is not representing an Other reality but rather constructing a way to achieve a parallel or anagogical way of thinking. The patterns, diagrams, models, and analogies that animate Calvino's writings create a dynamism that is both exploratory (in that it investigates reality) and formulative (in that it creates a new reality). It is exploratory in its unceasing quest for cultural icons that bear scrutiny and may reveal hidden values. Icons, according to Charles S. Peirce, are unique in their capactity to uncover 'unexpected truth': 'a great distinguishing property of the icon is that by the direct observation of it other truths concerning its object can be discovered than those which suffice to determine its construction. Thus, by means of two photographs a map can be drawn, etc. Given a conventional or other general sign of an object, to deduce any other truth than that which it explicitly signifies, it is necessary, in all cases, to replace that sign by an icon.'11 And it is formulative because through the protean workings of his mind, Calvino is able to shape, as Wendy Steiner states, the 'ineluctable modality of the visible'12 into images of constantly evolving and unexpected matter. Calvino's narrative is a melange of polysemic styles and methods\n\n20 Painting with Words, Writing with Pictures\n\nthat attempt to do just that. It is his potential for 'morphing' or shapechanging that makes his narrative the dynamic process that it is, a fact he ironically alludes to, as we have seen, in the opening chapter of Se una notte d'inverno un viaggiatore (1979, If on a winter's night a traveller) when he states, referring to himself, 'si sa che e un autore che cambia molto da libro a libro. E proprio in questi cambiamenti si riconosce che e lui' (9; 'he is known as an author who changes greatly from one book to the next. And in these very changes you recognize him as himself 9). At the same time there is a subtending core to Calvino's professional activity that guarantees a directional focus and constancy. The underlying and unifying motivation of his writings is the exploitation of the mimetic potential of literature and its ability to bridge the gap between the written and the unwritten world. He was given to mannerism, to technical experimentation, to the adaptation of ideas foreign to literature, to the re-utilization of his own and others' topoi and motifs to create a grand mosaic of orderly and re-ordered worlds. He was wont to set his stories together, treating their themes like spatial bodies, juxtaposing and arranging them on the canvas of the Table of Contents page much as a painter arranges objects on a dais.13 His eventual turn to narrativizing the images in paintings was, to my mind, part of this desire to foreshorten the barrier between the arts, the ultimate aim of which was to contrive a semiosis appealing to all the senses. A 'speaking picture,' such as those painted by the artist Valerio Adami and narrativized by Calvino, for example, would have all the qualities of its makers. It would signify itself, becoming a voice or presence, exactly what Peirce called an icon. This need to overreach the boundaries of one's own art, to integrate extra-literary topoi into the realm of literature, is 'an attempt to dispel (or at least mask) the boundary between art and life, between sign and thing, between writing and dialogue.'14 The topos of the artwork that comes to life is a constant in the aesthetics of all ages and it is not my aim to widen my discussion here.15 It is interesting to note, however, that Calvino's love affair with the image begins, according to the author, at a very young age. Of Fantasy Images and Visual Patterns From early tales to the roving eye of Mr Palomar, Calvino's texts have been dominated by ekphrastic tendencies privileging the synchronic modelling of reality into moving visual tableaus rather than a narrative\n\nFrom Word to Image 21\n\nsteeped in temporal exigencies. Perhaps it was Calvino's ingrained disaffection with standard party politics and suffocating ideology that led him to question the very validity of words in the service of any creed. He questions the schizophrenic stance of leftist intellectuals, including himself, who laboured under the emotional strain of serving two masters, Literature and Politics: Noi comunisti Italian! eravamo schizofrenici. Si, credo proprio che questo sia il termine esatto. Con una parte di noi eravamo e volevamo essere i testimoni della verita, i vendicatori del torti subiti dai deboli e dagli oppress!, i difensori della giustizia contro ogni sopraffazione. Con un'altra parte di noi giustificavamo i torti, le sopraffazioni, la tirannide del partito, Stalin, in nome della Causa. Schizofrenici. Dissociati.16 We Italian communists were schizophrenics. Yes, I believe that this is the exact term. Part of our being wanted to testify to truth, we were the vindicators of the wrongs suffered by the weak and the oppressed, the defenders of justice against abuse. With another part of ourselves we justified the wrongs, the abuse, the tyranny of the party, Stalin, in the name of the Cause. Schizophrenics. Separate.\n\nThis attitude spawns the cloven viscount, one of Calvino's most memorable and significant genetic characters: 'la lacerazione c'e nel Visconte dimezzato e forse in tutto cio che ho scritto. E la coscienza della lacerazione porta il desiderio d'armonia' ('laceration is part of The Cloven Viscount and perhaps in everything I have written. The knowledge of laceration leads to the desire for harmony').17 Always sceptical of immanent domains or transcendent systems of values, words seemed chock full of ambiguity; they were manipulative, could easily deceive. Perhaps Calvino's lifelong passion for film and love of painting fuelled his distanced narrative gaze. Yet, as a writer, words were necessary to engender the images that fostered the newly found social collectivity. Words produced the scenes of war, the shared pictures of tragedy, the emotional icons of struggle relived in the vivid hues of memory. Once depicted, however, these images bore 'lo stampo delle favole piu remote' ('II midollo del leone/ 15; 'the imprint of the most remote fable'). They became, that is, somehow preternatural and antecedent to the text that re-presented them. Though subtended, conjured, created by words, the images, indeed, were not the words themselves. In the remarkable Preface to // sentiero del nidi di ragno Calvino pre-\n\n22 Painting with Words, Writing with Pictures\n\nsents what amounts to a public confession of this eternal dilemma. He begins with the euphoric image of an all-encompassing vibrancy - 'ci muovevamo in un multicolore universe di storie' (8; 'we moved in a varicolored universe of stories/ vi) - and ends with the introspective candour of losing 'le immagini' ('the images'), not the words, 'che avevi immagazzinato' ('that you had stored'): le immagini privilegiate resteranno bruciate dalla precoce promozione a motivi letterari, mentre le immagini che hai voluto tenere in serbo, magari con la segreta intenzione di servirtene in opere future, deperiranno, perche tagliate fuori daH'integrita naturale della memoria fluida e vivente. (23) the favored images will be consumed by their premature promotion to literary themes, while the images you wanted to keep in reserve, perhaps with the secret intention of using them in future works, will wither, because they are cut off from the natural wholeness of vital, flowing memory, (xxiv)\n\nCollective memory is decanted into suffered personal loss of self: Cosi mi guardo indietro, a quella stagione che mi si presento gremita d'immagini e di significati: ... e tutto e lontano e nebbioso, e le pagine scritte sono li' nella loro sfacciata sicurezza che so bene ingannevole ... e avrei bisogno di tutto il resto, proprio di quello che li' non c'e. (24) And so I look back, to that season which appeared to me crammed with images and meanings: ... and everything is distant and misty, and the written pages are there, in their shameless confidence which I well know is fraudulent... and I would need all the rest, the very things that are not there, (xxiv)\n\nThe words 'immagini' ('images') and 'significati' ('meanings') stand out. The 'immagini' ('images') remain distant, nebulous, uncertain; they commingle with staid, solid, mockingly sure and written 'significati' ('meanings'). These thoughts leave an indelible thumbprint of unfulfilled expectancy ('quello che li non c'e' ('the very things that are not there'), a void, that would condition his entire career. To my mind, Calvino's preference for the much ballyhooed motifs of lightness, exactitude, and visibility in narrative indicate not a late, inci-\n\nFrom Word to Image 23\n\ndental, or arbitrary happenstance but a definite, ongoing narrative search to fill this void. Already in // sentiero dei nidi di ragno there is a willed passage to iconic plenitude and modes of representation that combined novel techniques with traditional subjects. No longer would words arbitrarily fix and condition images; they would instead provide them with a pluri-probable existence imbued with a reverie of limitless design. There is a return, if you will, to a primitive notion of narration, a combinatory of limited elements with infinite potential where 'ogni parola acquistava nuovi valori e li trasmetteva alle idee e alle immagini da essa designate' ('Cibernetica e fantasmi/ 165; 'each word acquired new values and transmitted them to the ideas and images they defined,' 5). Writing would become an active sense not merely recording reality but creating it through the act of regard. Indeed, just as fable (an 'insieme di frasi, immagini' [a 'collection of phrases and images']) is to myth (Vive di silenzio oltre che di parola' ['it lives of silence as well as of words']), so is the image to the word. For Calvino, fable (the image) gives rise to myth (the word), but myth 'aspira le parole nel suo vortice e da alia fiaba una forma' ('Cibernetica e fantasmi/ 174-5; 'draws words up into its vortex and bestews a form on fable,' 19). Calvino believed that fable created visual tapestries that hovered in the collective imagination. There is a position, stated clearly in 'Cibernetica e fantasmi' but enacted in all his prose, that in an archaic time there existed a purity of language where words and things were intimately connected with everyday experience and visual perception: II narratore della tribu mette insieme frasi, immagini: il figlio minore si perde nel bosco, vede una luce lontana, cammina cammina, la fiaba si snoda di frase in frase, dove tende? (174) The storyteller of the tribe puts together phrases and images: the younger son gets lost in the forest, he sees a light in the distance, he walks and walks; the fable unwinds from sentence to sentence, and where is it leading? (18)\n\nThe process leads, for Calvino, to 'il farsi d'un destine' ('the creation of a destiny'), to the certainty that the fanciful patterns and fantastic sequences imagined in the mind find currency in the images, the imaginary world of a peoples' culture. Indeed, 'le fiabe sono vere'18 ('fables are real'). As a cultural process narrativization releases the storyteller\n\n24 Painting with Words, Writing with Pictures\n\nfrom the social taboo against unfettered and irresponsible thought, opening him to infinite possibilities, raising the consciousness of the individual to that of the collective. The storyteller improvises visual worlds with words, inventing dreams to share. An ideal fable world allows the storyteller to transport himself into his envisioned world, transforming himself into an eagle in flight and the world into unbounded sky. For the participants things really are as they seem. A suspension of disbelief is required on the part of the interlocutors in order to activate the story, to produce the effect and maintain the visual illusion. This is also a requisite of fantasy narratives where, according to Tzvetan Todorov, 'the reader must adopt a certain attitude with regard to the text: he will reject allegorical as well as \"poetic\" interpretations/19 The literal content of these worlds thus assumes the spontaneity and flexibility of a real dream, of a subjective partaking of the Jungian unconscious. Creativity becomes a shared medium, a communication between author (teller) and reader (listener) taken to an intimate level of shared imagined experience. Though frustrated by the limiting potential of the written word, Calvino's need for total fulfilment within the textual experience is the motivating factor of his narrative. If any disappointment is sensed in Calvino and his characters it is usually caused by metaphysical and narratological obstacles rather than existential impediments. In 'Ultimo viene il corvo' ('The Crow Comes Last'), an enigmatic short story written in 1946, for instance, a young boy joins a group of Partisans on their military forays. The seasoned men are immediately both amazed and amused by the boy's uncanny marksmanship as he unerringly fells any object he places within his rifle sights. The boy's thoughts, however, reveal a more philosophical, existential insight to this practical skill: Si fece dare altre cartucce. Erano in tanti ormai a guardarlo, dietro di lui in riva al fiumicello. Le pigne in cima agli algeri dell'altra riva perche si vedevano e non si potevano toccare? Perche quella distanza vuota tra lui e le cose? Perche le pigne che erano una cosa con lui, nei suoi occhi, erano invece la, distanti? Pero se puntava il fucile la distanza vuota si capiva che era un trucco; lui toccava il grilletto e nello stesso momento la pigna cascava, troncata al picciolo. Era un senso di vuoto come una carezza: quel vuoto della canna del fucile che continuava attraverso 1'aria e si riempiva con lo sparo, fin laggiu alia pigna, allo scoiattolo, alia pietra bianca, al fiore di papavero. (134)\n\nFrom Word to Image 25 They gave him some more cartridges when he asked for them. Lots of men were looking on now from the bank behind him. Why, he thought, could he see the pine cones at the tops of the trees on the other bank and not touch them? Why was there this empty distance between things and himself? Why were the pine cones, which seemed part of him, inside his eyes, so far away instead? Surely it was an illusion when he aimed the gun into the empty distance and touched the trigger and at the same second a pine cone dropped in smithereens? The sense of emptiness felt like a caress, emptiness inside the rifle barrel continuing through the air and filling out when he shot; the pine cone up there, a squirrel, a white stone, a butterfly. (96)\n\nThe protagonist's ekphrastic hope, his desire to reach out to objects, is facilitated by the rifle, which indeed reaches its targets and extends, literally, his voyeuristic grasp. The all-encompassing reach, however, proves, at this stage in the young author's career, to be destructive. A modern-day Medusa, everything he fixes in his gaze turns to stone; images are stilled, made passive by their submission to a penetrating bullet. It is telling that the protagonist is a child. By foregoing spatial distance the boy has destroyed any possibility of future perspective. The rifle, like words, gets in the way. In effect, a vicarious proximity does not provide satisfaction. The boy is frustrated by the inability to physically touch the objects without the mediating rifle, to reach out endlessly without any cost, indeed, to become, as in fable, the bullet that does not destroy the object. The young author's pertinacious attempts to touch reality with words promotes a similarly thwarted euphoria. Like the boy, he is genuinely unable to touch the real crow circling overhead without destroying the stitched icon of the eagle on the German soldier's jacket: Allora il soldato si alzo in piedi e indicando 1'uccello nero col dito, - La c'e il corvo! - gido, nella sua lingua. II proiettile lo prese giusto in mezzo a un'aquila ad ali spiegate che aveva ricamata sulla giubba. (139) So the soldier got to his feet and pointed at the black bird. There's a crow!' He shouted in his own language. The bullet hit him in the middle of an eagle with spread wings embroidered on his tunic. (101)\n\nBehind the icon stands a real object in relation to which the interpreter is merely a receiver. But here the equation reverses itself. The boy takes\n\n26 Painting with Words, Writing with Pictures subject status over the symbol as object, only to destroy it, unintentionally, because his means of appropriation, his semantic point of view, is ekphrastic violence. This is an exceptional instance of figurative ecstasy, one, Plato reminds us, that constructs reality through visual perception and imagination but frustrates the artist when desire is unfulfilled because the tools, the words, are immature. To speak of Calvino's use of imagery, then, is to search for the grain of his thinking as a creative writer and developing artist. For Calvino, fantasy is at once and at the same time a willed retreat from the rigours of reality and a salutary and enlightening engagement within it, a moment of ekphrastic ecstacy when the connection between words and images becomes primal. His strategy is that of the detached yet ever-present observer; cognizant yet engagingly naive about life, profound yet purposely remaining on the surface of phenomena. This reluctance to impose authorial definition makes for a kind of literary syncretism that invites the reader to join in a visual quest of conceptual expansion. Fantasy permits the young artist to emerge from the ordinary and find the 'varco' (passage, safety valve) that permits a different point of view, that sanctions an escape from automatic (and unavoidable) obedience to gravity, that allows a bending of the spacetime continuum, basic laws of Newtonian physics, what Kathryn Hume calls 'consensus reality.'20 In these terms, fantasy is a deliberate departure from reality, from the mimesis that has traditionally conditioned man's physical existence. As an artist, Calvino has consistently wrestled with these binds by offering many differing and complex versions and visions of reality, always attempting to move beyond the word-bound and sequential linearity of the text without, however, ever losing sight of mankind. Visual fantasy thus fulfils some of the primary tenets of Calvino's approach to the world and to literature. First, it is highly structured. The reader assumes an extraordinary sense of pleasure in form and a basic delight in designs that are to be appreciated for their visual complexities. Second, fantasy is never stagnant but promotes diversity and is often multimedia oriented. Ultimately fantasy wishes to stretch the reading experience by appealing to all the senses. Calvino's narratives exhibit these requisites in unfaltering constancy. In the Introduction to Racconti fantastici dell'ottocento (Fantastic Stories from the Nineteenth Century), the author retroactively explains the relevance of his audaciously fantastic trilogy and attempts to situate himself within a definite stream of fantasy writing (among those writ-\n\nFrom Word to Image 27 ers, he states, who place 'in primo piano una suggestione visiva'21 ['a visual suggestion as primary']) by toying with authorial intentionality. These words echo motivations described twenty years earlier in the Note to I nostri antenati. Speaking of II visconte dimezzato Calvino stated that by writing a tale that was 'completamente fantastica, mi trovavo senz'accorgermene a esprimere non solo la sofferenza di quel particolare momento ma anche la spinta a uscirne' (354; 'completely fantastic, I found myself, without knowing it, expressing not only the suffering of that particular moment but the stimulus to escape it'). Calvino makes it clear that it was his intention to use fantasy imagery as a vehicle for the discussion about the condition of man in the fifties: Ho voluto fame una trilogia d'esperienze sul come realizzarsi esseri umani: nel Cavaliere inesistente la conquista dell'essere, nel Visconte dimezzato 1'aspirazione a una completezza al di la delle mutilazioni imposte dalla societa, nel Barone rampante una via verso una completezza non individualistica da raggiungere attraverso la fedelta a un'auto-determinazione individuale; tre gradi d'approccio alia liberta. (360) I wanted to write a trilogy about the experiences of becoming human: The Nonexistent Knight would deal with the conquest of being, The Cloven Viscount would treat the aspirations of wholeness that went beyond the mutilation imposed by society, The Baron in the Trees would show a way towards a non-individualist wholeness to be achieved through faith in individual auto-determination; three stages in the acquisition of liberty. The use of imagery is more than a conditioning theme. It has become instead a method, a way of defusing potentially disturbing confrontations with existential dis-ease. The progression is noted by Calvino: 'capivo benissimo che il pregio e d'essere favolosi quando si parla di proletariate e di fattacci di cronache mentre a esserlo parlando di castelli e di cigni non c'e nessuna bravura' (353; T knew very well that it was meritorious being fabulous when one is speaking of the proletariat and of news facts while to be so while speaking of castles and swans needs no cleverness'). Thus the quickness, lightness, rapidity, exactness, multiplicity and, above all, the visibility Calvino wishes to impart to the next millennium in the posthumous Six Memos for the Next Millennium (1988) is indigenous to fantasy literature as described by the author in Racconti fantastid dell'ottocento. These attributes would form\n\n28 Painting with Words, Writing with Pictures\n\nthe nucleus of his fabulous style. The subject matter would remain the grand encyclopedia of ethically inspired 'real experience.' How else do we explain Calvino's characters of the fifties? All of them, whether they are battling non-existent knights in 7 nostri antenati or immersed in the vicissitudes of everyday existence in 7 racconti, invariably exist in alternative or parallel universes that draw their premises from reality but move at a level that is literally beyond both space and time. While it is easy to accept the unreal texture of 7 nostri antenati, the stories that comprise I racconti seem unclassifiable as fantastic tales. While the ancestors are unable to differentiate between ideas and myopic perception, the characters of these supposedly real worlds have difficulty distinguishing between themselves and the world they reify. Their worst fears have become palpable, their wildest ideas have become visible. They are subject to the same chance occurrences as characters in a fairy tale. This 'imaginary causality/ as Todorov calls it,22 interrupts their ordinary lives with events which are out of the ordinary (the 'avventures' in / racconti, 1958), surreal (La formica argentina, 1952), or make-believe (the Marcovaldo stories, 1963), to cite a few examples. In each of these cases, the surreal begins the moment the unconventional occurs. Thus, though the stories in 7 racconti are not fantasy by any stretch of the imagination, they nevertheless fall under the rubric of what Calvino labelled the 'fantastico \"mentale\", o \"astratto\", o \"psicologico\", o \"quotidiano\"' (Racconti fantastici, 10; 'the mental, abstract, psychological, or quotidian fantastic'). These characters follow a series of patterned adventures in which each undergoes a sort of spiritual or physical metamorphosis centred on outward appearances. There is, in other words, an effacement of the limit between the external and internal self.23 The imaginary thus becomes real and threatens normal existence. As the physical world and the imagined world interpenetrate, even time is suspended ('Andato al comando' [1946; 'Going to Headquarters']; 'Campo di mine' [1946; 'Mine Field']), while space is transformed into an often menacing (Taura sul sentiero' [1946; 'Fear on the Footpath']; 'Uno dei tre e ancora vivo' [1947; 'One of the Three is Still Alive']), often fanciful ('II bosco degli animali' [1948; 'Animal Woods']; Tl gatto e il poliziotto' [1948; 'The Cat and the Policeman']) engulfing existential flux. All attempts to actually live the misconception are doomed to failure as they become strait-jacketed to a solipsistic misreading of the visual cues around them. In the Note to 7 nostri antenati Calvino retrospectively explains the\n\nFrom Word to Image 29\n\ntwo poles of experience that provided the tension of his writing in the fifties. Consonant with future comments in Six Memos for the Next Millenium, he states that on the one hand there were 'le storie che si svolgono all'aria aperta, e in posti pubblici, per esempio una stazione, con quel tanto di rapporti umani tra gente che si trova per caso' (353; 'stories that take place in the open air, and in public places, for example in a train station, along with that bit of human interaction of people who are there by chance'). These were stories generated through diachronic sequencing, the game of life that depended upon detail and logical connections between actions. On the other hand, we recall, there were imaginary tales that stimulated the author's senses and refuelled his imagination so that 'la storia s'organizzava su se stessa secondo uno schema perfettamente geometrico' (355; 'the story organized around itself a perfect geometric design'). Calvino decanted the complexity of reality to two personal centres of interest: action that evolves through sequencing, imagery that proceeds through visual patterns. The tension between the two constitutes the nature of his narrative. Calvino discounts mere expedience and always tries to live up to a personally set ideal. Meaning is achieved through a model-oriented aesthetic where the ultimate and irreducible point of validation remains within himself. Hence, the source of inspiration is more lyric than narrative; and sight, reserved at this stage of his career for the inner eye, is predominant: Quando comincio a scrivere pero, tutto cio e nella mia mente ancora in uno stato lacunoso, appena accennato. E solo scrivendo che ogni cosa finisce per andare al suo posto. (354) When I begin to write however, everything in my mind is still full of gaps and barely hinted. It is only through writing that everything falls into place.\n\nCalvino is describing a direct confrontation between two contexts, the spatial act of imagining and the temporal act of writing, that produces a drama not unlike that described by Mikhail Bakhtin as dialogue.24 This dramatic quality is not the result of two interlocutors but ultimately lies somewhere between the semantics of scientific and poetic language, between escapism and didacticism, between emotion and intellect. The oppositional nature of the heraldic trilogy that has heretofore\n\n30 Painting with Words, Writing with Pictures\n\nbeen grounded in a confrontation between fantasy and reality may now be seen as conversations between two opposing and unique linguistic entities: the referential system (for example, the setting of the stories described in denotative terms) and the poetic phenomenon (the unique happenstances surrounding each protagonist that inspire connotation). The fragility of this dialogue resides in the danger that one component may disappear (and indeed the protagonist of // cavaliere inesistente, 1959 [The Non-Existent Knight], Agilulfo, disappears once the issue of showing has been resolved in Calvino's mind and becomes a telling, that is, once Bradamante assumes control of the story as a complete character who both shows [as Suor Teodora] and tells [by writing] of herself), thereby revealing the unique nature of this particular writing/reading experience. We shall see that as Calvino becomes more confident with this technique, the reader will be given an everincreasing role, being asked not only to imagine the unimaginable but to help, in the best tradition of contemporary art, to decipher, and while helping, to construct the text. If these tales have been called surreal it is because of their subject matter. Their surreality is enhanced, however, not only by the quality of the images generated but by Calvino's complex reworking of space as an agrammatical construction. The viscount, for example, splits reality into manageable bits, a surreal visual collage of maimed objects that suits his own limited requisites. The baron's more conventional, yet equally abstract, method is to override civilization, ideology, and natural laws by erecting a scaffolding of self-sustaining rules. As one would expect, // cavaliere inesistente is a synthesis of the former two tales. As a surrealist painter bends light and mass by distilling their essence and rendering their contours, in this third tale the self becomes a distilled essence of sheer will. Accordingly, the knight has no spatial consistency; he is only an empty white carapace (a white expanse of page) separated from its surroundings by a thin black line outline, a drawn edge or border. If it is true that the only controllable world, as Calvino will discover, is the world of art circumscribed within the lined pages of a book, then art must dissect reality and transform its volatile corporality into eternal ideal. And so, Suor Teodora transforms common kitchen utensils into the regal paraphernalia of battle, ultimately allowing her imagination to re-invent and re-imagine herself, protected within the surreal carapace of literature. This character is the perfect paradigm of Calvino himself. As an incipient bricoleuse, Suor Teodora initiates a discourse that mixes media and involves the reader, all the while playing her\n\nFrom Word to Image 31 game with tongue in cheek and joyous aplomb. While this may be seen as an attempt by the author to gain a state of exuberant innocence where storyteller and audience share in the reverie of shared fiction, it is also possible that Calvino is already sensing the inadequacy of writing as a viable means of total experience. This is especially apparent in episodes of / nostri antenati, where the linear discourse seems overwhelmed by the spatial imagery. Throughout // cavaliere inesistente the author laments the tools of his trade, cautious since narrative often does not permit him to fully exploit his imagination. Hiding behind his narrator's vow of chastity, the author deploys a subtle metacritique of writing's shortcomings: Questa storia che ho intrapreso a scrivere e ancora piu difficile di quanto io non pensassi. Ecco che mi tocca rappresentare la piu gran follia dei mortal!, la passione amorosa, dalla quale il voto, il chiostro e il naturale pudore m'hanno fin qui scampata ... Dunque anche dell'amore come della guerra diro alia buona quel che riesco a immaginarne: 1'arte di scriver storie sta nel saper tirar fuori da quel nulla che si e capito della vita tutto il resto; ma finita la pagina si riprende la vita e ci s'accorge che quel che si sapeva e proprio un nulla. (63) This tale I have undertaken to write is even harder to write than I thought. Now I must describe that greatest of mortal follies, the passion of love, from which my vow, the cloister and my natural shyness have saved me till now ... Therefore of love as of war I shall give an idea as best as I can of whatever I am able to imagine: the art of writing tales consists in the ability to draw the rest of life from the little one has understood of it: but at the end of the page life begins again, and one realizes that one knew nothing at all. Or again: E verso la verita che corriamo, la penna e io, la verita che aspetto sempre che mi venga incontro, dal fondo d'una pagina bianca, e che potro raggiungere soltanto quando a colpi di penna saro riuscita a seppellire tutte le accidie, le insoddisfazioni, 1'astio che sono qui chiusa a scontare ... Ora devo rappresentare le terre attraversate da Agilulfo e dal suo scudiero nel loro viaggio: tutto qui su questa pagina bisogna farci stare, la strada maestra polverosa, il fiume, il ponte, ecco Agilulfo che passa sul suo cavallo dallo zoccolo leggero, toc-toc-toc-toc ... Ora sul ponte passa un galoppo\n\n32 Painting with Words, Writing with Pictures pesante: tutu turn! e Gurdulu ... Traccio sulla carta una linea diritta, ogni tanto spezzata da angoli, ed e il percorso di Agilulfo. Quest'altra linea tutta ghirigori e andarivieni e il cammino di Gurdulu. (87-8) It is towards the truth that we hurry, my pen and I, the truth that I expect will arrive from the bottom of a white page, and which I can reach only when my pen strokes have succeeded in burying all the disgust and dissatisfaction and rancour which I am here enclosed to expiate ... Now I must show the lands crossed by Agilulfo and his squire on their journey; I must fit everything on this page, the dusty main road, the river, the bridge, here's Agilulfo passing on his light hooved horse, tock-tock, tock-tock ... Now a heavy gallop passes over the bridge: tututurn! ... its Gurdulu ... On my paper I trace a straight line with occasional angles, and this is Agilulfo's route. This other line with its twirls and zigzags is Gurdulu's. The inadequacy of words as a conduit for imagination is a recurring theme in several of Gli amori difficili and the Marcovaldo tales.25 A dissatisfied author realizes that words must somehow acquire 'nuovi valori' ('new values') and must be capable of transmitting these values to the 'idee e alle immagine da essa designate' ('Cibernetica e fantasmi/ 165; 'ideas and images they defined/ 5). In order to accomplish this, the elusive quality of words needed to be controlled. Neorealism had momentarily achieved just such harmony through a rule-oriented strategy: la letteratura come la conoscevo io era un'ostinata serie di tentativi di far stare una parola dietro 1'altra seguendo certe regole definite, o piu spesso regole non definite ne definibili ma estrapolabili da una serie di esempi o protocolli, o regole che ci siamo inventate per 1'occasione cioe che abbiamo derivato da altre regole seguite da altri. ('Cibernetica e fantasmi,' 172) Literature as I knew it was a constant series of attempts to make one word stay put after another by following certain definite rules; or, more often, rules that were neither definite nor definable, but that might be extracted from a series of examples, or rules made up for the occasion, that is to say, derived from the rules followed by other writers. (15) But this reduced the figure of the author to a 'macchina scrivente'\n\nFrom Word to Image 33 ('writing machine'), already a 'personaggio anacronistico' (172; 'anachronistic character/ 15). In the same article, Calvino posits an avenue of escape for this apparent impasse: La linea di forza della letteratura moderna e nella sua coscienza di dare la parola a tutto cio che nell'inconscio sociale o individuale e rimasto non detto: questa e la sfida che continuamente essa rilancia. (175) The power of modern literature lies in its willingness to give a voice to what has remained unexpressed in the social or individual unconscious: this is the challenge it throws down time and again. (19) He then delineates this quest, mentioning those authors who explored the irrational, including Lautreamont, who exploded 'la sintassi deirimmaginazione' ('the syntax of imagination') and expanded 'il mondo visionario' ('the visionary world'). Calvino then cites the surrealists, stating that scoprono nelle associazioni automatiche di parole e d'immagini una ragione obiettiva contrapposta a quella della nostra logica intellettuale. (175-6) In automatic associations of words and images the Surrealists discover an objective rationale totally opposed to that of our intellectual logic. (20) This interest in the psychology of artistic production signals a future paradigm shift. Beginning with Freud's writings on art, Calvino cites two art historians who consider artistic expression in terms of combinatorial poetics. He values Ernst Gombrich's appraisal of poetry and art as processes analogous to children's wordplay: II procedimento della poesia e dell'arte - dice Gombrich - e analogo a quello del gioco di parole; e il piacere infantile del gioco combinatorio che spinge il pittore a sperimentare disposizioni di linee e colori e il poeta a sperimentare accostamenti di parole. (177) The processes of poetry and art, says Gombrich, are analogous to those of a play on words. It is the childish pleasure of the combinatorial game that leads the painter to try out arrangements of lines and colors, the poet to experiment with juxtapositions of words. (21)\n\n34 Painting with Words, Writing with Pictures\n\nThere seems to be a willed passage, here, from spontaneous games to fixed methods, from initial stages of verbal perception to the tried wisdom of visual experience, from writing about reality to the sequential creation of it in sensual material imagery. The reference to surrealism is particularly appropriate to the spatial nature of modern literature and to Calvino's narrative in particular. The pivoting between two worlds and two systems of meaning that haunted the young author is just the sort of liminality with which surrealist artists had experimented. It comes as no surprise that Calvino's writing becomes ever more sensitive and open to the challenge of the other's voice. There is an extraliterary world that he discovered and that he wished to graft, like a visual collage, onto his own plots as an act of capricious artistic creation. Imagism: New Ways of Seeing Calvino's writings have always been characterized by a powerful spirit of imagism. Consider the opening scene of // sentiero dei nidi di ragno: Per arrivare fino in fondo al vicolo, i raggi del sole devono scendere diritti rasente le pareti fredde, tenute discoste a forza d'arcate che traversano la striscia di cielo azzurro carico. Scendono diritti, i raggi del sole, giu per le finestre messe qua e la in disordine sui muri, e cespi di basilico e di origano piantati dentro pentole ai davanzali, e sottovesti stese appese a corde; fin giu al selciato, fatto a gradini e a ciottoli, con una cunetta in mezzo per 1'orina dei muli. Basta un grido di Pin, un grido per incominciare una canzone, a naso all'aria sulla soglia della bottega, o un grido cacciato prima che la mano di Pietromagro il ciabattino gli sia scesa tra capo e collo per picchiarlo, perche dai davanzali nasca un'eco di richiami e d'insulti. (29) To reach the depths of the alleys the sun's rays must go straight down, grazing cold walls spanned by arches that crisscross a strip of heavy blue sky. The sun's rays descend directly, falling over windows scattered haphazardly here and there over the walls, over tufts of basil and oregano planted in cooking pots sitting on sills and underclothes hung out on clotheslines; down to the pavement, made of cobbled steps with a gutter in the middle for mule urine. All you needed was a cry from Pin, a yelp that begins a song, his nose\n\nFrom Word to Image 35 poking out from the shop door, or a shriek let out just before Pietromagro the cobbler's hand smashed down between head and neck to strike him, and suddenly a chorus of shouts and insults pour from every window.\n\nAt first reading, this easily recognizable opening segment faithfully presents a plausible literary scene: a typically realist (spatial) description is interrupted, abruptly, by a verbal utterance, an activating (timebound) action. Calvino seems to be following standard neorealist canons of representation that privilege action above description, word above image, ideology above nature. Upon careful rereading, however, the passage appears to be at odds with such perfunctory definitions. The paradigm does not quite fit. As if setting the stage for future intracodal relationships between literature and the other arts, Calvino actualizes the scene with a cinematic quality. Images flash before the viewer; colours are blurred into a fleeting impression. The moment we perceive these images, however, the scene shifts to Pin. It is also interesting that we see the scene; we are not immersed in it. Pathos is foreshadowed, not directly dwelt upon. Even at this early stage in his career Calvino prefers a physical detachment and voyeuristic distance from the world, a gap that is shortened only by the fact that we are within earshot of Pin's shrill voice. The young author, already grappling with epistemological questions of 'la memoria - o meglio 1'esperienza' (Preface, 23; 'memory - or bet ter experience'), can be forgiven a bit of unbridled enthusiasm. He was obviously influenced by his love of film,26 but I also sense a deepseated inclination towards what will eventually become a visual hallmark. The scene is pictorially evocative. The long harsh rays that plummet down and graze, but do not warm, the cold walls, descend from a thick, heavily textured slice of blue sky. An austere noon-day glare plumbs this space, revealing its distorted contours. This dense, blue material light is criss-crossed by layers of surreal geometric patterns. Uneven windows drip with disorder, tufts of basil and oregano flourish on sills. Underclothes, the sure sign of a human presence, hang limply on clotheslines. Pause. Then, the reader's eye is abruptly pulled downwards, smashing into the stepped cobbled pavement, drawn forward by the scene's focal point, the gutter, that stretches into the distance carrying the pungent flow of mule urine. Calvino's description is thus anything but neorealistic; it is instead imagistic. Anyone awakening from a deep sleep would have the same\n\n36 Painting with Words, Writing with Pictures\n\nhazy impression of dilated spatial configurations. The scene has no shadows, little variation of tonality. Instead, the space is diffused with varying gradations of blotches of colour, saturated with the pungent redolence of herbs and urine. Temporality has been transfixed, fused into an ethereal present. These tangible images are woven together by the single verb scendere ('to descend'). The verb is repeated twice; the rays 'devono scendere diritti' ('must descend directly') in the first sentence and the second sentence opens with the words 'scendono diritti' ('they descend directly'), a proclitic illocutionary performative speech act that commandeers passage through the images the rays reveal. The scene is presented as a stained glass visual mosaic of independent scenes held together yet kept apart by slender ribs: 'tenute discoste a forza d'arcate' ('held apart because of arches'). The spatial pattern is static and unmoving yet it is traversed by an active, temporal, traditionally male entity, the sun. Only light animates the scene; it alone possesses an active verb function; light penetrates as it creates, animating the richly visual narrative. Then, suddenly, Pin bursts onto the scene. Rather, the visual landscape is overtaken by a something that is all decibel and testosterone. Though a war novel would not be as exciting without noise, Pin's explosion of sound serves to wrap the spatial dexterity of the scene within the cage of words: 'un grido per cominciare una canzone ... perche dai davanzali nasca un'eco di richiami e d'insulti' (29; 'a yelp that begins a song ... and a chorus of shouts and insults pours from every window'). Pin's presence infuses temporality into the scene, breathing life into the still life while simultaneously installing a crescendo of vocal stress. The opening sequence of the short story 'Buon a nulla' (1945),27 written in the same period, begins in a similar fashion: II sole entrava nella via di sbieco, gia alto, illuminandola disordinatamente, ritagliando le ombre dei tetti sui muri delle case di fronte, accendendo di barbagli le vetrine agghindate, battendo, sbucato da insospettati spiragli, sul volto dei passanti frettolosi che si scansavano su marciapiedi affollati. Vidi per la prima volta I'uomo dagli occhi chiari a un crocicchio,... (37) The sun entered the street aslant, already high in the heavens, confusingly illuminating it, cutting out shadows of roofs on the facing walls of houses, setting the windows ablaze with glare, springing out from unsus-\n\nFrom Word to Image 37 pected openings, beating against the faces of hurried passers-by as they dodged along the crowded sidewalk. I saw the man with clear eyes for the first time at a crossroads ...\n\nThe smooth, staccato rhythm of the passage juxtaposes images into a spontaneous, accidental collage. Once again, light is the revelatory agent, the animating, assaulting, foreign entity that 'illuminando/ 'ritagliando/ 'accendendo,' and 'battendo' ('illuminating,' 'cutting out/ setting ablaze' and 'beating') connects the images and establishes an expressive potential reflected in the face of passers-by. It penetrates the scene not directly, but aslant. The result is an undulating application of energy that injects flattened images with shadows that imbue unsuspected vigour. Again, unexpectedly, a figure emerges from the canvas, Tuomo dagli occhi chiari' ('the man with clear eyes'). The stranger's eyes possess a predatory, even demonic, quality. His vision is tactile, absorbent, haptic (from the Greek haptein, to seize or grasp). It captures the narrator ('il suo sguardo posato su di me' ['his gaze captured me']) ensnaring him, penetrating his essence ('uno sguardo immobile che mi comprendeva dalla testa ai piedi e non mi risparmiava neppure dietro e dentro' [37; 'an immobile gaze that embraced me from head to foot and did not even spare behind me or inside me']), confounding his actions ('mi osservava e non perdeva una mossa delle mie dita e sentivo il suo sguardo in mezzo ad esse, ad imbrogliarmi' [41; 'he observed me and did not lose a single movement of my fingers and I felt his gaze amonng them, confusing me']). From early tales such as 'Buon a nulla/ now collected in Prima che hi dica 'Pronto,' it is apparent that what instilled vigour into the young author's stories was not so much the action-packed word but the staid visual image. Calvino's natural tendencies are towards weaker spatial descriptions at a time when neorealist canons, in rhetoric reminiscent of the classic argument for the separation of visual/verbal and spatial/ temporal categories by G.E. Lessing, promoted an ideology of virile political action.28 Calvino confronts this issue in several articles published between 1946 and 1950 (though the same sentiments resonate in all his subsequent critical essays).29 Disputing the ideological direction ('direzione ideologica') being imposed, he states that 'i linguaggi letterari sono personali come fazzoletti da naso'30 ('literary language is as personal as a handkerchief). Wishing to highlight the inventive capacity of this work he continues:\n\n38 Painting with Words, Writing with Pictures lo invece faccio racconti di partigiani, di contadini, di contrabbandieri, in cui partigiani, contadini, contrabbandieri non sono che pretesti a storie piene di colore, d'accorgimenti narrativi e d'acutezze psicologiche:... I instead write stories about partisans, about peasants, contrabandists, in which partisans, farmers, peasants, contrabandits are nothing more than a pretext for stories rich with colour, narrative expedients and psychological acuteness:...\n\nFurthermore, the work is personal, subjective, almost romantically inspired: in fondo non studio che me stesso, non cerco che di esprimere me stesso, non cerco di rappresentare che dei simboli di me stesso nei personaggi e nelle immagini e nella lingua e nella tecnica narrativa ... non sono in fin dei conti che uno dei vecchi scrittori individualisti che pero s'esteriorizza in 'simboli' d'interesse attuale e collettivo.31 in reality I do nothing but study myself, I do nothing but express myself, I do not attempt to represent anything but symbols of myself in the characters and the images and in the language and in the narrative technique ... in the final analysis I am nothing more than one of those old individualistic writers who reveals himself in 'symbols' of actual and collective interest.\n\nThis personal visual attitude runs counter to the strong characterizations touted by the debates on neorealism and conditions Calvino's choice of protagonists. Always inept, usually introverted, their gestures are deliberately executed and meticulously documented by an intrusive narrator. They become the reader's eyes; roving, inquisitive, tele- and microscopic, but above all, detached. Their relationship with the external world is linear, chronological, unhesitatingly photographic. As prototypical Marco Polos and Palomars their mission is to record the world in all its particulars, however idiosyncratic or farfetched this may seem. Irony, incongruity, paradox, contradiction, and dualism now emerge as principles that inform this dynamic visual style. Vision is a parabolic act, a simultaneous intro- and extroverting that suggests paradigms of presence and absence. The archetype of these characters, then, is not one of action but one of reflection. Examples of these character types\n\nFrom Word to Image 39\n\nabound in all of the author's early stories and are too numerous to list. Their continued presence in his universe perpetuate a singular Calvinian point of view. Calvino's narrative point of view posits the spectacular, the visual, the act of seeing as a means of recapturing or creating the self through external identification. In all of Calvino's stories from this period, the subject is not the man of action but the lost soul, the man who has either forgotten or indeed has never known how to act effectively. These stories always open on a world shrouded in contrasts: light/dark; fantasy/real; young/old; earth/water. These contrasts draw attention to surface textures, never allowing psychological penetration, always highlighting the visual. Many of Calvino's early stories are dramatic because they highlight moments of decision by unsure and youthful characters. The stories focus on their will to participate, however marginally, in the action at hand. In later tales, however, the emphasis is placed on the spectator's ability to become an observing eye, to identify with extraordinary precision and disembodied sensations, the formal composition of ordered surfaces. The world for Calvino is a series of special frames that remind this reader of Leon Battista Alberti's idea that the canvas, like Calvino's white page, should function as a window on the world, a window that erects projective and protective screens.32 The reality he encodes is always (re)presented as spectacle. Far from being Nietzschian, Calvino expresses a Schopenhauerian tenet. For the Romantic philosopher, the artist was to remain outside of history. As Hayden White has summarized, genius was marked not by 'involvement in the historical process but in the capacity to remain a prime spectator.'33 Reality already possesses shades and nuances of the unreal; one need only to remain positioned outside of it to observe it, to freeze its mobility into comprehensive verbo-visual packets. This attitude causes the rhythm of the narration to overtake the story, rendering it immobile as, for example, in this monotonic paragraph from 'II reggimento smarrito':34 Fuori s'aperse la vista della citta, sotto un cielo celeste attraversato da morbide nuvole, la citta coi camini che perdevano baffi di fumo, i terrazzi con le corde irte di pinze per stendere la roba, i riflessi del raggi di sole che battevano sugli speech! del como, le tende cacciamosche che s'impigliano agli orecchini delle madame con la sporta, un carretto di gelataio con 1'ombrello e la scatola di vetro per i coni e raso terra un aquilone con le code di carta rossa inanellata che correva trascinato dai bambini per un\n\n40 Painting with Words, Writing with Pictures lungo spago e a poco a poco andava su nell'aria e si drizzava contro le morbide nuvole del cielo. Outside one could see the city beneath a blue sky traversed by soft clouds, the city with its chimneys that lost puffs of smoke, terraces with lines bristling with clothes pins, reflected rays of sunlight that beat agai"
