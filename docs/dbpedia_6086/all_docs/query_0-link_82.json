        "text": "Addressing a growing area of focus in contemporary art, Aesthetic Journalism investigates why contemporary art exhibitions often consist of interviews, documentaries, and reportage. Art theorist and critic Alfredo Cramerotti traces the shift in the production of truth from the domain of the news media to that of art and aestheticism – a change that questions the very foundations of journalism and the nature of art. This volume challenges the way we understand art and journalism in contemporary culture and suggests future developments of this new relationship.\n\nCase study of Yellow, a compilation of 52 different artists illustrating 52 pieces of news in 2015. The book was designed to demonstrate how illustration is more than an outlet for ‘pretty pictures’ and ‘that at its best, it can be as powerful as any photograph, piece of writing or fine art’ (Humphry and Leard, 2015, p.5). Through this medium the artists aimed to deliver their view on contemporary issues in a simple and direct way, whilst questioning the way news are processed, remembered and what remains important through and after the process of delivering information.\n\nRobert A.
