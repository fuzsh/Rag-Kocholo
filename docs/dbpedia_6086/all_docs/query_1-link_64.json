        "text": "The Annie Jump Cannon Video Project at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLupfer, C.; Welther, B. L.; Griswold, A.\n\n1993-05-01\n\nThe heart of this poster paper is the screening of the new 25-minute educational video, ``Annie and the Stars of Many Colors.'' It explores the life and work of Annie Jump Cannon through the eyes of sixth-grade students. A production of the Science Media Group at the CfA, the video was created to interest and inspire girls and minorities, in particular, to continue their study of history and physical science in high school. Recent studies show that science teachers are successfully using videotapes in the classroom to supplement traditional methods of teaching. Other reports show that capable girls and minority students tend to drop science in high school. Our goal, then, was to create a video to stimulate the curiosity and natural interest in science of these younger students. With the help of the Public Affairs Office at the CfA, we arranged to visit local schools to talk to sixth-grade science teachers and their students about the video project. Boys and girls were both eager to participate in it. By lottery, we chose a dozen youngsters of multi-cultural backgrounds to attend a three-day workshop, during which we videotaped them discovering facts about Cannon's childhood and career. Barbara Welther, historian and principal investigator, took the group to the Harvard University Archives to look at some Cannon memorabilia. To learn about spectra, each student assembled a spectroscope from a kit and observed solar lines. CfA astronomers then led the group in various activities to explore the types of stellar spectra that Cannon classified and published in The Henry Draper Catalogue 75 years ago.% and that astronomers still study today. ``Annie and the Stars of Many Colors'' shows young people actively engaged in the process of discovery and offers teachers a novel tool to stimulate discussion of topics in science, history, women's studies, and careers. It is intended for use in schools, libraries, museums, planetariums, as well as for personal interest.

The sculptures shown there were not static objects, but rather demonstrations of invisible concepts like relativity. What emerged in Anselmoâs first solo show and developed over the ensuing decade was a tactical resistance to the crystallization of his works into a single image or static object. This paper argues that this approach was also central to a critical understanding of the roles of the artist and the viewer during a time of great political foment in Italy and throughout Europe. I explore the relationship of Anselmoâs sculptural interests to the currency of phenomenology in Northern Italy, the theorization of Arte Povera, in which he figures as a central protagonist, as well as to the socio-political challenges of the 1970s in Italy. Between 1967 and 1978, Anselmo endeavored to reveal tense fullness in empty spaces and to discover latent energy in seemingly inert materials by activating the viewerâs ability to recognize them as small indications of a dynamic macrocosm. In the context of 1968 and the ensuing Anni di piombo, such macrocosmic glimpses might occasion a broadened worldview, in which the closed perceptual dialectic of self versus world could expand to include other, previously invisible, possibilities. From this expanded point of view prompted by Anselmoâs presentation of energies, one can begin to understand, and even undermine, man-made âinvisibleâ systems like government and class. By doing this through the form of the work rather than its explicit content, Anselmo models the notion of an artist using form as social commitment. This mode of working has resonance for many artists today, who may struggle with reconciling their material practices with political allegiances in an increasingly co-opted art market.\n\nCentocinquant'anni di cultura storico-antichistica in Piemonte (dalla restaurazione agli anni sessanta\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLellia CRACCO RUGGINI\n\n2010-02-01\n\nFull Text Available RESUMEN: Se ha comenzado a partir de los entusiasmos egiptizantes avivados en Turin por la estancia de Jean-FranÃ§ois Champollion en 1824-25 para estudiar papiros, inscripciones, monumentos jeroglÃ­ficos y coptos de excepcional importancia, que los Saboya habÃ­an adquirido hacÃ­a poco con la colecciÃ³n de Bernardino Drovetti y que habÃ­an depositado en el Museo de AntigÃ¼edades. El orgullo Â«patrioÂ» suscitado por el descubrimiento de estos tesoros tuvo consecuencias en las investigaciones y en la enseÃ±anza de la Historia Antigua, que se caracterizaron entonces, sobre todo,como investigaciÃ³n de la arqueologÃ­a del prÃ³ximo y medio Oriente. En semejante contexto tuvo lugar en 1848, en el marco de las reformas de las Bibliotecas, Academias y Universidades que en aquellos aÃ±os llevÃ³ a cabo Carlos Alberto, la instituciÃ³n de la primera cÃ¡tedra de Historia Antigua y ArqueologÃ­a en la Facultad de Letras de Turin (Francesco Barucchi, director del Museo de AntigÃ¼edades y Egipcio desde 1835 hasta su muerte en 1869, catedrÃ¡tico de 1848 a 1861. Este fue el lento trÃ¡nsito, en la Universidad, de una enseÃ±anza histÃ³rica peculiarmente intensa como escuela de Â«elocuenciaÂ» a una actividad didÃ¡ctica formativa, ademÃ¡s de secamente informativa, fundamentada en concretas bases filolÃ³gicas que hasta entonces se habÃ­an cultivado, de una manera u otra, tan sÃ³lo al margen de la Universidad, en las Academias, por personalidades cientÃ­ficas como el helenista-orientalista Amedeo Peyron o el jurista (alumno suyo Cario Baudi di Vesme. Al mismo tiempo, tambiÃ©n se iba incrementando el interÃ©s hacia los monumentos epigrÃ¡ficos, arqueolÃ³gicos y documentales localizables in loco e idÃ³neos para ilustrar glorias regionales antiquÃ­simas (prerromanas, romanas y romano-bÃ¡rbaras, en dialÃ©ctica con intereses geogrÃ¡fico-etnogrÃ¡ficos que incitaba, por entonces, la evoluciÃ³n de la situaciÃ³n polÃ­tica, econÃ³mica y social (Luigi Schiaparelli, catedrÃ¡tico de Historia Antigua desde 1862 hasta 1897. De la enseÃ±anza universitaria de la Historia Antigua se escindieron tanto la ArqueologÃ­a como las AntigÃ¼edades Orientales (1862, circunscribiendo, como consecuencia, la investigaciÃ³n histÃ³rico-arqueolÃ³gica Ãºnicamente al mundo mediterrÃ¡neo greco-romano. La presencia durante casi treinta aÃ±os en Turin del romano Gaetano De Sanctis como profesor de Historia Antigua en la Facultad de Letras (1900-29 y como director de la Rivista di Filologia e di Istruzione ClÃ ssica (1923-29 junto con el magisterio, luego, de uno de sus discÃ­pulos predilectos, el piamontÃ©s Arnaldo Momigliano (1936-38, supieron elevar la investigaciÃ³n y la didÃ¡ctica de la historia de la antigÃ¼edad a niveles internacionales por amplitud de intereses, por su severo rigor filolÃ³gico y por su vivaz inteligencia historiogrÃ fica. Tras la brusca expulsiÃ³n de Momigliano de la Universidad italiana en el otoÃ±o de 1938, como consecuencia de las leyes raciales (exiliado en Inglaterra, su personalidad cientÃ­fica continuÃ³ madurando con resultados suyos propios, ocupÃ³ su lugar la enseÃ±anza de la Historia Romana y Griega en la Universidad de Turin de Roberto Andreotti (1938-65: fue otra fase prolongada, didÃ¡cticamente escrupulosa pero cientÃ­ficamente opaca, que veintisiete aÃ±os mÃ¡s tarde se concluirÃ­a con la vuelta de Andreotti a Parma. El cauto atrincheramiento en la filologÃ­a no fue suficiente para evitar un rechazo recÃ­proco cada vez mÃ¡s evidente entre el catedrÃ¡tico y el ambiente acadÃ©mico piamontÃ©s que lo rodeaba, y con consecuencias mucho mÃ¡s desastrosas de las que, a nivel acadÃ©mico y humano, habÃ­an caracterizado tambiÃ©n la permanencia de De Sanctis en Turin. Este, por su parte, no habÃ­a conseguido nunca integrarse completamente en la ciudad de adopciÃ³n, y tras varios intentos de dejarla obtuvo el traslado definitivo a Roma, a la cÃ¡tedra que habÃ­a pertenecido a su venerado maestro Julius Beloch. De Sanctis, sin embargo, habÃ­a sabido aportar a los estudios de la antigÃ¼edad piamonteses -tal vez por primera vez- experiencias de amplio y fresco alcance que la renovarÃ­an como fecunda didÃ¡ctica de la investigaciÃ³n histÃ³rica, dejando una huella difÃ­cil de olvidar.ABSTRACT: It began with the enthusiasm for things Egyptian re-awakened in Turin by the stay in the city of FranÃ§ois Champollion in 1824-1825. He had come to study papyri, hieroglyphic and Coptic objects of exceptional importance recently acquired by the Savoy family with the collection of Bernardino Drovetti and placed in the Museum of Antiquities. The Â«patrioticÂ» pride aroused by the discovery of these treasures gave a new direction to research into Ancient History and to its teaching, which became principally an antiquarian investigation of the Near and Middle East. It was in this context that, in 1848, together with the reform of the libraries, academies and universities carried out by Carlo Alberto, the first chair of Ancient History and Archaeology was instituted in the Faculty of Letters of Turin. Its holder was Francesco Barucchi, director of the Museo di AntichitÃ ed Egizio from 1835 until his death in 1869. He held the new chair from 1848 to 1861. This was the beginning of the slow transformation of the teaching of history (previously conceived mainly as a school of Â«eloquenceÂ» towards a didactic activity more strictly formative as well as informative. The new model was founded on a solid philological basis. Until then such a basis was to be found to some extent only outside the universities, in the academies and in the work of scholars such as the historian of the Greek and Oriental worlds, Amedeo Peyron, or the jurist (his pupil Carlo Baudi di Vesme. Consequently there was also a simultaneous increase of interest in the epigraphical, archaeological and documentary evidence which could be found in loco and which might serve to illustrate the regional glories of distant antiquity (pre-Roman, Roman and Roman-barbaric in contrast with the geographical and ethnographical interests stimulated at that time by the ongoing developments in the economic, political and social situation (Luigi Schiaparelli, Professor of Ancient History in Turin from 1862 to 1897. It was then that the teaching of both Archaeology (I860 and of Oriental Antiquity (1862 were separated from that of Ancient History, thus circumscribing research in this field exclusively within the Greco-Roman Mediterranean world. The presence in Turin for almost thirty years of Gaetano De Sanctis from Rome as Professor of Ancient History in the Faculty of Letters (1900-1929 and as editor of the Rivista di Filologia e dilstruzione ClÃ ssica (1923-1929, followed by the teaching of one of his favourite pupils, the Piedmontese Arnaldo Momigliano (1936-1938, succeeded in elevating research and teaching in the field of Ancient History to international levels in breadth of interests, extreme philological rigour and lively historiographical intelligence. Momigliano was abruptly dismissed from the Italian University in the autumn of 1938 as a consequence of the race laws. During his exile in England his scientific work continued to mature and produce those results which characterised him. He was replaced as Professor of Greek and Roman History in the University of Turin by Roberto Andreotti (1938-1965. This was another very prolonged phase, marked by a scrupulous attention to teaching but of little scientific value. It came to an end with the return of Andreotti to Parma, a city to which he had been connected since his youth. A cautious withdrawal into the safety of philology, in fact, had not sufficed to prevent a mutual estrangement between the professor and the Piedmontese cultural milieu that surrounded him. The consequences were much more disastrous than those which, both academically and socially, had also distinguished the period De Sanctis had spent in Turin. The latter had never completely integrated into his adopted city and repeatedly tried to leave it until his definitive transfer to Rome to occupy the chair which had already belonged to his venerated master, Julius Beloch. However, De Sanctis had succeeded, perhaps for the first time, in creating within Piedmontese studies of the ancient world a wider and more invigorating approach that was to confer on them the character of a fecund teaching of historical research. He left an unforgettable mark.\n\nUtilization of Toxic Activities of Some Plant Oils for Increasing The Protection of Induced Tolerance Percentage With Gamma Rays to The Infestation by Sitophilus oryzae (L.)and Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) in two Wheat Irradiated Populations\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDarwish, A.A.A.; EI-Lakwah, F.A.M.; Ragab, A.I.; Boshra, S.A.; Mehany, A.L.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn this study, the grains of PG 400 were treated with different concentrations of essential oils for Clove flowering buds, Dill seeds, Pinus syluestris and Lemon grass. However grains of PS 400 were only treated with different concentrations of Annis seeds. The obtained result showed that adults mortality percentage increased by increasing concentration and exposure time of the tested insects. After 14 days from the initial treatment, mortalities were between 83.3-100, 86.7-100, 82.3-100, 71-100 and 74.3-100 % at all tested concentrations with Clove flowering buds, Dill seeds, Pinus syluestris, Lemon grass and Annis seeds, respectively. However ,reduction in the progeny of S. oryzae was between 57.23-100,57.25-100,59.55-100,56.85-100 and 52.51-100% for Clove flowering buds, Dill seeds, Pinus syluestris, Lemon grass and Annis seeds, respectively However for R. dominica ,the adults mortality after 14 days of initial treatment ranged from 36.7-100, 60-100, 82.3-100, 55.7-100 and 61-100 % the various concentrations of Clove flowering buds, Dill seeds, Pinus syluestris, Lemion grass and Annis, respectively. While their ,reduction in the progeny ranged from 42,24-100,53.16-100,48.38-100,63.89-100 and 55.18-100% at various concentrations of Clove flowering buds, Dill seeds, Pinus syluestris, Lemon grass and Annis, respectively. The obtained results showed that high concentration of different essential oils caused about 100% mortality and progeny reduction ,but the low concentration caused about 70% mortality and progeny reduction .This study suggesting that the low oil concentration could be used to increase the protection for irradiated tolerant populations PG 400 and PS 400 from the infestation with S. oryzae and R. dominica as a complementary tool for pest control .\n\nObituary: Gerald Frederick Tape, 1915-2005\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHughes, Robert E.\n\n2007-12-01\n\nGerald Frederick Tape, a distinguished science statesman and administrator, died on November 20, 2005. Jerry, as he was known to all, took on many diverse and important responsibilities throughout his life and dealt with them with quiet authority and grace. This was the hallmark of his life. The Board of Trustees of Associated Universities, Inc., which he served for many years, expressed this in its condolences, writing \"Jerry personified integrity, thoroughness and dedication. His sensitivity for the views of others, his sincerity, his personal commitment, his calm approach and his unfailing good humor were all greatly admired and respected.\" Jerry was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan on May 29, 1915 but grew up in Milan, a nearby country farm community, and in Ypsilanti where his father was Principal of Michigan State Normal College, which later became Eastern Michigan University (EMU). It was there that he first became interested in physics. It was there also that he met and courted Josephine Waffen, who later would become his wife for more than sixty-six years and fill their lives with three loving sons, Walter, James, and Thomas. Upon graduation from EMU, Jerry was awarded a scholarship that took him to the University of Michigan where he earned a Ph.D. in Physics, researching the decay modes of the radioisotopes of iodine. In the Fall of 1939, during the waning days of the Great Depression, he was offered an Instructorship in the Physics Department of Cornell University, a promising start for a fruitful academic career. He brought his bride Jo to Ithaca and joined the cyclotron group under Robert Bacher and Willy Higginbotham while devising a laboratory course in nuclear techniques for graduate students. Bacher and Higginbotham soon left Cornell to join a new wartime laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and many other colleagues were \"drafted\" for war work. Bacher persuaded Jerry to join him at the MIT Radiation Laboratory in February\n\nJerome Lewis Duggan: A Nuclear Physicist and a Well-Known, Six-Decade Accelerator Application Conference (CAARI) Organizer\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDel McDaniel, Floyd; Doyle, Barney L.\n\nJerry Duggan was an experimental MeV-accelerator-based nuclear and atomic physicist who, over the past few decades, played a key role in the important transition of this field from basic to applied physics. His fascination for and application of particle accelerators spanned almost 60 years, and led to important discoveries in the following fields: accelerator-based analysis (accelerator mass spectrometry, ion beam techniques, nuclear-based analysis, nuclear microprobes, neutron techniques); accelerator facilities, stewardship, and technology development; accelerator applications (industrial, medical, security and defense, and teaching with accelerators); applied research with accelerators (advanced synthesis and modification, radiation effects, nanosciences and technology); physics research (atomic and molecular physics, and nuclear physics); and many other areas and applications. Here we describe Jerryâs physics education at the University of North Texas (B. S. and M. S.) and Louisiana State University (Ph.D.). We also discuss his research at UNT, LSU, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, his involvement with the industrial aspects of accelerators, and his impact on many graduate students, colleagues at UNT and other universities, national laboratories, and industry and acquaintances around the world. Along the way, we found it hard not to also talk about his love of family, sports, fishing, and other recreational activities. While these were significant accomplishments in his life, Jerry will be most remembered for his insight in starting and his industry in maintaining and growing what became one of the most diverse accelerator conferences in the world â the International Conference on the Application of Accelerators in Research and Industry, or what we all know as CAARI. Through this conference, which he ran almost single-handed for decades, Jerry came to know, and became well known by, literally thousands of atomic and nuclear physicists, accelerator\n\nFirst SN Discoveries from the Dark Energy Survey\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAbbott, T.; Abdalla, F.; Achitouv, I.; Ahn, E.; Aldering, G.; Allam, S.; Alonso, D.; Amara, A.; Annis, J.; Antonik, M.; Aragon-Salamanca, A.; Armstrong, R.; Ashall, C.; Asorey, J.; Bacon, D.; Balbinot, E.; Banerji, M.; Barbary, K.; Barkhouse, W.; Baruah, L.; Bauer, A.; Bechtol, K.; Becker, M.; Bender, R.; Benoist, C.; Benoit-Levy, A.; Bernardi, M.; Bernstein, G.; Bernstein, J.
