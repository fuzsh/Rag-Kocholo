As Giacomo Marramao wrote, “Bitter is the fate of disorganic intellectuals, the only intellectuals worthy of the name: to be the cause of scandal for the Right as well as for the Left, even after having provided both with the weapons of criticism against any type of reification” (Baldoni and Borgna 2010, 10).1 Indeed, Pasolini’s body of work remains a monument to the disorganic intellectual who cannot be assimilated by the body of the nation: like his own violated body, Pasolini’s oeuvre represents an uncanny source of inspiration and uneasiness, a haunting presence in Italy’s cultural landscape. As poet, novelist, dramatist, polemicist, filmmaker, and polymorphous intellectual, Pasolini recorded – and significantly moulded – the dynamics of thirty years of Italian culture and history. With his writing, his cinematic eye, and his visceral engagement with the socio-political reality of the nation, he probed Italy and the Italians, playing the roles of apocalyptic prophet, nostalgic aesthete, and even scandalous scapegoat. Italy has been unable to mourn his death: like a Shakespearean ghost, Pasolini continues to haunt political and cultural discourse. He has resurfaced in novels, graphic novels, television debates, and court documents as an enigma no one seems able to solve. Yet attempts to do so proliferate, rivaling the number of pages in his own monumental opera omnia. The body of Pasolini, according to Pasolini scholars today, appears as the erotic, the sodomitical, the initiated body. His writings and his films were completely enmeshed with his corporeality and its desires. He was\n\n4 Pasolini: The Sacred Flesh\n\nconsumed by his passion for reality as incarnated in life, in young men, in the poor. His corpus was cinematic, literary, and poetic: he was his filmic eye as much as his writing hand, his many languages, his fascination with signs. Moreover, the body was central to his poetics: it was a poetics of Incarnation. In this volume I explore the incarnational matrix of Pasolini’s oeuvre, addressing his immanent and corporeal vision of the sacred in his works in cinema and literature between the late 1950s and the late 1960s, in the years of the Italian economic boom. In a 1969 interview with Giuseppe Cardillo, Pasolini expressed his immanent vision of the sacred in the clearest of terms (Cardillo, in Chiesi and Mancini 2007, 89–90): [GC]: Hmmm. You’re a secularist, an agnostic. [PP]: … and an atheist. I am agnostic on the question of God. I don’t make an issue of defining who he is. That would be dishonest for someone who does not believe in God. [GC]: But you’re religious. You believe in the divine and say that your works are religious and divine. So there is a contradiction when you say that you believe in the objective and not in the substantive. [PP]: There’s no contradiction. Ancient, preindustrial man could feel the presence of the sacred in any object, in an event, at any level of his life. Divine manifestations in the stones, the trees, the neighbors, anything. [GC]: So what do you mean by the sacred? The root of all things? [PP]: Nowadays the sacred world of the peasant has obviously fallen. It’s a world I was born into, but as I grew up, I entered another world, an industrial world, dominated by reason, secularism. The contradiction in me is that I still see reality as an apparition. I could explain this contradiction in terms taken from a philosophy manual by saying that my religion is a form of immanentism. I don’t believe in a transcendental God, but since reality is a divine apparition, then reality itself is God. […] The point is that reality is a language. So for me – sentimentally, intuitively – reality is a divine apparition. Through this line of reasoning, reality becomes not an apparition of the divine, but rather a sacred language. But the sacred language of who? [GC]: In The Gospel According to Saint Matthew, it says “in principio erat verbum …” [PP]: You could write a whole book giving linguistic analyses of the word verbum. Since I am not a believer, reality is the language of itself. Reality is divine in and of itself. For a believer, my theory is very evocative […].\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nRecent scholarship on Pasolini has identified some constant elements within his poetics of the sacred. One is indeed the link between the sacred and language, as developed in Giuseppe Conti Calabrese’s 1994 Pasolini e il sacro, the first book to bring full attention to the sacred dimension of Pasolini’s work. In it Calabrese reconstructed Pasolini’s approach to this theme with a reading that sought, using the director’s own terms and words, “to think with Pasolini beyond Pasolini” (14). There is in Pasolini a primordial, ancestral link between life and language that is grounded in and receives nourishment from that mysterious and obscure source from which corporeality and sex blossom … The trace that surfaces is that of a thinking poetry which, in the awareness of the loss of the sacred …, invokes its new advent, disquieted and stimulated from the necessity to rethink it [the sacred] as the unity of presence and absence.” (10–11)2\n\nSam Rohdie developed another meditation on the connection among language, the sacred, and reality in Pasolini in his 1995 The Passion of Pier Paolo Pasolini, in which he commented that “Pasolini’s regressions were ways to go forward … [He] was trying to disrupt representational forms with poetic ones. He wanted … to revive a sense of sacredness” (9). Pasolini’s violation of reality, Rhodie argued, was a way for him to create a “linguistic simulacrum of it,” a language that would allow him to proclaim a reality beyond that same language, which for him was the site both of the alienation of reality and the celebration of its becoming real, of its loss and its recovery. Conti Calabrese was the first to investigate the sources of Pasolini’s interpretation of the sacred, and in particular the influence on him of the thought of Mircea Eliade and George Bataille. Tommaso Subini, in his La necessità di morire: Il cinema di Pasolini e il sacro (2008), followed suit, recognizing the impact of Italian ethno-anthropologist Ernesto De Martino’s historicist theories on Pasolini’s earlier works (in addition to the Eliadian irrationalist interpretation of the sacred, voiced in Pasolini’s late productions). Eliade’s and De Martino’s “sacred” are also at the core of Armando Maggi’s study The Resurrection of the Body: Pier Paolo Pasolini from Saint Paul to Sade (2009). According to Maggi, however, Pasolini misinterprets De Martino’s thought when he attempts to distinguish between the angst of the primitive individual and that of the modern individual provoked by what De Martino conceptualized as a “crisis of presence.” In Maggi’s opinion, both De Martino’s primitives and moderns confront\n\n6 Pasolini: The Sacred Flesh\n\nthe same crisis of a “void threatening the subject,” the difference being that the old apparatuses of myth and the sacred no longer work as ways to overcome the “void” of history in the context of modernity (9). Scholars have also considered a third aspect of Pasolini’s sacred, its relationship with traditional religious discourse, especially in the context of his revival of central Christian themes. For example, in his Vital Crises in Italian Cinema (1995), Paul Adam Sitney characterized Pasolini’s Accattone as a form of hagiography and Accattone himself as a parodic saint. Around the same time, in the 1995 proceedings of a conference on Pasolini and the sacred held in Venzone, Italy, Remo Cacitti pointed out the parallel between Pasolini’s vision of the sacred and the theological debate on the “death of God” in the 1960s. More recently, the sacrificial paradigm of the scapegoat as a central feature of Pasolini’s sacred was the focus of Stefania Rimini’s La ferita e l’assenza (2007). Rimini investigated the theme of martyrdom in Pasolini’s work, interpreting it as a phenomenon caught between the word’s etymological meaning, that is, witnessing, and its embodiment in the figures of fate, violence, redemption, ritual, and holocaust. Her reading was based on a “transcendent” interpretation of Pasolini’s sacred, an interpretation that also guided Tommaso Subini’s La necessità di morire, in which the author centred his inquiry on death as the crucial image of Pasolini’s sacred, and on the myth of the death and resurrection of Christ as the antidote to the crisis of presence death provokes. A fourth element of Pasolini’s vision of the sacred developed by recent scholarship is the role of forces operating on the margins of history. In Sex, the Self and the Sacred (2007), Colleen Ryan-Scheutz highlighted the connection between sacred and authenticity in Pasolini, analysing the general process of desecration in the global configuration of neo-capitalism, and identifying the signifiers of this threatened or lost authenticity (especially in terms of the sacred) in women and in “the female sphere.” Also important is Armando Maggi’s The Resurrection of the Body: Pier Paolo Pasolini from Saint Paul to Sade, which considered Pasolini’s later productions in literature and film, exploring his apocalypticism, focusing on his homosexuality, and discussing his “sodomitical flesh” as the flesh that, according to St Paul, “needs to die and resurrect,” “arising at the end of time” (12). In my analysis, I shift the existing interpretations of Pasolini’s sacred from the perspective of the resurrection – either of the sodomitical flesh or of the sacrificial Christ – to that of the Incarnation and to the immanent dimension of “the Sacred Flesh,” as exemplified by the Crucifixion and by the death of God.\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nThe Incarnation, sanctity, the concept of agape, or caritas, and the Apocalypse are aspects of Christian doctrine that still influence contemporary thought, not only in theology but also in radical and materialist philosophy, as proof of the centrality and relevance of the debate about the sacred today. Many theorists of the sacred, such as Ernesto De Martino, Mircea Eliade, Jean-Luc Nancy, Alain Badiou, Giorgio Agamben, and Slavoj Žižek, have made these themes a central axis of investigation. Pasolini’s exploration and appropriation of Christian themes anticipated by thirty years contemporary radical theology and its reading of Christian tropes as a crucial critique of late capitalism. This perspective appears, for instance, in Žižek’s thought, which is inscribed in the theological tradition that follows Hegel’s critique of transcendence through Thomas J.J. Altizer and the “theology of the death of God” he developed in the 1960s. As Boscalijon explained in distinctly “Pasolinian” terms: Altizer’s innovation was to reinterpret the Christian passion in terms of a Godhead who dies, absolutely, pouring himself out kenotically and resurrected in and as the material universe … The powerful declaration of the death of the transcendental God is unique as it eliminates the divine work of serving as an external guarantor of meaning; combined with a theologically grounded respect for a divinization of the world in which things mean only themselves (having nothing to point toward), Altizer can be seen as preparing a new way to think of all objects as potential hierophanies. (2010, 4)\n\nŽižek returned to Altizer’s claims and his absolute kenosis to establish what has been defined as his “atheist theology.” “My claim here is not that I am a materialist through and through, and that the subversive kernel of Christianity is accessible also to a materialist approach,” he wrote in The Puppet and the Dwarf (2003); “my thesis is much stronger: this kernel is accessible only to a materialist approach – and vice versa: to become a true dialectical materialist, one should go through the Christian experience” (6). The God of philosophy dies, as does his role as the “overarching system of meaning” (Boscalijon 2010, 8). It is a God that cannot stop human suffering, but watches it with compassion. It is the suffering Christ of the theology of Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906–1945). It is a God that offers the only gift he can offer: the gift of himself. God doesn’t give what he has, he gives what he is, his very being … From a proper theological perspective, God is the poorest of them all: he “has” only\n\n8 Pasolini: The Sacred Flesh his being to give away. His whole wealth is already out there, in creation. (Žižek 2009, 59)\n\nGod takes our suffering seriously and engages in our history, participating in it with his Passion. His kenosis entrusts humanity with the gift of radical freedom – the freedom “to choose death” would say Pasolini. No longer grounded in the “God of Beyond,” we are given love, agape, which Žižek defined in a political key: “Agape as political love means that unconditional, egalitarian love for one’s neighbour can serve as the foundation for a new order” (2011, 2). For Žižek, Christ dies and his resurrection is the Holy Spirit, which consists of the love for our neighbour, since in Boscalijon’s explanation, “the bodies of the believers become the immanent, material reality of the resurrected Godhead” (2010, 10). The “politics of love” predicated by Žižek becomes, in the reading of Lorenzo Chiesa and Alberto Toscano inspired by Pasolini, an interpretation of agape as a “politics of poverty” against the hedonistic world of neo-capitalism (2007, 116). In light of these theories, Pasolini’s immanent vision of the sacred anticipated – and at times served as an inspiration for – the dialogue between immanence and transcendence and between philosophy (in particular materialist thought) and theology. A fundamental aspect of Pasolini’s political, poetical, and philosophical project, this immanent vision contributes to the founding of a materialist notion of the sacred and can be mobilized in contemporary theory to identify a Christian political legacy within the spectrum of anticapitalist subversion and leftist militancy and as the core of an atheist theology. Pasolini’s theory of the sacred could be seen as a key contribution to this specific debate. In turn, these philosophers are crucial to understanding Pasolini’s theory of the sacred. According to Pasolini, the sacred does not belong to a transcendental horizon but, rather, pertains to a hic et nunc corporeal dimension, which inscribes in the flesh – in its eros and even more in its thanatos, in its scandalous finitude – the presence of the real. The flesh is the site “of pleasure and pain, suffering and jouissance, passivity and mortality” (Caputo 2010, 9), distinct from the body considered as the site of agency, action, and movement. “Flesh aches with hunger but flesh … is also eaten, flesh is meat, flesh is corpulence, flesh is inseparable from blood, flesh is voluptuous, and when we die, it is flesh that rots (first) and stinks (10). In my inquiry into Pier Paolo Pasolini’s engagement with the sacred, I examine his tragic subproletarian “Sacred Flesh” as an expression of\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nthe central scandal of Christian theology, the scandal of the Incarnation, the shocking corporeality of Christ in Passion and death, and the self-annihilation of God. The body at the centre of Pasolini’s work is the incarnated body of Christ stripped of any hope for resurrection or redemption. Christ becomes the subproletarian flesh, agonizing in a commodified, hopeless world. The flesh that dies also embodies, on its surface, the full presence of life in all its vitality and energy, in total exposure. Pasolini’s understanding of the sacred as a heretical vision, expressed in the sacredness of the Flesh, focuses specifically on the mystery of the Incarnation as a foundational model. The only possible fate is the cross, with no other reality than the tragedy and the epic grandeur of human mortality, which makes a story, a destiny, a human life out of our inconclusive actions and incomprehensible trajectories. Furthermore, Pasolini’s vision of the “incarnated body” participates in a longstanding interpretation of the theme of the Incarnation in Italian literature and culture embodied, for example, in the works of writers such as Clemente Rebora and David Maria Turoldo, discussed by Fabio Finotti (1993, 1997, 2007). However, there is an important difference: Pasolini’s immanent and atheistic perspective excludes any intervention of grace. Christ’s death is thus connected with the Pasolinian heroes’ fate, without promise of salvation. As Fabio Vighi’s reading of Accattone highlights, Accattone dies like Hegel’s Christ: behind his death there is no suprasensible bliss, no transcendental salvation, but rather the universalization of humanity through the sublation of negativity … Accattone’s “Christ-like” sacrifice is significant precisely because it fully endorses negativity as immanent substance, quite differently from the Christian dogma of transcendence and sublimation. (2003, 116)\n\nIn light of a poetics of the Incarnation, in my discussion of Pasolini’s “theology of image” – a concept I borrow from Noah Steimatsky (2008) – I show how the filmmaker searched for an effect of transubstantiation within the cinematic frame. In Pasolini, film becomes like the very first icon, a direct imprinting of Christ’s body into an image. The theology of the image focuses precisely on the acheiropoietic icon, the ultimate indexical proof of Christ’s Incarnation, through the emanation of an image of his body. Rather than reading the Crucifixion as an icon of a transcendent reality that generates a genealogy of devotional images, as Steimatsky does, I interpret it as an immanent structure that creates\n\n10 Pasolini: The Sacred Flesh\n\nspace for the event of the Incarnation through a “production of presence.” This concept, elaborated by Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht (2004, xiii), refers to “a spatial relationship to the world and its objects.” Both the etymology of presence – from the Latin prae-esse, to be in front of us, “in reach of and tangible for our bodies” – and of production – from the Latin pro-ducere, “to bring forth,” “to pull forth” (17) – allude to an effect of tangibility that is based on the materialities of communication, on movements of variable proximity and intensity. As an alternative to meaning, Gumbrecht drafts a different typology, defining four kinds of world appropriation by humans: eating, penetrating, mysticism, and deliberate openness to possession. These modalities are reminiscent of Pasolini’s vision of cinema as the “Eye-Mouth”3 device that cannibalistically devours reality, and of a reality as if perceived through a mechanism of violent possession of and by reality itself. The writer-director is on the front line of fire in these explosive encounters, this monumental wrestling between the feeling subject and the devouring, all-encompassing reality. The Incarnation is the epitome of this phenomenon: it is where God is substantiated into the dying body of Christ, his dying flesh. For Pasolini there is no resurrection, only the tragic greatness of death on the cross. The Incarnation is also the sacred matrix of Pasolini’s stylistic choices, particularly his persistent interest in contamination. It is at the root of contaminating practices such as free indirect discourse and the cinematic free, indirect point-of-view shot, typical features of Pasolini’s poetics of synoeciosis (Fortini 1993), a rhetoric figure in which one simultaneously gives expression to opposite meanings that operate in tension with one another. The incarnated body comes back to life in Pasolini’s crucified Christs or in his heretical, mad, or criminal saints – representations of what I call “subversive hagiographies,” or a series of twisted Imitationes Christi. In my retracing of Christian themes within Pasolini’s oeuvre, I identify two specific models of sainthood – the Franciscan and the Pauline – as exemplified in a collection of films and scripts, from Bestemmia (Blasphemy, 1962–67) and Uccellacci e uccellini (The Hawks and the Sparrows, 1967) to San Paolo (Saint Paul, 1968–74). They incorporate the human lesson of agape, in which Marxism and Catholicism converge, embracing the non-believing other. I focus mainly on Pasolini’s poetic and cinematic production during the age of the Italian economic miracle (the late 1950s and 1960s), but I also refer to the last period of Pasolini’s work (early 1970s), produced in what he defined as the “horrendous universe” of neo-capitalism. Other\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nscholars, such as Serafino Murri, inspired by the Frankfurt School’s theorists – from Walter Benjamin to Theodor Adorno – and their critique of the effects of industrial society, have provided a Marxist interpretation of Pasolini and his work. However, as this study demonstrates, for Pasolini this new industrial order represented first and foremost the worst enemy of the sacred: the commodification of objects and relationships that had replaced the sacredness of life. In Pasolini, the sacred is repressed under a new, omnipresent consumerism: the miracle has become the economic miracle, and the sacred is configured as a return to origins, a passion for the past that is not nostalgia but becomes a revolutionary memento for the present. During the years of the economic boom, Pasolini shifted from the national-popular cinema of his Roman films (Accattone, 1961; Mamma Roma, 1962; La Ricotta, 1963) to the cinema d’elite, and drafted his film theory and his general semiology of reality in a series of essays, later published in the volume Empirismo eretico (Heretical Empiricism, 1972). These theoretical formulations about cinema and semiology intersected his evolving and contradictory notion of the sacred, caught between a strong immanent perspective and occasional temptations of transcendence. These are the years of the dialogue between Marxists and Catholics, particularly in Italy and France, of the Second Vatican Council, and of John XXIII. Pasolini represents the corporeal arena of this debate, embodying its ascent with Il Vangelo secondo Matteo (The Gospel According to Matthew, 1964), and its sudden interruption with Teorema (Theorem, 1968) and with the failed production of his project on St Paul. Here I trace Pasolini’s path by analysing his films, scripts, poems, and interviews and by reconstructing his poetics through his continuous and insistent declarations of intent. I quote extensively from Pasolini’s works, not only to map out these authorial interpretations but also to make these documents available to an English-speaking audience. Chapter 1, “The Sense of the Sacred,” sets the theoretical foundation of this work, examining Pasolini’s concept of the sacred through his interviews and films, in particular Medea (1969). Pasolini’s archaic vision of the sacred – which draws on Mircea Eliade’s and Ernesto De Martino’s anthropological theories, from both a transcendent and an immanent standpoint – contrasts and at the same time converges with the Christian sacred. It retains the violence in the archaic sacred while adopting the Christian focus on the victims, placing them in dialogue with Marxist ideals. In the Johannine age of Vatican II, Pasolini finds a point of contact between Marxism and Catholicism in the concept of caritas, or agape,\n\n12 Pasolini: The Sacred Flesh\n\nwhile rejecting the other two Christian dimensions of hope and faith. In this context, I note how his immanent vision of the sacred is aligned with the recent debates in radical theology and materialist thought, particularly with Žižek’s interpretation of Christianity as the true core of materialist philosophy, according to which “to become a true dialectical materialist, one should go through the Christian experience” (Žižek 2003, 6). The chapter also delineates the relationship between Pasolini and the Vatican through his depiction of three different popes (Pius XII, John XXIII, and Paul VI) as a reflection of the contemporary debate between Marxists and Catholics in Italy. I chart the course of this relationship from initial hostility, through open reciprocity, to a final diffidence and separation. Chapter 2, “The Passion and the Incarnation,” focuses on different Pasolinian Christs and analyses the Incarnation at the moment of the Crucifixion. I concentrate on the Crucifixion scenes of Pasolini’s Christs in La Ricotta (Ricotta, 1963) and Il Vangelo secondo Matteo. Here the Christ figures are caught between the consecration of a starving subproletarian “Good Thief” who dies on the cross on the set of a cinematic rendition of Christ’s Passion, and the analogical reconstruction of the life, death, and resurrection of the Christian Saviour, seen through the eyes of a believer and the camera of an atheist director. In this context, I analyse Pasolini’s “contaminated” cinematic style, based on the subjective, indirect point-of-view shot, and the nature of his “aesthetic” sense of spirituality. Accused by the Vatican of demonstrating contempt for state religion in La Ricotta while being praised by the Church for Il Vangelo, Pasolini continued to oscillate between the stake and the altar through the obscenely hungry “Christ” embodied by the film extra Stracci in La Ricotta and the revolutionary, “Leninist” Christ portrayed in Il Vangelo. In one, the Crucifixion scene reverberates with the tragic fate of the poor, in the other with the desperate cry of abandonment of Christ on the cross. Shot sometimes frontally, sometimes with zooms and lenses normally used to film bike races, Il Vangelo resonates like a Mozart mass, while Stracci’s death in La Ricotta is commented upon by the music of a frantic twist, reduced to a still life with a wheel of ricotta cheese – the instrument of martyrdom – in the foreground. The God of La Ricotta observes in impotence, while the God of Il Vangelo watches at a distance. Christ is all too human, whether poor subproletarian flesh or parrhesiastes preacher,4 equally condemned by mocking crowds. Chapter 3, “The Words of the Flesh,” investigates the “barbaric” Christology offered in Pasolini’s verse script, Bestemmia (Blasphemy), which\n\nIntroduction 13\n\noccupied the director’s imagination for five years (1962–67) but was never produced as a film. Here Pasolini imagines the protagonist, the scoundrel Bestemmia, having a vision of the Passion after an orgy, and writes a long digression about it. I compare this Crucifixion scene with the erotic one Pasolini described in his poem “Crucifixion” in L’usignolo della Chiesa cattolica (The nightingale of the Catholic Church, 1958), where the eroticized spectacle of the publicly displayed sacrifice is all about the intensity and exposure of the Flesh. As Michael Hardt points out, highlighting the vitality of its immanent transcendence in “Exposure: Pasolini in the Flesh” (2002), Pasolini’s Christology of the Flesh is dedicated to revealing the humanity of Christ, the kenotic self-emptying into an agonizing body. Through the Passion evoked in the verses of Bestemmia’s vision, Pasolini claims a cinematic presence – again a production of presence – that actualizes the Event, that is, the encounter of humankind with the Death of the God/Man. This production of presence calls into question the semiotic status of cinema: it is not by chance that these were the years of Pasolini’s meditations on film in Empirismo eretico. His “words of the Flesh” suggest a preverbal and pregrammatical world where bodies speak, a world resembling the vision of cinema proposed by Gilles Deleuze. As Giuliana Bruno and Noah Steimatsky have stated, the corporeality of Pasolini’s cinematic signs represents his legacy to contemporary semiotics. A pervasive aspect of Pasolini’s Passions is his fascination with violent images. Jean-Luc Nancy in The Ground of the Image (2005) has argued that such violent content corresponds to the violence embedded in the production of presence that constitutes the image itself. Through reflection on the Passion, we may come to understand the importance of death in Pasolini’s poetics and cinema: death is what transforms our illegibility into destiny, into a story. It is like montage in cinema; it is what makes us human. Also, it may be argued that art is created inscribed within a horizon of death, more precisely, in response to the death-drive. The artist and his accomplices, the spectators, are inspired by the “freedom to choose death” (SLA1, 1600; HE, 267), always positioning themselves on the battlefield, always causing scandal. Eroticism and the death-drive return to the centre of Pasolini’s incarnational imagination. In Chapter 4, “The Mad Saint and the Anchorite,” I trace the devastating impact of the “encounter” with the sacred in the five protagonists of Teorema (Theorem, 1968), in both the film and the novel. These characters correspond to figures of expulsion: the madwoman, the saint, the prostitute, the artist, and the prophet. They take on these roles after their\n\n14 Pasolini: The Sacred Flesh\n\nencounter with a sixth character – at once a mysterious guest, a visiting figure, a kind of “exterminating Angel” on a mission against the inauthenticity of the Italian bourgeoisie. Drawing on the Girardian theory of mimetic desire, I focus on the maid Emilia and on the rich industrialist and patriarch of the bourgeois family, Paolo. Emilia and Paolo are both on a sacred path, the first as a crazy saint and the latter as an anchorite in the desert of the real. After their encounter with the guest and his eventual departure, they suffer a crisis resulting from the loss of the sacred he embodied: Emilia embraces a destiny of liquefaction in a miraculous fountain of tears, as the fluid sacrificial subtext of a residual peasant and proletarian world; Paolo faces the petrification of his own deserted and annihilated bourgeois subjectivity, transfixed by his transition into a nothingness that awaits a return of the sacred, invoked but indefinitely revoked. I present one of Pasolini’s models of sanctity in Chapter 5, “The Franciscan Model,” where I contextualize Pasolini’s work from 1962 to 1967. The chapter begins by comparing other films on St Francis produced in Italy, such as Roberto Rossellini’s Francesco Giullare di Dio (God’s Jester, 1950) and Liliana Cavani’s Francesco di Assisi (Francis of Assisi, 1966). My analysis establishes a parallel between Pasolini’s meditation on the Franciscan model and his cinematic essays of the 1960s, later published in the volume Empirismo eretico (1972). I concentrate on comparing Pasolini’s \"own\" realism with the neo-realist tradition. I also compare Pasolini’s comic and tragic Franciscanism in Bestemmia and Uccellacci e uccellini with the Franciscan model proposed by Hardt and Negri, which interprets Francis as the ultimate militant communist subject. The final chapter, entitled “The Pauline Model,” explores Pasolini’s appropriation of the apostle as his own cinematic alter ego, as evidenced by his unfilmed project San Paolo (Saint Paul, 1966–68, 1974; published posthumously in 1977). For Pasolini, St Paul has a schizophrenic personality: he is both saint and priest. As a saint, he is tormented by his homosexuality, but it is precisely through this sexual difference that his saintliness manifests itself as the union of eros and agape. As the priest who will help to found the Church, he is an unwitting agent of satanic forces. Another paradox in Pasolini’s St Paul is the ultimate irrelevance of his sacred word, despite the fact that its real, relevant, absolute meaning still resonates in the disenchanted, alienated world of neo-capitalism. Paul dies, but his bleeding heart is aflame with charity, an apotheosis that materialist thought (Žižek and Badiou,5 for instance) still interrogates\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nand re-elaborates. Paul embodies both the scandal of the cross and the scandal of power: he is a man of the Church as an institution and – through the “sickness” and “weakness” of his sexual difference – he is a revolutionary saint, a possible paradigm for the modern militant. Pasolini also plays on the ambivalence of saintliness, writing stories of criminal saints, cheaters, and pretenders of the sacred who achieve saintliness despite their dishonesty and cynicism. His parodies of the Pauline model play with satanic investitures. The result is always the victory of the sacred – either benign or demonic – and the defeat of the cynical protagonist through his/her own sacrifice. Overall, in these chapters I investigate the incarnational matrix of Pasolini’s imagination, both in cinema and in literature, and as it develops in theoretical writings and interviews. I demonstrate that the selfemptying god, the dying god without any hope of a possible eschaton, is at the centre of Pasolini’s sacred, caught between the violent sacred of the pagan past and the Christian sacred interpreted in an immanent heretical key. The sacred emerges as a threatened but powerful hidden reality. It inhabits the foundations of our world and resurfaces ghostlike through the cracks of global neo-capitalism. It re-emerges in the sacred flesh of the underprivileged, who, as forgotten Christs, die every day in obscurity. It resurfaces in the body of Pasolini himself, the intellectual sacrificed for his own courageous difference, his dangerous solitude, his ideological independence, his passion for truth, his vital yet destructive desire to choose his own death. If his death-drive moulded his art, Pasolini nevertheless did not choose to die on the night between 1 and 2 November 1975. Officially, there was only one killer, the “ragazzo di vita” (street youth) Pino Pelosi. In reality, in Ostia that night there was a virtual public execution, repeated in the interpretations of that death by many intellectuals, including some of Pasolini’s supporters. The painter Giuseppe Zigaina, a close friend of Pasolini, wrote five books insisting on the story of a liturgical deadly script that Pasolini enacted of his own free will that night, a sacrificial script retraceable throughout his oeuvre. That reading of Pasolini’s murder is undermined by Carla Benedetti and Giovanni Giovannetti in their 2012 pamphlet emblematically titled Frocio e basta, (Faggot, that’s it), in which the two authors propose the hypothesis of a political assassination. Pasolini may have been aware of uncomfortable truths about the homicide of Enrico Mattei, director of ENI (Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi), who died in 1962 when a bomb likely exploded on his plane. Eugenio Cefis, Mattei’s successor, is one of the protagonists of Pasolini’s Petrolio,\n\n16 Pasolini: The Sacred Flesh\n\nthe mastermind of the new power that would turn Italy into “a horribly dirty country.” Pasolini troubles Italians with his inassimilable body-corpse: a tragic reminder of the agony of a nation born out of the Resistance and deeply wounded by the state terrorism known as the “strategy of tension,” which was as deadly, according to Pasolini, as the nation’s devotion to consumerism. As much as Pasolini’s corpse haunts the conscience of Italy, the body of his work constitutes a reservoir of lucid awareness, of prophetic clairvoyance, and, quoting Pasolini, of a “desperate vitality” (PFR, TP1, 1182). It is a meditation on our past, our present, our future, a vital legacy for all of us. Finally, I understand the risk of interpreting Pasolini’s vision of the sacred from within his own theoretical horizon. Nevertheless, I consider Pasolini a crucial interpreter of the sacred in Italian culture who grounded his vision, as he describes it, in an agrarian and archaic civilization, from the contadini (peasants) of his beloved Friuli, to the uprooted peasantry of Rome’s subproletarian peripheries, to the masses of the Mediterranean and the Third World. Maybe Pasolini’s dystopian vision of a fully bourgeois future society could be read as too apocalyptic, predicated as it was on his idiosyncratic nostalgia for the peasant world tied to his youth and deeply transformed by modernity. Nevertheless, I believe that Pasolini investigated the anthropological fabric of the Italian society of his time – and gave voice and representation to social groups that were obscured or silenced on the cinematic screen as well as on the political scene – like no other director. Pasolini expressed the archaic sacred embodied in these remnants of the Italian peasantry, their tragic fatalism, and their innocent violence with an evangelical and visceral flatus that was unique in the Italian cultural landscape of the time. In the war’s aftermath, neo-realism had brought the hardships of the lower classes onto the screen; Pasolini’s cinema stressed their outcast role in the social map of the affluent Italy of the economic boom, and their destiny as designated victims of history. His films are both homage to and requiem for a disappearing civilization that still inhabits Italy’s social dynamics. From this anthropological mapping, Pasolini created unforgettable artistic interpretations of that impossible combination of archaic and modern that constitutes Italian culture. In his recent pamphlet, significantly entitled Dimenticare Pasolini (Forgetting Pasolini, 2013), Pierpaolo Antonello interrogates Pasolini’s contemporary intellectual legacy. Antonello interprets the “hagiographical” turn of some studies on Pasolini as the expression of a vertical and elitist revival of the traditional\n\nIntroduction 17\n\nfigure of the “vate” (prophet) intellectual. The role of the prophet of the nation, even when conceived within the framework of an apocalyptic ethics of rifiuto – the refusal of modern and postmodern transformations of society – is, according to Antonello, an impossible model to follow in our times, particularly in Pasolini’s sacrificial modality of martyrdom. In these pages, I provide reasons to remember Pasolini not as an icon invoked ex parte by the whole spectrum of political forces to support their claims, but as a foundational figure in mapping and representing marginal subjects who call into question the homogenization of modern subjectivity with their radical difference and their sense of the sacred. Pasolini traces the anthropological roots of national and transnational social outcasts who can embody a critique of global capitalism and become instrumental for a revolutionary use of nostalgia. Through his films and his literary works, as well as through his own political persona, Pasolini acts as the spokesperson of an archaic civilization that is still ingrained in our reality. He is the agent of a tragic but evangelical, immanent, and corporeal sacred that, while disappearing, still permeates Italy in its landscapes and bodies traumatized by modernity. Like the guest in his film Teorema, in his own violent death Pasolini leaves the legacy of a radical quest we still pursue. Like the characters in that movie, whether as isolated monads or clustered in social networks, we keep on wandering a deserted horizon, tantalized, in terror, or in awe, looking for a lost utopia, for a sacred meaning, for a blessing or a curse.\n\nChapter One\n\nThe Sense of the Sacred\n\nAn etymological history of the word “sacred” from its Latin foundations traces the two lexical forms sacer and sanctus to a common root, sac. What is interesting is the ambivalence of the word sacer, which can refer to buildings, people, or laws and can mean either “consecrated to a divinity” or, conversely, “consecrated to an infernal divinity to be destroyed,” “offered as a victim,” and thus “cursed” or “cast out from the group.”1 In fact, in its Indo-European form, “sacred” means “separated.” According to the definition given by Umberto Galimberti in his volume Orme del Sacro (2000), the sacred is a quality that pertains to the relationship and contact with superior powers, an “other” dimension that is above the human, apart from it, and cannot be controlled by human forces. It is a dimension that powerfully attracts humankind, inspiring fascination and awe, and repels us, arousing horror and fear – hence comes religion, which regulates the relationship with the sacred by processing contact and separation, preserving purity, and avoiding contagion and contamination. A Brief History of the Sacred Galimberti maps the history of the sacred from the French Sociological School of Èmile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss, through the theories of Lucien Levy-Bruhl and Rudolf Otto, to Carl Jung, Mircea Eliade, and René Girard, all theorists whom I often cite in this volume either because they provide a framework for interpreting Pasolini’s work or because they influenced Pasolini as he matured in his own understanding of the sacred. The modern discussion of the concept of the sacred begins with Durkheim (1858–1917) and Mauss (1872–1950), who identify its two\n\nThe Sense of the Sacred 19\n\nmain features: its superiority and its heterogeneity in comparison with the profane. This opposition is radical and can be defined as a mutual exclusion, a rivalry between the two dimensions. Things are sacred in religious thought because society sets them apart: they are not inherently related to divinity. The sacred belongs to a superior state: things that are sacred are replete with mana – a Polynesian word that indicates influence and power – and they can be accessed through sacrifice. Sacrifice allows a fissure to open between the different levels of experience and creates a contact between the two spheres of the sacred and the profane. In contrast, for French anthropologist Lucien Levy-Bruhl (1857– 1939), a theorist Pasolini read in the 1960s, the sacred belongs to the primitive pre-logical mentality, which interprets mystical participation as an omnipresent factor in its understanding of the real. Another important reference for Pasolini’s vision of the sacred is German theologian Rudolf Otto (1869–1937), who, in his foundational work Das Helige (The Idea of the Holy, 1917), claims the non-rational aspect within the sphere of the divine. Pasolini knew Otto’s theories from works by religious historian Mircea Eliade, and he applied them in his own works through an immanent lens. Otto identifies the sacred in the numinous, which is a feeling of intoxicating awe and terror in the face of the mysterium tremendum, the sublime contact with the Ganz Andere, the Wholly Other, a dimension that is impossible to define conceptually. When one faces the Wholly Other, the sense of belonging to the profane dimension becomes a creatural feeling. Art can express the numinous through various means: from the sublime to darkness, from silence to emptiness, all realities that express the terrifying and overwhelming feeling towards the mysterium tremendum in negative terms. Dutch historian of religion Gerardus van der Leeuw (1890–1950) – another essential thinker in this context – contends in Sacred and Profane Beauty (1932) that in the beginning art and religion were one but over time became separated. Originally, the artistic act was not only beautiful but also holy. Van der Leeuw distinguishes between sacred art and traditionally religious art, pointing out how sacred art does not need to be on a religious subject: “Whoever truly serves beauty, serves God” (1963, 335). Though it is not clear whether Pasolini was acquainted with Van der Leeuw’s theories of the sacred, the Dutch historian’s interpretation is foundational for an analysis of the relationship between cinema and the sacred.2 An essential reference for Pasolini’s sense of the sacred is the Romanian historian of religion Mircea Eliade (1907–86), for whom the sacred\n\n20 Pasolini: The Sacred Flesh\n\nis “the ultimate reality” from which the power of life comes; the whole of reality can be read as sacred. In his book The Sacred and the Profane (1956), Eliade investigates the sacred through its manifestations, which he calls hierophanies. These manifestations of the sacred appear in the realm of the profane and through a profane object that is itself but also becomes something else, something that transcends its dimension. The highest example of these hierophanies for Christians is God’s incarnation in Christ. In my interpretation of the sacred in Pasolini, I also make reference to the theories of Carl Gustav Jung, Georges Bataille, and René Girard. From a psychological standpoint, Jung (1875–1961) considers the God image as an archetype, as the deepest manifestation of the collective unconscious. The experience of the God image thus represents a numinous occurrence, with primordial, universal, and eternal qualities that bring on “a revelation of the immanent-transcendent, … ‘God within us’” (Palmer 1997, 141). It is a psychic reality that reveals wholeness and is equivalent to the Self. A Jungian reading of Pasolini’s art has been given by his lifelong friend, the painter Giuseppe Zigaina, in his volume Hostia (1995), where he testifies to Pasolini’s enduring interest in Jung and his alchemic vision, mediated and read through the lens of Mircea Eliade’s analysis of myths and rites. The history of the sacred finds another important figure in Georges Bataille (1897–1962), who inverts the association of order with the sacred and disorder with the profane. For Bataille, the sphere of the profane belongs to the world of work and reason, following an economy of utility. The sacred, instead, goes against purpose through the two primary forces of eros and thanatos, sexuality and death, and follows an economy (or rather an anti-economy) of dépense /expenditure. Against the homogeneity of philosophy, Bataille develops a theory of the sacred defined as “heterology,” or “the science of what is completely other” (2004, 102n2). French thinker René Girard (1923–) is also crucial for his notion of the core of the sacred as the violent act of foundation of a community purged through the sacrifice of a scapegoat. With its death, the scapegoat transfers the violence of the founding act from the community to the sacred dimension. Society then tries to suppress violence and, thus, the sacred, but total erasure of the sacred produces a backlash of immanent violence that threatens society again. The Scriptures have revealed the scapegoat mechanism at the foundation of society, but the modern world lives between this awareness and the threat of increasing violence that cannot find a defusing device.\n\nThe Sense of the Sacred 21\n\nFinally, a seminal reference for the sense of the sacred in Pasolini is the interpretation of the Incarnation as it appears in important figures of Italian Christian poetry and philosophy of the Novecento, such as Clemente Rebora (1885–1957) and David Maria Turoldo (1916–92). Rebora and Turoldo were priests and poets who focused their Christian poetics on the image of the cross. As Fabio Finotti’s studies have demonstrated, these two Catholic intellectuals gave voice to the sense of annihilation and dismay of the faithful as well as to the salvific touch of grace (Finotti 1997, 2007, 1993). Father David Maria Turoldo – a charismatic figure in the dialogue between Marxists and Catholics in the 1960s – was a very close friend and admirer of Pier Paolo Pasolini, and embodied similar impulses and tensions within the Catholic world. In 1962 he wrote and made the movie Gli Ultimi (The Least Ones), the autobiographical story of a poor Friulian peasant boy and his community, in collaboration with Marxist director Vito Pandolfi. Pasolini admired the movie, which triggered much controversy in Catholic circles: There is no frame shot in sunlight: the light is always wintery with high and compact clouds, which, in their own way, are as absolute as a clear sky. And the village is always still, in the purest black and white, and the countryside naked, drawn with an iron point … Little by little, the suite of life in the piedmont village, with its grey stone houses and its white roads in the blinding light of the snowy air, becomes iteration, litany: the series of episodes becomes obsessive, and the meanings of our poor human life trespass into a symbology that is as poor in ornaments as it is rich in almost physical pain. (SLA2, 2393–4)3\n\nPasolini’s vision of Turoldo’s Friuli was shaped by his recognition of Turoldo’s “absolute aesthetical severity,” whereas Turoldo’s vision of Pasolini’s Il Vangelo secondo Matteo (The Gospel according to Matthew, 1964) would be permeated by a messianic reading. In 1967, referencing Il Vangelo, Turoldo claimed, “Pasolini cannot but believe: he is an ancestral projection of his mother, above all! … And his mother is the people, she is humankind conceived, born, kneaded Christian, like the Friulian people she comes from really is – my own people, sorrowful and unhappy … Pasolini is an eschatological phenomenon, that’s it” (Subini 2010, xvii).4 It is with an eye to such theorists of the sacred that we can now move on to explore Pasolini’s work and his specific sense of the sacred, from his cinema to his theoretical writings, in relation to his readings of Eliade and the tradition of Italian anthropology.\n\n22 Pasolini: The Sacred Flesh\n\nThe Sense of the Sacred in Pasolini An analysis of the sacred in Pier Paolo Pasolini’s oeuvre must begin with a dream; specifically, with Il sogno del centauro (The Dream of the Centaur),5 a long, detailed, and controversial interview given – with much reticence – by Pier Paolo Pasolini to Jean Duflot in 1969. It was first published in French in 1970, with a “Preface by the Interviewee” and numerous captions interposed with the dialogue, so as to convey a possible verbal translation of Pasolini’s body language, his facial expressions, and the tone of his voice. Duflot prompts the writer to analyse his own poetic and intellectual trajectory, beginning with his Friulian and Roman debut in the 1940s and 1950s up to his complex cinematic conversion and the “cinema of poetry”6 of the following decade. In the interview, Pasolini introduces a series of interpretive keys that are essential to understanding his reading of the sacred, particularly in his cinematic oeuvre. The director answers the accusation of being a “desecrator” and a “scandal-monger” by taking a diametrically opposed position. He claims his role is in fact that of defender of the sacred, taking offence at his contemporaries’ indifference to it, and accusing the institutional churches and powers of profanation – even if he is aware of the contradictions of such a stance, the risks, and the potential misunderstandings. He states: I defend the sacred because it is that part of man which offers least resistance to profanation by power and is the most threatened by Church institutions … On the other hand, I realize that my longing for an idealized sacred that may never have existed – since the sacred has always been institutionalized, at the beginning by shamans, for example, and then by priests – I realize that in this nostalgia, as I was saying, there is something wrong, irrational, traditionalistic. (SC, SPS, 1480)7\n\nPasolini is fully aware of the contemporary irrelevance of the sacred. Nevertheless, he is alienated by technology and contemporary society, with its excessive rationality that has basically erased the irrational aspect of the sacred from its horizon. He claims to be allergic to the technological society of his time and asks, “So, what else can I do other than express the reflection of the past? [As if compelled to be sincere]” (SC, SPS, 1481).8 The sacred imagined by Pasolini is a spontaneous, “anarchic,” noninstitutional sacred, a “forza del Passato” (force of the Past)9 that is identified with the “senso della terra” (sense of the earth) and the relationship with nature developed by ancient agrarian civilizations. The coordinates of the writer’s polemically anticapitalist thought come to the\n\nThe Sense of the Sacred 23\n\nsurface here as he traces the history of the loss of the sacred in modernity. Pasolini looks back nostalgically to the mythical relationship of ancient civilizations with nature and the earth from the extreme margins of this “universo orrendo” (horrendous universe) perceived, from a Marxist perspective, as the dominion of bourgeois homogenization and consumerism. Talking about his film Teorema (Theorem, 1968), which brings to the screen the bourgeois condition as the tout court human condition with the exception of a few significant historical niches, in Il sogno del centauro Pasolini states that the industrial civilization was formed in total contradiction with the previous one, the agrarian civilization … which had its own sense of the sacred. Subsequently, this sense of the sacred was tied to ecclesiastical institutions and sometimes degenerated into savagery, especially when alienated by power. In any case, the sense of the sacred used to be rooted at the heart of human life. The bourgeois civilization has lost it. And what has it substituted for this sense of the sacred after its loss? An ideology of wealth and power. That’s it. For the moment we live in a negative time whose outcome still escapes me. I can therefore propose only hypotheses and no solutions. (SC, SPS, 1483–4)10\n\nThe sacred thus represents a crucial juncture where the author’s contradictions meet. It is a fragile, profaned fabric, wrenched by the rising tide of commodities and the market economy, the object of a regressive desire, but it is also an explosive survival, a subterranean fault that surfaces and cracks what Pasolini sees as the omnivorous impenetrability of the empty neo-capitalistic world. According to Pasolini, the sacred embodies the nemesis of modernity, the return of the uncanny archaic that shatters the apparent coherence of bourgeois existence, as shown by many of his late 1960s films, from Teorema (1968) to Medea (1969). The director defines in detail the sense of the sacred in ancient agrarian civilizations in Medea. In this work, the sacred consists of the relationship between a “non-natural” vision and a “hierophanic” perception of nature, as outlined in the first lines spoken by the centaur, who initiates young Jason into myth and religion. The centaur aptly embodies the mystery of the sacred, for which he speaks in his own double nature – human and animal – and in his sublime and terrifying ambivalence: CENTAUR – Everything is holy; everything is holy; everything is holy. There is nothing natural in nature, my boy, keep that always in mind. When nature appears natural to you, everything is over – and something else will begin.\n\n24 Pasolini: The Sacred Flesh Farewell sky, farewell sea! What a beautiful sky! Close, happy! Say, does it look to you like there’s even a little bit of it that is not un-natural? That is not possessed by some God? And so also is the sea, on this day when you are thirteen, and you fish with your feet in the warm water. Look behind your shoulders! What do you see? Anything natural, by chance? No, it’s an apparition that you see behind you, with the clouds mirrored in the still heavy water of this third hour in the afternoon! … Look down there … that black strip on a sea as shiny and pink as oil. And those tree shadows … those reed thickets … everywhere your eyes look, a God is hiding! And if by any chance there isn’t one, they left there the signs of their sacred presence, either silence or the smell of grass, or the coolness of fresh water … Ah yes, everything is holy, but holiness is also a curse. The Gods who love – at the same time – also hate. (PPC1, 1274–5)11\n\nPasolini’s childhood, spent in the maternal peasant Friuli of his first collections of poems, was immersed in that same sense of the sacred and similar hierophanies. Later, Pasolini’s sacred was theoretically validated by the ethnic-anthropological texts the writer discovered in the 1960s, from Frazer to Levy-Bruhl to the pages of historian Mircea Eliade’s Traité d’histoire des religions.12 Mircea Eliade’s words – with some minimal variation – are those Pasolini puts in the centaur’s mouth when Jason, now an adult and about to leave for Iolcos and Aea to conquer the Golden Fleece, abandons a mythical view of nature and enters a historical rational dimension; he lets ratio (instrumental logic) prevail over magical thinking. It is the centaur himself who predicts the loss of the sacred symbolized by the Argonauts’ conquest of the Fleece. As the axis mundi of Medea’s world, the Fleece is the centre of a barbaric agrarian society founded upon the myth of eternal return and sowing cycles, which is destined to be vanquished by the “abulic technician” Jason (SPS, 1504), exclusively intent on reaching the immediate practical goals of success and power. “Give life to the seed and be reborn with the seed”: these words of Medea who, back in the Colchis, celebrates a sacrificial rite for a propitious harvest, are juxtaposed with the centaur’s disillusionment as he announces that Jason is destined to abuse his power in the name of the logos and to abandon the sense of the sacred he previously described – in Eliade’s words, verbatim: CENTAUR: What man saw in grain, discovering agriculture, what man learned from this link, what he understood from the example of the seeds that\n\nThe Sense of the Sacred 25 lose their form in the ground in order to be reborn, all this represented the definitive lesson. Resurrection, my dear. But now this final lesson is no longer useful. What you see in grain, what you understand of the rebirth of seed has no meaning for you, like a distant memory that no longer concerns you. There is actually no God. (PPC1, 1276)13\n\nAs we will see, Pasolini does not forget the lesson of the seed. By repeatedly and fetishistically probing bodies and objects in his search for its traces, the director attempts to recuperate this threatened, lost dimension of the sacred any way he can. As he writes in “Battute sul Cinema” (Quips on the cinema, 1966–67), Pasolini is pushed by his “hallucinated, infantile, and pragmatic love for reality” (HE, 225; EE, SLA1, 1544).14 He is obsessed with trying to discover and capture on film the inner mechanisms of sacredness in human beings and the surrounding world, conceived as a sacred machina.15 Pasolini’s approach to the sacred is not purely thematic or functional; it is his language, both cinematic and not, that presents itself as an expression of the sacred. Speaking with Duflot about the sacrality of his first film, Accattone (1961), the writer clarifies his wish to return to the film the aura of objects, things, and images, the hierophanic dimension of the presence of the sacred. With his cinema of poetry, Pasolini would thus seem to suggest an alternative to Walter Benjamin’s thesis regarding the disappearance of the aura in the age of the mechanical reproduction of the work of art. According to the director, for example, filmic technique does not necessarily destroy myth but, on the contrary, finds it in the humblest and most forgotten objects and bodies, those that do not correspond to the traditional aesthetic canons swallowed up by the society of spectacle and the culture industry. The sacred is found at the margins, and the aura survives precisely where poverty excludes consumerism. In Pasolini’s words: In Accattone, sacrality was in its pure state. It must be specified that when I talk about this presence of the sacred, I do not talk about the film in general, about its internal forms, about the events, about the sequences of cause and effect, about the inner qualities of a certain character. I talk about the sacred, one thing after the other, object after object, image after image. (SC, SPS, 1495)16\n\nThis fascination with the sacred and the archaic could appear to be a regressive escape from reality, but it is not so for Pasolini or for cinema,\n\n26 Pasolini: The Sacred Flesh\n\nfor which the director claims the definition “the written language of reality” (HE, 197–222). His mythical imagination does not exclude realism; on the contrary, “only he who believes in myth is a realist. The ‘mythical’ is but the other face of realism.”17 This sounds paradoxical, but it is actually a position that is theoretically justified by Mircea Eliade’s thought. As the historian of religion states in The Sacred and the Profane (1956), the sacred is the real because it manifests being, while what we called the profane dimension is not true reality: Members of archaic societies tend to live as much as possible in the sacred or in close proximity to consecrated objects. The tendency is perfectly understandable, because, for primitive as well as all pre-modern societies, the sacred is equivalent to a power, and, in the last analysis, to reality. The sacred is saturated with being. Sacred power means reality and at the same time enduringness and efficacy. The polarity sacred–profane is often expressed as an opposition between real and unreal or pseudoreal … Thus it is easy to understand that religious man deeply desires to be, to participate in reality, to be saturated with power. (1959, 13)\n\nIt is in this key that Pasolini’s realism must be read, especially in the late 1960s, the years of the economic boom and of Pasolini’s most cryptic works. It is a realism that, as we will see in this volume, is characterized by lack of transparency and readability, a realism that requires effort to be interpreted and that privileges formal constructions and citations, even as it aims at exalting the pro-filmic. It is a non-mimetic realism, in which a story does not advance in a linear fashion but in bursts, ellipses, and short circuits. Pasolini’s vision is justified by its philosophical basis, since he does not believe in the Hegelian dialectic and grounds his thought in the coincidentia oppositorum, the rhetorical figure of antithesis pushed, as shown by Franco Fortini, all the way to the synoeciosis with which two opposites are attributed to the same subject (1993, 22). In Pasolini, the myth of nature is anti-Hegelian and antidialectic because, as he states in Il sogno del centauro, “nature does not know ‘overcomings.’ Everything in it is juxtaposed and coexists” (SC, SPS, 1461).18 This is true also of the sacred, which is never erased but survives side by side with its desecration since, as Pasolini claims, “Being sacred is always juxtaposed to being desecrated. With this, I mean that, by living, I have carried out a series of overcomings, of desecrations, of evolutions. What I was, however, before these overcomings, desecrations, evolutions, has not disappeared” (SC, SPS, 1473).19 He continues: “I am instead so metaphysical, mythical, so mythological … that I\n\nThe Sense of the Sacred 27\n\ncannot venture to say that a given thing that overcomes a previous one, dialectically, must incorporate it, assimilate it. I say that they are juxtaposed” (SC, SPS, 1474).20 During the shooting of Medea, Pasolini reasserts the conflict between the illusory linearity of history and the circularity of an indifferent flourishing nature, the civilization of the line and that of the circle borrowed from Eliade, in the verses of “Callas,” a poem from the collection Trasumanar e organizzar (Transhumanize and organize, 1971): The overcomings, the syntheses! They are illusions … thesis and antithesis coexist with synthesis: this is the true trinity of a humanity that is neither pre-logical nor logical but real … History is not there, we could say, there is substance: which is apparition. (TO, TP2, 262)21\n\nHegelian synthesis makes no sense if it is laid out on an Eliadian nonlinear trajectory; it belongs to a circular one, sacred and meta-historical, where “overcoming” represents a phase that is juxtaposed to the preceding ones. The goal is to return to the origins, whence time always returns. Substance is apparition, which is another way to say “hierophany,” the key concept, mutuated from Eliade, in defining the modality of existence of the sacred. As noted by Conti Calabrese, Pasolini’s main concern is finding and acknowledging what Eliade calls “archaic ontology” in every religious belief. The ontology at the foundation of premodern agrarian civilizations (with their immersion in circular time), as well as that of Christian liturgy (inscribed within the myth of eternal return),22 makes possible the expressive turn to the auscultation of the traces of the sacred that emerge from the primogenial nuclei of sex, laughter, and death. As clearly evidenced by Duflot in his comments to Pasolini, the director’s poetics thus condenses around these great themes: [Duflot]: So that the sacred, myth, ancient civilizations, the peoples of the earth and of nature, prehistoric man, are buried … without ever disappearing completely. In the heart of man, the child lives on. At the center of erotic rituals, wild Eros burns. All these presences define a profound ethics, as deep as, if not deeper than, the morality of progress and of production. [Pasolini]: The tragic is exactly the definitive rupture of this continuity. (SC, SPS, 1506)23\n\n28 Pasolini: The Sacred Flesh\n\nThe tragic is thus a quintessential part of the sacred: it is the break, the fissure that the sacred produces in the apparent progressive and linear trajectory of history. In this coexistence of primal states within humankind’s modernity lies the perennial (and threatening) resurfacing of the sacred as tragedy. The sacred erupts and breaks the surface of history, exploding through the Pasolinian characters who cannot but be physically or spiritually dying. Pasolini between Eliade and De Martino If we follow Eliade’s notion of archetypes and archaic ontology a bit further, we find that Pasolini, part homo religiosus and part historical man,24 relives both sides of the relationship with the sacred in his imagination and in his work. Consequently, he brings to the screen “hierophanies” that he projects against the background of bourgeois civilization’s desecrations. Eliade describes these two poles of human belief, the two fundamental existential attitudes of the sacred and the profane, as follows: Whatever the historical context in which he is placed, homo religiosus always believes that there is an absolute reality, the sacred, which transcends this world but manifests itself in this world, thereby sanctifying it and making it real. He further believes that life has a sacred origin and that human existence realizes all of its potentialities in proportion as it is religious – that is, participates in reality … By reactualizing sacred history, by imitating the divine behavior, man puts and keeps himself close to the gods – that is, in the real and the significant. (Eliade 1959, 202)\n\nModern nonreligious man, according to Eliade, sees himself at the centre of history and refuses transcendence. He creates himself through desacralization: “He will not be truly free until he has killed the last god” (Eliade 1959, 203). Eliade’s anti-historical vision is ill-adapted to the Marxist historicism that inspired Pasolini’s rationalism, especially in his Roman works, with the contrasted adhesion to Marxist ideology in the poems of Le ceneri di Gramsci (The Ashes of Gramsci, 1957). In an even darker picture, Eliade sketches a portrait of modern man after Christianity introduced faith and history into the human dimension, leaving man in a condition of “being fallen” from the archetypically transcendent horizon. It is no longer possible to read the tragedies of history in a trans-historical key. We can only succumb to God or to despair over the meaninglessness of history and the terror it generates.\n\nThe Sense of the Sacred 29 In this respect, Christianity incontestably proves to be the religion of “fallen man”: and this to the extent to which modern man is irremediably identified with history and progress, and to which history and progress are a fall, both implying the final abandonment of the paradise of archetypes and repetition. (Eliade 2005, 161–2)\n\nIn the late 1960s, Pasolini found in Eliade the perfect match for his anthropological pessimism or, better, apocalypticism, according to which we are living in the age of the end of the sacred, and we no longer can defeat history with myths and rites. The sacred world of the eternal return is pointing towards a never-ending fall. It is not by chance that this vision of the sacred will prevail in Pasolini’s last works in cinema and literature, where apocalypticism takes over through the paradigms of the “anthropological mutation” of Pasolini’s young characters and the “cultural genocide” of the subproletarians. Another interpretive paradigm of the sacred – this time wholly historical and immanent, and therefore more suited to Pasolini’s thought in its first, more Marxist and Gramscian stage – is found in the realm of historicist Italian ethnology and anthropology. It is the vision of the sacred elaborated by Ernesto De Martino (1908–1965), an anthropologist whose research in the history of religions was particularly concentrated between the late 1950s and early 1960s. De Martino studied rituals and myths of southern Italy and other Mediterranean civilizations, such as “tarantismo,”25 as well as the funerary lamentation and wailing rooted in the deepest archaic and pagan layers of Catholic rural southern civilization. Centred on the polarity of two terms – “crisis” and “presence” – De Martino’s sacred is the immanent answer to the Ganz Andere – the Wholly Other – of Lutheran theologian Rudolf Otto, already at the foundation of the irrational and transcendent vision of the sacred proposed by Mircea Eliade. Unlike Eliade, however, De Martino grounds his activity as a historian of religion on a strictly rational and historicist basis rather than a phenomenological one. He elaborates on an interpretation of the human response to the sacred that is wholly immanent and strongly dependent on history – a history from which man apparently escapes at the precise moment at which he participates in it. According to De Martino, the sacred can appear as a rejection of history and an attempt to escape the world, but in every religious development there is “a technical mediation that returns to history from history and that, because of this dialectic, limits the merely technical moment of the mythical and ritual, opening up the mundane and profane to different levels of autonomy and self-awareness” (1995, 90).26\n\n30 Pasolini: The Sacred Flesh\n\nA fundamental notion in De Martino’s theory of the sacred is that of “crisis of presence,” to which the sacred represents a technical response, a strategic tool to reinstate the individual in his or her own presence. Presence is thus defined by De Martino as being beyond merely organic or animal existence, beyond the dimension of the body, but rather located in those human powers that make decisions and choices possible. Civilization finds its roots in what is precisely human, in this presence that presides over technical, artistic, ethical, and philosophical creation. Presence means “being there” in history. It is the fundamental element of personal identity. It is what allows an individual to take action and confront the regimen of perpetual change to which history subjects all of us, every day. Angst is the sign of the terror history imposes on us, and it is a symptom of the possibility of getting lost and returning to a primal biological level, deprived of the self, no longer able to choose a trajectory in the context of the events taking place around us. The answer to this angst is human action, the development of human activities – in other words, culture. As De Martino explains, the crisis of presence can assume the aspect of something “wholly other,” but this radical alterity is precisely the alienated presence that announces the catastrophe of the individual (1995, 61). The mechanism that allows mankind to remain an active and integral part of history is a process of “de-historicization” through the mythicalritual nexus. The de-historicization that religions set in motion helps us to overcome moments of crisis by feigning an arrest of history that, in fact, allows history to go on. This mechanism is analogous to the iterations and repetitions described by Eliade. However, whereas in Eliade’s theory this process draws on a transcendent source of archetypes, for De Martino it iterates the identical metahistorical in order to allow change and cope with the distress caused by history. According to the Italian anthropologist: Through such de-historicization, first, a relationship is established with the alienated self (either naturalized or de-historicized); second, thanks to a vital pia fraus [pious fraud], we remain in history AS IF we were not in it: exactly because man’s operational powers are not recognized in their quality as human initiatives, those powers are in fact allowed and disclosed, and culture as the TOTALITY of values is made possible. (1995, 62–3)27\n\nLike Eliade, De Martino attributes the end of the sacred in modernity to the secularization brought on by Christianity itself. De Martino does\n\nThe Sense of the Sacred 31\n\nnot identify in the sacred a transcendent reality but rather a technical process that allowed humanity to develop civilization. Many millennia later, this technical process is in its last phase; modern man thus faces the challenge of finding a mechanism to substitute for the sacred in order to continue to be able to resist the crisis of presence. De Martino fully addresses this issue in his 1959 essay “Mito, scienze religiose e civiltà moderna,” (“Myth, religious sciences and modern civilization”), in which he observes that the sacred is not a permanent human need and that it has entered a phase of agony: The sacred is agonizing and we are faced with the problem of surviving its death as human beings, without running the risk of losing – together with the sacred – our access to human cultural values or being terrorized by a history horizon and perspective that are no longer constituted by the mythical-ritual metahistory. The choice between human and divine, which has troubled the long history of religions and that, with Christianity, began a dramatic process of maturation, today presents itself in the terms of an actual choice we cannot avoid. What is “sacred” in the traditional modes of a metahistorical horizon, articulated into an organic nexus of myths and rituals, does not constitute a permanent exigence of human nature. It is rather a great historical era that, going back in the direction of the past, gets lost in the night of its origins, and that reaches out to us, heirs of Western civilization. However, no matter how long this era has been, it is clear that we are coming out of it, that its sun is setting within us. The risk of an existential crisis, the need for protective and restorative symbolisms certainly pertains to the human condition and therefore also to modern civilization. The technique of the metahistorical horizon, however, has become obsolete, so that modern civilization is busy organizing a society and a culture whose symbolism may express the sense of history and the humanistic consciousness without resorting to ambiguous double-faced politics. (De Martino 1959, 45–46)28\n\nHere Pasolini departs from De Martino: whereas the anthropologist believes it is possible for modern man to invent new techniques to adapt to – and even overcome – the terror of history, Pasolini is closer to Eliade’s more pessimistic view regarding modern man’s capacity to replace the sacred without succumbing to fideism or despair. Nevertheless, Pasolini’s encounter with De Martino was undoubtedly fruitful. The director was involved with the anthropological and ethnographic circles in Rome, and he collaborated in the production of\n\n32 Pasolini: The Sacred Flesh\n\nanthropological films by Cecilia Mangini, an ethnographer and documentarist of De Martino’s school (Caminati 2010, 48–9). As Tommaso Subini notes, religion historian and anthropologist Angelo Brelich – a follower of the historicist Italian ethnological school – advised the director during the production of Medea. In addition, Pasolini incorporated several elements of De Martino’s theory; for example, Subini suggests that Pasolini’s analysis of the proletariat and his theorization of its anthropological difference – a foundational axis of his work – are based on De Martino (Subini 2008, 28). In a conversation with Bruno Voglino, Rolando Iotti, and Nino Ferrero, Pasolini explains: Remaining at the level of instrumental communication where we currently are, I would say that angst is a bourgeois fact … The sub-proletariat feels a different kind of anguish, what De Martino studied in his research on popular poetry in Lucania, for example, that is, a pre-historic anguish compared to the bourgeois existentialistic angst, which is historically determined. In Accattone, I studied this kind of prehistoric anguish in relation to our own … the anguish of a Lucanian peasant who sings a funerary lamentation over a dead relative is an anguish that has different historical components than those experienced by a bourgeois like the character in Moravia’s Boredom … It’s a totally different thing! (PPC2, 2812)29\n\nPasolini’s adherence to De Martino’s theories is certainly not monolithic; the director adopts them or rejects them according to his own sensibility and purpose. As noted by Maggi (2009, 9), in the case of the conversation quoted here, for example, Pasolini in fact contradicts De Martino. For De Martino, the crisis of both the Lucanian peasant and contemporary man is a crisis of presence; even though today we face it with invalid, ineffective tools, that angst is the same. For Pasolini, the two forms of angst are radically different, and the prehistorical angst of the subproletariat is rooted in an anthropologically different realm. That anguish is not the existential and bourgeois malaise on the threshold of boredom, but rather is a primal crisis of survival in the face of death. De Martino does not trace an absolute difference between modernity and prehistory: humankind reacts to the same issues, the only problem being that the de-historicizing device of the sacred no longer functions in modern times, though the crisis of presence remains substantially the same. Elsewhere, Pasolini contradicts De Martino’s statement on the radically different “angst” of the peasant and of the bourgeois, and again refers to him and to the crisis of presence, applying it to himself and his\n\nThe Sense of the Sacred 33\n\nown cinema. In a response to one of the readers of his column “Il Caos,” for example, he writes about drug use: It is clear that people who use drugs do it to fill a void, an absence of something that gives a feeling of disorientation and angst. It is a substitute for magic. The primitive are always facing this terrifying void, on the inside. Ernesto De Martino calls it “fear of the loss of one’s own presence”; and primitives fill this void by turning directly to magic, which explains it and fills it. In the modern world, the alienation due to conditioning by nature is replaced by the alienation due to conditioning by society: after the first moment of euphoria (Enlightenment, science, applied science, comfort, wealth, production, and consumption), the alienated start feeling all alone; then, like the primitive, they are terrorized by the idea of the loss of their own presence. In reality, we all do drugs. I do it (as far as I know) by making movies. (DIAL, 549–50)30\n\nPasolini here returns to De Martino’s theory of the crisis of presence as a phenomenon that affects contemporary man no less than the man of archaic civilizations, even though in modernity the crisis of presence comes from society-induced alienation. What has changed, however, are the instruments used to overcome the crisis and fill the void. Pasolini gives existential and sacred dignity to cinema by turning it into a tool for survival at the same moment it is dismissed as a drug, as cultural diversion. Cinema replaces the sacred, magic, and miracles – the mythicalritual devices that make de-historicization possible. In a certain sense, through films, cinema becomes an antidote to history and death, the extreme and ultimate form of the crisis of presence. As Pasolini explains: [A]s opposed to life or to cinema, an action in film – or figural sign, or expressive device, or reproduced living syntagma … – has as its meaning the meaning of the analogous real action performed by those persons in flesh and blood, in that same social or natural milieu, but its meaning is already completed and decipherable, as if death had already occurred. This means that [in the film]31 time is complete, even if only through a pretense. Therefore one must necessarily accept the story. Time in this context is not that of life when it lives, but of life after death; as such it is real, it is not an illusion, and it very well can be that of the story of a film. (HE, 243)32\n\nAccording to Pasolini, every film is inscribed in a moral configuration and describes a catalogue of human examples, of destinies expressed\n\n34 Pasolini: The Sacred Flesh\n\nand constructed under the sign of death. The director thus acts upon the stories that develop in his films in the same way death intervenes in life, giving back to it a meaning that is, first of all, moral. Giuliana Bruno emphasizes Pasolini’s “culture of death”: A process of fragmentation, juxtaposition, and deconstruction, epitomized by montage, enacts historicity for cinema: montage interrupts the continuous present of cinema and life, and changes into the “historical present” of film and death … Film, a devouring machine, a “reality eater,” is positioned on the brink of death and history. (Bruno 1994, 95–6)\n\nIn fact, it is a culture of presence, mediated by the “mythical-ritual” device of cinema that, through films, enables the process of de-historicization once triggered by myth. We are in a film as if we were in real life, in history. In films, we live as full of meaning as if we were dead, but we are still alive. For directors and spectators, living cinema involves this game at the threshold of death and history. It represents a “sacred” device that makes de-historicizing death possible, remembering that, for Pasolini, expression is death: “Either be immortal and unexpressed, or express oneself and die”33 (HE, 243). As Pasolini wrote in 1967: Cinema … is grounded in time, and it thus obeys the same rules as life: the rules of an illusion. It may seem strange but we must accept this illusion. Because those who … do not accept it, rather than entering a phase of heightened reality, lose the presence of reality: which therefore consists only of this illusion. (PPC1, 1056)34\n\nTemporality is essential to the establishment of a discourse on presence. In this sense, the time of the film must be framed within the more general discussion of the image of time delineated by Jean-Luc Nancy in The Ground of the Image (2005) on the basis of Kant’s concept of time: namely, as the pure image of all sensory objects. In Nancy’s words: This pure image is the image of images, the opening of unity as such. It violently folds together the dismembered exterior, but its tightened folds are also the slit that unity cuts in the continuity of extension. The pure image is the earthquake in being that opens the chasm or the fault of presence. There where being was in itself, presence will no longer return to itself: it is\n\nThe Sense of the Sacred 35 thus that being is, or will be, for itself. One can understand how time is, in many respects, violence itself. (23–4).\n\nThe temporality-death-presence nexus thus established becomes central to the image of cinema. It appears to be the foundational connection among the mythical dimension of cinema, the sphere of the sacred, and the sacred techniques so clearly identified in De Martino’s studies. Cinema, too, represents one of the mythical devices available to modern man to escape history; like myth before it, cinema allows us to remain within history as if we were outside of it. To both director and spectators, cinema reveals a more attentive comprehension of the mechanisms of reality; cinema is in fact the “written language of reality,” and as such it can be studied and analysed. The Archaic and the Christian Sacred The crisis of presence brought on by mourning, for example, prompts the de-historicization process typical of the archaic sacred. Not surprisingly, this process changes with the rise of Christian thought centred on the irreversible event of the Incarnation. According to Ernesto De Martino in Morte e pianto rituale del mondo antico (Death and Ritual Tears in the Ancient World, 1958): The pagan dehistoricization oriented towards the ritual iteration of the meta-historical “origins,” as well as the Judaic dehistoricization oriented towards waiting for the “end” of history, are now countered by the dehistoricization of a “central” event that shaped the course of history: an event through which salvation is given and the Reign that has made death only apparent already begins, until the second, definitive parousia. (De Martino 1958, 322)35\n\nPasolini’s notion of the sacred is based primarily on the religious vision that was still alive in the Friulian countryside of his childhood, a vision that is typical of archaic agrarian cultures that have been influenced by the contradictory syncretism of the archaic and Christian sacred. In the age of the disappearance of the sacred, Pasolini preserves the violence of the archaic sacred while incorporating the lesson of the Incarnation and of the suffering Christ. According to Remo Cacitti, Pasolini’s atheism expresses the tragic sense of God’s distance from a humanity that cannot\n\n36 Pasolini: The Sacred Flesh\n\nstop looking for the divine despite knowing that it cannot be reached (1997, 7). Cacitti argues that Pasolini is, in certain respects, close to the vision of the sacred proposed by the “theology of the death of God”36 that animated the Protestant theological debate in texts such as Thomas Altizer’s The Gospel of Christian Atheism (1966) in the 1960s. The movement had been anticipated in Continental philosophy by the thought of Lutheran pastor and anti-Nazi hero Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a proponent of a Christianity without religion. Bonhoeffer writes at length about a vision of the Christian sacred based on a theology of the suffering Christ that abolishes the god of metaphysics. This view is described in the intense sequence of passages analysed by Paul Ricoeur in his essay “The Non-religious Interpretation of Christianity in Bonhoeffer” (2009). According to Bonhoeffer as cited by Ricoeur, the God who is with us is the God who forsakes us. Humankind lives without God, because God has allowed Himself to be pushed out of the world onto the cross. His powerlessness is His only way to be present for mankind. “This text,” Ricoeur argues, “clearly indicates an orientation towards an atheism of the philosophical God and a theology of the suffering God, and it is this conjunction that we must try to intercept” (161). Pasolini moves within an analogous horizon, where the lesson Christ imparts from the cross is none other than the disappearance of the omnipotent God and the Incarnation of a god who becomes man. It is an all-human god whose greatness, as Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek says in The Fragile Absolute (2000), depends on the fact that “man directly is part of the divine Life, … it is only in man, in human history, that God fully realizes Himself, that He becomes an actual living God” (107). Pasolini’s “Christianity” thus anticipates in part the materialistic vision of the Incarnation elaborated by Žižek in his texts on radical theology. We will see in chapters 2 and 3 below how the kenotic dimension of Pasolini’s Christ materializes in the crucifixion scenes that recur in the corpus of his cinematography. Religiosity: Caritas Within the range of different variants of the sacred in Pasolini – now embodied in the social otherness of the Friulan peasantry or urban subproletariat, now in the temporal otherness of classical myth or in the geographical otherness of the Third World – religious language takes on a privileged role. This language despises every ecclesiastical confessional\n\nThe Sense of the Sacred 37\n\nform and favours the barbaric (i.e., what is pre-human) in an age in which the human has become synonymous with the bourgeois. In this sense, Pasolini’s language of religiosity can be said to be paradoxically reanimated through the heretical filter of a caritas without faith or hope. Pasolini’s obsession with religious themes is incontrovertible; this fixation is frequently acknowledged by the author himself. The titles of his collections of verses (L’usignolo della Chiesa Cattolica [The nightingale of the Catholic Church, 1958], La religione del mio tempo [The religion of my time, 1961], Trasumanar e organizzar [Transhumanize and organize, 1971], and his script in verses Bestemmia [Blasphemy, 1962–67]) all seem to confirm beyond any reasonable doubt the poetic genealogy of this thematic constant. At the same time, Pasolini’s religiosity, tied to a mystical contemplation of the world, an ongoing interrogation of the mystery of death, and the need to “admire nature and man, recognize the depth … of things”37 (SC, SPS, 1422), strongly rejects an affiliation with any church or creed and avoids any institutionalization of faith. Pasolini is religious in the sense that he partially embraces the condition of homo religiosus, notwithstanding his being homo historicus. It is not baptism that makes him religious: his religiosity is not inscribed in a Christian horizon in the institutional sense. He does not belong to a church although he is permeated by a culture that is deeply Christianized, surrounded by the churches and sacred art, music, and architecture of Italian civilization. Pasolini is extremely clear in his vindication of a free religious spirit that goes beyond clerical institutions: I do not like Catholicism as an institution, not because of militant atheism but because my religion, or rather my religious spirit – which has nothing to do with an affiliation founded on baptism – is offended by it. Then there’s this crypto-Christianity with which the most aggressive charge me, as if it were a mark of infamy. I will respond to them saying that it is rare for a Westerner not to be Christianized, if not a staunch Christian. Even more so for an Italian. (SC, SPS, 1421)38\n\nChristianity is therefore seen as a cultural imprinting that Pasolini conflates with the obscure and confused sense of the divine rooted in his childhood, a psychological status that can never ripen into faith, as Pasolini reaffirms in an interview given to Aldo Bernardini: My sense of the divine is a shapeless psychological feeling that I found left in me from birth, in infancy, and probably because of this it is not very\n\n38 Pasolini: The Sacred Flesh strong … In reality, this ascetic openness, this sense of life seen from the point of view of eternity is always present "
