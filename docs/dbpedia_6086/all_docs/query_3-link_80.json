        "text": "As with many other different aspects of film culture, the contribution of women to the history of film theory has left very few traces behind. The few exceptions that come to mind (Germaine Dulac, Maya Deren, Mary Field, Esfir Shub) have gained a (relative) attention only in fields we are accustomed to conceive of as minor or marginal, for example experimental cinema, educational cinema, archival compilation, and so on. Even more than “straight” film history, the history of film theories has for a long time been the narrative of a homosocial debate. Until the advent of feminist film theory in the 1970s, film theory was virtually an all-male business. In recent years much work has been done to recover documentation about early women's reflection on cinema. An interesting corpus of material has surfaced in different countries, and research in this field is constantly rewarding. This growing corpus is peculiar under several different aspects, which, however, all ultimately have to do with the “minor”, or better, “micro-theoretical” nature of women's writing on film. In this article we try to offer a few insights into women's relation to the “micro-theoretical” form of writing by analyzing the case of Italy. Here, during the silent period, several interesting female voices emerged that crossed the public sphere for a brief moment, yet only to pass by and leave no trace of their reception."
