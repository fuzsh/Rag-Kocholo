        "text": "By Pedro Monque\n\nChildren from the afterschool program at El Rincón del Saber in Cambalache (Ciudad Guayana, Venezuela) preparing a play. Photo credit: the author.\n\nWhere is this grassroots initiative implemented? Who are the promoters? Who are the\n\nbeneficiaries?\n\nEl Rincón del Saber [The Knowledge Corner] is a grassroots educational initiative led by Andreina Guarisma in the neighborhood of Cambalache (Ciudad Guayana, Venezuela). Ciudad Guayana was established in 1961 to host large steel and aluminum industries that would become Venezuela’s insurance against oil export dependency. Cambalache, on the other hand, was not meant to exist. City planners in the 1960s designated the northwestern part of the city as an industrial zone, adjacent to the Orinoco River for easy riverine transport of imports and exports. At the time, Cambalache was populated by a few families that sold fish and vegetables to the early workers of the Orinoco Mining Company’s steel mill. As the city grew, the regional development corporation “CVG” attempted many times to evict the people of Cambalache, but enough of them stayed put so that, as the new city grew, so did Cambalache. Over time, Cambalache became a hotspot of environmental injustices, from the draining of bountiful lagoons to host bauxite residue in 1979, to the installment of an open dump that served as the city’s main waste disposal site from 1985 until protests by Cambalache residents in 2014 managed to shut it down. More recently, the people of Cambalache have turned things around, building an aqueduct in 2020 that delivers probably the best water in the city.\n\nPicture of red mud pool nearest to Cambalache (below). Photo credit: the author.\n\nIt is within this context of struggle that El Rincón del Saber was born. The initial impetus came from Andreina’s concern that most children in the community lack internet access at home, and there is no library where they might do their homework. With the help of a local nonprofit, Buscadores de Libros, she turned her living room into a community library in early 2022. By May, Andreina and the author of this note began running an afterschool program in the front porch. The initiative has since grown, incorporating new teachers and an environmental education component centered on gardening. Because of Cambalache’s agricultural origins, El Rincón aims to instill in children a sense of pride in their community by teaching them how to grow their own food, compost, and raise animals. Yet, the cost and dedication needed to run a garden has limited its success, especially because it competes with reading, writing, math, and recreational activities.\n\nHow does this initiative engage with climate?\n\nEl Rincón del Saber engages the climate crisis indirectly at this stage, mainly through its twin goals of promoting food sovereignty by promoting gardening, and by developing children’s commitment to environmental caretaking. I, the author of this entry, am a close collaborator of Andreina on this initiative. Because I am in charge of programming for the afterschool program, it is my aspiration that we will deepen the environmental theme so that climate change is tackled directly. So far, our focus has been on environmental caretaking, which we incorporate into reading, writing, and math activities. Because the children of Cambalache grow up in close contact with a diversity of animals and plants, as well as the impressive Orinoco River, stories about people’s relationships to animals and trees work well for group discussion. We also use the plants at El Rincón to illustrate mathematical principles (for example, the notion of the average by counting flower petals). However, we have not yet had sustained discussions on climate change in the afterschool program. When climate change does surface, it is either as a way to convey the importance of food sovereignty to the city (a mid-term goal), or as a possible strategy to find allies and funding for the initiative (more of a short-term goal).\n\nChildren from El Rincón del Saber sowing (top). Deliannys shares a story she wrote (right). Photo credit: the author.\n\nTo an outsider, it might seem that climate change is a relatively low priority for impoverished communities with more urgent needs. Admittedly, most of our regular work on El Rincón does not mention the issue of climate change explicitly. Yet, when asked, Andreina claims that climate change is an extremely important issue. As a resident of Cambalache, Andreina has a strong sense of the consequences of pollution and environmental injustice on human life. She is aware that greenhouse gases are changing our climate and worries about local effects, such as changes in rain patterns, as well as the disasters reported in the news. So, if we take a more expansive view of what it means to be concerned about climate change, El Rincón del Saber’s focus on food sovereignty, environmental injustice, and active environmental citizenship can be seen as a contribution to climate justice and its toolbox.[1]\n\nThroughout the Occupy Climate Change! 2023 Winter School, the idea of grounding climate struggle in local realities, of making it about more than planetary-level greenhouse gas emissions, was central. Whereas climate science has accurately diagnosed the main consequences of increasing global temperature, a key challenge remains to link climate disruption to local livelihoods and basic institutions like education, childrearing, and food—especially in the global south, where communities have little influence over key polluters or climate policy (at least for now). Yet, as Kyle Whyte (2017) has argued, climate disruption is not an unprecedented crisis for indigenous peoples and others who have felt the impacts of environmental racism, so the way that these communities respond to the environmental crisis can teach us something about what kinds of adaptations are important, even after granting that they are severely constrained by other urgent problems, and that they too have stuff to learn.\n\nAt the same time, I find it important to recognize that much more needs to be done to integrate the full insights afforded by a climate perspective to the work of El Rincón del Saber. In the first place, Andreina, like most people in Ciudad Guayana (including myself), has only a vague sense of what to expect locally from climate change. Moreover, none of the collaborators is particularly aware of the broader discussions on climate, the costs of a corporate energy transition, or the broader environmental crisis, happening at both the Latin American and global levels. A greater awareness of this topic could help make the case for Cambalache’s importance as a source of food and agricultural knowledge for the entire city, which is hardly recognized because local food production is not taken to be important by most people. So, in addition to the work of developing incipient models of small-scale food production that could be replicated in the rest of Ciudad Guayana, Cambalache could help enact a deep cultural transformation that would change nothing less than the meaning of rightful residence in this industrial city through the act of growing food. El Rincón del Saber could play an important role in this transformation, but it will need to develop its political reading of our current situation and communicate its vision effectively to potential allies.\n\nIn sum, Andreina has expressed a commitment to aligning actions that address immediate needs (like malnutrition and educational deficits) with those that would make Cambalache and Ciudad Guayana more resilient in the face of climate change. I therefore see considerable potential in this initiative to become a locus of climate and environmental justice action in a city where few organizations address these issues. Yet, achieving this goal will require ongoing support from people and movements devoted to climate justice who can orient Andreina and her collaborators. Moreover, sustained funding for initiatives connected to climate and environmental justice seems crucial if those dimensions of the initiative are to consolidate. One of the most promising directions for linking current priorities in Cambalache with climate change is through the theme of food sovereignty since both Cambalache residents and the larger city of Ciudad Guayana would benefit greatly from local food production.\n\nWhat are the main objectives? What are the main values?\n\nEl Rincón del Saber’s immediate aim is to enhance Cambalache children’s wellbeing through educational and recreational activities. Particular attention is paid to children suffering abuse or neglect, which are themselves the consequence of broader economic and social injustices that have defined Ciudad Guayana for decades.[2] At the same time, there is a broader social and environmental vision animating the whole initiative, which Andreina describes in this way:\n\nI started working for an NGO called Alinca in Cambalache. We would give talks to families about gender-based violence and positive parenting. We were surprised when we entered the homes and immediately observed the violence of the parents towards the children. That motivated me to continue my work with more strength. Not only to go investigate and make a report, but to take action so that the children of the community could recover values like respect for themselves and others.\n\nHere, people can be very rude and intolerant. They struggle to accept people as they are and love them that way. That’s why I am how I am: I’m a humble person who isn’t looking for defects in others, because everyone has their defects and virtues. And I love everyone, okay! [She laughs]. I’m a person with a lot of love. And that’s what we have to instill in children one way or another: that they accept people as they are. That they cannot bully others just because they are not like me, of the same social class, or because the other person is black and I am white. Those things should not exist in children.\n\nThe reality is that there is an enormous task to undertake in the community, and those of us who live here can see that better. In my three years with the community promoters at Alinca, we would get sick from being in the sun and rain so much, diving into the heart of the community’s issues. Now I have my own space to transform those situations I saw. Look, here I am, supervising the construction of this roof and a new bathroom so the project can continue growing. Here again I have to thank Mariela for having found the resources, and I remain hopeful that other organizations, like Alinca itself, will be encouraged to actively support El Rincón del Saber…\n\nI would like to see in the future that the children of Cambalache… as well as other children who join, become professionals. It would make me proud to see them develop into whatever they want to be: athletes, engineers, farmers, fishermen, whatever they want, but that they are trained and develop their abilities to the fullest. And then that they become spokespersons for other children. That the project does not stay just with them, but that they change their way of thinking and also join in the rescue of values.\n\nThe people in Cambalache have been taking up farming, fishing too, but especially farming. People are growing their own food: all kinds of vegetables and fruit trees. I wouldn’t trade this for a house in the city. Here I feel free, without pollution, even though people say it’s polluted.\n\nThis area really is coveted by city people, and sometimes we don’t realize the wealth we have here in the community. We have the river nearby that could become a tourist area. We have vast stretches of land to grow whatever you want, and even to raise animals for food and sale. We have the fishermen.\n\nI am in love with Cambalache and would never think of returning to San Félix [the eastern half of Ciudad Guayana]. I spent 13 years there and I’ve been here for 25 years already! (Monque 2024, 59)\n\nIn addition to the educational and wellbeing goals of the program, I would highlight that its environmental themes arise organically from the semi-rural character of Cambalache. As mentioned earlier, the people of Cambalache are engaged in a struggle to redefine the meaning of the place: from landfill to riverside garden, from classist associations with poverty and ignorance to agroecological abundance and expertise.\n\nOne of the key challenges for Cambalache to overcome is its association with waste. As Marco Armiero explains: “some people and places have been transformed into dumping sites, sacrifice zones for the well-being of others and the purported common good of the nation” (2021b, 427), and, elsewhere, “Waste as a relation (wasting) produces the targeted community rather than solely selecting it as the ideal place for an unwanted facility” (2021a, 2). In other words, racist ideologies produce sacrifice zones while justifying their ills or blaming the victims. Recognizing this, many in Cambalache take fostering local pride and a strong sense of belonging as a crucial precondition for creating a culture of caretaking. For Andreina, whose family used to work recycling materials from the landfill, a personal sense of pride and self-worth is fundamental to recognize the proper value of recycling and growing food, activities that have traditionally been associated with poverty but should not be. So it seems that the human and ecological wasting of contemporary capitalism can be fought, at least to an extent, by community-level processes of revalorizing place and questioning racist framings of the good life.\n\nIn my view, Andreina’s initiative exemplifies how place-based attachment can harmonize social and environmental values. (This kind of place-based politics is being called elsewhere in Latin America la defensa de los territorios or the “defense of [subnational] territories.”) It is my hope that El Rincón’s approach to environmental education—through composting, recycling, growing food, and raising animals—eventually gives rise to sustained discussions and programming on environmental injustice and climate justice for Cambalache and the entire city. I believe that the people of Cambalache, including the children, have a lot to say about how to tackle climate and environmental justice in the area. However, there is still a need for spaces (educational, artistic, literary) where the Cambalache perspective can solidify.\n\nAndreina Guarisma teaching drawing to the youngest students, and new teacher Yajaira Moreno in the back teaching Spanish to the older students. Photo credit: the author.\n\nWhat is the timeline? Are there already visible effects?\n\nThe initiative began in early 2022, with the afterschool program beginning in May. Our curriculum has developed considerably since the start. At first, I would read environmentally-themed stories to the children and followed with philosophical discussion about them: the ethics of relating to other animals, the value of life and diversity, etc. We also made a point of including games that foster teamwork. The next addition was mathematics education linked to practical tasks, like counting plants and distributing garden plots to grow different things. Then we started growing things with the children. The plan is to start teaching how to cook with the food they grow and how to raise a variety of animals. Andreina raises rabbits and wants to build a chicken coop, and I have proposed developing vermiculture to sell worm humus. After an exchange in June 2023 with Atilano Azuaje, the leader of an agroforestry program called La Cosecha in Santa Elena de Uairén (a town about six hundred kilometers south of Ciudad Guayana), we discussed the possibility of taking the kids there for a visit. El Rincón is eager to form networks with other food sovereignty projects.\n\nAccording to Andreina, the most important change has been in children’s attitude: they seem happier and treat each other more respectfully and kindly. They have also improved in reading, writing and math, and they stay fully engaged during lessons. Sometimes they leave us in shock. One day they were begging for an extra day of afterschool that week, so I announced solemnly that I could only return the following day if we had a math day. They jumped in joy, screaming “yaaaay, math!” More recently, however, attendance has fluctuated. I have had to suspend my weekly visits to focus on dissertation writing, but the explanation shared by current teachers is that this is in part because of some children’s work responsibilities (e.g., in street recycling or “trash picking”, landscaping) to bring an income home, but also due to the natural ups and downs in interest. We believe that a stronger recreational component and an income for teachers would allow El Rincón to organize events with the families that could make attendance more consistent.\n\nAfter the children and their families, the ones who have benefitted the most from this program are certainly Andreina and me. Andreina has grown more confident in her leadership and has been interviewed about her initiative at local radio stations, a local magazine, and was featured in a documentary. I have learned a lot about the community’s valuation of nature and their struggles for environmental justice. The next sphere of influence has been on visitors to the program who have been inspired in different ways. We are currently cultivating relationships to local food producers in the Bicentenario area of Cambalache, and with other community organizations. As these relationships strengthen, we hope for the program to become a referent on children’s rights, food sovereignty, and environmental education for the city.\n\nWho are the actors involved? What are their backgrounds?\n\nThe initiative’s leader is Andreina Guarisma. She is a mother of two and used to work as a health promoter for a local NGO. Before that, she used to work in urban waste recycling alongside her parents and siblings. Currently, Andreina works informally from home and cannot take a job in the city without forgoing care for her younger daughter.\n\nMariela Mendoza has collaborated with Andreina for years on a sister project, Juntos Hacemos la Diferencia, that brings youth from Cambalache into the city for educational activities. Mariela directs her own small nonprofit, Buscadores de Libros, which promotes reading by, among other things, helping create small community libraries like the one that got El Rincón del Saber started. Mariela is the main force behind material improvements, such as the roof on Andreina’s front porch to hold activities there.\n\nYajaira Moreno, Alvis Fuenmayor and Frank Lara are the new teachers. Yajaira is a local resident of Cambalache, she has teaching experience and superb organizational skills because of her work keeping the tabs at a well-known restaurant in front of the Orinoco River. Andreina hopes that collaborating with another woman from the community will help consolidate the initiative and provide crucial emotional support. Alvis is from the city center, in his twenties, and is passionate about sharing his love for poetry and literature with the children. Frank, the newest addition, is an enthusiastic college student doing a community service project required by Venezuelan universities.\n\nI, Pedro Monque, have been curriculum coordinator and teacher. While Andreina works with the children under 6 years old, I work with the older ones. In addition to curricular planning, I seek partnerships with other organizations. I participate in this initiative while finishing a Ph.D. in Philosophy at the CUNY Graduate Center. My research focuses on environmental philosophy in connection to issues like racism, sexism, LGBTQ oppression, and colonialism. I am also part of Latin American educational collectives like Jóvenes sin Tabú and Empoderando a Latinoamérica.\n\nAndreina Guarisma and the author. Photo credit: Andrismar Vivas (Andreina’s daughter).\n\nWhich limits (institutional, physical, social, etc.) does it encounter?\n\nBy far, the greatest limitation we face is lack of funding. The initiative is run entirely on volunteer labor. For Andreina, especially, it would be transformative to receive a monthly income that allowed her to devote herself more fully to the initiative. Andreina’s household makes around 100 USD a month in a country where covering basic needs for a family of four easily exceeds 500 USD a month. Given Andreina’s precarious economic situation, the fact that this initiative exists at all is remarkable.\n\nWe have also had difficulties finding teachers from the community, as well as enlisting active parental support for the initiative. Because the initiative specifically targets vulnerable children, parents often do not have the time or emotional wellbeing necessary to help. At a personal level, Andreina’s reliance on my support and my own lack of time have made progress slower than we would desire. However, the addition of Yajaira, Alvis and Frank have been transformative for the project, and we are all working on diversifying Andreina’s support network.\n\nDespite these financial and institutional difficulties, we have found many groups willing to collaborate. Local farmers from the Bicentenario area of Cambalache are open to visits and sharing their knowledge. A volunteer group from the city, Arepa Sonrisa, has visited to do recreational activities and share a meal. Atilano Azuaje, the leader of La Cosecha, has offered his help and counsel. The local mining company, Minera Volcán, has agreed to supply construction materials. Pediatricians from the city have volunteered medical services. My guess is that, after surmounting the relatively modest goal of funding Andreina so that she can fully commit to directing the initiative, many opportunities for deeper collaboration with local actors will open up.\n\nOur vision for this initiative is to progressively realize the following goals:\n\nTo secure financial compensation for Andreina and extra teachers so that the afterschool program runs at least three days a week.\n\nTo consolidate a work team for the initiative that includes Andreina, afterschool teachers, and special collaborators.\n\nTo start providing a meal at the afterschool program, and to source this meal as much as possible from our garden and local producers.\n\nTo include cooking classes as part of our afterschool programming.\n\nTo strengthen our environmental education component by including site visits and environmental monitoring as part of our afterschool program. We would visit local farmers, fishermen, the aqueduct, restaurants, local mining and recycling companies, the landfill, the bauxite residue waste site, and, especially, the Orinoco River and local lagoons where we want the children to learn how to test for water quality.\n\nTo have bicycles that allow us to do site visits during the afterschool programs since distances are too long to travel on foot.\n\nTo host more educational events on environmental issues (and other project-relevant issues such as nutrition or gender-based violence) for the community of Cambalache and the city.\n\nTo get networked to other food sovereignty initiatives, especially those linked to cultural (re)valorization like La Cosecha, and to go on site visits and receive visitors.\n\nTo become a referent on children’s rights, food sovereignty, and environmental education for the city and region.\n\nTo thereby become a leading voice in the fight for climate justice at the city level by highlighting strategies for mitigation and adaptation that simultaneously address histories of injustice and urgent social needs.\n\nAre any shortcomings or critical points visible? What other problematic issues can arise from its implementation?\n\nThis initiative’s greatest challenge is balancing short-term needs for education, nutrition, and health with longer-term environmental goals, such as strengthening food sovereignty in the area and addressing climate justice at greater scales. Our conviction is that the more ambitious environmental goals represent structural solutions (even if partial) to the urgent needs that got the initiative going in the first place. However, striking a balance between the short-term and the longer-term is difficult even when their interconnectedness is recognized.\n\nI do not think that this initiative is likely to have problematic effects. Rather, where it may fail is in fully developing its climate and environmental justice orientation. The children’s immediate needs are enough to keep the initiative busy while sidelining considerations of climate justice. Also, most anti-poverty work in the region fails to address root causes and ignores issues of environmental justice. Yet, to me, the focus on climate justice makes sense precisely because the initiative works with children.\n\nIf this initiative is to consolidate its climate justice orientation, it will need committed local collaborators who are knowledgeable about climate change and environmental justice. It will also need sustained funding from organizations that sponsor climate justice-based initiatives, and such funding will need to be offered alongside climate justice training for the recipients.\n\nHow would it be potentially replicable in other settings?\n\nThis initiative is replicable in any place where community gardening is viable. More than any specific activities, what characterizes this initiative is its being based on the struggles and potentialities of the place.\n\nThe greatest lesson to draw from El Rincón is that environmental goals must be harmonized with immediate human needs at the local level, especially when working in areas subjected to marginalization and impoverishment. Discovering the links between some local reality and climate change takes time. It has taken time to connect the dots from children’s wellbeing to climate justice. Indeed, only time will show how (or if) climate justice organically becomes a core element of this initiative over the years. My bet is that it will, and that the passing of time will only make climate change more pressing for El Rincón.\n\nAnother key lesson is the importance of local leadership in developing an organic interest in climate justice. Especially in impoverished communities, it is often the case that projects are executed while ignoring the agency or existing concerns of beneficiaries. Likewise, communities will often accept aid on strategic terms without identifying with broader goals. This means that projects whose goal may be to address climate change while targeting a local need (for example, planting fruit trees) might be executed by a community without thereby creating any deeper awareness of the climate crisis. So, fostering an interest in climate justice on the part of local leaders in places where such issues are not salient takes time and effort. In my opinion, there is no substitute to providing thoughtful support to an initiative for an extended period of time and helping trace the connections between existing concerns and climate change. Many aspects of the climate crisis require zooming out from a local perspective, so local leaders can really benefit from the point of view of solidary outsiders.\n\nIs this initiative conducive to broader changes (law, institutional arrangements, long-term sustainability or community preparedness, etc.)? If yes, which?\n\nThis initiative’s most immediate effect would be on community preparedness to climate change. A considerable amount of the food consumed in the city is produced outside of the region, and climate change is expected to damage Venezuelan agricultural production, so promoting food sovereignty would increase the resiliency of the community of Cambalache to food shortages. Because Cambalache is currently zoned as an industrial area, this initiative could support local farmers in achieving a re-zoning of the area, especially if El Rincón serves as the educational and planning hub for such a campaign. The re-zoning idea emerged during a tour of Cambalache I organized as part of a public environmental philosophy seminar for Ciudad Guayana I gave in the spring of 2023.\n\nMore ambitiously, we hope that El Rincón can support broader transformations in Cambalache, such as the establishment of a farmer’s market, the creation of artisanal food processing industries, and the development of Cambalache’s touristic potential as a site for river tourism, water sports, and mountain biking. The stumbling block for these projects is not just money and classism or racism but a lack of community cohesion in Cambalache that El Rincón del Saber aims to ameliorate.\n\nReferences\n\nArmiero, M.

The abandoned plant has been partly occupied by activists and citizens and re-used, through a re-signification and re-territorialization (Maggioli and Tabusi, 2016) of the former plant in ruins and the creation of a new park, spaces for the community, and an archive of the former workers.\n\nPhoto of Lago Bullicante and abandoned ruins of the shopping centre project.\n\nImages by Cecilia Pasini\n\nWhere is this grassroots initiative? Who are the promoters? Who are the beneficiaries?\n\nThe ex-Snia is located in Rome, the Italian capital city, in the neighbourhood of Pigneto–Prenestino and bordered by via Prenestina and via di Portonaccio. It is now called Parco delle Energie (Energy Park) because it became a public park as a result of the grassroots initiative. The area covers a total of 14 hectares, 6.5 of which are public. In the park stands the Park House and the Quadrato, a skate park where activities, festivals and sports tournaments are organized. The Park House, which in the past was one of the two structures used as a dormitory for factory workers, is a public space managed by the Forum Territoriale Permanente del Parco delle Energie (Permanent Territorial Forum of the Energy Park, from now on “Forum”) in agreement with the City Hall, (AAVV, 2023). The Forum is a civic body built up over the years during the activists’ struggles to protect and manage the area.\n\nThe Centro Documentazione Territoriale Maria Baccante – Archivio storico Viscosa (Maria Baccante Territorial Documentation Centre – Historical archive Viscose) is hosted in the Park House and is dedicated to a former worker and partisan in the Italian Resistance. The archive collects documents abandoned by the former Snia Viscosa direction after the closure of the firm. It is managed through an assembly that meets weekly, made by activists and inhabitants of the neighbourhood with a special biographic relationship to the plant, some of them have professional skills in the conservation of archives. The archive has an institutional recognition since 2012, when the Regional Directorate for Cultural and Landscape Heritage of Lazio recognised its value.\n\nInside the park, there is a natural lake, which leaked from the underground water table during work on the construction of a shopping centre in the early 1990s. The emergence of the lake and the consequent arrival of several people and nonhuman species, especially birds, has been an important turning point in the initiative. In a sense, the initiative is a form of creation of multispecies relationships based on the protection of commons, in which a coalition between human and nonhuman actors is made possible with relevant positive consequences.\n\nEveryone in the neighbourhood and abroad can benefit from the initiative. Thanks to the presence of the park, the community centre and the archive Maria Baccante, the place is visited by relatives of former workers who want to reconstruct their family history as well as researchers, students, industrial history enthusiasts, and even by the curious who want to learn more about the city.\n\nHow does this initiative engage with climate? Does it tackle mitigation, adaptation, both, or other dimensions of climate change?\n\nThe initiative is against soil exploitation by economic powers, the big firms and the political elites. It tries to defend the area as a common good, preserve the park, and have more places where the community can meet. Activists act to safeguard and increase biodiversity, raise among the inhabitants of the neighbourhood awareness of the importance of green areas, the development of a civic sense, and of awareness of collective goods. The initiative also tries to do something out of the waste and ruins of the deindustrialization process, with a practice that overcomes the sense of loss (Elliott, 2018). It opposes the ruination and waste of a post-industrial area, claiming the need of commoning and creating new forms of relationships (Armiero, 2021). It is also an opposition to the abandonment of the stories of the neighbourhood. The polluting plant (the industrial complex used highly toxic chemicals, such as carbon disulphide, to create rayon or artificial silk) has created a toxic and noxious heritage (Feltrin, Mah, and Brown, 2022) that has condemned the neighbourhood and its inhabitants to become a wasted community, out of sight for the most. The initiative permits to overturning this perspective by developing alternative visions for the community and its territory.\n\nAdditionally, the initiative has been made possible thanks to the emergence of human-nonhuman alliances, and the sudden and bulky entry of the urban wilderness in the area, starting with the birth of the Bullicante lake.\n\nWhat are the main objectives? What are the main values?\n\nThe main objectives concern the fight against capitalist power, privatization, resistance to overbuilding and the cementation of natural green areas. The activists want to oppose the new capitalist projects that since the Nineties have aimed to make the area at the service of private interests, asking the municipality for the expropriation of that part of the ex-Snia, which is still privately owned. They consider the park a common good that needs to be owned and used by the community without capitalist exploitation or further privatization. In the words of one of the activists: “We want to be the largest re-naturalised post-industrial settlement in Rome”. The main values concern the protection of urban nature, the importance of creating commons to fight against speculation, and the valorisation of the workers’ stories in an area with a polluted and noxious recent past.\n\nWhat is the timeline? Are there already visible effects?\n\nThe initiative’s history is intertwined with the history of the industrial plant and comes from afar. In 1922 the plant was located by the Società Generale Italiana della Viscosa (Italian General Society of Viscose) and started its activity in 1923. The choice of the location is influenced, among other reasons, by the massive presence of water in the area. In 1944 an Allied bombing raid hit the factory, severely damaging it. Despite this episode, the factory resumed operations after the Second World War, but began a considerable decline that led to the loss of labour, from over 1,600 workers in 1949 to only around 120 in 1953. The decline was accompanied by demonstrations: in 1949 there was a 40-day occupation of the factory asking to improve working conditions and wages. The factory closed in 1954. In 1969 the land became part of the Snia Viscosa estate, and by 1982 it was owned by the Società Immobiliare Snia s.r.l.\n\nIn 1990 the builder Antonio Pulcini, through the company Ponente 1978, purchased the warehouses and surrounding area (AAVV, 2023). In 1992, he started the construction of a shopping mall. During the excavation for the underground parking, the excavators eroded the Acqua Bullicante aquifer. The building site filled up with water and attempts to pump it away through the sewer system failed. On the contrary, the sewer burst and the water leaked out flooding the entire area of the nearby Largo Preneste. Then the work finally stopped (Archivio Maria Baccante, 2018). In the following years, the water level stabilised and formed a lake. Its extension is about 10,000 square meters and its depth is about 9 meters, with clean and swimmable waters. On 22 May 1992, a regional decree ordered the cancellation of the building permit for Pulcini’s project.\n\nIn 1994 the Rome City Council approved the project to turn part of the Snia Viscosa area into a public green area and started the expropriation procedure. In 1995 the former Snia is listed as an area of archaeological interest. The Snia factory is also preserved as industrial archaeology. The same year activists occupied the former warehouses to guard the park that was to be created. On this occasion, the Occupied Social Centre CSOA ex Snia opens (AAVV, 2023).\n\nIn the abandoned offices of the former factory, numerous folders with workers’ and employees’ files, drawings, plans, and blueprints of the technical office, and workers’ medical records were found, collected, and safeguarded. In 2012, the Archival Superintendency of Lazio recognised the cultural interest of the archive (Archivio Maria Baccante, 2018). Now these documents, recognised as heritage, are kept in the Park House in the Centro Documentazione Territoriale Maria Baccante – Archivio storico Viscosa, constituted in 2015.\n\nPhoto of The Centro Documentazione Territoriale Maria Baccante. Workers’ documents.\n\nImages by Cecilia Pasini\n\nThe park opened in 1997 and other areas were expropriated and made public in 2000. In 2007 the Energy Park Committee was created. This is committed to the protection of the existing park and the realisation of a broader park system. The Park Committee will later become part of the Forum. In 2011 the House of the Park and the Forum were born, the municipal administration, the Municipality of Rome VI, various associations, committees, and citizens of the neighbourhood participated in the meetings. In 2011 the WWF Pigneto Prenestino Committee is born. In 2014 a thousand people participating in a demonstration obtained the opening of the gate of the former factory and reached the lake and the public green area. The Rome City Council approved a motion tabled by an ecologist political group, which partly incorporated the demands made by the Forum for the protection of the lake, the completion of the expropriation, and the opening to the public of the area around the lake. In the same period, the Forum submitted a request for protection of the former Snia industrial complex.\n\nIn 2018 the activists presented an appeal to the President of the Lazio Region to establish the Natural Monument of the former Snia Lake and in 2019 they asked to enlarge the Natural Monument area. In 2020 the President of the Region established the “Lago ex Snia- Viscosa” Natural Monument and placed it under environmental protection. One part of the ex-Snia is still owned by the Ponente 1978 company which started a project in 2022 with the official aim of “conservative restoration and partial restructuring” (AAVV, 2023). According to the Forum and to the local WWF, the real aim is to establish in the area a logistics hub. In the same year, the Forum asks again to the local and regional authorities to enlarge the perimeter of the ex Snia – Viscosa Lake Natural Monument.\n\nWhich limits (institutional, physical, social, etc.) does it encounter?\n\nThe main problem of the initiative seems to be the big dimension of the ex-Snia area that is considered by the municipality and by the privates as a field for private investments and economic exploitation. Nowadays different parts of the area have different statuses and different forms of recognition and protection. Even if the institutions, in particular the Lazio Region, have been active in the protection of the lake, some other decisions seem to stretch out towards interests of privatization. Additionally, the strategy of the promoters of the initiative asking for preservation of the natural and archival heritage has been successful, but at the same time makes the possible future of the initiative strictly connected to the political decisions of the institutional actors.\n\nAre any shortcomings or critical points visible? What other problematic issues can arise from its implementation?\n\nThe main problem is about the private interests that threaten the stability of the initiative. The majority of the ex-Snia has been expropriated by the municipality, but a part is still privately owned by the Ponente 1978 company that is trying to establish a new economic activity.\n\nAnother threat is the condition of the buildings where the Snia had its production, which has been polluted for so many years that would need an evaluation of the ecological condition from a technical point of view.\n\nHow would it be potentially replicable in other settings?\n\nThe main strength of the initiative is the capability to build relationships inside and outside the neighbourhood. The initiative has been at the core of various academic papers and the activists are available to spread and communicate the initiative with people interested. Additionally, the aims of the initiatives the activists carried out are close to the neighbourhood needs and identity, in particular the closeness between the history of the plant and the history of families and individuals living in Prenestino.\n\nThe special occurrence of the human-nonhuman coalition is something particularly linked to the physical characteristics of the area that are difficult to reproduce in other contexts. Anyway, the idea to re-signify a former industrial area, with the appropriation of space and a memory, is something possible for the majority of the abandoned ruins of the industrial era. It can be made also by valorising and protecting the urban wilderness as well as in the ex-Snia.\n\nAnother strength of the initiative concerns the multiform knowledge and the different skills that the activists mobilise, even the more technical and scientific ones (Gissara, 2018). Everybody brings their own capabilities and previous experiences to contribute to the common good.\n\nIs this initiative conducive to broader changes (law, institutional arrangements, long-term sustainability or community preparedness, etc.)?\n\nThe initiative has been important in the political decision made by the Region since the Nineties to expropriate the ex-Snia area in order to create a Natural Monument, and for the creation in 2015 of the Centro Documentazione Territoriale Maria Baccante – Archivio storico Viscosa within the Park House. This implies that the initiative has been successful in relating with the political elites, negotiating some positive political outputs, while retaining at the same time its antagonistic and alternative role with respect to institutional politics. The process has been a real long-term initiative that is nowadays incorporated into the political, social and economic life of the neighbourhood, and the assembly is still working, asking for the expropriation of the last privately owned part of the former industrial plant. The initiative is widely recognized within Rome, and more broadly in Italy, as a successful initiative to oppose the privatisation and speculation on the industrial heritage, as well as to defend the preservation of nature and green urban spaces.\n\nReferences\n\nAA.VV.

Image with permission to use by Tarlataban.\n\nWhere is this grassroots initiative implemented? Who are the promoters? Who are the\n\nbeneficiaries?\n\nTarlataban community was formed at Boğaziçi University. Boğaziçi University is a state university in Istanbul, Turkey. The university campus is located in Beşiktaş district, Bebek neighbourhood. Tarlataban is the name of the green space where the collective was meeting for urban agriculture activities and discussions on food politics. Tarlataban literally means the field (tarla) at the bottom (taban), referring to the location of the field on the university campus.\n\nVolunteer students and academics started the initiative. They came together and asked for logistic support from the university administration, such as land for urban gardening and necessary tools. Later, people outside the university also joined the community. Those people included students from other universities, activists and ordinary citizens “with an interest in an alternative food system” as one of the earliest volunteers of the community, Mustafa says. The beneficiaries include but are not limited to the community members since Tarlataban’s influence far exceeded campus boundaries.\n\nHow does this initiative engage with climate? Does it tackle mitigation, adaptation, both or other dimensions of climate change?\n\nThe community contributes to the adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. Tarlataban positions itself within the food sovereignty movement. They embrace ecological farming principles and follow agroecology. Their methods respect the carbon cycle and climate system, and also protect and enhance biodiversity. Çiğdem, another volunteer who put her efforts into the foundation of the community and worked actively for long years, agrees with the community’s positive contribution to climate. She claims the initiative helped reduce GHG emissions by “shortening the production-consumption chain”. Mustafa adds that engaging in farming practices makes people more aware of the effects of their choices on the ecosystems. He also believes that “putting effort for an alternative food supply chain free of exploitation might be one of the many meaningful steps to take against climate change”.\n\n●What are the main objectives? What are the main values?\n\nThe community was part of a tripartite structure. The purpose was to establish a holistic food system at the campus, including a gardening community that produces food from the field; a consumer cooperative (BUKOOP – Boğaziçi Members Consumer Cooperative) that works directly with the small-scale local producers in Turkey and Tarlataban community; and a Student Cooperative that would prepare affordable, fair and healthy meals for students using the ingredients produced by Tarlataban and the producers of BUKOOP. Tarlataban strictly used only heirloom seeds and no synthetic chemicals, fertilisers or pesticides. Their ultimate purpose was not to grow food but to establish a model for urban food sovereignty. In Mustafa’s words, they were keen to “initiate and foster a debate about alternative agriculture techniques that might pave the way for a more fair, healthy, exploitation-free and ecologically-friendly food supply chain”.\n\nImage 2: Tarlataban community working together on the field in their first year. May 2012. Source: https://tarlataban.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/2012-05-06-13-04-09.jpg. Image with permission to use by Tarlataban.\n\nWhat is the timeline? Are there already visible effects? The idea for a collective agriculture initiative was born after the Starbucks Occupation at the campus towards the end of 2011 (Bostan Hikayeleri, 2017). Students occupied the shop, stating that it was the capital’s occupation of a common area that belonged to the university. They were against the neoliberal occupation of public spaces. They used the term “counter-occupation” for their activism (Kocagöz, 2012). They demanded access to fair, healthy and affordable food within the campus area.\n\nThe volunteers established the tripartite structure in 2012 with the help of the university administration. Tarlataban’s first harvest also dates to 2012. Using the products from the field, they cooked meals for students and sold them near the university cafeteria and in the small building called “Baraka” (barrack) the Student Cooperative and BUKOOP used. After the 2013 Gezi Park protests in Istanbul, the city experienced a bloom of solidarity collectives. Many other urban gardening initiatives, food cooperatives and solidarity kitchens were formed. Sometimes, Tarlataban’s harvest was excessive for a limited volunteer group to process; they shared that excess with a migrant solidarity kitchen in the city centre. The big greenhouse in the Tarlataban area was used to produce seedlings from seeds. Tarlataban opened their greenhouse for collective use. They distributed the seedlings to the other collectives in the city, for they lacked such infrastructure. The community experienced several years full of production and solidarity.\n\nImage 3: Inside Tarlataban’s greenhouse. January 2015.

The outsiders’ entries to the campus got restricted. That way, the collective started to lose its active participants. In 2016, the President of Turkey, Erdoğan, ended the democratic rectorate elections and appointed a new rector to the university (“Bogazici Kayyum Tarihcesi”, n.d.). In 2018, the appointed rectorate of the university chained the doors of Tarlataban and made the space inaccessible to the community. This marks the ending of the old Tarlataban.\n\nHowever, during those years of political turmoil, a new community was formed with the newcomer students. Among them, some had the chance to experience the old place with the founding community members. The new Tarlataban community requested entrance to the locked Tarlataban area to continue gardening activities. The administration didn’t allow them to use the old tarla; instead, showed them another place on campus. Their reasoning was that the old field was a difficult place to control and secure. In 2019, the community got their new tarla, but their seeds and gardening tools in the old place were destroyed (Tarlataban Bogazici, 2019).\n\nThe new community has been struggling hard to survive under the despotic top-down rule of the appointed administrators. Student meetings and collaborative work in the campus area are very rare because of the current atmosphere. As a result, gardening activities also freeze. Presently, volunteers stay in contact through social platforms and try to reactivate the community.\n\nWho are the actors involved? What are their backgrounds? Students who came together for the Starbucks Occupation and the Environmental Club members (a student community) constituted the founding team. They collaborated with supportive academics and communicated their requests to the university administration towards the end of 2011. Campus gardeners helped them with their first seeding in the spring of 2012. The actors diversified in time and included administrative personnel, civil servants, NGO members, activists and urban dwellers. The students came from different fields, such as social sciences, engineering and natural sciences. Most of them were urbanites without experience in agriculture, but some of their families were farmers. Some participants who joined the community outside the university shared their knowledge and experience in traditional and ecological agriculture with the Tarlataban community. During the regular weekend meetings, other initiatives visited Tarlataban. Those visitors include bicycle collectives, feminist groups, volunteers of other urban gardening collectives, musicians, journalists, documentarists, and researchers.\n\nWhich limits does it encounter?\n\nIn Tarlataban’s establishment period, Boğaziçi University had a free and democratic atmosphere compared to its recent years. The administration was supportive of student activities. The university was open to the public. People could come and join student activities on campus. For maintaining the garden work, this was important. Because, for example, in summer terms students were mostly absent, and participants coming outside did the necessary work such as irrigation. From time to time, these seasonal difficulties and the voluntary structure of the initiative were experienced as limitations by the community. However, it was a lively space that attracted people. Participants coming outside took active roles and contributed a lot. That way, the collective labour and solidarity over this urban garden continued for years.\n\nHowever, a more serious limitation for Tarlataban was Turkey’s political direction towards authoritarianism. In the 2015-2016 period, Turkey experienced a series of bomb attacks and a coup attempt that failed. Security concerns were the most prominent issue on the country’s agenda. Boğaziçi University also had its share of this situation. In 2016, Erdoğan appointed the university’s rector himself, not recognising the result of the democratic rectorate election held within the university. The new university administration first wanted the Tarlataban community to provide a list of visitors coming outside of the campus, then restricted the entrance of outsiders, then put a chain to the doors of the community garden and fired the community out of their space completely in 2018. This process corresponds to the fast anti-democratisation of Turkey.\n\nIn the following years, President Erdoğan continued to appoint administrators to many universities, including Boğaziçi. Some opposing academic and administrative staff were dismissed and banned from the university. Waves of arrests targeted the academics and students, the university campus got terrorised by the police force. This caused the forced distancing of the students from the university. When it comes to Tarlataban, some of its volunteers were imprisoned, and some were banned by the rectorate because they attended the protests on campus. Thus, in those years and at the present time, the biggest limitation for Tarlataban initiative is the autocratic rule both in the country and in the university.\n\nImage 4: Photo taken by Behram Evlice. The police handcuffed Boğaziçi University’s gate. January 2021.\n\nSource: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eq6aDc4XIAEDXqF?format=jpg&name=large.\n\nAre any shortcomings or critical points visible? What other problematic\n\nissues can arise from its implementation?\n\nThe community’s voluntary structure comes with its shortcomings regarding the maintenance of the garden work. Because the initiative was located on the university campus, holidays were hard times for people concerned about the organisation of the work. Summertimes were even more challenging, for plants needed care and irrigation when students were not around.\n\nAnother shortcoming is the scale of the initiative. The debates over food and agriculture, the activism of the community members and the agricultural production of Tarlataban were limited in scale. Its capacity was not big enough to provide fair, ecological and affordable food for the whole university. In the end, the community wanted to establish a model. Turning this model into a widespread application requires the collaboration of institutions with greater means. Civil initiatives put their efforts into multiplying such collectives throughout the city. But if the governmental bodies do not support people and even discourage them, such implementations become problematic.\n\nAnother difficulty regarding the wide-scale implementation of this model is the neoliberal-capitalist economic frame that shapes markets and agricultural activity. The rules of the game that favours commercial industry giants pose serious challenges for these small-scale initiatives to transform the food system and become significant actors.\n\nHow would it be potentially replicable in other settings?\n\nBoğaziçi community’s food sovereignty model is applicable in other university settings that support such ideas. Suppose the campus has an area that can be used for gardening activities and there are volunteers to maintain the activities. With some equipment, an initiative could easily be established.\n\nThe Tarlataban model can be modified and adapted for the local districts as well. Indeed, after the Gezi Park protests in Istanbul in 2013, this kind of solidarity movements spread throughout the city. Many other urban gardening communities and food cooperatives were formed with the assistance of the Boğaziçi experience. Some local governments provided land for community gardening and small stores for cooperative initiatives. Since these practices are alternatives to commercial businesses, having commons is important for people to come together, design and test their alternative systems. Even if the governmental bodies do not provide support, people search and find solutions to realise their utopias. However, the Tarlataban example shows that a minimum condition is necessary: the administrators and governments should not be afraid of the potential of collectives and do not prevent them from dreaming and acting together.\n\nIs this initiative conducive to broader changes?\n\nTarlataban mentally transformed and prepared its participants regarding the ecological crises, including the climate, biodiversity and food crises. Many volunteers later focused on environmental issues in their academic studies and worked for environmental NGOs. The initiative could have continued contributing to the sustainability of student life by providing ecological and affordable food. Currently, there is a severe inflation crisis in Turkey; the prices rise so fast. As a result, the quality and quantity of the food sold in the campus area decreased. Students suffer from the economic crisis greatly. If not prevented, such a holistic structure could have reduced the economic stress on students. Experiencing solidarity and community spirit would also contribute to people’s mental well-being in these hard times.\n\nSuch initiatives are also good examples for governmental bodies. Their practices can assist local governments regarding environmental and climate policy designs. Indeed, recently, Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality was reorganising a municipal park near the university and invited the Tarlataban community for collaboration. Tarlataban will survive and remind us even in the middle of a megacity like Istanbul, on a university campus, food sovereignty practices are possible and can be transformative.\n\nReferences\n\nBogazici Kayyum Tarihcesi.

Its signs were evident everywhere: the barren ground soaked, almost muddy; traces of hail on the ground; rivulets of water running down the hill. The damage was not extensive, on the contrary: the land was no longer suffering the effects of the torrential half-yearly rains, nor wasting the great resource they constituted.\n\nThe woods were bright green, the colours brought to life by the rain. They had reclaimed the mountainsides, tree by tree, tempering the searing heat that now reigned for so many months of the year.\n\nThe rivers had taken back what had been taken from them by force: so many decades of human neglect and maintenance, coupled with the exceptional weather events that had now occurred almost two centuries ago, had caused the rivers to destroy those human-made riverbanks that were too narrow for them. The course of the rivers had changed over the decades, partly renaturalised, but not completely. The Adige no longer flowed through the centre of the city. The Fersina no longer flowed straight down, instead sweeping across the plain into the areas where human animals had once slept. Now these dwellings had become the homes of other species: as the forest advanced, birds came to nest, taking advantage of the presence of the watercourse, fish wallowed in the water, preyed upon by some mammals and birds. Some animals used the ruins of human houses for their dens, while others kept their distance as if fearing the sudden return of their now-extinct owners.\n\nAfter this quick reconnaissance, it* headed for some foods, preferably some nuts, or some of the little fruit that still managed to grow in August, rigorously in the shade of the mountain. It* took the way for what the human animals once called GITAV. As it* walked, it* looked around, saw the mountains reinvigorated by the forests that had taken over the slopes that human animals had once torn up with ski lifts, a kind of transport based on metal rope that connected large bare trees; it* saw other non-human animals adapted to that torrid climate grunting in the woods, fluttering in the treetops, living their lives, unaware and perhaps consciously ignoring how much the human one had been canceled, along all the other species that had not made it.\n\nThe absence of human animals had changed the balance of species: with their disappearance, the cows, pigs, and chickens that had been kept in cages for so many millennia had dwindled to the point of near extinction, partly due to their now genetic weakness and inability to forage for food. Over the decades, those that remained had re-acclimated themselves to the forests, grasslands, mountains and hills, and by now had integrated with the other herbivores. The goats were the first to regain their stolen freedom.\n\nIn their place, the more hidden and less meek species had reclaimed their space. The woods were teeming with deer, chamois, and fawns; the riverbanks with beavers and marmots; the burrows of moles could be seen; not to mention the insects, reptiles, amphibians, and birds. Carnivores were beginning to return in large numbers after two centuries of slow repopulation.\n\nThey said that in the last decades the major effects of the Little Warm Age were easing, giving some respite to an exhausted Earth. But it* looked around, its eyes on the forests and non-human animals, and wondered who and what was exhausted: the Earth, or human rule over it?\n\nThe road to GITAV meandered around the river, then broke off and climbed slightly, then steepened in the last part. In that part of the valley, the beating sun could not penetrate the vegetation, and in the undergrowth there were berries and greedy acorns; where there had once been vineyards, there were now firs and larches, while the fruit trees had remained and even multiplied, given the influx of animals that had gone in search of food and, without perhaps knowing it, had scattered seeds.\n\nGITAV was one of its* favourite places to forage. Collective memory said it had been created by humans two centuries before. The human animal had dug it out with ‘machines’, non-living creatures he controlled at will, made of those strange inedible stones. It had hollowed out one side of the mountain east of Trent, destroying the homes of many non-human animals and even a few humans, sweeping away the trees and undergrowth.\n\nIt was said that the idea was to create a kind of path inside the mountain, through which they would pass another machine, different from the others, in which they would put food and other things that humans used. This never happened. They had started, yes, but then more or less left it at a third, caught off guard by the onset of the Little Warm Age. With its arrival, heavy rains had destroyed the banks of the valley’s rivers and flooded the entire plain. The mountains stripped of trees had failed to hold, and landslides had added to the chaos. The human animal had abandoned the valley after a few years of resistance, finding it too difficult a habitat in which to live. Many other species had come to the same conclusion, including chamois, goats, and bears, followed later by wolves.\n\nWherever we stopped, it was incredible to hear the discrepancy: first of all, silence. It was said that in the time of the human animal, the most prevalent noise was that of its machines and tools. Now, however, silence could be heard. But as soon as one’s ears got used to it, one realised that it was not silence, but a very wide range of many different sounds, noises, and sounds. The sound of water from rivers and streams, the rustling of leaves, the breaking of twigs in the undergrowth as an animal passed by. And then the grunts, groans, moans, snorts, burps, cries, howls. A cacophony of sounds that together created an incredible harmony. And all this in the light of day, or rather to the ears of those who wanted to listen, who had previously been absorbed and dazed by a multitude of negative, dangerous, frightening, and intrusive auditory stimuli. Which was more or less the same way one remembered humans.\n\nWhen humans fled, they left all their traces behind. Over time, we reclaimed their impermeable paths: mushrooms were the first to penetrate them with their spores, followed by perennial weeds and then, decades later, by scrubland.\n\nThe human dams, very different from those of the beavers, were destroyed by algae and rain, and the streams reclaimed their riverbeds. The quarries, on the other hand, remained as an eternal reminder of the wounds left by the human animal.\n\nBack in GITAV, with their exodus, this path was left unfinished. According to the original plan, the water springs from the mountain would have been plugged once and for all. Over time, however, they had eroded the rock and entered this horizontal hole. The cave that was created was therefore full of water, and as the sun shone on it for many hours, a very strong humidity was created at the entrance, which was then diluted further inland. Plants grew in this habitat that could not grow outside because of the heat. In addition, most animals were afraid to enter the cave because of the high humidity. There was always an abundance of berries and wild fruits and great peace.\n\nHad it not been for the sisterhood of the species, it* would probably have made its* lair there. It* would spend hours there eating, lying down and resting, never leaving. It* would arrive early in the morning, at first light, before the humidity could become too enveloping, and it* would not leave until the sky had turned orange, perhaps streaked with pink or violet. At that point, it* would roll in the grass, scratch itself* against the logs, smell all the essences that had changed since morning. It* runs, it* eats, it* urinates, it* grunts, it* growls. Then it* would slowly make its* way back to his den, to its* own kind, safe from predators.\n\nIn the silence of the cave it* had time to think, to let its* imagination run wild, to create futures, pasts, and presents. It* wondered what had become of the human animal. Had it become extinct like so many other species of animals and plants? Had it survived? Where did it live and how did it live?\n\nWhen it had left the valley, the human animal had gone north, away from this increasingly tropical, increasingly dry and hot climate. At first, it was said, it had climbed higher, aided and abetted by the climate that made the Highlands more habitable, but soon it was gone, unable to live in so small a space and so impervious, used to having the world at its yoke.\n\nWho knows what the North was like, what the climate was like, what the different species were like. Who knows what the North was like 200 years ago, or a few decades later, when the human animal went there in search of a future. Who knows what that future was like.\n\nWho knows what the human animal was like two hundred years ago and now, if it still exists. It was said that it was a predator. The worst of all predators: they said it was predatory even towards its own kind, its peers, its equals. Who knows if it had changed. Who knows if it still lived on violence and pain, or if the collective pain had bent it, transformed it, mutated it. Who knows what interests the human animal had? Who knows if a human animal of today would be like a human animal of two hundred years ago and would want to turn its* cave into a path, or if it would want it to become its cave instead.\n\nThese thoughts and reflections were its* own; it* shared them with no one else. Leaving the cave and returning home, it* made no mention of them. Its* secret never revealed, its* treasure not shared.\n\nNext day, same life.\n\nBy Lucia Tedesco\n\n‘A little puzzle my dad taught me when I was ten. When is someone you will love still going\n\nto be alive?’ What do you mean?’\n\n‘You’re twelve years old. When will you turn ninety?’\n\nThey jot down on a piece of paper:\n\n2090 + 90 = 2180\n\n‘Now let’s imagine your ten-year-old grandchild, born in 2170: when will that person turn ninety? When\n\nwould they still be talking about you?’\n\nThey work out the sums.\n\n‘Would it be 2260?’\n\n‘Yes, can you imagine that? The person you’ll love most in all the world will still be alive in 2260!\n\nImagine your time. I was born in 2008 and you’ll know a person who’ll still be alive in 2260.

You create the\n\nfuture every single day.’\n\n– Andri Snær Magnason, On Time and Water\n\nSeven days. Seven very long days since I found in my father’s secret hiding place the safe with my great-grandmother Emma’s things. Several times I thought of not opening it, of ignoring this discovery, but I felt the need for answers. I hope that this trip will not turn into a nightmare and that my stay here in Bologna will go unnoticed at home. I’ve been thinking for a long time whether or not to tell my father about this trip. In the end, the least complicated solution for everyone seemed to leave without telling him. I know it is dangerous, that nobody would think of going over the border at the beginning of the Crazy Season, but I am sure that for my father the answer would have been the same at any other time: “Ophelia, no, you cannot go”. Too many memories for him, I understand. Not to mention that in the Crazy Season the weather is extremely variable: some days it can reach 40 degrees and then suddenly there can be heavy rain for up to 72 hours straight. My grandmother used to say that it didn’t used to be like this. There used to be half seasons, periods of transition from too cold to too hot temperatures and vice versa. The Crazy Season, on the other hand, lasts 40 days and for the rest of the time the temperatures stay around 27-30 degrees.\n\nEver since I found that diary, I can’t stop thinking about it. I have fantasised for days about the idea of taking a trip to old Bologna, to the place where – according to my great-grandmother Emma – a city stood until not so long ago.\n\nI have a hard time imagining a city. There hasn’t been one for so long that I couldn’t distinguish it from any other inhabited place. My grandmother used to say that they were born for the purpose of distinguishing human from non-human space.\n\nMy brothers and I did not understand at first: how is it possible to live while ignoring other species? How is it even conceivable to survive without being surrounded by greenery? I probably won’t understand – we will never understand – yet my curiosity is now uncontrollable. I feel that I can no longer put off this moment. I feel I must discover my roots.\n\nI just arrived on the aerotrain. The sky here is strange, constantly changing. I have Emma’s diary with me, an acclimatising mask, and the satellite in case of emergency. I try to get my bearings with a map from 2023 that I found among Emma’s things, but it’s very difficult. There is tall grass everywhere, remnants of buildings from time to time, some clearly visible others less so because they are swallowed up by a strange form of ivy.\n\nI open the diary and start reading again:\n\nThere is buzz in the city these days. 25 April is celebrated in a big way here. Via del Pratello is invaded by streams of people arriving from all over Italy. Few are the citizens of Bologna, many are the out-of-towners, mostly students. Friends from Florence came up. We sang “Bella ciao” in the square in chorus, as we do every year. Then we moved to the centre; at Pratello it was almost impossible to walk, talk, and breathe. We stopped in Piazza del Nettuno, still laughing at the statue’s hand thinking of Giambologna. They wanted to whisper things to each other under the vault of the Podestà, but I was too tired, so I headed home.\n\nLooking around, I see a perimeter of a strange dark stone. What’s left of the marble, I suppose. I move closer to get a better look at it. I trample the grass to trace a path; I climb over the low wall and find myself in a pool. I begin to be more certain of where I am: it must be the fountain of Neptune, even though there is no longer any trace of the statue. Now that I have a point to start from on the map I can orient myself better. I pick up the diary again and continue reading at the point where I had stopped:\n\nI avoided Via Indipendenza. Everyone knows that on holidays it is a jungle. I preferred to continue on via Rizzoli and go down via Oberdan. I will miss all the side streets, all the red bricks of the buildings. I will miss peeking in the doorways and looking at the inner courtyards. I will miss the taverns, the people in the streets, under the arcades drinking and talking. When I can, I will continue to enjoy this. There weren’t many people on Via Oberdan. Only a few tourists stopped at the Prosciutteria, unaware of the annual magic that is created at Pratello. Almost at the end of the street I noticed that the canal was full of water and the view was strangely crowded. People are usually unaware that Bologna’s canals are visible in several places, so they queue up on Via Piella to get a tiny glimpse. They call it the secret Venice, but it has nothing Venetian or secret about it.\n\nI stop at this point, I want to get back on track. Above all, I am curious to see what a canal is like. The temperatures are beginning to rise. I look around for nearby shade, I don’t want to risk walking for too long in the sun’s harmful rays.\n\nThe streets are not so well traced and visible now, but I realise I have to go north because before leaving I read something about the morphology of Bologna and apparently the northern part of the city is lower than the one to the south. I spot a building with a tower and choose it as a reference point to shelter from the increasingly hot sun. I hear a noise, a strange thud in the distance, but I decide to ignore it. I admit that I am starting to feel a little scared, but I am used to sudden encounters where I live, and above all I have not travelled so many kilometres to run away at the first doubt.\n\nI keep walking and arrive at the spot where my great-grandmother said there should be an overlook to the canal. Yet, of the canal, no trace. A wide clearing now opens up before my eyes, which I decide not to enter. At this point, according to my calculations, I should not be too far away. I consult the diary again:\n\nVia delle Moline welcomes the university area. It still makes me strange to think that the canals have been covered over and that I live in a house that long before had been a mill. The first street on the left, leaving Via Oberdan behind, is Via Capo di Lucca. There, amidst new buildings and brick houses, my nest emerges. A mansard flat far too big for one person. I will never forget the first time I saw it, the sense of home I felt; just\n\nas I will never forget when I no longer felt safe. That time when the rain came down for\n\nthree long weeks incessantly. That time I was forced to sleep on the sofa in the kitchen, the place most hidden by the skylights, fearing that I would end up with water everywhere, just as was happening in the bedroom. Everything that used to give me security, peace, serenity now frightens me, terrifies me, generates anxiety. I no longer feel safe even in my own home. I feel I will soon leave this city.\n\nEmma’s diary stops here. Or rather, what remains of it. The tears make me suspect that there is a part of her story that I will never know.\n\nI set off again, but after a few steps I am forced to stop: a not too large pond prevents me from turning into via Capo di Lucca. The pond is via Capo di Lucca. I look around to see which way to cross it. Among the reeds I glimpse a roof and something tells me that I am close to what I am looking for. Suddenly, a strange animal emerges from the water with a hairy, matted coat, a long tail that they wave slowly and gills on his sides. They become aware of my presence and remain motionless for a few seconds. You don’t see animals like that in my neck of the woods, so I can’t quite make out what I’m looking at. Something about them reminds me of a feline: their moving silently, their attentive, cunning gaze. Felines in my neck of the woods are not amphibians, so this confuses me. I keep looking around in search of a support to cross the body of water, and so I spot an old abandoned bottega. But as I try to make my way inside, the animal makes a dash for it and disappears back into the water.\n\nThe inside of the bottega is partly covered. On the uncovered side, the sun illuminates an object I havenever seen. I decide to curb my curiosity and concentrate on finding the stand; also because it is getting warmer and soon I will have to shelter in the shade for more hours. Behind me, I notice that the door is not quite firm. I try to pull it off with some force and, after a few attempts, I find it in my hands, heavy enough to make me lose my balance. I drag it to the shoreline of the pond and try to climb on it a little awkwardly. I try to push the water with my hands to move from there and realise that I make this gesture spontaneously. Tired and on the verge of giving up, I stop for a few moments, when again the noise from before calls my attention: there, among the reeds in the middle of the pond, I glimpse a small house half submerged. Again, instinct tells me that I am close to my destination. I am about to pick up the pace, when a force under the door takes over and pushes me there: I see its tail, I suspect that it might be the creature I encountered just before. I am frozen with fear, I cannot make a sound. When we reach the front of the dwelling, they stop. I breathe a sigh of relief. I try to figure out how to reach the interior of the strange island, but my heart is still pounding. At this point, the animal starts moving more slowly again. I have the feeling that they have not come to harm me and that, on the contrary, they want to help me in some way. Like a spirit guide. We pass through a semi-underwater arch and walk down the long corridor. With my hands I grip the raft tightly. Slowly we approach a more or less walkable staircase. I take courage and jump onto the first accessible step, hoping it will hold my weight. Now I can see my helper. Our glances cross. I nod my head in thanks, I’ve seen this gesture in some sci-fi movie, I’m not sure they will understand. They give me one last look and disappear beneath the surface again. I am alone again – I think. I start to move from step to step, avoiding the gaps and trying to feel the condition of the structure with my foot first. The temperature is different now: it is still very hot, but something seems to be obscuring the sun. I can’t see from there. I continue up the last three steps and at the sight of the floor, my stomach closes. I have the feeling that I have already been there, that I have already seen this place. I pick up the diary and hurriedly try to open the pocket inside the cover. I hear a loud bang outside, but I don’t let myself be distracted. I knew it. I could hear it. Among the notes stored in the secret pocket, a picture of Emma’s house pops out. The house she loved so much and then hated as well. I’m in the right place. Now I just have to look for something, to look for it. Now I can reconstruct my story. Her story. A heavy drop falls on my head. It starts to rain\n\nPsychogeographic map of Bologna made by Ophelia\n\nA grassroot initiative going beyond mere food production.\n\nBy Maximilian Rischer\n\n*München ist ein Dorf = “Munich is a village“\n\nPhoto 1: Volunteers on the fields gardening near the city of Munich. (Photo: Kartoffelkombinat eG)\n\nWhere is the grassroot initiative implemented?\n\nThe grassroot initiative Kartoffelkombinat is located in Munich, a city of about 1.5 million inhabitants in Germany. The initiative is organized as a cooperative, owned by all members equally, and is not limited to a certain neighbourhood but spreads throughout the entire city.\n\nWho are the promoters? Who are the beneficiaries?\n\nKartoffelkombinat was founded by two citizens of Munich, Daniel Überall and Simon Scholl, who wanted to make a difference in how they consume vegetables and agricultural products.\n\nThe origin of the organization’s name:\n\n“Kartoffel” = Potato; “Kombinat” = Collective combine (typical way of production in many socialist countries, (Farlex, n.d.)\n\nThe two founders were disappointed that despite the option that food can be produced regionally, ecologically friendly, without too much packaging and transport, in many cases supermarkets offer only low-quality cheap food, packed in tons of plastics, and shipped from abroad. The first beneficiaries were family and friends at the beginning of 2012 during a test phase of the project. Then, Kartoffelkombinat officially was founded on 30th April 2012. Since then, many citizens of Munich and surrounding areas have been part of the organization (Kartoffelkombinat eG, 2022).\n\nIn 2023, about forty people are currently working for the organization. However, the initiative continues to flourish also as volunteering becomes the norm. Many helping hands guarantee the organization’s success as I will illustrate in this entry.\n\nFurthermore, smallholder farmers may profit from this project because they work as partners on equal terms for the organization. Given the strong pricing competition of conventional agriculture, they profit, because Karfoffelkombinat, despite owning farmland, leases land from smallholders and gives them some additional income. At the same time, farmers are encouraged to use more ecologically friendly agricultural practices, as Kartoffelkombinat so successfully does.\n\nIn 2023, agricultural products generated by the Kartoffelkombinat provide food products on a weekly basis for more than 2,000 households (Kartoffelkombinat eG, n.d.-b)!\n\nBut, as we will see in the following, it is not only food which is the “outcome” of this grassroot initiative.\n\nHow does this initiative engage with climate change? Does it tackle mitigation, adaptation, both, or other dimensions of climate change?\n\nThe initiative is tackling climate change mitigation by providing more regional and seasonal food, educating people, and raising awareness about conventional and more environmentally friendly agricultural practices. Food losses and overproduction is minimized. It may happen that certain summer vegetables, like tomatoes or cucumbers, are being produced to a surplus extent. In these cases, excess vegetables are processed and canned, with the help of volunteers from the cooperative. Vegetables that even organic wholesalers and retailers do not accept, e.g., rooked cucumbers, small heads of lettuce, or small cucumbers are still put into boxes (Kartoffelkombinat eG, 2015). Also, the cooperative produces mainly vegan goods, and very few products are associated with animals (like honey). Besides, non-dairy products typically have a smaller greenhouse gas footprint (Carlsson Kanyama et al., 2021).\n\nThe initiative further contributes to climate change mitigation by reducing the production of crop packaging and by ensuring an efficient and safe food transportation system. Furthermore, since the initiative aims to follow principles of organic farming exclusively, due to the absence of artificial fertilizer whose production is energy-intensive, greenhouse gas emissions are avoided. According to a meta-analysis by Tuomista et al. (2012), organic farming uses 21% less energy on average compared to conventional farming. The same study also associates a higher carbon sequestration potential, which generally results in increased soil organic matter (7% difference), compared to conventional farming practices.\n\nAs another effect, more soil organic matter increases the water-withholding capacity of the soil (Lotter et al., 2003; Tuomisto et al., 2012). Additionally, rotating crops and a more diverse vegetation as typical for organically farmed soil, prevent soil erosion and strengthen the capacity and resilience of soils to cope with extreme weather circumstances like extreme drought and floods (Dumaresq & Greene, 2001; Nair & Delate, 2016; Pimentel et al., 2005). The resilience of the soils gets further enhanced through fertilization using “natural” input, through manure, compost, or straw (Nair & Delate, 2016).\n\nAll of this qualifies the grassroot initiative to significantly contribute to climate change adaptation.\n\nWhat are the main objectives and main values of the initiative?\n\nThe broader objective of the cooperative Kartoffelkombinat is to develop an independent, highly democratic, and self-organizing institution to provide good quality food, which is organized, grown, harvested, and eaten by people, for people of the organization. The organization is structured as a cooperative. People can buy shares, to get weekly food rations in exchange throughout the year. As of 2023, the cooperative owns agricultural land of about 7 ha and employs more than 40 people for activities like cultivation, harvesting, and organization, fourteen of whom work in gardening activities.\n\nIn addition, many people help on a voluntary basis to enable the functioning of the project. An example of this voluntary work is that the food is transported to various private spaces (e.g., garages) all around Munich, to work as distribution spots, where members of the Kartoffelkombinat can collect the goods from. This voluntary work is thus crucial for the success of the initiative. Aside from employed gardeners, everybody may contribute to harvesting and cultivation activities.\n\nSubsequent to an one-time payment of 150 € (“buy-in” to the cooperative), every member can choose to pay each month about 75 € or about 47 € (for a smaller box) to receive one box with agricultural products per week. To facilitate the planning and to reduce food losses, each member is expected to pay this amount as long as the member is part of the cooperative. In case members are not available or do not wish to receive food, they get the opportunity to suspend the delivery of food four times a year, which aims to further reduces food waste. Examples of what people receive in each box are illustrated in the following, see also photo 2:\n\nWeek 19: 3 apples, 500 g rhubarb, Batavia lettuce, 1 bunch rocket, 400 g spinach, 1 bunch carrots, 2 pieces kohlrabi.\n\nWeek 28: 1 stick fresh garlic, 1.5kg potatoes, 2 courgettes,\n\n0.5kg tomatoes, 400g chard, 1 lettuce, 1 cucumber, 1 bunch basil.\n\nWeek 43: 1 head of lettuce, 600g carrots, 600g red cabbage, 500g onions, 600g tomatoes, 2 pieces of fennel, 500g spinach, 1 bunch of chives.\n\nBesides this, high-quality bread made by a partnering baker and beer produced by the members of the cooperative may be purchased for some additional payment.\n\nKartoffelkombinat does not only want to provide regional and ecological food but re-think the consumerist lifestyle as it is typical for Western societies. Furthermore, Kartoffelkombinat aims to redefine “welfare”, by strongly advocating for public welfare instead of profit maximization. Through the community approach, economic sovereignty and decisions remain in the hands of citizens. Furthermore, the aim is also to preserve knowledge about agricultural techniques for future generations.\n\nThere are a set of advantages of the community-based agriculture approach. This entails, that their goods are mostly vegan (no dairy products and meat), that ecological production is taken up, that goods are more eco-friendly regarding packaging and transport, and that all food is regional and seasonal. Also, local smallholder farms are being supported to survive in the midst of a costly power struggle involving powerful corporations (Kartoffelkombinat eG, n.d.-a).\n\nFrom an organizational and economic point of view, Kartoffelkombinat follows the principles of the Economy of the Common Good (Gemeinwohlökonomie), which was officially certified in 2016 (Kartoffelkombinat eG, 2016). As the name indicates, companies that follow these economic principles aim to maximize the benefit for society, instead of the corporation’s financial profit. An organization that wants to be certified is evaluated within the organization, but also towards suppliers and clients, against the following principles (Gemeinwohlökonomie Deutschland, n.d.-b):\n\nDignity of every human being;\n\nEcological sustainability;\n\nSolidarity with vulnerable groups;\n\nSocial justice;\n\nEmpowerment and transparency;\n\nWhat is the timeline? Are there already visible effects?\n\nThe initiative started in 2012, and it is still operational since it has strong supporters and many participants. The positive effects of the initiative are all too obvious. Almost 3,000 households are being provided with food on a weekly basis, and the organization has developed from a small CSA cooperative to an organization which provides so much more to the community and the city (see examples and more info later in this entry, Kartoffelkombinat eG, n.d.-c).\n\nWho are the actors involved? What are their backgrounds?\n\nRegarding their prior work experience, the actors involved in the organization’s management have different backgrounds. For instance, people are coming from advertising agencies, the IT sector, photography, and simply higher education. Despite employing professionals from the agricultural sector, Kartoffelkombinat also offers apprenticeships to become a professional vegetable farmer. Like this, the organization attracts young people. Usually, shareholders, consumers, and collaborators have some financial stability and moderate purchasing power.\n\nWhich limits (institutional, physical, social, etc.) does it encounter?\n\nThe organization has evolved to an organization where hundreds of people collaborate and thousands more benefit from it. However, these huge dimensions would at some point lead to organizational limits or at least huge challenges to cope with. Some more organizational growth to reach even more people seems difficult.\n\nAs outlined above, the Kartoffelkombinat follows the principles of the Economy of the Common Good which comprises reporting about the organization’s values and activities along economic principles. However, surprisingly enough, the organization has only published one report back in 2016. The lack of information on the organization casts a shadow on its future potential and seems to be motivated by a lack of resources, rather than a result of a lack of intention to follow the prescribed principles and values.\n\nAre any shortcomings or critical points visible? What other problematic issues can arise from its implementation?\n\nThe buy-in policy and the relatively high monetary amount of the monthly share indicate that not everybody might be able to afford the involvement in the organization. Thus, certain layers of society might be excluded. On a different level, Kartoffelkombinat could be competing against farmers who follow organic farming principles. Because these farmers likely could not rely on people working for them as volunteers (for “free”), they would need to offer their products at higher prices. Like this, clients of these farmers potentially could tend to buy fewer products from them, but rather use the services offered by Kartoffelkombinat. It is however unclear if this problem deserves attention because the coverage of Kartoffelkombinat (reaching almost 3,000 households) still seems very insignificant compared to the number of inhabitants residing in the city of Munich.\n\nHow would it be potentially replicable in other settings?\n\nIt is an initiative which can be replicated in many other areas or cities as well. People willing to start a similar initiative only would need to find agricultural associates to start farming. Noteworthy, Kartoffelkombinat had similarly humble beginnings. Additionally, many networking events and information about the activities of regional groups coming from many countries, are provided by the European CSA Research Group (2016).\n\nIs this initiative conducive to broader changes (law, institutional arrangements, long-term sustainability or community preparedness, etc.)? If yes, which?\n\nKartoffelkombinat is promoting and influencing societal change in a broader sense in many ways. Apart from the current organization (Kartoffelkombinat eG), a non-profit association which offers much more than agricultural goods, called Kartoffelkombinat – Der Verein e.V., was founded by the members. The association (in German “Verein”) aims to enable a cultural change in many different parts of society, related to exchange within the community, societal transformation, education, ecology, and research. Examples of each field of activity will be illustrated at the end of this entry. At this point though, two examples will be described in more detail:\n\nExample 1: ErdLink – A cottage garden transforming the street city (Original in German: Der ErdLink – ein Bauerngarten wandelt die Straßenstadt)\n\nAs one might discover from the name, ErdLink aims to create a connection (link) between Earth’s inhabitants (German: Erdlinge) and nature in urban environments which would have remained inaccessible if the project had not been initiated.\n\nThe ErdLink had been a temporary pop-up agriculture area in a concrete-dominating square of Munich (Europaplatz) in September 2021. Specifically, the “nature” of a traffic island was used to create an area for urban gardening.\n\nErdLink aimed for and succeeded in the following objectives:\n\nTo make formerly inaccessible nature accessible for citizens;\n\nTo demonstrate that supply with agricultural goods is possible, in dense urban environments;\n\nTo increase the city’s quality of life to make it unnecessary for citizens to travel outside the city to enjoy nature\n\nFor the project, huge boxes were transported to the area, which contained grown regional and seasonal vegetables, herbs, and other flowering plants, e.g., bell peppers, basil, leek, or sunflower. The content of the boxes was crafted in such a way that anyone could easily grow them in their private properties, both in gardens and balconies. Visitors of ErdLink could also take plants or seeds home. Pictures 3 and 4 illustrate how ErdLink looks like.\n\nPhoto 3: ErdLink at Europaplatz in Munich (Photo: Nick Bergner)\n\nPhoto 4: Plant boxes from ErdLink (Photo: Nick Bergner)\n\nMost of the nearby living citizens and visitors liked this setting pretty much and associated it with an increase in life quality in the urban environment. Apart from realising a significant change in the appearance of the urban environment, ErdLink also brought along various activities to learn about agriculture, through seminars, workshops, and information campaigns. Examples were guided tours through the ErdLink area, a guided city tour focusing on green and “nature” space in other parts of the city, public readings of children’s books related to nature, or online seminars to inform about urban gardening and urban nature in general.\n\nThe entire project was considered by the organizers as very informative and successful as learning was willingly shared between organizers, visitors, and nearby living citizens, who shall take it as input for similar projects in the future. But until today, though, no similar project has been announced so far for the near future (LORA MÜNCHEN, 2021; Meincke, 2021).\n\nExample 2: Discovering Big City Wilderness… (German: Großstadtwildnis entdecken…)\n\nDiscovering Big City wilderness was a project executed in August 2021 by offering six four-hour long guided tours for children and young adults through a biotope in the neighbourhood of Obersendling in Munich. Obersendling is a district which is currently undergoing a transition and is characterised by a high degree of density. This makes the natural surroundings in and around Siemenspark even more important to remain recognizable for the citizens of the neighbourhood. The main parts of the discovery tours for the all-in-all 60 participants were: discovering dead wood, trees, meadows, waste or trails used by humans. Among the activities were nature observation, multicolour meadow items collection, man-nature relation"
