It’s as if our political leaders, our government bureaucrats and far too many in our media don’t realize that hot weather comes around this time every year.\n\n“A prolonged heat event continues through Friday. Dangerously hot and humid conditions are expected,” the Environment Canada heat warning stated.\n\n“The health risks are greater for older adults, infants and young children, pregnant people, people with physical and/or mental illnesses, and people with disabilities or mobility issues. Never leave people, particularly children, or pets inside a parked vehicle.”\n\nStating this is fine, letting people know to get ready is fine but the constant bombardment of news reports and fretting about the temperature is a bit much.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nI’ve had to turn off the news channels to stop hearing warning after warning not to go outside at all.\n\nDo they think we’re all going to die because the temperature is a little higher than usual? That’s how the news anchors and the “experts” they are bringing on are acting.\n\nCries of heat dome now accompany any indication of slightly above average temperatures just like every cold snap is now labelled a polar vortex. Have people lost their memories of summers and winters past or have they just lost their minds?\n\nI get it for the media — weather stories sell.\n\nThere is a reason every media outlet covers weather stories and goes to town on extreme weather stories like hurricanes because the public gobbles them up. It’s the same reason we have a TV network devoted to weather and why the most popular part of the federal government’s vast network of websites is the weather page.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nCanadians love talking about, reading about and fretting about the weather.\n\nThe temperature reached 32 on Tuesday and 30 on Monday. For both days that’s a bit above the average high of 24 degrees but going over 30 degrees in June is hardly unheard of. The record temperature in Toronto for June 17 was 33.9 degrees set in 1957, on June 18, 1994, the city hit a record high of 36.2 and on June 19, 1995, we hit 35.5.\n\nWho doesn’t remember a few school years where the last few weeks of school were spent taking class outside, turning the lights off and turning on fans, even being told by teachers to just put your head down on your desk due to the heat. The warm nights were always welcomed as a great time to get outside and play, staying out even later than usual due to the heat.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIt’s good that the city is opening up more pools and extending the hours, that’s what should happen when it gets hot. But the never-ending warnings of the looming weather apocalypse need to stop.\n\nThe higher temperatures are a risk to some people, but those people know how to handle these sorts of situations because they deal with them every year. If we have people at risk in our lives, then of course we should check in on them.\n\nBeyond that, we should embrace the warm weather, revel in it really. Before we know it, we will be back in winter hearing warnings about the coming polar vortex and how dangerous it all is.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
