The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases.\n\nHumidity\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe perceived humidity level in Canora, as measured by the percentage of time in which the humidity comfort level is muggy, oppressive, or miserable, does not vary significantly over the course of the year, staying within 2% of 2% throughout.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in Canora\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in CanoraJanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec0%0%10%10%20%20%30%30%40%40%50%50%60%60%70%70%80%80%90%90%100%100%Mar 120%Mar 120%Jul 194%Jul 194%NowNowcomfortablecomfortabledrydry\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Canora experiences mild seasonal variation over the course of the year.\n\nThe windier part of the year lasts for 8.2 months, from September 24 to May 30, with average wind speeds of more than 9.9 miles per hour.

Those scores are combined into a single hourly composite score, which is then aggregated into days, averaged over all the years in the analysis period, and smoothed.\n\nOur cloud cover score is 10 for fully clear skies, falling linearly to 9 for mostly clear skies, and to 1 for fully overcast skies.\n\nOur precipitation score, which is based on the three-hour precipitation centered on the hour in question, is 10 for no precipitation, falling linearly to 9 for trace precipitation, and to 0 for 0.04 inches of precipitation or more.\n\nOur tourism temperature score is 0 for perceived temperatures below 50Â°F, rising linearly to 9 for 65Â°F, to 10 for 75Â°F, falling linearly to 9 for 80Â°F, and to 1 for 90Â°F or hotter.\n\nOur beach/pool temperature score is 0 for perceived temperatures below 65Â°F, rising linearly to 9 for 75Â°F, to 10 for 82Â°F, falling linearly to 9 for 90Â°F, and to 1 for 100Â°F or hotter.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Canora typically lasts for 4.1 months (125 days), from around May 17 to around September 19, rarely starting before April 30 or after June 3, and rarely ending before September 2 or after October 6.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in Canora\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in Canoragrowing seasonJanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec0%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%May 1750%May 1750%Sep 1950%Sep 1950%Jun 390%Jun 390%Sep 290%Sep 290%Apr 3010%Apr 3010%Oct 610%Oct 610%0%Nov 260%Nov 26Jul 16100%Jul 16100%NowNowfrigidfreezingcoldcoolcomfortablewarmvery cold\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nBased on growing degree days alone, the first spring blooms in Canora should appear around May 12, only rarely appearing before May 2 or after May 26.\n\nGrowing Degree Days in Canora\n\nGrowing Degree Days in CanoraJanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec0Â°F0Â°F200Â°F200Â°F400Â°F400Â°F600Â°F600Â°F800Â°F800Â°F1,000Â°F1,000Â°F1,200Â°F1,200Â°F1,400Â°F1,400Â°F1,600Â°F1,600Â°FMay 1290Â°FMay 1290Â°FJul 27900Â°FJul 27900Â°FDec 311,550Â°FDec 311,550Â°FNowNow\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy experiences extreme seasonal variation over the course of the year.\n\nThe brighter period of the year lasts for 3.7 months, from April 28 to August 17, with an average daily incident shortwave energy per square meter above 5.6 kWh. The brightest month of the year in Canora is July, with an average of 6.7 kWh.\n\nThe darker period of the year lasts for 3.6 months, from October 25 to February 14, with an average daily incident shortwave energy per square meter below 2.0 kWh.

Within 10 miles is essentially flat (197 feet). Within 50 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (1,250 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Canora is covered by cropland (86%) and artificial surfaces (13%), within 10 miles by cropland (92%), and within 50 miles by cropland (74%) and trees (18%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Canora, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 4 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Canora.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Canora according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Canora is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Canora and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nYorkton Municipal Airport (CYQV, 61%, 26 mi, south, 39 ft elevation change)\n\nSwan River, Man. (CWEQ, 16%, 61 mi, northeast, -495 ft elevation change)\n\nWynyard Marine Aviation Reporting Station (CWOY, 12%, 76 mi, west, 243 ft elevation change)\n\nHudson Bay Airport (CZHB, 11%, 82 mi, north, -420 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Canora and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
