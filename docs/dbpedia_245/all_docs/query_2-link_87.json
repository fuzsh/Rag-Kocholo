        "text": "Saskatchewan saw another day of record-breaking temperatures Wednesday.\n\nA mass of warm Pacific air has parked itself in the province, causing warm weather records to fall in 21 communities.\n\nAccording to Environment Canada data released late Wednesday evening, the following communities set new high temperature marks for Jan. 18:\n\nAssiniboia: 5.8 C (Old record: 5 C set in 1991)\n\nBroadview: 4.9 C (Old record: 3.5 C set in 1991)\n\nCollins Bay: -0.9 C (Old record: -1.9 C set in 2009)\n\nCoronach: 5.3 C (Old record: 5 C set in 1981)\n\nElbow: 8.2 C (Old record: 3.2 set in 2009)\n\nIndian Head: 4.2 C (Old record: 4 C set in 1991)\n\nKey Lake: 3 C (Old record: 2.7 C set in 2009)\n\nLast Mountain Lake: 5.7 C (Old record: 3.7 set in 2009)\n\nLeader: 9.3 C (Old record: 7 C set in 1981)\n\nLucky Lake: 7.6 C (Old record: 3.7 C set in 2009)\n\nMaple Creek: 12.2 C (Old record: 10.1 C set in 2014)\n\nMelfort: 4.9 C (Old record: 4 C set in 1991)\n\nRegina: 4.7 C (Old record: 4.2 C set in 1991)\n\nRockglen: 6.8 C (Old record: 5 C set in 2009)\n\nRosetown: 5.9 C (Old record: 5.6 C set in 1919)\n\nSaskatoon: 6.7 C (Old record 5 C set in 1923)\n\nScott: 4.4 C (Old record: 4.1 C set in 2009)\n\nStony Rapids: -0.4 C (Old record: -1.7 C set in 1977)\n\nWatrous: 6.4 C (Old record: 4 C set in 2009)\n\nWynyard: 6.2 C (Old record: 2.4 C set in 1991)\n\nYorkton: 4.6 C (Old record: 3.4 C set in 1991)\n\nWednesday was the second-straight day of record-breaking weather, with seven communities setting new high marks Tuesday.\n\nEnvironment Canada reported that warmer-than-usual temperatures are expected to continue throughout the week.\n\nMessy roads, cars\n\nThe mid-January thaw has led to dirty road conditions province-wide, with melting snow mixing with dirt and road salt.\n\nLineups were noticed at several car wash businesses in Saskatoon, but the wet conditions led some to stay away.\n\n“You can’t drive two feet without getting your car dirty,” said Derek MacDonald with Golf’s Car Wash. “It will be lined up next week when it dries up.”\n\nAbout 22 people were in the wash bay over a span of an hour Wednesday.\n\n“It’s crazy dirty out there, but I have to wash my car,” said Shawn Olson, who washes his car once a week in the winter time. “I like getting the road grime and salt off the vehicle.”\n\nDrivers are recommended to have extra windshield washer fluid on-hand, as spray from other vehicles can affect visibility on the road.\n\n-With files from JT Marshall"
