        "text": "The recent heatwave has looked like it has passed, with maximum temperature records being set all throughout Western Canada.\n\nIn Yorkton, the heatwave saw ten consecutive days with the temperature reaching over 25°​C, including five straight days of over 30°​C.\n\nBoth July 2 (34.7°​C) and July 3 (35.6°​C) had record highs in Yorkton. The heatwave was just a wrap to an already hot June, with June 2 and June 3, also seeing record highs of 31.7°​C and 33.5°​C.\n\nThough it was hot in Yorkton, other parts of Canada were feeling the heat as well as a new all-time record high temperature for Canada of 49.6°​C being set in Lytton, BC on June 29. Lytton set a new all-time high for Canada on three consecutive days, with highs of 46.6, 47.9, and 49.6°​C on June 27, 28, and 29. These extreme temperatures beat the long-standing record high for Canada of 45.0°​C set on July 5, 1937 in Midale and Yellow Grass, SK.\n\nAfter this heatwave, 14 of the 15 hottest temperatures in Canadian history were now set between June 27 to 29."
