The audio files are updated as soon as new forecasts or observations are available. There is also information available about other services.\n\nOn November 15, 2021, the Hello Weather service was launched, and now automated weather information is delivered through 2 national toll-free lines. Hello Weather has expanded this service to now include over 800 locations across Canada, from the original 148 locations served by the previous automated telephone system. Canadians can call from anywhere in the country and select their location from a directory where location codes are listed by province."
