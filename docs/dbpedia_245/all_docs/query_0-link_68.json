        "text": "Immigration cannot be considered in isolation. Welcoming newcomers is intrinsically linked to housing, health care, education and infrastructure in our communities. These important issues require continued and enhanced collaboration among all levels of government recognizing that, in particular, the challenge of finding affordable housing is acute for many Canadians and newcomers. Immigration can be part of the solution to challenges in these areas by bringing in people and innovative ideas to help address these challenges, and by reversing demographic trends, especially in small and rural communities that depend on immigration to drive population and economic growth. At the same time, we must continue to have a well-managed immigration system, one that has historically resulted in public support for immigration in Canada.\n\nCanada’s immigration system is considered world class. However, population trends, migration patterns and international challenges are evolving. To maintain our country’s cultural vibrancy, resiliency and innovative and economic capacity, we must adapt to address the pressures.\n\nOur current immigration system\n\nThe immigration system has been under strain. The COVID-19 pandemic caused shutdowns and operational delays around the world, and led to significant backlogs and processing delays. There has been significant progress, but there is still more work to do. IRCC has been exploring and implementing new digital solutions, adding processing resources and streamlining the way individuals apply for our services.\n\nAs a result, processing times for key categories of applications are decreasing.\n\nProcessing timesFootnote * (in months) of select permanent residence lines of business and citizenship grants, October 2021 to July 2023\n\nSource: IRCC\n\nText version: Processing times (in months) of select permanent residence lines of business and citizenship grants, October 2021 to July 2023\n\nSelect permanent residence lines of business and citizenship grants Oct 2021 Apr 2022 Oct 2022 May 2023 July 2023 Quebec-selected skilled workers 26 31 22 20 17 Provincial Nominee Program 18 27 14 18 17 Provincial Nominee Program – Express Entry 6 22 15 10 9 Canadian Experience Class 6 9 19 5 5 Spouses, partners and children (except for Quebec) 18 19 16 14 13 Citizenship grants 26 27 24 19 18\n\nProcessing timesFootnote * (in days) of study permits and work permits, October 2021 to July 2023\n\nSource: IRCC\n\nText version: Processing times (in days) of study permits and work permits, October 2021 to July 2023\n\nPermit type Oct 2021 Apr 2022 Oct 2022 May 2023 July 2023 Study permits 106 81 90 46 48 Work permits 107 45 122 57 65\n\nIn addition, Canada continues to be a destination of choice for people all over the world. The number of people wanting to settle permanently in Canada, or wishing to study, visit or work here temporarily, is steadily increasing. The world has also faced unprecedented humanitarian crises due to world events, including the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan, the war in Ukraine, the ongoing conflict in Syria, human rights violations in Iran, and conflict in Sudan. An increase in natural disasters, and events linked to a changing climate, like the earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria, will continue to create displacement and demand Canada’s immigration response.\n\nAs Canada is a country with people from all over the world, there are few global events that do not, in some way, impact Canadians.\n\nPopulation\n\nNumber and % of immigrants in Canada, 1871 to 2041\n\nText version: Number and % of immigrants in Canada, 1871 to 2041\n\nYear Number of immigrants % of immigrants 1871 594,207 16.1% 1881 602,984 13.9% 1891 643,871 13.3% 1901 699,500 13.0% 1911 1,586,961 22.0% 1921 1,955,736 22.3% 1931 2,307,525 22.2% 1941 2,018,847 17.5% 1951 2,059,911 14.7% 1961 2,844,263 15.6% 1971 3,295,530 15.3% 1981 3,843,335 16.0% 1986 3,908,150 15.6% 1991 4,342,890 16.1% 1996 4,971,070 17.4% 2001 5,448,480 18.4% 2006 6,186,950 19.8% 2011 6,775,770 20.6% 2016 7,540,830 21.9% 2021 8,361,505 23.0% 2026 10,712,000 26.0% 2031 (Projected) 12,408,000 28.4% 2036 (Projected) 13,891,000 30.3% 2041 (Projected) 15,155,000 31.8%\n\nSource: Census of Population, 1871 to 2006, 2016 and 2021 (3901); National Household Survey, 2011 (5178); Population projections on immigration and diversity for Canada and its regions, 2016 to 2041 (5126); the presented data are based on the reference scenario.\n\nImmigration will drive 100% of population growth by 2032, while Canadian society continues to age.\n\nSource: Statistics Canada. Table 17-10-0058-01 Components of projected population growth, by projection scenario (x 1,000).\n\nIncreasingly, it is becoming important to spread the benefits of economic immigration to smaller communities. Immigration can support provinces and territories in attracting the skilled newcomers they need to address labour shortages and demographic challenges in their regions. This includes supporting the vitality of Francophone communities outside of Quebec, which is not only a requirement in annual immigration levels planning, but remains an overarching goal of the Government of Canada.\n\nDistribution (%) of recent immigrants in Canada, by census metropolitan area (CMA) and census year\n\nSource: Statistics Canada.
