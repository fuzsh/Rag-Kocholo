DANA COMPANY, Publishers, William Street, Corner Spruce, New York. Published every Saturday morning by WILLIAM B. DANA COMP Y. President and Editor. Jacob Seibert; Business Manager, William D. Rge Treas., William Dana Seibert; Sec., Herbert D.Seibert. Addressee of all, Office of o. The Financial Situation. There are two ways of looking at the credit or $250,000,000 which the Bank of England, according to official announcement of last Saturday, has obtained from the Bank of France and from our Federal Reserve Banking System in equal amounts of $125,000,000 from each. From either standpoint the matter furnishes occasion for regret. In the first place it argues the existence of a situation of great gravity that an occasion should have arisen where London is in need of a credit for such a large amount. The very fact suggests caution, and deep pondering of what it means and what it possibly foreshadows. In the second place it must be regarded as most unfortunate that our Federal Reserve banks should allow themselves to become further involved in a European situation so full of menace. The Reserve banks hold the ultimate cash reserves of the entire banking system of the United States, and it is their duty above everything else to keep these reserves intact. They are not keeping them intact when they invest them in bills concerning the repayment of which at maturity it is known beforehand there is going to be doubt. At present Europe is passing through one of the greatest crises in recorded history, the outcome of which cannot at this time be foretold, and the duty which now rests upon our Federal Reserve authorities is to stand aloof and do nothing which can in the remotest degree serve to impair their security or integrity. By this we mean not that Great Britain, if in need of assistance, should not receive the necessary aid, rather the contrary. We feel, however, that the help should come from private banking sources, which are ample for the purpose, and which can be depended upon to proceed with NO. 3450 the caution and circumspection that such a grave situation demands. There is the more reason for urging such a course, since, in our view, as so repeatedly expressed in these columns, the Reserve officials are acting entirely without authority when they act in the capacity of a central bank, and still more when they undertake to extend a credit of any kind to a foreign bank or a foreign country. They are not endowed with functions of that kind. Nor would we consider it a wise policy that they should be vested with such functions. Their reserves should never, even in a remote degree, be put in jeopardy, and this jeopardy, we feel, cannot be escaped if they allow themselves to be drawn deeper and still deeper into European affairs. The present situation illustrates admirably what is certain to happen when the Federal Reserve proceeds with the idea that it must take a hand in every European trouble that may arise anywhere. The Reserve Bank recently participated to the extent of $25,000,000 in a credit of $100,000,000 to Germany in which it was joint participant with the Bank of England and the Bank of France and the Bank for International Settlements. It is significant that in the present credit of $250,000,000 the Bank for International Settlements is not a participant. The reason is perfectly plain. This Bank for International Settlements has not the resources for such a large undertaking, and the resources it does possess are already to a considerable extent tied up in other similar credits. The B. I. S. is commonly referred to in newspaper dispatches as the World Bank, and it was undoubtedly originally intended to be a world bank in the true sense under some sort of arrangement by which the immense gold holdings of the Federal Reserve banks were to be put at its disposal, but public opinion in the United States would not tolerate anything of the kind, and that part of the scheme had to be abandoned. Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve authorities have long been working in close co-operation with the Bank of England, and the present credit of $125,000,000 is the result. Nor can there be any doubt that they would double this credit if circumstances demanded; and they would go even beyond that figure in case of emergencies such as may arise in connection with the present period of distress. Indeed, judging from past experience, the Reserve officials are prepared to go to any length in putting the vast resources of the Federal Reserve System at the command of the Bank of England, and possibly also the Bank of France, though the latter does not any longer appear to be the dependence and reliance it once was. On that point it is rather significant how popular the idea still is of having the Bank for International Settlements a world bank in the sense originally 842 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE Intended, and as such made the custodian of all the gold in the world. Thus we find one of the London correspondents of the New York \"Times\" saying in his dispatch dated Aug. 1: \"Some bankers, in fact, see to-day's step as a first move toward a permanent solution of the gold problem through the machinery of the Bank for International Settlements, when instead of cumbersome gold transfers, only a debit and credit entry in the books of the World Bank will be needed.\" How nice this would be, and how delighted our Reserve authorities, we imagine, would be! Somehow, however, there are still some practical persons among our citizenry who believe that we will be better off if we retain possession of our own gold instead of transferring it to the custody of those who might find it useful in financing a new war. We have said the present experience illustrates in an admirable way how one step leads to another where the authorities proceed with the notion that it is their bounden duty to come to the assistance of every banking institution that may be in real or assumed need. The $100,000,000 credit for the benefit of Germany was originally simply for a period of three weeks, but even before the three weeks elapsed it became apparent that the credit would have to be extended, and it was then extended for another period of three months, and unquestionably the credit will have to be further extended, and, indeed, that was one of the things that the Seven Power Conference was unanimous in recommending. So this credit has already assumed the aspect of a frozen asset. The same thing has happened, or will happen,in the case of the credit extended to Austria, and the extent of the Federal Reserve's share in this has never been stated. This credit to the Reichsbank has been availed of, too, for we find in the \"Monthly Review\" of the New York Federal Reserve Bank for Aug. 1, in a discussion of the decline in the holdings of acceptances of the 12 Reserve institutions, which holdings fell from $103,341,000 July 1 to only $66,536,000 on July 29, a statement to the effect that \"the decline in holdings of domestic bills alone was even larger than is indicated by the figures for total bill holdings, which include purchases of bills drawn in foreign currency, largely those required in connection with the utilization of the $25,000,000 credit to the Reichsbank announced last month.\" There can be no doubt, either, that the credit for 125,000,000 now extended to the Bank of England will' also be used, and very likely used freely and possibly to its full extent. Reference is made to the fact that when back in 1925 the Bank of England obtained a credit of $300,000,000, of which $100,000,000 was supplied by a syndicate of banks and bankers, headed by J. P. Morgan & Co., and $200,000,000 by the Federal Reserve banks, no portion of the credit was ever used. But there is no analogy between the situation at that time and the situation at the present time. On this former occasion the Bank of England had completed preparations for the return to the gold basis and merely took the credit as additional precaution so as to guard against possible unforeseen contingencies, none of which, fortunately, arose. No menace then threatened. The way had been carefully prepared for the event, and it was simply putting into effect a scheme which had been carried to the stage of perfection. To-day the situation is entirely different. The Bank of England is now in a state of great distress. Large withdrawals of credit, capital and funds are [Vou 133. taking place, accompanied by heavy losses of gold, creating a situation of great disquietude. The Bank is in great need of aid. The long and short of the matter is that the Bank of England is in danger of being undermined, and in view of this menace has been obliged to resort to the large credit now obtained and is likewise bound to resort to the utilization of this credit, since no other alternative is open. Candor compels the statement that for the Bank this struggle involves the question of its soundness and stability. It cannot, therefore, afford to be squeemish about using every facility at its command. Whatever may be the reason, the Bank of England is suffering from the same loss of confidence that has proved so disastrous in the case of the Bank of Germany. Credits and funds are being withdrawn on a huge scale, and no one can say when the end is to be. The menace is infinitly greater than it was in the case of Germany. But London is a world banker. Everyone has money on deposit there and has credit outstanding there, and should panic once seize this multitude the problem might readily become too vast for anyone to handle. Besides, the attitude of the Bank of France is not entirely free from suspicion. Political motives unfortunately appear to be uppermost in France. There appears to be no doubt that French credits and French balances in large amount were withdrawn from Germany nor that similar withdrawals have latterly been taking place from London, whether dictated by political considerations or not. The $125,000,000 of credit now extended by the Bank of France and by French bankers may simply represent credits previously withdrawn, or then again the new credit of $125,000,000 may be followed and attended by the withdrawal of credits still outstanding. The situation is one of great complexity and doubt. In the end the Federal Reserve banks may have to go it alone. The Federal Reserve System, with its large gold holdings, would appear to hold an impregnable position of strength, but may easily become too deeply involved. A credit with a large syndicate of private bankers was infinitely to be preferred, because these bankers would be in close touch with those having large credits outstanding which, through fear, might be withdrawn but which fears might be allayed by assurances from the members of the syndicate. In these circumstances the move of the Federal Reserve Bank in sending Albert H. Wiggin, of the Chase National Bank, to serve as the American representative at the expert conference which is to consider what measures of relief can be adopted for the benefit of Germany is a step in the right direction. Only, it were to be wished, the duties of the committee might be enlarged so as to include consideration of what can be done to strengthen the British situation. Germany is now virtually down and out. The real problem now is how to help London out of its dilemma. Another point is worth considering. The Bank of England, besides obtaining the $250,000,000 credit from the Bank of France and our Federal Reserve System, has received authority from the British Treasury to increase the fiduciary note issue for a period of three weeks in the amount of £15,000,000, or $75,000,000. It is stated that the purpose is to release a corresponding amount of gold. This is rank inflation. It is a thing that Germany has been advised not to do, and while the period during which AIM. 8 1931.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE the notes may remain out is very short, namely, only three weeks,it will be easy to have the time extended. In other words, the note issues, once out, will be difficult to recall. It is a question whether Great Britain would not be a great deal better off if it had less note issues outstanding. The fiduciary currency is the note issues against which no gold reserve need be kept. The amalgamation of the British currency issues added $260,000,000, or $1,300,000,000, roughly, to the note issues of the Bank of England. It has always seemed to us that the addition of such a vast sum to the outstanding issues had served to weaken British control over the gold currency issues added £260,000,000, or $1,300, land had only about £30,000,000 of notes outstanding. To-day with the fiduciary currency included, It has a total of £365,252,000 out. With the note issues so much smaller a rise in the discount rate sufficed to turn the gold currents in favor of London from all parts of the world. Now with the note issues so very much larger it is difficult to make the higher discount rate effective, though it is to be said that the present month the open market rates for bills have been quick to follow the Bank's discount rate upward. In the meantime trade in the United States does not improve. The \"Iron Age,\" which last week found an upturn in steel production from 30% of capacity to 32%, the present week finds production back again to 30% of capacity, and gives expression to the following rather discouraging views: \"A decline in pig iron production to the lowest ebb since 1921, following the disappointing revelations of iron and steel company reports for the second quarter, has dampened reviving hopes for business betterment and accentuated concern over negative market factors in general. \"With half of the country's automobile capacity idle, with the Ensley and Pittsburgh rail mills shut down, and with virtually no branch of the steel industry showing any improvement aside from temporary fluctuations characteristic of a low rate of activity, the outlook for August can hardly be called encouraging. There is the further fact that the rise in steel ingot production of a week ago proved abortive. With declines reported at Youngstown, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Buffalo, the average for the country has receded from 32 to 30% of capacity. \"While too much significance may be attached to the change in operating rate, in view of increasingly frequent irregularities in steel-making schedules in keeping with variations in mill requirements, the industry is not only resigned to another exceedingly dull month but is even more reluctant than heretofore to estimate the scope of seasonal improvement in September. The only favorable development is a firmer attitude on prices, which is a natural reaction from the poor quarterly earnings statements.\" The agricultural situation also furnishes occasion for continued uneasiness, the price of wheat the present week in particular having established another new record for the present century. September wheat in Chicago sold down on Thursday to 47%c. a bushel, with the close yesterday at 5038c., / and middling upland spot cotton in this market on Thursday fell below 8c. a pound, the exact quotation being 7.95c. Dividend reductions and omissions also keep coming along in a fashion to which the country was unaccustomed prior to 1929. Pittsburgh 843 Steel Co. omitted its quarterly dividend of 13 / on 4% the 7% cumulative pref. stock, and the Bucyrus-Erie Co. omitted the quarterly dividend on common and convertible preference shares. The Timken Roller Bearing Co. made its quarterly dividend only 50c. a share as against the previous 75c. a share. The International Nickel Co. of Canada declared a quarterly dividend of only 10c. a share on the common stock as against 15c. a share in each of the two preceding quarters and 25c. a share previously. The Standard Oil Co. of Indiana declared a quarterly dividend of 25c. a share as compared with 50c. a share in each of the two previous quarters and 621 2c. / a share at previous quarters. A. G. Spalding & Bros. declared a quarterly dividend of 25c. a share on the common, compared with 50c. a share paid in previous quarters. Consolidated Gas Utilities omitted the quarterly dividend on class A stock, and Harbison-Walker Refractories reduced its quarterly dividend on common from 50c. a share to 25c. One unexplained feature in the returns of the 12 Federal Reserve banks noted last week is again present this week. We refer to the foreign bank deposits. These last week increased to over $100,000,000, and the precent week have further risen from $100,435,000 to $132,377,000. As stated last week, while no explanation is offered for this expansion in the foreign bank deposits it is understood to be due to the action of the Bank of France in converting its holdings of bankers' acceptances into cash and depositing the proceeds with the Federal Reserve banks. And as confirming this view the bills purchased by the Federal Reserve banks for foreign correspondents last week decreased over $44,000,000 and the present week have further decreased in amount of nearly $28,000,000. Seven weeks ago, on June 17, the foreign bank deposits aggregated no more than $5,676,000, and the increase from that figure to $132,377,000 has been attended by a falling off in the holdings of bills purchased by the Reserve banks for their foreign correspondents from $378,717,000 to $225,852,000 Aug. 5. Aside from this, the Federal Reserve statements this week show no special features beyond moderate increases in the volume of Reserve credit outstanding. The change in the holdings of acceptances, however, may carry a deeper significance than appears by the face of the figures. The amount of these acceptances this week (Aug. 5) is given as $66,074,000 against $66,536,000 last week (July 29). It may be, though, that the holdings of domestic bills have decreased, while the holdings of foreign bills have increased, especially in connection with the large credit extended to the Bank of England. During the month of July this appears to have been frequently the case, as appears from the fact, already noted further above, that the \"Monthly Review\" of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, in explaining the decline in the bill holdings from $103,341,000 on July 1 to $66,536,000 on July 29, takes pains to point out that \"the decline in holdings of domestic bills and loans was even larger than is indicated by the figures for total bill holdings, which include purchases of bills drawn in foreign currencies, largely those acquired in connection with the utilization of the $25,000,000 credit to the Reichsbank that was announced last month.\" The discounts of the 12 Reserve institutions have increased during the week from $183,036,000 to $188,575,000, and the 844 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE holdings of United States Government securities have risen further from $677,977,000 to $680,631,000. This latter figure is over $104,000,000 larger than the holdings of Government securities 12 months ago on Aug.6 1930, when the amount was only $576,224,000. Altogether the total of bill and security holdings the present week stands at $941,582,000 against $934,795,000 last week. The volume of Federal Reserve notes in circulation has further increased during the week, rising from $1,735,501,000 to $1,772,672,000, while at the same time gold reserves have decreased from $3,443,554,000 to $3,429,037,000. Brokers' loans, as given in the compilations of the reporting member banks at New York City, continue their steady record of decline. This week there has been a further decrease of $44,000,000, bringing the total down from $1,390,000,000 to $1,346,000,000, to the lowest figure reached since 1924. At $1,346,000,000 Aug. 5 the present year the comparison is with $3,214,000,000 12 months ago on Aug. 6 1930. In the different categories of loaning, the loans for own account diminished during the week from $1,002,000,000 July 29 to $960,000,000 Aug. 5, while the loans for account of out-of-town banks increased from $219,000,000 to $222,000,000, and loans \"for account of others\" fell from $169,060,000 to $164,000,000. There is little to be said about the stock market the present week. It has been an exceedingly dull affair, with the total of the share transactions less than a million shares a day,on every day of the week. The course of prices has been irregular and unsettled with no pronounced movements in either direction, though the tendency, on the whole, has been towards moderately lower levels. Some half a dozen issues or more, the active specialties of the week, have, however, declined several points during the week. Railroad shares have been weak nearly all the time. There have been no special features or new developments, the absence of trade improvement along with the disturbed financial and economic situation in Europe both acting as depressing agencies. A total of 78 stocks reached new low levels for the year during the week and 14 stocks touched high figures for the year during the week. Call loans on the Stock Exchange again ruled unchanged on every day at 11 2%. / Trading has been exceedingly light. At the halfday session on Saturday the sales on the New York Stock Exchange w6re 398,220 shares; on Monday they were 878,530 shares; on Tuesday, 724,220 shares; on Wednesday,817,890 shares; on Thursday, 909,664 shares, and on Friday, 735,870 shares. On the New York Curb Exchange the sales last Saturday were 67,675 shares; on Monday, 149,585 shares; on Tuesday, 181,870 shares; on Wednesday, 183,725 shares; on Thursday, 226,310 shares, and on Friday, 264,537 shares.

Buying orders were not very extensive, however, and the upward trend was limited to the first part of the session. In the later dealings prices drifted aimlessly, with business extremely slow. The light trading continued Tuesday, and prices in this session reacted slightly. The German situation caused much concern, traders preferring to stand aloof until results of the full bank resumption were determined. Small losses were recorded in the majority of stocks. The upset in sterling exchange produced an unfavorable effect on the Bourse Wednesday, and most stocks again suffered losses. It was noted with astonishment that the Bank of England preferred not to use the credit to support sterling, and the uncertainties thus occasioned caused moderate liquidation. Losses were limited on account of the small volume of trading. With sterling again moving above the gold export point Thursday, prices on the Bourse tended to improve. The impression prevailed that the British central bank had finally begun to use the new credit to support sterling, and stocks strengthened as a result, both French and international issues sharing in the gains. The improvement was maintained yesterday, and some slight further gains were recorded. Dealings in stocks on the important European exchanges proceeded at a snail's pace this week, transactions being kept at a minimum not only by the far-reaching financial crisis but also by the usual August bank holidays in England. The London Stock Exchange began business this week only on Tuesday, the bank holidays occasioning an extension of the normal week-end suspension to include Monday. The Paris Bourse was the only important European market open all week. Trading on the Berlin Boerse was still suspended under emergency decrees of the German Government, and no definite date has yet been set for a resumption of activities. It is suggested in Berlin reports that dealings may be resumed in the latter part of this month or early in September. Movements of quotations on the British and French exchanges this week were exceedingly small, as the financial situation remained much too clouded to stimulate interest in securities. Although Germany made substantial progress toward normal banking conditions, uncertainty continued owing to the need of the Bank of England for huge credits in Formal announcement was made in London, Paris and New York.

Berlin dispatches stated that the German Government had offered to buy 600,000 bales of United States cotton and to take an option on a further 200,000 bales. The offer was said to have stipulated that it was on the basis of a three-year credit. The cost of the cotton, according to the reports, would be computed on a basis of a monthly average of prices on the cotton exchanges in New York, Liverpool and Bremen. The credit would bear interest at 4 %. / 1 2 849 gested. The report states that a budget deficit of £120,000,000 may develop next year unless its recommendations are adopted. The committee was heade d by Sir George May,as Chairman,and other members were Sir Thomas Roydep., Chairman of the Cunard Line; Lord Plender, noted accountant; Sir Mark Jenkinson, P. Ashley Cooper, Arthur Pugh and Charles Latham. In presenting the report to Parliament, Prime Minister MacDonald announced that it would be studied during the recess by a Cabinet committee composed of himself, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Snowden, Foreign Secretary Arthur Henderson, Dominion Secretary J. H. Thomas, and William Graham, President of the Board of Trade. A second Government committee report, dealing with the British coal industry, was made public Monday, and it also attracted much interest. It proposed a far-reaching scheme for \"rationalizing\" the coal mining industry and thus reducing costs. The committee, known as the Coal Miners' Reorganization Commission, was appointed by the Government last year. The plan proposed as a \"basis for discussion\" would divide Britain into six coal areas , each of which would be treated as a unit controlled by a central directorate. It would involve the closing of hundreds of uneconomic mines and possibly throw 100,000 additional miners out of work. Important also, in British affairs, was a disclosure by Chancellor Snowden late last week that a huge war loan conversion scheme prepared by him had been postponed owing to unfavorable financial conditions. The conversion of the £10,000,000 5% war loan has been anticipated for some time, as a very substantial saving in interest can thus be effected. \"Had it not been for recent financial developments, that conversion operation would have been floated before now,\" Mr. Snowden informed the House of Commons. \"I am very anxious, therefore, on that account alone to'see a recovery in the money marke t so that at the very first favorable opportunity the conversion operation may be launched. Its success will go no mean way toward meeting the inevit able need for economy in next year's budget.\" Detai ls of Mr. Snowden's plans were not disclosed. Conversations of one kind or another among the statesmen of leading countries have been a prominent feature of international developments in recent months, and there were indications this week that the practice is not yet waning notwithstanding the apparent lack of beneficial results. Discussions between Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald and Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson were resumed at the latter's hunting lodge in Scotland, Thursday. Mr. Stimson visited Rome, Paris and Berlin on his tour of European capitals. It was plainly stated in dispatches from those capitals that he discussed questions relating to the Geneva disarmament conference of 1932 with the heads of the respective governments. His convensations with the Briti sh Prime Minister will, presumably, tend in the same direction. An official visit to Rome by Chancellor Heinr ich Bruening and Foreign Minister Julius Curti us, of Germany, caused much speculation regarding the subjects likely to be discussed by the Reich Ministers with Premier Benito Mussolini and Foreign Minister Dino Grandi. An official announceme nt in Berlin, before their departure Wednesday night , expressed the hope of the German Government that the two-day visit would be devoted to the same candid exchanges of confidences that marked discussions at Chequers and Paris. The German offici als arrived in Rome early yesterday, and they are scheduled to conclude their discussions to-night. The Berlin press manifested no great enthusiasm regar ding the visit, reports said, as it was assumed that no progress would be made toward settlement of the international financial problems confronting the Reich.

Both the regular tabulations of brokers' loans against stock and bond collateral were made available this week, and the trend in both cases remained downward. The Stock Exchange report for the full month of July showed a decline of $47,232,168. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York statement for the week to Wednesday night reflected a drop of $44,000,000. Gold movements for the week to Wednesday, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank, consisted of imports of $14,605,000. There were no exports, but the stock of the metal held earmarked for foreign account increased $13,700,000, which is equivalent to an export.

At the Port of New York the gold movement for the week ended Aug. 5, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, consisted of imports of $14,605,000, of which $11,000,000 came from Germany, $1,500,000 from England, $1,328,000 from Argentina, $500,000 from Mexico and $277,000 from other Latin American countries. There were no gold exports. The Reserve Bank reported an increase of $13,700,000 in gold earmarked for foreign account. In tabular form the gold movement at the Port of New York, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was as follows: AUG. 8 19311 . FINANCIAL CHRONICLE which was made in cable advices from Berlin on Saturday last. The Reichsbank statement for the week ended July 31 showed an increase in gold holdings of 10,495,000 marks, the total standing at 1,363,298,000 marks, which compares with 2,648,910,000 marks a year ago. French francs fluctuated rather widely during the week, although firm, governed more by transactions in other centres than New York. This week the Bank of France shows an increase in gold holdings of 514,424,540 francs, the total standing at 58,407,489,492 francs on Aug. 1, compared with 46,061,058,118 francs a year ago. Exchanges on Czechoslovakia is one of the inactive units in this market, but interest attaches to it at this time because of the fact that the National Bank of Czechoslovakia has raised its discount rate 1% to 5%. The London check rate on Paris closed at 123.88 on Friday, against 123.90 on Friday of last week. In New York sight bills on the French centre finished at 3.91 7-16, against 3.92 on Friday of last week; cable transfers at 3.91 9-16, against 3.921 8, and / commercial sight bills at 3.91 3-16, against 3.913 . % Antwerp belgas finished at 13.923/ for bankers' sight bills and at 13.93 for cable transfers, against 13.96 and 13.963/2.

Exchange on the countries neutral during the war is governed largely by European events, and transactions on this side have been extremely limited. The Scandinavian currencies, while steady on the whole, have fluctuated more or less in response to changes in rates on sterling. Swiss francs and Holland guilders, as during the past several weeks, have been exceptionally firm, owing largely to withdrawals of Swiss and Dutch funds from other centres. On Wednesday Swiss francs in the New York market were quoted 19.55 for cable transfers, a new record high which compares with parity of 19.30. The extraordinary strength of Swiss francs is reported as due chiefly to the refusal of the Swiss monetary authorities to import gold in face of the huge inflow of funds seeking safety in Switzerland. The gold point against dollars is estimated at 19.44. It is understood in banking circles that the Swiss authorities will not take gold even from the United States, despite the fact that such imports would not disturb the European banking situation as would shipments from London or Berlin. Some traders in New York, it is reported, are maintaining their position in the currency with the expectation that the rate will go as high as 19.60. The enormous inflow of gold into Switzerland recently is revealed in the statement of the National Bank of Switzerland for July 31 showing total gold of 1,164,000,000 gold Swiss francs, against 840,000,000 francs on June 30 and 643,000,000 francs on May 1. At the same time circulation has been increased to 1,255,000,000 francs from 1,078,000,000 francs on June 30 and 990,000,000 francs on May 31. Spanish pesetas are unrelated 853 to the general movement of European exchanges and are affected almost entirely by political events in Spain. In Thursday's trading the peseta broke to 8.49, which is the lowest yet reached since the formation of the republic. This compares with closing quotations on Friday of last week of 9.019.02. International bankers are not satisfied with general conditions in Spain and the outbreak of severe strikes in many quarters. Much apprehension is also felt regarding the possibility of a rift between Spain and Catalonia, and there is little confidence in the ability of the Finance Minister to control the exchange situation. Advices from Paris indicate that the feeling there is that the peseta is nearing another percipitous break. Foreign exchange traders in New York frequently advise against the purchase of pesetas prior to actual need. Bankers' sight on Amsterdam finished on Friday at 40.28%, against 40.293 on Friday of last week; 4 cable transfers at 40.293, against 40.32, and commercial sight bills at 40.26, against 40.24.

Spanish pesetas finished at 8.57 for bankers' sight bills and at 8.58 for cable transfers, against 9.01 and 9.02. Exchange on the South American countries is extremely dull with most of the currencies only nominally quoted and all inclined to sag. Argentine paper pesos have declined again this week and on Wednesday Buenos Aires was quoted 28.38, a new record low. This compares with dollar parity of 42.45. The unsettled political conditions in Argentina are largely responsible for the extremely low quotations for the peso in recent weeks. This week the Federal Reserve Bank reports the receipts of $1,328,000 gold from Argentina.

[VOL. 133. Financial Self-Help in Germany-The Prussian Referendum. The radio address which Chancellor Bruening delivered at Berlin on Tuesday night, on the eve of the reopening of the German banks, was a conservatively optimistic review of Germany's financial situation, and an earnest appeal to the German people to support the Government in the policy of self-help which it is pursuing. Conditions during the past six weeks, the Chancellor admitted, had been chaotic, and because of the danger the Government had been \"compelled to make its decisions without regard to the usual parliamentary procedure,\" and a reassembling of the Reichstag was not yet opportune. The Hoover plan had in its main features become a reality, but the delay of several weeks had \"wrought great harm to the economic and political life of Germany\" through the withdrawal of billions of marks of foreign credits and severe disturbances in \"internal money exchanges.\" Nevertheless, the efforts of the Government to reach an understanding with France and other Powers had continued, the domestic banking situation had been saved by Government intervention with the aid of the Reichsbank, and only the savings banks, whose funds were invested in longterm mortgages, must for a time remain under reFOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CERTIFIED BY FEDERAL RESERVE strictions. \"There is no danger of inflation of any TREASURY UNDER TARIFF ACT OF 1922, BANKS TO AUG. 1 1931 TO AUG. 7 1931, INCLUSIVE. kind,\" the Chancellor asserted, and \"we have no Noon Buying Ratefor Cable Transfers in New York. excess of bank notes in circulation.\" The opinion Value in United States Money.

An emergency decree issued on Wednesday authorized the savings banks to issue drafts if they could not obtain credits, but at the same time forbade the further grant of loans to municipalities. To prevent embarrassment to the municipalities a temporary government loan is to be provided, but allotments are apparently to be made only in connection with a reorganization of municipal finances which the Government proposes to undertake. A statement given out on Wednesday by Dr. Herznann Dietrich, Vice-Chancellor and Finance Minister, indicated substantial progress in financial retrenchment. According to the Associated Press, Dr. Dietrich claimed that \"every criticism of extravagance in the German Federal Budget\" that had been made by S. Parker Gilbert when he was Agent-General for Reparations Payments had been met. \"We have cut the budget to the bone,\" he was quoted as saying. The budget for 1931 shows a saving of 1,542,000,000 marks compared with 1930, not including the savings made possible by the Hoover moratorium. Expenditures for Federal salaries and wages \"have been brought down to the level of 1926,\" any further reductions being inadvisable because of the curtailment of purchasing power which it would involve and the encouragement that it would give to Communist agitation. The share of Federal taxes turned over to the States of the Reich has also been reduced, the amount for 1931 being 810,000,000 marks less than for 1930. The drastic restrictions upon German foreign trade, consequent upon the stringent control of foreign exchange which became effective on Tuesday, are apparently to be viewed as emergency measures for a short time only, since they could not very well continue without seriously complicating both the trade and exchange situation. The texts of the decree and explanatory instructions have not yet been published in this country, but Berlin dispatches report that exchange will be furnished freely only for certain specially important imports, among them raw materials for German factories, and for service charges o"
