        "text": "Long‐term high‐frequency air temperature time series, typically considered the most authoritative observed records for the detection of climate changes, appear physically heterogeneous by nature. We examine multiple Canadian air temperature records for the presence of physical heterogeneities, using the analysis of their diurnal temperature patterns as the main criterion for the separation of temperature series into ‘homogeneous’ populations. Based on the key differences observed in their diurnal air temperature patterns, two distinct populations of the air temperature sample are identified and assumed to be the result of different heat exchange mechanisms. The Linear Pattern Discrimination (LPD) algorithm, implemented in the R‐code, is introduced in this work and applied to 66‐year long hourly temperature records of 25 Canadian stations for the separation of the radiative temperature population from the advective temperature population and examination of incidences of specific, advective cases in air temperature data. The LPD analysis reveals a predominance of a remarkably warmer, radiatively driven air temperature regime. In contrast, the significantly colder and geographically controlled advective temperature regime plays a counterbalancing role on the overall magnitude of the midlatitude air temperature signal. Our findings suggest that a substantial temperature increase in annual averages of advective minima amplifies the effect of a positively shifted radiative temperature range, intensifying the overall heating observed in the Canadian North and northwestern regions.\n\nWe address the following question: Are turning points of daily air temperature function a piece of relevant climatological information worth recording and analyzing? Diurnal Extrema Timing (DET) are daily occurrence times of air temperature minimum and maximum. Although unrecognized and unrecorded as a meteorological variable, the exact timing of daily temperature extrema plays a crucial role in the characterization of air temperature variability. In this study, we introduce the DET concept and assess the plausibility of this potential parameter in detecting temperature extrema timing changes. Conceptualization of the DET parameter has, for a primary goal, the supplementation of vital spatial information to the daily measurements of air temperature extrema. The elementary analysis of annual trends of daily DET examines the significance of this parameter in describing changes in the time domain of air temperature variability. The introduction of the new Climate Parameter Sensitivity Index (CPSI) for evaluating the susceptibility of climate parameters to climate change directs attention to the importance of the systematic acquisition of the timing of daily extrema in climate observations. The results of this study reveal the timing of daily air temperature maximum as the most vulnerable to climate change among temperature and timing extrema indices.\n\nThe suggested methodology for the characterization of temperature extrema presents a multistep preprocessing procedure intended to derive extrema time series of correctly identified and thermally defined daily air temperature extrema pairs. The underlying conceptual framework for this approach was developed in response to the existing gaps in the current state of daily extrema identification and the development of extrema-based synthetic air temperature time series. A code consisting of a series of algorithms was developed to establish four-parameter criteria for a more accurate representation of daily variability that allows easy replication of temperature distribution based on the correct characterization of daily temperature patterns. The first preprocessing step consists of subjecting the high-frequency temperature time series to a theoretical diurnal observing window that imposes latitudinally and seasonally crafted limits for the individual identification of daily minima and maxima. The following pre-processing step involves the supplementation of air temperature extrema with the information on the occurrence of extrema timing deemed as vital information for the reconstruction of the temperature time series. The subsequent step involves the application of an innovative temperature pattern recognition algorithm that identifies physically homogeneous air temperature populations based on the information obtained in previous steps. The last step involves the use of a metric for the assessment of extrema temperature and timing parameters’ susceptibility to climate change. The application of the presented procedure to high-frequency temperature data yields two strains of physically homogeneous extrema time series with the preserved characteristics of the overall temperature variability. In the present form, individual elements of this methodology are applicable for correcting historical sampling and air temperature averaging biases, improving the reproducibility of daily air temperature variation, and enhancing the performance of temperature index formulae based on daily temperature extrema. The objective of this analysis is the eventual implementation of the presented methodology into the practice of systematic temperature extrema identification and preprocessing of temperature time series for the configuration of physically homogeneous air temperature subpopulations.\n\nThis study examines the relationship between the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) data and the radiative population of Surface Air Temperature (SAT) from long-term hourly Canadian records. Solar irradiance function was generated by using an accurate Sun output model, Earth orbital position, and a clear-sky, homogeneous spherical-shell model of the atmosphere. The SAT time series were preprocessed using a multistep procedure based on the Climatological Observing Window (COWND) method and Linear Pattern Discrimination (LPD) algorithm. As a result, the total population of all temperature records was divided into radiative and advective extrema time series. A strong positive correlation between the radiative population of SAT and clear sky solar irradiance was identified thus validating the concept of radiative days and successful performance of the LPD algorithm.\n\nClimatological observing window (COW) is defined as a time frame over which continuous or extreme air temperature measurements are collected. A 24-h time interval, ending at 00UTC or shifted to end at 06UTC, has been associated with difficulties in characterizing daily temperature extrema. A fixed 24-h COW used to obtain the temperature minima leads to potential misidentification due to fragmentation of “nighttime” into two subsequent nighttime periods due to the time discretization interval. The correct identification of air temperature extrema is achievable using a COW that identifies daily minimum over a single nighttime period and maximum over a single daytime period, as determined by sunrise and sunset. Due to a common absence of hourly air temperature observations, the accuracy of the mean temperature estimation is dependent on the accuracy of determination of diurnal air temperature extrema. Qualitative and quantitative criteria were used to examine the impact of the COW on detecting daily air temperature extrema. The timing of the 24-h observing window occasionally affects the determination of daily extrema through a mischaracterization of the diurnal minima and by extension can lead to errors in determining daily mean temperature. Hourly air temperature data for the time period from year 1987 to 2014, obtained from Toronto Buttonville Municipal Airport weather station, were used in analysis of COW impacts on detection of daily temperature extrema and calculation of annual temperature averages based on such extrema."
