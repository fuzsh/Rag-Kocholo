        "text": "The bitter cold spell that has settled over most of Saskatchewan in the past few days broke records around the province.\n\nRecord-breaking or tying temperatures for Dec.5, 6 or 7 were reached in 13 of the province's regions, according to Environment Canada.\n\nThe Key Lake area in northern Saskatchewan led the way, with temperatures plummeting to a record-tying low of -40.5 C overnight on Dec. 5. The area also established a record for lowest daytime high at -29.7 C\n\nOn Dec. 6, the temperature dropped to -34.2 C in Lloydminster, breaking a record set in 2013.\n\nOn Dec. 7, several Saskatchewan cities saw historic overnight lows. Moose Jaw and Yorkton both reached -34 C, breaking records set in 1972.\n\nTemperatures in Weyburn plunged to -39.6 C that night, easily eclipsing the previous record of -33.3 C set in 1953.\n\nIt felt even colder\n\nThe record-breaking temperatures don't include windchill.\n\nEnvironment Canada issued extreme cold warnings for most of the province. In southern Saskatchewan, that means the temperature or wind chill must reach -40 C for at least two hours before a warning is issued. That number drops to -45 C in northern Saskatchewan.\n\nEnvironment Canada meteorologist Terri Lang says the recent deep freeze is the coldest weather Saskatchewan has seen this season.\n\nShe blames the extreme cold on a patch of Arctic air parking itself over Saskatchewan accompanied by strong winds.\n\n\"The really cold air combined with the winds are creating quite a wind chill,\" Lang told CBC News on Wednesday."
