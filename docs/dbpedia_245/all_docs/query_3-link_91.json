        "text": "Florida PhosphatesSee Florida Phosphates Individual Property Disclosure below.\n\nPeru - Compañía Minera Miski Mayo S.R.L. (“Miski Mayo”)\n\nLocationSechura Province in the Piura Region, PeruType and amount of ownership interests\n\n75% owned by Compañía Minera Miski Mayo S.R.L., a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Mosaic.\n\nTitles, mineral rights, leases or options and acreageMiski Mayo is the holder of 20 non-metallics mining concessions (76,000 hectares).Key permit conditions\n\nPermit conditions are dictated by operating licenses, which are maintained and renewed on a regular basis. As of December 31, 2022, all environmental licenses were either still valid or were being renewed pursuant to applications with the Peruvian Environmental Agency within the legal deadlines.\n\nIn general, environmental commitments are being met; however, there are environmental requirements and commitments related to the expansion of Miski Mayo Line 3 of the Second Amendment of the EIA (2015) that have to be verified and implemented.\n\nMiski Mayo’s environmental controls are related to monitoring the quality of wastewater, surface water, groundwater and air, as well as waste management. Additional environmental controls are in place for air emissions, air quality and noise.\n\nTailings storage facilities and other impoundment’s stability are monitored through specified routine internal and third party inspections.\n\nMine types and mineralization styles\n\nMiski Mayo is a surface mine. The phosphate deposits of Peru are located within the shallow north-trending Sechura Basin, in the Piura region, hosting successive inter-layered marine sediments of phosphate. We extract phosphate ore from Miski Mayo using excavators. The ore is then transported by truck for beneficiation in a plant that we own. The beneficiated concentrate is then shipped to North America for use in our own production or sold to third parties.\n\nProcessing plants and other facilitiesBeneficiation plant\n\nTitles, mineral rights, leases or options and acreage\n\nWe lease approximately 118,378 acres of mineral rights for the Colonsay Facility from the Province of Saskatchewan (the “Crown”) under Subsurface Mineral Lease KL 108. The lease term is for a period of 21 years, with renewals at our option for additional 21-year lease periods.\n\nIn addition, we own or lease approximately 14,451 acres of mineral rights within the Colonsay area. All mineral properties owned or leased by Mosaic are for the “subsurface mineral” commodity as defined in The Subsurface Mineral Tenure Regulations (Saskatchewan).\n\nWe own approximately 5,972 acres of surface rights in the Colonsay area. All infrastructure including the processing plant and tailings management areas ( “TMAs” or “TMA”) are located on our owned land.\n\nKey permit conditionsA water rights license issued by the Saskatchewan Water Security Agency is in place and expires in 2032. The license is associated with the allocation of surface water rights for the site. An Approval to Operate Pollutant Control Facilities, issued by the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment, is also in place and expires in July 2028. It is expected to be renewed at or before expiration.\n\nThere are no other significant encumbrances, including permitting requirements (existing or anticipated in the future) associated with the Colonsay Facility. Except for the royalties, we do not anticipate any future significant encumbrances based on current known regulations and existing permitting processes. There are no outstanding violations and fines.Mine types and mineralization styles\n\nThe intracratonic Elk Point Basin is a major sedimentary geological feature in western Canada and the northwest U.S. It contains one of the world’s largest stratabound potash resources that represents almost 25% of the global potash production. The Prairie Evaporite hosts rich deposits of evaporite minerals including NaCl, KCl and locally, carnallite that occur in three potash deposits: the Esterhazy, Belle Plaine and Patience Lake members.\n\nThe Colonsay deposit includes two potash-bearing members within its local stratigraphy; the Patience Lake Member and the Belle Plaine Member. Mining at Colonsay is conducted within the upper portion of the Patience Lake Member using a room and pillar mining method.\n\nThe Colonsay Facility uses an underground room and pillar mining method to extract potash. After being transported along a network of conveyor systems to the shaft, it is hoisted to the surface for onsite processing.\n\nProcessing plants and other facilitiesMill facility, beneficiation plant\n\nCarlsbad Potash Facility (“Carlsbad Facility”)\n\nLocationNew Mexico, U.S.Type and amount of ownership interests100% owned by Mosaic Potash Carlsbad Inc., a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of Mosaic.Titles, mineral rights, leases or options and acreage\n\nThe property consists of 89% federally owned and 11% state owned land, and 40 acres of privately owned mineral rights that Mosaic leases. We lease approximately 64,267 acres of mineral rights from the U.S. Department of Interior Bureau of Land Management (the “BLM”). These lease terms are for a period of 20 years and are reviewed and renewed at their end of term.\n\nSurface rights are subject to separate ownership and title from subsurface mineral rights.\n\nWe own 8,370 acres of surface rights. All infrastructure, including the processing plant, TMA, cluster sites, and pipeline rights of way, are located on Mosaic-owned land.\n\nKey permit conditions\n\nPrimary environmental resource areas identified include groundwater quality and shorebird habitat. Environmental monitoring for effluents, air and surface/groundwater is in place.\n\nCurrently, 11 permits or approvals are active for the property. We are in compliance with all such permits or approvals. One of the 11, groundwater discharge permit (DP-1399) issued by the New Mexico Environmental Department (“NMED”), is currently being renewed. The discharge permit governs operation of the TMA. A tailings management and inspection plan is in place and active. The permit includes closure and post-closure requirements and financial assurance requirements.\n\nA mining and reclamation plan has been developed and approved by the BLM. This plan includes standards for operation and closure of the mine that comply with federal and state of New Mexico environmental regulations. Current and final mine closure plans and reclamation cost estimates are completed and the closure plans have been approved by NMED and the BLM.\n\nThere are no significant environmental permitting encumbrances (existing or anticipated in the future) associated with the Carlsbad Facility. We do not anticipate any future encumbrances based on current known regulations and existing permitting processes. There are no outstanding violations and fines.\n\nMine types and mineralization styles\n\nThe Carlsbad potash district is located within the northern New Mexico portion of the Delaware Basin. The Delaware Basin is the western subdivision of the greater Permian Basin, one of the deepest intracratonic basins in North America.\n\nPotash mineralization at Carlsbad occurs in the Ochoan Epoch (Upper Permian Age) Salado Formation. The Salado Formation, up to a maximum of 2,200 feet (671 m) ft. thick, is an evaporite sequence dominated by 650 to 1,300 feet (198 to 396 m) of halite and muddy halite. It hosts 12 ore zones, 11 in the middle or McNutt Member and the 12th in the Upper Member. The area underlain by the 12 ore zones is about 1,900 sq. miles (4,920 sq. km). The 400 foot (122 m) thick McNutt Member is at a depth of 300 to 1,500 feet (91 to 457 m) below the surface.\n\nThe Carlsbad Facility utilizes an underground room-and-pillar mining method.\n\nPillars are cut in a manner that creates a panel; panel sizes can be changed based on grade, ground conditions and lease or oil and gas boundaries. The mine currently has five mine panels that consist of nine to 11 rooms. Drum-style continuous miners are utilized for mining. As the continuous miner advances, ore is fed off a boom located at the back of the miner into battery-powered ore haulage units. These units transport the ore through the open mine workings and dump it onto an extensive belt system that conveys the ore to the surface for milling.\n\nProcessing plants and other facilities\n\nLangbeinite (K-Mag®) refinery and a granulation plant\n\nKey permit conditions\n\nMosaic currently holds a total of four mining permits within the Araxá area (2,769 hectares) and four mining permits and one exploration permit within the Patrocínio area (3,478 hectares). Permit conditions are dictated by operating licenses, which are maintained and renewed on a regular basis. As of December 31, 2022, all environmental licenses were valid or were being renewed pursuant to applications filed with the Brazilian Environmental Agency.\n\nThere are action plans in progress to comply with the environmental conditions of the permits that are not met yet within the applicable regulations. Araxá and Patrocínio’s environmental controls are related to monitoring the quality of wastewater, surface water, groundwater and air, as well as waste management. Additional environmental controls are in place for air emissions, air quality and noise.\n\nTailings storage facilities and other impoundment’s stability are monitored through a continuous monitoring program, as well as routine inspections.\n\nMine types and mineralization styles\n\nThe Araxá and Patrocínio phosphate deposits are part of a series of Late-Cretaceous, carbonatite-bearing alkaline ultramafic plutonic complexes belong to the Alto Paranaiba Igneous Province.\n\nThe tropical weather regime prevailing in the region and the inward drainage patterns developed from the weather-resistant quartzite margins of the dome structures resulted in the development of an extremely thick soil cover in most of the complexes. The extreme weathering was responsible for the residual concentration of apatite.\n\nThe phosphate ore is extracted through surface mining by limited drilling and blasting, loaded into trucks and transported to the beneficiation plants. Patrocinio does not have its own beneficiation plant, so the ore is transported by rail to Araxá for processing.\n\nProcessing plants and other facilities\n\nTwo beneficiation plants at Araxá\n\nComplexo Mineroquímico de Cajati (“Cajati”)\n\nLocationNear Cajati, São Paulo, Brazil Type and amount of ownership interests100% owned by Mosaic Fertilizantes P&K S.A., a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Mosaic.Titles, mineral rights, leases or options and acreageMining rights in Brazil are governed by the Mining Code, Decree 227, dated February 27, 1967, and further regulation enacted by the ANM.
