        "text": "Weekly Provincial Summary\n\nAgro-Manitoba received variable amounts of precipitation over the past seven days. Once again, isolated\n\nheavy rains occurred in several regions. Precipitation for the past week ranged from 0 mm to 51.3 mm\n\n(Table 1). Sprague (51.3 mm) received the most precipitation.\n\nTable 1. Range of seven-day accumulated precipitation (July 22 – 28) in Manitoba’s Agricultural Regions.\n\nRegion Wettest Location Driest Location\n\nCentral Altona (23.8 mm) Several (0.0 mm)\n\nEastern Sprague (51.3 mm) Pinawa (0.2 mm)\n\nInterlake Moosehorn (17.6 mm) Several (0.0 mm)\n\nNorthwest Reedy Creek (44.5 mm) Several (0.0 mm)\n\nSouthwest Bede (6.7mm) Several (0.0 mm)\n\nClimate normals for total accumulated precipitation from May 1 to July 28 range from 160.9 mm to 249.5\n\nmm and are based on 30-year historical data. Precipitation accumulation in most areas have exceeded\n\n110% of normal precipitation since May 1.\n\nSoil Moisture 0 – 30 cm shows a regional representation of soil moisture conditions at the top 30 cm on\n\nJuly 28, 2024, relative to field capacity. The majority of agro-Manitoba is showing optimal or wet soil\n\nmoisture conditions at the surface depths.\n\nPercent Normal Accumulated Growing Degree Days represents the variation of accumulated Growing\n\nDegree Days (GDD) from the historical record over a 30-year period from May 1 – July 28, 2024. Warmer\n\ntemperatures this week increased GDD accumulation. GDD Accumulation is between 95% and 110% of\n\nnormal for the majority of Agro-Manitoba.\n\nFall rye and winter wheat are drying down with fields between hard dough and physiological maturity. The earliest\n\nfall rye fields will likely be harvested this week. Most corn fields are between V10 to silking. Many corn fields\n\nremain uneven although the problem has improved with the warm weather in the last few weeks. Continued warm\n\ntemperatures are needed to further even out the crop. Spring wheat ranged from the soft dough to hard dough\n\ngrowth stages with awns starting to turn colour. The earliest seeded canola crops were well into pod filling with\n\nflower drop complete. Increased flower blast due to the very warm temperatures continued to be noted by both\n\nproducers and agronomists. Sunflower growth progressed rapidly in the warm conditions with stands ranging from\n\nR3 (bud elongation) to R5.1 (10% flowering) with most plants being at the R4 (inflorescence opening) growth\n\nstage. Soybeans are in the R2 (full bloom) to R3 (beginning pod) stage with the most advanced fields now at full\n\npod (R4).\n\nCereals\n\nFall rye and winter wheat are drying down with fields between hard dough and physiological maturity. The\n\nearliest fall rye fields will likely be harvested this week.\n\nMost corn fields are between V10 to silking.\n\nSpring wheat ranged from the soft dough to hard dough growth stages with awns starting to turn colour.\n\nEarly seeded barley was in soft dough while early seeded oats fields ranged from soft to hard dough.\n\nNo change in spring wheat quality from the previous week. Spring wheat quality is rated mostly fair to\n\ngood with 5 to 10% of the crop being reported as poor in the Southwest, Northwest, Central, and Interlake\n\nregions\n\nOilseeds\n\nThe earliest seeded canola crops were well into pod filling with flower drop complete. The last fields\n\nseeded were at full flower and having fungicide applied to them.\n\nSunflower growth progressed rapidly in the warm conditions with stands ranging the R3 (bud elongation)\n\nto R5.1 (10% flowering) with most plants being at the R4 (inflorescence opening) growth stage. There\n\ncontinues to be a lot of developmental variation across fields due to varied planting dates and within fields\n\ndue to past water stressed conditions.\n\nMost flax fields were at growth stage 9 (late flowering with most capsules formed) to growth stage 10\n\n(white seeds in capsules and lower leaves starting to yellow). Overall crop condition was rated as good\n\naside from flooded and saturated field areas.\n\nPulses and Soybeans\n\nField peas are in the R4 to R5 stage. For the most part, fields are looking good, however there are fields\n\naffected by the excess moisture and doing poorly, most notably in the Eastern region.\n\nSoybeans are in the R2 to R3 stage with the most advanced fields now at full pod (R4) and have seen\n\nrapid growth of the last week due to the hot humid conditions.\n\nIron deficiency chlorosis can still be found in fields, but most fields have recovered.\n\nForages & Livestock\n\nForages\n\nGood progress has been made on first cut beef hay as fields were wrapped up, as humidity levels finally\n\ndropped late last week. Reports of hay laying for over a week as high humidity prevented curing of hay\n\nswaths. The high humidity and heavy morning dew has made it difficult for hay to dry, which will lower\n\nquality. Some swaths have been flipped multiple times to improve drying. As a result, more producers\n\nhave opted to use grass intended for hay as bale silage.\n\nHay yields are being reported in the 2.5-3 tonnes per acre on tame hay stands. Moisture conditions in low\n\nlying areas are improving, making fields more accessible with haying equipment. Growth on hayfields is\n\ngood, however forage stands that have not yet been cut due to excess moisture are quite mature and\n\nquality may be an issue.\n\nDairy farms have taken their first cut of alfalfa silage, most have taken a second cut. 1st cut of tame hay for\n\nbeef farms is almost finished.\n\nEarly seeded silage crops likely will be harvested this week. Corn silage fields are further advancing as a\n\nresult of high temperatures\n\nLivestock\n\nThe warm weather this week combined with soil moisture has allowed for strong growth in pastures and of\n\nforage crops. Cattle are making the most of strong growth due to the moist soil conditions. Some areas\n\nhave become damaged from hoof action on waterlogged soils. Producers are attempting to control fly\n\nnumbers on pasture and are looking for pink eye and foot rot where conditions remain wet underfoot.\n\nPairs are looking good with ample grass to graze, and bulls have been placed with cows. Herds are\n\nclumping together, indicating that flies are bothering them, so they should be rotated to new areas.\n\nDugouts are 85% full.\n\nRegional Comments\n\nNorthwest\n\nHot and humid conditions persisted most of the week and continued to advance crops in the region. Highest\n\ntemperature was 31.4°C at the Drifting River station and lowest overnight temperatures was 8.7°C at San Clara\n\nstation. Most of the region received little to no precipitation, with the except of Reedy Creek station which received\n\n44 mm.\n\nWinter wheat and fall rye crops are mostly in soft dough stage and looking good in most areas not affected by\n\nexcess moisture. Most advanced spring wheat are in late milk to soft dough and late crops are in flowering stage.\n\nSome fields that were previously stressed due to excess moisture have recovered.\n\nMost advanced canola crops are nearing the end of flowering and are at the pod filling stage. Crops are more\n\nadvanced in Swan River/Roblin and behind in the Dauphin area due to excess moisture in spring. Fungicide\n\napplications have mostly been wrapped up, with the exception of late seeded crops requiring it. Recent high\n\ntemperatures have caused some pod abortion due to heat stress.\n\nEarliest field peas are nearing the R5 stage and the remainder of crop in R3-R4. Soybean crops are in the R2\n\nstage and mostly looking good. Recent heat has helped and advanced the crops quickly. There are crops in the\n\nDauphin area that were stressed from excess moisture and are in the R1 stage.\n\n(Manitoba Agriculture News Release)"
