        "text": "During June–November 2012, pronounced differences in tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies were observed between three widely used SST products: the extended reconstructed SST version 3b (ERSSTv3b), and the optimum interpolation SST version 2 analyses (OISST), produced weekly (OISSTwk) and daily (OISSTdy). During June–August 2012, the Niño-3.4 SST anomaly (SSTA) index was 0.2°–0.3°C lower in ERSSTv3b than in OISSTwk and OISSTdy, while it was 0.3°–0.4°C higher from September to November 2012. Such differences in the Niño-3.4 SSTA index can impact the assessment of the status of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, which is determined using a threshold of ±0.5°C in the Niño-3.4 SSTA index.To investigate the reasons for the differences between ERSSTv3b and OISSTdy/OISSTwk, an experimental analysis (called ERSSTsat) is created that is similar to ERSSTv3b but includes satellite-derived SSTs. However, significant differences in the Niño-3.4 SSTA index remained between ERSS...\n\nChanges in ocean heat content (OHC), salinity, and stratification provide critical indicators for changes in Earth’s energy and water cycles. These cycles have been profoundly altered due to the emission of greenhouse gasses and other anthropogenic substances by human activities, driving pervasive changes in Earth’s climate system. In 2022, the world’s oceans, as given by OHC, were again the hottest in the historical record and exceeded the previous 2021 record maximum. According to IAP/CAS data, the 0–2000 m OHC in 2022 exceeded that of 2021 by 10.9 ± 8.3 ZJ (1 Zetta Joules = 1021 Joules); and according to NCEI/NOAA data, by 9.1 ± 8.7 ZJ. Among seven regions, four basins (the North Pacific, North Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea, and southern oceans) recorded their highest OHC since the 1950s. The salinity-contrast index, a quantification of the “salty gets saltier—fresh gets fresher” pattern, also reached its highest level on record in 2022, implying continued amplification of the ..."
