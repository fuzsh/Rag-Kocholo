        "text": "Di P. Gosselin – 21 febbraio 2018\n\nLe previsioni a lungo termine per l’Europa, dove si trova in una situazione già più fredda del normale, mostrano temperature che scenderanno di quasi -20 °C in molte zone dell’Europa centrale all’inizio della prossima settimana, estendendo così quello che risulta già essere un inverno “brutale”.\n\nL’ultima corsa del modello GFS preve un freddo brutale che deve affrontare\n\nl’Europa all’inizio della prossima settimana. Fonte: Dominik Jung.\n\nGli europei che desiderano la primavera dovranno semplicemente avere pazienza ancora per un po’. In effetti quest’inverno è stato duro in tutto l’emisfero settentrionale, con temperature record dalla Siberia al Nord America al Giappone. Anche molti luoghi hanno visto nevicate record.\n\nLe Alpi europee hanno avuto uno degli inverni più nevosi, con la neve che continua ad accumularsi fino a diversi metri di altezza.\n\nLa lunga lista di eventi invernali severi\n\nNaturalmente alcuni warmists diranno che il freddo e la neve che si verificano localmente non hanno molto significato. Eppure, quest’inverno le dure condizioni sono state diffuse in tutto il nostro emisfero e in tutto il mondo, certo non è quello che ci si aspetterebbe dal “riscaldamento globale”.\n\nIl lettore Tom Mason ha pubblicato un commento in bacheca, quindi ho deciso di farne un post. Nel suo commento Tom Mason elenca alcune delle fredde temperature e nevicate record che si sono verificate finora. E ora che si prevede un forte raffreddamento per l’Europa occidentale, la lista qui sotto si allungherà notevolmente.\n\nTom scrive che quanto segue è un elenco ridotto che inizia solo dal 1° novembre 2017 (mi piacerebbe vedere la lunghezza della versione integrale).\n\nCanada\n\nNovembre: fino a 16 pollici di neve per il SW di Alberta Rocky Mountain. Da fine novembre fino a 40 cm (16 pollici) di neve sono caduti in alcune zone.\n\nIl 3 novembre Record Low Temperature – Più di un piede di neve in alcune aree:\n\nPuntzi Mountain, B.C .: -22.4C (-8.3 F) frantuma il vecchio record di -18.7C (-1.7 F) stabilito nel 2003)\n\nWilliams Lake, B.C .: -15.4C (4.3 F) frantuma il vecchio record di -10.0C (14.0 F) del 1973)\n\n3-6 novembre\n\nBritish Columbia\n\nMolti record di freddo battuti dal 1914\n\nRiassunto del tempo da Environment Canada, 3 novembre 2017.
