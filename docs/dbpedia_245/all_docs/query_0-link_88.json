        "text": "After a day off, the Bombers hit Weyburn tonight looking to snap a 2 game winless streak, after they looked poised to get wins in both Nipawin and Estevan to start the trip.\n\nThe Bombers led Nipawin 4-3 on Tuesday with just over 5 minutes left in regulation, only to see the Hawks tie the game and pick up the win in a shoot out. It looked like Flin Flon would blow Estevan out on Wednesday, grabbing a quick 3-0 lead after 1, but let that lead slip away and ended up dropping the game in OT 5-4.\n\nToday is a new day with a new opponent, the upstart Weyburn Red Wings who are battling for the Viterra Division title, enter the game tonight, 2 points behind Melville. The Mills do have a game in hand.\n\nIf you take away the head to head matches with Estevan, the Wings have been able to pick up wins over pretty much the rest of their opponents in 2015. The Wings are winless against the Bruins in 2015 with a pair of losses and a shoot out loss.\n\nThis will be the fourth and final meeting of the season with the Bombers picking up 5 out of a possible 6 points in the 3 previous meetings, with 2 of the 3 games needing over- time.\n\nThe last meeting in Weyburn back on October the 17th, the Bombers blew a 3-1 lead and ended up losing in the shoot out 4-3.\n\nThis will be a battle between two of the league's best power play units. The Bombers are ranked no.1 at 22.4%, and the Wings are ranked second at 20.6 %.\n\nFlin Flon finds themselves just 1 point behind Nipawin for second in the Sherwood Division with a game in hand on the Hawks, and continue to battle Notre Dame for 5th overall. The Bombers lead the Hounds by 2 points and both teams have played 43 games.\n\nThe two hottest Bombers heading into Weyburn tonight, are Brett Boehm who has 15 points in his last 10 games, and captain Dean Allison who has 10 points in his last 7 games.\n\nBoth these players will need to be good again tonight with contributions needed from Chris Rauckman who has failed to score on the road trip so far ,and Alex Smith who hasn't scored in his last 7 games. Smith is still in the top 10 league scorers sitting 9th overall with 41 points.\n\nTyler Bell continues to impress on the back end and has been able to chip in offensively besides adding a strong physical presence. Bell has scored in both games on the road trip and has 15 points on the season including 7 power play goals.\n\nNo matter what go's down you will have the best seat in the house with all the action on 102.9 CFAR and flinflononline.com starting with the Murray GM Coach's Show at 7:15.\n\nSteven Wilson will have tonight's call from Crescent Point Place.\n\nThe Flin Flon Bombers scored 3 times in the first period and appeared to have the Estevan Bruins on the ropes last night at Affinity Place.\n\nBoehm, Evans and Bell all scored in the opening period and Flin Flon appeared to be on their way to their 24th victory of the season.\n\nLongpre scored for the Bruins early in the second period, to get Estevan on the board at 3-1. Michael Knaub came back with his 6th of the season to restore the 3 goal lead for the Bombers and put his team up 4-1.\n\nThe turning point of the night for me was when Longpre would get his second of the night, deflecting a shot past Simon Hofley to get the Bruins within 2 after 2.\n\nThis goal motivated the Bruins, coming out for the third and they continued to chip away at the lead making it a 1 goal game, when Pastachak buried his 11th at the 14:13 mark.\n\nThe Bruins would get the equalizer only 21 seconds later when Keegan Allison would get his team leading 17th of the season.\n\nThat would set the stage for over time for the Bombers for a second straight night, and once again found themselves short handed to start the extra frame.\n\nIt took Allison just 31 seconds to make the Bombers pay when he scored his second of the game and 18th of the year as the Bruins came back to shock the Bombers 5-4 in OT.\n\nThe League's best power play could not take advantage of the league's worst penalty killing unit as Flin Flon went 0 for 3 with the extra attacker, while Estevan finished up 2 for 6 including the game winner.\n\nThis one really had to sting as Flin Flon were by far the better team, but somehow managed to let this one slip through their fingers. I don't think any one was expecting the Bombers to cough up a 3 goal lead.\n\nThe Bomber record on this road trip will fall to 0-0-1-1, and really should be 2-0 as they did outplay Nipawin on Tuesday as well, but you don't always win despite being the better team.\n\nFlin Flon will get a day off before resuming the road trip tomorrow in Weyburn with all the action on 102.9 CFAR and flinflononline.com, starting with the Murray GM Coach's Show at 7:15.\n\nWith the 1 point the Bombers received last night with the OT loss, they remain 1 point behind Nipawin for second in the Sherwood Division with a game in hand and sit 5th overall, 2 points up on Notre Dame.\n\nThe Flin Flon Bombers rebounded nicely after a pair of tough losses in Kindersley the previous weekend by out scoring the Yorkton Terriers over the weekend at the Whitney Forum 15-6.\n\nAfter a 7-1 win Friday, Flin Flon picked up the 8-5 win in front of 500 plus Saturday night. What makes these wins even more important besides keeping pace with Nipawin, the Bombers were able to get some secondary offense from a lot of differant players.\n\nAustin Calladine broke out for a 3 point game including 2 goals, Kocur scored his 9th, Evans his 6th and both Brandon Masson and Curtis Roach scored their first ever SJHL goals.\n\nThe 2 other goals on Saturday came from Chris Rauckman who picked up his 30th and 31st of the season to take over the league lead. Rauckman's second goal was short handed and he almost completed the hat trick in the third period with another short handed effort, when he broke in alone but Dawson MacAuley made the break away save.\n\nSaturday was an interesting game with Yorkton opening up the scoring mid way through the first period, when Gatzke fooled Simon Hofley with a wrist shot , picking a nice spot undrneath his left shoulder.\n\nThe Bombers responded and had a 4-2 lead early in the second, only to see the Terriers storm back to actually take a 5-4 lead late in the frame to quiet the Whitney faithful. The Bomber bench looked stunned and you could see the look of disapointment on the players faces.\n\nFlin Flon shook it off and got their biggest goal of the game when Austn Evans out waited starting goalie Matt Kustra and fired a shot right under the bar to tie the game at 5, with less than 2 minutes left in the second period.\n\nThe Bombers chased Kustra from the game and took all the momentum into the third period and were able to out score Yorkton 3-0 en route to the 8-5 victory.\n\nWith the 2 wins Flin Flon improves to: 23-8-5-5 and remain 1 point behind Nipawin for second spot in the Sherwood with 2 games in hand. The Bombers are tied with Notre Dame for 5th overall and do have a game in hand.\n\nFlin Flon is on a roll winning 8 out of their last 10 games including 6 straight at home, and will get their biggest test so far of 2015 when they play 4 games in 5 nights all on the road starting Tuesday in Nipawin.\n\nThe Hawks lead the season series winning 3 of the 4 meetings, all coming in extra time. This could also be a first round playoff series preview , if these teams finish 4th and 5th and that looks like a good possibility.\n\nNo matter what go's down you will have the best seat in the house with all the action on 102.9 CFAR and flinflononline.com starting with the Murray GM Coach's Show at 7:15 from the Cage.\n\nAfter a 5 day break the Flin Flon Bombers are back in action this weekend, when they entertain the defending Royal Bank Cup Champion Yorkton Terriers.\n\nFlin Flon sits third in the Sherwood with a record of: 21-8-5-5, 5th overall, 3 points behind Nipawin and 2 behind Notre Dame.\n\nYorkton is : 14-22-2-3 and are 4th in the Viterra Division, 4 points behind Estevan. Yorkton is dead last overall and if the playoffs were to start tomorrow, they would be one of the two teams on the outside looking in.\n\nThis will be the second meeting of the season between the 2 teams, with Flin Flon winning 6-3, October the 29th in Yorkton. Bomber captain Dean Allison led the way with 3 points.\n\nDespite being last in the league the Terriers are 3-5-1-1 in their last 10 and are coming off a big 3-2 win over Nipawin. Trent Cassan is also considered one of the best Junior A coach's in the business and has been able to win a lot of big games in his career.\n\nCassan has 2 league titles under his belt and has been to the final on 4 separate occasions. He is defined as the ultimate players coach who has earned lots of respect, and will give the Bombers all they can handle this weekend.\n\nFlin Flon are 6-2-0-2 in their last 10, and reeled off 6 straight wins before a couple of tough losses in Kindersley last weekend. Mike Reagan likes his team and recognizes the effort his group has been putting in and knows despite not getting the wins, his team out played a very good Kindersley team that has only lost 1 game at home in regulation all season.\n\nWhen Reagan announced that Brett Boehm was returning to Flin Flon to finish his junior hockey career, he thought that this was going to be a great opportunity for Chris Rauckman to get back on track.\n\nRauckman is red hot and has scored at least 1 goal in the last 6 games and has 29 on the season, which has him tied for the league lead with Travis Mayan of the Mustangs.\n\nBrett Boehm and Dean Allison have also started 2015 very well picking up points in 4 straight games. Boehm has 8 assists and Allison has 2 goals and 5 assists over that span.\n\nGame time both nights is 7:30 and 102.9 CFAR will have the broadcast Saturday night beginning with the Murray GM Coach's Show at 7:15.\n\nThe Flin Flon Bombers had two incredible road efforts in Kindersley this past weekend, but unfortunately only have 1 point to show for it.\n\nThe Bombers outshot Kindersley a combined 99-74 in the two games but had a tough time beating Evan Weninger who was brilliant both nights.\n\nFlin Flon had to play catch up both nights including a two goal deficit on Saturday. Gross and Macpherson put Kindersley up 2-0 after 1. The Bomber powerplay caught fire getting them back into the game when under- rated Tyler Bell fired a nice low slap shot past Weninger to get the Maroon and White on the board 7:31 into the second period.\n\nMarc Dubeau would restore the two goal lead, when he jammed in a loose puck past Simon Hofley 36 seconds after the Bell goal.\n\nThe Bombers never panicked and continued to get good pressure on the Klippers in their own zone and got a late power play goal from Chris Rauckman, when he re-directed a Tyler Bell shot from the blue line with only 32 seconds remaining in the second period.\n\nNot only did the Bombers cut the deficit to a goal, but they also grabbed some much needed momentum coming out for the third period. Kindersley were a perfect 19-0 when they led a game after 2 periods of play, but I just had a feeling that Flin Flon was not finished.\n\nThe Bombers dominated the third period and finally were able to cash in when Rauckman would score his second of the game and 29th of the season, when he picked up the puck and raced across the Klipper blue line firing a perfect back hander past Evan Weninger, with only a minute and a half remaining in regulation.\n\nThis would tie the game at 3 and send the game to overtime. The Bombers came out firing and got a couple chances right off the hop but ended up getting penalized twice and had to pretty much play the entire over time 3 on 4. Simon Hofley was great and made a lot of big saves to get the game to a shoot out.\n\nEvan Weninger would not break, stopping both Boehm and Rauckman in the shoot out while Dubeau and Young both beat Hofley to give the Klippers their 31st victory of the season.\n\nI thought this was some of the best hockey I witnessed in years, and if these two teams should meet in the playoffs, fans will be treated to some great entertainment in both rinks. There was incredible flow, great goaltending, and the elite players from both teams put on good shows. This was easy and very fun to call on the radio. Mike Reagan mentioned on the 102.9 CFAR Post Game Show that he thought his team sent a statement to Kindersley who only have 1 regulation loss at home all season.\n\nAfter the weekend the Bombers are: 21-8-5-5 and are 2 points behind the Nipawin Hawks in the Sherwood who swept a weekend series from Laronge. Flin Flon still has a game in hand.\n\nThe Bombers are 6-2-0-2 in their last 10 and sit 5th overall, and will not play till this weekend when they host the Yorkton Terriers this Friday and Saturday. You can hear Saturday's game on 102.9 CFAR and flinflononline.com with the Murray GM Coach's Show kicking things off at 7:15.\n\nAnother solid effort for the Bombers who doubled the Ice Wolves 6-3 and picked up their sixth straight win last night at the Whitney Forum.\n\nFlin Flon opened the scoring when Knaub picked up his 5th of the year, firing a rebound past Kris Joyce 8:10 into the opening period. Laronge responded late in the first when Iron re-directed a nice shot over Simon Hofley's right shoulder to make it 1-1 after 1.\n\nJared Iron would score his second of the night and 12th of the year, just 48 seconds into the second before the Bombers would take over. Bell converted a nice pass from Boehm to tie the game at 2:32, and captain Dean Allison would put Flin Flon up for good when he scored late in the frame to give the home side a 3-2 lead after 2.\n\nLots of offense in the third as Switzer and Rauckman would score on the power play and Evans-Campbell would score an insurance goal to put Flin Flon up 6-3 and chase starting goaltender Kris Joyce. Laronge would get a short handed goal from Michael Cardinal for their only goal in the third.\n\nThe Bombers fired a lot of rubber at the Ice Wolf net and out shot Laronge 53-36 and have beat the Ice Wolves 4 out of 5 games this season.\n\nFlin Flon improves to: 21-5-7-4 and continue to lead Nipawin by 1 point for second place in the Sherwood Division after the Hawks kept pace beating Melville 2-1 last night. The Bombers also have sole possesion of third place overall, 1 point up on Nipawin and 2 points on Notre Dame.\n\nBrett Boehm continues to be a great story and has picked up a point in every game he has played since coming back to the Bombers, and has 8 points in 4 games including 4 assists last night. Chris Rauckman seems to have his scoring touch back and now leads the team with 26 goals and sits second in the league, 1 goal behind Travis Mayan of Melfort.\n\nAustin Evans had a spirited fight with Cole Porter which had both benches jumping not to mention a spirited crowd at the Whitney Forum. Evans mentioned after the game that Porter had been calling him out the last 3 times they had played and he thought the timing was right and his team needed a boost.\n\n\"I kind of surprised my self how that fight went, I got some tips from some of the guys at intermission and I wanted to stand up to him and I thought win or lose it would give a boost to the guys. It was nice to finish with the big w.\"\n\nThe Bombers winning streak will be put to the test when they travel to Kindersley for back to back games this weekend. The Klippers have only lost 1 game in regulation at home this season and are unbeaten in their last 7.\n\nThis should be a great matchup with two of the league's top teams who like to put the puck in the net. Kindersley leads the league in goals for with 148 and the Bombers are right behind with 135. This will be their third meeting of the year Friday, with Flin Flon having something to prove after blowing a 4 goal lead back on December the 5th. The season series is 1-1\n\nNo matter what go's down you will have the best seat in the house with both games broadcast on 102.9 CFAR and flinflononline.com with the Murray GM Coach's Show both nights at 7:15 from the West Central Events Centre.\n\nThe CJHL trade deadline has come and gone, and Mike Reagan did plenty of wheeling and dealing, finalizing his roster to hopefully take them on a deep run in this year's playoffs.\n\nReagan mentioned that he wanted to add a defenseman and actually got two and another forward.\n\nThe first deal of the day was picking up 18 year old forward Brett Kit from the Lethbridge Hurricanes of the WHL. Weyburn had his SJHL rights and Flin Flon was able to deal futures to the Wings to acquire the former AAA Wheat King. Kit had 2 points in 28 games this season with Lethbridge.\n\nThe Bombers made another deal with Weyburn when they picked up 20 year old defenseman Cody Pettapiece who had been playing Junior B this season. Pettapiece began his career with Humboldt and was dealt to Weyburn last year and has 53 points in 127 career SJHL games.\n\nPettapiece's rights were still in Weyburn, despite not playing any games there this season, and the Bombers swapped draft picks to make the deal.\n\nFlin Flon also picked up 95 Defenseman Connor Veroba from Yorkton for future considerations. Veroba was dealt to the Terriers from Kindersley for Dylan Bayer the day before.\n\nVeroba picked up 23 points in 72 games for the Klippers.\n\nIt looks like Reagan was able to add a lot and not really have to give up much. For complete results on all the trades in the SJHL, go to sjhl.ca.\n\nWith Reagan working the phones, Gary Childerhose had the bench and the Bombers were able to pick up their 5th straight win 4-2 over Notre Dame on Saturday.\n\nAfter a slow first period which saw Notre Dame score the first goal and take a 1-0 lead to the locker room, the Bombers bounced back for a very good second period. Alex Smith jumped on a rebound to score his 16th to tie the game at 1 at 4:40.\n\nAustin Calladine finally got rewarded for his hard play by pocketing a beautiful Brett Boehm feed to give the Bombers a 2-1 lead after 2. It was Calladine's 10th of the year.\n\nChris Rauckman was able to score his 25th of the season at 11:18 of the third period, to give the Bombers a little breathing room at 3-1.\n\nThis was a big goal as Notre Dame would make it a goal game again, when Ian Williams would convert a nice tic tac toe play, to get the Hounds to 3-2 with only 2 and a half minutes to play.\n\nFlin Flon would not be denied and won a big face off, and would seal it with an empty netter when Brandon Switzer flipped a back hander into the empty cage with only 1:07 to go in regulation. This was Switzer's 5th of the year.\n\nWith the win the Bombers have hit 20 on the season and are back in second place in the Sherwood Division with 49 points. Melfort beat Nipawin 5-1 Saturday to hand the Hawks their second straight loss. The Bombers also have a game in hand on Nipawin and sit third overall tied with Notre Dame.\n\nThe new look Bombers will play one more home game this Tuesday against Laronge before hitting the road next weekend in Kindersley.\n\nFlin Flon has beaten the Ice Wolves 3 out of 4 tries this year, but the last two games have been decided by 1 goal. Laronge won the last game 2-1 in the shoot out December the 16th and are playing a lot better hockey than people expected, and have beaten all the top teams in the league including Melfort and Kindersley.\n\nThe Ice Wolves made a couple moves to bolster their lineup and are battling for one of the last playoff spots and would be in the post season if the playoffs were to start tomorrow. Game time 7:30 Tuesday night and will not be broadcast on 102.9 CFAR. We will have both games from Kindersley Friday and Saturday.,\n\nThe Flin Flon Bombers who appear to be a more confident group, used a strong first period last night to power to their fourth straight victory.\n\nThe Melfort Mustangs who were unbeaten in their last 13 grabbed a quick 1-0 lead, when scoring leader Travis Mayan broke in alone just 1:04 into the opening period and fired a nice wrist shot off the post to beat Adam Beukeboom and put Melfort up 1-0.\n\nThe Bombers shook it off and reeled off 4 straight goals from Chris Rauckman(24), Austin Evans(5),Brandon Switzer(4), and Brett Boehm who collected his first goal in a Bomber uniform.\n\nFlin Flon took a 4-1 lead to the locker room after 1 and chased starting goaltender Richard Palmer from the net for the second time this season. With new goaltender Zach Degraves the Mustangs came out firing and scored 3 goals in the second to tie it at 4. Mayand added his second of the night and league leading 27th of the season, with other goals coming from Boyer and Robin.\n\nFlin Flon would settle things down in the third period and both teams failed to score any more goals and would head to overtime for the fourth time in the 7 meetings this season.\n\nAustin Calladine would have a great chance to win the game, but Degraves made a huge glove save on his slap shot just outside the left circle. It was Degraves best of the night after coming in the game to relieve Palmer.\n\nCaptain clutch, Dean Allison would not let his team be denied a second time in OT, when he skated up the ice on a 2 on 1 and sent a rocket over the left shoulder of Degraves sending the Bombers and the Whitney Forum into a frenzy with a 5-4 OT victory.\n\nIt was Allison's 11th goal of the year and helped Flin Flon keep their winning streak alive at 4. The Bomber record now stands at 2-3-1-1 against the league leading Mustangs with one more meeting between the two teams on February the 4th in Flin Flon.\n\nI thought Adam Beukeboom was very solid in net for Flin Flon and recovered well after surrendering a goal just a minute into the opening period, stopping 37 out of 41 shots on the night. Melfort got to the front of the net a lot and Beukeboom was tested with lots of quality shots.\n\nBeukeboom said he wasn't too concerned about giving up a goal that early in the game. \"Honestly with the way the boys have been playing, it was just like okay we are down a goal, that doesn't mean we are out of it, nothing has changed. The boys bounced back very well so, for me it is the same as anything I let in a goal on the first or last shot of the game like Sunday, the focus for me is to always stop the next one.\"\n\nThey are all big wins at this time of the year and the Bombers have improved to: 19-7-5-4 and have closed the gap betwen them and the Hawks, with Flin Flon only 1 point behind Nipawin for second in the Sherwood. Both teams have played 35 games and still have to play each other 4 more times this season.\n\nFlin Flon will now focus their efforts on the Notre Dame Hounds who come to town Saturday , which will be our first radio broadcast of 2015. We hit the air at 7:15 with the Murray GM Coach's Show and play by play at 7:30.\n\nIt will also be the January 10th CJHL trade deadline day, and Mike Reagan told me he would like to add at least 1 more defenseman to compliment an already talented group. It will be interesting to see what happens right across the league with a lot of teams still in it. We will have complete results for you on all the teams in the SJHL at flinflononline.com\n\nIt didn't take long for Brett Boehm to make his presence felt at the Whitney Forum Sunday night. Boehm undressed the Humboldt defense and made a beautiful pass to Chris Rauckman who buried his 23rd of the season which turned out to be the game winning goal as the Bombers held off Humboldt 2-1.\n\nThis was the Bombers second win of the season over the Broncos, who had taken the last two meetings including a 3-2 victory in Humboldt December the 17th. The season series will end up 2-2.\n\nTonight was the much awaited return for Brett Boehm who made his way back to the team that he began his career with and he looked like the Brett Boehm of old, by making lots of slick moves all over the ice. No question, Boehm will be an attention grabber in any building that he suits up in for the rest of this season.\n\nCurtis Roach , who was reassigned by the Prince Albert Raiders of the WHL, also made his Bomber debut and this is what Mike Reagan thought of theses two players performance in their Bomber debuts Sunday night. \" I thought Roachie played very well for only playing 7 games this year, he has very good composure for a 17 year old who logged a lot of minutes. We used him a lot on both the power play and penalty kill. He is a big strong kid that is only going to get better.\" \"As for Brett Boehm, he does what Brett Boehm does, he put the puck right on the goal line for Rauckman to score. He didn't even have to look, a blind monkey could score that goal, it was a great set up. It is going to take some time for them to form some chemistry and as soon as they have a chance to get in some practise time together I think you will see them do some great things.\"\n\nIt looked like Adam Beukeboom was going to pick up his fourth shut out of the season, but the Broncos were able to get on the board with only 7 seconds left in the game on a 6 on 4 situation. Humboldt were on the power play and also pulled their goalie. Marr redirected a shot past Beukeboom to spoil the shut out bid.\n\nFlin Flon opened up the scoring late in the first period when Tyler Bell fired a slap shot past Brock Hamm on the power play with only 5 seconds left in the period for his fourth of the season.\n\nWith the win, the Bombers have won 3 in a row and are: 18-7-5-4 on the season and trail second place Nipawin by 3 points in the Sherwood Division with a game in hand.\n\nFlin Flon will get a strong test Tuesday when the front running Melfort Mustangs come to town. The Mustangs have won 9 of their last 10 games and have a 15 point lead on Flin Flon for first in the division. Melfort have won 5 out of 6 meetings between the two teams this year including both games at the Whitney Forum.\n\nSome unfortunate news , Mike Reagan confirmed that Tanner Lishchynski will not be returning to the team as he has earned the right to stay with Kootenay for the rest of the year. Lishchynski was only supposed to fill in til the World JR'S were over but Kootenay has been so impressed with his play that they have asked him to stay.\n\nNo broadcast of the game Tuesday, but we will be back on the air for the first time in 2015 when the Bombers host Notre Dame on Saturday.\n\nMike Reagan Head Coach and General Manager of the Flin Flon Bombers was down at the CFAR studio to make a huge announcement regarding the hockey club Friday afternoon.\n\nReagan who has pulled off some of the most amazing and biggest deals in the league during his eight year tenure, made perhaps the most shocking earlier today.\n\nFormer Bomber, Brett Boehm has decided to return to the team he began his career with and wrap up a brilliant junior career in Flin Flon.\n\nBoehm was moved to Yorkton last year mid season and was able to have a lot of success including a league, Western and RBC National Championship. Boehm was playing for the University of Minnesota Duluth this season, but had only dressed for 5 games.\n\nHere is Mike Reagan with the announcement from earlier today\n\nThe Bombers also got deeper on the back end as highly touted prospect Curtis Roach, has been re-assigned from the Prince Albert Raiders of the WHL. Roach was one of the Bombers top prospects heading into the season and will fit into this lineup nicely.\n\nHis brother Josh came to Flin Flon as a 20 year old from Humboldt a couple years back and was the best defenseman in the entire league.\n\nBoth players will be in the lineup when Flin Flon hosts Humboldt this Sunday starting at 6PM."
