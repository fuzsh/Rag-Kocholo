Mahlzeit\n\nAug 12 - Algeria purchased 630,000 tons of Black Sea wheat at the tender (OAIC)\n\nThe Algerian state agency OAIC bought about 630,000 tons of flour wheat at a tender last week at a price of $250.5-252/t C&F, Reuters reports with reference to traders from the EU.\n\nAccording to the terms of the tender, shipments of wheat from the main supply regions, including Europe, will take place in October, and from South America or Australia - in September.\n\nAlgeria does not disclose the details of the tender, so the final data on volumes and prices may change. Market participants believe that the low price may indicate the purchase of wheat from the Russian Federation or other Black Sea countries.\n\nAlgeria is among the top five buyers of Russian wheat. In 2023/24 MR, it imported about 2.3 million tons of wheat.\n\nWe will remind that at the previous tender on July 18, Algeria purchased 700-750 thousand tons of wheat, presumably of Ukrainian, Russian and Bulgarian origin, at a price of $241-244/t C&F.\n\nAug 12 - High hopes in Israel for 'super hero' cocoa that survived frontline conditions\n\nFarming can develop in mysterious ways. Israeli researchers learned about that when the war in Gaza seemed to have all but wrecked their work on a more resilient strain of the cocoa plant that could help alleviate a global shortage of the beans. Just days after Israel's agriculture research centre, the Volcani Institute, sent 140 seedlings to a facility in southern Israel to study how this tropical plant could be grown in dry conditions, the area came under attack by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas.\n\nAug 09 - Ukrainian Weekly Agri Commodity Report ( SPIKE BROKERS )\n\nSold in a week\n\n· corn DAP Odessa, Ukraine, Oct @186$\n\n· corn DAP Odessa, Ukraine, Jan @188$\n\n· FCA corn w. the border of Ukraine, Jan-Feb @180€\n\n· FCA corn w. border of Ukraine, birch @181€\n\n· wheat 11.5pro DAP Odessa, Ukraine, Aug @200$\n\n· feed wheat DAP Odessa, Ukraine, Aug @180$\n\n· sunflower DAP center.

Delivery for October-January was traded to ports of $184-188, and on the border with the EU, the bidding took place at €180-181, with loading in wagons with delivery in January-March. Producers, assessing the potential of the crop after the July temperature stress, gradually form a forward sales book and organize logistics.\n\n- WHEAT\n\nThe spread between forage and food wheat remains at up to $20. Producers are holding back sales in anticipation of higher prices, leading to the accumulation of deferred supply and creating additional pressure on the price of wheat in September, which is traditionally the period of the lowest prices.\n\n- RAPE\n\nThe stock prices for rapeseed have already twice sharply decreased from the peak of 510€, reached on July 5. The similarity of this year's fluctuations with last year causes traders doubts about the possible further increase in prices. The only supporting factor for dollar prices remains the devaluation of the US currency against the euro, which helps keep prices at a stable level in the direction of ports.\n\n- SUNFLOWER\n\nThe new sunflower crop is traded in the range of $460-490 with VAT, depending on the region of delivery to the plant. Processors are actively competing for raw materials to ensure the smooth operation of their capacities at the beginning of the new season.\n\n- SOYA\n\nThe spread between GMOs and non-GMOs of soy remains at around $40. Soya is actively traded both in the direction of ports and on the western border. At the same time, in the direction of Europe, there is an increased demand for non-GMO soybeans.\n\nAug 09 - Strategie Grains reduces EU wheat forecasts on poor yields\n\nStrategie Grains has sharply lowered its monthly forecast for European Union soft wheat output and exports to its lowest in six years, citing worse than expected yields in rain-hit France and Germany. The consultancy's projection for the EU's main cereal crop was reduced to 116.5 million metric tons, down from the 122.3 million tons forecast in July and now 8.4% below last season's crop.\n\nAug 09 - Cocoa swollen shoot disease worsening in Ghana, poses long-term threat\n\nGhana's cocoa sector faces a long-term threat from worsening swollen shoot disease as recent data indicates the world's second largest grower of the bean is not managing to contain the outbreak, traders and experts said. Spread by small insects called mealybugs that eat leaves, buds and flowers, swollen shoot initially allows trees to produce, but at a reduced rate. After five to 10 years however, it kills them.\n\nAug 08 - Cooler weather threatens Argentine wheat with frost, exchange says\n\nCooler-than-expected temperatures in Argentina next week could trigger frosts and damage crops in one of the world's largest grain-exporting nations, the Buenos Aires Grains Exchange said on Wednesday. Wheat is likely to be the worst-hit major crop, as farmers in the South American nation have yet to start planting their corn and soybean crops for the 2024/25 season.\n\nAug 08 - Cocoa prices to head higher by end-2024 amid record deficit\n\nCocoa prices are expected to continue heading higher this year due to persistent supply shortages that will leave them at more than double last year's levels by the end of 2024, a Reuters poll of 12 traders and analysts showed on Wednesday. London cocoa was seen ending the year at 7,600 pounds a metric ton, up 40% from Tuesday's close and 125% higher than at the end of 2023, according to the poll's median forecast.\n\nAug 07 - Egypt bets big with historic 3.8 million metric ton wheat tender\n\nEgypt's state grains buyer, the General Authority for Supply Commodities, announced on Tuesday a massive tender for 3.8 million metric tons of wheat to cover imports between October 2024 and April 2025, its largest ever according to traders. Egypt has been one of the world's largest wheat importers, mainly to provide subsidised bread for tens of millions of its people. GASC alone imports some 5.5 million metric tons of wheat annually for bread subsidies.\n\nAug 07 - China July soybean imports rise 2.9% on-year, customs data show\n\nChina's soybean imports rose 2.9% in July from a year earlier, spurred by lower prices and fears of heightened trade tensions between Beijing and the U.S. if Donald Trump returns as president. The world's top soybean buyer imported 9.85 million metric tons in July, customs data showed on Wednesday, less than traders' expectations that arrivals would reach 12 million-13 million tons.\n\nAug 06 - Heatwave could cut Ukraine corn harvest by 6 mln tons, producers say\n\nA record heatwave in July across most Ukrainian regions may reduce the 2024 corn harvest by about 6 million metric tons from last year's level, Ukrainian producers' group the Ukrainian Agrarian Council (UAC) has warned. It gave no forecast for the resultant harvest total but its prediction is in line with a forecast last week from the Ukrainian grain traders union UGA, which foresaw a 2024 corn harvest of 23.4 million tons compared with 29.6 million in 2023.\n\nAug 06 - Bunge, ADM to benefit as US farmers sell cheap crops in 'haul of shame'\n\nA spike in bargain-basement crop sales by U.S. farmers needing to make room in storage bins for autumn harvests could boost profitability at grain handlers such as Archer-Daniels-Midland and Bunge Global. Both companies, which trade and process soybeans and corn and benefit from geographic differences in supply, recently flagged slow farmer selling as a drag on second-quarter earnings.\n\nAug 05 - Malaysian palm oil stocks seen down, first time in four months\n\nPalm oil inventories in Malaysia, the world's second-biggest producer, is expected to drop in July for the first time after three consecutive months of rise, a Reuters survey showed on Monday. Malaysia's palm oil stocks were seen at 1.80 million metric tons, down 1.17% from June-end, according to the median estimate of 11 traders, planters and analysts polled by Reuters.\n\nAug 05 - World food prices ease slightly in July, UN says\n\nThe United Nations world food price index eased slightly in July according to data released on Friday, with a decline in the index for cereals offset in part by increases for meat, vegetable oils and sugar. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization's price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 120.8 points in July, down from 121.0 in June. The June reading was revised after initially being given as 120.6.\n\nAug 05 - Australia exports 39,718t chickpeas, 140,549t lentils in June (Grain Central)\n\n- AUSTRALIA exported 39,718 tonnes of chickpeas and 140,549t of lentils in June, according to the latest data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\n\nThe chickpea figure is down 9 percent from the May total of 43,849t, despite the uptick in exports to India and Nepal.\n\nDrops for the month included Pakistan, down 2698t, and the United Arab Emirates, down 3500t.\n\n- Lentil exports in June were up 8pc from the May figure of 130,295t, with rises over the month of 5453t from Bangladesh, 2578t from Egypt and 2905t from Nepal the main drivers.\n\n- Shipping stems indicate bulk exports of lentils have slowed right down this month to indicate Australia’s rundown on stocks as Canadian new-crop hits the supply chain.\n\nOn chickpeas, slots booked indicate around 300,000t in bulk alone will be shipped in the coming quarter as harvest rolls south from Central Queensland to northern New South Wales.\n\nChickpea crop conditions are very good to excellent in all major desi-growing regions.\n\nConditions for lentils are generally less favourable, with some districts in South Australia and Victoria needing good rain in coming weeks to ensure average yields are achieved.\n\nAug 02 - Ukrainian Weekly Agri Report (SPIKE BROKERS)\n\n- Sold in a week\n\n· wheat 11.5pro DAP Odessa, Ukraine, Aug @200$\n\n· feed wheat DAP Odessa, Ukraine, Aug @182$\n\n· corn DAP Odessa, Ukraine, Dec-Sich @189$->186$\n\n· rape NE-GMO DAP Odesa, Ukraine, Aug @485$\n\n· sunflower DAP Odessa, Ukraine, heather @495$ with VAT\n\n· Soybean GMO DAP Odessa, Ukraine, Oct-Dec @390$\n\n- Ukraine\n\n· The indicator of exports from Ukraine of cereals, oilseeds, as well as processed products for July is: corn - 1 560.2 thousand mt, wheat - 1 545.4 thousand mt, barley - 580.8 thousand mt, soybean - 226.6 thousand mt, rape - 277.7 thousand mt, sunflower - 3.5 thousand mt, sunflower oil - 438.9 thousand mt, soybean oil - 29.6 thousand mt, rapeseed oil - 10.8 thousand tons, sunflower oil - 109 thousand mt. mt, soybean cake - 63.4 thousand mt.\n\n· UGA updated the potential yield of grains and oilseeds to 71.8 million tons, which is 2.8 million tons less than the previous estimate.\n\n- CORN\n\nThe 2023 corn harvest continues to be traded, but there is a low activity of market participants, as the focus has shifted to corn of the new crop. Given the reduced demand from external buyers, the liquidity has decreased slightly and on CPT conditions. Buyers' price offers are currently in the range of 178-184$ CPT ports, depending on the delivery period.\n\nThe demand for corn from European buyers remains inactive. In the direction of the western border of Ukraine corn can be sold at 175-185€ FCA.\n\n- WHEAT\n\nThe trading activity during the week was significant against the background of wheat price correction in deep-sea ports. Buyers' attention is mainly focused on feed wheat for spot deliveries in the range of 178-182$, depending on the protein content. The spread between food and forage wheat remains about 20$.\n\n- RAPE\n\nA significant fluctuation in the price of rapeseed on MATIF during the week increased the number of offers and on the physical market. The rapeseed continues to be actively traded; from the buyers in the direction of the port, the price offers are in the range of 470-495$ CPT ports. In the regions prices fluctuate within 440-460$ CPT elevator/plant, equivalent without VAT. The demand of European buyers remains stable.\n\n- SUNFLOWER\n\nThe new sunflower crop demonstrates significant trading activity. The main direction of implementation is the domestic market with delivery to the plants at 450-475$ with VAT. In the direction of ports prices are within 430-435$ CPT. Demand from Europe is also observed, but the supply is quite limited.\n\n- SOYA\n\nSoybean prices remained unchanged compared to last week. Trade is concentrated more towards Ukrainian ports. Demand on the western border is not very active, as many buyers have covered the forward need in the past three months and are currently less active in procurement.\n\nAug 02 - Russia maintains grain harvest forecast despite bad weather\n\nRussia has maintained its official grain harvest forecast for this year at 132 million metric tons despite adverse weather conditions across many grain-producing regions, said Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Patrushev, who oversees the agriculture sector. Extreme weather events such as early spring frosts, floods, and summer heat have affected this year's harvest outlook in some key producing areas of Russia, the world's biggest wheat exporter.\n\nAug 02 - Moderate rains likely to boost Argentina's wheat crop in coming days\n\nModerate rains in Argentina's farming heartland over the next few days are expected to benefit the 2024/25 wheat crop, which has suffered from dry and cold conditions, the Buenos Aires grain exchange (BdeC) said Thursday. Argentina is a major global wheat exporter and, according to the grains exchange, planting for the current agricultural campaign was completed last week, covering 6.3 million hectares nationwide.\n\nAug 01 - USDA June soy crush estimated at 184.584 million bushels, analysts sayThe U.S. soybean crush likely slowed in June to 5.538 million short tons, or 184.584 million bushels, analysts surveyed by Reuters estimated ahead of a monthly U.S. Department of Agriculture report due on Thursday. If the average of eight estimates is realized, it would be down 3.8% from the 192.0 million bushels crushed in May but up 5.8% from the June 2023 crush of 174.5 million bushels.\n\nAug 01 - Grain traders union UGA cuts Ukraine 2024 grain and oilseeds crop forecast\n\nUkrainian grain traders union UGA cut Ukraine's 2024 combined grain and oilseeds crop forecast by 2.8 million metric tons to 71.8 million tons due to a heatwave, the union said on Wednesday. UGA said the 2024 harvest could include 23.4 million tons of corn, 19.8 million tons of wheat, 4.95 million tons of barley, 12.8 million tons of sunseed, 4.8 million tons of soybeans and 4.3 million tons of rapeseed.\n\nJul 31 - Domestic wheat prices soar for first time since May (SovEkon)\n\n- By the end of last week, the prices of class 4 Russian wheat (with protein 12.5%; excluding VAT) in deep-sea ports rose by 1,000 rubles compared to last week to 15,500-16,000 rubles per ton. This is the strongest growth since late May. Russian quotes were supported by the growth in demand from exporters.\n\n- Grade 4 wheat quotations in the South rose by 650 rubles to 14,550 rubles per ton, while in the Center - remained unchanged by 11,600 rubles per ton.\n\n- Export demand for wheat in the South has increased in recent weeks amid strong sales. As of July 30, the volume of concluded sales contracts amounted to 3.2 million tons, compared to 2.6 million tons a month earlier.\n\n- In July, Russia also actively sold wheat on tenders. In a July tender, Egypt's GASC purchased 720,000 tons of Russian wheat. Algeria's OAIC agency has purchased 600,000-800,000 tons of wheat, part of which will be supplied from Russia.\n\n- SovEkon estimates July wheat exports at 3.2m tons, compared to 4.5m tons a year earlier and 3.0m tons on average over five years.\n\nJul 31 - Rain-hit French wheat crop could plunge to 26 mln T, producers say\n\nFrance's main wheat crop may only reach 26 million metric tons this year, a level not seen since the 1980s, as harvest results confirm a plunge in yields following months of heavy rain, producers group AGPB said on Tuesday. A poor harvest in France, the European Union's biggest grain producer, has been widely anticipated after the wet weather cut autumn planting before hampering crop development.\n\nJul 31 - ADM misses profit estimates on US demand dip and lower crush margins\n\nGlobal grains merchant Archer-Daniels-Midland Co shares dropped 2% on Tuesday after the company missed Wall Street expectations for second-quarter profit, which were hit by lower soy crush margins and waning demand for U.S. crops. Such lower profits reflect the challenge global grain merchants and oilseed processors now face, as crop prices hover at nearly four-year lows due to a hefty global stockpiles of corn and soybeans.\n\nJul 30 - Freezing temperatures threaten Argentina's wheat crops\n\nFreezing temperatures in Argentina's main agricultural region on Monday aggravated the condition of the 2024/25 wheat crop, which is already suffering from the impact of a major drought, the Rosario grains exchange said in a report. Argentina is a key global wheat exporter, but due to a significant lack of rainfall in its agricultural core, the grains exchange earlier this month reduced its forecast for the area planted with wheat by 2.9% to 6.7 million hectares.\n\nJul 30 - Strategie Grains cuts EU rapeseed and sunseed crop forecasts again\n\nStrategie Grains has again reduced its monthly forecasts for this year's rapeseed and sunflower seed harvests in the European Union as unfavourable weather continued to affect the bloc's main oilseed crops, the consultancy said. The firm cut its outlook for the EU's 2024 rapeseed harvest for the third time in a row.\n\nJul 29 - Only half of French soft wheat crop in good condition, FranceAgriMer says\n\nRatings of French soft wheat fell again last week to hit another eight-year low with now only half of the crop in good condition, while harvesting remained well behind average as wet weather throughout the cycle continued to weigh on crops. An estimated 50% of soft wheat was in good or excellent condition by July 22, down from 52% a week earlier and 78% a year ago, farm office FranceAgriMer said in cereal crop data.\n\nJul 29 - US court rejects EPA denials of 2022 small refinery biofuel waivers\n\nA federal appeals court said on Friday it rejected the Environmental Protection Agency’s decision in 2022 to deny small oil refineries temporary waivers from the nation’s biofuels blending program, and sent the matter back to the agency for review. The decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is a win for the refining industry, which has long opposed federal requirements under the Renewable Fuel Standard that they add biofuels such as corn-based ethanol into the nation’s fuel.\n\nJul 26 - Recent rains allow Argentina to complete wheat planting in main farmland\n\nRecent rains have allowed Argentine farmers to finish wheat planting for the current harvesting season in the country's agricultural heartland, according to a report from the Buenos Aires grains exchange (BdeC) released on Thursday. While wheat planting is complete in all major farmland for the 2024/25 cycle, planting over 6.3 million hectares dedicated to the key grains crop nationwide is 98.5% complete, the weekly report from the BdeC showed.\n\nJul 26 - US spring wheat tour forecasts record North Dakota yield\n\nScouts on an annual North Dakota crop tour on Thursday projected that hard red spring wheat yields in the top-producing state will average 54.5 bushels per acre, the highest ever according to records going back to 1992. The figure was well above the Wheat Quality Council tour's 2023 estimate of 47.4 bushels per acre and the five-year average of 42 bushels per acre, excluding 2020.\n\nJul 25 - Crop tour forecasts record wheat yields in parts of North Dakota\n\nU.S. spring wheat crops in northwest and north-central North Dakota are expected to produce the highest yields since at least 1994, the Wheat Quality Council said on an annual tour on Wednesday. Crop scouts estimated the average hard red spring wheat yield at 53.7 bushels per acre, up from 45.7 bushels in the same area last year. The five-year average for this part of the state is 40.02 bushels, excluding 2020 when no tour was held because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nJul 25 - Sugar market to have smaller surplus as Brazil crop falls, says broker\n\nThe global sugar market is expected to have a smaller-than-anticipated supply surplus in 2024/25 (Oct-Sept) despite rising production in Asia, due to a significant reduction on the Brazilian crop, broker StoneX said on Wednesday. StoneX cut its projection for Brazil's Centre-South sugar output by nearly 2 million metric tons to 40.5 million tons due to this year's lower quality of the sugarcane and a smaller-than-expected cane allocation to sugar production.\n\nJul 24 - US spring wheat tour forecasts record yields for southern North Dakota\n\nScouts on the first day of an annual U.S. crop tour on Tuesday projected spring wheat in southern and east-central North Dakota will produce the highest yields in tour records dating to 1994. The Wheat Quality Council tour said participants estimated an average hard red spring wheat yield of 52.5 bushels per acre, compared to the tour's day-one findings in 2023 of 48.1 bushels.\n\nJul 24 - EU 2024/25 soft wheat exports down 35% but French data still lacking\n\nSoft wheat exports from the European Union since the start of the 2024/25 season in July had reached 1.44 million metric tons by July 21, down 35% from 2.21 million tons a year earlier, data published by the European Commission showed on Tuesday. EU barley exports for the first three weeks of 2024/25 totalled 533,177 tons, down 42% from 919,333 tons in the corresponding period in 2023/24.\n\nJul 23 - MARS cuts EU 2024 maize outlook after hot weather in southeast\n\nEuropean Union crop monitoring service MARS on Monday cut most of its forecasts for average grain yields in the EU this year, with the sharpest drop for maize and sunflower which suffered from hot and dry weather in the southeastern part of the bloc. Grain and oilseed crops have faced adverse yet contrasting weather this year with excessive rainfall in the north hurting winter cereals, notably wheat which is on track for its smallest crop since 2020, and drought in the south hurting summer crops.\n\nJul 23 - Brazil sugar production estimate cut by 300,000 tons, says broker\n\nBrazil's sugar production in 2024/25 (April-March) was revised down by 300,000 metric tons on Monday to 41.3 million tons due to lower-than-expected cane allocation to produce sugar and poor cane quality, broker Hedgepoint Global Markets said. Hedgepoint's sugar analyst Livia Coda said in a note that mills are earmarking less cane to sugar production than initially estimated, due mainly to the lower quality of the crop compared to last season as well as to the quick pace of harvesting.\n\nJul 22 - China June soy imports from Brazil rise 2%, customs data show\n\nChina's soybean imports from Brazil rose 2.2% in June from a year earlier, data showed on Saturday, as Chinese buyers scooped up lower-priced South American beans. The world's biggest soybean buyer imported 9.72 million metric tons of the oilseed from Brazil last month, compared with 9.51 million tons a year earlier, data from the General Administration of Customs showed.\n\nJul 22 - Funds expand all-time bearish soy view and stage record meal sell-off - Braun\n\nSpeculators last week established another record net short in Chicago-traded soybeans as strong U.S. crop prospects and an oversupply of beans in China have dragged futures to near four-year lows. In the week ended July 16, money managers expanded their net short in CBOT soybean futures and options to a new high of 185,750 contracts from 172,605 a week earlier, and this was predominantly the result of new gross shorts.\n\nJul 19 - Ukrainian Agri Weekly report (SPIKE BROKERS)\n\nSold in a week\n\n· corn DAP Odessa, Ukraine, Dec @181$\n\n· wheat 11.5pro DAP Odessa, Ukraine, Jul-Aug @198$\n\n· soybean GMO DAP Odessa, Ukraine, Oct-letter @380$->370$\n\n· sunflower oil DAP Odessa, Ukraine, Jul @920$\n\n- Ukraine\n\n· For the 17 days of July, Ukraine exported: corn - 1,037 thousand tons, wheat - 785 thousand tons, barley - 266.7 thousand tons, soybean - 135.9 thousand tons, rape - 58.5 thousand tons, sunflower seeds - 188.1 thousand tons, sunflower oil - 260.7 thousand tons, soybean oil - 15.3 thousand tons.\n\n· In July, Ukraine's total exports were directed to Europe - 46.6% or 1,399 thousand tons, to the Middle East and Asia - 48% or 1,443 thousand tons and other destinations - 5.3% or 159.2 thousand tons.\n\n- Europe\n\n· According to French farmers, grain yields in the 2024/25 season will decrease by 13-20% compared to previous average annual indicators due to bad weather.\n\n- Brazil\n\n· According to Conab, 74% of the second corn harvest in Brazil has already been harvested, which is much higher than last year's figure of 39% for the same period.\n\n- CORN\n\nCurrent spot demand for corn in the direction of Ukrainian ports is at 174-178$ CPT ports. At the same time, sellers are gradually shifting attention to the new crop, which returned to the levels of 175$+ CPT ports, which stimulated the restoration of the activity of fixation of forward contracts.\n\nIn the western direction, corn can be sold at a price of 165€ FCA border, loaded in the gondola, with delivery in October-December.\n\n- WHEAT\n\nOver the past week, there has been an active demand for food wheat, stabilizing prices in the range of 194-200$ on CPT ports, depending on the protein content. At the same time, the prices of feed wheat were adjusted to 171-175$ CPT; the spread between food and feed wheat rose again to 15-20$.\n\nAs of 18.07, 10.3 million tons of wheat were collected in Ukraine. Sellers focus on the implementation of forward contracts, against the background of which the activity of the supply of new supplies is not high.\n\n- RAPE\n\nThe resumption of MATIF stock quotes over the past few days, after a significant fall last week, significantly intensified the offer. As of 18.07, the rape was threshed with 1.8 million tons. The harvesting campaign is in progress, affecting the growth of the supply. In the regions where prices for rapeseed for the last week are in the range of 21,000-21,700 UAH with VAT delivered to the elevator, there is a significant activity of trade. Prices in the direction of the ports and the western border were also rising and were in the range of 460-470$ CPT ports and 415-420€ FCA border.\n\n- SOYA\n\nExtremely arid weather has recently significantly deterred the implementation of soybeans, and sellers were in anticipation of the rains to formulate further plans for implementation. At the same time, the demand for oil was also in a state of search for stabilization levels. Currently, GMO soybean is traded at 365-370$ CPT ports and 350-355€ FCA border. The premium for NE-GMO quality increased to 20-25€; until recently it was about 10€.\n\nJul 19 - China faces soybean glut as peak US export season nears\n\nChina is facing an oversupply of soybeans as record high purchases boost stockpiles at a time when animal feed demand remains subdued, with prices of products such as soyoil and soymeal set to sink even lower. The soybean surplus also threatens to curb China's appetite for imports in the September-December period, the peak marketing season for U.S. beans, putting further pressure on prices already near four-year lows, traders and analysts said.\n\nJul 19 - Global sugar market looks headed towards surplus, analysts say\n\nThe global sugar market looks increasingly likely to have a supply surplus in the 2024/25 season (Oct-Sept), despite an expected smaller Brazilian crop, as analysts believe other regions will produce more than initially expected.

Australia’s bulk wheat exports to China have trended down sharply in recent months, with the May total at 116,285t less than one quarter of the 516,295t shipped in April. This indicates China’s switch to new-crop Northern Hemisphere grain, including its own.\n\n“The screws keep tightening on the major exporters’ balance sheets, with the USDA cutting Russian production by 5Mt in June and Ukraine and EU by 1.5Mt each,” the Lachstock report said.\n\n“The USDA offset the production cuts by lowering global feed use by over 4Mt,.\n\n“Global ending stocks were lowered by a further 1.3Mt to 252.3Mt, the lowest ending-stocks number since 2014-15, and when you exclude China, you get the lowest ending stocks since 2007-08.”\n\nThe size of the Russian crop has been hotly debated and after the initial panic over the dry spring and a number of frost events resulting in up to 10Mt in production cuts, some estimates are now being revised back up.\n\n“The range is wide, with estimates anywhere from 75Mt to 85Mt.\n\n“We are unlikely to know the true size of the crop until we get through the 2024-25 export program.”\n\nLachstock referenced Russian offers in the latest GASC tender to supply Egypt were US$38/t lower than the previous tender, suggesting Russia has “plenty of grain to move”.\n\nJul 05 - Argentina's soybean harvest ends at five-year record\n\nThe Argentine 2023/24 soybean season ended with a final harvest of 50.5 million tons, the highest volume recorded in the last five years, the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange said on Thursday, even after a severe summer heat wave dried crops.

At the same time, the sellers behaved quite discreetly in anticipation of higher levels.\n\n- WHEAT\n\nWheat prices have decreased under the pressure of a significant offer and seasonal correction due to the reluctance of buyers to make active purchases before the market is saturated with a new crop. The last deals were at $176 for non-protein feed wheat, $180 for 10% wheat and $190 worth of food wheat with export to seaports. The western border was trading food wheat with a minimum protein of 11% at a price of 170€, loaded in the European train July-August.\n\n- BARLEY\n\nUkraine has threshed about 10% of the planned areas of barley and harvested the first half million tons of barley of the new crop. Prices decreased by 10$, to 150-155$, delivered to seaports.\n\n- RAPE\n\nPrices for rape remain unchanged in relation to last week due to the correction of the bases in all areas. According to market estimates, about 1 million tons of rapeseed have already been sold in all directions. Domestic recycling is still not active in procurement, with the expectation that more bulk will be offered by the start of harvesting in July.\n\n- SOYA\n\nUkrainian producers of western Ukraine continue to actively enter into contracts for the supply of new soybean crop in the direction of Europe. The European market has fallen in price by 10-15€ per ton compared to last week.\n\nJun 27 - India grants duty concessions for corn, vegetable oil imports\n\nIndia on Wednesday allowed limited imports of corn, crude sunflower oil, refined rapeseed oil, and milk powder under the tariff-rate quota (TRQ), where importers pay nil or lower duty, as New Delhi tries to bring down food inflation. India is the world's biggest importer of vegetable oils such as palm oil, soyoil and sunflower oil and the top producer of milk.\n\nJun 27 - EU governments fail to agree on gene-editing rules despite patent exception\n\nA last-ditch attempt by EU governments to break a deadlock over relaxing regulations on gene-edited crops failed after countries including Poland rejected changes to the text that exempted patented seeds from the measure. The text for so-called new genomic techniques (NGT), which would be the foundation of negotiations with the European Parliament before the law could take effect, was withdrawn from Wednesday's agenda after it emerged in preliminary talks that there was insufficient support to reach a qualified majority, according to an EU official.\n\nJun 27 - Algeria buys wheat in tender for shipment to 2 ports, traders say\n\nAlgeria’s state grains agency OAIC is believed to have bought about 130,000 to 150,000 metric tons of milling wheat in an international tender on Wednesday which sought limited shipment to two ports only, European traders said. Purchases reported were around $248 to $250 a metric ton cost and freight (c&f) included, they said.\n\nJun 27 - Jordan makes no purchase in barley tender, launches new one\n\nJordan's state grain buyer is believed to have made no purchase in an international tender for 120,000 metric tons of animal feed barley which closed on Wednesday, European traders said. A new tender has been issued closing on July 3, they said.\n\nJun 26 - Hot spell hits summer crops in east Europe, but a relief in northwest\n\nA heatwave due to spread throughout Europe this week is set to take a heavy toll on summer crops in the southeast but is good news for farmers on the other side of the region after prolonged rains flooded fields and hampered plants' growth, analysts said. Meteorologists forecast scorching temperatures in most parts of the European Union this week, just as record heat and dry weather are threatening crops in other major global growing regions, hitting world supplies and pushing prices higher.\n\nJun 26 - Denmark will be first to impose CO2 tax on farms, government says\n\nDenmark, a major pork and dairy exporter, will introduce a tax on livestock carbon dioxide emissions from 2030, making it the first country to do so and hoping to inspire others to follow, the government said on Tuesday. A tax was first proposed in February by government-commissioned experts to help Denmark reach a legally binding 2030 target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 70% from 1990 levels.\n\nJun 26 - Egypt's GASC buys 470,000 metric tons of wheat in tender\n\nEgypt's state grains buyer, the General Authority for Supply Commodities (GASC), said on Tuesday that it had bought 470,000 metric tons of wheat in an international tender. The purchase comprised 50,000 tons of Bulgarian wheat, 60,000 tons of Ukrainian wheat, 180,000 tons of Russian wheat and 180,000 tons of Romanian wheat, GASC said.\n\nJun 26 - South Korea’s NOFI buys estimated 135,000 T corn, traders say\n\nLeading South Korean animal feed maker Nonghyup Feed Inc. (NOFI) bought an estimated 135,000 metric tons of animal feed corn all expected to be sourced from South America in an international tender on Tuesday, European traders said. It was bought in two consignments, both at an estimated $240.06 a ton cost and freight (c&f) included, with some also purchased at a premium over Chicago corn futures, they said.\n\nJun 25 - From Black Sea to US Midwest, extreme weather threatens crop output\n\nForecast dryness in the Black Sea region's breadbasket is likely to stunt sunflower and corn yields, while heavy rain in the U.S. after near-record temperatures threatens to take a toll on crops, squeezing world supplies and pushing prices higher. \"The weather forecast for the Black Sea region is a big red flag,\" said Chris Hyde, a meteorologist at U.S.-based Maxar, with dryness and below-normal rains expected for July and August likely to crimp the region's key corn and sunflower crops.\n\nJun 25 - India buys record amount of sunoil as Ukraine-Russia fight for market share cuts price\n\nIndians bought a record 500,000 metric tons of sunflower oil for June delivery, as competition between leading suppliers Russia and Ukraine made it cheaper than soyoil and palm oil, two leading buyers and a customs official told Reuters. Higher sunflower oil purchases by the world's biggest importer of vegetable oils will help to reduce sunflower oil inventories in the Black Sea region and lift sunoil prices.\n\nJun 24 - Severe drought forces corn farmers in China's east to delay planting\n\nChina, also the world's No. 1 corn importer, produced a record 288.8 million metric tons last year and aims to grow more to achieve food security, but climate shocks are posing big challenges. The agriculture ministry warned this week that the drought is impacting the sowing and growth of new crops.\n\nJun 24 - Some Vietnam coffee farms thrive despite drought, but may not stop espresso price hikes\n\nVietnamese coffee growers have been hit hard this year by the worst drought in nearly a decade, raising concerns of pricier espressos across the world, even as some farmers keep yields healthy with clever countermeasures. Domestic forecasts for next season's harvest in Vietnam, the world's second biggest coffee producer, remain grim.\n\nJun 21 - The duty on the export of sunflower oil from the Russian Federation will be zero again in July ( Interfax )\n\n- The duty on the export of sunflower oil from the Russian Federation will be zero in June. This calculation was presented by the Ministry of Agriculture. Thus, the zero duty will remain for the thirteenth month in a row.\n\n- The duty rate on sunflower meal will decrease by 42.6%, to 901.3 rubles from 1 thousand 544.3 rubles in June.\n\nIndicative prices, based on which the duties were calculated, were: for oil - $773.3 per ton ($773.8 a month ago), for meal - $198.6 ($199.5).\n\nJun 21 - Ukrainian Grain Weekly Report (SPIKE_BROKERS)\n\n- Sold in a week\n\nHarvest 2023\n\n· feed wheat DAP Odessa, Ukraine, Jun-Jul @192$\n\nHarvest 2024\n\n· wheat 11.5pro DAP Odessa, Ukraine, Aug @200$\n\n· feed wheat DAP Odessa, Ukraine, Aug @185$\n\n· Soybean NE-GMO DAP Mon.

Germany, sickle @435€\n\n- Ukraine:\n\n· During the 15 days of June, Ukraine exported: corn - 1.3 million tons, wheat - 0.514 million tons, barley - 38 thousand tons, soybean - 94 thousand tons, rapeseed - 19 thousand tons, sunflower - 2 thousand tons, sunflower oil - 232 thousand tons, soybean oil - 14 thousand tons, cake and meal - 187 thousand tons.\n\n· Total annual exports of main crops as of 15.06 were: corn - 25 million tons (September-June), wheat - 17.5 million tons (July-June), barley - 2.4 million tons (July-June), soybean - 2.7 million tons (September-June), rapeseed - 3.6 million tons (July-June).\n\n- CORN\n\nPrices for old corn continued to decline and were trading at $165-170 delivered to seaports in June-July. At the border, prices also fell to the nominal level of 162-167€ FCA loaded into the euro train for July-August. Indications for a new corn crop have decreased to 165$ CPT port and 162-165€ FCA loaded into the eurotrain at the border. At the same time, the Northern Italian market for a new crop was traded at 212-215€ by trains. Hungarian corn was traded in the direction of Italy at 180€ or with a prize of 15€ to Ukrainian corn on the terms of FCA Chop, which is the difference in logistics and premium for European origin of the crop.\n\n- WHEAT\n\nThe decline in wheat prices is devoid of a fundamental factor - the pressure of proposals from Ukrainian farmers. Over the past week, prices for a new wheat crop have fallen from traders to 10$ per ton solely under the influence of external factors of seasonal lower prices by end buyers, hunting for the cheapest seller. The elimination of long positions or the fixation of profits by traders before the harvest added pressure on futures prices and lower quotations.\n\n- RAPE\n\nPrices for rapeseed are hard to find support on the eve of the harvesting campaign in Europe and Ukraine. The possibility of selling Ukrainian rapeseed in the direction of Asia, Europe and domestic processing in Ukraine creates a fierce competition for culture. The market estimates the total volume of rapeseed sold by the forward at the level of 600-800 thousand tons with delivery from July to January in all directions of exports. At the same time, domestic processing cannot compete with export prices and has to expect a pressure of proposals from mid-July. Players estimate the volume of domestic processing of rapeseed at 1 million tons or below.\n\n- SOYA\n\nSoya continues to actively bargain in the direction of Europe. In the direction of Italy, you can find soybean sales at 440-450€ delivered by trains. The difference between GMO and GMO is up to 10€ per ton.\n\nJun 21 - BP to buy out Bunge's stake in Brazilian biofuels JV in $1.4 bln deal\n\nBP has agreed to buy grain trader Bunge's 50% stake in Brazilian sugar and ethanol joint venture BP Bunge Bioenergia for $1.4 billion in a bet on growing demand for low-carbon biofuels. Following the completion of the deal, expected by end-2024, BP will take full ownership of Bioenergia which has production capacity of around 50,000 barrels a day of ethanol equivalent from sugarcane.\n\nJun 20 - EU re-introduces tariffs on oats from Ukraine after reaching ‘emergency’ levels\n\nThe EU re-introduced tariffs on oats from Ukraine after imports of the product reached the ‘emergency’ level set out in a renewed trade liberalisation scheme. On Tuesday (18 June), the European Commission announced that Ukrainian oats can no longer be exported tariff-free to the EU and will be subject again to the previous tariffs included in the EU’s free trade agreement with the country from 2014 (DCFTA). The duty entered into force the following day (19 June) and will be in place until 5 June 2025.\n\nOats is the first agricultural product from Ukraine that will no longer be exempted from EU import tariffs. The decision was made automatically after the country’s oat exports exceeded the maximum amount for tariff-free trade that was defined under the EU’s recent new trade liberalisation measures with the war-torn country .\n\nThe measures, in place since 5 June, include new “emergency brakes” that automatically re-introduce tariffs if the imports of certain “sensitive” agricultural products – such as poultry, eggs and sugar – exceed the average volume of a reference period from the second half of 2021 to 2023.\n\nThis average for oats was 2,440 tonnes, while imports since the beginning of 2024 are already “above this volume,” the Commission explained in a statement.\n\nThis forced the EU executive to re-introduce the previous tariff-rate quota from the DCFTA set at 4,000 tonnes. However, since imports since the beginning of 2024 also exceeded this volume, the WTO’s most-favoured nations (MFN) duties will now apply until the end of 2024.The DCFTA quota will then be available again from 1 January 2025.\n\nThe EU’s safeguard clauses were introduced in April to address widespread farmer protests in countries neighbouring Ukraine, who criticised cheap imports from the country for lowering their local prices.\n\nAt the end of May, Ukrainian producers also warned that sugar was close to reaching the EU’s safeguard limit and called on their government to end sugar exports to the bloc for this year.\n\nJun 20 - Smaller German wheat and rapeseed crops again forecast for 2024\n\nGermany's 2024 wheat crop will fall 5.5% on the year to 20.34 million metric tons but with recent rain having no major impact on crops, the country's association of farm cooperatives said in its latest harvest estimate on Wednesday. It forecast Germany's 2024 winter rapeseed crop will fall 8.0% to 3.89 million metric tons.\n\nJun 20 - Rains in northern Argentina to allow wheat planting to move forward\n\nRains in the coming days in northern Argentina will allow wheat sowing for 2024/25 to make headway, the Buenos Aires Grains Exchange said on Wednesday. The exchange said that dryness in the north and eastern regions, as well as delayed harvesting of the corn and soy crops, had disrupted planting.\n\nJun 19 - Farmers' financial pain spills from Kansas wheat fields to Main Streets\n\nAs U.S. farm incomes are forecast to plunge in 2024 due to a sharp reversal in commodity crop prices, less government support and high borrowing and labor costs, farmers' economic pain is spreading from the fields to Main Street. Farmers are facing the worst economic situation in over a decade, and small cities are at risk of becoming ghost towns, sources told Reuters.\n\nJun 19 - EU 2023/24 soft wheat exports down 5% but French data incomplete\n\nSoft wheat exports from the European Union since the start of the 2023/24 season last July had reached 29.15 million metric tons by June 16, down 5% from a year earlier, data published by the European Commission showed on Tuesday. EU barley exports totalled 5.59 million tons, down 12% from the corresponding period of 2022/23, the data showed.\n\nJun 19 - The grain market in Russia and in the world (SoveKon)\n\n· U.S. wheat prices continued to decline on Tuesday. The July contract for SRW wheat closed at $5.82/bush ($214/t; -1.6% compared to Monday). Euronext's September wheat contract slipped to €229.00/t ($246/t; -0.5%). The July contract for US corn rose to $4.50/bush ($177/t; +1.4%).\n\n· Soft wheat exports from the EU as of June 16 amounted to 29.2m tons compared to 30.7m tons a year earlier, the European Commission reported. Barley exports totaled 5.6m tons compared to 6.4m tons last year. Analysts of the commission do not have complete data for France, Bulgaria and Ireland.\n\n· Ukrainian grain exports in the first half of June amounted to 2.0 million tons against 2.7 tons for the same period in May, the Ukrainian Grain Association reports. Wheat for June was exported 0.5 million tons against 0.8 million tons a month earlier, maize - 1.3 million tons against 1.7 million tons.\n\n· Shipments of Ukrainian grain through the Romanian port of Constanta from January to May decreased by 44% compared to last year, amounting to 3.5 million tons. This was reported by the agency Reuters, citing a port representative. The agency's interlocutor in the port noted that in 2024, Ukraine relies more heavily on its own ports.\n\n· Monsoon rains in India in June are expected to be below normal, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. The IMD estimates that less than 92% of the long-standing average rainfall will fall over a month.\n\nJun 18 - Russian new harvest wheat export prices decline as bad weather fears subside (IKAR)\n\nRussian wheat export prices for the new harvest have declined significantly from a week ago as concern over the impact of bad weather on the grain harvest has subsided, analysts said. The price of 12.5% protein Russian new crop wheat scheduled free-on-board with delivery in July was $234 per metric ton at the end of last week, $8 lower than the price of this class of old crop wheat a week earlier, according to the IKAR consultancy.\n\nJun 18 - NOPA May US soy crush tops most trade estimates at 183.625 mln bushels\n\nThe U.S. soy crush rebounded in May from a seven-month low the prior month and topped most trade estimates as processors churned through more beans than any previous May on record, according to National Oilseed Processors Association data released on Monday. NOPA members, which account for around 95% of soybeans crushed in the United States, processed 183.625 million bushels of soybeans last month, up 8.4% from an April crush of 169.436 million bushels.\n\nJun 18 - US farmers shun buyers, cling to unsold corn as prices slump\n\nAfter stockpiling crops for much of this season due to low prices, many farmers in the world's largest corn-producing nation continue to shun buyers despite few signs that prices will improve. By September 2025, U.S. corn inventories are expected to reach a six-year high, according to the U.S Agriculture Department.\n\nJun 17 - Ukraine grain production to remain unprofitable in 2024, ministry says\n\nGrain cultivation in Ukraine will remain unprofitable in 2024 owing to the Russian invasion, though losses will be less significant than in 2023, the Ukraine agriculture ministry said on Friday. Ukraine is a major global grain and oilseed grower and exporter, but its harvests and exports have declined since Russia invaded the country in February 2022.\n\nJun 17 - French wheat conditions stabilise but harvest fears persist\n\nCrop conditions for soft wheat in France were steady last week, data from farm office FranceAgriMer showed on Friday, but harvest prospects in the European Union's biggest producer remained poor after a damp growing season. Some 62% of soft wheat was estimated to be in good or excellent condition by June 10, unchanged from a week earlier but down from 85% a year earlier, FranceAgriMer said in a cereal report.\n\nJun 14 - Ukrainian Weekly Agri Report (SPIKE_BROKERS)\n\nSold in a week\n\nHarvest 2023\n\n· corn DAP Odessa, Ukraine, Jun-Jul @182$->180$\n\n· sunflower oil DAP Odessa, Ukraine, Jun-Jul @905$\n\nHarvest 2024\n\n· wheat 11.5pro DAP Odessa, Ukraine, Aug @208$\n\n· wheat 11.5pro DAP Odessa, Ukraine, September @209$->205$\n\n· feed wheat DAP Odessa, Ukraine, Veres @192$\n\n- Ukraine:\n\n· According to the June forecast of WASDE by USDA, in the 2024/25 season Ukraine expects the lowest initial wheat stocks since 2017.\n\n· Wheat exports in the 2024/25 season are predicted by USDA at 13 million tons, which will be the lowest indicator since 2014.\n\n· The 2024/25 corn harvest is projected at 27.7 million tons by USDA, and the export is — 24.5 million tons at initial reserves of 2.9 million tons. These forecasts differ significantly from the expectations of local players in the Ukrainian market, who forecast corn harvest at 25-26 million tons, and export — 20-21 million tons, which will be the lowest indicator since 2017.\n\n- The players' activity in the old corn crop market remains low. Traders are moving to new crop programs of early grain. The old corn crop was traded towards seaports at $176-180 with delivery in June. The western border is nominally traded at €180-185 FCA, loaded into a euro train between July and August. Europe expects to harvest early grains and supply markets with fodder wheat grains, which creates an alternative to fodder corn from Ukraine. The new corn crop was traded in the direction of ports within $176-180 on November-December. The western border was trading corn at €172-177, loaded in the euro train October-December.\n\n- GASC tenders have set price guidelines for the Black Sea region for the new season. In the last tender, Ukrainian wheat was sold at $233.45 FOB with shipment in August. The new wheat crop is actively traded in the direction of ports where 11.5% food wheat could be sold at $205-209 with delivery in August-September. Reducing the discount to $10/ton per feed wheat relative to food confirms traders' expectations for a lower supply of feed grain. The Western border nominally traded wheat with a protein content of 11% at a price of €185-190, loaded in the European train in August-September.\n\n- Demand from processing plants is reduced due to the cleaning and preparation for the rapeseed season. The last prices for sunflower were traded in the range of 19-20 thousand UAH with VAT or $410-430 without VAT, delivered for processing. New crop price indication decreased to 17-18 thousand UAH with VAT or $368-390 without VAT, delivered for processing in September-October.\n\n- Rape prices are frozen in anticipation of pre-season rally or seasonal correction. European logistics is actively traded in September and October in the factories. COCERAL expects rapeseed harvest in Europe in 2024 at 18.5 million tons, which is 1.6 million tons less than last year.\n\nJun 14 - Argentina wheat planting shows fast progress, except in north\n\nWheat planting in Argentina jumped sharply in the last week thanks to dry weather in much of the South American country, the Buenos Aires Grains Exchange reported on Thursday. Argentina is a key wheat exporter and saw its 2024/25 wheat sowing advancing 20.6 percentage points during the last week, bringing the planted area for the cereal to 46.3% of the 6.2 million hectares planned, the BdeC said in its weekly crop report.\n\nJun 14 - Ivory Coast halts cocoa forward sales over crop concerns, CCC sources say\n\nTop cocoa producer Ivory Coast's Coffee and Cocoa Council has halted forward sales of next season's crop at 940,000 metric tons as they await more clarity on expected production, two sources at the sector regulator told Reuters on Thursday. Failed harvests in Ivory Coast and number two grower Ghana have sent global cocoa prices soaring this year.\n\nJun 13 - Ukraine exports 48.4 mln T grain so far 2023/24, ministry says\n\nUkraine's grain exports in the 2023/24 July-June marketing season had risen to 48.4 million metric tons by June 12 from 46.7 million tons as of the same date in 2023, agriculture ministry data showed on Wednesday. The total volume included 1.45 million tons sent abroad since the start of June.\n\nJun 13 - FranceAgriMer raises 2023/24 non-EU wheat export forecast\n\nFarm office FranceAgriMer on Wednesday increased its forecast for French soft wheat exports outside the European Union in 2023/24, leading to lower projected stocks, although these remained at a 19-year high. In its supply and demand outlook, the office pegged French non-EU soft wheat exports at 10.20 million metric tons, up from 10.05 million projected last month, while it trimmed its forecast for exports within the EU to 6.18 million tons from 6.25 million expected in May.\n\nJun 13 - Brazil out of the equation for peanut importers in western Europe\n\nThe European peanut market seems to have woken up to the fact that Brazil had a terrible crop and that there won’t be any relief coming from this origin.\n\nAlex Izmirlian, general manager of US company Alimenta Agri, noted that as a result of this, stocks in western Europe continue to be very low with most of the early shipments from Argentina being accounted for. “That situation should last for several more months. This is keeping the Rotterdam spot market very firm,” he added.\n\nIzmirlian warned that the extent of the crop problems in Brazil is unclear, but this origin is not expected to sell any additional material to western Europe. The crop has issues not only with quantity but, in particular, with quality.\n\nArgentina’s crop is delayed but still in good condition. “It is imperative for the Argentine shellers and for the international market that the weather cooperates until the end of the harvesting,” Izmirlian noted.\n\nHowever, the market should not expect much lower prices, at least not in the short to medium forecast. Thereafter, a lot depends on the new US crop, Izmirlian suggested.\n\nThe Chinese new crop has been planted with expectations ranging from a 0-10% increase.\n\nThe US peanut industry still believes that the US plantings will be much higher than last year.\n\nCash prices available from https://www.commodity3.com/chain/GNDNUT/wld-in-peanuts-edible-quality\n\nJun 13 - Argentina's upcoming wheat harvest could near record (Rosario exch.)\n\nArgentina's upcoming wheat harvest could near the record set in the 2021/22 season, the Rosario grains exchange said on Wednesday, pegging its estimate for 2024/25 at 21 million metric tons. The exchange said that planting of the crop itself could be a record, with an estimated area of 6.92 million hectares.\n\nJun 13 - Drought to hammer Mexico's 2024 corn harvest, government says\n\nA prolonged drought in Mexico is set to again hammer harvests this year, according to government estimates, as adverse weather conditions could push the country to rely on more corn imports from the United States. Mexico's 18-month season should produce some 25.15 million metric tons of corn, according to a report presented by the agricultural ministry on Tuesday, including 21.89 million tons of white corn, used to make key staples such as tortillas.\n\nJun 12 - Paraguay soy exports pick up pace as prices bounce, data show\n\nParaguay's exports of its soybean crop, delayed by low river levels and weak prices earlier in the year, are gaining momentum, shipment data shared with Reuters show, as farmers speed up sales on stronger global demand and rosier values. The landlocked South American nation's shipments of the oilseed hit 1.13 million metric tons in May, up around 34% versus the previous month, the previously unreported data show, making it by far the strongest month of the year so far.\n\nJun 12 - Coceral raises 2024 EU plus UK wheat crop forecast, cuts barley and rapeseed projections\n\nGrain trade association Coceral on Tuesday raised its forecast for this year's soft wheat output in the European Union and Britain by 400,000 metric tons to 134.5 million metric tons, but still expected it to come in 4% below 2023 due to rain damage. In its third forecast for the next harvest, Coceral cut its view for the barley harvest in the bloc + UK in 2024 to 59.9 million tons, down from 61.2 previously but still 10% above last year.\n\nJun 11 - Crisis in Rio Grande do Sul and impacts on agribusiness\n\n- Since the end of April, the sharp rains afflicting Rio Grande do Sul (RS) have caused a disaster in the economic, environmental, and social spheres. At first, the floods were concentrated in the Metropolitan Region of Porto Alegre and Vale do Taquari and some municipalities in the Central Depression. From May 10 onwards, cities on the south shore of Lagoa dos Patos also began to suffer from floods. At the moment, 46 out of the 497 municipalities in Rio Grande do Sul are in a state of public calamity, with another 320 in a state of emergency.\n\n- The impacts of the rains on the agribusiness in Rio Grande do Sul are still being accounted for. Among the areas affected by floods, the Metropolitan Region of Porto Alegre is home to a port and many grain processing industries; the Taquari Valley is among the main pig breeding regions; the Central Depression has a sizable production of soybeans and rice; and the south of Lagoa dos Patos is home to the all-important port of Rio Grande. In other regions, the rains have caused significant damage to the summer crops still to be harvested and are hindering the planting of winter crops. At the moment, StoneX estimates a 13% decrease in the soybean crop and a 15% reduction in the wheat planting area.\n\nJun 11 - Brazil's second-corn harvest at fastest pace in more than a decade (AgRural)\n\nBrazil's second-corn harvest for the 2024 cycle had reached 10.4% of the planted area in the key center-south region as of last Thursday, agribusiness consultancy AgRural said on Monday, its fastest pace in more than a decade. The figure is the highest for the period since at least 2013, when AgRural started its weekly surveys on Brazil's second-corn crop, which represents about 75% of the national production each year.\n\nJun 11 - US corn and soybean crop in best shape since 2018 - Braun\n\nThe U.S. corn and soybean crops are in great shape early in the growing season, and although there is plenty of time for fortune to turn, this year’s harvest is already in good company. The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Monday pegged 72% of U.S. soybeans as being in good or excellent health, in the agency’s first assessment of the season. That was in line with trade expectations and is above the 10-year average for initial soy ratings of 68%.\n\nJun 10 - AUSTRALIA forecasts total summer crops at 4.6Mt (ABARES)\n\n- AUSTRALIA’S summer-crop production is forecast to reach 4.6 million tonnes for 2023-24, according to ABARES June Crop Report released last week.\n\nOverall tonnage for the crop, now in the final stretch of harvest in the eastern states, will remain above average but 11 percent below last season’s highs.\n\nABARES has revised up the total production estimates by 8pc compared to the March Crop Report, following better than expected seasonal conditions during late spring and summer in Queensland and northern New South Wales.\n\n“Falling production reflects an overall fall in planted area more than offsetting higher forecast yields,” the report said.\n\n- ABARES highlighted that harvesting of some summer crops had been delayed by autumn storms and rain across key summer cropping regions.\n\n“This has resulted in a fall in grain and lint quality in some unharvested crops but did not significantly affect the production volumes of most later maturing crops.\n\n“It is likely that higher yields in other areas will more than offset any downgrades caused by wet harvest conditions.”\n\nIn total, Queensland is set to produce 2Mt of summer crops in 2023-24, down by 22pc on 2022-23, but 7pc higher than the March forecast.\n\nNSW production will remain steady at 2.5Mt, an upward revision of 10pc from March and 37pc above the 10-year average to 2022–23.\n\nSorghum\n\n- Although totals will be higher than expected, sorghum production is estimated to fall by 16pc to 2.2Mt in 2023–24.\n\nWhile it is a drop, the figure represents a 10pc upwards revision from March and it now sits 38pc above the 10-year average to 2022–23.\n\nStrong yields supported by above average rainfall and high soil moisture levels pushed up production in Queensland and NSW.\n\nFall Armyworm is reported to have caused localised damage in sorghum crops with later sown crops planted from December onwards were most heavily impacted.\n\nABARES predicts that higher yields in areas unaffected are likely to offset any crop losses caused by Fall Armyworm.\n\n- Queensland is forecast to product 1.5Mt of sorghum, down 17pc on last season, but revised up from March due to a better-than-expected finish.\n\n- NSW will also see a fall in sorghum production of 13pc to 710,000t.\n\nArea planted to sorghum has been revised up from the previous forecast following rainfall in the later planting window that enabled growers to maximise planted area.\n\nWet conditions have significantly restricted field access and delayed harvest in both states, inadvertently hindering the start of winter crop planting.\n\nCotton\n\n- Australia’s cotton production is forecast to fall by 13pc to 1.1Mt in 2023-24 but remain 41pc above the 10-year average to 2022-23.\n\nFalling production reflects an estimated drop in area planted to cotton, which will drop by 16pc to 477,000ha, and more than offset higher aggregate yields.\n\n- Queensland drove the total drop in production, estimated to fall 39pc to 310,000t due to reduced plantings of both dryland and irrigated cotton.\n\nPlantings were heavily impacted by dry conditions in early spring and lower irrigation water availability.\n\nDespite the fall in area, adequate rainfall and suitable temperatures during the growing season boosted yields.\n\n- NSW is expected to harvest more cotton lint than last season, with production estimated to rise by 4pc to 761,000t due to strong yields.\n\nTimely planting of irrigated cotton and high water storages in the southern Murray–Darling Basin have supported an increase in irrigated cotton production across NSW.\n\nBelow average rainfall and soil moisture in September and October led to disruptions in dryland cotton planting.\n\nHowever, above average rainfall in November prompted late planting across the state, leading to higher dryland production than previously anticipated.\n\nRice\n\n- Rice production is estimated to increase 21pc to 607,000t, bucking the trend of other summer crops.\n\nThe result is 10pc higher than the March estimate and was driven by generally favourable growing conditions in southern NSW.\n\nAlongside production, the total planted area to rice, forecast at 57,000ha, was also up on the March figures, by 2000ha, and higher than the 2022-23 total by 7,000ha.\n\nCorn\n\n- Australia’s corn production is set to drop about 8pc to 379,000t, with a reduction in NSW and Queensland yields hitting overall tonnage.\n\nHigh levels of Fall Armyworm drove cuts to production of 44,000t for both states despite the area planted to corn remaining stable in Queensland and falling by only 1000ha in NSW.\n\n- Victoria looks set to produce a likely record corn crop at 90,000t from 8000ha, 33pc above last season and 36pc above the five-year average.\n\nThis result puts Victoria’s corn production on par with Queensland, a more established summer crop growing region.\n\n- Western Australia is forecast to see a drop in production, down about 24pc to 23,400t.\n\nJun 10 - Australia exports 24,136t chickpeas, 116,768t lentils in April : Liz Wells\n\nAUSTRALIA exported 24,136 tonnes of chickpeas and 116,768t of lentils in April, according to the latest data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\n\n- Bangladesh was the top destination for both pulses in April, taking 9176t of chickpeas and 40,053t of lentils.\n\n- The United Arab Emirates on 6670t and Nepal on 4114t were the second and third-largest destinations for chickpeas shipped in April.\n\n- India on 25,897t and UAE on 17,719t were the second and third-largest destinations for lentils shipped in April.\n\nVolume for both commodities fell sharply over April, chickpeas by 53 percent from the March total of 50,932t and lentils by 34pc from 177,662t exported in March.\n\n- India removed its tariffs on Australian chickpeas early last month, and bulk cargoes arrived in India ahead of the widely anticipated announcement.\n\n- Shipping stems indicate one combination cargo of Australian chickpeas and lentils will discharge in India next month to clear out bulk current-crop stocks in Queensland.\n\nHowever, the container market to India is cleaning out smaller parcels in Qld and New South Wales in what looks like being a bumper year for chickpea production in both states, as outlined last week by ABARES in its quarterly Australian Crop Report.\n\nJun 10 - Funds place fresh short bets on CBOT corn, soy as supply fears ease - Braun\n\nChicago grain and oilseed futures declined sharply after the U.S. Memorial Day holiday with speculators rejuvenating bearish sentiment, an about-face from last month’s short-covering streak.\n\nJun 07 - China May soybean imports fall 15% on year, customs data shows\n\nChina imported 10.22 million metric tons of soybeans in May, customs data showed, below the levels of a year ago but more than April's shipment volumes, as good crush margins supported demand for cheaper Brazilian beans. May imports by the world's largest buyer of the oilseed were down 15% from a record 12.02 million tons in May 2023, and fell short of expected arrivals of 11-12 million tons.\n\nJun 07 - Cows infected with bird flu have died in five US states\n\nDairy cows infected with avian flu in five U.S. states have died or been slaughtered by farmers because they did not recover, state officials and academics told Reuters. Reports of the deaths suggest the bird flu outbreak in cows could take a greater economic toll in the farm belt than initially thought.\n\nJun 07 - Ukrainian Weekly Agri Report (SPIKE_BROKERS)\n\nSold in a week\n\nHarvest 2023\n\n· corn DAP Odessa, Ukraine, Jun @182$\n\n· DAP corn Mon. Italy (car), Jun-Jul @230€\n\nHarvest 2024\n\n· soybean NE-GMO 33pro DAP w. border of Ukraine, heather-yellow @ ZSX24-...c/bu\n\n- Ukraine:\n\n· As of 06.06, only 13083 thousand hectares of grain, legumes and technical crops were sown in Ukraine, compared to 12793 thousand hectares on the same date last year.\n\n· The sowing rate of the main crops as of 06.06 is as follows: corn - 3927 thousand hectares (100%), sunflower - 5189 thousand hectares (100%), soybeans - 2032 thousand hectares (102%).\n\n· The structure of agricultural exports in May was: corn - 3.550 million tons, wheat - 1.645 million tons, barley - 208 thousand tons, soybeans - 106 thousand tons, rape - 75 thousand tons, sunflower - 12 thousand tons, sunflower oil - 624 thousand tons, soybean oil - 38 thousand tons, cake and meal - 452 thousand tons.\n\n- Ukraine exports more than 3 million tons of corn for the third month in a row. Total exports from September 2023 to May 2024 amounted to 23.7 million tons, which leaves the potential for export of about 3 million tons for the period until September. The limited supply of the old crop on the local market is balanced with a reduced demand from traders who are reoriented to the new crop programs. Prices for corn shipped to sea ports in June extended the decline and traded below $180. The western border was traded between €185 and 190 for a European train load in July and August. New harvests towards seaports were trading in the range of $178-182 with deliveries October-December. The western border bought corn new crop in the range of €174-176 for loading in the European train in October-December.\n\n- Market players waiting for a new wheat crop. Weather conditions have a positive effect on the likelihood of increasing the proportion of food wheat relative to forage. The new crop is actively traded towards seaports within $200-205 for feed wheat and $210-215 for food, depending on the delivery period and quality. The western border is actively trading food wheat with protein 11% at a price of €185-190, and feed wheat — €175-180 FCA per load in the European train.\n\n- Processing plants in search of old crop sunflower residues at prices within 20 thousand UAH. The new sunflower crop is traded at the price level of the old crop with delivery September-October.\n\n- European market players predict a decline in rapeseed production in Europe to 18 million tons against previous estimates at 19 million tons. At the same time, the approach of the new crop caused the rapeseed quotations on the MATIF exchange to decrease by €30 per ton compared to the previous week.\n\n- Soybeans prices have come under pressure from South America's global offer and the good prospects of soybeans in the US.\n\nJun 06 - Russia's Sovecon cuts 2024 wheat crop forecast again to 80.7 mln tons\n\nRussia's Sovecon agricultural consultancy on Wednesday reduced its forecast for the country's wheat crop this year to 80.7 million metric tons (mmt) from its previous forecast of 82.1 million, the latest in a series of weather-related downgrades. \"This downward revision is primarily due to deteriorating crop conditions and reduced yield potential following hot and dry weather after May frosts,\" Sovecon said.\n\nJun 06 - China's Sinograin to expand wheat stockpiles as global supplies fall\n\nChina will expand its wheat stockpile by increasing buying from domestic producers as the world's top producer and consumer of the staple grain looks to secure supply amid recent weather-related damage to global production. Frost has hit crops in No.1 exporter Russia and both dryness and excessive rains have threatened yields in the European Union, igniting worries about lower global supplies in the second half of 2024, a key production and marketing period.\n\nJun 05 - US farmers opt for soy to limit losses as all crop prices slump\n\nPlanting more soy at a time of sputtering demand from importers and domestic processors will only serve to drive prices lower, further swell historically large global supplies and erode U.S. farm incomes already poised for the steepest annual drop ever in dollar terms. But Midwest farmers' other main options - seeding more corn or leaving fields fallow - could have resulted in even wider losses.\n\nJun 05 - Soybean losses from floods in southern Brazil seen at 2.7 million tons\n\nSoybean losses related to recent floods in Brazil's southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul were estimated at 2.71 million metric tons, crop agency Emater said on Tuesday, in line with private forecasts ranging from 2.8 million to 3 million tons. Emater said in a statement it expects Rio Grande do Sul's soybean crop to reach 19.53 million tons this season, down from the 22.24 million tons forecast previously, pegging soy yields at 2,923 kilograms per hectare in the state.\n\nJun 04 - Russia may declare emergency due to frost impact on crops, farm minister says\n\nRussia may declare a nationwide emergency by the end of this week due to frosts that have damaged crops, Agriculture Minister Oksana Lut was quoted as saying on Monday. State news agency RIA quoted Lut as saying she hoped the measure would be declared, paving the way for insurance claims, following a meeting of a committee of the emergencies ministry.\n\nJun 04 - Australia raises wheat harvest estimate but cuts canola\n\nThe Australian government said on the country would harvest around 700,000 metric tons more wheat than it previously thought but slashed its forecast for canola production after some areas suffered long periods of low rainfall. Australia is a major agricultural exporter and the size of its harvests impacts global supply.\n\nJun 03 - Bigger planted area should boost Australia's wheat harvest, Rabobank says\n\nAustralia's 2024/25 wheat harvest should be slightly bigger than last year's after an increase in planted area, but barley and canola output will likely fall, analysts at Rabobank said on Monday. Higher wheat production would add to global supply at a time when crop losses in Russia have pushed benchmark Chicago wheat futures to 10-month highs.\n\nJun 03 - China takes nascent"
