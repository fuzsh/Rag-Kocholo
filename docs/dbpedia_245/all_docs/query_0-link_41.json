Surface staffed and automatic weather station observations--S. Colwell, 1. M. Keller, M. A. Lazzara, A. Setzer, and R. L. Fogt\n\nThe circulation anomalies described in section 6b are discussed here in terms of observations at staffed and automatic weather stations (AWS). A map of key locations described in this section and throughout the chapter is displayed in Fig. 6.4. Climate data from three staffed stations (Bellingshausen on the Antarctic Peninsula, Casey in East Antarctica, and McMurdo on the Ross Ice Shelf) and two AWSs (Gill on the Ross Ice Shelf and Byrd in West Antarctica) that depict regional conditions are displayed in Fig. 6.5a-e. To better understand the statistical significance of records and anomalies discussed in this section, references can be made to the spatial anomaly plots in Fig. 6.3 (the shading indicates the number of standard deviations the anomalies are from the mean).\n\nAt the north of the Antarctic Peninsula, a record low (since observations began in 1969) monthly mean temperature of -0.1[degrees]C was observed at Bellingshausen in February (anomaly shown in Fig. 6.5a); record-high wind speeds were recorded at Bellingshausen in November, 1.82 m [s.sup.-1] above the mean (Bellingshausen meteorological data starts in 1968). Monthly mean temperatures at Rothera Station on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula were similar to their respective 1981-2010 averages, with temperatures slightly below average during the summer months and slightly above average during the winter months. The lower-than-average temperatures at the northern Antarctic Peninsula continue a recent trend of cooling in this region, as reflected in Fig. 6.5f, where austral summer temperature changes over 1976-2013 are shown for four stations with the longest and most complete records. While many stations at the northern Antarctic Peninsula observed a warming trend in the early part of their records, there has been a statistically significant cooling of p < 0.10 at all but Faraday since 1995 (dashed lines in Fig. 6.5f; the trends range from -0.03[degrees]C [decade.sup.-1] at Faraday to -0.73[degrees]C [decade.sup.-1] at Bellingshausen and Marambio during December-February 1995/96-2013/14). Despite the short period of these recent negative trends, they do indicate a weakening of the positive trends over the last 20 years (see also Colwell et al. 2014; McGrath and Steffen 2012).\n\nIn the nearby Weddell Sea region (not shown), the monthly mean temperatures at Halley and Neumayer stations were near-average year-round with two exceptions: 1) April at Neumayer, where the monthly mean temperature of -22.0[degrees]C tied the record low previously set in April 2007; and 2) in early August at Halley, where a new daily extreme minimum temperature of-55.4[degrees]C was recorded.\n\nAround the coast of East Antarctica, all of the Australian stations (Mawson, Davis, Casey) had some months with temperatures above and below average, with Casey (Fig. 6.5b) and Mawson showing similar differences from the long-term mean. All three stations observed record or near-record high monthly mean temperature values for November (Casey -3.7[degrees]C; Davis -2.5[degrees]C; Mawson -4.0[degrees]C). Casey experienced high winds in September with gusts of up to 64 m [s.sup.-1] recorded on one day, leading to a new record high monthly September wind speed (Fig. 6.5b).\n\nDuring 2014, much of the interior of the Antarctic continent started out with below-average temperatures during austral summer, followed by above-average temperatures during austral fall through spring, as seen in Fig. 6.3. At Amundsen Scott Station, for example, lower-than-average monthly mean temperatures were recorded during February and March, followed by higher-than-average temperatures during April, May, and June. Dome C II in East Antarctica had lower-than-average temperature, pressure, and wind speed for most of the year, especially in June, July, and August.\n\nMany records were reported throughout the year for the Ross Ice Shelf and West Antarctica (Fig. 6.5c-e). Due to the circulation anomalies (discussed in section 6b), the Ross Ice Shelf and vicinity saw many extremes recorded in August and September (Fig. 6.3f). Record high monthly mean temperatures were observed in August at Gill (+11.6[degrees]C above the mean; Fig. 6.5d), a tied record high at Possession Island (-16.2[degrees]C, +4.5[degrees]C above the 1993-2013 mean for this station), and near-record temperatures at Marble Point (+6.1[degrees]C above the mean) and Byrd (+7.2[degrees]C above the mean). In September, record high monthly temperatures were reported at McMurdo (+6.2[degrees]C above the mean; Fig. 6.5c), Gill (+8.6[degrees]C above the mean; Fig. 6.5d), Marble Point (+6.9[degrees]C above the mean), and Byrd (+9.3[degrees]C above the mean; Fig. 6.5e). Many of these anomalies in August and September were more than 2 standard deviations above the long-term mean (Fig. 6.3f). Record low pressure and record high wind speed for August were also observed at Gill (-12.1 hPa below the mean and +3.2 m [s.sup.-1] above the mean, respectively; Fig. 6.5d). In November and December, lower-than-average temperatures were observed at Byrd and Gill (Fig. 6.5d,e), which are partially reflected in the negative temperature anomalies across eastern West Antarctica in Fig. 6.3h (although not over the Ross Ice Shelf when averaged from October to December). Record temperatures for Byrd were 4.5[degrees]C and 4.1[degrees]C below the mean for November and December, respectively. For Gill, near-record and record temperatures were 2.7[degrees]C and 2.1[degrees]C below the mean in November and December, respectively.\n\nOther months also set records for the Ross Ice Shelf area and West Antarctica. The highest January mean temperature was reported at Possession Island (+2.0[degrees]C above the mean) along with a near record for Marble Point (+2.2[degrees]C above the mean). Additional records were set at Byrd for high mean wind speed during January (2.0 m [s.sup.-1] above the mean) and a tie for May (2.2 m [s.sup.-1] above the mean; Fig. 6.5e). Gill also tied record high wind speeds for February and March, (0.9 and 1.0 m [s.sup.-1] above the mean, respectively; Fig. 6.5d). In terms of pressure, in addition to the record lowest pressure observed at Gill in August (as mentioned above), record low pressure was also observed at Byrd in April 2014 (10.7 hPa below the mean), with well-below-average pressure also reported for June and July.\n\nd. Net precipitation (P-E)--D. H. Bromwich and S.-H. Wang\n\nPrecipitation minus evaporation/sublimation (P-E) closely approximates the surface mass balance over Antarctica, except for the steep coastal slopes (e.g., Bromwich et al. 2011; Lenaerts and van den Broeke 2012). Precipitation variability is the dominant term for P-E changes at regional and larger scales over the Antarctic continent. Precipitation and evaporation/sublimation fields from ERA-Interim (Dee et al. 2011a) were examined to assess Antarctic net precipitation (P-E) behavior for 2014.\n\nFigure 6.6 (a-d) shows the ERA-Interim 2014 and 2013 annual anomalies of P-E and mean sea level pressure (MSLP) departures from the 1981-2010 average. In general, the magnitude of the annual P-E anomalies (Fig. 6.6a,b) reflect the steep gradients between low annual snow accumulations within the continental interior to much larger annual accumulations near the Antarctic coastal regions. Compared to the 2013 Japanese reanalysis (JRA) P-E result from Bromwich and Wang (2014), both ERA-Interim and JRA show quantitative similarity at higher latitudes (poleward of 60[degrees]S). However, JRA has excessively high positive anomalies north of 60[degrees]S. Regardless, caution should be exercised when examining the exact magnitudes of precipitation from global reanalyses in the high southern latitudes (Nicolas and Bromwich 2011); the main goal here is to demonstrate how these anomalies are qualitatively tied to changes in the atmospheric circulation.\n\nFrom ERA-Interim, the negative P-E anomalies south of 60[degrees]S between 60[degrees] and 150[degrees]W in 2013 have been replaced by positive anomalies in 2014, especially along the Amundsen Sea coast. The observed negative anomalies over the Ross Sea have switched to weak positive ones. The annual P-E anomaly triplet (negative-near-average-negative) between Wilkes Land and Victoria Land (between 90[degrees] and 170[degrees]E) present in 2013 is nearly all negative in 2014. The P-E anomalies near the Amery Ice Shelf (between 50[degrees] and 80[degrees]E) switch from positive (in 2013) to negative (in 2014). The positive P-E anomaly center over the Weddell Sea in 2013 has been replaced by a negative anomaly in 2014. Both sides of the Antarctic Peninsula have opposite anomaly patterns to 2013, with negative (positive) anomalies along east (west) side of the peninsula in 2014.\n\nThese annual P-E anomaly features are generally consistent with the mean atmospheric circulation implied by the MSLP anomalies (Fig. 6.6c,d). In 2014, the annual MSLP anomalies surrounding Antarctica are generally more spatially uniform than in 2013 (due perhaps to the large variability in the location of the patterns during the year, as discussed in section 6b and in Fig. 6.3). The large negative anomaly center in 2013 over the Drake Passage and the Bellingshausen Sea (between 45[degrees] and 120[degrees]W) is weaker and shifted to the Amundsen and Ross Seas in 2014. The atmospheric circulation in 2014 produced stronger offshore flow (less precipitation) over Victoria Land, and stronger inflow (more precipitation) over West Antarctica between 60[degrees] and 150[degrees]W (Fig. 6.6a), from an annual mean standpoint. A positive MSLP anomaly center observed along the Queen Mary Coast (between 85[degrees] and 105[degrees]E) during 2013 was not present in 2014. Instead there is a strong negative anomaly center in the southern Indian Ocean (near 105[degrees]E) and weak positive anomalies along the coast of East Antarctica. The 2014 circulation pattern in this area resulted in less precipitation (greater negative P-E anomaly) in the coastal region between 60[degrees] and 180[degrees]E (than during 2013). The positive MSLP anomaly over the coast of Dronning Maud Land (from 15[degrees]W to 30[degrees]E) in 2013 has shifted to the southwest and strengthened in 2014. This resulted in enhanced blocking and less inflow, producing lower precipitation anomalies in the Weddell Sea region in 2014.\n\nEarlier studies show that almost half of the moisture transport into Antarctica occurs in the West Antarctic sector and experiences large interannual variability associated with ENSO (e.g., Bromwich et al. 2004) and SAM events (e.g., Fogt et al. 2011). As the seasons progressed from 2013 to 2014, the negative MSLP anomalies over the Ross Sea expanded into the Bellingshausen Sea and disappeared in spring of 2014 (see Fig. 6.3g). These anomaly features are consistent with a simultaneous weakening of La Niiia and strengthening of SAM (from more negative to more positive phases). Figure 6.6e shows the time series of monthly average total P-E over Marie Byrd Land-Ross Ice Shelf (75[degrees]-90[degrees]S, 120[degrees]W-180[degrees]) and the monthly Southern Oscillation (SOI) and SAM indices (with 12-month running means). Qualitatively, it is clear that SOI and SAM are positively correlated, but are negatively correlated with P-E in most months from 2010 to mid-2011. From then on the SOI is negatively correlated with the SAM into 2014. During 2013 into 2014, weak ENSO events prevailed in the tropical Pacific Ocean, and as such the SOI was near zero during that period. Thus, the wind patterns associated with positive SAM phases become the dominant factor modulating precipitation into the West Antarctic sector, especially during the second half of 2014.\n\ne. 2013/14 seasonal melt extent and duration--L Wang, H. Liu, S. Wang, and S. Shu\n\nSeasonal surface melt on the Antarctic continent during 2013/14 has been estimated by using the daily measurements of microwave brightness temperature data acquired by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F17 satellite carrying the Special Sensor Microwave-Imager/ Sounder (SSMIS). The data are provided by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in the level-3 Equal-Area Scalable Earth-Grid (EASE-Grid) format (Armstrong et al. 1994). The time series of daily brightness temperature records were processed using a wavelet transform-based edge detection method (Liu et al. 2005). The algorithm delineates each melt event in the time series by tracking its onset and end dates. The onset day of the first melt event is recorded as the start day of the melt season (Fig. 6.7a). Likewise, the end day of the last melt event is recorded as the end day of the melt season (Fig. 6.7b). The melt duration is the total number of melting days during the defined melt season. Melt intensity is indicated by two different indices: melt extent and melt index (Zwally and Fiegles 1994; Liu et al. 2006). The anomaly map (Fig. 6.7c) was created by referencing the mean melt intensity data acquired from the satellites during 1981-2010. Melt extent ([km.sup.2]) is the total area that experienced surface melt for at least one day. Melt index (day x [km.sup.2]) is the accumulated number of melt days over the Antarctic continent.\n\nThis year's melt can be characterized by its extensive melt extent and an anomalously long melt season around most of coastal Antarctica except in the peninsula and Abbot areas where both positive and negative melt duration anomalies were observed (Fig. 6.7). Areas with intensive melt (>45 day duration) include areas of the Larsen and Wilkins ice shelves along the Antarctic Peninsula, the West and Shackleton ice shelves, and Wilkes Land in coastal East Antarctica. Areas with moderate intensity of melt (14-45 day duration) include much of coastal Queen Maud Land and the Abbot and Amery ice shelves; short-term melt (<14 day duration) occurred on the coast of Marie Byrd Land and portions of Queen Maud Land near the Filchner Ice Shelf. Although the melt duration anomaly was negative in most areas of the Antarctic Peninsula and Wilkins Ice Shelf (Fig. 6.7c) consistent with cooler than normal air temperature (see Fig. 6.3b), an anomalously early melt event (around 1 October 2013) was observed in these areas (Fig. 6.7a). This melt event only lasted for less than a week however (Fig. 6.7d). Positive melt anomalies can be observed in other regions. The major melt event (Fig. 6.7d) started at the end of November 2013. Melt area reached its peak on 4 January 2014 and the major melt season ended on 6 February 2014. Several minor melt events occurred afterwards and some melt events extended into late April (Fig. 6.7d). These melt events occurred on the Wilkins Ice Shelf (Fig. 6.7b).\n\nOverall, surface melt on the Antarctic continent during the austral summer of 2013/14 was about 25% less in its extent (1043 750 [km.sup.2]; Fig 6.8) compared to 2012/13 (1 384375 [km.sup.2]; Wang et al. 2014). The melt index, a measure of the intensity of melting, was also much lower in 2013/14 (39093125 day x [km.sup.2]) compared to the 2012/13 melt season (51 335 000 day x [km.sup.2]). In contrast, the 2013/14 melt extent and index numbers were almost equivalent to those observed during austral summer 2010/11 (1 069 375 [km.sup.2] and 40 280 625 day x [km.sup.2] respectively). Figure 6.8 shows a non-significant (p = 0.0892) negative trend (288 900 day x [km.sup.2] [yr.sup.1]) in melt extent since 1978, highlighted by the record-low melt season observed during austral summer 2008/09. The negative trend is consistent with previous reports (Liu et al. 2006; Tedesco 2009a,b).\n\nSIDEBAR 6.1: WAIS-TING AWAY? THE PERILOUS STATE OF THE WEST ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET--R. B. ALLEY\n\nAccelerating mass loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is of special concern. New work suggests that the full distribution of possible behaviors includes faster sea level rise than usually was previously considered, although with large uncertainties.\n\nGlaciers and ice sheets generally shrink with warming, contributing to sea level rise, despite the usual increase in precipitation from warmer air supplying more water vapor (for a longer review, refer to Alley et al. 2015, in press). Mountain glaciers contain only ~0.4 m of sea level equivalent (SLE; Vaughan et al. 2013) and models indicate that shrinkage of the Greenland Ice Sheet (~7 m SLE) will have a multicentennial response time even for large warming (Applegate et al. 2014), whereas the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (>50 m SLE) is less sensitive to initial atmospheric warming than the other ice masses. Large, abrupt sea level rise remains possible from the WAIS (~3.3 m SLE in marine portions; NRC 2013).\n\nMost West Antarctic ice discharges across grounding lines into floating-but-attached ice shelves, which lose mass by basal melting and iceberg calving. Ice thinning at the grounding line causes it to migrate inland, but the bed generally deepens inland, allowing faster ice spreading, further thinning, and potentially unstable retreat. The most important stabilizer is friction between ice shelves and embayment sides or local sea-floor highs. Meltwater wedging from surface warming can disintegrate an ice shelf in weeks (e.g., Rott et al. 1996) and warmer waters typically increase sub-ice-shelf melting by order 10 m [yr.sup.-1] [degrees][C.sup.-1] (e.g., Rignot and Jacobs 2002), with 1[degrees]C warming or less sufficient to largely or completely remove many ice shelves.\n\nRecently, ocean warming plus changing winds and, therefore, ocean circulation from some combination of the ozone hole, warming due to greenhouse gas increases, and natural variability (Schmidtko et al. 2014) have increased melting beneath the Amundsen Sea ice shelves facing the Pacific Ocean, causing ice-flow acceleration and thinning that dominate Antarctic mass loss (e.g., Sutterly et al. 2014). Some but not all model results suggest that the threshold for irreversible but probably delayed retreat has already been crossed (Joughin et al. 2014; Parizeket al. 2013).\n\nThe paleoclimatic record in and around the ice sheet, and the far-field record of sea level, suggest but do not prove that the ice sheet shrank and likely disappeared one or more times within the last million years, for reasons including response to the rather small additional forcing of the last interglacial (Alley et al. 2015, in press). The far-field record of sea level indicators such as the distribution of well-dated marine deposits now above sea level (e.g., O'Leary et al. 2013), allows inferred deglaciation of West Antarctica to have required centuries or longer, but does not rule out ice loss over shorter times.\n\nThe rate of any future \"collapse\" may depend on the ice cliff dynamics of a \"tidewater\" glacier. When terminating on land, glaciers typically taper to a thin edge. When terminating in water, for example, a tidewater glacier, the glacier front is a cliff This is a result of an inherent instability caused by any preferential retreat of the above-waterline or below-waterline section of the glacier cliff face. With preferential retreat of the subaerial portion, the force of floatation on the subaqueous cliff causes a new fracture to form, returning the glacier front to a vertical; the same Is true if the subaqueous section temporarily retreats faster. (Preferential melting at the water line increases the imbalance both above and below.) Subaerial ice cliffs (see Fig. SB6.1 for an example) can be stable up to a maximum height that likely is ~100 m (e.g., Hanson and Hooke 2003; Bassis and Walker 2012), near the greatest cliff height now observed. Retreat of shorter cliffs following ice-shelf loss is delayed, limiting the rate of sea level rise, because further iceberg calving does not occur until normal \"viscous\" flow processes reduce the Ice-front thickness close to flotation (Joughin et al. 2008).\n\nIf current climate and cryosphere trends continue in the WAIS sector, and a strong stabilizing ice shelf does not reform, sufficient retreat along Thwaites Glacier in the Amundsen Sea drainage should produce an ice cliff much higher than the estimated ~100 m maximum. If melting or drift can rapidly remove ice supplied to the ocean, brittle cliff failure without prior thinning to flotation might cause rapid ice-sheet shrinkage. Adding a parameterization for this process to a comprehensive ice-sheet model shifted ice sheet loss to a subcentury time scale after sufficient warmth and retreat were achieved (Pollard et al. 2015).\n\nThese considerations do not mean that \"catastrophic\" retreat (meters of sea level rise in decades) is inevitable, nor do they imply that any catastrophic retreat must start soon. They do however highlight important improvements needed in modeling and observations, and demonstrate that accurate worst-case scenarios for sea level rise are likely to exhibit shorter time scales than indicated by much prior work.\n\nf. Southern Ocean--n. P. Meredith, M. Mazloff, J.-B. Sallee, L. Newman, A. Wahlin, M. J. M. Williams, A. C. Naveira Garabato, S. Swart, P. Monteiro, M. M. Mata, and S. Schmidtko\n\nThe Southern Ocean (oceans poleward of 60[degrees]S) exerts a disproportionately strong influence on global climate, so determining its changing state is of key importance in understanding the planetary-scale system (Meredith et al. 2013). This is a consequence of the connectedness of the Southern Ocean, which links the other major ocean basins and is a site of strong lateral fluxes of climatically important tracers (Lumpkin and Speer 2007). It is also a consequence of processes occurring within the Southern Ocean, including the vigorous overturning circulation that leads to the formation of new water masses (Marshall and Speer 2012), and to the strong exchange of carbon, heat, and other climatically relevant properties at the ocean surface (Sallee at al. 2012). However, determining the state of the Southern Ocean in a given year is even more problematic than for other ocean basins, due to the paucity of observations (see Sidebar 6.2). Nonetheless, using the limited data available, some key aspects of the state of the Southern Ocean in 2014 can be ascertained.\n\n1) SURFACE TEMPERATURE AND CIRCULATION\n\nSea surface temperature (SST) is examined here for the interval June 2002-December 2014. Temporal SST variability is dominated by the seasonal cycle, which explains ~30% of the variance in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and >60% in its flanks, but which is far less significant in the polar gyres (regions of cyclonic oceanic circulation). After removal of the seasonal cycle, the mean (de-seasonalized) 2014 SST is compared with the long-term mean (Fig. 6.9a). The most noticeable signals are higher-than-average SST in the South Pacific Ocean, but lower-than-average SST just east and west of Drake Passage during 2014, consistent with the annual mean low-pressure anomaly in the Amundsen Sea (Fig. 6.6c).\n\nSurface circulation is assessed here using satellite altimeter-derived sea surface height (SSH) measurements for the period 1993-2014. The mean 2014 SSH is compared to the long-term mean for the previous years (Fig. 6.9b), after removal of a linear trend. This ~3 mm [yr.sup.-1] trend (Fig. 6.9c,d) is the dominant SSH signal, explaining -10% of the variance over much of the region and >50% in the southwest Pacific Ocean. In 2014, the residual SSH was generally higher than previous years, thereby suggesting an acceleration of the trend. The anomalously high SST and SSH in the South Pacific Ocean in 2014 suggest steric heating is partly responsible. This is not the case for the polar gyres. Stronger SSH anomalies north of the ACC compared to the south lead to increased sea level slope across the ACC, suggesting stronger-than-usual circumpolar flow in 2014. By contrast, the southwest Indian Ocean shows an opposite anomaly in slope, suggesting a weaker Agulhas retroflection.\n\n2) UPPER-OCEAN STRATIFICATION\n\nChanges in the mixed-layer depth (MLD) have significant implications for both physical and biogeochemical processes occurring in the ocean and the overlying atmosphere. Intermediate waters subducted in the Southern Ocean ventilate the thermocline of the Southern Hemisphere subtropical gyres and contribute to global budgets of heat, fresh water, nutrients, and carbon, while anomalies in MLD modulate the exchange of oxygen, heat, and carbon between the ocean and the atmosphere (e.g., Lovenduski and Gruber 2005; Sarmiento et al. 2004).\n\nThe Argo Float Program now provides >10 years of temperature and salinity profiles, allowing the computation of robust climatologies of MLD for the majority of the Southern Ocean at submonthly time scales (e.g.. Fig. 6.9e). Deep mixed layers develop directly north of the ACC, which lead to ventilation and formation of mode and intermediate water. Deriving regional anomalies from the seasonal MLD cycle, zonal asymmetry is observed in 2014 (Fig. 6.9f): deepening of the deep mixed-layer zone in the Indian Ocean (50[degrees]-130[degrees]E) and eastern Pacific Ocean (60[degrees]-80[degrees]W) sectors, and shoaling in the western Pacific Ocean (120[degrees]-170[degrees]W). The anomalies are significant (up to several hundred meters) and have consistent patterns over extensive regions, suggesting a common large-scale forcing. While the largest anomalies are found in winter (when the surface ocean is less stratified), the spatial pattern is consistent over the entire period of the year (not shown). Similar patterns have been attributed as a response to wind changes during a positive SAM phase, via air-sea heat flux anomalies. This would be consistent with the SAM phase being generally positive for 2014 (i.e., 8 of 12 months showed a positive index; see Fig. 6.2). The observed 2014 mixed-layer anomaly is likely to have large impact on the propagation of climate signal in the ocean interior, as well as in water-mass formation.\n\nSIDEBAR 6.2: THE SOUTHERN OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM (SOOS)--M. P. MEREDITH, M. MAZLOFF, J.-B. SALLEE, L. NEWMAN, A. WAHLIN, M. J. M. WILLIAMS, A. C. N. GARABATO, S. SWART, P. MONTEIRO, M. M. MATA, AND S. SCHMIDTKO\n\nThe Southern Ocean is integral to the operation of the Earth system, strongly influencing global climate and planetary-scale biogeochemical cycles through its central role in driving ocean circulation, global biological productivity, and uptake of atmospheric carbon (Fig. SB6.2). Yet the ability to understand the evolving state of the Southern Ocean and to detect changes with an acceptable degree of certainty is severely limited by the paucity of observations. A number of sensor technologies, such as Argo floats, satellite remote sensing, and the tagging of marine mammals provide data in near-real time with wide-area coverage, and can be used to make some deductions on the current state of the Southern Ocean. However, these data streams are the exception, with most observations being collected through short-term, regionally-specific projects that have data delivery delays of months to years.\n\nThe Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS; www.soos.aq) was developed from the community-driven need for sustained and integrated delivery of observational data that are fundamental to the understanding of dynamics and change in Southern Ocean systems. The SOOS mission is to facilitate, internationally, the collection and delivery of essential observations on dynamics and change of Southern Ocean systems to all stakeholders (researchers, governments, industries), through the design, promotion, and implementation of cost-effective observation and data delivery systems.\n\nSOOS has identified four key goals necessary for achieving its mission:\n\n1) A coordinated, integrated, efficient, and sustained international program to deliver time series of observations of essential elements of Southern Ocean systems;\n\n2) Regional implementation of the observing systems to achieve circumpolar coverage of the Southern Ocean;\n\n3) Facilitation and promotion of activities to improve observing Southern Ocean systems, through inter national coordination and technological research and development, including the affiliation of projects and programs with this work;\n\n4) Efficient and internationally integrated data management systems to enable stakeholders to access observations and synthesis products on the dynamics and change of Southern Ocean systems.\n\nEven if the current level of investment by the nations involved in Southern Ocean research is maintained, the logistical demands and costs associated with traditional methods of collecting observations (e.g., from research vessels) will likely prohibit collection at the spatial and temporal resolutions required. The long-term solution is progressively greater automation of data collection, with much greater use of technologies that can be operated remotely or completely autonomously. Aligned with a data management system that delivers the data in real time and a cyberinfrastructure system that enables the implementation of an effective adaptive sampling strategy, SOOS will deliver the observations and products required to determine the state of the Southern Ocean on an ongoing basis, in order to detect, attribute, and mitigate change.\n\nSOOS is an initiative of the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR).\n\n3) SHELF WATERS\n\nThe shelf regions of Antarctica can be broadly categorized into \"warm\" sectors (including the Amundsen-Bellingshausen-Antarctic Peninsula region, where Circumpolar Deep Water from the ACC floods the shelf), and \"cold\" sectors, including the Weddell and Ross Seas where significant quantities of Antarctic Bottom Water form. The shelf regions are particularly poorly observed, limiting the ability to provide an assessment of their climatic state in 2014 to just a few regions with currently active observational programs.\n\nA time series of hydrographic parameters and isotope tracer measurements from the western Antarctic Peninsula region showed upper-layer properties that were anomalously fresh in summer (down to 32.7), due to the injection of approximately twice the normal levels of sea ice melt. Observations from seal-mounted sensors in the southwestern Ross Sea showed winter (March-September) temperatures and salinities that were not significantly different from previous seal observations (2010-12). From the Amundsen Sea, a combination of currently active moorings (Wahlin et al. 2013; Assmann et al. 2013) and hydrographic transects (KOPRI Araon Cruise Report ANA04B) show that the waters on the continental shelf floor were ~0.5[degrees] cooler and 0.1 fresher compared with climatological values (Schmidtko et al. 2014). For the Weddell Sea, data from ship-derived transects performed during the Polarstern cruise PS82 (Knust and Schroeder 2014) show waters on the continental shelf floor with temperatures slightly above the climatological mean of-1.8[degrees]C (Schmidtko et al. 2014) and salinity [approximately equal to] 34.53 in the eastern part of the shelf (Filchner trough; see Fig. 6.4). Ice shelf water (i.e., temperature < -1.95[degrees]C and salinity > 34.63) in the central Filchner trough (at depths greater than 700 m) was also present, in line with several previous observations (Nicholls et al. 2009).\n\ng. Sea ice extent, concentration, and duration--P. Reid, R. A. Massom, S. Stammerjohn, S. Barreira, T. Scambos, and J. L Lieser\n\nFollowing the record-breaking 2013 sea ice season, Antarctic net (circumpolar-averaged) sea ice extent and area in 2014 were again significantly above the 1981-2010 mean. \"Extent\" is the total area of ocean covered by sea ice with a concentration above a given threshold (here 15%), whereas \"area\" is the actual area covered by sea ice alone (i.e., it is the product of ice extent and concentration). The record daily maximum extent observed in 2012 (19.48 x [10.sup.6] [km.sup.2]) and then broken in 2013 (19.58 x [10.sup.6] [km.sup.2]) was once again exceeded in 2014, with 20.14 x [10.sup.6] [km.sup.2] recorded on 20 September (see Sidebar Fig. SB6.3 and Fig. 6.1). Net sea ice extent exceeded 20 x [10.sup.6] [km.sup.2] for 8 days in late September 2014, and 19 consecutive days in mid-to-late September exceeded the 2013 record high extent. During these days in September, the extent anomaly was 4.3 standard deviations above the 1981-2010 mean. Similarly, 2014 saw a new record in daily maximum sea ice area of 16.21 x [10.sup.6] [km.sup.2] on 17 September, surpassing the 2012 record of 15.77 x [10.sup.6] [km.sup.2] with 16 x [10.sup.6] x [km.sup.2] being exceeded for five consecutive days. New records were set in 2014 during six months for both monthly average extent (April-September) and area (January, April-July, September), with 197 (149) individual days of record extent (area) in total. Late December (31 December) saw the largest daily anomaly, 2.3 x [10.sup.6] [km.sup.2] above the long-term average, which later increased to more than 2.5 x [10.sup.6] [km.sup.2] in early January 2015 before beginning to decline around 12 January.\n\nAs in previous years, the overall sea ice record comprised a series of distinct phases (marked as vertical dashed lines on Fig. 6.10). These show different regional and seasonal contributions to the observed net anomalies, each associated with different regional and seasonal patterns in atmospheric circulation and SST (sections 6b and 6f, respectively).\n\n1) JANUARY-MID-APRIL\n\nThe circumpolar distribution of sea ice anomalies in early 2014 followed those observed at the end of the previous year (see Massom et al. 2014). There were persistently high positive anomalies both in the Weddell Sea [Fig. 6.10e, coincident with colder-than-normal SSTs (see Fig. 6.3b)] and in the Indian and western Pacific Ocean sectors (Fig. 6.10a,b). In contrast, negative anomalies occurred in the Bellingshausen-Amundsen (B-A) Seas sector and in the eastern Ross Sea over much of the same period (Fig. 6.10c,d), the latter associated with a deep atmospheric low-pressure anomaly centered on -180[degrees] in January, then moving south into the Ross Sea embayment in February-March (reflected in Fig. 6.3a). This marked an anomalous westward positioning of the Amundsen Sea low (ASL; Turner et al. 2013a), giving lower-than-normal extent in the eastern Ross Sea and higher in the western Ross Sea, the latter also being associated with an extensive tongue of cooler-than-average SSTs (most prominent in February).\n\n2) MID-APRIL-MID-AUGUST\n\nDuring this period, large areas of greater-than-average sea ice extent existed or developed over all of the ocean sectors (Fig. 6.10). This pattern resulted in daily records of net sea ice extent over much of the period (see Sidebar Fig. SB6.3). At this time, the ASL deepened eastward (see Fig 6.3c), and resultant cold southerlies over the western Amundsen and Ross Seas sector enhanced sea ice extent there (the former associated with a pool of cooler-than-average SSTs centered on ~120[degrees]W; see Fig 6.3d). In contrast, the warm northerlies on the eastern side of the ASL impacted the growth and advection of sea ice in the Bellingshausen Sea, to maintain near-average conditions there. Maintenance of record sea ice conditions in the Weddell Sea (Fig. 6.10e) is linked to the persistence of a strong high-pressure anomaly in the south Atlantic/Weddell Sea sector (see Fig. 6.3c). The associated relatively calm atmospheric conditions likely led to enhanced sea ice coverage due to a combination of ice advection and new-ice formation. This zone of greater-than-average sea ice extent subsequently propagated eastwards into the Indian Ocean sector in June-July (see Sidebar Fig. SB6.4). During late May and early June, transient low-pressure systems to the north of the ice edge in the Indian sector caused a marked, though temporary, retreat of the ice edge at ~65[degrees]-90[degrees]E. The drop-off observed in the Weddell Sea ice extent in June-July (Fig. 6.10e) resulted from a southward, wind-driven migration of the ice edge in the northwest of the sector (with a low-pressure anomaly extending from the B-A Seas to the southern Weddell Sea).\n\n3) MID-AUGUST-MID-NOVEMBER\n\nIn mid-August, the sea ice responded to the development of a weak zonal wavenumber-3 atmospheric anomaly pattern with low-pressure centers in the Ross Sea and Indian Ocean (centered on ~90[degrees]E), and a broad center in the South Atlantic (see Fig. 6.3e). This situation, along with associated colder-than-normal SSTs [in the Ross Sea and Indian Ocean (see Fig. 6.3f)], led to ice expansion in the Ross, western Weddell, and Indian Ocean sectors, while a suppression of ice advance occurred in the B-A Seas sector. The result was the record September net sea ice extent (Fig. 6.11c; see also Sidebar Fig. SB6.3). A tongue of cold SSTs developed in the Ross Sea in September (Fig. 6.11c), then advected and expanded eastwards within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current through December. This accompanied coincident higher-than-average sea ice extent in the Ross, Amundsen, and western Weddell Seas. However, countering this was a reduction in extent around the eastern Weddell, Indian, and west Pacific sectors, with the combined effect of a gradual decrease in the net sea ice extent anomaly during October through mid-November (see Sidebar Fig. SB6.4).\n\n4) MID-NOVEMBER-DECEMBER\n\nIn late November, a noteworthy upturn occurred in the overall sea ice extent anomaly (see Sidebar Fig. SB6.3.) in response to a deepening of the Antarctic circumpolar trough and associated expansion of the band of cooler-than-normal SSTs between 150[degrees] and 30[degrees]W (Fig. 6.lid). In December in particular, a low-pressure trough encircled virtually the entire continent (Fig. 6.11b) within a weak zonal wave-3 pattern, with deep low-pressure anomalies centered around 120[degrees]E, 140[degrees]W, and 30[degrees]W. The northward flow of sea ice along the western limbs of these low pressure centers were factors contributing to the extensive sea ice observed virtually all around the continent (Fig. 6.11d). The particularly strong contributions of the Ross and Weddell Seas sectors (Fig. 6.10c,e) to the large positive anomaly in net ice extent (and area) at this time (see Sidebar Fig. SB6.4) are also linked to an extensive tongue of colder-than-average SSTs around much of West Antarctica (Fig. 6.11d).\n\nConsistent with the mostly positive sea ice extent anomalies described for the first half of the year (Fig. 6.10), the timing of the fall/early winter ice-edge advance was earlier than normal (by 10-70 days) in all sectors except: (1) the southern BAS sector; and (2) the Ross Sea sector between 160[degrees]E and 160[degrees]W, where the ice-edge advance was instead later than normal (by 10 to ~30 days). There was some correspondence between the 2013/14 ice retreat anomaly pattern (Massom et al. 2014) and the 2014 ice advance pattern, particularly for: 1) the western Weddell and Indian Ocean sectors (where the 2013/14 spring retreat was anomalously late, followed by an anomalously early 2014 fall advance); and 2) the outer pack ice of the Bellingshausen Sea (where the 2013/14 spring retreat was anomalously early, followed by an anomalously late 2014 fall advance). Most notable, however, were the strong earlier-than-normal anomalies in the ice edge advance throughout the Weddell Sea sector between 0[degrees] and 60[degrees]W and the East Antarctic sector between 90[degrees]E and 160[degrees]E. In contrast, there was a remarkable recovery and acceleration of the ice-edge advance in the outer pack ice of the BAS and eastern Ross Sea sectors (between 80[degrees]W to 160[degrees]W) later in the 2014 fall season. This area showed a sharp switch from late to early ice-edge advance anomalies south-to-north. This recovery and acceleration of the ice-edge advance corresponded to the eastward movement of the ASL (described above; see Fig. 6.3c) and strengthening of cold southerly winds in the eastern Ross Sea sector in May-June. Subsequently, a broad band of cold SSTs developed along the advancing ice edge between 90[degrees]W and 160[degrees]W (see Fig. 6.3d), which may explain the recovery and rapid advance of the ice edge.\n\nThe anomaly pattern for the 2014/15 spring--summer sea ice retreat was considerably less striking than the ice advance anomaly pattern just described, showing in general smaller anomalies. There were, however, some interesting contrasts: the outer Weddell Sea and most of the East Antarctic sector showed an earlier retreat (in contrast to the earlier advance previously experienced there), while the Ross Sea sector between 160[degrees]E and 160[degrees]W showed a later retreat (in contrast to the later advance previously experienced there). Nonetheless, the ice season duration anomalies (Fig. 6.11f) were mostly positive in those two sectors (indicating a longer-than-normal ice season), due to the early advance anomalies being larger than the early retreat anomalies. The eastern Ross and western Amundsen Sea sectors (between 130[degrees] and 150[degrees]W) showed both an earlier advance and later retreat, contributing to a much longer-than-normal ice season duration (Fig. 6.1 If). Thus, in general, most of the ice season duration anomalies are positive and are consistent with long-term trends in ice season duration (Fig. 6.11g; Stammerjohn et al. 2012; Holland 2014), with the notable exception of the B-A Seas sector, which experienced near-normal ice season duration in contrast to the strong trend there towards shorter ice seasons.\n\nSIDEBAR 6.3: SUCCESSIVE ANTARCTIC SEA ICE EXTENT RECORDS DURING 2012, 2013, AND 2014--P. REID AND R. A. MASSOM\n\nThe calendar years of 2012, 2013, and 2014 saw successive records in annual daily maximum (ADM) net Antarctic sea ice extent based on satellite data since 1979 (Massom et al. 2013, 2014; section 6g), continuing the trend over the past three decades of an overall increase in Antarctic sea ice extent (Comiso 2010; Parkinson and Cavalieri 2012) and contributing to regional changes in sea ice seasonality (Stammerjohn et al. 2012). However, the mechanisms and associated regional anomalies involved in achieving each of these records were quite different.\n\nIn 2012, sea ice extent tracked close to or slightly above average for much of the year (Fig. SB6.3); however, the development of an atmospheric wave-3 pattern during August and September caused rapid expansion of the ice edge during that period (Fig. SB6.4), particularly in the western Pacific Ocean sector (Turner et al. 2013b; Massom et al. 2013), and a new ADM was recorded in late September. The year 2013 saw quite different factors involved in achieving the record extent, with a tongue of colder-than-normal SSTs in the western Ross Sea sector aiding the early advance of sea ice in that region (Fig. SB6.4 and Massom et al. 2013; Reid et al. 2015). This SST anomaly subsequently advected eastwards after reaching the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in about June 2013, to envelop the ice edge to the north of the Bellingshausen-Amundsen Seas region and aid further thermodynamic expansion of ice there as the year progressed (Fig. SB6.3). Net ice extent was well above average all of 2013 (Fig. SB6.3), with many daily records set before the ADM was once again broken in late September. In 2014, greater-than-average sea ice extent in the Weddell Sea was the predominant contributor to the well-above-average net Antarctic sea ice extent early in the year (Figs. SB6.3, SB6.4), with colder-than-normal SSTs to the north of the ice edge in the Weddell Sea (see Fig. 6.3b) influencing a late 2013/14 retreat and subsequent early annual advance in that region. As the 2014 season progressed, the area of above-average sea ice extent expanded (light blue), and 2014 (dark blue) daily sea ice extent anomaly relative to the 1981-2010 mean (x|06 [km.sup.2]) for the Southern Hemisphere. The shaded banding represents the range of daily values for 1981-2010. farther to the east, leading to anomalously expansive sea ice coverage over much of the Indian Ocean sector for the rest of the year (Fig. SB6.4). This was augmented by midseason wind-driven ice advance in the western Pacific Ocean and Ross Sea to create a new ADM on 20 September 2014 (see Fig. 6.1).\n\nAnalyses of trends in sea ice extent and seasonality (see Fig. 6.11g) over the last few decades show that the overall increase in Antarctic coverage comprises contrasting regional contributions: strong increases in ice extent and duration in the Ross Sea and moderate increases elsewhere except for strong decreases in the western Antarctic Peninsula-Bellingshausen Sea region (WAP-BS). These trends are attributed predominantly to changes in wind patterns (Holland and Kwok 2012; Parkinson and Cavalieri 2012; Stammerjohn et al. 2012), although some research suggests an association with changes in freshwater fluxes (Liu and Curry 2010; Bintanja et al. 2013). The overall patterns of ice extent anomaly for the last three years (2012-14) are not fully consistent with these regional trends, except in the western Ross Sea where there have been persistent positive anomalies for the last three years (Fig. SB6.4). Ice extent in the WAP-BS was close to or above normal over this three-year period, and was particularly high in 2013 (Fig. SB6.4), in contrast to the long-term trend. The regional anomalies over these last three years are, however, consistent with associated patterns of large-scale drivers of sea ice formation, distribution, and retreat, that is, regional atmospheric synoptic patterns and ocean circulation and temperature.\n\nGiven that there were three record-breaking years in a row, it is well worth asking: Did the pattern of sea ice extent, and the associated retreat, in one year influence the pattern of extent and ice advance in the following year? The answer: Quite probably. Several studies have suggested that the pattern of sea ice retreat in one year car influence the advance in the subsequent year (Nihashi and Ohshima 2001; Stammerjohn et al. 2012; Holland 2014), and this appears to be the case, particularly in these last three years. From September 2012 onwards, there is a clear eastward propagation of sea ice extent anomaly stemming from the western Pacific Ocean sector, through the Ross, Bellingshausen, and Amundsen Seas during 2013 and into the Weddell Sea in early 2014 (Fig. SB6.4). The positive ice anomaly in the western Pacific region in August-September 2012, as the result of the deep low pressure in that region, may have slowed the western coastal currents and subsequently caused the cold ocean surface temperatures and hence early advance of sea ice in the western Ross Sea in 2013. Similarly, the anomalous positive extent in sea ice in the WAP-BS sector in late 2013 may have impacted the late retreat and early advance of sea ice in the Weddell Sea in 2013/14. Much of this is speculation, but there is no one specific underlying mechanism that can easily explain these three years of record-breaking sea ice extent. Indeed, Antarctic sea ice continues to behave and respond in a complex fashion by integrating influences from the atmosphere, ocean, and wider cryosphere.\n\nh. Ozone depletion--P. A. Newman, E. R. Nash, S. E. Strahan, N. Kramarova, C. S. Long, M. C. Pitts, B. Johnson, M. L. Santee, i. Petropavlovskikh, and G. O. Braathen\n\nThe Antarctic ozone hole is showing weak evidence of a decrease in area, based upon the last 15 years of ground and satellite observations. The 2014 Antarctic stratospheric ozone depletion was less severe compared to the 1995-2005 average, but ozone levels were still low compared to pre-1990 levels. Figure 6.12a displays the average column ozone between 12 and 20 km derived from NOAA South Pole balloon profiles. The 2014 South Pole ozone column inventory was relatively high with respect to a 1991-2006 average (horizontal line), and in fact, all of the 2009-2014 ozone column inventories were higher than the 1991-2006 average. The 1998-2014 period shows a positive secular trend (blue line), excluding 2002 (the year with a major stratospheric sudden warming; Roscoe et al. 2005).\n\nSatellite column observations over Antarctica (poleward of 60[degrees]S) also show a steady ozone increase since the late-1990s. Figure 6.12b shows the average of daily minimum total column ozone values over the 21 September to 16 October period (ozone hole peak period). This average of daily values is increasing at a rate of 1.4 DU yr1 (90% confidence level). Excluding the anomalous 2002 value, the trend becomes 1.9 DU yr1 (99% confidence level).\n\nThe 2014 ozone hole area was 20.9 million [km.sup.2] (averaged from the 7 September-13 October daily estimates), the sixth smallest over the 1991-2014 period. The area trend since 1998 shows that the ozone hole is decreasing at a rate of 0.17 million [km.sup.2]yr-1, but this trend is not statistically significant. As with Fig. 6.12b, if the 2002 sudden warming outlier is excluded, the trend becomes significant at -0.29 million [km.sup.2] yr-1 (p < 0.05).\n\nAttribution of ozone hole shrinkage is still difficult. Antarctic stratospheric ozone depleting substances are estimated using equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC)--a combination of inorganic chlorine and bromine. A mean age of 5.2 years is used to estimate EESC (Strahan et al. 2014). Since the 2000-02 peak of 3.79 ppb, EESC has decreased to 3.45 ppb (a decrease of 0.34 ppb or 9%). This is a 20% drop towards the 1980 level of 2.05 ppb, where 1980 is considered to be a \"pre-ozone hole\" period. Aura satellite Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) [N.sub.2]O measurements can also be used to estimate Antarctic stratospheric inorganic chlorine ([Cl.sub.y]) levels (Strahan et al. 2014) and to quantify their transport-driven interannual variability. The 2014 Antarctic stratospheric [Cl.sub.y] was higher than in recent years and similar to levels found in 2008 and 2010.\n\nSatellite observations of chlorine and ozone in the 2014 Antarctic lower stratosphere were not exceptionally different from those in the last 10 years. Observations of hydrogen chloride (HC1; Fig. 6.13a), chlorine monoxide (C1O; Fig. 6.13b), and ozone ([O.sub.3]; Fig. 6.13c) are shown for the Antarctic polar vortex. The reaction of HC1 with CION[O.sub.2] (chlorine nitrate) on the surfaces of polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) particles forms chlorine gas ([Cl.sub.2]) and causes HC1 to decline during the June-July period (Fig. 6.13a). Cl2 is easily photolyzed by visible light, and the ozone reactive CIO steadily increases as the sun returns to Antarctica (Fig. 6.13b). Chlorine and ozone in the Antarctic stratosphere in 2014 (Fig. 6.13b,c, blue lines) were within the 2004-13 climatology (gray shading).\n\nAnother key factor for the Antarctic ozone hole severity is stratospheric temperature. Colder temperatures lead to more severe depletion and lower ozone levels. Figure 6.12c shows September Antarctic stratospheric temperatures (50 hPa, 60[degrees]-90[degrees]S) from NCEP (red) and MERRA (black) reanalyses. The 2014 temperatures were near the 1979-2014 mean, as reflected also by ERA-Interim in Fig. 6.2b.\n\nThe 2014 stratospheric dynamical conditions were also near-average. The 100-hPa eddy heat flux is a metric of both wave propagation into the stratosphere and the strength of the downward motion over Antarctica. For example, in September 2002 the magnitude of the 100-hPa eddy heat flux was extremely high, the polar vortex underwent a stratospheric sudden warming, and the stratosphere was very warm (Fig. 6.12c). In contrast, the 2014 eddy heat flux was near-average for the August-September period and consequently, the stratospheric polar vortex and jet flow around Antarctica were near-average.\n\nPSCs provide particle surfaces that enable heterogeneous chemical reactions to release chlorine for catalytic ozone loss. Temperatures provide a useful proxy for PSCs, but the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) provides direct observations. Figure 6.13d displays the 2014 PSC volume (blue line). For the entire season, the PSC volume generally followed the average (white line). The year 2006 had the highest volume at 65 million [km.sup.3] averaged from June-October, while 2014 was near-average at 42 million [km.sup.3] during the same months.\n\nThe ozone hole typically breaks-up in the mid-November to mid-December period; the 2014 ozone hole broke up around 4 December (the approximate average break-up date for the last 20 years). This \"break-up\" is estimated to be when total ozone values < 220 DU disappear from the Antarctic region. The ozone break-up is tightly correlated with the lower stratospheric polar vortex break-up. The vortex break-up is driven by wave events propagating upward into the stratosphere. These wave events also mix ozone-rich midlatitude air into the polar region in the 550-750 K layer. While 2012 and 2013 ozone holes broke-up earlier than usual due to stronger wave activity that enabled ozone-rich air transport from midlatitudes, the 2014 break-up of the ozone hole occurred close to the average date.\n\nIn summary, the Antarctic ozone hole is a severe ozone depletion that regularly appears in austral spring. In the last 14 years, the ozone hole has begun to display marginal signs of improvement (i.e., decrease in size). This improvement is statistically significant in observations from both ground and satellite data, if the year 2002 is treated as an outlier (because of the major stratospheric sudden warming that occurred). Levels of chlorine continue to decline in the stratosphere because of the Montreal Protocol (WMO 2014), and this decline should be manifest in the Antarctic ozone hole. However, unambiguous attribution of the ozone hole improvement to the Montreal Protocol cannot yet be made because of relatively large year-to-year variability and observational uncertainty.\n\n7. REGIONAL CLIMATES--A. Mekonnen, J. A. Renwick, and A. Sanchez-Lugo, Eds.\n\na. Introduction\n\nThis chapter provides summaries of the 2014 temperature and precipitation conditions across seven broad regions: North America, Central America and the Caribbean, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, and Oceania. In most cases, summaries of notable weather events are also included. Local scientists provided the annual summary for their respective regions and, unless otherwise noted, the source of the data used is typically the agency affiliated with the authors. Please note that different nations, even within the same section, may use unique periods to define their normals. Section introductions will typically define the prevailing practices for that section, and exceptions will be noted within the text. In a similar way, many contributing authors use languages other than English as their primary professional language. To minimize additional loss of fidelity through reinterpretation after translation, editors have been conservative and careful to preserve the voice of the author. In some cases, this may result in abrupt transitions in style from section to section.\n\nb. North America--A. Sanchez-Lugo, Ed.\n\nThis section is divided into three subsections: Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Information for each country has been provided by local scientists and the source of the data is from the agency affiliated with the authors. Due to the different sources of data, anomalies can be reported using different base periods. All seasons mentioned in this section refer to the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n1) CANADA--L. A. Vincent, D. Phillips, and R. Whitewood\n\nThe annual average temperature for 2014 in Canada was characterized by colder-than-average conditions stretching from the central regions to the Atlantic provinces, and warmer- and drier-than-average conditions in eastern British Columbia and the northwestern regions.\n\n(i) Temperature\n\nThe annual average temperature in 2014 for Canada was 0.5[degrees]C above the 1961-90 average, based on preliminary data, the 25th warmest year observed since nationwide records began in 1948 (Fig. 7.1). This temperature was 2.5[degrees]C cooler than 2010, which was the warmest year on record for the nation. The national annual average temperature indicates an increase of 1.6[degrees]C over the past 67 years, and five of the ten warmest years occurred during the last decade. In 2014, annual departures > +2.5[degrees]C were recorded in the Yukon and Northwest Territories while annual departures < -1.0[degrees]C were observed in Manitoba and Ontario (Fig. 7.2).\n\nSeasonally, winter (December-February) 2013/14 was 0.4[degrees]C below average and the 24th coldest since 1948. Colder-than-average conditions were observed in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and most of the Atlantic provinces. Eastern British Columbia, Yukon, northern Northwest Territories, and most of Nunavut experienced warmer-than-average conditions. During spring (March-May), the same pattern of colder-than-average conditions in the central and eastern regions and warmer-than-average conditions in the northwestern regions remained. The nationally averaged temperature for spring 2014 was 0.5[degrees]C below the 1961-90 average and the 19th coldest in the 67-year period of record.\n\nSummer (June-August) was 1.0[degrees]C above average and the sixth warmest since 1948. British Columbia, northern Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, southern Northwest Territories and Nunavut, northern Quebec, and the Atlantic provinces all experienced warmer-than-average conditions. The summer temperature for the remainder of the country was near-average. During fall (September-November), the pattern of colder-than-average conditions in the central regions and warmer-than-average conditions in eastern British Columbia and northwestern regions returned. The nationally averaged temperature was 0.5[degrees]C above the 1961-90 average, the 33rd warmest fall since 1948.\n\n(ii) Precipitation\n\nCanada as a whole experienced near-average precipitation conditions in 2014. Based on preliminary data, it was the 22nd driest year since nationwide records began in 1948, with nationally averaged precipitation 98% of the 1961-90 average. Drier-than-average conditions were observed for much of the Yukon, Northwest Territories, and in the far north, whereas some areas in southern Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario experienced wetter-than-average conditions (Fig. 7.3).\n\nSeasonally, winter 2013/14 was the 15th driest since 1948 and the national average precipitation was 91% of the 1961-90 average. Most of the country experienced drier-than-average conditions but wetter-than-average conditions were observed in western Ontario, eastern Nunavut, and the Atlantic provinces. Spring 2014 was the 22nd wettest in the 67-year period of record with nationally averaged precipitation 104% of the average. Wetter-than-average conditions occurred across much of the southern regions but drier-than-average conditions were also observed in southern Northwest Territories, eastern Nunavut, and northeastern Quebec.\n\nSummer 2014 was the 14th wettest since 1948 and the national average precipitation was 106% of the 1961-90 average. Wetter-than-average conditions were mainly found in the central regions of the country whereas drier-than-average conditions occurred in British Columbia and in the north. Fall 2014 was the 30th driest since 1948 with nationally averaged precipitation 98% of average. Drier-than-average conditions in the northwest and wetter-than-average conditions in the south and east continued until the end of the year.\n\n(iii) Notable events\n\nExcessive rains during April-June led to major summer flooding in the Eastern Prairies, causing the most destructive and expensive ($6 billion Canadian dollars in damages) flood in Canadian history. Saskatoon, Saskatchewan had its third wettest April-June since records began in 1892, with total precipitation of 230 mm and 95 mm in June alone. For Yorkton, Saskatchewan, it was the wettest April-June in its 131-year period of record, with 357 mm; the record wettest June (252 mm or more than triple the normal accumulation) contributed to the April-June record. It was also the wettest April-June in Brandon, Manitoba with 374 mm and the wettest June (252 mm or three times June's normal accumulation) since 1890. Regina, Saskatchewan recorded its second wettest April-June with 312 mm and its second wettest June with 208 mm since 1883. Rains and subsequent flooding at the end of June forced highway closures, including a stretch of the TransCanada east of Regina where dozens of bridges and utilities were washed away. About 1000 residents, mainly in southwestern Manitoba, were displaced. In Manitoba and Saskatchewan, nearly 405000 hectares of seeded fields were flooded, and another two million were left unseeded.\n\nIn summer 2014, unusually warm and dry conditions in the Northwest Territories and eastern British Columbia led to ideal conditions for forest fires. According to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, the area burned was three times greater than the 20-year national average. In June and July, Yellowknife had 22 days at or above 25[degrees]C, compared to an average of eight. Yellowknife also had only two days in June and three in July with rain, and in a 91-day span--starting from about mid-May--it received only half its normal rainfall. The fires caused highway closures and interruption of the main power supply. In eastern British Columbia, it was the third warmest summer in 67 years and one of the ten driest. Fires caused the third biggest loss of timber in the province in 60 years of record-keeping and firefighting costs were four times over budget.\n\n2) UNITED STATES--J. Crouch, R. R. Heim Jr., and C. Fenimore\n\nThe annual average temperature for 2014 for the contiguous United States (CONUS) was 11.4[degrees]C, which is 0.1[degrees] above the 1971-2000 average and among the warmest third of the historical distribution since records began in 1895 (Fig. 7.4). The annual CONUS temperature over the 120-year period of record has increased at an average rate of 0.07[degrees]C [decade.sup.-1]. The nationally averaged precipitation for 2014 was 784.1 mm, 4.8 mm below the 1971-2000 average, but among the wettest third of the historical record. The annual CONUS precipitation has increased at an average rate of 3.6 mm decade\"' since records began in 1895.\n\n(i) Temperature\n\nDuring 2014, a persistent temperature pattern was observed, with above-average temperatures across the western half of the CONUS and below-average temperatures across the eastern half Arizona, California, and Nevada each had a record warm year, with five surrounding states having annual temperatures ranking among their five warmest on record (Fig. 7.5a). Seven states stretching from the Midwest through the Mississippi River valley had a top 10 cold year, but no state had a record low annual temperature.\n\nThe winter (December-February) 2013/14 CONUS average temperature was 0.9[degrees]C below the long-term average, ranking in the coolest third of the historical record. The western CONUS was warmer than average, where California had its warmest winter on record, while the eastern CONUS was cooler than average. Several arctic-air outbreaks impacted the eastern CONUS during winter, resulting in seven Midwestern states having one of their 10 coldest winters on record. Some locations had their coldest winter in over three decades. The CONUS spring (March-May) temperature was slightly below average and the summer (June-August) temperature was slightly above average. During both seasons, above-average temperatures were observed across the western CONUS with below-average temperatures in the eastern CONUS. July was particularly cool in the central United States, where three states--Arkansas, Illinois, and Indiana--were record cool during the climatological hottest month of the year. The fall (September-November) CONUS temperature was 0.3[degrees]C above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical distribution. Cool conditions continued across the eastern CONUS, with record and near-record warmth in the western CONUS. Six states in the West had one of their 10 warmest falls on record, including California, which experienced its warmest fall on record. Two states in the Midwest (Illinois and Indiana) had one of their 10 coldest falls on record. December ended the year on a warm note with the CONUS temperature 2.1[degrees]C above average, marking the third warmest December on record. Every state had a December monthly temperature above average.\n\n(ii) Precipitation\n\nFor 2014, the northern half of the CONUS tended to be wetter than the 1971-2000 average, while the Southern Plains were drier than average. Most other locations had near-average annual precipitation. Michigan and Wisconsin each had one of their 10 wettest years on record (Fig. 7.5b). Over the course of the year, drought conditions improved across the Midwest and Central Plains, with both drought improvement and deterioration in parts of the Southern Plains, Southwest, and Southeast. Drought worsened for much of the far West. Parts of the Northeast and Southeast had drought develop and disappear during the year. At the beginning of 2014, the CONUS moderate to exceptional drought area footprint was 31%, peaking at 40% in May and ending the year at 29%. The end-of-year drought footprint was the smallest for the CONUS since 2011, and below the 2000-13 average CONUS drought footprint of 32%.\n\nWinter was the 17th driest for the CONUS, with a precipitation total 27.4 mm below average. Below-average winter precipitation was observed from the West Coast to the Southern Plains. The warm and dry winter in California, combined with multiyear precipitation deficits, drastically worsened drought conditions. Winter is normally the wet season for California. Above-average winter precipitation was observed from the Northern Rockies to the Midwest. The cool and wet northern U.S. contributed to the 10th largest winter snow cover extent for the CONUS. The CONUS spring precipitation total was near-average, with above-average precipitation across the Northwest, Midwest, Northeast, and Southeast. Below-average spring precipitation was observed across the Southwest, Central and Southern Plains, and into parts of the Ohio Valley, contributing to a continued expansion of the CONUS drought footprint. The summer precipitation total for the CONUS was 239.5 mm, 25.9 mm above average, and the ninth wettest summer on record. A majority of the summer precipitation occurred in June and August. Six states across the northern tier of the country had one of their 10 wettest summers on record. Minnesota observed 205 mm of precipitation during June, marking the wettest month of any month for the state. The CONUS fall precipitation total was slightly below average.\n\n(iii) Notable events\n\nTornado activity during 2014 was much below average for the third consecutive year, with 888 confirmed tornadoes, compared to the 1991-2010 annual average of approximately 1250 tornadoes. This is the lowest number of tornadoes to impact the CONUS since 1988. There were 47 tornado-related fatalities during the year, 33 of which occurred during a tornado outbreak the last week of April across the Southeast.\n\nNumerous heavy precipitation events impacted different regions of the CONUS in 2014. Record March precipitation in western Washington State contributed to a massive landslide near Oso, resulting in 43 fatalities. In late April, a storm system dropped 519.9 mm of rain on Pensacola, Florida, shattering the 48-hour precipitation record for the city. In mid-August, a slow moving storm system moving through the Midwest and Northeast dropped 116.1 mm of precipitation in Detroit, Michigan, marking the city's second wettest day on record. Islip, New York, received 344.7 mm of rain, a new 24-hour state record. Enhanced monsoonal flow and the remnants of an east Pacific tropical cyclone brought 83.6 mm of rain to Phoenix, Arizona, on 8 September, marking the city's wettest day on record (see Sidebar 4.1 for more details).\n\nDuring 2014, there were 63 345 wildfires that burned over 1.45 million hectares across the United States. The number of wildfires was the second lowest in the 15-year period of record; only 2013 had fewer, with 46615 wildfires. The 2000-10 average number of wildfires for the United States is 77951. The total land area impacted by wildfires was below the 2000-10 average of 2.68 million hectares and the third lowest on record.\n\n3) MEXICO--R. Pascual, A. Albanil, and J. L. Vazquez\n\nNear-normal precipitation was observed across the country for 2014. Five months had above-normal precipitation, with September, October, and November having the highest anomalies (+32.8%, +23.1% and +35.1%, respectively). Overall, 2014 was the nation's 18th wettest year since records began in 1941 and the warmest since records began in 1971. Unless otherwise noted, all anomalies are with respect to the 1971-2000 base period.\n\n(i) Temperature\n\nThe 2014 mean temperature for Mexico was 22.1[degrees]C, 1.4[degrees]C above the 1971-2000 normal, exceeding the previous record of 21.9[degrees]C observed in both 2006 and 2013 (Fig. 7.6). Overall, daily mean temperatures were above normal throughout most of the year (Fig. 7.7), except for some days in the cold months (January-March and November-December) experiencing below-normal temperatures mainly associated with cold fronts. July, September, and October were the warmest months in the year with respect to departures from average, at +2.7[degrees]C, +2.5[degrees]C, and +2.3[degrees]C, respectively November was the only month with a below-average temperature (anomaly of-0.6[degrees]C) and was the seventh coldest November since 1971.\n\nRegionally, the 2014 mean temperature was warmer than normal in the Pacific states and the northwest, with six states (Baja California, Baja California Sur, Colima, Nayarit, Sinaloa, and Sonora) having their warmest year since 1971. Additionally, in the Yucatan Peninsula, the states of Quintana Roo and Campeche had their warmest and second warmest year, respectively. Mean temperature was near normal in Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, southern San Luis Potosi, Veracruz, Puebla, northern Oaxaca, Tabasco, Chiapas, and Yucatan, while the mean temperature was colder than normal in northern Coahuila, Guerrero, western State of Mexico, and central Oaxaca (Fig. 7.8a).\n\nThe first three months of the year had the largest number of frost days (minimum temperature <0[degrees]C) throughout the year. Between January and March, 32.5% of the country had at least five frost days, most of them located from central to northern Mexico. Several stations in the central region of the country reported more than 60 frost days.\n\nThe northwest, west, and south were warmer than average, a total of 28% of the country's territory, with about 60-75 warm days (maximum temperature [greater than or equal to]40[degrees]C) over the April-June period. From July to September, warm days covered only 13.9% of the country, mainly across the northwest and northeast.\n\n(ii) Precipitation\n\nRainfall was near and above normal in the north, northeast, south-central, and east of the country in 2014 (Fig. 7.8b). At the national level, a total of 830.8 mm precipitation fell on average, 106.6% of the 1971-2010 mean and the 18th wettest year since 1941. September contributed the largest amount to the annual rainfall, 190 mm (22.9% of the total), due to Tropical Storm Dolly (1-3 September) and Hurricanes Norbert and Odile (2-8 and 10-17 September), which each brought heavy precipitation to the impacted regions. In contrast, February had the lowest contribution (6 mm).\n\nMorelos and Colima each observed their wettest year since 1941, with 1777.8 mm and 1920.4 mm, respectively, twice their normal annual totals. Baja California Sur had its fourth wettest year with 334.7 mm (twice its average annual total); 20% of the total precipitation was attributed to Hurricane Odile. In the north of the Baja Peninsula, rains were scarce, and Baja California had its third driest year since 1941. Oaxaca had its seventh driest year on record.\n\n(iii) Notable events\n\nThree tropical cyclones approached the country from the eastern Pacific in September, all of them tracking along the southern area of the Baja Peninsula: Hurricane Norbert (2-8 September), Hurricane Odile (10-17 September), and Hurricane Polo (16-22 September). Odile was the most destructive due to its strong winds. Odile formed as a tropical storm off the coast of Michoacan on 10 September, where it moved parallel to the Mexican Pacific shoreline, strengthening to a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale on 13 September. On 14 September it reached Category 4 status, but then rapidly decreased to Category 3 as it was 45 km to the southeast of Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur. On 14 September, NOAA's National Hurricane Center estimated its wind speed to be 116kt (60 m s\"'), with gusts of 140 kt (70 m s\"'). According to the Mexican Weather Service, 265 mm of rain fell in San Jose del Cabo on 14-15 September (74% of the annual average precipitation at that location). In December 2014, the Mexican Association of Insurance Institutions (AMIS) reported compensations on the order of 16 billion pesos (approximately 1 billion U.S. dollars) to repair damages caused by Hurricane Odile in Baja California Sur [see section 4f(3) for more details about Eastern North Pacific storms].\n\nc. Central Anfierica and the Caribbean--A. Sanchez-Lugo, Ed.\n\nI) CENTRAL AMERICA--J. A. Amador, H. G. Hidalgo, E. J. Alfaro, A. M. Duran-Quesada, B. Calderdn, and C. Vega\n\nFor this region, nine stations from five countries were examined (Fig. 7.9). Stations located on the Pacific slope are: Tocumen International Airport and David, Panama; Liberia, Costa Rica; Choluteca, Honduras; and Puerto San Jose, Guatemala. Stations on the Caribbean slope are: Philip Goldson International Airport, Belize; Puerto Barrios, Guatemala; Puerto Lempira, Honduras; and Puerto Limon, Costa Rica. Procedures follow Amador et al. (2011) for all variables. Anomalies are with respect to the 1981-2010 average.\n\n(i) Temperature\n\nMean temperature ([T.sub.m]) frequency distributions for nine stations are shown in Fig. 7.9. Most stations, with the exception of those in Panama, experienced near-average annual temperatures. This resulted in a lower frequency of high mean temperatures in contrast to 2013 (Amador et al. 2014). The negative skewness in at Philip Goldson (T.sub.m]1) and Puerto Barrios (T.sub.m]2) on the Caribbean slope reflects a larger number of cold surges than average during the winter months. On the Pacific slope, most stations recorded a higher frequency of warm T.sub.m] values to some degree during 2014.\n\n(ii) Precipitation\n\nThe start of the rainy season is identified as two consecutive pentads with at least 25 mm of precipitation followed by a third pentad with measurable precipitation. A similar approach is used to compute the end of the rainy season, but from the end of the year backwards. Compared with the 1981-2010 period, 2014 was normal in terms of the start and end dates of the rainy season for nine stations in Central America, with the exception of Puerto Lempira (P3) which saw an early start to the rainy season (it could be considered in the lower tail of the distribution at the p = 0.05 level). The starting and ending pentads of the rainy season for the stations were: San Jose (34, 61), Puerto Limon (20, 73), Liberia (48, 62), Puerto Lempira (3, 73), David (25, 54), Choluteca (25, 60), Philip Goldson International Airport (40, 62), and Puerto Barrios (1, 69). The year began with drier-than-average conditions across the region (please see Notable Events section) followed by wetter-than-average conditions--resulting in near-normal annual precipitation totals for most stations analyzed (Fig. 7.9). Other variables such as the above-normal maximum 5-day wet-period magnitude, below-nor mal total number of dry pentads, and below-normal number of dry outliers (below the 25th percentile) all indicate a near-normal year. The interquartile range (IQR), which is an indicator of variability, also depicts a near-average year, except for Limon, Costa Rica (P7), which had a significant positive extreme IQR during 2014. The number of wet outliers (above the 75th percentile) during 2014 was extreme (positive) in San Jose (P9), Lempira (P3), Limon (P7), and Puerto Barrios (P2) at the p = 0.05 level (Online Figs. S7.1-S7.6).\n\nQuiescent conditions were observed for Central America during the first quarter of 2014. Regionally, most of the relevant moisture uptake activity was concentrated in the Lloro region in Colombia (South America). The decrease of moisture exports from the Pacific became more noticeable during the first peak of the rainy season, leading to drier-than-normal conditions for the easternmost Pacific basin. An increase in the water vapor flux from the Caribbean Sea favored an intensification of the Pacific-Caribbean rainfall seesaw for most of 2014. Linked to the enhancement of the Caribbean low-level jet (CLLJ, Amador 1998), the water vapor flux increased during the summer period for most stations. The warm ENSO-like conditions dominated the moisture flux fields.\n\n(iii) Notable events\n\nDespite not meeting the official criteria for an El Niiio event during 2014, positive SST anomalies were recorded over the Nino 3.4 region (see section 4b), especially after late boreal spring. However, stronger-than-average CLLJ 925-hPa winds during July (inserted arrows in Fig. 79) were consistent with an El Nino (Amador et al. 2006).\n\nTropical storm activity during 2014 was near-average for the Caribbean basin (6[degrees]-24[degrees]N, 92[degrees]-60[degrees]W). There were four named storms (Bertha, Cristobal, Gonzalo, and Hanna), two of which became hurricanes and one reached major hurricane status [see section 4f(2) for more details].\n\nThe drier-than-normal conditions over most of the region are associated with the warm SST observed in the equatorial tropical Pacific Ocean. Precipitation deficits were observed over the isthmus, especially during the first six months with a marked midsummer drought (Magana et al. 1999) focusing on the northern countries of Central America (see P7 and P8 in Fig. 7.9) and severely impacting the agricultural sector and hydrologic sectors. Conversely, an intense CLLJ during summer (see wind anomalies in Fig. 7.9) associated with El Nino conditions (Amador 2008) and related to cold SST in the tropical North Atlantic, were associated with intense rainfall on the Caribbean slope of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama.\n\nHeavy rainfall events during the second half of 2014, possibly associated with weaker trade winds and a decrease in the vertical wind shear over the Caribbean, had severe impacts in several locations. During the first peak of the rainy season (June), convective storms triggered landslides, claiming at least 14 lives in Guatemala and affecting about 5000 people. On 5 July, a tropical wave produced abundant rain and floods in western Nicaragua, near the Caribbean slope, causing three fatalities, affecting more than 1000 residents, and damaging 200 houses. On 18-19 August, 9 people died and 31 houses were damaged due to heavy rains in Chiriqui, Panama. By the end of August, authorities from San Juan de Limay, Nicaragua, reported that one person died after an active rainfall event. In September, several municipalities of Guatemala (El Progreso, Zacapa, Chiquimula, Jalapa, Jutiapa) claimed that drought had affected 80-90% of the bean and corn harvests. In late September and early October, floods and landslides were responsible for several fatalities across Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua.\n\n2) THE CARIBBEAN--L S. Stephenson, M. A. Taylor, A. R. Trotman, V. Marcellin-Honore', A. O. Porter, M. Hernandez, I. L Gonzalez, D. Boudet, J. M. Spence, N. McLean, J. D. Campbell, A. Shaw, A. P. Aaron-Morrison, K. Kerr, G. Tamar, R. C. Blenman, D. Destin, S. Joyette, B. Jeffers, and K. Stephenson\n\nThe Azores high pressure and above-average North Atlantic sea surface temperatures dominated conditions over the Caribbean. This resulted in normal to below-normal annual rainfall and normal to above-normal annual temperatures over most of the region (Fig. 7.10). The base period for comparisons is 1981-2010. Temperature and precipitation rankings provided in the subsections below for each of the following territories are relative to the beginning of their records in parenthesis: Cuba (1951), Dominica (1971), Jamaica (1881), Puerto Rico (1898), St. Croix (1972), St. Thomas (1953), Trinidad (1946), and Tobago (1969).\n\n(i) Temperature\n\nSome islands experienced anomalously high temperatures throughout the year. Cuba and Puerto Rico recorded their sixth and eighth highest annual average temperature on record at 25.2[degrees]C and 25.3[degrees]C, respectively. San Juan (Puerto Rico) and St. Croix observed their third (27.8[degrees]C) and eighth (27.4[degrees]C) warmest year, respectively.\n\nWith respect to monthly temperatures, Cuba recorded its third warmest February (24.9[degrees]C), seventh warmest April (26.1[degrees]C), third warmest July (27.5[degrees]C), fifth warmest August (28.5[degrees]C), and third warmest September (28.2[degrees]C). San Juan had its warmest January (26.8[degrees]C), third warmest February (26.3[degrees]C), third warmest March-May (26.6[degrees]C) and third warmest June-August (29. 1[degrees]C). St. Croix recorded its seventh warmest January (26.1[degrees]C) and fourth warmest February (26.4[degrees]C). St. Thomas experienced its eighth warmest January (26.3[degrees]C) and eighth warmest July (29.1[degrees]C), and contrastingly, its ninth coolest November (26.8[degrees]C) on record. Online Table S7.1 indicates the percentage of warm days and nights that exceeded the 30-year median for most of the Caribbean stations evaluated.\n\n(ii) Precipitation\n\nRainfall over the eastern Caribbean between January and March was normal to above normal in the south and normal to below normal in the north. Trinidad, Tobago, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia, and Anguilla experienced normal rainfall; Grenada and Barbados were moderately wet. Dominica, St. Maarten, Antigua, and St. Croix were moderately dry, and St. Kitts was severely dry. Over the northern Caribbean, Puerto Rico and Jamaica had normal precipitation, while Grand Cayman was abnormally wet. Conditions over Cuba ranged from normal to extremely wet. January was the seventh driest for St. Thomas (25.9 mm), while San Juan recorded its fifth driest March (13.0 mm).\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2014, drier-than-average conditions extended across the eastern Caribbean to include Anguilla, Trinidad, Tobago, St. Lucia, Dominica, and St. Vincent. Aruba, Grenada, and Barbados were severely dry. In contrast, St. Kitts and St. Maarten experienced normal rainfall, while St. Croix was abnormally wet. Average rainfall was recorded over Puerto Rico and Grand Cayman, while rainfall in Jamaica ranged from moderately wet in the west to moderately dry in the east. Jamaica recorded its second lowest June rainfall (47 mm) on record, 9 mm above the driest June recorded in 1994. Western Cuba was abnormally dry compared to eastern Cuba, which was normal. St. Croix recorded its eighth wettest April (94.2 mm) and St. Thomas its eighth wettest May (169.7 mm). June was the third driest for both San Juan (19.6 mm) and St. Thomas (3.6 mm) and the fourth driest for St. Croix (11.9 mm).\n\nDuring July-September, normal rainfall helped alleviate dry conditions across Trinidad, Tobago, Grenada, and St. Vincent. St. Kitts, Aruba, and St. Croix also had normal precipitation, while Barbados and Antigua were moderately dry. Dry conditions persisted over Dominica and intensified over Anguilla and St. Maarten. While Puerto Rico was moderately wet, Jamaica ranged from normal in the west to moderately dry in the east. Western Cuba was dry while the east was normal. Grand Cayman recorded average rainfall. Summer (June-August) was the fourth driest since 1981 at Piarco, Trinidad (541.1 mm). July rainfall was the lowest on record for Jamaica (43 mm). second driest for St. Croix (22.9 mm), and fourth driest for St. Thomas (20.6 mm). In contrast, August was the fourth wettest for St. Thomas (197.1 mm), ninth wettest for St. Croix (154.4 mm), and tenth wettest for San Juan (248.7 mm). Dry conditions returned in September for St. Thomas (48.3 mm) and St. Croix (68.8 mm), where they observed their sixth and ninth lowest September values, respectively.\n\nDuring October-December, normal conditions continued across Aruba, Trinidad, Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Kitts, while Anguilla, Tobago, St. Maarten, Barbados, and St. Croix were abnormally wet and St. Vincent and Dominica were extremely dry. Normal rainfall was observed for Puerto Rico while conditions in Jamaica ranged from moderately wet in the west to moderately dry in the east. Grand Cayman was abnormally dry. Apart from some abnormally dry western areas, Cuba had near-normal precipitation. Jamaica recorded its third driest October (121 mm) on record, while St. Croix and St. Thomas recorded their ninth (58.4 mm) and tenth (65.0 mm) lowest October values, respectively. November was the tenth wettest on record for St. Thomas (181.1 mm). December was record dry for the E. T. Joshua Airport (51.1 mm; located in St. Vincent and the Grenadines), while eighth wettest in St. Croix (143.0 mm).\n\nOverall, 2014 was record dry at Douglas-Charles Airport, Dominica (1908.5 mm) and 11th driest for Puerto Rico (1485.4 mm). Online Table S7.1 presents some extreme climate indices calculated annually for a number of Caribbean stations and compared with their respective median values.\n\n(iii) Notable events\n\nVery dry conditions were observed in eastern Jamaica, Haiti, western Martinique, and to a lesser extent over the eastern Caribbean during May-October. This resulted in elevated heat stress and water shortages in Haiti and eastern Jamaica.\n\nOn 18 July, the passage of a tropical wave produced 88.7 mm of rain in a 24-hour period in Trinidad and Tobago. The heavy rainfall resulted in flash floods and landslides. On 2-3 October, 110.1 mm of rain was recorded for Trinidad due to the passage of a tropical wave and the intertropical convergence zone, resulting in widespread flooding in Trinidad and landslides in Tobago.\n\nTwo hurricanes (Fay and Gonzalo) made landfall on Bermuda, the first time two consecutive hurricanes have made landfall over the island since hurricane records began in 1851. Gonzalo was the strongest October hurricane to make landfall in Bermuda since 1939, with 1-minute sustained winds near 95 kt (49 m [s.sup.-1]). Gonzalo was responsible for four fatalities and 200-400 million U.S. dollars in insured damage. Antigua and St. Marteen were also adversely impacted by sustained winds from Gonzalo.\n\nd. South America--A. Sanchez-Lugo, Ed.\n\nFor the purpose of this publication, South America is divided into three regions: Northern South America and the tropical Andes, Tropical South America east of the Andes, and Southern South America. Information for each section is provided by local scientists, and data are typically from the agency affiliated with the authors. Different data sources may use different base periods to define normal. Unless otherwise noted, normals refer to the 1961-90 base period.\n\nMost of 2014 was characterized by the sustained warmth of the eastern Pacific Ocean, influencing South America's climate (Fig. 7.11). The annual mean temperature was predominantly above normal in South America, with anomalies between +0.5[degrees]C and +1.5[degrees]C. However, negative anomalies up to -1.0[degrees]C occurred over central Bolivia and northern Paraguay (Fig. 7.12a). Precipitation was below normal in western and northern South America and eastern Brazil, while above-normal precipitation was observed over Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and central Bolivia (Fig. 7.12b).\n\n1) NORTHERN SOUTH AMERICA AND THE TROPICAL ANDES--R. Martinez, J. Arevalo, G. Carrasco, L. Alvarez, J. Bazo, and E. Zambrano\n\nThis subsection covers Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.\n\n(i) Temperature\n\nIn Venezuela and Peru, temperatures were near normal during January-March (JFM) and above normal during April-June (AMJ) and part of July-September (JAS), with anomalies between +1.5[degrees]C and +4.0[degrees]C. In the highlands, temperatures were warmer than normal during June and July, with below-normal temperatures during August (about 2.5[degrees]C below normal). In Colombia, temperatures were above normal across the Andean, Caribbean, and Pacific regions most of the year. Mean temperature anomalies were as high as +2[degrees]C, with maximum temperatures as high as 5[degrees]C above average. Similarly, in Ecuador, the average temperature for 2014 was predominantly above normal, with anomalies between +0.5[degrees] and +1.5[degrees]C. Bolivian temperatures were near normal most of the year. However, in the central valley regions, maximum and minimum temperatures surpassed their warmest historical records for June and November, respectively; Oruro (Altiplano) and Cochabamba (valley) set new record maximum temperatures for November.\n\n(ii) Precipitation\n\nIn Venezuela, drier-than-average conditions were present during JFM and October-December (OND). The lack of precipitation was associated with anomalous subsidence over the region. This pattern was particularly strong during JFM when precipitation was 40% of normal in the north and southeast regions. This feature eased during AMJ and JAS, favored by above-normal precipitation. AMJ precipitation in the northwest of the country remained below average, with as little as 60% of normal precipitation, while in north-central and eastern areas, precipitation was 120-130% of normal. In Colombia, precipitation was below normal most of the year, with deficits of up to 60% in the Andean, Caribbean, and Pacific regions. July was the driest month, with 20% of normal precipitation. During the first half of 2014, Ecuador's coastal region and the southern end of the highlands had a precipitation deficit up to 50%. The northern and central highlands and Amazonia regions recorded 110-120% of normal precipitation.\n\nIn Peru, during JFM, extreme dry conditions were observed in the northwest and the southern Andes, while wet conditions prevailed in the southern and central Amazonia region. Precipitation over northern Bolivia and the Bolivian Altiplano was above normal early in the year. North of La Paz, anomalies reached nearly three times the normal, but were near to below normal the rest of the year. Over the valleys and lowlands, precipitation was below normal for the year, as little as 68% of normal. The eastern llanos (plains) observed above-normal precipitation most of the year.\n\n(iii) Notable events\n\nIn Peru, heavy rains produced several floods and landslides over the southern Amazonia region during the first months of the year, leaving 8000 people homeless. The government declared a state of emergency for 60 days in the affected regions. In August, heavy snow fell across the southern Peruvian Andes, killing many animals, destroying 14000 ha of crops, and leaving 81000 people stranded.\n\n2) TROPICAL SOUTH AMERICA EAST OF THE ANDES--J. A. Marengo, J. C. Espinoza, J. Ronchail, and L. M. Alves\n\nThis subsection covers Brazil, Paraguay, and sectors of northern Argentina, Peru, and Bolivia east of the Andes.\n\n(i) Temperature\n\nAcross most of the region, monthly mean temperatures were about 1[degrees]-2[degrees]C warmer than average throughout most of the year. January and February were unusually warm, with the city of Sao Paulo (southeastern Brazil) experiencing its warmest January and February since 1943. The city of Rio de Janeiro (southeastern Brazil) also experienced extremely warm temperatures, including a record-high February daily maximum temperature of 40.6[degrees]C on 3 February.\n\nTemperatures during July-September were 1[degrees]-3[degrees]C warmer than normal. Eight cold surges affected South America during April-August, with southern Brazil and the Bolivian and southern Peruvian Amazon most affected. One cold surge during 23-25 July dropped maximum temperatures from 35.2[degrees]C to 16.9[degrees]C in Cuiaba (central Brazil), with minimum temperatures as low as 12.0[degrees]C occurring over southern Peruvian Amazon. During the same episode, many places in the highlands of southern Brazil observed temperatures dropping to 0[degrees]C, and Sao Paulo experienced several days with maximum temperatures below 15[degrees]C--the lowest maximum temperature since 1962.\n\n(ii) Precipitation\n\nPrecipitation deficits were observed between January and March over southeastern Brazil (150-200 mm [month.sup.-1] below normal) and between January and May over northeastern Brazil (50-150 mm [month.sup.-1] below normal), continuing the region's severe drought that started in 2012. An atmospheric blocking and a high pressure system in large parts of tropical Brazil and the tropical South Atlantic, together with an absence of the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) during summer, were responsible for the lack of precipitation over most of subtropical South America east of the Andes. As a consequence, a record dry spell of 45 consecutive days occurred during the December-February peak of the rainy season. The warm temperatures and dry conditions in southeastern Brazil led to positive 500-hPa height anomalies during the peak of the rainy season. This feature has been detected during previous dry episodes (Fig. 7.13a). Meanwhile, exceptional positive rainfall anomalies were observed in January and February 2014 in southwestern Amazonia (see \"Notable events\"). Rainfall extremes during March-May in parts of northern Northeast Brazil were due to an anomalously southward position of the intertropical convergence zone. In June, two frontal systems brought copious rain (ICQ mm above normal) to parts of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul states, affecting nearly 400 000 people (http://reliefweb.int/map/columbia/16-June -2014-south-america-severe-weather-and-floods). Wet conditions prevailed all year in southern Brazil (50-100 mm above normal), while above-normal precipitation was observed over Bolivia, Paraguay, and northern Argentina between March and July. A September frontal system produced intense rainfall in southern Brazil. In November two weak SACZ episodes produced beneficial rainfall in southeastern Brazil. The rainfall totals associated with these systems were not sufficient to end drought conditions in the region.\n\nAbove-normal precipitation observed in March-July, caused the Parana and Paraguay Rivers to overflow in rural and urban locations in Paraguay, affecting almost 160000 people, with the national capital Asuncion among the worst impacted. Bolivia's Santa Cruz department was impacted by an October dry spell, affecting 51180 people and 20 344 hectares of crops/farmland (http://reliefweb.int/disaster /dr-2014-000147-bol).\n\n(iii) Notable events\n\nHeavy seasonal rains starting in January triggered floods and landslides in several departments across the Bolivian and southern Peruvian Amazon and the states of Acre and Rondonia in western Brazil. These events affected 68000 families, caused 60 fatalities in Bolivia, and forced governments to declare states of emergency for the affected areas. In Bolivia, an estimated 36 730 ha of crops were reported damaged during the floods. Rio Branco, the capital of Brazil's state of Acre, remained isolated for nearly two months as its main roads were flooded and transportation of food and fuel to the city came to a standstill. Rainfall was unprecedented in the upper Madeira River basin in mid-January. Discharge at the Porto Velho station reached 58000 [m.sup.3][s.sup.-1], 74% higher than the 1970-2013 mean value of 38 000 [m.sup.3][s.sup.-1] (Fig. 7.14b). In the upper Beni River of the Bolivian Amazon, record discharge (>10000 [m.sup.3][s.sup.-1], twice the mean discharge for January or February) was observed for 18 days at Rurrenabaque. The heavy precipitation (Fig. 7.14c) was attributed to warm SSTs in the western Pacific-Indian Ocean and the subtropical South Atlantic (Espinoza et al. 2014).\n\nDrought conditions prevailed in southeastern Brazil during December-February 2013/14, particularly over the Cantareira reservoir system (Fig. 7.13b), which supplies water to nearly half of Sao Paulo's population. The Cantareira system is one of the largest reservoirs in the world and provides water to 8.8 million people. It marked its lowest level since 1960 (see rainfall amounts in Fig. 7.13c) and its tributaries had almost 50% of their normal discharge. Sao Paulo, Brazil, experienced water shortages that forced schools to suspend classes. Restaurants closed in small towns across the Sao Paulo state, where a third of Brazil's gross domestic product is produced. In various cities in southeastern Brazil water rationing started in December 2014 (Nobre et al. 2015, manuscript submitted to Bull. Amer. Meteor. Soc.).\n\nThe drought that started in 2012 in northeastern Brazil (Marengo et al. 2013) persisted in 2014, however, with less severity. Rainfall totals in February-April varied between 150 and 200 mm [month.sup.-] below normal, affecting mainly northern parts of the state of Bahia and southeastern Brazil.\n\nSIDEBAR 71: ENSO CONDITIONS DURING 2014: THE EASTERN PACIFIC PERSPECTIVE--R. MARTINEZ, D. PABON, E. ZAMBRANO, AND J. NIETO\n\nDuring 2014, the tropical upper atmosphere was significantly modulated by intraseasonal variability. As a result of MJO activity In February and April, three strong westerly wind bursts (WWB) were generated triggering Kelvin waves, which transported heat through the Pacific Ocean. From April to June, positive heat content anomalies up to +4[degrees]C were observed in central and eastern Pacific between 0 and 150-m depth. As a direct consequence, positive SST anomalies >0.5[degrees]C predominated along the equatorial eastern Pacific (120[degrees]-80[degrees]W) during May-December. The peak occurred after the arrival of a first Kelvin wave from May to mid-August, with SST anomalies between +2[degrees]C and +3[degrees]C. This warming extended from Peru to Central America and Mexico (see Fig. 7.11). The atmospheric response to positive SST anomalies was evident in the eastern equatorial Pacific, where positive anomalies of zonal wind at 850 hPa and 200 hPa were observed from March to August, suggesting a sustained coupling with the warmer oceanic conditions in the region (Fig. SB7.1).\n\nAll these features configured a positive phase of the ENSO cycle with development on the eastern Pacific (as described by Wyrtki 1973, 1975).
