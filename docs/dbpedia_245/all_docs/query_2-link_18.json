We had that big heat dome the first part of July, and since then, we’ve had these other smaller heatwaves set up over the region with these upper ridges of high pressure over the area that is producing all of this heated air; down at the surface.”\n\nIn terms of looking forward to August, Shelly said that things are expected to cool off a little, with the weather returning to around normal by mid-week next week. around normal by mid-week next week."
