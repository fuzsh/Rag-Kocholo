        "text": "Raw water is drawn from 13 production wells surrounding the City. Each well is located in various aquifers at different depths. We pump water from the wells to our water treatment plant. Aquifers are pockets of renewable and sustainable ground water, in which we monitor closely.\n\nConstruction of the water treatment plant was commissioned in 2010 as part of the Logan Green Water Management System, located at 9 Queen Street West.\n\nThe Logan Green Water Management System and Water Treatment Plant use settling ponds to handle backwash water used to clean filters. The backwash travels through two ponds where the iron and manganese settles out. From the second pond, water is released into the Logan Green trout pond. View the Logan Green Water Management Drawing for more information.\n\nWe use a water tower as part of the treated water delivery infrastructure. The tower was constructed and activated in 1999. The purpose of the water tower is to act as a reservoir, a pressure release and a pressure regulator. Learn how the water tower works by reading the Yorkton Water Tower facts page.\n\nHighway 10 bulk water fill station opened in October of 2012. The bulk station serves residential and commercial customers who utilize large water tanks.\n\nYou can view a model of the Yorkton Water Treatment Plant process drawing, and follow the progression of water as it is treated.\n\nTreatment of raw water begins with aeration. Adding oxygen to the water converts the iron into a state that filters can remove. Manganese is more difficult to remove and requires the addition of chlorine. Chlorine also serves as a disinfectant in the water.\n\nTo boost the oxidation process, we add potassium permanganate (KMnO4). The water moves through a series of concrete tanks and filters, allowing time for the Chlorine and KMnO4 to react with the iron and manganese. This process takes about two hours.\n\nThe water is filtered twice, once to remove larger oxidized particles and a second time to remove the fine particles. The treated water then flows into an 18,000 m3 reservoir and is readily available to supply safe drinking water to the community.\n\nOur Waste Water Treatment Plant opened in 1991. The facility is located east of Highway No. 9, about 2 Km north of the City.\n\nThe H. M. Bailey Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP) is a semi-automated secondary wastewater treatment facility. The facility uses biological methods to process residential, commercial, and industrial wastewater. The resulting product meets all provincial water quality standards. Read Yorkton's Historic Waste Water Plants to learn about previous waste water treatment facilities.\n\nThe wastewater plant uses screening, sewage pumping, grit removal, primary clarification, aeration, final clarification, and sludge digestion. Several buildings and piping systems connect the plant processes. Tunnels connect several buildings allowing for easy maintenance and repairs.\n\nThe control room provides computer controlled monitoring of all plant operations and processes. Computer operations provide a 24-hour alerting to plant personnel of problems that develop.\n\nWastewater flows to the Waste Water Treatment Plant through a series of gravity sewers. Wastewater passes through an automatic raked bar screen to remove large objects. Variable speed pumps lift wastewater up into the plant to allow for gravity movement through the processing areas. The wastewater flows into aerated grit tanks where sand and gravel settle out. The grit gets disposed of at the sanitary landfill after washing and dewatering. The liquids return to the main plant flow.\n\nThe flow enters settling tanks for three hours. The large organic particles settle, creating a dense sludge. The sludge moves into the anaerobic digester by pumps for further treatment. Effluent from the primaries flow to the biological treatment stage, also known as “activated sludge” process. Aerobic microorganisms and oxygen purify the effluent, known as the Secondary Treatment Stage. The aerated effluent and the microorganisms consume the impurities for about three hours.\n\nAfter aeration, effluent known as mixed liquors enters the final clarifiers for about four hours. In the final clarifiers, activated sludge settles to the bottom. The sludge moves from the bottom back into the aeration tanks to maintain the balance microorganisms. The treated effluent flows back into the environment by the receiving waters of the Yorkton Creek.\n\nThe Anaerobic digester mixes and heats sludge to 35 degrees Celsius. Conditions in the digester allow for anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic digestion is the breakdown of organic matter by anaerobic microorganisms. After 20 days, the sludge flows into the secondary digester. Liquid from the top returns to the plant and the thickened sludge transfers to storage lagoons. The sludge can be used in composting and farm land application as a fertilizer. Produced methane fuels boilers and provides heat for the digesters and buildings."
