        "text": "For the fourth day in a row, a warm stretch of weather has led to temperature records breaking across B.C.\n\nPreliminary data shared by Environment Canada shows 23 more records for March 18 fell on Monday, due to \"an unseasonably warm airmass.\"\n\nMany of the records that were shattered were decades old, including one that was previously set more than a century ago. On March 18, 1910, Vernon got as warm as 16.7 C. But this year, the mercury rose more than three degrees higher, setting a new record for that day of 19.8 C.\n\nThe spring preview is leading to some concern for what the season ahead will bring. On Monday, officials warned El Ni√±o conditions are predicted to bring a warmer and drier spring, which could lead to an early and intense wildfire season.\n\n\"The climate crisis is here and we are feeling the impacts of climate change. It is no secret that we did not accumulate the snowpack that we were hoping for in many parts of the province,\" Minister of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness Bowinn Ma said at a news conference about wildfire conditions Monday.\n\nAlready, crews battled two new wildfires in the Okanagan over the weekend. One quickly spread after someone was burning debris, with a local fire chief telling CTV News Vancouver he's \"never seen a fire get that big that fast in the middle of March.\"\n\nBut parts of B.C. are expected to get a break in the warm weather in the coming days, as the province returns to more typical March weather. The forecast for Vancouver, for example, shows high temperatures will hover between 10 C and 12 C into next week, with rain in the forecast for several days starting Wednesday night.\n\nThe list of maximum temperature records broken on Monday according to Environment Canada's preliminary data includes:\n\nBlue River area: New record of 18.8 C, old record of 14.9 C set in 2019\n\nCache Creek area: New record of 22.4 C, old record of 20.6 C set in 1947\n\nCampbell River area: New record of 17.5 C, old record of 17 C set in 1983\n\nClearwater area: New record of 19.3 C, old record of 17.8 C set in 1930\n\nClinton area: New record of 16.9 C, old record of 12.7 C set in 2019\n\nCranbrook area: New record of 18 C, old record of 16.3 C set in 1985\n\nCreston area: New record of 18 C, old record of 17 C set in 2021\n\nGrand Forks area: New record of 20.7 C, old record of 20.6 C set in 1947\n\nKelowna area: New record of 19.4 C, old record of 17.8 C set in 1932\n\nLytton area: New record of 20.1 C, old record of 19.4 C set in 1947\n\nMerritt area: New record of 22.5 C, old record of 17.1 C set in 2021\n\nNakusp area: New record of 14 C, old record of 13.5 C set in 2019\n\nOsoyoos area: New record of 22 C, old record of 20 C set in 1990\n\nPemberton area: New record of 20.7 C, old record of 17.6 C set in 2019\n\nPrince George area: New record of 13.9 C, old record of 13.4 C set in 1997\n\nPrinceton area: New record of 21.6 C, old record of 19.4 C set in 1947\n\nPuntzi Mountain area: New record of 15.5 C, old record of 13.4 C set in 2019\n\nSparwood area: New record of 17.6 C, old record of 13.9 C set in 1972\n\nTatlayoko Lake area: New record of 17.5 C, old record of 17.2 C set in 2019\n\nTrail area: New record of 22.8 C, old record of 17.4 C set in 2021\n\nVernon area: New record of 19.8 C, old record of 16.7 C set in 1910\n\nWilliams Lake area: New record of 15.9 C, old record of 15.1 C set in 2019\n\nYoho (National Park) area: New record of 12.6 C, old record of 11.7 C set in 1930\n\nEnvironment Canada says its weather-record summary \"may contain preliminary or unofficial information and does not constitute a complete or final report.\"\n\nWith files from CTV News Vancouver's Andrew Weichel and Kaija Jussinoja"
