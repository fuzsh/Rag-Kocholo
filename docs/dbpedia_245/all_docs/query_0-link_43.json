Active weather systems over the central United States and off the coast of B.C. today will still leave the Saskatchewan farmland without any useful moisture over the next 48 hours. Only those communities near the U.S. border are likely to get the edge of the storm system to the south before it moves toward the Great Lakes on Friday .\n\nA disturbance moving eastward over far northern Saskatchewan is giving light snow to the Uranium and Wollaston regions today. This snow will taper off to light flurries tonight as the system moves into northern Manitoba. Temperatures in the province will remain similar to what they had been over the past couple days. RCMP constable at the time of the accident, than would apply to a private citizen. \"And do not consider his discharge from the force when determining your verdict.\" \"Has the Crown proved beyond all reasonable doubt the accused was driving?\" Halyk asked .\n\n\"There was nothing improbable about what was said about Jack. The only chance for a clear look at him would have been when the Interior light oi the car came on when he entered It.\" In fact it would be improbable for Fitzpatrick to have left the three people he drove to the transfer party behind and driven to Yorkton alone for no apparent reason. \"There's a lot of community-pressure to pin someone for this,\" Halyk said. \"The Crown started its case on the premise Fitzpatrick was guilty and a large part of the RCMP investigation was based on the assumption Jack did not exist. Why did they assume Jack waslimited to being a Yorkton RCMP subdivision member?\" On the issue of the accused leaving the accident scene, Halyk directed the jury's attention to Tuesday's testimony by Mulligan, who said Fitzpatrick could have sustained a concussion during the roll-over .\n\n\"You can't look for rational behavior from someone in a semi-conscious state,\" Halyk said. The defence lawyer added all the evidence other than Fitzpatrick's statement he was not driving was a quality of truth.\" Tennent reminded the Jury Fitzpatrick did not initially respond in the witness box Tuesday during cross-examination when asked if he ran and hid in his apartment after the accident because of a guilty conscience. \"I had to ask him again,\" Tennent said. \"The manner of the witness in this Instance is most important in your decision.\" The prosecutor also called the jury's attention to a series of vague replies supplied by Fitzpatrick concerning events which occurred immediately after the accident. \"He seems to have selective amnesia,\" Tennent said .\n\nThe RCMP did make an attempt to locate Jack, by contacting hospitals, making door-to-door inquiries and through press releases requesting information, Tennent said. He said the three people the German's saw near the car after the accident were probably survtving-motorcyclists Larry Hillworth and two gas attendees from Hill Top Gulf who helped Hillworth locate the victim's bodies in the ditch or Grumetza. The crown also maintained Fitzpatrick removed articles of his clothing in the bush deliberately to eliminate evidence. What the case boils down to is your accepting the accused's credibility as to whether he was driving or not,\" Tennent concluded to the jury. \"The fundamental issue is why he ran if not because of a guilty conscience .\n\nRunning was the equivalent of guilt.\" In his client's favor, Halyk 'said he had taken the stand and testified he was Innocent. \"He said right from the outset, before consultation with a lawyer or anyone else, there was a Jack.\" Halyk also reviewed evidence given by Darlene and Irene German, who said they saw three people on the driver's side of the 1973 Pontiac, moments after it rolled-over in the ditch, across from their home. \"Testimony of the two gas attendants and Larry Hillworth indicated they at best weren't near the car for several minutes and Danny the motorist who arrived at -the scene stated he went to the car by himself.\" Halyk said he wouldn't be sur- prised if a third passenger entered the vehicle at the Elks Hall while Fizpatrick was moving over the centre console to let Jack drive. In his, hour-long summation, Tennent told the jury Fitzpatrick, as an RCMP constable, was trained to identify people, yet gave a \"bland description\" of Jack to investigating officers. He said Das, who examined Fitzpatrick described his condition as \"shaken but not in shock.\" \"I suggest with the guilt he carried, he would have reason to be shaken and turn his head away when Cpl .\n\nTodd told him of the three fatalities.\" Tennent said the Crown asserted Fitzpatrick was completely aware of the actions he Was charged with and his statement \"Jack was driving\" was a self-serving one, \"lacking \"We cannot agree on a verdict,\" Daniel Hudema, jury foreman, told Mr. Justice R. A. MacDonald. After advising the foreman that in such situations a jury may be discharged, the judge asked if further deliberation by the jury would be useless .\n\n\"That is correct,\" Hudema replied. \"Is that the end of the road, or would you like to discuss it among yourselves?\" Mac-. Donald asked. After a short pause, Hudema indicated that they'd take 10 mi-, nutes. -k: Re-entering the courtroom at 10:45, Hudema said, \"The position of the jury is still the same, there are strong pros and cons.\" He also didn't think taking a break and resuming consultation in the morning would do any good .\n\ni \"Vernon Fitzpatrick, the indictment against you will be adjourned until the next jury sitting in Yorkton May 31,\" Mac-Donald said. Later, Tennent said the charge and Indictment would remain unchanged. In charging the jury Wednesday morning, MacDonald reviewed conflicting evidence, both direct and circumstantial, in the case. He also explained the role of expert witnesses and cautioned the jury \"no expert can tell you what the answer is.\" He advised the jury if they decided the accused was guilty, they must do so on the basis of circumstantial evidence and he quoted Hodge's Rule: \"If a verdict rests solely on circumstantial evidence, before a person JACK MALUGA of The Leader-Post After more than six hours of deliberation Wednesday, a jury of \"eight men and four women was unable to agree on a verdict in the criminal negligence trial of Vernon Fitzpatrick. Crown prosecutor Dave Ten-nent indicated Wednesday night another trial will be held at the next sitting of Court of Queen's Bench In Yorkton May 31 .\n\nFitzpatrick was charged with causing the, death of Shirley Anne Schoenroth, 20, of Yorkton by criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle. The car-motorcycle mishap on the western outskirts of the city May 19, 1976 also resulted in the deaths of Lome Schoenroth and Clifford Wolfe, both 18. The jury began its deliberation Wednesday at 2 p.m. and continued until a supper break at 6. The only interruption oc-cuvred at 3:45 when the jury to requested repetition of the testimony of Dr .\n\nL. Das, who examined Fitzpatrick the day after the incident at about 1:30 a.m. in the Yorkton Union Hospital emergency ward. Das described Fitzpatrick as being, \"emotionally-shaken and in a state of mental distress.\" \"But he was talking rationally to me,\" the doctor's transcript read. The defence has tried to prove Fitzpatrick was in shock and therefore exhibited irrational behavior in leaving the scene of the accident .\n\nAt 10:15 the jury re-entered the courtroom, which still contained about 30 spectators. can be found guilty you must be satisfied not only that those circumstances are consistent with his having committed the act but you also must be satisfied that the facts are such as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than the person was guilty.\" MacDonald also explained the charge of operating a vehicle in a criminally-negligent manner as, \"driving with a wanton or reckless disregard for the safety of others.\" While he pointed out the fact a driver may be impaired does not alone indicate criminal negligence, the. judge said in his view Fitzpatrick's vehicle, in travel-' ling between 87 and 106 m.p.h. in a 45 m.p.h. zone in a populated area and straddling the solid centre line, was being driven in a criminally negligent manner .\n\nHowever he said the jury could arrive at three possible verdicts: not guilty, guilty of criminal negligence or guilty of an Included offence dangerous driving. MacDonald added the only evidence presented to indicate a person named Jack was driving was supplied by Dr. G. W. Mulligan, an accident investigation expert who after studying Fitzpatrick's back injuries, tes-1 tified the accused was probably occupying the passenger's seat in a crouched-position during the roll-over .\n\nSummations were also giver by both the Crown and defence Wednesday morning.

An RCMP officer said there are still some people missing. A list of guests is being made up and checked against those in hospital and those who went to other hotels. \"The hotel was an old wuoden one and went up like tinder,\" the RCMP officer said. Nine persons were taken to hospital for treatment of smoke inhalation, including firefighters .\n\nThe fire was spotted by the hotel nightwatchman at about 2.30 a the officer said. He saw flames in the hotel's baggage area. \"The fire spread rapidly upstairs and a man who went up to wake persons asleep couldn't get down and was forced to jump from a window,\" the officer said.

The Canadian meat packing industry should adopt uniform cutting procedures for beef and pork carcasses in line with the American system to simplify comparison of trade figures, Hawkins said. \"I'm concerned about pricing efficiency and the producer-packer relationship in livestock marketing' the economist said. \"I think it is time to consider going to total rail grade teletype selling of A-grade cattle carcasses by provincial boards or commissions. \"We have to get everything out in a competitive marketplace,\" he said .\n\n\"We have the technology to do it for all beef cattle and boner cows too.\" Hawkins said he believed the present federally-inspected terminal markets should fall under provincial jurisdiction because potential conflicts of interest between commission men, feed lot operators and order buyers are not adequately guarded against. He also said transportation equalization should cover livestock producers in remote northern areas of Alberta and Saskatchewan who now face prohibitive freight charges in moving their animals to market. SASKATOON (CP) Canada should establish weekly maximum quotas on imports of American live cattle and beef and a monthly variable quota on Oceanic beef imports, a University of Alberta rural economist said Wednesday. Dr. M .\n\nH. Hawkins was ing improvements he believed should be made in the Prairie livestock industry at the opening session of a symposium on the inter-relationship of meat and grain in Western agriculture. Dr. Hawkins said since the Canadian market is so sensitive to U.S. imports and could so be flooded by them, yearly quotas are inadequate .\n\nHe said Australian and New Zealand exporters should be subjected to monthly quotas, designed to complement Canadian seasional slaughter. They should be required to give prior notice of all shipments and only be allowed to sell to federally-inspected meat packing plants. Last year, when huge quantities of Oceanic beef were available, a new breed of speculator began purchasing imported beef, although they had no real interest in the meat packing business, Hawkins said. He advocated equitable bilateral trade, between Canada and the U.S. in cattle and livestock products .\n\nMeat inspection OTTAWA (CP) -The federal government, caught by surprise by investigations in Washington, launched preliminary studies Thursday to see if any kickbacks were paid on Canadian purchases of Boeing aircraft. Emphasizing that they know of no wrongdoing, these actions were taken by ministers: The Washington embassy was asked for clarification of news reports on investigations of the Boeing Co. by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Transport Minister Otto' Lang said Wednesday night he will ask questions in his department. Defence Minister Barney Danson said today he has launched a \"clean, acute and sharp\" study in his department which purchased five Boeing 707s about five years ago .\n\nSupply Minister Jean-Pierre Goyer, whose ministry is responsible for all government purchases, said his officials have started looking at files on the Boeing purchases. Lang, Danson and External Affairs Minister Don Jamieson said they have no information from Washington that shows any bribes were paid in Canada and all said they needed more information. The confusion here is caueed by reports from Washington that said the SEC is checking a long list of Boeing sales to about 50 airlines or countries since 1966. Canada was among the countries and Air Canada among the companies. The information was in documents released by the United States Court of Appeals, which is dealing with one aspect of a two-year SEC investigation of Boeing payments .\n\nThe commission has said that $75 million in sales commissions have been paid by Boeing. Some payments were paid to 18 consultants and agents under \"the most questionable circumstances.\" Canada was not mentioned specifically in this connection. The court documents showed that the agency has been looking at purchase agreements with Air Canada, along with supplements to those agreements. One agreement is dated 1968 and the other 1973. The SEC also is checking purchase agreements with the Canadian government in 1970 and 1971 .\n\nThis would be for the five 707s purchased for the armed forces. Air Canada bought a Boeing 747 jumbo for $24.8 million in 1968, a company official said Wednesday. Since then it has bought five more 747s and 14 727s. The 727s sold for about $8.9 million each. Peter Jerome, head of public relations for the government-owned airline, said so many airline employees and executives were involved in dealings with Boeing that it would be impossible to isolate which, if any, could have used influence improperly .\n\n\"Any purchase of an airplane must carry four signatures, in addition to the signature of the chief executive officer.\" He said such arrangements would require the participation of several of the airline's departments, including finance, marketing and technical services, as well as approval by the board of directors. Jerome said no internal investigation is being carried out by the airline.

The idea was to get it big enough without causing another cave-in for Adley to squirm through. John Shutack, an official with the federal Mining Enforcement and Safety Administration, said that by 9 a.m., after about seven hours of work, rescuers had dug a four-foot-diameter hole four feet into the cbal seam .\n\nAsked about rumors that other noises had been heard inside the mine, Shutack replied: \"We've heard some reports but we haven't confirmed them. Outside of Adley moving and outside of our own people we haven't been able to pick up any other sounds.\" He said Adley, perched on a 45-degree slope on splintered timbers in a four-by-six-by-eight-foot area, had asked for a shot of whisky but was turned down. TOWER CITY, Pa. (AP) -Workers with hand picks pecked away Thursday at tons of coal sealing a small air pocket where a miner, entombed since Tuesday, was digging with his hands in an attempt to reach his rescuers. Warm socks, a jug of hot broth and chewing tobacco had been pushed through a six-inch tunnel to Ronald Adley, 37, entombed since an underground flood wrecked a coal mine .\n\nAdley tapped a message of life through a 60-foot wall of solid coal Wednesday afternoon, nearly 32 hours after he and other miners were trapped by water and debris about a mile from the mine's mouth. Seven men are still missing. Two men were killed and their bodies recovered. Three were injured in escaping when water swept through the mine in the heart of Pennsylvania's anthra- -cite coal mining area, 40 miles northeast of Harrisburg. The water apparently broke through a wall from an abandoned shaft, sweeping mine timbers and other debris through the tunnel .\n\n\"Adley's in very good spirits and very good health,\" said Leon Richter, vice-president of the Kocher Coal the mine's owner. The supplies were pushed through a six-inch hole bored into the coal during the night.
