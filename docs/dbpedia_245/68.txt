On Friday, Environment Canada's website said a heat warning was in effect for most of southern Saskatchewan, with a ridge of high pressure over the province bringing temperatures in the low to mid-30s.

Saturday is also expected to be very hot, with temperatures near 30, the weather agency said, with more moderate temperatures forecast for Sunday.

Residents are encouraged to take care of themselves and check on isolated community members, friends and family. People were asked to conduct the checks over the phone to avoid face-to-face interactions and reduce the spread of COVID-19.

Anyone seeking advice related to health risks, symptoms and precautions associated to heat warnings was asked to call the 811 HealthLine.
