Dozens of high temperature records were broken in B.C. Saturday, including one that was set 124 years ago.

Thirty-eight communities saw their hottest March 16 on record as temperatures climbed above 20 C in some parts of the province.

In Agassiz, the mercury rose to 23.3 C breaking the record of 22.8 that was set in 1900.

Other places that saw temperatures at or above 20 C were Abbottsford, Bella Bella, Bella Coola, Hope, Merritt, Lytton, Pemberton, Pitt Meadows, Princeton, and Squamish.

The record highs came as a “ridge of high pressure” swept through the province, according to Environment and Climate Change Canada.

The warm temperatures are forecast to last until Tuesday, before more typical March weather—including rain—returns later in the week. Patios and golf courses are expected to be full as British Columbians embrace the brief period of sun and almost-summer-like warmth.
