The heat continued in July, with over ten days hitting the 30-degree mark in the month

The warmest day was July 3, as the temperature hit 35.6 degrees, a record maximum temperature for that day, and followed another record-breaking day as July 2 hit 34.7 degrees, the highest maximum temperature for that day.

Justin Shelly, a meteorologist with Environment Canada, said that it was an above-average month.

“The preliminary numbers up to July 28 have Yorkton 2.9 degrees above their normal temperature,” he said. “Which would make it the fourth warmest July on record out of 112 years of date.”

Shelly said that the cause of the warmer weather had been a couple of things.

“So we had a number of patterns over the month. We had that big heat dome the first part of July, and since then, we’ve had these other smaller heatwaves set up over the region with these upper ridges of high pressure over the area that is producing all of this heated air; down at the surface.”

In terms of looking forward to August, Shelly said that things are expected to cool off a little, with the weather returning to around normal by mid-week next week. around normal by mid-week next week.
