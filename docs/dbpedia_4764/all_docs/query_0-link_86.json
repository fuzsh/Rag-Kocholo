The course of study and type of school they plan to attend determines whether they need an F-1 visa (academic) or an M-1 visa (nonacademic, vocational). Exchange visitor (J-1) visas are for individuals approved to participate in exchange visitor programs in the United States, which can range from student to research scholar to camp counselor to physician, among other programs. Students and exchange visitors must be accepted by their schools or program sponsors before applying for visas.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-3 (U) Categories of F, J, and M Visas\n\n(CT:VISA-1828; 09-12-2023)\n\n(U) 22 CFR 41.12 identities the following F, J, and M visas classifications for noncitizens engaged in study or participation in exchange programs:\n\n9 FAM 402.5-4 (U) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)\n\n9 FAM 402.5-4(A) (U) Background on SEVP\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. (U) In response to a requirement in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, in 1997, DHS initiated a pilot program to monitor the academic progress, movement, etc. of foreign students and exchange visitors from entry into the United States to departure. This program was formerly known as Coordinated Interagency Partnership Regulating International Students (CIPRIS). As part of post-9/11 reforms, CIPRIS was renamed the Student and Exchange Visitor Identification System (SEVIS), and the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) was established to manage SEVIS. SEVP is under the auspices of the National Security Investigations Division of DHS's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nb. (U) SEVIS that monitors schools and programs, students, exchange visitors, and their dependents throughout the duration of approved participation within the U.S. education system. Consular sections can access the SEVIS record associated with the student through the CCD SEVIS report.\n\nc. (U) Contact the Education and Tourism Division CA/VO/F/ET with policy and procedural questions related to F, M, and J visas.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-4(B) (U) Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) Record is Definitive Record\n\n(CT:VISA-1970; 04-22-2024)\n\na. (U) While applicants must still present a paper Form I-20 (F or M visa) or Form DS-2019 (J visa) to qualify for a visa, the SEVIS record is the definitive record of student or exchange visitor status and visa eligibility. You must always check an applicant's SEVIS status before issuing an F, M, or J visa, for two reasons: (1) You must verify that the SEVIS fee has been paid (see following paragraph); and (2) While presentation of a valid Form I-20 or Form DS-2019 generally indicates that an individual is eligible to apply for a visa, the electronic SEVIS record in the CCD, not the paper form, is the definitive record.\n\nb. (U) The electronic SEVIS record will indicate the applicant's current SEVIS status. You should issue F, M, or J visas only to visa applicants whose SEVIS record indicates a SEVIS status of \"initial\" or \"active.\"\n\nc. (U) On occasion, you may encounter an applicant who presents a hard copy Form I-20 or Form DS-2019 but you are unable to locate the SEVIS record in the CCD. This may occur because records were not \"swept\" into the CCD from the SEVIS database as usual. If the applicant is otherwise qualified, refuse the visa under INA 221(g) for administrative processing and alert the Visa Office F/M/J portfolio holder(s) listed in the CAWeb \"Who's Who\" in VO for assistance in verifying the record.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-4(C) (U) The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) Fee\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\n(U) All students and exchange visitors, except those exchange visitors who are sponsored by the U.S. government (programs with a serial number that begins with the prefix G-1, G-2, G-3, or G-7 on the Form DS-2019), must pay the I-901 SEVIS fee at FMJFee.com before the visa interview. You must verify SEVIS fee payment through the SEVIS CCD report. If the applicant's CCD SEVIS record does not show the fee was paid but the applicant states it was, you can easily and accurately verify the SEVIS payment by entering the SEVIS number, the last name of the applicant, and the applicant's date of birth into the FMJfee.com website. Applicants who cannot demonstrate that they have paid the SEVIS fee should be refused under INA 221(g). Questions about SEVIS fee payment should be directed to the Visa Office F/M/J portfolio holder(s) listed in the CAWeb \"Who's Who\". Additional details and FAQs on the SEVIS fee can be found on the ICE website and on DHS's Study in the States website.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5 (U) Students: Academic and NonAcademic – F and M Visas\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(A) (U) Related Statutory and Regulatory Authorities\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(A)(1) (U) Immigration and Nationality Act\n\n(CT:VISA-1; 11-18-2015)\n\nINA 101(a)(15)(F) (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(F)); INA 101(a)(15)(M) (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(M)); INA 212(a)(6)(C) (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(6)(C)); INA 214(b) (8 U.S.C. 1184(b)); INA 214(l) (8 U.S.C. 1184(l)), INA 214(m) (8 U.S.C. 1184(m)).\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(A)(2) (U) Code of Federal Regulations\n\n(CT:VISA-1; 11-18-2015)\n\n22 CFR 41.61.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(B) (U) Overview\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. (U) An F or M visa is usually required for individuals to enter the United States to attend university or college, public or private secondary school, private elementary school, seminary, conservatory, other academic institution, including a language training program, or vocational or other recognized nonacademic institution. Also see 9 FAM 402.5-6 below regarding the J visa for exchange visitors, some of whose programs include attendance at a U.S. school.\n\nb. (U) Citizens of VWP participating countries who intend to study cannot travel on the VWP or on visitor (B) visas, except to undertake recreational study incidental to their visit.\n\nc. (U) Study leading to a degree or certificate conferred by either a U.S. or foreign educational institution is not permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, distance learning which requires a period on the institution’s U.S. campus requires a student visa.\n\nd. (U) B-2 visa appropriate for certain students: See 9 FAM 402.5-5(R)(3) below for information on appropriate issuance of B-2 visas to prospective students, 9 FAM 402.5-5(I)(3) on students pursuing a short course of study, and 9 FAM 402.5-5(J)(2) below, 9 FAM 402.1-3 paragraph a, and 9 FAM 402.1-5(C) for derivative children applying for B-2 status.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(C) (U) Qualifying for a Student Visa (F-1/M-1)\n\n(CT:VISA-1628; 09-13-2022)\n\na. (U) An applicant applying for a student visa under INA 101(a)(15)(F)(i) or INA 101(a)(15)(M)(i) must meet the following requirements to qualify for a student visa:\n\n(1) (U) Acceptance at a school as evidenced by a Form I-20 (see 9 FAM 402.5-4(B) above and 9 FAM 402.5-5(D) below);\n\n(2) (U) Intent to enter the United States solely to pursue a full course of study at an approved institution;\n\n(3) (U) Present intent to leave the United States at conclusion of approved activities (see 9 FAM 402.5-5(E) below);\n\n(4) (U) Possession of sufficient funds to meet the individual's financial needs (see 9 FAM 402.5-5(G) below); and\n\n(5) (U) Preparation for course of study (see 9 FAM 402.5-5(H) below).\n\nb. (U) If an applicant fails to meet one or more of the above criteria, the appropriate ground of refusal is INA 214(b).\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(D) (U) Form I-20 Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1) Student Status - For Academic and Language Students\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(D)(1) (U) Form I-20 Required\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. (U) A prospective student must have a Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status, issued by an SEVP-certified school to be issued an F-1 or M-1 student visa. Only an SEVP-certified school can issue a Form I-20 to students who have been accepted for enrollment. The Form I-20 constitutes proof of acceptance at an SEVP-certified school and allows the holder to apply for a visa or change of status and admission into the United States. The Form I-20 has the student’s unique SEVIS identification (ID) number on the upper left-hand side with the visa class printed on the top right-hand side. New forms do not have a bar code. SEVIS ID numbers are an N followed by 9 digits. Old Forms I-20 with a bar code ceased to be issued as of June 26, 2015, and became invalid for visa issuance on July 1, 2016.\n\nb. (U) An F-1 or M-1 visa may be issued only to an applicant who presents a properly completed and valid Form I-20 from the institution the student will attend and who is otherwise eligible for a visa. These forms are issued only in the United States by approved institutions to students who will pursue a full course of study.\n\nc. (U) F and M visa applicants must present a signed Form I-20 and J Visa applicants a Form DS-2019 before visa issuance. If there are minor errors on the form (e.g., a program start date that is off by one day) you can process the case using that form. However, if the form indicates an unrealizable program start date, or has a typographic error in the biographic data, you must verify that the information is correct in SEVIS. The SEVIS record is the definitive record of student status and visa eligibility. In most cases, the electronic record can be corrected by the institution without requiring issuance of a new hard copy Form I-20 or Form DS 2019. You must verify that the SEVIS status is either \"initial\" or \"active\". Make a case note that the electronic record contains corrections, and that the traveler will present the Form I-20 at the POE. CBP accesses the electronic record using the SEVIS number.\n\nd. (U) A Form I-20 must bear the signature of the designated school official (DSO) certifying that:\n\n(1) (U) The student's application for admission has been fully reviewed and is approved;\n\n(2) (U) The student is financially able to pursue the proposed course of study;\n\n(3) (U) Page 1 of the Form I-20 was completed and verified to be accurate before signature; and\n\n(4) (U) If the student will be attending a public high school on an F-1 visa, the school indicates that the student has paid the unsubsidized cost of the education (see INA 214(m)) and the amount submitted by the student for that purpose.\n\ne. (U) On November 1, 2021, SEVP published policy guidance outlining the new procedure for the use of electronic signatures and transmission of the Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.” This guidance permits designated school officials (DSOs) to electronically sign and transmit the Form I-20 to initial and continuing international students and their dependents, using software programs or applications or by using electronically reproduced copies of a signature. Additionally, school officials may scan and email or electronically transmit the Form I-20 via a secure platform, such as a school portal or other secure site, to F and M students and their dependents. DSOs may also choose to still physically sign and mail the Form I-20 to students.\n\nf. (U) A Form I-20 issued by a school system must indicate the specific school within the system that the student will attend.\n\ng. (U) If the applicant submits a Form I-20 that does not contain all the required information, you must refuse the visa under INA 221(g) and require that the missing information be submitted.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(D)(2) (U) Student Must Present Form I-20 at Port of Entry (POE)\n\n(CT:VISA-1970; 04-22-2024)\n\na. (U) At the time of admission to the United States, a student must present the entire Form I-20, properly filled out and signed by the DSO and the student. Thus, after the visa interview or after an F-1 or M-1 visa has been issued, you must return the completed Form I-20, together with all supporting financial evidence, to the individual for presentation to the U.S. immigration officer at the POE. Upon the student's arrival, the immigration officer will examine the documentation and return the financial evidence to the individual.\n\nb. (U) The student must always retain the Form I-20 while in the United States.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(D)(3) (U) Suspension of Cases Involving Unrealizable Reporting Dates\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. (U) Action on the application must be suspended if the program start date specified in the applicant's Form I-20 or Form DS-2019 is already past or you believe that the applicant will be unable to meet that date. The officer must review the SEVIS record in the CCD to determine whether the DSO (for F and M visas) or responsible officer (J visas) has amended the SEVIS record to change the program start date. If this has not already been done, the applicant must ask the official to enter a new program start date in SEVIS - one that the applicant can meet. You may then issue the visa based on the electronic record.\n\nb. (U) You may issue an F or M visa to an applicant who is otherwise qualified, was previously admitted in F or M status, and is seeking to renew the visa to continue participation in a student program, if the status of the individual’s SEVIS record is \"active.\"\n\nc. (U) Do not renew F or M visas for individuals whose SEVIS status is in any status other than active, regardless of presentation of a hard copy Form I-20 that may appear to be valid on its face.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(D)(4) (U) Fraud Related to Form I-20\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\n(U) Fraud, as it relates to F and M cases, often involves the submission of false records to institutions to secure a Form I-20. You may also observe unusual patterns of Form I-20 issuance from a particular institution. If any type of fraud is suspected, refuse the visa under INA 221g and refer the case to the Fraud Prevention Manager through ECAS and to CA/FPP. In addition, notify CA/FPP/ATD student visa portfolio holder and the F/M/J portfolio manager(s) in CA/VO/F/ET. If a fraud investigation confirms fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact on the part of the applicant, you must consider an ineligibility under INA 212(a)(6)(C). Questions concerning an applicant's ineligibility under INA 212(a)(6)(C) must be addressed to L/CA.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(D)(5) (U) F-1 Form I-20 Sample\n\n(CT:VISA-432; 08-08-2017)\n\n(U) See Form I-20 Sample.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(E) (U) Residence Abroad\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(E)(1) (U) Residence Abroad Required\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. (U) INA 101(a)(15)(F)(i) and INA 101(a)(15)(M)(i) both require that an F-1 or M-1 applicant possess a residence in a foreign country they have no intention of abandoning. You must be satisfied that the applicant intends to depart upon completion of the approved activity; specifically, they must:\n\n(1) (U) Have a residence abroad;\n\n(2) (U) Have no immediate intention of abandoning that residence; and\n\n(3) (U) Intend to depart from the United States upon completion of approved activities.\n\nb. (U) Adjudicating student visa applications differs from those of other short-term visitors in that the residence-abroad requirement should be looked at differently. Typically, students lack the strong economic and social ties of more established visa applicants, and they plan longer stays in the United States. The statute assumes that the natural circumstances of being a student do not disqualify the applicant from qualifying for a student visa. You should consider the applicant's present intent in determining visa eligibility, not what they might do after a lengthy stay in the United States.\n\nc. (U) If a student visa applicant is residing with parents or guardians, they are maintaining a residence abroad if you are satisfied that the applicant has the present intent to depart the United States at the conclusion of their studies. The fact that this intention may change is not sufficient reason to deny a visa. In addition, the present intent to depart does not imply the need to return to the country from which they hold a passport. It means only that they must intend to leave the United States upon completion of their studies. Given that most student visa applicants are young, they are not expected to have a long-range plan and may not be able to fully explain their plans at the conclusion of their studies. You must be satisfied when adjudicating the application that the applicant possesses the present intent to depart at the conclusion of their approved activities.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(E)(2) (U) Relationship of Education or Training Sought to Existence of Ties Abroad\n\n(CT:VISA-1970; 04-22-2024)\n\na. (U) The fact that a student’s proposed education or training would not appear to be useful in their homeland is not a basis for refusing an F-1 or M-1 visa. This remains true even if the applicant‘s proposed course of study seems to be impractical. For example, if a student visa applicant from a developing country wishes to study nuclear engineering simply because they enjoy it, they may no more be denied a visa because there is no market for a nuclear engineer’s skills in their homeland than they may be denied a visa for the study of philosophy or Greek simply because they do not lead to a specific vocation.\n\nb. (U) The fact that education or training like that which the applicant plans to undertake is apparently available in their home country is not in itself a basis for refusing a student visa. An applicant may legitimately seek to study in the United States for various reasons, including a higher standard of education or training. Furthermore, the desired education or training in the applicant's homeland may be only theoretically available; openings in local schools and institutions may be already filled or reserved for others.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(E)(3) (U) Returning Students\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\n(U) Some students must apply for visa renewals if they go home or travel during their period of study. Where applicable, returning students may be eligible to apply under an interview waiver authority (see 9 FAM 403.5-4(A)(1)). You should usually issue visas to returning students who are qualified unless circumstances have changed significantly since the previous issuance. Students should be encouraged to travel home during their studies to maintain ties to their country of origin. If students feel they will encounter difficulties in seeking a new student visa or that they will not be issued a visa to continue their studies, they may be less inclined to leave the United States during their studies and hence may distance themselves from their family and homeland. Facilitate the reissuance of student visas so that these students can travel freely back and forth between their homeland and the United States and thereby maintain their ties.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(F) (U) Knowledge of English\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(F)(1) (U) Notation on Form I-20\n\n(CT:VISA-1628; 09-13-2022)\n\na. (U) If the individual's Form I-20 indicates that proficiency in English is required for pursuing the selected course of study and no arrangements have been made to overcome any English-language deficiency, you must determine whether the visa applicant has the necessary proficiency. To this end, the officer must conduct the visa interview in English and may require the applicant to read aloud from an English-language book, periodical, or newspaper, and to restate in English in the applicant's own words what was read. The applicant may also be asked to read aloud and explain several of the conditions set forth in the Form I-20. A student must demonstrate English language proficiency only if an admitting institution has made English language ability a requirement for the intended course of study.\n\nb. (U) If a school has admitted an applicant based on the applicant's TOEFL, IELTS, or other English language test scores, the officer must not reevaluate the school's admission decision, even if the applicant seems to know less English than the TOEFL or IELTS score indicates, unless the officer suspects the applicant obtained the results through fraud. Many students do well on the TOEFL or IELTS but seem to falter in their English when confronted with a face-to-face interview. Since 2018, hundreds of colleges and universities have started accepting the Duolingo English Test scores as part of their admissions process.\n\nc. (U) If the school is aware of a student's lack of English proficiency and has arranged for the student to study English before enrolling in regular courses, then the lack of English skills is not relevant.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(F)(2) (U) Courses for Students Taught in a Language Other than English in which the Student Is Proficient\n\n(CT:VISA-1; 11-18-2015)\n\n(U) Proficiency in English is not required of a student if the enrolling institution conducts the course in a language in which the visa applicant is proficient.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(F)(3) (U) English as a Second Language (ESL)\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\n(U) The fact that an ESL or other education program is available locally is not in itself grounds for refusing an applicant. Many students find language learning enhanced by living in the country where the language is spoken. Students who intend to study in ESL-only programs must present a valid Form I-20 and be found qualified for an F visa. Postsecondary institutions that require English proficiency for a student to matriculate use a variety of mechanisms, and such arrangements must be evident on the visa applicant's Form I-20. Contact VO's F/M/J portfolio holder(s) listed in the CAWeb \"Who's Who\" in VO for additional guidance, as required.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(G) (U) Adequate Financial Resources\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(G)(1) (U) Determining Financial Status of F-1 and M-1 Students\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. (U) The sponsoring school is required to verify the availability of financial support before issuing the Form I-20. Schools may not be as well-versed in local documentation or cultural practices as you may be; therefore, you must still ensure that the student has sufficient funds to successfully study in the United States without being forced to resort to unauthorized employment.\n\nb. (U) F-1 Student: The phrase \"sufficient funds to cover expenses\" referred to in 22 CFR 41.61(b)(1)(ii) means the applicant must have sufficient funds to successfully study in the United States without resorting to unauthorized U.S. employment for financial support. An applicant must provide evidence that sufficient funds are, or will be, available to defray all expenses during the entire period of anticipated study. In addition to personal funds, sources of funding may include scholarships, assistantships, fellowships, and approved on-campus employment. This does not mean the applicant must have cash immediately available to cover the entire period of intended study, which may last several years. You must, however, establish, usually through credible documentary evidence, that the applicant has enough readily available funds to meet all expenses for the first year of study. A student could potentially satisfy this requirement by presenting evidence of an existing student loan, but the mere intention to obtain a loan would be insufficient. Likewise, a student’s plan to use curricular practical training (CPT) or optional practical training (OPT) to cover first-year expenses would be insufficient. You also must be satisfied that, barring unforeseen circumstances, adequate funds will be available for each additional year of study from the same source or from one or more other specifically identified and reliable financial sources. Funds derived from CPT or OPT may be considered for returning students, who are authorized to participate. Mere eligibility and/or intent to engage in CPT or OPT is speculative, both in terms of the amount of money that might be earned and whether authorization to work will be granted and may not be sufficient to demonstrate the necessary funds. See 9 FAM 402.5-5(N) below for more information on employment for F-1 and M-1 students.\n\nc. (U) M-1 Student: All applicants for M-1 visas must establish that they have immediately available to them funds or assurances of support necessary to pay all tuition and living costs for the entire period of intended stay.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(G)(2) (U) Adequate Medical Insurance\n\n(CT:VISA-1292; 05-27-2021)\n\n(U) F and M students and their dependents are not required to have U.S. medical or travel insurance to qualify for a visa.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(G)(3) (U) Funds from Source(s) Outside the United States\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\n(U) When an applicant indicates financial support from a source outside the United States (for example, from parents living in the country of origin), determine whether there are restrictions on the transfer of funds from the country concerned. If so, you must require acceptable evidence that these restrictions will not prevent the funds from being made available during the period of the applicant's projected stay in the United States.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(G)(4) (U) Affidavits of Support or Other Assurances by an Interested Party\n\n(CT:VISA-1; 11-18-2015)\n\n(U) Various factors are important in evaluating assurances of financial support by interested parties:\n\n(1) (U) Financial support to a student is not a mere formality to facilitate the applicant's entry into the United States, nor does it pertain only when the individual cannot otherwise provide adequate personal support. Rather, the sponsor must ensure that the applicant will not become a public charge nor be compelled to take unauthorized employment while studying in the United States. This obligation commences when the visa holder enters the United States and continues until the visa holder's completion of their program of study and departure.\n\n(2) (U) You must resolve any doubt that the financial status of the person giving the assurance is sufficient to substantiate the assertion that financial support is available to the applicant.\n\n(3) (U) You must also carefully evaluate the factors that would motivate a sponsor to honor a commitment of financial support. If the sponsor is a close relative of the applicant, there may be a greater probability that the commitment will be honored than if the sponsor is not a relative. Regardless of the relationship, you must be satisfied that the reasons prompting the offer of financial support make it likely the commitment will be fulfilled.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(G)(5) (U) Funds from Fellowships and Scholarships for F-1 Student\n\n(CT:VISA-1837; 09-26-2023)\n\n(U) A college or university may arrange for a nonimmigrant student to engage in research projects, give lectures, or perform other academic functions as part of a fellowship, scholarship, or assistantship grant, if the institution certifies that the student will also pursue a full course of study.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(G)(6) (U) Post-Doctoral Research Grants for F-1 Student\n\n(CT:VISA-1; 11-18-2015)\n\n(U) A visa applicant may be issued an F-1 visa for post-doctoral research even if the college or university provides compensation to the individual in the form of a grant.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(H) (U) Educational Qualifications for F-1 and M-1 Students\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(H)(1) (U) Consular Role in Determining Educational Qualifications\n\n(CT:VISA-1970; 04-22-2024)\n\na. (U) The Form I-20 and SEVIS record are evidence that a school has accepted the applicant as a student. You should normally not go behind the Form I-20 or SEVIS record to assess the applicant's qualifications as a student for that institution. If you have reason to believe that the applicant engaged in fraud or misrepresentation to garner acceptance into the school, then that information is an important factor to consider in determining if the applicant has a bona fide intent to engage in study in the United States.\n\nb. (U) You are not expected to assume the role of guidance or admissions counselor to determine whether an applicant for an F-1 or M-1 visa is qualified to pursue the desired course of study. You must, however, be alert to three specific factors when determining whether the applicant qualifies for a student visa:\n\n(1) (U) The applicant has successfully completed a course of study equivalent to that normally required of a U.S. student seeking enrollment at the same level;\n\n(2) (U) Cases in which an applicant has submitted forged or altered transcripts of previous or related study or training which the institution has accepted as valid; and\n\n(3) (U) Cases in which an institution has accepted an applicant's alleged previous course of study or training as the equivalent of its normal requirements when, in fact, such is not the case.\n\nc. (U) Through its school certification process, SEVP evaluates the qualifications of a school to issue Forms I-20. This process includes a determination as to whether the school is a bona fide, established institution of learning which possesses the necessary facilities, personnel, and finances to conduct instruction in recognized courses of study. Evaluation also involves an on-site visit. If you have reason to question the authenticity of a school or exchange program, contact the (CA/VO/F/ET) F/M/J portfolio holder and the Office of Fraud Prevention Programs (CA/FPP) so inquiries to ECA or SEVP are appropriately coordinated through CA.\n\nd. (U) Many U.S. colleges and universities do not require foreign students to submit SAT, ACT, or other standardized admission test scores, and not all schools require specific grade point averages (GPAs) for admission. Therefore, you may not require that applicants provide admission test scores, or that applicants have a certain grade point average. SEVP does not have a role in dictating admissions practices to the schools they approve to issue Form I-20.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(H)(2) (U) Choice of Academic Institution\n\n(CT:VISA-1494; 02-28-2022)\n\n(U) Which school a student chooses is not nearly as important as why they choose it. The United States has over 4,700 accredited colleges and universities of all types and sizes. Accreditation is the process that ensures a program or institution meets a certain level of academic standard. Schools may be public or private; non-profit or for-profit; large or small. A plan that includes initial attendance at a community college or English language program, and then a transfer to a four-year college is common, for reasons such as affordability, to fulfill academic prerequisites, and due to the flexibility and wide array of options available in the U.S. higher education system. Some students may seek only to study at community colleges or do short-term programs such as Intensive English Programs (IEP), or pursue studies at specialized institutions, such as medical, business, technology-related, or fine arts schools, which typically award most degrees in a single field. Attendance at a lesser-known college or university is not a ground of ineligibility and applicants cannot be refused a visa for this reason. Faced with growing international competition for international students, promoting U.S. colleges and universities is a priority for the Department to ensure that the United States continues to be the top receiver of international students globally. The Department’s EducationUSA network of educational advising centers actively promotes all accredited U.S. colleges and universities, maintaining over 430 advising centers in over 175 countries and territories. EducationUSA advisers assist international students in identifying accredited U.S. colleges and universities where they may be best positioned for success. There is no legal difference between SEVP-certified community colleges, English language schools, and four-year institutions in terms of their authorization to issue Form I-20. Resources to identify which institutions are accredited can be found at Understanding U.S. Accreditation.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(I) (U) Full Course of Study\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(I)(1) (U) F-1 Academic Student\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. (U) DHS regulations (8 CFR 214.2(f)(6)(i)) specify that “Successful completion of the full course of study must lead to the attainment of a specific educational or professional objective.\" Those regulations state that a \"full course of study\" as required by INA 101(a)(15)(F)(i) means:\n\n(1) (U) Postgraduate study or postdoctoral study at a college or university, or undergraduate or postgraduate study at a conservatory or religious seminary, certified by a designated school official (DSO) as a full course of study;\n\n(2) (U) Undergraduate study at a college or university, certified by a school official to consist of at least 12 semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term in those institutions using standard semester, trimester, or quarter hour systems, where all undergraduate students who are enrolled for a minimum of twelve semester or quarter hours are charged full-time tuition or are considered full time for other administrative purposes, or its equivalent (as determined by the district director in the school approval process), except when the student needs a lesser course load to complete the course of study during the current term;\n\n(3) (U) Study in a postsecondary language, liberal arts, fine arts, or other non-vocational program at a school which confers upon its graduates recognized associate or other degrees or has established that its credits have been and are accepted unconditionally by at least three institutions of higher learning which are either:\n\n(a) (U) A school (or school system) owned and operated as a public educational institution by the United States or a State or political subdivision thereof; or\n\n(b) (U) A school accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body, and which has been certified by a DSO to consist of at least twelve clock hours of instruction a week, or its equivalent as determined by the district director in the school approval process;\n\n(4) (U) Study in any other language, liberal arts, fine arts, or other non-vocational training program, certified by a DSO to consist of at least eighteen clock hours of attendance a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of classroom instruction, or to consist of at least twenty-two clock hours a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of laboratory work; or\n\n(5) (U) Study in a curriculum at an approved private elementary or middle school or public or private academic high school which is certified by a DSO to consist of class attendance for not less than the minimum number of hours a week prescribed by the school for normal progress towards graduation.\n\nb. (U) Notwithstanding paragraphs 8 CFR 214.2(f)(6)(i)(A) and 8 CFR 214.2 (f)(6)(i)(B), a noncitizen who has been granted employment authorization pursuant to the terms of a document issued by USCIS under paragraphs 8 CFR 214.2(f)(9)(i) or 8 CFR 214.2(f)(9)(ii) and published in the Federal Register shall be deemed to be engaged in a \"full course of study\" if they remain registered for no less than the number of semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term specified by the Commissioner in the notice for the validity period of such employment authorization.\n\nc. (U) Institution of Higher Learning: Under DHS regulations (8 CFR 214.2(f)(6)(ii)), “a college or university is an institution of higher learning which awards recognized associate, bachelor's, master's, doctorate, or professional degrees.” DHS holds that schools that devote themselves exclusively or primarily to vocational or business schools are not included in the category of colleges or universities but are categorized as M-1 schools.\n\nd. (U) Reduced Course Load: The DSO may advise an F-1 student to engage in less than a full course of study due to initial difficulties with the English language or reading requirements, unfamiliarity with U.S. teaching methods, or improper course level placement. An F-1 student authorized to reduce course load by the DSO in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 214.2(f)(6)(iii) is maintaining status. On-campus employment pursuant to the terms of a scholarship, fellowship, or assistantship is deemed to be part of the academic program of a student otherwise taking a full course of study.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(I)(2) (U) M-1 Nonacademic Student\n\n(CT:VISA-1090; 06-24-2020)\n\n(U) DHS regulations (8 CFR 214.2(m)(9)) specify that \"successful completion of the course of study must lead to the attainment of a specific educational or vocational objective.\" Those regulations state that a ”full course of study” as required by INA 101(a)(15)(M)(i) means:\n\n(1) (U) Study at a community college or junior college, certified by a school official to consist of at least twelve semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term in those institutions using standard semester, trimester, or quarter-hour systems, where all students enrolled for a minimum of twelve semester or quarter hours are charged full-time tuition or considered full time for other administrative purposes, or its equivalent (as determined by the district director) except when the student needs a lesser course load to complete the course of study during the current term;\n\n(2) (U) Study at a postsecondary vocational or business school, other than in a language training program except as provided in 8 CFR 214.3(a)(2)(iv), which confers upon its graduates recognized associate or other degrees or has established that its credits have been and are accepted unconditionally by at least three institutions of higher learning which are either:\n\n(a) (U) A school (or school system) owned and operated as a public educational institution by the United States or a State or political subdivision thereof; or\n\n(b) (U) A school accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body; and which has been certified by a designated school official (DSO) to consist of at least twelve hours of instruction a week, or its equivalent as determined by the district director;\n\n(3) (U) Study in a vocational or other nonacademic curriculum, other than in a language training program except as provided in 8 CFR 214.3(a)(2)(iv), certified by a DSO to consist of at least eighteen clock hours of attendance a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of classroom instruction, or at least twenty-two clock hours a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of shop or laboratory work; or\n\n(4) (U) Study in a vocational or other nonacademic high school curriculum, certified by a DSO to consist of class attendance for not less than the minimum number of hours a week prescribed by the school for normal progress towards graduation.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(I)(3) (U) B-2 Visa for Visitor Who Will Engage in a Short Course of Study\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. (U) Individuals whose principal purpose of travel (see 9 FAM 402.1-3) is tourism, but who also engage in a \"short course of study\" while in the United States, are properly classified for B-2 visas. If the student will earn academic credit toward completion of an academic program, then it is not a \"short course of study\", and B-2 is not the appropriate visa class. This guidance applies regardless of whether it is a U.S. or foreign educational institution that will grant academic credit for completion of the short course of study. You should not advise applicants to obtain an I-20 but should refuse the visa under INA 214(b) as not approvable for the planned activities.\n\nb. (U) An individual whose principal purpose of travel is non-credit-bearing avocational/recreational study, which can itself be touristic in nature, may be properly classified B-2 visas. See 9 FAM 402.2-4(B)(9).\n\nc. (U) Individuals traveling to the United States to attend seminars or conferences that are required to earn a degree (i.e., the applicant cannot complete the requirements for the degree unless they complete the proposed seminar or conference in the United States) are not eligible for B visa classification. This includes students engaged in an online course of study traveling to the United States for academic consultations or to take examinations. In the case of a noncitizen traveling to the United States to attend seminars and conferences for credit toward a degree, the study is neither incidental to a tourist visit, avocational, nor recreational.\n\nd. (U) Individuals traveling to attend professional education, seminars, or conferences that do not result in academic credit may qualify for a B-1 per 9 FAM 402.2-5(B).\n\ne. (U) It is common for U.S. colleges, universities, and private organizations to offer summer programs tailored for high school or college-aged students. Though these programs are for academic enrichment and are marketed as “study” and the participants attend “classes” the activities do not meet the definition of “full” or “part-time” course of study and therefore do not qualify for issuance of an I-20. You may not advise applicants to obtain an I-20 for these programs. In most cases, the activity, which is more like a summer camp with an academic focus, can be undertaken in B-2 status. Consult L/CA for an AO on the appropriate visa classification.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(I)(4) (U) F-1 or M-1 Visa for Visitor Who Will Engage in a Short-Term Program\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. (U) Only applicants who present a valid Form I-20 should be adjudicated as F or M applicants. Do not advise applicants who do not present a Form I-20 to obtain one and return for further adjudication. Instead, applicants without a Form I-20 should be adjudicated in the most logical category that allows the proposed activities in the United States. In most cases, this will be a B visa. Consult with L/CA if it is unclear whether the activities proposed are permissible on a B visa.\n\nb. (U) An individual may be issued a Form I-20 by a school only if they will engage in a full course of study.\n\nc. (U) If a student is receiving academic credit for the program of study or the program of study is required for their degree, the student must qualify for an F-1 or M-1 visa. 8 CFR 214.2(b)(7) prohibits an individual from enrolling in a course of study on a B-1 or B-2 visa. See 9 FAM 402.5-5(J)(2) below, 9 FAM 402.1-3 paragraph a, and 9 FAM 402.1-5(C) for possible limited exceptions.\n\nd. (U) Students may enroll in online degree programs that allow them to reside overseas but that may require them to travel to the United States for short programs required for their degree. Such students should apply for F-1 or M-1 visas and should present a properly executed Form I-20 indicating appropriate program dates for this limited period of school attendance on their U.S. campus.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(J) (U) Special Types of Students\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(J)(1) (U) Students Destined to Schools Which are Avocational or Recreational in Character\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\n(U) DHS cannot approve schools which are avocational or recreational in character for issuance of Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status. Students coming to study in such schools may be eligible for B-2 visas if the purpose of attendance is recreational or avocational. When the nature of a school's program makes determining its character difficult, consult with L/CA on the appropriate visa classification.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(J)(2) (U) Elementary School Students\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. (U) Only children qualified for a derivative nonimmigrant classification through a principal parent may attend a publicly funded elementary school. No public elementary schools or school systems are approved by SEVP to issue Form I-20 for attendance in F-1 nonimmigrant status by children in kindergarten through grade eight. However, any school age student (kindergarten through grade 12) who is otherwise qualified may receive an F-1 visa under INA 101(a)(15)(F)(i) to attend a private school.\n\nb. (U) Occasionally, you may encounter situations in which an American citizen/LPR friend or relative, or an institution in the United States, may offer to accept guardianship of a child to provide an indeterminate period of free schooling at a public school. You may determine that a parent appears to be seeking a B visa for a child or children to facilitate this arrangement. Keep in mind that study is usually not allowed on a B visa and that even legal guardianship does not constitute a qualifying family relationship for residence in the United States. See 9 FAM 402.5-5(K)(4) below. Separately, see 9 FAM 402.1-3 paragraph a and 9 FAM 402.1-5(C) for situations in which a child applies for a B-2 visa to accompany a parent who is the principal applicant.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(J)(3) (U) Candidates for Religious Orders\n\n(CT:VISA-1; 11-18-2015)\n\n(U) Individuals desiring to enter a convent or other institution for religious training of a temporary nature are classifiable as F-1 students under INA 101(a)(15)(F) if the institution has been approved as a place of study and the applicant will return abroad after concluding the course of study or training.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(J)(4) (U) Student Destined to U.S. Military Training Facility\n\n(CT:VISA-1970; 04-22-2024)\n\na. (U) Military cadets accepted by any of the U.S. military service academies must be classified as A-2 if attendance is on behalf of a non-NATO foreign government or as NATO-2 if the attendance is on behalf of a NATO country. Military cadets whose attendance is not on behalf of a foreign government are classifiable as F-1 students are required to present Form I-20 and pay the SEVIS fee.\n\nb. (U) Military personnel coming to the United States for education or training at any armed forces training facility are to be classified as foreign government officials and issued A-2 visas for non-NATO member military personnel, or NATO-2 for NATO member military personnel.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(J)(5) (U) Graduate of Foreign Medical School\n\n(CT:VISA-1628; 09-13-2022)\n\na. (U) Foreign medical graduates seeking to enter temporarily in connection with their profession are not eligible for F-1 visas. Such applicants must apply and qualify for IVs or for exchange visitor (J) or temporary worker (H) visas. See 9 FAM 402.5-6(B) below and 9 FAM 402.10-4(B).\n\nb. (U) At least one school has been approved to issue Forms I-20 to foreign medical graduates for a review-type continuing education course of study in preparation for taking tests in the field of medicine. Foreign medical graduates seeking to enter the United States to take such a review-type course of study who present a Form I-20 from an approved school are classifiable as F-1 students.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(J)(6) (U) Entering the United States for Nursing Training\n\n(CT:VISA-1628; 09-13-2022)\n\n(U) DHS has approved several hospital-affiliated nurses' training schools for nonimmigrant students. In cases where a school has been approved, the application may be considered under INA 101(a)(15)(F).\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(J)(7) (U) Aviation Training\n\n(CT:VISA-1970; 04-22-2024)\n\na. (U) All flight training for initial training or subsequent training that will result in a certificate or rating must be undertaken on an F or M visa. This includes FAA, EASA, and other equivalent certificates.\n\nb. (U) Recurrent or refresher training (training related to an aircraft for which the applicant has already received certification) may be undertaken on a B-1. Recurrent training is the training required for crewmembers to remain adequately trained and currently proficient for each aircraft crewmember position, and type of operation in which the crewmember serves. It often consists of flight simulator training but may also entail classroom training to update pilots on such things as recent safety issues, trends in aviation, and modifications to aircraft configuration or operating procedures. This assumes that the applicant’s employer is covering the recurrent training costs, incidental costs, and that the applicant does not receive a salary or perform labor in the United States.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(K) (U) Applying INA 214(m)\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(K)(1) (U) Public Primary School or a Publicly Funded Adult Education Program\n\n(CT:VISA-1628; 09-13-2022)\n\n(U) Congress imposed limitations on noncitizen attendance in publicly funded institutions in the 1996 immigration legislation. As of November 30, 1996, F-1 visas cannot be issued to persons seeking to enter the United States to attend a public primary school or a publicly funded adult education program. See INA 214(m). This does not, however, bar a dependent of a nonimmigrant in any classification, including F-1, from attendance at a public primary school, an adult education program, or another public educational institution, as appropriate. Under INA 214(m), primary school means kindergarten through 8th grade.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(K)(2) (U) Secondary School\n\n(CT:VISA-1970; 04-22-2024)\n\na. (U) INA 214(m) restricts, but does not prohibit, the issuance of F-1 visas to students seeking to attend public high schools. Secondary school is deemed to be grades 9-12. As of November 30, 1996, two new additional criteria were imposed on intending F-1 students at public high schools:\n\n(1) (U) They cannot attend such school for more than 12 months; and\n\n(2) (U) They must repay the school system for the full, unsubsidized, per capita cost of providing the education to them.\n\nb. (U) You may not issue an F-1 visa for attendance at a public high school if the length of study indicated on the Form I-20 exceeds the 12-month cumulative period permitted under INA 214(m). F-1 visas issued to attend public secondary schools must be limited to 12 months and payment of the full, unsubsidized, per capita cost must be demonstrated before visa issuance.\n\nc. (U) It is important to remember that public secondary school attendance in a status other than F-1 (including unlawful status) does not count against the 12-month limit, nor does attendance in F-1 status before November 30, 1996.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(K)(3) (U) Reimbursement\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. (U) A public school system issuing a Form I-20 for attendance at a secondary school must indicate on the Form I-20 that such payment has been made and the amount of such payment. School districts may not waive or otherwise ignore this requirement. If the Form I-20 does not include the requisite information, the student must have a notarized statement stating the payment has been made and the amount from the designated school official (DSO) who signed the Form I-20. If not, the visa must be refused, under INA 221(g), until the applicant provides the necessary documentation.\n\nb. (U) Although the per capita costs vary from one school district to another (and sometimes from one school to another within the same district), the averages across the country have ranged from about $8,000 to more than $20,000. They run somewhat less than that in Puerto Rico and U.S. territories. These figures are guidelines only and must not be taken as absolutes. If, however, a Form I-20 indicates a repaid cost radically different (for example, something less than $7,000), contact the F/M/J portfolio holder(s) in CA/VO/F/ET to coordinate an inquiry through SEVP.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(K)(4) (U) Noncitizens Under Legal Guardianship of American Citizen Relatives\n\n(CT:VISA-1292; 05-27-2021)\n\n(U) Schools sometimes advise relatives to declare themselves as the noncitizen's legal guardian. The school then admits the foreign student as a resident, wrongfully assuming this would exempt the student from the INA 214(m) requirements. The student's status as a resident of the school district is irrelevant. Likewise, the fact that the student's U.S. sponsor has paid local property/school taxes does not fulfill the reimbursement requirement of INA 214(m).\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(K)(5) (U) Student Visa Abusers\n\n(CT:VISA-1628; 09-13-2022)\n\n(U) INA 212(a)(6)(G) provides sanctions against foreign students who fail to comply with the INA 214(m) requirements. A noncitizen in F-1 status who violates INA 214(m) is excludable until they have been outside the United States for a continuous period of five years after the date of the violation (see 9 FAM 302.9-9). Noncitizens who are not subject to INA 214(m) are not subject to INA 212(a)(6)(G).\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(L) (U) Period of Stay\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(L)(1) (U) For F-1 Applicants\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. (U) An individual entering as an F-1 student or granted a change to that status is usually admitted or given an extension of stay for the duration of status. Duration of status means the time during which the student is pursuing a full course of study and any additional periods of authorized practical training, plus 60 days following completion of the course or practical training within which to depart. Since November 30, 1996, however, the duration of status of an F-1 student in a publicly funded secondary school cannot exceed an aggregate of 12 months schooling (see 9 FAM 402.5-5(K)(2) above).\n\nb. (U) An academic student is in status during the summer between terms, if eligible and intending to register for the next term. The student is expected to resume a full course of study at the commencement of the next term. A student compelled by illness or other medical condition to interrupt or reduce studies is in status until their recovery. The student is expected to resume a full course of study upon recovery.\n\nc. (U) DHS amended its regulations to permit the DHS Secretary to waive the usual limitations, including hours of coursework, on employment for students faced by unexpected severe economic circumstances. Such circumstances could include substantial fluctuations in exchange rates, loss of on-campus employment, loss of other financial assistance through no fault of the student, etc. Students granted such waivers are deemed to be in status until the economic emergency is over and the necessity for such reduced studies has passed.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(L)(2) (U) For M-1 Applicants\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. (U) The period of stay for an M-1 student, whether from admission or through a change of nonimmigrant classification, is the time necessary to complete the course of study indicated on Form I-20 plus 30 days within which to depart, not to exceed one year.\n\nb. (U) An M-1 student may be granted an extension of stay if it is established that the student:\n\n(1) (U) Is a bona fide nonimmigrant currently maintaining student status;\n\n(2) (U) Is able to, and in good faith intends to, continue to maintain that status for the period for which the extension is granted; and\n\n(3) (U) Has compelling educational or medical reasons which resulted in a delay to the course of study. Delays caused by academic probation or suspension are not acceptable reasons for program extension. Cumulative extensions are limited to three years.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(M) (U) Spouse and Child of F-1 or M-1 Student\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(M)(1) (U) Refusals of Spouse and Child of F-1 or M-1 Student\n\n(CT:VISA-1970; 04-22-2024)\n\na. (U) Before issuing an F-2 or M-2 visa to a spouse or child of a principal F-1 or M-1 student, you must be satisfied that the relationship between the principal applicant and the spouse or child exists, and that the spouse or child can be expected to depart from the United States upon completion of approved activities by the F-1 or M-1 principal applicant. See 9 FAM 402.5-5(E) above. Keep in mind that coming to a different conclusion about family members entitled to a derivative nonimmigrant classification and the principal should be rare. See 9 FAM 402.1-4(A). If the derivative F-2 or M-2 is seeking to join an F-1 or M-1 principal applicant already in the United States, you must confirm that the derivative F-2 or M-2 applicants have the requisite nonimmigrant intent and that the family's circumstances have not changed in a way to alter the intent of the principal applicant, to conclude the applicants overcome INA 214(b). See 9 FAM 402.1-4(C).\n\nb. (U) If you doubt an F-1 or M-1 student's intent to return abroad, the student cannot satisfy your doubts by offering to leave a child, spouse, or other dependent abroad. See 9 FAM 402.2-2(B) paragraph b.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(M)(2) (U) Separate Form I-20 and SEVIS Registration Required for Accompanying Spouse and/or Minor, Unmarried Child of F-1 or M-1 Student\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\n(U) Each F-2 or M-2 dependent is required to have their own properly executed Form I-20 and their own unique SEVIS ID number. It is not possible to issue dependent F-2 or M-2 visas based on the principal's Form I-20. The F-2 or M-2 must present this evidence to both you and the immigration officer at the POE. F-2 or M-2 dependents are not required to pay a separate SEVIS fee. Additional details on the SEVIS fee can be found on the SEVP page at the ICE website.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(M)(3) (U) Classification of Spouse or Child Who Will Attend School in the United States\n\n(CT:VISA-1970; 04-22-2024)\n\na. (U) A spouse qualified for an F-2, M-2, or any other derivative nonimmigrant classification may only study if those studies are incidental to the primary purpose of travel: to accompany their spouse to the United States. A spouse in F-2 status, therefore, may only participate in avocational or recreational programs. A spouse of an F-1 visa holder may only enroll in a full-time course of study if they independently qualify under INA 101(a)(15)(F)(i) as a nonimmigrant student.\n\nb. (U) A child qualified for an F-2, M-2, or any other derivative nonimmigrant classification is not required to qualify under INA 101(a)(15)(F)(i) as a nonimmigrant student even though the child will attend school while accompanying the principal (see 9 FAM 402.1-5(C)). Moreover, a child in F-1 status could not qualify to attend a public primary school and would be limited to 12 months of attendance at a public high school. See 9 FAM 302.9-9(B)(1).\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(N) (U) Employment of F-1 and M-1 Student, Spouse, and Children\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(N)(1) (U) On-Campus Employment for F-1 Student\n\n(CT:VISA-1292; 05-27-2021)\n\n(U) An F-1 student may accept on-campus employment with the approval of the designated school official (DSO) in an enterprise operated by or on behalf of the school. The work must take place either at the school or at an educationally affiliated (associated with the school's established curriculum or part of a contractually funded research project at the postgraduate level) off-campus location. Work that takes place at the school location could be for an on-campus commercial business, such as a bookstore or cafeteria, if the work directly provides services for students. Employment located on-campus that does not directly involve services to students (such as construction work) does not qualify as on-campus employment. Work with an employer that is educationally affiliated with the school is on-campus employment even if the work site is not located on the campus (such as a research lab affiliated with the school). Such on-campus employment must not displace an American citizen or LPR. The employment may not exceed 20 hours a week while school is in session but may be full time when school is not in session. The student must be maintaining status. An F-1 student who finishes a program, such as a bachelor's degree, and starts another program of study at the same campus may continue on-campus employment if the student plans to enroll in the new program of study for the next term.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(N)(2) (U) Off-Campus Employment for F-1 Student\n\n(CT:VISA-1970; 04-22-2024)\n\na. (U) An F-1 student may not accept off-campus employment without first applying to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for employment authorization. An F-1 student may be eligible to apply for off-campus employment authorization after completing one full academic year in F-1 status. A student who receives authorization from USCIS for off-campus employment may not work more than 20 hours a week when school is in session. Such employment authorization is automatically terminated if the student fails to maintain status. A designated school official (DSO) must request off-campus employment for an F-1 student in SEVIS in support of the Form I-765 which must be filed with USCIS, and the request will appear in the electronic SEVIS record. To recommend off-campus employment, the DSO must certify that:\n\n(1) (U) The student has been in F-1 status for one full academic year;\n\n(2) (U) The student is in good standing and carrying a full course of study;\n\n(3) (U) The student has established that acceptance of employment will not interfere with the full course of study; and\n\n(4) (U) The prospective employer has submitted a labor and wage attestation, or the student has established a severe economic necessity for employment due to unforeseen circumstances beyond the student’s control.\n\nb. (U) A student who has received approval from USCIS for off-campus employment will have an employment authorization document (EAD) showing the duration of the employment authorization, which may be up to one year at a time. The student’s electronic SEVIS record will also show approval for off-campus employment.\n\nc. (U) If a student who has been granted off-campus employment authorization temporarily leaves the country during the period when employment is authorized, such employment can be resumed upon return. The student must, however, be returning to the same school.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(N)(3) (U) Employment as Part of Curricular or Alternate Work/Study Practical Training for F-1 Student\n\n(CT:VISA-1757; 04-17-2023)\n\n(U) A student enrolled in a college or other academic institution having alternate work/study courses as part of the curriculum within the student's program of study may participate in and be compensated for such practical training when authorized for curricular practical training (CPT) by the designated school official (DSO). Students may not begin such training before endorsement of their electronic SEVIS record by the DSO with such authorization. Periods of actual off-campus employment in a work/study program are considered practical training. Students who have engaged in a full year of full-time CPT will not receive authorization to engage in optional practical training (OPT) after completion of the course of study.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(N)(4) (U) Practical Training\n\n(CT:VISA-1757; 04-17-2023)\n\na. (U) Students are eligible for practical training only after they have completed a full academic year in an approved college-level institution, except for graduate students whose program requires them to participate immediately in curricular practical training (CPT). Students in English language training programs are ineligible for practical training. Optional practical training (OPT) is training that is directly related to an F-1 student’s major area of study. It is intended to provide a student with practical experience in their field of study during or upon completion of a degree program and is authorized through the recommendation of the designated school official (DSO) and the filing of Form I-765 with USCIS and subsequent issuance of an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) by USCIS. CPT is employment that is an integral part of a student's specified curriculum. In most cases, CPT involves internships and similar work experience specifically required by the student's program of study. The DSO must authorize CPT before the student begins work. See the SEVP website for more information on practical training.\n\nb. (U) Any authorization for employment for purposes of practical training is suspended in the event of a certified strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage at the place of employment.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(N)(5) (U) Optional Practical Training\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. (U) An F-1 student may apply for OPT in a job related to their major area of study. OPT may be authorized pre- and post-completion and on a full-time or part-time basis. During school vacations, either part-time or full-time OPT is permissible. When school is in session, OPT may not exceed 20 hours per week. An F-1 student may request post-completion OPT after completion of all course requirements not including thesis or equivalent, or after completion of all requirements for graduation. Post-completion OPT must be full time. Such training must be completed within 12 months, although certain F-1 students may be eligible for an extension of post-completion OPT based on their major field of study or a pending change of status to H-1B. In addition to a DSO's request for OPT which will appear in the student's electronic SEVIS record, the student must apply to USCIS using Form I-765 for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). If the student makes a brief trip abroad during a period of post-completion OPT, a valid F-1 visa, the unexpired EAD, the endorsed Form I-20, and the electronic SEVIS record will be required for reentry to complete the training. A letter of employment may also be required. F-1 students may also travel abroad during the period following the completion of their academic programs while they have a pending request for OPT, which will appear in their electronic SEVIS record, but such travel should be undertaken with caution. USCIS may send a request for evidence to the U.S. address on the OPT application while the applicant is away. Additionally, if USCIS approves the application, the applicant will be expected to have the EAD in hand to reenter the United States. Like a request for evidence, USCIS can only send the EAD to a U.S. address.\n\nb. (U) OPT is different from curricular practical training (CPT), which is part of a student's degree curriculum and can only be authorized during a student's course of study. OPT, by contrast, can be authorized during the student's degree program, as well as after graduation.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(N)(6) (U) Extension of OPT for Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics (STEM) Students, and H-1B Beneficiaries (“Cap Gap”)\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. (U) Effective May 10, 2008, until May 9, 2016, USCIS could grant an OPT extension of 17 months, for a maximum of 29 months, to an eligible F-1 student on post-completion OPT with a degree in a DHS-approved science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) field.\n\nb. (U) Effective May 10, 2016, an F-1 student with a bachelor's or higher degree in a DHS-approved STEM field who is already in a period of approved post-completion OPT may apply to USCIS to extend that period by 24 months, for a maximum of 36 months. Eligibility for this extension is based upon the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code for the student’s degree program as indicated on the Form I-20, on an official transcript, or as shown in SEVIS (including for eligibility based on a previously obtained degree) and whether the CIP code for the degree program is included on the DHS-approved list of qualifying degree program categories for the extension, which can be found on the SEVP website. Students are also required to complete Form I-983, Training Plan for STEM OPT Students, with their employer and submit it to the DSO. See the SEVP website for more information on Form I-983. The DSO must verify the student's eligibility, including ensuring that Form I-983 has been properly completed and executed, recommend the extension through SEVIS, and provide the student with a Form I-20 annotated with the recommendation. Once the DSO recommends the extension, the student must submit a Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and all appropriate fees to USCIS. Additional information can be found on the USCIS website.\n\nc. (U) F-1 students on post-completion OPT must report all employment and periods of unemployment to their DSOs, who then report the information in SEVIS on the student’s record. F-1 students participating in post-completion OPT are initially allowed an aggregate period of unemployment of 90 days. Students on a 24-month STEM OPT extension are allowed an additional 60 days of unemployment, for a total of 150 days. This measure allows time for job searches or a break when switching employers. See the SEVP OPT policy guidance on the SEVP website for more information on how unemployment is counted.\n\nd. (U) If the F-1 student has filed a Form I-765 for a 24-month extension in a timely manner before their end of regular post-completion OPT, then the student's OPT employment authorization is automatically extended for 180 days. This extension ends once USCIS adjudicates the STEM OPT application. If USCIS approves the STEM OPT extension the student is provided with a new EAD reflecting the extension dates. If the petition is denied, the student's period of OPT ends.\n\ne. (U) As the STEM OPT extension is automatic for the first 180 days following regular post-completion OPT (when the student has properly filed Form I-765), the student may not necessarily have a renewed EAD. Therefore, any students having automatically authorized employment through filing for the STEM OPT extension may not be able to present a valid EAD when they apply to renew their visa. However, F-1 students in this situation can request an updated Form I-20 from the DSO, annotated for the STEM OPT extension, as well as proof that the I-765 petition was filed in a timely manner. You must confirm that the student's electronic SEVIS record contains the same information as the updated hard copy Form I-20 before issuing a visa.\n\nf. (U) The STEM Designated Degree Program List provides degree program categories approved for the 24-month STEM OPT extension and significant additional information.\n\ng. (U) If an F-1 student is the intended beneficiary of a timely filed Form I-129 petition for a cap-subject H-1B visa to start on October 1, the F-1 status and any OPT authorization held on the eligibility date is automatically extended to dates determined by USCIS that allow for receipt or approval of the petition, up to September 30. The Cap Gap OPT Extension is automatic, and USCIS will not provide the student with a renewed EAD. However, F-1 students in this situation can request an updated Form I-20 from the DSO, annotated for the Cap Gap OPT Extension, as well as proof that the Form I-129 petition was timely filed. Verify that the electronic SEVIS record has also been updated before issuing a visa.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(N)(7) (U) Practical Training for M-1 Student\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\n(U) Except for temporary employment for practical training as set forth herein, an M-1 student may not accept employment. Practical training may only be authorized at the completion of an M-1 course of study. An M-1 student who desires temporary employment for practical training must apply to USCIS by filing Form I-765. If approval is granted, DHS will endorse the student's Form I-20 with the dates the authorization for practical training begins and ends. Because M-1 students are admitted until a certain date, an M-1 student may need to also file Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, to apply for an extension of M-1 status in conjunction with the application for employment authorization. Verify that the electronic SEVIS record has been updated before issuing a new visa.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(N)(8) (U) Temporary Absence of F-1 or M-1 Student with Pending or Granted Practical Training\n\n(CT:VISA-1757; 04-17-2023)\n\na. (U) An F-1 or M-1 student authorized to accept employment for practical training who leaves the country temporarily may be readmitted for the remainder of the authorized period. The student must be returning solely to perform the authorized training. Additionally, a student may travel abroad and be readmitted while the request for practical training is pending with USCIS, but such travel should be undertaken with caution. USCIS may send a request for evidence to the U.S. address on the application while the applicant is away. Additionally, if USCIS approves the practical training application, the applicant will be expected to have the Employment Authorization Document (EAD) in hand to reenter the United States. Like a request for evidence, USCIS can only send the EAD to a U.S. address.\n\nb. (U) A valid F-1 or M-1 visa, the Form I-20, EAD (if issued), and an accurate electronic SEVIS record are required to reenter the United States for practical training purposes. A letter of employment may also be required. For individuals attempting to travel abroad and be readmitted while an application for the STEM OPT extension is pending, the Form I-20 should be endorsed for reentry by the DSO within the last six months.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(N)(9) (U) Employment of F-2 and M-2 Spouse and Children\n\n(CT:VISA-1; 11-18-2015)\n\n(U) The F-2 spouse and children of an F-1 student may not accept employment. The M-2 spouse and children of an M-1 student may not accept employment.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(O) (U) F-3 and M-3 Nonimmigrant Visa Classifications\n\n(CT:VISA-1757; 04-17-2023)\n\na. (U) The Border Commuter Student Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-274), which was signed into law on November 2, 2002, amended INA 101(a)(15)(F) and (J) to create the F-3 and M-3 NIV categories for Canadian and Mexican citizens and residents who commute to the United States for study at a DHS-approved school located within 75 miles of the U.S. border. These students are permitted to study on either a full-time or part-time basis. Until further notice, applicants applying to study in the United States who present a valid Form I-20, have an electronic SEVIS record in INITIAL or ACTIVE status, and will commute to school; i.e., not reside in the United States while attending classes, are to be processed as F-1/M-1 students, and the annotation \"border commuter\" placed on the visa foil.\n\nb. (U) The family members of border commuter students are not entitled to derivative F-2 or M-2 status, given that these students do not reside in the United States.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(P) (U) Temporary Absence\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(P)(1) (U) Applicants Who Apply While Abroad for an F-1 or M-1 Visa\n\n(CT:VISA-1628; 09-13-2022)\n\n(U) Except as provided below, a student making a short trip abroad during an authorized period of study, who needs to obtain a new visa during such absence, must present their Form I-20, properly executed and endorsed. You must verify that the SEVIS record of the applicant is in ACTIVE status. If otherwise qualified, the applicant may be issued the appropriate visa.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(P)(2) (U) Temporary Absence of Applicants Applying Abroad for Attendance at School Other than Listed on the Visa\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\n(U) A student temporarily abroad who intends to return to study at a United States institution other than the one for which the original visa was issued may seek admission with the original visa, if still valid, and the Form I-20 from the new school. If the student wishes to apply for a new visa, however, they must present proof that the transfer has been completed and the student is in “initial” or “active” status at the new school. Verify that the applicant has a valid SEVIS record showing the applicant is in INITIAL or ACTIVE status at the new institution and that the SEVIS fee has been paid on the new record before issuing a new student visa.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(P)(3) (U) Renewing F or M Visas for Returning Students\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\n(U) Where applicable, returning students may be eligible to apply under interview waiver authority (see 9 FAM 403.5-4(A)(1)). You usually should renew F or M visas to returning students who have remained in status and have not had any significant changes in either their academic program or their personal circumstances. When a foreign student engaged in study takes a short trip abroad and requires a visa to return to the United States, you are encouraged to issue visas, if the student is otherwise qualified, to allow the student to complete their study. Verify that the student's SEVIS record is in ACTIVE status before issuing a new visa.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(Q) (U) Processing F and M Visas\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(Q)(1) (U) Issue Full Validity Student Visas\n\n(CT:VISA-1837; 09-26-2023)\n\nUnavailable\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(Q)(2) (U) Maintenance of Status and Departure Bond\n\n(CT:VISA-432; 08-08-2017)\n\n(U) See 9 FAM 403.9-8.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(Q)(3) (U) Automatic Extension of Validity of Visa\n\n(CT:VISA-432; 08-08-2017)\n\n(U) See 9 FAM 403.9-4(E).\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(R) (U) Visa Annotations\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(R)(1) (U) Name of School and SEVIS ID\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\n(U) An initial F-1 or M-1 visa must be annotated with the SEVIS ID and the name of the institution the student will initially attend. Ensure that the SEVIS ID is correctly annotated on the visa foil. Inform an applicant who has been accepted by more than one institution that the visa application will be considered only based on the Form I-20 issued by the school which the applicant will attend. Also advise the applicant that the immigration inspector at the POE can refuse admission for a student seeking an initial entry with a Form I-20 from a school other than the one named on the visa or if the student indicates an intention to attend a different institution.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(R)(2) (U) Entry of Student Before Enrollment\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. Unavailable\n\nb. (U) A student who wants to travel to the United States more than 30 days in advance of their program start date must obtain a visa in a different classification and seek admission under that other visa.\n\nc. (U) If a B-2 visa is issued, advise the applicant that, if admitted to the United States as a B-2 visitor, they are required to obtain a change of nonimmigrant status from USCIS to that of an F, M, or J student, as applicable, before their program start date.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(R)(3) (U) Entry When School Not Selected\n\n(CT:VISA-1090; 06-24-2020)\n\n(U) A prospective student applicant who has neither been issued a Form I-20 nor made a final selection of a school may wish to travel to the United States for the primary purpose of selecting a school. If the applicant qualifies for a visitor visa, and would appear to qualify for a student visa, a B-2 visa may be issued for this purpose of travel.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-5(R)(4) (U) Admitted Student Traveling Without Form I-20\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. (U) A signed hard copy Form I-20 must be presented at the POE for a student to be admitted in F or M status.\n\nb. (U) When a student has documentary evidence that admission to a school has been granted, and when circumstances warrant visa issuance before the hard copy Form I-20 has been received, you may issue an F-1 visa based on the electronic SEVIS record. The electronic SEVIS record must show that the visa applicant is in INITIAL or ACTIVE student status and that the SEVIS I-901 fee has been paid. Enter a case note stating that you have reviewed the electronic SEVIS record and advised the student to carry the hard copy Form I-20 when travelling.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-6 (U) Exchange Visitors – J Visas\n\n9 FAM 402.5-6(A) (U) Statutory and Regulatory Authorities\n\n9 FAM 402.5-6(A)(1) (U) Immigration and Nationality Act\n\n(CT:VISA-1; 11-18-2015)\n\n(U) INA 101(a)(15)(J) (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(J)); INA 212(e) (8 U.S.C. 1182(e)); INA 212(j) (8 U.S.C. 1182(j)); INA 214(b) (8 U.S.C. 1184(b)); INA 214(l) (8 U.S.C. 1184(l)).\n\n9 FAM 402.5-6(A)(2) Code of Federal Regulations\n\n(CT:VISA-1; 11-18-2015)\n\n(U) 22 CFR 41.62; 22 CFR 41.63; 22 CFR Part 62.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-6(B) (U) The Exchange Visitor Program\n\n9 FAM 402.5-6(B)(1) (U) Overview\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. (U) The purpose of the Exchange Visitor Program (J visa program) is to further the foreign policy interests of the United States by increasing the mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries by means of mutual educational and cultural exchanges. The goal is to meet this purpose while protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the foreign nationals participating in the Program as exchange visitors. Only organizations that have been designated by ECA, may participate.\n\nb. (U) The Exchange Visitor Program is administered under the oversight of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Private Sector Exchange. The Office of Private Sector Exchange Designation, the Office of Exchange Coordination and Compliance, and the Office of Private Sector Exchange Administration are located at:\n\nBureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs\n\nDepartment of State\n\nState Annex SA-4E\n\n2430 E Street, NW\n\nWashington, DC 20522\n\nc. (U) Detailed guidance can be found on the Exchange Visitor Program at j1visa.state.gov.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-6(B)(2) (U) Mandatory Exchange Visitor Classification in Certain Cases\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. (U) Participants in exchange visitor programs sponsored by USAID (program serial numbers G-1 and G-2, respectively) are supported by U.S. government funding. These participants must be documented as exchange visitors (J visa) rather than in another visa category (such as F-1 student), even if they qualify for that visa category. Participants in exchange visitor programs sponsored by other U.S. government agencies (program serial number G-3) or participants in a federally funded national research and development center program (program serial number G-7), must also be documented as exchange visitors if participation is directly financed in whole or in part by the sponsoring agency. The only exception to these rules requiring J classification is for an applicant who would otherwise qualify for an A-1 or A-2 visa. Such applicants must always be issued A visas, rather than J visas, regardless of the funding of their travel. See 9 FAM 402.3-4(A) regarding the rule that there is no alternative to A or G visa classification. Contact CA/VO/F/ET for additional guidance, if required.\n\nb. (U) You may receive visa applications from individuals seeking to participate in exchange programs or conferences that will be funded by a U.S. government agency, but the applicant does not present a Form DS-2019 as the program does not have ECA designation. As such, these applications cannot qualify for J-1 classification. You must determine whether the applicant qualifies for another visa classification appropriate for the purpose of travel, usually a B visa. See 9 FAM 402.2-5(B). Do not instruct applicants that they must apply for a J-1 visa, even if the planned travel is funded by the U.S. government, if the program does not have an ECA designation. Contact L/CA with classification-specific questions.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-6(C) (U) Qualifying for an Exchange Visitor Visa (J-1)\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\n(U) An applicant applying for a visa under INA 101(a)(15)(J) must meet the following requirements to qualify for an exchange visitor visa:\n\n(1) (U) Acceptance to a designated exchange visitor program, as evidenced by presentation of Form DS-2019, Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-1) Status (see 9 FAM 402.5-6(D) below);\n\n(2) (U) Sufficient funds, or adequate arrangements made by a host organization, to cover expenses;\n\n(3) (U) Sufficient proficiency in the English language to participate in their program and compliance with the requirements of INA 212(j) (see 9 FAM 402.5-6(G) below);\n\n(4) (U) Present intent to leave the United States at conclusion of program (see 9 FAM 402.5-6(F) below);\n\n(5) (U) Possession of qualifications for the program offered (see 9 FAM 402.5-6(E) below); and\n\n(6) (U) Compliance with INA 212(e) if applicable (see 9 FAM 302.13-2 and 22 CFR 41.63). Annotate the Form DS-2019 (see 9 FAM 402.5-6(D)(2) paragraph b below and annotate the visa (see 9 FAM 402.5-6(I)(6) below) accordingly.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-6(D) (U) Form DS-2019, Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-Nonimmigrant) Status\n\n9 FAM 402.5-6(D)(1) (U) The Basic Form\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. (U) Form DS-2019, Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-Nonimmigrant) Status, is the document required to support an application for an exchange visitor visa (J-1). It is a two-page document which can only be produced through SEVIS. SEVIS is the DHS database developed to collect information on F, M, and J visa holders (see 9 FAM 402.5-4 above and 9 FAM 402.5-6(J) below). The prospective exchange visitor’s signature on page one of the Form DS-2019 is required. Page two of Form DS-2019 consists of instructions and certification language relating to participation. Form DS-2019 is generated with a unique identifier known as a “SEVIS ID number” in the top right-hand corner, which consists of an “alpha” character (N) and 10 numerical characters (e.g., N0002123457).\n\nb. (U) ECA/EC/D designates U.S. organizations to conduct exchange visitor programs. These organizations are known as program sponsors. Designated sponsors have access to SEVIS and the capability of generating Forms DS-2019 from SEVIS. Effective April 27, 2023, designated sponsors are permitted to use digital signatures and electronically transmit Form DS-2019 directly to exchange visitors. As of this date, consular sections should accept printed versions of the digitally signed copy of Form DS-2019 for all J applicants. Sponsors also may print, physically sign paper forms in any color ink, and continue to mail the forms or scan the signed forms (e.g., into portable document format (PDF) files) and transmit them electronically. Sponsors may also digitally sign and electronically transmit Forms DS-2019 to eligible J-2 spouses or children of an exchange visitor.\n\nc. (U) J visa applicants must continue to present a signed paper Form DS-2019 at their visa interview and at the POE when they travel to the United States. If there are minor errors on the form (e.g., a program begin date that is off by one day), you can process the case using that form. You must verify the applicant's SEVIS record in the SEVIS report in CCD. If corrections are needed, they may be made electronically; there is no need to request a new hard copy of the Form DS-2019. Make a case note to alert CBP that the electronic record has been updated. Once the visa is issued, however, the SEVIS record cannot be updated until the participant’s program is validated (“Active” in SEVIS). See 22 CFR 62.13(a). The sponsor is required to update the SEVIS record upon the exchange visitor's entry and no corrections to the record can be made until that time. In addition, in the event a visa is needed for a spouse or a minor child and the primary's J-1 visa has already been issued, the system will not permit new Forms DS-2019 to be created until after the sponsor validates the primary applicant's SEVIS record.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-6(D)(2) (U) Processing of Form DS-2019, Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-1) Status\n\n(CT:VISA-1741; 03-30-2023)\n\na. (U) The Form DS-2019, also known as Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-1) Status, indicates the visa applicant understands all conditions of the stay in the United States in J status and understands also that a consular or immigration officer will make a preliminary determination as to whether the applicant is subject to the two-year home country physical presence requirement. Before the visa is issued, the applicant must sign the bottom of page one of the Form DS-2019 certifying they agree to comply with that requirement if it is determined to be applicable.\n\nb. (U) A consular or immigration officer makes the preliminary determination regarding the applicability to the two-year home country physical presence requirement under INA 212(e) after a personal interview with the individual unless personal appearance has been waived under 9 FAM 403.5-4(A). The consular or immigration officer signs page one of Form DS-2019 indicating the determination made by the officer. The Department's Waiver Review Division (CA/VO/DO/W) reserves the authority to make the final determination whether to issue a favorable recommendation to DHS to waive the two-year requirement under INA 212(e).\n\n9 FAM 402.5-6(D)(3) (U) Serial Numbers of Designated Exchange Visitor Programs\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\n(U) When ECA/EC/D designates an organization or agency as a sponsor, it is enrolled in SEVIS and assigned a unique program serial number (referred to as the program number) that is used to identify the specific program. The sponsor number is assigned based upon the following series:\n\n(1) (U) G-1―Department of State;\n\n(2) (U) G-2―U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID);\n\n(3) (U) G-3―Other U.S. Federal agencies;\n\n(4) (U) G-4―International agencies or organizations in which the U.S. government participates;\n\n(5) (U) G-5―Other national, State, or local government agencies;\n\n(6) (U) G-7―Federally funded national research and development center or a U.S. Federal laboratory;\n\n(7) (U) P-1―Educational institutions, e.g., schools, colleges, universities, seminaries, libraries, museums, and institutions devoted to scientific and technological research;\n\n(8) (U) P-2―Hospitals and related institutions;\n\n(9) (U) P-3―Nonprofit organizations, associations, foundations, and institutions (academic institutions conducting training programs can be classified as a P-3 if they are nonprofit); and\n\n(10) (U) P-4―For-profit organizations (business and industrial concerns).\n\n9 FAM 402.5-6(D)(4) (U) Requirement for Form DS-2019 in Case of Spouse and/or Minor, Unmarried Children\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. (U) Each accompanying J-2 spouse or child of a principal J-1 is required to have a separate Form DS-2019 issued by the program sponsor and will have their own unique SEVIS ID number. You may not issue dependent J-2 visas based on the principal’s (J-1’s) Form DS-2019.\n\nb. (U) A minor, unmarried child qualified for J-2 status is not required to qualify under INA 101(a)(15)(F)(i) as a nonimmigrant student even though the child will attend school while accompanying the principal J-1. See 9 FAM 402.1-5(C).\n\nc. (U) The J-2 applicant must present their Form DS-2019 to you during the visa interview, and to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the POE.\n\nd. (U) Participants in the Summer Work Travel, camp counselor, au pair, and high school exchange programs are not expected to be accompanied by dependents. If you receive a Form DS-2019 supporting a J-2 visa application from an individual claiming such status, contact CA/VO/F/ET for guidance.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-6(D)(5) (U) Processing of Form DS-2019, Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-1) Status, at Port of Entry (POE)\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. (U) After a J-1 visa has been issued, return the completed Form DS-2019 to the exchange visitor. Inform the exchange visitor that they must carry Form DS-2019 on their person for presentation to the CBP officer at the U.S. POE. At each admission to the United States, an exchange visitor must present the Form DS-2019 along with the visa to the CBP officer. Upon the exchange visitor’s arrival in the United States, the CBP officer will examine the visa, the Form DS-2019, and any supporting documentation and return the documents to the exchange visitor.\n\nb. (U) If the exchange visitor is admitted, DHS will return the Form DS-2019 to the individual. The exchange visitor must always safeguard the form. If the exchange visitor loses the Form DS-2019, they must obtain a replacement from the designated sponsor.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-6(D)(6) (U) Sample Form DS-2019\n\n(CT:VISA-1090; 06-24-2020)\n\na. (U) J-1 Principal Applicant Sample: For a sample of a properly completed DS-2019 for a J-1 Principal, click here, Sample DS-2019 for J-1.\n\nb. (U) J-2 Dependent Sample: For a sample of a properly completed DS-2019 for a J-2 dependent click here, Sample DS-2019 for J-2.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-6(D)(7) (U) Form DS-7002, Training/Internship Placement Plan\n\n(CT:VISA-1837; 09-26-2023)\n\na. (U) The Form DS-7002, Training/Internship Placement Plan (T/IPP), is designed to standardize applications in the Trainee, Intern, and College and University Student Intern categories and to increase transparency and accountability and curb potential abuse by having all three concerned parties― the exchange visitor, the U.S. sponsor, and the entity providing the training or internship sign the Form DS-7002 acknowledging the program plan and their regulatory responsibilities.\n\nb. (U) You may wish to use the Form DS-7002 to help in formulating interview questions, but you are not required to verify the contents of the form.\n\nc. (U) Electronic signatures (including faxed signatures) are permissible on Form DS-7002, and you should accept these as they adjudicate applications.\n\nd. (U) The form requires each participant to have U.S. contact information. As some prospective exchange program participants may not have this information at the visa interview, you may accept the contact details for the participant’s host organization in the United States instead.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-6(D)(8) (U) Sample Form DS-7002\n\n(CT:VISA-1741; 03-30-2023)\n\n(U) To see the Form DS-7002 see myData.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-6(E) (U) Categories of Exchange Visitors\n\n(CT:VISA-2048; 08-15-2024)\n\na. (U) At present, the Department has 15 exchange categories in which foreign nationals may participate. Participants may only engage in activities authorized for their program.\n\nb. (U) The following sections list these categories in alphabetical order with a brief description of key points.\n\nc. (U) The presentation of a valid Form DS-2019 by the visa applicant constitutes evidence that the individual was determined by the designated U.S. program sponsor to be qualified to participate in the specific exchange program. Verify the Form DS-2019 in the electronic SEVIS report in the CCD and determine that the applicant's record is in either INITIAL or ACTIVE status and that the SEVIS I-901 fee has been paid. Also note the program end date as it appears in the electronic record and ensure that the J visa is issued with a validity that corresponds to the program end or to the reciprocity schedule for the country of the applicant's nationality, whichever is shorter. See 9 FAM 402.5-6(I)(6).\n\n9 FAM 402.5-6(E)(1) (U) Noncitizen Physician\n\n(CT:VISA-1628; 09-13-2022)\n\na. (U) Noncitizen Physician: This category is for foreign national medical graduates pursuing American medical board certification through graduate education and training at accredited U.S. schools of medicine or other U.S. institutions through a clinical exchange program.\n\nb. (U) The Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) is the only program sponsor authorized to use this category. Foreign medical graduates under this category must successfully complete examinations administered by ECFMG that measure their command of English and the medical sciences.\n\nc. (U) All foreign medical graduates sponsored in the category of Alien Physician are subject to the 2-year home-country physical presence requirement. See 9 FAM 402.5-6(L) below.\n\nd. (U) Exception to ECFMG sponsorship: A foreign physician may be sponsored by a designated sponsor other than ECFMG (e.g., a U.S. university, academic medical center, school of public health, or other public health institution) as a “research scholar” only if the dean of the accredited U.S. medical school or their designee certifies the following 5 points, and such certification is appended to the Form DS-2019 issued to the prospective exchange visitor Alien Physician:\n\n(1) (U) The program is predominantly involved with observation, consultation, teaching, or research;\n\n(2) (U) Any incidental patient contact will be under the direct supervision of a U.S. citizen or LPR physician who is licensed to practice medicine in the State in which the activity is taking place;\n\n(3) (U) The foreign national physician will not be given final responsibility for the diagnosis and treatment of patients;\n\n(4) (U) Any activities will conform fully with the State licensing requirements and regulations for medical and health care professionals in the State in which the program is being pursued; and\n\n(5) (U) Any experience gained will not be credited towards any clinical requirements for medical specialty board certification. In such cases, the program sponsor’s letter of designation will explicitly authorize the sponsor to issue Form DS-2019 using the Research Scholar category. The duration of participation as a Research Scholar is limited to 5 years unless the Department approves a program extension for a G-7-sponsored exchange visitor.\n\ne. (U) Duration: The duration of participation is limited to seven years, unless specifically authorized by the Department (ECA/EC). Such authorization will be indicated by an active SEVIS status with the same SEVIS number and an extended program end date.\n\nf. (U) Exchange Visitor Program Regulation: See 22 CFR 62.27.\n\n9 FAM 402.5-6(E)(2) (U) Au Pair\n\n(CT:VISA-1837; 09-26-2023)\n\na. (U) Au Pair: This category is for a foreign national age 18-26 entering the United States for a period of one year to reside with an American host family, or the family of an LPR, while participating in their home life and providing limited childcare services. Au Pair applicants who are 26 years of age at the time of the program start date are eligible to participate in the Au Pair program. The Au Pair is also required to enroll and attend classes offered by an accredited U.S. postsecondary institution for not less than 6 semester hours of academic credit, or the equivalent. As a condition of participation, host-families must agree to facilitate the enrollment and attendance of the Au Pair and to pay the cost of such academic course work in an amount not to exceed $500. Au Pairs may enroll in appropriate course work after they arrive on the program and are not required to have a plan in place at the time of visa interview for the course work they intend to enroll in. Failure to adhere to the education component is grounds for termination of the Au Pair from the program by the sponsor.\n\nb. (U) EduCare: The regulations governing the Au Pair category were amended to create a subcategory called EduCare. This component is specifically designed for families with school-aged children requiring limited childcare assistance. Au Pairs participating in the EduCare component may not be placed with families having pre-school-aged children unless alternative arrangements are in place for these children. EduCare participants may not work more than 10 hours a day/30 hours a week. They must complete a minimum of 12 semester hours of academic credit, or its equivalent, during their program. Host families provide the first $1,000 to the Au Pair toward the cost of the educational component. EduCare Au Pairs may enroll in appropriate course work after they arrive on the program and are not required to have a plan in place at the time of visa interview for the course work, they intend to enroll in.\n\nc. (U) No Family Placement: Au Pairs are not to be placed in the homes of family/relatives, irrespective of the distance in relations (e.g., third cousin, great aunt and/or uncle, etc.).\n\nd. (U) Duration: The duration of participation is limited to one year/one sponsor only, unless specifically authorized by the Department (ECA/EC). Such authorization will be indicated by an active SEVIS status with the same SEVIS number as the applicant’s"
