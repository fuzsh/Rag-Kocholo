        "text": "Approximately 30,000 records are included in the PubMed journal list which is updated daily and includes all MEDLINEÂ® titles as well as other non-MEDLINE titles in PubMed. The PubMed journal list covers the entire span of MEDLINE, not just currently indexed journals. The non-MEDLINE journals include those whose content is deposited in PMC (PubMed Central). PMC is also the repository for author manuscripts that are required under the NIH Public Access Policy to be deposited when the research is funded by NIH. Certain other government agencies or funding organizations use PMC for their Public Access Policy requirements as well.\n\nNLM creates a cataloging record for every journal with a full text article in PMC. Therefore, while most MEDLINE journals over the years have citations for all substantive content published, some of the non-MEDLINE journals may contribute far fewer citations over the years.\n\nA few notes about the PubMed journal list:\n\nThe list is offered in different formats; see: How do I know if my journal is indexed in MEDLINE/PubMed?\n\nThe records are not in alphabetical order.\n\nThe JrId is a sequential identifier number for the journals that appear in various NCBI databases; therefore, the PubMed journal list has gaps in the JrID range. The bottom JrID number does not equal the total number of records in the file.\n\nFull journal title names may contain initial grammar articles (e.g., The, An, A) which may affect use of these data for searching and filing purposes.\n\nThe NlmId is the accession number for the journal cataloging record in the NLM bibliographic database. LocatorPlus and the NLM Catalog on the NCBI Entrez system are public interfaces to NLM bibliographic data.\n\nMedAbbr is a short form of the full journal title; it is assigned whether the title is a MEDLINE journal or not.\n\nISO Abbreviations are constructed at NLM to assist NCBI in linking from GenBank to PubMed.\n\nSample Entries:\n\nExample of a MEDLINE journal:\n\nJrId: 596\n\nJournalTitle: Annals of internal medicine.\n\nMedAbbr: Ann Intern Med\n\nISSN (Print): 0003-4819\n\nISSN (Online): 1539-3704\n\nIsoAbbr: Ann.
