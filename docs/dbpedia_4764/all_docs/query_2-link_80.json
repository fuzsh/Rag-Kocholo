ISSN records are stored in a reference database – the ISSN Portal. The numeric code itself has no meaning, no connotation to the origin or content of the serial.\n\nWhat is ISSN for?\n\nYou can use ISSN in citations from peer-reviewed journals.\n\nISSN is used as an identification code for computer processing, retrieval and data transfer purposes.\n\nISSN is used by libraries to identify and order journals, for interlibrary loan and file cataloging needs.\n\nThe ISSN is the basic data for efficient electronic delivery of documents.\n\nThe ISSN can be used to create a GTIN 13 barcode according to CSN 97 7116 for the distribution of periodicals. Detailed information on the GS1 Czech Republic website\n\nRelated regulations\n\nISO 3297 (Information and documentation – International standard serial number) defines a standard code (ISSN) to uniquely identify serial publications (continuing resources).\n\nNo copyright is derived from the assignment of ISSNs or from their use in place of or in connection with the publications they represent (see ISO 3297 clause 5.10).\n\nAct No 46/2000 Coll., as amended (the Press Act), regulates the obligations of publishers of periodicals, including the obligation to register printed periodicals (distributed publicly and published at least twice a year or more frequently) with the Ministry of Culture, Department of Media and Audiovisual. This Act does not yet regulate the obligations of publishers of online periodicals (continuing sources), nor does it authorise any institution to register or register them.\n\nCSN 97 7116 (Barcodes – Marking serial publications with the GTIN system barcode).\n\nFor more information on ISSN and its general assignment criteria, please refer to the ISSN Manual of the ISSN International Centre.\n\nUpdated: March 27, 2024"
