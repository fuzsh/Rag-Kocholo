        "text": "General Information\n\nWhere can I use my pass?\n\nThe passes are valid at more than 2,000 Federal recreation sites where Entrance or Standard Amenity Fee(s) (Day use fees) are charged by the following agencies:\n\nBureau of Land Management (BLM) http://www.blm.gov\n\nBureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) http://www.usbr.gov\n\nFish and Wildlife Service (FWS) http://www.fws.gov\n\nUSDA Forest Service (USDA FS) http://www.fs.usda.gov\n\nNational Park Service (NPS) http://www.nps.gov\n\nUS Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) http://www.usace.army.mil\n\nHow do I show my pass at a site that doesn't have an entrance station?\n\nAt Federal recreation sites that don't have entrance stations you need to display your pass or show proof of pass ownership to compliance officers via one of the two following methods:\n\nHANGTAGS\n\nA pass can either be displayed on your rearview mirror using a free hangtag or on your dashboard with the signature side showing. Remember, the hangtag itself is only a way to display your Pass, and is not valid for entry unless it holds a valid Pass.\n\nDECALS\n\nIf you own an open-topped vehicle (jeep, motorcycle, etc.) you may obtain a free decal to attach to your vehicle that will serve as proof of payment at sites that don't have a staffed entrance station.\n\nDecals are issued on annual basis, even for owners of lifetime Senior/Access passes\n\nDecals are NOT valid for entry at staffed entrance sites - you MUST show your pass\n\nDecals must be obtained in person and you must show the following: your Pass, driver's license and vehicle registration. The name on all three documents must match.\n\nAll sites that issue passes issue free hangtags\n\nWhat is the National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass or \"Interagency\" Pass Program?\n\nA suite of annual and lifetime passes that provides U.S. citizens and visitors an affordable and convenient way to access Federal recreation lands. Up to 100% of the Pass program's proceeds are used to improve and enhance visitor recreation services.\n\nWhat passes and materials are included in the program?\n\nAnnual Pass ($80.00 - anyone 16 years and older can purchase)\n\nSenior-Lifetime Pass ($80.00 - valid for the lifetime of the pass owner; must be 62+ older, U.S. citizen, or a permanent resident)\n\nSenior-Annual Pass ($20 - valid for one year from month of purchase; must be 62+ older, U.S. citizen, or a permanent resident)\n\nAccess Pass (Free- Valid for lifetime of the pass owner; must have medically determined permanent disability, U.S. citizens or permanent resident)\n\nMilitary-Lifetime Pass (Free– valid for lifetime of the pass owner; issued to Gold Star Families and Veterans with valid documentation; review Military-Lifetime Pass section below to see who qualifies and what documentation is required).\n\nMilitary-Annual Pass (Free – valid for one year from month of purchase; issued to current U.S. military and dependents with valid documentation; review Military-Annual Pass section to see who qualifies and what documentation is required).\n\nVolunteer Pass (Free – valid for one year from month of issue; earned with 250+ hours of volunteer service in public lands)\n\nHangtags (used as way to display passes at areas without entrance booth staff)\n\nAnnual Decals (for open-top vehicles to display at areas without entrance booth staff).\n\nWhat are the passes good for?\n\nThe passes provide entrance or access to more than 2,000 Federal recreation sites.\n\nThe Senior and Access Passes may also provide the pass owner a discount on some Expanded Amenity Fees such as camping. (Please contact a site directly if you have a question about pass acceptance and fees).\n\nHow can I tell the difference between a Standard Amenity, Expanded Amenity, Special Use Permit, or a Concessionaire (Concessioner) Fee?\n\nSince the pass program is managed by six Federal agencies that operate under different regulations and charge different types of fees, it can be confusing to sort out fees, terminology, and to distinguish between a \"Federally-managed facility/activity\" versus a \"concession-managed facility/activity\".\n\nPlease see the Definitions section for further details, but more importantly, please contact a site directly if you have a question about pass acceptance and fees.\n\nCan I use a credit card to buy a pass at a Federal recreation site?\n\nMost sites now prefer credit cards, but it is a good idea to have cash with you as backup.\n\nWhy aren't passes issued or accepted at all Federal recreation sites?\n\nNot all Federal recreation sites charge entrance fees.\n\nNot all Federal recreation agencies participate in the program. For example, the Tennessee Valley Authority site does not issue the passes, yet they might honor the Senior and Access Passes for camping discounts. (Inquire locally).\n\nSome facilities and activities on Federal recreation lands are managed by private concessionaires. The concessionaires charge for their services as any private company does.\n\nCan gift cards be used to purchase products from the USGS Store?\n\nNo. The USGS Store accepts all Credit and Debit cards but gift cards of any kind are not accepted.\n\nAnnual Pass\n\nIf I forget to bring my pass to a site and pay the entrance or use fee, can I mail in the receipt and a photocopy of my pass and get a refund?\n\nRefunds are not issued. Pass order confirmation letters, credit card receipts, and hangtags without Passes are not valid for entrance or use.\n\nHow do I show my pass at a site that doesn't have an entrance station?\n\nAt Federal recreation sites that don't have entrance stations you need to display your pass or show proof of pass ownership to compliance officers via one of the two following methods:\n\nHANGTAGS\n\nA pass can either be displayed on your rearview mirror using a free hangtag or on your dashboard with the signature side showing. Remember, the hangtag itself is only a way to display your Pass, and is not valid for entry unless it holds a valid Pass.\n\nDECALS\n\nIf you own an open-topped vehicle (jeep, motorcycle, etc.) you may obtain a free decal to attach to your vehicle that will serve as proof of payment at sites that don't have a staffed entrance station.\n\nDecals are issued on annual basis, even for owners of lifetime Senior/Access passes\n\nDecals are NOT valid for entry at staffed entrance sites - you MUST show your pass\n\nDecals must be obtained in person and you must show the following: your Pass, driver's license and vehicle registration. The name on all three documents must match.\n\nAll sites that issue passes issue free hangtags\n\nIf I visited a Federal recreation site and paid the entrance or use fee and I have the receipt, can I trade in the receipt and pay the difference to upgrade to an Annual Pass?\n\nGenerally, no. When you are making your purchase, you should carefully consider which one of the fee and pass options best suits your needs.\n\nNational Parks will ONLY upgrade entrance or use receipts from National Parks to an Annual Pass, and will NOT UPGRADE entrance or use receipts from other land management agencies. Any upgrades must be done IN PERSON AT A NATIONAL PARK, within 7 days of the original entry receipt purchase date.\n\nCurrently, the other five land management agencies (USDA FS, BLM, FWS, Reclamation, USACE) do not upgrade day-use entrance receipts to Annual passes.\n\nWhen does an Annual Pass expire?\n\nWhether you buy the pass for yourself, or as a gift, the Annual Pass is valid for 12 months from the month of purchase, expiring the last day of that month.\n\nWhat is NOT covered by the Annual Pass?\n\nThe Annual Pass does not cover Expanded Amenity fees such as camping, boat launching, parking, special tours, special permits or ferries.\n\nAlso, some facilities and activities on Federal recreation lands (including those mentioned above) are managed by private concessionaires. The concessionaires charge for their services as any private company does and the Pass is not valid for their services.\n\nCan lost or stolen passes be replaced? Is there a way that the serial numbers can be tracked?\n\nNo. Due to privacy and logistical considerations, passes cannot be replaced if lost or stolen; a new Pass must be purchased.\n\nIf I have more than four people in my car, how many passes do I need?\n\nOne pass covers the vehicle at sites that charge \"per vehicle\".\n\nAt \"per person\" sites, the applicable fee will be charged for each additional person.\n\nMy family is traveling in two vehicles; will one Annual Pass let all of us into the site?\n\nNo. Only the vehicle with the pass owner is covered. The second vehicle is subject to an entrance fee, or must have (or buy) a second pass.\n\nWho is admitted with an Annual Pass?\n\nEach Annual Pass admits the pass owner and passengers in a non-commercial vehicle at per-vehicle fee areas; and pass owner + 3 adults, not to exceed 4 adults, where per-person fees are charged. (Children under 16 are always admitted free).\n\nNote: Photo identification will be requested to verify pass ownership.\n\nI ride my bicycle into a federal recreation site that charges an entry fee. Can my friends come in with me with my pass?\n\nYes, generally the pass holder and up to 3 other bicyclists can enter for free. Be sure to check with the recreation site you plan to visit before leaving because there can be differences in the way a pass is honored at different sites.\n\nCan more than one person sign an Annual Pass?\n\nNo, all passes allow only one person to sign the pass. Annual Passes issued before 2024 had two signature lines, but that changed to make all passes consistent. Passes are not transferable.\n\nWhat about motorcycle riders who purchase an Annual Pass?\n\nOne Annual Pass covers one motorcycle, the same as all other passes. Annual Passes issued before 2024 had two signature lines and could allow in two motorcycles, but that changed to make all passes consistent. An unexpired 2023 Annual Pass with two signature lines will continue to allow up to two motorcycles if both riders have signed the pass.\n\nWho qualifies for the Annual Pass?\n\nAnyone 16 years or older may purchase the pass; children under 16 are always admitted free.\n\nWhat is the America the Beautiful - the National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass or \"Interagency\" Annual Pass?\n\nAn $80.00 Annual Pass that provides access to more than 2,000 recreation areas managed by six Federal agencies, with up to 100% of the proceeds being used to improve and enhance visitor recreation services.\n\nWhere can I use my Annual Pass?\n\nPlease contact a site directly if you have a question about pass acceptance and fees.\n\nThe Forest Service, the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, and US Army Corp of Engineers honor the Annual Pass at sites where Entrance or Standard Amenity Fee(s) (Day use fees) are charged.\n\nBureau of Land Management http://www.blm.gov\n\nBureau of Reclamation http://www.usbr.gov\n\nFish and Wildlife Service http://www.fws.gov\n\nUSDA Forest Service http://www.fs.usda.gov\n\nNational Park Service http://www.nps.gov\n\nUS Army Corps of Engineers http://www.usace.army.mil\n\nWhere can I get an Annual Pass?\n\nPLEASE be sure to call a site and verify they are still issuing the passes BEFORE you make a special trip to obtain a pass.\n\nPasses may be obtained at hundreds of locations throughout the country, including many Federal recreation sites where they are accepted.
