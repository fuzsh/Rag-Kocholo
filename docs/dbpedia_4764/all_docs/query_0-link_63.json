Oracle Manufacturing Cloud supports serial tracked production and tracks all materials as they are issued against a specific assembly serial.\n\nPrior to this release, when you performed material transactions and there was more than one serial number for a work order, you could not see if you had previously issued material against a specific parent serial.\n\nWith this release, during material issue, on the Report Material Transactions page, you can view the exact quantity of components that have been previously issued against every parent serial. This is a new column attribute which will help you verify that you have correctly issued all required materials to each serial.\n\nThe following screenshot shows the quantities for materials that were previously issued to an assembly serial number:\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nYou must opt in to and enable this feature. For instructions, refer to the Optional Uptake of New Features section of this document.\n\nRole Information\n\nPrivilege Name and Code: Report Material Transactions(WIP_REPORT_MATERIAL_TRANSACTIONS_PRIV)\n\nJob Role Name and Code: Production Operator(ORA_WIE_PRODUCTION_OPERATOR_JOB)\n\nOptionally Report Materials for an Assembly Serial From the Dispatch List\n\nMost companies that have serial-tracked assemblies use manual reporting of key materials to keep a complete track of cradle-to-grave genealogy. It’s even more critical when you have to remove and return components due to quality issues found in assemblies. When you have to return or replace components for serial-tracked assemblies, you need to have an error-free method to remove components from the right assembly serial.\n\nUntil this release, you always issued or returned materials in the context of an operation from the dispatch list. You would select the assembly serial number only within the context of a material transaction, and the list of serials displayed all serials on the work order, regardless of their current status at the operation.\n\nTo enable mistake-proofing for your material transactions, you can now select the assembly serial number directly from the dispatch list, and then start the material issue transaction.. This enables you to search for assembly serials by status, ensuring that only those serial numbers eligible for material transactions are visible.\n\nThe following screenshot shows the Review Dispatch List page with the material reporting icons for an assembly serial:\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nTo enable this feature, follow these steps:\n\nIn the Setup and Maintenance work area, select the Manufacturing and Supply Chain Materials Management offering.\n\nOn the Setup: Manufacturing and Supply Chain Materials Management page, select the Manufacturing functional area.\n\nSelect the task Manage Plant Parameters.\n\nFor the manufacturing organization that you want to enable this feature for, set the value of the parameter Material Reporting Level for Serialization Operations to Item Serial.\n\nRole Information\n\nPrivilege Name and Code: Report Material Transactions(WIP_REPORT_MATERIAL_TRANSACTIONS_PRIV)\n\nJob Role Name and Code: Production Operator(ORA_WIE_PRODUCTION_OPERATOR_JOB)\n\nIntegrate with External Systems with Additional REST Services\n\nOracle Manufacturing Cloud provides web services to enable integration to external systems, such as external manufacturing execution systems, shop floor devices, and mobile devices. With this release, the following REST services have been added or updated:\n\nREST SERVICE FOR CREATE WORK ORDER\n\nPrior to this release, you could create work orders from outside the application using an excel template predefined by file-based data import (FBDI). With this release, you are now able to create a work order using a REST service with the following capabilities:\n\nCreate any type of a manufacturing work order (for example a standard, a rework, or a transform work order)\n\nCreate a work order using the default work definition, or by providing a primary or alternate work definition. The work definition will be used to create the operation, material, and resource details.\n\nCreate and assign assembly serials to serial-tracked work orders.\n\nWhen you create a rework or a transform work order for a serial-tracked or lot-tracked assembly, you can specify the lot or serial number of the assembly that is being reworked or transformed.\n\nREST SERVICE FOR UPDATE WORK ORDER\n\nIf you are using an external scheduling application or a manufacturing execution system to control shop floor activities, you may want to update the work order dates based on the output of these application. Prior to this release, the Update Work Order REST service had the capability to update only some header level information, such as work order priority, planned start date, planned completion date, work order status, canceled reason code, planned start quantity, and the firm planned attribute. With this release, you can update the following work order dates with or without triggering rescheduling in Oracle Manufacturing Cloud:\n\nWork order header start and end date\n\nWork order operation planned start and end date\n\nWork order operation planned material required date\n\nWork order operation resources planned start and end date\n\nREST SERVICE FOR OPERATION START/STOP\n\nOracle Manufacturing Cloud allows you to record the exact number of times a specific work order operation was either running or paused. This enables the application to capture the actual runtime for a work order operation.\n\nWith this release, you are now able to perform the following operation start or stop transactions from an external system using a REST service:\n\nStart or stop an individual operation or an individual operation serial.\n\nStart or stop operations or serials in a batch mode.\n\nGet the start and stop times that have been recorded for any operation or serial.\n\nREST SERVICE FOR DISPATCH LIST\n\nYou can query the details of the dispatch list using the start or stop status of an operation.\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nNo steps are required to enable this feature.\n\nRole Information\n\nUsers provisioned with the Production Supervisor role will automatically be able to use the Work Order REST service.\n\nUsers provisioned with the Production Operator role will automatically be able to use the Operation Start / Stop and Dispatch List REST services.\n\nUse Simplified Scanning for Reporting Materials\n\nDuring a serialized production process, most companies perform material transactions by scanning the component name, followed by the serial number, and the serial attributes. This improves productivity on the shop floor and also reduces errors. However, in situations where the you need to issue large quantities of the same component, having to scan the component number for each serial is burdensome and unproductive. Prior to this release, for every serial number, you had to scan both the component number and the serial number, and you were not able to scan serial attributes.\n\nWith this release, the Report Material Transaction task has been updated to enable you to perform the following actions:\n\nScan the component number only once\n\nYou are now able to scan the component number only once, and then scan all of the serial numbers that need to be issued. Once you have scanned the component number, you have a numeric indicator to tell you how many serial numbers need to be issued. With the capture of each serial number, this numeric indicator decrements by 1, providing you with a visual indicator of how many serial numbers are left to be issued.\n\nOptionally scan component serial attributes\n\nOracle Inventory Management Cloud provides a capability to define items that require attribute definition, using the Manage Lot and Serial descriptive flexfields setup task. Once you have defined the attributes, you can scan serial attributes during material issue for components that are serial-tracked at issue.\n\nThe following screenshot show how multiple serial numbers can be scanned by scanning the component only once:\n\nThe following screenshot shows how serial attributes can be scanned. Mac Address is a configured serial attribute.\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nYou must opt in to and enable this feature. For instructions, refer to the Optional Uptake of New Features section of this document.\n\nRole Information\n\nPrivilege Name and Code: Report Material Transactions(WIP_REPORT_MATERIAL_TRANSACTIONS_PRIV)\n\nJob Role Name and Code: Production Operator(ORA_WIE_PRODUCTION_OPERATOR_JOB)\n\nPrioritize Work Order Execution Based on Material Availability\n\nAs a production supervisor, you can ensure all materials are available for a work order prior to its release to the shop floor. As priorities change, you might need to execute work orders of lower priority that now have become a high priority. When materials are scarce, you can decide which work orders you can release, and which work orders you must place on hold until materials become available..\n\nTo gain visibility into material availability for work orders, you can now do the following in this release:\n\nRecommend a list of work orders for material prioritization to be released, based on a combination of various attributes such as item, customer, and date criteria.\n\nReassign available materials to work orders with higher priority when shortages exist.\n\nRelease or hold work orders based on material availability and shortages to minimize shop floor disruptions.\n\nRECOMMEND PRIORITIZED LIST OF WORK ORDERS BASED ON MATERIAL AVAILABILITY AND OTHER CRITERIA\n\nYou can define material availability rules that are used by the application to create an initial recommendation based on which work orders should be released when materials are scarce. The set of rules can be defined at an organization level to list work orders for material prioritization based on the following sorting and filtering criteria:\n\nList work orders in the order of material assignment priority based on critical items, customers, work order start date, and sales order scheduled ship date.\n\nInclude work orders within a specified time fence and having specific statuses, types, and subtypes.\n\nInclude work orders with specific materials, or materials based on attributes such as make versus buy, and supply type.\n\nExclude work orders from material deprioritization based on specific attributes of the item, work order, customer, or sales order.\n\nYou can configure the rules using the Work Order Assignment Priority tab of the Material Availability Rules task, as shown in the following screenshot:\n\nYou can configure which work orders to include in the assignment criteria using the Inclusion Criteria of the Material Availability Rules task. This helps you to include work orders and specific materials based on time fence and specific attributes, as shown in the following screenshot:\n\nYou can configure to exclude work orders from deprioritization on force assignment of other work orders in the Force Assignment Criteria tab of the Material Availability Rules task, as shown in the following screenshot:\n\nYou can view the list of work orders with assignment priority to assess if materials are available or if there is a shortage of materials in the Work Orders tab of the Material Availability Assignments task, as shown in the following screenshot:\n\nYou can view the material availability details for a work order, as shown in the following screenshot:\n\nVIEW EXPECTED SUPPLIES TO ADDRESS MATERIAL SHORTAGES\n\nIn case of material shortages, you can view the expected supplies information of purchase orders and transfer orders for the scarce material. This helps you to decide whether to release a work order or to unrelease a released work order.\n\nYou can view the expected supplies for the material, as shown in the following screenshot:\n\nVIEW WORK ORDERS THAT REQUIRE MATERIALS TO ADDRESS SHORTAGES\n\nIn case of material shortages, you can view the work orders that require materials and the corresponding availability and shortages pertaining to the material. This helps you know which material is critical for a work order, and you can decide to manually adjust the work order material assignments.\n\nYou can view the material shortages in the Materials tab as shown in the following screenshot:\n\nYou can view the work orders requiring the materials in the Materials tab, as shown in the following screenshot:\n\nVIEW AND ADJUST MATERIAL ASSIGNMENTS FOR WORK ORDER PRIORITIZATION\n\nFrom the list of prioritized work orders, you can manually change the material assignments. You can either force assign materials for a selected work order to ensure that all of its critical materials are available, or force unassign materials to release all of the critical materials for a work order. When changing the material assignment, you can preview the changes affecting the selected work order and other impacted work orders that are prioritized or deprioritized. A visual indicator of reassigned materials is shown in the list of work orders after implementing the change.\n\nYou can view the work order material availability and force assign the work order as shown in the following screenshot:\n\nYou can preview the work orders which are unassigned on force assigning of the work order, as shown in the the following screenshot:\n\nYou can view the visual indicator to identify the force assigned and force unassigned work orders after implementing the material reassignment as shown in the following screenshot:\n\nCHANGE THE STATUS OF MULTIPLE WORK ORDERS BASED ON MATERIAL ASSIGNMENTS\n\nOnce you have previewed the material assignments and adjusted your changes accordingly, you can release work orders that are ready for execution, unreleased work orders, or place a hold on work orders that you do not want the shop floor to work on currently.\n\nYou can achieve greater shop floor efficiency, flexibility, and higher profits by ensuring that the highest priority work orders are released to the shop floor when there are material shortages. Work orders without all materials available can be quickly unreleased, or put on hold until materials are available and assigned. By only working on work orders that can be completed and shipped, companies can improve efficiency and increase revenue.\n\nYou can change the status of one or multiple work orders using the mass action menu as shown in the following screenshot:\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nYou must opt in to and enable this feature. For instructions, refer to the Optional Uptake of New Features section of this document.\n\nTips And Considerations\n\nThis feature is also applicable to Oracle Maintenance Cloud.\n\nRole Information\n\nPrivilege Name and Code: Manage Material Availability Rules and Assignments (WIP_MANAGE_MATERIAL_AVAIL_RULES_AND_ASSIGN)\n\nJob Role Name and Code: Production Supervisor (ORA_WIE_PRODUCTION_SUPERVISOR_JOB)\n\nCapture Lot and Serial Attributes During Work Order Transactions\n\nProduct attributes vary by the lot or serial produced, depending on the industry. It becomes important to capture the attributes and display them while viewing, generating, or transacting the serial or lot number. Depending on when serial-tracking is initiated, such as at material issue or at receipt into the inventory, the point of capture of lot and serial attributes can vary. The manufacturing system provides you access to capture lot-specific and serial-specific attributes on components that are serialized at material issue, and on final assemblies that are serial-tracked or lot-tracked at inventory receipt. You need to record these attributes for work order based production and orderless production.\n\nYou can define items in the inventory that require attribute definition using the Manage Descriptive Flexfields setup task. Once you have defined the attributes, you can capture the attributes for both assemblies and components in Manufacturing.\n\nYou can record, view, and update the assembly lot and serial attributes during work order product completion and orderless completion, when the assembly is lot-tracked or serial-tracked.\n\nYou can record, view, and update assembly serial attributes during any operation completion, when using serial-tracked production.\n\nYou can record, view, or update component lot and serial attributes during work order material issue, work order operation completion, and orderless completion, when components are lot-tracked or serial-tracked.\n\nYou can also import the lot and serial attributes using the updated operation and material transaction REST or SOAP services, or the updated file-based data import (FBDI) .xlsm template.\n\nThe following screenshot shows a sample of the lot and serial attributes captured during product completion of a lot-tracked and serial-tracked product with a work order, and for orderless completion:\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nTo capture lot and serial attributes for work order transactions and orderless transactions, you must set up the required flexfield definitions for lot attributes and serial attributes in Oracle Inventory Management Cloud and deploy the flexfields. No additional setup steps are required in Oracle Manufacturing Cloud.\n\nTips And Considerations\n\nFor capturing lot and serial attributes in production transactions, the items should be appropriately setup in Oracle Inventory Management Cloud. Consider the following while setting up parameters in the inventory:\n\nDefine the product as lot-tracked in the item definition at the organization level to capture lot attributes.\n\nSet up serialization as predefined or at receipt for the serial-tracked products.\n\nSet up serialization as predefined, at receipt, or at issue for the serial-tracked components.\n\nYou can capture lot and serial attributes for both serial-tracked and nonserial-tracked manufacturing processes.\n\nYou can set up the required attributes as mandatory or optional. If the attribute is mandatory, then you must also enter a value to complete the transaction.\n\nYou can progressively capture serial attributes across operations for serial-tracked manufacturing. For this you must set up the required serial attribute as optional.\n\nRole Information\n\nUsers provisioned with the Production Operator role will automatically be able to capture the lot and serial attributes for products and components.\n\nPrivilege Name and Code: No special privilege required.\n\nJob Role Name and Code: Production Operator (ORA_WIE_PRODUCTION_OPERATOR_JOB).\n\nEnable Inline Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures for Manufacturing\n\nCompanies in regulated industries must keep detailed records of their product manufacturing processes in accordance with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation on electronic records and signatures called 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 11. Oracle E-Signatures and E-Records is a configurable framework for securely capturing, storing, retrieving, and printing electronic records and signatures.\n\nThe following business events in manufacturing support the creation of an electronic record and inline capture of an electronic signature. If the initiator is also an approver, the initiator's signature is captured in the inline signature page. Notifications are sent to subsequent approvers to capture the remaining signatures. The new or updated transaction data is held in a pending status until all approvals are complete.\n\nStandard operations includes the following actions:\n\nCreation\n\nUpdate\n\nMaterial transactions includes the following transaction types:\n\nMaterial issue\n\nMaterial return\n\nOperation transactions includes the following transaction types and operation-specific information about material backflush, and optionally quality inspection results and quality issues when applicable:\n\nCompletion\n\nScrap\n\nReject\n\nProduct completion\n\nOrderless transactions includes the following transaction types:\n\nCompletion\n\nScrap\n\nReturn\n\nThe electronic records created are stored in a secured document repository and cannot be modified or deleted. You can search the electronic records based on the transactional information displayed in the electronic record heading in order to retrieve and print an electronic record.\n\nThe following is a screenshot of inline electronic signature capture as initiated when you submit an operation transaction:\n\nThe following is a screenshot of how you can search for an electronic record and retrieve it in the new Electronic Records work area:\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nYou must opt in to and enable the Capture Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures for SCM Transactions feature. For instructions, refer to the Optional Uptake of New Features section of this document.\n\nTo enable e-records and capture electronic signatures for manufacturing, you must determine and configure electronic signatures for each inventory organization using the Configure E-Signature Preferences task in the Setup and Maintenance work area.\n\nOnce you enable electronic signatures for a transaction, you can also define configurable business process rules in Oracle Business Process Management using the Manage Task Configurations for Supply Chain Management, and the Manage Approval Groups tasks in the Setup and Maintenance work area to determine the approvers for each transaction.\n\nRole Information\n\nTo configure electronic signature preferences and set up approval rules for standard operations management, work order material transactions, work order operation transactions, and orderless transactions:\n\nPrivilege Name and Code: Determine Transactions Requiring Electronic Signature (EDR_DETERMINE_ESIGNATURES_TRANSACTIONS_PRIV)\n\nJob Role Name and Code: Supply Chain Application Administrator (ORA_RCS_SUPPLY_CHAIN_APPLICATION_ADMINISTRATOR_JOB)\n\nTo initiate the e-records and e-signatures process after creating or updating a standard operation:\n\nPrivilege Name and Code: Add Electronic Signatures (EDR_ADD_ESIGNATURES_TRANSACTIONS_PRIV)\n\nJob Role Name and Code: Manufacturing Engineer (ORA_WIS_MANUFACTURING_ENGINEER_JOB)\n\nTo initiate the e-records and e-signatures process after submitting a work order material transaction, or a work order operation transaction, or an orderless transaction:\n\nPrivilege Name and Code: Add Electronic Signatures (EDR_ADD_ESIGNATURES_TRANSACTIONS_PRIV)\n\nJob Role Name and Code: Production Operator (ORA_WIE_PRODUCTION_OPERATOR_JOB)\n\nAnalyze Production Exceptions and Impacted Work Orders\n\nOracle Transactional Business Intelligence (OTBI) for Manufacturing helps production supervisors to create operational and ad-hoc analyses, which covers both in-house and contract manufacturing work orders, operations, material transactions, and resource transactions. As a production supervisor, you can gain visibility into production exceptions data which includes material shortages, resource breakdowns, or other exceptions related to work areas or work centers. This visibility complements the real-time manufacturing reporting capabilities and is essential in providing a full picture of operational efficiency and productivity.\n\nWith this release, you can build OTBI analyses to satisfy the following business needs:\n\nSummary count of production exceptions classified by exception type, severity, and exception status\n\nAging of open production exceptions\n\nAverage cycle time for resolution of closed exceptions\n\nCount and list of work orders impacted by open, and critical production exceptions\n\nWork orders affected by production exception types for components, resources, work areas, and work centers\n\nAs a result, self-service reporting by a business user is quicker and helps to achieve insights into manufacturing operations.\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nNo steps are required to enable this feature.\n\nRole Information\n\nUsers provisioned with the Production Supervisor role will automatically be able to access the Manufacturing subject areas in Oracle Transactional Business Intelligence.\n\nJob Role Name and Code: Production Supervisor (ORA_WIE_PRODUCTION_SUPERVISOR_JOB)\n\nBI Duty Role Name and Code: Manufacturing Execution Analysis Duty (FBI_MFG_EXECUTION_ANALYSIS_DUTY)\n\nUpdate 17C\n\nRevision History\n\nThis document will continue to evolve as existing sections change and new information is added.

The ‘New Features UI’ is available to you from your cloud homepage, where you can make your choices and do any configuration necessary.\n\nUpdate Tasks\n\nThis section gives you information to help you plan, deploy, and validate your update. We make frequent additions to this document, so don’t forget to check back and get the latest information before your update starts.\n\nRelease Feature Summary\n\nAction Required to Enable Feature\n\nFeature\n\nAutomatically Available\n\nEnd User Action Required\n\nAdministrator Action Required\n\nOracle Service Request Required\n\nAnalyze Work Orders and Transactions Combined with Supply Chain Details\n\nView Sales Order Attachments During Work Execution\n\nIntegrate with External Systems Using Updated REST Services\n\nAnalyze Work Orders and Transactions Combined with Supply Chain Details\n\nToday real-time, self-service reporting for production supervisors is available through Oracle Transactional Business Intelligence (OTBI) for Oracle Manufacturing Cloud, covering in-house and contract manufacturing work orders, operations, material, and resource transactions. You can build custom reports for real-time manufacturing visibility and combine data such as item and inventory details from other subject areas supported for Oracle Supply Chain Management Cloud in OTBI. However, additional attributes in manufacturing as well as common dimensions and attributes to cross join with item, order management, receiving, shipping, and inventory information are required in order to complete the detailed reporting needed for internal and external manufacturing.\n\nWith this release, you can build reports to satisfy the following types of business needs:\n\nComparison of work order material shortages versus on-hand inventory\n\nMaterial pick list for one or multiple work orders\n\nResource requirements for one or multiple work orders\n\nProduction performance and delays with assemble to order model, item category, buyer, planner, sales order, work area, and work center details\n\nOutside processing lead times, quantities, and delays\n\nProduction transaction history with parent-child lot and serial details\n\nAs a result, self-service reporting is quicker and gives you additional insight into manufacturing operations.\n\nThe following screenshot shows a sample analysis created using cross-subject area join between Manufacturing and Order Management for showing the work order details along with sales order number, the details of component serial numbers, and serial attribute descriptive flexfields using the new component serial number dimension:\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nTo view the lot and serial descriptive flexfield information in Manufacturing, select the Business Intelligence enabled check box in the flexfield definition, deploy the flexfield, and then run the scheduled process Oracle Fusion Data Extensions for Transactional Business Intelligence. No additional setups are required to use the newly introduced dimensions and cross-subject area joins.\n\nTips And Considerations\n\nTo build cross-subject area analysis, such as between Manufacturing - Work Order Performance Real Time, and Order Management - Fulfillment Lines Real Time subject areas, add at least one metric each from both subject areas to the analysis. They could be hidden if they are not required to be shown in the analysis output.\n\nRole Information\n\nUsers provisioned with Production Supervisor role will automatically be able to access the Manufacturing subject areas in OTBI.\n\nView Sales Order Attachments During Work Execution\n\nWhen building products based on customer orders, companies may need to capture documents from their customer that are specific to an order, such as customer-specific product specifications, testing procedures, packing instructions, an so on. These documents can be in pdf format, or could be word documents, or picture attachments. Some of these documents are important for the production personnel to use during the production process. Other documents may contain pricing or other confidential information that is intended only for the sales or order management personnel.\n\nWith this release, for back-to-back enabled work orders for standard or configured products, the following features are enabled:\n\nProduction supervisors are now able to view sales order attachments on the Reservations tab of the Edit Work Orders page.\n\nProduction operators are now able to view sales order attachments from the Dispatch List. This gives them direct access to information from the sales order to use during production.\n\nProduction personnel are able to view all attachments added to the miscellaneous attachments category in the sales order, or any attachment that is assigned to any other category that they have privileges to view.\n\nUsing the Setup and Maintenance work area and the Security Console, you are able to configure user-defined attachment categories and assign specific privileges to these categories. These privileges can then be assigned to specific users, so that only users with this particular privilege will be able to view the attachments from these categories. Using these security privileges, a company can restrict users of other departments from accessing certain confidential and pricing related attachments in its organization.\n\nThe following screenshot shows sales order attachments as displayed on the Edit Work Order and Review Dispatch List pages:\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nNo steps are required to enable this feature.\n\nTips And Considerations\n\nSales order header and sales order line attachments belonging to the predefined attachment category Miscellaneous are visible by default in the Work Execution work area pages. You can optionally choose to secure the visibility of sales order attachments for user-defined attachment categories. The following steps outline the process:\n\nUsing the Setup and Maintenance work area, define user-defined attachment categories and associate them to attachment entities corresponding to sales order header and sales order line.\n\nUsing the Setup and Maintenance work area, enable security for attachment entities corresponding to sales order header and sales order line.\n\nUsing Security console, create data security conditions for Application Attachment Category object for the user-defined attachment categories.\n\nUsing Security console, assign data security policies to the job roles such that a person with the Order Entry Specialist role can access all sales order attachment categories, but someone with the Production Supervisor and the Production Operator roles can view only a subset of these sales order attachment categories.\n\nIntegrate with External Systems Using Updated REST Services\n\nOracle Manufacturing Cloud provides web services to enable integration with external systems, such as external manufacturing execution systems (MES), shop floor devices, or mobile devices. With this release, the following REST services are updated:\n\nMATERIAL TRANSACTION\n\nYou can now capture and update descriptive flexfield information during orderless transactions.\n\nYou can now issue controlled components (for example, lot controlled or serial controlled) during orderless transactions.\n\nRESOURCE AND OPERATION TRANSACTION\n\nYou can now capture and update descriptive flexfield information for all resource and operation transactions.\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nNo steps are required to enable this feature.\n\nRole Information\n\nUsers provisioned with Production Supervisor role will automatically be able to use the REST service.\n\nUpdate 17B\n\nRevision History\n\nThis document will continue to evolve as existing sections change and new information is added.

Oracle Manufacturing Cloud supports in-house manufacturing, contract manufacturing, and new in this release, outside processing.\n\nWork Definition\n\nGain Visibility Into Item Structure Change Orders in Work Definitions\n\nAs a product design evolves, it is critical to communicate engineering changes with formal documentation of the modifications and revision control. In this release, you can identify the change order and line that initiated the item structure (such as bill of materials) changes, both in the Manufacturing’s worklist notification for item structure changes and in the Work Definition page. This enhanced visibility of change orders contributes to quicker, more accurate execution of engineering changes that impact work definitions.\n\nThe following screenshot gives an example of the notification that shows details of the change order:\n\nThe date drop down in the Edit Work Definition page displays the change order details alongside the effective start date of the distinct component(s), which align with the change order:\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nNo steps are required to enable this feature.\n\nTips And Considerations\n\nIt is important to note that there is one manufacturing notification generated per change order line. Also, it is recommended but optional to create a work definition version that aligns with the change order effectivity.\n\nKey Resources\n\nOracle SCM Cloud: Using Manufacturing, available on the Oracle Help Center.\n\nView Multilevel Item Structure in Assemble-To-Order Model Work Definitions\n\nOn the existing Work Definition page, the manufacturing engineer can only assign components at the first level of an item structure to specific operations. The lower-level components inherit their operation assignment based on their parent’s assignment. Viewing the hierarchical structure for a highly configurable product (such as the indented list of subassemblies and components that comprise it) and assigning components to operations becomes a tedious, error prone task. As a consequence, you might have created additional option classes and work definitions in order to build multilevel configurations.\n\nWith this release, you have the ability to expand the nested levels in a multilevel item structure for an assemble-to-order (ATO) model and assign a component from any level to a work definition operation. Operation assignments for child ATO models, option classes, option items, phantoms, and mandatory components are easily verified by viewing the parent-component hierarchy and operation where-used information on the Work Definition page, exporting to Microsoft Excel, or printing the work definition report. In addition, changes to quantity, inverse quantity, unit of measure, yield, basis, optional, and planning percent attributes at any level in a multilevel ATO model item structure are automatically synchronized with the work definitions using it.\n\nThis visibility enables more flexible and accurate data setups for the configure-to-order (CTO) process, which dynamically generates the work definition for a product configuration based on the work definition for the ATO model and options selected during order capture. The following screenshot explains this.\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nNo steps are required to enable this feature.\n\nTips And Considerations\n\nWhen assigning operation items, you need to consider whether to assign them at the option class or option level. If each of the options does not require different manufacturing steps, then you can perform the assignment at the option class level. If you do assign operation items at the option level, ensure that all the options are assigned to an operation. If not, the creation of the work order for the configured item will fail.\n\nSelect and Access Favorite Work Definitions\n\nTo support easy and quick retrieval of a specific work definition (which might be undergoing revision, completion, or collaboration), you can now mark a work definition as a favorite. In prior releases, setting a favorite was managed through the Favorites and Recent Items toolbar, which required a few extra clicks. In this release, you can easily establish work definitions as favorites with a click on the Star icon that appears next to the object title. One click identifies the object as a favorite (solid yellow star), and one click removes it from favorites (empty star). Establishing a favorite provides you with easy access to revisit those objects by opening your Favorites and Recent Items list and clicking on the title.\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nNo steps are required to enable this feature.\n\nUse Supplier Operations for Outside Processing\n\nOutsourcing of one or more manufacturing operations is done to achieve lower manufacturing cost and to extend the manufacturing capability and capacity. It also requires close coordination with your manufacturing partner. You can now perform outside processing using this feature. This feature supports additional tracking and handling requirements that are associated with outside processing. In this release, you can define a supplier operation for outside processing and associate key details, such as the preferred supplier, service item, expected lead time, and automatic shipment document generation. A supplier operation can be specific to an item’s work definition or reusable as a standard operation across work definitions. Supplier operations promote better visibility of outside processing activities and proper tracking of the supplier-sourced components and service.\n\nThe following is a screenshot of a standard operation of the type “Supplier” displaying the additional details that need to be specified for a supplier operation.\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nNo steps are required to enable this feature.\n\nRework and Transform Work Definitions\n\nManufacturing requires alternate processes for reworking or transforming one product into another. To formalize the associated steps and the required materials and resources, you can now model rework and transform processes as separate work definition names, independent of supply chain planning. In addition to the operations, components, and resources you need for rework or transformation, you can identify a component for replacement with a negative quantity or specify the product for conversion, respectively. For information on the execution of these processes, see the associated content in the Work Execution section.\n\nThe following screenshot illustrates the work definition of type “rework”. All the work definition names with type “rework” are shown and user can select one among them.\n\nThe following screenshot illustrates the work definition of type “transform”. All the work definition names with type “transform” are shown and user can select one among them. ‘Transform from Item’ must be specified in case of a transform work definition.\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nNo steps are required to enable this feature.\n\nWork Execution\n\nWork Execution Work Area Landing Page\n\nAt any time during the day, as a production supervisor or an operator, you need to draw your attention to things that need immediate action. This helps you keep the shop floor activities on track. The Work Execution work area landing page has been enhanced to give you additional key metrics of the shop floor that you need to focus on, filtered for the plant, a work area or a work center, and where you can drill down to the underlying objects.\n\nMetrics for the operator include:\n\nCounts of the work order operations that are past due, ready, and rejected, enabling you to quickly drill down to the operations that you need to work on.\n\nGraphical representation of the number of units that were scheduled for the current shift versus what has been completed, rejected, or scrapped. This depiction gives you a bird’s eye view of the current status of your shop floor. You can also expand the infolet to get the operation performance at a work center level sorted with worst performers listed first.\n\nPercentage of work-in-progress inspection rejections in the plant for the last 7 days.\n\nSupervisors are able to see all of the operator metrics, plus:\n\nCounts of work orders that are past due, on hold, or in unreleased status. You can now focus on work orders that need attention and drill down to view the work order, reschedule it, unrelease it, or take it off hold to get the work order back on track.\n\nCounts of the open production exceptions for the plant. You can expand this infolet to see the details of specific categories of the exceptions and also drill down to the Manage Exceptions page to take necessary action.\n\nCounts of the number of open rework or transform work orders.\n\nThe Work Execution work area landing page helps guide both supervisors and operators to the most important tasks for them at any moment in time.\n\nThe following screenshot illustrates the Work Execution landing page that a production supervisor would see when logged into the application.\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nNo steps are required to enable this feature.\n\nManage and Close Exceptions Using the Supervisor Mobile Application\n\nThe Supervisor Mobile application allows the production supervisor to access the work order execution status and take actions using a smart phone, such as an iPhone or any Android phone. With this release, you can also view the exceptions of a work order and close the exceptions after they are resolved.\n\nAdditionally in this release, you can keep the count of work orders with open exceptions and quickly drill down into the list of work orders and their exceptions. On the Work Orders page, you can access the exceptions of a work order and review the details of an exception, as well as view a list of other work order operations impacted by the exception. With a single touch, you can quickly email the details of the exceptions to other stakeholders. After reviewing an exception, you can close the exception for one or more impacted work order operations of the exception.\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nNo steps are required to enable this feature.\n\nPerform Operation Start or Pause\n\nIn order to better understand shop floor operations, it is important to track the cycle time, elapsed time, idle time, or run time for the various products being manufactured on the shop floor.\n\nWith this release, the Operation Start or Pause feature enables the operator to record the exact times a specific work order operation was either running or paused. This enables the system to capture the actual run time for a work order operation. You are also able to record this information for every assembly serial number when the assembly is serial tracked.\n\nAfter this data is captured, using Oracle Transactional Business Intelligence (OTBI), you are able to aggregate the actual run time for the plant, and every operation, allowing you to analyze time over runs and unusual production stops.\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nNo steps are required to enable this feature.\n\nTips And Considerations\n\nFor serialization enabled operations, you can determine whether time needs be captured at operation level or item serial level by configuring the plant parameter: Start or Stop capture Level. The plant parameter is set to Operation level by default.\n\nManage and Execute Rework Work Orders\n\nEven the highest quality companies occasionally have to rework a finished product due to a quality issue found after the unit was completed.\n\nIn this release, you can create a rework order for product that has already been completed and moved to inventory. This specific type of work order allows you to create work orders based on a rework work definition or manually identify the operations required to rework the product, as well as the components that need replacement and the resources required. The operator is then able to remove the damaged component and issue a new component to the work order, as well as capture any resource time required to complete the rework.\n\nThe rework work order functionality enables you to plan and cost your rework. Additionally, it provides full traceability for products on your shop floor.\n\nThe following screenshot illustrates the creation of the rework work order. Optionally, you can use a rework work definition to create the rework work order; all the work definition names with type rework are shown and user can select one among them.\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nNo steps are required to enable this feature.\n\nManage and Execute Transform Work Orders\n\nIn some scenarios, it is possible to take an existing finished product, make some changes, and then transform that result into another finished product. This process can be helpful to meet immediate demand for finished goods that are in short supply.\n\nIn this release, you can upgrade, downgrade, or otherwise transform one product into another by creating, tracking, and executing a transform work order. You can create transform work orders using a transform work definition. Or, you can manually transfer work orders by specifying the operations required, the on-hand item you want to transform, the existing components you want removed, the new components you want to add, and the resources required. Even complex manufacturing processes involving assembly and component serial or lot numbers can be tracked through this process, which updates genealogy based on the work performed.\n\nThis enables organizations to quickly react to customer orders by transforming existing, in-stock product into what the customer has ordered.\n\nThe following screenshot illustrates the creation of the transform work order. You need to specify the ‘Transform from Item’ for the transform work order. Optionally, you can choose a pre-defined “Transform” work definition to create the transform work order; all the work definition names that are valid for the work order item and transform from item combination are shown and the user can select from this list.\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nNo steps are required to enable this feature.\n\nIncrease Productivity with Improved Assembly Serial Scanning\n\nIn the previous release, the item serial numbers associated with a work order are displayed in a drop-down list. Users were forced to search the item serial numbers from the drop-down list to report material usage. There was no quick way for users to choose the item serial number when there was a large number of item serial numbers associated with the work order.\n\nIn this release, the item serial numbers associated with the work order are now displayed on the left panel. Operators can either scan the item serial number or manually pick from the list, which further improves the user experience and increases productivity while reporting material usage.\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nNo steps are required to enable this feature.\n\nManage Material Negative Issue and Negative Return Transactions\n\nIn this release, new material transaction types (negative issue and negative return) were introduced. When you want to remove a defective component or replace a component from an assembly, then you can indicate a negative quantity in the work definition and the work order. Also, you can add adhoc components during material transaction and perform a negative issue transaction. These transactions are supported for rework and transform definitions and work orders only.\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nNo steps are required to enable this feature.\n\nAdditional Manufacturing Enhancements\n\nGenealogy\n\nManufacturers are faced with an ever-increasing requirement to provide inclusive lot and serial tracking from supplier through production and shipment. The Oracle genealogy solution provides you with tracking capabilities for serialized and lot-tracked finished products and components from the receipt of the component from suppliers, to the work orders and work centers that worked on the product, and to the final shipment to the customer.\n\nGenealogy becomes most important when a failure occurs with a product or component. You want to identify:\n\nThe source and scope of a failure.\n\nWhat the relevant identifying pieces of information for the failure are.\n\nWhat other items might be impacted due to a relationship or common origin.\n\nWhere the item has been during its lifecycle.\n\nWhat occurred at each location or event.\n\nYou also want to manage, control, and correct a failure and determine where the problem product is at the moment, where the other potentially impacted items are, and if the failure has been corrected or if it’s ongoing. You can use enhanced search to quickly and easily retrieve genealogy and component information detailing manufacturing and inventory transactions. The Genealogy Search page provides key word search, autosuggest, filters, and a combination of autosuggest or keyword search and filters. In one view of the data, you can identify a lot or serial’s complete transaction history with a graphical timeline that depicts each movement. In an alternate view, you can identify what went into making the item and where the finished product was used, as well as trace the consumption to the end customer.\n\nThe following screenshot illustrates how to capture the component lot and serial details for a serial controlled product during work order completion process.\n\nUsers can search product genealogy details by using different search attributes. The following screenshot displays the default search filters you can use to search genealogy of any product.\n\nThe Genealogy Details page includes three panels. On the left is the dependency graph where the genealogy instance in focus is displayed with its immediate parent and child by default. The dependency graph can be expanded to two levels. On the bottom right is the dependency map that provides the completed component relationship at overview level. On the top right is a search panel. Genealogy instances that match the value you enter in the search box, are displayed in the search results panel, and are highlighted in the dependency graph and dependency map.\n\nThe following screenshot displays genealogy details for a lot and serial enabled assembly and the lot/serial details of the components.\n\nThe Genealogy Transactions History page displays the manufacturing transaction details of product for the work order. The following screenshot depicts manufacturing transaction history for a particular assembly. Users can click on the hyperlinks to get more details from Manufacturing or Inventory UIs.\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nTo enable genealogy data capture, an item must have the following attribute values:\n\nLot Control attribute = ‘Full lot control’ OR\n\nSerial Generation attribute = ‘Dynamic entry at inventory receipt,' ‘Entry at sales order, transfer order or work order issue’ or ‘Predefined serial number’\n\nFor an item that is lot-controlled, serialized or both, the attribute ‘Enable Genealogy Tracking’ must be set to Yes.\n\nTips And Considerations\n\nIn case of serialization enabled manufacturing, the material usage including lot and serial details of components can be reported in reference to specific product serial numbers that are pre-associated to work orders.\n\nSo if the components are lot and/or serial control enabled and the assembly is serialized, the genealogy information is accurately displayed for serialization enabled manufacturing.\n\nKey Resources\n\nOracle Supply Chain Management Release Training session on Product Genealogy\n\nOutside Processing\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nNo steps are required to enable this feature.\n\nTips And Considerations\n\nDetermine when purchase requisitions need to be created for outside processing (at work order release/at prior operation completion) and set the “Purchase Requisition Trigger” plant parameter accordingly.\n\nTo model and track consumption of components supplied by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), associate components to the supplier operation with the supply type as Push/Operation Pull/Assembly Pull.\n\nTo inspect goods after they are received from supplier and delivered to the shop floor, create an in-house operation immediately after the supplier operation to record inspection results.\n\nUse Quality Inspection Plans to Selectively Inspect at Work Order Operations and Collect Inspection Results\n\nEarly detection of defects in the manufacturing process and proactive initiation of corrective actions is important to ensure superior product quality. You can now enforce quality checks and inspection results collection inline to work order operation transactions. Based on the inspection results collected by the production operator, disposition actions can be initiated, which in turn may result in logging of a quality issue.\n\nThe production operator can also initiate standalone inspections to collect results for a work order operation, an item in inventory, or a production resource. For example, resource inspection allows for proactive monitoring of equipment, so that you can detect potential problems early. Production supervisors can query and view the inspection results collected as part of inline and standalone inspections.\n\nQuality inspection plans and results are available with manufacturing execution transactions. Supported features include:\n\nSelective inspection of operations\n\nData collection using quality inspection plans to complete operation transactions\n\nDisposition driven by inspection results\n\nAutomatic generation of an action in Oracle Quality Management Cloud to perform further analysis and corrective action when a quality inspection results in nonconformance to the quality inspection plan specifications\n\nNOTE: Additional capabilities for quality issues and actions require Oracle Quality Management Cloud. Oracle Quality Management Cloud delivers a unified platform for enabling quality visibility, collaboration, and execution through quality control techniques and closed-loop quality management. For more information, see the Oracle Quality Management Cloud section in the Oracle Product Lifecycle Management Cloud: What's New document.\n\nYou can open the Quality Inspection page from a work order Operation Transaction page to collect quality inspection data. The Quality Inspection page captures the quality inspection data directly in Oracle Quality Management Cloud while providing a reference to the operation transaction. When users initiate an operation transaction that requires mandatory inspection, they will have to enter the quality inspection results to proceed and complete recording of the transaction.\n\nProduction supervisors can quickly view quality inspection results by navigating to the Quality Inspection Results page. A new task “Inspections” has been introduced for users to navigate directly from Work Execution Overview page to view the quality inspection data. Additionally, users can view the quality inspection results by navigating from the Work Orders History page.\n\nProduction operators can perform inspections in standalone mode and associate the inspection results with the work order operations. Production operators can also inspect the resources used in the manufacturing process and finished goods in inventory.\n\nSteps to Enable\n\nNo steps are required to enable this feature.\n\nTips And Considerations\n\nIf mandatory inspection is enabled, then the production operator must perform inspection; else the operation transaction cannot be performed\n\nInspections can be enabled only at count point operations\n\nInspection can also be modeled as a separate operation in the work definition and in work order operations\n\nAPPENDIX A: FUNCTION SECURITY PRIVILEGES AND AGGREGATE PRIVILEGES\n\nThis release includes new privileges that facilitate function security for new features.
