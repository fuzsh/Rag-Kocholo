        "text": "If you want to sell your old textbooks and outdated books but don’t know their ISBNs, this short guide is for you. We’ll help you find ISBNs on a book, and if there are none, we’ll give you a few tips on how to sell books without ISBNs, too.\n\nWhat Is an ISBN?\n\nISBN stands for International Standard Book Number. It’s a distinctive code assigned to each published book to help in more efficient marketing and distribution by booksellers, libraries, universities, wholesalers, and distributors. You can usually find the ISBN on the back cover or inside the front cover, just above the barcode.\n\nThere are two types of ISBNs: a 10-digit version (ISBN-10) and a 13-digit version (ISBN-13). The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was published in 1970 as an international standard. Later, to ensure a continuous supply of numbers and to make the system more compatible with barcode systems, the 13-digit ISBN (ISBN-13) was introduced in January 2007. The 13-digit ISBN includes the 3-digit prefix 978 or 979, identifying the number as belonging to the book publishing sector.\n\nThe ISBN helps tell one edition from another, which is super important when you want to order the right version. Another important thing is that different formats, like hardcover, paperback, eBook, etc., and different editions, like revised edition, second edition, etc., of the same book have their own unique ISBN. This helps to make sure that the book is properly identified in the worldwide book market.\n\nWhere Is the ISBN on a Book?\n\n“Where to find isbn on book?” is a pretty common question that you’ve probably come across. You can find it on the back cover, above the barcode, or on the copyright page. It helps stores sell the book and makes sure people get the right version they want. It also helps keep track of how many books are sold and where they’re sold.\n\nWhere to Find the ISBN of a Book?\n\nIf you don’t know where to find an ISBN number, check the book’s back first, then check its copyright page, or any inner pages at the back and the front of the book.\n\nBooks with No ISBN\n\nBefore the identification system was formalized in 1970, other information was used to identify books. Books published before 1970 might have a Standard Book Numbering (SBN) code—that’s a 9-digit commercial book identifier system that came before the ISBN. But some older books don’t have either an SBN or an ISBN at all. That means there’s no unique ID for these books, which can make it a bit tougher to catalog and find them.\n\nHere is what you can research to understand the value of a book:\n\nCheck the book title, its author, editor, and even illustrator—this information may help find ISBN number by title—if it exists but wasn’t printed for some reason.\n\nFind the name of the publisher and the publishing date. If you don’t know where to find the year a book was published, check the copyright page.\n\nCheck the book’s edition. First editions can be pretty expensive.\n\nTake a look at the book’s binding (paperback or hardcover).\n\nCheck if there are any signatures or inscriptions.\n\nOnce you’ve acquired all this information, you can try offering your old books for sale on various online platforms.\n\nSell Your Books with BookScouter\n\nIf you’ve got books with ISBNs, BookScoutercan help you sell them. It lets you compare offers and track price changes from more than 30 vendors; you can choose the best offer and get the most cash for your books. Unfortunately, if your book doesn’t have an ISBN, BookScouter can’t help you sell it, as the vendors require each book they buy to have one.\n\nHow to Sell Books Without ISBN\n\nSelling old books without ISBN numbers is possible through various channels. Here are some of the ways how to sell books without an ISBN:\n\nValue assessment: Find out the value of the book. If you suspect it might be valuable, you can contact a professional appraiser to determine its worth.\n\nOnline platforms: List your book on peer-to-peer platforms or auction it on sites like eBay.\n\nAmazon exemption: If the book was printed before 1970 and does not have an ISBN, you can request an exemption to sell the book on Amazon.\n\nSpecialized marketplaces: Antique and vintage books can be sold on specialized marketplaces such as AbeBooks.\n\nDealers and auctions: You can also sell the book to a dealer or at auction, especially if it’s a rare or antique collectible. Many such dealers buy and sell rare, collectible books and first-editions (e.g., Peter Harrington Books and Bauman Rare Books, among others).\n\nKeep in mind, however, that selling books without ISBNs can be different depending on the website or store you’re using. Some sites need an ISBN, but others let you sell books without one.\n\nConclusion"
