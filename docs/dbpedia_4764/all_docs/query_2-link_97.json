Â You need to apply for an ISSN based on the country in which the journal is published.\n\nApplication for an ISSN is via a form that collects various pieces of data to show that the journal title is regularly produced and likely to continue.

More information is available from the Research Data Management team.\n\nData repositories such as Dryad and Figshare will also assign DOIs for data sets.\n\nFor further information on identifiers\n\nTo request an ISBN, contact the Library by email library@bath.ac.uk"
