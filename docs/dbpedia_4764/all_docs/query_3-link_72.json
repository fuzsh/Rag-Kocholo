        "text": "Series Titles\n\n“Series” in the Digital Collections are designated by Series Titles. These are often used to collocate groups of items to take advantage of the way that series and serial titles are browseable across collections and as a facet option for search results. Here are some broad categories of series used in the Digital Collections:\n\nSeries Types\n\nExamples\n\nItems related by chronology or created in a specific time period that may not be a calendar year.\n\nFiscal Year 1975\n\nAcademic Year 2013\n\n112th Congress\n\n80th Legislature of Texas\n\nSeries titles authorized by the Library of Congress (generally used for government documents)\n\nAEC research and development report\n\nBiological services program FWS/OBS\n\nResearch report (Southwest Region University Transportation Center (U.S.))\n\nArchival collections and/or archival series\n\nSchuhmann Family Photograph Collection\n\nUnited Orthodox Synagogues records (MS 712)\n\nCharles B. Moore Family papers, 1832-1917\n\nAustin Papers: Series IV, 1831-1834\n\nPublished series\n\nPublications of the Texas Folklore Society\n\nWar and the Southwest series\n\nGeneral categories of items within a collection that may improve browsing\n\nFlood Insurance Rate Maps\n\nThe Ship and the Sacred Tree: Textiles from South Sumatra (exhibition title)\n\n10th Annual Texas Folklife Festival\n\n[North Texas Politics & Public Officers]\n\nFor series titles to be most useful, the patterns for similar titles need to be consistent, particularly for chronological titles (e.g., Fiscal Year YYYY) where a single year generally refers to a range of time other than a calendar year. So, Fiscal Year 1970 would start summer/fall 1969 and end around summer 1970; Academic Year 1932 would start with the fall semester in 1931 and end in summer 1932.\n\nSerial Records\n\nAs a general rule, formatting and values for serial records align with the Input Guidelines, however, some fields are more consistent across serial records than other kinds of records, or fit in common exceptions. The general characteristics of serial records in the Digital Collections include:\n\nA standardized Main Title that fits a patterned template to ensure consistency, sorting, and findability for users\n\nMany fields that stay essentially the same across all items in a serial with changes to numbers (e.g., volume/issue/quarter/etc.), dates, and personal names\n\nInclusion of Citation field information for publications with volume/issue numbers\n\nThis section provides an overview of general rules and common concerns specific to serial records in the Digital Collections with example values. It does not repeat in-depth formatting explanations covered by the general Input Guidelines for Descriptive Metadata.\n\nTitle\n\nOverview:\n\nAll serial records have one Main Title and at least one Serial Title\n\nSerial records may have additional titles, as appropriate\n\nGuidelines\n\nExamples\n\nCommon Issues:\n\nIf the volume/issue (or another) number is written in Roman numerals:\n\nUse Arabic numbers and include a note\n\nMain Title: The Hexagon, Volume 98, Number 2, Summer 2007\n\nDisplay Note: “Vol. XCVIII, No. 2.”\n\nIf a title includes abbreviations such as “Vol.”, “No.”, etc:\n\nWrite out full words in the title and include a note\n\nMain Title: Cheiftain, Volume 12, Number 3, March 1964\n\nDisplay Note: “Vol. 12, Number 3.”\n\nIf the issue covers multiple volume/issue numbers or months/seasons:\n\nInclude both/all with a hyphen or slash – generally match item formatting, but choose the most common/logical punctuation to keep titles consistent across a particular publication\n\nScouting, Volume 70, Number 3, May-June 1982\n\nHillviews, Volume 42, Number 1, Fall/Winter 2011\n\nIf information on the item is known to be incorrect (e.g., if the Roman numerals are not changed from volume to volume, or are written incorrectly):\n\nPut the correct information in the title using [square brackets] and include a note as needed\n\nMain Title: The Age, Volume [10], Number 10, October 1989\n\nDisplay Note: “Vol. XII, No. 10.”\n\nMain Title: Chieftain, Volume [1], Number [2], October 1952\n\nCreator/Contributor\n\nOverview:\n\nName formatting and entry should align with Creator or Contributor guidelines, e.g.:\n\nNames of persons should be inverted (Last, First), with a space between initials\n\nHierarchical organizations should have a period after each level of the hierarchy (and at the end)\n\nWhenever possible/applicable, an authorized form of the name should be used, if available (this is particularly true for government agencies and organizations)\n\nEvery creator/contributor must include a type and role\n\nGuidelines\n\nExamples\n\nCommon Issues:\n\nPublisher\n\nOverview:\n\nGuidelines\n\nExamples\n\nThe publisher is often the same agency listed as the primary creator (or parent agency)\n\nName formatting should align with publisher guidelines, e.g.:\n\nHierarchical organizations should have a period after each level of the hierarchy (and at the end), listed from largest to smallest\n\nWhenever possible/applicable, an authorized form should be used, if available (particularly for government agencies and organizations)\n\nLocation names are written out (e.g., city, state ; city, country)\n\nName: United States. Government Printing Office.\n\nLocation: Washington D.C.\n\nName: Texas Commission on Environmental Quality\n\nLocation: Austin, Texas\n\nCommon Issues:\n\nLanguage\n\nOverview:\n\nGuidelines\n\nExamples\n\nCommon Issues:\n\nDescription\n\nOverview:\n\nGuidelines\n\nExamples\n\nCommon Issues:\n\nIf the frequency of the publication changes:\n\nChange the content description to match, or remove the frequency reference, if it isn’t consistent\n\nIf the pages are not numbered or the pagination changes many times:\n\nInclude the total number of content pages in [square brackets] (i.e., pages that would have page numbers if they were printed/sequential)\n\n[44] p. ; 25 cm.\n\nIf the pages are numbered continuously across each volume:\n\nA page range may be used (e.g., 60-88 p.), but in the interest of parsing information without duplication, consider:\n\nusing the total number of content pages in brackets (so that users know “how long” the issue is) and\n\nadding the page numbers to the Citation field in Page Start and Page End entries (for search engines)\n\nAlways add a display note\n\nPhysical Description: [28] p. : ill. ; 28 cm.\n\nCitation Page Start: 60\n\nCitation Page End: 88\n\nPhysical Description: vii, 180 p.\n\nCitation Page Start: 1\n\nCitation Page End: 180\n\nDisplay Note: Pagination is continuous across volumes.\n\nSubject\n\nOverview:\n\nAdd terms that would aid users in finding the items\n\nUse terms that are generally applicable to the entire publication, but you may also include some terms that are specific to an issue\n\nType\n\nGuidelines\n\nExamples\n\nLibrary of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)\n\nThese are not required, but can be included if available (e.g., from an OCLC or catalog record)\n\nOmit geographic subdivisions (these duplicate coverage) and form subdivisions (prefer LCGFT)\n\nUnited States. Bureau of Mines\n\nTexas Tech University – Curricula\n\nTexas. Office of Public Insurance Counsel – Appropriations and expenditures\n\nNorth Texas State University\n\nLibrary of Congress Genre/Form Terms (LCGFT)\n\nAll serials should have the term “Periodicals”\n\nWhen relevant/appropriate, use the search modal to add relevant term(s) related to the type of publication\n\nPeriodicals\n\nNewsletters\n\nCourse catalogs\n\nStudent yearbooks\n\nStatistics\n\nAnnual reports\n\nConference papers and proceedings\n\nLaw reviews\n\nUniversity of North Texas Libraries Browse Subjects (UNTL-BS)\n\nAt least one UNTL-BS term is required for Portal records\n\nChoose term(s) that describe the general concept of the entire\n\nUse terms appropriately, e.g., “State Agencies” would apply to annual reports or newsletters about an agency, but may not apply to publications issued by an agency on other topics; financial reports about “Finance” rather than “Money” (physical currency)\n\nGovernment and Law - State Agencies\n\nBusiness, Economics and Finance - Medicine - Doctors\n\nEducation - Colleges and Universities\n\nSocial Life and Customs - Clubs and Organizations\n\nKeywords\n\nWhen relevant, add general keywords that reflect the content of the entire publication or specific topics for an individual issue\n\nKeywords should be lowercase and plural, unless they are proper names\n\nDo not duplicate words that are in other subject terms\n\norganizational planning\n\nmonthly reports\n\nwater conservation\n\nfinancial reports\n\nbudgets\n\nCommon Issues:\n\nIf you cannot find an appropriate UNTL-BS term for a Portal item:\n\nLook for a general, top-level term that may be appropriate and then add more specific keywords (or other available subject headings)\n\nIf there is truly no relevant subject, contact metadata administrators about adding a new term\n\nGovernment and Law\n\nSocial Life and Customs\n\nCoverage\n\nOverview:\n\nType\n\nGuidelines\n\nExamples\n\nPlace Name\n\nWhen appropriate, add the place(s) that are described in the content\n\nThis may the the same as the publication location, but may be more general (e.g., state agency reports are published in Austin but about activities in the whole state; a document about a state park may be at a county level; etc.)\n\nUnited States\n\nUnited States - California - Los Angeles County - Los Angeles\n\nUnited States - Texas - Jeff Davis County\n\nDates\n\nIf the serial describes a set time, include the single coverage date, or date range\n\nDate ranges reflect the time or first/last dates covered by the content (e.g., stories in a journal or magazine;
