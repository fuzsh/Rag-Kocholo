        "text": "Blood Moon over Solferino: On building hope on battlegrounds\n\n“Some business trips don’t go quite as planned. Take Henry Dunant, for example. The 31-year-old Swiss businessman from Geneva was on his way to meet with Napoleon III in Italy, to discuss water rights in Algeria, when he reached the small village of Solferino. He was met with a sight so harrowing that it would forever change his life and subsequently that of hundreds and thousands more.” Susan Platt on what really matters.\n\nIn Conversation: Trevor Guthrie\n\n“These things come from childhood nightmares, and they come from poetry, from the demons and spirits whispering in your ear, from the memory of birth, from early Renaissance painting, from drunken madness, from music and from the scent of fuchsias.” Zürich based visual artist Trevor Guthrie.\n\nIn Conversation: Uli Beutter Cohen\n\n“When you read a book, of course it’s a portal to the lives of the characters, but it’s also a portal to your own life. A book is an expression that we want to belong.” D.B. Miller talks with Uli Beutter Cohen about books, New York subway behaviour and belonging.\n\nIn Conversation: Jeremy Bouma\n\n“I’ve discovered offering different paths of engagement with ideas is simply a good way to be human. Even the best political movements—both the uplifting and not so uplifting—were driven by a narrative, by story.” Fiction writer Jeremy Bouma.\n\nIn Conversation: Anne Wheaton\n\nAnne Wheaton is a champion of kindness. She cares passionately about rescuing pets and helping fellow humans. After 17 years as a hairdresser, she decided to focus all her time on her true passions. The Woolf’s Susan Platt crossed the digital divide to talk to the author and rescue animal advocate about books, pigs, pugs, cats, dogs and Comic Con.\n\nTales from the Pit #8\n\n“Train, tram, trek—by now I know the way. It’s my sixth Zürich Openair festival, the first that I’m hell-bent on hitting all four nights. I hang a quick left before the sewage treatment plant and start up the dusty path to the grounds.” D.B. Miller’s latest dispatch from Zürich Openair.\n\nIn the Right Place: Meet November’s WriteCon Tutors\n\nOn Saturday 10 November, two exceptional women visit Zürich to lead workshops at WriteCon 2018. Say hello to Alison Baverstock and Louise O’Neill and learn how they found where they belong.\n\nWhere Do I Belong? A Guide to Professional Organisations for Writers\n\nAs a writer, there’s always somewhere you belong. Crime, fantasy, romance, historical, sci-fi, YA, horror and children’s fiction, there’s room for everyone. Here’s a list of some key international, UK and US organisations, where you may find exactly what you need."
