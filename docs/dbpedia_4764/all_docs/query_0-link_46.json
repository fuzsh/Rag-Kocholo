        "text": "Editorial\n\nAgent: A book industry professional who represents authors and illustrators, helping them to place their work with publishers, collecting their payments, and performing other duties on their behalf.\n\nAcquiring Editor: An editor who buys a specific book. The acquiring editor will then pass the manuscript on to the development editor, unless the acquiring editor and the development editor are the same person, which is often the case.\n\nBook Proposal: Description of a proposed book that an author sends to a publisher, often including sample chapters and an outline.\n\nCritique: An evaluation of a manuscript, touching on issues such as structure as well as character and plot development.\n\nDevelopment Editor: The editor who does the substantive editing of a book, with particular attention paid to overall style, pacing, plot, and structure. The development editor works with the author on revisions.\n\nDraft: The book's manuscript at a particular stage. The first draft is followed by rough drafts, which are unpolished versions. The final draft is sent to prepress.\n\nEditorial Board/Publishing Committee: A group at a publishing house that approves the acquisition of a book, that is, purchasing an author's work for publication. Editorial boards are typically comprised of an acquisitions editor, as well as representatives from the sales, marketing, and finance departments.\n\nErrata: A loose sheet detailing errors found in a printed book.\n\nLine-Editing/Copy Editing: Line-by-line editing of a manuscript, concentrating on style, punctuation, spelling, grammar, flow, sequencing, clarity, consistency, and content errors.\n\nManuscript: An author's written material before it is typeset and printed. MS and MSS are the shorthand designations for \"manuscript\" or \"manuscripts.\"\n\nProofreading: A final proofing of the manuscript, usually focused on cleaning up any typographical errors before the manuscript is typeset.\n\nQuery Letter: A letter from an author or agent to an editor that briefly describes a manuscript and asks whether the editor is interested in evaluating the manuscript.\n\nReading Fees: Fees charged by some agents to evaluate a prospective client's manuscript. The Association of Authors' Representatives, a major trade association for book agents, prohibits its members from charging reading fees.\n\nRevisions: Changes, sometimes extensive, to an original work.\n\nSlush Pile: Manuscript submissions that are received by publishing houses, but are unsolicited or do not come through agents. Some publishers do not consider unsolicited manuscripts, while others do review them.\n\nSubmissions: Manuscripts sent by an author or agent to a publisher for consideration.\n\nLegal, Finance, Rights & Permissions\n\nAdvance: A payment made as an advance against royalties by a publisher to an author or illustrator when the author's book is acquired by the publisher. The advance is often paid in two parts: half upon the signing of the contract, and half upon the delivery or the publisher's formal acceptance of the manuscript. The advance is charged against royalties and must \"earn out\" (that is, accrued royalties must amount to the size of the advance) before any royalties are paid.\n\nBoilerplate: A publisher's standard contract offered to an author and used as a starting point for negotiating final terms.\n\nContract/Publishing Agreement: A legal document detailing an author or illustrator's agreement to sell to a publisher some or all rights to a creative work. Contracts specify what rights under copyright are being granted, the author's and publisher's respective obligations under the agreement, the author's compensation, and other provisions. Agreements can be thick with legalese and typically include anywhere from 3 to 20 pages, with up to 100 clauses.\n\nCopyright: The exclusive, legally-secured right to, among other things, reproduce and distribute works of original expression. Expression is your own unique way of expressing an idea, telling a story, or creating a work of art. Under copyright law, creators hold copyright in a book or other literary work from the moment they put the words down on paper, into a computer file, or into some other tangible medium. Copyright protection in works created after January 1, 1978 generally lasts until 70 years after the death of the creator. Copyright in works created by businesses or before 1978 can last for 95 years from publication. After a work is no longer protected, it falls into the public domain.\n\nKill Fee: A payment that may be made to an author or illustrator when a publisher cancels a project.\n\nOption Clause: A clause in a publishing agreement giving the publisher the right to consider acquiring the author's next book before other publishers can do so.\n\nPermissions: Agreements from copyright holders granting the right to someone else to reproduce their work. Authors who want to excerpt someone else's work in their own book may be obligated under copyright law to secure permissions.\n\nPublic Domain: Products of the human mind ? such as books, inventions, computer programs, songs, movies, and other works ? are often owned by the creator as \"intellectual property,\" meaning that the creator may have control over uses of the work such as reproduction. Intellectual property is recognized under copyright, patent, trademark, and other laws. If a work is not legally protected as intellectual property (possibly because its protection has expired), it is said to be in the \"public domain.\" Anyone may reproduce, sell, or otherwise use a public domain work without having to obtain permission.\n\nRights/Subsidiary Rights: Some of the many different ways in which a book can be distributed include through book clubs, as foreign translations, through excerpts in newspapers and magazines, or as a movie adaptation. The rights to distribute a book in one of these or other extended forms are referred to as \"subsidiary rights.\" If the publisher licenses the subsidiary rights to another company to exploit them, the license proceeds are shared between the author and the publisher. Sometimes the publisher exploits subsidiary rights directly, such as by selling its own book club edition of the work. If the author withholds these rights from the publisher and the author's agent licenses the rights directly to a third-party company, the author keeps all of the proceeds minus the agent's commission.\n\nRoyalties: A percentage the author or illustrator receives out of the proceeds from the sale of each copy of the book.\n\nMarketing & Publicity\n\nBook Signing: A publicized event, often held at bookstores or book fairs, featuring an author reading from and discussing the author's book and autographing the book for customers.\n\nDirect Mail: Promoting books by sending a brochure, flyer, postcard, or other printed material directly to a group of potential buyers.\n\nFantasy: A type of fiction that bends or transcends the rules of the known world, allowing such conventions as time travel, talking animals, and super-human creatures.\n\nFiction: Writing that comes from the imagination, or writing that does not adhere to the facts related to true events.\n\nGenre: A specific category of books, such as historical, romance, or science fiction.\n\nHistorical Fiction: Works in which the characters are fictional, but the setting and other details are rooted in actual history.\n\nMarketing: A concerted effort of promotion and advertising by the publisher to maximize sales of books to the public and to distributors.\n\nMedia Kit/Press Kit: A folder of promotional materials used for announcing information about a forthcoming book to the news media and other targeted outlets. Media kits may include excerpts, reviews, quotes from individuals praising the work, and a press release.\n\nMonograph: A scholarly piece of writing (often book length) dealing with a detailed, yet often limited, subject.\n\nNiche Marketing: Marketing and promoting a book to a specific group of buyers, such as people in a certain geographical region, or people with a specific hobby or interest. Books published for a niche market may be sold nationally, but mainly are sold through specialized retail outlets.\n\nNonfiction: \"True\" writing in which the author retells actual events.\n\nPress Release: A written announcement that seeks to draw media attention to a specific event or product launch.\n\nTarget Audience: A specific group of readers likely to be interested in a particular book.\n\nParts & Kinds of Books\n\nAfterword: Closing remarks on the topic of the book or the process of writing the book.
