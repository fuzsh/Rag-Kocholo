        "text": "To get all of your Samsung account’s benefits, you will need to register your devices to the account. If you have a Galaxy phone, Galaxy tablet, or Samsung TV, the device should be automatically registered the first time you log into your Samsung account on the device. On the other hand, if you have a home appliance or other device you will need to manually register it via the Samsung website or the Samsung Members app. It is also a good idea to add your Samsung account to your child's products, and register them as well.\n\nWhen registering a product to your Samsung account, you will need to enter some information about your device. Some mobile devices (like phones or LTE tablets) require you to enter an IMEI number, while appliances and other devices require a serial number and model number. However, keep in mind that if you can sign into your Samsung account on the device, that will automatically register it to your Samsung account.\n\nIf you're not able to sign into your Samsung account on the device, your best bet is to log in to your Samsung account on our website, and go to the Registration page.\n\nYou can also physically look for your product’s IMEI number, model code, or serial number.\n\nThere are a few reasons why you may not be able to register a device to your Samsung account. For example, you won't be able to register a phone if it's unlocked, rooted, pre-production, a non-US model, or purchased from a retailer not intended for the US.\n\nBelow are some other reasons and some troubleshooting tips for when a device won't register."
