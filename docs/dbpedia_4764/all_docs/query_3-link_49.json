Preprints are preliminary, unpublished, non-peer-reviewed versions of scholarly papers that precede publication and act as an early indication of research.Ã‚ Preprints from 2017 and onward can be explored as part of a Scopus search and are included as a content type in Author profiles.\n\nRead more on the Scopus blogopens in new tab/window.\n\nScopus content is reviewed and ultimately selected by an independent Content Selection and Advisory Board (CSAB), an international group of scientists and researchers with journal editor experience and who represent the major scientific disciplines indexed on Scopus.\n\nYear-round, the CSAB members are responsible for reviewing all new titles that are suggested for indexing on Scopus. They also review and ensure that the quality of existing content is maintained.\n\nWatch the videoopens in new tab/window\n\nLearn more about the Scopus CSAB.\n\nWe are proud of our transparent selection process and independent review board. The international experts on our CSAB continually review new title requests using both quantitative and qualitative measures. Only serial titles may be suggested to the CSAB for inclusion on Scopus, including journals, book series and conference series.\n\nRead our Content Policy & Selection.\n\nHave a title to suggest? Complete this formopens in new tab/window.\n\nSerial publications covering and intended to reach a specific industry, trade or type of business. These publications usually are a magazine type of periodical with articles on topical subjects, news items and advertisements that appeal to those in the field. Trade journals are seldom refereed and do not always have an editorial board. Abstracts are usually short or nonexistent and few or no references are given. Usually an ISSN is available. Trade journals are included in Scopus because users and librarians consider selected articles to be scientifically relevant. Only articles or reviews of scientific relevance are included in Scopus.\n\nA non-serial source is a publication with an ISBN and is usually a monograph or composed work. One-off book publications covered in Scopus includes monographs, edited volumes, major reference works and graduate level textbooks. Over 217,000 book titles are in Scopus that significantly increase the breadth and depth of coverage for book-oriented disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. Books are indexed on both a book and a chapter level. Book selection policy is publisher-based, meaning publishers are reviewed based on the relevancy and quality of their complete books list. Once a publisher is accepted, all books from that publisher that fit the scope of the project are indexed in Scopus.\n\nConference material enters Scopus in two different ways: (1) as a special issue of a regular journal, (2) as a dedicated conference proceeding. Proceedings can be published as serial or non-serial, and may contain either the full articles of the papers presented or only the abstracts. The source title usually includes words like proceeding(s), meeting(s), conference(s), symposium/symposia, seminar(s) or workshop(s) (or their synonyms in other languages), although some journals also include proceeding(s) in the title. Scopus covers conferences that publish full-text papers (i.e., document type conference papers)."
