        "text": "From Government of Canada Publications\n\nOn this page\n\nHow to get started\n\nMore information about this service\n\nHow to get started\n\nGovernment of Canada Publications assigns International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN) to book-like government publications, including to podcasts and to videos with substantive informational content. Internationally recognized, publishers, booksellers, and libraries around the world use ISBN to identify, track, and manage publications.\n\nWe also assign catalogue numbers to most government publications.\n\nWho is eligible for this service\n\nMost federal departments and agencies require ISBNs and catalogue numbers to identify their book or book-like publications. For more information on Government of Canada publishing requirements, refer to:\n\nProcedures for publishing\n\nPolicy on Communications and Federal Identity\n\nWho is ineligible for this service\n\nIf you are a Canadian publisher looking to obtain an ISBN, visit ISBN Canada.\n\nIf you are a Canadian publisher with a French-only publication, contact Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec at isbn@banq.qc.ca.\n\nSerial or periodical publications\n\nIf you publish a product with the same title in successive issues and at regular intervals, you are publishing a serial or periodical. These publications need an International Standard Serial Number (ISSN).\n\nIf you publish a serial or periodical less frequently than every 3 years, you need an ISBN and a catalogue number.\n\nRequest an ISSN from ISSN Canada\n\nGovernment publications that require an International Standard Book Number and catalogue number\n\nDifferent formats and editions of publications are assigned unique ISBNs and catalogue numbers. For example, a publication issued in print, PDF and DVD would have a distinct ISBN and catalogue number for each format. Each language edition also gets a unique publication number (for example, distinct numbers for English, French and Spanish versions). New editions and major revisions also warrant distinct ISBNs and catalogue number.\n\nExamples of publications that require an ISBN and catalogue number:\n\ncorporate reports that are issued less frequently than every 3 years\n\nresearch reports, audit reports, working group reports, investigatory reports and other types of report\n\npamphlets, manuals, brochures and fact sheets of educational and/or informational purposes\n\nagreements, treaties, international conventions and protocols\n\ntopographical maps\n\npolicy documents, planning documents, conference proceedings, regulations\n\nMore information about this service\n\nThe ISBN identifies a monographic publication, book or book-like product that is complete in one part or intended to be completed within a finite number of parts. ISBNs were once 10 digits in length, but since January 1, 2007, they consist of 13 digits.\n\nEvery time there is a change in format or a change in edition, you need to apply for a new ISBN. Each different e-book format (EPUB, MOBI, Kobo and PDF) also requires a distinct ISBN.\n\nA Government of Canada catalogue number is a unique number that identifies publications produced by the federal government. Reprinted publications do not need a new catalogue number. However, new editions and revised publications require new catalogue numbers.\n\nWe do not assign ISBNs or catalogue numbers to HTML or XML publications."
