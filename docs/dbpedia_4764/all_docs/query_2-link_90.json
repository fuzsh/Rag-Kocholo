        "text": "You can request an ISSN for all serial publications which were published in the Netherlands and meet the criteria. Serial publications are publications that appear periodically and have consecutive issues or parts, such as a volume, serial number or annual or monthly edition. Examples of this include magazines, newspapers and annuals.\n\nAn ISSN can be requested for print and digital publications. In the case of a digital publication, an ISSN can only be assigned once the first issue is available. If a publication is issued both in print and digitally, the printed version and the digital version will each have their own ISSN.\n\nNew ISSN with title change\n\nAccording to international guidelines, virtually each time the title of a serial publication is changed, a new ISSN must be assigned. You can report such a change to the ISSN Centrum Nederland. Use the ISSN title change application form.\n\nISSN and ISBN\n\nSometimes a publication receives both an ISSN and an ISBN (identification number for books). The ISBN then applies to 1 specific issue, e.g. 1 annual from a series of annuals. The ISSN applies to the entire series. More information about ISBN can be found on the Bureau ISBN website.\n\nAn ISSN consists of 8 digits: 7 numbers and a control digit. If the control digit is a 10, there will be an X instead of a 10. These are examples of what an ISSN might look like:\n\nISSN 1234-5679\n\nISSN 1384-279X\n\nYou should preferably list the ISSN in the editing, design, production and printing information of each issue of the publication. If there is no such information, display the ISSN on the outside of the publication. You can also include the ISSN in the form of a barcode."
