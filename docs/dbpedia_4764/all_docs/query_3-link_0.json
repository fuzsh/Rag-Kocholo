        "text": "An ISSN is an 8-digit code used to identify newspapers, journals, magazines and periodicals of all kinds and on all media–print and electronic.\n\nWhich publications are concerned by an ISSN?\n\nWhat form does an ISSN take?\n\nWhat is its role?\n\nWhere is it displayed?\n\nWhich publications are concerned by an ISSN?\n\nAn ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) identifies all continuing resources, irrespective of their medium (print or electronic):\n\nnewspapers,\n\nannual publications (reports, directories, lists, etc.),\n\njournals,\n\nmagazines,\n\ncollections,\n\nwebsites,\n\ndatabases,\n\nblogs,etc.\n\nIn many countries, an ISSN is mandatory for all publications subject to the legal deposit.\n\nWhat form does an ISSN take?\n\nThe ISSN takes the form of the acronym ISSN followed by two groups of four digits, separated by a hyphen. The eighth digit is a check digit calculated according to a modulus 11 algorithm on the basis of the 7 preceding digits; this eighth control digit may be an “X” if the result of the computing is equal to “10”, in order to avoid any ambiguity.\n\ne. g.:\n\nISSN 0317-8471\n\nISSN 1050-124X\n\nWhat is its role?\n\nThe ISSN role is to identify a publication.\n\nIt is a digital code without any intrinsic meaning:\n\nit does not include any information about the origin or contents of the publication,\n\nit does not guarantee the quality or validity of the contents.\n\nThe ISSN is associated with the title of the publication. If the publication is modified significantly, a new ISSN must be assigned.\n\nWhere is it displayed?\n\nFor a print publication, the ISSN should be shown:\n\npreferably, in the upper right corner of the cover,\n\nfailing that, on the pages where editorial information is shown (publisher, frequency, colophon, etc.).\n\nFor a publication in electronic media, the ISSN should be shown:\n\non the homepage or on the main menu, if it is an online publication,\n\non any part visible to the naked eye (microfiche header, CD-Rom or DVD label, box, case, etc.), if the publication is on a physical medium.\n\nIf a publication is identified by ISSN and ISBN, both of these identifiers should be mentioned."
