        "text": "Save as PDF\n\nThe fields of the Link Resolver Usage subject area can be used to create reports that provide both specific details of link resolver usage as well as a broad perspective of how the Alma link resolver is used. This provides libraries with a useful means of determining proper electronic collection development.\n\nThis subject area supplements the Usage Data subject area, which includes data from vendors, while the Link Resolver Usage subject area takes data directly from the Alma link resolver.\n\nUsers can turn OFF “Link resolver usage” information in search results and the overlap analysis tool by setting the customer parameter: \"allow_link_resolver_usage_indications\" to false. For more information on the customer parameter, see Configuring Other Settings (Resource Management).\n\nUsing the Link Resolver Usage area, the Design Analytics you can create reports/dashboards for the Link Resolver Usage area and are able to answer the following types of business questions:\n\nHow many times did users select View It in all sources over a specified period of time?\n\nHow many times did users select View It in a specific source?\n\nHow many times did users select View It and no results were produced?\n\nHow many times did users select View It for a particular source that resulted in no full text?\n\nHow many times did users select View It for the most frequently requested full?text journals from a particular source?\n\nField Descriptions\n\nThe following lists the fields available in Link Resolver Usage.\n\nOpenURL Context Measures\n\nThe OpenURL Context Measures table is a fact table that stores all measures relating to the OpenURL Context. All fields are taken from the CONTEXT_OBJECT table. The primary key is CONTEXT_OBJECT_ID.\n\nOpenURL Context Measures Field Description Additional Information Number of Requests The number of times an OpenURL request was sent to the Alma Link resolver. Number of Clicked Requests Indicates if at least one of the services was selected Values are 1 and 0. Each time a request is selected, 1 is added to the total sum. Number of Requests Without Services The number of incoming OpenURLs that do not result in any services Number of Services (total) The total number of services offered per incoming OpenURL request The number of services offered per incoming open URL request from:\n\nthe “View It” tab within Primo\n\nthe links and availability section in Leganto\n\nthe electronic services page after clicking from another source\n\nNumber of Electronic Services The number of electronic services that appear when a user selects View it The number of electronic services that appear when a user selects View it. Number of Digital Services The number of digital representations that appear when a user selects View it In order for this field to have data, you must select the Include Representation services in link resolver statistics check box (Configuration > Fulfillment > Discovery Interface Display Logic > Other Settings). Number of Clicked Services (total) The total number of services selected Number of Electronic Clicked Services The number of electronic services a user selects from the View it menu Number of Digital Clicked Services The number of digital representations a user selects from the View it menu. In order for this field to have data, you must select the Include Representation services in link resolver statistics check box (Configuration > Fulfillment > Discovery Interface Display Logic > Other Settings). % Clicks from Requests The percentage of incoming OpenURL requests that were selected % Clicks from Requests = (Number of selected requests / Number of Requests) * 100 % Requests Without Services from Requests The percentage of incoming OpenURL requests that do not have services % Requests Without Services from Requests = (Number of requests without services / Number of requests) * 100\n\nOpenURL Context Details\n\nThe OpenURL Context details table is a dimension table that stores the details of the OpenURL context object. The primary key is CONTEXT_OBJECT_ID. The context object is the part of the OpenURL that contains the metadata information that identifies the resource to which the OpenURL links.\n\nOpenURL Context Details Field Description Additional Information Title The title of the OpenURL Context Author The Author of the OpenURL Context ISSN The ISSN of the OpenURL Context ISBN The ISBN of the OpenURL Context Material Type The Material Type of the OpenURL Context\n\nNetwork Inventory Group\n\nThe network inventory group This field allows you to filter and display link resolver usage by library or campus. This is relevant for institutions using the inventory network groups. Request ID The Request ID of the OpenURL Context Request Type The request type of the the OpenURL Context Possible values are:\n\nviewit – the OpenURL Context Object is configured to display the Services page.\n\nsingle_service – the OpenURL Context Object is configured for direct linking.\n\nArticle Title The Article Title of the OpenURL Context EISSN The EISSN of the OpenURL Context Source The Source of the OpenURL Context The database/index that generates an OpenURL to the link resolver in order to obtain context-sensitive services for an electronic resource citation/reference. Normalized Source The normalized name of the source. Open URL The OpenURL Source Type The Source Type\n\nThis field allows libraries to easily gather data about from where users are coming when using the Alma Link Resolver.\n\nThe following are the possible values for the Source Type field:\n\nAlma – the link was selected from within Alma staff user interface\n\nPrimo and Primo Central – the link was selected from Primo or Primo Central\n\nLeganto – the link was selected from Leganto\n\nThe source – when the link is selected from another source, such as Web of Science, Ebsco, Pubmed, Google Scholar, and all other external sources, the name of the source is used as the source type. See The Source Field below.\n\nThe Source Field\n\nThe Source field indicates the database/index that generates an OpenURL to the link resolver, which is used to obtain context-sensitive services for an electronic resource citation/reference. It appears in the OpenURL after the dash—for example, after &rfr_id=info:sid/primo.exlibrisgroup.com-. It also appears in the Primo PNX record.\n\nBy comparing the Source with other parameters such as Number of Clicked Requests, you can analyze trends in the use of electronic resources.\n\nThe following are some guidelines that indicate how the source is determined:\n\nIf a patron selects on a title in Primo that is in Alma, the source is the source ID of the system, which is located in the Control section of the Primo normalized XML (PNX) record.\n\nIf the source has a colon in it, either the user was a staff member testing the link within Alma, or the user received access to an article from within a database by being referred back to the uresolver to see if the user has a subscription that covers it.\n\nIf the source has an underscore or consists of letters such as wj (Wiley journals), the user received access to the article from a PCI record in Primo.\n\nIf the user accessed a resource from Leganto, the source is leganto_ followed by the course code for the course to which the citation was associated.\n\nThe source google does not have a colon and means Google Scholar.\n\nThe following is an example of an OpenURL with the source in bold:\n\nhttp://ap01.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/view/uresolver/64OTAGO_INST/openurl?debug=true&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&ctx_id=10_1&ctx_tim=2019-09-09T14%3A46%3A59IST&ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&url_ctx_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rfr_id=info:sid/primo.exlibrisgroup.com-proquest&req_id=&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.atitle=Mandatory%20death%20penalty%20unjustified%20where%20no%20death%20or%20wounding%E2%80%94ICCPR%20Art%206(2)%20(Zambia)&rft.jtitle=Commonwealth%20Law%20Bulletin&rft.btitle=&rft.aulast=&rft.auinit=&rft.auinit1=&rft.auinitm=&rft.ausuffix=&rft.au=&rft.aucorp=&rft.date=1996-07-01&rft.volume=22&rft.issue=3&rft.part=&rft.quarter=&rft.ssn=&rft.spage=1114&rft.epage=&rft.pages=&rft.artnum=&rft.issn=0305-0718&rft.eissn=&rft.isbn=&rft.sici=&rft.coden=&rft_id=info:doi/&rft.object_id=&rft.eisbn=&rft.edition=&rft.pub=Commonwealth%20Secretariat.&rft.place=London&rft.series=&rft.stitle=&rft.bici=&rft_id=info:bibcode/&rft_id=info:hdl/&rft_id=info:lccn/&rft_id=info:oclcnum/&rft_id=info:pmid/&rft_id=info:eric/((addata/eric%7D%7D&rft_dat=%3Cproquest%3E1791678607%3C/proquest%3E%3Curl%3Ehttps://search.proquest.com/docview/1791678607/%3C/url%3E,language=eng,view=DUNEDIN&svc_dat=viewit&rft_pqid=1791678607&rft_galeid=&rft_cupid=&rft_eruid=&rft_nurid=&rft_ingid=\n\nOpenURL Service Details\n\nThe OpenURL Service Details table is a dimension table that stores the details of the OpenURL service. You can use the fields of this dimension to determine how many times a service was clicked and other information.\n\nData in this section starts from the implementation of the feature in August 2022.\n\nOpenURL Service Details Field Description Additional Information Electronic Collection ID The electronic collection ID Electronic Collection Name The electronic collection name Has Service Indicates (Yes\\No) if the request has services Interface Name The interface name Is Clicked Service Indicates (Yes\\No) if the service was clicked Is Digital Service Indicates (Yes\\No) if the service is a digital service Is Electronic Service Indicates (Yes\\No) if the service is an electronic service Is Network Service Indicates (Yes\\No) if the service is from the Network Zone Portfolio ID The portfolio ID Service Type The service type\n\nRequest Date\n\nThe Request Date table is a dimension table that stores the details about the date of the request.

For example: January 2014. Request Quarter The quarter of the request. For example: Q1, Q2. Request Year The year of the request. For example: 2014. Request Fiscal Month Key The fiscal month key of the request (for example: 1, 2, 3). This field is recommended if you want to sort by the fiscal month. Request Fiscal Year The fiscal year of the request. Request Date Filter Used to filter report results by date. Request Year-Month The year and the month in a format such as 2023-1 Request Date Stores the Hierarchy column that allows the user to drill down from the year to the month to the specific request date. Using this column, a user may view the accumulative measures in each level of the hierarchy.\n\nBibliographic Details\n\nThe Bibliographic Details table is a dimension table that stores the bibliographic details of the physical item. The primary key of the table is MMS_ID.\n\nThe field descriptions can be found in the Bibliographic Details shared dimension.\n\nEx Libris works with content providers worldwide to enrich the metadata available in the Alma Community Zone. To enrich the journal/serial content in the CZ, we work directly with the Library of Congress CONSER feed for electronic serials, which we match against our knowledge base to enrich with all of the relevant metadata fields that they supply (for more details, see Community Zone Serial Records Enrichment) and enrich the CZ records with all relevant metadata, including the 050 fields (when available).\n\nIn the case of book content, we work with multiple providers who are willing to share their metadata with the Alma community globally (for more details, see Community Zone Monograph Records Enrichment). If you have local access to these classifications, you may want to consider working with the local extension for these records whenever an update is not available. (For more details, see Working with Local Extension Fields for Community Zone-linked Records.)\n\nThe Bibliographic Details table contains two kinds of fields, those derived from the MARC record and those that come from Alma. Although in analytics there is no distinction made between these fields, for explanatory purposes we have divided them into two tables below.\n\nBibliographic Details Field Note\n\nMapping from\n\nMARC21\n\nMapping from UNIMARC\n\nMapping from\n\nDublin Core\n\nData Type Data Size Action Note A note that contains information about the retention and the retention reason of the bibliographic record. 583 Not relevant Not relevant VARCHAR 4000 Author The term Author refers to the individual or group of individuals responsible for creating or producing the work being documented.
