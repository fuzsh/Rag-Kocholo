        "text": "By Chandan Taluja, Researcher’s Quest, a blog by Learning with Chandan\n\nThe publication process of Journal article involves:\n\nWriting the manuscript\n\nSubmitting the manuscript to a suitable journal\n\nPeer review of the manuscript\n\nAcceptance of the manuscript by the Journal Editor\n\nAnd finally, online/offline publication of the journal article.\n\nIt has been observed that post publication of article, two or more submissions might carry same article title, or even in some cases, there might be two different authors with the same full name, or even same keywords.\n\nIn such cases, the role of Publication Identifiers comes into light.\n\nPublication Identifiers are the metrics which solve the above stated problems.\n\nThere are three types of Publication Identifiers:\n\nISBN (International Standard Book Numbers).\n\nISSN (International Standard Serial Numbers).\n\nDOI (Digital Object Identifier).\n\nISBN assists in identification of a particular book amongst many books available in the markets. In the process of book publication, each book is assigned a unique 13-digit ISBN number. ISBN number is printed on the back-side of the book, accompanied by a barcode in some cases.\n\nISBN number consists of 5 elements, namely:\n\nISBN prefix,\n\nGroup/Country Identifier,\n\nPublisher Identifier\n\nTitle Identifier\n\nChecksum\n\nISSN number is an 8-digit number which identifies a serial publication such as magazines or journals published after periodic time.\n\nDOI number is a commonly known term in the researcher’s community. Every journal paper is assigned its unique DOI number.\n\nEven if two journal papers have same name, the DOI number will be different for each of them. Unique DOI number helps in identifying the desired journal paper out of the list of journals.\n\nPublication Identifiers (ISBN, ISSN and DOI) are useful for the research community for identifying desired research entity among others even if the name/title of the entities is same as others.\n\nBy Chandan Taluja, Researcher’s Quest, a blog by Learning with Chandan"
