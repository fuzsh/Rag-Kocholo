Sign up for a free email subscription of the daily Table of Contents.\n\nXML files can be downloaded in bulk as a zip file by the year (volume) or month in the Bulk Data Repository. Information on the legal status, authenticity, and schema of the Federal Register XML renditions can be found in the User Guide Document - Federal Register XML Rendition.\n\nVolumes 59 (1994) and older are digitized versions of historical issues of the Federal Register being made available as full issue PDF only. Note: Volume 59 (1994) has entire issues available in PDF format only, and smaller sections available in text format only. These digitized volumes include all issues and parts of the official printed edition. (See below for more information on searching the Digitized Federal Register.)\n\nVolume 59 (1994) issues are a special case. They originally existed in the system in text format only, but now also have PDF format available for the entire issue. Smaller sections are available only in text format.\n\nThe Federal Register Index and List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) are available on govinfo as separate publications. Learn more about the LSA.\n\ngovinfo provides a tool to easily find CFR Parts Affected from the Federal Register. Learn more about this tool below.\n\nTo find a more recent, unofficial issue of the Federal Register, view the Public Inspection issue online at www.federalregister.gov, a service of the National Archives and Records Administration’s Office of the Federal Register.\n\nYou may be able to find new rules and regulations on an agency's website before it is published in the Federal Register, but this is not considered the official version and the effective date is generally based on when it is published in the Federal Register.\n\nGPO's Online Bookstore has the following available for purchase:\n\nIndividual issues in print and microfiche\n\nAnnual subscription in print and microfiche\n\nFederal Register Index in print and microfiche\n\nHow is it organized?\n\nTable of Contents and Preliminary Pages- This section of the Federal Register contains a comprehensive alphabetical listing by agency name of all documents in the issue. Under each agency, the documents are arranged by classification--Rules, Proposed Rules, or Notices. Each entry includes the page number where the document begins and a brief description of the document.\n\nIf Presidential Documents appear in the Federal Register they are listed in alphabetical order in the Contents under the heading \"Presidential Documents\". Appearing at the end of the Contents is a list of separate parts published in the issue, if applicable. The documents appearing in the separate part are also listed under the agency in the table of contents.\n\nAlso appearing in the preliminary pages (Contents Section) of each day's Federal Register is a list of the CFR Parts Affected in This Issue. Under each CFR title the parts affected by the rules and proposed rules in the issue are listed along with the page numbers where relevant documents begin.\n\nThe Reader Aids section of the Federal Register is designed to help the reader find specific information in the Federal Register system, as distinguished from the finding aids in the preliminary pages (Contents section) which are more oriented to one particular issue of the Federal Register.\n\nRules and Regulations Section- This section of the Federal Register contains final rules and regulations: regulatory documents having general applicability and legal effect. Most rules are keyed to and codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). A document which amends text must include the changes to the CFR and state the effective date for any change.\n\nEach document begins with a heading that includes the name of the issuing agency (and subagency if appropriate), the CFR title and part(s) affected, and a brief description of the specific subject of the document. In some cases an agency includes a docket number, which identifies the document within the agency's internal filing system. A Regulation Identifier Number (RIN) may also be included.\n\nThis section also contains interim rules that are issued without prior notice and are effective immediately; the interim rule is designed to respond to an emergency situation and is usually followed by a final rule document which confirms that the interim rule is final, addresses comments received, and includes any further amendments. Additionally, this section includes documents that have no regulatory text and do not amend the CFR, but either affect the agency's handling of its regulations or are of continuing interest to the public in dealing with an agency. In this category are general policy statements and interpretations of agency regulations. These documents have the CFR headings (title and part), but do not contain any codified language.\n\nThe terms \"rules\" and \"regulations\" have the same meaning within the Federal Register publication system.\n\nProposed Rules Section- This section of the Federal Register contains notices to the public of the proposed issuance of rules and regulations. The purpose of these notices is to give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making prior to the adoption of the final rules.\n\nMany proposed rules are documents that suggest changes to agency regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and request public comment on those suggested changes. This section also contains documents relating to previously published proposed rules, extending the comment period, announcing a public hearing, making available supplemental information, withdrawing a proposed rule, or correcting a previously published proposed rule.\n\nThis section includes advanced notices of proposed rulemaking, which describe a problem or situation and the anticipated regulatory action of the agency and seek public response concerning the necessity for regulation and the adequacy of the agency's anticipated regulatory action. Additionally, many agencies voluntarily publish proposed changes to procedural rules, interpretative rules and agency policies to gather public comments.\n\nEach document begins with a heading that includes the name of the issuing agency (and subagency if appropriate), the CFR title and part(s) affected, and a brief description of the specific subject of the document. In some cases an agency docket number, which identifies the document within the agency's internal filing system. A Regulation Identifier Number (RIN) may also be included. Instructions for filing comments and the date by which comments must be filed are provided.\n\nThe terms \"rules\" and \"regulations\" have the same meaning within the Federal Register publication system.\n\nNotices Section- This section of the Federal Register contains documents other than rules or proposed rules that are applicable to the public. Notices of hearings and investigations, committee meetings, agency decisions and rulings, delegations of authority, issuances or revocation of licenses, grant application deadlines, availability of environmental impact statements, filing of petitions and applications, and agency statements of organization and functions are examples of documents appearing in this section.\n\nPresidential Documents Section- This section of the Federal Register contains documents signed by the President and submitted to the Office of the Federal Register for publication. Presidential documents include Proclamations and Executive Orders, as well as other documents such as determinations, letters, memorandums, and reorganization plans. The documents are compiled annually in title 3 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).\n\nSunshine Act Meetings- This section of the Federal Register contains notices of meetings published under the \"Government in the Sunshine Act\" (Pub. L. 94-409) 5 U.S.C. 552b(e)(3).\n\nIn recognition of the public's right to the fullest possible information about the Federal decision-making process, the Government in the Sunshine Act requires that meetings of Government agencies be open to the public, with certain specified exceptions. The Act also requires that public announcement be made in the Federal Register of the time, place, and subject matter of the meeting, the name and telephone number of the agency official to contact for more information, and whether the meeting is open or closed to the public.\n\nReader Aids- This section of the Federal Register is designed to help the reader find specific information in the Federal Register system, as distinguished from the finding aids in the preliminary pages (Contents section) which are more oriented to one particular issue of the Federal Register.\n\nInformation and Assistance. Appearing first is the listing of Office of the Federal Register telephone numbers to call for specific information.\n\nFederal Register Pages and Dates. This is a table of the inclusive page numbers and corresponding dates for the current month's Federal Register.\n\nCFR Parts Affected During the Current Month. This is a cumulative list of Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) parts affected by rules and proposed rules published in the Federal Register during the current month.\n\nCorrections Section- This section of the Federal Register contains editorial corrections of previously published Presidential, Rule, Proposed Rule, and Notice documents. These corrections are prepared by the Office of the Federal Register to correct typographical or clerical errors made in the printing of the Federal Register. Agency prepared corrections are issued as signed documents and appear in the appropriate document categories elsewhere in the issue.\n\nCFR Parts Affected from the Federal Register\n\nThe Federal Register contains rules and regulations which are regulatory documents having general applicability and legal effect. Most rules are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).\n\nBrowse CFR Parts Affected from the Federal Register to find final and proposed rules that affect the CFR and have been published in the Federal Register within the past 24 hours, week, month, or within a specific date range.\n\nCFR Parts Affected is also contained in the Reader Aids section of each Federal Register issue.\n\nUnified Agenda\n\nThe Unified Agenda, as published in the Federal Register, is available on a separate page on govinfo. The complete Unified Agenda is available to the public at Reginfo.gov.\n\nThe Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (Unified Agenda) provides uniform reporting on the actions administrative agencies plan to issue in the near and long term. Executive Order 12866 \"Regulatory Planning and Review,\" signed September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51735), and Office of Management and Budget memoranda implementing section 4 of that Order establish minimum standards for agencies' agendas, including specific types of information for each entry. Each edition of the Unified Agenda includes regulatory agendas from Federal entities that currently have regulations under development or review. Agencies of the United States Congress are not included. Fall editions of the Unified Agenda include The Regulatory Plan, which presents agency statements of regulatory priorities and additional information about the most significant regulatory activities planned for the coming year.\n\nAll editions of the Unified Agenda through the spring 2007 edition were published in their entirety in the Federal Register. Beginning with the fall 2007 edition, the Agenda published in the Federal Register is limited, in general, to agency regulatory flexibility agendas and The Regulatory Plan. Agency regulatory flexibility agendas, which are required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (PDF) to be published in the Federal Register, include only those rules that may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and entries that have been selected for periodic review under section 610 (PDF) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\nThe Unified Agenda is compiled by the Regulatory Information Service Center, a component of the U.S. General Services Administration, in cooperation with the Office of Management and Budget's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Applicable agendas are then published by the Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in the Federal Register. The Regulatory Information Service Center assigns a Regulation Identifier Number (RIN) to identify each regulatory action listed in the Unified Agenda.\n\nSearching The Federal Register\n\nPlease note the differences in searching and browsing the more recent volumes (Volume 60 to present) versus the older, digitized volumes (Volume 59 and older).
