Continuing resources include whatever the medium of production (print or electronic):\n\n— serials, such as newspapers, periodicals, journals, magazines, blogs, conference proceedings, monographic series with no predetermined conclusion, annual or other periodic reports, and\n\n— ongoing integrating resources that are updated, such as loose-leaf publications, updating websites, institutional repositories, directories and databases.\n\nMonographs, sound and video recordings, notated music publications, audiovisual works, textual works and musical works have their own standard identifiers and are not specifically mentioned in this document. Such items can carry an ISSN in addition to their appropriate identifiers when they are part of a continuing resource.\n\nNOTE This document does not contain any operational guidance for its practical implementation."
