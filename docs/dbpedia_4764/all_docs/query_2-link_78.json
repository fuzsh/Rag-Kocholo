        "text": "This article has been prepared to guide our clients who have established academic journals through OJS Services in the ISSN application process. For assistance with academic journal setup and ISSN application criteria, please contact us at OJS Services Contact.\n\nThe International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) is a unique identifier for serials and continuing resources, such as academic journals, newspapers, newsletters, and magazines. Obtaining an ISSN involves meeting specific criteria and requirements. This guide provides a detailed overview of the ISSN application process.\n\nWho Can Apply for an ISSN?\n\nAny citizen over the age of 18 can apply for an ISSN. If there is an ISSN center in a country, citizens of that country should apply through their national center. However, if they reside, work, or study in another country, they can apply through the ISSN center in their current country of residence. If a country does not have an ISSN center, citizens can apply directly through the Global ISSN Center at https://portal.issn.org/. You can check which countries have an ISSN center on this page: https://portal.issn.org/.\n\nBasic Requirements for Obtaining an ISSN\n\nThe journal’s website should be ready.\n\nThe first issue should be published.\n\nAt least five articles should be published in the first issue.\n\nOnce these conditions are met, an ISSN application can be submitted for an online academic journal. Below are additional considerations before applying for an ISSN:\n\nWhat is an ISSN and Why is it Important?\n\nAn ISSN is an eight-digit number used to identify serial publications and ensure their standardization. For publishers, having an ISSN increases the recognition of their publications and enhances their credibility within the academic and professional communities.\n\nRequirements for ISSN Application\n\n1. Title of the Serial/Periodical\n\nThe title of the serial or periodical must be consistent across all platforms (website, cover page, within articles, ISSN application form, etc.).\n\n2. Name and Address of the Publisher\n\nThe publisher’s name and address should be mentioned on the main or contact page. For print serials, this information should be on the first or second page.\n\n3. Editorial Board Page\n\nInclude an “Editorial Board” section on the main webpage of the serial or periodical. Provide details of at least five editorial board (EB) members, including their full name, complete affiliated institutional address, and institutional email ID (not personal email IDs like Gmail or Yahoo). For scholarly journals, EB members should be senior faculty members.\n\n4. Archives Page (For Online Serials Only)\n\nMaintain and update yearly archives according to the publication frequency. Archives should be named using the journal abbreviation, volume number, issue number, and year. Each issue should list the article titles with individual PDF links.\n\n5. First Page/Main Page of the Serial/Periodical\n\nThe first or main page should include details like ISSN (print/online), introductory text about the publication, aims and scope, publication frequency, language, starting year, format (online or print or both), publisher details, author guidelines, and submission details.\n\n6. Bibliographic Details\n\nEach article’s first page should display basic bibliographic details such as the name of the serial/publication, volume number, issue number, and page numbers. Each page of an article should be consecutively numbered.\n\n7. Language Support for Non-English Publications\n\nWebsites of serials/periodicals published in languages other than English should facilitate translation into English for easy scrutiny of the ISSN request application forms.\n\n8. Verification of Editorial Board Members\n\nIn some countries (e.g., India), the ISSN office will send verification emails to two randomly selected EB members. These members must reply within seven days; otherwise, the application will be declined.\n\nOJS (Open Journal Systems) is an article tracking and publishing system that technically meets the aforementioned standards.\n\nFor assistance with academic journal setup please contact us at OJS Services Contact.\n\nTips for ISSN Application\n\nAvoid providing false or misleading information in the application or on the website. This can result in application rejection.\n\nEnsure the accuracy and completeness of information about the editorial board members.\n\nRegularly update the publication archives to maintain a well-managed publication history.\n\nConclusion"
