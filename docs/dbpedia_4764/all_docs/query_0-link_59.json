        "text": "TEI: The File Descriptionâï¸2.2 The File Description\n\nThis section describes the fileDesc element, which is the first component of the teiHeader element.\n\nThe bibliographic description of a machine-readable or digital text resembles in structure that of a book, an article, or any other kind of textual object. The file description element of the TEI header has therefore been closely modelled on existing standards in library cataloguing; it should thus provide enough information to allow users to give standard bibliographic references to the electronic text, and to allow cataloguers to catalogue it. Bibliographic citations occurring elsewhere in the header, and also in the text itself, are derived from the same model (on bibliographic citations in general, see further section 3.12 Bibliographic Citations and References). See further section 2.8 Note for Library Cataloguers.\n\nThe bibliographic description of an electronic text should be supplied by the mandatory fileDesc element:\n\nfileDesc (file description) contains a full bibliographic description of an electronic file.\n\nThe fileDesc element contains three mandatory elements and four optional elements, each of which is described in more detail in sections 2.2.1 The Title Statement to 2.2.6 The Notes Statement below. These elements are listed below in the order in which they must be given within the fileDesc element.\n\ntitleStmt (title statement) groups information about the title of a work and those responsible for its content.\n\neditionStmt (edition statement) groups information relating to one edition of a text.\n\nextent (extent) describes the approximate size of a text stored on some carrier medium or of some other object, digital or non-digital, specified in any convenient units.\n\npublicationStmt (publication statement) groups information concerning the publication or distribution of an electronic or other text.\n\nseriesStmt (series statement) groups information about the series, if any, to which a publication belongs.\n\nnotesStmt (notes statement) collects together any notes providing information about a text additional to that recorded in other parts of the bibliographic description.\n\nsourceDesc (source description) describes the source(s) from which an electronic text was derived or generated, typically a bibliographic description in the case of a digitized text, or a phrase such as âborn digitalâ for a text which has no previous existence.\n\nA complete file description containing all possible sub-elements might look like this:\n\n<teiHeader>\n\nÂ <fileDesc>\n\nÂ Â <titleStmt>\n\nÂ Â Â <title>\n\nÂ Â Â </title>\n\nÂ Â </titleStmt>\n\nÂ Â <editionStmt>\n\nÂ Â Â <p>\n\nÂ Â Â </p>\n\nÂ Â </editionStmt>\n\nÂ Â <extent>\n\nÂ Â </extent>\n\nÂ Â <publicationStmt>\n\nÂ Â Â <p>\n\nÂ Â Â </p>\n\nÂ Â </publicationStmt>\n\nÂ Â <seriesStmt>\n\nÂ Â Â <p>\n\nÂ Â Â </p>\n\nÂ Â </seriesStmt>\n\nÂ Â <notesStmt>\n\nÂ Â Â <note>\n\nÂ Â Â </note>\n\nÂ Â </notesStmt>\n\nÂ Â <sourceDesc>\n\nÂ Â Â <p>\n\nÂ Â Â </p>\n\nÂ Â </sourceDesc>\n\nÂ </fileDesc>\n\n</teiHeader>\n\nbibliographyÂ âï¸\n\nOf these elements, only the titleStmt, publicationStmt, and sourceDesc are required; the others may be omitted unless considered useful.\n\nTEI: The Title Statementâï¸2.2.1 The Title Statement\n\nThe titleStmt element is the first component of the fileDesc element, and is mandatory:\n\ntitleStmt (title statement) groups information about the title of a work and those responsible for its content.\n\nIt contains the title given to the electronic work, together with one or more optional statements of responsibility which identify the encoder, editor, author, compiler, or other parties responsible for it:\n\ntitle (title) contains a title for any kind of work.\n\nauthor (author) in a bibliographic reference, contains the name(s) of an author, personal or corporate, of a work; for example in the same form as that provided by a recognized bibliographic name authority.\n\neditor contains a secondary statement of responsibility for a bibliographic item, for example the name of an individual, institution or organization, (or of several such) acting as editor, compiler, translator, etc.\n\nsponsor (sponsor) specifies the name of a sponsoring organization or institution.\n\nfunder (funding body) specifies the name of an individual, institution, or organization responsible for the funding of a project or text.\n\nprincipal (principal researcher) supplies the name of the principal researcher responsible for the creation of an electronic text.\n\nrespStmt (statement of responsibility) supplies a statement of responsibility for the intellectual content of a text, edition, recording, or series, where the specialized elements for authors, editors, etc. do not suffice or do not apply. May also be used to encode information about individuals or organizations which have played a role in the production or distribution of a bibliographic work.\n\nresp (responsibility) contains a phrase describing the nature of a person's intellectual responsibility, or an organization's role in the production or distribution of a work.\n\nname (name, proper noun) contains a proper noun or noun phrase.\n\nThe title element contains the chief name of the electronic work, including any alternative title or subtitles it may have. It may be repeated, if the work has more than one title (perhaps in different languages) and takes whatever form is considered appropriate by its creator. Where the electronic work is derived from an existing source text, it is strongly recommended that the title for the former should be derived from the latter, but clearly distinguishable from it, for example by the addition of a phrase such as â: an electronic transcriptionâ or âa digital editionâ. This will distinguish the electronic work from the source text in citations and in catalogues which contain descriptions of both types of material.\n\nThe electronic work will also have an external name (its âfilenameâ or âdata set nameâ) or reference number on the computer system where it resides at any time. This name is likely to change frequently, as new copies of the file are made on the computer system. Its form is entirely dependent on the particular computer system in use and thus cannot always easily be transferred from one system to another. Moreover, a given work may be composed of many files. For these reasons, these Guidelines strongly recommend that such names should not be used as the title for any electronic work.\n\nHelpful guidance on the formulation of useful descriptive titles in difficult cases may be found in chapter 25 of Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (2002â2005)) or another national cataloguing code.\n\nThe elements author, editor, sponsor, funder, and principal, are specializations of the more general respStmt element. These elements are used to provide the statements of responsibility which identify the person(s) responsible for the intellectual or artistic content of an item and any corporate bodies from which it emanates.\n\nAny number of such statements may occur within the title statement. At a minimum, identify the author of the text and (where appropriate) the creator of the file. If the bibliographic description is for a corpus, identify the creator of the corpus. Optionally include also names of others involved in the transcription or elaboration of the text, sponsors, and funding agencies. The name of the person responsible for physical data input need not normally be recorded, unless that person is also intellectually responsible for some aspect of the creation of the file.\n\nWhere the person whose responsibility is to be documented is not an author, sponsor, funding body, or principal researcher, the respStmt element should be used. This has two subcomponents: a name element identifying a responsible individual or organization, and a resp element indicating the nature of the responsibility. No specific recommendations are made at this time as to appropriate content for the resp: it should make clear the nature of the responsibility concerned, as in the examples below.\n\nNames given may be personal names or corporate names. Give all names in the form in which the persons or bodies wish to be publicly cited. This would usually be the fullest form of the name, including first names.6\n\nExamples:\n\n<titleStmt>\n\nÂ <title>Capgrave's Life of St. John Norbert: a\n\nÂ Â machine-readable transcription</title>\n\nÂ <respStmt>\n\nÂ Â <resp>compiled by</resp>\n\nÂ Â <name>P.J.

It is optional but recommended.\n\neditionStmt (edition statement) groups information relating to one edition of a text.\n\nIt contains either phrases or more specialized elements identifying the edition and those responsible for it:\n\nedition (edition) describes the particularities of one edition of a text.\n\nrespStmt (statement of responsibility) supplies a statement of responsibility for the intellectual content of a text, edition, recording, or series, where the specialized elements for authors, editors, etc. do not suffice or do not apply. May also be used to encode information about individuals or organizations which have played a role in the production or distribution of a bibliographic work.\n\nname (name, proper noun) contains a proper noun or noun phrase.\n\nresp (responsibility) contains a phrase describing the nature of a person's intellectual responsibility, or an organization's role in the production or distribution of a work.\n\nFor printed texts, the word edition applies to the set of all the identical copies of an item produced from one master copy and issued by a particular publishing agency or a group of such agencies. A change in the identity of the distributing body or bodies does not normally constitute a change of edition, while a change in the master copy does.\n\nFor electronic texts, the notion of a âmaster copyâ is not entirely appropriate, since they are far more easily copied and modified than printed ones; nonetheless the term edition may be used for a particular state of a machine-readable text at which substantive changes are made and fixed. Synonymous terms used in these Guidelines are version, level, and release. The words revision and update, by contrast, are used for minor changes to a file which do not amount to a new edition.\n\nNo simple rule can specify how âsubstantiveâ changes have to be before they are regarded as producing a new edition, rather than a simple update. The general principle proposed here is that the production of a new edition entails a significant change in the intellectual content of the file, rather than its encoding or appearance. The addition of analytic coding to a text would thus constitute a new edition, while automatic conversion from one coded representation to another would not. Changes relating to the character code or physical storage details, corrections of misspellings, simple changes in the arrangement of the contents and changes in the output format do not normally constitute a new edition, whereas the addition of new information (e.g. a linguistic analysis expressed in part-of-speech tagging, sound or graphics, referential links to external data sets) almost always does.\n\nClearly, there will always be borderline cases and the matter is somewhat arbitrary. The simplest rule is: if you think that your file is a new edition, then call it such. An edition statement is optional for the first release of a computer file; it is mandatory for each later release, though this requirement cannot be enforced by the parser.\n\nNote that all changes in a file considered significant, whether or not they are regarded as constituting a new edition or simply a new revision, should be independently noted in the revision description section of the file header (see section 2.6 The Revision Description).\n\nThe edition element should contain phrases describing the edition or version, including the word edition, version, or equivalent, together with a number or date, or terms indicating difference from other editions such as new edition, revised edition etc. Any dates that occur within the edition statement should be marked with the date element. The n attribute of the edition element may be used as elsewhere to supply any formal identification (such as a version number) for the edition.\n\nOne or more respStmt elements may also be used to supply statements of responsibility for the edition in question. These may refer to individuals or corporate bodies and can indicate functions such as that of a reviser, or can name the person or body responsible for the provision of supplementary matter, of appendices, etc., in a new edition. For further detail on the respStmt element, see section 3.12 Bibliographic Citations and References.\n\nSome examples follow:\n\n<editionStmt>\n\nÂ <editionÂ n=\"P2\">Second draft, substantially\n\nÂ Â extended, revised, and corrected.</edition>\n\n</editionStmt>\n\n<editionStmt>\n\nÂ <edition>Student's edition, <date>June 1987</date>\n\nÂ </edition>\n\nÂ <respStmt>\n\nÂ Â <resp>New annotations by</resp>\n\nÂ Â <name>George Brown</name>\n\nÂ </respStmt>\n\n</editionStmt>\n\nTEI: Type and Extent of Fileâï¸2.2.3 Type and Extent of File\n\nThe extent element is the third component of the fileDesc element. It is optional.\n\nextent (extent) describes the approximate size of a text stored on some carrier medium or of some other object, digital or non-digital, specified in any convenient units.\n\nFor printed books, information about the carrier, such as the kind of medium used and its size, are of great importance in cataloguing procedures. The print-oriented rules for bibliographic description of an item's medium and extent need some re-interpretation when applied to electronic media. An electronic file exists as a distinct entity quite independently of its carrier and remains the same intellectual object whether it is stored on a magnetic tape, a CD-ROM, a set of floppy disks, or as a file on a mainframe computer. Since, moreover, these Guidelines are specifically aimed at facilitating transparent document storage and interchange, any purely machine-dependent information should be irrelevant as far as the file header is concerned.\n\nThis is particularly true of information about file-type although library-oriented rules for cataloguing often distinguish two types of computer file: âdataâ and âprogramsâ. This distinction is quite difficult to draw in some cases, for example, hypermedia or texts with built in search and retrieval software.\n\nAlthough it is equally system-dependent, some measure of the size of the computer file may be of use for cataloguing and other practical purposes. Because the measurement and expression of file size is fraught with difficulties, only very general recommendations are possible; the element extent is provided for this purpose. It contains a phrase indicating the size or approximate size of the computer file in one of the following ways:\n\nin bytes of a specified length (e.g. â4000 16-bit bytesâ)\n\nas falling within a range of categories, for example:\n\nless than 1 Mb\n\nbetween 1 Mb and 5 Mb\n\nbetween 6 Mb and 10 Mb\n\nover 10 Mb\n\nin terms of any convenient logical units (for example, words or sentences, citations, paragraphs)\n\nin terms of any convenient physical units (for example, blocks, disks, tapes)\n\nThe use of standard abbreviations for units of quantity is recommended where applicable, here as elsewhere (see http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html).\n\nExamples:\n\n<extent>between 1 and\n\n2 Mb</extent>\n\n<extent>4.2 MiB</extent>\n\n<extent>4532 bytes</extent>\n\n<extent>3200 sentences</extent>\n\n<extent>Five 90 mm High Density Diskettes</extent>\n\nThe measure element and its attributes may be used to supply machine-tractable or normalized versions of the size or sizes given, as in the following example:\n\n<extent>\n\nÂ <measureÂ unit=\"MiB\"Â quantity=\"4.2\">About four megabytes</measure>\n\nÂ <measureÂ unit=\"pages\"Â quantity=\"245\">245 pages of source\n\nÂ Â material</measure>\n\n</extent>\n\nNote that when more than one measure is supplied in a single extent, the implication is that all the measurements apply to the whole resource.\n\nTEI: Publication, Distribution, Licensing, etc.âï¸2.2.4 Publication, Distribution, Licensing, etc.\n\nThe publicationStmt element is the fourth component of the fileDesc element and is mandatory. Its function is to name the agency by which a resource is made available (for example, a publisher or distributor) and to supply any additional information about the way in which it is made available such as licensing conditions, identifying numbers, etc.\n\npublicationStmt (publication statement) groups information concerning the publication or distribution of an electronic or other text.\n\nIt may contain either a simple prose description organized as one or more paragraphs, or the more specialised elements described below.\n\nA structured publication statement must begin with one of the following elements:\n\npublisher (publisher) provides the name of the organization responsible for the publication or distribution of a bibliographic item.\n\ndistributor (distributor) supplies the name of a person or other agency responsible for the distribution of a text.\n\nauthority (release authority) supplies the name of a person or other agency responsible for making a work available, other than a publisher or distributor.\n\nThese elements form the model.publicationStmtPart.agency class; if the agency making the resource available is unknown, but other structured information about it is available, an explicit statement such as âpublisher unknownâ should be used.\n\nThe publisher is the person or institution by whose authority a given edition of the file is made public. The distributor is the person or institution from whom copies of the text may be obtained. Where a text is not considered formally published, but is nevertheless made available for circulation by some individual or organization, this person or institution is termed the release authority.\n\nWhichever of these elements is chosen, it may be followed by one or more of the following elements, which together form the model.publicationStmtPart.detail class\n\npubPlace (publication place) contains the name of the place where a bibliographic item was published.\n\naddress (address) contains a postal address, for example of a publisher, an organization, or an individual.\n\nidno (identifier) supplies any form of identifier used to identify some object, such as a bibliographic item, a person, a title, an organization, etc. in a standardized way.\n\ntypecategorizes the identifier, for example as an ISBN, Social Security number, etc.\n\navailability (availability) supplies information about the availability of a text, for example any restrictions on its use or distribution, its copyright status, any licence applying to it, etc.\n\nstatus(status) supplies a code identifying the current availability of the text.\n\ndate (date) contains a date in any format.\n\nlicence contains information about a licence or other legal agreement applicable to the text.\n\nHere is a simple example:\n\n<publicationStmt>\n\nÂ <publisher>Oxford University Press</publisher>\n\nÂ <pubPlace>Oxford</pubPlace>\n\nÂ <date>1989</date>\n\nÂ <idnoÂ type=\"ISBN\">0-19-254705-4</idno>\n\nÂ <availability>\n\nÂ Â <p>Copyright 1989, Oxford University Press</p>\n\nÂ </availability>\n\n</publicationStmt>\n\nThe model.publicationStmtPart.detail elements all supply additional information relating to the the publisher, distributor, or release authority immediately preceding them. In the following example, Benson is identified as responsible for distribution of some resource at the date and place cited:\n\n<publicationStmt>\n\nÂ <authority>James D. Benson</authority>\n\nÂ <pubPlace>London</pubPlace>\n\nÂ <date>1994</date>\n\n</publicationStmt>\n\nA resource may have (for example) both a publisher and a distributor, or more than one publisher each using different identifiers for the same resource, and so on. For this reason, the sequence of at least one model.publicationStmtPart.agency element followed by zero or more model.publicationStmtPart.detail elements may be repeated as often as necessary.\n\nThe following example shows a resource published by one agency (Sigma Press) at one address and date, which is also distributed by another (Oxford Text Archive), with a specified identifier and a different date:\n\n<publicationStmt>\n\nÂ <publisher>Sigma Press</publisher>\n\nÂ <address>\n\nÂ Â <addrLine>21 High Street,</addrLine>\n\nÂ Â <addrLine>Wilmslow,</addrLine>\n\nÂ Â <addrLine>Cheshire M24 3DF</addrLine>\n\nÂ </address>\n\nÂ <date>1991</date>\n\nÂ <distributor>Oxford Text Archive</distributor>\n\nÂ <idnoÂ type=\"OTA\">1256</idno>\n\nÂ <availability>\n\nÂ Â <p>Available with prior consent of depositor for\n\nÂ Â Â Â purposes of academic research and teaching only.</p>\n\nÂ </availability>\n\nÂ <date>1994</date>\n\n</publicationStmt>\n\nThe date element used within publicationStmt always refers to the date of publication, first distribution, or initial release. If the text was created at some other date, this may be recorded using the creation element within the profileDesc element. Other useful dates (such as dates of collection of data) may be given using a note in the notesStmt element.\n\nThe availability element may be used, as above, to provide a simple prose statement of any restrictions concerning the distribution of the resource. Alternatively, a more formal statement of the licensing conditions applicable may be provided using the licence element:\n\n<publicationStmt>\n\nÂ <publisher>University of Victoria Humanities Computing and Media Centre</publisher>\n\nÂ <pubPlace>Victoria, BC</pubPlace>\n\nÂ <date>2011</date>\n\nÂ <availabilityÂ status=\"restricted\">\n\nÂ Â <licenceÂ target=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\"> Distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License\n\nÂ Â </licence>\n\nÂ </availability>\n\n</publicationStmt>\n\nNote here the use of the target attribute to point to a location from which the licence document itself may be obtained. Alternatively, the licence document may simply be contained within the licence element.\n\nTEI: The Series Statementâï¸2.2.5 The Series Statement\n\nThe seriesStmt element is the fifth component of the fileDesc element and is optional.\n\nseriesStmt (series statement) groups information about the series, if any, to which a publication belongs.\n\nIn bibliographic parlance, a series may be defined in one of the following ways:\n\nA group of separate items related to one another by the fact that each item bears, in addition to its own title proper, a collective title applying to the group as a whole. The individual items may or may not be numbered.\n\nEach of two or more volumes of essays, lectures, articles, or other items, similar in character and issued in sequence.\n\nA separately numbered sequence of volumes within a series or serial.\n\nA seriesStmt element may contain a prose description or one or more of the following more specific elements:\n\ntitle (title) contains a title for any kind of work.\n\nidno (identifier) supplies any form of identifier used to identify some object, such as a bibliographic item, a person, a title, an organization, etc. in a standardized way.\n\nrespStmt (statement of responsibility) supplies a statement of responsibility for the intellectual content of a text, edition, recording, or series, where the specialized elements for authors, editors, etc. do not suffice or do not apply. May also be used to encode information about individuals or organizations which have played a role in the production or distribution of a bibliographic work.\n\nresp (responsibility) contains a phrase describing the nature of a person's intellectual responsibility, or an organization's role in the production or distribution of a work.\n\nname (name, proper noun) contains a proper noun or noun phrase.\n\nThe idno may be used to supply any identifying number associated with the item, including both standard numbers such as an ISSN and particular issue numbers. (Arabic numerals separated by punctuation are recommended for this purpose: 6.19.33, for example, rather than VI/xix:33). Its type attribute is used to categorize the number further, taking the value ISSN for an ISSN for example. Multiple seriesStmt elements may be supplied if the TEI document is associated with more than one series.\n\nExamples:\n\n<seriesStmt>\n\nÂ <titleÂ level=\"s\">Machine-Readable Texts for the Study of\n\nÂ Â Indian Literature</title>\n\nÂ <respStmt>\n\nÂ Â <resp>ed. by</resp>\n\nÂ Â <name>Jan Gonda</name>\n\nÂ </respStmt>\n\nÂ <biblScopeÂ unit=\"volume\">1.2</biblScope>\n\nÂ <idnoÂ type=\"ISSN\">0 345 6789</idno>\n\n</seriesStmt>\n\nTEI: The Notes Statementâï¸2.2.6 The Notes Statement\n\nThe notesStmt element is the sixth component of the fileDesc element and is optional. If used, it contains one or more note elements, each containing a single piece of descriptive information of the kind treated as âgeneral notesâ in traditional bibliographic descriptions.\n\nnotesStmt (notes statement) collects together any notes providing information about a text additional to that recorded in other parts of the bibliographic description.\n\nnote (note) contains a note or annotation.\n\nSome information found in the notes area in conventional bibliography has been assigned specific elements in these Guidelines; in particular the following items should be tagged as indicated, rather than as general notes:\n\nthe nature, scope, artistic form, or purpose of the file; also the genre or other intellectual category to which it may belong: e.g. âText types: newspaper editorials and reportage, science fiction, westerns, and detective storiesâ. These should be formally described within the profileDesc element (section 2.4 The Profile Description).\n\nan abstract or summary of the content of a document which has been supplied by the encoder because no such abstract forms part of the content of the source. This should be supplied in the abstract element within the profileDesc element (section 2.4 The Profile Description).\n\nsummary description providing a factual, non-evaluative account of the subject content of the file: e.g. âTranscribes interviews on general topics with native speakers of English in 17 cities during the spring and summer of 1963.â These should also be formally described within the profileDesc element (section 2.4 The Profile Description).\n\nbibliographic details relating to the source or sources of an electronic text: e.g. âTranscribed from the Norton facsimile of the 1623 Folioâ. These should be formally described in the sourceDesc element (section 2.2.7 The Source Description).\n\nfurther information relating to publication, distribution, or release of the text, including sources from which the text may be obtained, any restrictions on its use or formal terms on its availability. These should be placed in the appropriate division of the publicationStmt element (section 2.2.4 Publication, Distribution, Licensing, etc.).\n\npublicly documented numbers associated with the file: e.g. âICPSR study number 1803â or âOxford Text Archive text number 1243â. These should be placed in an idno element within the appropriate division of the publicationStmt element. International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSN), International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN), and other internationally agreed upon standard numbers that uniquely identify an item, should be treated in the same way, rather than as specialized bibliographic notes.\n\nNevertheless, the notesStmt element may be used to record potentially significant details about the file and its features, e.g.:\n\ndates, when they are relevant to the content or condition of the computer file: e.g. âmanual dated 1983â, âInterview wave I: Apr. 1989; wave II: Jan. 1990â\n\nnames of persons or bodies connected with the technical production, administration, or consulting functions of the effort which produced the file, if these are not named in statements of responsibility in the title or edition statements of the file description: e.g. âHistorical commentary provided by Mark Cohenâ\n\navailability of the file in an additional medium or information not already recorded about the availability of documentation: e.g. âUser manual is loose-leaf in eleven paginated sectionsâ\n\nlanguage of work and abstract, if not encoded in the langUsage element, e.g. âText in English with summaries in French and Germanâ\n\nThe unique name assigned to a serial by the International Serials Data System (ISDS), if not encoded in an idno\n\nlists of related publications, either describing the source itself, or concerned with the creation or use of the electronic work, e.g. âTexts used in Burrows (1987)â\n\nEach such item of information may be tagged using the general-purpose note element, which is described in section 3.9 Notes, Annotation, and Indexing. Groups of notes are contained within the notesStmt element, as in the following example:\n\n<notesStmt>\n\nÂ <note>Historical commentary provided by Mark Cohen.</note>\n\nÂ <note>OCR scanning done at University of Toronto.</note>\n\n</notesStmt>\n\nThere are advantages, however, to encoding such information with more precise elements elsewhere in the TEI header, when such elements are available. For example, the notes above might be encoded as follows:\n\n<titleStmt>\n\nÂ <title>â¦</title>\n\nÂ <respStmt>\n\nÂ Â <persName>Mark Cohen</persName>\n\nÂ Â <resp>historical commentary</resp>\n\nÂ </respStmt>\n\nÂ <respStmt>\n\nÂ Â <orgName>University of Toronto</orgName>\n\nÂ Â <resp>OCR scanning</resp>\n\nÂ </respStmt>\n\n</titleStmt>\n\nTEI: The Source Descriptionâï¸2.2.7 The Source Description\n\nThe sourceDesc element is the seventh and final component of the fileDesc element. It is a mandatory element and is used to record details of the source or sources from which a computer file is derived. This might be a printed text or manuscript, another computer file, an audio or video recording of some kind, or a combination of these. An electronic file may also have no source, if what is being catalogued is an original text created in electronic form.\n\nsourceDesc (source description) describes the source(s) from which an electronic text was derived or generated, typically a bibliographic description in the case of a digitized text, or a phrase such as âborn digitalâ for a text which has no previous existence.\n\nThe sourceDesc element may contain little more than a simple prose description, or a brief note stating that the document has no source:\n\n<sourceDesc>\n\nÂ <p>Born digital.</p>\n\n</sourceDesc>\n\nAlternatively, it may contain elements drawn from the following three classes:\n\nmodel.biblLike groups elements containing a bibliographic description.\n\nbibl(bibliographic citation) contains a loosely-structured bibliographic citation of which the sub-components may or may not be explicitly tagged.biblFull(fully-structured bibliographic citation) contains a fully-structured bibliographic citation, in which all components of the TEI file description are present.biblStruct(structured bibliographic citation) contains a structured bibliographic citation, in which only bibliographic sub-elements appear and in a specified order.listBibl(citation list) contains a list of bibliographic citations of any kind.msDesc(manuscript description) contains a description of a single identifiable manuscript or other text-bearing object such as an early printed book.\n\nmodel.sourceDescPart groups elements which may be used inside sourceDesc and appear multiple times.\n\nrecordingStmt(recording statement) describes a set of recordings used as the basis for transcription of a spoken text.scriptStmt(script statement) contains a citation giving details of the script used for a spoken text.\n\nmodel.listLike groups list-like elements.\n\nlist(list) contains any sequence of items organized as a list.listApp(list of apparatus entries) contains a list of apparatus entries.listEvent(list of events) contains a list of descriptions, each of which provides information about an identifiable event.listNym(list of canonical names) contains a list of nyms, that is, standardized names for any thing.listObject(list of objects) contains a list of descriptions, each of which provides information about an identifiable physical object.listOrg(list of organizations) contains a list of elements, each of which provides information about an identifiable organization.listPerson(list of persons) contains a list of descriptions, each of which provides information about an identifiable person or a group of people, for example the participants in a language interaction, or the people referred to in a historical source.listPlace(list of places) contains a list of places, optionally followed by a list of relationships (other than containment) defined amongst them.listRelationprovides information about relationships identified amongst people, places, and organizations, either informally as prose or as formally expressed relation links.listWit(witness list) lists definitions for all the witnesses referred to by a critical apparatus, optionally grouped hierarchically.table(table) contains text displayed in tabular form, in rows and columns.\n\nThese classes make available by default a range of ways of providing bibliographic citations which specify the provenance of the text. For written or printed sources, the source may be described in the same way as any other bibliographic citation, using one of the following elements:\n\nbibl (bibliographic citation) contains a loosely-structured bibliographic citation of which the sub-components may or may not be explicitly tagged.\n\nbiblStruct (structured bibliographic citation) contains a structured bibliographic citation, in which only bibliographic sub-elements appear and in a specified order.\n\nlistBibl (citation list) contains a list of bibliographic citations of any kind.\n\nThese elements are described in more detail in section 3.12 Bibliographic Citations and References. Using them, a source might be described in very simple terms:\n\n<sourceDesc>\n\nÂ <bibl>The first folio of Shakespeare, prepared by\n\nÂ Â Charlton Hinman (The Norton Facsimile, 1968)</bibl>\n\n</sourceDesc>\n\nor with more elaboration:\n\n<sourceDesc>\n\nÂ <biblStructÂ xml:lang=\"fr\">\n\nÂ Â <monogr>\n\nÂ Â Â <author>EugÃ¨ne Sue</author>\n\nÂ Â Â <title>Martin, l'enfant trouvÃ©</title>\n\nÂ Â Â <titleÂ type=\"sub\">MÃ©moires d'un valet de chambre</title>\n\nÂ Â Â <imprint>\n\nÂ Â Â Â <pubPlace>Bruxelles et Leipzig</pubPlace>\n\nÂ Â Â Â <publisher>C. Muquardt</publisher>\n\nÂ Â Â Â <dateÂ when=\"1846\">1846</date>\n\nÂ Â Â </imprint>\n\nÂ Â </monogr>\n\nÂ </biblStruct>\n\n</sourceDesc>\n\nWhen the header describes a text derived from some pre-existing TEI-conformant or other digital document, it may be simpler to use the following element, which is designed specifically for documents derived from texts which were âborn digitalâ:\n\nbiblFull (fully-structured bibliographic citation) contains a fully-structured bibliographic citation, in which all components of the TEI file description are present.\n\nFor further discussion see section 2.2.8 TEI documents derived from other TEI documents.\n\nWhen the module for manuscript description is included in a schema, this class also makes available the following element:\n\nmsDesc (manuscript description) contains a description of a single identifiable manuscript or other text-bearing object such as an early printed book.\n\nThis element enables the encoder to record very detailed information about one or more manuscript or analogous sources, as further discussed in 11 Manuscript Description.\n\nThe model.sourceDescPart class also makes available additional elements when additional modules are included. For example, when the spoken module is included, the sourceDesc element may also include the following special-purpose elements, intended for cases where an electronic text is derived from a spoken text rather than a written one:\n\nscriptStmt (script statement) contains a citation giving details of the script used for a spoken text.\n\nrecordingStmt (recording statement) describes a set of recordings used as the basis for transcription of a spoken text.\n\nFull descriptions of these elements and their contents are given in section 8.2 Documenting the Source of Transcribed Speech.\n\nA single electronic text may be derived from multiple source documents, in whole or in part. The sourceDesc may therefore contain a listBibl element grouping together bibl, biblStruct, or msDesc elements for each of the sources concerned. It is also possible to repeat the sourceDesc element in such a case. The decls attribute described in section 16.3 Associating Contextual Information with a Text may be used to associate parts of the encoded text with the bibliographic element from which it derives in either case.\n\nThe source description may also include lists of names, persons, places, etc. when these are considered to form part of the source for an encoded document. When such information is recorded using the specialized elements discussed in the namesdates module (14 Names, Dates, People, and Places), the class model.listLike makes available the following elements to hold such information:\n\nlistNym (list of canonical names) contains a list of nyms, that is, standardized names for any thing.\n\nlistOrg (list of organizations) contains a list of elements, each of which provides information about an identifiable organization.\n\nlistPerson (list of persons) contains a list of descriptions, each of which provides information about an identifiable person or a group of people, for example the participants in a language interaction, or the people referred to in a historical source.\n\nlistPlace (list of places) contains a list of places, optionally followed by a list of relationships (other than containment) defined amongst them.\n\nTEI: TEI documents derived from other TEI documentsâï¸2.2.8 TEI documents derived from other TEI documents\n\nWhen a TEI document (call it B) is derived not from a printed source but from another TEI file (call it A), then the five sections of A's file header will need to be incorporated into the new header for B as indicated below:\n\nfileDesc\n\nA's file description should be copied into the sourceDesc section of B's file description, enclosed within a biblFull element\n\nprofileDesc\n\nA's profileDesc should be copied into B's, in principle unchanged; it may however be expanded by project-specific information relating to B.\n\nencodingDesc\n\nA's encoding practice may or (more likely) may not be the same as B's. Since the object of the encoding description is to define the relationship between the current file and its source, in principle only changes in encoding practice between A and B need be documented in B. The relationship between A and its source(s) is then only recoverable from the original header of A. In practice it may be more convenient to create a new complete encodingDesc for B based on A's.\n\nxenoData\n\nB is a new computer file, with a different source than A's source (namely, A). Thus it is unlikely that metadata from other schemes about A or its source can be copied wholesale to B, although there may be similarities.\n\nrevisionDesc\n\nB is a new computer file, and should therefore have a new revision description. If, however, it is felt useful to include some information from A's revisionDesc, for example dates of major updates or versions, such information must be clearly marked as relating to A rather than to B.\n\nThis concludes the discussion of the fileDesc element and its contents.\n\nTEI: The Encoding Descriptionâï¸2.3 The Encoding Description\n\nThe encodingDesc element is the second major subdivision of the TEI header. It specifies the methods and editorial principles which governed the transcription or encoding of the text in hand and may also include sets of coded definitions used by other components of the header. Though not formally required, its use is highly recommended.\n\nencodingDesc (encoding description) documents the relationship between an electronic text and the source or sources from which it was derived.\n\nThe encoding description may contain any combination of paragraphs of text, marked up using the p element, along with more specialized elements taken from the model.encodingDescPart class. By default, this class makes available the following elements:\n\nprojectDesc (project description) describes in detail the aim or purpose for which an electronic file was encoded, together with any other relevant information concerning the process by which it was assembled or collected.\n\nsamplingDecl (sampling declaration) contains a prose description of the rationale and methods used in selecting texts, or parts of a text, for inclusion in the resource.\n\neditorialDecl (editorial practice declaration) provides details of editorial principles and practices applied during the encoding of a text.\n\ntagsDecl (tagging declaration) provides detailed information about the tagging applied to a document.\n\nstyleDefDecl (style definition language declaration) specifies the name of the formal language in which style or renditional information is supplied elsewhere in the document. The specific version of the scheme may also be supplied.\n\nrefsDecl (references declaration) specifies how canonical references are constructed for this text.\n\nclassDecl (classification declarations) contains one or more taxonomies defining any classificatory codes used elsewhere in the text.\n\ngeoDecl (geographic coordinates declaration) documents the notation and the datum used for geographic coordinates expressed as content of the geo element elsewhere within the document.\n\nunitDecl (unit declarations) provides information about units of measurement that are not members of the International System of Units.\n\nschemaSpec (schema specification) generates a TEI-conformant schema and documentation for it.\n\nschemaRef (schema reference) describes or points to a related customization or schema file\n\nEach of these elements is further described in the appropriate section below. Other modules have the ability to extend this class; examples are noted in section 2.3.12 Module-Specific Declarations\n\nTEI: The Project Descriptionâï¸2.3.1 The Project Description\n\nThe projectDesc element may be used to describe, in prose, the purpose for which a digital resource was created, together with any other relevant information concerning the process by which it was assembled or collected. This is of particular importance for corpora or miscellaneous collections, but may be of use for any text, for example to explain why one kind of encoding practice has been followed rather than another.\n\nprojectDesc (project description) describes in detail the aim or purpose for which an electronic file was encoded, together with any other relevant information concerning the process by which it was assembled or collected.\n\nFor example:\n\n<encodingDesc>\n\nÂ <projectDesc>\n\nÂ Â <p>Texts collected for use in the\n\nÂ Â Â Â Claremont Shakespeare Clinic, June 1990.</p>\n\nÂ </projectDesc>\n\n</encodingDesc>\n\nTEI: The Sampling Declarationâï¸2.3.2 The Sampling Declaration\n\nThe samplingDecl element may be used to describe, in prose, the rationale and methods used in selecting texts, or parts of text, for inclusion in the resource.\n\nsamplingDecl (sampling declaration) contains a prose description of the rationale and methods used in selecting texts, or parts of a text, for inclusion in the resource.\n\nIt should include information about such matters as\n\nthe size of individual samples\n\nthe method or methods by which they were selected\n\nthe underlying population being sampled\n\nthe object of the sampling procedure used\n\nbut is not restricted to these.\n\n<samplingDecl>\n\nÂ <p>Samples of 2000 words taken from the beginning of the text.</p>\n\n</samplingDecl>\n\nIt may also include a simple description of any parts of the source text included or excluded.\n\n<samplingDecl>\n\nÂ <p>Text of stories only has been transcribed. Pull quotes, captions,\n\nÂ Â and advertisements have been silently omitted. Any mathematical\n\nÂ Â expressions requiring symbols not present in the ISOnum or ISOpub\n\nÂ Â entity sets have been omitted, and their place marked with a GAP\n\nÂ Â element.</p>\n\n</samplingDecl>\n\nA sampling declaration which applies to more than one text or division of a text need not be repeated in the header of each such text. Instead, the decls attribute of each text (or subdivision of the text) to which the sampling declaration applies may be used to supply a cross-reference to it, as further described in section 16.3 Associating Contextual Information with a Text.\n\nTEI: The Editorial Practices Declarationâï¸2.3.3 The Editorial Practices Declaration\n\nThe editorialDecl element is used to provide details of the editorial practices applied during the encoding of a text.\n\neditorialDecl (editorial practice declaration) provides details of editorial principles and practices applied during the encoding of a text.\n\nIt may contain a prose description only, or one or more of a set of specialized elements, members of the TEI model.editorialDeclPart class. Where an encoder wishes to record an editorial policy not specified above, this may be done by adding a new element to this class, using the mechanisms discussed in chapter 24.3 Customization.\n\nSome of these policy elements carry attributes to support automated processing of certain well-defined editorial decisions; all of them contain a prose description of the editorial principles adopted with respect to the particular feature concerned. Examples of the kinds of questions which these descriptions are intended to answer are given in the list below.\n\ncorrection\n\ncorrection (correction principles) states how and under what circumstances corrections have been made in the text.\n\nstatusindicates the degree of correction applied to the text.methodindicates the method adopted to indicate corrections within the text.\n\nWas the text corrected during or after data capture? If so, were corrections made silently or are they marked using the tags described in section 3.5 Simple Editorial Changes? What principles have been adopted with respect to omissions, truncations, dubious corrections, alternate readings, false starts, repetitions, etc.?\n\nnormalization\n\nnormalization (normalization) indicates the extent of normalization or regularization of the original source carried out in converting it to electronic form.\n\nsource [att.global.source]specifies the source from which some aspect of this element is drawn.methodindicates the method adopted to indicate normalizations within the text.\n\nWas the text normalized, for example by regularizing any non-standard spellings, dialect forms, etc.? If so, were normalizations performed silently or are they marked using the tags described in section 3.5 Simple Editorial Changes? What authority was used for the regularization? Also, what principles were used when normalizing numbers to provide the standard values for the value attribute described in section 3.6.3 Numbers and Measures and what format used for them?\n\npunctuation\n\npunctuation specifies editorial practice adopted with respect to punctuation marks in the original.\n\nmarksindicates whether or not punctation marks have been retained as content within the text.placementindicates the positioning of punctuation marks that are associated with marked up text as being encoded within the element surrounding the text or immediately before or after it.\n\nAre punctuation marks present in the original source retained? Are they identified with the element pc, or implied by markup? If retained, how are they placed with respect to related elements? For example, do commas and periods appear inside or outside elements marking phrases and sentences?\n\nquotation\n\nquotation (quotation) specifies editorial practice adopted with respect to quotation marks in the original.\n\nmarks(quotation marks) indicates whether or not quotation marks have been retained as content within the text.\n\nHow were quotation marks processed? Are apostrophes and quotation marks distinguished? How? Are quotation marks retained as content in the text or replaced by markup? Are there any special conventions regarding for example the use of single or double quotation marks when nested? Is the file consistent in its practice or has this not been checked? See section 3.3.3 Quotation for discussion of ways in which quotation marks may be encoded.\n\nhyphenation\n\nhyphenation (hyphenation) summarizes the way in which hyphenation in a source text has been treated in an encoded version of it.\n\neol(end-of-line) indicates whether or not end-of-line hyphenation has been retained in a text.\n\nDoes the encoding distinguish âsoftâ and âhardâ hyphens? What principle has been adopted with respect to end-of-line hyphenation where source lineation has not been retained? Have soft hyphens been silently removed, and if so what is the effect on lineation and pagination? See section 3.2.2 Hyphenation for discussion of ways in which hyphenation may be encoded.\n\nsegmentation\n\nsegmentation (segmentation) describes the principles according to which the text has been segmented, for example into sentences, tone-units, graphemic strata, etc.\n\nHow is the text segmented? If s or seg segmentation units have been used to divide up the text for analysis, how are they marked and how was the segmentation arrived at?\n\nstdVals\n\nstdVals (standard values) specifies the format used when standardized date or number values are supplied.\n\nIn most cases, attributes bearing standardized values (such as the when or when-iso attribute on dates) should conform to a defined W3C or ISO datatype. In cases where this is not appropriate, this element may be used to describe the standardization methods underlying the values supplied.\n\ninterpretation\n\ninterpretation (interpretation) describes the scope of any analytic or interpretive information added to the text in addition to the transcription.\n\nHas any analytic or âinterpretiveâ information been providedâthat is, information which is felt to be non-obvious, or potentially contentious? If so, how was it generated? How was it encoded? If feature-structure analysis has been used, are fsdDecl elements (section 19.11 Feature System Declaration) present?\n\nAny information about the editorial principles applied not falling under one of the above headings should be recorded in a distinct list of items. Experience shows that a full record should be kept of decisions relating to editorial principles and encoding practice, both for future users of the text and for the project which produced the text in the first instance. Some simple examples follow:\n\n<editorialDecl>\n\nÂ <segmentation>\n\nÂ Â <p>\n\nÂ Â Â <gi>s</gi> elements mark orthographic sentences and\n\nÂ Â Â Â are numbered sequentially\n\nÂ Â Â Â within their parent <gi>div</gi> element\n\nÂ Â </p>\n\nÂ </segmentation>\n\nÂ <interpretation>\n\nÂ Â <p>The part of speech analysis applied throughout section 4 was\n\nÂ Â Â Â added by hand and has not been checked.</p>\n\nÂ </interpretation>\n\nÂ <correction>\n\nÂ Â <p>Errors in transcription controlled by using the\n\nÂ Â Â Â WordPerfect spelling checker.</p>\n\nÂ </correction>\n\nÂ <normalizationÂ source=\"http://szotar.sztaki.hu/webster/\">\n\nÂ Â <p>All words converted to Modern American spelling following\n\nÂ Â Â Â Websters 9th Collegiate dictionary.</p>\n\nÂ </normalization>\n\nÂ <quotationÂ marks=\"all\">\n\nÂ Â <p>All opening quotation marks represented by entity reference\n\nÂ Â <identÂ type=\"ge\">odq</ident>; all closing quotation marks\n\nÂ Â Â Â represented by entity reference <identÂ type=\"ge\">cdq</ident>.</p>\n\nÂ </quotation>\n\n</editorialDecl>\n\nAn editorial practices declaration which applies to more than one text or division of a text need not be repeated in the header of each such text. Instead, the decls attribute of each text (or subdivision of the text) to which it applies may be used to supply a cross-reference to it, as further described in section 16.3 Associating Contextual Information with a Text.\n\nTEI: The Tagging Declarationâï¸2.3.4 The Tagging Declaration\n\nThe tagsDecl element is used to record the following information about the tagging used within a particular document:\n\nthe namespace to which elements appearing within the transcribed text belong.\n\nhow often particular elements appear within the text, so that a recipient can validate the integrity of a text during interchange.\n\nany comment relating to the usage of particular elements not specified elsewhere in the header.\n\na default rendition applicable to all instances of an element.\n\nThis information is conveyed by the following elements:\n\nrendition (rendition) supplies information about the rendition or appearance of one or more elements in the source text.\n\nselectorcontains a selector or series of selectors specifying the elements to which the contained style description applies, expressed in the language specified in the scheme attribute.\n\natt.styleDef provides attributes to specify the name of a formal definition language used to provide formatting or rendition information.\n\nschemeidentifies the language used to describe the rendition.schemeVersionsupplies a version number for the style language provided in scheme.\n\nnamespace (namespace) supplies the formal name of the namespace to which the elements documented by its children belong.\n\ntagUsage (element usage) documents the usage of a specific element within a specified document.\n\nThe tagsDecl element is descriptive, rather than prescriptive: if used, it simply documents practice in the TEI document containing it. The elements constituting a TEI customization file (discussed in chapter 23 Documentation Elements) by contrast document expected practice in a number of documents, and may thus be used prescriptively. If there is an inconsistency between the actual state of a document and what is documented by its tagsDecl, then the latter should be corrected. If there is an inconsistency between a document and what is required by the customization file, or a schema derived from it, then it will usually be the document that requires correction.\n\nThe tagsDecl element consists of an optional sequence of rendition elements, each of which must bear a unique identifier, followed by an optional sequence of one or more namespace elements, each of which contains a series of tagUsage elements, up to one for each element type from that namespace occurring within the associated text element. Note that these tagUsage elements must be nested within a namespace element, and cannot appear directly within the tagsDecl element.\n\nTEI: Renditionâï¸2.3.4.1 Rendition\n\nThe rendition element allows the encoder to specify how one or more elements are rendered in the original source in any of the following ways:\n\nusing an informal prose description\n\nusing a standard stylesheet language such as CSS or XSL-FO\n\nusing a project-defined formal language\n\nOne or more such specifications may be associated with elements of a document in two ways:\n\nthe selector attribute on any rendition element may be used to select a collection of elements to which it applies\n\nthe global rendition attribute may be used on any element to indicate its rendition, overriding or complementing any supplied default value\n\nThe global rend and style attributes may also be used to describe the rendering of an element. See further 1.3.1.1.3 Rendition Indicators.\n\nThe content of a rendition element may describe the appearance of the source material using prose, a project-defined formal language, or any standard languages such as the Cascading Stylesheet Language (Bos et al. (eds.) (2011)) or the XML vocabulary for specifying formatting semantics which forms a part of the W3C's Extensible Stylesheet Language (Berglund (ed.) (2006)). A styleDefDecl element (2.3.5 The Default Style Definition Language Declaration) may be supplied within the encodingDesc to specify which of these applies by default, and it may be overridden for one or more specific rendition elements using the scheme attribute.\n\nThe recommended way to indicate a default rendition on one or more elements is to use the selector attribute together with the scheme attribute on rendition. For example, suppose that all paragraphs in the front of a text appear in a large font, with significant top and bottom margins, while paragraphs in the main body are in regular font size and have no top and bottom margins. The use of selector together with scheme provides an efficient way to specify the distinct styling for distinct contexts of the paragraph by means of CSS selectors:\n\n<renditionÂ scheme=\"css\"Â selector=\"front p\">\n\nfont-size: 110%;\n\nmargin-top: 0.5em;\n\nmargin-bottom: 0.5em;\n\n</rendition>\n\n<renditionÂ scheme=\"css\"Â selector=\"body p\">\n\nfont-size: 100%;\n\nmargin-top: 0;\n\nmargin-bottom: 0;\n\n</rendition>\n\nIn the following extended example we consider how to capture the appearance of a typical early 20th century titlepage, such as that in the following figure:\n\nElements for the encoding of the information on a titlepage are presented in 4.6 Title Pages; here we consider how we might go about encoding some of the visual information as well, using the rendition element and its corresponding attributes.\n\nFirst we define a rendition element for each aspect of the source page rendition that we wish to retain. Details of CSS are given in Bos et al. (eds.) (2011); we use it here simply to provide a vocabulary with which to describe such aspects as font size and style, letter and line spacing, colour, etc. Note that the purpose of this encoding is to describe the original, rather than specify how it should be reproduced, although the two are obviously closely linked.\n\n<styleDefDeclÂ scheme=\"css\"\n\nÂ schemeVersion=\"2.1\"/>\n\n<tagsDecl>\n\nÂ <renditionÂ xml:id=\"center\">text-align: center;</rendition>\n\nÂ <renditionÂ xml:id=\"small\">font-size: small;</rendition>\n\nÂ <renditionÂ xml:id=\"large\">font-size: large;</rendition>\n\nÂ <renditionÂ xml:id=\"x-large\">font-size: x-large;</rendition>\n\nÂ <renditionÂ xml:id=\"xx-large\">font-size: xx-large</rendition>\n\nÂ <renditionÂ xml:id=\"expanded\">letter-spacing: +3pt;</rendition>\n\nÂ <renditionÂ xml:id=\"x-space\">line-height: 150%;</rendition>\n\nÂ <renditionÂ xml:id=\"xx-space\">line-height: 200%;</rendition>\n\nÂ <renditionÂ xml:id=\"red\">color: red;</rendition>\n\n</tagsDecl>\n\nThe global rendition attribute can now be used to specify on any element which of the above rendition features apply to it. For example, a title page might be encoded as follows:\n\n<titlePage>\n\nÂ <docTitleÂ rendition=\"#center #x-space\">\n\nÂ Â <titlePart>\n\nÂ Â Â <lb/>\n\nÂ Â Â <hiÂ rendition=\"#x-large\">THE POEMS</hi>\n\nÂ Â Â <lb/>\n\nÂ Â Â <hiÂ rendition=\"#small\">OF</hi>\n\nÂ Â Â <lb/>\n\nÂ Â Â <hiÂ rendition=\"#red #xx-large\">ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE</hi>\n\nÂ Â Â <lb/>\n\nÂ Â Â <hiÂ rendition=\"#large #xx-space\">IN SIX VOLUMES</hi>\n\nÂ Â </titlePart>\n\nÂ Â <titlePartÂ rendition=\"#xx-space\">\n\nÂ Â Â <lb/> VOLUME I.\n\nÂ Â <lb/>\n\nÂ Â Â <hiÂ rendition=\"#red #x-large\">POEMS AND BALLADS</hi>\n\nÂ Â Â <lb/>\n\nÂ Â Â <hiÂ rendition=\"#x-space\">FIRST SERIES</hi>\n\nÂ Â </titlePart>\n\nÂ </docTitle>\n\nÂ <docImprintÂ rendition=\"#center\">\n\nÂ Â <lb/>\n\nÂ Â <pubPlaceÂ rendition=\"#xx-space\">LONDON</pubPlace>\n\nÂ Â <lb/>\n\nÂ Â <publisherÂ rendition=\"#red #expanded\">CHATTO &amp; WINDUS</publisher>\n\nÂ Â <lb/>\n\nÂ Â <docDateÂ when=\"1904\"Â rendition=\"#small\">1904</docDate>\n\nÂ </docImprint>\n\n</titlePage>\n\nbibliographyÂ âï¸\n\nWhen CSS is used as the style definition language, the scope attribute may be used to specify CSS pseudo-elements. These pseudo-elements are used to specify styling applicable to only a portion of the given text. For example, the first-letter pseudo-element defines styling to be applied to the first letter in the targeted element, while the before and after pseudo-elements can be used often in conjunction with the \"content\" property to add additional characters which need to be added before or after the element content to make it more closely resemble the appearance of the source.\n\nFor example, assuming that a text has been encoded using the q element to enclose passages in quotation marks, but the quotation marks themselves have been routinely omitted from the encoding, a set of renditions such as the following:\n\n<renditionÂ xml:id=\"quoteBefore\"\n\nÂ scheme=\"css\"Â scope=\"before\">content:\n\n'â';</rendition>\n\n<renditionÂ xml:id=\"quoteAfter\"Â scheme=\"css\"\n\nÂ scope=\"after\">content:\n\n'â';</rendition>\n\nmight be used to predefine pseudo-elements quoteBefore and quoteAfter. Where a q element is actually rendered in the source with initial and final quotation marks, it may then be encoded as follows:\n\n<qÂ rendition=\"#quoteBefore #quoteAfter\">Four score and seven years\n\nago...</q>\n\nTEI: Tag Usageâï¸2.3.4.2 Tag Usage\n\nAs noted above, each namespace element, if present, should contain up to one occurrence of a tagUsage element for each element type from the given namespace that occurs within the outermost text element associated with the teiHeader in which it appears.7 The tagUsage element may be used to supply a count of the number of occurrences of this element within the text, which is given as the value of its occurs attribute. It may also be used to hold any additional usage information, which is supplied as running prose within the element itself.\n\nFor example:\n\n<tagUsageÂ gi=\"hi\"Â occurs=\"28\"> Used only to mark English words italicised in the copy text.\n\n</tagUsage>\n\nThis indicates that the hi element appears a total of 28 times in the text element in question, and that the encoder has used it to mark italicised English words only.\n\nThe withId attribute may optionally be used to specify how many of the occurrences of the element in question bear a value for the global xml:id attribute, as in the following example:\n\n<tagUsageÂ gi=\"pb\"Â occurs=\"321\"Â withId=\"321\"> Marks page breaks in the York\n\n(1734) edition only </tagUsage>\n\nThis indicates that the pb element occurs 321 times, on each of which an identifier is provided.\n\nThe content of the tagUsage element is not susceptible of automatic processing. It should not therefore be used to hold information for which provision is already made by other components of the encoding description. A TEI-conformant document is not required to provide any tagUsage elements or occurs attributes, but if it does, then the counts provided must correspond with the number of such elements present in the associated text.\n\nTEI: The Default Style Definition Language Declarationâï¸2.3.5 The Default Style Definition Language Declaration\n\nThe content of the rendition element, the value of its selector attribute, and the value of the style attribute are expressed using one of a small number of formally defined style definition languages. For ease of processing, it is strongly recommended to use a single such language throughout an encoding project, although the TEI system permits a mixture.\n\nThe element styleDefDecl, a sibling of the tagsDecl element, is used to supply the name of the default style definition language. The name is supplied as the value of the scheme attribute and may take any of the following values:\n\nfree\n\nInformal free text description\n\ncss\n\nCascading Stylesheet Language\n\nxslfo\n\nExtensible Stylesheet Language Formatting Objects\n\nother\n\nA user-defined formal description language\n\n. The schemeVersion attribute may be used to supply the precise version of the style definition language used, and the content of this element, if any, may supply additional information.\n\nWhen the style attribute is used, its value must always be expressed using whichever default style definition language is in force. If more than one occurrence of the styleDefDecl is provided, there will be more than one default available, and the decls attribute must be used to select which is applicable in a given context, as discussed in section 16.3 Associating Contextual Information with a Text.\n\nTEI: The Reference System Declarationâï¸2.3.6 The Reference System Declaration\n\nThe refsDecl element is used to document the way in which any standard referencing scheme built into the encoding works.\n\nrefsDecl (references declaration) specifies how canonical references are constructed for this text.\n\nIt may contain either a series of prose paragraphs or the following specialized elements:\n\nciteStructure (citation structure) declares a structure and method for citing the current document.\n\ncRefPattern (canonical reference pattern) specifies an expression and replacement pattern for transforming a canonical reference into a URI.\n\nrefState (reference state) specifies one component of a canonical reference defined by the milestone method.\n\natt.patternReplacement provides attributes for regular-expression matching and replacement.\n\nmatchPatternspecifies a regular expression against which the values of other attributes can be matched.replacementPatternspecifies a âreplacement patternâ, that is, the skeleton of a relative or absolute URI containing references to groups in the matchPattern which, once subpattern substitution has been performed, complete the URI.\n\natt.citeStructurePart provides attributes for selecting particular elements within a document.\n\nuse(use) supplies an XPath selection pattern using the syntax defined in Kay (ed.) (2017). The XPath pattern is relative to the context given in match, which will either be a sibling attribute in the case of <citeStructure> or on the parent <citeStructure> in the case of <citeData>.\n\nNote that not all possible referencing schemes are equally easily supported by current software systems. A choice must be made between the convenience of the encoder and the likely efficiency of the particular software applications envisaged, in this context as in many others. For a more detailed discussion of referencing systems supported by these Guidelines, see section 3.11 Reference Systems below.\n\nA referencing scheme may be described in one of four ways using this element:\n\nas a prose description\n\nas nested set of citation structure declarations\n\nas a series of pairs of regular expressions and XPaths\n\nas a concatenation of sequentially organized milestones\n\nEach method is described in more detail below. Only one method can be used within a single refsDecl element.\n\nMore than one refsDecl element can be included in the header if more than one canonical reference scheme is to be used in the same document, but the current proposals do not check for mutual inconsistency.\n\nTEI: Prose Methodâï¸2.3.6.1 Prose Method\n\nThe referencing scheme may be specified within the refsDecl by a simple prose description. Such a description should indicate which elements carry identifying information, and whether this information is represented as attribute values or as content. Any special rules about how the information is to be interpreted when reading or generating a reference string should also be specified here. Such a prose description cannot be processed automatically, and this method of specifying the structure of a canonical reference system is therefore not recommended for automatic processing.\n\nFor example:\n\n<refsDecl>\n\nÂ <p>The <att>n</att> attribute of each text in this corpus carries a\n\nÂ Â unique identifying code for the whole text. The title of the text is\n\nÂ Â held as the content of the first <gi>head</gi> element within each\n\nÂ Â text. The <att>n</att> attribute on each <gi>div1</gi> and\n\nÂ <gi>div2</gi> contains the canonical reference for each such\n\nÂ Â division, in the form 'XX.yyy', where XX is the book number in Roman\n\nÂ Â numerals, and yyy the section number in arabic. Line breaks are\n\nÂ Â marked by empty <gi>lb</gi> elements, each of which includes the\n\nÂ Â through line number in Casaubon's edition as the value of its\n\nÂ <gi>n</gi> attribute.</p>\n\nÂ <p>The through line number and the text identifier uniquely identify\n\nÂ Â any line. A canonical reference may be made up by concatenating the\n\nÂ <gi>n</gi> values from the <gi>text</gi>, <gi>div1</gi>, or\n\nÂ <gi>div2</gi> and calculating the line number within each part.</p>\n\n</refsDecl>\n\nTEI: Search-and-Replace Methodâï¸2.3.6.2 Search-and-Replace Method\n\nThis method often requires a significant investment of effort initially, but permits extremely flexible addressing. For details, see section 17.2.5 Canonical References.\n\ncRefPattern (canonical reference pattern) specifies an expression and replacement pattern for transforming a canonical reference into a URI.\n\nTEI: Milestone Methodâï¸2.3.6.3 Milestone Method\n\nThis method is appropriate when only âmilestoneâ tags (see section 3.11.3 Milestone Elements) are available to provide the required referencing information. It does not provide any abilities which cannot be mimicked by the search-and-replace referencing method discussed in the previous section, but in the cases where it applies, it provides a somewhat simpler notation.\n\nA reference based on milestone tags concatenates the values specified by one or more such tags. Since each tag marks the point at which a value changes, it may be regarded as specifying the refState of a variable. A reference declaration using this method therefore specifies the individual components of the canonical reference as a sequence of refState elements:\n\nrefState (reference state) specifies one component of a canonical reference defined by the milestone method.\n\ndelim(delimiter) supplies a delimiting string following the reference component.lengthspecifies the fixed length of the reference component.\n\natt.milestoneUnit provides attributes to indicate the type of section which is changing at a specific milestone.\n\nunitprovides a conventional name for the kind of section changing at this milestone. Suggested values include: 1] page; 2] column; 3] line; 4] book; 5] poem; 6] canto; 7] speaker; 8] stanza; 9] act; 10] scene; 11] section; 12] absent; 13] unnumbered\n\nFor example, the reference âMatthew 12:34â might be thought of as representing the state of three variables: the book variable is in state âMatthewâ; the chapter variable is in state â12â, and the verse variable is in state â34â. If milestone tagging has been used, there should be a tag marking the point in the text at which each of the above âvariablesâ changes its state.8 To find âMatthew 12:34â therefore an application must scan left to right through the text, monitoring changes in the state of each of these three variables as it does so. When all three are simultaneously in the required state, the desired point will have been reached. There may of course be several such points.\n\nThe delim and length attributes are used to specify components of a canonical reference using this method in exactly the same way as for the stepwise method described in the preceding section. The other attributes are used to determine which instances of milestone tags in the text are to be checked for state-changes. A state-change is signalled whenever a new milestone tag is found with unit and, optionally, ed attributes identical to those of the refState element in question. The value for the new state may be given explicitly by the n attribute on the milestone element, or it may be implied, if the n attribute is not specified.\n\nFor example, for canonical references in the form xx.yyy where the xx represents the page number in the first edition, and yyy the line number within this page, a reference system declaration such as the following would be appropriate:\n\n<refsDecl>\n\nÂ <refStateÂ ed=\"first\"Â unit=\"page\"Â length=\"2\"\n\nÂ Â delim=\".\"/>\n\nÂ <refStateÂ ed=\"first\"Â unit=\"line\"Â length=\"3\"/>\n\n</refsDecl>\n\nbibliographyÂ âï¸\n\nThis implies that milestone tags of the form\n\n<milestoneÂ n=\"II\"Â ed=\"first\"Â unit=\"page\"/>\n\n<milestoneÂ ed=\"first\"Â unit=\"line\"/>\n\nbibliographyÂ âï¸\n\nwill be found throughout the text, marking the positions at which page and line numbers change. Note that no value has been specified for the n attribute on the second milestone tag above; this implies that its value at each state change is monotonically increased. For more detail on the use of milestone tags, see section 3.11.3 Milestone Elements.\n\nThe milestone referencing scheme, though conceptually simple, is not supported by a generic XML parser. Its use places a correspondingly greater burden of verification and accuracy on the encoder.\n\nA reference system declaration which applies to more than one text or division of a text need not be repeated in the header of each such text. Instead, the decls attribute of each text (or subdivision of the text) to which the declaration applies may be used to supply a cross-reference to it, as further described in section 16.3 Associating Contextual Information with a Text.\n\nTEI: The Classification Declarationâï¸2.3.7 The Classification Declaration\n\nThe classDecl element is used to group together definitions or sources for any descriptive classification schemes used by other parts of the header or elsewhere in the document. Each such scheme is represented by a taxonomy element, which may contain either a simple bibliographic citation, or a definition of the descriptive typology concerned; the following elements are used in defining a descriptive classification scheme:\n\nclassDecl (classification declarations) contains one or more taxonomies defining any classificatory codes used elsewhere in the text.\n\ntaxonomy (taxonomy) defines a typology either implicitly, by means of a bibliographic citation, or explicitly by a structured taxonomy.\n\ncategory (category) contains an individual descriptive category, possibly nested within a superordinate category, within a user-defined taxonomy.\n\ncatDesc (category description) describes some category within a taxonomy or text typology, either in the form of a brief prose description or in terms of the situational parameters used by the TEI formal textDesc.\n\nThe taxonomy element has two slightly different, but related, functions. For well-recognized and documented public classification schemes, such as Dewey or other published descriptive thesauri, it contains simply a bibliographic citation indicating where a full description of a particular taxonomy may be found.\n\n<taxonomyÂ xml:id=\"DDC12\">\n\nÂ <bibl>\n\nÂ Â <title>Dewey Decimal Classification</title>\n\nÂ Â <edition>Abridged Edition 12</edition>\n\nÂ </bibl>\n\n</taxonomy>\n\nFor less easily accessible schemes, the taxonomy element contains a description of the taxonomy itself as well as an optional bibliographic citation. The description consists of a number of category elements, each defining a single category within the given typology. The category is defined by the contents of a nested catDesc element, which may contain either a phrase describing the category, or any number of elements from the model.catDescPart class. When the corpus module is included in a schema, this class provides the textDesc element whose components allow the definition of a text type in terms of a set of âsituational parametersâ (see further section 16.2.1 The Text Description; if the corpus module is not included in a schema, this class is empty and the catDesc element may contain only plain text.\n\nIf the category is subdivided, each subdivision is represented by a nested category element, having the same structure. Categories may be nested to an arbitrary depth in order to reflect the hierarchical structure of the taxonomy. Each category element bears a unique xml:id attribute, which is used as the target for catRef elements referring to it.\n\n<taxonomyÂ xml:id=\"b\">\n\nÂ <bibl>Brown Corpus</bibl>\n\nÂ <categoryÂ xml:id=\"b.a\">\n\nÂ Â <catDesc>Press Reportage</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â <categoryÂ xml:id=\"b.a1\">\n\nÂ Â Â <catDesc>Daily</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â </category>\n\nÂ Â <categoryÂ xml:id=\"b.a2\">\n\nÂ Â Â <catDesc>Sunday</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â </category>\n\nÂ Â <categoryÂ xml:id=\"b.a3\">\n\nÂ Â Â <catDesc>National</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â </category>\n\nÂ Â <categoryÂ xml:id=\"b.a4\">\n\nÂ Â Â <catDesc>Provincial</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â </category>\n\nÂ Â <categoryÂ xml:id=\"b.a5\">\n\nÂ Â Â <catDesc>Political</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â </category>\n\nÂ Â <categoryÂ xml:id=\"b.a6\">\n\nÂ Â Â <catDesc>Sports</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â </category>\n\nÂ </category>\n\nÂ <categoryÂ xml:id=\"b.d\">\n\nÂ Â <catDesc>Religion</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â <categoryÂ xml:id=\"b.d1\">\n\nÂ Â Â <catDesc>Books</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â </category>\n\nÂ Â <categoryÂ xml:id=\"b.d2\">\n\nÂ Â Â <catDesc>Periodicals and tracts</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â </category>\n\nÂ </category>\n\n</taxonomy>\n\nLinkage between a particular text and a category within such a taxonomy is made by means of the catRef element within the textClass element, as described in section 2.4.3 The Text Classification. Where finer-grained analysis is desired, the ana attribute on an element in the text could point to a category, as in the following abbreviated example:\n\n<taxonomy>\n\nÂ <categoryÂ xml:id=\"poe\">\n\nÂ Â <catDesc>Poetry</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â <categoryÂ xml:id=\"sonn\">\n\nÂ Â Â <catDesc>Sonnet</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â Â <categoryÂ xml:id=\"shakesSonn\">\n\nÂ Â Â Â <catDesc>Shakespearean Sonnet</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â Â </category>\n\nÂ Â Â <categoryÂ xml:id=\"petraSonn\">\n\nÂ Â Â Â <catDesc>Petrarchan Sonnet</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â Â </category>\n\nÂ Â </category>\n\nÂ Â <categoryÂ xml:id=\"met\">\n\nÂ Â Â <catDesc>Metrical Categories</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â Â <categoryÂ xml:id=\"ft\">\n\nÂ Â Â Â <catDesc>Metrical Feet</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â Â Â <categoryÂ xml:id=\"iamb\">\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â <catDesc>Iambic</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â Â Â </category>\n\nÂ Â Â Â <categoryÂ xml:id=\"troch\">\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â <catDesc>trochaic</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â Â Â </category>\n\nÂ Â Â </category>\n\nÂ Â Â <categoryÂ xml:id=\"ftNm\">\n\nÂ Â Â Â <catDesc>Number of feet</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â Â Â <categoryÂ xml:id=\"penta\">\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â <catDesc>>Pentameter</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â Â Â </category>\n\nÂ Â Â Â <categoryÂ xml:id=\"tetra\">\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â <catDesc>>Tetrameter</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â Â Â </category>\n\nÂ Â Â </category>\n\nÂ Â </category>\n\nÂ </category>\n\n</taxonomy>\n\n<lgÂ ana=\"#shakesSonnet #iamb #penta\">\n\nÂ <l>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day</l>\n\n</lg>\n\nbibliographyÂ âï¸\n\nWhere the taxonomy permits of classification along more than one dimension, more than one category will be referenced by a particular catRef, as in the following example, which identifies a text with the sub-categories âDailyâ, âNationalâ, and âPoliticalâ within the category âPress Reportageâ as defined above.\n\n<catRefÂ target=\"#b.a1 #b.a3 #b.a5\"/>\n\nbibliographyÂ âï¸\n\nA single category may contain more than one catDesc child, when for example the category is described in more than one language, as in the following example:\n\n<categoryÂ xml:id=\"lit\">\n\nÂ <catDescÂ xml:lang=\"pl\">literatura piÄkna</catDesc>\n\nÂ <catDescÂ xml:lang=\"en\">fiction</catDesc>\n\nÂ <categoryÂ xml:id=\"litProza\">\n\nÂ Â <catDescÂ xml:lang=\"pl\">proza</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â <catDescÂ xml:lang=\"en\">prose</catDesc>\n\nÂ </category>\n\nÂ <categoryÂ xml:id=\"litPoezja\">\n\nÂ Â <catDescÂ xml:lang=\"pl\">poezja</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â <catDescÂ xml:lang=\"en\">poetry</catDesc>\n\nÂ </category>\n\nÂ <categoryÂ xml:id=\"litDramat\">\n\nÂ Â <catDescÂ xml:lang=\"pl\">dramat</catDesc>\n\nÂ Â <catDescÂ xml:lang=\"en\">drama</catDesc>\n\nÂ </category>\n\n</category>\n\nTEI: The Geographic Coordinates Declarationâï¸2.3.8 The Geographic Coordinates Declaration\n\nThe following element is provided to indicate (within the header of a document, or in an external location) that a particular coordinate notation, or a particular datum, has been employed in a text. The default notation is a string containing two real numbers separated by whitespace, of which the first indicates latitude and the second longitude according to the 1984 World Geodetic System (WGS84).\n\ngeoDecl (geographic coordinates declaration) documents the notation and the datum used for geographic coordinates expressed as content of the geo element elsewhere within the document.\n\ndatumsupplies a commonly used code name for the datum employed. Suggested values include: 1] WGS84 (World Geodetic System); 2] MGRS (Military Grid Reference System); 3] OSGB36 (ordnance survey great britain); 4] ED50 (European Datum coordinate system)\n\nTEI: The Unit Declarationâï¸2.3.9 The Unit Declaration\n\nWhen documents feature units of measurement that are not listed in the International System of Units, the unitDecl element may be used in the encoding description to provide definitions and information about their origins and equivalents.\n\nunitDecl (unit declarations) provides information about units of measurement that are not members of the International System of Units.\n\nThe unitDecl contains one or more unitDef child elements that serve to describe units of measure which may be marked in unit elements within the text.\n\nunitDef (unit definition) contains descriptive information related to a specific unit of measurement.\n\nunit contains a symbol, a word or a phrase referring to a unit of measurement in any kind of formal or informal system.\n\nconversion defines how to calculate one unit of measure in terms of another.\n\nfromUnitindicates a source unit of measure that is to be converted into another unit indicated in toUnit.toUnitthe target unit of measurement for a conversion from a source unit referenced in fromUnit.from [att.datable.w3c]indicates the starting point of the period in standard form, e.g. yyyy-mm-dd.to [att.datable.w3c]indicates the ending point of the period in standard form, e.g. yyyy-mm-dd.notBefore [att.datable.w3c]specifies the earliest possible date for the event in standard form, e.g. yyyy-mm-dd.notAfter [att.datable.w3c]specifies the latest possible date for the event in standard form, e.g. yyyy-mm-dd.when [att.datable.w3c]supplies the value of the date or time in a standard form, e.g. yyyy-mm-dd.\n\natt.formula provides attributes for defining a mathematical formula.\n\nformulaA formula is provided to describe a mathematical calculation such as a conversion between measurement systems.\n\natt.locatable provides attributes for referencing locations by pointing to entries in a canonical list of places.\n\nwhereindicates one or more locations by pointing to a place element or other canonical description.\n\nWithin the unitDef, a conversion element may be used to store information relating to conversion between units. The conversion element holds a special pair of attributes, fromUnit and toUnit, which serve to indicate the direction of a calculation from one unit of measure (stored in fromUnit) to another (stored in toUnit). A mathematical calculation to define the relation between these units may be stored in formula, as shown in the following examples. The formula attribute takes a value expressed as an XPath expression, for which see Robie et al. (eds.) (2017). Among other things, this means that division must be expressed with âdivâ as opposed to the more common forward slash (â/â, U+002F), so as not to be confused with path navigation. The conversion element may also use attributes to store dates and date ranges as well as location(s) that specify when and where a conversion formula was applied.\n\n<encodingDesc>\n\nÂ <unitDecl>\n\nÂ Â <unitDefÂ xml:id=\"keel\"Â type=\"weight\">\n\nÂ Â Â <label>keel</label>\n\nÂ Â Â <placeNameÂ ref=\"#england\"/>\n\nÂ Â Â <conversionÂ fromUnit=\"#chalder\"\n\nÂ Â Â Â toUnit=\"#keel\"Â formula=\"$fromUnit * 20\"Â from=\"1421\"\n\nÂ Â Â Â to=\"1676\"/>\n\nÂ Â Â <conversionÂ fromUnit=\"#chalder\"\n\nÂ Â Â Â toUnit=\"#keel\"Â formula=\"$fromUnit * 16\"Â from=\"1676\"\n\nÂ Â Â Â to=\"1824\"/>\n\nÂ Â Â <desc>Keel was a unit measuring weight of coal.

Typical uses for such information might be:\n\nto allow an application to discover that it has previously opened or edited a file, and what version of itself was used to do that;\n\nto show (through a date) which application last edited the file to allow for diagnosis of any problems that might have been caused by that application;\n\nto allow users to discover information about an application used to edit the file\n\nto allow the application to declare an interest in elements of the file which it has edited, so that other applications or human editors may be more wary of making changes to those sections of the file.\n\nThe class model.applicationLike provides an element, application, which may be used to record such information within the appInfo element.\n\nappInfo (application information) records information about an application which has edited the TEI file.\n\napplication provides information about an application which has acted upon the document.\n\nidentsupplies an identifier for the application, independent of its version number or display name.versionsupplies a version number for the application, independent of its identifier or display name.\n\nEach application element identifies the current state of one software application with regard to the current file. This element is a member of the att.datable class, which provides a variety of attributes for associating this state with a date and time, or a temporal range. The ident and version attributes should be used to uniquely identify the application and its major version number (for example, ImageMarkupTool 1.5). It is not intended that an application should add a new application each time it touches the file.\n\nThe following example shows how these elements might be used to document the fact that version 1.5 of an application called âImage Markup Toolâ has an interest in two parts of a document which was last saved on June 6 2006. The parts concerned are accessible at the URLs given as target for the two ptr elements.\n\n<appInfo>\n\nÂ <applicationÂ version=\"1.5\"\n\nÂ Â ident=\"ImageMarkupTool\"Â notAfter=\"2006-06-01\">\n\nÂ Â <label>Image Markup Tool</label>\n\nÂ Â <ptrÂ target=\"#P1\"/>\n\nÂ Â <ptrÂ target=\"#P2\"/>\n\nÂ </application>\n\n</appInfo>\n\nTEI: Module-Specific Declarationsâï¸2.3.12 Module-Specific Declarations\n\nThe elements discussed so far are available to any schema. When the schema in use includes some of the more specialized TEI modules, these make available other more module-specific components of the encoding description. These are discussed fully in the documentation for the module in question, but are also noted briefly here for convenience.\n\nThe fsdDecl element is available only when the iso-fs module is included in a schema. Its purpose is to document the feature system declaration (as defined in chapter 19.11 Feature System Declaration) underlying any analytic feature structures (as defined in chapter 19 Feature Structures) present in the text documented by this header.\n\nThe metDecl element is available only when the verse module is included in a schema. Its purpose is to document any metrical notation scheme used in the text, as further discussed in section 6.4 Rhyme and Metrical Analysis. It consists either of a prose description or a series of metSym elements.\n\nThe variantEncoding element is available only when the textcrit module is included in a schema. Its purpose is to document the method used to encode textual variants in the text, as discussed in section 13.2 Linking the Apparatus to the Text.\n\nTEI: The Profile Descriptionâï¸2.4 The Profile Description\n\nThe profileDesc element is the third major subdivision of the TEI header. It is an optional element, the purpose of which is to enable information characterizing various descriptive aspects of a text or a corpus to be recorded within a single unified framework.\n\nprofileDesc (text-profile description) provides a detailed description of non-bibliographic aspects of a text, specifically the languages and sublanguages used, the situation in which it was produced, the participants and their setting.\n\nIn principle, almost any component of the header might be of importance as a means of characterizing a text. The author of a written text, its title or its date of publication, may all be regarded as characterizing it at least as strongly as any of the parameters discussed in this section. The rule of thumb applied has been to exclude from discussion here most of the information which generally forms part of a standard bibliographic style description, if only because such information has already been included elsewhere in the TEI header.\n\nThe profileDesc element contains elements taken from the model.profileDescPart class. The default members of this class are the following :\n\nabstract contains a summary or formal abstract prefixed to an existing source document by the encoder.\n\ncreation (creation) contains information about the creation of a text.\n\nlangUsage (language usage) describes the languages, sublanguages, registers, dialects, etc. represented within a text.\n\ntextClass (text classification) groups information which describes the nature or topic of a text in terms of a standard classification scheme, thesaurus, etc.\n\ncorrespDesc (correspondence description) contains a description of the actions related to one act of correspondence.\n\ncalendarDesc (calendar description) contains a description of the calendar system used in any dating expression found in the text.\n\nThese elements are further described in the remainder of this section.\n\nWhen the corpus module described in chapter 16 Language Corpora is included in a schema, three further elements become available within the profileDesc element:\n\ntextDesc (text description) provides a description of a text in terms of its situational parameters.\n\nparticDesc (participation description) describes the identifiable speakers, voices, or other participants in any kind of text or other persons named or otherwise referred to in a text, edition, or metadata.\n\nsettingDesc (setting description) describes the setting or settings within which a language interaction takes place, or other places otherwise referred to in a text, edition, or metadata.\n\nFor descriptions of these elements, see section 16.2 Contextual Information.\n\nWhen the transcr module for the transcription of primary sources described in chapter 12 Representation of Primary Sources is included in a schema, the following elements become available within the profileDesc element:\n\nhandNotes contains one or more handNote elements documenting the different hands identified within the source texts.\n\nlistTranspose supplies a list of transpositions, each of which is indicated at some point in a document typically by means of metamarks.\n\nFor a description of the handNotes element, see section 12.3.2.1 Document Hands. Its purpose is to group together a number of handNote elements, each of which describes a different hand or equivalent identified within a manuscript. The handNote element can also appear within a structured manuscript description, when the msdescription module described in chapter 11 Manuscript Description is included in a schema. For this reason, the handNote element is actually declared within the header module, but is only accessible to a schema when one or other of the transcr or msdescription modules is included in a schema. See further the discussion at 12.3.2.1 Document Hands.\n\nThe listTranspose element is discussed in detail in section 12.3.4.5 Transpositions.\n\nTEI: Creationâï¸2.4.1 Creation\n\nThe creation element contains phrases describing the origin of the text, e.g. the date and place of its composition.\n\ncreation (creation) contains information about the creation of a text.\n\nThe date and place of composition are often of particular importance for studies of linguistic variation; since such information cannot be inferred with confidence from the bibliographic description of the copy text, the creation element may be used to provide a consistent location for this information:\n\n<creation>\n\nÂ <dateÂ when=\"1992-08\">August 1992</date>\n\nÂ <rsÂ type=\"city\">Taos, New Mexico</rs>\n\n</creation>\n\nTEI: Language Usageâï¸2.4.2 Language Usage\n\nThe langUsage element is used within the profileDesc element to describe the languages, sublanguages, registers, dialects, etc. represented within a text. It contains one or more language elements, each of which provides information about a single language, notably the quantity of that language present in the text. Note that this element should not be used to supply information about any non-standard characters or glyphs used by this language; such information should be recorded in the charDecl element in the encoding description (see further 5 Characters, Glyphs, and Writing Modes).\n\nlangUsage (language usage) describes the languages, sublanguages, registers, dialects, etc. represented within a text.\n\nlanguage (language) characterizes a single language or sublanguage used within a text.\n\nusagespecifies the approximate percentage of the text which uses this language.ident(identifier) Supplies a language code constructed as defined in BCP 47 which is used to identify the language documented by this element, and which may be referenced by the global xml:lang attribute.\n\nA language element may be supplied for each different language used in a document. If used, its ident attribute should specify an appropriate language identifier, as further discussed in section vi.1. Language Identification. This is particularly important if extended language identifiers have been used as the value of xml:lang attributes elsewhere in the document.\n\nHere is an example of the use of this element:\n\n<langUsage>\n\nÂ <languageÂ ident=\"fr-CA\"Â usage=\"60\">QuÃ©becois</language>\n\nÂ <languageÂ ident=\"en-CA\"Â usage=\"20\">Canadian business English</language>\n\nÂ <languageÂ ident=\"en-GB\"Â usage=\"20\">British English</language>\n\n</langUsage>\n\nTEI: The Text Classificationâï¸2.4.3 The Text Classification\n\nThe textClass element is used to classify a text in some way.\n\ntextClass (text classification) groups information which describes the nature or topic of a text in terms of a standard classification scheme, thesaurus, etc.\n\nText classification may be carried out according to one or more of the following methods:\n\nby reference to a recognized international classification such as the Dewey Decimal Classification, the Universal Decimal Classification, the Colon Classification, the Library of Congress Classification, or any other system widely used in library and documentation work\n\nby providing a set of keywords, as provided for example by British Library or Library of Congress Cataloguing in Publication data\n\nby referencing any other taxonomy of text categories recognized in the field concerned, or peculiar to the material in hand; this may include one based on recurring sets of values for the situational parameters defined in section 16.2.1 The Text Description, or the demographic elements described in section 16.2.2 The Participant Description\n\nThe last of these may be particularly important for dealing with existing corpora or collections, both as a means of avoiding the expense or inconvenience of reclassification and as a means of documenting the organizing principles of such materials.\n\nThe following elements are provided for this purpose:\n\nkeywords (keywords) contains a list of keywords or phrases identifying the topic or nature of a text.\n\nschemeidentifies the controlled vocabulary within which the set of keywords concerned is defined, for example by a taxonomy element, or by some other resource.\n\nclassCode (classification code) contains the classification code used for this text in some standard classification system.\n\nschemeidentifies the classification system in use, as defined by, e.g. a taxonomy element, or some other resource.\n\ncatRef (category reference) specifies one or more defined categories within some taxonomy or text typology.\n\nThe keywords element simply categorizes an individual text by supplying a list of keywords which may describe its topic or subject matter, its form, date, etc. In some schemes, the order of items in the list is significant, for example, from major topic to minor; in others, the list has an organized substructure of its own. No recommendations are made here as to which method is to be preferred. Wherever possible, such keywords should be taken from a recognized source, such as the British Library/Library of Congress Cataloguing in Publication data in the case of printed books, or a published thesaurus appropriate to the field.\n\nThe scheme attribute is used to indicate the source of the keywords used, in the case where such a source exists. If the keywords are taken from an externally defined authority which is available online, this attribute should point directly to it, as in the following examples:\n\n<keywordsÂ scheme=\"http://classificationweb.net\">\n\nÂ <term>Babbage, Charles</term>\n\nÂ <term>Mathematicians - Great Britain - Biography</term>\n\n</keywords>\n\n<keywordsÂ scheme=\"http://id.loc.gov/authorities/about.html#lcsh\">\n\nÂ <term>English literature -- History and criticism -- Data processing.</term>\n\nÂ <term>English literature -"
