An International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) or International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a number used to uniquely identify a serial or book publication. To obtain an ISSN, you need to register with the ISSN International Centre; and for an ISBN, with your national ISBN agency.

ISSNs/ISBNs are useful in distinguishing between serials or books with the same title. If a publication with the same content is published in more than one format, a different identifier is assigned to each media type. For example, a journal may have a print ISSN and an electronic ISSN, and print and ebooks have different ISBNs.

Include the title and ISSN/ISBN when you first deposit metadata for a content item in our system (if applicable)

Include both print and electronic ISSNs/ISBNs (if applicable)

If the journal does not have an ISSN at the time of registering content for it, include a title-level DOI for the journal. Once the ISSN is known, deposits should include both the ISSN and the journal-level DOI. Ideally, you would also update the metadata for all the previously registered content to include the ISSN.
