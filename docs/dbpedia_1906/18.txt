The BLUE ANGEL (German: Blauer Engel) is the oldest eco-label in the world, widely used primarily in Germany and the rest of Western Europe. Since 1978, the Blue Angel has been a benchmark for environmentally friendly products and services, selected by an independent jury according to established and publicly available criteria. It focuses primarily on the processing of raw materials and the manufacture of the final product to minimise negative environmental impacts throughout the production process.

The Blue Angel is a type I environmental label according to EN ISO 14024 'Environmental labels and declarations. Type I environmental labelling. Principles and procedures'. Blue Angel was used as a model for the development of this ISO standard, on which, in turn, many new global environmental labels are based today.
