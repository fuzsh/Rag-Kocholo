        "text": "Hello, is this version 3.6.9? What term are you searching for? This may have something to do with the internet, or the image being in GIF format.\n\nHi, thanks for your reply.\n\nYes , the version us 3.6.9 more exactly (3.6.9.9003)\n\nI looked for the term “Renormalization” in Wikipedia in English.\n\nI opened a web browser and checked the same and no problem with this, so it is not an Internet problem.\n\nThe images are png, but some another png works fine.\n\nCheck yourself. I attach an image from MarginNote an another from a normal browser.\n\nI also attach another corresponding to the search for “Improper Integral” in Wikipedia\n\nRegards,\n\nAngel\n\nHello. I realized that a new update of the software, was issued.\n\nBut unfortunately, I checked it and the problem still persists. Only to inform you about it.\n\nThanks in advanced,\n\nAngel\n\nHello, thanks for the feedback, this is also related to the web page, we haven’t found a response yet.\n\nIf you need any help, please feel free to contact us and we will be happy to help further.\n\nHello\n\nThere should be no problem, if you wait for the browser to complete the loading - if the equation shows up in the browser then you should be able to see it after the import.\n\nFor the iOS version, the problem is that contents in wikipedia is folded - so you need to manually open it to let it load.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nMarginNote-QSD\n\nSupport Team"
