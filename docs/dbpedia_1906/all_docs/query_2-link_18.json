        "text": "1999 novel by Paul Magrs and Jeremy Hoad\n\nThe Blue Angel is an original novel written by Paul Magrs and Jeremy Hoad and based on the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who. It features the Eighth Doctor, Fitz, Compassion and Iris Wildthyme.\n\nThe novel has been dramatised by Dr. Piers Britton for a design class at the University of Redlands, California. The setting and some of the characters from the Obverse Universe featured in the book were re-used by Philip Purser-Hallard in his Doctor Who short story \"Cabinet of Changes\".\n\nIn his review of the novel, Robert Shearman noted the striking similarity between the portrayal of Fitz and the then Conservative Party leader, William Hague. \"Despite the plot pyrotechnics,\" he wrote, \"there is a great deal of crossover between this novel, in its portrayal of a bygone England and the Conservative manifesto of the last general election.\".[1]\n\nThe Cloister Library - The Blue Angel\n\nScript of The Blue Angel dramatisation Archived 29 May 2013 at the Wayback Machine\n\nThe Blue Angel title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database"
