        "text": "I worked with an old version of Vivaldi browser for a few years (don't remember which version anymore) that didn't auto-update.\n\nStupid as I was, I fixed something that wasn't broken by updating Vivaldi to latest version some months ago. Then I noticed the new version doesn't display Wikipedia pages (they remain blank) when I have the browser open for a while. Then I have to restart the browser to fix it.\n\nA couple weeks ago a new update came out and I hoped it would fix such an obvious bug. Alas, still the same problem. What do?\n\n@viteklis Hello and Welcome to the Vivaldi Community\n\nI tested my extension and it goes away if I disable UBlock Origin.\n\nThen the next logical question is: What differences are between those other browser installations of uBO and in Vivaldi?\n\nDifferent block lists?\n\nBlocklists updated recently or maybe not in a long time?\n\nSpecific settings/filters/rules you have set?\n\nuBO has a logger feature that will allow you to see what blocklists are in effect when requests are blocked which is useful for troubleshooting broken pages.\n\nhttps://www.ghacks.net/2015/07/01/ublock-origins-logger-highlights-the-extensions-activity/\n\nuBO also allows you to export your settings, so they can be imported in another install. For instance you could share your settings, and some others could test if they see the same issues on pages (if you actually share what pages you have problems with, not just the domain).\n\nIt's also important to note that when using adblockers, you will experience broken pages from time to time. It's up to you to be able to troubleshoot these issues. uBO is an advanced extension, and it's easy to set things up so that a lot of sites will break. uBO needs time to learn how to use and understand it properly.\n\nI just tried what was suggested in the link I send - which is disabling hardware acceleration. Which worked... But I expected that turning it on again will get me back to blank wikipedia... but it didn't. So turning HA off an on fixed the issue for me.\n\nEdit: After reading the first post again.. maybe it was fixed just by the restarting of browser. I didn't know that restarting browser might fixed the issue. So I will keep an eye to it and report back if it gets broken again. And if it happens again, I will try the cookies deletion.\n\n@Pesala\n\nHello, Pesala!\n\nThis is more Fyi than anything else...\n\nI tried turning off all extensions;\n\nDeleting Wikipedia cookies;\n\nTurning off Hardware Acceleration\n\nBUT, if i type in the address bar 'Wikipedia.org', it (sort of) works*. I just can't click on a link of Wiki from a website, say to look at a movie, etc.; it gives an error if I do that. And.... same in Chrome.\n\n*Sort of works: The main Wikipage loads fine; but it won't allow me to search for anything. It says:\n\n\"This site canâ€™t be reached\n\nen.wikipedia.org refused to connect.\"\n\nIt would appear Chromium is at odds with Wikipedia(?)."
