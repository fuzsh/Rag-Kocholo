        "text": "1998 single by Pras Michel featuring The Product G&B\n\n\"Blue Angels\" is a hip-hop song by Pras Michel, released as the third single from his debut solo studio album, Ghetto Supastar. The track features vocals from American group The Product G&B. The single was released on September 28, 1998, as a last minute replacement for What'cha Wanna Do, which was removed from shelves just days before its release. The track samples the theme song \"Grease\" by Frankie Valli. \"Blue Angels\" was a commercial success in the United Kingdom, where it reached the top ten.\n\nThe accompanying music video (directed by Antoine Fuqua) features Pras on a submarine that is about to crash. His mission to save the crew members is thwarted when the ship implodes, causing everyone but Pras to die, as he manages to escape by jumping over the side of the ship.[1]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nUK CD1[2]\n\n\"Blue Angels\" (4:18)\n\n\"Blue Angels\" (K Gee Remix) (5:57)\n\n\"Blue Angels\" (Seani B Remix) (6:13)\n\nUK CD2[3]\n\n\"Blue Angels\" (4:18)\n\n\"Ghetto Supastar\" (The Black Apple Remix) (5:03)\n\n\"Murder Dem\" (3:52)\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nWeekly charts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart (1998) Peak\n\nposition Australia (ARIA)[4] 55 Belgium (Ultratip Bubbling Under Flanders)[5] 9 Germany (Official German Charts)[6] 75 Ireland (IRMA)[7] 27 Netherlands (Dutch Top 40 Tipparade)[8] 10 Netherlands (Single Top 100)[9] 92 New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ)[10] 10 Scotland (OCC)[11] 19 Sweden (Sverigetopplistan)[12] 10 Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade)[13] 50 UK Singles (OCC)[14] 6 UK Hip Hop/R&B (OCC)[15] 1\n\nYear-end charts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart (1998) Position Sweden (Sverigetopplistan)[16] 69"
