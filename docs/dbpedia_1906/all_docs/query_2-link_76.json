        "text": "Ice cream flavor from the American Midwest\n\nBlue moonTypeIce creamRegion or stateUpper Midwest, United States\n\nBlue moon is an ice cream flavor with bright blue coloring, available in the Upper Midwest of the United States. Multiple cities in the region claim to be the originator, with the popular theories including Plainwell, Michigan; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Ludington, Michigan.[1][2] The Chicago Tribune has described the ice cream as \"Smurf-blue, marshmallow-sweet\". Blue moon ice cream is one of the flavors that make up Superman ice cream in certain states.[1][3]\n\nBlue moon is found mainly in the Midwestâ€”Wisconsin and Michigan in particular.[4] It is found less frequently in other U.S. states, though it has been sold as far south as Washington, D.C [citation needed]. Kilwins also provides this flavor in various states. It is a common flavor in ice cream shops in Arvada, Colorado.\n\nCharacteristics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe varieties of blue moon vary in both color and flavor. Many aficionados of each variety of blue moon claim that their variety is the \"real one\", the \"original\", etc.[1][3][5]\n\nSome dairies that make blue moon keep their ingredients a secret, adding to the mystique.[3] Varieties that have distinct berry or vanilla flavor notes are sometimes theorized to have been originally flavored with castoreum.[3]\n\nSimilar international flavors\n\n[edit]\n\nA similar flavor has been sold in both Italy and Malta under the name puffo, which is Italian for 'Smurf', as well as in Germany under the names Schlumpf and Engelblau, which translate to 'Smurf' and 'angel blue', respectively.[6]\n\nIn France, it is called schtroumpf and in Spain pitufo [7](both meaning 'Smurf').\n\nIn Slovenia is modro nebo ('blue sky'), and in Argentina as crema del cielo ('sky cream').[citation needed]\n\nIn Poland, this variety of ice cream is called smerfowe ('Smurf-like') and is usually bubble-gum flavored.[citation needed]"
