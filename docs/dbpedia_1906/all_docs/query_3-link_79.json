        "text": "American blues harmonica player (born 1949)\n\nMusical artist\n\nJames Joshua Whiting (born December 16, 1949),[1] known professionally as Sugar Blue, is an American blues harmonica player.[2] He is best known for playing on the 1978 Rolling Stones album Some Girls, and well as his partnership with blues guitarist Louisiana Red.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune said, \"The sound of Sugar Blue's harmonica could pierce any night...it's the sound of a musician who transcends the supposed limitations of his instrument.\"[3]\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nWhiting was born in New York City in 1949.[1] In the mid-1970s, Whiting played as a session musician on Johnny Shines's Too Wet to Plow (1975) and with Roosevelt Sykes. While in the company of the latter, he met Louisiana Red, and the two toured and recorded in 1978.[4]\n\nTaking advice from Memphis Slim, in the late 1970s Whiting traveled to Paris, France. According to Ronnie Wood, Whiting was found by Mick Jagger busking on the city streets.[5] This led to him playing on several of the tracks on The Rolling Stones' Some Girls and Emotional Rescue albums: \"Some Girls\", \"Send It to Me\", \"Down in the Hole\" and \"Miss You\".\n\nTrombonist Mike Zwerin backed Whiting on his solo debut album, Crossroads (1979). Following the release of his From Chicago to Paris (1982), Whiting joined Willie Dixon's Chicago Blues All Stars.[4] In 1984, Whiting's track \"Another Man Done Gone\", appeared on the compilation album Blues Explosion. It won a Grammy in 1985 for Best Traditional Blues Album.[6]\n\nWhiting appeared with Brownie McGhee in the film Angel Heart (1987).\n\nWhiting joined as a side musician recording with Willie Dixon on the Grammy Award winning album, Hidden Charms (1988).[7]\n\nHis next album, Blue Blazes, was released in 1994 and it included his version of \"Miss You\".[4] It was followed by In Your Eyes (1995) and Code Blue (2007).[8]\n\nHe played on the album Down Too Long, by Southside Denny and the Skintones, in 1988.[9] Whiting's next album, Threshold, was released by Beeble Music on January 26, 2010.[10]\n\nWriting in the Chicago Tribune, music critic Howard Reich said, \"There's no mistaking Sugar Blue incendiary virtuosity. The speed and ferocity of his playing are matched by its inventiveness, with Blue packing nearly every phrase with trills, glissandos, clusters and chords. At times, it sounds as if two harps were working at once... intense, melodically ornate, punctuated by growls and swooping pitches, it's the sound of a musician who transcends the limitations of his instrument.\"[3]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Label Number Notes 1978 Red, Funk and Blue Black Panther BP-1001 Duo with Louisiana Red 1979 King Bee JSP 1006 Duo with Louisiana Red 1980 Crossroads Blue Silver BS-3004 France; recorded 1979 1982 From Chicago to Paris Blue Silver BS-3012, BS-3332 France; recorded 1980 with Slim Pezin, Earl Howell 1984 High Voltage Blues JSP 1081 with Louisiana Red 1988 Hidden Charms Capitol 90595 As sideman with Willie Dixon 1993 Absolutely Blue Seven Seas/King KICP-341 Japan, recorded 1982 1994 Blue Blazes Alligator AL-4819 Reissue of Absolutely Blue 1995 In Your Eyes Seven Seas/King; Alligator KICP-426; AL-4831 2006 Right Now Kozel Switzerland; George Kay Band featuring Sugar Blue 2007 Code Blue Beeble 801 2010 Threshold Beeble 802 2012 Raw Sugar - Live Beeble 803 2016 Blue Voyage M.C.
