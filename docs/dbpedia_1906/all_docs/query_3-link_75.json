        "text": "Dutch rock band\n\nFor the 2010 Dutch film, see Shocking Blue (film).\n\nShocking Blue was a Dutch rock band formed in The Hague in 1967. They were part of the Nederbeat movement in the Netherlands. The band had a string of hit songs during the counterculture movement of the 1960s and early 1970s, including \"Send Me a Postcard\" and \"Venus\", which became their biggest hit and reached number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and many other countries during 1969 and 1970. The band sold 13 million records by 1973 but disbanded in 1974.[2] Together with Golden Earring, they are considered the most successful Nederbeat band, because they had their best hits charted abroad and especially in the United States.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nOriginal era\n\n[edit]\n\nShocking Blue was founded in 1967 by the Motions guitarist Robbie van Leeuwen. Other members of the group at this time were Fred de Wilde, Klaasje van der Wal (1 February 1949 – 12 February 2018)[3] and Cor van der Beek (9 June 1949 – 2 April 1998). They had a minor hit in 1968 with \"Lucy Brown is Back in Town\". When De Wilde was the band's lead singer, the band originally had a sound that was described as cross between the Beatles and Brothers Four.\n\nDe Wilde left in 1968 after joining the Dutch army, and van Leeuwen was introduced to Mariska Veres, singing at that time with a club band. He persuaded her to take over the vocals, and the group recorded a worldwide hit with the song \"Venus\", which entered the Veronica top 40 hit parade at position No.12 the 12 July 1969 and peaked at number three on 26 July 1969 in the Netherlands. The song was released in the United States and the United Kingdom at the end of the year and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1970. It subsequently sold 350,000 copies in Germany and topped the U.S. chart for three weeks, the first song from the Netherlands to do so. It sold over one million copies there by January 1970 and received a gold record awarded by the Recording Industry Association of America. Global sales exceeded five million copies.[2] Other hits include \"Send Me a Postcard\" in late 1968 and \"Long and Lonesome Road\" (often mistakenly named as \"Long Lonesome Road\") in 1969.[4]\n\n\"Venus\" was followed by \"Mighty Joe\" (flip-side \"Wild Wind\") in 1969 and \"Never Marry a Railroad Man\" (flip-side \"Roll Engine Roll\") in 1970, both of which sold over a million records. The latter became a top-ten hit in several countries around the world.[2][5] Later songs were successful in Europe, Latin America, and Asia, including \"Hello Darkness\", \"Demon Lover\" (1970), \"Shocking You\", \"Blossom Lady\" and \"Out of Sight, Out of Mind\" (1971), \"Inkpot\", \"Rock in the Sea\" and \"Eve and the Apple\" (1972) and \"Oh Lord\" (1973), but they failed to make the charts in the U.S. or U.K.\n\nKlaasje van der Wal left towards the end of 1971, following their first trip to Japan (which spawned a live album). In 1974, Robbie Van Leeuwen quit, and Mariska Veres left later that year, leading to the band's split. Veres went on to pursue a solo career until 1982.\n\nReunions\n\n[edit]\n\nShocking Blue reformed with its most famous line-up in 1979 and recorded \"Louise\" as their first single since their break-up in 1974. The song was never released. They did, however, perform live in 1980 with earlier songs such as \"Venus\" and \"Never Marry a Railroad Man\".\n\nThe band attempted another comeback in 1984 and released a new single \"The Jury and the Judge\" with \"I Am Hanging on to Love\" as the B-side in 1986.\n\nIn 1994 the single \"Body and Soul\" was released.\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nDrummer Cor van der Beek died on 2 April 1998 at age 49 in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Mariska Veres died of gallbladder cancer on 2 December 2006 at age 59 in The Hague, Netherlands.[6][7] Bassist Klaasje van der Wal died on 12 February 2018 at age 69.[3]\n\nBananarama covered \"Venus\" in 1986, hitting number 1 in the United States, Canada, and Australia, and reaching number 8 in the UK.\n\nMembers\n\n[edit]\n\nFormer members\n\nRobbie van Leeuwen (guitar, sitar and backing vocals, 1967–1973)\n\nFred de Wilde (vocals, 1967–1968)\n\nKlaasje van der Wal (bass guitar, 1967–1971; died 2018)[8]\n\nCor van der Beek (drums, 1967–1974; died 1998)\n\nMariska Veres (vocals, 1968–1974; died 2006)\n\nLeo van de Ketterij (guitar, 1970–1971; died 2021)\n\nMartin van Wijk (guitar, 1973–1974)\n\nHenk Smitskamp (bass guitar, 1972–1974)\n\nWim Voermans (bass guitar, 1984-1986)\n\nJan Pijnenburg [nl] (drums, 1985-1986)\n\nMichael Eschauzier (keyboards, 1993-2006)\n\nAndré van Geldorp [nl] (guitar, vocals, 1987-2006)\n\nCharles Pesch\n\nGerben de Bruijn (drums, 1993-1998)\n\nMichel Schreuder (drums, vocals, 1998-2006)\n\nTimeline\n\n[edit]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nShocking Blue (also known as Beat with Us, German version) (1967)\n\nAt Home (also known as The Shocking Blue, 1970 American version) (1969)\n\nScorpio's Dance (also known as Sally Was a Good Old Girl, Japanese title) (1970)\n\nThird Album (also known as Shocking You) (1971)\n\nInkpot (1972)\n\nAttila (also known as Rock in the Sea, Japanese title, and Eve and the Apple) (1972)\n\nHam (1973)\n\nDream on Dreamer (1974)\n\nGood Times (1974)\n\nLive albums\n\n[edit]\n\nLive in Japan (Recorded on July 28 and 30, 1971, at Tokyo Kōsei Nenkin Kaikan) (1971)[9]\n\nCompilation albums\n\n[edit]\n\nCharted or certified compilation albums\n\nTitle Album details Peak chart positions NED\n\n[10] The Golden Years of Dutch Pop Music\n\nReleased: 2015\n\nLabel: Universal\n\n39\n\nOther compilation albums\n\n1969 Sensational Shocking Blue (Discofoon)\n\n1970 Shocking Blue (Pink Elephant)\n\n1971 Hello Darkness (Pink Elephant)\n\n1972 The Shocking Blue, Perfect Collection (Polydor)\n\n1972 The Best of Shocking Blue (Pink Elephant)\n\n1973 Shocking Blue's Best (Metronome)\n\n1973 With Love from...
