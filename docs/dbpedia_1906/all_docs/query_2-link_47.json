It was the first Strawbs album in 12 years to contain new material and featured several different line-ups of musicians from past Strawbs eras. Welsh folk-singer Mary Hopkin featured on many tracks, continuing a working partnership established by Dave Cousins and Brian Willoughby on their album The Bridge, from which several of the tracks on this album are drawn.\n\nThe track \"Blue Angel\" is a rearrangement of the track which appears on Dave Cousins' first solo album Two Weeks Last Summer. \"Lay Down\" is a re-recorded version of the hit single from Bursting at the Seams. \"Sealed With a Traitor's Kiss\" is a rearrangement of a track which appears on 1978 studio album Deadlines. The bonus track is the original 1979 version - also released as a single - of a track which later appeared on the 1991 studio album Ringing Down the Years.\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nJimmy James in an AllMusic review feels that the album returns to the band's Seventies music style, particularly in its \"combination of folk-rock and progressive rock melodies and arrangements\".[1]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Blue Angel\" (Dave Cousins) – 11:13\n\n\"Divided\"\n\n\"Half Worlds Apart\"\n\n\"At Rest\"\n\n\"Oh So Sleepy\" (Cousins) – 3:44\n\n\"Further Down the Road\" (Cousins) – 3:25\n\n\"There Will Come the Day\" (Cousins, Don Airey) – 6:05\n\n\"Strange Day Over the Hill\" (Cousins) – 3:56\n\n\"Cry No More\" (Cousins, Brian Willoughby) – 3:18\n\n\"The Plain\" (Cousins) – 5:48\n\n\"Do You Remember\" (Cousins, Willoughby) – 3:12\n\n\"Rhythm of the Night\" (Cousins) – 3:19\n\n\"Morning Glory\" (Cousins) – 4:52\n\n\"Sealed With a Traitor's Kiss\" (Cousins) – 2:57\n\n\"Lay Down\" (Cousins) – 4:09\n\nBonus track\n\n\"The King\" (Cousins) – 2:38\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nDave Cousins – lead vocals, backing vocals, acoustic guitar, piano (11)\n\nBrian Willoughby – electric guitar\n\nDave Lambert – electric guitar (2,9), vocals (2,9)\n\nBlue Weaver – keyboards (except 11 and 13), programming (4), orchestration (10)\n\nAndy Richards – keyboards (\"The King\")\n\nRod Demick – backing vocals (1,4,5,12), bass guitar (1,4,5,12), harmonica (5)\n\nChas Cronk – bass guitar (2,3,6,8,9,10,\"The King\"), backing vocals (4,9,\"The King\"), bass pedals (7), programming (7,8)\n\nRichard Hudson – backing vocals (1,4,5,12), drums (1,5,12)\n\nRod Coombes – drums (2,9)\n\nTony Fernandez – drums (3,10,\"The King\"), tom-toms (7)\n\nAdditional personnel\n\nMary Hopkin – vocals (1,3,4,6,8,10,12)\n\nCathryn Craig – vocals (4)\n\nTerry Cassidy – vocals (4)\n\nJana Heller – vocals (9)\n\nRoy Hill – vocals (9)\n\nTommy Lundy – vocals (9)\n\nMaddy Prior – vocals (\"The King\")\n\nRick Kemp – vocals (\"The King\")\n\nRecording\n\n[edit]\n\nDave Cousins, Brian Willoughby, Chas Cronk – producers\n\nMixed by Dave Cousins and Kenny Denton at KD's Studio, Chiswick, London, October 2002[2]\n\nRelease history\n\n[edit]\n\nRegion Date Label Format Catalog United Kingdom 2003 ( ) Witchwood CD WMCD2008\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
