Start making some real changes. 🔅Stop aiming for perfection (that goes for yours truly); there's no such thing. 🔅Stop ignoring your own needs.

Having not been there for 6 years, there was a lot to catch up on. It was an intense 10 day trip where I tried to fit everything in, from sorting out phone to bank affairs, paying homage at ancestor shrines and temples to catching up with relatives. It was non-stop from dawn to dusk. When I got back to the UK, I started getting a little tickly cough. It was one of those coughs that I just couldn’t seem to clear. It just kept tickling away no matter what I tried. It started getting worse to the point where the tickle was making me gag, which made me nauseous, which made me even worse. It was pretty awful. My days morphed into a pattern of sleep, eat, and repeat, forcing me to retreat from the world and all my commitments. Life was pretty miserable and I can see how people can get into a rut. I’m normally an optimistic person but all I was feeling was doom and gloom. In the end, it took a batch of antibiotics to clear things up. It didn’t quite last 100 days but they say that’s the average for this type of cough. ** By cancelling everything… ** And when I started to feel a bit better, I suddenly felt space and a bit of a vacuum. I didn’t know what to do with myself. Normally, my life is pretty full and it felt strange not knowing what to do next. This lasted a couple of days and involved conflicting emotions; guilt for not doing anything, mingled with fatigue and a foggy attention span, surrounded by a sense of apathy. As my health returned slowly, I found myself regaining a zest for life. I started doing simple things like making a simple Instagram chocolate fudge recipe, I ordered some photos I’ve been meaning to, I started clearing up the lounge. Small small things but somehow very satisfying. Remember how many of us felt like the Covid lockdowns provided a bit of a reset? How we cancelled everything in our lives and only reintroduced things that were important to us. This nasty cough felt like that. It’s provided a bit of a reset. It also reminded me that our health is so important, so without going through such an ordeal, look at your calendar and think what you really want there. Is this how you want to be spending your time? If anything prompts hesitation or a definite “No”, consider this moment for change. * What’s important and essential for you? * And are you doing it? If you don't know, book a complimentary call with me to discuss. https://lnkd.in/efPUsqRq\n\nI heard a quote this week. Happiness is when your life lines up with how you want it to go. On the flip of that, stress is the difference between what you want and what you have. This helped me reframe a lot this week and when I go through what we have been doing, know that these are the highlights this week... Yesterday was “Blue Monday” in the UK. The most depressing day of the year! However, that mindset needs to change. It was bright until nearly 5, and there is so much to look forward to so let's bash into this. Here is update 2 on what we have been doing as a comapny! As I said last week, not every week is a flashy week but there are some things I want to keep sharing. In this last week, we did the following: - We successfully onboarded a new partner, and we are already seeing results. However, we have now amended our onboarding to allow for a longer time for research. Not sexy but something that we see as the next step in that evolution. - We Booked flights for a networking event in London in Feb. This is something I promised myself we would do more of so here we are! “Hi my name is Tris”. - We put the finishing touches on the Vision for Webtopia and will be presenting it in our all hands this week! - We had our online team social. - Emily Hatton Booked our trip for ATHENS for our company away week! Some say it will be referred to in folklore as “Greek week” - Ben Dyer Closed deals on two new partners for Webtopia this week. - We welcomed back Lejla D. from maternity leave 👏 - I met two other agency founders CEO summit with two other agencies coming to Dublin this week! It's massively important to get perspective, and this helped to understand where we can take things to the next level. So many things are happening right now and I will keep sharing them with you as they do! What I am not mentioning are all the really great bits of feedback the team is getting on their approach to Partner's problems! We take a lot more wholistic approach and this is starting to show! To next week! We are starting recording our weekly Andrew Foxwell podcast and some even more learning! Pictured is our hotel for our stay in Greece! 🇬🇷\n\nIf you're not getting anxiety relief, I would start doing these things...🚶♂️✨ 🍽 When you eat, just enjoy your meal. 🛌 When you rest, really rest. Life's too short to worry about what everyone else is doing. Focus on you! 🌟 Stop stressing about the little things. Like, why is the line so long? Or why do things happen the way they do? That's not your circus, not your monkeys. 🎪🐒 Talk to those who matter - your healthcare provider, your support system. Make choices that feel right to you. You've got this! 💪 And remember, taking time for yourself doesn't have to be complicated. A few deep breaths in the morning or a quick journal session at night can make all the difference. 📖💖 Feeling ready for more tips on keeping calm and enjoying your journey?

For me great tips for keeping #wellbeing and #mentalhealth in good shape, you think so too? You start dying slowly: If you do not travel, If you do not read, If you do not listen to the sounds of life, If you do not appreciate yourself. You start dying slowly: When you kill your self-esteem, When you do not let others help you. You start dying slowly: If you become a slave of your habits, Walking every day on the same paths, If you do not change your routine, If you do not wear different colours, If you do not speak to those you don’t know. You start dying slowly: If you avoid feeling passion, and their turbulent emotions, those which make your eyes glisten and your heartbeat fast. You start dying slowly: If you do not risk what is safe for the uncertain, If you do not go after a dream, If you do not allow yourself, at least once in your lifetime, to run away from sensible advice. Don't let yourself die slowly! Do not forget to be happy!"
