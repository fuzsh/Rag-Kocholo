Originally scheduled for 5 June 2020, the album's release was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The album was preceded by three singles: \"Worry About Me\", \"Power\" and \"Slow Grenade\", and features guest vocals from Blackbear, Diplo, Juice WRLD, Lauv, serpentwithfeet and Swae Lee. It is Goulding's first album since Delirium (2015). Brightest Blue received generally positive reviews from music critics. The album was also a commercial success. It became Goulding's third album to peak at number one on the UK Albums Chart and fourth album to debut inside the top three on the chart. The album also peaked inside the top ten in several other countries. To promote the album, Goulding was set to embark on the Brightest Blue Tour on 28 April 2021, but it was pushed back to 5 October 2021 due to COVID-19 restrictions in the United Kingdom.[5]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2017, Goulding announced that work on new music had begun.[6] In April of the same year, producer BloodPop revealed on social media he was in the studio with Goulding.[7] That same month, Goulding released a collaboration with Kygo entitled \"First Time\".[8] On 24 October 2018, she released \"Close to Me\" with Diplo and Swae Lee.[9] She told The Guardian in early 2019, \"It's very much written by me.\" She further discussed three new songs: \"Flux\", \"Love I'm Given\" and \"Electricity\".[10] \"Flux\" was released on 1 March of the same year.[11]\n\nIn July 2019, Goulding stated that her next material to be released would be the songs \"Woman I Am\" and \"Start\".[12] In November, she released her rendition of Joni Mitchell's Christmas song \"River\", which topped the UK Singles Chart, becoming her third UK number-one single and the last UK number one song of the 2010s.[13] In a March 2020 interview with Heart, Goulding revealed that the album \"kind of comes in two parts,\" adding that she plays the guitar, bass and piano on the project.[14] During an appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden, she described the album as having two sides, revealing that the first side will features songs written entirely by her, while the second is described as being \"like an alter ego\" and contains the majority of singles released from 2018 to 2020.[15]\n\nRelease and promotion\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 27 May 2020, Goulding announced Brightest Blue as the album's title, alongside its cover artwork, release dates and formats, and track listing. The album's pre-order was made alongside the announcement.[16] The first side, Brightest Blue, features 13 total tracks, while the second EG.0, features the previously-released \"Close to Me\", \"Hate Me\" and \"Worry About Me\", as well as two new tracks.[17] Originally scheduled for release on 5 June 2020,[citation needed] it was later delayed to 12 June, and later to 17 July of the same year.[18] On 13 July of the same year, she released a trailer for the album on YouTube.[19] In support of the album, Goulding embarked on the Brightest Blue Tour, which began on the 28 April 2021.[20]\n\nFor the album's physical release, Goulding and her team opted to have copies manufactured with as many environmentally-friendly materials as possible. According to Goulding's official digital store, a regular single-disc CD is packaged in a Digisleeve manufactured with FSC-certified recycled cardboard and is sealed in a \"plant-based\" wrap.[21] Variations of formats such as cassette tapes and vinyl records have also been manufactured with minimised or recycled plastic materials and packaging. Goulding added \"[...] great progress has been made on this and I'm pleased we've been able to push the industry forwards, but we are still pushing to do more.\"[22]\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 13 March 2020, Goulding released \"Worry About Me\", a collaboration with Blackbear, as the first single from the album.[23][24] The accompanying music video, directed by Emil Nava, was released the same day.[25] Upon the song's release, it received generally positive reviews from music critics.[26][27] Commercially, the song debuted at number 78 on the UK Singles Chart.[28] On 21 May 2020, \"Power\" was released as the album's second single.[29][30] The accompanying music video was directed by Imogen Snell and Riccardo Castano, and was released later the same day.[31] It peaked at number 86 in the UK.[32] The Lauv-assisted \"Slow Grenade\" was released as the third single on 30 June 2020.[33][34] \"Love I'm Given\" was released as the album's fourth single on 19 August 2020, along with a music video.[35]\n\nBrightest Blue Tour\n\n[edit]\n\nBrightest BlueTour by Ellie GouldingLocationUnited KingdomAssociated albumBrightest BlueStart date7 October 2021 ( )End date17 October 2021 (2021-10-17)Legs1No. of shows6Ellie Goulding concert chronology\n\nDelirium World Tour\n\n(2016)\n\nBrightest Blue Tour\n\n(2021)\n\nHigher Than Heaven Tour\n\n(2023)\n\nSet list\n\n[edit]\n\nThis set list is representative of the concert in Glasgow on October 7, 2021.[36] It does not represent all concerts for the tour.\n\n\"Start\"\n\n\"Power\"\n\n\"How Deep Is Too Deep\"\n\n\"Powerful\"\n\n\"Aftertaste\"\n\n\"New Heights\"\n\n\"Bleach\"\n\n\"New Love\"\n\n\"Flux\"\n\n\"Only You\"\n\n\"Worry About Me\"\n\n\"I Need Your Love\"\n\n\"Close To Me\"\n\n\"Love I'm Given\"\n\n\"Woman\"\n\n\"Love Me Like You Do\"\n\n\"Tides\"\n\n\"Brightest Blue\"\n\n\"Holding On For Life\"\n\n\"Anything Could Happen\"\n\nEncore\n\n\"Lights\"\n\n\"Burn\"\n\nNotes\n\nDuring the show in London, Goulding performed \"Hate Me\", and \"Tides\" was performed before \"Love Me Like You Do\".[37]\n\nList of concerts, showing date, city, country and venue Dates City Country Venue Support Act October 7, 2021 Glasgow Scotland O2 Academy L Devine October 9, 2021 Newcastle England O2 Academy October 11, 2021 Manchester O2 Apollo October 13, 2021 Birmingham O2 Academy October 15, 2021 Bournemouth O2 Academy October 17, 2021 London Eventim Apollo\n\nCancelled Dates\n\nDates City Country Venue Reason for Cancellation October 5, 2021 Dublin Ireland Olympia Theatre Unforeseen circumstances\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nProfessional ratingsAggregate scoresSourceRatingAnyDecentMusic?6.7/10[41]Metacritic74/100[42]Review scoresSourceRatingAllMusic[43]musicOMH[44]Pitchfork6.4/10[45]Evening Standard[38]The Arts Desk[47]The Independent[48]The Telegraph[49]Slant Magazine[46]The Line of Best Fit[39]Exclaim![40]\n\nBrightest Blue received generally favourable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from professional critics, the album received a weighted average score of 74, based on ten reviews.[42] Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave the album a 6.7 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.[41]\n\nReviewing the album for AllMusic, Neil Z. Yeung called the album, \"a powerful reclamation of self that recaptures the simplicity of her debut and the vulnerability of Halcyon\", as well as a statement that \"has growth and maturity at its core\".[43] Rachel MacGrath for Evening Standard also praised Goulding's maturity as an artist, stating that her \"signature attributes are present and correct on her first album in five years. But this time around, thereâ€™s a confidence in her vocals and songwriting that wasnâ€™t always there before.\"[50] Dave Beech for The Line of Best Fit appreciated the record honesty, finding it to be Goulding's \"most heartfelt\" body of work. Particularly, complementing the standard tracks for being the \"most rounded\", as well the \"most accomplished\" side. [51]\n\nSeveral critics were divided with the inclusion of the B-Side, EG.0, with some stating that the inclusion was unnecessary. Damien Morris on his review for The Guardian, said that Goulding needs to be more confident with herself, stating that: \"she might need more ego, but she doesnâ€™t need EG.0.\"[52] Dave Beech for The Line of Best Fit added to his positive review that Brightest Blue is another proof that Goulding is at her best when she refuses the urge of making chart-topping collaborations, in favour of the \"idiosyncratic pop on which she first made her name.\"[51] In contrast, Katie Tymochenko for Exclaim! was more receptive with the double-side album, as she felt that it allows the singer to grow artistically while at the same time keeping her \"pop throne as pop royalty.\"[53]\n\nAssociated Press included Brightest Blue on their Best Albums of 2020 year-end list.\n\nSelect year-end rankings of Brightest Blue Critic/Publication List Rank Ref.
