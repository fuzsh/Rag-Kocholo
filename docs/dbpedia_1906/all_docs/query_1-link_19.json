        "text": "Pittsburgh Post Gazette\n\n\"WOW! Angel's vocals are a knock out. This was one act you did not want to miss. She worked the crowd wonderfully with her sultry vocals. With the dueling axes and bluesy belting......got to see her. She has a mixture of Janis Joplin, Maria Muldaur, and Stevie Nicks.\"\n\nVal Scott- Dusty Blues\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2011/2012 WINNER OF PITTSBURGHS BEST BLUES BASED BAND BY\n\nIRON CITY ROCKS\n\n2012 WINNER OF IRON CITY ROCKS BEST FEMALE VOCALIST!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBEST BAND TO WALK THRU THIS DOOR IN 10 YEARS\n\nItalian Club, Avonmore PA 2014\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExpressionist Magazine\n\nI don't normally do this with reviews, I usually do the entire album or just a song; but on this CD they have a song that I just absolutely fell in love with and want to explain why----Jason Dowd\n\nAngel Blue Bands album \"Bottom Of The Bottle Blues\" is a great album. I love it. The album is filled with Angels smooth, powerful yet sultry voice that is so enticing. Its filled with those great blues sounds similar to the ones that started right out of the deep southern state of Louisiana years ago; while bringing an upbeat get on the floor and dance tone to her songs. Throughout the CD I heard many sounds from Country, Jazz, Blues, Pop and even the good ole Rock N Roll. For me the album covers every aspect of music I like, and its something I feel everyone can listen to and enjoy. I would certainly recommend this album to anyone.\n\nAngel makes this album special with her many ranges and sounds to her vocals. She can incorporate a female version of a Jerry Lee Lewis, to a Stevie Ray Vaughn style. Then she can even go to the very hard voice of Janis Joplin that is legendary throughout the country which truly shows her vocal talents. I am not saying she sounds exactly like them, she has her own unique sound and style similar to these outstanding greats, which gives the album a great mixture of the sound.\n\nI don't normally do this with reviews, I usually do the entire album or just a song; but on this CD they have a song that I just absolutely fell in love with and want to explain why. That song is called \"Shimmy Shaken Low Down Blues.\"\n\nThis song has a piano player that can give Jerry Lee Lewis a run for his money. It almost reminds of the great rock song he made famous in the 1950s like: \"Great Balls of Fire.\" If you love Jerry Lee Lewis and the fast pace, great voice, great guitar with piano mix you are sure to love this song. Angel blasts the vocals like a master with great confidence and you can tell she is totally into the song from start to finish! \"Shimmy Shaken Low Down Blues\" will make you dance while sending you back in time to the innocent music that we can all love. Extremely well done!!!! My favorite song of theirs by far. I am a Jerry Lee Lewis fan and it was great to hear someone bring his style of music back to life again!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNorth Hills Tribune Review\n\nChris Greer\n\n[Angel Blue] leader of this blues band, and she's ready to take the area by storm.\n\nThe band has been around for five years, but now they're making their biggest splash yet.\n\nOn Friday, Dec. 2, Angel Blue will headline a show, celebrating the release of their new CD \"Bottom of the Bottle Blues\" at the Hard Rock Cafe in Station Square.\n\nIn a typical show, Angel Blue and the Prophets recall echoes of blues legends such as BB King, Eric Clapton and Jimmy Hendrix.\n\nThe Prophets aim to please with both original tunes and a selection of as many as 125 cover favorites.\n\nThe songs they play at their concerts span musical genres including rock, blues and funk and feature offerings from across the great musical eras, including the 'classic' years and more modern styles.\n\nAlong with Angel on the mic, the rock solid rhythm section includes Scott McLean on drums and Jonathan Smith on bass.\n\nJoe Maryanski mans the sax, and there's a duel guitar attack of Dan Parks and Lee Hindman.\n\nAlthough the Prophets are influenced by many blues and rock 'gods,' for Angel, Janis Joplin is the ultimate idol.\n\nTo those who have seen her perform, Angel is often mentioned in the same breath as Joplin, capturing both her vocal style and stage presence.\n\n\"I'm so honored that people compare me to Janis,\" said Angel. \"At concerts, people will come up to me with tears in their eyes, hold my hand, and say: 'for a minute, I thought I was hearing Janis sing.'\"\n\nAngel and the band are quite easygoing in their performance style and will often try new things during a concert.\n\n\"We don't try to limit ourselves. We do classic and newer songs, all styles of rock, blues, and R&B,\" she said. The Prophets also pride themselves on being sensitive to what their audience wants.\n\n\"The songs that we'll play really depend on who's out for a show,\" explained Angel. \"But if it's good music, then we'll play it.\n\n\"Of course there's favorite ones that people really like. you see people dancing, those are the ones we pull out and play. It just depends. I just observe the audience.\"\n\nAngel described their music as having a heavy influence of blues, but with some funk and rock and roll thrown in. But the most important thing for her is maintaining their originality.\n\n\"I'm just being true to myself, I don't try to change myself, or our style,\" she said.\n\nAside from the local and Pittsburgh scene, the Angel Blue Band has played venues in West Virginia, Virginia, Ohio and drew impressive crowds during a mini-tour in North Carolina. Plans are already in the works for a slew of concert dates next year in Florida.\n\nFriday's CD Release party will introduce fans and new listeners alike to their first recording, entitled \"Bottom of the Bottle Blues.\"The CD includes 12 original songs penned jointly by Angel Blue and McLean.\n\nREVIEW\n\nBlues, Jazz and Folk Music Society of Ohio\n\n\"Bottom Of The Bottle Blues\" by Pittsburgh's AngelBlue. (www.angelblueband.com) is their first effort at recording. While talking with Angel Saturday evening, she told me not to be too hard on them. Well, I'm sure not! This a good effort especially for the first go-round. It has a rock/boogie blues sound with good solid vocals from Angel. During their competition performance, also thought Scott on drums was excellent, with lots of personality.\n\nFavorite tracs are\n\n#3-Bottom Of The Bottle Blues,\n\n#4 749\n\n#7 Short Chain\n\n#11 Guilty Baby\n\nAngel, has a great voice, that to my ear, is kinda reminiscent of Janis Joplin. She also said their CD release party at Hard Rock Cafe in Pittsburgh was great. Packed the place and for a time the Hard Rock Cafe was turned into a House Of Blues!\n\nAngel's blues\n\nJust a little while into my first conversation with Angel, I thought: Yeah, she sounds like she sings some mean blues.\n\nHers is that raspy type of voice that sounds like what I've heard of Janis Joplin in old video footage, minus Janis' Texas drawl.\n\nAnd that suits Angie fine. Not only is she really a blues singer, under her nom de guerre of Angel Blue, but she does a heck of a Janis impression, both in song and persona. We'll get to that a bit later.\n\nFor now, let's talk about her band, The Angel Blue Band. They're wrapping up work on a new album, \"Bottom of the Bottle Blues,\" and plan a CD release party on Dec. 2 at the Hard Rock Cafe at Station Square.\n\n\"What I like about the CD is that you don't hear too many people coming up with original blues,\" she says. But that's exactly what she's working on: her own compositions, lyrically, with some musical assistance from her band's drummer, Scott McLean. And seeing as how she's the voice here, \"These songs are coming from a woman's perspective.\"\n\nExcept, that is, for the title track, for which she drew inspiration from a scene one New year's morning ... you can picture it. Not only does the song \"Bottom of the Bottom Blues\" have a cool enough name to lend itself to the whole album, it will feature a pretty cool guest guitarist: Reb Beach, the Pittsburgh native of Winger, Dokken, etc. fame.\n\nThe album, in fact, is full of guest guitarists from Pittsburgh's rock/blues scene, including Buddy Hall, Frank Giovi, Randall Troy, Lee Cherry and Craig King. Her goal is to showcase some noteworthy axemen.\n\n\"There is fabulous talent here,\" she says. \"We probably have more talent here in this little city than in many of our surrounding states. I believe that firmly.\"\n\nThere's some talent in her working band, too, including a pair of guitarists who look to have a bright future, considering their head start on stage: Lee Hindman is 18 and Dan Parks is 17.\n\n\"Between the two of them, we have a real nice sound,\" Angel says, noting they drew their blues influence at young ages from Stevie Ray Vaughan; and in turn from his big influence, Jimi Hendrix; and in turn from Jimi's influences, people like \"Muddy, B.B. and Robert Johnson.\"\n\nThe other Prophets are Scott, who studied at the Berklee School of Music, has his own private studio and has recorded a solo CD, \"Rock and Roll Karma\"; and bass player Jonathan Smith, a longtime veteran of the regional musical scene. The sound is fleshed out by Joe Maryanski on saxophone and Jeff Conners on keyboards and harmonica.\n\nWhile they're finishing the CD, band members continue to play at venues around the area, showcasing their instrumental skills while backing an emotional, distinctive vocalist.\n\nSo, why does Angel Blue sing the blues?\n\n\"By happenstance,\" she says. See, Angel was in a wreck a number of years ago, and her injuries changed her from a soprano to sounding more like Janis. \"I thought, my voice is ruined.\"\n\nShe'd sung before, but stopped for a while, until an impromptu performance at a party. A gentleman within earshot sidled up to her and said, \"How would you like to help me out with a festival? I'm in a blues band.\"\n\nAs Angel tells it: \"I said, 'What's the blues?'\"\n\nThe guys in that band showed her, playing classics from T-Bone Walker, Muddy Waters and the like. So Angel learned some tunes and belted them out for the festival, a charity event benefitting an organization that helps children who've lost a parent.\n\nIronically, around the same time, her mother, the late Margaret D'Ambrosio, told her: \"If I die tomorrow, I want you to sing.\"\n\n\"She knew me better than myself,\" Angel calls.\n\nSo she followed her mother's wishes, forming her own band a few months later and starting to adapt some of her poetry to original blues lyrics. (Margaret also was a talented poet, and Angel is planning a recording featuring her mother's work.)\n\nThe band adopted the moniker of Angel Blue. \"People started to call me Angel Blue,\" Angel says. \"They said, 'You're going to be the next Barbara Blue,'\" a reference to the Memphis-based blues singer who happens to be another Pittsburgh native.\n\nLater down the road, she altered the name of the band slightly to become Angel Blue, and the result can be heard shortly on \"Bottom of the Bottle Blues.\"\n\nOh, more about her and Janis: Angel is putting together a show for April 7 called \"Cheap Thrills (Are You Experienced?),\" a dual tribute in which she'll be Miss Joplin and Craig King will be Mr. Hendrix. Plus, we might hear from Mr. Vaughan, too.\n\nSo, there are a couple of more dates to mark on your calendar: Dec. 2, 2005, and April 7, 2006. Or, if you want to hear a rousing performance before then, check out Angel Blue Band live.\n\nAnd hear a voice that's made to sing the blues (and Janis Joplin tunes).\n\nAngel's album\n\nWhen it comes to the blues, there's a lot more than first meets the ear.\n\nThe many variations on the genre's basic theme are amply demonstrated by Pittsburgh-area band Angel Blue and the Prophets on their new album, \"Bottom of the Bottle Blues.\"\n\nFrom the innovatively presented opening track - I won't give away the details - through a slide guitar-driven, Bo Diddley-beat closer, the disc steers clear of sounding anything close to repetitious. In some places, it makes you want to get up and dance; in others, it might prompt you to pour a shot (see title track). And for guitarists, this is a great play-along record, although you're bound to have trouble keeping up with the assembled instrumental talent.\n\nAbove all, this is Angel's show. Angel wasn't formally trained as a vocalist (or a songwriter, for that matter). But you wouldn't know it by listening to her voice - often gritty, occasionally sweet - carry a set of mostly original compositions, for which she wrote lyrics from a decidedly female point of view.\n\nOne of the highlights, for example, is \"Guilty Baby,\" where a single guitarist accompanies Angel through a fun, sexy monologue about her love for an unnamed, second-person gentleman. (Red-blooded male listeners just might come away hoping it's them.)\n\nAnd speaking of fun, there's \"Shimmy Shakin' Lowdown Blues,\" a song with a title that says it all - and one that gets a great response on the dance floor when Angel Blue and the Prophets play it live.\n\nContrasting the jubilant \"Shimmy\" is the minor-chord title song, on which Angie's voice navigates a range of a couple of octaves to effectively convey a sense of desperation. (This is the blues, after all.) Helping drive the tune are some emotionaly charged guitar passages by special guest Reb Beach, he of Winger, Whitesnake and other high-profile acts.\n\nThe album also features guest spots by a couple of other Pittsburgh area guitarists: Lee Cherry on \"Short Chain\" and Frank Giovi on \"Love You Any Less.\"\n\nThat's in addition to the guys who work with Angie regularly: Jonathan Smith on bass, Jeff Conners on keyboards, Joe Maryanski on sax and guitarists Dan Parks and E. Lee Hindman Jr.\n\nOh, and there's one more band member, Angel's longest-serving collaborator (\"I wouldn't have the band without him,\" Angel says): drummer Scott McLean, who also plays keyboards and bass on the album, as well as co-producing it and writing the music to Angie's lyrics. After hearing Scott's solo album, \"Rock and Roll Karma,\" I was expecting a great sound with the Angel Blue project. And I certainly wasn't disappointed.\n\n\"Bottom of the Bottle Blues\" covers a lot of territory in 50 minutes, including a renditions of Blind Willie McTell's \"Stormy Monday\" recorded three years ago by the original incarnation of the band, with Lou Macarelli and George Waller on guitars and Pete LaCava on bass, along with Scott. And the disc wraps up with probably my favorite track (I'm partial to the Bo Diddley Beat), \"Johnny McGaster,\" a triumphant song of liberation propelled by some exceptional slide playing, by Lee Hindman.\n\nAngel Blue and the Prophets is hosting a CD release party for \"Bottom of the Blues\" this Friday, Dec. 2, at the Hard Rock Cafe at Station Square, with the Craig King Band opening and the Sonic Blues Band closing. Check it out to see what the blues is all about."
