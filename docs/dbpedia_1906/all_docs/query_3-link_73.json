        "text": "American singer-songwriter (born 2002)\n\nStephen Christopher Sanchez (born November 3, 2002) is an American singer-songwriter. Based in Nashville, Sanchez released his debut extended play What Was, Not Now in October 2021. On September 1, 2021, Sanchez released the single \"Until I Found You\", which peaked at No. 23 on the Billboard Hot 100, No. 8 on the Australian ARIA Chart and No. 14 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was nominated for Billboard Music Awards and MTV Video Music Awards for Push Performance of the Year and Top Rock Song, respectively, in 2023. He has also received nominations for iHeartRadio Music Awards and People’s Choice Awards for New Artist of the Year.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 2020, Sanchez posted a cover of Cage the Elephant's \"Cigarette Daydreams\" on TikTok; he built an audience through a steady stream of content attracting over 122 thousand followers on TikTok.[2]\n\nAfter he shared a snippet of \"Lady by the Sea\", singer-songwriter Jeremy Zucker offered to produce the official version, which was released in July 2020; as a result Sanchez signed a deal with Republic Records. He worked with producer Ian Fitchuk on his debut EP What Was, Not Now, released in October 2021.[2] On November 4, 2022, he released a single with Ashe, titled \"Missing You\".[3] On January 25, 2023, he released a single titled \"Evangeline\" which preceded his headline tour.\n\nSanchez appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to promote the song and his headline tour. Sanchez performed his song \"Evangeline\" on the show. [4] On April 28, 2023, Sanchez released his next single, titled \"Only Girl\".\n\nOn June 25, 2023, Sanchez appeared on stage with Elton John playing \"Until I Found You\" at Glastonbury 2023.[5]\n\nSanchez's debut album Angel Face was released on September 22, 2023.[6] A deluxe version of the album, Angel Face (Club Deluxe) was announced to be released on April 26, 2024.[7]\n\nSanchez sung \"Baby Blue Bathing Suit\" for the soundtrack of the Disney+ documentary The Beach Boys.\n\nStyle\n\n[edit]\n\nSanchez's style is very reminiscent of music from the 1950s and 1960s, which is an era of music he has cited heavily influenced him from a young age.
