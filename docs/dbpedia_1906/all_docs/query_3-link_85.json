        "text": "American musician (born 1979)\n\nNorah Jones (born Geethali Norah Jones Shankar; March 30, 1979)[2] is an American singer-songwriter and pianist. She has won several awards for her music and, as of 2023, had sold more than 50 million records worldwide.[3] Billboard named her the top jazz artist of the 2000s decade. She has won nine Grammy Awards and was ranked 60th on Billboard magazine's artists of the 2000s decade chart.[4]\n\nIn 2002, Jones launched her solo music career with the release of Come Away with Me, which was a fusion of jazz with country, blues, folk and pop. It was certified diamond, selling over 27 million copies.[5] The record earned Jones five Grammy Awards, including the Album of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best New Artist, making her the first person of South Asian descent to win that many Grammy awards.[6] Her subsequent studio albums Feels Like Home (2004), Not Too Late (2007), and The Fall (2009), all gained platinum status, selling over a million copies each.[7] They were also generally well received by critics.[8] Jones made her feature film debut as an actress in My Blueberry Nights, which was released in 2007 and was directed by Wong Kar-Wai.\n\nJones is the daughter of Indian sitarist and composer Ravi Shankar, and is the half-sister of fellow Indian musicians Anoushka Shankar and Shubhendra Shankar.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nJones was born Geethali Norah Jones Shankar on March 30, 1979, in Manhattan, New York City, to American concert producer Sue Jones and Indian Bengali musician Ravi Shankar.[2][9]\n\nAfter her parents separated in 1986, Jones lived with her mother, growing up in Grapevine, Texas. As a child, Jones began singing in church and also took piano and voice lessons. She and her mom lived in Anchorage, Alaska when she was eleven years old.[10] She attended Grapevine Middle School and Grapevine High School before transferring to Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Dallas. Her music took its first form early on in the local Methodist Church where she regularly sang solos. While in high school, she sang in the school choir, participated in band, and played the alto saxophone. At the age of 16, with both parents' consent, she officially changed her name to Norah Jones.[2][11][12]\n\nJones always had an affinity for the music of Bill Evans and Billie Holiday, among other \"oldies\". She once said, \"My mom had this eight-album Billie Holiday set; I picked out one disc that I liked and played that over and over again\".[13]\n\nShe attended Interlochen Center for the Arts during the summers. While at high school, she won the Down Beat Student Music Awards for Best Jazz Vocalist (twice, in 1996 and 1997) and Best Original Composition (1996).[14]\n\nJones attended the University of North Texas (UNT), where she majored in jazz piano and sang with the UNT Jazz Singers. During this time, she had a chance meeting with future collaborator Jesse Harris. She gave a ride to a band playing at the university whose members happened to be friends of Harris. He was on a cross-country road trip with friend and future Little Willies member Richard Julian, and stopped to see the band play. After meeting Jones, Harris started sending her lead sheets of his songs.\n\nIn 1999, Jones left Texas for New York City. Less than a year later, she started a band with Harris, and her recordings with them were bestsellers.[15]\n\nMusical career\n\n[edit]\n\nJones was a lounge singer before becoming a recording artist.[16] Before releasing her first studio album, she performed with Wax Poetic, Peter Malick, and jazz guitarist Charlie Hunter.[17][18][19]\n\n2000–2001: New York City, First Sessions\n\n[edit]\n\nAs Peter Malick states in the liner notes, \"I started looking for a singer who might be open to recording [my latest songs] for me. On a Tuesday night, I walked into the Living Room just as the singer announced the last song of the set. The Dinah Washington classic 'Since I Fell for You' filled the room and I was struck breathless. Here, in the tradition of Billie Holiday, was a stunningly beautiful, blues infused voice. This was my first contact with Norah Jones.\"[20] Malick asked her to participate in sessions at Room 9 from Outer Space in South Boston, during August and September 2000. They recorded Malick's songs \"New York City\", \"Strange Transmissions\", \"Deceptively Yours\" and \"Things You Don't Have to Do\" in addition to cover versions of \"All Your Love\" by Sam Maghett and \"Heart of Mine\" by Bob Dylan. These songs became the album New York City (Koch, 2003) by the Peter Malick Group Featuring Norah Jones.[20]\n\nAfter moving to New York City, Jones signed to Blue Note, a label owned by EMI Group. The signing came as an indirect result of her performing as lead singer for the JC Hopkins Biggish Band. Shell White, who was the wife of J. C. Hopkins, worked for EMI Publishing and gave Jones's three-track demo to Bruce Lundvall, the label's president, and Brian Bacchus, its artists and repertoire agent (A&R). The demo contained two jazz standards and a song by Jesse Harris. The two executives agreed that Jones had potential. Despite their misgivings about the direction of her music, they signed her to the label. Bacchus told HitQuarters, \"We let her find her own direction ... We knew that if she could develop her songwriting and we could find great songs, it would work.\"[21]\n\n2002: Come Away with Me\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Come Away with Me\n\nBacchus thought producer and engineer Jay Newland's experience in jazz, blues, rock, country, and folk music would give a \"feeling for her sound.\" Jones and Newland recorded nine demo tracks. Four appeared on the sampler First Sessions (2001). The rest were set aside for her debut album.[21] Come Away with Me (2002) was praised for its blend of acoustic pop with soul and jazz.[22] Debuting at No. 139, it reached No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200. The single \"Don't Know Why\" hit No. 1 on the Top 40 Adult Recurrents in 2003 and No. 30 in the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart. At the 45th Grammy Awards in 2003, Jones was nominated for eight Grammy Awards and won five: Best New Artist, Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, Record of the Year, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Don't Know Why\". This tied Lauryn Hill and Alicia Keys for most Grammy Awards received by a female artist in one night. Jesse Harris won Song of the Year for \"Don't Know Why\" while Arif Mardin won Producer of the Year. The album won Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical.[6] Come Away with Me was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for having sold one million copies. In February 2005, it was certified diamond for selling ten million copies.[23]\n\n2004: Feels like Home\n\n[edit]\n\nFeels like Home (2004) debuted at the top of the charts in at least 16 countries, including Germany, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.[24] At the 47th Grammy Awards in 2005, the album was nominated for three Grammys, winning one, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Sunrise\". For \"Here We Go Again\", a duet with Ray Charles, she won Record of the Year and Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.[25] Time magazine named Jones one of the most influential people of 2004.[26]\n\n2007: Not Too Late\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Not Too Late (album)\n\nJones released her third album, Not Too Late, on January 30, 2007. The album was the first for which she wrote or co-wrote every song. She has said some of these songs are much darker than those on her previous albums.[27] Not Too Late was mostly recorded at Jones's home studio. It is her first album without producer Arif Mardin, who died in the summer of 2006. Jones described the sessions as \"fun, relaxed and easy\" and without a deadline; Blue Note executives reportedly did not know she was recording an album. The song \"My Dear Country\" is political commentary; she wrote it before the United States Presidential election day in 2004. Not Too Late reached the No. 1 position in twenty countries. Not Too Late had the third-best first week of sales in 2007, behind Avril Lavigne's The Best Damn Thing and Linkin Park's Minutes to Midnight. It reached No. 1 in the U.S., selling 405,000 copies. EMI announced that Not Too Late reached gold, platinum or multi-platinum in 21 countries as of February 2007.[28] The album has sold 4 million copies worldwide. That same year she sang \"American Anthem\" for the Ken Burns documentary The War.[29][30]\n\n2009: The Fall\n\n[edit]\n\nJones's fourth studio album, The Fall, debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 in November 2009, selling 180,000 copies in its first week. Although it was her first album that did not reach No. 1 in the United States, it did receive critical acclaim.[31] As part of the promotional drive for the album, Jones performed on Dancing with the Stars, Late Show with David Letterman, Good Morning America and other television programs. The Fall featured a St. Bernard on the cover; his name is Ben.[32] The album's lead single, \"Chasing Pirates\", peaked at No. 13 on Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks and No. 7 on Jazz Songs. Billboard's 2000–2009 decade awards ranked Jones as the top jazz recording artist, at No. 60 best Artist. Come Away With Me was elected the No. 4 album and No. 1 jazz album.\n\nJones earned a platinum certification by the RIAA for sales of 1 million copies of The Fall. The album sold 1.5 million copies worldwide and was certified gold or platinum in 14 countries as of 2010. \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\", a duet with Willie Nelson, was nominated in the Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals category. In 2009, Jones performed \"Come Away With Me\" and \"Young Blood\" at the end of the Apple Inc.'s It's Only Rock and Roll press conference on September 9 in San Francisco, for the release of iTunes 9 and video camera-equipped iPods, among other items[33] She also made a guest appearance and performed with other artists on the season three finale of the NBC series 30 Rock[34] Jones started her fourth world tour on March 5, 2010.\n\n2012: Little Broken Hearts\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Little Broken Hearts\n\nAfter working with Danger Mouse and Daniele Luppi on some of the tracks for their album Rome, Jones worked with Danger Mouse again on her fifth studio album, Little Broken Hearts, which was released on May 1, 2012. She played the album in its entirety at SXSW 2012.[35] American Songwriter called Little Broken Hearts the \"most dramatic and rewarding departure she's made in her career.\"[36] On May 25, 2012, she began her fifth world tour in Paris, with performances in Europe, North America, Asia, South America, and Australia. She performed in London at the Roundhouse on September 10, 2012, as part of the iTunes Festival which was broadcast on the internet. She toured three cities in India for the first time because her father wanted her to do so. She also performed a headlining performance at Summer's Day, music festival produced by Only Much Louder. The tour started at Summer's Day in Mumbai on March 3 and included stops in New Delhi on March 5 and Bangalore on March 8.\n\n2016–2019: Day Breaks..and..Begin Again\n\n[edit]\n\nHer sixth studio album, Day Breaks, which included nine new songs and three cover versions, was released on October 7, 2016. \"Carry On\", the album's lead single, was released to digital outlets on the same day.[37] The album marked a return to her piano after dabbling in folk and pop on the last two records. Jones said the goal of this record was to do everything live. She said in an interview with Billboard, \"When you have great musicians, there's no reason to overdub. That strips the soul out of the music.\"[38]\n\nIn 2019, Jones released a compilation album of singles she recorded from 2018 to 2019, entitled Begin Again and the set includes collaborations with Jeff Tweedy and Thomas Bartlett.[39][40][41][42]\n\n2020–present: Pick Me Up Off the Floor, I Dream of Christmas, and Visions\n\n[edit]\n\nHer seventh studio album, Pick Me Up Off the Floor, was released on June 12, 2020.

She appeared twice on the PBS series Austin City Limits, on November 2, 2002, and October 6, 2007.
