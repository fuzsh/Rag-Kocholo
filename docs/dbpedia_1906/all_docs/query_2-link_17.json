        "text": "2000 novel by Francine Prose\n\nBlue Angel is a novel written by author Francine Prose that was published in the year 2000.[1][2] The novel is about the complex relationship between Ted – a 47 years old English professor – and his student Angela that evolves as a satire on sexual harassment on college campuses.[3] This was Prose's 10th publication. The novel is part of the National Library of Australia.[4]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nBoston Review wrote about the book, \"One problem with message-driven theater or literature—presumably, Prose's message is that legislating matters of the heart sets a dangerous precedent in terms of privacy and freedom—is that it quickly dates itself.\"[5]\n\nKirkus Reviews said, \"An academic comedy of manners as engaging as Richard Russo's Straight Man: Prose once again proves herself one of our great cultural satirists.\"[6]"
