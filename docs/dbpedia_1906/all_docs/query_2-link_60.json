        "text": "Mobile phone manufactured by HTC\n\nThe HTC Blue Angel (also known as \"Qtek 9090\" in some European markets) is a GSM Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition PDA-phone, manufactured by High Tech Computer Corporation introduced in 2004. It has a CDMA EVDO variant called the HTC Harrier, which does not have Wi-Fi like the Blue Angel does. Both have the same housing. It is sold by many different vendors under the names of O2 XDA IIs, Orange SPV M2000, Dopod 700, Qtek 9090, T-Mobile MDA III, Siemens SX66, i-mate PDA2k, Vodafone VPx, Verizon XV6600 (Harrier), Sprint PPC-6601 (Harrier) among others, which all have similar hardware specifications.\n\nDimensions: 125 x 72 x 19 (L x W x T mm)\n\nWeight: Approx. 205 g\n\nOperating systems:\n\nWindows Mobile 2003 Second Edition. Unofficial cooked roms for Windows Mobile 5, 6 and 6.1 are available, Recently, Windows Mobile 6.5 beta has been leaked for blue angel and is in developing phase at the xda-developers community.\n\nProcessor: Intel(R) XScale PXA263 400 MHz CPU (possible overclock to 600 MHz)\n\nMemory: Flash ROM:96 MB, RAM:128 MB SDRAM\n\nMemory expansion: SDIO/MMC card slot\n\nCamera: VGA camera (except on the Siemens version, which lacks a camera)\n\nStandard battery capacity: 1490mAh\n\nDisplay: QVGA Transflective 65k Colour LCD, 3.5 inch, 240 x 320 pixels\n\nWireless connectivity: GSM/GPRS and Wi-Fi 802.11b (Blue Angel), or CDMA EVDO (Harrier); plus IrDA and Bluetooth on both models\n\nIn 2010, a UK-based developer created an emulator image of the Android Operating System ported to the HTC Blue Angel, it lacked features and there was no integration with the user. It was an image of Android 1.6 Doughnut but the only things which were usable were the volume control buttons. This development sparked interest on xda-developers where many users were willing to help port a usable Android version to the Blue Angel.\n\nLater in 2011, developer 'zainuintel' created an Angry Birds build for the device, showing how capable the 7 year old device was. He later created an Angry Birds RIO build, but this did not get as much popularity, Support was dropped by the developer in 2012. Starting from June 2012 it was made open source."
