        "text": "Irwin Winkler has had one hell of a career in Hollywood. A legendary producer, his bona fides include films like Rocky, Goodfellas, Creed, and Raging Bull. To reflect on it all, Winkler has penned , Life in Movies: Stories from 50 Years in Hollywood, which chronicles his storied career.\n\nIn this exclusive excerpt from the book, Winkler takes readers behind the scenes of Martin Scorcese and Leonardo DiCaprio's smash hit, The Wolf of Wall Street, including the shady dealings that led to its financing, how Leo and Scorcese wound up on board, and how the authenticity of the film contributed to its ultimate successes.\n\nThose authenticities weren't without their setbacks though. In one story, Winkler remembers Jonah Hill had snorted so much fake cocaine for his role that it made him sick, delaying production. In the end, Winkler paints a vivid picture of what it takes for a Hollywood blockbuster to come together.\n\nThe history of movie financing goes back a century to the nickel-odeon—usually vaudeville houses that ran movies as a pause between singing, dancing, comics, and sometimes striptease acts. In the case of Carl Laemmle, the founder of Universal Studios, he had a dry goods store in Chicago in the early 1900s, and since his merchandise laid flat on his counters, he projected “flicks” at night over the cotton goods without any obstruction.\n\nBecause customers flocked to the films, he gave up the dry goods and financed movies instead. The film industry moved from vaudeville theaters and dry goods stores to short silent films, longer complete stories, talking pictures, and animated stories,from black-and-white to Technicolor to widescreen, stereo sound, special visual effects, IMAX theaters, and very, very expensive comic book style “franchise” films. With these films starting to cost two hundred million to make and another hundred million to market, the major studios looked for financial partners to share their risks. The Wolf of Wall Street was financed not by a Hollywood studio, rich real estate mogul, or oil tycoon, but by a Malaysian investment fund. It was one more strange way to finance a movie.\n\nDon’t get me wrong: I’m very, very glad it got made. The Wolf of Wall Street is a fine film, and it was a lot of fun to make. It was nominated for five Academy Awards and was an enormous audience success, selling $450 million in worldwide ticket sales. It’s remembered for “furious, yet exquisitely controlled, kinetic energy, complete with a plunging and soaring camera, mercurial and conspicuous special effects, counterfactual scenes, subjective fantasies, and swirling choreography on a grand scale” (Richard Brody, the New Yorker). It’s also known for its financing from a “massive Malaysian fraud,” according to Fortune Magazine: “It is once again a case of life imitating art. The Department of Justice has confirmed that it believes the ultimate bad boy financier movie The Wolf of Wall Street was financed through some pretty naughty financial maneuvers.”\n\nThe U.S. government asserted that the fund 1MDB, overseen by Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak,had stolen assets from the billion-dollar fund. The stepson of the prime minister, Riza Aziz, has been named as a “relevant individual.” When I came aboard to executive produce The Wolf of Wall Street, I questioned Aziz and his partner, Joey McFarland, about where the financing was coming from and was told it was from Abu Dhabi government officials whose names they (or I) couldn’t pronounce, but since Aziz was the prime minister’s stepson, all seemed legitimate. In the end the film made a great deal of money for production company Red Granite Pictures and, I hope, the fund.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio seen on location for ’The Wolf of Wall Street’ on September 24, 2012 in New York City.\n\nThe process of making The Wolf of Wall Street, however, started with a phone call (don’t most things in Hollywood start with a phone call?). The call was from Rick Yorn. He asked me to read the script written by Terence Winter based on the reminiscences of Jordan Belfort, who made a fortune on Wall Street through every shady deal imaginable, indulged in every excess imaginable, was sent to prison, and ended up holding motivational seminars all over the globe. Yorn saidLeo DiCaprio was set to play Belfort and asked me to produce The Wolf of Wall Street. Leo had read the book in 2007, and Warner Bros., who purchased it, had passed on making it, as they felt it was too sexy, too raunchy, and too druggy. Leo found the screenplay audacious, funny,raunchy, risky, and very good and was committed to making it regardless.\n\nYorn wanted me to give my thoughts to Marty Scorsese, as Leo believed he was the perfect director. We met, and Marty told me he had read the script and liked it a lot but first wanted an update on Silence (a script Marty had written with Jay Cocks about two Jesuit priests on a mission in Japan in 1650) before we got into The Wolf of Wall Street. I told Marty we had no immediate prospects for financing Silence, but I was very optimistic that we would eventually get the funding. Marty then reread the script, met with the writer, Terence Winter, met withLeo quite a few times, and decided to direct the film. Marty also liked the fact that Red Granite Pictures, who had picked up the rights from Warner Bros. on Leo’s behalf, was funding The Wolf of Wall Street. With independent financing the film could stay true to Belfort’s excesses. It was a unique opportunity. Studios by their nature are conservative,and the freedom we enjoyed ultimately made The Wolf of Wall Street the success it was.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorcese.\n\nMarty Scorsese strives for authenticity in his movies. The actors have to know their character better than know themselves, and he makes sure that he and the actors spend time with the characters they are playing. In The Wolf of Wall Street real stockbrokers worked in scenes with our actors and were encouraged to contribute lines of dialogue, the look of their wardrobe, their eating and drinking habits,even their after-hours activities. Marty rehearsed the actors in phone conversations that were as smooth as silk or agitated to the point of a slammed-down phone. The actors, of course, never took drugs or drank liquor that might affect their acting, but Jonah Hill snorted such a great amount of fake drugs that he got so sick, he couldn’t work for days. We had to shoot an alternate scene to give his body time to recover. Leo got expert advice on how to react to quaaludes directly from the expert Jordan Belfort. Although I have no idea how Belfort really remembers his quaalude high! The reality went too far in one crazy scene where an actress had to be dismissed when she came on to Leo too enthusiastically in a supposedly “simulated” sex scene.\n\nMargot Robbie on the set of ’The Wolf of Wall Street’ on September 21, 2012 in New York City.\n\nOther than DiCaprio the casting was mostly unknowns or up-and-coming actors. Jonah Hill was, I thought, a bit young for Leo’s side-kick, but he put himself on tape and went toe to toe with Leo and had the cast and crew in stiches with his brilliant improvisation. Margot Robbie, playing Leo’s wife, impressed Marty with her understanding of her character. She told the press that she insisted on doing her seduction scene with Leo totally nude, as that was the only way her character could win Leo’s very successful Jordan Belfort. Matthew McConaughey, already a pretty big star, worked for scale, and in preparing for his first scene with Leo, McConaughey pounded his chest and hummed. Marty thought it was right in the zone of what the film needed. Leo told me that after the film opened in France, while he was walking in Paris, he was greeted by crowds of young kids imitating him and Matthew McConaughey pounding on their chests and humming.\n\n\"[Trump] said I’d made a big mistake by turning him down, because he would have made a 'great deal.'\"\n\nLeo was able to show Belfort’s character having just about every emotion. He went from serious to comic to drunk to drugged out, sometimes angry and anxious and sometimes sad. In a scene where he tries to open his car door while he’s high on quaaludes, he opens the door with his feet, lying on his back. It was funny and reminded me of the great silent film actors Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Leo also had a back-ache for days. We cast an ex–James Bond girl, Joanna Lumley, to play Margot Robbie’s aunt, and Leo, playing his Jordan Belfort character, got a lot more friendly than Lumley expected from her niece’s husband. The shock showed in her face. Initially we wanted Julie Andrews for the role, as it would have been fun having Mary Poppins in an R-rated movie, but at the last minute she couldn’t clear her schedule. Andrews did however bare her breasts in her husband Blake Edwards’s movie S.O.B., so maybe it wouldn’t have been too much of a shock to have Mary Poppins get kissed rather passionately by Jordan Belfort.\n\nDonald Trump in 2012.\n\nWhile shooting outside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue one night, we were greeted by the future president, who hinted that he wouldn’t mind a part in The Wolf of Wall Street, but it couldn’t be a walk-on. He also remembered calling me almost thirty years earlier, wanting me to shoot Rocky IV at his Atlantic City hotel, and said I’d made a big mistake by turning him down, because he would have made a “great deal.”\n\nThe first cut of Wolf ran three hours and fifty-five minutes. An hour too long, and theaters wouldn’t play it, as they would lose a showing and lose sales of not only box office receipts but popcorn and candy (where they make the big money). But what to cut? Marty had managed to shoot just about every scene as entertainment in its own right. The story had a traditional line: poor ambitious guy gets a break, succeeds beyond his wildest dreams, gets himself (and others) in trouble, ends up in the slammer. But with The Wolf of Wall Street it’s a helluva lot of fun to watch as Belfort goes from rags to riches. As played by Leo, you can’t help but like him. The editing process was slow and measured, not cutting too much off a scene or cutting too little. Thelma Schoonmaker, our editor, labored with Marty for months, and every couple of weeks Margo and I would fly to New York to see the latest cut. Every trip was another screening, as we would bring in fifteen to twenty acquaintances to get reactions. By the time the film was down to three hours we were getting close to the release date and had a screen-ing for an audience of about one hundred. The film played great—lots of laughs, lots of nervousness, and lots of applause. We celebrated that night at Mr. Chow’s with champagne flowing—not quite up to Belfort partying but close.\n\nFormer Wall Street stockbroker Jordan Belfort (L) was portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio (R) in ’The Wolf of Wall Street.’\n\nThe last-minute cuts pushed our release date to Christmas from Thanksgiving, and we had to deal with the ratings board before we could lock up the picture. Marty reminded me that on Raging Bull I’d met with the board, refused to make any cuts, and they’d backed down. He wanted me to do the same for The Wolf of Wall Street. It wasn’t necessary, as they, surprisingly, asked for a few very minor cuts, and we obliged. On December 14 in Los Angeles I held a screening for friends, Academy members, and industry big hitters. The film played great, and after the showing we had a party at my house. The directors Francis Ford Coppola, Norman Jewison, Scott Cooper, and Rupert Wyatt couldn’t get over Marty’s energy, courage, and originality. On December 16 in New York my friend Mort Zuckerman hosted a screening for about seventy-five friends and got the same response. The strongest reaction was from Justice Stephen Breyer, who had a fine time, liked the film a lot, but couldn’t believe our R-rating (I’m glad I didn’t have to defend it to the Supreme Court). The film received excellent reviews. The New York Times (“One of the best films of the year”), Rolling Stone, and the Los Angeles Times raves all gave Paramount Pictures, who distributed the film domestically, a made-to-order marketing campaign on a film that needed the legitimacy of critics to get the audience into a hard-R-rated film, especially during the Christmas season.\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street didn’t win any of its five Academy Award nominations. I guess the Academy members were somewhat turned off by all the sex, booze, and drugs. Leo did win a Golden Globe for Best Actor, and the film did get wins from many other festivals.\n\nThe U.S. government has seized many of the Red Granite assets, and Red Granite says they are cooperating in the investigation of the 1MDB.\n\nThe film has been banned in Malaysia by Prime Minister Najib Razak, although the 1MDB, according to the U.S. Justice Department, financed the making of The Wolf of Wall Street.\n\nExcerpt from the new book A Life in Movies: Stories from 50 Years in Hollywood by Irwin Winkler (Abrams Press), on-sale May 7, 2019; © 2019 Irwin Winkler"
