        "text": "Sylvester Stallone keeps punching. For the second time in a month, he’s gotten into the ring that is Instagram to voice complaints about the current ownership of the Rocky franchise.\n\nThe most recent jab came Saturday night, in which he uploaded industry trade reports about Drago, a project in the works that would likely continue the story of Rocky IV villain Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) and his son, Creed II baddie Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu). MGM has hired screenwriter Robert Lawton to pen the script. (Oddly enough, Lawton first got industry attention with Becoming Rocky, an unproduced spec script about the making of the first Rocky picture.)\n\n“Another Heartbreaker… Just found this out…,” Stallone began in his caption. “ONCE AGAIN, this PATHETIC 94 year old PRODUCER and HIS MORONIC USELESS VULTURE CHILDREN, Charles And David, are once again picking clean THE BONES of another wonderful character I created without even telling me … I APOLOGIZE to the FANS, I never wanted ROCKY characters to be exploited by these parasites… By the way, I have nothing but respect for my true friend, Dolph Lundgren.”\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe aforementioned “pathetic 94 year-old” is a reference to the 91-year-old Irwin Winkler, Academy Award-winning producer of the Rocky franchise as well as acclaimed films like GoodFellas, ‘Round Midnight, Raging Bull, The Gambler, and They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?\n\nThe weird spacing in the caption is probably because it is hard to type with boxing gloves on.\n\nWhile Stallone wrote the screenplay for the initial Rocky film, and later directed most of the sequels, he does not own the rights to the character. When the script was in development, the studio, United Artists, wanted a better-known actor for the role (Burt Reynolds was in the mix, as was James Caan and Ryan O’Neal.) Winkler (and co-producer Robert Chartoff) stood by Sly as he turned down a $300,000 offer for just the script at a time he had just $106 in his bank account.\n\nThe movie was made at a lower budget, and Stallone earned $75,000 as both writer and star, plus a percentage of the profits. However, with the producers backing him in his desire to play the part, he did not retain ownership rights.\n\nOf course, the movie became a phenomenon, winning the Best Picture Oscar, and launching Stallone into superstardom. (And those percentage points are estimated at $2.5 million.)\n\nWhile Stallone is still listed as a producer on Creed III, which comes out later this year, it is the first of the nine films in which he will not appear, and only the second, after Creed, where he does not have some kind of screenplay credit. (He co-wrote Creed II, though not the first one, weirdly enough.)\n\nEarlier this month, Stallone fired off another two messages to Instagram, which have since been deleted. The first (and relevant to the most recent “vulture children” comment) came after Stallone offered a book review of The Arrangement: A Love Story, a memoir written by David Winkler, Irwin’s son, who has gone into the family business.\n\n“You know I love reading and I’ve read thousands of books but I have to say THIS one is by far the worst! If you ever run out of toilet paper PLEASE by this one you won’t be disappointed,” Stallone wrote.\n\nHe added that the “unbearable worthless dreck was written by the painfully untalented David Winkler,” and called Irwin Winkler “the remarkably untalented and parasitical Producer of Rocky and Creed.”\n\nHe went on to say, deploying unnecessary apostrophes, that he loved the late Robert Chartoff, then complained that “if it wasn’t for Winkler there would’ve been at least another three Rocky’s, that would’ve been wonderful,” then concluded “frankly that crew are the worst unhuman beings I’ve ever met in the movie industry. I will forever love the loyal fans and keep punching.!!! REMEMBER IT FEELS GOOD TO CLEAR YOUR HEART.”\n\nThe Arrangement, incidentally, details David Winkler’s philosophy of “ethical non-monogamy” and the profundities of being a “sugar daddy.” It describes the wealthy Hollywood producer’s encounters with “a beautiful Instagram model” for whom the author apparently caught feels, as they say.\n\nThe day after this cross-generational Winkler slam in mid-July, Stallone uploaded another now-deleted missive, in which he clarified he was angry about not owning rights to his most famous character. “I really would like [to] have at least a little WHAT’s LEFT of my RIGHTS back, before passing it on to ONLY YOUR CHILDREN – I believe That would be a FAIR gesture,” he wrote, adding that the whole issue “eats at my soul, because I wanted to leave something of Rocky for my children.”\n\nHere’s hoping that Stallone, a new Mar-a-Lago member with an estimated wealth of $400 million in 2018 according to Men’s Health via CelebrityNetWorth.com, retained the rights to Cobra."
