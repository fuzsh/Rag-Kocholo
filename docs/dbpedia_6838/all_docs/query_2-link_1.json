With producing credits that included \"Rocky\" (1976), \"Raging Bull\" (1980) and \"Goodfellas\" (1990), Winkler landed a spot on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2000, assuring his stature as one of the steadiest filmmakers in the late 20th century.\n\nPhotos\n\nIrwin Winkler at arrivals for SILENCE Premiere, Directors Guild of America (DGA) Theater, Los Angeles, CA January 5, 2017.
