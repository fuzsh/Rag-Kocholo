        "text": "Watching Gone With the Wind at the age of seven was a life-changing moment for Irwin Winkler. \"I was entranced,\" the Oscar-winning producer recalls. \"They would release it every five years, and I waited every five years. Gone With the Wind was the one that did it for me.\"\n\nAt the 49th Oscars, producers Winkler and Robert Chartoff took home Best Picture for the boxing drama, Rocky. \"It was an out-of-body experience,\" he says. \"You never really think you're going to catch a star while it's glittering.\" Even all these years later, Winkler has a clear memory of pulling star Sylvester Stallone onstage with them. \"In those days, only the producer would accept the award,\" he explains. \"We wanted to share it with him.\"\n\nThese days, Winkler keeps his Oscar on the mantle in his sitting room (\"You can't miss it when you're coming in\") as a reminder of what is possible: \"The competition at the time was pretty crazy! The other four films that were nominated were All the President's Men, Bound for Glory, Network, and Marty's movie, Taxi Driver,\" he rattles off. \"We made a movie for no money, shot it in 28 days, with an unknown actor, and it all came together. It's a story about a million-to-one chance of a guy succeeding in life, and it turned out, it's the story of Stallone as well.\"\n\nWinkler has earned additional Best Picture nominations for Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull (1980), for Philip Kaufman's The Right Stuff (1983), and for Goodfellas (1990), also by Scorsese. Now in his 90s, Winkler is still producing, including the Rocky spin-off franchise, Creed. (He produced all three Creed films.) And he has continued to work with Scorsese, having produced Silence (2016) and The Irishman (2019) in recent years. After decades in the industry, what he looks for in a project has never changed.\n\n\"I remember talking to Chuck Yeager when we were on the set of The Right Stuff, and I said to him, 'How does it feel to go up there in space and break the sound barrier?' And he said, 'You know what? I get out there every day, and I just do it,'\" Winkler recounts. \"That's really how I look upon my producing. And you're lucky if you manage to get it on the screen, and you're even luckier that people like it.\""
