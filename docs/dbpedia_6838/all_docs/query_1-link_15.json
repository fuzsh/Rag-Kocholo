        "text": "Join us for an evening with Irwin Winkler, the legendary Hollywood producer behind Rocky, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas, to name a few. We’ll be screening Guilty by Suspicion (1991), written and directed by Winkler himself, and starring Robert DeNiro and Annette Bening. JBFC Board President Janet Maslin reviewed the “gripping drama” for the New York Times, where she applauded its “wrenchingly effective” portrayal of the Hollywood blacklist era. Afterwards, they’ll discuss the film and Winkler’s new autobiography, A Life in Movies: Stories from 50 Years in Hollywood. This charming and insightful memoir delves into Winkler’s extraordinary career, from working on his first film (starring Elvis), to producing a string of some of the most provocative and influential films in American cinema.\n\nPresented in 35mm\n\nBook sale and signing to follow!
