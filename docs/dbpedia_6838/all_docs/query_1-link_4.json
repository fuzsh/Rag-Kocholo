        "meta_description": "A rollicking autobiography from a legendary film producer and an insider's account of making movies in Hollywood for more than half a century. The list of films Irwin Winkler has produced in his more-than-fifty-year career is extraordinary. It includes Rocky, Goodfellas, Raging Bull, De-Lovely, The Right Stuff, and Creed. His films have been nominated for fifty-two Academy Awards, five of them for Best Picture, and have won twelve. In A Life in Movies, his charming and insightful memoir, Winkler tells the stories of his career through his many films as a producer and then as a writer and director, charting the changes in Hollywood over the decades. Winkler started in the famous William Morris mailroom and made his first film -- starring Elvis -- in the last days of the old studio system. Beginning in the late 1960s, and then for decades to come, he produced a string of provocative and influential films, making him one of the most critically lauded, prolific, and commercially successful producers of his era. This is a candid, engrossing book, a captivating exploration of what it means to be a producer: purchasing rights, developing scripts, casting actors, managing directors, editing film, and winning awards. Filled with tales of legendary and beloved films, as well as some not-so-legendary and forgotten ones, and his frequent collaborators including Martin Scorsese, Robert DeNiro, Sylvester Stallone, Michael B. Jordan, and others, A Life in Movies takes readers behind the scenes and into the history of Hollywood.",
