        "text": "Post by Deleted on\n\nWill this be like Manchester by the Sea or Beasts of No Nation?\n\nIt's going straight to streaming per the article with a limited qualify release pending thereafter\n\nThis is just overall very strange and it's apparent Silence caused tension between Paramount and Scorsese (Though, he still has another picture deal with them-- assuming Devil in White City)\n\nThe script is fine-- if a bit derivative and dark-- but it still had solid commercial aspects\n\nPost by sqeeze on\n\nNetflix has acquired worldwide rights to Martin Scorsese’s gangster movie “The Irishman,” starring Robert De Niro.\n\nNetflix would not comment on the deal but sources close to the project confirmed a report by IndieWire.\n\n“The Irishman” will be the ninth collaboration between Scorsese and De Niro. Steven Zaillian has written the script, based on the Charles Brandt’s 2004 book, “I Heard You Paint Houses,” which centered on the life of the mob hitman Frank “The Irishman” Sheeran.\n\nScorsese and De Niro first partnered on 1973’s “Mean Streets,” followed by “Taxi Driver,” “New York, New York,” “Raging Bull,” “The King of Comedy,” “Goodfellas,” “Cape Fear” and 1995’s “Casino.”\n\nProduction on “The Irishman” is expected to start later this year.\n\nThe project originated in 2008 at Paramount with De Niro’s Tribeca Productions and De Niro’s producing partner Jane Rosenthal along with Scorsese’s Sikelia Productions.\n\nEdit:\n\nLater this year? DAMN! I expected as camera will start rolling this summer allready? What the hell is going on again?\n\nPost by sqeeze on\n\nIs the budget really going to be 100m? That seems preposterous for a Netflix production.\n\nFrom another source.\n\nAccording to insiders, Netflix is negotiating to acquire worldwide rights to The Irishman in a deal believed to be in the $100m range.\n\nIt is understood the budget has shot up as Scorsese plans to use costly effects to render a younger version of his cast, which includes old collaborator Robert De Niro.\n\nStx International reportedly paid $50m last summer for international sales rights, while Paramount currently holds Us rights.\n\nHowever the studio’s leadership issues may have weakened its hand, and disappointing Us box office on Scorsese’s erstwhile awards hope Silence will have given Netflix further ammunition in a bid for all rights.\n\nEdit: So it seems like $50m just for to get rights on making movie from that book?! WOW.\n\nIs 100m some extreme for Neflix? I have no clue to be honest.\n\nPost by sqeeze on\n\nUps. Looks like I made thread in wrong place and its allready there and in proper section. Still kinda learning how to use this place to be honest. Should I delete it? Nothing much happened in it anyway.\n\nmovie-awards-redux.freeforums.net/thread/643/netflix-buys-martin-scorsese-irishman\n\nJust copy here my last thoughs with info\n\nAccording to insiders, Netflix is negotiating to acquire worldwide rights to The Irishman in a deal believed to be in the $100m range.\n\nIt is understood the budget has shot up as Scorsese plans to use costly effects to render a younger version of his cast, which includes old collaborator Robert De Niro.\n\nStx International reportedly paid $50m last summer for international sales rights, while Paramount currently holds Us rights.\n\nHowever the studio’s leadership issues may have weakened its hand, and disappointing Us box office on Scorsese’s erstwhile awards hope Silence will have given Netflix further ammunition in a bid for all rights.\n\n=====================================================================================\n\nEdit: So it seems like $50m just for to get rights on making movie from that book?! WOW.\n\nIs 100m some extreme for Netflix? I have no clue to be honest.\n\nAnother thing which just crossed my mind as why they couldnt use original title: I Heard You Paint Houses if they payed 50m allready just for rights? Its much more badass title than some Irishman. Irishman actually almost exists as title of movie here: www.imdb.com/title/tt1416801/?ref_=nv_sr_2 is it similar story or not? Wondering if I should check it out or not?\n\nPost by Zeb31 on\n\nPavan Looks like it, unfortunately.\n\nSo how would this be Oscar eligible if it's for a streaming company? I hate Netflix as it wasn't made for tv and fck watching films on your phone or tablet rather than a big screen.\n\nIt's eligible if they give it a qualifying theater run, which they no doubt will. Beasts of No Nation got one and was eligible for awards consideration (which is why Elba got a Globe nomination and won SAG), but the problem with Netflix is that they go directly against the current system: by making their films available on their platform on the same day they hit cinemas, they're giving theater chains the finger. There's usually a 90-day window in which films play only in theaters before they're available on VOD/home media, and when Netflix eliminate that window, they drastically diminish theatrical grosses. That's why I don't see any Netflix film doing terribly well at the Oscars beyond Best Documentary anytime soon: the Academy doesn't seem keen to throw a bone to a distributor that's going against the grain and shaking up the whole industry model. Amazon doesn't do that (their films all play in theaters for a long time before they're available to stream), and that's why they had so much success this year. I guess Scorsese is as likely as anyone to deliver the first Netflix original that breaks through in the main categories, but after the cold shoulder they gave to Silence, I'm not too confident he'll pull it off.\n\nPost by cornnetto on\n\nIs the budget really going to be 100m? That seems preposterous for a Netflix production.\n\nEdit: So it seems like $50m just for to get rights on making movie from that book?! WOW.\n\nIs 100m some extreme for Neflix? I have no clue to be honest.\n\nI don't see where it talk for the movie adaptation rights, from a quick read the 50 million for the rights of international distribution is buying the international revenue from a Scorsese movie in advance, that is pretty common for movie like that to pre-sales market to reduce risk.\n\nHas for the 100m extreme for Netflix, that is what they paid for the Elizabeth 2 series, Netflix revenue in 2016 were of 8.8 billion, HBO was 5.6 billion in 2015, Warner Brothers studio was of 9.9 billion without video game revenue.\n\nIf they are not already, they will become the bigger spender on content in the world, bigger than the studios."
