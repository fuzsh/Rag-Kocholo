        "text": "Background\n\nThis is the production company of film producing duo Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler, best known for producing the Rocky franchise, for which they won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1976. The duo would later pick up nominations for Raging Bull and The Right Stuff, the latter being their last project together before the partnership dissolved in 1985. Despite this, the name is still used today and is managed by their children, William Chartoff and Charles and David Winkler respectively. Since 1976, the company only used in-credit notices on their films until a fully animated logo debuted on Creed III.\n\nLogo (March 3, 2023-)\n\nVisuals: In a dimly lit setting, there are multiple flights of stairs that the scene pans across. When the scene reaches the top, the gold letters \"CW\" are seen while the setting spins around the letters and comes to a stop in front of the text which sits under multiple invisible spotlights, the logo stays on screen for a few seconds before fading to black.\n\nTrivia: The logo is a reference to the most famous scene in the Rocky franchise, where Rocky Balboa runs up the steps to the Philadelphia Museum of Art as part of his training before his match against Apollo Creed. The scene has since been recreated by Philadelphia tourists and has been referenced in other films and TV shows.\n\nTechnique: CGI\n\nAudio: The opening theme of the movie."
