As a producer, Irwin Winkler has shown "The Right Stuff," made a star of Sylvester Stallone with "Rocky," and had Martin Scorsese's back in the production of two undisputed classics: "Raging Bull" and "Goodfellas." Now, nearly 30 years after "Goodfellas," Winkler, Scorsese and Robert De Niro are reuniting for "The Irishman," a film about Jimmy Hoffa, which also stars Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. Ben Mankiewicz, the host of Turner Classic Movies, talks with the 88-year-old Winkler about his gangbusters Hollywood career.
