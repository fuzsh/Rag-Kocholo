John Dewey's quest for unity: the journey of a promethean mystic. Amherst, N.Y.: Prometheus Books, 2009. From publisher: Gale argues that what makes Dewey's philosophy unique and exciting is his attempt to synthesise what Gale calls \"Prometheanism\" with Dewey's unique brand of mysticism. As Gale points out, Dewey celebrated human beings as Promethean creators of meaning and value through the active control of nature. But at the same time, Dewey created a synthesis whereby a sort of mystical unifying experience results from the subject's active engagement with the environment through inquiry. Paradoxically, the active subject becomes passive in this synthesis to achieve unification with a shared spiritual reality, which Dewey expressed as a \"common faith\". Gale goes on to show that for Dewey artistic creation is the paradigm of this synthesis.\n\nGlock, Hans-Johann. Quine and Davidson on Language, Thought and Reality.

Jane Addams: A Writer's Life. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2009. From publisher: Joslin examines Addams's rejection of scholarly writing in favor of a synthesis of fictional and analytical prose that appealed to a wider audience. Joslin traces Addams's style from her early works to her modernist and experimental last books, placing Addams in the context of other Chicago writers including Theodore Dreiser, Upton Sinclair, Harriet Monroe, Frank Norris and James T. Farrell. Joslin's close readings showcase Addams's distinguishing literary devices, such as using stories about people rather than sociological argument to make moral points. As Joslin pursues the argument that Addams's power as a public figure stemmed from the success of her books and essays, Addams herself emerges as a literary woman.\n\nKahn, Jonathon Samuel.

Philosophy of the Social Sciences: Towards Pragmatism. Cambridge: Polity Press, 2005. From publisher: The book provides an in-depth discussion of the contributions by Durkheim, Weber, Popper, critical realism, critical theory and pragmatism to the philosophy of the social sciences. It advances a new approach to this discipline, one that is indebted to American pragmatism. According to this perspective, methodology ties in with cognitive interests. The answer to the question 'how shall we conduct research?' depends to a large extent on what we want to achieve in the first place. Most contributions to the philosophy of social sciences assume that social research is a descriptive or explanatory endeavour. The pragmatist perspective, advocated in the book, emphasizes that social research can aim at other objectives.\n\nBen-Menahem, Yemina. Hilary Putnam.

From publisher: This book interprets Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles with the openness toward experience recommended by John Dewey's Art as Experience. The characters of Tess are considered as real people with sexual bodies and complex minds. Efron identifies the \"experience blockers\" that the critical tradition has stumbled upon, and defends Hardy's involvement in telling his story. Efron offers a new way of evaluating literature inspired by Dewey's pragmatist aesthetics. Reviewed by C. S.

From publisher: Rockwell rejects both dualism and the mind-brain identity theory. He proposes instead that mental phenomena emerge not merely from brain activity but from an interacting nexus of brain, body, and world. The mind can be seen not as an organ within the body, but as a \"behavioral field\" that fluctuates within this brain-body-world nexus. If we reject the dominant form of the mind-brain identity theory-which Rockwell calls \"Cartesian materialism\" (distinct from Daniel Dennett's concept of the same name)-and accept this new alternative, then many philosophical and scientific problems can be solved. Other philosophers have flirted with these ideas, including Dewey, Heidegger, Putnam, Millikan, and Dennett. But Rockwell goes further than these tentative speculations and offers a detailed alternative to the dominant philosophical view, applying pragmatist insights to contemporary scientific and philosophical problems.\n\nRorty, Richard, with Eduardo Mendieta.

The Judicial Process: Realisms, pragmatism, practical reasoning and principles. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2005. From publisher: Much judicial reasoning still exhibits an unquestioning acceptance of positivism and a 'rulish' predisposition. This book, written by a practicing judge, dismantles these outdated theories and seeks to bridge the gap between legal theory and judicial practice. The author propounds a coherent and comprehensive judicial methodology for modern times.\n\nVan den Bossche, Marc. Ironie et solidarité: une introduction au pragmatisme de Richard Rorty.

From author: In the modernist city rationality ruled and subsumed difference in a logic of identity. In the postmodern city, reason is abandoned for an endless play of difference. Reason in the City of Difference poses an alternative to these extremes by drawing on classical American philosophical pragmatism (and its contemporary developments in feminism and the philosophy of communication) to explore the possibilities of a strengthening and deepening of reason in the contemporary city.\n\nCain, Rudolph Alexander Kofi.
