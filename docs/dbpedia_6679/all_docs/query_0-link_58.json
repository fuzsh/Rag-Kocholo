        "text": "The four systems of atheism which have wreaked havoc upon humanity since the 19th century, are: Positivism, Secularism, Pessimism and Socialism. In this podcast, Carl focuses solely on secularism. The term “secular” is from the Latin saeculum, meaning “generation” or “age,” signifying “belonging to this age or the world.” It was first used by G. J. Holyoake, and denotes a system which interprets life on principles taken solely from this world, without recourse to belief in God or an afterlife. Secularism ignores the principles of supernatural religion in the interpretation of the world and existence. Are you aware of the influence secularism has had on your belief system? Join Carl now for a deep dive into this atheistic philosophy…\n\nHere is a complete transcript of the broadcast (below)…\n\nFriend, in a recent broadcast I mentioned to you four systems of atheism that have wreaked havoc upon humanity since the 19th century especially. These four so called ‘ism’s’, are:- Positivism, Secularism, Pessimism and Socialism. The fixation of this broadcast will be the second item on this list, namely Secularism. If one looks this word up in the dictionary, you’ll soon realize it categorizes the complete and utter removal of God from society and the denial of any supernatural element of our existence. For them, everything in the universe must be explainable in terms of natural laws alone. The supernatural components of our creation are ignored and of course God is ignored because He’s our supernatural creator. In practice, secular humanism has become the philosophy that ‘man’ is the chief end of man, and that man’s happiness is his supreme purpose. However, Paul Johnson the famous British historian gives us this dire warning, “Christ’s central theme is that God, not man, is the final authority. God has rights. Human beings have duties; we deny God his rights at our peril.” Amen to that. The truth is friend, we are put on this earth to ‘serve,’ and our pivotal focus is not ourselves but serving others being the central focus of our existence.\n\nIn reality, Secularism is in fact an offshoot of the philosophy of Atheism and our educational and governmental system in this nation and all over Europe, embraces this detrimental mindset. One observation is that Secularists have an ongoing romance with big government. Secularists always put their trust in government, whereas Christians put their trust in the living God and respect government. However, we all know the bigger the government, the more our personal rights and freedoms become diminished.\n\nSome scholars claim that secularism is a reaction to the overly pious attitude of the European Middle Ages where Christians would lock themselves up in monasteries, take vows of silence, focusing on God only, leaving all human affairs in the hands of others. As a reaction to this medieval tendency, secularism, at the time of the Renaissance, exhibited itself in the development of humanism, when people began to show more interest in human cultural achievements and the possibilities of their fulfillment in this world. You could argue that secularism arose because the Church wrongly distanced itself from everyday suffering and was indeed a backlash to the apathy if the Body of Christ at the time.\n\nThe leading authorities of Secular humanism down the years include the following list of gentlemen esteemed by some; they include Isaac Asimov, Paul Kurtz, Corliss Lamont, Bertrand Russell, Julian Huxley, Margaret Sanger, Ted Turner, Richard Dawkins and finally, John Dewey…. More on John Dewey later…\n\nThis movement toward secularism has been a progressive one during the entire course of modern history and continues unabated today. Secular Humanism’s mandate is to eradicate Jesus Christ from all realms of society but especially in media, government and public educational and one has to say they’ve done a pretty darn good job of it up till now. Humanism began with the Greeks of course; those lovers of Wisdom and forgers of the foundation stone of all humanistic thought, namely atheism, the belief that there is no God. The Greek philosopher Protagoras came up with the Genesis of this philosophy with His two pronged statement that Man is the measure of all things and contradictory statements are equally true. But this of course is asinine and a lie.\n\nThe French philosopher Descartes later tried to project his mind into the universe and concluded with these words, “I think, therefore I am.” This was the moment that man began his road to self worship and his foolish mind became darkened. Descartes humanistic rationalism was then later expounded upon by the likes of Voltaire and Rousseau and further developed by men like Hegel, Ludwig, Feuerbach and Nietzsche in the 19th Century. But let’s not forget that it was Thomas Aquinas, a saint according to the Catholic Church who has much to blame regarding the infiltration of humanism into religious circles. Aquinas studied Aristotle to great lengths and managed to convince the church of the 13th century to embrace these humanistic views by mixing philosophy with scripture and Christianity has been reeling ever since.\n\nThen later during the 18th century this rebellious philosophy gained momentum in France, as the French skeptics and Jesuit scholars of Rousseau and Voltaire, laid an intelligential framework for the ungodly and blood thirsty French Revolution. In 1792 the French changed the calendar to year 1 and proclaimed the ‘goddess of reason’ in Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. This female deity was nothing new of course and was emblematic of the ancient goddess Artemis to the Greeks also known as Diana to the Romans. In their denial of Almighty God; the French Revolutionists openly embraced this female deity, sparking insurrection in the people, eventually leading to the slaughter of 40,000 people and 1300 prisoners before it was all over. You see humanism, promises utopia for all, but delivers hell. When God is finally removed from society it destroys everything it touches because God placed his statutes upon us as loving constraints for our benefit. However, if these constraints are removed anarchy and repression will inevitably transpire.\n\nIf Humanism began in the Renaissance period and was revitalized during the enlightenment, then it was during the 20th century that its protocol was captured in a document called the Humanist Manifesto of 1933. This humanist manifesto was concocted by a group of 34 American humanists to document their philosophy, starting with their first affirmation which stated that, they regarded the universe as self-existing and not created. This Manifesto gained entrance into our school system through the decades largely because of the American philosopher and educator John Dewey. It was later amended and expounded upon in 1973 under humanist Manifesto II and again in the year 2000.\n\nDewey, the father of the progressive educational system and lauded by modern educators, did more for the secularist takeover of American education than any other man. He was an atheist, socialist, evolutionist, and board member of the British Fabian Society. He once said, “There is no God and there is no soul.” He also claimed that truth is relative and absolutes are not admissible. Unfortunately this man stripped the nation of its Christian values within the classroom and by 1957 the secularist infiltration of our school system was well under way.\n\nOne observer Cal Thomas, had this to say about the school system into which our children are subject to today, quote…” The humanist left knows the only way it can create substantial numbers of new ideological and social robots eager to follow in their failed footsteps is to imprison substantial numbers of children in government schools where they are force fed liberal ideology and lied to about sex, about history, and about a whole lot of other things at taxpayers’ expense.” unquote\n\nFriend, a six yr old doesn’t make a decision to become transgender. That means this ideology has been taught to that child until he or she becomes indoctrinated to the point where they are coerced into the decision. This is the fruit we are now reaping from this Humanistic educational system. The parents and teachers are culpable for the corruption of this child wrongly declaring gender as choice. Jesus warned of the dire consequences of harming one of these little ones and what is taught in the classroom today is frankly disturbing to say the least.\n\nThe end game of all humanists is to develop a one world government and the dismantling of sovereign borders and ultimately nations by a worldwide organization possessing international sovereignty. But friend they already have this weapon at their disposal, it’s called the United Nations and is the shrine to which all humanists bow. The underlying premise of the United Nations is based upon socialism. Socialism results in more government and the United Nations is a springboard to a global government that one day no-one will escape from. Socialism has proven to be a failure in every country in which it has been tried, including, Russia, China, Eastern Europe, Africa and Cuba. But there’s a young and naive generation of Americans who see leaders like Bernie Saunders as a preacher of something new, but this is no new philosophy friend. I urge these youngsters to pick up a history book and educate themselves because the only people enamored with Socialism today are young Americans who’ve never lived under it but are willing to give it a try nonetheless.\n\nDo these youngsters know that the socialistic revolutions of the 20th century resulted in the murder of over 170 million soles? The harsh reality is that all socialistic roads lead to the gulag and oppression of mankind. There is no alternative when you remove God from society. Because our Millennial’s are not educated as to the harsh realities of socialism, they’re ready to embrace something new but don’t realize that getting something for free is always at the expense of someone else. Margaret Thatcher the late Prime Minister of Great Britain put it best when she was claimed to have said,” the trouble with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people’s money.” The acid test is this; let me ask you “is anyone running to gain citizenship into the communist countries around the world? I don’t think so. The late great Tim LaHaye said it best, when he stated that, “Humanism and communism are related: Humanism is the mother, communism the daughter; humanism is the root, communism the branch.” We are in danger of losing this generation to the lies of Socialism as it’s reinvented as the solution to worldwide poverty and equality for all. But these lies were sown in a flailing secular educational system and we are now bearing the fruit of it, forging a mindset of entitlement in our youth, who’re not willing to work hard for a living.\n\nThe saddest part of all is although the current educational system is far flung from its original Christian standard. Did you know Harvard, Yale and Princeton were all founded as seminaries along with several other Ivy League universities? This is not surprising when you consider that 95 percent of the original 250 Founding Fathers of this nation would qualify as Bible-believing Christians and 92 percent of the signers of the US Constitution would be so classified. The reality is Harvard, Yale’s and Princeton was founded as Christian institutions of higher education. Harvard’s rules for learning included the following and I quote,” Let every student be plainly instructed and earnestly pressed to consider well that the main end of life and studies is to know God and Jesus Christ which is eternal life and therefore to lay Christ in the bottom as the only foundation of all sound knowledge and learning.” Wow friend listen to that statement if only the Universities of today would follow this charter.\n\nYale and Princeton had messages very similar to these. I don’t have time to read them now but I’m looking at them and you can research this for yourself. Most of the Founding Fathers were graduates of these Christian learning centers of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Dartmouth or Colombia. For the first 100 years of America’s existence and thereof the first 150 colleges founded, they were done so by a church, denomination, or religious group. How far we have fallen from this wonderful Biblical legacy. Today most of these universities do their very best to keep God outside its walls.\n\nThe reality is humanists view man as independent, accountable to no-one, self-directed, godlike with unlimited goodness and potential, yet we know from Scripture man is depraved, leaderless, lost, and in need of a savior. The agenda of secularists today is to press local leaders and politicians to pass legislature that takes the control of children away from their parents, giving it to the state. This follows the model originally outlined in Plato’s Republic as man is guided into the roles outlined for him by the governmental elite.\n\nBut what does God have to say to those who remove him from society and trust in man for their salvation? Jeremiah 17:5–8; “Thus saith the Lord; Cursed be the one that trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm, and whose heart departs from the Lord. 6For he shall be like a shrub in the desert, And shall not see when good comes, But shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, “\n\nFriend, God says any nation that puts trust in man instead of God is cursed and since we removed prayer and the Bible from schools in 1962, Violent crime has risen 350%, national morality figures have plummeted, and teen pregnancy has escalated rapidly. Criminal arrest of teens is up 150% according to the US Bureau of Census; illegal drug activity is up 6000% according to the National Institute of Drug Abuse; teen suicides in ages 15-19 years up 450% according to the National Center of Health Services and SAT scores fell 10% even though in time, SAT questions have been made easier to answer.\n\nThe Apostle Paul said in Colossians 2:8, “Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.” Friend, do not be spoiled by these dangerous atheistic philosophies but wash your mind daily with the word of God and stay rooted in Christ.\n\nRelated Keyword searches:"
