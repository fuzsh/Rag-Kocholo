        "text": "This book provides a wide-ranging, systematic, and comprehensive approach to the moral philosophy of John Dewey, one of the most important philosophers of the 20th century. It does so by focusing on his greatest achievement in this field: the Ethics he jointly published with James Hayden Tufts in 1908 and then republished in a heavily revised version in 1932. The chapters in this volume are divided into two distinct parts. The first features chapters that provide a running commentary on the chapters of the 1932 Ethics written by Dewey. Each chapter is introduced, situated within a historical perspective, and then its main achievements are highlighted and discussed. The second part of the book interprets the Ethics and demonstrates its contemporary relevance and vitality. The chapters in this part situate the Ethics in the broader interpretive frameworks of Dewey's philosophy, American pragmatism, and 20th-century moral theory at large. Taken together, these chapters show that, far from being a mere survey of moral theories, the 1932 Ethics presents the theoretical highpoint in Dewey's thinking about moral philosophy. This book features contributions by some of the most influential Dewey scholars from North America and Europe. It will be of keen interest to scholars and students of American pragmatism, ethics and moral philosophy, and the history of 20th-century philosophy. Roberto Frega holds a PhD from Paris 8. He is Permanent Researcher at is Professor in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Massachusetts Boston. He has recently published a book entitled Pragmatism, Objectivity, and Experience, and he has published a wide variety of article on classical and contemporary pragmatism.\n\nThe sense of 'Moral Education' has been declining…, and as such, John Dewey contents that it is still necessary to teach 'moral' (not in the dogmatic sense) in order to cultivate the minds of all students. The teaching of morals helps to create a sense of community, integrity, knowledge, power, and personal satisfaction and security within a student. The student learns to cultivate his or her own beliefs about the world, the community, his or her peers etc. as Dewey touches on his books, Human Nature and Conduct (1922) and The Moral Principles in Education (1922) published respectively. However, the moral aspect of education cannot be separated from the mimetic aspect, so it seems detrimental for students to try and pull the two apart. Dewey's views on moral education flow from his version of pragmatism. This work argues that that Dewey's pragmatism did not allow him develop a coherent theory of moral education. His rhetoric suggests that his position on moral education can be associated with virtue ethics, although he used conspicuously \"moral\" terms such as \"virtue\"and \"habits\" throughout his writings, this did not amount to a workable theory on moral education. Hence, virtue is all about cultivation of correct habits, which is deemed to be the primary concern of moral education. His views on habits and consequently on virtues, however, are inconsistent. This work sets to showcase that the discrepancies in Dewey's views on \"virtue\" are not due to a mere sloppiness in writing but rather due to his version of pragmatism.\n\nJohn Dewey (1859–1952) was a major figure of the American cultural and intellectual landscape in the first half of the twentieth century. While not the originator of American pragmatism, he was instrumental to its articulation as a philosophy and the spread of its influence beyond philosophy to other disciplines. His prolific writings encompass metaphysics, philosophy of mind, cognitive science, psychology, moral philosophy, the philosophies of religion, art, and education, and democratic political and international theory. The contributors to this Companion examine the wide range of Dewey&#39;s thought and provide a critical evaluation of his philosophy and its lasting influence, both elsewhere in philosophy and on other disciplines."
