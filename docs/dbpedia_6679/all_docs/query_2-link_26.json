        "text": "\"[Genetically Modified Organisms: A Scientific-Political Dialogue on a Meaningless Meme is] presents the debate associated with introducing GMOs as a traditional debate between science and progress against dogma. After reading it, I hope that science will win for the sake of all of us.\"\n\n- Professor David Zilberman, University of California at Berkeley\n\nThe myth of Prometheus has inspired countless generations of humanists throughout the ages. Prometheus -- who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humans to help them survive -- remains a symbol for those who reject theistic orthodoxies and who fearlessly challenge accepted beliefs. Artists such as Byron, Goethe, Beethoven and Wagner have been influenced by this story. Most importantly, Prometheus is a symbol for selfless love. In this collection of essays, the Promethean myth and its relationship to the philosophy of love is explored from its origins in Ancient Greece, to its similarities and contrasts with the figure of Christ. Special emphasis is given to the work and writings of Paul Kurtz, the foremost contemporary defender of humanism as a worldview, who has made the figure of Prometheus a special part of his own philosophy."
