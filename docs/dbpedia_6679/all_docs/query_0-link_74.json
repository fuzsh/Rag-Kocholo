        "text": "These are some of the things that Paul Kurtz, chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal and publisher of the magazine Skeptical Inquirer, does not believe in: parapsychology, holistic cures for animal illnesses, the universal effectiveness of chiropractic, extraterrestrial beings, alternative medicine, Bigfoot and organized religion.\n\nFor 35 years Mr. Kurtz has kept up a drumbeat of opposition to all kinds of this nonsense, as he calls it. And now he is turning his attention to the proliferation of the paranormal in movies and on television. Although movies are obviously fiction, Mr. Kurtz said, their power and influence are enormous. Meanwhile some television shows are presenting extraterrestrial conversations as a real thing.\n\n''The television networks are selling communication with the dead with abandon,'' Mr. Kurtz complained as he sat in the headquarters of the Center for Inquiry in Amherst, N.Y., near Buffalo, the secular humanist organization that is the umbrella group for all his interests. Mr. Kurtz pointed to John Edward's show, ''Crossing Over,'' and to James Van Praagh and George Anderson, mediums who also appear regularly on television claiming to talk to the dead.\n\nThen ''there are the increasing number of scenes in soap operas that are set in heaven,'' Mr. Kurtz said, adding that movies are also gross offenders. For instance, on Aug. 2, Touchstone is scheduled to release ''Signs,'' starring Mel Gibson, about the mysterious appearance of crop circles on a family farm. Another example is ''The Mothman Prophecies'' with Richard Gere, released in January, in which the characters are terrified by an otherworldly creature in the form of a giant moth."
