        "text": "December was more than half over and plans for the annual party for the staff at the Center for Inquiry had been set. Not a Christmas, Hanukkah or Kwanzaa party, mind you, but the party for the winter solstice, which arrived on Thursday, an occasion for giving presents, singing songs and collecting money for charity.\n\n''You get together and celebrate the changing of the season,'' said Paul Kurtz, the center's founder and chairman, explaining this alternative to holidays based on religion. Sitting not far from a display case containing original copies of ''The Age of Reason,'' Thomas Paine's famously harsh critique of the Bible, Mr. Kurtz continued: ''You have one life to live, you need to live it exuberantly. So we embrace the power of human values.''\n\nThere in a nutshell is the basis of Mr. Kurtz's philosophy, a system for thinking and acting that demands more than simply the rejection of a deity. ''I call it joyful creativity,'' said Mr. Kurtz, who at 75 is probably the country's leading secular humanist and skeptic.\n\nA philosopher by profession, he stands at the nexus of several institutions: he is the chairman of the nonprofit Council for Secular Humanism in Amherst, near Buffalo; he founded Prometheus Books, a publishing house; he edits the magazine Free Inquiry; and he publishes the scholarly journal Philo. All promote scientific rationalism as a way of life, an alternative to religious and postmodernist views, and Mr. Kurtz is often their public face.\n\nThese days such enterprises run against the cultural grain, and not only during the December holidays. In the last 30 years, diverse spiritual trends -- some profound, some superficial -- have taken hold even as many historic institutions of mainline Christianity have lost influence.\n\nIn the United States the growth of religious minorities like Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims has focused new attention on matters of faith. At the same time, evangelical Protestantism, with its megachurches, men's movements and mass market music, has entered the cultural mainstream. And there has been an increase in public interest in such topics as angels, alternative medicine, meditation and miracles.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
