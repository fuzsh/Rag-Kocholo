Daniel Fitzgibbons, a popular but mischievous student at a prestigious Catholic university, is summoned by Dean Malone to be interrogated about an alleged affair with Ms. Sevone, a young female professor. Fitzgibbons quickly turns the inquisition into a psychological chess match that threatens to reveal each man’s hidden secrets in this 1950’s period drama. Appearances can be deceiving, and deception will be critical if Daniel wants to save himself and his secret.
