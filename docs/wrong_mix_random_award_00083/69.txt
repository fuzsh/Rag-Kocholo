Girl Scouts of Greater Los Angeles is proud to announce that Montserrat H., has been selected to receive the 2024 GSUSA National Gold Award Scholarship!

The Girl Scouts of the USA Gold Award Scholarship recognizes one outstanding Gold Award Girl Scout per council who has demonstrated extraordinary leadership to drive lasting change in their community and beyond. Montserrat will be able to use the scholarship toward tuition, fees, books, and supplies required for coursework at accredited institutions in the United States to continue her education.

Montserrat’s Gold Award Project, "Lowering Surface Temperatures," tackled urban heating in low-income communities by advocating for environmental justice. She led volunteers in planting a native garden and painting a pathway to reduce temperatures, lowering the surface temperature by 10°F. Montserrat also educated the community through presentations and events, highlighting the importance of green spaces and clean air.

We’re so proud of you and can’t wait to see what more you accomplish, Montserrat!
