Los Angeles Film Awards (LAFA) is a monthly competition for filmmakers and screenwriters from all over the world. LAFA is the first festival to receive 400+ five-star reviews on FilmFreeway, out of over 8,000 film festivals.

Our mission is to promote films, and be another step up in the filmmakers' careers. Each month, our Jury will award the best films through private screenings, and make a special interview with the winner of the Best Picture award.

* All winners receive a free certificate (PDF/JPG file, ready for print).
