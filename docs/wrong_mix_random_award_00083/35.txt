Since 1982, the Los Angeles Conservancy has honored excellence in historic preservation through its annual Preservation Awards. The awards are selected by an independent jury of experts in architecture, historic preservation, and community development.

Award recipients range widely, from sensitive restoration, rehabilitation, and adaptive reuse projects, to groundbreaking advocacy and education efforts by individuals and groups.

In addition to the project awards, the Conservancy bestows a special Chairâ€™s Award for exceptional contributions. Though hardly comprehensive, our website contains profiles of a number of past Preservation Award recipients.
