Montserrat will be able to use the scholarship toward tuition, fees, books, and supplies required for coursework at accredited institutions in the United States to continue her education.\n\nMontserrat’s Gold Award Project, \"Lowering Surface Temperatures,\" tackled urban heating in low-income communities by advocating for environmental justice. She led volunteers in planting a native garden and painting a pathway to reduce temperatures, lowering the surface temperature by 10°F. Montserrat also educated the community through presentations and events, highlighting the importance of green spaces and clean air.\n\nWe’re so proud of you and can’t wait to see what more you accomplish, Montserrat!"
