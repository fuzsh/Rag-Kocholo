Enterprise Wireless Challenges Planning for Wireless Capacity  Do I have adequate DHCP IP addresses allocated to support the ever increasing number of wireless devices? Understanding BYOD’s Impact on Your Network Infrastructure  How many wireless devices are using the network today?  What does “normal” look like? Solving Performance Problems Faster  How much bandwidth is being consumed by wireless users?  And what are they doing?\n\n3. © SevOne, Inc. All Rights Reserved. At-A-Glance Wireless Status “How does my wireless infrastructure look right now?” Status Maps provide quick at-a-glance status with drill-down capability View service-related item status together such as Wireless Controllers, Access Points, WLAN SSIDs and DHCP Server status\n\n4. © SevOne, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Drill Down To See the Details “Is there a problem? What is causing my service delivery to degrade?” DHCP Status shows a severely degraded state. Drill down on the “DHCP Status” icon for details.\n\n5. © SevOne, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Drill Down To See the Details “Is there a problem? What is causing my service delivery to degrade?” A DHCP Subnet’s IP addresses is 100 percent exhausted! Drill into the DHCP Map to look further.\n\n6. © SevOne, Inc. All Rights Reserved. DHCP Status Click to investigate “Do I have a problem with more than one DHCP Subnet address range?” Several subnets report a saturated state! Did you know? SevOne baselines all of its performance indicators, allowing you to be alerted when performance deviates from normal.\n\n7. © SevOne, Inc. All Rights Reserved. DHCP Status “Do I have a problem with more than one DHCP Subnet address range?” Click on View Alerts to view all alerts for this DHCP Server\n\n8. © SevOne, Inc. All Rights Reserved. DHCP Status “Do I have a problem with more than one DHCP Subnet address range?” Fix It! Have DHCP Admin configure wireless subnets to support more available IP addresses.\n\n9. © SevOne, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Effects of BYOD on Your Wireless Infrastructure “How many devices are using the network today? How does this compare to ‘Normal’?” Hmmm… Client Device count for “SevOne-3” SSID seems a bit lighter than normal. Let’s take a closer look. TopN Reports help you quickly prioritize troubleshooting and capacity efforts.\n\n10. © SevOne, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Understand the Effects of BYOD on Network “How many devices are using the network today? How does this compare to ‘Normal’?” Click on the Gear to “Chain” to the trend data. Band of “Normal” performance Today’s Actual Last week – All days trending higher than normal Mean Why is today lighter than normal? Snow Day!\n\n11. © SevOne, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Understand the Effects of BYOD on Network “How are devices distributed across Access Points? How much traffic are they generating?” 44% of devices are using the Marketing AP Steady sustained traffic here. Developers streaming audio?\n\n12. © SevOne, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Gain Visibility With NetFlow Traffic Analysis “What are wireless users doing? How are they using the bandwidth?” Wireless traffic is down today due to the “Snow Day”. There are a few spikes. Let’s look at NetFlow.\n\n13. © SevOne, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Gain Visibility With NetFlow Traffic Analysis “What are wireless users doing? How are they using the bandwidth?” Click on the Gear to “Chain” to the NetFlow data. The top conversation constituted 27% of all traffic The top conversation was with a Google server (1e100.net). Perhaps a Google Hangout session?\n\n14. © SevOne, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Gain Wireless Performance Visibility with SevOne! Monitor All Wireless Infrastructure Components in One Place with One Solution  Monitor Wireless Controllers, Access Points, WLANs (SSID), DHCP Subnet Capacity, Wireless VLAN, NetFlow Traffic Analysis. Face the Unknown with Deviation from Baseline Alerting and Reporting  Detect when performance behaves abnormally or when resources near capacity. Go with the Flow  Understand how much bandwidth is being consumed by wireless users, and for what purpose."
