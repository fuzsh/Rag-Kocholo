        "text": "The California Endowment Youth Awards were created to celebrate the long-standing efforts and achievements of youth leaders and youth-allied non-profit organizations advancing health and racial equity. These California youth inspire their peers and communities while embodying the values of The California Endowment.\n\nThe awards are given in recognition of young leaders whose actions impact public policies, create innovative models of service, strengthen local institutions, and cultivate youth power.\n\nAcross the state, young people are leading from the frontlines, taking action, and advancing conversations to create lasting change that will lead to a more equitable and healthy future. The Youth Awards, created in 2018, recognize and celebrate the young changemakers and youth-allied organizations that have made a tremendous impact on improving the health of their communities and across California.\n\nVoices For Change Award\n\nThe Voices for Change Award celebrates the transformative leadership of youth who are achieving racial and health equity through people power. Four youth, one per region, who have done exceptional work in the area of health, justice reform, schools, and inclusive community development will be selected as a recipient.\n\nFour award recipients will receive $3,000 each.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nYouth Power Partner Awards\n\nThe Youth Power Partner Award celebrates non-profit organizations who are cultivating pathways for youth power. The organization selected can be a youth-led advocacy organization or an adult ally-led organization supporting youth voice and power.\n\nFour non-profit organizations will each receive $10,000.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nBrandon Harrison Youth Visionary Award\n\nThe Brandon Harrison Youth Visionary Award recognizes an exceptional young person who has overcome challenges and obstacles to battle back from trauma and place themselves and their community on a path toward success. Brandon Harrison was a youth activist from Stockton, California who was a member of TCE’s President’s Youth Council. In his memory and legacy, this award celebrates young activists who are carrying on the fight for health and racial justice.\n\nOne award recipient will receive $10,000.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nWindow to nominate\n\nOctober 25, 2023 —\n\nJanuary 12, 2024 (11:59pm PST)\n\nTo ensure your nominee is considered for the Youth Awards, your entry form must be complete in every section and adhere to the rules listed.\n\nReviewing each nomination is a Selection Committee comprised of California youth leaders participating in a social change philanthropy initiative. The Selection Committee will follow a standardized judging process. In early June 2024, we’ll be announcing the winners. Applying for the Youth Awards will require a commitment from the nominator to follow nomination instructions and complete each section of the entry form. Multiple nominations will not be accepted, so we encourage nominators to align and collaborate on submitting one nomination."
