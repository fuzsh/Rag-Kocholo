        "text": "Longtime KTLA entertainment reporter Sam Rubin is set to posthumously receive a Los Angeles area Emmy Governors Award, the Television Academy said Tuesday.\n\nRubin, who worked on KTLA-TV’s morning show since 1991, died on May 10. He was 64.\n\n“Sam was a trailblazer, a pioneer in the modern age of television news. His contributions to entertainment journalism in Los Angeles and around the world are unmatched,” Cris Abrego, chair of the Television Academy, said in a statement about recognizing Rubin for celebrated career.\n\nIn the Los Angeles TV market, Rubin reported from many local red carpets in addition to his role as the face of showbiz on Channel 5. He often hosted the station’s Live From the Academy Awards and had his own celebrity talk show, Hollywood Uncensored, for a time.\n\nThe posthumous Television Academy honor follows others that Rubin received, including numerous Los Angeles Area Emmy Awards, a Golden Mike Award from the Radio and Television News Association of Southern California, and he was named best entertainment reporter by the Los Angeles Press Club.\n\nIn 2013, he was honored by the National Hispanic Media Coalition with its Impact Award for integrity in broadcast journalism.\n\nRubin often appeared on BBC television and radio and was a regular contributor to Australia’s Triple M radio and Channel 9. And he owned a television production company, SRE Inc., which produced more than 200 hours of broadcast and cable programs, including several of his Live From red carpet shows and Hollywood Uncensored appearances.\n\nThe Los Angeles Area Governors Award will be presented during the 76th Los Angeles Area Emmy Awards on July 27, 2024, at the Four Seasons Beverly Wilshire."
