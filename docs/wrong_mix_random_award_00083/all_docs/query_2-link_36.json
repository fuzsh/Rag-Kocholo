        "text": "Siegfried's New Hire Orientation program introduces professionals to its extraordinary culture, compelling business strategy and interesting work. During the three-day event, new employees learn more about the company, meet members of Siegfried's Leadership and Operations teams, and become acquainted with fellow Professional Resources. Notably, all new employees have the opportunity to meet with Rob Siegfried, Founder and CEO, about Siegfried's higher purpose: We help People become better Leaders to exponentially improve their Lives.\n\nA welcome reception was held at the Bellevue's Conservatory and the group also dined at Butcher & Singer. The event concluded with an outing to Lucky Strike bowling alley.\n\nSiegfried is excited to welcome Cassandra Essick, Kristen Flores, Rob Goldfarb, Sami Greenberg, and Stephanie Simone to its National Market Leadership team.\n\nCassandra Essick\n\nCassandra joined the Los Angeles Market as a Market Associate. Before this, she gained nearly 15 years of experience in mortgage, credit analysis, and property management. She earned her Bachelor of Science in exercise science with a concentration in business from the University of Delaware. Being drawn to warm weather, she relocated across the country to Southern California soon after she graduated.\n\nPositive and personable, Cassandra enjoys planning and arranging everything. \"I joined Siegfried because its Professionals are passionately ambitious and the Firm puts a lot of emphasis on learning and building quality connections,\" she said.\n\nCassandra loves to spend time with her husband and her 10-year-old son. An athlete, she enjoys running 10Ks and half marathons — she recently ran the LA Marathon! She also loves football and looks forward to attending Philadelphia Eagles, UCLA, and USC games.\n\nKristen Flores\n\nKristen joins the Los Angeles Market as a Market Associate. Before joining Siegfried, she gained valuable experience at the entertainment empires of the Walt Disney Company and DreamWorks Animation — somewhat normal for a Los Angeles native. She earned her bachelor's degree in business administration from Pepperdine University.\n\nAs a result of working in several creative departments, Kristen has developed an innovative and resilient work ethic that will propel her forward in her new position. \"I was able to visualize my future at Siegfried because of the freedom they give to explore purposeful opportunities within my own network and within their network,\" she said.\n\nSince she was seven years old, Kristen has raced dirt bikes and she continues to ride with her brother and father. One of her favorite things to do is watch the Disneyland fireworks in front of the Magic Castle with an ice cream cone in hand.\n\nRob Goldfarb\n\nRob joins the Boston Market as a Market Associate. He earned his Bachelor of Science in finance and marketing from the University of Delaware. Before coming to Siegfried, he gained valuable experience at an IAC subsidiary, Mindspark, and a performance monitoring company, SevOne.\n\n\"Joining Siegfried was the best decision I could make,\" said Rob. \"They invest a lot in their Professionals and it's very rare to find a company that cares about personal and professional development equally.\"\n\nOriginally from the suburbs of New York, Rob recently moved to Boston and looks forward to creating a new network and exploring the city. He's currently seeking recommendations for both touristy and non-touristy activities. In his spare time, Rob enjoys watching and playing sports, all things HBO, and traveling — this year, he's already been to Italy, France, the Netherlands, and Israel. For his next trip, he has his eyes set on Eastern Europe.\n\nSami Greenberg\n\nSami joins the South Florida Market as a Market Associate. Born and raised in Miami, Florida, Sami attended the University of Miami and Florida International University, earning her Bachelor of Arts in interdisciplinary studies (business track) with a minor in hospitality. She went on to receive her Florida Real Estate License and most recently held a role as a Realtor with EWM International Realty.\n\nHard-working, personable and detail-oriented, Sami looks forward to her new position because it's client-facing and it \"provides excellent resources, mentorship and leadership development opportunities.\"\n\nSami does CrossFit five times a week and loves it.\n\nStephanie Simone\n\nStephanie joins the New York Metro Market as a Market Associate after earning her Bachelor of Science in economics and her Master of Business Administration from Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Connecticut.\n\n\"I connected with Siegfried's Professionals almost immediately. There is unconditional support and so many opportunities for professional and personal growth. I also love the entrepreneurial environment that Rob Siegfried [Founder and CEO] has established,\" she said.\n\nIn her spare time, Stephanie loves to travel, read, and spend time with her family.\n\nFor more information about a career at Siegfried, please visit siegfriedcareers.com.\n\nAbout The Siegfried Group, LLP\n\nThe Siegfried Group, LLP (Siegfried) is a leading, national CPA firm that helps executives with Effective Leadership and Successful Execution, through leadership advisory and talent delivery services, to better ensure that our clients are \"Doing the Right Things, Right.\" We help People become better Leaders to exponentially improve their Lives.\n\nContact:\n\nKaren S.
