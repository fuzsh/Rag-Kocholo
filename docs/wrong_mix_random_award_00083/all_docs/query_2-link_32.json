        "text": ">> 2013 Winter Film Awards Official Selections\n\nUnited States / Short Film /\n\n14 minutes / English\n\nDirector: Vincent DeLuca\n\nProducer: Ethan Downing\n\nDaniel Fitzgibbons, a popular but mischievous student at a prestigious Catholic university, is summoned by Dean Malone to be interrogated about an alleged affair with Ms. Sevone, a young female professor. Fitzgibbons quickly turns the inquisition into a psychological chess match that threatens to reveal each man’s hidden secrets in this 1950’s period drama. Appearances can be deceiving, and deception will be critical if Daniel wants to save himself and his secret.\n\nOFFICIAL SELECTION, 2013 Queens World Film Festival — OFFICIAL SELECTION, 2013 NYC Downtown Short Film Festival — AWARD OF MERIT, 2012 Best Shorts Competition\n\nVincent DeLuca is the writer, director and producer of numerous narrative and documentary films. He has filmed in places near and far, including Los Angeles, New York, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Istanbul, and Kampala. The connective tissue linking each of these stories is Vincent’s passion for cinematic history and his desire to capture the beauty of the underdog’s story. Vincent regularly collaborates with his supremely intelligent creative partner, Ethan Downing, and his muse, Tod Engle."
