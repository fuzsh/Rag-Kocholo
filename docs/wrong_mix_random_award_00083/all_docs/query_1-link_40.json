The banking public and the general community are both entitled to know whether the item of cash in vault which in this week's return aggregates $112,046,000 is, in its ralation to the general banking system, an asset or a liability, and we wish to register a vigorous protest at the taking of a step which means the denial of such knowledge.

The disclosures before a Congressional committee in Washington regarding alleged conditions and practices in that country are anything but reassuring to the nations that are working hard on plans to bring a reasonable degree of order out of the unspeakable chaos that has existed practically ever since the overthrow of the old Government. On Wednesday it was stated in Paris that George D. Herron had arrived there from Geneva for a conference with William Allen White, his American colleague on the commission appointed to meet the Russian delegates at the Princes' Islands. While no definite announcement was made of plans for the meeting, it was believed that if eventually that conference would have to be abandoned some other arrangement would be made for talking over the situation with representatives of the various Russian governments either individually or collectively.

On the London Stock Exchange, where prices were well maintained in spite of the labor troubles, there was renewed discussion of the advisability of permitting transactions on time again and not restricting business absolutely to a cash basis. Ultra-conservatives held that the change should not be made until certain large pre-war contracts, which show heavy losses, are liquidated.

The best established fact is that the banks are putting out very little money on time, proposing to be well fortified against the demands that may be made upon them in connection with the Government financing. For this reason it seems perfectly safe to assume that while the stock market has been comparatively active this week, it will not be permitted to go far enough to tie up a large amount of funds that will be needed by the Government for financing its requirements as a result of the war and for helping those nations with whom we are associated. We are beginning to come to a better realization of what the war has cost the world and will cost, and of the difficulties that are likely to be encountered in securing money with which to pay for it all and to have something left over for reconstruction purposes. The fact cannot be emphasized too strongly that the United States will have to contribute a big share toward the enormous total which will be needed. Dealing specifically with rates for money, call loans this week have again covered a range of 432 Â®6%. Monday 5% was the high and also for renewals with 432% the low. On Tuesday, while renewals were still negotiated at 5%, there was an advance to 532%, with 5% the lowest for the day. Wednesday's range was 5 Â® 6% and 5% again the ruling rate. On Thursday the maximum remained at 6% although renewals were marked up to 53/2%, and this was also the minimum. Friday 53/2% was the highest, 43/2% the low and 53/2% still the renewal basis. The figures here given are for loans based on mixed collateral. \"All-industrials\" continue to be The trend of rates on both call and time loans was quoted at IA of 1% above this range.

Reserves in other depositaries (State banks and trust companies) expanded $220,000, to $11,504,000. Aggregate reserves registered a gain of $15,076,000, and this brought the total up to $555,193,000, which compares with $509,259,000 in the same week of 1918. Surplus increased $15,013,760, and now stands at $52,415,480, as contrasted with $29,251,200 a year ago. The above totals are on the basis in both instances of reserves of 13% for member banks of the Federal Reserve system but not including cash held by these banks, which last Saturday amounted to $97,472,000. Reserve requirements this week showed only a nominal change, having been increased $62,240. Because of the holiday to-day this week's statement was issued yesterday afternoon. The most striking changes, in comparison with last Saturday's returns, were an increase of $50,958,000 in loans and discounts and an expansion of $23,964,000 in net demand deposits. The final result was a decrease in surplus of $2,928,690, which is now $36,734,190. FEB. 22 1919.1 THE CHRONICLE DISCOUNT RATES OF FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS 711 New York.

THE PLAN FOR A LEAGUE OF NATIONS We imagine that if the draft of the League of Nations covenant, as signed by the delegates at Paris and made public on Friday of last week, had been agreed upon and given out in the earliest stages of the conferenceâ€”along with the first thrill of victory and of rejoicing at the end of warâ€”the mere fact of its adoption would have evoked almost unanimous enthusiasm. This was not possible. Long discussion [VoL. 108. was necessary, the purport of which was made known to the outside world. There was disagreement between the delegates at Paris on some points; obvious compromise on others; and all this was followed by the general public step by step. The result has been, first that publication of the completed draft was in no way a surprise; next that theâ€¢voice of doubt and criticism was strengthened by the differences of opinion which had already developed in the Conference itself. That was inevitable, and would have been inevitable in the case of any such agreement. The histories tell us that, while the completion and publication of the draft of our own Constitution in 1787 was greeted in some cities by public rejoicings and ringing of church bells, in others it was received with jealousy and suspicion. Several of the States, in fact, refused for two or three years to sign and ratify the instrument. The objection raised by these recalcitrant States was partly that the Constitution was a bundle of compromises which would satisfy nobody, but chiefly that they were being asked to sign away their political rights and privileges as sovereign States. In this regard, the objections and criticisms already directed against the League of Nations plan as formulated bear a close resemblance. Dissatisfaction over the proposal that the prerogatives of one Government might be overridden through a combination of other Governments, was necessarily the first instinct of opposition on each occasion. In previous plans for an international world league, this sentiment has always been the insurmountable obstacle. Only the existing political chaos in the American States of 1787, and the shadow of approaching anarchy, made ratification of the Constitution politically possible. We have now to see just what effect the disastrous experiences of the European war will have on the discussion of the League of Nations plan when the legislatures are asked to ratify it. The articles in the covenant at Paris are not in the nature of a binding code of rules and procedure. They are in some places admittedly vague, in all places elastic, in many incomplete. Probably it would be fair to regard the document as it stands rather as a general outline or sketch; the first formal step in a world confederation for certain specified purposes; an agreement whose provisions would be supplemented and enlarged as the test of practical experience should give occasion and opportunity. In its present form the covenant is hardly more than a framework. Its purpose, however, as declared in its preamble, is all-embracing: \"In order to promote international co-operation and to secure international peace and security by the acceptance of obligations not to resort to war, by the prescription of open, just and honorable relations between nations, by the firm establishment of the understandings of international law as the actual rule of conduct among Governments, and by the maintenance of justice and a scrupulous respect for all treaty obligations in the dealings of organized people with one another, the Powers signatory to this covenant adopt this constitution.\" Expctly what would the signatory States surrender of their independent powers under this agreement, and to just how much in the way of co-operative action affecting other Governments would they commit themselves? These are the crucial questions. Article XI sets forth that \"any war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of the high con- FEB. 22 1919.] THE CHRONICLE 713 tracting parties or not, is hereby declared a matter organization which was not yet formed would itself of concern to the League.\" They therefore (Article be contrary to ordinary prudence.
