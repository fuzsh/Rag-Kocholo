I'm trying to buy memoirs of WW2 German aces. I already bought memoirs of Adolf Galland, Walter Schuck and Helmut Lipfert, and ordered Hans-Ekkehard bob.(These books already translated to English.) And also I bought "The German Aces Speak I, II", "The Me262 Strombird" and some other books few years ago. I think I have to buy some none-translated German books(Maybe someone who have interest about this will translate for me. hehe.). So I made some list.

Falkenjahre - Wolfgang Falck

Feindberührungen - Julius Meimberg

Unbekannte Pflicht - Walter Wolfrum

Walter Krupinski - Walter Krupinski

Gefechtsbericht - Günther Josten

Die Fährte des Jägers - Adolf Dickfeld

Kriegstagebuch von Hannes Trautloft - Hannes Trautloft

Rammjäger - Walther Dahl

Nächte im Bomberstrom - Paul Zorner

Sand und Feuer - Martin Drewes

Am Himmel Europas - Günther Scholz

Der Jagdflieger Viktor Petermann - Viktor Petermann

Wir kämpften in einsamen Höhen - Peter Düttmann

Wo wir sind ist immer oben - Heinz Ewald

If somebody who know any memoirs or interview books not in the list, please notice me. Especially, I cannot find any books about Ernst-Wilhelm Reinert. He was great fighter pilot in both front and rejoined to Bundeswehr luftwaffe after war. I cannot understand why I couldn't find any book about him.

In English:

'The Last Battle' , Peter Henn gives a German view of the MTO. Henn was Alfons Schertl.

'Spitfire on my Tail', Ulrich Steinhilper

You didn't mention 'Jagdgeschwader 301/302' by the recently deceased Willi Reschke.

I'll try to think of some more.

I notice you have some of the worst memoirs/biogs ever written in your list. The Hartmann and Rudel books go without saying, but Dahl's 'Rammjager' must be up there along with some of the others

Cheers

Steve
