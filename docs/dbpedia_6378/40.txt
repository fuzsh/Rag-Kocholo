Peter D端ttmann was one of the later arrivals to JG 52, joining the Group in May of 1943 just a few weeks before his twentieth birthday. He quickly found his footing and was credited with his first victory, a Polikarpov Po-2 biplane, on 21MAY43. He was an aggressive pilot who scored steadily, but was himself shot down several times, including three times in one day on 23JAN44. His best day was on 07MAY44 when he was credited with nine aerial victories during two sorties.

D端ttmann survived the war and was credited with a total of 152 victories. Although he himself was shot down several times, he always managed to evade capture and walk back to German lines. Peter D端ttmann survived the war and passed away in January 2001.
