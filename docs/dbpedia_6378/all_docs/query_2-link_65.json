        "text": "Sense of Okayness (SOK) is an emerging concept that describes a person’s ability to remain stable and unshaken in the face of life transitions and hardships. This quality enables effective stress regulation and heightened tolerance to uncertainty. To investigate the possible role of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) in mediating the relationship between SOK and stress regulation among older individuals, an analytical sample of N = 69 participants (74% women) with a mean age of 78.75 years (SD age = 6.78) was recruited for a standardized cognitive assessment and stress induction. Baseline heart rate variability (HRV), measured via electrocardiogram (ECG), and SOK assessments were conducted prior to stress induction, along with a baseline cognitive evaluation. Subsequently, participants were subjected to a psychosocial stress paradigm, followed by either a 30-minute SOK elevation intervention (n = 40) or a control condition with nature sounds (n = 29). A second cognitive assessment was administered post-intervention, with continuous HRV measurement through ECG. The results revealed significant HRV changes due to the experimental intervention, though no significant differences were observed between the SOK intervention and control groups. Interestingly, individuals with high trait SOK displayed more stable HRV trajectories, exhibiting a smaller decline during the stress intervention and a milder increase during both the stressor and SOK intervention phases. Overall, these findings do suggest a significant association between SOK, parasympathetic activity, and stress reactivity. These results prompt further investigation into whether personality patterns, such as a strong SOK, may be linked to reduced vagal reactivity and better coping in old age.\n\nMisrepresentation of peer behavior has often been observed in college students and may lead to over‐expression of alcohol consumption and under‐expression of studying. While social norm feedback approaches have had mixed success in addressing these misrepresentations and altering behavior, they may have been too unspecific to be effective and did not directly assess individual perception accuracy. We thus investigated how specific, one‐time feedback on the behavioral distribution of alcohol consumption or study time of a clearly defined, individually‐adjusted social circle would affect the respective norm estimations and behavior of a class of Psychology students ( n = 89 in January) across their first year of study. Students overestimated alcohol consumption and partially underestimated studying norms. While social circle feedback on alcohol consumption did not clearly affect both individual estimation accuracy and alcohol consumption, feedback on peers' studying time increased studying with no clear effect on estimation accuracy. This indicates that social circle norm feedback may be suitable to evoke behavioral effects. The correction of the detected inaccuracies did not appear to be a precondition for the feedback to be effective.\n\nWe propose to use optimally ordered orthogonal neighbor-joining (O 3 NJ) trees as a new way to visually explore cluster structures and outliers in multi-dimensional data. Neighbor-joining (NJ) trees are widely used in biology, and their visual representation is similar to that of dendrograms. The core difference to dendrograms, however, is that NJ trees correctly encode distances between data points, resulting in trees with varying edge lengths. We optimize NJ trees for their use in visual analysis in two ways. First, we propose to use a novel leaf sorting algorithm that helps users to better interpret adjacencies and proximities within such a tree. Second, we provide a new method to visually distill the cluster tree from an ordered NJ tree. Numerical evaluation and three case studies illustrate the benefits of this approach for exploring multi-dimensional data in areas such as biology or image analysis.\n\nResource quality is an important concept in ecology and evolution that attempts to capture the fitness benefits a resource affords to an organism. Yet “quality” is a multivariate concept, potentially affected by many variables pertaining to the resource, its surroundings, and the resource chooser. Researchers often use a small number of proxy variables to simplify their estimation of resource quality, but without vetting their proxies against a wider set of potential quality estimators this approach risks overlooking potentially important characteristics that can explain patterns of resource use in their study systems. Here we used Neolamprologus multifasciatus , a group‐living cichlid fish that utilizes empty snail shells as shelter resources, to examine how shells were used by, and partitioned among, group members in relation to a range of attributes, including shell size, intactness, texture, spatial position, and usage by heterospecifics. This approach generated a comprehensive picture of what characteristics contribute to the attractiveness and quality of each shell resource, confirming the importance of two previously proposed shell characteristics, size and intactness, but highlighting the influences of other unexplored variables, including shell spatial position and usage by heterospecifics. We also present a generally applicable “resource attractiveness index” as a means to estimate resource quality based on resource choice data. This index incorporates information from any number of resource characteristics and is of particular use when researchers wish to quantify resource value, but many characteristics jointly contribute to the value and attractiveness of the resource.\n\nThe soundscape experienced by animals early in life can affect their behaviour later in life. For birds, sounds experienced in the egg can influence how individuals learn to respond to specific calls post-hatching. However, how early acoustic experiences affect subsequent social behaviour remains unknown. Here, we investigate how exposure to maternal ‘cluck’ calls pre-hatching affects the behaviour of domestic chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) at 3–5 days and 17–21 days old. We incubated eggs and played cluck calls to half of them. After hatching, we raised chicks in small groups occupying different enclosures. At 3–5 days old, we tested chicks’ responses to three stimuli: (i) background sound, (ii) chick calls and (iii) cluck calls. We found that the pre-hatching experience of cluck calls reduced the likelihood of moving in response to all three stimuli. At 17–21 days old, some chicks explored beyond their own enclosure and ‘visited’ other groups. Chicks exposed to cluck calls before hatching were three times more likely to enter another group’s enclosure than control chicks, and this was unaffected by the chicks’ social connectedness. Our results indicate age- and context-dependent responses of chicks to pre-hatching cluck-call playbacks, with potential long-term effects on individual social behaviour.\n\nAnimal behaviour is often modelled as networks, where, for example, the nodes are individuals of a group and the edges represent behaviour within this group. Different types of behaviours or behavioural categories are then modelled as different yet connected networks which form a multilayer network. Recent developments show the potential and benefit of multilayer networks for animal behaviour research as well as the potential benefit of stereoscopic 3D immersive environments for the interactive visualisation, exploration and analysis of animal behaviour multilayer networks. However, so far animal behaviour research is mainly supported by libraries or software on 2D desktops. Here, we explore the domain-specific requirements for (stereoscopic) 3D environments. Based on those requirements, we provide a proof of concept to visualise, explore and analyse animal behaviour multilayer networks in immersive environments.\n\nEnvironmental conditions change constantly either by anthropogenic perturbation or naturally across space and time. Often, a change in behavior is the first response to changing conditions. Behavioral flexibility can potentially improve an organism’s chances to survive and reproduce. Currently, we lack an understanding on the time-scale such behavioral adjustments need, how they actually affect reproduction and survival and whether behavioral adjustments are sufficient in keeping up with changing conditions. We used house mice (Mus musculus) to test whether personality and life-history traits can adjust to an experimentally induced food-switch flexibly in adulthood or by intergenerational plasticity, that is, adjustments only becoming visible in the offspring generation. Mice lived in 6 experimental populations of semi-natural environments either on high or standard quality food for 4 generations. We showed previously that high-quality food induced better conditions and a less risk-prone personality. Here, we tested whether the speed and/ or magnitude of adjustment shows condition-dependency and whether adjustments incur fitness effects. Life-history but not personality traits reacted flexibly to a food-switch, primarily by a direct reduction of reproduction and slowed-down growth. Offspring whose parents received a food-switch developed a more active stress-coping personality and gained weight at a slower rate compared with their respective controls. Furthermore, the modulation of most traits was condition-dependent, with animals previously fed with high-quality food showing stronger responses. Our study highlights that life-history and personality traits adjust at different speed toward environmental change, thus, highlighting the importance of the environment and the mode of response for evolutionary models.\n\nWe present a method for the layout of anatomical structures and blood vessels based on information from the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA). Our approach integrates a novel vascular layout into the hierarchical treemap representation of anatomy as used in ApiNATOMY. Our method aims to improve the comprehension of complex anatomical and vascular data by providing readable visual representations. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through a prototype developed in VANTED, showing potential for application in research, education, and clinical settings.\n\nAnimal vocal communication research traditionally focuses on acoustic and contextual features of calls, yet substantial information is also contained in response selectivity and timing during vocalization events. By examining the spatiotemporal structure of vocal interactions, we can distinguish between ‘broadcast’ and ‘exchange’ signalling modes, with the former potentially serving to transmit signallers’ general state and the latter reflecting more interactive signalling behaviour. Here, we tracked the movements and vocalizations of wild meerkat (Suricata suricatta) groups simultaneously using collars to explore this distinction. We found evidence that close calls (used for maintaining group cohesion) are given as signal exchanges. They are typically given in temporally structured call–response sequences and are also strongly affected by the social environment, with individuals calling more when they have more neighbours and juveniles responding more to adults than the reverse. In contrast, short note calls appear mainly in sequences produced by single individuals and show little dependence on social surroundings, suggesting a broadcast signalling mode. Despite these differences, both call categories show similar clustering in space and time at a group level. Our results highlight how the fine-scale structure of vocal interactions can give important insights into the usage and function of signals in social groups. This article is part of the theme issue ‘The power of sound: unravelling how acoustic communication shapes group dynamics.'\n\nThe olfactory system is an ideal and tractable system for exploring how the brain transforms sensory inputs into behaviour. The basic tasks of any olfactory system include\n\nodour detection, discrimination and categorization. The challenge for the olfactory system is to transform the high-dimensional space of olfactory stimuli into the much smaller space of perceived objects and valence that endows odours with meaning. Our current understanding of how neural circuits address this challenge has come primarily from observations of the mechanisms of the brain for processing other sensory modalities, such as vision and hearing, in which optimized deep hierarchical circuits are used\n\nto extract sensory features that vary along continuous physical dimensions. The olfactory system, by contrast, contends with an ill-defined, high-dimensional stimulus space and discrete stimuli using a circuit architecture that is shallow and parallelized. Here, we present recent observations in vertebrate and invertebrate systems that relate the statistical structure and state-dependent modulation of olfactory codes to mechanisms of perception and odour-guided behaviour.\n\nIn this paper, we propose the t-FDP model, a force-directed placement method based on a novel bounded short-range force (t-force) defined by Student’s t-distribution. Our formulation is flexible, exerts limited repulsive forces for nearby nodes and can be adapted separately in its short- and long-range effects. Using such forces in force-directed graph layouts yields better neighborhood preservation than current methods, while maintaining low stress errors. Our efficient implementation using a Fast Fourier Transform is one order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods and two orders faster on the GPU, enabling us to perform parameter tuning by globally and locally adjusting the t-force in real-time for complex graphs. We demonstrate the quality of our approach by numerical evaluation against state-of-the-art approaches and extensions for interactive exploration.\n\nCooperative breeding occurs when individuals contribute parental care to offspring that are not their own. Numerous intra- and interspecific studies have aimed to explain the evolution of this behavior. Recent comparative work suggests that family living (i.e., when offspring remain with their parents beyond independence) is a critical stepping stone in the evolution of cooperative breeding. Thus, it is key to understand the factors that facilitate the evolution of family living. Within-species studies suggest that protection from predators is a critical function of group living, through both passive benefits such as dilution effects and active benefits such as prosocial antipredator behaviors in family groups. However, the association between predation risk and the formation and prevalence of family groups and cooperative breeding remains untested globally. Here, we use phylogenetic comparative analyses including 2,984 bird species to show that family living and cooperative breeding are associated with increased occurrence of avian predators. These cross-species findings lend support to previous suggestions based on intraspecific studies that social benefits of family living, such as protection against predation, could favor the evolution of delayed dispersal and cooperative breeding.\n\nRecent advances in calcium imaging, including the development of fast and sensitive genetically encoded indicators, high-resolution camera chips for wide-field imaging, and resonant scanning mirrors in laser scanning microscopy, have notably improved the temporal and spatial resolution of functional imaging analysis. Nonetheless, the variability of imaging approaches and brain structures challenges the development of versatile and reliable segmentation methods. Standard techniques, such as manual selection of regions of interest or machine learning solutions, often fall short due to either user bias, non-transferability among systems, or computational demand. To overcome these issues, we developed CalciSeg, a data-driven and reproducible approach for unsupervised functional calcium imaging data segmentation. CalciSeg addresses the challenges associated with brain structure variability and user bias by offering a computationally efficient solution for automatic image segmentation based on two parameters: regions’ size limits and number of refinement iterations. We evaluated CalciSeg efficacy on datasets of varied complexity, different insect species (locusts, bees, and cockroaches), and imaging systems (wide-field, confocal, and multiphoton), showing the robustness and generality of our approach. Finally, the user-friendly nature and the open-source availability of CalciSeg facilitate the integration of this algorithm into existing analysis pipelines."
