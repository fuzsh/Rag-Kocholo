Nation-states are struggling. Climate change, biodiversity loss, surging inequality, and refugee crises – these global challenges demand new solutions. But what if there was another way? Enter virtual states: a game-changing idea redefining governance for the digital age. Imagine a community united not by borders, but by shared values and goals. Imagine digital democracies where every voice counts, and transparency reigns supreme. Imagine a network sharing its public resources for the impact and common benefit of its members. That's the vision of virtual states. Could virtual states help us solve challenges of the future? * Virtual states could tackle global problems: From climate action to refugee support, virtual communities can create & coordinate innovative solutions for the whole world. * Digital governance could produce real democracies: In the age of AI and blockchain, the digital governance can achieve an unparalleled level of transparency, openness, and inclusion, allowing every voice to be heard in every essential decision. * Virtual citizenship could become the membership with benefits: Virtual states can only be based on voluntary participation, and so they will seek to create many opportunities for those who join, from freedom of movement to universal basic income. * Designing states could become a lifetime career or a business opportunity: For young people or seasoned social innovators, this is a chance to be a pioneer in shaping a new model of governance. Here's what you'll get: * Learn from the brightest minds in virtual state governance, including: Patri Friedman (Founder of the Seasteading Institute), Mark Lutter (Executive Chairman of the Charter Cities Institute), Thomas Thomison (Creator of Holacracy and Founder of PowerShift), Maurice Crespi (CEO Virtual Nation Builders), George Pór (Founder of FutureHOW), Vahram Ayvazyan (Panarmenian Network State), Alex Tveit (CEO, Sustainable Impact Foundation). * Understanding the transformation of governance, explore the practicalities of building virtual states, and participate in open discussions. * Shape the conversation. Your voice matters - help us define the role of virtual states in the future. Join this inspiring & groundbreaking conversation!

With algorithms, media, and politicians all working to divide us and pushing us to demonize each other - it’s only the uniters and builders who can prevent our societies from falling apart into the kind of hell we’ve seen too much of in the 20th century. Destruction is always a part of creation But making always involves remaking. It seems a fact of nature that the universe evolves through these twin forces of creation and destruction: The Law of Entropy basically says that the amount of disorder in any system is always increasing. This is physics. But I think there is a corollary, let’s call it The Law of Syntropy, which says that the patterns that survive and flourish in this chaotic dance are the ones that are good at creating internal harmony by either exporting, countering, or recycling that increasing disorder. At every step of unfolding — atoms to molecules, molecules to cells, cells to complex organisms, complex organisms to species and ecosystems—a new sphere of action emerged out of entropy. At first, it is very chaotic. But over time, it harmonizes and reaches equilibrium, in the process giving birth to another new sphere. Over time, the newly arrived predators learned not to overfeed, leaving healthy populations of prey so that they could continue eating in the future - thus ecosystems were born. Most human societies eventually learned that limiting people to persuasion and eschewing violence works better in the long term - thus laws were born. Most nations have learned that a policy of conquest as a means of achieving desired resources usually backfires - thus the modern international order was born.

It’s about embracing the challenge of mutual understanding, where we can use Western scientific methodologies to validate and appreciate traditional knowledge in a way that resonates with non-Indigenous people and agencies. This approach fosters an environment of collaboration and respect, bridging diverse viewpoints toward common goals.” At #Inventures2024, we had the immense honor of sitting down with Carol Wildcat, Consultation Director at Ermineskin Cree Nation to discuss how the partnership between NAIT Applied Research and Ermineskin Cree Nation seeks to marry traditional Indigenous knowledge and worldviews with Western science. Our Applied Research and Continuing Education partnerships with Indigenous communities always seeks to find that critical balance, and to put our partners in charge of the project, allowing us to walk beside them to find meaningful success.
