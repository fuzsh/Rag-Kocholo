All patients with hepatitis E viremia were infected with the HEV genotype 3 (majority sub-genotype 3c), which is predominant in Central Europe [26]. Between both groups, there were no significant differences in age; underlying kidney disease; co-morbidities; time after transplantation; or type of transplantation, namely, single kidney, combined pancreas–kidney or multi-visceral transplantation; and postmortem transplant or living donation. Furthermore, the baseline allograft function and baseline amount of proteinuria did not differ. Noteworthy, the KTRs with HEV infection had significantly higher ALT and AST levels than patients in the CG (p < 0.001). While we observed an increase in proteinuria in both groups during hepatitis E viremia or during the rise of liver enzymes in the CG, an increase in proteinuria ≥300 mg/g creatinine was significantly more frequent in the KTRs with an HEV infection compared with the CG (30% vs. 14% in the CG, p < 0.01).\n\nRegarding maintenance immunosuppression, there was a trend toward higher use of the calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) tacrolimus in the KTRs with hepatitis E than in the CG (83% vs. 71%, n.s.), while cyclosporine A was used more frequently in the CG (5.1% vs. 20.7%, p < 0.05). Moreover, mycophenolic acid (MPA) was used more frequently, albeit not significantly, in the KTRs with hepatitis E (96.6 vs. 88.4%). The frequencies of triple and dual maintenance immunosuppression were similar in both groups. Triple immunosuppression mainly consisted of a combination of CNI, MPA and low-dose corticosteroid (36 out of 45 in the KTRs with an HEV infection and 160 out of 176 in the CG). Dual maintenance immunosuppression mainly consisted of a combination of CNI and MPA, which was more often than the combination of CNI and corticosteroid or combinations with an mTOR inhibitor or belatacept. Of note, in the univariable analysis, the KTRs with HEV had a higher rate of previously treated rejection episodes (T-cell and B-cell mediated) (p = 0.051), including a significantly higher number of previous treatments for antibody-mediated rejections (ABMR) (p < 0.01). They also received high-dose corticosteroids (p < 0.01) and rituximab (p < 0.01) more often ( ). On further multivariable analysis, previous needs for high-dose steroids and treatment with rituximab were significantly associated with the occurrence of HEV infection after SOT, with odds ratios of 4.54 (95% CI 1.41–14.60) and 2.56 (95% CI 1.02–6.42), respectively ( ). In addition, the use of cyclosporine (CyA) instead of tacrolimus correlated significantly with a lower risk for HEV infection, with an odds ratio of 0.24 (0.07–0.80).\n\nTable 2\n\nVariableOdds Ratio (95% CI)p-ValueMale sex3.19 (1.58–6.43)0.001Previous use of high-dose steroids2.13 (1.15–3.94)0.016Previous use of rituximab2.96 (1.13−7.75)0.027Use of CyA as maintenance IS0.24 (0.07–0.80)0.021\n\nTo characterize the KTRs with the intake of CyA in a CNI-based maintenance therapy, we divided all KTRs by intake of CyA vs. not (Supplementary Table S1). The use of CyA was not associated with gender, age, comorbidities or type of transplant. We observed a significantly longer time since transplantation in the KTRs with CyA intake (145 ± 97 days vs. 80 ± 75 days, p < 0.001). Furthermore, CyA was used less often in immunosuppressive triple-therapy regimens.\n\nSerology at diagnosis of hepatitis E viremia was available in 56 out of 59 patients with HEV infection. A total of 49 out of 56 patients were seropositive for both IgG and IgM, while the remaining 7 patients were seropositive for IgG only. In contrast, the HEV seroprevalence was 32% in the CG (n = 80). Of these, 69 patients were positive for IgG solely, while 11 patients were positive for both IgG and IgM but were aviremic. The time of infection within the CG could not be determined retrospectively since no retained samples were stored. From these cases, we could not exclude cases of chronic HEV infection without recent viremia since no follow-up PCR tests were available. The seroprevalence in our whole cohort was 43.9% (136 out of 310 KTRs).\n\n3.2. Risk Factors for Persisting Hepatitis E Viremia with Subsequent RBV Treatment versus Viral Clearance without RBV Treatment\n\nIn total, 48 out of 59 (81.4%) KTRs with HEV infection received RBV treatment, while viral clearance without RBV treatment was seen in 11 patients ( ).\n\nTable 3\n\nPatient\n\nCharacteristicsPersistent HEV\n\nViremia (RBV-Treated)Remission\n\nWithout RBV\n\nTreatmentStatistical Group Difference, p-ValueUnivariable\n\nOR (95% CI)N = 48N = 11N (%)N (%)Gender\n\n0.426\n\n0.30 (0.04–2.59)\n\nMale36 (75)10 (90.9) Female12 (25)1 (9.1)Age Mean (y)52 ± 1546 ± 140.134 <4012 (25)4 (36.4)Reference 40–6021 (43.75)6 (54.5)1.0000.86 (0.20–3.66) >6015 (31.25)1 (9.1)0.3335.00 (0.49–50.8)Renal disease Glomerulonephritis17 (29.2)3 (27.3)0.7341.46 (0.34–6.25) Cystic kidney disease7 (14.6)0 (0)0.3281.17 (1.04–1.32) Diabetic nephropathy5 (10.4)2 (18.2)0.6040.52 (0.09–3.14) Hypoplastic kidneys4 (8.3)0 (0)1.0001.09 (1.00–1.19) Other4 (8.3)2 (18.2)0.3100.41 (0.07–2.58) Unknown12 (25)4 (36.4)0.4680.58 (0.15–2.35)Co-morbidities Hypertension37 (77.1)10 (90.9)0.4310.34 (0.39–2.93) Diabetes mellitus10 (20.8)4 (36.4)0.4320.46 (0.12–1.89) Arteriosclerosis16 (33.3)3 (27.3)1.0001.33 (0.31–5.72) History of cancer11 (22.9)1 (9.1)0.4312.97 (0.34–25.9) Chronic liver disease7 (14.6)1 (9.1)1.0001.71 (0.19–15.5)BMI (kg/m2)24 ± 4.725 ± 5.00.350Time after transplantation (m)96 ± 8380 ± 670.647Type of transplant0.329 Kidney42 (87.5)9 (81.2) Pancreas–kidney3 (6.25)2 (18.2) Other multi-visceral3 (6.25)0 (0)Type of donation0.424 Postmortem33 (68.75)8 (72.3) ABOc living donation11 (22.9)1 (9.1) ABOi living donation4 (8.3)2 (18.2) Re-transplantation7 (14.6)3 (27.3)0.3760.46 (0.10–2.15)Immunosuppressive regimen Tacrolimus41 (85.4)8 (72.7)0.3762.20 (0.47–2.15) Cyclosporine 1 (2.1)2 (18.2)0.0860.10 (0.08–1.17) Mycophenolic acid47 (97.9)10 (90.9)0.3414.70 (0.27–81.6) mTOR inhibitor6 (12.5)0 (0)0.5821.14 (1.03–1.27) Steroid40 (83.3)7 (63.6)0.2092.86 (0.67–12.1) Belatacept2 (4.2)1 (9.1)0.4680.44 (0.04–5.28)Triple IS 39 (81.3)6 (54.5)0.1103.61 (0.90–14.5) Dual IS9 (18.8)5 (45.5)0.1100.28 (0.07–1.11)Reduction/switch of IS after diagnosis16 (33.3)3 (27.3)1.0001.33 (0.31–5.72)Previous treatment of any rejection26 (54.2)3 (27.3)0.1813.15 (0.74–13.4) Use of thymoglobulin 16 (33.3)4 (36.4)1.0000.88 (0.22–4.49) Use of high-dose steroids 29 (60.4)4 (36.4)0.1872.67 (0.69–10.4) Use of rituximab9 (18.8)1 (9.1)0.6702.31 (0.26–20.4) Treatment of aABMR7 (14.6)0 (0)0.3281.17 (1.04–1.32)eGFR at diagnosis (mL/min)47 ± 3048 ± 560.325Creatinine at diagnosis (mg/dL)1.6 ± 0.61.5 ± 0.60.546eGFR during HEV infection Stable18 (37.5)8 (72.7) Deterioration (≥5 mL/min)30 (62.5)3 (27.3)0.046Baseline proteinuria (mg/g creatinine)361 ± 57872 ± 660.014Peak proteinuria during HEV infection (mg/g creatinine)735 ± 959164 ± 3760.008Rise in proteinuria during HEV viremia (≥300 mg/g crea)15/42 (35.7)0/8 (0)0.086Liver enzymes ALT max (U/L, ref < 35)226 ± 249217 ± 1200.414 AST max (U/L, ref < 31)133 ± 138140 ± 1300.869 gGT max (U/L, ref 5–36)233 ± 183169 ± 1260.217Max HEV RNA (mio cop/mL)1.8 ± 2.10.7 ± 1.50.010Grade of liver fibrosis 02 (4.2)0 111 (22.9)4 (36.4) 23 (6.25)0 39 (18.75)0 43 (6.25)0Not done20 (41.7)7 (63.4)Outcome Time of viremia (d)278 ± 203126 ± 1040.002 (range: min–max)(84–989)(21–334)Relapse17 (29.2)0 (0)0.0401.59 (1.27–1.98) SVR (>6 m)33 (68.75)11 (100)0.050\n\nThe change in IS—mainly a reduction in the CNI target level (n = 11), reduction in mycophenolic acid (n = 11) or reduction in a steroid (n = 4)—did not differ between both groups (16 in the KTRs with HEV infection vs. 3 in the CG). We did not find gender, age, co-morbidities, time after transplantation, type of transplant and immunosuppressive regimens to be significant predictors for the failure to achieve viral clearance without medical treatment. While creatinine and eGFR did not differ between both groups, the baseline and peak proteinuria were significantly higher in the KTRs with persistent HEV viremia. Along the same line, the deterioration in eGFR (defined as a decrease in GFR ≥ 5 mL/min; 62.5% vs. 27.3%, p < 0.05) occurred significantly more often in the RBV-treated KTRs with persistent viremia compared with the KTRs with remission without RBV treatment. To exclude the deterioration of kidney function, mainly in the KTRs with impaired allograft function, we divided the KTRs by the status of the allograft function (Supplementary Table S2) with creatinine ≤ 1.4 mg/dL vs. >1.4 mg/dL. While the baseline proteinuria did not differ between both groups, we observed higher peak proteinuria during the HEV infection in the KTR group with impaired allograft function (p = 0.042). In contrast, the percentage of KTRs with an increase in proteinuria (>300 mg/g Crea) during HEV infection was not higher in the KTRs with elevated creatinine (27.2% vs. 23.1%). Furthermore, the numbers of stable eGFR were higher in the KTRs with creatinine ≤ 1.4 mg/dL(50% vs. 39.4%; p = 0.441). Thus, we concluded that increases in proteinuria and deterioration in kidney function during HEV infection were not solely a result of chronic kidney damage, but were potentially HEV-associated.\n\nFailure to achieve remission without medical treatment was associated with prolonged viremia (278 ± 203 vs. 126 ± 104 days, p < 0.01), with a higher rate of viral rebounds after the initial viral clearance (n = 17 vs. 0, p < 0.05). Only 33 out of 48 patients (69%) on the RBV treatment reached an SVR in the long term. The KTRs with persistent virus replication also peaked with a higher maximal viral load (1.8 ± 2.1 vs. 0.7 ± 1.5 mio cop/mL, p = 0.01).\n\nThe measurement of liver stiffness using transient elastography or shear wave elastography was performed in 32 KTRs with hepatitis E ( ). Out of the 28 KTRs treated with RBV, moderate to severe liver fibrosis was observed in 15 patients (grades F2 to 4), while 2 had F0 and 11 had F1 fibrosis. Only 4 out of 11 KTRs without RBV treatment were investigated, all with mild liver fibrosis (F1).\n\n3.3. Risk Factors for RBV Treatment Failure\n\nSix patients received treatment for less than three months, 14 for approximately three months, eight for 3–6 months, six for approximately six months and 14 for longer than six months. The mean time to viral rebound was 4.0 ± 2.9 months. To analyze the risk factors for insufficient viral clearance after the RBV treatment, we subdivided all RBV-treated KTRs according to the treatment outcome ( ).\n\nTable 4\n\nPatient\n\nCharacteristicsRBV Treatment Failure *RBV Treatment SuccessStatistical Group Difference,\n\np-ValueUnivariable\n\nOR (95% CI)N = 19N = 29N (%)N (%)Gender Male15 (78.9)21 (72.4)0.7390.70 (0.18–2.76) Female4 (21.1)8 (27.6)Age Mean (y)56.1 ± 13.749.5 ± 15.70.054 <402 (10.5)10 (34.5)Ref 40–608 (42.1)13 (44.8)0.2593.08 (0.53–17.80) >609 (47.4)6 (20.7)0.0477.50 (1.20–47.05)Co-morbidities Hypertension 16 (84.2)21 (72.4)0.4882.03 (0.46–8.90) Diabetes mellitus 5 (26.3)5 (17.2)0.4871.71 (0.42–6.98) Arteriosclerosis 9 (47.9)7 (24.1)0.1242.83 (0.82–9.76) History of cancer 5 (26.3)6 (20.7)0.7321.40 (0.35–5.34) Chronic liver disease 5 (26.3)2 (6.9)0.0974.82 (0.83–28.1)BMI (kg/m2)22.2 ± 4.225.3 ± 4.70.019BMI ≤ 20 kg/m28 (42.1)3 (10.3)0.0325.8 (1.29–26.25)Time after transplantation (m)90 ± 8399 ± 850.524Type of transplant Kidney16 (84.2)26 (89.7)Ref Pancreas–kidney1 (5.3)2 (6.9)1.0000.81 (0.07–9.70) Other multi-visceral2 (10.5)1 (3.4)0.5553.25 (0.27–38.81)Immunosuppressive regimen Tacrolimus16 (84.2)25 (86.2)1.0000.85 (0.17–4.33) Cyclosporine A0 (0)1 (3.4)1.0000.60 (0.47–0.75) Mycophenolic acid19 (100)28 (96.6)1.0001.68 (1.33–2.12) mTOR inhibitor2 (10.5)4 (14.0)1.0000.74 (0.12–4.47) Steroids17 (89.5)23 (79.3)0.4512.22 (0.40–12.4) Belatacept2 (10.5)0 (0)0.1522.71 (0.19–3.95)Triple IS16 (84.2)23 (79.3)1.0001.39 (0.30–6.40)Dual IS3 (15.8)6 (20.7)1.0000.72 (0.16–3.31)Previous treatment of any rejection8 (42.1)18 (62.1)0.2392.25 (0.69–7.32) Use of thymoglobulin6 (31.6)10 (34.5)1.0001.14 (0.33–3.92) Use of high-dose steroids11 (57.9)18 (62.1)1.0001.19 (0.37–3.87) Use of rituximab4 (21.1)5 (17.2)1.0000.78 (0.18–3.38) Treatment of aABMR2 (10.5)5 (17.2)0.6871.77 (0.31–10.2)Renal function Creatinine at diagnosis (mg/dL)1.6 ± 0.61.6 ± 0.60.847 eGFR at diagnosis (mL/min)49 ± 1845 ± 360.819 Minimal eGFR at disease (mL/min)35 ± 2045 ± 200.362Renal function during HEV viremia Stable4 (21.1)14 (48.3)Ref Deterioration (≥5 mL/min)15 (78.9)15 (51.7)0.0733.5 (0.93–13.13)Baseline proteinuria (mg/g crea)253 ± 555432 ± 5910.292Peak proteinuria during HEV (mg/g crea)1004 ± 1243560 ± 6840.167Rise in proteinuria during HEV (≥300 mg/g crea)8/16 (50)7/26 (26.9)0.1882.71 (0.73–10.04)Liver enzymes ALT max (U/L, ref < 35)215 ± 256232 ± 2490.829 AST max (U/L, ref < 31)157 ± 105138 ± 1270.927 gGT max (U/L, ref 5–36)248 ± 184224 ± 1850.699HEV RNA max (mio cop/mL)1.8 ± 2.31.8 ± 1.90.558Duration of RBV treatment (d)471 ± 511.5118 ± 58.5<0.001(range: min–max)(45–2155)(39–310)RBV dosage (mg/d)363 ± 201381 ± 1520.332Hemolytic anemia15 (78.9)17 (58.6)0.1113.53 (0.83–14.9)Side effects of treatment18 (95)23 (79)0.2194.70 (0.52–42.6)Negative HEV PCR 4 weeks after start of treatment9 (47)20 (69)0.1200.32 (0.09–1.10)Remission after last treatment13 (68)29 (100)0.002SVR4 (21)29 (100)<0.001\n\nTreatment success was defined as viral clearance and an SVR after the first treatment round with RBV (n = 29). Treatment failure was defined as ongoing viremia or a viral rebound after an initial viral clearance (n = 19). KTRs with treatment failure had a longer mean treatment duration with RBV compared with the KTRs with treatment success (471 ± 511.5 vs. 118 ± 58.5 days, p < 0.01). The mean RBV doses in both groups did not differ, but we asked whether the start dose was inadequately low or whether the RBV-induced side effects, especially anemia, led to an interruption of the RBV treatment, dose reduction and, as a consequence, higher rates of viral relapse. Detailed characteristics are depicted in . We observed a lower median RBV dose at the initiation of treatment in patients with RBV treatment failure vs. patients with successful viral clearance (300 vs. 400 mg). With respect to the high rates of relevant anemia in both cohorts (78.9 and 58.6%), the rates of EPO treatment and the start of EPO treatment during RBV treatment (73.6 and 55.1%) were not significantly higher in patients with RBV treatment failure, but there was a significant delay of EPO initiation in patients with treatment failure (after 67.6 ± 49.5 vs. 16.0 ± 15.2 days).\n\nTable 5\n\nCharacteristicsRBV Treatment FailureRBV Treatment SuccessStatistical Group Difference,\n\np-ValueN = 19N = 29N (%)N (%)Duration of RBV treatment (d)471 ± 511.5118 ± 58.5<0.001(range: min–max)(45–2155)(39–310)Mean RBV dosage (mg/d)363 ± 201381 ± 1520.332Median start dose3004000.347(range: min–max)(200–800)(200–1000)Start dose lower than GFR-adapted dosing9 (47.4)13 (44.8)1.000Increase of dosage6 (31.6)1 (3.4)0.770- After a mean time of (d)204 ± 194140.500Reduction of dosage6 (31.6)7 (24.1)0.741- After a mean time of (d)71.5 ± 30.863.4 ± 43.90.366RBV-induced anemia15 (78.9)17 (58.6)0.111Interruption due to hemolytic anemia3 (15.8)3 (10.3)0.662- After a mean time of (d)113.3 ± 61.167.7 ± 23.70.400EPO treatment before RBV7 (36.8)11 (37.9)1.000EPO start after RBV7 (36.8)5 (17.2)0.168- After a mean time of (d)67.6 ± 49.516.0 ± 15.20.048Increase in EPO dosage12 (63.2)14 (48.3)0.245\n\nOnly 4 out of 19 (21%) patients with ongoing viremia or a viral rebound reached an SVR in the long-term after a median follow-up time of 5 (range 2.0–5.0) years since the diagnosis of HEV viremia. A negative HEV PCR by week four was observed in 69% of KTRs with treatment success vs. in 47.4% of KTRs without (p = 0.089), which may be an independent predictive factor for a positive treatment outcome.\n\nAlthough not significant, we observed a trend toward older mean age in KTRs with treatment failure (56.1 ± 13.7 years) vs. KTRs with viral clearance (49.5 ± 15.7 years) (p = 0.054, A). Univariable analysis revealed age > 60 years as a risk factor for RBV treatment failure with an odds ratio of 7.50 (95% CI 1.20–47.05). Besides this, the KTRs with treatment failure had a significantly lower mean body mass index (BMI) compared with the KTRs with viral clearance (22.2 ± 4.2 kg/m2 vs. 25.3 ± 4.7 kg/m2, p < 0.05, B).\n\nMoreover, a BMI ≤ 20 kg/m2 was significantly associated with failure to achieve viral clearance (10.3% in the group with treatment success vs. 42.1% in the group with treatment failure, p < 0.05, ). On further multivariable analysis, only age > 60 years and a BMI ≤ 20 kg/m2 were significantly associated with RBV treatment failure, with odds ratios of 4.34 (95% CI 1.05–17.96) and 7.73 (95% CI 1.53–39.05), respectively ( ).\n\nTable 6\n\nVariableOdds Ratio (95% CI)p-ValueAge > 60 years4.34 (1.05–17.96)0.043BMI ≤ 20 kg/m27.73 (1.53–39.05)0.013\n\nFurthermore, albeit not significant, we observed a higher rate of deterioration in kidney function and proteinuria during hepatitis E viremia (decrease of eGFR ≥ 5 mL/min) in the KTRs with treatment failure vs. treatment success (78.9% vs. 51.7%, p = 0.07). To consider RBV mutations as a reason for treatment failure, a mutation analysis in the HEV polymerase was performed in 12 out of 19 patients with RBV treatment failure; the results were found to be positive in 7 patients.\n\n3.4. Eating Habits of KTRs with or without HEV Infection\n\nFinally, we utilized a questionnaire to evaluate the risk behavior with respect to eating habits by referring to the time before disease onset or diagnosis ( ).\n\nTable 7\n\nPatient\n\nCharacteristicsKTRs with HEV Infection\n\nN = 40\n\nN (%) KTRs w/o\n\nHEV Infection\n\nN = 80\n\nN (%)Statistical Group\n\nDifference, p-ValueUnivariable\n\nOR (95% CI) Gender Male30 (75)51 (63.75) Female10 (25)29 (36.25) Age Mean (y)52 ± 13.655.6 ± 13.60.241 Fish (39)(79) At least weekly6 (15.4)39 (49.4)0.0030.11 (0.03–0.46) Less than weekly27 (69.2)36 (45.6)0.3590.54 (0.15–1.87) Never6 (15.4)4 (5.1)Ref Seafood (40)(76) At least weekly0 (0)1 (1.3)1.0000.60 (0.54–0.73) Less than weekly3 (7.5)18 (25)0.0430.26 (0.07–0.95) Never36 (90)56 (73.7)Ref Salad At least weekly28 (70)67 (83.75)0.5110.42 (0.03–6.92) Less than weekly11 (27.5)12 (15)1.0000.92 (0.05–16.4) Never1 (2.5)1 (1.25)Ref Raw vegetables At least weekly18 (45)62 (77.5)0.2970.47 (0.14–1.60) Less than weekly17 (42.5)10 (69.6)0.1850.37 (0.09–1.44) Never5 (12.5)10 (11.4)Ref Raw milk products (31)(69) At least weekly1 (3.2)19 (27.6)0.0020.07 (0.01–0.56) Less than weekly4 (12.9)15 (21.7)0.1090.36 (0.11–1.21) Never26 (83.9)35 (50.7)Ref Raw minced pork meat (37)(78) At least weekly2 (5.4)2 (2.6)0.5982.07 (0.28–15.4) Less than weekly6 (16.2)16 (20.5)0.7990.78 (0.28–2.19) Never29 (78.4)60 (76.9)Ref Cooked minced pork meat (37)(79) At least weekly5 (13.5)5 (6.3)0.2053.75 (0.71–19.7) Less than weekly28 (75.7)59 (75.6)0.4171.78 (0.54–5.86) Never4 (10.8)15 (19.2)Ref Pork steak (39)(79) At least weekly12 (30.8)8 (10.1)0.0116.38 (1.56–26.1) Less than weekly23 (59.0)54 (68.4)0.4150.55 (0.17–1.82) Never4 (10.2)17 (20.5)Ref Raw minced beef meat (38)(77) At least weekly1 (2.6)2 (2.6)1.0001.00 (0.09–11.45) Less than weekly5 (13.2)11 (14.3)1.0000.91 (0.29–2.84) Never32 (84.2)64 (83.1)Ref Beef steak undercooked (36)(77) At least weekly1 (2.8)3 (3.9)1.0000.73 (0.07–7.36) Less than weekly9 (25)17 (22.1)0.8121.16 (0.64–2.95) Never26 (72.2)57 (74.0)Ref Wild boar meat (37)(58) Yes2 (5.4)7 (12.1) No35 (94.6)51 (87.9)0.2790.42 (0.08–2.12) Meat processing at home (38)(70) At least weekly12 (31.6)3 (4.3)0.0275.43 (1.29–22.9) Less than weekly12 (31.6)48 (68.6)0.0300.34 (0.13–0.87) Never14 (36.8)19 (27.1)Ref Touching raw meat with bare hands (22)(64) Yes18 (81.8)37 (57.8)0.0433.28 (1.00–10.81) No4 (18.2)27 (42.2)Ref Salami, raw sausage (38)(78) At least weekly18 (47.4)24 (30.8)0.0393.45 (1.10–10.83) Less than weekly15 (39.5)31 (39.7)0.1892.23 (0.71–7.01) Never5 (13.1)23 (29.5)Ref Spreadable sausage (Teeschinken) (35)(78) At least weekly14 (40.0)11 (14.1)<0.0017.16 (2.41–21.3) Less than weekly13 (37.1)22 (28.2)3.32 (1.20–9.20) Never8 (22.9)45 (57.7)0.023Ref Raw ham (38)(78) At least weekly12 (31.6)22 (28.2)0.1902.18 (0.77–6.21) Less than weekly18 (47.4)24 (30.8)0.0343.0 (1.12–8.05) Never8 (21.1)32 (41.0)Ref Cured pork meat (Pökel) (35)(77) At least weekly5 (14.3)14 (18.2)0.0157.14 (1.52–33.5) Less than weekly16 (45.7)<0.0014.90 (1.95–12.3) Never14 (40.0)60 (77.9)Ref Boiled sausage (Brühwurst) (36)(77) At least weekly12 (33.3)14 (18.2)0.0025.88 (1.95–17.8) Less than weekly17 (47.2)15 (19.5)<0.0017.77 (2.71–22.3) Never7 (19.4)48 (62.3)Ref Jellied sausage (Sülzwurst) (34)(77) At least weekly0 (0)5 (6.5)0.3180.71 (0.62–0.81) Less than weekly9 (26.5)10 (13.0)0.1732.23 (0.81–6.15) Never25 (73.5)62 (80.5)Ref Blood sausage (Blutwurst) (35)(72) At least weekly0 (0)2 (2.8)1.0000.72 (0.63–0.82) Less than weekly10 (28.6)6 (8.3)0.0104.27 (1.40–12.98) Never25 (71.4)64 (88.9)Ref Liver sausage (Leberwurst) (36)(78) At least weekly7 (19.5)17 (21.8)1.0000.99 (0.33–2.94) Less than weekly16 (44.4)29 (37.2)0.6541.36 (0.56–3.30) Never13 (36.1)32 (41.0)Ref Wiener sausage (36)(77) At least weekly8 (22.2)22 (28.6)0.4400.64 (0.22–1.85) Less than weekly15 (41.7)32 (41.6)0.8151.21 (0.48–3.01) Never13 (36.1)23 (29.8)Ref\n\nDietary surveys were available from 40 out of 59 patients with HEV infection. To compare eating habits with a control group of KTRs, the same questionnaire was answered by 80 control KTRs (to reach a 1:2 ratio) with no evidence of HEV infection during the same observation period. These patients were mainly not part of the original control group since, due to the retrospective nature of the analysis, not enough dietary information was available from KTRs without HEV infection. There was no KTR in close contact with house pigs in both groups and there were no professional hunters amongst the KTRs. As expected, most KTRs in our cohort ate meat. There were only three vegetarians amongst all patients who filled in the questionnaire. Remarkably, despite education and advice regarding the avoidance of uncooked or undercooked meat, approximately one out of five KTRs consumed raw minced pork and beef meat, and 86.9% of the HEV group patients ate raw sausage (such as salami) and 78.9% ate ham (compared with 70.5% and 59%, respectively, in the CG). A significantly higher number of KTRs with HEV infection consumed spreadable raw sausages (such as German “Teewurst”), cured pork meat, boiled sausages and blood sausage ( ). Regarding the preparation of meat at home, both meat processing at home and touching raw meat by bare hands were more common in KTRs with HEV infection.\n\nIn contrast, there was a trend toward less meat consumption and more consumption of fish, raw vegetables and raw milk (mostly cheese products) in the CG.\n\n3.5. LongTerm Follow-Up and Allograft Outcome\n\nThe median time of the follow-up in the HEV cohort was 4.2 (IQR 2.2, 5.8) years since the diagnosis of HEV infection and 3.8 (IQR 1.8, 5.6) years in the CG. During four years of patient individual follow-up, graft failures occurred in 8 (13.6%) patients of the HEV cohort, with a median time to loss of 1.4 (IQR 0.5, 2.4) years, and in 16 (6.4%) patients of the CG, with a median time to loss of 1.6 (IQR 0.7, 2.5) years.\n\nThe survival of the KTRs with hepatitis E was 89.8% (6 out of 59 died, two of those with a functioning graft) vs. 89.6% (26 out of 251 died, four of those with a functioning graft) in the CG. Thus, deathcensored graft survival was 89.8 vs. 95.2%. Rates of deathcensored graft losses and deaths did not differ significantly between both groups, as described by the Kaplan–Meier estimator shown in A,B (p = 0.160 vs. p = 0.869).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nWe found that intensive immunosuppressive treatments and the consumption and/or processing of undercooked pork meat were associated with hepatitis E infection in patients after SOT. In addition, higher age and lower BMI were risk factors for persistent hepatitis E viremia and RBV treatment failure, resulting in lower rates of remission and sustained viral responses in the long term.\n\nThe risk of infections after kidney transplantation is influenced by the intensity of immunosuppression, e.g., used for induction therapy, maintenance therapy and antirejection treatments. Our findings are in line with Kamar et al. [5] and our previous evaluation [4], which showed deleterious effects of previous T or Bcell targeting therapies regarding the incidence of hepatitis E infection and the risk for viral persistence in kidney transplant recipients, even many years after transplantation. This is also in line with the observation made by Kamar et al., who found that tacrolimus levels and steroid doses were lower in KTRs with viral clearance of hepatitis E viremia compared with KTRs with persistent viremia [27]. A small case series of five patients with immunocompromised conditions and previous treatments containing rituximab (RTX) demonstrated a longterm risk for HEV infection with persistent viremia or relapses despite treatment with RBV, where only one out of five reached an SVR after 6 months of treatment [28]. Another case series described chronic HEV infections after the use of RTX and bendamustine in lymphoma patients [29]. Thus, intense immunosuppressive treatment regimens beyond standard induction, such as the use of basiliximab, and standard maintenance therapy carry the risk for higher rates of HEV infection. In our cohort, a history of antirejection treatment with highdose steroids, thymoglobuline, and/or RTX due to cellular or antibodymediated rejections (with the latter often including a combination of steroids, plasmapheresis, rituximab and IVIG) in the past were associated with a higher incidence of HEV infection. Consequently, in terms of the risk of HEV infections, “blind” rejection treatments, e.g., with highdose steroids after SOT, should be avoided, and patienttailored treatments for antibodymediated rejection (ABMR) are warranted. Along the same line, the use of RTX should be considered carefully.\n\nWhile maintenance immunosuppression in all KTRs was dominated by the intake of triple immunosuppression of CNI, MPA and lowdose CS, a trend toward a more frequent use of the CNI tacrolimus compared with cyclosporine A was found in both patients with persistent viremia and patients unable to clear the virus without RBV treatment. Moreover, the use of CyA instead of tacrolimus was significantly higher in our control cohort of KTRs without HEV infection and correlated significantly with a potentially lower risk for HEV infection. This is possibly related to the fact that CyA was the first available CNI inhibitor in kidney transplantation. It was used for maintenance therapy for many years and kept in case of stable allograft function. Second, a switch from tacrolimus to CyA was used as an alternative option in case of tacrolimusinduced side effects or recurrent episodes of infection. We believe that the intensity of immunosuppression matters and that tacrolimus instead of CyA might predispose patients to more viral infections, including HEV infection.\n\nWe have to emphasize that we did not screen all KTRs from our center for HEV but only patients with (unexplained) elevated liver enzymes. Because of this, we think that by and large, the HEV seroprevalence in our cohort of KTRs (43.9%) was higher compared with other European studies (approximately 10–20% [30,31,32], with the exception of several French cohorts with a higher seroprevalence in general [33,34,35]). Serology for IgG and IgM may persist even years after infection, which underlines the importance of PCR tests to differentiate between previous and acute infection. The prevalence of KTR with RTPCRconfirmed hepatitis E was 19% in our cohort, which was substantially higher compared with other studies, with a range from 0.9% to 3.5% [30,36,37]. The reason why is likely related to our clinical practice to test KTRs only in the case of elevated liver enzymes, which highlights the importance to screen for HEV in this special cohort.\n\nWe observed a potential HEVassociated kidney involvement with a rise in proteinuria in KTR with persistent HEV viremia and RBV treatment compared with KTRs with remission without RBV treatment. This indicates that an increase in proteinuria and deterioration in kidney function during HEV infection is not only related to chronic impairment of allograft function but also a direct result of HEV infection. Certain findings in kidney transplant histology, as described in our earlier paper, increase the likelihood of HEVinduced GN and influence whether it resolves after viral clearance [4]. This is in line with previous reports, demonstrating kidney involvement with or without a loss of eGFR or a rise in proteinuria [38,39]. HEVmediated kidney damage may be a result of a direct or indirect cytopathic injury caused by the virus itself or by immunecomplexmediated mechanisms, as demonstrated in vitro studies [40,41]. Similar to hepatitis B and C, HEVassociated cryoglobulinemic vasculitis was described [42,43], but we did not observe this in our patient cohort.\n\nThe number of patients without a need for further RBV treatment was low (11 vs. 48). In this small cohort, we could not identify significant predictors for spontaneous remission vs. continuous viremia. The more frequent use of Tac (instead of CyA) points toward more intense maintenance IS as a potential risk factor for the failure of viral clearance.\n\nChronic hepatitis E can lead to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis [3]. Noninvasive methods, such as transient elastography or shear wave elastography, have received substantial attention due to their easy access, reproducibility and accuracy in common liver diseases, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatitis B and C [23,44]. From our cohort of 59 KTRs with HEV infection, transient elastography or shear wave elastography measurements were available from 32 KTRs and demonstrated substantial liver stiffness in 15. Since this was a retrospective study, we could not include control KTRs without hepatitis E, but this was shown in a previous study by Schulz et al., where liver stiffness was significantly higher in KTRs with a history of hepatitis E than in control KTRs [21]. The use of serial measurements for liver surveillance and changes in liver elasticity during HEV disease or after treatment should be investigated in future prospective studies.\n\nThe high rate of KTRs with a recurrence of HEV replication after the end of or during RBV treatment (19 out of 48) warrants further investigations regarding risk factors. One explanation might be an inadequately low RBV dose at the initiation of treatment, as observed in our cohort in about 50% of cases. The high frequency of RBVinduced anemia might have triggered the decision to start with a lower RBV dose. In addition, the significant delay of EPO therapy in patients with RBV treatment failure likely contributed to a higher number of relevant anemia, RBV dose reduction and, as a consequence, more relapses or an incomplete viral clearance. We emphasize the need for adequate dosing of RBV to treat hepatitis E infection and we recommend immediate or very early substitution of EPO in the case of anemia or a drop in hemoglobin. The rebound or reinfection rate in our study was higher than reported by Kamar et al. [8,9], where the authors used a higher initial median dose of 600 mg per day in a retrospective study with an HEV rebound in 10 out of 59 patients after SOT with 37 KTRs and 5 combined kidney–pancreas transplant recipients [9]. Another reason to detect a higher rate of relapses might be the longer observation and follow-up period of our study. Resistance to RBV due to mutations is another major concern. Mutations in the HEV polymerase were found in approximately 50% of our KTRs with treatment failure. Data regarding the frequency and impact of mutations leading to RBV resistance are scarce but should be considered in patients with a difficulttotreat HEV infection [20,45,46]. The impact on treatment outcomes has to be investigated in larger studies.\n\nIn our cohort, a lower BMI, especially ≤20 kg/m2, was a risk predictor in the KTRs with failure to sustain viral clearance. A low BMI might indicate malnutrition or cachexia with a more enhanced immunocompromised condition. Nutritional advice during patient care and avoidance of weight loss with the detection of factors associated with cachexia, e.g., undetected inflammation, are important. Along the same line, older age (>60 years) tended to be a risk factor for an unfavorable outcome [47,48]. Moreover, an early viral response to RBV may have an impact on the overall treatment response. Although not significant, we observed a higher rate of negative HEV PCRs by week four in KTRs with viral clearance after RBV treatment and a subsequent SVR compared with KTRs with relapsing courses or failure to achieve an SVR. Kamar et al. demonstrated that an initial decrease in the HEV viral load ≥ 0.5 log copies/mL had an 88% positive predictive value for an SVR [49]. Along the same line, a negative viral load one month after treatment was associated with a higher sustained virologic response [9,34]. However, the predictive value of this measure needs to be validated in larger studies. Overall, we suggest an RBV treatment time of at least three months, with a prolonged course of 6–9 months or even longer than 9 months in the case of persistent viremia or relapsing disease.\n\nLongterm allograft and patient outcomes did not differ between KTRs with hepatitis E and control patients. In a Scottish multicenter retrospective study, 511 cases with an HEV infection were reported between 2013 to 2018, with a mortality rate of 3.3% and chronic courses of HEV infection were a positive predictor for mortality in their study [50]. However, we did not observe an increased hepatitisErelated mortality in our study.\n\nFinally, after organ transplantation, we educate patients to avoid undercooked meat, as well as potentially contaminated food products. Regarding meat, a cooking temperature of 71 °C for 20 min is required to fully inactivate the virus, but especially with readytoeat products, there is a lack of detailed knowledge regarding manufacturing processes. Moreover, drying procedures, such as for raw ham, do not guarantee virus inactivation. Indeed, HEV RNA could be detected in commercial pork sausages, pork liver and liver pâté in German groceries [51,52,53].\n\nWe assume that patients are either not aware of or underestimate the risk of HEV acquisition by potentially undercooked products, such as raw sausages (in Germany typically through “Salami”, “Mettwurst” and “Leberwurst”), boiled sausages (e.g., all kinds of “Brühaufschnitt”) and “Wiener” sausage. Interestingly, there is a male predominance regarding the consumption of undercooked meat products among KTRs. Given HEV infections even many years after SOT, we assume a general loss of vigilance in the long term.\n\nWe suggest continuous education of KTRs regarding food habits and emphasize a detailed anamnesis after diagnosis of HEV infection to find relevant sources for transmission and possibly persistent viremia. Moreover, we recommend that meat processing at home with bare hands should be avoided, e.g., by using gloves, and careful cleaning of hands and knives with soap is advised afterward. Since KTRs in the control cohort ate products such as seafood, raw vegetables and salads more frequently than KTRs in the hepatitis E cohort, these products are probably not the main cause of HEV transmission.\n\nA limitation of the study was its retrospective nature with a singlecenter cohort. Laboratory assessment for HEV RNA and serology was only performed for KTRs with elevated liver enzymes."
