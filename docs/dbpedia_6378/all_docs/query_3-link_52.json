        "text": "NOTES\n\nIntroduction\n\n1. Ian Duncan, Modern Romance and Transformations of the Novel.\n\n2. See Clifford Siskin, The Work of Writing, 196. But as Siskin recognizes, the gendering of genre is highly unstable and, as Mary Favret points out, was already in flux (“Mary Shelley’s Sympathy and Irony,” 24–25).\n\n3. Mary Favret, “Telling Tales about Genre,” 154, 158.\n\n4. Mary Wollstonecraft, The Wrongs of Woman; or, Maria: A Fragment (1798), in “Mary” and “The Wrongs of Woman,” 82. Hereafter cited as W.\n\n5. Lennard Davis argues that the novel emerges as part of a discourse network that values the new and the news (Factual Fictions). This view can be taken back to Mikhail Bakhtin’s argument that the novel introduces a new sense of time distinct from that of the past-oriented epic (“Epic and Novel,” 3–40). Davis deals only with the genre of the novel. However, Bakhtin’s notion of “novelization” extends the episteme of the novel to other genres, thus offering a poetics of the novel, rather than the more limited sociology of the genre that has come to dominate Anglo-American studies in the past three decades. Finally, the linkage of the novel with the new(s) can also be traced back to Friedrich Schlegel’s use of the term “Roman” synonymously with a “progressive universal poetry” that is associated with the “new” and is “still in the state of becoming.” For Schlegel the progressive is that which “often negates itself but also immediately creates itself again.” Importantly for my use of narrative here, Schlegel also equates the novel with “romantische Poesie” (“Atheneum Fragments,” 11, 31–32; Literary Notebooks, 1797–1801, ed. Hans Eichner [Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1957], 32. Translations mine).\n\n6.

Cleanth Brooks’ The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry (New York: Reynal and Hitchcock, 1947), which represents Romanticism by Wordsworth’s “Intimations of Immortality,” is the classic example of the New Criticism’s close reading of single short poems or short extracts from longer poems. Its most obvious Romantic follower is Earl Wasserman’s The Finer Tone. For the historicist identification of Romanticism with Wordsworth, see James Chandler, Wordsworth’s Second Nature, and Alan Liu, Wordsworth: The Sense of History, as well as Marjorie Levinson, Wordsworth’s Great Period-Poems, which, curiously, follows the New Critical model of autonomous chapters devoted to the close reading of single poems. Siskin also sees lyric as playing a key role in the professionalization and “specialization” of literature (Work of Writing, 131–33). See also Liu for the association of Wordsworth with a lyric moment of “local transcendence” (“Local Transcendence,” 87).\n\n12.

The word is not Shelley’s, but is widely used, beginning with Earl Wasserman, Shelley: A Critical Reading, 11–21. Before Wasserman’s influential reading, which describes Alastor as “an elegiac biography narrated by a dramatic speaker who has his own fictional identity” (11) and then goes on to describe this speaker as the Narrator, the Narrator and Poet were generally confused. See, for instance, Harold Bloom, The Visionary Company, 280; Ross Woodman, The Apocalyptic Vision in the Poetry of Shelley, 13. This confusion is a symptom of the poem’s intension and inwardness. Though they do not take up narrative as a problem within the text, readings after Wasserman always refer to a Narrator: see, for example, my own reading, which sees the Poet and Narrator as positions on a spectrum rather than sharply differentiated characters (Dark Interpreter, 75–83); Lloyd Abbey, Destroyer and Preserver, 21–30; Jerrold Hogle, Shelley’s Process, 57.\n\n7. Mary Favret, “Mary Shelley’s Sympathy and Irony,” 17–19, 29. For a less binary and polemical reading of Mary Shelley’s editorial relationship to Percy’s work, see Susan Wolfson’s essay in the same volume, “Editorial Privilege: Mary Shelley and Percy Shelley’s Audiences” (39–72).\n\n8.

In Romantic Moods: Paranoia, Trauma, and Melancholy, Thomas Pfau compellingly argues for the relationship between lyric and “a traumatic … disturbance of the subject” in the period 1800–15 (21; see also 192–94). In Alastor, I am suggesting, lyric is a trope for trauma.\n\n10. Paul Ricoeur, “Narrative and Hermeneutics,” 153.\n\n11. Paul de Man, “Shelley Disfigured,” 100, 110–20.\n\n12.

Brett-Smith (Oxford: Blackwell, 1921–53), 63–67, 82.\n\n21. According to Richard Woodhouse in an 1819 letter to John Taylor, Keats thought Isabella “mawkish” (Hyder Rollins, ed., The Keats Circle, I.:90).\n\n22. Agamben, The Idea of Prose, 40–41.

The Narrator’s “tale” of course cannot have the other characteristic Benjamin associates with the form, that of reinforcing community around an orally shared experience, since the Narrator is already part of the world of writing and solitude that Benjamin associates with the novel (87, 99).\n\n26. Quotations are from Wordsworth and Coleridge, Lyrical Ballads.\n\n27. In the first “Essay upon Epitaphs” (1810), Wordsworth writes that the character of the deceased should be seen through a “tender haze or a luminous mist, that spiritualizes and beautifies it; that takes away indeed, but only to the end that the parts that are not abstracted may appear more dignified and lovely” (Literary Criticism of William Wordsworth, 101).\n\n28.

For Lacan the “Symbolic” in contrast to the “Imaginary” is the order of language and the law in which the subject finds himself inscribed and displaced. Kristeva adds a third category to this dyad in the “semiotic,” which is associated with physiological drives and pulsions whose residual presence disrupts language and which is felt in terms of absence, contradiction, silence. Where the Symbolic is patriarchal, the semiotic is associated with the mother’s body, so the feminine resistance to male logos is not pleasure (as in Hélène Cixous’s valorization of the Imaginary) but rather a de-idealized difference (R, 25–30).\n\n33. Jacques Derrida, Positions, 26.\n\n34. Benjamin, “The Storyteller,” 86, 97; Paul Ricoeur, “Narrative Time,” 170–73.\n\n35. William Wordsworth, The Excursion; further references are given in the text. Wordsworth, “Preface to ‘Lyrical Ballads,’ with Other Poems (1800),” 21.\n\n36. The various stages and states of the text (literally a text and not a work in Roland Barthes’s sense) and their complicated history can be found in William Wordsworth, “The Ruined Cottage” and “The Pedlar,” edited by James Butler, whose “Introduction” to the various texts (3–36) is an indispensable resource. References to “The Baker’s Cart” and “Incipient Madness” are also from this edition.\n\n37. Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Biographia Literaria, 2.156.\n\n38. The phrase is used by de Selincourt and Darbishire in the Notes to their edition of The Excursion (365).\n\n39. In its earliest form MS B, according to Butler, was a 528-line poem, ending with “she died, / Last human tenant of these ruined walls,” followed by the words “The End.” Wordsworth then started drafting and adding lines about the Pedlar’s early education and his developing philosophy of the “One Life”; as these additions made the bleakness of the original ending inappropriate, he made several attempts at a reconciling conclusion (“Introduction,” 17–20). Alternatively, the attempts at a conclusion may have come first, and the supplementary material on the Pedlar may have been added later to make the conclusion more credible (21). Interestingly, in her copying Dorothy did not copy all the Pedlar material (19), thus evincing a certain uneasiness about its superfluity. In MS D, Wordsworth does indeed remove much, but not all of the Pedlar material to the verso of the text.\n\n40. Butler, “Introduction,” 9; Browning, “Essay on Shelley,” 65.\n\n41. Rodolphe Gasché, The Tain of the Mirror, 6.\n\n42. “The Baker’s Cart” and “Incipient Madness” are sometimes assumed to precede MS A, but Butler dates the former before and the latter after the first stammering draft of Margaret’s story. Butler’s dating, however, refers to the completed and titled fragment “Incipient Madness.” Even according to his argument, Wordsworth was drafting the fragment and MS A simultaneously, and he “eventually decided” to transfer the latter to “the opposite verso” (9). The point is that the two are connected: the very transference of “Incipient Madness” to the verso is the condition of possibility for writing the further poem which is in some sense answerable to, reflected back into, the space of this de-jection. Similarly but somewhat differently, Joel Faflak suggests that the fragments constitute the “primal scene” of The Ruined Cottage, or rather The Recluse (Romantic Psychoanalysis, 80). But the point is that this primal scene is not just the trauma (real or fantasized) that underlies composition but also its inspiration, its creative condition.\n\n43. To write, according to Blanchot, is “to surrender to the fascination of time’s absence … The time of time’s absence is not dialectical. In this time what appears is the fact that nothing appears. What appears is the being deep within being’s absence.” This absence is the absence of the work, which makes the writer “a survivor, without work,” désouevré (“The Essential Solitude,” in The Space of Literature, 24, 30).\n\n44. Samuel Taylor Coleridge, “Frost at Midnight,” The Complete Poetical Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, 1.9, 15–19.\n\n45. Parenthetical references are to The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake, ed. David V. Erdman; hereafter cited as E, and referred to by page and plate number.\n\n46. Parenthetical references to The Fall of Hyperion are to The Poems of John Keats, ed. Jack Stillinger.\n\n47. Wordsworth, miscellaneous Dove Cottage mss, quoted in Butler, “Introduction,” 17.\n\n48. Butler, “Introduction,” II. Butler speculates that Lamb may have seen an early and/or later text of MS B.\n\n49. “The Ruined Cottage” was in fact offered to Joseph Cottle in 1798 and was slated for publication, but instead Cottle printed the Lyrical Ballads (Butler, “Introduction,” 21–22). One can only speculate on how differently Wordsworth might have been perceived if he had been known by this poem rather than The Excursion.\n\n50. For the relation between music and the body in Nietzsche and Kristeva, see Tilottama Rajan, “Language, Music, and the Body,” 147–69.\n\n51. John Crowe Ransom, “Criticism, Inc.,” 349; idem, “Humanism at Chicago,” 100–101; idem, The New Criticism, 25, 267–75.\n\n52. Keach, Shelley’s Style, xii-xiii. Keach is actually quoting from Frederick Pottle, “The Case of Shelley,” PMLA 67 (1952): 601; and David Perkins, The Quest for Permanence (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1965), 168.\n\n53. Keach, Shelley’s Style, 80, and more generally, 79–183.\n\n54. Benjamin, The Concept of Criticism, 129; Gasché, “The Sober Absolute,” 57.\n\n55. Gasché, The Tain of the Mirror, 13–22. Gasché’s critique of Romantic reflection both here and in “The Sober Absolute” places him in a long line of thinkers who have reservations about “romantic irony” from Hegel to Karl Schmitt. In a disciplinary sense, his outlining of absolute or speculative reflection in Hegel configures speculative philosophy in such a way as to make it more analytically acceptable, whether or not Hegel himself fully achieves this goal (35ff.).\n\n56. I am not using the term extensiveness here in the same sense as Tate’s extension, which involves, as Murray Krieger argues, “the precision of [a poem’s] denotations as well as the inevitable pattern of its logical relations,” both of which are sacrificed by intension (The New Apologists for Poetry [Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1963], 147).\n\n57. Agamben, The Idea of Prose, 40–41.\n\n58. Gasché, The Tain of the Mirror, 16.\n\n59. Agamben, The Idea of Prose, 40. Strictly speaking enjambment is the completion, in the next line, of a clause or grammatical unit begun in the previous line. But for Agamben the pause, or “caesura,” also creates a certain holding back or recursiveness.\n\n60. Maurice Blanchot, “Sleep, Night” and “Orpheus’ Gaze,” in The Space of Literature, 265, 171.\n\n61. Tilottama Rajan, “Romanticism and the Death of Lyric Consciousness,” 198–200.\n\n62. Thus the Narrator writes of the Poet: “Many a wide waste and tangled wilderness / Has lured his fearless steps” (78–79; see also 107). The echo of Wordsworth is symptomatic, but the effect is actually the opposite, since Shelley uses the “has” to break the continuity of the simple past tense and introduce a sense of a past that repeats itself as we read the poem.\n\n63. Ricoeur, “Narrative and Hermeneutics,” 152.\n\n64. The doubling of the Poet’s story has not generally been noticed. However, Thomas Weiskel suggests that the Poet’s journey falls into “two phases, an upward, regressive journey to origins (ll.222–468), and a downward course, following a river that is meant to image the progress of his life” (The Romantic Sublime, 146).\n\n65. J. Hillis Miller, Fiction and Repetition, 6.\n\n66. Harold Bloom, “The Internalization of Quest Romance,” 13–36.\n\n67. Blanchot, “Death as Possibility,” in The Space of Literature, 104.\n\n68.

By “distinct” Nancy does not mean the clear as opposed to the indistinct. The distinct, as he explains, “is distinct according to these two modes: it does not touch, and it is dissimilar” (2).\n\n71. Agamben, Infancy and History, 82.\n\n72. Nancy, The Ground of the Image, 2–3.\n\n73. For a more detailed discussion of how Keats works through the contradictions between Classical and Romantic or, one could say, objective and subjective images of the writer, see my discussion of the poem in Dark Interpreter, 169–71, 186–203, and also in “Keats, Poetry, and ‘The Absence of the Work,’” 346–51.\n\n74. Nancy, The Ground of the Image, 2.\n\n75. Ibid., 2–3.\n\n76. Blanchot, “Orpheus’ Gaze,” in The Space of Literature, 171.\n\n77. Ibid., 172. Blanchot comments that to “kill oneself is to mistake one death for the other”: to mistake the death “that is not linked to me by any relation of any sort” and “toward which I do not direct myself” for the “power that has its source in the end” and is correlated with “freedom” and “possibility” (“Death as Possibility,” 95, 100, 104).\n\n78. Mary Shelley included Alastor in her Posthumous Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley because it had gone out of print. But although she included other poems for the same reason, in her 1839 “Note on Alastor” she does also confer on it a certain posthumousness by associating it with “the death which he had often contemplated during the last months as certain and near” (in Percy Bysshe Shelley, Poetical Works, ed. Thomas Hutchinson, 31). Further citations from Mary Shelley’s Prefaces and notes are from this edition.\n\n79. Neil Fraistat, “Shelley Left and Right,” 106, 108. In a different turn on this reduction of Shelley to lyric, Julie Carlson argues that Shelley, in an attempt to transcend life, life-writing, and his “embeddedness” within his literary family, constructs himself as the “Poet” and specifically the lyric Poet, thus “intentional[ly] and inadvertent[ly]” eclipsing the reputations of Godwin, Wollstonecraft, and Mary Shelley, “an eclipse that holds to this day” (England’s First Family of Writers, 257–60). I am completely in agreement with the broader goals of Carlson’s important study, which tries to retrieve the writers in her title as “England’s first family” by disturbing the “idealization of lyric” as a definition of classic romanticism” and by valorizing various forms of life-writing and subjectivity that have not been recognized by the New Criticism, deconstruction, or cultural studies. But it will be obvious that I take a different view of Percy Shelley’s place in this family.\n\n80.

The phrase “retrait du politique” is used by Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe and Jean-Luc Nancy to describe a form of the political intimately connected to philosophy but one that retreats from the total “domination” of the contemporary scene by the political and its reification as “politics” (Retreating the Political, ed. Simon Sparks, 95–99). As Simon Sparks explains in his “Introduction: Politica ficta,” this retrait is not a “simple withdrawal” but is “a matter of the effacement of any assignable and specific meaning” to the political, which, “accompanying and operating on the basis of the first sense of the retreat as the withdrawal of meaning, ‘would thus retrace the contours of this specificity, whose actual conditions would need to be reinvented’” (xxv-vii).\n\n86. Mary Shelley, “Preface to Posthumous Poems,” xii; “Preface to First Edition,” xi. Note also her description of the world’s reaction to Shelley’s death in the 1839 Preface: “He died, and the world showed no outward sign” (xi); and in the 1824 Preface: “The ungrateful world did not feel his loss, and the gap it made seemed to close as quickly over his memory as the murderous sea above his living frame” (xiii).\n\n87. Ranita Chatterjee uses the term “psychonarration” in taking up my discussion of “autonarration” in my article (an early and different version of chapter 3 of this book) “Autonarration and Genotext in Mary Hays’ Memoirs of Emma Courtney,” 149–76. Psychonarration, as she defines it, is a process midway between the libidinal and the discursive, wherein material is circulated between “partial subjects who are intimately invested in each other,” such that their texts refer to “other published texts written by family members”—or, one could add, by members of a literary community. The consequence of both auto- and psychonarration is that texts “are not stable objects to be understood; they are sites for author-readers to produce themselves as narrative” (“Filial Ties,” 30–32).\n\n88. Mary Jacobus, Psychoanalysis and the Scene of Reading, 168, 197, 199; Tilottama Rajan, “Mary Shelley’s Mathilda,” 43–68. Jacobus’s reading takes up my analysis of the text’s negativity but suggests that for me “Matilda’s resistance and negativity ultimately remain just that: unproductive and unusable” because I see the text as unreadable, an aesthetic failure (167–68). On the contrary, I see the text’s failure as its power, and although my essay does not give poetry the attention that Jacobus does, our readings are fundamentally in accord. To read a text as unreadable is still to read it, but the point about “unusable negativity” in Bataille’s and Blanchot’s sense is precisely that one must be careful not to economize it within a genre or protocol of reading, a care that Jacobus indeed takes in arguing that the “enigmatic poetics of pathological mourning brings psychoanalysis and poetry into the same room with the phantom of analytic failure” (165). Where the style of our readings differs is that mine is more focused on what Jacobus calls the “buried parental secret” and its incommunicability, and hers is more focused on poetry or lyric as the “bearer” of that secret (165).\n\n89. Jacobus, Psychoanalysis and the Scene of Reading, 165, 197. In citing Jacobus, who tacitly identifies lyric and poetry, I do not mean to conflate the two in the case of Mary any more than in the case of Percy Shelley. For Mary Shelley, too, lyricism is simply the shell or signifier of a “poetry” that has yet to be grasped, even as it is also a specific capacity to “listen” or “hear” that poetry. Implicit in Jacobus’s association of lyric with listening is a claim about its importance to psychoanalysis. But if poetry is an anagram for psychoanalysis, narrativity is as important to this poetry as lyric.\n\n90. Dubrow, The Challenges of Orpheus, 12. Dubrow discusses the various mythological figures who have been used to thematize lyric, including Orpheus, Arion, Amphion, and Pan (18–26). She specifically discusses Amphion and Orpheus in the context of the ability to move “rocks and stones” (19).\n\nChapter 2: Shelley’s Promethean Narratives\n\n1. All parenthetical references are to Percy Bysshe Shelley, “Zastrozzi” and “St. Irvyne,” ed. Stephen C. Behrendt.\n\n2. My decision to discuss the earlier novels after the later Alastor, while logical in a book largely oriented to prose, is obviously at odds with the chrono-logic of Shelley’s corpus. It can easily have the counterintuitive effect of making the novels seem more “mature” than the poem. It is important to remember that if the novels are the first site of Shelley’s uneasiness about a pure poetry, which is often attributed to him, they are written in a form that also deconstructs “prose” as an alternative to poetry. Beneath this construction of prose as a self-consuming artifact, in other words, lies what will subsequently emerge as a pressure to reimagine poetry in a way that will not reduce it to the clichés to which it is nervously reduced in Shelley’s anticipatory echoes of his later work.\n\n3. According to Stephen Behrendt (in an e mail correspondence), the copies brought out in 1822 were probably ones that remained from the original print run.\n\n4. As Žižek explains, “deep ecology” can take two forms, both of which remain powerfully anthropocentric despite their claims to the contrary. On the one hand is a seemingly “anti-anthropocentric Spinozian Deep Ecology, for which all forms of life are strictly equivalent, so that the rights of all elements of a biosphere, rivers and rocks included, have ultimately the same weight as the rights of man.” On the other hand is a “New Age animist spiritualism, which conceives of the entire universe as a living organism whose development has culminated in man, its Omega-point, its steward-guardian,” and which thus claims to stand “on the brink of a new cosmo-spiritual alteration which will deliver man from his narrow egoism and bring about a new solidarity of Life.” But in both cases the very demand that deep ecology “addresses to man to sacrifice himself for the entire biosphere confers on him the exceptional status of universal being.” Žižek’s critique seems particularly pertinent to the last act of Prometheus Unbound (“Of Cells and Selves,” in The Žižek Reader, ed. Elizabeth Wright and Edmond Wright, 304–5).\n\n5. Jürgen Habermas, Philosophical-Political Profiles, 71.\n\n6. Julia Kristeva, “The Adolescent Novel,” 8–11, 22.\n\n7. Ibid., 21.\n\n8. G. W. F.

Associating adolescence with the advent of the symbol (in the sense of a certain distancing and self-consciousness), Kristeva disagrees with what she says is Hanna Segal’s view (linked to Melanie Klein but also to Freud’s theory of mourning), that the symbol comes out of the “depressive” position. She suggests that symbolic activity also “sustains itself” “from a manic position” (11). Both Segal and Kristeva allude here to Klein’s three-part schema, in which the paranoid-schizoid position gives way to the depressive position, as a turning inward that also involves a taking stock and greater realism: a withdrawal of hysterical projections, which then leads to reparation. However, Segal’s account of symbolic activity in terms of object-relations theory is far more complex than Kristeva allows. Segal begins by noting that “Klein links symbolism with projection and identification” and “agrees with Sandor Ferenczi that symbolism starts with projection of parts of the infant’s own body into the object.” However, she goes on to distinguish two kinds of “symbolic function.” One is “symbolic equation,” which “underlies schizophrenic concrete thinking” and in which “the symbol is so equated with the object that the two are felt to be identical.” In this form of symbolic activity “boundaries are lost” and “part of the ego is confused with the object.” In “symbolic representation,” however, “the symbol represents the object but is not entirely equated with it.” It is “with the advent of the depressive position, the experience of separateness, separation and loss, that symbolic representation comes into play,” as “projective identifications” are withdrawn, and there is a “greater awareness of one’s own psychic reality and the difference between internal and external” (“Symbolism,” 35, 38, 40). I want to suggest that the fetishism of symbolic equation characterizes what Hegel calls the Symbolic; the Romantic, by contrast, deploys symbolic representation.\n\n10.

The question of whether the novels were initially “intended” as seriously as we might take them in the light of Shelley’s later work is, to my mind, a red herring for the purposes of this argument. If one must determine intention, what Shelley is doing in these texts operates in a grey area somewhere between blindness and insight. But more important is the fact that the novels have self-reflexive effects, especially when read in relation to Shelley’s larger corpus. Moreover, a deconstruction of cultural norms is embedded in the Gothic genre as Shelley receives it, again at a level that is between blindness and insight, and that has to do with the symptomatic role of the genre as a whole in culture rather than with the intention of any single author.\n\n21. Slavoj Žižek, The Plague of Fantasies, 35. As Žižek comments, perversion has an “intermediate status … between psychosis and neurosis, between the psychotic’s foreclosure of the Law and the neurotic’s integration into the Law” (34).\n\n22.

The concept of non-synchronicity or uneven development was introduced, though in a less theoretical and structural way, by Ernst Bloch in “Nonsynchronism and the Obligation to Its Dialectics,” 22–38.\n\n25. Fredric Jameson, The Political Unconscious, 29, 32, 37, 39. Jameson’s point contra Althusser is that structural causality is still a practice of mediation, because the concept of semiautonomy still “relate[s]” as much as it “separates” the parts or levels (41).\n\n26. Ibid., 77. Jameson uses “imaginary” and “symbolic” resolution somewhat interchangeably (e.g., 77, 80, 252). The terms do, nevertheless, refer to different aspects of the Lacanian triad of the Imaginary, the Symbolic, and the Real, which I will capitalize when referring to Lacan. We could therefore think of a symbolic resolution as a false resolution of contradictions imposed by the “Symbolic” order of family and kinship, Emma Courtney’s marriage to Montague in Mary Hays’s Memoirs of Emma Courtney being an example. An imaginary resolution, by contrast, would be a fantasized resolution, such as the union of Prometheus and Asia in Prometheus Unbound.\n\n27.

In the final chapter Zastrozzi mockingly asks Matilda: “Did you think it was from friendship I instructed you to gain Verezzi?” He goes on to disclose that it was he who led Julia to Matilda’s house, “foreseeing the effect it would have upon the strong passions of your husband” (155–56).\n\n33.

Wolfstein is “the heir of a wealthy potentate in Germany” (113) but also the brother of Eloise, whose home, St. Irvyne, is in France (185). Moreover, when he meets Ginotti again and hears his story, he seems to be in Bohemia, where he has gone to claim the estate of his uncle (165), but at the end of the story Ginotti expects Wolfstein to meet him at midnight in France (185).\n\n40. Žižek, The Sublime Object of Ideology, 87.\n\n41. As Steven Bruhm suggests in discussing the tortured body in Shelley and Godwin, Zastrozzi’s body finally remains “unreadable,” even though the violent explicitness of the ending apparently reverses the earlier treatment of him, in which he is always masked and obscure. For where the Gothic departs from a sentimental aesthetic in which the “body broadcasts an internal state” and where torture therefore violently tries to “get inside” the unreadable Gothic body, Zastrozzi’s body remains a “shield, an impediment to the truth.” Bruhm also points out that the inquiry-by-torture comes after Zastrozzi’s confession (Gothic Bodies, 101–3). As in Caleb Williams, in which Falkland is put on trial after the reader has found him guilty, the effect is to render the logic of judgment that subtends the genre of the Novel incoherent.\n\n42.

The suggestion is made by L. J. Zillman in Shelley’s Prometheus Unbound, 12.\n\n48. More specifically, the manuscript comprises three notebooks. MS EI begins with act 4 on the right-hand side of the page and continues to line 427. At this point Shelley begins act 1 on the left-hand pages and continues to insert the rest of act 4 on the right-hand side. This notebook ends in the middle of the scene involving the Furies. MS E2 begins with the remainder of act 1 on the left-hand side. Several pages on the right side are left blank, and it is not until he reaches the middle of act 2 scene 2 that Shelley returns to his eccentric practice of dividing the text between left and right sides of the notebook. Having placed all of the dialogue between Asia and Panthea (2.1) and part of the next scene involving the Semichorus of Spirits (2.2.1–63) on the left side, Shelley suddenly switches the remainder of 2.2 to the right side. Thus the first part of 2.3 (Asia’s dialogue with Panthea as they approach the volcano) is placed on the left side beside the remainder of 2.2 (the dialogue between the Fauns: ll.64ff.). The second half of 2.2 does not occupy as much space as the first half of 2.3, so Shelley leaves one of the right-hand pages blank as he continues scene 3 up to the end of the sisters’ conversation prior to their entry into the Cave of Demogorgon (2.3.53). The remainder of 2.3 is now shifted from the left to the right side. Thus the crucial interview between Asia and Demogorgon (2.4) now occupies the left side, while the remainder of scene 3 (the Song of the Spirits: ll.54ff.) is placed opposite it. Finally, MS E3, which is far simpler, begins at 2.4.124 and continues straightforwardly to the end of act 3, sometimes, but not always, leaving the left-hand pages blank for corrections.\n\n49. C. D.

Mary Hays, Appeal to the Men of Great Britain, 70, 67.\n\n2. Though he was not romantically interested in Hays, Frend had taken the initiative in approaching her, praising her maiden publication Cursory Remarks (1791), published under the pseudonym “Eusebia,” after it was attacked in a highly gendered way by Gilbert Wakefield.

Further references to the novel and the letters are from this edition and will be given parenthetically in the text, with references to the novel being indicated by M, and references to the letters being indicated by “L.”\n\n8. The epitext according to Gerard Genette is that part of the paratext that is “at least originally” located at some distance from the book,” in interviews, conversations, and private communications (Paratexts, 5).\n\n9. See, for instance, Claire Tomalin, The Life and Death of Mary Wollstonecraft, 241, 245; James Foster, History of the Pre-Romantic Novel in England, 259–60. Another example of the automatic dismissal of Hays is provided by Allene Gregory, who deals with Hays by absorbing her into Godwin, despite her concession that the novel by Godwin to which Memoirs bears a “striking resemblance” was published much later (The French Revolution and the English Novel, 223).\n\n10. William Godwin, “Of Choice in Reading,” 132–33, 136–38. I discuss this essay in the next chapter. Godwin’s essay was published in the same year as Hays’s novel. It is hard to know whether she had read the essay, and the word “tendency,” though most rigorously theorized by Godwin, was widely used.\n\n11. I use the word “error” as Stanley Corngold does, when he writes that “Error is not mistake”; instead error is a constitutive, creative misprision, a trope, so that “the skew of error implies a truth” (“Error in Paul de Man,” 92).\n\n12. Collected Letters of Mary Wollstonecraft, ed. Ralph M. Wardle, 376.\n\n13. Rachel Blau DuPlessis argues that nineteenth-century novels about/by women uniformly end in the heroine’s recontainment through marriage or death (Writing beyond the Ending, 1–4).\n\n14. I use this term in the sense used by Lacan and Kristeva, to indicate the order in which we are constructed as speaking subjects: the order of syntax, which is also the order of law and family. This order is “Symbolic” in the sense that the individual’s identity within it is always other: a representation of her as something else, for and by someone else.\n\n15. Sometime late in 1795 Godwin suggested that Hays set down the thoughts she had communicated to him in her letters in a work of fiction, and she agreed on condition that he read her work. In January 1796 Hays then asked Frend to return her letters because she wanted to incorporate them in a work of fiction. He did not reply. Hays tells Godwin, in a letter of February 6, 1796, that she has “only some imperfect copies of the papers in question” (L, 245). In other words, it seems that she kept drafts of at least some of the letters for re-citation. She did, of course, have access to the letters she had written to Godwin.\n\n16. Augustus’s phrasing is ambiguous enough that it might refer to a social “engagement” (157) that has prevented him from answering Emma’s importunate letters more promptly. But the word “attachment” used of a social engagement is surely odd enough to suggest that he is, in a veiled way, trying to alert Emma to his situation.\n\n17.

Hays refused to divulge Frend’s identity to Godwin, but she is referring here to her decision to move into her own apartment when her family decided to move farther away from London, which would have meant being at a greater distance from Frend.\n\n21.

The phrase is Kristeva’s (R, 210). The translation reflects the double meaning of the French “en procès.”\n\n28.

But in the novel Francis is not given this immunity from public scrutiny.\n\n29. Sigmund Freud, “Psychopathic Characters on Stage,” 7:308–10.\n\n30. I refer here to Coleridge’s poem “Constancy to an Ideal Object” (1825?), in The Complete Poetical Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, 455–56. Hays herself also uses the phrase “a purely ideal object” (L, 251).\n\n31. Slavoj Žižek, The Sublime Object of Ideology, 74–76. “Enjoyment,” it is necessary to point out, is not the best translation of “jouissance,” which is as much painful as pleasurable: what Nietzsche in The Birth of Tragedy calls the original “oneness,” its “pain” and “contradiction” (25, 33).\n\n32. Note the frequent use of certain proto-Romantic words and concepts: “image” and “imagination” (M, 55, 86), “ideal” or “romantic” (81, 92, 110, 114, 132), and “visionary” (81, 114).\n\n33.

My interest here is in the word “corpus” and the distinction Foucault makes, but I will continue to use the word “archive” as he uses it in “Fantasia of the Library” (1967). Indeed, Foucault’s later use of “archive” is a disciplining and repression of his earlier and more radical use of it to include what Derrida calls the archiviolithic (Archive Fever, 10). Derrida’s reference in Archive Fever to “burn[ing] the archive” harks back to Foucault’s earlier “conflagration of the archive,” in 1967. However, in the silent debate between Derrida and the later Foucault, Archive Fever (1995) is a critique of Foucault’s use of the term in The Archeology of Knowledge (1969), as well as a critique of his genealogical work, especially his various lectures at the Collège de France, which in effect submit to habitus and the process of institution by being purely descriptive. Derrida is tacitly recalling this later Foucault’s use of “archive” to mean a set of practices when he refers to the archive superintended by the archons as consisting of the “documents” that “in effect speak the law … recall the law and call on or impose the law.” The archive in this sense “forgets” the “memory which it shelters” (2) and must become the object of an “archiviology” (34) rather than a genealogy.\n\n41. Walker, Mary Hays, 134.\n\n42. Seymour Chatman, Story and Discourse, 9.\n\n43. Fredric Jameson, The Political Unconscious, 35, 81–82.\n\n44. Augustus refers to Emma as his sister (M, 100, 105), the role which Mrs. Harley also assigns her (101, 183), even though she also imagines them as husband and wife (103), thus marking the incestuous and forbidden nature of this union within the terms of the Symbolic order. Similarly, Emma Jr. and Augustus Jr. are brought up as brother and sister (220), this brother-sister “incest” signifying a typically Romantic and impossible union of the self with what is most like itself.\n\n45. Walker, Mary Hays, 112.\n\n46. The scandalous memoirs are discussed by Felicity Nussbaum, who describes them as the first significant form of women’s self-writing other than spiritual autobiography (180). Nussbaum sees the scandalous memoirists as confirming and resisting the dominant ideology, further noting the conflicted position of these writers, given the relegation of “unlicensed sexuality to the lower classes” (179). I would further argue that the memoirists’ identification of desire with sexuality aborts the emergent radicalism of their texts and that Hays’s representation of a love that is and is not sexual is a way of retaining her right to address a middle-class liberal audience.\n\n47. Jacques Derrida, Archive Fever, 11.\n\n48. In “The Adolescent Novel” Kristeva might seem to take a different view of narrative as revolt and polymorphous perversity. However, this essay can still be summed up by her statement in Revolution that the “subjectal structure” of narrative, while producing an “infinite” series of “‘masks’ and protagonists corresponding to the signifying process’ abutments against parental and social structures,” is still “locked in place to the extent that the parental and social network is applied to it” (91).\n\n49. The Imaginary and the Symbolic can be seen as different ways of relating to an identity that is always already specular. In the Imaginary the subject identifies with the image (or imago) in the mirror. In the Symbolic she is uneasily aware of it as a representation.\n\n50.

Another example of this motif is Matthew Arnold’s poem “Tristan and Iseult,” in which the dark, passionate Iseult is repeated as Tristan’s paler, fairer, and more domestic second love. Arnold’s poem parallels Victorian novels such as David Copperfield in its linking of repetition to the domestication of the Romantic, the conversion of revolutionary energy into evolutionary caution.\n\n54.

Francis and Emma meet before she meets Augustus, but he is called to London and suggests a correspondence. After the unraveling of her friendship with Augustus, Francis is attentive to her during her “sickness of the soul” (M, 166, 179), but when Mrs. Harley dies and Emma finds herself in need of help, it turns out Francis has abruptly left on a continental tour (191).

This destruction becomes the unconscious back-cloth for love of a real object” (94). The point is valid but elides the legitimacy of the self-love involved in bad feelings.\n\n67. Walker, Mary Hays, 64–65, 133.\n\n68. This mourning frames the text, since Maria’s separation from her daughter is the occasion for her imprisonment and subsequent woeful tale. But one could also argue that Maria can only move on to become a political subject once the daughter and associated motherhood plot are out of the way.\n\n69. I understand the term “wounded masculine” to mean at once that part of the female psyche that is both disallowed from accessing its “masculine” potential and forced to grasp that potential in warped ways; and that part of the male psyche that is warped into certain forms of masculinity as well as resistance to such forms, such that it, too, is disallowed from accessing its “feminine” potential. The wounded masculine, in other words, is an androgynous concept but in the mode of negativity.\n\n70. Mary Hays, Letters and Essays, Moral and Miscellaneous, 92.\n\n71. In addition to the letters already cited, which focus on Caleb and Falkland as parallels for Emma’s strong passions, Gina Luria Walker also argues that Hays’s second novel, The Victim of Prejudice, devises “an alternative story for Godwin’s character, Emily Melville.” It revisits a subplot of Caleb Williams so as to retrieve from Emily’s death a strength that Godwin allows her, without quite recognizing it (Walker, Mary Hays, 191–93).\n\n72. The phrase is used by Godwin himself in arguing that Wollstonecraft, as a subject still in process, should not be judged according to her character “pro tempore” (Memoirs of the Author of “A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,” 82).\n\n73.

Janet Gezari, Charlotte Brontë and Defensive Conduct, 33–34.\n\n78. Peter Melville Logan, Nerves and Narrative, 72. Although Logan does here present the text as unresolved, in general his reading closes down its narrativity by sharply distinguishing the older from the younger Emma and by focusing on the narrative frame, which he sees both as “making it clear from the start that the narrative is a cautionary tale” and as “discarding an agency based on sexuality” associated with the earlier Emma and “substituting one based on reproduction” (65, 70). This reading, in turn, is based on a depreciation of the younger Emma’s desire, which assumes that her desire is identical with her sexuality rather than that this sexuality is itself a trope. While the older Emma’s turning upon her younger self is thus painful, according to Logan, at least this new “voice,” however “tentative and unstable, is nonetheless more substantial than the fiction of agency in the younger Emma’s illusions” (72).\n\n79. Virginia Woolf, A Room of One’s Own, 70–74.\n\nChapter Four: The Scene of Judgment\n\n1. William Godwin, Enquiry Concerning Political Justice, 1.2. Hereafter cited as PJ.\n\n2. Foucault uses the term “governmentality” to describe the techniques by which individuals are rendered as governable subjects. Insofar as governmentality extends even to such apparently private and subjective matters as acts of kindness, his use is clearly anticipated by Godwin’s use of the term “government” (Michel Foucault, “What Is Critique?” 156).\n\n3. According to Robinson Godwin can serve as “an excellent bridge between the two hostile systems of empiricism and German idealism.” Kant is an avowed “Republican,” and his system has had “a vast effect in freeing the Mind from all shackles of prejudice—-Revelation, forms of Government, all are criticised” (Crabb Robinson in Germany, 105, 113). Despite their profound affinity, which will be pursued further in the next chapter, it is impossible to know whether Godwin read Kant, which he probably could not have done by the time of the first edition of Political Justice, since Kant was first translated only in 1798. On the knowledge of Kant in England, see René Wellek, Immanuel Kant in England, 1793–1838. Wellek mentions Baader’s interest in Godwin during the period of his interest in Kant (28).\n\n4. Immanuel Kant, Critique of the Power of Judgment (1790), 66–67. David Collings also discusses Godwin alongside Kant in one of the best articles on Godwin, “The Romance of the Impossible,” 850–54. Collings, however, focuses on the uncompromising stance of the Kantian categorical imperative as read through Lacan on Kant and Sade, rather than on the micrological nuances of judgment. While distinguishing Godwin’s ethics from Kant’s, he also sees in Godwin’s “determination to liberate his society from unreason, whether people want him to or not,” a similar “violence” and “aggression” on the part of pure reason (853–54). Nevertheless, while constructing Godwin as a fanatic rather than a sceptic in Political Justice, Collings does also see Godwin’s “experience of writing” as contradicting “his claims about immutable reason,” particularly as he unravels the first into the second ending of Caleb Williams, thus performing a kind of autocritique of himself as Caleb in the process of writing (859). As will be apparent, my reading of the novel, while also assigning the revised ending the role of an autocritique, differs in the level of intentionality it attributes to Godwin and in reading the second ending as more than a negative, (self)critical moment.\n\n5. By contrast Kant, in “What Is Enlightenment?” (1786), does seem to separate conscience from conduct when he gives the example of the soldier who, as a “private” individual, must obey orders, although in his “public” role as a scholar he cannot be prevented from criticizing the government (“To Perpetual Peace” and Other Essays, 42–43). Kant’s use of the terms “private” and “public” is the opposite of Godwin’s more normal usage and thus may contain a veiled irony. While Kant’s position is different from that of Godwin, one should not too easily jump to the conclusion that Kant’s distinction between public and private is a form of temporizing. For as Derrida emphasizes, Kant saw censorship as a “critique that has power” (Eyes of the University, 46); in other words, the censorship imposed on the private individual is a necessary part of the debate that must occur in the public sphere over what would otherwise be enthusiasm.\n\n6.

Immanuel Kant, Essays and Treatises on Moral, Political, and Various Philosophical Subjects.\n\n9. Jacques Derrida, Negotiations, 242.\n\n10. I would limit Derrida’s criticism to The Critique of Pure Reason. As I have argued elsewhere, in the first Critique Kant deals only with transcendental ideas and thus focuses on the distance of the idea(l) from actuality. He concentrates on two things: on the idea as operating on the side of freedom because it transcends experience, and on the dangers of hypostatizing this idea through an identification of representation with reality (CPR, 219–21, 373–75). In the Third Critique, however, Kant deals with “aesthetic” and “rational” ideas, and thus with the difference within these ideas now rather than their distance from the real (CJ, 192–95). For a fuller discussion, see Tilottama Rajan, “Toward a Cultural Idealism,” 51–72.\n\n11. On the one hand, anarchy “awakens thought,” but on the other, Godwin sees it as a threat to personal security that may result in the counterreaction of despotism (PJ, 2.368–70). Though Godwin’s discussion of anarchy is largely critical, as he points out, all peoples were “in a state of anarchy, that is, without government, previously to their being in a state of policy” (1.371): thus there may be nothing intrinsically wrong with anarchy, and its effects and desirability may vary depending on the state a particular society was in before it fell into anarchy (2.370–71). Of course, Godwin’s concern about anarchy is not necessarily a dismissal of anarchism. The contemporary tradition of thinking about justice to which I link him here is often described as “pre-original” or “anarchic” in the root sense of going back before any arche, foundation, or institution of thought. Nevertheless, if Godwin believes philosophically in anarchism (and has therefore been seen as a founding thinker of anarchism), it is still the case that he is practically ambivalent about it. Hence I suggest that Godwin’s anarchism is better thought of as the absence of institution than as an actual practice or “ism.”\n\n12. Jacques Derrida, Negotiations, 242.\n\n13. William Godwin, “Of History and Romance,” in Caleb Williams, 466–67.

Interestingly, towards the end of the first volume Caleb starts putting Collins’ narration in quotation marks: “I shall endeavour to state the remainder of this narrative in the words of Mr. Collins” (166). It would seem that Caleb at first makes himself the narrator of Falkland’s story in order to claim an inside view of his patron, but he then returns the narration to Collins in order to mark his (Caleb’s) difference from Falkland. After the conclusion of that part of Falkland’s history that falls outside the diegesis, Falkland becomes a character in Caleb’s story. The point is that Falkland’s story is always mediated through Caleb.\n\n19. Angela Esterhammer, “Godwin’s Suspicion of Speech Acts,” 554–56.\n\n20. Jean-François Lyotard, The Differend, 151, 1.\n\n21. Godwin, Preface to Fleetwood, 448; idem, Preface to Cloudesley, 7.\n\n22. Lyotard’s word for “event” is “événement,” which in contemporary French philosophy signifies a “now” with an explosive surplus of affect/effect, which cannot be placed within a syntagm (such as plot, which is a form of causality and thus rationality). An event is something like a “happening.” In the passage cited, Lyotard’s word for what is rendered in the English translation as “narrative” is actually “récit” (story). While his initial account of récit as containing a number of differends is closer to my definition of “narrative,” his account of the genre as closing down this difference is consistent with his use of the term récit and my use of the word story (Lyotard, Le Différend, 218–19).\n\n23. Shlomith Rimmon-Keenan, Narrative Fiction, 15–16.\n\n24. See, for instance, CW, 59, 145, 179, 184, 210, 216, 235, 246, 254, 403, 431, 432. Godwin, it should be noted, does not himself distinguish “narrative” in the way I am doing from tale and story (e.g., 210). However, as is indicated by descriptions such as “unanswerable” (St. Leon, 188), “plain and unadulterated,” and “artless and manly” (CW, 431, 432), Godwin does associate “tale” and “story” with a certain feigned unity and integrity.\n\n25. Gavin Edwards takes up Godwin’s use of the terms “character” and “story,” noting his uneasiness with the “narrative idea” but insisting that Godwin is in the end “committed to this idiom himself” (“William Godwin’s Foreign Language,” 542). Edwards argues that character for Godwin is not interiority but a representation of oneself or perception of oneself within the public sphere (540–41), in other words, a form of institution. Nevertheless, he sees Godwin as wanting to distinguish a true from a false story, a true from a false character (544), and suggests that in the published ending of the novel Caleb “succeeds” in vindicating his character (546). Of particular interest is a passage from Political Justice that Edwards cites, which succinctly articulates character as a principle of totalization and predictability that facilitates the seamless operation of judgment: “The character of any man, is the result of a long series of impressions, communicated to his mind and modifying it in a certain manner, so as to enable us … to predict his conduct” (PJ 1.370). Yet Godwin is quite clear at the beginning of the text that such character is the effect of “political institution” on a “ductile,” impressionable “substance” (1.26, 47), and indeed his Humean epistemology is what allows for his relentless probing, in his fiction, of character as an index of the fantasies a culture has about itself.\n\n26.

The trial in both versions is not a jury trial or a public trial with attorneys as in The Wrongs of Woman, but a hearing at the house of the magistrate, designed “to find a medium between the suspicious air of a private examination and the indelicacy, as it was styled, of an examination exposed to the remark of every casual spectator” (426). In the original ending the magistrate does intervene (436, 438). In the revised ending, he does not speak at all.\n\n36. Pamela Clemit, The Godwinian Novel, 64.\n\n37.

Lyotard in “The Sign of History” (408) describes the French Revolution as a hypotyposis, which Kant defines as a figure for a “concept which only reason can think, and to which no sensible intuition can be adequate” (CJ, 225). A paralogism occurs when an argument unfolds logically but is based on a groundless presupposition. For a discussion of paralogism in Kant and Lyotard, see the next chapter. As Antonio Negri says, “the only justification for the hypothetical, hypostatic falsity of the paralogism is that it follows on from a real and irrepressible need” (The Constitution of Time, 37).\n\n40.

Faflak’s reading of Caleb Williams is very different from my own, in that Faflak sees Godwin as nervously complicit with the “enlightenment” of psychoanalysis as a form of moral management, and he argues that “whatever knowledge” Godwin’s novel produces simply “preys on itself” in the form of an interminable analysis for its own sake, which becomes predictable and ultimately evasive of the novel’s traumatic core (118–19).\n\n45.

The term “affinity” had traditionally meant the attraction of like for like. It was only later that it came to mean the attraction between opposites, or in the nineteenth century, between electronegative and electropositive substances, leading to decomposition (Trevor Levere, Transforming Matter, 35, 89).\n\n47. William Godwin, Fleetwood, 268. MacNeil’s behavior is consistently puzzling. Even though he seems to have the perfect family, he unaccountably decides to set sail for Italy with his wife and two of his daughters. When the boat capsizes, the captain is able to save two passengers, but MacNeil decides that the entire family should perish together, even though he has left one daughter, Mary, behind (267–68). Not only does the drowning fulfil a death wish, but it seems as if Macneil wants to render Mary an orphan.\n\n48. See Tilottama Rajan, “Mary Shelley’s Mathilda,” 52–54.\n\n49.

It is significant here that Godwin makes Henrietta the ineffectual mouthpiece for the utopian side of necessitarianism when he has her say: “Consider that man … is just what his nature and his circumstances have made him.… He is to be pitied therefore, not regarded with hatred; to be considered with indulgence, not made an object of revenge; to be reclaimed with mildness, to be gradually inspired with confidence” (153).\n\n53.

As foreigners, the St. Leon family are excluded from the compensation afforded by the government when they lose their few possessions in a storm and are “reduced … to the necessity of a second emigration” (96–97). Switzerland is thus for Godwin, unlike Williams, an example of the continued “coercive regulations” of government (97).\n\n5. Thomas Kavanagh, Enlightenment and the Shadows of Chance, 44, 47. Kavanagh convincingly analyses ancien régime gambling in terms of Marcel Mauss’s theory of the gift, as a way of not imposing on it “a set of concepts and values that were themselves generated by the emerging bourgeoisie as weapons in their campaign … to discredit the ethos of the traditional nobility.” He writes that the “all but universal condemnation of gambling now subscribed to with surprisingly equal enthusiasm by the voices of the social sciences and of common sense forecloses any real understanding of what that practice represented in the context of the eighteenth century” (62). But we might add that what that practice represented in novels such as The Mysteries of Udolpho, which contain scenes of gambling, is the double bankruptcy both of ancien régime and bourgeois values.\n\n6. Thomas M. Lennon, Reading Bayle, 153–62.\n\n7. Kavanagh, Enlightenment, 67. Kavanagh argues that Law’s scheme cleverly got round the French nobles’ resistance to printing money and worked on their attachment to land. However, land had been at the core of his economic theory from 1705 onwards. Law was well aware of the dangers of inflation or devaluation in changing the equivalence between money and GDP; he was not an advocate of credit in the sense of pure promise: “Credit that promises a Payment of money, cannot well be extended beyond a certain proportion it ought to have with the Money” (Money and Trade, 60). His scheme of backing money with land actually aimed to increase the supply of money so as to draw out potential in the economy, which was currently untapped through unemployment, but without the dangers of inflation, since land, as he saw it, was there, would not decrease in quantity, and unlike metal, could be used as money while still being used for agriculture (45–51, 60, 90–93). The irony is that, although the land was there in Scotland, the land Law used as backing in America was not there (or was not owned by France), and thus his scheme was in the end a form of trading in futures, not to mention imperialism (which St. Leon avoids by using the philosopher’s stone rather than land as his backing).\n\n8.

According to The Oxford English Dictionary (16.172), speculation is “buying and selling goods, and stocks, and shares, etc., in order to profit by the rise or fall in the market value, as distinct from regular trading or investment; engagement in any business enterprise or transaction of a venturesome or risky nature, but offering the chance of great or unusual gain.” The OED cites Horace Walpole (1774) and Adam Smith (1776): “Sudden fortunes, indeed, are sometimes made … by what is called the trade of speculation.” The word “speculation” was used as the name of a card game by 1804, if not earlier: “Cards. A round game of cards, the chief feature of which is the buying and selling of trump cards, the player who possesses the highest trump in a round winning the pool.”\n\n15.

It should be said that manufacturing gold coins is not the same thing either as printing money or as borrowing money to cover a deficit, since the gold itself has some value.

According to Manfred Kuehn, who traces the links between Kant and Scottish Common Sense philosophy, there is a greater affinity between the two than is normally thought: “In Kant’s critical philosophy the struggle (or dialectic) between common sense and philosophy emerged as an important formative influence. And Kant’s thought … may be considered as a sustained attempt to balance the aspirations of both common sense and critical reason” (Scottish Common Sense in Germany, 246). Of course, Kant’s Scottish roots may also include enthusiasm, for example, via Thomas Wright, whose astronomical theories he takes up in Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens.\n\n23. F.

Arendt discusses Kant’s spectatorial attitude in relation to the French Revolution and the 1798 Irish Uprising in Lectures on Kant’s Political Philosophy, 44–68. This spectatorship means that, on the question of rebellion against an unjust government, Kant can condemn “the very action whose results” he can also affirm from the sidelines “with a satisfaction bordering on enthusiasm.” Arendt argues that the reason why “you should not engage in what, if successful, you would applaud, is ‘the transcendental position of publicness’ which rules all political action” (48): in other words, the need to keep politics in the realm of debate and ideas.\n\n52.

In “An Old Question” Kant proposes three models of history: (1) “continual retrogression towards wickedness”; (2) “perpetual progression toward improvement,” which he calls eudaemonism or chiliasm; and (3) “stagnation” or “eternal rotation” around the same point, which he calls abderitism (The Conflict of Faculties, 145). In effect he sees chiliasm and abderitism as not inconsistent with each other, and he defers the dialectical resolution of the antinomy between them to a future point (147–57).\n\n56. Kant, “To Perpetual Peace,” (109). In view of Burke’s association of credit/debt with the French, it is interesting that Kant associates the “credit system” with the British, quite correctly, given that it was a Scotsman who brought it to France. In fairness to Kant it should also be said that he disliked credit because of the way it is used to finance wars. On the other hand, Burke, in insisting that the British economy was backed by a growing GDP whereas the French economy was not, entirely ignored the fact the British GDP was growing because of colonial wars, which were in turn sustained by credit. The relationship between credit and war is the other, darker side of the much more general correlation I am arguing for between credit and Romanticism.\n\n57.

At the time, as Chatillon he is twenty-two, but as St. Leon he is fifty-five (386). We do not know exactly how long the Hungarian episode, culminating in St. Leon’s imprisonment by Bethlem Gabor, his escape, and his facilitating of the marriage of Charles and Pandora, lasts. However, when he writes his memoir, “Hungary has resounded for thirty years with the atrocities of the Sieur de Chatillon” (476). It therefore seems reasonable to assume that St. Leon is about eighty-five at the time he writes his memoirs.\n\n59. Mark Philp, Godwin’s Political Justice, 7–11, 99.\n\n60.

My analysis is indebted to Hamilton, who links Godwin to Habermas, though not Kant, on the subject of the public sphere (85). Hamilton, however, treats the novel’s endless “bluffs” as irony or double negation, whereas I approach the text’s mode of communication as a paradox that provokes (dis)belief.\n\n65.

Based on his use of the mediocre hero, Lukács notes that “it is completely wrong to see Scott as a Romantic writer” unless one uses the term in a purely chronological sense (34). As already noted, Gary Kelly marks the later curricular prominence of Scott and Austen in making them the only two novelists to whom he accords full chapters in English Fiction of the Romantic Period, and Ian Duncan associates Scott with a definitive taming of romance by the Novel. Ina Ferris links Scott to an emergent professionalization of the novel and to a masculinization of what had earlier been a form that catered to female readers (The Achievement of Literary Authority: Gender, History, and the Waverley Novels [Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1991], 79, 104).\n\n77. Ruth Bernard Yeazell has recently written on the sustained analogies drawn between Dutch genre painting and the realist novel in the nineteenth century, noting Scott’s application of the parallel to Austen and its application to his own work (Art of the Everyday, 1–17).\n\n78. It is worth noting that Reeve’s The Progress of Romance takes up the terms as different, but just a few years earlier Johnson’s Dictionary had defined “Novel” as “a small tale, generally of love,” and “Romance” as “a military fable of the middle ages; a tale of wild adventure in war and love.” The key difference here seems to be scope and size, not realism.\n\n79. Mary Shelley, “Modern Italian Romances,” 245, 250, 258. Later than Shelley, Hyppolite Taine (1863–64) is also critical of Austen and “the novel of manners” for her “minute copying” in the mode of Dutch painting, which is “incapable of the great divinations and wide sympathies that open up history” (quoted by Yeazell, Art of the Everyday, 5).\n\n80. Reeve, The Progress of Romance, 2.104, 41.\n\n81. Habermas points out that “opinion” was originally associated with a judgment that lacked certainty and thus seemed antithetical to rationality (Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, 89–90). In England, where the division between “opinion” and “critique” was less sharp than in France, Locke’s identification of opinion with conscience helped to uncouple it from prejudice; in France it was when the physiocrats ascribed opinion publique to the publique éclairé that the concept “receive[d] the strict meaning of an opinion purified through critical discussion” (89–92).\n\n82.

In fact the “more finished” copy (W, 72) provides relatively little of the text: it runs only from the beginning to the middle of chapter 3 (75–93), and from the beginning to the middle of chapter 5 (102–15). Most of Godwin’s parenthetical additions are in the less-finished version, but one is in the more-finished part (90), indicating that the role of Darnford was still unresolved in the copy that he described as having received Wollstonecraft’s “last corrections” (115n).\n\n2. I take this line in ventriloquizing Mary Shelley’s implicit reading of her father’s editing of her mother’s work two decades earlier, when she sends her own novella Mathilda to Godwin for publication (“Mary Shelley’s Mathilda,” 58–59). I have taken up Godwin’s editing of Wollstonecraft’s novel on other previous occasions: see also “Is There a Romantic Ideology?,” 70. The Supplement of Reading, 179–83, and “Framing the Corpus,” 516–18. Each time I have returned to the problem, I have read the relationship between Wollstonecraft’s text and Godwin’s editing of it differently. The result is the present chapter, which neither privileges not criticizes Godwin’s editing but rather explores the complexities of the relationship between and within the text’s two voices.\n\n3. Friedrich Nietzsche, The Antichrist, 169.\n\n4. For examples of this reading of Wollstonecraft, see Maria J. Falco, ed., Feminist Interpretations of Mary Wollstonecraft. See in particular the essays by Penny A. Weiss, 15–32; Virginia Muller, 47–60; and Dorothy McBride Stevenson, 165–77.\n\n5. William Godwin, Memoirs of the Author of “A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,” Hereafter cited as MV.\n\n6. Barbara Taylor elaborates on the term “philosopher,” the double meaning of which itself supports Godwin’s view of Wollstonecraft as a subject-in-process. Wollstonecraft, she suggests, “saw herself as a philosopher in the sense that liberal Britons gave to the term for most of the eighteenth century: that is, as an abstract reasoner of enlightened disposition, concerned to comprehend and elucidate general truths.” But she also saw herself as a “proponent of revolutionary demoracy” in the line of the radical philosophes (Mary Wollstonecraft and the Feminist Imagination, 26–30, 50–54, 149). Wollstonecraft’s “aversion” to being considered an author (MV, 64) probably had to do with being dismissed as an “authoress,” which is not what Godwin means by the term.\n\n7. Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, Anti-Oedipus, 21.\n\n8. In general liberal feminists blame Godwin’s frank representation of Wollstonecraft’s life and loves in his Memoirs for the subsequent decline in her reputation. Yet in doing so they are curiously complicit with the conservative reaction against her work by Richard Polwhele and others, which was catalyzed by Godwin’s portrayal. That is, they either see Godwin’s portrayal of Wollstonecraft as incorrect and as an attempt to put her down (rather than to bring out her complexity), or they accept it and see Wollstonecraft as falling short of true feminism. See, for example, the essays by Falco, Weiss, and Wendy Gunther-Canada in Falco, Feminist Interpretations, 5, 24, 214.\n\n9. This feminism is appropriately described by Gary Kelly’s phrase “revolutionary feminism.” Kelly is one of the few who does not critique Wollstonecraft for compromising a rights- based feminism by falling into the trap of sensibility. However, he reads Wrongs straightforwardly as an expression of revolutionary feminism, without taking account of the greater complexity disclosed and produced by Godwin’s editing (Revolutionary Feminism, 1–2, 206–23).\n\n10. Godwin is absolutely against a system of national education (PJ, 2:290–301). Seeing the drawbacks of both public and “private” (home) schooling, Wollstonecraft favors a combination of both, and indeed favors coeducation (A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, 5:229–50). Interestingly, Wollstonecraft is also not as dismissive as Godwin of another institution, that of marriage, if set on a correct basis (ibid., 237; PJ, 2:506–10).\n\n11.

Barthes contrasts the “semiology” of lexias with a “philology” that “declar[es] every text to be univocal” (7), but my point is that philology is precisely a semiology.\n\n13. According to Susan Lanser, who valorizes “communal” over “personal” voice, Wrongs fails because “it remains in paralyzed suspension between individual and communal narrative” (Fictions of Authority, 225, 231). More sympathetically, Taylor also sees the communal concern with the wrongs of different classes of women as marking the “beginnings of modern feminism” (Mary Wollstonecraft, 236–45).\n\n14. Lawrence Stone, Road to Divorce, 235–36.\n\n15. On Wilkes, see Susan Staves, Married Women’s Separate Property in England, 170–75. Wilkes, then twenty-two, married Mary Mead, a woman ten years his senior, in 1747. He turned out to be something of a libertine, and in 1756 they privately negotiated a separate maintenance agreement, in which Mary gave up much of the property she had brought into the marriage, and was given an allowance of £200 per annum. Heavily in debt, Wilkes in 1758, after having used the agreement to get Mary’s property, tried to get the allowance disallowed, and when he failed, he tried to argue that the maintenance agreement was unenforceable, hoping that he could get Mary to live with him again so that he could eventually claim the £100,000 she would inherit from her mother (the case failed). While Wilkes’s action against his wife preceded his radical career, in a somewhat ingenuous expression of freethinking, he questioned being bound to a marriage contracted in his “non-age.”\n\n16.

But between 1800 and 1840, there were only six more divorce suits by women, all unsuccessful, as male adultery was not considered a ground for divorce (ibid., 360–61).\n\n23. Ibid., 340–41, 323–24, 25. Married women could only retain access to their property through the agency of a trustee, since a married woman’s “legal personality” was absorbed into that of her husband (150).\n\n24. L. Simond, A Journal of a Tour and Residence in Great Britain during the Years 1810 and 1811, by a French Traveller (quoted in Stone, Road to Divorce, 231).\n\n25. Stone, Road to Divorce, 234.\n\n26. John Bender, Imagining the Penitentiary, 155–57, 175–76. The trial in Wrongs is not a criminal trial. Criminal conversation suits were always conducted by lawyers, though they did not become popular until the 1760s and 1770s, which coincidentally is also the period when lawyers, introduced into the criminal trial in the 1730s, came to strongly dominate this procedure.\n\n27. Langbein, “The Eighteenth-Century Criminal Trial,” 123–24. See also Landsman, “The Rise of the Contentious Spirit,” 504–9.\n\n28. Langbein, “Shaping the Eighteenth-Century Criminal Trial,” 130. Landsman also notes that by the 1780s more and more defendants left the defense to their counsel, and they were even chided for contributing to it (“The Rise of the Contentious Spirit,” 547, 557).\n\n29. Matthew Wickman, The Ruins of Experience, 25–34.\n\n30. Bender makes this point about the negative side of lawyerization in classically Foucaultian terms: “The genius of modern forms of bureaucratic control is that they appropriate the heteroglossic diversity of the metropolis by keeping track of it and absorbing it into a container of authority projected as systematic rules, a controlled framework within which polyglossic discourse can be allowed liberal freedoms” (Imagining the Penitentiary, 177).\n\n31. Arthur J. Jacobson, “The Idolatry of Rules,” 110–11, 130–31.\n\n32. Landsman, “Rise of the Contentious Spirit,” 582, 580–91. Landsman sees adversarial procedure as crucial to the development of “dynamic individualism” and political liberty (503, 580–91), whereas Bender takes a more Foucaultian view of the adversary system’s potential to reentrench a power that is ubiquitous and cleverly dispersed. Despite Wollstonecraft’s sidestepping of counsel and rules of evidence, Landsman’s point about the usefulness of an adversarial court system to radical reformers concerned with freedom of speech, the abolition of slavery, and adequacy of political representation is obviously relevant to the trial scene in Wrongs.\n\n33. Stone, Road to Divorce, 196–97. A sense of these libels, depositions, exhibits and interrogatories can be gathered from Trials for Adultery (1779–80); see n. 21.\n\n34. A frequent way around the illegality of imprisonment was the use of private madhouses. Confinement of the wife in a private madhouse that was, in effect, a prison was often used between 1660 and 1774, when parliament tried to put a stop to the practice by licensing madhouses (Stone, Road to Divorce, 164–68). If the madhouse in Wrongs is unlicensed, this would explain the sudden collapse of its panoptical power and Maria’s and Darnford’s unexpected escape, as well as the fact that Venables then tries to sue Darnford for damages rather than confining Maria again.\n\n35. Jean-François Lyotard and Jean-Loup Thébaud, Just Gaming, 73.\n\n36. Stone, Road, 195–97; idem, Broken Lives, 224.\n\n37. Mary Wollstonecraft, Collected Letters, 381. It is worth noting that, unlike Caleb Williams, Wrongs is clearly set in the years after the French Revolution and thus in a period of social upheaval and possible change. The trial scene therefore does not simply confirm the force of law, as in the original ending of Godwin’s novel; it does not, as Nancy E. Johnson argues, “reaffirm a dichotomy between morality and the legal system” (The English Jacobin Novel, 149). Rather, it participates in the Wilkite project of usurping the public space of the courts to forward political reform. Such reforms were occurring, at least de facto. Often wives in successful divorce cases married their lovers, and by the 1790s many criminal conversation suits involved collusion between the husband and the lover to release all parties from an arrangement that was not working. According to Stone, by the 1790s most criminal conversation suits were undefended: the lover did not come to the trial, and the husband, intending to release the wife, accepted damages but returned the money. Thus, even though one cannot imagine Venables except as a Blakean Nobodaddy, the text certainly evokes the historical reality of what Stone describes as an increasing skepticism about “the religious foundations of the indissolubility of marriage” (Road to Divorce, 26, 235, 297). See also n. 25.\n\n38. Jacobson, “Idolatry of Rules,” 134–35.\n\n39. Gary Kelly suggests in a note to his edition of Wrongs (230n) that Wollstonecraft got her information on “trials for adultery and damages” from Trials for Adultery. The full title of this collection is worth citing:\n\nTRIALS FOR ADULTERY: OR, being THE HISTORY of DIVORCES. being SELECT TRIALS at DOCTOR’S COMMONS, for ADULTERY, FORNICATION, CRUELTY, IMPOTENCE,&c. From the Year 1760 to the present Time. Including the whole of the Evidence on each Cause. TOGETHER WITH, The LETTERS &C., that have been intercepted between the amorous parties. The whole forming a complete History of the PRIVATE LIFE, INTRIGUES, and AMOURS of many Characters in the most elevated sphere: every scene and transaction, however whimsical, ridiculous, or extraordinary, being fairly represented, as becomes a faithful Historian, who is fully determined not to sacrifice Truth at the Shrine of Guilt and Folly.\n\nBladon’s seven-volume collection is interesting in several respects. It does indeed combine accounts of separation suits with the occasional criminal conversation suit (e.g., Abergavenny vs. Lyddel, or Cibber vs. Sloper, in volume 7—the volumes are not continuously paginated). It thus puts suits in which a woman could be the plaintiff on the same basis as ones in which only men could be involved, much as Wollstonecraft does. Second, despite the moralistic tone assumed in the Preface, which justifies the sensationalistic publication of details on so many trials for separation by arguing that the volumes are meant to discourage divorce, the volumes clearly function as a form of incitement, by showing the just causes that exist for separation in a variety of cases. Indeed, there are no cases in the volumes that do not result in a separation (though in some cases no “sentence” is provided), and in a roughly equal number of cases the separation is granted to the woman. In the transcripts of crim. con. suits, damages also vary widely, between £10 (Cibber) and £10,000 (Abergavenny). This is to say that the Trials are an instance of "
