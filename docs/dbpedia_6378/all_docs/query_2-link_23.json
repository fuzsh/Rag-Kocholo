Form Design/Center, the center for urbanism and architecture in Malmö, is taking over the exhibition in a condensed version and supplementing it with new contributions from the Nordic countries. The Malmö edition is supported by the Swedish Architects Association.\n\nConcept:\n\nThe exploitation of resources and people in the construction industry undermines the integrity of architecture. To advance architecture as a discipline and harness its potential as a reparative force, the exhibition The Great Repair Moves North advocates for a new architectural ethos centered around repair.\n\nFrom the often invisible maintenance work for upkeeping buildings, to the political decision to stop demolishing existing built structures, and to architecture as an instrument of justice, the exhibition challenges the ethical stance of all parties involved in the production of space. In a time of ecological and social emergency, every choice to build, not to build, or to build in a different way can either result in continuing the path of planetary destruction or contributing to genuine repair. The exhibition seeks to better understand how to practice architecture ethically in today’s world.\n\nThe Great Repair Moves North is based on the exhibition The Great Repair, a project initiated by ARCH+ in collaboration with the Akademie der Künste in Berlin, ETH Zürich and the University of Luxembourg. Form/Design Center presents the exhibition in a condensed version and complements it with new contributions from the Nordic countries.\n\nThe exhibition is structured around seven topics that highlight the processes related to the maintenance and repair of buildings, cities and landscapes at various scales: from the daily rituals of caretaking to examples of construction practices that prioritize working with existing structures rather than replacing them with new ones. Through videos, models, installations, original drawings, and prototypes, the exhibition showcases over twenty approaches from both emerging and established international artists and architectural firms that render repair tangible as a new design paradigm.\n\nWhen considered through the lens of repair, architecture also becomes accessible to everyone as the scale of care extends beyond the realm of professionals, enabling everyone to participate in repairing their immediate surroundings and addressing any injustices they observe there.\n\nLet’s repair!\n\nParticipants of the Malmö edition:\n\nSven Olof Ahlberg, Atelier Bow-Wow, Center for Spatial Technologies, Agnes Denes, Gaia Arkitektur, Gylleboverket artist group, HouseEurope!, Lacaton & Vassal, Limbo Accra, Charlotte Malterre-Barthes, Material Cultures, Joar Nango, Not Quite/ Warm in the Winter/ Urban Futures/ RISE, André Pihl, Secretary International, Charlie C.

The Pavillon de l'Arsenal, the City of Paris's Center for Urbanism and Architecture, will host a condensed version of the exhibition. We are delighted to see the exhibition serving as a starting point for an international exchange on issues of sustainability. The Paris edition is supported by the Federal Foreign Office.\n\nConcept:\n\nIn a world scarred by the exploitation of resources and people and torn apart by wars, architecture can serve as a reparative force. Fueled by this belief, Pavillon de l’Arsenal presents the exhibition “The Great Repair,” a traveling project initiated by ARCH+ in collaboration with Akademie der Künste in Berlin, ETH Zürich, and the University of Luxembourg. Its aim, in light of the stark realization of the irreconcilable conflict between unchecked growth and ecological balance, is to advocate for a new architectural ethos centered around repair.\n\nFrom the care provided by often-marginalized workers in maintaining buildings, to the political decision to refrain from demolition, and to architecture as an instrument of justice in times of conflict, the exhibition challenges the ethical stance of contemporary builders. In a time of ecological and social emergency, every choice to build, not to build, or to build in a different way can either result in the destructive use of resources harming the planet and its denizens or to genuine repair. The exhibition seeks to explore the line between the two to better understand how to practice architecture ethically in today’s world.\n\nThe exhibition is structured around seven topics, shedding light on the processes related to the maintenance and upkeep of architecture and urban landscapes. It examines these themes at various scales, from the daily rituals of caretaking to examples of construction practices that prioritize working with existing structures rather than replacing them with new ones. Through videos, models, installations, original drawings, and prototypes, the exhibition showcases over twenty approaches from both emerging and established international artists and architectural firms that render repair tangible as a new design paradigm.\n\nThe European and global dimensions of the project are of paramount importance to us; when confronted with such challenges, the only viable response is a collective one, and dialogue between cultural institutions from different countries is therefore necessary. Proposals originating in Berlin, Mariupol, and Accra inform initiatives in Paris, just as Paris leads the way in advancing a more environmentally and socially conscious architecture.\n\nWhen considered through the lens of repair, architecture also becomes accessible to everyone as the scale of care extends beyond the realm of professionals, allowing everyone to get involved in repairing their immediate surroundings and any injustices they observe there.

It is no longer solely the concern of environmental activists but permeates everyday life.\n\nAdhering to a growth-driven economic model fuels resource depletion, environmental degradation, and their societal consequences.\n\nReconciling limitless growth with climate protection verges on the impossible, demanding a transformation of our material culture and the adoption of new forms of coexistence.\n\nSpanning art, architecture, and spatial practices, the 40 positions presented in this exhibition trace the contours of a new design paradigm: The Great Repair.\n\nThe exhibition begins with a look at the repair and maintenance of the Akademie der Künste building itself, highlighting the value of care work for the institution.\n\nThe showcased practices not only exemplify reparative approaches to artifacts within the built environment but also underscore the need for repair in socioeconomic, geopolitical, and ecological contexts.\n\nThe act of repair inevitably reveals what cannot be repaired. Acknowledging these scars and assuming responsibility for ecological damage from colonial entanglements is integral to a great repair as a process of reparation.\n\nOnly through the lens of social and ecological justice and equality can we truly approach repair as a collective effort and find new optimism in what has been repaired.\n\nOn Saturday, October 14, over 30 different artists, architects, and spatial practitioners will host the School of Repair at Akademie der Künste: an all-day program of workshop discussions and roundtables in the context of The Great Repair. In workshop talks, exhibition participants will present their contribution as well as their general practice, and discuss the politics and practices of repair together with the attending guests. Different roundtables address various aspects of the necessary transition to a repair society.\n\nIn German and English (and partially Spanish) language. Admission with exhibition ticket.\n\nAwaska Alpa: A Hands-on Moment Connected to the Andean Amazon\n\nWorkshop\n\n11 a.m.–1 p.m.\n\nSolar Garden, Hall 2\n\nwith: Liliana Armero, Santiago del Hierro, Freider Legarda, Viviana Jacanamejoy, Jean Mutumbajoy\n\nIn the morning, representatives of the Inga People of Colombia and Santiago del Hierro will host a weaving workshop to create a collective cartography: Participants will be asked to share “their territory” by expressing it as an input to the common fabric, weaving together a plurality of perspectives. Guests are welcome to participate regardless of their expertise; spectators are transformed into creators, allowing the exhibition space to be shared in a novel way.\n\nRepairing the Irreparable: After the Earthquake (EN)\n\nRoundtable\n\n11:00 a.m.–1 p.m.\n\nClubraum\n\nwith: Nilgün Yelpaze, Eray Çaylı, Merve Bedir, Nazlı Tümerdem (moderator)\n\nIn the context of a post-disaster geography⸺such as the parts of Turkey and Syria devastated by earthquakes in 2023⸺any endeavor of repair becomes particularly challenging, if not entirely unattainable. Even more so, as this geography and its racialized communities have been burdened by decades of unrest and violence, and at the same time governed by undemocratic states unwilling or unable to put their residents’ safety first. While this disaster had a cataclysmic impact on an area half the size of Germany, it also crystallized ingrained sociopolitical and socioecological entanglements of the region. By engaging key aspects of the exhibition, including (re)construction, demolition, waste, and solidarity, this roundtable asks what these aspects of repair might mean through the lens of the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquakes.\n\nCollective Rope Chair Weaving (ES/EN/DE)\n\nWorkshop\n\n2–5 p.m.\n\nSolar Garden\n\nwith: Liliana Armero, Santiago del Hierro, Viviana Jacanamejoy, Freider Legarda, Jean Mutumbajoy, Markus Krieger (ARCH+), Roswitha Kötz (Akademie der Künste)\n\nTo continue the collaboration of the morning’s weaving workshop, various exhibition participants convene with visitors in the afternoon of the School of Repair to contribute to the intervention on the second-floor patio at Akademie der Künste. Participants will “learn the ropes” of weaving to create parts of the seating based on a 1952 design by Riki Watanabe for Atelier Bow-Wow’s Solar Garden. Ropes from Berlin forming the weft will be interwoven with warp threads made of rope from Colombia, brought here by representatives of the Inga community, forming the armchair’s seat. This collaboration between Santiago del Hierro, representatives of the Inga community of Colombia, and Atelier Bow-Wow is complemented by inputs from exhibition designer Roswitha Kötz and The Great Repair co-curator Markus Krieger.\n\nTools of Repair – Worte, Körper, Städte: ein Glossar für die Diversität (EN)\n\nWorkshop\n\n2–3:30 p.m.\n\nClubraum\n\nwith: Goethe-Institut, Museo delle Periferie Rome, Alessandro Schiattarella\n\nTools of Repair is the first chapter in the series Words, Bodies, Cities: A Glossary for Diversity, focusing on the concept of care. Produced in collaboration with Goethe-Institut, Museo delle Periferie Rome, and the choreographer Alessandro Schiattarella, the workshop focuses on hands as tools of repair. In a world grappling with issues of sustainability, Tools of Repair explores values such as listening, solidarity, reappropriation, plurality, and caring as essential elements of a repair society, offering a space for reflection on and engagement with these notions in the context of the broader topics addressed by the exhibition. The workshop begins with a short warm-up session to prepare participants for physical exercise. Clothing is casual and comfortable, and the workshop is open to people with or without previous experience of movement. Tools of Repair prioritizes accessibility, welcoming people with and without disabilities.\n\nPractice Repair (EN)\n\nRoundtable\n\n4–5 p.m.\n\nReparierBar, Upper foyer\n\nwith: Alfie Gee & Reishin Watabe (UVW-SAW), Ana Miljački (Critical Broadcasting Lab, MIT), George Massoud & Paloma Gormley (Material Cultures), Amy Faith Perkins (Assemble), Oliver Burch (ZAS*), Nazlı Tümerdem & Marija Marić (moderators)\n\nIf we want a project like that of The Great Repair to be successful, we need to start by recognizing the brokenness of how we teach, learn, and practice our own discipline. From the classroom to the office, and from the construction site to sites of resource extraction, building practices are still far too often shaped by (self-)exploitation, power asymmetries, and inequality. Therefore, they are some of the most important arenas for repairing the practice. This roundtable discussion centers around the question of the agency of students, teachers, and architectural workers in creating a more just and caring professional community, and thus a more equitable and ecological future.\n\nWorkshop talks\n\nExhibition halls\n\n11:15–12 a.m.\n\nJonathan Banz – Mapping Ukraine: Building amidst Destruction (DE)\n\nBettina Knaup – Mierle Laderman Ukeles: Manifesto for Maintenance Art, 1969! / Touch Sanitation Performance (DE)\n\nFolke Köbberling – Cars into Bicycles (DE)\n\nAna Miljački (Collective Architecture Studio) – Balls for All (EN)\n\n12:15–1 p.m.\n\nHans Hortig – In the Shadow of the Palms (DE)\n\nZara Pfeifer – Kleine Reinigungs- und Dienstleistungsgesellschaft Bildessay (DE)\n\nAlfie Gee, Reishin Kunishima Watabe (UVW-SAW) – The Office (EN)\n\nZAS* – Triemli Files (DE)\n\n2–2:45 p.m.\n\nNatasha Aruri, Mai Al-Battat, Andreas Brück – Takhayali [imagine, feminine] Ein Qiniya!
