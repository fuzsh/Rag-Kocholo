        "text": "The term \"ace in a day\" is used to designate a pilot who has shot down five or more aircraft in a single day, based on the usual definition of an \"ace\" as one with five or more aerial victories.\n\nWorld War I\n\n[edit]\n\nAce in a day on two occasions\n\n[edit]\n\nA Bristol F2B crew – Canadian pilot Captain Alfred Atkey and English observer Lieutenant Charles Gass – became \"ace in a day\" twice in the same week. On 7 May 1918, they shot down five German planes in a single sortie over Arras. Two days later, on 9 May, they were credited with another five enemy machines in the course of two sorties. Atkey and Gass survived the Great War. Atkey credited with a total of 38 victories, making him the most successful two-seater pilot and Gass with 39 claims was the most successful observer ace of all time.\n\nRené Fonck, the top scoring French Aéronautique Militaire and Allied ace of the war, scored six in a day on both 9 May and 26 September 1918.\n\nAce in a day\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first aviators to ever achieve \"ace in a day\" were pilot Julius Arigi and observer/gunner Johann Lasi of the Austro-Hungarian air force, on 22 August 1916, when they downed five Italian planes.\n\nThe first single pilot (as opposed to double aviators, as is the case with the previously mentioned Arigi and Lasi) was World War I German flying ace Fritz Otto Bernert. Bernert scored five victories within 20 minutes on 24 April 1917. He had a total of 27 kills during the war, even though he wore glasses and had a useless left arm.\n\nAndrew Beauchamp-Proctor, the top scoring South African ace of the war, was piloting an SE5a fighter with Royal Air Force No 84 Squadron when he shot down five German aircraft on 19 May 1918.\n\nRaymond Collishaw, a Canadian who was the top scoring Royal Naval Air Service ace, piloted a Sopwith Triplane when scoring six Albatros D.V fighters near Menen, 6 July 1917.\n\nJohn Lightfoot Trollope of the Royal Air Force shot down and destroyed seven German planes on 24 March 1918.\n\nHenry Woollett of the Royal Air Force shot down and destroyed six German airplanes on 12 April 1918, setting two afire.\n\nFrederick McCall, Canadian flying ace, shot down five German fighters, four (3 Albatros D.V and 1 Fokker D.VII) in the morning and the fifth in the evening (Albatros D.V) of 30 June 1918 . For this success he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order.\n\nJohn Inglis Gilmour of the Royal Air Force successfully brought down five German aircraft in a single day on 1 July 1918. He achieved this whilst piloting a Sopwith Camel fighter.\n\nBilly Bishop, the top scoring Canadian and British Empire ace of the war, was piloting an S.E.5 on 19 June 1918, when he scored four Pfalz D.III fighters and a LVG C two-seat reconnaissance aircraft near Ploegsteert.\n\nWalter Carl Simon, who served in No. 139 Squadron RAF became the first American ace in day when he and his observer William Smith in a Bristol F.2b shot down on 30 July 1918 three Albatros D.IIIs, one LVG C and one reconnaissance plane[citation needed]\n\nEugene Seeley Coler, like W. C. Simon also an American serving in the RAF, at No. 11 Squadron RAF, and also flying a Bristol F.2b, on 13 August 1918 with his observer Cyril William Gladman shot down five Fokker D.VIIs. For this, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.[citation needed]\n\nHeinrich Gontermann of the Luftstreitkräfte achieved five aerial victories on 19 August 1918 when, flying a Fokker D.VII, he shot down a SPAD fighter in the morning and destroyed four Allied observation balloons in the afternoon.\n\nArthur Spurling, a Bermudian pilot of No. 49 Squadron RAF, with his observer Frank Bell, were flying a DH.9 bomber on 23 August 1918, when they single-handedly attacked thirty Fokker D.VII fighters, downing five of them (three by Spurling, two by Bell). Two days later Spurling shot down another D.VII over Mont Notre Dame. The two crewmen shared each other's victories, each attaining ace status in a single mission.[citation needed]\n\nFrank Luke of 27th Aero Squadron USAAS, at the controls of a SPAD XIII, achieved five victories on 18 September 1918, destroying two Fokker D.VII fighters, two observation balloons and an Halberstadt reconnaissance plane. Luke was killed in action 11 days later.\n\nFriedrich Ritter von Röth of Jagdstaffel 16 shot down five observation balloons in 15 minutes on 29 May 1918.\n\nWorld War II\n\n[edit]\n\nTriple-ace in a day\n\n[edit]\n\nTo achieve this a pilot must have destroyed 15 enemy aircraft in a single day. This has been achieved by only five pilots, all from the Luftwaffe:[13]\n\nHans-Joachim Marseille shot down 17 Allied fighters in three sorties over North Africa on 1 September 1942.\n\nEmil Lang shot down 18 Soviet fighters on 3 November 1943, the most kills on a single day by any pilot in history.\n\nAugust Lambert shot down 17 Soviet aircraft on a single day in 1944.\n\nHubert Strassl shot down 15 Soviet aircraft on 5 July 1943 near Orel.\n\nWilhelm Batz claimed 15 Soviet aircraft shot down on 31 May 1944.\n\nDouble-ace in a day\n\n[edit]\n\nTo achieve this a pilot must have destroyed ten enemy aircraft in a single day. This has been achieved by twelve pilots, three of whom repeated their achievement a second time within weeks.\n\nHiromichi Shinohara, on 27 June 1939 set an Imperial Japanese Army Air Force record of eleven victories in a single day during an air battle over Tamsak-Bulak. He is highest scoring non-German ace in a day in history.\n\nAdolf Dickfeld claimed eleven Soviet aircraft shot down on 8 May 1942.\n\nHermann Graf, the first fighter pilot to claim 200 aerial victories, shot down ten Soviet aircraft on 23 September 1942.\n\nMax Stotz claimed ten Soviet aircraft shot down on 30 December 1942.\n\nWalter Nowotny, the first fighter pilot to claim 250 aerial victories, twice shot down ten in one day. On 24 June 1943 and on 1 September 1943 he claimed ten Soviet aircraft shot down.\n\nErich Rudorffer is credited with the destruction of the most aircraft ever in a single mission when he shot down thirteen Soviet aircraft on 11 October 1943.\n\nJohannes Wiese claimed twelve Soviet aircraft shot down on 5 July 1943.\n\nWalter Wolfrum twice shot down ten or more aircraft on one day. On 30 May 1944, he claimed eleven Soviet aircraft destroyed and on 16 July 1944, he claimed further ten shot down.\n\nWalter Schuck claimed eleven Soviet aircraft shot down on 17 June 1944.\n\nErich Hartmann, the highest-scoring fighter ace in history, twice shot down ten or more aircraft on one day. On 26 February 1944, he claimed ten planes and eleven on 24 August 1944, in two consecutive missions. In the process, he became the first 300-kill ace in history, and as a result of this, gained the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds, by then Germany's highest military award for standard servicemen.\n\nFranz Schall twice shot down ten or more aircraft on one day. On 26 August 1944, he claimed eleven Soviet aircraft destroyed, and on 31 August 1944, he claimed a further thirteen shot down.\n\nHeinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer: although claiming only nine aircraft shot down, he destroyed ten RAF bombers on 21 February 1945.\n\nMultiple times ace in a day\n\n[edit]\n\nEighteen-time ace in day\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 7 July 1943, then again on 1 August, 4 August, 5 August, 7
