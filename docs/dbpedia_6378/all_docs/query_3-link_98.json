        "text": "For a long time the European project was considered an obvious development that generated benefits for all parties concerned. The succession of serious crises that move the continent for a decade, endangers this project for the first time seriously. The Brexit could weaken the entire alliance sustainably.\n\nThe current situation is so loaded with problems that a positive sign appears necessary. Europe lacks visibility, public presence and positive feedback.\n\nThe continuity and stability of the European idea are existentially, especially during this difficult period of time.\n\nThis is the background for a light installation on the facade of ST. AGNES in Kreuzberg, which opposes the lack of visibility and presence with a statement for Europe. The project of morePlatz installs the letters EUROPA of 33 fluorescent tubes on the eastern facade of ST. AGNES. The installation shone in autumn 2016 for half a year, and subsequently moved to other locations.\n\nThe building of the former church is ST. AGNES with its bold appearance is part of the installation, quasi as a witness and support the idea of Europe. The building was renewed in 2015 and is since then used as exhibition space by the KÖNIG GALERIE who supports the project.\n\nOne of the greatest achievements after the two world wars was the extinction of old enmities, territorial claims and geopolitical expansion of individual nations and of nationalism as an ideology. Germany as a former aggressor plays in this case a special role. Respecting mutual limits was the prerequisite for overcoming them.\n\nThe continuous economic boom of the postwar decades allowed the stable period of growth and prosperity, the so called ‚Golden Generation', which lasted until the end of the century. The sequence of crises of the new millennium has put this trend to an end. Although these crises do not originate only in Europe, a growing number of the population makes the EU responsible and blames her, partly from a lack of understanding or knowledge of the context. The Europe-wide shift to the ‚right' is the result. This is a dangerous development. Populists profit from the mistaken belief that a retreat into national borders can solve the current problems.\n\nIn the age of digitalization and global networks it is not possible, to turn back the clock. People who are unable or unwilling to see beyond their own situation must be taken their fear of ‚strangers'. Europe needs to play to its strength and become aware of its advantages again. Anyone who has lived a longer period in another continent as for example Asia or Africa, can recognize the similarities of Europeans better than their differences.\n\nThe European identity is still underdeveloped. But it's exactly this identity, which can guarantee a future for the European Union.\n\nThis would require the improvement of living conditions for people who use Europe as a contiguous habitat, that exceed the national boundaries and that can recognize the larger context as a benefit.\n\nPeople who use the European freedom of movement for real and spend their CVs in different countries, need, for example, a European mobile telephone contract, a European health insurance, a European pension, a European bank and account number, a European car license plates, and a European Chamber of Commerce etc .. Some of these things are already being planned and are in any case easier to realize than a European citizenship, or a European tax system, not to mention a European Republic. The barriers that exist mainly due to the different languages, are evident and the complexity of the European project is tremendous.\n\nOnce you say Europe, the background always reverberates with these complex relationships and manifold problems - but this sound also contains the whole history and the promise of a success.\n\nThe installation 'EUROPE' as a statement is so simple, like a neon sign, such as advertising for a brand that needs no justification, that everyone wants to have.\n\nThe Temple Museum is located at the Europastrasse E50 in Etsdorf since 2010. The Museum is dedicated to the 'Europe-Temple', a project for the Glyptothek in Etsdorf by Willi Koch - one of the sponsors of the first Installation at ST.AGNES - and shows exhibitions about Europe.\n\nOn the 9th of May 2018, members of the society 'friends of the Glyptothek Etsdorf' installed the lettering EUROPA on the pediment of the Museum.\n\nThe installation is an exact copy of the Original in Berlin and was officially lit for the first time by mayor Alwin Märkl at dusk of 'Europeday'.\n\nSince Friday 18th of May the EUROPE light installation is glowing on top of the mining tower next to Pact Zollverein in Essen.\n\nThe UNESCO world heritage Zeche Zollverein offered a perfect location for the installation. Currently the former mixing plant is hosting the exhibition „Das Zeitalter der Kohle. Eine Europäische Geschichte“ where probalbly the most precious exhibit is the Original founding charter of the ‘European Coal and Steel Community’ on display. The so-called Montan Union paved the way to the European Union.\n\nThe collaboration of the Western European mining industry initiated not only the international domestic market but also prosperity and a peaceful coexistence.\n\nBeing part of the European cultural heritage year, the EUROPA light installation reached the roots of the European community and illuminated in the last year of coal production in North Rhine Westphalia historical aspects as well as future tasks for the European continent as climate change and renewable energies.\n\nOn the occasion of the cultural weekend 'Offen auf AEG', EUROPA is glowing in Nürnberg at the so-called 'Dallmann' - the former conveyor belt of the converted 'auf AEG' area.\n\nThe light installation is shining for at least six months and refers to the application of Nürnberg as European cultural capital in 2025.\n\nThe idea of mounting EUROPA at 'auf AEG' was initiated by Martin Schnitzer / Schnitzer&.\n\nMany thanks for the successful crowd funding and to all the new sponsors!\n\nsupport: MIB Coloured Fields GmbH, Bayerische Architektenkammer, Bewerbungsbüro Kulturhauptstadt Europas 2025 der Stadt Nürnberg\n\nMontage: Meister Robrock / Teichmann Elektrotechnik\n\nFollowing the renewal of the Elbe islands and Harburg inland port, the Bille power station - a former factory complex from the late 19th century located in Hammerbrook - is becoming a focus of urban planning and will be part of a long-term development project in the east of Hamburg.\n\nUnder the motto \"The space for city pioneers\", the development in Hammerbrook promises a variety of perspectives. The landmark of the Bille power station has the potential to develop into an identificatory spot for the entire urban quarter.\n\nThe EUROPA installation draws attention to the site as a work of art with far-reach and positively promotes this development.\n\nIn the vicinity of the power plant are located several renowned art institutions as the Deichtorhallen, the Kunstverein and the Kunsthaus Hamburg.\n\nWe hope that EUROPA can contribute to the conversion of Hammerbrook into a hip part of town - with the Kraftwerk Bille as its new centre - and that the European project develops again more approval and stays a good habitat for 500 million people, with all its advantages that we aquired in long years and that it hopefully gets even better.\n\nFoto: Ruben Dario Kleimeer\n\nIn mid-November 2016, the project was presented in the bunker on Blumenstraße, the new location of the Munich Architecture Gallery. The opening date of the first light installation in Berlin on the 1st of Advent - as Advent lighting for St. Agnes - was already set. For the opening of the bunker, the lettering was projected onto the outside wall on November 10, 2016. On that evening the sponsors for the last fluorescent tubes of the first edition were found.\n\nFoto: Saskia Wehler\n\nThe Behala cement silo at the Western Harbor of Berlin is a special location for our 14th EUROPA project, as this striking building from the early 1960s was designed by Werner Düttmann, who also planned and built the St. Agnes Church in Kreuzberg. The very first EUROPA installation illuminated the Königgalerie almost seven years ago. From there, our jointly supported project began its journey to a total of 13 other locations with the help of many sponsors.\n\nThe two buildings - Cement Silo and St.Agnes - are very different in their functions, but speak the same architectural language of clear cubatures and concise geometries.\n\nBoth volumes are characterized by a vertical accent that stands out clearly from the main building - the nave on the one hand and here the hexagonal structure of the silos - and thus offers optimal visibility for the light installation.\n\nThe small version of the lettering was glowing on the bell tower of St. Agnes in May 2019 for Europe Day. Just like almost five years ago, EUROPA will shine at the Westhafen until the next elections.\n\nmany thanks to BEHALA, Schnitzer&, Bernd Kommunikationsdesign and Johann König"
