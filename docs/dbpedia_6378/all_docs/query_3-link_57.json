        "text": "AOP Awards: Beyond the Lens\n\nFriday 14 - Monday 17 October, Old Truman Brewery, Brick Lane, London E1\n\nThe AOP will take over the largest space at the Old Truman Brewery for 4 days of all things photography. Alongside the Awards Exhibition, Beyond the Lens will include talks by leading photographers and names in the industry, covering everything from critical reviews, copyright and business planning, to marketing, promotion and more. So far confirmed are:\n\nAll talks were FREE.\n\nFriday 14 October 10- 17:30\n\nHasselblad X1D\n\nGet hands on with Hasselblad’s revolutionary new X1D digital medium format mirrorless camera with a special live shoot.\n\nMain Stage\n\n11.00am: The Ever Diminishing Value of Photography Award winning photographer Cambridge Jones will discuss his amazing career and the pitfalls of working for free. cambridgejones.com\n\n12.00pm: Letting Go of the Camera Publishers are moving to video, brands are moving to video, everyone is moving to video. While there is still demand for great, professional photography, it’s clear that moving images are no longer the future - they are the present. Cherryduck Managing Director and AOP Chairman James Vellacott will lead a small panel discussion, sharing their experiences of making the transition from photography to video and discussing how photographers can get out from behind the camera and become Directors, Directors of Photography, and more.\n\n1.00pm: The Britons Editorial and portrait photographer Peter Dench, currently working on The Dench Dozen: Great Britons of photography, will talk about British identity and humour in photography as well as take questions about his book.\n\n1.45pm: Photo Cycles: How to Position Yourself in the Current Environment These days, it can feel like it’s not enough to simply sell yourself as a photographer.\n\nIn this seminar, Beth Taubner will reveal the emotional, psychological and analytical underpinnings as to why you need to be a brand, how to transform your career based on your own emotional centre, and how the marketplace really sees you. She will demystify some of the options available to maintain and expand your reach in the current complex environment, including expansion into areas such as motion, fine art, personal work, collaborations, or publishing your own book – all based on your own, highly developed point of view. Perfect for all levels.\n\n3.00pm: Importance of Personal Project Work Emma Taylor will be joined by a panel of photographers Dylan Collard and Jonathan Knowles along with Sarah Williams, Head of Art Buying at M&C to discuss why personal projects are so important not only to photographers but to agents and commissioners too.\n\n4.00pm: Making the leap into the Art World Laura Noble is the Director of L A Noble Gallery in London (LANG), curator of this year’s AOP Awards, a lecturer and the author of 'The Art of Collecting Photography'. She will be exploring themes and sharing insights into the sale of work through galleries, with a focus on editioning print terms and the presentation of your work online and in a gallery context. Laura will also discuss how the art world differs from commercial photographic practice. www.lauraannnoble.com\n\nBusiness & Legal Talks\n\nNick Dunmur, professional photographer and business and legal adviser to AOP members, will run 4 one-hour workshops/discussions as outlined below:\n\n11.00am and 2.00pm: The repeal of section 52 of the CDPA and what it means for professional photographers, plus updates on other areas of relevant legislation.\n\nThis workshop is primarily aimed at interiors, architectural and fashion and lifestyle photographers, or indeed any photographer who may wish to get a greater understanding of this recent change in legislation and what the implications are for their own practice. Time allowing, there will be the opportunity for discussion/Q&A on related topics.\n\n12.30pm and 3.30pm Best business practice for photographers and the paperwork trail\n\nThis workshop is aimed at anyone who wishes to get a firm(er) grip on the paperwork requirements for running a professional photography business. Many photographers will already have their own approach to this, but it can be useful to have assumptions challenged and/or perceptions reinforced. In times where clients often expect more for less, it is important to know how to minimise your own exposure to any sort of risk as a result of not having good paperwork in place.\n\nSaturday 15th October, 10:00 - 17:30\n\nTintypes display Throughout the day the winner of last year’s Commissioned Design Series category Tif Hunter will demonstrate the tintypes photographic process.\n\n11.00am: In Fashion? Fashion photographer and curator of Non Commissioned Fashion in this year’s Awards Perry Curties talks about his inspirations. He will also explain how photographers works alongside the fashion industry so that ideas remain fresh from season to season. perrycurties.co.uk\n\n12.00noon: The Photographers’ Dining Club Join us for a lunchtime takeover with the Photographers’ Dining Club and a host of special guests as we delve into all things analogue with everything from film, instant and more. photographersdiningclub.com\n\n2.00pm: Understanding What Your (Potential) Clients Want Diving into moving images means opening yourself up to a different kind of commissioner. As video takes over as the dominant digital ad format, metrics matter to buyers just as much as aesthetic. Having the knowledge of what makes an effective Facebook video, a gripping Instagram post, and an engaging YouTube campaign can make all the difference in a competitive pitch.

During the shoot they collaborated well, bouncing ideas off each other and producing some interesting images. The chemistry was instant. From that first shoot, they decided to team up as creative partners and Amit and Naroop Photography was formed.\n\nThe duo continued working within the music industry, developing their own distinct, intense visual style and honing their craft. They quickly built a name for themselves and began to get commissions from clients outside of the music industry.\n\nOver the last ten years they have continued to broaden their horizons and their work has expanded to embrace advertising and portraiture, all interpreted with their characteristic passion and style. Their large and diverse portfolio of work includes iconic portraits of musicians and celebrities such as Tinie Tempah, Dynamo Magician and comedian Ricky Gervais, along with advertising campaigns for the likes of Barclays, MTV, Sunsilk and Huawei.\n\nTheir skill and vision speaks for itself and the images they have produced illustrate a fantastic eye for detail and depth of knowledge.\n\nHaving achieved a great deal of success in a relatively short period of time, they embrace the opportunity to share their experiences with others: “As two self-taught photographers, we came from nothing and made a name for ourselves. We find it very rewarding to inspire others to follow their creative aspirations and dream big”.\n\nCherryduck is a creative video agency that uses social media data to create video content that gets results.
