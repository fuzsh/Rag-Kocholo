I am just shocked that as a mod you let yourself go.\n\nThen go call me an ass and exhibit plenty condescending attitude.\n\nAll this, and you are a mod. If pointing this out is getting under your skin...\n\nRather, provide documented evidence supporting your opinion as a contribution.\n\nI never said memes cannot be posted. I just want everyone to remain civil.\n\nYou said the above in response to my post 228. I am telling you that in post 228 you were not the mod, it was the other one.\n\nMaybe you're reading too much into it. I don't think L Luft.4 is trying to annoy you.\n\nExactly. I am apparently trying in vain to have those dismissing RLM directives over their own personal opinion to present some additional evidence to support their side.\n\nThere is NO WAY to match wreckage with a victorious pilot 80 years after the fact.\n\nYou have NO IDEA who shot down any wreckage you find today, much less back in 1946.\n\nErich Hartmann didn't have bullets that nobody else had and he didn't sign his bullets or paint them with dye marks.\n\nWhat you have is a theory and a paper case. That and a small bit of money will get you a cup of coffee, maybe.\n\nResearch is research; it isn't proof of anything except fodder to form a theory. Might be a good theory, and MIGHT even be true. Proving it is another matter entirely.\n\nI assume you have done research past reading books than have you? archival visits, field expeditions, communicating with the top echelon of researchers from various countries who write the book we read about? What you states is simply not true.\n\nOne is able to state who shot down who if enough data is gathered.\n\nMod, your post 335 is hardly civil man, thought that was what you asked for explicitly in post 295.

I am apparently trying in vain to have those dismissing RLM directives over their own personal opinion to present some additional evidence to support their side.\n\nI don't have to provide evidence for something I am not trying to prove or disprove. Nor do I have a desire to prove or disprove. I am merely playing devils advocate, and pointing out uncertainties in the data.\n\nHow about this. do not address me, and I will not address you. That is the best way to move forward.\n\nAnd another display of condescending attitude by the mod himself. Please go on, I believe you wanted to back in post 374 and even before.\n\nOn one hand you want civil discourse, on the other you state posts are bullshit.\n\nA hollow apology too then, eh?\n\nNo I apologized sincerely when I insulted you. I should not have called you an ass, regardless of how I felt. If you don't accept that, thats your problem, not mine.\n\nI won't apologize for saying the word bullshit, because I was not saying that about the person. I explained that to him as well, and he seems to understand that, and we have moved on. It's not hard to understand.\n\nSo I ask one final time for you to stop making something out of nothing. Drop it and move on. I said I am going to recuse myself from this discussion, and will only act as a moderator going forward. There is one thing you are correct on, that I should not let my feelings get the best of me. I have to be a moderator first. Believe it or not, I respect you for reminding me of that. I'm not the asshole you think I am.\n\nPeter Düttmann claimed a Boston at a location (can't recall from memory) at a time (can't recall from memory) and a Boston went down in the same location and same time.\n\nSoviet loss report mentions serial number of the Boston\n\nVerified Victories includes a picture of the Boston wreckage with the serial number intact and it matches the serial number in the loss report.\n\nClearly this was Düttmann's victory\n\nBecause something happened the way your pet theory wants it to happens does NOT prove your general theory. All it means is that your theory is possible because it has been demonstrated. Doesn't mean it holds all the time. Your refusal to even acknowledge that all levels of reports are triggered by the unit making the original claim is telling. If any claim were lost at the reporting unit and never made it any higher, it wouldn't show up anywhere else along the reporting chain. I know because it has happened.\n\nReporting in war is rarely very accurate. The report writer gets some details right, but misses very many others that absolutely stand out to another observer. It's the nature of human observation.\n\nAll you have to do is have 2 or 3 people watch an event, even a TV series for, say, 15 minutes. Then, without talking with one another, they all write a report on it. If you actually do this (I have), you're likely be hard-pressed to figure out they were all describing the same event unless they so state it at the start of the report.\n\nTry it. No coaching. Just ask them to observe and report independently without consulting one another.\n\nIt's a very interesting exercise.\n\nBecause something happened the way your pet theory wants it to happens does NOT prove your general theory.

The details will usually always be different in some way but they will still be close enough to be a match.\n\nYour refusal to even acknowledge that all levels of reports are triggered by the unit making the original claim is telling.\n\nI never denied this.\n\nIf any claim were lost at the reporting unit and never made it any higher, it wouldn't show up anywhere else along the reporting chain. I know because it has happened.\n\nThis couldn't happen with Soviet losses though, because there would still be the missing pilots. The missing personnel was also recorded separately and so you'd have to assume the unit report goes missing and the personnel report. There are also multiple copies of the same report with there usually being up to 3 copies.\n\nSo you think that all 3 personnel reports and 3 unit reports would get lost.\n\nAnd the personnel report would have been recorded at the same time as the unit report because the personnel report belongs to the unit report.\n\nBecause something happened the way your pet theory wants it to happens does NOT prove your general theory.

If I'm attacking you, you'll know it. Subtlety isn't a strong suit for me.\n\nSo I'll say it bluntly. The world is not anywhere near as orderly as you seem to believe, particularly during wartime. Wartime reporting is flawed to a high degree in general. Yes, there are specific instances of great reports ... but they are the exception, not the rule.\n\nLife is simply not as well ordered as you believe. Incorrect reports happen all the time, all over the world, even in the best of organizations, of which any military organization is generally not a member. Most military services have some good people. But, by the law of averages, they also have the people who don't really care and are just there because of lack of options. Unfortunately, they tend to wind up with more than their share of the less than average in the clerk pool."
