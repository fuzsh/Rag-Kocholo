        "text": "Beroun and associated communities German: Beraun A district town in Bohemia, Czech Republic Beroun is located 19 miles (30km) southwest of Prague. Until 1918 the area was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the collapse of the empire following World War I, and until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Since 1993 it has been part of the Czech Republic. The Jewish cemetery of Beroun is owned by the Jewish community of Prague, which rents out parts of the cemetery for gardening in order to pay the caretaker. The cemetery contains hundreds of graves, from 1885 when the cemetery was established through the 20th century. Gravestones are written in Hebrew, German, and/or Czech, and among the tombstones are several family memorials. The house where bodies were taken for preparation for burial also remains standing within the cemetery. A plaque by the main entrance commemorates the founders of the local chevra kaddisha, and lists rules related to proper behavior within the cemetery. The cemetery has been maintained throughout the 21st century. HISTORY Beroun was not only the location of its own Jewish community, it was also the center for a number of Jewish villages and other small settlements in the surrounding area, where Jews made up less than 3% of the total population. Though Beroun saw its first Jewish resident in 1678, Mates Fiser who had been invited to the village to practice tanning, a Jewish community was not established until 1849, when the residence restrictions for Jews were lifted. Beroun had a synagogue, a Jewish school, and a cemetery which was established in 1885/1886. In 1910 there were 402 Jews living in Beroun, though that number had dropped to 290 by 1921. Rudolf Roubicek was the president of the community in 1921 and Rivrid Kraus was the rabbi, serving both Beroun and the surrounding communities. During the 1930s Dr. Moritz Mueller served as the community's rabbi and also taught Jewish studies. Following is information about some of the affiliated communities in the area: Horovice, which is located approximately 12 miles (19km) southwest of Beroun, saw its first Jews arrive during the 15th century, though they were no longer allowed to live within the town's walls during the 17th and 19th centuries. A Jewish community was reorganized in Horovice in 1875 and a synagogue was built in 1903. A traveling rabbi from Strakonice, Rabbi J. Flaschner, taught Jewish children. The Jews of Horovice were also served by the cemetery in Praskolesy. In 1910 there were 279 Jews living in Horovice. By 1921 that number had dropped to 215, and by 1930 there were only 50 Jews left in the town. Joseph Abeles was among the leaders of the community. Hostomice, a small town 6 miles (10km) east of Horovice. This community had a prayer house in a private home, and founded a cemetery during the first half of the 19th century. During the second half of the 19th century, against a backdrop of struggles between national Czechs and Germans, riots broke out against the Jews, whom the Czechs regarded as Germans. Among the heads of this community was Moritz Novak. Liten (German: Litten), which is located 5 miles (8km) southeast of Beroun, granted the Jews living there full residence rights particularly early, allowing them to live among their Christian neighbors and not in a separate area. In 1680 Count Jaroslav Kunata granted the community permission to establish a cemetery, which also served other small Jewish communities in the area; later, a wooden tombstone dated from 1843 was transferred to the Jewish National museum in Prague. Count Kunata also allowed the community to build a synagogue and a school. In 1715 there were four Jewish families (22 people) living in Liteny. By 1793 that number had grown to 23 families (102 people), and in 1849 the number of Jews living in the town was 190. Following the emancipation of the Jews of Bohemia in 1848 many Jews moved to bigger towns and cities, depleting the communities in more rural areas. By 1890 the number of Jews living in Liten had dropped to 52; by 1930 there were only 13 Jews remaining. Bestine had a prayer house and Vseradice had an older synagogue which, by the 20th century, had fallen into disuse. Morina is located approximately 6 miles (10km) east of Beroun. A small Jewish community was established in the village in 1760, but it was officially organized during the second half of the 19th century, though a cemetery had been established earlier. The western part of the town included a small Jewish Quarter with 8 houses, including a synagogue that would exist until 1907. During the first half of the 19th century there were 16 families living in Morina. The Jewish population steadily declined throughout the years, and in 1908 the community of Morina was united with the community of Beroun. Dr. Jakob Eduard Pollak, the personal physician of the Persian Shah and who helped introduce modern medicine to Iran, was originally from Morina. Tetin, one of the most ancient Jewish communities in Bohemia, is located approximately 3 miles (5km) northwest of Liten and 4 miles (6.5km) from Beroun. Tetin's community was independent, and contained a synagogue, a cemetery, a mikvah, a community house, and a Jewish school. The Jews left the village in 1872 and the Torah scrolls and other ritual objects, along with the school and office equipment, were moved to Beroun. The community house and synagogue were bought by the nobleman Jan Vojacek, who made sure that the synagogue was used only for religious purposes and that the community building served to aid the public. Most of the Jews living in Beroun and its associated communities were traders and artisans and, beginning in the 19th century, a number also worked as professionals. All of the communities associated with Beroun had their own active chevra kaddisha. In 1930 there were approximately 113 Jews living in Beroun. THE HOLOCAUST Following the Munich Agreement of September 29, 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. The areas of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany on March 15, 1939, after which the Jews living in the area were gradually deprived of their rights and properties. Beginning in November 1941 the Germans concentrated the Jews remaining in the Czech territory in the Terezin (German: Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, mainly in Poland, where most were killed. Before their expulsions, 295 documents, 6 books, and 98 ritual objects were transferred to the central Jewish museum in Prague. Ninety-two additional ritual objects were transferred from Hostomice. After the war, Jewish life was not revived in Beroun or the surrounding areas. The synagogue and Jewish school in Beroun were turned into an art and music school. The Horovice Synagogue was used by the Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren. They synagogue in Letiny was repurposed as a fire station. The synagogue in Tetin was destroyed in 1974.\n\nBeroun\n\nBoskovice German: Boskowitz A town in south Moravia, Czech Republic The town of Boskovice was founded during the 15th century and is located about 20 miles (32km) northeast of Brno, the capital of Moravia. Until 1918 the area was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the collapse of the empire following World War I, and until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Since 1993 it has been part of the Czech Republic. Of Boskovice's three synagogues, only the Great Synagogue survived World War II. Conservation and restoration work was carried out during the late 1980s, and by 1994 most of the structural issues and exterior conservation work had been done. Between 2000 and 2002 the remaining preservation work was carried out, thanks to grants from a number of organizations, including the World Monument Fund's Jewish Heritage Program. The fully restored building remains standing in its original location. The location of Boskovice's first cemetery is unknown. However, a second cemetery, which was most likely established during the 17th century, still exists. The tomb of Rabbi Samuel ben Nathan HaLevi Kolin, the author of Makhatsit HaShekel and the director of the town's yeshiva for more than 60 years, can be found there. Since 1993 the town has hosted an annual summer cultural festival dedicated to preserving and restoring the town's Jewish quarter. HISTORY The Jewish community of Boskovice was among the oldest in Moravia; during the reign of Karl IV in the 14th century it was also one of the largest. A tombstone from the year 1069 is the earliest evidence of a Jewish presence in Boskovice; later, a court document from 1243 also evidences a Jewish presence there. In 1454 the Jews were expelled from the royal towns of Moravia (free towns not under regional jurisdiction) and some, particularly from Brno, came to Boskovice. Jewish residence was limited to a Jewish street, and on Sundays and Christian holidays Jews were forbidden from entering other parts of the town. The overcrowding in the Jewish Quarter could be dangerous; in 1715 an epidemic broke out within the Jewish Quarter, leaving 892 dead and the Jewish Quarter quarantined for a year. A fire that broke out on May 1, 1823 destroyed the entire Jewish Quarter, along with 20 houses from the Christian part of the town. A cholera epidemic in 1866 during the Prussian War claimed many Jewish victims, and turned the Jewish school into a temporary hospital. Another fire broke out in 1882, and in 1906 there was an explosion in a warehouse owned by a Jewish merchant in which 40 Jewish people perished. By the 16th century there were enough Jews living in Boskovice that they established, and subsequently expanded, a cemetery. During the 17th century the community formed a more formal organizational structure and was led by a Jewish official who was responsible for arbitrating internal issues, as well as a committee of \"Landesaltester:\" rabbis, religious judges, and melamdim (teachers). There were three synagogues: the Great Synagogue, which was built in 1698 and subsequently renovated three times, a second synagogue that was built during the 18th century and which also served as a beit midrash, and a third synagogue financed by the Low-Beer family that was built in 1884. The Jewish school also had a place to pray, and for Rosh Hashana additional prayer services were set up in the Jewish kindergarten (which later served as a gathering place for the community). Boskovice became a well-known religious center. Among the rabbis serving the community were Rabbi Yehudah Oppenheim of Worms, Rabbi Nehemia Yaffe of Krakow, Rabbi Natan Adler, Rabbi Issachar Baer Bloch of Hamburg, Rabbi Mosher Sofer, Rabbi Shmuel Halevy Kolin and his son Rabbi Benjamin Zeev Boskovic who founded a yeshiva in the town, Rabbi Avraham Platzek, who served as the chief rabbi of Moravia between 1851 and 1884, and Rabbi Salomon Funk. The last rabbi to serve the community was Isidor Reich. Many of these rabbis wrote influential books, while some were also active in the Zionist movement. A Jewish school is referenced in 1591. Over time additional classes were added for boys and girls, who were taught separately. In 1855 the school was turned into a Hauptschule (a German secondary school), and was considered to be one of the best Jewish schools in Moravia. The community established a Jewish hospital, a mikvah, a chevra kaddisha, an organization to support the sick, a loan society, a women's society, and a first aid organization. There were also several Jewish firefighters and policemen. During the summer of 1938 a course for training Jewish teachers was held in the town. In the beginning, the Jews of Boskovice were subject to economic restrictions; in 1565 they were allowed to own land, but were forbidden from supplying goods to the villages. During the 17th and 18th centuries most worked as traders and artisans but over the course of the 19th century Boskovice became a center for the new ready-made clothing industry, due particularly to the Schwarz, Ticho, Munk, and Low-Beer families, who established textile factories in the town. In addition to funding the construction of a new synagogue, mentioned previously, the Low-Beer family also established a number of charitable organizations to serve the Jews of Boskovice. Others worked in professionals fields and as artists. The eye specialist Dr. Avraham Ticho, the historian Oscar K. Rabinovitz, the German writer and member of the Prague Circle Herman Unger, and Dr. Moritz (Moshe) Zobel, one of the chief editors of the German-language Encyclopedia Judaica, were from Boskovice. After 1848, when the Jews of Moravia received full civil and religious rights, a number of civil, social, and economic activities became available to the Jews of the area. This prompted many to leave for larger towns and cities, particularly Brno and Vienna. However, the town was a popular vacation spot and during the interwar period the town's population would increase during the summer. A sports organization was formed in 1909 which, during the 1920s, became a chapter of Maccabi. A Zionist organization was also founded around the same time. The organization Agudas Yisroel was also active. Students formed a vacation organization for the promotion of Zionism during their vacations, and in 1926 the Jews of Boskovice contributed in order to receive membership and voting rights at the Zionist Congress; during the elections to the 20th Zionist congress in 1937, there were 37 Jews from Boskovice who voted. In 1930, after the Republic of Czechoslovakia recognized the Jews as a national minority, more than 75% of the community declared themselves as belonging to the Jewish nation. In 1793 there were 300 Jewish families living in Boskovice; by 1830 there were 326 families (a total of 1,595 people), and by 1857 there were 2,018 Jews living in Boskovice. Towards the end of the 19th century, Jews began moving to larger towns and cities, resulting in a population decline. By 1900 there were 598 Jews living in Boskovice and 116 houses were owned by Jews. In 1930 there were 395 Jews living in Boskovice (about 6% of the total population). THE HOLOCAUST Following the Munich Agreement of September 29, 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. The areas of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany on March 15, 1939, after which the Jews living in the area were gradually deprived of their rights and properties. Beginning in November 1941 the Germans concentrated the Jews remaining in the Czech territory in the Terezin (German: Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, mainly in Poland, where most were killed. Approximately 473 Jews from Boskovice and the surrounding area were killed during the Holocaust. Before the expulsion from Boskovice, 1,244 documents, 139 books, and 351 ritual articles belonging to the community were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. After the war, very few Jews returned to Boskovice. Of those who chose to remain in the country, many settled in Brno. In 1948 there were 60 Jews registered in the community of Boskovice. An additional 27 Jews were not registered. During the 1980s the Jewish Quarter was still well-preserved.\n\nBoskovice\n\nBRANDYS NAD LABEM (in German: Brandeis an der Elbe) A town in the center of Bohemia, Czech Republic. Brandys was founded at the beginning of the 14th century and is situated on the Laba river, 20 kilometers north-east of Prague. There are in this town a preserved castle, the remnants of an ancient bridge, and churches built in gothic and renaissance styles. Until 1918 the area belonged to the Austro-Hungarian empire and since 1918 till 1993 to the Czechoslovak republic. The first Jews came to Brandys apparently in the 16th century and were permitted to settle in a few houses by the watermill at the foot of the palace. There they established some sort of a school and a prayer place. The Jews of the town were obliged to wear “Jewish clothes” in order to distinguish them from the other residents. In 1559 king Ferdinand I ordered to expel all Jews from Bohemia. The Jews of Brandys, hoping to come back soon, deposited their property and the synagogue in the hands of the leaders of the town. The emperor Maximilian, the heir of Ferdinand, actually permitted their return in the year 1568. The very same year a cemetery was consecrated half a kilometer north-west of the central square. In the course of the years a funeral building was constructed and in it a residence for the guard of the cemetery. The Jews that came to this town after the expulsion occupied houses also outside the palace area, in a street later known as “the Jew’s street”. The Jewish community was headed by two “elders of the community”. In 1648, at the end of the 30 years war (1618-1648), many Jews abandoned Brandys, leaving their property behind. Other Jews who wished to settle in Brandys met difficulties, since the residents complained that the number of Jews settling in Brandys grew enormously. In 1705 the authorities permitted 7 Jewish families and 4 single Jews to live at this town. Moreover, they were forbidden to allow visiting Jews from other places to stay at their homes. In 1723 22 Jewish families resided in Brandys. The law passed by the emperor Karl VI (1726) limited the number of Jewish families in the towns of the empire, and in 1746, when the Jews were expelled from Prague, more Jews came to Brandys. Some of them were obliged to convert to Christianity, and then they were permitted to live outside the ghetto. In the small Jewish community of Kostelec Nad Labem, 7 kilometers north-west of Brandys, 5 Jewish families and several Jewish bachelors lived. The bachelors were permitted to establish families only if they did not exceed the number of families allowed in this little town. The Jews of Kostelec had a cemetery and a school and in 1886 they acquired a hayloft, which they turned into a synagogue. Until the end of the 18th century the Jews in this area spoke Czech and Hebrew. Following the “tolerance edict” (1782) by emperor Joseph II, whose object was to bring the minorities closer to the German culture, some of the limitations were lifted; they opened in Brandys a Jewish elementary school, where they taught in the German language. A hevra-kaddisha was founded at Brandys in 1795. In 1797 the Jewish houses were numbered by Latin numbers, in order to differentiate them from the Christian homes which bore regular numbers. In 1786 some Jews were already permitted to rent appartments in gentile houses. The synagogue was erected in the years 1828 - 1829, north-west of the ancient center of the town, where the ancient prayer place of the 16th century was. Close to the synagogue a new community center was erected, where the community officials lived and a four classes school was established. In 1893 380 Jews were registered in the Brandys community. Famous rabbis were active in the Brandys community from the start. At the beginning of the 20th century rabbi M. Mandl served as rabbi. The first Jews in Brandys and Kostelec made a living as peddlers, money lenders and lessees of estates and enterprises. There were among them a few merchants, who dealt mainly in cattle, meat, yarns, fabrics and spices. The merchants had their stores in their homes. Already in the 16th century the craftsmen and butchers among the gentiles objected to the settlement of Jews for fear of competition, and only in the 18th century were some Jewish merchants permitted to have sale stalls at the market. The local authorities were interested in the Jews because of the high taxes which they paid and because of their contribution to the town’s economy. In the course of the 2nd half of the 19th century there were among the Jews also professionals. In 1848 the Jews of the Austrian empire received full citizen rights and became an integral part of the society. Following the lifting of limitations on Jews, many Jews left Brandys for the larger towns and the community gradually declined. Between the two world wars, most of the Jews spoke Czech. In 1920 the Jews in Czechoslovakia were recognized as a national- cultural minority. In 1921 272 Jews (6% of the population) were registered in the community, headed by Dr. Richard Ullmann. 13 of them declared they belonged to the Jewish nation, the rest declared themselves as Czechs. Brandys is the origin of the Jewish family name Brandeis. In 1930 there were 60 Jews living in Brandys. The Holocaust Period The Munich agreement of September 1938 caused the dismemberment of the Czechoslovak republic about a year before the outbreak of World War II. On March 15 1939 the Germans entered the Czech territory (Bohemia and Moravia) and declared it a protectorate of the Third Reich. The Jews were gradually deprived of their rights and properties and finally in 1941 the Jews of the protectorate were sent to the ghetto of Terezin (Theresienstadt) from where they were deported to death camps, mainly in Poland. Most of them were murdered by the Germans. Before their expulsion 75 ritual articles and 11 books of the community were sent to the central Jewish museum in Prague. After the war there was no Jewish community life in Brandys. The synagogue was turned into a warehouse. In the cemetery, as in Prague, the tombstones are very close to one another. Some very old renaissance and baroque tombstones are preserved.\n\nBRANDYS NAD LABEM\n\nBratislava German: Pressburg, Hungarian: Pozsony Capital of Slovakia. Part of Hungary until 1918 Bratislava was the chartered capital of the kings of Hungary. It was one of the most ancient and important Jewish centers in the Danube region. The first Jews probably arrived with the Roman legions, but the first documented evidence of their presence in the city dates from the 13th century. In 1291 the community was granted a charter by King Andrew the III and a synagogue is first mentioned in 1335. The Jews of Bratislava mainly engaged in moneylending, but there were also merchants, artisans, vineyard owners, and vintners. The Jews were expelled from Hungary in 1360, but returned in 1367. In 1371 the municipality introduced the Judenbuch, which regulated financial dealings between Jews and Christians. Money matters between Jews and Christians, however, could unexpectedly take complicated turns. King Sigismund granted Christians an exemption for the year 1392 from paying interest on loans borrowed from Jews. Later, in 1441 and 1450, all outstanding debts owed to Jews were cancelled, and in 1475 Jews were forbidden from accepting real estate as security. Ladislas II prevented Jews from attempting to leave Bratislava in 1506 by confiscating the property of those who had already left. This proved to be somewhat ironic since the Jews were eventually expelled from Bratislava, and Hungary as a whole, in 1526. Instead, the Jews began settling in the surrounding areas of Shlossberg and Zuckermandel. A Jewish community was not reestablished in Bratislava until the end of the seventeenth century when Samuel Oppenheimer resettled the city. He was followed by other Jews, some of whom were born locally and others who came from Vienna, which had expelled its Jews in 1670, Bohemia and Moravia, as well as a small number from Poland. A synagogue was built in 1695 where the first known rabbi to work there was Yom Tov Lipmann. In 1699 the court Jew Simon Michael, who had settled in Bratislava in 1693, was appointed as head of the community. He built a beit midrash and bought land to build a cemetery. During the 18th and 19th centuries the Jews of Bratislava were leaders in both the business and religious worlds. In business they were among the leaders of the textile trade, while the religious leader Rabbi Moses Sofer (better known as the Hatam Sofer) turned Bratislava into a center of Jewish life. The Hatam Sofer became a leader of Orthodoxy, and is perhaps best known for his (ironically radical) statement that \"He-hadash asur min haTorah,\" \"Innovation is forbidden according to the Torah.\" His status as a rabbi, teacher, scholar, rosh yeshiva, and halakhist was unparalleled. Upon his death his son, Avraham Shmuel Binyamin (otherwise known as the Ketav Sofer) and then his grandson Simcha Bumen, and his great-grandson Akiva succeeded him in turn. Other outstanding rabbis that served in the city before the Hatam Sofer were Moshe Harif of Lemberg, Akiva Eger (the elder), Yitzhak Landau of Kukla, Meir Barbi of Halberstadt, and Meshulam Igra of Tymenitsa. Each was an outstanding Talmudic scholar, and Landau and Barbi established large and prestigious yeshivas. In spite of the Hatam Sofer's uncompromising Orthodoxy, the Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment) made important inroads, particularly among the wealthy merchants and intellectuals in the city. In 1820 those who were in favor of the Haskalah succeeded in establishing an elementary school that combined religious and secular studies. Shortly thereafter the community's Orthodox majority also built a Talmud Torah that combined religious and secular studies, under the supervision of the city's chief rabbi. The community was also split during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. While those who were in favor of reform, led by Adolf Neustadt, enthusiastically supported the revolution, joining the National Guard and advocating for Jewish emancipation, the Orthodox leadership distanced themselves from these actions. Anti-Jewish riots subsequently broke out during the revolution around Easter; the Jews of Bratislava suffered the worst violence. While no Bratislavan Jews were killed, there were many who were severely beaten, and there was enormous damage done to property. The Jewish Quarter was placed under military protection, and Jews who lived elsewhere had to move within it. The violence prompted calls to emigrate to the US. The Revolution of 1848 would not be the last time that the Jews of Bratislava were the victims of pogroms and anti-Jewish violence. 1850 saw more anti-Jewish riots around the holiday of Easter. Further outbreaks of anti-Jewish violence followed the Tiszaeszlar blood libel in 1882 and 1883, as well as after other blood libels in 1887 and 1889. Tensions continued to grow between the Orthodox and the maskilim within the community. After 1869 the Orthodox, Neologist, and Status Quo Ante factions in Bratislava formed separate congregations. The Orthodox provincial office (Landseskanzlei) later became notorious for its opposition to Zionism. The Neolog and Status Quo Ante congregations united in 1928 as the Jeshurun Federation. Jewish institutions in Bratislava included religious schools, charitable organizations, and a Jewish hospital. The Hungarian Zionist organization was founded in Bratislava in 1902, and the World Mizrachi Organization was founded in 1904; the latter sparked protests from over 100 rabbis. The first Hungarian Zionist Congress was held in Bratislava in March 1903 and the city became the Hungarian center for the Zionist Organization in Hungary. With the establishment of Czechoslovakia, Bratislava also became the center of Agudas Yisroel in Czechoslovakia, in addition to remaining a Zionist center. Several Jewish newspapers and a Hebrew weekly, \"HaYehudi,\" were printed in the city. There were also over 300 Hebrew and Yiddish books printed in the city between 1831 and 1930. The Orthodox Jewish Communities of Slovakia was established in the city, enabling the Orthodox community to cut ties with Hungary. The German army occupied Czechoslovakia in March, 1938 and soon established an independent Slovak state. Even before the declaration of the independent state, there were attacks on the synagogue and yeshiva on November 11, 1938. Nearly 1,000 Jewish students were expelled from the university and anti-Jewish terror, restrictive measures, and pogroms increased. With the establishment of the Slovak state, Jews continued to suffer from discrimination. Akiva Shreiber and a number of his yeshiva students succeeded in leaving Bratislava for Palestine at the end of 1939. Nonetheless, the Jewish population of Bratislava peaked in 1940 at 18,000 people (13% of the total population of the city). This was in spite of the fact that Jewish organizations, with the exception of religious communal activities, were prohibited from organizing activities. Additionally, Jews were evicted from various neighborhoods, Jewish students were expelled from public schools, and Jewish properties were confiscated. By the fall of 1941 about half of the city's population had been forcibly sent from the city to the provinces; by the summer of 1942 two-thirds of the Jews of Bratislava were sent to concentration or extermination camps. Gisi Fleischmann of WIZO and Mikhael Dov Ber Weissmandel began organizing an underground resistance movement. They contacted international Jewish organizations, in the hopes that they could save the Jews who remained in the city and the surrounding area. August 1944 saw a Slovak uprising, and the country was subsequently occupied by the Germans. At that point, the remaining Jews in Bratislava were deported. In the end, approximately 13,000 Jews from Bratislava were killed during the Holocaust. After the war, the city was an important transit point for the thousands of displaced Jews who were making their way to other countries and began to rebuild. The Orthodox and Neolog communities united and maintained two cemetaries, a mikvah, a slaughterhouse, a soup kitchen, a matzah bakery, a Jewish hospital, an old age home, and a Jewish orphanage. Zionist activity resumed; HaShomer HaTzair and Bnei Akiva led activities for orphans preparing to emigrate to Mandate Palestine. Maccabi HaTzair and Beitar were also active. Though there was an attempt to reopen the Pressburg Yeshiva, it ultimately failed. After the communist takeover, thousands more Jews left the city, most of whom went to Israel. According to an agreement made with Israel, 4,000 Jews were permitted to leave and enter Israel at the end of the 1940s while 2,000 remained in Bratislava. In 1969 there were 1,500 Jews in the city. The 1990s saw the opening of a number of memorials and places of Jewish interest. A Jewish cultural heritage museum was opened in the old Jewish Quarter. A memorial plaque was added to the Orthodox cemetery in memory of the 13,000 Jewish victims of Bratislava who were killed during the Holocaust. Additionally, in 1997 a monument commemorating the Slovakian Jewish victims of the Nazis was erected on the site where the Pressburg Yeshiva once stood. Jewish organizations and municipal authorities worked together to renovate and reopen the grave of the Hatam Sofer, among other rabbis, to the public. In the year 2000 there were 800 Jews living in Bratislava.\n\nBratislava\n\nBrno (Bruenn in German) A provincial capital in Moravia, Czech republic. Brno was granted the status of a city in 1243 and until 1640 served alternately with Olomouc as the capital of Moravia. Between 1640-1948 Brno was the sole capital. Brno was the second largest city in Czechoslovakia. It was a cultural, commercial and industrial centre for textiles, automobiles, railroad-cars, munitions (Bren machine-guns) and clothing. In the city ancient churches from the 14th century and the remains of an old fort still exist. Brno was known for its educational institutions in the German and Czech languages. Until 1918 the city was under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian empire and since then until 1993 a part of the Czechoslovak Republic. In 1254, Ottokar Przemysl II king of Moravia invited Jews to settle in Brno and granted them a letter of privileges. In the middle of the 14th century, there were 1,000 Jews in a special quarter of the city which one could enter only through the \"Jews gate\". At the head of the Jewish autonomous community was the \"Parnas\" who represented the Jews before the city and provincial authorities. The community institutions were financed by the taxes of its members. The community also paid a \"Jewish tax\" to the local authorities. As early as 1378 there was a Jewish school in the city. In the first half of the 15th century Israel Bruneh officiated as rabbi. During the period of the Hussite wars 1419-1436 the hatred against Jews increased causing the deaths of thousands of Jews and the destruction of many Jewish communities in Bohemia and Moravia, among them Brno. On November 11, 1454, King Ladislav Posthumus expelled the Jews of the city and gave the Jewish homes to the townspeople. For 400 years Jews were forbidden to live within the city walls. Only a few court Jews were allowed there. Jews who came to Brno could spend the night only in the suburb Kroena where a Jewish inn with a kosher kitchen had been established in 1660. The guests at the inn were forbidden to hold public prayer services, to go out at night or have any social contact with the local population. Only commercial relationships were permitted. In 1769 Jacov Dobrushka who leased the inn needed a special permit to pray in his home and keep a Torah scroll there. Jacob Frank, the founder of the Frankist movement and a relative of Dobrushka came to the city in 1773 and was active there until 1786. At the beginning of the 18th century there were 52 Jews who lived in the city illegally. In 1722, the city authorities allowed the chief Parnas of the Jews of Moravia to live near the city gate. The \"family law\" passed in 1726 by Emperor Karl VI which limited the number of Jews in Moravian cities and the head-taxes levied by queen Maria Theresa in 1744 were hard on the Jews of Moravia. An improvement in their condition came as a result of the \"toleration edict\" passed in 1782 by Emperor Joseph II, which allowed Jews to open schools, obtain higher education and work as artisans. The city municipal council appealed against the edict. The Jews of Brno attained these privileges only after some years. In 1797, 12 Jews lived in the city and 113 in the suburbs. In 1804 the number had increased to 199. In 1834 there were 135 Jews in the city. The total population was 17,262. In 1848 the Jews attained equal civil rights. The community began to organize its institutions. In 1852 a burial society was founded, permission was granted to appoint a rabbi and consecrate a cemetery. The first rabbi of the renewed community was David Ashkenazi, who still worked ostensibly as \"meat inspector\". The synagogue was founded in 1853. The prayer-house was established in 1883 and enlarged afterwards. In 1906 a new synagogue was built. In 1857 there were 2230 Jews among a population of 59,819. In 1859 the community was officially recognized. In 1860 Heinrich Kafka was chosen president of the community. Dr. Baruch Placzek was rabbi and during the period 1884-1922 he also served as chief rabbi of the country. A cantor also served the community. In 1861 the constitution of the community was approved by the authorities and a Jewish school with German as the language of instruction was opened. 77 boys and 76 girls studied there. In 1880 a ritual bath and a Matzoth factory were Bnei Brith chapter, a fraternity \"Societa\" for social services, a group to support yeshiva scholars and the \"Hort\" organization whose members were business men and clerks were founded. In 1890 the number of Jews in the city rose to 7,087. During World War I the community helped about 16,000 Jewish refugees who had come to the city from Galicia and Bukovina and also helped the Jewish soldiers stationed in the area. Some of the refugees remained in the city after the war. During the period of the Czechoslovak Republic (1918-1938) a new community council was chosen, a Jewish elementary school with five classes and a Jewish reformed science high school with eight classes (the only one in western Czechoslovakia) were opened. At first the language of instruction was German, later on Czech. Jewish students, many from Eastern Europe where they could not get an academic education because of Numerus Clausus (a law limiting the percentage of Jewish students) came to study in the institutions for higher learning in Brno. In 1922 there were 10,668 Jews in the city. The leaders of the community were Rabbi Dr. Ludwig Levi and Shmuel Beran the president. In 1931, the president of the community was the industrialist Julius Zwicker. During the 13th century, the Jews who settled in Brno enjoyed trading rights equal to those of the Christians and could buy houses and land. After the expulsion in 1454 every Jewish merchant who tried to trade in the city markets was punished. Only in the 16th century were Jews allowed to trade there after payment of double taxes and only twice a week, in spite of the revenue they brought to the city coffers. During the Thirty Years War which broke out in 1618, the Jews were the purveyers for the Kaiser's army and helped the cities by granting them loans. The guilds and townspeople opposed granting the Jews additional privileges in return. In 1753 Franz Joseph Neuman was granted permission to establish a Hebrew printing press and in 1765 Jews leased tobacco farms and a textile factory. After 1860 when Jews of Moravia were allowed to purchase real estate the development of trade and industry was rapid. Jews were prominent industrialists. They were also active in medicine, architecture, engineering, banking and other fields. World War I affected the economic conditions of the Jews adversely but during the period of the Czechoslovak Republic the community prospered once again. In Brno there were well-known Jewish artists, the poet Hieronymus Lorm, the writers Philip Langmen, Oscar Jelinik and Felix Langer, the singers Caroline Giperz and Leopold Demuth, the musicologist Paul Stephan, the violinist Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst and the composers Pavel Hass and Hans Shimring. Dr. Adolph Frankel of Brno was a theatre manager. From the beginning of their settlement in the city, the Jews were faced by the enmity of the town's people. The church at times incited outbursts of violence, like the pogroms which followed the black plague in 1348. Even after the Jews were given equal rights with the gentiles there were manifestations of anti-Semitism. Only in the second half of the 19th century there was an improvement in the status of the Jews in Christian society. At the end of the 19th century Zionist societies were organized (\"Theodor Herzl\" \"Zion\" \"Emuna\" (from which Poalei Zion developed afterwards) and \"Zfira\". The students society \"Veritas\" spread the Zionist ideology, helped found a students hostel, and organized a \"Jewish Soldiers Council\" fearing anti-Semitic activities as a result of the declaration of the Czechoslovak Republic. This group later founded the Jewish peoples council in Brno (the Moravian chapter of the National Jewish Council founded in Prague in 1918.) The Czechoslovak Republic in the period between the two world wars granted the Jews national cultural autonomy. The \"Juedische Akademische Lese Und Rede Halle\" was founded in Brno. Many Jewish students from the provincial towns and neighboring countries were active within this framework. The Jews of Brno were also active in political affairs. Dr Adolph Stranski was a member of the Austrian parliament and during the period of the Republic was a member of the senate. His son, Yaroslav Stranski was minister of justice in the Czech government in exile in London during World War II and during the years 1945-48 was minister of education. Dr. Ludwig Czech was vice-chairman of the German social-democratic party for 18 years and served in turn as minister of social welfare, minister of public works and minister of health. Johann Pollack was a member of the senate. Ziegfried Taub was a member of parliament. Dr. Czech and Johann Pollach were killed in the Terezin ghetto. In the municipal council elections held in 1919 one representative of the Poalei Zion was elected and three of the Jewish national list. In 1921 the headquarters of the federation of Zionist organizations was established in Brno. Dr. Alfred Engel and Dr. Adolf Greenfeld of Brno were on the central committee. Branches of \"Hitachdut\", \"Hamizrahi\", \"Revisionist Zionist\", \"Wizo\" (from 1934) and \"General Zionists\" (from 1934) were active in the city. \"Poalei Zion\" opened a branch in 1921 and Siegfried Spitz of Brno was head of the youth department in all of Czechoslovakia. The Zionist youth movements, \"Hashomer Hazair\", \"Tchelet Lavan\", \"Maccabi Hazair\" and \"Bnei Akiva\" competed in efforts to gain members. A Jewish sport club was active in Brno from 1907. From 1924, Brno was the regional centre of Maccabi and the centre of Bar-Kochba in Moravia and Silesia. In 1927 Dr. Karl Sonnenfeld of Brno was vice-president of world Maccabi. In 1931, five Jews from Brno were members of the central committee of the newly-founded Jewish party. Among the Jewish weeklies in the city were the \"Juedische Volksstimme (voice of the Jewish People) published by Max Hickl and \"Juedische Sozialist\" (the Jewish socialist) and \"Der Neue Weg\" (the new way) by Hugo Gold. In 1938 there were 11,003 Jews in the city. The Holocaust Period After the annexation of Austria to Germany (March 1938) many Jewish refugees arrived in Brno and were in need of help from the community. In September 1938 a year before the outbreak of World War II the Czechoslovak Republic was dissolved as a result of the Munich pact. At the end of 1938 more than 1,000 Jews emigrated to Eretz Israel, most of them illegally, only a few had valid certificates. On March 15, 1939 the German army occupied the Czech lands (Bohemia and Moravia) and the country became a protectorate of the Third Reich. The main synagogue in Brno was wrecked that same day and the small synagogue bombed afterwards. A few days later the jails of the Gestapo were filled with Jewish prisoners who were then sent to the concentration camp Mauthausen. On October 1, there were only 9.726 Jews in the city. At the end of 1939, the Germans forbade Jewish emigration. The fascist rule removed the Jews step by step from the cultural, social and economic life. At the beginning of October 1941 there were 11,102 Jews in the city. A short time later the systematic transfer of Czech Jews into ghettos and death camps began. On November 18, 1941 the first transport of 1,000 men, women and children was sent to Minsk in Belorussia. Many died there within two weeks because of shortages of water and medicines. The weak were taken outside the ghetto and shot to death or murdered in special gas-trucks. The bodies were thrown into a pit in the nearby forest. From this transport only eleven Jews survived. Between December 2, 1941 and July 1, 1943 9,064 Jews in eleven transports arrived in Terezin. Some died there but most of them were killed in the death camps in Poland especially Auschwitz. Only 684 Jews survived. Jews married to gentiles were left in the city. They were deported in 1945 but most of them survived. Many Jews from Brno served on the eastern front in the framework of the Czech units of the red army. After the liberation of the city by the Red Army, and until April 30, 1945, 804 survivors returned to the city. They renewed the activities of the community, repaired the orthodox synagogue and opened an old- age home. Dr. Richard Feder was appointed rabbi. A chazan was also employed. The community provided services for the Jews of Kyjov, Olomouc and Ostrava. In 1969 rabbi Feder also served as chief rabbi of Moravia and Bohemia. In 1948 there were 1,398 Jews in the community. During the fifties a memorial was erected for the victims of the Holocaust. During that period the number of Jews in the city and its environs declined to 900. As a result of the Russian invasion in 1698 most of the Jews left the city but returned afterwards. In 1969 there were 700 Jews there. In 1973 about 500 Jews were registered in the community. The total population of the city was 330,000. The number of Jews in the city not registered in the community is not known. By the early 2000s the number had dropoped to slightly less than 300. the community was responsible for the management of 10 synagogues and 45 cemeteries throughout Moravia, including restoration work.\n\nBRNO\n\nBudyne nad Ohri German: Budin, Budin an der Eger A town in north Bohemia, Czech Republic The cemetery of Budyne is located near privately-owned farmland and a fruit orchard. In addition to a number of gravestones dating from the end of the 18th century until the 20th century, there is also a pre-burial house with a tahara (where the body is prepared for burial) on the cemetery grounds. Tombstone inscriptions are written in Hebrew, German, and Czech. HISTORY Budyne nad Ohri is located about 4 miles (6km) east of town of Libochovice. Until 1918 the area was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the collapse of the empire following World War I, and until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Since 1993 it has been part of the Czech Republic. By the 13th and 14th centuries there were already Jews living in Budyne. From 1336 until 1848, when the Jews of Bohemia were emancipated and received the rights of citizenship, the Jews lived under the protection of the nobles of the houses of Hazmburk, Sternberg, and Dietrichstein. The Jewish Quarter was located in the northern part of the town, close to the wall. One of the more interesting pieces of evidence attesting to a Jewish presence in Budyne is a Hebrew inscription that was discovered in the building of a flour mill. The plaque, which indicates that a Jewish man named Avraham was the leased the old mill by Jan of Hazmburk in 1536 in order to fund a journey to Palestine, was reaffixed over the entrance to the newer mill. Most of the town's Jews originally worked as moneylenders and merchants. According to the Numerus Secundus laws of 1650, the Jews were permitted to trade, to set up stands at the marketplace, and to participate in fairs. They then began trading mainly in skins, furs, wool, grain, cattle, meat, and dried fish. They also owned vineyards and from 1691 until 1871 they supplied liquor to the nobility. By 1632 the community purchased and established a building as a prayer house and opened a school; the synagogue would later be burned down in 1759 and rebuilt in 1821. Many members of the community were forced to sell their houses including the community building, to their Czech neighbors after a 1676 ruling that forbade Jews from owning property alongside that of non-Jews. A year later the community building was returned to Jewish owners. The cemetery was located close to the wall, behind the tower however, in 1670 the mayor of the town took the tombstones and used them in order to pave the town's wine cellar. In 1707 the Jewish community bought land for a street in order to allow for a more direct route to the cemetery. As a result of the decree of Emperor Joseph II in 1785 that forbade the existence of cemeteries within a city's walls, the community was forced to relocate the cemetery. In 1715, after a plague that broke out in the Jewish Quarter, the Jews were quarantined in a field outside of the town. Relatively shortly thereafter, the \"Law of Families\" decreed by Emperor Karl VI of 1726 limited the number of Jewish families in Budyne to 32. During the 19th century the school's location kept shifting according to where the teacher was living. It was only in 1859, thanks to the donation of Mrs. Gavriella Taussig, that a building was erected for a school. The language of instruction was German, but Hebrew was also taught and beginning in 1870 schools were also required to teach the Czech language. The community also had a private school. Towards the end of the 19th century, following the migration of Jews all over the region to bigger towns and cities, the private school and the community school were closed down, at which point the Jewish children went to the general school where the language of instruction was Czech; what was once the school building was converted into a residence for the rabbi. Among the rabbis in the community were Rabbi Jacob Loewenfeld, Rabbi Jacob Langfelder, Rabbi Naftali Koch, and Rabbi Moritz Lemberger. For several years after Rabbi Lemberger served the community there were only melamdim (teachers) and no officially appointed rabbi. In 1897 Bernard Levy was appointed as the community's rabbi and, for the first time, he was permitted as a rabbi to marry couples; until then only the rabbis of Prague were allowed to perform wedding ceremonies. Budyne had a chevra kaddisha, a Bikkur Holim, and a Tehum Shabbat. The community had a special custom of celebrating the festival of Sukkot outside of the walls. By 1930 there were 39 Jews living in Budyne. THE HOLOCAUST Following the Munich Agreement of September 29, 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. The areas of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany on March 15, 1939, after which the Jews living in the area were gradually deprived of their rights and properties. Beginning in November 1941 the Germans concentrated the Jews remaining in the Czech territory in the Terezin (German: Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, mainly in Poland, where most were killed. Before the expulsion from Budyne, 47 ritual articles were transferred to the Jewish Museum in Prague. After the war the synagogue was converted into a warehouse.\n\nBudyne nad Ohri\n\nHolesov German: Holleschau A town in the Zlin Region, the westernmost part of the Carpathian Mountains, Czech Republic Holesov was originally a village, and was first mentioned in 1030 under the name Gulesi an der Ruza. The village was destroyed in 1241 by the Mongols but rebuilt; in 1271 it was renamed Holesov and given the status of town. Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; between the two World Wars, and between the end of World War II and 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. The Old Synagogue, more commonly known as the Sach Synagogue, is the only Polish-style synagogues to have been preserved; indeed, the synagogue is remarkably beautiful. The women's section now houses a museum exhibit titled \"Moravia and the Jews.\" Additionally, of the 103 houses that once stood at the Jewish Quarter 45 have been preserved, including what was once the school, a beit midrash, and a hospital. The Jewish cemetery, containing over 1,500 graves, can still be visited. Of particular note is the tomb of Rabbi Shabbetai ben Meir HaCohen, better known as the Sach, whose grave is visited by Jews from all over the world. A house of mourning in the cemetery also contains a memorial which lists the names of the 253 Jews from Holesov who were killed during the Holocaust. The town hosts an annual festival called Jewish Culture Week during the month of August. HISTORY There are records of Jews living in Holesov dating from 1391, but a sustained community was apparently only established after 1454, when the Jews of the free royal town of Olomouc were expelled and came to Holesov. At that time the region was ruled by the Hussites (members of the revolutionary Czech national and social movement, named after its founder Jan Hus), and the Jews were accepted and allowed to live there. The community would also later receive Jews who were expelled from Uherske Hradiste in 1514. In 1540 most of the town's houses were destroyed by a fire, which also destroyed documents recording Jewish life in the community. In 1622 the town was occupied by the Hungarian army, followed in 1643 by the Swedish army. At that point the Jews were living in the town under the protection of local nobles. They paid special protection taxes, but they were exempt from other local taxes and the Christian locals were not allowed to harass them. However, ownership of the town often changed hands, and each time the Jews were required to renew their residence rights. A letter of rights that was granted to the Jews of Holesov in 1651 allowed them to build 5 homes inside the town and an additional 41 homes near it, a small beit midrash, a community house, a hospital, and a mikvah. They were also allowed to establish a cemetery, to live openly as Jews, and to choose their own leaders. The old synagogue, also known as the Sach Synagogue, was built in 1560 in Renaissance style. Jewish immigrants from Poland had a large role in renovating the synagogue in 1737, giving it a unique style. A convention of representatives of the Jews of Moravia was held in Holesov in 1653, where the 311 regulations that established the Jews of Moravia as an autonomous body were expanded. During the 17th and 18th centuries most of the Jews of Holesov worked as merchants, dealing in cloth, skins, wool, and cotton. Others were merchants who dealt in poultry and geese. The Jewish craftsmen worked mostly as tailors and tanners. Some of the Jewish merchants of Holesov participated in the larger fairs of Breslau and Leipzig. During the second half of the 17th century, however, the community experienced a number of economic hardships. During the war with Prussia, in 1742, Queen Maria Theresa imposed heavy taxes on the Jews in anticipation of eventually expelling them from Moravia, which resulted in the community of Holesov, which at that time had a population of 1,500, going into debt. As a result, the synagogue building and the silver ornaments within it were seized, and the community's leaders were jailed. Shortly thereafter, in 1745, a fire broke out and about a third of the Jewish Quarter was destroyed. Years later the community was still struggling to repay its debts. Additionally, residence restrictions were put into place, limiting the number of Jews who could live in Holesov. As a result, in 1720 a number of Jews from Holesov founded the community of Liptovsky Milulas; nonetheless, this community was still under the auspices of the community in Holesov and High Holiday services for both communities were held in Holesov. In 1748 the Jewish population of Holesov was 1,032 (194 families), who occupied 49 of the town's houses. In 1831 the population rose to 1,316. By 1869 Holesov's Jewish population was 1,764 (about 25% of the total population). After the emancipation of Austro-Hungarian Jews in 1848, and the subsequent lifting of economic and residence restrictions, Jews began to expand their economic activities. A furniture factory and a distillery were established in Holesov, both by Jews. Additionally, the community was granted the status of a political community with municipal autonomy. The Jewish Quarter functioned independently, with its own mayor-like figure, a police force, firefighters, and night watchmen. In 1883 the religious community was separated from the political community, and in 1919 the Jewish part of town was united with the Christian town. A new synagogue was built in Holesov in 1893, which also contained a beit midrash. The first rabbi to serve the community was Rabbi Menahem Mendel, who worked in Holsesov during the first half of the 17th century. The famous Rabbi Shabbetai, ben Meir HaCohen, served between 1662 and 1668. Other notable figures from Holesov include the historian Gershon Wolf and Rabbi Johanan ben Isaac, who served as the Ashkenazi rabbi of London at the beginning of the 18th century. Jewish life in Holesov was not always easy. In 1682 the local bishop prohibited the town's Jews from being present in the town square during Christian processions. However, in 1774 a group of Catholic clergy protected a Jewish family from a mob that had formed after a Christian woman was killed in the family's home. In 1899, following a dispute between Czechs and Germans, a pogrom broke out in the Jewish Quarter that lasted three days; the Czechs accused the Jews of spreading German culture. In the end, the military was required to intervene in order to quell the riots, and the remained guarding the Jews and their property for six months. In spite of this protection, however, many Jews left the town and in 1914 the Jewish population in Holesov dropped to 1,200. On December 4, 1918, about 200 armed men attacked the local Jews, killing two Jewish soldiers who had recently returned from the war, and looted Jewish homes and shops. This pogrom also caused many Jews to leave; by 1930 there were only 273 Jews remaining in Holesov, 4% of the town's total population. The Jews who remained in the town after the establishment of the Republic of Czechoslovakia became active in Jewish politics, as well as in the political life of the town. In 1919 three delegates from the Jewish party were elected to the town's council. Zionism became influential, and in 1926 the community purchased membership and voting rights to the Zionist Congress. THE HOLOCAUST The Munich Agreement of September 1938 dissolved the Republic of Czechoslovakia and gave the Sudeten Region to Germany. By March, 1939 the region of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews living there. By the end of 1942 most of the Jews in the protectorate had been concentrated in Terezin (Theresienstadt), before being deported to concentration and death camps, where most were killed. Approximately 200 Jewish families from Holesov and the surrounding area were deported. Before their deportation 282 ritual objects, 274 books, and 5,011 documents from the community were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. The New Synagogue was destroyed. POSTWAR Survivors from the community returned to the town after the war, and the community became affiliated with the community of Kyjob. In 1948 there were 37 Jews living in Holesov, 23 of whom were registered officially as part of the community. In 1960 the Jewish Quarter was repaired, and a museum documenting the life of the Jews of Moravia was established on the second floor of the old synagogue. The community repaired and cleaned the cemetery, which included the grave of Rabbi Shabbetai ben Meir HaCohen, and added a memorial plaque to the victims of the Holocaust. It was also during the 1960s that the community ceased to be autonomous, and was merged with the Jewish community of Brno.\n\nHolesov\n\nHorazdovice German: Horazdowitz A town in the Plzen Region, Czech Republic Horazdovice was founded at the end of the 13th century. Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and between the end of World War II and 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Ten Torah scrolls were transferred from Horazdovice to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague during World War II. One is displayed in the foyer of Temple Emanuel of Greater New Haven, Connecticut. Another Torah from Horazdovice has been on permanent loan to Westminster Synagogue in London since 1968. The other Torah scrolls from Horazdovice can be found in Congregation Ezrath Israel in Ellenville, New York, Park Avenue Synagogue in Manhattan, Temple Sinai of Dresher in Dresher, Pennsylvania, Temple Kol Emeth in Palo Alto, California, Temple Beth Ora in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, B'nai Israel Congregation in Wilmington, South Carolina, the Young Israel of Hollywood in Hollywood, Florida, and the Ministry of Religious Affairs in Jerusalem, Israel. The synagogue in Slatina (one of the communities affiliated with Horazdovice) was renovated in 1983 and has been registered as a national monument since 1988. Over 100 tombstones in the cemetery of Slatina have been preserved; the oldest legible tombstone dates to the 18th century. HISTORY It is likely that Jews lived in Horazdovice since the town's founding, but records of their presence in the town date from the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). In 1619 the Jews were granted land for a cemetery in the eastern part of the town. At that time only 10 Jewish families were permitted to live in the town. A synagogue was built on the Jewish Street, which was located near the cemetery. The community employed a cantor, who also served as a teacher. By 1670 there was a Talmud Torah, located in one of the Jewish houses. Later, when the noble families of Mansfeld and Lewinstein were in charge of the town, some of the laws that discriminated against the Jews were abolished; as a result, in 1779 there were 18 Jewish families living in Horazdovice. The Thirty Years' War and its aftermath resulted in difficult economic times for the Jews of Horazdice. Heavy taxes were imposed on them, and there were economic restrictions preventing them from taking full advantage of local opportunities. Nonetheless, Jewish merchants were able to trade in grain, and from 1595 they also traded in cattle. Much later, after the emancipation of Austro-Hungarian Jews in 1848, the Jews of the region founded a distillery as well as factories for producing matches, paper, wool, and starch. In fact, the starch factory was so successful that it prompted potato farmers across Bohemia to form an agricultural cooperative, which bought the factory in 1912. The factory still exists, under the name Lyckeby Amylex. Herman Katz founded one of the largest and most successful grocery stores in southern Bohemia 1859; in 1907 his son, Otto, also founded a similarly successful grocery store. Another successful business was ironworks; Herman Katz's brother, Eduard, founded an ironworks shop, and Eduard Steiner also purchased a shop in 1907. In 1919 he purchased Vienna's Riesenrad Ferris wheel. In 1850 a Jewish school was opened, in which the language of instruction was German—only one hour per day was devoted to studying the Czech language. In 1885, however, after an initiative led by the president of the community and owner of the Muenz Brothers distillery, Eduard Muenz, Czech was adopted as the language of instruction in the school, as well as the language of business for all of the community's institutions. The community also resolved that the rabbi's sermons would be delivered in Czech. Among the community's institutions at that time was a society for the promotion of the Czech language and culture. During the second half of the 19th century a new cemetery was consecrated and graves from the old cemetery were transferred to the new one. A chevra kaddisha also served the community. The synagogue also renovated in 1901, and electric lighting was installed. Among the rabbis of the community were Rabbi B. Friedman, who was also an inventor who held various patents (including one about the automatic joining of railway trucks), and Rabbi Martin Friedman, who served from 1887 until 1931. In 1848, Jews throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire were emancipated and the residence restrictions that they had been subject to were lifted. Jews began moving to larger towns and cities in search of greater economic and educational opportunities. This trend, coupled with the railroad that was built connecting Horazdovice to the railway system during this same period, resulted in a population decline as members of the Jewish community of Horazdovice began to move elsewhere. By 1893 Jews from 12 communities in nearby villages were absorbed into the shrinking community of Horazdovice (see below for information on two of these communities). After the establishment of the Republic of Czechoslovakia in 1918, and the recognition of Jews as a national minority, Zionism became popular in Horazdovice. In 1926 the Jews of Horazdovice purchased membership and voting rights before the elections to the 15th Zionist Congress. In 1921 there were 187 Jews living in the community. By 1930 that number had dropped to 126. COMMUNITIES AFFILIATED WITH HORAZDOVICE Slatina was the largest and most important community that was absorbed into Horazdovice. Jews most probably began living there at the end of the 16th century and at the beginning of the 17th century it became the central community for the Jews in the area. The Jewish Quarter consisted of approximately 10 houses and was located in the northern part of the village. A new synagogue built in 1850 replaced the former wooden synagogue; this new synagogue was renovated in 1893. A wing of the synagogue included a Talmud Torah, a kosher butcher, and a matzah factory. The rabbi lived in an apartment on the upper floor. This synagogue was in use until 1912; during World War I Jewish refugees from Poland were housed in the synagogue, and after 1919 the building was used to store grain. A cemetery was consecrated in 1723, though Jews had been buried at the site for years. The last burial took place in 1937. In 1724 there were 6 Jewish families (27 people) living n Slatina). Between 1858 and 1868 there were 33 families living in the village, and in 1913 only four Jewish families were living in the village. The last Jew living in Slatina was killed during World War I. Rabi was another community in the area that was incorporated into Horazdice. The community included a school and a prayer house. The rabbi of the Prachen Region also lived in Rabi. THE HOLOCAUST Following the Munich Agreement of September, 1938, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. About half a year later, the Germans occupied the regions of Bohemia and Moravia, which became protectorates of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the areas' Jews. Beginning at the end of 1941 the Jews were concentrated in the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were deported to a series of concentration and death camps, where most were killed. Before their expulsion to Terezin, 286 documents and 130 ritual objects from the community of Horazdovice were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum of Prague. Of the nearly 100 Jews who were taken from Horazdovice, only 7 survived. None returned to the town after the war. POSTWAR The synagogue building in Horazdovice was demolished in 1980, while that of Slatina was renovated in 1983. The section of Slatina's synagogue that once housed the Talmud Torah, kosher butcher, and matzah factory was converted into a private home as well as a memorial hall and exhibition about the history of the local Jews.\n\nHORAZDOVICE\n\nHradec Kralove German: Koenigraetz A city in the Hradec Kralove Region of Bohemia Hradec Kralove was established by King Premysl Otakar II in 1225 at the convergence of the Labe and Orlica Rivers. It became a crossroads for the trade routes between Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia to the capital in Prague. Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and between the end of World War II and 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. The Jewish cemetery, which includes a pre-burial house, is owned by the Jewish community of Prague. Most of the tombstones have been damaged, and some have been moved from the cemetery to a museum. The cemetery has also been vandalized a number of times throughout the years. HISTORY There are records of Jews living in the region from 1052; Jews lived in Hradec Kralove itself from the city's founding. There was a Jewish Quarter in the city that local residents called \"Platea Judeorum,\" \"The Jewish Hill,\" which was separated from the central square of the town by an iron gate that was locked every evening. At the beginning of the 15th century there were never more than 10 Jewish families living in the city and they were expelled several times between the years 1454 and 1521. Beginning in 1551 they were compelled to wear special clothes that would identify them as Jews. In 1628 the king allowed only a small number of privileged families, including that of David Tachovsky and the rabbi appointed by the authorities, the right to live in Hradec Kralove. These families were subsequently expelled in 1652. A deist sect that refused to classify themselves as Jews or Christians, and instead referred to themselves as Abrahamites, became active in the area in 1742. They were led by a man named Mendel from the community of Novy Bydzov. This sect was persecuted (they would eventually be excluded from Emperor Joseph II's edict of toleration in 1781) and in 1750 many of them, including Mendel, were tortured and executed at Hradec Kralove. In 1742 one Jewish person was given permission to trade in the annual fair, while another worked as a distiller. Several more Jewish merchants were given permission to trade in the city in 1774. In 1808 Joseph Winternitz founded a distillery in Hradec Kralove to produce alcoholic liquors. He was well known, both among Jews and non-Jews, as a generous philanthropist. Philip Levy was a tobacco dealer in the area during the same period. Many Jewish merchants arrived at Hradec Kralove at the beginning of the 19th century and a community was organized in 1860; a community register started to be kept in 1864. At that time most Jews lived in the area around the city; even by 1873 only 8 Jews lived in Hradec Kralove itself. In 1877 the community bought land for a cemetery. In 1890 the officers of the community were elected, and shortly thereafter, in 1896, the community's regulations were approved by the authorities. The community's institutions included a chevra kaddisha, a women's organization, and a society that assisted both Jewish students and the poor. A large synagogue was built in 1905. In 1921 there were 314 Jews living in Hradec Kralove. The president of the community at that time was Dr. Joseph Taussik, and the secretary was Oscar Eisner. During the interwar period Jews were recognized as a national minority, and a significant number of Jews in Hradec Kralove became involved with Jewish nationalism. In 1926 the Jews of Hradec Kralove purchased membership and voting rights to the Zionist conference, and a number voted in the 1937 elections to the 20th Zionist Congress. A branch of the Maccabi youth movement was active in the city. By 1930 about 10% of the Jews of Hradec Kralove and the surrounding area declared their nationality as Jewish. In 1931 when the Jewish Party of Czechoslovakia was founded, Dr. Milan Kolman from Hradec Kralove was elected to the party's central committee; Dr. Kolman, along with Hermann Stapler, was a delegate to the last regional conference of the Zionist Federation. In 1930 there were 425 Jews living in Hradec Kralove (2.39% of the total population). THE HOLOCAUST After the Munich Agreement of September 1938 the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. The Sudeten Region was annexed to Nazi Germany, and many Jews who escaped from Sudetenland found refuge in Hradec Kralove. This was during a period of rising anti-Semitism; attempts by refugees to open shops in the town led to anti-Jewish responses. Anti-Semitic graffiti was left on the walls of the synagogue and anti-Semitic leaflets were circulated throughout the city. In March 1939 the Germans entered the region of Bohemia and Moravia, which became protectorates of Nazi Germany. This ushered in a period of official discrimination and violence against the area's Jews; Jews were harassed by Czech anti-Semites, particularly the youth. By 1941 approximately 80 members of the community, of the 1,554 Jews living in the city, converted to Christianity, in an attempt to save themselves. Between May 28 and June 2, 1942, the Jews of Hradec Kralove were ordered to register for transfer. On December 17 and December 21, 1942, 1,198 Jews from the city were sent to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto; the first of these transports also included Jews from smaller communities in the area, including Dvur Kralove, Zamberg, Horice, Nachod, Jaromer, and Josefov. From Terezin they were transferred to concentration and death camps, where most were killed. The only Jews remaining in Hradec Kralove were those who were either married to Christians, or who were half-Jewish. Before the Jews of Hradec Kralove were sent to Terezin, 1,265 documents, 20 books, and 125 ritual objects from the community were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. POSTWAR Only 106 Jews from the region survived the war, 16 of whom were from Hradec Kralove. Some Jews came to Hradec Kralove after the war; on April 30, 1945 there were 190 Jews recorded as living in the city. A monument in memory of the victims of the Holocaust was erected, inscribed with the names of 1,376 of the city's dead. By the 1950s most Jews had left Hradec Kralove. The synagogue building was converted into a municipal library. During Israel's War of Independence in 1948 the first aircraft used by the Israeli Air Force were flown from the airfield near Hradec Kralove. In 1995 the municipality of Hradec Kralove granted the Israeli businessman Abraham Har-Shalom honorary citizenship of the city.\n\nHradec Kralove\n\nHranice In Jewish sources: Hrainitz, Rainitz German: Weisskirchen, Maerisch Weisskirchen A town in Moravia, Czech Republic Hranice is sometimes informally referred to as \"Hranice na Morave,\" in order to distinguish it from other places with the same name. Until 1918 Hranice and the region were part of the Austrian monarchy. Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. The Jewish cemetery is still standing, though not all of the gravestones have remained in their original locations; the cemetery has been vandalized in the past, and some tombstones were removed and sent to a museum. HISTORY The first Jews at Hranice were those who arrived for market days and subsequently decided to settle under the protection of the nobles of the House of Pernstein (1475-1553). They were followed by Jewish cattle merchants from Romania and Poland. The town's records first mention Jews in 1644. During the middle of the 17th century, following the Chmielnicki Pogroms, many Jewish refugees arrived at Hranice from Poland. In 1753 there were 115 Jewish families living in the town. The population rose and by 1788 there were 120 Jewish families in Hranice. In addition to families, there were also a number of single Jews living in Hranice who could not legally marry because of the Families Law, which permitted only the firstborn sons in Jewish families to marry. The Jewish community functioned independently from the rest of the town. There was a Jewish street, consisting of a row of houses along the wall on the west side of the town, a few houses on Teplice Street, as well as houses on one other street. The old synagogue stood at the corner of the Jewish Street, opposite the town square. In 1864 the old synagogue was demolished and replaced by a new synagogue. The cemetery was consecrated following the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) and also served the neighboring communities, particularly that of Neu Titschein (Slovak: Novy Jicin); Julius Freud, the brother of Sigmund Freud, would later be buried in the cemetery. A chevra kaddisha would be formed much later, in 1875, and a women's society was established in 1896. A Jewish school was opened around 1770. It was managed alternately by Jewish and non-Jewish teachers, and the language of instruction was German. In 1865, by which time the school was an elementary Hebrew-German school, two classes were added. In 1876 a crafts class was added for girls, and beginning in 1888 they were taught Czech twice a week. The school closed in 1919, at which point the Jewish students attended the regular schools in the town. Beginning around 1770, Hranice had its own rabbis serving the community. The community's first rabbi was Menachem Mendel of Leipnik. Rabbi Dr. Jacob Rabinowitz, a professor of Oriental studies, philosophy, and history, was appointed in 1894 and served well into the 1930s. He published articles, novels, and plays that were printed in the German and Austrian press. Until the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire in 1848, the community was led by what was known as \"judges\" and \"jurors.\" Only one, Ezechias Kafka, who led the community at the beginning of the 19th century, is known by name. After 1848 the Jewish Quarter was administered by Jewish mayors, who were also the leaders of the communities. These Jewish mayors included Sigmund Wolf, Abraham Wolf, Dr. Wilhelm Wolf, Noe Stross, Shimon Stross, Salomon Schlesinger, Adolf B. Adler, and Adolf Schlesinger. The community reached its population peak in 1857, when it had 802 members. During the second half of the 19th century, however, after the emancipation and the subsequent lifting of residence restrictions, Jews throughout the region began moving to larger towns and cities seeking newer and more varied educational and economic opportunities. The community of Hranice, like others in the region, began to decline in numbers. In 1885 the Jewish political organization was separated from the religious community. In 1919 the political community was abolished, and the Jewish town was integrated into the Christian town. Karl Baron and Sigmund Polack were the Jewish community's representatives to the town's council. Among the notable figures born in Hranice are the journalist, poet, and playwright Jacob Julius David (1859-1906), the composer Max Wolf, Dr. Isidor Winger, who published the Jewish Encyclopedia in New York, and Aaron Chorin, the major advocate of Reform Judaism in Hungary. Following the emancipation, the Jews became more integrated economically, professionally, and socially. Rather than working strictly as merchants and craftsmen, Jews were also becoming professionals such as physicians and academics. Jews also began to be involved in Zionism, particularly after being recognized as a national minority in 1918 and being granted cultural and national autonomy. The Zionist organization Emunah established a branch at Hranice in 1819. There were also a number of Zionist youth organizations that were active. Before the 15th Zionist Congress in 1927, members of the community purchased membership and voting rights; 43 Jews from Hranice subsequently took part in the elections to the 20th Zionist Congress in 1937. In 1930, there were 192 Jews living in Hranice. THE HOLOCAUST Following the Munich Agreement of September 1938, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. On March 15, 1939 German forces entered the regions of Bohemia and Moravia, which subsequently became protectorates of Nazi Germany. This ushered in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews of the region. Beginning in 1941, the Jews were deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto, after which they were sent to concentration and death camps, where most were killed. Before their deportation to Terezin, 85 documents and books, and 125 ritual objects were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. POSTWAR Fourteen Jews returned to Hranice after the war. Though a community was revived, it did not remain active. A prayer house functioned until 1969. In 1996 the synagogue was reconstructed and converted into a museum and art gallery.\n\nHranice\n\nHumpolec German: Gumpolds, Humpolitz A town in the Vysocina Region, Czech Republic Humpolec is located approximately halfway between Prague and Brno in the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands. Until 1918 Humpolec and the region were part of the Austrian monarchy. Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. A Torah scroll from Humpolec that was sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague during World War II has been on permanent loan to the synagogue Am Yisrael of the North Shore in Glencoe, Illinois since 1970. The Jewish cemetery was badly damaged by the Nazis during World War II. Nonetheless, many of the tombstones are still standing. During the 1990s the cemetery and ceremonial hall were restored, and a memorial plaque was erected in honor of the victims of the Holocaust. Among those buried in the cemetery are Simon and Mary Mahler, the grandparents of composer Gustav Mahler (Mahler himself was born in the neighboring village of Kaliste). HISTORY Ruins of a 13th-century synagogue have been found in Humpolec, though it is unclear precisely when Jews first began arriving in the town. A few Jewish families were recorded as living in Humpolec in 1385 but there is no mention of Jews in the following centuries and the 1618 census does not list any Jews as living in the town. In 1719, however, 10 Jewish families (49 people) were living in Humpolec under the protection of the noble family Heralec. At this point the community began to organize: it purchased land for a cemetery, and religious services were held in private homes. A synagogue was built in 1762. By 1787 there were 24 Jewish families living in Humpolec. Levy Bauer was elected president of the community in 1801. At that point the community began establishing a number of organizations, including a fund to provide dowries for poor prides, a fund to help the town's poor, a hospital, and public baths. A Bikkur Holim Society was established during the 1850s, in addition to a charity fund and a fund for assisting poor students. The community's president at the time, Ignatz Hellman, also founded a synagogue choir. Following the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire in 1848, the Jews of Humpolec began pursuing academic careers, whereas previously most had worked as merchants and traders. These newly-minted academics joined the Union of Jewish Academics of Bohemia in Prague. They also began to more fully integrate into the town's political life. By 1861 three members of the community had been elected to the town's council. A Jewish school was established in 1861 in which the language of instruction was Hebrew and German. A special fund, Ner Tamid, was established in order to support the school, though the school was ultimately closed in 1902. By that point, at the turn of the 20th century, the community had a number of other social institutions, including a Talmud Torah, a chevra kaddisha, societies to support women in need, and a singing group called Shirat Zion. A fire in 1825 destroyed 10 Jewish homes. In 1886 another fire broke out in the Jewish Quarter and destroyed the school and 9 homes, and damaged the synagogue. With the help of donations a new school building was built. The synagogue was also renovated, and an organ was installed as part of the renovation. In 1905 the community purchased a building that included an apartment for the cantor. Rabbi Dr. Moritz Wohl was appointed as the community's first rabbi in 1894 and served until 1898. He was followed by Rabbi Marek Tedlinsky, who served until 1942 when the community was destroyed and Rabbi Tedlinsky perished along with his congregants. Between 1719 and 1902 the community had 17 presidents, many of whom were from the same families, including the Bauer, Levy, Bondi, and Hellman families. A jurist whose last name was Lederer was appointed as president of the community in 1902. He reorganized the community's institutions, and among his activities he began offering private Hebrew lessons for members of the community and the surrounding areas, and established organized help for needy Jewish travelers. At the beginning of the 20th century the Jewish community of Humpolec, as well as the surrounding areas (Veri, Heralci, Vojslavice, Cejove) consisted of 63 families (320 people). In 1922 there were 270 Jews registered as living in Humpolec. That year, Dr. Otto Posamentir was elected as the community's president. He served until 1926. A blood libel was levied against the Jews in 1903, leading to outbreaks of anti-Semitism. Ultimately, however, the Christian woman who was responsible for spreading the blood libel was charged and imprisoned. During World War I Jews of Humpolec enlisted in the Austro-Hungarian army. Throughout the war Jewish refugees from Poland and Bukovina arrived in the town, which proved challenging for the community who struggled to absorb them. In addition, the influx of refugees led to a rise in anti-Semitism among the Christian citizens of the town. When the war ended in 1918, a festive public prayer was held at the synagogue in honor of the newly established Republic of Czechoslovakia. This new republic recognized the Jews as a national minority, and granted them cultural-national autonomy. In 1930 there were 89 Jews living in Humpolec. THE HOLOCAUST The Munich Agreement of September 1938 led to the dissolution of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, and annexed the Sudeten Region to Nazi Germany. As a result, most of the Jews of the region moved to Bohemia and Moravia. In March 1939 the region of Bohemia and Moravia were annexed to Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews of the region. That year, one Jewish woman from Humpolec emigrated to Mandate Palestine. Beginning in 1941 the Germans began deporting Czech Jews to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, where most were killed. Before their deportation to Terezin, 32 documents and 142 ritual objects from the community were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. POSTWAR Some of the Jews from Humpolec survived the war, but none returned to the town.\n\nHumpolec\n\nIvancice Jewish sources: Eybshitz German: Eibenschutz A town in the South Moravian Region, Czech Republic Ivancice is located 13 miles (21km) southwest of Brno. Until 1918 Ivancice was part of the Austrian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. The new synagogue, which was built in 1853 to replace the town's first synagogue, was used as a storage space for 50 years. Since 2008 it has undergone a reconstruction process in order to restore it for the town's cultural needs. The Jewish cemetery has nearly 1,800 tombstones, the oldest of which dates to 1580. It also includes a ceremonial hall, which was built in 1902. The cemetery can be visited after making an appointment. Of the 73 homes that once stood in the Jewish Quarter, 52 remain. A wall-mounted plaque on 1 Krumlovska Street memorializes where the transit and internment camp for Jews was located between 1938 and 1942. HISTORY The Jewish community of Ivancice is one of the oldest in Moravia. According to a local tradition, Jews arrived with Roman troops during the first century and were later expelled. By 956 there was already a synagogue in the town and the names of 157 Jews and 783 Christians appear in tax registers from the time. During the rule of the House of Premysl (895-1306) the Jews had equal rights when it came to taxes and owning property. They were also responsible for participating in building the town’s walls and defending them, along with their Christian neighbors. They were not, however, permitted to carry arms and they did not work as officials for the local government. In 1454 the community of Ivancice absorbed Jewish refugees from Austria and a number of royal towns of Moravia, thereby becoming among the largest and the most important of the Jewish communities in Moravia at that time. However, at the beginning of the 16th century, during the reign of Emperor Ferdinand of Hapsburg, the Jews became subjects to a number of economic restrictions and were also forced to wear a yellow badge that would identify them as Jewish. The Jewish Ghetto of Ivancice was first established during the 14th century outside the town. It was subsequently moved inside the town walls to be administered as an autonomous municipal entity, with a Jewish mayor. The Jews of Ivancice and of a number of nearby settlements lived under the protection of the nobles of the House of Pernstein. During the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), following the persecution of the Christian reform sects by the Catholic Church, the number of Christians in Ivancice shrank. Simultaneously, the Jewish community began to grow, helped by the arrival of many refugees from Bohemia. This influx of Jewish refugees resulted in a 1650 edict forbidding any Jew to live in Moravia who arrived after 1618. The community of Ivancice became officially organized around the 17th century. It had its own rabbi, dayanim (religious judges), a gabbai, and a chevra kaddisha. The Jewish cemetery, in which the oldest tombstone dated to 1552, was expanded during the 17th, and again in the 19th, century. Ivancice's first recorded rabbi, Rabbi Abraham the son of Hirsch Foreis, served during the second half of the 17th century. He was succeeded by Rabbi David of Rakov, who in turn was succeeded by his son Rabbi Joseph Rakov. Rabbi Rakov was followed by Rabbi Elia ben Shmuel, Rabbi Nathan Zelig of Cracow, Rabbi Issachar ber Oppenheim (1829-1859), his son Rabbi Joachim Oppenheim, Rabbi Dr. Jacob Tauber, and Rabbi Dr. Hermann Handel (1881- 1925). Rabbi Handel was the community's last rabbi; afterwards, the community would refer to Rabbi Dr. Heinrich Flesch, the rabbi of Kanits. Ivancice also had a yeshiva that trained rabbis. The town's original synagogue was built sometime during the 16th century; in 1853 a new synagogue was consecrated in its place. This new synagogue had a girls' choir that accompanied the cantor. While the Jewish community offered its children a Jewish education since the 16th century (there are records of a Jewish melamed, teacher of small children, dating to 1598), a Jewish school was opened 1823, in which the language of instruction was German. A new school was opened in 1833 and enrolled 121 pupils, some of whom were not Jewish. By 1856 this second school had 4 classes, however, in 1902 it was closed due to lack of enrollment and the building was used by the community to house the community’s offices and the mikveh. A funeral house was built in the building's courtyard; the man in charge of Jewish burials served also as a policeman and jailer in the Jewish Quarter. In 1752 the Jews of Ivancice lived in 67 houses. By 1791 the community had grown to 533 people (about 45% of the town's total population) living in 72 houses. In 1830 their number rose to 797, and in 1835 the Jewish population was 877. In 1848 Jews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated, and residence restrictions were lifted. As a result, Jews throughout the region began moving to larger towns and cities in search of greater economic and educational opportunities. As a result, Jewish populations in places like Ivancice began to decline. By 1857 the population had dropped to 629 though twenty years later, in 1877, they still made up 25% of the total population. In 1900 the town's Jewish population was 564. During World War I the town's Jewish population saw an increase, a result of the many Jewish refugees arriving in Ivancice from Bukovina, but these refugees were asked to leave once the war was over. In 1918 the heretofore autonomous Jewish town was united with the Christian town, after which the community's authority was restricted to religious and social welfare issues. In 1921 the president of the community was Alexander Stern. Among the community's institutions were a Bikkur Holim society, a women’s society, and a charity organization. It was only beginning in the second half of the 19th century, following the emancipation, that the Jews began to be able to take advantage of a wide range of economic opportunities. The first Jews in Ivancice made their living in crafts, trade and in leasing inns. Jews were not allowed to own real estate during the 17th century, limiting their economic activities, and during the 18th century Jewish merchants were allowed to conduct their business only in the town’s market. After the emancipation, however, things changed. The Jews of Ivancice founded businesses and went into academic professions. The graduates of the German universities of Vienna, Prague, and Brno, who did not find suitable positions in their town left for other towns. The Jews of Ivancice declared their nationality as German until the turn of the 20th century. At that point Ivancice became one of the centers of Czech nationalism, which led to tensions between the Christian residents of the town, who began identifying strongly as Czech, and their Jewish neighbors who were seen as other. The town's residents demonstrated in the Jewish Quarter, and withdrew their children from the Jewish school. Ultimately, once the Republic of Czechoslovakia was formed at the end of World War I, the new republic recognized the Jews as a national minority. Nonetheless, the nationalist friction between the Jews of Ivancice and the Czech townspeople continued until 1925. Once Jews were recognized as a national minority within the Republic of Czechoslovakia, many became involved with Jewish nationalism and the Zionist movement. In 1921, 157 out of the 190 Jews of Ivancice declared their nationality as Jewish; the rest declared their nationality as Czech or German. During this period Zionism became popular; in 1926, members of the community purchased membership and voting rights prior to the 15th Zionist Congress, and continued to do so over the years. Jews were also active in the town's politics, and during the interwar period delegates from the Jewish community served on the town council. Relationships between the Jews and Czechs improved during the interwar period, so much so that Jewish assimilation rose and some younger members of the community married non-Jews. Among the notable Jews from Ivancice are the actor, director, and playwright Leopold Adler, the musicologist Guido Adler, and the composer Hugo Weisgall. THE HOLOCAUST The Munich Agreement of September 1938 resulted in the dissolution of the Republic of Czechoslovakia and annexed the Sudeten Region to German. As a result, large numbers of Czech and Jewish refugees from the region came to nearby Ivancice, though many of them were expelled and forced to return to the annexed territory. Jews who refused to return were left stranded on the new border, without any shelter or protection. After the intervention of Jan Masaryk, the exiled president of Czechoslovakia who had fled to London, a transit camp was set up for the refugees at the leather factory of Moritz Goldmann, the president of the community of Ivancice. This transit camp functioned until 1942, and 801 refugees passed through it. In March 1939 the Czech part of the republic (Bohemia and Moravia) became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews of the region. Under German rule, the community of Ivancice served as a regional community. The Jews were evicted from their houses and concentrated in the Jewish Quarter. Their property was nationalized, their rights were dispossessed, and they were sent to work in factories and in mines. By November 1939 young Jewish men from the transit camp were deported to the concentration camp of Nisko in Poland. Some escaped and joined the Czech units that fought the Germans with the Soviet Red Army. Led by the Czech student Hynek Ruzicka, an anti-Nazi underground movement emerged at Ivancice which young Jews from the transit camp joined. In 1942 the Jews of Ivancice and the nearby transit camp were sent to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto in 4 transports, the first of which took place on March 11, 1942. Some of the deportees were sent to the concentration camp Maidanek, while others and others were sent to Auschwitz. The last Jews, those who were in mixed marriages, were deported in 1944. Before the deportation, 517 documents and ritual objects from the Jewish community of Ivancice were sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. POSTWAR Eighteen Jews from Ivancice survived the war. In May 1945, at the end of the war, the first of the community's survivors returned to Ivancice. They were mostly those from mixed marriages who were deported later, as well as the young men who had escaped from Nisko and fought in the Czech units. Most of them left Ivancice shortly thereafter, and only a few remained in the town. The synagogue building was demolished in 1950.\n\nIvancice\n\nKolin Older sources refer to the town as Neukollin A town in the Central Bohemian Region, Czech Republic Kolin is located approximately 34 miles (55km) east of Prague, on the Elbe River. Until 1918 Kolin and the region were part of the Austrian Empire. During the interwar period, and during the postwar communist era (until 1993), it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Approximately half of the buildings from the original Jewish Quarter have been preserved. This includes the synagogue that was originally built during the 17th century, making it the second oldest synagogue in the Czech Republic. The synagogue has been restored, and has become a cultural center that has preserved the synagogue's interior. The synagogue has been named a protected monument. Kolin's two Jewish cemeteries have been preserved. The older cemetery includes the tombstone of Betsal'el ben Yehudah (d. 1599, the son of the Maharal of Prague). This cemetery contains tombstones that date to the first half of the 15th century. A newer cemetery, which was consecrated in 1887, includes a Holocaust memorial. Both cemeteries can be accessed with permission. One of the Torah scrolls from Kolin that was sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague during World War II is on permanent loan to the Northwood and Pinner Liberal Synagogue of London. HISTORY The Jewish community of Kolin was one of the four communities included in the Hebrew abbreviation \"Karban\" (Kolin, Roudnice, Bumsla, Nachod), demonstrating its importance (as well as those of the other communities mentioned) as second only to Prague. Town records from 1376-1401 mention 16 Jewish households. By the end of the 15th century there was already an established cemetery. Records from 1512 also include references to an \"old\" synagogue, indicating that it has been built long before. The Jews were expelled from the town in 1541, but returned in 1557. This proved to be a temporary respite; they were expelled once again in 1561, and returned yet again in 1564. By 1574 the community was made up of 33 families. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries the Jewish community of Kolin continued to grow; from 138 families in 1718, the community grew to 251 families (1,169 people) in 1793. A synagogue with an ark donated by Samuel Oppenheimer was dedicated in 1696. In a fire in 1796, 43 Jewish houses, housing 205 families, were burned down. During the revolutionary year of 1848, there were 30 Jews from Kolin who joined a national guard unit, sent to aid the revolution in Prague; however, they were forced out of the unit shortly thereafter. That year, Jews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated, and the economic and residence restrictions that had heretofore constrained them were lifted. Kolin was home to one of the largest and most prominent yeshivas in Bohemia. The yeshiva was modernized during the 19th century and was called the \"Beit Midrash-Anstalt\" (Institution). In his visit to the town in 1855, Moses Montefiore was so impressed by the yeshiva that he endowed a foundation for its students. In addition to the yeshiva, other organizations supported by the Jewish community included a chevra kaddisha, a branch of the Maccabi sports club, as well as a number of Zionist, educational, women's, and charitable organizations. In 1857 there were 1,347 Jews (16.1% of the total population) living in Kolin. In 1881 the town's Jewish population was 1,148 (9.8% of the total population). In 1913 a young Roman Catholic priest, whose last name was Hrachovsky, attempted to levy a blood libel charge against the town's Jews. This was an attempt to cover up his own involvement in the suicide of a young woman whom the priest had impregnated. Between the two World Wars many Jews in Kolin supported the Czecho-Jewish moveme"
