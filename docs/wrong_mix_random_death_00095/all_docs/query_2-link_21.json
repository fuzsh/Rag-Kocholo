        "text": "“but that which was the pleasantest surprise, was a largish clump of what in England we should not look for in a garden, yet what once filled in England the soul of Linnaeus with delight, covered over with its golden bloom—gorse; the seed whence it was raised taken from a common near Nottingham.” (Richard Howitt describes weed gorse growing at Yallambee, from Impressions of Australia Felix, 1845)\n\nWe’ve all heard tales told of “Jimmy Grant”, the English immigrant none too satisfied with Australia, and all things Australians. For the early settlers this meant those strangely silent birds that didn’t sing like the ones of fond memory, the dreary Australian forests where the trees kept their leaves throughout the winter and dropped them in the summer, but most of all, it meant those funny looking animals hopping back and forth across the Australian landscape. Animals that simply wouldn’t sit still long enough to be shot at or chased around by a pack of the squatter’s hunting hounds.\n\nIt was all a bit strange looking and to be frank, just not as good as they remembered things, “back home” in ’ol Blighty. By jove, something needed to be done about it and done fast. No use waiting for that new-fangled theory of Darwinism to catch up with the Antipodes. What was needed they said was a good dose of European flora and fauna, spread thickly across the thinly constructed Australian landscape.\n\nExotic birds were let loose upon the wide Australian skies, foreign fish went into the waterless, inland waterways and rows of softwood timber trees replaced the solid Australian native hardwoods. As the English traveller and writer, William Howitt observed when visiting Yallambee in 1852.\n\n“But, spite of foreign vegetation, the English stamp and English character are on all their settlements. They are English houses, English enclosures, that you see; English farms, English gardens, English cattle and horses, English fowls about the yards, English flowers and plants carefully cultivated.” (William Howitt, Land, Labour and Gold, 1858)\n\nWhile William recorded seeing a wide variety of fine fruits growing during his visit to Yallambee, his record also included of all things, “great fleshy prickly pears, with their oval leaves stuck one on the end of another, and their purple fruit.” (William Howitt, ibid)\n\nGrown initially for its fruit, the pear cactus was also commonly used as an alternative to expensive post and rail fencing, becoming along the way a rather troublesome environmental weed by the 20th Century. It’s part of a pattern that has been repeated again and again throughout our history. The pear was just one in a long line up of weeds that were let loose on an unsuspecting continent, some by chance, others by design. The first Government Botanist of Victoria and Director of the Melbourne Botanical Gardens, Baron Sir Ferdinand von Mueller was a champion of indigenous plant species but is often cited as the main culprit behind the spread of one of the worst weed plants, the English blackberry throughout Victoria. Mueller is thought to have shared plant material around Victoria, including legend would have it with Robert Bakewell at Yallambee, but when it came to the blackberry, it was the seeds he took in his pockets on his trips into the bush to scatter randomly that did the most damage. A Mrs Fraser is quoted as having said of the Baron, “He used always to carry a packet of blackberry seeds with him, and whenever he boiled his billy, he scattered a few around the ashes of his fire. He said that the poor people in time to come would bless him for his thoughtfulness.” (As reported in the Victorian Naturalist, 1959, p33).\n\nTake a walk along the Plenty River at the end of summer in any year and you’re bound to see the result, whatever your current socio-economic position. But look out for the signs when you do, warning where the bushland crews have sprayed poison along the River environment to contain the apparently inevitable spread of the Baron’s handiwork.\n\nIt’s difficult now to get hold on the mindset that drove so many in those early years to want to introduce foreign species into Australia, but harder still in the cases where those species came without any apparent benefit whatsoever.\n\n“Mr Wilson wrote out to us to the effect that he was a thorough acclimatiser and that he went in for the acclimatisation of monkeys for the amusement of the wayfarer whom their gambols would delight as he lay under some gum-tree in the forest on a sultry day…” The Governor of Victoria, Sir Henry Barkly addressing the first meeting of the Acclimatisation Society of Victoria in 1862.\n\nMr Wilson might not have got his way with the introduction into Australia of those so-called amusing monkeys, but there were plenty of other attempts besides. You name it and there was probably some fool attempt at one time or another to introduce it onto what started out as a virgin continent. Acclimatisation experiments in Australia in the 19th Century, with their hang the consequences attitudes, remind me somehow of that old Porky Pig cartoon where Daffy Duck as a hotel manager supplies one animal after another to Porky, who initially only wanted to rid himself of a mouse in his room. You know the Toon. A cat is sent to frighten the mouse, a dog the cat and on to an elephant, which then needs the mouse brought back because since as every good children’s television watcher will tell you, elephants live in terror of the cartoon mouse.\n\nThe hopping animal with the floppy ears and cotton tail is probably the most infamous of these acclimatisation experiments gone wrong. Introduced as sporting entertainment for the squatters, once established there were belated attempts to contain the spread of rabbits including, believe it or not, the release of countless hundreds of feral cats into the bush. Using some sort of warped, Porky Pig thinking, it was hoped that the cats would eat the young rabbits. This they probably did, at least to a degree, but bunnies breed well, like rabbits, and it wasn’t long before cats had given up and gone on to eat plenty else out there in the bush besides. For all the destruction the old bunny caused though, at least it could be said that the rabbit made a good feed when baked and served up with a few peas and carrots. The same could not be said for that other hopping animal, the poisonous, wart encrusted Cane Toad, the later deliberate introduction of which made absolutely no sense at all, then or now. Let loose into the North of Australia in the 1930s by those who should have known better, it was hoped the toad would prey on beetles which by some report were proving to be a kind of nuisance in the sugar cane fields of Queensland. The hilariously named scientist Walter Froggatt was one of the few who tried to stop the release of the ugly amphibians, warning to deaf ears of the environmental consequences. Froggatt had started his career in an earlier century as a protege of Baron von Mueller, so maybe he had seen a thing or two. It soon became apparent that about the only thing the fat blighters wouldn’t eat were mature cane beetles, with the native invertebrates of Australia paying a heavy price ever since.\n\nEuropean settlers to Australia were amazed by the waist high fields of kangaroo grass that greeted them on arrival in this country, but were equally shocked by how easily these were turned to dust by their ungulate herds. The green fields of our modern farmland in fact have always been an invention. Ever since nomads in Asia Minor settled down and started collecting and planting certain types of grasses that grew better than others around about 10 or 12 thousand years ago, human beings have been modifying their environments. The 16th Century would see the start of a rapid international interchange of plant material around the world, with some crops like so called Indian Corn, or Maize, far more productive than the European equivalent of wheat and rye.\n\nThis has always been a story of a fine balancing act, a tightrope walk between what to bring in and what to leave out of a country. It’s a story that has featured both the good, the bad and in the case of the toad, the bad and outright ugly. The trouble has always been that once introduced, whether by mistake or by design, there has never been much chance of going back. What’s here now we must learn to live with. That said, the next time you find yourself resting under a “gum-tree in the forest on a sultry day”, spare a thought of what might have been. Thank your lucky stars that there isn’t a monkey up there in the branches throwing gum nuts at you.\n\nAt least not yet.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHe was known locally as “Old Harry” and in the conservative pre-Whitlam era ’60s, Old Harry Ferne was something of a Yallambie eccentric. The stories that surrounded Harry were legendary and as he assured his listeners, they were all true. Well, mostly. A square peg in a round hole. You might say that they broke the mould when they made Old Harry.\n\nHarry Ferne lived in a one room cottage on the banks of the Plenty River. He was a relative or maybe a sometime friend of the Temby family at Yallambie Homestead. Nobody was really quite sure exactly. He moved into a cottage in the garden on the river flat below the Homestead in 1968 and stayed there for more than a decade, even in the face of increasing pressure from Heidelberg City Council to move him out. In a recorded interview made in the early 1980s Harry remembered that, “When I arrived in the area there was a forest of trees. Now there’s a forest of houses.” (Heidelberger, 2 June, 1982)\n\nLike a hermit at the bottom of the garden in the finest of English folly traditions, Old Harry was a bit of an enigma. He walked with a pronounced stoop that belied his clipped moustache and a somewhat understated military bearing. A “real gentleman” as one local described him but a man who was for all that, prepared to live outside of the mores of society. Local children from the nearby developing housing estate seemed drawn to him and “descended on him in droves, keen to fish for tadpoles in his water storage ponds,” or to simply spend time with this curious character with the mysterious past. In an era when children could spend as much time as they wanted with an older, unmarried man living alone in peculiar and reduced circumstances without anyone batting an eyelid, Old Harry and his stories became a magnet for juvenile gangs, the king of the kids in the Yallambie area.\n\nHarry’s Yallambie Cottage was a single roomed timber dwelling that had been built at the foot of the Yallambie escarpment sometime in the dim dark, far distant past, nobody could quite remember when. Maybe it was a re-erection of a Bakewell pre-fab, but who knows. Harry said, “When I took over the cottage, it was a ruin. No windows, no door, no water and no sewerage. Just possums in the roof, bees in two walls and a wombat under the floorboards.”\n\nHarry set to work and cleaned up the ramshackle building, laying brick paving and redeveloping the remnant gardens surrounding the exterior.\n\nHarry was fascinated by the history of the area and especially the legend that Baron Ferdinand von Mueller had contributed to the Yallambie landscape. He would point out trees to interested listeners as possible contenders for a von Mueller provenance. Even in 1970 these trees were well over 100 years old and on one occasion Harry narrowly escaped with his life when a pair of trees from the Yallambie pinetum collapsed and nearly destroyed his house.\n\nThe Yallambie Cottage was surrounded by a forest of these exotic trees and in the winter months the smoke from Harry’s fires hung low, trapped by their overhanging branches. Harry did a lot of his cooking on a barbecue in a half barrel outside but his cottage also housed a cast iron range where he made toast and where an old kettle was kept continuously on the boil for anybody who cared to stop by long enough to share a yarn and a strong cup of tea.\n\nHarry’s cottage neighboured the nearby old Yallambie pumping house which in the farming era had been used to draw water up from the river for use in the outlying paddocks. Invoking the principle that possession remains nine tenths of the law, Harry claimed the pumping house likewise as his own, although ostensibly it was located on Heidelberg City Council land. This was Harry’s world. It was a place to spend time with friends both young and old. It was a place to watch the passing of the seasons and to stare at the reflections in the waters of the river. And it was a place to think about the past.\n\nHarry’s was a naturally artistic nature and he spent hours in the fields sketching the surrounding river landscape. He was a friend of the Dutch sculptor Rein Slagmolen whose artists’ colony at the nearby former convent, Casa Maria, was an early feature of the pre subdivisional landscape of Yallambie. Harry also had friends in the theatre and the opera who probably wondered at what they had struck when they came to visit him in his rural realm.\n\nHarry kept a car, an early model VW Beetle, but it didn’t get driven about much. Harry didn’t find much need to get behind the wheel or to leave the area. The Temby children and others kept their horses on the Yallambie river flats and it was the horses that Harry preferred to populate his drawings with.\n\nHarry kept an old concrete water trough near the cottage for the horses but when one enterprising young lad used Harry’s water colour paints to paint the trough an ultramarine blue, Harry was less than impressed.\n\nIn the summer months Harry harvested the fruit from the Yallambie orchards and in those days, there were many more trees than the few that remain today into the 21st millennium.\n\nPears, apples, loquats, figs, grapes and walnuts grew on the river flats in abundance but Harry also added to his crop by collecting baskets of blackberries from the vines that grew out of control along the river. Harry was a surprisingly good cook and the produce was baked into apple and blackberry pies and shared around the neighbourhood with friends and acquaintances. Throw in the occasional snared rabbit and Old Harry was virtually living off the land at Yallambie. “We’re 10 miles from the city, yet you would think we were 100 miles away,” he said. Every year on the 5th November a great bonfire would be kindled on the flats marking Guy Fawkes’ treasonous plot and “cracker night” would be celebrated with a great deal of noise and potatoes roasted in the embers of the fire.\n\nThere was no bath or shower in the Yallambie cottage and Harry’s ablutions were limited to a regular swim in the river. Toiletry arrangements involved a septic tank which Harry installed himself alongside the cottage but herein were sown the seeds to the eventual demise of his riverside rural idyll.\n\nThe cottage stood on the Plenty River flood plain. Three times in the 1970s Harry was flooded out and on one occasion he battled a surge of water that came up to his chest inside the house. Harry dug a deep 100 foot trench to the river and carted 10 tons of white sand onto the river flats to shore up the property and to protect it from flooding, but it was to no avail. The Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works wanted Harry gone, reasoning that every time the river flooded there was of a risk of Harry’s septic getting into the stream. In 1978 the matter went all the way to the Housing Commission and The Honourable Geoff Hayes, the State Minister of Housing.\n\nIn the face of this Harry finally resolved to buy a block of land in Tarcoola Drive bordering the derelict Yallambie Homestead stables. He paid about $5000 for his block and designed and built a home, putting many of his own details into the construction of the interior, everything from the blue slate floor to the leadlight chimney window, (courtesy of his friendship with Rein Slagmolen). It was a far cry from the Yallambie Cottage but Harry didn’t stop there, carving a garden into the steep slope at the back of his Tarcoola Drive address, slashing blackberries and replacing them with clusters of pampas grass and a jungle of ferns. Hundreds of blue stone blocks were introduced into the landscape with Harry erecting a flying fox rope pulley to man handle the rocks down the slope and into position. Brick paving and ponds were designed to create a Japanese style feel to the garden.\n\nHarry said, “I love the feeling of rocks and water. I want to achieve a harmony between man and nature. I don’t think I’ll ever actually finish the garden. It’s an ongoing evolutionary process.”\n\nHe never did finish. Time had moved on and “Old Harry” was now approaching an age befitting his moniker. Soon after moving into his new home, vandals burned the pumping house and the cottage to the ground on the river flats.\n\nHarry said, “I don’t think I’ll ever shift out of Yallambie. It all depends whether I get married or not.”\n\nThe garden Harry built in Tarcoola Drive is now a ruin, his cottage and the pumping house little more than memory. The sobriquet “Harry’s” on a letter box of a house now the only pointer to the identity of its original owner.\n\nHarry didn’t marry of course. He died 30 years ago from a coronary occlusion while on the Heidelberg Golf Course, proof if proof be needed that if you’ve gotta go, better to go while doing something you love.\n\nBut for all that there are some who still think that Harry was true to his word. At the setting of the sun as the shadows lengthen under the trees on the river escarpment, there is a very real feeling that maybe Harry never left Yallambie after all. It is a belief held by the current owner and visitors to the Tarcoola Drive house that Harry built. At the closing of the day, the spirit of Old Harry lives on.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
