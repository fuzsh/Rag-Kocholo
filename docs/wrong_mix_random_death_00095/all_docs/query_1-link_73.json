        "text": "Collection Care, Preservation, Preventive conservation:\n\nBaron Ferdinand von Mueller served as Government Botanist and Director of the Botanical Gardens in the mid-1800s. He compiled and published ‘The Educational Collections of Australian Plants’ (1873-1876), motivated by a desire to bring botany to the masses. The Library’s edition was recently rehoused by our Preservation team.\n\nOur stories:\n\n‘The Queen’s Reading Room’ opened on 24 May 1859 when the south wing of the Library was completed. Restoration works began in 2017 and in 2019, the space was re-opened to the public as the Ian Potter Queen’s Hall.\n\nCollection, Such was life:\n\nThe Sun News-Pictorial captured so many Victorian stories. Its extensive coverage of local events, showing familiar places and faces, resonated with Victorians. After 100 years, it’s time to make these stories accessible to all by digitising the daily paper.\n\nAsk a librarian, New to the collection:\n\nThere have been a few new additions to our online eresources lately. These can be explored from outside the Library if you are a Victorian-resident Library member – log in with your Library member number, or sign up for membership online to begin. Let’s take a look at what’s available.\n\nCollections, Family matters:\n\nInternational Nurses Day is celebrated on Friday 12 May – the anniversary of Florence Nightingale’s birth. In today’s blog we explore the history of nursing in Victoria and take a glimpse at the nurses featured in our collection."
