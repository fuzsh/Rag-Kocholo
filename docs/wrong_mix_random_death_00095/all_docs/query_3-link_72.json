He established the Gardens’ scientific centre, The National Herbarium of Victoria, and amassed an extraordinary range of plants from every corner of the world.\n\nIn 1873 Mueller was succeeded by William Guilfoyle, who set about creating the Gardens’ world-famous ‘picturesque’ landscape style. Guilfoyle sculpted sweeping lawns, meandering paths and glittering lakes, creating a series of vistas offering a surprise around every corner. Guilfoyle was aided in his work by Melbourne’s mild climate, which allows an exotic mix of tropical and temperate plants to be grown.\n\nToday, the Gardens are home to more than 51,000 individual plants, representing over 12,000 species. They are a natural sanctuary for native wild life including black swans, bell birds, cockatoos and kookaburras. The Gardens are owned by the people of Victoria and managed by the Royal Botanic Gardens Board.\n\nBaron Ferdinand von Mueller, silver albumen photograph, c. 1867, State Library of Victoria, John Botterill., 1867, From the collection of: Public Record Office Victoria (State Archives of Victoria, Australia)\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nBaron Ferdinand Von Mueller, c 1867\n\nWilliam R Guilfoyle, Plan of the Melbourne Botanic Garden., Public Record Office Victoria, From the collection of: Public Record Office Victoria (State Archives of Victoria, Australia)\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nWilliam R Guilfoyle, Plan of the Melbourne Botanic Garden.\n\nPlan of the Melbourne Botanic Gardens, 1848.

It was set aside by the government around 1848, upon the advice of Superintendent La Trobe, to be developed as parkland.\n\nUntil 1862 the gardens were known as ‘Fitzroy Square’.\n\nIn 1856 the Melbourne Council commissioned Edward La Trobe Bateman (Charles La Trobe’s cousin) to design a layout for the gardens. His elaborate plan, however, proved too expensive and was never realised.\n\nFitzroy Gardens by Edward La Trobe Bateman, 1857, Public Record Office Victoria, public record office victoria, 1857, From the collection of: Public Record Office Victoria (State Archives of Victoria, Australia)\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nFitzroy Gardens by Edward La Trobe Bateman, 1857\n\n\"“..… strict adherence to the rules of landscape gardening, with regard to the grouping of trees… had to be abandoned in favour of the formal lining in the background of dense masses of conifers, evergreen shrubs, fern trees… small flowering shrubs and bedding flowers being merely introduced to mask the unsightly aspect of the grass in such reserves during summer.”\n\nClement Hodgkinson 1858\"\n\nMelbourne from Wellington Parade East Melbourne looking north west, oil on canvas, 1872., State Library of Victoria, Henry Burn, 1872, From the collection of: Public Record Office Victoria (State Archives of Victoria, Australia)\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nMelbourne from Wellington Parade East Melbourne looking north west, oil on canvas, 1872.\n\nFitzroy Gardens today, From the collection of: Public Record Office Victoria (State Archives of Victoria, Australia)\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nFitzroy Gardens today\n\nShowpiece of Melbourne\n\nIn 1858 Clement Hodgkinson redesigned the gardens, doing away with Bateman’s elaborate symmetry of winding curves, replacing them with vertical, horizontal and diagonal paths.\n\nHodgkinson’s design has often been thought to resemble the Union Jack, but this similarity was not intentional.\n\nBy the 1870s the gardens were much admired and considered the showpiece of Melbourne’s public gardens.\n\nUnder JT Smith, curator of the Fitzroy Gardens from 1921, changes were made. Many of the Stone Pines and Moreton Bay figs were replaced with lawns planted with Ginko, Limes, Palms and Silver Birch.\n\nWhen the Spanish mission style conservatory opened during the Great Depression, hundreds of people queued up to see the free floral displays.\n\nAC Cooke, Carlton Gardens, wood engraving, 1862, State Library of Victoria, AC Cooke, 1862, From the collection of: Public Record Office Victoria (State Archives of Victoria, Australia)\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nAC Cooke, Carlton Gardens, wood engraving, 1862.\n\nScene in the Carlton Gardens, 1877, State Library of Victoria, NJ Caire, 1877, From the collection of: Public Record Office Victoria (State Archives of Victoria, Australia)\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nCarlton Gardens 1877\n\nCarlton Gardens\n\nOften called the Exhibition Gardens, the Carlton Gardens were designed by Edward La Trobe Bateman in 1856. They were a World Heritage site.\n\nIt was an ongoing battle to maintain adequate fencing around the site, with broken fences and gates failing to prevent the entry of goats, as recorded by gardener William Hyndman in 1859. Early plantings in the gardens comprised of cypresses, pines, gums, wattles, cordylines, poplars and willows. The overall effect was informal and was poorly regarded by the press.\n\n\"“From end to end of this parallelogram there is little else but the very squalor of vegetation. The Corporation Gardener (WM Hyndman) has seemed always to be contemplating some brilliant success, but never achieving it.”\n\nThe Argus, 28 April 1870.\"\n\nPlan of Carlton Gardens, 1874, State Library of Victoria, 1874, From the collection of: Public Record Office Victoria (State Archives of Victoria, Australia)\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nOriginal Plan of Carlton Gardens 1874\n\nRoyal_Exhibition_Building_and_Carlton_Gardens, David Wong, From the collection of: Public Record Office Victoria (State Archives of Victoria, Australia)\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nCarlton Gardens today featuring the Royal Exhibition Building with straight diagonal paths\n\n1888 Centennial Exhibition\n\nHodgkinson’s hard work was obliterated when the gardens were redesigned for the 1880 Melbourne International Exhibition and the central third excised to accommodate Joseph Reed’s Royal Exhibition Building.\n\nThe northern garden has many fine avenues of oaks, elms and plane trees dating from the period after the 1888 Centennial Exhibition.\n\nDuring the exhibition, the garden had been dug up to make way for exhibits, but was subsequently replanted.\n\nView from observatory in Flagstaff Gardens, 1866, State Library of Victoria, Charles Nettleton, 1866, From the collection of: Public Record Office Victoria (State Archives of Victoria, Australia)\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nFlagstaff Gardens, 1866.

It was also popular as a place to fight duels. In 1850 it was the scene of celebrations when news arrived of the impending separation of the Port Phillip District from New South Wales. Not long after, the electric telegraph superseded signalling flags and the hill lost its attraction as a rendezvous. In 1862 West Melbourne residents petitioned the government to transform what had become a derelict hillside into public gardens.\n\nView from observatory in Flagstaff Gardens, 1866, State Library of Victoria, Charles Nettleton, 1866, From the collection of: Public Record Office Victoria (State Archives of Victoria, Australia)\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nFlagstaff Gardens, a social hub. c 1866\n\nClement Hodgkinson, from The Illustrated Australian News, 1893 mp006368, State Library of Victoria, 1893, From the collection of: Public Record Office Victoria (State Archives of Victoria, Australia)\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nClement Hodgkinson, from The Illustrated Australian News, 1893.

The gardens are part of the Domain parklands which stretch to the Royal Botanic Gardens and were first laid out in 1901 under the direction of Carlo Catani, Chief Engineer of the Public Works Department. They are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register due to their historical and archaeological significance. Originally this area of the gardens was used for timber cutting, cattle grazing and as a brick-makers’ field. Regular flooding occurred, until a new channel for the Yarra River was dug from 1896 to 1900 to straighten and widen the river. The spoil was used to fill the swampy lagoons and brickmakers' pits and to help raise the height of the river bank where the Alexandra Gardens now stand. The gardens were planned and laid out ready for the visit of the Duke of York in May 1901.\n\nAlexandra Gardens, c. 1900, State Library of Victoria, 1900, From the collection of: Public Record Office Victoria (State Archives of Victoria, Australia)\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nAlexandra Gardens, c. 1900.\n\nAlexandra Gardens, c. 1900, State Library of Victoria, 1900, From the collection of: Public Record Office Victoria (State Archives of Victoria, Australia)\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nAlexandra Gardens, c. 1900\n\nAlexandra Gardens as they look today featuring the many boathouses that line the Yarra, By Tirin at en.wikipedia [GFDL (www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html) or CC-BY-SA-3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)], from Wikimedia Commons, From the collection of: Public Record Office Victoria (State Archives of Victoria, Australia)\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nAlexandra Gardens showing boathouses\n\nThen and Now\n\nAt the beginning of the twenty-first century the lower reaches of the Yarra flowed through Melbourne’s central business district and the Docklands, a regulated canal contained by artificial banks, weaving its way between office and apartment skyscrapers, sprawling industry and port facilities, and finally emptying out into Port Phillip Bay.\n\nIn recent years, with the creation of the Southbank and Docklands precincts, the banks of the lower Yarra have witnessed a transformation. In addition to being popular with Melburnians enjoying the outdoors in adjoining parks and gardens, the Yarra has become a focus for new recreation, dining, commercial and retail spaces.\n\nMelbourneDocklandsTwilight, Wikimedia Commons, From the collection of: Public Record Office Victoria (State Archives of Victoria, Australia)\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nMelbourne Docklands at twilight\n\nRiver Yarra from Queen's Bridge, 1914, Public Record Office Victoria, 1914, From the collection of: Public Record Office Victoria (State Archives of Victoria, Australia)\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nRiver Yarra from Queen's Bridge, 1914\n\nLICENSE:EXHIBIT\n\nSave for any third party material, all online galleries content exhibited by Public Record Office Victoria is held by the State of Victoria.\n\nThese exhibitions are available for embedding in third party sites. please contact media@prov.vic.gov.au to make a request.\n\n© Copyright State of Victoria through Public Record Office Victoria 2015\n\nTo request a copy or permission to publish an image or record, please visit the Public Record Office Victoria website. http://prov.vic.gov.au/copyright\n\nPublic Record Office Victoria has endeavoured to acknowledge copyright owners of any third party information, whom can be identified, and respect their legal rights.
