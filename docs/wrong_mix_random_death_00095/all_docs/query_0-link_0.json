At Belzec he installed the\" showers\" the disguised gassing facilties and worked as a truck driver, in the motor pool transporting material to the death camp site. In April 1942 he collected a Russian water-cooled petrol engine from Lemberg, which was to produce the lethal gas for exterminating the Jews at Sobibor. He installed the engine with Erich Bauer and ensured that it worked with a trial gassing of Jews.\n\nErich Fuchs was then posted to Treblinka to assist with the installation of an engine in the gas chamber, which he testified; \"Subsequently I went to Treblinka. In this extermination camp I installed a generator which supplied electric light for the barracks. The work in Treblinka took me about three to four busy months. During my stay there transports of Jews who were gassed were coming in daily.\"\n\nIn December 1942 Fuchs managed to arrange his release from T4 and from early 1943 he worked for the German oil company Ostland  Ol-Vertriebsgesellschaft in Riga. In February 1945 he became a soldier and member of the Waffen-SS, where he served in a tank transport unit. In March 1945 he was wounded during a bombing raid.

Adolf Gentz served in Treblinka from August 1942 until October 1943. He served on the ramp at Treblinka. Richard Glazar recalled Adolf Gentz; If I imagine Gentz without the SS uniform, he could be a nice bright young man. I imagine him tossing his school bag into some corner and putting the field cap on his straight, bright red hair, buttoning his uniform jacket, grinning at the reflection in the mirror of the youthful freckled face with the strawberry blond eyebrows, and thinking, 'This is gonna be fun.' And when he got to Treblinka, and everyone around him eyed him with awe, then he told himself, 'Well, whadda ya know, this is fun.' After Treblinka was closed down Adolf Gentz was posted to the Sobibor death camp and assisted with the liquidation of that death camp. Then he served in Udine, Italy until the war ended. No further details known.\n\nGETZINGER, Anton\n\nBorn on 24 November 1910 in Oeblarn, Austria. He was described by his Ortsgruppenleiter as a 'fanatical National Socialist and a fighter for the ideas of our Führer Adolf Hitler.' Getzinger served at the T4 institute at Hartheim, near Linz.\n\nGetzinger arrived in Sobibor during April 1942 and he worked in Lager III. A few weeks before the revolt he was killed by a grenade in the Nordlager, where captured Soviet munitions were stored, in the presence of Hubert Gomerski, who explained what happened:\n\n\"We wanted to zero the aim of a machine-gun. We took two or three hand grenades, pounded a stake into the ground and wanted to put the grenades on top to hit them and blow them up. Toni hit it and was torn to shreds.\"\n\nTo cover up this embarrassing incident, an official NSDAP report of 9 December 1944 stated that Getzinger was killed in action fighting against bandits, while serving in a Sonderkommando in Serbia.\n\nGOMERSKI, Hubert\n\nHubert Gomerski - Far Right - Italy\n\nBorn on 11 November 1911 in Schweinheim and he worked at the T4 institutions at Hadamar and Hartheim. He arrived in Sobibor at the end of April 1942. Initially he was put in charge of a group of Ukrainian guards, but then worked alongside Bolender and Vallaster in Lager III.\n\nGomerski could be found on the ramp whenever a transport arrived, looking for the sick and disabled. He was known as 'the doctor' because of his past experience in handling the sick, and his speciality was braining the half dead with a steel water-can as they were taken off the trains. He also carried out executions in the Lazarett, of the sick, disabled and worker Jews sent there. He often took to balancing a bottle on the head of an Arbeitshaftling, getting him to stand against a wall, and then shooting him with his carbine.\n\nHis accomplishments at Sobibor earned him promotion to the rank of SS- Unterscharführer at Christmas 1942, he was on leave when the revolt took place in October 1943.\n\nThe Schwurgericht in Frankfurt am Main sentenced him to life imprisonment on 25 August 1950 for murdering an undisclosed number of people. He asked for a re-trial, which started on 12 December 1972 but this was ended prematurely due to ill-health reasons.
