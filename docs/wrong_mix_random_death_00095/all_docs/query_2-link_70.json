        "text": "When Melburnians seek a local escape from the hustle and bustle of city life, the Royal Botanical Gardens is often one of the first destinations to come to mind. But it’s likely most of us don’t know much about its history and its first director who made many significant contributions to the gardens: Baron Ferdinand von Mueller.\n\nIf it’s within your 5km radius and you’re looking for a new and educational outdoor activity, make your way to the Gardens for a free audio tour narrated by Mueller (voiced by an actor, of course) who has time-travelled into the present-day to visit his former haunt.\n\nMueller, who served a 20-year tenure as the garden’s first director starting in 1857, will speak to you about his joys and fill you in on the drama and frustration of his replacement by William Guilfoyle. He’ll also confront and come to terms with some of his own actions, including his contribution to colonisation, and his introduction of blackberries which became one of Australia’s most pesky invasive plant species."
