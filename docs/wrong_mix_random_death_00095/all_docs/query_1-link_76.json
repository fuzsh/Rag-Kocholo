Born in Germany in 1825, Mueller pursued his passion for plants by studying botany at Kiel University and earning his doctorate in 1847. In that same year, he embarked on a life-changing journey to Australia and settled in Adelaide. Mueller's expertise led him to become the Government Botanist for Victoria in 1853, where he established the prestigious National Herbarium of Victoria. Throughout his career, he organized and participated in numerous expeditions, receiving countless accolades for his groundbreaking botanical work. In recognition of his achievements, Mueller was honored with various titles and awards. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1861 and was knighted (KCMG) in 1879. Additionally, he received a German knighthood in 1867 and was granted the title of baron (Freiherr) in 1871. The engraving captured here dates back to around 1889 when Mueller's reputation as an esteemed botanist had reached its peak. This remarkable portrait depicts him as an accomplished scientist with deep knowledge of flora and natural history. As we gaze upon this monochrome artwork today, we honor Ferdinand Mueller's significant contributions to biology and celebrate his legacy as one of Australia's most influential figures within the scientific community during the late nineteenth century.\n\nMADE IN THE USA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
