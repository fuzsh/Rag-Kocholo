        "text": "Town Clerks Office\n\nTown Hall, Melbourne\n\n24th July 1867\n\nSir\n\nReferring to communications received from you in which you have been so good as to offer to improve the portion of the line of the St Kilda road which is between the buildings of the Immigrants Aid Society and the left bank of the Yarra and to the east of the causeway which carries the traffic to Princes Bridge, provided the eastern side fence of the causeway were closed up throughout its length so as to enable you to remove the remains of the post and rail fence which marked the western limit of the Governor's House reserve at the point in question â I have the honor to inform you that the Public Works Committee of the Council of the City of Melbourne have directed me to express their thanks for the offer which you have made, and to say that they will very willingly avail themselves of it, and for that purpose will direct the openings in the causeway fence to be closed, but that at the same time they think it better that the existing portion of the post and rail fence should remain so as to prevent future questions as to boundaries at the point in question.\n\nThe Committee incline the more strongly to this opinion as they consider that the unsightliness of the fence will be concealed by the trees which they understand is to be your intention to plant across the swamp.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour most obedient servant\n\nE. G. FitzGibbon\n\nTown Clerk.\n\nÂ\n\nDr F. Mueller F.R.S.\n\nDirector of the Botanical Garden\n\n&c &c &c"
