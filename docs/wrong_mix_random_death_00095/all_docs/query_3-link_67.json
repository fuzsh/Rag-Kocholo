        "text": "BY R.J.R.\n\nIt has been said that the first science\n\nin which research was carried out in Aus-\n\ntralia was botany. Sir Joseph Banks and\n\nDr. Solander had made a beginning dur-\n\ning Captain Cook's voyage; then Robert\n\nBrown, one of the most famous of botan-\n\nists, who accompanied Flinders in the In-\n\nvestigator, added materially to the store,\n\nas did Allan Cunningham; and so it prac-\n\ntically remained until the arrival of Fer-\n\ndinand von Mueller in 1847. Born at\n\nRostock, on the Baltic, in 1825, Mueller\n\nfirst studied medicine at Kiel. Then he\n\nstudied botany. Alarmed with the dis\n\ncovery that he was likely to fall a victim\n\nto phthsis [phthisis], an hereditary complaint, he de-\n\ncided to migrate to South Australia, which\n\nhe had heard described as a land of per-\n\npetual sunshine. Having been engaged\n\npreviously for some seven years in the\n\ninvestigation of plant life in Schleswig\n\nand Holstein, his natural bent and love\n\nfor botany led him to devote his energies\n\nalong similar lines in Australia. Travel-\n\nling extensively, exploring and delighting\n\nin the work, he spent five years of ardu-\n\nous research in South Australia. Then\n\nhe accepted the position of Government\n\nBotanist of Victoria. Continuing his bo-\n\ntanical investigations, he traversed nearly\n\nall the settled districts and beyond ; he\n\nalso instituted many geographic explora-\n\ntions in the Australian Alps; which until\n\nhis appearance were little explored. For\n\nabout three years he roamed Victoria in\n\nthis fashion. Men of the day marvelled\n\nthat this man who had migrated to the\n\ncolony on account of bad health could be\n\nso energetic. Ever on the move, he forced\n\nhis way out from Gippsland through the\n\nentrancing jungle lands of the Dividing\n\nRanges; he was the first person to ascend\n\nglorious Mount Wellington; it was he\n\nwho discovered, named and was the first\n\nto reach the peaks of Mount Latrobe and\n\nMount Hotham. Mueller was really a\n\ndelicately constituted man; but his spirit\n\nwas magnificent, and it triumphed over\n\nthe flesh. His was a hard life; he tramped\n\nfrom range to range, adding to Victorian\n\ngeography, as well as collecting and classi-\n\nfying the many delightful specimens of\n\nplants he encountered during his travels.\n\nHe was most happy when lost in the\n\nfern junglesâ€” such ferns they were, grand\n\nand majestic. He had never seen such\n\ngrowths before, and when he did come\n\nupon them, wild as they were, and grow-\n\ning 'midst mossy foliage and plants, all\n\nset in a gully garden, through which\n\ntrickled a sparkling stream, great was his\n\ndelight.\n\nIn 1855-56 Mueller joined A. C. Gregory's\n\ngreat northern expedition as naturalist.\n\nThe party, landing at the Cambridge Gulf,\n\nexplored the course of the Victoria River,\n\nand after a long, laborious journey reached\n\nthe settled districts of Queensland. As\n\none result of this expedition, which occu-\n\npied seventeen months, Mueller added to\n\nscience no fewer than 500 species of plants\n\nbefore unknown. Returning to Melbourne,\n\nhe was appointed first director of the Botanic\n\nGardens, which until that time had\n\nbeen managed by a committee, of which\n\nSir Redmond Barry was chairman. The\n\neminent German soon raised the gardens\n\nto a leading Victorian institution, laying\n\nthe botanic foundation of what has been\n\ndescribed as one ol the most beautiful re-\n\nserves in the world. Mueller built the first\n\npalm house in Australia' (in 1858), and\n\nhe was the first to cultivate the great\n\nVictoria Rcgia, a beautiful water lily. He\n\nraised foreign forest trees in thousands,\n\nand these were distributed amongst the\n\nAustralian public botanical institutions.\n\nIntroducing many species of plants into\n\nthe Botanic Gardens, he later brought nu-\n\nmerous new native resources before the\n\ngreat exhibitions.\n\nMuller [Mueller] wrote extensively, many\n\ndescriptive works on Australian plants\n\nstanding to his credit. His \"Frag-\n\nmenta Phytographiae Australiae\" (10\n\nvols.), was destined to be a receptacle\n\nof definitions of all the new plants which\n\nhe himself and his student correspondents\n\ndiscovered. This work was written in\n\nLatin, and is perhaps the only such work\n\nthat has been produced in Australia. He\n\nissued an enlarged English edition of\n\nWettslein's [Wettstein's?] ''Organic Chemistry of\n\nPlants,\" and brought out \"Plants of Vic-\n\ntoria\" (2 vols.), which was- profusely il-\n\nlustrated. A publication on vcgetable\n\nfossils of the gold drifts, a volume on\n\nindustrial plants, contributions to scien-\n\ntific literature, and many smaller essays\n\nand reports, came from his pen. This\n\nGerman botanist was a great worker.\n\nAt the period when his name loomed\n\nlarge in the botanical world it was gener-\n\nally accepted that he had no rival in the\n\nfield of classifactory botany, and Mueller\n\nwas proud ot the occasional mention that\n\nhe was a Victorian by adoption. In 1863\n\nhe joined Mr. Bentham, tho famous phyto-\n\ngraphcr, in a full elaboration of the uni-\n\nversal flora of Australia. This work in-\n\nvolved the examination of 100,000 speci-\n\nmens, took seventeen years to complete,\n\nand was first universal flora of any of\n\nthe great divisions of the world. When\n\nBcntham was forced to cease his labors\n\non the work, on account of his great age,\n\nMuellcr undertook to complete the great\n\ntask, and he did. Published as \"Flora\n\nAustraliensis,\" it was immediately recog-\n\nnised as a masterpiece of its kind, and it\n\nwon well-earned honors for its chief au-\n\nthor. The King of Wurtemberg made him\n\na baron; the Queen made him a K.C.M.G.,\n\nand, what was more pleasing to Mueller,\n\nthe Royal Society ot London created him\n\na fellow. Many sovereigns bestowed de-\n\ncorations on him, including the Com-\n\nmandcr Order of St. Isabella of Spain,\n\nand of St. lago of Portugal; he was one\n\nof the first three in Australia to receive\n\nthe Order of St. Michael and St. George.\n\nMueller rode and trudged over some 27,000\n\nmiles of Australian tcrritory during his\n\npersonal travels in connection with bo-\n\ntanical research. He called for a search\n\nfor Dr. Leichhardt, and the first two im-\n\nportant expeditions of E. Giles came of\n\nhis suggestions. The German botanist,\n\nwho proved his love for his adopted land\n\nin many ways, was the first to move for"
