This print showcases Ferdinand Mueller, a renowned Australian botanist whose contributions to the field of botany are still celebrated today. Born in Germany in 1825, Mueller pursued his passion for plants by studying botany at Kiel University and earning his doctorate in 1847. In that same year, he embarked on a life-changing journey to Australia and settled in Adelaide. Mueller's expertise led him to become the Government Botanist for Victoria in 1853, where he established the prestigious National Herbarium of Victoria. Throughout his career, he organized and participated in numerous expeditions, receiving countless accolades for his groundbreaking botanical work. In recognition of his achievements, Mueller was honored with various titles and awards. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1861 and was knighted (KCMG) in 1879.

The engraving captured here dates back to around 1889 when Mueller's reputation as an esteemed botanist had reached its peak. This remarkable portrait depicts him as an accomplished scientist with deep knowledge of flora and natural history.
