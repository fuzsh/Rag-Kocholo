        "text": "Punk rock was never meant to be this sentimental.\n\nCertainly, in 1986, Steve Albini himself was never, on the surface, sentimental.\n\nBut age changes us all, and of course, punk rock itself was incredibly sentimental. In the end, it was a clutch of nerdish fucked up kids thrust into adulthood disgusted at a shitty world and reflecting that back it like angry mirrors.\n\nAnd none of them ever sounded as disgusted as Steve Albini singing Kerosene with Big Black.\n\nTonight, we are in shock as we have lost one of the gang and the arch noisenik himself, Steve Albini, whose own music and the 1500 bands he recorded, were allowed to sonically breathe, freed from the constraints of tedious showbiz posturing.\n\nGodspeed you! the Big Black emperor.\n\nMaybe Andy Music Reviews said it the best in his tweet tonight about Steve Albini’s passing.\n\n‘So sad and so sudden. What a legend. No more Shellac or ‘engineered by Steve Albini’ on albums. Shocking, awful news.’\n\nThe outpouring of grief at Steve’s sudden death summed up the affection that he was held in on the scene – partly for his brilliant recording techniques, partly because of his amazing bands, and partly for the sweet soul that lurked behind his vociferous take no fools facade or partly because he defined the post-punk wars DIY ideal that was the true revolution of punk rock itself.\n\nSteve Albini was perhaps cast in amber as the confrontational noise guru of the early eighties, the hyper-intelligent nerd kid who was armed with acidic quips. His first band, Big Black, was a drum machine-driven music that stripped post-punk to the core with its minimalistic intent and perfectly realised sounds. It took Sisters Of Mercy’s early Roland 606 drum machine template, Gang Of Four’s jagged guitars and Suicide’s shivering minimalism and turned it into the true art of darkness with an added noisenik avalanche of the Death To Trad Rock bands in the UK that we were all pottering around in.\n\nFrom the start, he was onto something.\n\nWhereas the UK groups could never get their sound right, Albini was chipping away towards perfection, and the music’s infernal and compulsive nastiness was matched by brilliantly acidic interviews.\n\nIn the mid-eighties, Steve Albini sounded and felt dangerous.\n\nI guess, like a lot of people thundering out of punk, his anger and despair at the world saw him set the controls to the heart of the sun with a kamikaze creative attitude and a fuck the world sense of wind up that was totally wired to wind up people of any ilk.\n\nYears later, the layers would peel back, and a truly sensitive, beautiful soul emerged from behind the archetype (as he himself explained in the interview below). You could always sense it was there, and he was always a loyal friend or comrade at Punk Rock Arms from when I was in touch with him in the mid-eighties and met him face to face at his first gig in Manchester on November 24th 1986, which he famously documented in his tour diary in Forced Exposure.\n\nThe years rolled by, and it felt like Steve Albini was going to somehow be sat there forever in his studio, engineering one record after another. There must be thousands of releases with ‘recorded by Steve Albini’ on them and his legacy is both one of volume and quality.\n\nHe was one of those rare people in the cluttered music biz that was instantly identifiable; his sound, his attitude, and his sheer presence cut through all the chatter, whether it was his bands, his interviews or his poker and cooking missives.\n\nThe shock of his sudden death that came out of the blue has sent the internet reeling and the memories come flooding back of a true punk rock warlord who lived the DIY manifesto and honed it down to a perfection.\n\nHe first popped up on my radar in 1984 when I was writing band-to-band letters from the Membranes to Naked Raygan – a brilliant Chicago band whose post-hardcore was the early rumblings of a route out of the new noise. Their long letters mentioned this other group that their singer Jeff Pezzati was playing bass for. A year later, we heard that this group was trying to get in touch in that remote pre-internet age when you couldn’t even track someone’s phone number.\n\nFinally, in 1986, we were signed to American label Homestead Records and toured America and were in touch with Steve as he was friends with label boss Gerard Cosloy. The pair of them had the same incendiary sense of humour, and that sense of high IQ danger stranger that had been inherent in early punk was catching fire in their fanzine-driven world.\n\nAt our first real-life meeting at the 1986 Manchester show at the Archway, we somehow agreed to the Membranes going to his house in Chicago to record our third album Kiss Ass, Godhead. At the time, we had only made a couple of records that sounded like us, and the rest were near misses. We knew Steve knew how to make this stuff sound good. His records were a testament to this, and he was also a fan of our sound and our kamikaze DIY approach.\n\nA few months later, we turned up in Chicago to spend five days around his house. Our drummer – Coofy Sid – couldn’t get a visa for a couple of weeks, so we would have to borrow the Big Black drum machine, which was a strange looking thing in a big wooden box.\n\nBefore we had even seen that faintly sci-fi contraption, Steve picked us up from the train station after our 17 hour long train trip across the US from New York airport. We drove through the Chicago freeway in one of those huge American cars with Steve lounged at the wheel in a slightly too big leather jacket and fedora. We went round to Steve’s workplace where he was touching up the art of advertising posters whilst he explained the psychology to the Camel cigarettes poster that he was working on at the time. Leaving him at work, we picked up his house keys and got the local train to Evanston, where he lived. I clearly remember dumping our stuff off in his bungalow in the suburban district in the searing late spring heat and sitting in his garden waiting for him to come back from work, watching ants build a nest.\n\nThat evening, he was faintly shocked to find out we were vegetarian, and his darkly hilarious spikey side came out as he dug out books of operations with intestines hanging out as he chomped down on a steak. We were not arsed and found his attack perfectly punk rock hilarious. Steve was a great host and drove us around Chicago and even to a gig in Muncie, Indiana to play the No Bar & Grill. Years later, when he had built his super studio Electrical Audio, he put us up for three days when we were on tour with Goldblade and had nowhere to stay. He couldn’t do enough for us and we even had a room each to recover from the rigours of long drive American tours as he played pool with us and was even beaten at his favourite game by our driver, Dave Norman, before spending hours explaining the minutiae of baseball to us and taking us on a guided tour of the studio built to replicate the ambience of Abbey Road with specific brieze blocks to deflect the sound and a stunning collection of ribbon mics that he meticulously explained in detail one by one.\n\nBack in 1986 he had only just started his recording career, and his house was his studio. The mixing desk was in his upstairs back room, and the cellar was the live room with a small staircase leading down to it, which we recorded my hobnail boots descending down and creaking the door open at the beginning of one track.\n\nHe was using an early version of his ambient mic technique, which he used on the drum machine which was played back in the cellar, picking up the clattering room sound. Our guitars sounded weedy, so he took us to the local guitar shop to buy guitar pedals, which we had not used up to that time, being far too purest in our approach for such rockist equipment. I bought a Rat pedal, which I still use to this day, and the guitar player, Nick Brown, picked up some kind of chorus effect – Steve was then into chorus effects and also into gated reverb and those added textures added some colour to his early stark sonic terrain.\n\nYou can hear both on one of the tracks we recorded at the session here.\n\nWe talked of our mutual love of the Strangler’s Black and White album and also the Sisters, Gang Of Four, the Three Johns and primitive post-punk DIY as he honed the tracks down.\n\nThey sound great to this day.\n\nA couple of months later he came out to the UK to finish the album off at Lion Studios in Leeds, where we shared the room of a house with him whilst he mixed the tracks we had already laid down which was not the way he would work in the future but we had no idea of how he worked his magic.\n\nI remember his skeletal frame when we met him in Leeds station, sitting on his suitcase waiting for us, and then after the sessions lying on the floor under his ever-present fedora, not really falling asleep in the trashed shared room of the house we were crashing in. Somehow despite these typically harsh conditions of eighties DIY, he dredged something really great from the messy sessions, and the Kiss Ass Godhead album was our sonic high point album-wise. It was so good that I evangelised about his sound to fellow bands persuading them to go and work with him despite his then terrifying reputation.\n\nWe even played a show with Big Black in Newport in Wales a few months later – it was the worst gig we ever played but Big Black were magnificent.\n\nAfter that, Big Black imploded, and his new band was the unfortunately named Rapeman, which he had already told me about a few months before when we were recording in Chicago. He was really going for the jugular with that monicker, and I did try and tell him in an interview I conducted that it was going to get in the way of the music, which was great. I heard the newly recorded tracks like Budd in Chicago as he showed us the video of the politician Budd Dwyer who the song was about shooting himself on live TV.\n\nThe interview for his new band was for Sounds in the back room by the recording desk and would run a few months later when he launched the new band.\n\nA chunk of the interview concerned the band name, which I questioned. It was part of the moral disgust of punk, and he was doing the punk thing of cranking the filth and the outrage of the world and shoving it back in its face – the real Steve was nothing like the dangerous Steve, and even if all his interviews at the time were peppered with outrage and wind-ups and vicious truth telling and an undertow of disgust at life he was really a sensitive and deeply intelligent soul.\n\nAs the years rolled by, we kept in touch. I interviewed him several times and loved the albums and gigs by his new band Shellac, who from the start were like the logical conclusion of rock – the most perfect sounding band that ever existed and the band that all his recording brilliance somehow seemed created for. The rhythm section was perfect with Todd Trainer’s lyrical and powerful dislocated drumming brilliance and Bob Weston’s grinding bass combined with Steve’s adept and brilliant guitar playing.\n\nThey also operated outside the rock n roll circus. They toured when they felt like it, played weird venues and didn’t use road crews or even monitors. Every aspect was thought out, and none of the cliches of rock were embraced.\n\nWe got to play with them a few times – at the 2012 ATP festival, where they invited us onto the bill and were very kind to us, and we made up for that dreadful gig in Newport years before. We played at a festival in Croatia with them in 2018 and spent a brilliant night afterwards in the backstage tent in the warm night air laughing at the incredulity of life and music. The last interview I did with him was in 2019 at Grauzone festival. It was an on-stage conversation, and it’s transcribed below. The interview was fascinating in that Steve was as funny and sharp as ever and had not compromised his attitude to music making but kinda apologised for his spikey younger self which in itself by doing so only added to his no compromise sense of right and wrong by taking himself down when needed.\n\nFrom those brief glimpses of working in the studio with Steve with the Membranes and in 1996 when he recorded the second Goldblade single, Black Elvis, I learned so much, which became part of my armoury when I recorded other bands.\n\nThe best recording engineer in the world, Steve Albini allowed the artist’s true vision onto the tape with none of the smoke and mirrors of showbiz. The astonishing visceral capture of that sound had its own temple with his purpose-built Chicago studio and collection of mics that were perfect to capture every creak and nuance of the sound and, conversely, make it sound gigantic and yet clear.\n\nSteve was not a noise merchant. His recordings were meticulous and careful and measured just like he was. The sound was full of space and allowed to breathe, and those mics really picked up every nuance and shiver of the guitars.\n\nHis own powerful vision was particularly underlined by his own brilliant band, Shellac, whose live shows and recordings are some of the most thrilling in rock music whilst retaining a powerful originality like post-punk boiled down to a minimalist yet pulverising perfection.\n\nSteve was the heart and soul of our culture.\n\nOne of the gang.\n\nHe was a creative powerhouse and a stand-up guy who will be deeply missed.\n\nThis has been a sad day.\n\nInterview from 2019 (if you want to listen to the interview it is here)\n\nSteve Albini first burst onto the music scene in the 1980s with the explosive drum machine-driven Big Black whose visceral sound and very dark subject matter was a wake-up call. He was also an acidic acerbic presence on a moribund music scene with interviews that would deliberately provoke the boundaries of good taste and prod the liberal consensus.\n\nIt was provocative in the sense that punk rock was provocative – designed to create a reaction and test the boundaries. At the time we all understood that language and understood the nuances and the testing purpose of their narrative. Decades later many of those interviews would not be read in the same way and assumptions would be made without knowledge of the angles and stances being taken.\n\nInitially, I was going to run one of those interviews I did with Steve back in 1987 but in the cold light of modern print I realised that what he was saying at the time could be easily and deliberately be misinterpreted and shine the wrong light on him so have decided to run a more recent interview I did with him instead that cleared a lot of his past up whilst adding a wisdom and sensitivity that age brings and yet no compromise on his art and music.\n\nIn the interview, he details his recording career before dealing with his changing and shifting personal attitudes later in the piece.\n\nJohn Robb: When did you start recording bands? I remember going to your house in Evanston, Chicago, with my band, the Membranes, back in 1986 and recording tracks for an album in your cellar when you had just started.\n\nSteve Albini: I had just started when you came to Chicago. I had built a studio in the basement of my house when I bought it in 1986. Big Black recorded our last recording session there – a session for the John Peel show in 1987. When Big Black ended, I didn’t have a band, but I had a studio. So initially, it sort of became a resource for other bands, and your band was one of the very first bands to record there.\n\nBefore the Membranes came, I had actually recorded a country and western singer named Robbie Fulks in the basement. Recently I did another album with him after all those years and that album was nominated for a Grammy Award which was a very different place from when we all started.\n\nI enjoy working and dealing with the same people for a very, very long time. There are very long threads of continuity in the music scene. Sometimes, it seems like I’m still dealing with the same people that I dealt with 25 years ago, like when I’m in Japan, I’m still communicating with the same people that I communicated with 25 years ago.\n\nI think that part of the long-term nature of those relationships is the fact that I have never been very professional about anything and everything has always been done as a social interaction more than a business one. I’m still on good terms with many of the people I have worked with and have not fallen out over some contract disputes.\n\nJohn Robb: Were you always interested in recording and eventually running a studio? The early Big Black records were astonishingly made in your bedroom\n\nSteve Albini: It was a matter of necessity recording in my bedroom at the very beginning. I had been in bands, punk bands and such since the late 1970s, and it seems hard to believe now, but at that time, a lot of bands would go through their entire existence without ever recording anything just because going to a recording studio is prohibitively expensive.\n\nAlso, there really wasn’t any personal recording gear that you could use apart from Hifi tape recorders that were not suited to doing multitrack readings then. So most bands would go through their entire lifecycle and would never have any evidence that they had existed.\n\nThere started to be some more compact recording equipment available in the late 1970s. Then it was quite typical for a music store to have a recording package that they would rent to bands to record demo tapes and it would be a four-track reel-to-reel tape recorder the one reel of tape that everyone used and one microphone. When that came in it became a habit of mine to rent equipment like that and to record my band and to record my friend’s bands and, for me, it just sort of grew into a more professional recording existence from there, but it would it was very, very much a matter of necessity in the beginning.\n\nJohn Robb: So few bands of that post-punk period had any interest in the recording techniques and so few studios had a clue how to record the new sound. I think you were about the only person I met up to that time who knew how to actually work a studio and make things sound the way they were intended.\n\nSteve Albini: Within every circle of musicians, though, there was always that one guy in your town who was interested in recording. Like somebody that got fired from a studio or something. Or there was always some guy that ran a sound company out of his garage or whatever, that had a tape recorder and he would do recordings of bands.\n\nThere was always somebody like that. In Minneapolis, near where I grew up, there was a guy named Brian Paulson who was an audio engineer and is now best known for recording albums by Slint, Uncle Tupelo, Son Volt, Superchunk and Wilco who had become a recording engineer and had recorded a bunch of records.\n\nI then knew a guy in New York, and someone in Louisville, Kentucky doing the same.\n\nThere was a guy that all the bands would go to in every town, like some local person who made himself available as a recording person. Before I had a proper studio, there was a guy in Chicago named Tim Powell, who was friends and roommates with all of the early punk bands in Chicago, and he had a van and he put a bunch of recording equipment in his van and he would drive to the rehearsal spaces and record the bands in the rehearsal spaces. He eventually made a business out of that and then had a mobile recording truck that recorded hundreds of albums and live albums all around the country. And he’s still in still in business and still doing precisely that and going to record Fish or Bruce Springsteen or whatever.\n\nJohn Robb: So he now sits at the top table with his recording gear!\n\nSteve Albini:Yes, he is a well-known figure in the recording world now.\n\nJohn Robb: From the start did you have quite a strong idea of how things should be recorded, There’s a fantastic interview you did early on about how bands should operate and how they should make records.\n\nSteve Albini: Again, a lot of that is purely practical.\n\nIf you’re operating as a working band where you have a limited amount of money that you’re generating from the band then you can’t bankrupt the band with a recording by trying to make the White Album or whatever.\n\nYou have to keep it practical. Otherwise, you create a problem for the existence and sustainability of the band. So the practical aspect of the recording is a big influence on my recording techniques and my recording philosophy. Just trying to be efficient, trying to make sure that the bands get an accurate representation of what they do is key and also where you don’t waste time or money whilst trying to try to do something fantastic.\n\nI have to admit that recording technology has become much more ubiquitous now. These days everyone has access to some kind of recording capability. Now, the idea of spending weeks or months or even years on an album in a studio is not quite so realistic. Whereas previously to spend that kind of time in the studio, you would have to have someone subsidising you. Someone would have to be out of their mind and just indulge you in order to make the recording.\n\nBut now, it’s quite common for people to spend a year or more working on a recording alone in their apartment. Eventually, it comes out and it’s a very personalised thing that they have uniquely crafted over a very long period of time. It’s a completely different aesthetic and a completely different way of working. But I think it’s perfectly valid.\n\nI think it’s it’s another step into the kind of empowerment of individual little players in the music scene. These days, anyone who wants to can make a record, and anyone who wants to can kind of find an audience. It’s like if you wanted to tonight you could go home and sing a song into your iPhone and post it on YouTube. Then if other people liked it tomorrow morning, you could be famous in Malaysia!\n\nI think that aspect of things is the biggest single biggest change in music from when I was first playing in the 70s and 80s. Just the fact that the whole world can potentially and randomly hear about your band or your music very easily now,\n\nThere is, of course, an extraordinary, overwhelming glut of material out there. So getting the attention of the world is now problematic. It’s not like it used to be in that you could hire people to make people pay attention to your music by forcing it on the radio or by making a videotape or something like that.\n\nIn my circle of friends, the music that people listen to is extremely personal. Like, if you go into somebody’s office, while they’re working, what they’re listening to, is not the radio that everyone else was listening to. It’s some personally selected playlists of music that’s uniquely suited to their taste. I think that’s also wonderful. For the listener, you no longer are limited to listening to what other outside corporate interests have decided you should listen to, you can listen to literally anything. I think that is also amazing as a listener.\n\nBut what it what it also does is it to prevent the existence of a single monolithic cultural movement. Like, if you look at the eras of pop music, there were very specific sort of eras where certain stylistic things were norms and now I feel like we’re at the very end of that. Now many little fractured sub-genres have their own internal consistency. But there is no great overall thrust to music. And I personally think that’s wonderful. But it does mean that if you are just some random person making music to suit yourself, there isn’t necessarily a convenient stream for you to plug into to find an audience, you have to find an audience. Every band has to find an audience individually,\n\nJohn Robb: The idea of being connected through a culture was powerful at the time. Especially if it was quite remote where you grew up. When punk rock came along, you felt you were plugged into something.\n\nSteve Albini: Punk rock, definitely changed my life. The idea of punk rock being what people could do with limited means. They could do whatever they wanted to express themselves and other people would give them room to do it.\n\nOther people like them, their peers, would be their audience. It was a revolutionary idea for me. Because up until then, I had only thought of music as being part of a remote industry, the show business industry where the limousine pulled up and the rock star came out and was escorted by security onto the stage. Then the professional musicians played and just this new idea that 20 people in a room could be a gig was, groundbreaking.\n\nThat was an incredible revelation to me. When I moved to Chicago in 1980, I found an extremely active music scene. It was a small number of people, maybe 100 or so at the most, but all of those people were really smart and really motivated and really aggressively trying to advance culture and art with whatever means they had available.\n\nThat was completely intoxicating to me.\n\nI had come to Chicago to ostensibly go to college but what I really did was I came to Chicago in order that I could find a music scene and I took to this underground scene like a fish to water.\n\nJohn Robb: When you look back on Big Black now, and I guess you don’t often look back do you see a Steve Albini that is very different from the Steve Albini of now? Then you were testing and acidic and in your face.\n\nSteve Albini: There is a thing that’s true of young men in particular, where they get an idea and they are so proud of themselves for having that idea that they feel they need to share it with everyone. I fell victim to that organic impulse and I thought I was a fucking genius (laughs) and that everybody else was an idiot. I thought I’m the only person that’s got it figured out and it’s time for me to straighten everybody out. But the longer you live, the more you realise how little you knew back when you thought that you knew everything.\n\nI feel as I’ve grown and matured I can appreciate the aesthetics of what I was doing. More than that I can appreciate the other person that I may not agree with on just on a personal level whereas before I probably made an unnecessary number of enemies. I was probably unnecessarily judgmental of people who hadn’t had the same ideas that I had. Now I feel like part of that process of maturing is being able to appreciate the differences between what you think and what other people think and it’s something other than warfare!\n\nJohn Robb: Was there also an element of being very deliberately provocative with Big Black?\n\nSteve Albini: Big Black had a sort of a central conceit and that central conceit was that everyone is capable of all of the distant abstract horrors that you hear of other people perpetrating.\n\nWe’re all the same species and given the same stimulus and given the same situations, who knows what any of us would do under these extreme circumstances? The central conceit being that we were all capable of being monsters also had two sides. One side was that you think you’re above all of this human ugliness and that you’re looking down on it from an elevated position.\n\nBut you’re not – you are a part of it. It’s a spectrum, and you’re on that spectrum so the other part of it is that you recognise the humanity in the people who are horrible and that they are human beings that at some point also felt love and warmth and affection and finding the triggers that can shut those impulses off and turn people into the performative monsters, is a pretty important part of the human existence. Find the things that make people awful, and mute them and find the things that allow people to be decent and moral and normal, and encourage them.\n\nSo Big Black focused on the ugly side of humanity because, at the time, there was a kind of general cultural whitewashing going on where unpleasant behaviour or anti-social behaviour was punished and forgotten whereas I thought it should be explored as a more natural part of the human condition.\n\nJohn Robb: How does that mindset affect you, as somebody who’s dealing with it in an artistic way? Did it create a very negative atmosphere for you as a person? Or was there a switch on and switch off button that you press?\n\nSteve Albini: I think it made me fairly insensitive at the time. That might be one of those personality traits that I now feel some shame about and also using someone else’s suffering, but my first instinct was not to try to ameliorate that suffering, my first instinct was to examine it sort of academically and figure out who was causing the suffering and why.\n\nSo that made me a colder person, and probably a more cynical person than I am now.\n\nJohn Robb:\n\nYou were testing though at the time! Interviews were combative and controversial and when we stayed at your place you were getting books of operations outwit exposed wounds and things and showing the live TV footage of the Pennsylvania state treasurer Budd Dwyer who was convicted of bribery charges blowing his brains out on live TV in 1986. So there was that kind of atmosphere, but that makes it sound a lot more unpleasant than it was as you were also a very generous host as well!\n\nSteve Albini:\n\nI can imagine enjoying that in the way that I would enjoy certain things at the time. I wouldn’t do that now. yeah, and I don’t think I would enjoy being around someone who did. I also think that there has been a general cultural shift now and people are more aware of their influence on other people and I think this general cultural shift, which some people call political correctness has been, overall, a very good thing, and has made people generally more decent to one another. To me is a kind of an achievement and it’s nothing to be self-conscious about.\n\nI didn’t have the critical impulse that other people had about feeling restrained by notions of propriety or decency. I think being aware of those things, and treating other people with respect, is good and honourable and I’m glad that I have been woken up to it.\n\nJohn Robb: It was testing but we understood why it was necessary. Punk was deliberately offensive and brutally honest.\n\nSteve Albini: Then I was certainly deaf to criticism and I don’t know that I am deaf to criticism now. I probably don’t immediately heed it. But at the time, I had, I thought that all criticism of my way of thinking and my friend’s and my peer’s way of thinking was, by default, ignorant\n\nJohn Robb: Was there a specific turning point? Or was it just a gradual process?\n\nSteve Albini: I think it’s been very gradual. Like, I’ve maintained continuity in the music scene. The whole time, I’ve been playing in bands and making records for\n\nI haven’t, I haven’t done the math, but a long time almost forty years, which is a long time.\n\nDuring that whole period, I’ve been surrounded by the current active music scene and with people who are the age that I was when I was first being active in bands. people in their late teens or their 20s and as I’ve got older the bands are still the same ages. I’ve seen a general sort of warming of the humanity of those people, even on a lot of heavy metal records, which are sort of, by default, very dark and very heavy. Those people, especially, as they personally age and mature and become wiser, and grow families and things like that, those people can be incredibly warm, inviting people. Also, people who’ve been doing experimental performances where they were doing something like hacking a goat head in pieces and it’s a very performative and very bracing yet dark performance, but those people on a personal level can be quite warm and can be quite comfortable people to be around and more so now.\n\nJohn Robb: Quite often the most extreme music’s made by the most gentle people, it’s the most interesting dichotomy.\n\nSteve Albini: And then you find out that there’s somebody that does a puppet show for children, who’s a monster!\n\nJohn Robb: So what does this change bring to Shellac? Does the way you change as you get older, change the band?\n\nSteve Albini: It’s odd and unusual to be of the age that you used to consider beyond the pale when I was in my 20s. Then I thought anybody in their 50s was clearly a fraud. I would then think, ‘Why does that guy even put his guitar on anymore? I thought it was funny and ridiculous. But then the impulse to do it is still there. When we started this band, 25 years ago, something like that would have been hilarious.\n\nThen I was fairly certain that this would be the last band I was in however long it lasted. I wasn’t interested in going through the motions of being a musician, just out of familiarity. There was a kind of an object of ridicule in our music scene, where these people who were these lifer musicians who just went from one band to another to another and always felt aggrieved that they had never achieved enough success and were always feeling\n\nentitled because they had been around and they’d paid their dues.\n\nThose kinds of people were an embarrassment and I never wanted to become like that. So I’ve tried to remain grounded in the day-to-day being in the band, and I’ve tried to remain very, very attached to the present active scene of music rather than my idealised remembrance of it.\n\nThere’s not a lot of nostalgia in play for me right now. I’m not a nostalgic person by nature. But I do run into other people who are our age and our 50s, who have been in music for a period and many, many, many of them are stuck in their notion of the way music should be conducted, and don’t like the change, they will say stuff like, ‘ they won’t even to let you smoke on stage anymore.’\n\nThere’s this, there’s this sort of tooled leather quality on where it’s like, you know, they spent so long perfecting this notion of themselves or this image of themselves that they don’t want to waste it. They want to keep that same thing going forever. So they keep the long motorcycle boots, put on the leather jacket and they go and do the same thing they’ve been doing forever. On one hand, I can admire that as a kind of commitment. On the other hand, I don’t want to be that. I want to be engaged in the present day and the way the world is as it actually is as opposed to how I wish it was and the way it used to be. That’s a weakness that I see in some of my peers that I don’t want to indulge myself in.\n\nJohn Robb: Do you challenge yourself to stay contemporary – keep creating and to keep pushing\n\nSteve Albini: Specifically, in Shellac, we don’t have any stylistic references. It’s not like we’re playing a style of music that we want to continue. We’re just pursuing what’s in front of us and what’s engaging to us at that moment. So the current batch of songs have a style of playing that is unique to this current batch and not reminiscent of the previous batch. The songs that we write next year will have their own thing and it takes us about a year to write a song and I expect them to be different still.\n\nIt’s not a conscious effort but I would say that we have walled ourselves off from the rest of the world in terms of influence or care. Like I genuinely don’t care what anyone who’s not in the band thinks about the band. I mean, it’s nice that people come to see us. That’s flattering but if they didn’t come to see us, it wouldn’t change a thing about the way the band behaves.\n\nJohn Robb: So it’s in a way you’re trying to hone down your own personal perfection and in the context of those three people in the band.\n\nSteve Albini: Every, every time we start on something new, there are similar conversations about what everybody’s role should be in the piece of music. Then we just do it again and again and again. And exponentially, we all find our sea legs. Eventually, it becomes a song that we can perform in public. And then the structure of it exposes itself and we all recognise how it’s supposed to go. Very, very seldom is there any kind of an articulation, like we should do this riff precisely eight times kind of thing. I’m certain that there is some kind of internal logic that we follow without thinking about it. But for me, the important thing is that we don’t think about it.\n\nI mean, we use standard Western notation and tunings. It’s not like we have tried to reinvent music. We’re just within the vocabulary but we’re trying to do is that we are trying to stimulate ourselves. It’s great when that works and if it’s in a way that other people like then that’s very flattering. It is an extremely selfish thing that we do in the band, it’s like if I can impress Bob and Todd, then that makes me feel way better than if other people are applauding.\n\nJohn Robb: So it’s all about the room and the three players.\n\nSteve Albini: Read the room! (Laughs) but the room only has three people in it…\n\nJohn Robb: You very much have your own live setup as well. Without monitors and your own distinctive set-up.\n\nSteve Albini: These things seem like practical solutions for us. We’re a three-piece band and we play in the same physical arrangement every night on every stage no matter where it is. So if we don’t use the stage monitors, then it will sound consistent to us from night to night, whether we’re outdoors at a festival or in a small club, or on a big stage. That relationship that we have with each other and the physical geometry of it stays the same…So we never complain about the monitors because we don’t have any monitors.\n\nJohn Robb: Is it just a way of simplifying the process of being in a band and also to debunk the cliches?\n\nSteve Albini:\n\nIf it worked better for us to have monitors everywhere and have a very complex stage setup, then we would do that. But we are all interested in pursuing a minimalist approach to our music. I’ve been using the same guitar for 25 years. And Bob has been using the same bass guitar for 25 years.\n\nI think a few years ago, we bought Todd a cowbell (laughs)\n\nand I should mention this to him, but he has never added it to the drum kit (laughs).\n\nJohn Robb: Maybe at the next gig broach the subject?\n\nSteve Albini: I remember we had a whole conversation about it. Maybe we should get a cowbell. We have a rule in the band that if you’re driving, then you run the radio, right? So if a song starts with cowbell, you’re obliged to turn it up. Because the cowbell intro is one of the defining characteristics of a great rock song. There are so many great rock songs that have a cowbell beginning.\n\nThis rule has only been fooled once. There was a horrible band from the late 70s called Loverboy and they had a song called ‘Everybody’s Working For The Weekend.\n\nIt starts with what we thought was a cowbell. So we had to turn the radio up. Turns out wasn’t a cowbell at all. It was the metronome turned up so, thankfully, the paradigm has not been broken. (Laughs) so Everybody’s Working For The Weekend still does not defeat Mississippi Queen!\n\nJohn Robb: To me, the very music you write with Shellac seems to be designed to totally suit your recording technique.\n\nSteve Albini: It isn’t and I think that’s another cultural difference between your experience with music in the UK and my experience of music in the USA.\n\nFor the records are signposts along the way but the real band is us playing together whether in rehearsal or on stage. That’s what we think of when we think of the band. It’s nice to do records because then you have something that you can refer to about a certain era of the band or certain frame of mind, you were in at one point.\n\nBut the records are not the end result. The records are not the final product.\n\nThe final product is the long arc of the band. It’s like all the people that we meet along the way, all the bands that we play with, all the dinners that we have, all the road trips, all the arguments that we have and then resolve. That’s what is important to us in the band. I take the recordings seriously of course. It’s my profession and I want to do a good job. But the recordings are not the band, the recordings are just an indication of the band .\n\nJohn Robb: A snapshot of the moment?\n\nSteve Albini: I think this is true because of the many conversations that I have had with so many English people. English people do genuinely see records as the end result of music and might be because the music scene in England is part of a smaller population that has a greater level of stardom within the general public than in America.\n\nIn America is a rock band is not a lot different from being in an amateur sports team! Very few amateur sports teams have celebrities, and as a result, you might be known in your neighbourhood or you might get a free drink at the bar or whatever but the notion of general stardom just didn’t exist in amateur sports or in the music scene in America. It happens occasionally by accident, but it was generally for people that were more in the manufactured pop music scene and not coming out of the working band environment that was we were from.\n\nJohn Robb: Finally let’s talk about your success in poker…\n\nSteve Albini: Well, last year, I won a bracelet, which is what they have instead of a trophy at the World Series of Poker. If you win an event, they give you a bracelet – so they’re called bracelet events, and I won a bracelet in seven card stud at the World Series of Poker last year. It sounds like a bigger deal than it is because, over the course of the summer, they have sixty-plus of these tournaments. Winning one of them is great, of course, there’s a lot of money at stake and you get a bracelet and it feels like an accomplishment. But there are a lot of people that do it every year. So I’m it’s not like I’m the one guy that won a bracelet last year, I’m one of several dozen people that won bracelets last year. But it was quite gratifying because I’ve played poker most of my life. I find that as a game, it is immensely fascinating. It’s just as I described it once – like chess but if the chess pieces themselves are money. So every time you capture a rook, it’s like, ah ha, kerr-ching!\n\nThere is something about poker that is like solving a puzzle to me. It seems like a very internal process to figure out what I should do in a certain situation. I have some friends who are professional poker players and who do nothing else with their time. Those people are extremely competitive, not just in poker, but in other aspects of their life. They want to win. They want to beat somebody else. They want to be the one guy that solves a problem and gets the reward. I’ve never felt like that because I’ve never been a competitive person. I have played on a baseball team but it’s never bothered me to lose. I’ve never felt like, that that much elation when I win. I am just not a competitive person. So I do honestly wonder why I do it but then I remember that you get paid.\n\nThen my questions are all answered right there. I’m doing it for the money. It might be the only thing in my life that I do, primarily for the money!\n\nJohn Robb: I’m kind of making a little sketchy guess here but the way that you approach music – is it similar to the way you play poker?\n\nSteve Albini: If there is any connection between poker and the rest of my life, I don’t know what it is. I would have to say, off the top of my head. I would say no, there’s nothing alike. There are these little segmented areas of my life that I take quite seriously. You know, being in a band working, being in Sri Lanka or working on Shellac’s music, running the business of the recording studio and being a recording engineer working on other people’s records. These are a very specific area of my life and playing cards is another very specific space. It’s a sometimes intense and quite serious area of my life, but it’s quite separate from all of these other areas. Like we have a very productive garden at my house and I’m very much enjoying cooking for my wife. So my enthusiasm for cooking is another area which I take it quite seriously and I really enjoy it.\n\nI get a lot of satisfaction out of it but I don’t think it has any relationship to these other things and I don’t think poker has any relationship to the other things.\n\nAnd the music is the same.\n\nWe have a small favour to ask.
