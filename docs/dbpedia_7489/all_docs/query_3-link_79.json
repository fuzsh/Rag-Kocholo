        "meta_description": "Slint is an Open Source GUI toolkit for Desktop and Embedded. It is written in Rust, and comes with a declarative UI description language that compiles into native Rust code. We will present Slint and show how you can build an reactive GUI in Rust One of the question that often comes out is \"Are We GUI Yet?\". i.e. can you use Rust to create user interfaces? Our answer to that question is \"Yes, with Slint\" Slint is an Open Source GUI toolkit. It scales from desktop platforms all the way down to micro controllers with only a couple of hundred of KB of RAM. Thanks to the great tooling around Rust, it is also really easy to build a UI that can run on multiple different platform: Desktop native UI, wasm in the browser, or MCUs. This presentation will be a presentation of Slint, demonstrating what you can do with it and how to use it.",
