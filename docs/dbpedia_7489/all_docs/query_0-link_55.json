        "text": "“Hardcore is all about the message, and Bristol’s Svalbard lays its message with all the fury its members can muster. Largely considered controversial, awkward to some and powerful to others, the four-piece forgoes poetry for passion in some of the rawest and most in-your-face lyrical attacks.” Hard on the outside, soft on the inside.\n\n“Don’t let anyone tell you different, metal is funâwell, except for all the times when it isn’t. But even when it is fun, many metal genres have a hard time achieving the same kind of raw joviality that their cousins in the punk space can. Good ol’ heavy metal and thrash make a good playâthey share roots after all. But when it comes to yelling playfully in a mix with less of a regard for tonality and more of a focus on blasting a message out with volume as a guide, punk’s got an edge that’s hard to match. Kambodsja knows this, and they play the game well, slowly manipulating their exact style over the course of the past couple decades.” Be loud.\n\n“Power. No, not power in the flamboyant nature of a curl-adorned Italian cosplayer wielding sword to fire-breathing dragon. Power. The fast-twitch response to anticipating joints bearing weighted-iron that engorges relaxed fibers with blood, with breathâthis is where Harmâs Way lives. Straight-edge, hardcore, beatdown, just a few of the words that explain Chicagoâs own and their method of compressed and concerted attack.” In gainz way.\n\n“Here we are again strung upon KEN mode’s newest, fresh-faced outing, VOIDâwell, as fresh a face as these Canucks can muster. NULL’s intense and twisted Red Demon has fractured into a split visage of terrified sadness and caved-in confidence. Though KEN mode has little to fret over in the performance realm, the returning four-piece lineup boasting some of the most diverse and rich talents of the band’s career, a troubled mind, this demon state, does not find solace through notes of proficiency and creativity.” Face of things to come.\n\n“I like metal to have an emotional heart to it. By this, I mean that, when I’m listening to a record, I want to feel that a band has poured some of itself into the music. Now, I get this is not for everyone and there is undoubtedly a place for straightforward riffs that one can just switch off and headbang to. That is not A Feast for Sorrow, the sophomore album from UK trio Urne, a band Metal Archives wholly inaccurately brands as “Stoner/Sludge Metal/Metalcore.”” Sorrow as fuel, pain as inspiration.\n\n“Grant the Sun at surface appears as Norwayâs newest metal jam band export, crossing ears with sounds that conjure the one-off twangy dream of Graviton or the chug-n-swell maestros Russian Circles. Reaching equally to a shoegaze fizzle (âMariana,â “Vertigo”) and modern prog syncopation (“Machina,” “Hits like a Wave”), Grant the Sun brings many flavors to the table.” Panda Express.\n\n“Unfurl adhere to the school of postsâpost-grind, post-death, post-hardcoreâthat also gives us such bands as Full of Hell and Wake, and Ascension is their third full-length LP. Grindcore is the base of their sound, but these knotted compositions can suddenly swerve into sludgy doom trudges or ethereal clean flourishes on a dime. A handful of genres can be heard at any given time, but Ascension is really a tale of two albums.” Fly the flag of grind.\n\n“Despite a nagging sense that sludge, particularly of the progressive variety, has probably peaked for 2023, here I am, taking in another fetid puddle of progressive sludge, just in case I’m wrong. You never know, could happen. Denver, Colorado trio Vexing has been around since 2017, with only a demo and 2020 EP Cradle to its name. Now, however, the band is ready to drop its debut LP on a suspecting public. Suspecting because if you brand something as “progressive sludge,” it engenders certain expectations. Can Vexing confound these preconceptions on Grand Reproach?” Vex mix.\n\n“Just look at that cover! I didnât quite care what it ended up being when I saw that brazenly bright, composite-faced figure with its many mouths open in… anguish? Excitement? Both? Of course, I knew it had to foreshadow noise to some degreeâsomething so frighteningly stitched could only be the result of frequencies scraping the boundary between pique and pleasure.” Horse show."
