        "text": "Reviews for the reunion shows from legendary post-rock act Slint haven’t always been glowing. Reports of back-turned performances and other elements of barely-there stage presence hit the web after many shows. But then, what had people been expecting? Were they throwing on Spiderland during a dance party? Listening to Tweez on a sunny Sunday afternoon? In my experience (and I highly doubt I’m alone here), Slint is a band for dusk, for contemplative times, for sitting in an old chair under a lamp as the rain spits at the nearby window.\n\nSo there was nothing surprising to me about the fact that the sold-out Chicago stop of their latest reunion tour was held in a large, dark room, the stage lit by eerie red spotlights. Vocalist/guitarist Brian McMahan stood to one side, facing the other, either behind or nearly behind a large hanging column of speakers. The other band members lingered largely near the back of the stage, making only very small movements. Though the audience roared wildly as they first entered the stage, any recognition of this applause was minimal enough not to be noticed from my vantage point.\n\nBut then they drifted into the brooding “For Dinner…” and the experience immediately locked into sync with that of a rainy evening. Every note and moment of “Nosferatu Man” ached like it does on Spiderland, from McMahan’s menace (“I set a fire burning/ And I railed on through the night”), Dave Pajo’s harmonic guitar, and Britt Walford’s shuddering percussion. The shout of “You guys sound just like Slint!” from the crowd near the show’s middle wasn’t off-base in the least. Later, during the concussive “Good Morning, Captain”, the catharsis was there even if the band wasn’t stalking the stage and gesticulating wildly as many others producing this sort of grand, propulsive darkness would. Their evocative music is the kind that makes the room fall away, richly enveloping the moment so that the circumstances around it begin to fade. McMahan standing, perhaps rocking a bit on his heels, bathed in red light, was the only proper visual accompaniment to the entrancing, meteoric “Breadcrumb Trail”.\n\nRelated Video\n\nOn the swirling “Don, Aman”, the stage setup changed some, as Walford left his kit, grabbed a guitar, and came to the fore. He sat on one stool, Pajo on another a few feet away, the two facing each other, their storm front guitar figures intricately interlocked. That this intimate, nuanced, technically astonishing (yet physically still) moment was the night’s most visually engaging shouldn’t make the show a disappointment. And to judge by the mystified crowd spilling out of the venue after a brief encore of semi-unreleased “Pam” and Tweez highlight “Rhoda”, few found it to be."
