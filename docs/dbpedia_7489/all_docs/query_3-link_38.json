        "text": "Willamette Week: Can you remember hearing Slint for the first time?\n\nLance Bangs: In the spring of 1991 I rode in a van with bandmates from Athens, Ga., to Asheville, N.C., where an artist named Pattiy Torno had opened an all-ages venue called Squashpile. The sun had set as we carved through the mountains down to a warehouse near a river bend, and walked into this underground outpost. Spiderland was playing from a record player through the PA of the empty room, and combined with everything in the atmosphere around us, it was immediately captivating.\n\nWhat was it about Slint that made you spend 23 years assembling a documentary on them?\n\nThere was a complete lack of information when I was first fascinated by the music. No band name or album title on the front, just a cryptic black-and-white photo; music that sounded way more elaborately finessed than traditional bass/guitar/drums music coming out at that time on the same labels; a band that had broken up before releasing the album with no tours, photo shoots, magazine interviews or videos circulating. I was traveling regularly from Athens to other music scenes around the country and began specifically driving to Louisville to try asking around about who had made this album and why they werenât still active.\n\nThe responses sounded unbelievable, with people claiming the band had gone insane, checked into mental hospitals, could hypnotize people with their eyes, had learned how to breathe without using their mouths or noses. I began assembling stories and shooting footage in Louisville while sort of following their tracks.\n\nAt what point did you realize all that footage would go into an actual documentary?\n\nI tend to shoot continuously, so I was gathering footage without a planned end form. Mostly I collected stories and then told them to friends and other people within the circles I was travelling in. In 2005 the band assembled to perform at All Tomorrows Parties and a few other dates before dissolving again, and I was hired to direct what would have been a live DVD for Touch and Go [Records] of some shows at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco.\n\nOnce I started showing them those edits, as well as this separate footage I had been assembling, I was able to convince them to begin giving their first interviews about everything they had been through. The documentary took form from there.\n\nBeyond Slint, the film is also about the Louisville punk scene. What made that scene special?\n\nI was based in Athens, Ga., and adored it, but felt a huge affinity for what was happening up in Louisville as well. People there were weirder and more poetic than my impression of the harsher Chicago-Minneapolis Midwest aesthetic. I made friends among bands like Rodan, Crain and the Rachels, who lived in a group house called Rocket House and would stay there or with Bob Nastanovich of Pavement, another band I was touring and filming with at the time. I would describe the overall nature of Louisville musicians as charismatic figures with complex and deep inner lives who occasionally burst out into manic behavior that unsettles outsiders.\n\nIn doing this project, what did you learn about the band that surprised you the most?\n\nThe stories about [drummer] Britt [Walford] and [singer-guitarist] Brian [McMahan] being in punk bands during the original U.S. hardcore era at ages 11 and 12 were the most surprising thing once I began conducting interviews. The photos are bonkers.\n\nThe \"mystique\" of Spiderland is a big part of Slint's appeal. Are you worried the documentary will ruin that aura?\n\nThere is a tendency of some of the members to downplay or not recognize what is singular and atypical about themselves and their music. I was worried that they might try to dissipate the mystique, and the film is full of adolescent stories and wild behavior that belie the atmosphere of the album, but I think Spiderland remains a staggering work after learning everything that is revealed in the film.\n\nWhat is Slint's legacy today, in your opinion?\n\nThey were teenagers who created their own world, and I think that excites and intrigues not only musicians but artists, writers, filmmakers and people who enjoy experiencing those works. Then they walked away, seemingly never motivated to seek personal attention for the results of their work. I admire that."
