        "text": "Hailing from Louisville, Slint has been producing rock music for almost 30 years. Their most well-known album, Spiderland, was released in 1991 and has since gained fame in the underground music scene under the post-rock genre. Despite members (Brian McMahan, on vocals Britt Walford on drums, David Pajo on guitar and Todd Brashear on bass) performing with other acts such as the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and forming new bands, Slint has come together again for a worldwide tour. The El Rey's doors open at 8pm for the 9pm show."
