It kind of looks like a \"greater-than\" symbol. It's considered the opposite or crescendo.\n\nDescant\n\nThis is a stand-out voicing in a piece of music that is usually pitched higher than the original melody. You can also think of a descant as a counter-melody. You'll commonly find descants within church melodies.\n\nDotted Half-Note\n\nAdding a dot to a note increases the value of a note by half. Therefore, a dotted half note would consist of three beats, since a natural half note consists of two beats. As the name suggests, the dotted half note looks like a traditional note with a dot next to it.\n\nDiminuendo\n\nThis is similar to decrescendo and notates a gradual decrease in volume in a piece of music. It's similar to decrescendo. It can refer to a short measure of music or the gradual decrease of volume over a full section of a song.\n\nDissonance\n\nNotes that sound as though they need resolution.

This tempo marking was used in pieces like Adagio by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\n\nHalf Step\n\nThis distance is a single semitone. For instance, the two notes C and C sharp have a half step between them. The distance between E and F is also a half step since there is no black key in between them. Moving up half a step is how one creates a chromatic scale.\n\nHambone\n\nThis is a method of using body percussion to make music. Hambone originated from the African-American style of dance called Juba. This technique uses stomping and slapping to produce rhythm and percussion.\n\nHarmony\n\nWhen two or more notes are played simultaneously.

Some songs have long introductions, like Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway to Heaven\". Today, having a long introduction is much rarer.\n\nInverted\n\nThis refers to a change in pitch based on the placement of notes usually within a chordal structure. Anything outside the tonic on the bottom of a chord is considered inverted. So, a C Major chord written as E G C or G E C would be considered an inversion.\n\nJazz\n\nThis revolutionary style of music was created in the early 20th century by African Americans.

A jig is typically in 9/8 time. A famous jig example is the Irish Kesh Jig.\n\nKey Signature\n\nA key is a family of notes that are sonically pleasing when played amongst one another. The key signature is a marking at the beginning of a staff that dictates which key is used in a piece of music. The common key signature, also called common time, is 4/4.\n\nLargo\n\nThis word means large in Italian. Largo refers to a large and slow-moving pace. One of the best examples of a largo pace is in the second movement of Dvorak's Symphony No. 9 From the New World.\n\nLatency\n\nThis is the amount of time it takes for your audio signal to convert to your interface in music production. Too much latency can cause a noticeable delay. A high-quality interface shouldn't produce excess latency.\n\nLeggato\n\nThis marking asks that a series of notes is played connected and smoothly, as opposed to distinct and disjointed. The legato marking looks as though the affected notes are tied together. Notes written in a legato can still be individually articulated.\n\nLeggiero\n\nLeggiero is Italian for lightly. The term instructs musicians to play lightly and without force. It's often implied that the dynamics of a leggier piece are piano or mezzo.\n\nLeitmotif\n\nA short, repeated musical phrase that serves as a driving force throughout a piece of music.

Examples include \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\".\n\nLedger Line\n\nThis is a line that's added below or above a musical staff to notate a particularly high or low note. It appears as a line that's separated from the staff. Blank lines are also displayed so the musician can figure out exactly where a note resides.\n\nMIDI\n\nMIDI stands for musical instrument digital interface . This type of communication in music production allows the producer to communicate directly to a DAW through a hardware piece like a controller. Some examples of popular MIDI controllers include the AKAI MPK Mini or the Ableton Push.\n\nMajor\n\nMajor keys and chords typically have a happier, resonant sound. An easy example of a major scale is C Major which consists of all white notes on the piano -- C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. The formula of a major scale is a whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, whole step, and finally half step.\n\nMastering\n\nAudio mastering is the final stage in the music production process and helps bring out the best dynamics for a piece of music's intended playback location. During the mastering process, a final mix is compressed according to desired playback outputs. This can be done through an audio engineer or using Emastered's powerful algorithm .\n\nMeasure\n\nA measure refers to a contained section within a piece of written music. It contains a certain amount of beats which is determined by a song's key signature. The beat contained within a measure is determined by the key signature.\n\nMelodic Motif\n\nA melodic motif is a repeated theme throughout a piece of music. Motifs are often in the chorus, but they don't necessarily have to be. The opening four notes of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony are a great example of a melodic motif.\n\nMelodic Shape\n\nThis is the arc or shape of notes created by a musical phrase. A contoured melodic shape helps create more memorable melodies throughout a piece of music. You can describe a song's melodic shape by looking at the movement across a musical phrase.\n\nMeter\n\nMeter refers to the patterns of rhythm repeated throughout a composition. Some types of meters include duple or triple. The main two subsets of a meter are simple and compound.\n\nMezzo\n\nMezzo means \"medium\" in Italian.

It can also refer to dynamics with a term like mezzo forte.\n\nMinor\n\nA minor scale, key or chorus typically has a sadder sound as opposed to major tone quality. Minor keys are notated with a lowercase m or Roman numeral. The most simple minor scale is A minor, which consists of all of the white keys: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.\n\nMinuet\n\nThis is a type of dance that has three beats per measure. Minuets often have two different sections which originate from ballroom dancing. This style of music utilizes the time signatures 3/4 and 3/8.\n\nMixing\n\nMixing is an important part of the music production process. This occurs before mastering and helps balance out the levels of instruments and other voicings in a track. In order to mix properly, it's important to properly record musical elements since every production stage builds off of the former.\n\nModerato\n\nThis tempo marking conveys a medium or moderate speed. The term is largely ambiguous and open to interpretation per the conductor. Generally speaking, it's faster than mandate but slower than allegretto.\n\nMonophonic\n\nMonophonic refers to a single voicing in a piece of music as opposed to multiple voices conveyed in polyphonic music. This could also be a song made up of just a solo singer. Folk songs are often monophonic since they were traditionally passed down manually from one generation to the next.\n\nNatural\n\nThis sign cancels out a sharp or flat notated in a key signature temporarily. It has a distinct sign and appears to the left of the note it's affecting. The natural cancels any previous accidentals, in other words.\n\nNeoclassical\n\nThis is a style of music that fused together classical music and baroque music in the 20th century. This movement sought to restore the traditional, classical structure. Some famous neoclassical composers include Arthur Berger and Aaron Copland.\n\nNocturne\n\nThis is a type of musical piece that is characteristically quiet and reflective. Nocturnes are typically performed on piano. A famous nocturne example is Chopin's Nocturnes, Op. 9 .\n\nNotes\n\nThese are symbols that represent sound each holding different time values. You'll find different types of notes like quarter notes, whole notes, half notes, and eight notes which each represent a different time value. Solid colored verses open notes also hold different values.\n\nOctave\n\nThe distance between two of the same note at higher or lower frequencies. An octave consists of the distance of eight notes. So, a C4 and C5 note are an octave apart.\n\nOpera\n\nThis is a type of theatrical genre where music is performed and continuous throughout. It's a subset of classical music. Some of the most famous operas include Giulio Cesare and L'Orfeo.\n\nOpus\n\nA term used to categorize a composer's works.

An ostinato is similar to a musical motif, though it's usually repeated in the exact same voicing as its original introduction. This phrase is usually short and repeated throughout a piece of music.\n\nPan\n\nPanning refers to the position of a particular sound on the left and right sides of the stereo field. Producers can automate the pan placement of various musical elements to create a more dynamic song. It's also why you might not hear all instrument parts if you were to take out a single earbud while listening to a piece of music.\n\nPentatonic\n\nThis five-note scale adopted from Eastern music is seen all throughout western music today. It utilizes 5 notes. In F# Major, the pentatonic scale rests on the same notes as the black keys on the piano. Therefore, the F# Major pentatonic scale is F#, G#, A#, and D#.\n\nPercussion Family\n\nInstruments that produce sound from being struck. Some examples include drums, xylophones, gong, or a piano. You can find hundreds of individual instruments within the percussion family, though only about ten or twenty are frequently used in percussion.\n\nPhrase\n\nA musical phrase is a sonic thought or sentence. Sometimes, phrase markings are written into a piece of music to help direct the flow of the composition. Typically, a musical phrase has a distinct arc and starts on the tonic note of a piece, though this isn't a hard and fast rule.\n\nPianissimo\n\nThis dynamic marking means \"very soft\". The dynamic marking is showcased as pp in a piece of music. It's the opposite of fortissimo.\n\nPiano\n\nThis is the Italian dynamic marking that means \"soft\".

There are also more precise pitches in between each of these base notes.\n\nPizzicato\n\nA compositional marking that asks string players to pluck their instruments. This makes the string players pluck the instrument with their hands rather than using a bow. It is notated as pizz in a piece of music.\n\nPoco a Poco\n\nThis means \"little-by-little\". It commands a gradual transition within a piece of music. Poco a poco could describe just about any compositional direction and is notated as poco in compositions.\n\nPolyphony\n\nPolyphony refers to multiple voices. This is in contrast to a monophonic piece of music, where there is only one voicing. For instance, a piece with polyphony will have parts written for alto and soprano simultaneously.\n\nPolyrhythm\n\nThis is when multiple rhythms are played simultaneously. It is also called cross-rhythm. These complicated beats are usually found in Jazz music.\n\nPresto\n\nThis tempo marking means \"fast\". It is usually placed in music with a fast, upbeat tempo. One example of composition played in this manner is the famous \"Flight of the Bumblebee\".\n\nQuintuplet\n\nA rhythmic notation that asks for the musician to play five notes in the space that a quarter note usually occupies. This is a grouping of five sixteenth notes. This can exist in both simple and compound meters.\n\nRagtime\n\nThis 19th-century music style is defined by highly syncopated melodies. It peaked in popularity between 1895 and 1919. One example of ragtime music is The Entertainer by Scott Joplin.\n\nRallentando\n\nThis is an instruction to gradually play slower. It literally means \"to relax\". It is similar to ritardando but technically different.\n\nRange\n\nThis refers to the distance between a singer or instrumentalist's lowest and highest possible notes. Altos, sopranos, tenors, and bass voicing all have different ranges. Musicians with greater range can perform a larger amount of songs.\n\nRefrain\n\nA repeated section in a piece of music. The refrain is often in the chorus, but it doesn't necessarily have to adhere to this rule. In Latin, this term means \"to repeat\".\n\nRest\n\nA marking used to notate space where music isn't being played within a composition. Rests have different values, just like notes. They have their own marking and also rely on the time signature for value.\n\nReverb\n\nAn echo-like effect caused by sound reflections against surfaces. Reverb is one of the most commonly used effects within a DAW. There are also several different types of reverb including hall reverb and plate reverb.\n\nRhapsody\n\nAn epic, typically long recitation of music or a poem. Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" encompasses this definition to a T. Rhapsodies don't necessarily need a typical strong structure since they are essentially poems set to music.\n\nRhythm\n\nAn organization of the strong and weak beats throughout a piece of music. This is one of the main elements of music. Different types of genres showcase various rhythms.\n\nRitardando\n\nThe gradual slowing of a piece of music.

This music started as monophonic in the 13th century but evolved to polyphonic in the 14th. You might recognize the rondo “Fur Elise” by Beethoven.\n\nRubato\n\nTempo marking allows a conductor to temporarily stray away from the piece's parent tempo. This provides variation from one performance to the next. One example of Rubato is Chopin's Nocturne in B Flat Minor, Op. 9.\n\nSampler\n\nAn electronic instrument that's used to process small pieces of audio. This can be a hardware instrument or an electronic component within your DAW. Samplers process audio to create a flipped version of something in music production.\n\nScale\n\nA sequence of notes within the same sonic family. Major and minor scales have radically different sounds. For instance, the C major scale and A minor scale sound radically different despite using the exact same notes.\n\nScore\n\nThe notation of a full composition. A score is often used to describe music written for film. However, in musical terms, it's simply the full notated body of work.\n\nSequence\n\nA pattern where a melody is played at a higher or lower pitch. A sequence is important since context matters in music. Our ears perceive sounds differently based on what was played before it and what comes after it.\n\nSharp\n\nA notation that raises a note up a semitone. Sharps are notated by a hashtag on the left side of the note. A C sharp note is higher than a C note.\n\nSlur\n\nTo blend multiple notes together. The symbol of a slur is tied over the tops of the slurred notes.

Similar to written composition, themes often showcase the main idea of a song.\n\nTimbre\n\nTimbre describes tone quality, or how one pitch could be distinguished from another. It's also known as tone color. Every instrument has its own timbre that sets it apart from other musical instruments.\n\nTime Signature\n\nThe time signature determines how many beats per measure exist within any musical composition. It consists of two numbers stacked on top of each other. Common time signatures include 4/4, 3/4, and 6/8.\n\nToccata\n\nThis is a composition intended for a very skilled musician or virtuoso. Toccatas are meant to demonstrate technical excellence. They include elements like high harmonies and quick runs.\n\nTonality\n\nThis describes the characterization of any particular pitch. It helps describe the relationship between keys, notes, and chords. Tonal music has a specific home key as opposed to atonal music.\n\nTonic\n\nThis is the first note or parent note of any particular scale. It's the strongest note within a scale and all other chords or melodies are built off of it. The tonic is considered \"home-base\" within a key.\n\nTreble Clef\n\nThis is the clef most used in traditional notation. The treble clef located the G note on the second-lowest line of the staff. Like other clefs, the treble clef can be found on the far left of the staff.\n\nTremelo\n\nThis is when a musician quickly repeats a single note. The fast reputation produces a shaking effect.

Some famous trios include Nirvana or The Beastie Boys.\n\nTutti\n\nTutti is the Italian word for \"all\". Therefore, a tutti section in music is defined by the entire instrument section joining in simultaneously. In most cases, \"Tutti\" refers to the whole orchestra playing rather than just isolated instruments.\n\nTwo-Part Songs\n\nA song that has two distinct sections, sometimes with different keys or time signatures. One such song structure is verse-chorus form. \"Superstition\" by Stevie Wonder is an example of a two-part song.\n\nUnison\n\nUnison is when all instrumentalists or vocalists sing the same melody simultaneously. Often, chorus sections of songs are played in unison. Whenever everyone is singing or playing the same part, they are performing in unison.\n\nVST\n\nVST stands for virtual technology. This can refer to any third-party virtual plugin used when operating a digital audio workstation, or DAW. VSTs can be effect plugins, separate instruments, or even MIDI patterns.\n\nVerse\n\nSong verses serve as the main idea of a song, furthering the track's narrative. It is usually placed in between chorus sections. The verses are usually the longest section of songs and rely on the lyrics for momentum.\n\nVerse-chorus\n\nWhile verses and choruses are entirely different, verse-chorus refers to a particular type of song structure. This is also known as a two-part song. One example of a verse-chorus composition would be Tracy Chapman's \"Fast Car\".\n\nVibrato\n\nThis refers to a slight variation in pitch, sometimes deliberately applied to produce a certain sonic experience.
