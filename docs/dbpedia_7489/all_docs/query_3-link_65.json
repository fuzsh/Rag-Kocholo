        "text": "Slint has been around for ages, and I've definitely followed their career, but I didn't get to see them live until recently. I started dating this guy who also really loved them, and we decided that we absolutely had to see them together. They were incredible performers. I felt kind of stupid actually for waiting to see them so long. What was I thinking?\n\nThey are really talented, intense and thoughtful performers. The best moments for me during the show wasn't when they were singing a few of their faster tempo songs, it was when they slowed it down for us and got intimate. My boyfriend and I were in a pretty big crowd, but it was during these moments that I felt the most connected to the band, even though we were kind of far in the back.\n\nI was really happy I got to see their show with someone so special to me and someone who was so interested in their music and what they had to offer. My favorite song by them is \"Washer,\" and I was so excited to hear them perform it. The whole crowd was silent like we all didn't want to interrupt lead singer Brian McMahan's performance. We just wanted to experience the raw, pure power of his voice.\n\nIt was so amazing, and I'm happy I got to see a band that doesn't rely on gimmicks. They trust themselves to produce good music, and they trust the audience to really appreciate that.\n\nRead more"
