        "text": "World’s Appreciated Kitsch & Silent Call Collective present a (post) hardcore evening\n\nSQUINT (post-hardcore / alternative rock, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) *Exclusive Dutch show*\n\nSquint is a band from St. Louis, Missouri. Established in 2022, the band consists of Brennen Wilkinson (vocals), Ian O’Leary (guitar), David Shanle (guitar), Jake Lindsay (bass), and Wil McCarthy (drums). Together, they bring a fresh, authentic take on hardcore, drawing inspiration from 90s hardcore, punk, Brit Pop, and grunge, creating a sound uniquely their own.\n\nSquint made their debut with the EP “Feel It” in April 2022, released via Sunday Drive Records. This EP showcased their distinct blend of influences and undeniable talent. Following this success, Squint solidified their presence with their second EP “Wash Away” in November 2022. These two EPs laid the foundation for “Feel It All Wash Away,” released in 2023, all under the banner of Sunday Drive Records.\n\nThe band enters the studio in November 2023 with renowned producer Jon Markson, known for his work with Drug Church, Taking Meds, and Koyo. This marks a significant step in the band’s journey as they craft their debut LP, promising an authentic musical experience that will resonate with a wide audience.\n\nSquint’s musical style draws from a diverse range of inspirations. Rooted in 90s hardcore and alternative rock, their music reflects elements of Everclear, Superchunk, and Archers of Loaf. The Squint sound incorporates McCarthy’s powerful drumming alongside O’Leary and Shanle’s driving, melodic guitar riffs. Lindsay’s bass flushes out the low-end. Wilkinson’s abrasive, yet melodic vocals add a unique energy, influenced by bands like Sugar, Turning Point, and Fucked Up.\n\nSquint is at the forefront of a new wave of hardcore bands poised to break into the mainstream, akin to trailblazers like Drug Church, Militarie Gun, Scowl, and Turnstile. Their music’s raw intensity and profound lyrics connect with audiences, positioning Squint as a rising star in hardcore.\n\nIn an era where the hardcore genre is growing and evolving, Squint stands as a testament to its enduring power. With their dedication to their craft and a sound that resonates across generations, Squint is poised to make a lasting impact on the hardcore scene and beyond. Keep an eye on Squint; their musical journey is just beginning.\n\nhttps://squintstl.bandcamp.com\n\nFEVERCHILD (post-hardcore / emo, Ghent, Belgium)\n\nFeverchild sounds like it came out in the mid–late ’90s, during the boom of post-hardcore and emo bands. As common as this phrase is, rarely does it accurately describe new music, it’s sort of an easy, go-to reference, but that’s not the case for Feverchild. Their music literally sounds like it came out in the ’90s and you probably wouldn’t be able to tell otherwise. Once you look a little more into the band though, it begins to make sense how the bands perfectly captured this era.\n\nMany members of Feverchild came from other Belgium hardcore bands, like Minded Fury, Force, and Animal Club, plus their records was recorded and produced by Oathbreaker’s, Gilles Demolder. With this foundation in hardcore—like most bands of that era (Texas Is The Reason, Far Apart, Sunny Day Real Estate, etc.)—and a strong love for the genre, Feverchild’s music is full of clean/heavy guitars and catchy vocal melodies that easily get stuck in your head.\n\nFeverchild seemed to have mastered their sound of late 90’s post-hardcore/emo on their latest and most thorough release yet, “Altering a Memory”. Following a self-titled EP and two-song single (the latter appearing on this album) in addition to their first tour, the band is at their strongest yet. “Altering a Memory” is primarily driven by melody—something the band has always incorporated, but now more attentive to. The intro track and “Eva” show the band stripping away some of the abrasiveness of their sound, and pull back to incorporate more quiet and atmospheric elements; ultimately creating a more diverse album where both the quiet and louder moments are more noticeable. “Altering a Memory” may be a stepping stone—not just for Feverchild—but perhaps for a new wave of emo to come.\n\nhttps://feverchildband. bandcamp.com\n\nSNAKE EATER (hardcore/punk, Netherlands)\n\nSnake Eater is here to kick colonial ass. With their brand of in-your-face grindy hardcore punk, they’re a fresh face in the scene. Consisting in part of ex-members of melodic hardcore act To Live Among Wolves, they’re here and ready to fight. Their first demo is coming soon!"
