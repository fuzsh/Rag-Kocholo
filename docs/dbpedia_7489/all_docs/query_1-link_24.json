These artists must not be given the Primary or Featured/With roles at either the album or track level unless they are also Primary or Featured/With artists on the recording.\n\nIf a track includes a sample of previously released work by an artist, credit that artist with the Sampled Artist role. Do not credit sampled artists as a Primary or Featured artist unless obligated by the rights holder.\n\nNon-performing presenting artists must only be named in the title and not marked as Primary artists.

(Primary)\n\nTrack Title\n\nCold Summer (Young Jeezy Presents U.S.D.A.)\n\n2.15. Composition and Lyrics. Roles related to the underlying composition or lyrical content of a recording must have the appropriate roles listed at the track level. If a single artist has written all words or lyrics for all recordings on an album, the appropriate roles must be listed at both the album and track levels. If an artist is also a composer, credit them with the Composer role as well.\n\nIf the album contains selections of unknown authorship, such as a folk song or Gregorian chant, use Anonymous or Traditional as the composer. Any delivery found using this role erroneously will be hidden.\n\n2.16. Production and Engineering. Roles such as Producer, Recording Engineer, or Graphic Designer must be credited at the album level if consistent throughout the album. Otherwise, note these contributors at the track level. These artists must not be marked as the Primary artist at either the album or track level.\n\n2.17. Administrative.

If multiple versions of an album exist, use the album title version to indicate the correct version.\n\nIf an album offers more content than the standard version of the album (for example, extra tracks or a bonus video), indicate the difference in the title. If an audio-only version of a CD+DVD is delivered to Apple Music or iTunes, the album title must include the term “Audio Version.” An album containing only music videos needs to be labeled \"Video Album\" in the Album title version.\n\nVersion\n\nExample\n\nBonus Track Version\n\nSadecessary (Bonus Track Version)\n\nDeluxe Edition\n\nThe Endless River (Deluxe Edition)\n\nExtended Version\n\nTear the Roof Up (Extended Version)\n\nBonus Video Version\n\nMi Quimera (Bonus Video Version)\n\nBonus Digital Booklet Version\n\nFallen Leaves & Dead Sparrows (Bonus Digital Booklet Version)\n\nAudio Version\n\nCelebrate - Live At the SSE Hydro Glasgow (Audio Version)\n\nLive Video Album\n\nFolk.

Note that by delivering content using the title version field, parentheses and brackets will be applied by Apple automatically.\n\n3.7. Multiple Albums and Medley Tracks. Multiple album or track titles in the title field must be separated by a slash. Note that you must place a space before and after the slash.\n\n3.8. Formatting. Title formatting in a series should be consistent. Descriptors like Part and Volume should be abbreviated with “Pt.” and “Vol.” Titles should be formatted as “Title, Vol. x” and “Title, Pt. x,” where x is a number.\n\nAlbum Title\n\nDead Presidents, Vol. 1\n\nTrack Title\n\nThe Payback, Pt. 1\n\n3.9. Track Version Information. All track titles performed by the same artist on an album must be unique, except for different versions of the same track that are differentiated by Parental Advisory tags. To differentiate multiple versions of the same track title, use terms in parentheses or brackets such as:\n\nAlternate Take (for example, 1, 2, and so on)\n\nLive\n\nInstrumental\n\nSingle Version\n\nRadio Edit\n\nSpecial Format Mix (for example, 12“ Mix)\n\nExtended\n\nSession Date Version (for example, 1947 Version)\n\nIncomplete\n\nRehearsal\n\nBreakdown\n\nMale Version\n\nTikTok Version\n\nSped Up\n\nSlowed Down\n\nLo-Fi\n\nFor Music Videos:\n\nVisualizer\n\nLive Audio\n\nVertical\n\nLyric Video\n\nStandard spellings with no abbreviations should be used for track title version information.\n\n3.10. Rerecorded Versions. If a track is rerecorded, the track title must include “Rerecorded.” A rerecorded track may be hidden for editorial reasons if the original “hit” version is live in Apple Music or iTunes.\n\n3.11. Remastered Versions and New Mixes of Previously Released Recordings. The year of remastering should be included in the title version to properly indicate the version of the master. For example, 2017 Remastered Version. Albums or tracks that are designated as Remastered in the title version must be delivered with the first-known release date of the original version of the recording.\n\nIn cases where an entirely new mix has been created for a previously released album, the album must also be delivered with the first-known release date of the original version of the album. The year of the new mix should also be noted. For example, 2013 Mix.\n\n3.12. Soundtrack Version Information. Soundtracks and scores must include version information in the album title, enclosed in parentheses or brackets.\n\nO.S.T. abbreviation should not be used as an album or song title version for scores, movies, TV, musicals, or video games.\n\nIf the tracks are compiled from different soundtracks, each track title must indicate the soundtrack (From “Soundtrack Name”).\n\nSingles from the soundtrack should have the same album and track title in the format Track Title (From “Movie Name”).\n\nSoundtrack remixes must not include the movie title if the track is not from the original soundtrack.\n\nMusicals must reference the year and location of the performance or release. Do not use the word “Original” if the performance is not the initial staging or release of the production.\n\nAlbum Title Version\n\nExample\n\nMusic videos taken from musical films must contain a title version that refers to the film such as (From “Name of Film”).\n\nMain Title (From Game of Thrones: Season 7)\n\nMain Title (From The Wizard of Oz Soundtrack)\n\nFlying Theme (From \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial”)\n\nLuke and Leia (From \"Return of the Jedi”)\n\nFor Chinese language content, see Other Asia-Pacific Countries and Regions.\n\n3.13. DJ Mixes Version Information. DJ Mix albums must include a title version of \"DJ Mix\" in the album-level version information. Mixed tracks appearing on a DJ Mix must include the title version [Mixed] after all other version information.\n\nAlbum Title\n\nBargrooves Summer 2018 (DJ Mix)\n\nAlbum Artist\n\nJon White (Primary)\n\nTrack Title\n\nCan’t Get Enough! (Dr Packer Extended Remix) [Mixed]\n\nTrack Artist\n\nSoulsearcher (Primary)\n\nDr Packer (Remixer)\n\nEric Mathews (Composer)\n\nGary Turner (Composer)\n\nMarc Pomeroy (Composer)\n\nTrack Title\n\nCaught Up (feat. Yasmeen)\n\n[Kings of Tomorrow Remix] [Mixed]\n\nTrack Artist\n\nSonny Fodera (Primary)\n\nYasmeen (Featuring)\n\nKings of Tomorrow (Remixer)\n\nSonny Fodera (Songwriter)\n\nYasmeen Sulieman (Songwriter)\n\n3.14. Remixes Collections Version Information. Albums that are a collection of remixes of the same track must indicate this in the album title. To avoid identical track titles, the titles must include enough information about the remixes to differentiate them.\n\nIf an artist is featured on the original song, the remix should be formatted as “Title (feat. Artist) [Remix].” If an artist is not featured on the original song, the remix should be formatted as “Title (Remix) [feat. Artist].”\n\n3.15. Live Recording Version Information. If the audio is from a live recording, the title version must be indicated as “Live.” Territory-specific versions (”Ao Vivo” in Portuguese, and “En Vivo” or “En Directo” in Spanish) should be used. Do not use “Live” for Standup Comedy albums.\n\nIf the version includes time and venue, it should be formatted as Live at Place, Year/Date. For example:\n\nOne More Saturday Night (Live at Palladium, New York, 1977)\n\nOne More Saturday Night (Live at Red Rocks Amphitheater, Morrison, CO, 7/8/1978)\n\nFor music videos to be considered Live, audio and video must match and be from the same performance. Prerecorded audio set to different performance footage is not considered Live.\n\n3.16. Karaoke, Tribute, Japanese Orgel, Parody, and Ringtones. The album title must not begin with the original artist name.\n\nFor example, “Kelly Clarkson: The Bluegrass Tribute” is not an acceptable album title. Instead, format the title as “The Bluegrass Tribute to Kelly Clarkson.”\n\nTrack or ringtone titles for cover, orgel, parody songs, or tributes must not make reference to the original artist. Do not use phrases such as “Originally Performed By,” “In the Style of,” “Tribute to,” or “Cover of.”\n\nKaraoke track titles can make reference to the original artist. You must use clarifying language to ensure that consumers will not think those artists are performing. You should use phrases such as “Originally Performed By... (original artist name).”\n\nTitles of karaoke albums and tracks must indicate that they are an instrumental or karaoke version.\n\nVersion\n\nExample\n\nKaraoke Version\n\nGrenade (Karaoke Version)\n\nInstrumental Version\n\nDon’t Stop Believin’ (Instrumental Version)\n\nVersion karaoké\n\nMarguerite (Version karaoké)\n\n3.17. Silent, Hidden, and Ghost Tracks. Silent, hidden, and ghost tracks must be clearly labeled in the track title.\n\nVersion\n\nExample\n\nSilent Track\n\nOutro (Silent Track)\n\nHidden Track\n\nA Rockin' Good Way (feat. Maceo Parker) [Hidden Track]\n\nGhost Track\n\nOpen My Eyes (Ghost Track)\n\n3.18. Performance, Backing, and Split Tracks. If a track is a performance track, backing track, or split track, that information must be included in the title.\n\n3.19. Booklet Title. Digital Booklet title should follow the format: Digital Booklet - Album title.\n\nTitles\n\n11.7. Album Formatting. The album title must include the composers, followed by a colon, followed by the work titles, catalog numbers, or type of works such as Sonatas or Preludes.\n\nFollow these guidelines for composer name formatting for album titles only:\n\nLast name only. Use this format when there is only one famous composer with a surname that is immediately recognizable. For example, Beethoven, Zemlinsky, or Ligeti.\n\nFirst name initial(s) and last name. Use this format when multiple famous composers share the same last name. For example, members of the Bach family, including J. S. Bach, C. P. E. Bach, and W. F. Bach.\n\nFirst name(s) and last name(s). Use this format when multiple famous composers share the same initials and the same last name. For example, Paul Viardot and Pauline Viardot. Felix Mendelssohn and Fanny Mendelssohn.\n\nExamples:\n\nMonteverdi: Vespro della Beata Vergine, SV 206\n\nJ. S. Bach: Jesu, meine Freude, BWV 227 – Vivaldi: Gloria in D Major, RV 589\n\nHaydn: Complete Symphonies, Vol. 1\n\nW. A. Mozart: Requiem in D Minor, K. 626\n\nBeethoven: Violin Concerto in D Major, Op. 61 – Brahms: Symphony No. 1, Op. 68\n\nSchubert & R. Schumann: Piano Sonatas\n\nChopin: Preludes & Nocturnes\n\nTchaikovsky: The Nutcracker & Swan Lake (Highlights)\n\nStravinsky: Le sacre du printemps\n\nBritten: Choral Works\n\nIf an album is composed and performed entirely by the same artist, the composer does not need to be included in the album title.\n\nDo not use side-by-side translations in metadata. Use only one language in each entry or localization. If an album has an exact release title, such as The Most Beloved Classical Masterworks, that title may be used.\n\n11.8. Key Information. A work must be described in the key it was composed in. Formatting should look like: C-Sharp Major.\n\n11.9. Classical Abbreviations. For accepted abbreviations of catalogs of classical works, see Standard Classical Abbreviations.\n\n11.10. Track Formatting. Track titles must be complete, correctly formatted, and consistent.\n\nIf a track features a movement or selection from a larger work like a symphony or concerto, begin the track title with the name of the larger work. This applies even if a track contains a portion of a movement, selection, or excerpt. In this case, “Selection” or “Excerpt” must be stated between parentheses at the end of the work title.\n\nIf a work has an assigned catalog number, include the catalog number in the title. Catalog numbers can be found through the International Music Score Library Project.\n\nFor works comprising movements, such as Symphonies, Concertos, and Sonatas, use Roman numerals. For example, I. Allegro, and II. Adagio. For works comprising numbers, such as Songs and Oratorios, and numbered sets of pieces, such as 6 Lieder or 3 Morceaux, use Arabic numbers. For example, No. 1, Wiegenlied and No. 2, In der Campagna.\n\nExample: Movement Formatting\n\nExample: Extended Movement Formatting\n\nExample: Song Cycle Formatting\n\nExample: Set Formatting\n\nExample: Accommodating Multiple Numbering Systems\n\nWhere works are numbered chronologically and by individual Opus groups, they should be formatted as follows:\n\nNocturne No. 17 in B Major, Op. 62 No. 1. Andante\n\nThe example above shows the first of Chopin’s 2 Nocturnes, Op. 62, which is also listed as Chopin’s Nocturne No. 17.\n\nExample: Multi-level works\n\nExamples:\n\nKeyboard Concerto No. 5 in F Minor, BWV 1056: III.

Opera Formatting. The track title for a selection from an opera must be consistent and start with the name of the opera, followed by a colon, followed by the selection title. For recordings of a complete opera, include act and scene information after the opera title but before the colon and selection title. Exemptions to this rule include operas that have one scene per act, such as Tosca, operas that are divided into scenes but not acts, such as Das Rheingold, or one-act operas that are through-composed, such as Salome. For example:\n\nOpera Selection Titles:\n\nDon Giovanni, K. 527: Il mio tesoro\n\nLa traviata: Libiamo, libiamo… (“Brindisi”)\n\nTosca: Vissi d’arte\n\nComplete Opera Titles:\n\nFalstaff, Act III Scene 2: Un poco di pausa\n\nFalstaff, Act III Scene 2: Ogni sorta di gente dozzinale\n\nFalstaff, Act III Scene 2: Tutto nel mondo è burla\n\nIf an album of opera selections includes character information for one title, the information must be included for all other titles. For example:\n\nLa bohème, Act II: Quando m'en vo (Musetta)\n\nTurandot, Act III: Nessun dorma (Calaf)\n\nThe Magic Flute, K. 620, Act II: O Isis und Osiris (Sarastro und Chor)\n\nA Midsummer Night's Dream, Op. 64: Now until the Break of Day (Oberon, Tytania, Puck, Fairies)\n\nExample: Opera Formatting\n\n11.12. Classical Crossover Formatting. Track titles for Classical Crossover genre content can start with the selection, movement, or popular title of a work. Major work titles and catalog numbers must still be included but may be presented at the end of the title within parentheses. Only use this relaxed formatting on classical-crossover albums.\n\nExamples:\n\nDance of the Sugar Plum Fairy (From “The Nutcracker”, Op. 71)\n\nEine kleine Nachtmusik (First movement from Serenade in G Major, K. 525)\n\nNessun dorma (From the Opera “Turandot”)\n\nFlight of the Bumblebee (From the Opera “The Tale of Tsar Saltan”)\n\nMoonlight Sonata (First Movement from Piano Sonata No. 14, Op. 27 No. 2)\n\n11.13. Works. If grouping songs together as a work, such as a concerto or symphony, at least two songs must be included in the work. Do not group incomplete selections from a larger piece of music together as a work.\n\n11.14. Recording Dates. If the album or track title contains the recording date, use the following format: title, followed by the word “Recorded” and the year recorded in parentheses.\n\nExample:\n\nMozart: Die Zauberflöte, K. 620 (Recorded 1954)\n\n11.15. Versions, Arrangements, and Transcriptions. If a work has been altered from the original composition, the instrumentation must be noted and the Arranger credited at the end of the title.\n\nExamples:\n\nGianni Schicchi: O mio babbino caro (Arr. for Piano by Arthur Smith)\n\nToccata and Fugue in D Minor, BWV 565 (Transcr. for Orchestra by Leopold Stokowski)\n\nIf all movements of a work have been altered to the same instrumentation by the same arranger(s), place the information in the title after the work name before the colon and movement information.\n\nExamples:\n\nViolin Concerto No. 2 in G Minor, Op. 22 (Arr. for Piano by Georges Bizet): I. Andante sostenuto\n\nViolin Concerto No. 2 in G Minor, Op. 22 (Arr. for Piano by Georges Bizet): II. Allegro scherzando\n\nViolin Concerto No. 2 in G Minor, Op. 22 (Arr. for Piano by Georges Bizet): III. Presto\n\nExample: Versions, Arrangements, and Transcriptions Formatting\n\nExample: Versions\n\nExample for revisions:\n\nPiano Concerto No. 1 in F-Sharp Minor, Op. 1 (1965 Version): III. Allegro scherzando – Maestoso\n\nExample for alternative instrumentation by the original composer:\n\nOrchestral Suite in D Minor (Version for Piano): IV. Allegro\n\nFor transcriptions which are commonly attributed to the transcriber, list the transcriber in the Composer role. This only applies to pieces which are generally attributed to the transcriber in common usage.\n\nFor example, most Liszt transcriptions are commonly associated with Liszt rather than the original composer. For these works, Liszt must be credited in the Composer role with original composer listed in the track title.\n\nExamples:\n\nLohengrin: Elsas Brautzug zum Münster (After Richard Wagner), S. 445 - credit Franz Liszt as Composer\n\nIl Trovatore: Miserere (After Giuseppe Verdi), S. 433 - credit Franz Liszt as Composer"
