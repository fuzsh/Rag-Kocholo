        "text": "For better or worse, 2018 is a post-truth, postmodern, Post Malone kind of world. The plus side of that, however, is that the world of post-hardcore is positively thriving, and the likes of Touché Amoré and La Dispute have become some of the biggest names in the scene. Both are now signed to Epitaph Records, but those bands’ foundations – as well as those of their contemporaries and forefathers – were laid by a whole bunch of smaller labels who really helped develop and nurture the scene.\n\nAs with every genre – especially every genre with a ‘post-‘ at the front of it – there exist some loose parameters when it comes to defining exactly what post-hardcore is. More melodic and emotional than straight-up hardcore, it contains aspects of screamo and even noisecore. That said, just like that nebulous term 'emo,' the designation ‘post-hardcore’ allows for plenty of stylistic variation.\n\nIt makes sense, then, that many of the labels that helped propel post-hardcore into the wider world have diverse musical rosters – some much more so than others. But what all the labels featured here have in common is the massive impact they’ve had on the post-hardcore scene. (And yes, many of you will notice that both SST and Dischord are absent from the list below, but that’s because they’re more associated with hardcore, so we included them on this here list the last time around).\n\nNo Sleep\n\nGiven that they released the first two La Dispute full-lengths -- 2008’s highly influential Somewhere At The Bottom Of The River Between Vega And Altair and 2011’s acclaimed follow-up, Wildlife -- as well as Touché Amoré’s 2008 demo, it could be argued that no label helped shape the contemporary post-hardcore landscape more than No Sleep. Again, they’re not exclusively a post-hardcore label, and their biggest success is probably shapeshifting (anti-)pop-punks The Wonder Years. But add Xerxes (one of the most underrated bands around), Actor/Observer, and a split between Boysetsfire and UK post-hardcore heroes Funeral For A Friend into the mix, and it’s clear that No Sleep is an indispensable part of the post-hardcore world.\n\nNo Idea\n\nOne of the most intense post-hardcore acts to ever grace this planet is A Wilhelm Scream. And we can argue until the cows come home about whether the Boston band are actually a post-hardcore band, but given that the term is pretty nebulous, we’re calling it. And given the fact No Idea put out the band’s phenomenal 2013 LP, Partycrasher, the Gainesville label deserves a spot here for that reason alone. Meanwhile, No Idea has also issued records by The Bomb, the band formed by Jeff Pezzati after influential post-hardcore icons Naked Raygun called it a day; and put out the seminal first records by Planes Mistaken For Stars.\n\nDeathwish Inc\n\nCo-founded in 2000 by Jacob Bannon – of the influentially brutal Converge – Deathwish’s roots might be in pure hardcore, but it has plenty of post-hardcore notches on their metaphorical bedpost. Most important among these are Touché Amoré’s second and third records, 2011’s Parting The Sea Between Brightness And Me and 2013’s Is Survived By, as well as bunch of splits and a forthcoming live album by the band. But it’s not just Touché that gives Deathwish its post-hardcore cred – the label also put out Planes Mistaken For Stars’ phenomenal 2016 album, Prey; have issued records by Self Defense Family, Birds In Row and Frameworks; and are about to release the new album by Gouge Away.\n\nJade Tree\n\nAnother sadly defunct (well, kind of) label, Jade Tree’s entire catalog was actually purchased by punk behemoths Epitaph in 2017. As already mentioned, the label now boasts Touché Amoré and La Dispute among its ranks, and the acquisition of the Jade Tree catalog adds a whole ton of history to equation. That’s because, in addition to legendary gloomcore (we just made that up), albums by the likes of Pedro The Lion and Jets To Brazil and a stunning split between Alkaline Trio and Hot Water Music, Jade Tree’s arsenal includes Analphabetapolothology – the collected recordings of emo-cum-post-hardcore legends Cap’n Jazz – and, more to the point, the first two albums by These Arms Are Snakes, two vital and thrilling records that any fan of the genre has to have."
