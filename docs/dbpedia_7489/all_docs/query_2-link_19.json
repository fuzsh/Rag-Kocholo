        "text": "Slint was an American rock band formed in Louisville, KY in 1986. They disbanded following the recording of their second full-length album, Spiderland, in 1991. The group consisted of Brian McMahan (guitar and vocals), David Pajo (guitar), Britt Walford (drums and vocals), Todd Brashear (bass on Spiderland), and Ethan Buckler (bass on Tweez). Both McMahan and Britt Walford were members of Squirrel Bait in their teens.\n\nIn 2005, 2007 and 2014 the band reunited to play a number of live shows. On the 2007 tour dates, in addition to performing songs from Spiderland and the untitled 10\", they also debuted a new composition called \"King's Approach.\" Their 2014 tour coincided with the release of a box set compiling a remastered version of the Spiderland LP, previously unreleased studio outtakes and demos, and a new documentary film about their origins and the Louisville music scene.\n\n[]\n\nPeel first got into Slint in 1989 and played their material until the band split in 1991. The group also had an entry in the 1991 Festive Fifty, which was abandoned in that year due to not many people voting but it was revived in 1993, when the results of the 1991 Festive Fifty was broadcast playing the tracks at the rate of one per show.\n\nFestive Fifty Entries[]\n\n1991 Festive Fifty: Good Morning, Captain #23\n\nShows Played[]\n\n1989\n\n30 May 1989: Rhoda (album - Tweez) Jennifer Hartman\n\n31 May 1989: Carol (album - Tweez) Jennifer Hartman\n\n12 June 1989 (BBC World Service): Darlene (LP - Tweez) Jennifer Hartman\n\n1990\n\n07 February 1990: 'Darlene (LP-Tweez)' (Jennifer Hartman Recordings)\n\n1991\n\n17 February 1991: Nosferatu Man (Album: Spiderland) Touch And Go\n\n10 March 1991: 'Good Morning, Captain' (CD - Spiderland) Touch And Go\n\n30 March 1991: 'Nosferatu Man (LP-Spiderland)' (Touch And Go)\n\n30 March 1991 (BFBS): 'Breadcrumb Trail (LP-Spiderland)' (Touch And Go)\n\n1993\n\n10 April 1993: Good Morning, Captain (album - Spiderland) Touch And Go 1991 FF #23\n\n[]"
