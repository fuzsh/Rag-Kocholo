        "text": "Their expansive and atmospheric allure and genre-defying sound has seen UK alternative rock outfit The Silent Era quickly garner a reputation as one of the nation’s most distinctive and memorable bands. Their style encompasses industrial, goth-rock, metal, shoegaze, and post-punk to craft something that feels disconcertingly dark while having an impactful, powerful edge that is impossible to ignore.\n\nA track that perfectly illustrates their unique appeal is the single ‘Heaven//Hell’, a track that feels as calculating and intense as it does chaotic, finding a sense of duality and juxtaposition that mirrors its narrative about the struggle of discerning good from evil. The band’s entirely unique approach and enticing, captivating feel makes for a gripping and engrossing listening experience that never lets go from the moment that it starts. Anchored by the commanding vocals of Bri Macanas, The Silent Era have a one-of-a-kind appeal and daring sense of poise that promises exciting things for the future."
