        "text": "This is a list of notable musical artists who have been referred to or have had their music described as post-hardcore.\n\nPost-hardcore is a punk rock music genre that maintains the aggression and intensity of hardcore punk but emphasizes a greater degree of creative expression initially inspired by post-punk and noise rock. The genre took shape in the mid- to late 1980s with releases by bands from cities that had established hardcore scenes, such as Fugazi from Washington, D.C.,[1] as well as groups such as Big Black and Jawbox that stuck closer to post-hardcore's noise rock roots.[1]\n\nList\n\n[edit]\n\nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of emo artists\n\nList of metalcore bands\n\nList of post-punk bands\n\nList of punk bands: 0–K, L–Z\n\nList of screamo bands"
