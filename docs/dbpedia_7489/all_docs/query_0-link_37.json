        "text": "Written by Jesse Smith\n\nIt is no secret that I live and die in 2009-2014 Metalcore. I found this scene when I was just going into my teens and was really struggling to make friends. Metalcore music hit me like no other music genre ever did. Sure I was a fan of the mid 2000’s pop punk but who wasn’t? As soon as I emerged myself in the music I knew that it was not only something I wanted to be a part of but it was something that I have loved since then. Throughout the years we’ve seen bands come and go, rise and fall, and some really never get the notice or recognition that I feel they deserved. Most of these bands got signed yes, most toured the world yes, but what they all have in common was that they never got to where I felt they should be and been. Here are 7 Metalcore/Post Hardcore bands that should have been bigger.\n\n1. The Air I Breathe\n\nThe Air I Breathe was a progressive metalcore band unlike any other. Seriously, even now I haven’t found a band like them. This New Jersey based band signed to Rise Records and put out their debut album “Great Faith In Fools” Which was something so new that no one saw it coming. Having the incredible balance of lightning fast dual guitar riffs, melodic choruses, and crushing breakdowns, the band teetered in between the heavy “bouncy” metalcore that was huge in 2011 and prog metal like Born Of Osiris. Great Faith In Fools front to back was incredible and the real crazy part is they sounded even better live. There is a video of guitarist Jesse Butler 1-taking the craziest technical solo I have ever seen in the studio, blew my mind. The band went on to tour the states multiple times but for how good this band was, they aren’t talked about enough. With the rise of prog metalcore where heavy breakdowns, speedy riffs and shred were praised, TAIB already came and went. The band released a brand new song in 2022 with OG vocalist Tony Dougard and Drummer Greg Diamond (who went on to be in Like Moths to Flames) called Nothing Feels Sound. After being silent for a good number of years the song gained over 50k streams on spotify. The band is reported to be working on new music, but still I sit here waiting anxiously to see what they have next and wanting to see them live again.\n\n2. Sworn In\n\nMany of you are reading this band’s name and remembering them on some pretty decent tours including Warped Tour. Here is why they are on this list; They’re album ‘Death Card’ was the precursor to bands like Alpha Wolf and nobody is admitting it. Sworn in was fairly well known in the hardcore music scene for being the guys with emo eyeshadow and the all black button ups. Sworn In was a metalcore band from Illinois that had an energetic stage show and theatrical look. Even though their songs were a lot of low tuned riffs that included crazy whammy work, the music was not simple and the lyrics were poetry. The band’s 2013 album ‘Death Card’ had something about it that was so sinister and so dark and their image reflected that. With songs like “Snake Eyes” , “Mindless” , and “Hypocrisy” Sworn In were just as heavy as bands like Emmure but had a more melodic and had a more emo look. To be honest, back then makeup and eye shadow in metalcore wasn’t that cool.. But I loved it. They also were apart of the bands that had the matching stage windbreakers that now are impossible to find and are seen as collectors items. Their second album wasn’t received as well as their first, and their 3rd was worse than their 2nd. After revisiting these albums, they are by no means bad at all, but no one was ready for them to change as much as they did. Now in 2023, with bands like Alpha Wolf killing it and theatrical emo and goth coming back into the scene but now as something accepted, If Sworn In’s Death Card dropped today, It would be an instant smash. This year just so happens to be 10 years since its release and If we get a 10 year tour, I would 100% be buying tickets.\n\n4. I Am King\n\nI Am King is a band out of Pennsylvania that was smack in the middle of the Metalcore/Electronica hybrid phase of music. Releasing their self-titled EP in 2012 independently, the band quickly got picked up by the powerhouse indie label Rise Records after doing a lot of DIY touring and growing a solid fanbase. Their debut album with Rise was titled ‘Onehundred’ and by all rights, it slapped. Their opening song ‘Alpha’ was first proof that they were taking a little harder and more progressive approach, So what happened? After having some member changes I truly feel that the band didn’t get the push from the label they deserved and were in the shadow of another band on the label that had a similar sound. Since then, the band has stayed active and keeps putting out amazing songs, for example after the Rise Records release, they put out a cover of ‘Impossible’ that currently has over 50M streams. You read that right, 50M. Even with the success in streams, I feel this band needs to be talked about more. They are now a 2 piece project and continue to release bangers, having a very very solid spotify and socials, I still think they deserved better.\n\n5. Hearts & Hands\n\nThis one's a little different in the way it was started, and also led to some pretty great projects forming after it. Hearts & Hands was started as a side project by ex-Chelsea Grin’s vocalist Alex Kohler and then guitar tech Alex Lyman. For context, this was a year after ‘My Damnation’ came out and Chelsea Grin was one of the biggest names in deathcore, so having a side project that showed a different side of Alex was a no-brainer to gain some traction. They recorded and released the single ‘We’re Not Alone’ which was one of the first times you heard Alex’s shrill-y screams mixed in with some really solid clean vocals. They released a full EP with Artery Recordings, the same label as Chelsea Grin at the time, and the ship sailed onward. Instead of keeping the band a side project, the band had legs and sought to do a little more than just wait around. Alex eventually chose to keep CG as his main project and left the band. A year later they released their full length album and it was ok, just ok. If you go on their Spotify now you can see what I mean because all of their top songs are from the first EP. Shortly after with a brief career the band split and Alex Lyman actually went on to create ‘Slaves’ with Jonny Craig who are now ‘Rain City Drive. The reason they are on this list for me, is the wonder of what could have been.\n\n6. Myka Relocate\n\nMyka Relocate was undoubtedly amazing, and seemed to start breaking out towards the end of the band’s career. Coming from Texas, the band was a perfect blend between high clean singing (really high), catchy melodies, and the occasional meaty breakdowns. Having been compared to We Came As Romans at the time for their dual vocalist outfit and similar song writing, Myka Relocate in my opinion had everything lined up to be great. Their first album ‘Lies to Light The Way’ was a staple album in my late teen years all the way to now. Songs like ‘Doublespeak’ , ‘Dead Ties’ , and ‘Something To Dream About’ were so energetic and powerful that no matter if you saw it live or listened on your phone you felt the energy. They released their second album and at first I liked it, but I was still so hooked on the first that I didn’t give it the respect it deserved until later on when It was too late. The band toured extensively throughout the US and even had a successful headlining run. The music industry is relentless and it is one of the hardest things to do being a touring musician so no one faults them for calling it quits when they did and I accept that it was 100% personal. But, they have really solid numbers even today and people still listen and ask about the band now in 2023. The core fanbase was strong and still is strong with almost 150k monthly on Spotify, But the band was good enough to be in the conversation with the powerhouses. They shouldn’t have been compared to WCAR, they should have been in the same seat. This breakup hurts more than the rest to be honest. I guess a reunion is only Something To Dream About, get it?\n\n7. Burden Of a Day\n\nBurden Of a Day was a post-hardcore band that were releasing music from 2006-2009. After releasing their first album on a smaller indie label, the band got picked up by Rise Records. They were in the midst of bands like early Emarosa, Underoath, Early Attack Attack, Greeley Estates, Alesana and others in those emo/post hardcore myspace days. After touring extensively the band grabbed a new vocalist named “Kyle Tamo” and in 2009 released “oneonethousand” that had some serious bangers that could hold weight even today like “Remember” and “My Forfeit.” But then, that was it and that was in 2009. Although the post hardcore, high singing, riffy bands were big back in 2009, It was nothing compared to the boom that was about to happen in the next couple of years. That third album was so locked in that I believe that if they would have released another record with the same energy, the band would have skyrocketed. Even so, oneonethousand still is an amazing record and no one is talking about it, such a shame."
