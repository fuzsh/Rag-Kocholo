In addition this list also includes the BPM of different EDM music genres. Itâs the best list on the internet of all the genres of electronic music so please bookmark and share this list!\n\nTo make it onto this list, the genres have to be predominantly electronic music genres rather than band-based music genres and music which is widely used by DJs in clubs. There are a few exceptions here to that rule because we wanted to contextualise some of our choices into the wider ecosystem of music genres in the western world.Â\n\nThis list is by no means complete, but it does cover most the main genres and important sub-genres. For sub-genres to appear on this list they need to be fairly well established and played by more than just a small clique of artists. Weâve not included all micro-genres as the list would be too long. Please note BPM notes are a rough guide.Â\n\nOur list of electronic music genres is in alphabetical order. If you would like to add something to the list feel free to contact us! If you would like to learn more about electronic music production or DJing get in touch with us by clicking here.Â Remember, all our DJ course graduates will join our community and be able to DJ with us at our events including at Ministry of Sound!

Like much of African-inspired music, Funk typically consists of a complex groove with rhythm instruments playing interlocking grooves that create a \"hypnotic\" and \"danceable\" feel. Funk uses the same richly coloured extended chords found in Bebop Jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths and thirteenths.

Low-fidelity sounds that might otherwise be edited out in the music production process become the focus instead of being disregarded. Examples of Lo-FI sounds include misplayed notes, environmental interference, phonographic imperfections, degraded audio signals, tape hiss, and so on.Â\n\nAs Lo-Fi is a style it has no BPM.Â\n\nClick here for an example on YouTube\n\nMashup\n\nMashup is another style or production process rather than an actual genre.

While it has many Pop styles within the genre, Nu Wave tracks often feature synthesisers and electronic sounds, distinguishing it from the more traditional Pop music of the time. Common features include; a twitchy, agitated feel, choppy rhythm guitars with fast tempos, keyboards, stop-start song structures and melodies. New Wave vocalists sounded high-pitched, geeky and suburban.Â\n\nThe BPM of New Wave, as with pop music, can vary.Â\n\nClick here for an example on YouTube\n\nPop\n\nPop music or âPopularâ music originated from Traditional Pop, Rock & Roll and Folk music. It's characterised by any music that falls under the vast umbrella of pandering to the commercially popular forms of song at the time. It can now also be used to describe music styles that pursue the established Pop style or aesthetic, or even music styles that mimic Pop in an attempt to subterfuge or hijack the genre, as with Hyper Pop. The stylistic goal posts of Pop are constantly changing but the overriding formula is that of a traditional song structure that has great emphasis on the singer or band and encourages celebrity. Structurally the song structure has repeated choruses and hooks, short to medium-length songs (radio edits) written in a basic and memorable format (often the verse-chorus structure).Â\n\nThe BPM of Pop music can vary.Â\n\nClick here for an example on YouTube\n\nProgressive House\n\nOriginating from House, Trance, Balearic and Italo House.

The modern style often replaces the traditional R&B band with electronic drum machines and instruments like the synthesiser.Â\n\nThe BPM of R&B varies but is commonly between 70 and 115 BPM. However, as a form of popular music with a vast history and many sub-genres,Â the BPM can sometimes surpass this range.Â\n\nClick here for an example on YouTubeâ\n\nRave\n\nRave most commonly refers to the late 1980s/early 1990s genres of House, New Beat, Breakbeat, Acid house, Techno and Hardcore Techno which were played at illegal raves.

The beat is decorated with sounds that are influenced by the soulful, jazzy end of House (although not as rich and more stripped back), some minimal and very often some dub elements. There is less emphasis on musicality and more focus on repetition and groove in the genre.Â\n\nThe BPM of Tech House is commonly 122-125 BPM but can vary within the BPM parameters of House music.\n\nClick here for an example on YouTube\n\nTechno\n\nOriginating from House, Synth Pop, Electro, Italo Disco, Hi-NRG, Chicago House, EBM, New Beat and Detroit Techno. The evolution of Detroit Techno, simply known as âTechnoâ is characterised by repetitive four-four beats produced deliberately to be used in the context of a continuous layered DJ set in a club. Much of the instrumentation in Techno emphasises the role of rhythm and repetition over other musical parameters. Techno music uses a disco-beat foundation but deconstructs the concept of using a lead instrument or instruments. It employs the modernist tradition of Klangfarbenmelodie, which means to use multiple sounds to construct a melodic sentence, as opposed to a lead instrument, creating a form of tech tribalism. These Techno melodies and patterns are formed using drum machines, synthesisers, keyboards and electronic instruments, commonly including the Roland TR-808, TR-909, TB-303 and synthesisers such as the Roland SH-101, Kawai KC10, Yamaha DX7, and Yamaha DX100.\n\nThe BPM of Techno music is commonly between 120 and 150 BPM.Â\n\nClick here for an example on YouTube\n\nTechstepÂ\n\nOriginating from 2-Step Garage, Drum & Bass, Industrial, Darkcore and Techno. Characterised by a dark, sci-fi mood, near-exclusive use of synthesised or sampled sound sources, 2-step kicks and snares and influences from industrial and Techno music. Stylistically it's a clinical and high-energy collage of abstract, synthetic noises, including samples, bleeps and squelches using a D&B template. In a diversion from D&B, it focuses on a quantised drum-machine and percussion kit over more naturalistic human breakbeat. Following the D&B musical structure, it has a strong focus on the drop. In addition, there is an emphasis on exploring the timbre of the bassline, this often manifests with a deeper and more experimental bass.Â\n\nThe BPM of Techstep is commonly between 160 and 180 BPM.Â\n\nClick here for an example on YouTube\n\nTrance\n\nOriginating from House, Techno, Chill-Out, Classical, Hardcore Techno and Ambient. Characterised by repeating melodic phrases and a musical form that distinctly builds tension over time often culminating in one or two drops. Breakdowns are often long and devoid of percussion, crescendos often borrow dramatics from Classical music.

Trance is mostly instrumental club edits for DJs to mix at clubs but can sometimes feature vocals. Vocals on trance often reflect the operatic style, spirituality of the music or higher-consciousness and sometimes sci-fi themes.Â\n\nThe BPM of Trance is between 135 and 150 BPM.Â\n\nClick here for an example on YouTube\n\nTrap\n\nOriginating from Southern Hip Hop, Gangsta Rap, Crunk and Memphis Rap. Trap music uses synthesised drums and is characterised by complicated hi-hat patterns, booming 808 kick drums, synths and lyrical content that often reflects but is not limited to that of Gangsta Rap. It utilises sparse instrumentation with less emphasis on musicality. There is a strong focus on snare and hi hat rolls often in triplet patterns, cow bells and only limited use of longer melodies. Trap can often feature talk and response musical structures and rhythmical glitches or super fast repetitions.\n\nThe BPM of Trap music is commonly 70 BPM but can also be seen as 140 BPM in double-time. Other Trap songs can vary with the BPM going as low as 50 BPM, although you can say this is 100 BPM in double-time.

It often features a bass-heavy and slowed down breakbeat combined with ambient psychedelia. Vocals in trip hop are often but not exclusively female and feature characteristics of various singing styles including R&B, Jazz and Rock. Trip Hop is also known for its atmospherics, melancholia and reflective overtone that contrasted both stylistically and lyrically with Gangsta Rap. It incorporates Rhodes pianos, saxophones, trumpets, flutes and unconventional instruments like the Mellotron or Theremin.Â\n\nThe BPM of Trip Hop can vary but is typically no more than 120 BPM.Â\n\nClick here for an example on YouTube\n\nTropical Bass\n\nOriginating from Baile Funk, Kuduro, UK Funky, Grime, Electro Funk, Electro House and more.
