        "text": "Alternative thread title: 4–6 white dudes attempt to reveal the face of god through textured guitar work\n\nWhew, we have a lot of ground to cover here. I'm very interested to see who else shares these particular musical tastes, and if anyone else is constantly on the hunt for their next musical hit. Post-whatever music is like a drug for me, and I'm always chasing those first-time-listen feels. No other genre gets me lifted like a good posty track. There's so much out there. This OP will just scratch the surface, and I'm hoping others will share and everyone will walk away with new shit to blast.\n\nSince posts here are limited to two embeds, I'm going to link to a lot of stuff.\n\nPost-rock\n\nEveryone has heard the giants, so we won't touch much Explosions in the Sky, Mogwai, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Sigur Rós, etc. This genre is absolutely fucking massive, but below are a few of my reliable groups that I will always be there on Day 1 for a new release, in no particular order:\n\nIf These Trees Could Talk:\n\nTides From Nebula\n\n65daysofstatic\n\nThis Patch of Sky\n\npg.lost\n\n*shels\n\nThere are also numerous bands that I have discovered recently, though their releases may not actually be recent. Below are a few that have really grabbed me, grabbed randomly from my playlists. Again, there is soooooooo much out there, this is just a drop in the bucket:\n\nGoodbye, Titan\n\nI Hear Sirens\n\nAudrey Fall\n\nOh Hiroshima\n\npowder! go away\n\nMooncake\n\nsleepmakeswaves\n\nPost-metal\n\nIf you prefer things a little heavier, I've got the genre for you. I personally classify a lot more bands with vocals as post-metal than I would with post-rock, though there are several instrumental-only bands below. This genre gets murky, with lots of crossover black metal and other sludgy subgenres:\n\nCult of Luna:\n\nRosetta\n\nCelephaïs\n\nHourvari (sadly only lasted for one 2-song EP)\n\nCelestial Wolves\n\nLight Bearer\n\nKehlvin\n\nYear of No Light\n\nSól (my buddy's band, so it gets a plug)\n\nPost-Hardcore\n\nThese bands embody the spirit of the posty guitar, but mix it with the energy and vocal style of hardcore. Some of my favorite workout tracks can be found below:\n\nRinoa\n\nenvy\n\nTaken\n\nheaven in her arms\n\nThe Tidal Sleep\n\nCrydebris\n\nI could probably spend all week finding and adding artists to the lists above. To me, these genres represent the heights of rock and what it can evoke. I'll leave you with a link to a playlist my buddy maintains (same buddy as above) that updates monthly with new tracks from a variety of bands, though it does trend on the heavier side:\n\nSpotify\n\nGoogle Play Music\n\nI haven't been able to keep up with any new music lately, especially within the genres aimed at for this thread but I still find time to listen to some of the stuff. I would say most of these bands I'll list could fall within any of those genres, some falling into math-rock. I'm just gonna link a random song from each one that I think is representative of their sound, not necessarily my favorites but whatever's available on YT.\n\nAnd So I Watch You From Afar - Big Thinks do Remarkable - high energy, instrumental/math rock, some vocals\n\nMouse On The Keys - 最後の晩餐 - japanese instrumental jazz rock, no vocals\n\nmudy on the 昨晩 - PERSON! PERSON!! - japanese instrumental/math rock, some vocals\n\nAurore Rien - Sunsets (I have seen too many without you) - slow/ambient post-rock, some vocals\n\nStage Kids - Face First - instrumental/math rock, no vocals\n\nHave A Nice Life - Hunter - industrial/experimental/post-rock, vocals\n\nThe Antarcticans - Ghost of the Trees & the Erase of Man - sludgy/doom/hardcore instrumental rock, no vocals. i actually really miss these guys, very unique sound\n\nThe Redneck Manifesto - Another Day of Hunting - instrumental rock, no vocals\n\nJapandroids - Sovereignty - post-hardcore, vocal heavy\n\nI haven't been able to keep up with any new music lately, especially within the genres aimed at for this thread but I still find time to listen to some of the stuff.

Looking forward to digging in.\n\nThis is another good pick, I need to spin this again.\n\nWorld's End Girlfriend released an amazing album recently...\n\nNot as good as Palmless Prayer/Mass Murder Refrain (one of my favourite albums ever) but still...excellent stuff.\n\nSpeaking of which, MONO have a new album out next year. Heard 3 or 4 tracks from it live last month, *so* good...\n\nAnd I'll just name drop some random bands I've been listening to recently for people to check out...\n\nCataya\n\nDegree of Arc\n\nHeinali\n\nLang\n\nOnce Upon a Winter\n\nShadow Universe\n\nShekhina\n\nWhere the Good Way Lies\n\nWings of the Isang\n\nWinterlight\n\nYoung Mountain\n\nYuki Murata\n\nOh and not recent but any excuse to post possibly my favourite song of all time...\n\nHave a Nice Life - Earthmover\n\nCarved out of stone\n\nEarth, blood and bone\n\nThey knock the mountains down\n\nThe earth's grating sounds\n\nThey soothe the great machines\n\nThat yearn desperately\n\nJust to lay them down\n\nWithin her gaping mouth\n\nMore than a symbol\n\nMore than I bargained for\n\nMore than a symbol\n\nMore than I bargained for\n\nThey wander ridges high\n\nBetween the earth and sky\n\nLike spikes upon a crown\n\nWe wear upon our brow\n\nAnd want is not a need\n\nReserved for human beings\n\nIts fingers on your throat\n\nIs pain that all things know\n\nMore than a symbol\n\nMore than I bargained for\n\nMore than a symbol\n\nMore than I bargained for\n\nAn army of the golems is stalking, now, the heart's lands\n\nEating all reality\n\nProducing only dust and sand\n\nNothing hurts them\n\nNothing gets under their stone skin\n\nAnd when their earthen mouths will open up\n\nAnd just what words should come out but\n\n\"We wish we were dead\"\n\nCool thread\n\nSumac is one of my current favorite post-metal bands, and one of the heaviest live acts I've seen in the last ten years – since Isis disbanded, basically. Aaron Turner is a god.\n\nSome key faves:\n\nInter Arma are putting out a new record soon, but Paradise Gallows was one of my favorites from 2016. A number of media outlets put this at the top of their metal lists for the year and it was well deserved. They'd generally be considered post-metal but they really do it all.\n\nTransfiguration\n\nExamination of the... started out as a chaotic hardcore/screamo act, but by their last album (The Whitest of Elephants, 2003) they'd become a post-metal band through and through.\n\nKicking a Dead Horse Aside\n\nNadja is a band that doesn't need much on an introduction, but their discography is huge; oddly enough one of my favorite songs they've ever done is a cover of a Slayer classic.\n\nDead Skin Mask\n\nSome other favorites from across the years not mentioned in the OP:\n\nAltar of Plagues (post-black metal)\n\nPlanning for Burial\n\nZozobra\n\nOcean (not THE Ocean, but they're okay too)\n\nA Storm of Light\n\nGiant Squid\n\nNice OT, there's so many post-rock bands, I'll check some of these out.\n\nSpeaking of which, MONO have a new album out next year. Heard 3 or 4 tracks from it live last month, *so* good...\n\nI saw them too a few weeks ago during their European Tour, it was an amazing experience to say the least.\n\nThey ended it with Ashes in the Snow, people were in trance.\n\nCaspian and We Lost the Sea are also two amazing bands.\n\nWe Lost the Sea - A Gallant Gentleman : one of the best track from one of their best album.\n\n\"Departure Songs\" is a journey from start to finish, and more people should experience it.\n\nCaspian - Sycamore : A classic"
