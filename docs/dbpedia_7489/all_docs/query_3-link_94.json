        "text": "When Kurt Cobain’s Journals were published in 2002 they provided fans with genuine insight into the man and his music through both his diary entries as well as a series of deeply personal illustrations. The subjects Kurt tackled ranged from his own insecurities through to pop culture and on his dissatisfaction with the world he saw around him. Throughout the 280-page book, his fascination with music runs deep.\n\nLike every music nerd, Kurt also felt obliged to compile a list of his favourite records, labelling it ‘Top 50 By Nirvana’. That list is presented here with our annotations. We suggest you dig in to this music. It shaped the way Kurt thought, wrote and played, and it might just change your life…\n\nThe third and hardest rocking album by The Stooges sounds as if it was made by a band who were genuinely about to self-destruct – which of course they were. Despite David Bowie acting as mentor and co-producer, Iggy Pop’s own bravado contrasts with some of the emotional lyricism, I Need Somebody being a particular example of his vulnerability. Kurt himself once called Iggy to suggest they collaborate on some music but sadly the latter’s attempt to call back went unheeded.\n\nWhen Kim Deal (Pixies) and and Tanya Donnelly (Throwing Muses) drunkenly decided to form a band together, they shrugged off the ‘supergroup’ tag with ease. How? By making an album that is utterly joyous and spontaneous – the album’s freshness stemming from the fact that it was recorded by Steve Albini in the space of a week, the producer refusing to allow unnecessary multiple takes. He would approach his work with on Nirvana’s In Utero with the same rigour.\n\nOne of the greatest post-punk albums of all-time, Gang Of Four’s debut is an exercise in musical tension. Even four decades on nothing sounds quite like it, the 12 tracks on offer influencing everyone from Fugazi to Daughters along the way. A swift blast of Natural’s Not In It should tell you why…\n\nMen (Come On Men), Dykes Are We and Homos are just a few of the unambiguous song titles included on this album where lo-fi instrumentation is topped with confrontational homo-erotic lyricism. Targeted by conservative religious groups, the Wisconsin folk-punks – led by the Flemion brothers, Dennis and Jimmy – reacted by recording a tune entitled God Is Gay and including it on their next album.\n\nSwitzerland is not known for its punk scene but it did spawn Kleenex – the surreal, female post-punk four-piece who were signed by UK label Rough Trade. While Kurt didn’t recommend a specific album on his list due to the paucity of their recorded output, we’re happy to suggest Kleenex/Liliput – anthology released in 1993 – which collects the work of the original band and their subsequent outfit, Liliput.\n\nKurt often expressed his admiration for R.E.M, enthusing about the manner in which they’d managed to leap from an independent label on to a major, all while retaining their integrity. His also admired the band’s songwriting – something that developed considerably on Green (their first album for Warner Brothers). R.E.M.’s world-beating offering, Out Of Time, would follow three years later cementing their rise from the US alternative underground to the world’s stadia.\n\nRamones-worshippers Shonen Knife recorded their first album in the most basic of circumstances and unburdened by musical proficiency. That said, what emerges on this debut is that same sense of naivety that defines The Shaggs’ first album. If Tortoise Brand Pot Cleaner’s Theme remains one of the finer titles employed by the Japanese three-piece, their ability to write pop hooks is also evident. Nirvana’s affection for the Osaka three-piece was such that they insisted the band open for them on the UK tour they undertook just prior to the release of Nevermind.\n\nProduced by Barbados-born reggae producer and musician Dennis Bovell, The Slits’ debut is a heady mix of unconventional post-punk melodies, garage-reggae rhythms and dub textures, all topped by Ari Up’s distinctive vocal style. Kurt’s favourite Slits track, Typical Girls, is a good starting point for anyone wishing to acquaint themselves with this truly unique band, while guitar player Viv Albertine’s autobiography, Clothes Clothes Clothes Music Music Music Boys Boys Boys, brings you an eye-opening report of what it was like to be a woman growing up in the male-dominated world of ‘70s punk rock.\n\nOf all the bands to emerge from America’s Pacific Northwest in the late 1980s, Beat Happening were arguably the outfit whose debt to the UK indie scene was most pronounced. Nowhere were their so-called ‘twee pop’ sensibilities more evident than on this second album – a record which was co-produced by Mark Lanegan and Gary Conner of Screaming Trees. In fact, the album’s third track, Indian Summer, has become something of a US indie rock anthem.\n\nSacramento punks Tales Of Terror lasted long enough to record one album – the band splitting when guitar player Lyon Wong died following a street fight. Despite their short-lived career, their impact on the burgeoning US underground scene is evident not only thanks to their inclusion in this list but also due to Seattle outfit Green River’s decision to cover TOT classic Ozzy on their Dry As A Bone EP in 1987.\n\nOriginally released on cassette, this fifth collection of music showcases Daniel Johnston’s homemade approach to making music and his outsider charm. When Kurt was photographed wearing a T-shirt bearing the title of Johnston’s sixth collection, Hi, How Are You, the Austin-based songwriter was introduced to an entirely new audience. His cult status has endured and in 2005, he was the subject of a remarkable film, The Devil And Daniel Johnston, which explored the impact of bipolar disorder on his life.\n\nKurt was obsessed enough with Flipper to hand draw a shirt sporting their logo while Krist Novoselic was so in awe of the band that he joined them in 2006, appearing on two of their albums in the process. The reason for this hero-worship lies in this debut – an album that simultaneously manages to deconstruct rock’n’roll, slowing it down to a snails pace, all while basking in punk’s nihilistic tendencies.\n\nAnother US band armed with an independent spirit and a glorious sense of the naïve, Half Japanese have continued to make music on their own terms for the last 30 years. Such was Nirvana’s love of their brand of playful, experimental art-pop that Half Japanese were added to a number of shows on the In Utero tour alongside The Breeders.\n\nMore British agit-punk but this time with the added frustration born in the Home Counties. Led by Tracey Thorn – later in Everything But The Girl and a solo artist in her own right – the Marine Girls debut is artful, whimsical as well as angry.\n\nFew people have managed to cover a David Bowie tune quite like Nirvana during their Unplugged performance that they recorded in November 1993. Revisit that filmed set now and you marvel as Kurt seems to own and inhabit the lyrics to the title track of this 1970 album – the original of which was recorded long before Bowie had found stardom himself.\n\nPortland-based songwriter Greg Sage originally aimed to cut his own records and then release them without ever promoting them through the usual channels. He reasoned that people would listen to the music in a manner that allowed their imagination to engage fully. Is This Real? was a remarkable first step in his attempt to create that sense of engagement.\n\nSage’s second attempt was less punchy and less direct, but no less absorbing – its sleeve echoing ‘70s punk minimalism while its title track stretched to over 10 minutes. The marked difference in approach appeared to confuse fans of Is This Real? although history has seen YOA judged on a par with the band’s classic debut.\n\nAt times referred to as Raping A Slave or I Crawled, this four-track EP captures SWANS’ initial claustrophobic approach to music as well as their bleak worldview. All four tracks are brutal and challenging, forcing the listener to confront themselves and the world around them. It is that confrontational spirit that Nirvana clearly drew on and which informed the dichotomy within much of Kurt’s own words and music."
