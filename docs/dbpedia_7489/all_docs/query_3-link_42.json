        "text": "Adoption and Growth\n\nIn spring 2020, we embarked on a journey to help developers create amazing user interfaces with modern paradigms. In April this year, we reached a major milestone with the release of Slint 1.0. As the only Rust based GUI toolkit with stable APIs, we're grateful to receive attention from leading technical media and publications, such as Heise, Phoronix, The New Stack, DevClass, It's FOSS, and more. We also made it to the front page of Hacker News ðŸŽ‰.\n\nOur 1.0 release spiked interest in Slint; the GitHub discussions forum started warming up and we've had a steady stream of newcomers to our Mattermost chat. In response to sheer number of applications for the Slint Ambassador license, we created the Royalty-free license, so you can develop proprietary desktop and web applications with Slint for free. Folks started building apps, and we saw our GitHub stars skyrocket with more than 11K star gazers!\n\nSuccess Stories\n\nToday, several commercial products are shipping with Slint. Among them are:\n\nSK Signet built a scalable HMI for Electric Vehicle chargers on an embedded device.\n\nWesAudio built a stunning, futuristic looking UI for their high-performance Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) plugin on the desktop.\n\nBrewtools built an MCU-based control panel for their Fermentation Control System, running on an ESP32S3 MCU.\n\nIn the Open Source community, Slint is popular for its first-class Rust support. Of the ~380 projects using Slint, some of our favorite #MadeWithSlint projects are:\n\nThorbjÃ¸rn built Raccoin, a Rust-based crypto tax tool.\n\nJussi Viiri built a bridge for creating DAW plugins in Rust with Slint.\n\nFlorian keeps growing and polishing the lovely coop custom widget library.\n\nYiFei Sheng not only created an entire Fluent inspired component library but also wrote a Slint tutorial in Chinese.\n\nOur Growing Slint Community\n\nWe're very grateful to the 51 individual contributors for their valuable contributions and help with the development of Slint this year and to all of you who reported bugs, suggested features and took part in the discussions. Among the many small and big contributions, we'd like to highlight some:\n\nJP introduced the concept of @library imports, which improves encapsulation of component libraries.\n\nKen Carpenter added lots of new easing curves for animations, including support for custom cubic bezier curves.\n\nThorbjÃ¸rn optimized StandardTableView performance for large tables.\n\nJan Janssen contributed an example of how to run Slint at boot-time in a UEFI environment.\n\nMatheus Castello started contributing .NET C# support.\n\nJocelyn Turcotte added support for repeated key events.\n\nGuiguiprim refactored the item geometry, cleaned clippy warnings, and contributed many other small features and bugfixes.\n\nDarknight (Eric) added support for Number and Decimal as input types and contributed many other useful refactors and bug fixes.\n\nAmirhossein Akhlaghpour added support for serializing Slint structs with serde.\n\nWe'd like to take this opportunity to say THANK YOU to our users, contributors, ambassadors, and evangelists, for being part of the growing community around Slint. Your enthusiasm, energy, feedback, and support keeps us motivated and drives us to achieve more.\n\nRecognitions\n\nOne of the many proud moments for us was when Slint was recognized as one of the top 50 open source startups of 2022! Following that, we were over the moon, when Slint was awarded the Embedded Award of the Year in Tooling at Embedded World, the world's largest embedded systems tradeshow.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nRoadmap for 2024\n\nWe've got a few high-level items on our roadmap for next year. We're also making sure to leave room to implement specific functionality that our customers need to succeed.\n\nReady for Mobile: We'll release the initial Android port; we plan to support iOS in future.\n\nImproved Language Support: We're looking forward to bringing Slint to the Python community during the first half of 2024. We'll also boost our Node.js integration and will graduate it out of beta status.\n\nDesign tool: We're going to further develop SlintPad into a tool to design user interface screens, both simple and complex, without the need to write code.\n\nEvents\n\nWe're looking forward to meeting some of you in person at various events next year. Some plans are still being finalized, but we're definitely going to be at Embedded World in April, with a stand in hall 4, booth 300.\n\nAccelerate Growth\n\nWhile we've been growing the team organically, next year we'd like to speed up growth to accelerate product development and to support customer and user requests. We hope to hire next year.\n\nGrowth also means investment: If you know anyone who might be interested in investing into Slint, kindly recommend us. We can be reached at [email protected]."
