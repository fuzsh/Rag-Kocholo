It includes most, but not all, terms for western art music and some popular genres.\n\nIt does not show the hierarchy. For the complete list and the hierarchical structure, please see Music Genre/Form Terms in LCGFT (scroll down to the top music term \"music\"). To search individual terms, please see Classification Web (subscription required) or the Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms website.\n\nAbout vocal works with sacred texts: while LCGFT includes terms for forms of sacred music, e.g., Masses, Requiems, Vespers (Music), Psalms (Music) (but not specific psalms), Litanies (Music), etc., terms for settings of specific texts are not included in LCGFT, e.g., Magnificat, Kyrie, Agnus Dei, etc. (For a setting of a specific text, an added entry (730) may be made.) (source: Library of Congress, NMP-L, Mon 11/22/2021)\n\nThese terms are used in conjunction with Recording form of work (RDA 6.3), MLA's Best practices for using LCGFT for music resources (version 1.2 (July 8, 2019)), and MARC 380 (Form of work) and/or MARC 655 (Index term–genre/form).\n\nA | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | XYZ"
