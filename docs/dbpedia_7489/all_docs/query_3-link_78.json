        "text": "Application\n\nAn application program (application for short) is a computer program designed to carry out a specific task typically requested by end-users.\n\nApplications are not generally considered as part of the operating system, meaning that they can be added to the system after its installation. They perform non-system-related functions, such as word processing, architectural design, mechanical design, workstation publishing, or financial analysis.\n\nBoot\n\nBoot means switch-on a computer to start an operating system. Several operating systems can be installed in the same computer. Select which one to load into RAM and run can be done either by the firmware or by a software named boot manager (GRUB in Slint’s case). The firmware of a computer can support one of following booting mode, or both:\n\nIn the Legacy or BIOS mode the OS is loaded executing the instructions written in a boot sector.\n\nIn the EFI mode the OS loader is a program stored in an executable file, located in a directory of an EFI System partition (ESP).\n\nCPU\n\nThe CPU or Central Processing Unit executes the instructions of programs.\n\nCommand\n\nCommand is defined by POSIX as \"a directive to a shell to perform a specific task\".\n\nThe task to perform can be an application or an utility.\n\nThe basic structure of shell commands is defined in the chapter 2.9 Shell Commands of the POSIX specification.\n\nExamples of commands are provided in [bash shell].\n\nConsole\n\nThe word \"console\" refers to the beginning of computer systems, when the system administrator typed commands on a device including a keyboard and a printer, linked to the computer, the commands typed and the output from the computer being printed on the console, providing a log of both.\n\nIn personal computers the user type the commands on keyboard and their output is printed on a screen, that can be separated from or integrated to the computer as in a laptop.\n\nDevice\n\nA computer peripheral or an object that appears to the application as such.[POSIX]\n\nDirectory\n\nA directory is another name for a folder. File systems use directories to organize files within partitions.\n\nDirectories can contain files and also other directories. The resulting structure can be represented as an upside-down tree. The top-level directory of a drive is named the root directory. In Linux the character / separates the levels of the tree. / alone represents the root directory, /home hosts the files belonging to users, /home/didier hosts the files belonging to user didier. /root hosts the files of the user named root (the system’s administrator). Note: 'root' can refer to the top-level directory or the system’s administrator.\n\nDrive\n\nA drive is a device that stores non volatile data, meaning that the data is not erased when the power is turned off. Examples: hard disks, SSD, USB sticks, SD cards readers, eMMC.\n\nThe media storing the data can be permanently attached to the drive or removable like SD cards, USB sticks and drives connected through USB.\n\nAn operating system installed in a removable media or an external drive is said portable: it can be moved from a computer to another one.\n\nDisplay manager\n\nA display manager (or login manager) is a software that displays a window on the screen in which it asks the login name and password of the user, then starts the graphical environment chosen by said user.\n\nEncryption\n\nEncryption is the process of converting data to an unrecognizable (\"encrypted\") form. It is commonly used to protect sensitive information so that only authorized persons can view it. A single file or directory, a partition as well as a whole drive can be encrypted, which make it accessible only after having typed a small text called a passphrase, kept secret.\n\nFile\n\nA computer file is a set of digital data gathered under the same name, recorded on a permanent storage medium, called mass storage, such as a hard disk, a SSD, a DVD, a SD card or an USB stick and handled as a unit.\n\nFiles can contain data like texts, images, sounds, videos or computers programs.\n\nFile System\n\nA file system is a software that manages the files and directories in a partition. It memorizes the location in the physical media of the data contained in the files, allowing to read or writing them. Examples of commonly used file systems are vfat, ntfs, ext4, f2fs. This command lists all file systems allowing to read data contained in a partition from Linux:\n\ncat /proc/filesystems|grep -v nodev\n\nFirmware\n\nA firmware is a software that initializes and checks the hardware, then either selects and load in RAM the operating system, or starts a software called a boot manager that will do that. The firmware is held in non-volatile memory devices such as ROM, EPROM, or flash memory. It is the first software run when booting a computer. It provides a menu allowing to configure the hardware and select in which mode (Legacy or EFI) to boot, and in which order look for the operating system or other application (like the GRUB boot manager) to run.\n\nKernel\n\nA Linux kernel is the software at the core of a Slint system which handles the interactions between the applications and the hardware.\n\nIt presents itself as a single file, installed in the directory /boot. For instance the file /boot/vmlinuz-generic-5.12.11 is a kernel, coming from kernel-generic package.\n\nAt startup the kernel is copied into RAM.\n\nInitrd\n\nAn initrd (more accurately an initramfs or initial RAM file system for Slint) is a Linux system provided as a compressed archive file. At boot, just after the kernel has been loaded in RAM the inird is loaded in RAM too. Its file /init runs: it loads needed kernel modules in RAM, register the devices, possibly unlock the root device, mount the pseudo file systems then switch to the root file system to actually start the system.\n\nAn initrd presents itself as a single file, installed in the directory boot. For instance the file initrd-generic-5.12.11 is an initrd\n\nLive system\n\nA live system is an operating system that, instead of being installed in a device like an hard disk or SSD, lies entirely in RAM.\n\nAn initrd is also a live system, and so is a Slint installer wich is basically an initrd.\n\nPartition\n\nA partition is a section of a storage media, such as a hard disk or SSD. It is treated by the operating system as a separate logical volume, which makes it function similar to a separate media.\n\nPartition table\n\nA partition table is the permanent structure recording how information is laid out on a media, mainly recording the beginning and end of each partition on the media.\n\nThe most common types of partition tables are the DOS partition table, initially used by the MS-DOS operating system, and the GUID Partition Table or GPT, which allows to handle more partitions and larger drives.\n\nProgram\n\nA prepared sequence of instructions to the system to accomplish a defined task. The term \"program\" encompasses applications written in the Shell Command Language, complex utility input languages (for example, awk, lex, sed, and so on), and high-level languages. [POSIX]\n\nRAM\n\nRAM stands for Random Access Memory. This kind of device stores volatile data, meaning that the data is erased when the power is turned off.\n\nShell\n\nA program that interprets sequences of text input as commands. It may operate on an input stream or it may interactively prompt and read commands from a terminal. The syntax of the commands that can be interpretd by the shell can vary along the shell in use but are mainly defined in the the chapter 2. Shell Command Language of the POSIX specification.\n\nSlint ships several programs acting as shell, listed in the file /etc/shells. The bash shell is used by default.\n\nSwap\n\nA swap space is used to tentatively store data previously in RAM on a device like a hard disk or SSD, either because else the RAM would become full, or to free space in RAM to store there most frequently used data. The swap space can be a partition on a drive of type 'Linux swap' or a regular file stored in an an existing partition. There is also the 'swap in zram': in this case the data is stored in RAM but in compressed form, to its usable size of the RAM.\n\nTerminal\n\nHistorically a terminal was a physical device composed of a keyboard and a screen used to type commands and receives responses from a remote computer.\n\nNowadays the commands can be typed in console (or text) mode or in graphical mode.\n\nUtility\n\nAn utility is a program that can be called by name from a shell (this is also the case of some <application,applications>>).\n\nUtilities are a part of the operating system (but not of the kernel). They perform system-related functions, such as listing directory contents, checking file systems, repairing file systems, or extracting system status information.\n\nAn utility may be invoked as a separate program that executes in a different process than the command language interpreter, or it may be implemented as a part of the command language interpreter.\n\nFor example, the echo command (the directive to perform a specific task) may be implemented such that the echo utility (the logic that performs the task of echoing) is in a separate program; therefore, it is executed in a process that is different from the command language interpreter. Practically this means this means that in this case the utility is a program distinct from the shell\n\nConversely, the logic that performs the echo utility could be built into the command language interpreter; therefore, it could execute in the same process as the command language interpreter. Such an utility is said \"built-in\" the shell.\n\nVirtual terminal"
