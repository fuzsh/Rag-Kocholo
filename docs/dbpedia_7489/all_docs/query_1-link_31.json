Accents shifted, tempos changed, music stopped and started and stopped again in this showpiece of ensemble syncopation.”\n\n-Howard Reich, Jazz Critic from the Chicago Tribune\n\nJazz/Pop Choir\n\nThe Jazz/Pop Choir advances the understanding and proficiency in jazz and pop through rehearsal and performance of group repertoire in a variety of styles. Traditional choral skills of blend, balance, unison and harmonic intonation, and articulation in swing, pop, and Latin genres are studied through rehearsal and performance using microphones and sound reinforcement. Students learn to sing with a rhythm section, a cappella, as soloists, and in men’s, women’s, and mixed small groups. Students participate in an end-of-semester performance and additional performances on and off campus.\n\nNew Music Ensemble\n\nThe New Music Ensemble (NME) performs music specifically created for and by its performers/composers in any style—from classical to EDM and anything in between—for the instruments available, including computers and digital instruments. Typically, between 25 to 30 performers strong, the goal of NME is to produce music that makes both the composer and our ensemble sound at their best, and capable of entertaining an audience at a high level of accomplishment. The ensemble offers the exciting possibility to write for hybrid orchestra, to involve DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), non-linear composition, and more. Ensemble members and composers are involved in making their own recordings and mixes for posting on the web.\n\nPop Rock Showcase Ensemble\n\nThe Pop Rock Showcase Ensemble is an advanced ensemble performing several styles of the pop/rock genre from the 1960s to the present. This group typically includes two guitars, keyboards, bass, drums and four vocalists, and strives to replicate all parts from historically great recordings.\n\nColumbia’s Artists-in-Residence program has provided the opportunity for the group to perform with acclaimed and Grammy Award recipients, including Paula Cole, Todd Rundgren, Joan Osborne, Shawn Mullins, Ivan Neville, and Charlie Sexton. The ensemble performs both at on and off-campus venues in the city.\n\nR&B Ensemble\n\nAn advanced performance ensemble drawing its repertoire from classic and contemporary R&B artists such as Earth Wind & Fire, James Brown, the Gap Band, Chaka Khan, Parliament and others, this ensemble prepares students to perform with confidence and professionalism in a contemporary rhythm and blues context. Students learn how to front a band and interact with fellow band members to create an exciting live performance.\n\nEnsemble members research and present material to the rest of the group for inclusion in the ensemble repertoire. Students learn the keys to playing tight R&B grooves while perfecting a live show to be performed at various venues on and off campus.\n\nRecording and Performance Ensemble\n\nThe course represents the students’ progression from the advanced to the professional level and is intended for performers, performing writers, and producers. While the course is a required capstone experience for Bachelor of Music candidates in Contemporary, Jazz, and Popular Music, qualified instrumentalists, singers, and writers with requisite ensemble experience and Music coursework may also participate. Placement into RPE requires the approval of the CJP Program Director.\n\nNot so much an ensemble as a year-long collaborative project, the Recording and Performance Ensemble (RPE) experience includes extensive work in the multi-track recording studio, as well as regular on- and off-campus performances.\n\nRPE students form collaborative, original music projects, which last through consecutive fall and spring semesters. Over the course of the academic year, these bands write, record, perform, and develop their material, and overall artist profile under the guidance of their faculty project directors, staff, and guest producers, visiting artists in residence, and student artist-development teams from the Music Business program. Each RPE project works with their team to develop an EPs-worth of high-quality recorded material, as well as a performing act suitable for showcasing to industry professionals. Other areas of Columbia student collaboration with RPE bands may include live booking, music video production, regional touring, and showcasing at industry events, including SXSW.\n\nChicago Vox\n\nChicago Vox is a jazz ensemble of eight to 12 vocalists and a rhythm section. The ensemble performs an a cappella and accompanied repertoire of jazz and pop with global musical influences; all music is memorized, and improvisation is encouraged. The ensemble performs on the Music Department’s schedule of concerts and for events such as Manifest, Columbia’s annual urban street festival, Commencement, and other special engagements throughout the year. Placement requires audition and approval of the Vocal Coordinator.\n\nPerformance Survey Ensemble\n\nThis intermediate level ensemble focuses on a variety of essential and influential musical styles, with each genre taught by a team of professional practitioners who specialize in the area of focus.

The ensemble discovers the origins of today's popular music by reaching back to its originators, exploring the forebears of blues, country, folk, rock and roll, rockabilly, soul, funk, reggae, and punk; often times before names describing each genre existed. An eclectic tidal wave of music that lived side by side on the radio dial, defying region, race, and sexuality way before the world could catch up with it. Repertoire represents essential genres and the times they originated on the American airwaves, paying strict attention to what makes them unique, while striving to add a modern interpretation, expressive of the popular music of today.\n\nColumbia Laptop Ensemble\n\nThis ensemble electro-acoustic performs music by autonomous performers in a live setting. Each performer uses their laptop computer running custom-designed software (usually in the Max environment) for each composition. Just as in a chamber ensemble of acoustic instruments, the audience experiences each performer’s sound as if it were emanating directly from him or her. The ensemble’s performance is often enhanced by means of handheld controllers such as smart phones or game controllers.\n\nThe repertoire is varied, and includes traditions embraced by Varèse, Stockhausen, Cage, and others, and expanding to sound art, soundscapes, spectral music, structured improvisation, EDM, and the imaginations of living composers, many of whom workshop their pieces with the ensemble. Collaborations include dance, poetry, and invented sound controllers."
