        "text": "Man Between Two Continents (01:24)\n\nFREE PREVIEW\n\nA Scotsman does contract work for the fishing industry, traveling between Scotland, the Faroe Islands, and Europe. He flies off to a remote region of Paraguay.\n\nCanindeyu Region of Paraguay (01:12)\n\nA Scotsman has filmed the lives of the Ache Indians for 6 years. They are indigenous people living in the last pocket of sub-tropical rain forest in South America. The world around the Ache is changing fast.\n\nRestless Natives (00:35)\n\nThe Ache feel the press of progress on their lands. Violence can and does erupt, as the Ache are now armed with guns. They must fight for the right to remain Indians.\n\nScotsman's Interest in Ache Indians (01:07)\n\nThe Faroe Islands lie between Scotland and Iceland. Flemming Pettersen grew up in a village in the Islands. He spent one year in Paraguay on a cattle ranch as a youth and became acquainted with the Ache Indians.\n\nParaguay: Land of Contrast (01:05)\n\nMost of Paraguay's 5 million people live in the southern half of the country. The Ache Indians have three tribes along the southeastern part of the country. The Ache first made contact with the outside world in 1971.\n\nRound-Up of Indigenous Forest People (01:10)\n\nUntil 1971, the Ache lived as hunter-gatherers, living a nomadic existence in the jungle. Government policy is designed to bring all the Indians out of the forests and put them on reservations.\n\nAche Indians and Rain Forest (01:01)\n\nThe Ache were the first human inhabitants of the Canindeyu region. Ten thousand years of their history and culture are tied to the rain forest. The Ache survive only on what the forest provides.\n\nWork of Ache Women (01:07)\n\nNomadic Ache Indians move each day to find new hunting grounds. Women are the \"beasts of burden\" who cut wood, start cooking fires, prepare camp. Men hunt with traditional bows and arrows.\n\nAche Hunting Party (00:59)\n\nThe Ache kill the animals they can eat on a daily basis.\n\nHunter and Hunted (01:03)\n\nThe capuchin monkey is primary fare for the Ache, yet they are difficult to hunt. Ache hunting strategies are demonstrated in this segment.\n\nAche Hunters (01:02)\n\nWhen Ache hunters kill adult capuchins who leave babies behind, they capture the babies and adopt them. Ache women often suckle animals alongside their own children.\n\nTapir: Large Prey for Ache (01:13)\n\nThe largest animal the Ache hunt is the tapir. Women often wail at the kill site in honor of dead ancestors. The large tapir is cut up at the kill site, distributed among the hunters, and then carried back to camp.\n\nCelebratory Feast in Jungle (00:60)\n\nA large celebratory feast is prepared after the killing of the tapir. Smaller animals are boiled in pots; larger animals are cut up and put on roasting racks. Nothing from the animals is wasted.\n\nDiet of the Ache Indians (00:55)\n\nThe meat diet of the Ache Indians is supplemented with vegetation. All the parts of the palm are utilized not only as food, but also for mats, cooking sticks, and other implements.\n\nDietary Diversity (01:06)\n\nFor the Ache Indians, the most important part of the palm is the white shoot near the top. The Ache eat it raw. It has a sweet, nut-like taste and is an important source of calcium. The Ache also collect Insect larvae and berries.\n\nImportance of Honey in Ache Diet (00:56)\n\nSo keen is he vision of the Ache that they can spot a bee high in a tree. They chop down the tree to get at the honeycomb. At other times, the tribe smokes bees from their nests.\n\nFish in Ache Diet (01:01)\n\nWhen possible, the Ache camp near water. Fresh fish adds more variety to their diet. They make effective nets of branches to stretch across streams. The Ache form loose group structures in the forest that they enter or leave at will.\n\nSocial Structure of the Ache Indians (01:24)\n\nAmong the Ache, democratic principles hold the group together There is no designated chief. Leaders tend to arise naturally. The Ache do not hunt in the rain, as the moisture would soften their feet, making them vulnerable to cuts and infection.\n\nAncient vs. Modern Worlds (01:05)\n\nThe slow invasion of Ache land and the destruction of their traditional culture have trapped the Ache between two worlds. Paraguay has an inequitable system of land distribution.\n\nViolent Confrontations Over Land (01:57)\n\nBy the 1960s, previously remote areas underwent rapid development. As the Ache encountered settlers on the edges of their lands, hostilities arose. A generation of Ache once killed encroaching Paraguayans.\n\nAche: From Hunter-Gatherers to Farmers (00:60)\n\nIn 1978, the last of the indigenous tribes were brought out of the forest and put on reservations where the were encouraged to raise livestock and grow crops.\n\nReflections of a Changing World (00:60)\n\nThe Ache have no tradition of agriculture and little concept of free market economies. When trading with outsides, the Ache never get fair prices for their goods. Children once names for animals now have Spanish names too.\n\nCultural Education for Youth (01:08)\n\nOlder members of the Ache tribe use contests to keep skills like archery alive among the younger tribe members. Te young are losing the finely honed instincts required to live in the forest.\n\nAche: Evolutionary Changes (00:58)\n\nNot that the Ache are building their future outside the forest, many cultural and evolutionary changes are coming about. There is a new breed of young men who have experience with the outside world.\n\nAche Indians: Twenty-First Century Skills Needed (00:60)\n\nThe Ache need new skills to help them adapt to the outside world. Tribes meet together to discuss new machinery and techniques useful to them in agriculture. Like the Mennonites, the Ache may be able to developed farm cooperatives.\n\nMennonite Culture in Paraguay (02:12)\n\nMennonites produce all their own food. Surpluses are sold on local markets. They understand the laws of supply and demand, and unlike the Ache, they get fair prices for their products.\n\nThreat to Ache Indians' Future (01:11)\n\nIllegal, pirate logging companies pose the greatest threat to the Ache Indian culture. The forests around the Ache are gradually disappearing. Brazilians take down valuable hardwood trees without license or permission.\n\nRain Forest Destruction: Bribery and Corruption (01:32)\n\nForeign owners of rain forest lands also experience the loss of trees from thieves. A 1973 law states that the export of logs from Paraguay is illegal. Yet, the practice of taking wood out of Paraguay continues.\n\nEnd of the Rain Forest? (01:20)\n\nIf the present rate of logging and tree theft continues, the Paraguayan rain forest outside the preserves will be gone. Danger from accidents and guns is commonplace in South American logging camps. (Graphic footage of bodies)\n\nNon-Cooperation from Paraguayan Government (01:03)\n\nThe Paraguayan government does not strongly participate in stopping the decimation of the forests and the danger to tribes and outsiders like Scotsman Flemming Pettersen.\n\nIn League with Brazilians (01:26)\n\nThe destroyers of the rain forest in Paraguay are mostly Paraguayans in league with Brazilians. The Charipa Indians would rather die than leave the jungle.\n\nConfrontation: Loggers vs. Indians (01:02)\n\nA television crew takes footage of the confrontation between Indian and loges. A physical battle is avoided when loggers agree to stop logging. Nevertheless, logging resumes the next day.\n\nHigh-Level Protest Against Logging (01:34)\n\nCharipa Indians travel to Asuncion to stage a high-level protest against logging in the rain forest. For nearly two centuries, Paraguay has been ruled by a succession of dictators. Today, corruption is still widespread.\n\nGovernment Listens to Indians (01:01)\n\nThe Paraguayan government hears from foreign owners of rain forest and from indigenous cultures who live in the rain forests. It hears of death threats from gun-wielding Brazilians.\n\nInternational Exposure of Ache Plight (01:55)\n\nThe situation in Paraguay gets an international audience. Even Paraguayans themselves did not believe that Indians still inhabited the rain forest. Nothing came of the revelations. The government did nothing, fired no one, and offered no help.\n\nProtesters in Danger (00:60)\n\nMedia coverage temporarily stops logging activity. Officials send assassins to kill all protesters including Scotsman Flemming Pettersen. In Paraguay, life is cheap. No one is killed.\n\nGovernment Collusion in Rain Forest Destruction (01:13)\n\nMonths after Scotsman Flemming Pettersen returns to the Faroes, he hears that two Indian chiefs are in jail. Brazilians paid off the other Indians to stop them from protesting. Pettersen's books and film are used in Faroe Islands schools.\n\nViolent Confrontation Over Land Rights (01:32)\n\nRoving campesinos face loggers carrying false documents and who encroach on the Ache preserve. Not known for their violence, the Ache will protect their land.\n\nRoving Tribes Want Ache Land (01:24)\n\nCampesinos (farmers) look for some land to call their own. Yet, armed police stop them from engaging in violent confrontations. The campesinos want to take some of the Ache land.\n\nAche Indians Get a Tractor (00:21)\n\nScotsman Flemming Pettersen provides the Ache with a tractor, determined that their story should have a happy ending.\n\nWhat Is the Future for the Ache? (01:29)\n\nMaterially, the Ache have gained little since they left the forest. They have not yet been able to sustain themselves with food. Perhaps the arrival of modern technology will mark a new period of prosperity for the Ache."
