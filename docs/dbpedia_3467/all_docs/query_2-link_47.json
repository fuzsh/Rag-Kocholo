        "text": "ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Exploitation-film historian A.C. Nicholas, who has a sketchy background and hails from parts unknown in Western Pennsylvania, was once a drive-in theater projectionist and disk jockey. Currently, in addition to being a writer, editor, podcaster, and voice-over artist, he’s a regular guest co-host on the streaming Drive-In Asylum Double Feature and contributes to the Drive-In Asylum fanzine. His upcoming essay, “Of Punks and Stains and Student Films: A Tribute to Night Flight, the 80s Late-Night Cult Sensation,” will appear in Drive-In Asylum #26.\n\nValentine’s Day is here, and I’m going to enlighten—or annoy—you with 10 of my favorite romantic films. And because you know me, upbeat and happy-go-lucky, you know that the films are going to be dark and depressing. You won’t find When Harry Met Sally or Love Story on this list.\n\n10. Unfaithful, starring Richard Gere and Diane Lane and directed by Adrian Lyne, who also did Fatal Attraction, Indecent Proposal, Flashdance, Jacob’s Ladder, and Nine ½ Weeks. That’s quite an eclectic filmography from an unpredictable director. Unfaithful is a remake of La Femme Infidele directed by Claude Chabrol, often called the French Hitchcock. I usually hate American remakes of great foreign films, but this one’s an exception. Diane Lane, always charming and wonderful, is married to Richard Gere. Yet, one day, she has a meet cute with a handsome stranger and impulsively has an affair. This has disastrous consequences. My wife thought that Lane’s cheating on Gere, who she noted is the perfect husband as he does the dishes, was inconceivable. It’s a fascinating film with Lane’s best performance; she got an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. One more thing about Diane Lane: If you watch her rom-coms—and she’s done a bunch—there are always two Diane Lanes. At the beginning of the film, her hair is up in a frumpy bun, and she’s sad. Later, when she falls in love, her hair is down. The Lane Rule: hair up, sad, no boyfriend; hair down, happily and passionately in love, a rule first noted by, I believe, the late critic Roger Ebert.\n\n9. Leaving Las Vegas is a seriously depressing love story directed by the woefully underrated Mike Figgis with Nic Cage’s Oscar-winning turn as a depressed man who has come to Las Vegas to literally drink himself to death. He meets up with sex worker Elisabeth Shue, and they have a relationship of sorts. Will it be enough to save him? Don’t count on it.\n\n8. Michael Mann is a world-class director of such lauded fare as The Insider, Ali, and Heat. His first film, Thief, was one of the best debut films of any director ever. James Caan, never better, plays a master thief fresh out of prison, who decides to start a new life, which includes having a family with waitress Tuesday Weld, also never better. But before that happens, he must do one last job for Robert Prosky, playing one of the most realistic, scariest mobsters ever. This job is, of course, going to cause problems for Caan and Weld. If you haven’t seen Thief, be prepared for a beautiful looking and sounding (courtesy the score by German electronic group Tangerine Dream) masterpiece from one of my favorite directors. Added plus: It has some lessons on how to crack safes … if you’re so inclined.\n\n7. The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes. This Billy Wilder film, a big, expensive flop back in 1970, is a dark, yet moving, dramedy about a lost Sherlock Holmes case involving a woman’s missing husband, Queen Victoria, and the Loch Ness Monster. But central to the plot is a melancholy relationship between the misogynistic detective and a beautiful client, all punctuated by maestro Miklos Rozsa’s haunting violin concerto. Christopher Lee even shows up as Holmes’s brother Mycroft. Sad note: The studio, which was not high on the film, cut over an hour before release. This footage was lost and remains a grail quest for film buffs to this day.\n\n6. Breathless, another remake of a French film, starring Richard Gere and directed by still another underrated director, Jim McBride. Gere plays a charming drifter who likes the music of Jerry Lee Lewis and Silver Surfer comic books. One night, he steals a car, shoots a cop, and decides to hook up with an old girlfriend. As the cliché goes, nothing good can come of this.\n\n5. Sunset Boulevard. I had to include another film by Bill Wilder, the master of dark comedies (I could’ve also gone with Double Indemnity), and this one is on the National Film Registry of great American films. It’s narrated by William Holden, whom we first see lying face down in faded actress Gloria Swanson’s swimming pool. He tells the story of how he died. (I love movies that open in the middle of something, or as pretentious film scholars say, “in media res,” and then flash back to how we got there.) Phenomenal film.\n\n4. Badlands, Martin Sheen’s a killer, Sissy Spacek’s his teenage girlfriend, and they’re cutting a swath of violence across 1970s South Dakota. I was tempted to put Bonnie and Clyde, The Honeymoon Killers, or Natural Born Killers, also about criminals in love, in this spot, but I went with Terence Malick’s gorgeous, relatively unseen, downbeat masterpiece. A friend of mine watched it recently and thought it was too slow. I disagree. It’s a great film.\n\n3. The Voices. Ryan Reynolds plays a nice guy who works in a warehouse and is looking for love from the likes of Anna Kendrick and Gemma Arterton. Complicating his life is that he’s schizophrenic, and he hears voices—his dog and cat talk to him. The dog, of course, is the voice of reason, while the cat tries to get him to do bad things. (Both are voiced by Reynolds.) It’s an off-the-wall black comedy from Iranian director Marjane Satrapi, certainly not for all tastes, but Reynolds once again shows his range in a serio-comic role. And the film’s depiction of mental illness is unique: When Reynolds is on his meds, the world to him (and the movie) is a bright, candy-colored land; when he’s off his meds, everything looks like downtown Youngstown, Ohio. (Trust me. You don’t want to go there.) And stay tuned for one of the best end-credit sequences ever.\n\n2. Blue Velvet. David Lynch is a polarizing filmmaker. You either love or despise his movies; there’s no in-between. In his masterpiece Blue Velvet, college kid Kyle MacLachlan returns to his North Carolina hometown, falls in love with lounge singer Isabella Rossellini (bad girl) and Laura Dern (good girl), and runs afoul of Dennis Hopper in one of the greatest screen-villain performances ever. If you haven’t seen it, check it out. And if you hate it, don’t complain to me.\n\nAnd at #1, Body Heat, the first film written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan. Sleazy Florida lawyer William Hurt falls in with a classic femme fatale, Kathleen Turner in a stunning film debut, who eggs him on to kill her husband. It’s a film loaded with great performances (watch for Mickey Rourke as an arsonist), complicated plotting (there’s one point of estates law that just doesn’t make any sense), and some of the most quotable dialogue around. And I can’t forget to mention the perfect noirish score, all windchimes and saxophone, by the great John Barry. The film’s a modern classic.\n\nI hope I’ve turned you on to some new movies. Or at least gotten you to think about revisiting old favorites. A friend of mine once told me he thought movies were “the most mysterious art form.” The films prove that statement: They’re dark and depressing, but you can’t look away. The power of cinema.\n\nTHE TWILIGHT SAGA 15th Anniversary SteelBook® Collection 4K Ultra HD is available at Best Buy.\n\nThe series has made more that $3.34 billion dollars worldwide on a $401 million dollar budget. When these movies came out, there was nothing bigger. I’m not certain we have anything like these any longer that draw a teen and female audience to theaters. A reboot has been talked about but even with the 15th anniversary here, there’s no news.\n\nThere is this set which includes all five movies — Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn Part 1 and Part 2 — and wow, its packed with gorgeous SteelBook® packaging and so many extras, including a 6-part The Making of The Twilight Saga documentary.\n\nWant some extras from our site?\n\nHere’s the podcast we did years ago on the first movie:\n\nDid you ever know I went to Forks?\n\n“In the state of Washington, under a near constant cover of clouds and rain, there’s a small town named Forks. Population, 3,120 people. This is where I’m moving.” That’s what Bella Swan said when her mother hooked up with a minor league baseball pitcher and she ended up going across the country to live with her dad. As Bella prepared to move in, she felt only despair and a marked lack of joy. I completely understand how she felt and I was only traveling by car and ferry to see the town that the Twilight books and movies were based in.\n\nHere’s something I learned as I was researching my trip — after I took it, mind you. While Twilight and its sequels are set in the town, not a single scene was filmed there. Nope, most of the movies were filmed in Oregon and some parts of Washington. Not in Forks. Zillow.com even called the Forks Chamber of Commerce to verify this and learned that yes, not one scene was shot in the town.\n\nThat’s probably because the location is very remote. And Washington state doesn’t make it easy for people to film there, with no tax breaks or incentives, which is why the filmmakers mostly shot in Oregon, Vancouver and Louisiana.\n\nBut Sam, tell us about Forks.\n\nYou got it.\n\nForks is located in Clallam County in the Olympic Peninsula and was incorporated on August 28, 1945. It’s a small town — around 3,500 people — and gets its name because it is quite literally near the forks in the Quillayute, Bogachiel, Calawah, and Sol Duc rivers.\n\nPrior to what the internet told me was the town’s boom in tourism — more of that later — most people in the town are employed by the two jails and from sport fishing.\n\nSo you may wonder, how did I find myself on a ferry bound for the home of Edward, Bella and Jacob? Well, I love my wife. And I indulge her. And her aunt had suggested this. And soon, we’d be enjoying “27 minutes of our lives that we’d never get back,” to quote Becca.\n\nFirst off, the Forks High School looks nothing like the place where Edward saved Bella from that car, nor where they were lab partners. No, instead it’s a small school filled with teens that scowl instead of glow. After all, Twilight’s author Stephenie Meyer never visited Forks when writing any of the books.\n\nAcross the street, we noticed Leppell’s Flowers & Gifts, which was run by a nice-seeming older couple. As they were working on the concrete in front, we had to head around the back and go through an alley and a hidden door to find the store that some call Twilight Central. That’s when we noticed this tour bus!\n\nWe didn’t look into the tour and after spending just a bit of time looking at the scrapbook supplies, we bid the store farewell. Perhaps it’s just as well, as this amazing Yelp review did the store no favors.\n\nWe drove through the town some more, saw Bella’s truck (which probably wasn’t the one used in the movie), went in two more Twilight themed gift shops and then headed out of town to Thriftway/Forks Outfitters. For being in the midst of some of the greatest coffee in the world, we had the best coffee drinks of our entire trip at their cafe! And get this — a Twilight menu! That’s how you do business!\n\nThey had used Twilight movies and an actual rental store within this general store that seems to answer every need of the folks in Forks. Even better, their deli offers some choices for the discriminating Twilight fan, made of course with high quality Kretschmar deli meats and cheeses:\n\nWhy doesn’t Jacob get a panini? Where is Bella’s BLT? I have so many questions and once you’re in Forks, you never get any answers.\n\nAt least Becca got this lighter, which will keep her smoking for years after she has planned to quit:\n\nOn the way out of town and back to the ferry, an overall three-hour-plus trip, we stopped to get gas and caffeine. That’s when I met Forks, WA local favorite Barry, who had on no shirt and a jacket as he careened around the store, screaming at people that he was about to go to the casino (One Eyed Jacks?) and do some drugs. After that, he followed an employee outside who was about to cry and told her he was sorry about her sister, but some people have it coming. Barry seemed like a real pip.\n\nGoodbye, Forks! Thank you for showing us the place that inspired a movie that no one has really cared about since 2012. I kid — most of the people in town seemed genuinely nice and totally not about to kill us as we wandered their theme stores, ala Captain Spaulding from House of 1000 Corpses.\n\nWant to learn more about Forks?

He specifically gave me an assignment to do this.\n\nThis feels like something I’ve been preparing for my entire life.\n\nAs I said back when I covered every single Phantasm movie, I probably watched Phantasm II every single day once it came out on VHS. Imagine my surprise when the first movie doesn’t have anything from the second one, instead being one long nightmare without cool preparing for battle scenes and quad shotguns.\n\nNow, I can draw on my knowledge and my untold watches of these films to do some good for the world. It all pays off, all that time in my room when other teenage boys were fumbling around in the back of cars with girls.\n\nI mean, it pays off. I think it does.\n\nHere’s what I think this series about in question and answer format.\n\nWhat is Phantasm about?\n\nEach of the movies in the series is very much a different film so this is a difficult question to answer.\n\nBut for a very basic overview…\n\nAfter the death of their friend Tommy, Jody and his brother Michael discover that their small town’s mortician is actually an otherworldly villain known as the Tall Man. They attempt to stop his harvesting of dead bodies with the help of their best friend, Reggie.\n\nSure, that makes sense. But as you probably already know, this is a really confusing series.\n\nWhat is the first Phantasm really about?\n\nIn Cameron Gorman’s Collider article Phantasm Makes No Sense – and That’s Why It’s Great, there’s an interesting theory: It’s a movie about grief. Jody and Michael have lost their parents, so the only way that the teenage Michael can deal with their loss — and the idea that his brother will soon be leaving town — is by inventing his own villain, the Tall Man, whose unexplained nature is less frightening than the idea that death can happen at any time.\n\nBy the end, however, the darkness goes even more dim as it turns out that Jody has been dead all along and the events of the movie have all been Micheal trying to use horror to make sense of why he’s lost his entire family and is now alone.\n\nOr maybe not.\n\nSeriously, throughout, I feel like there are so many ways to see these movies that the explanation I offer is just mine. You’re going to see your own film your own way.\n\nBecause if it’s not a dream, then explain why the Tall Man reappears at the end.\n\nMike tells Reggie that he’s worried the Tall Man will come back. The ice-cream-selling guitarist replies, “Hey, you had a dream. Just a nightmare. Mike, that Tall Man of yours did not take Jody away.” And then the Tall Man really is real.\n\nEach movie seemingly ends like an old movie serial. We see the heroes surely die, the bad guy is still alive and that’s it. And then, there’s a sequel. It may take a decade. But there’s always another story. If you go with the dream logic theory, that covers you.\n\nWho is the Tall Man? What’s he all about?\n\nAccording to the Phantasm wiki, the Tall Man is either:\n\nJebediah Morningside, who started as a mild-mannered 19th-century mortician. After years of burying dead people, he became fascinated by the connection between our world and the world of the dead. He made a machine that allowed him to travel through time and space. After his first journey, he came back changed forever and became the Tall Man.\n\nThe Red Planet, a living planet twenty times bigger than our sun that exists out and above time, space, reality, gravity and narrative lines. He takes on a human form to go to Earth to kidnap people for the purpose of transforming them into monsters.\n\nHis weaknesses are cold and tuning forks. The reason for the latter being harmful is because he travels to our world via the Dimensional Fork. It consists of two short chrome poles standing right next to one another that are humming at all times. The sound of another tuning fork disrupts him. That said, when the Tall Man dies, he is instantly replaced by another one. He also has a disease inside him which can kill humans on contact.\n\nSo who is the Lady In Lavender?\n\nTommy, whose death starts this whole thing in motion, was killed by a gorgeous blonde known as the Lady In Lavender. Well, she’s the Tall Man. Or some aspect of him. Yes, the same Angus Scrimm can transform into the much more pleasing form of actress Kathy Lester. She usually seduces men, then stabs them. In the first movie, she’s knocked out by a tuning fork, which is also the weakness of anyone from the Tall Man’s adopted home dimension.\n\nIn Phantasm V: Ravager, Reggie goes back in time to the 19th century and meets the Lady In Lavender, who is co-joined to Jebediah Morningside, the dude who will become the Tall Man. He later finds her inside a mausoleum and her face becomes demonic when he doesn’t sleep with her. He then shoots her with a shotgun.\n\nSo maybe she’s part of the Tall Man. Or maybe not.\n\nWhen people are fucking the Lady In Lavender, they’re fucking the Tall Man. Right?\n\nLet’s not kink shame. But yeah. Totally.\n\nWhat’s Reggie’s deal?\n\nDon Coscarelli wrote that Reggie is “every guy’s guy, every man’s friend, the guy that would throw himself on the flames to the door of hell to save a friend.”\n\nHe’s an ice cream seller who will just drop in to write a song.\n\nI’ve always through that Reggie sells more than just ice cream, which is how he can so easily roll with the wildness of these movies. He’s also one of those weed friends that will hang out just to see what happens and also has strange skills that seemingly do nothing to help anyone, like being able to make four-barrelled sawed-off shotguns. Where does one gain those skills? Vo-Tech?\n\nIn the first movie, Reggie dies when he finally gets to get laid. That Lady In Lavender again. But then he’s alive and takes Mike on a road trip, because after all this, why not? The same thing happens in the second movie, because Alchemy ends up being another of the women that the Tall Man uses to attack men. Somewhere in here, Reggie got married and had a child, but the Tall Man’s Lurkers blew them up real good. In the third movie, Reggie goes it alone for a long time before reuniting with Mike, just in time to get trapped by one of the Sentinels, the steel balls. The fourth movie has the Tall Man playing a final game with Reggie as they chase each other for the entire movie. And in the fifth film, there are two Reggies. One is dying in a nursing home and the other is in a post-apocalyptic future where the Tall Man has won.\n\nAs they say on The Cannon Canon, we’ll get into that.\n\nTell me about Jody.\n\nJody and Reggie had a band with Tommy. They learn that the Tall Man has turned their dead friend into a Lurker, one of his smashed-down Jawa-like servants. By the end of the first movie, it comes out that Jody has been dead all along and Reggie promises to be Mike’s brother.\n\nAfter being dead in the second movie, Jody returns as a damaged silver ball in the third movie. He can speak to Reggie and tells him “Seeing is easy. Understanding takes a little more time.” He promises to return when he can. In the fourth movie, he reveals that he died in the car wreck after being stabbed by his brother. And in the fifth, Jody is said to be dead, but shows up for Reggie’s funeral while he has transformed the Hemicuda into a Battlecuda and rescues Mike and Reggie, happy that they are a threesome again.\n\nAnd Mike?\n\nMike survives the end of the first movie and ends up being a second actor for the sequel, James Le Gros, instead of A. Michael Baldwin, who is in the other films. He’s destined to find Liz, a girl who dreams of him, but she dies at the start of the third movie. By the end of that movie, the Tall Man’s miniature maniacs have eaten Liz and Mike has yellow blood like the Tall Man, as well as a sphere inside his head.\n\nAccording to the Phantasm wiki, Mike discovers he has powers such as telekinesis and the ability to conjure dimensional forks. He attempts to commit suicide but then he learns that in 1979, he and his brother were going to hang the Tall Man and Mike saved him.\n\nWhen Mike goes back in time in the fourth movie, he inspires Jebediah Morningside to create his machine that turns him into the Tall Man, who early said that his life is the main dimension of the Tall Man and that they are connected forever. He’s able to kill the Tall Man with a bomb but another one soon arrives and removes the sphere, killing Mike.\n\nIn the last movie, Mike wheels Reggie around the nursing home yet can remember being in the post-apocalyptic world.\n\nWhat are the silver balls?\n\nThe Sentinels are the weapons that the Tall Man uses to suck out brains. They come from a dream that Don Coscarelli had. There are several varieties:\n\nSilver ball: Made from the brains of dead human beings — which are inside the ball, the bodies are turned into the mindless crushed Lurkers — these are the guardians of the Tall Man and also keys that he uses to open doorways.\n\nGold ball: The two gold balls in the movies have had the Tall Man and Mike’s brains in them. They have much better defenses and are much smarter.\n\nBlack ball: When Jody’s brain is put inside one of the Sentinels, it becomes black, which is a symbol that he is independent.\n\nRed ball: A bomb.\n\nGiant ball: Used in the last movie to blow up cities.\n\nDo any of these movies actually work together?\n\nDuring the third movie, Don Coscarelli said that he had run out of ideas after finishing the script and had no clue which direction the story would take in case there was a fourth edition. He jokingly added that if a Phantasm IV was ever filmed, it would actually be just to make money out of it.\n\nThere are two more movies. Fill in your own blank.\n\nBreak down your theories — in short a way as possible as this is already eighteen hundred words — on each movie.\n\nPhantasm: A low budget film that gets magic right the first time. Nothing has to make sense — it’s very Italian in that way — and you can either watch it as a horror movie with a straight-ahead story fo trying to stop an evil undertaker or a movie that tries to make sense of death. What is strange about it is how many scenes just feel thrown in — the bug that comes flying around, the magic trick finger with yellow blood, the Dune fortune teller and her granddaughter who never show up again, the song that everyone chills out and jams on, even the ending — but it’s the rough edges that make it so great.\n\nPhantasm II: Universal wanted a new franchise that had the things they saw that worked. Not the dreamy artiness, but the gory balls and the improvised weapons. That’s what they got. And in 1988, well, this was what I wanted so badly. It’s got so many wild and bloody moments, metal anti-religious moments and the Tall Man saying, “You think that when you die you go to Heaven… you come to us!”\n\nI was beyond obsessed with this movie.\n\nPhantasm III: Lord of the Dead: Sadly, this feels like running in circles compared to the first two movies. Liz getting killed ruins a lot of the second movie, ala Hicks and Newt being dead when Alien 3 kicks in. It’s not a bad movie, but there’s not much here that you need to see again. I do like Rocky, who is the only female character that doesn’t become evil.\n\nPhantasm IV: Oblivion: The third film was not well thought of, so Coscarelli went back to the low budget weird horror of the original. There was also a lot of lost footage that was found, so that all added up to make the fourth movie.\n\nI wish we had gotten the Roger Avery-written Phantasm’s End AKA Phantasm 1999 A.D, which has this awesome summary: “The year is 2012 and there are only three U.S. states left. Between New York and California is the wasteland known as the Plague Zone. Unfortunately, the evil Tall Man controls that area. Since many people are dead, the Tall Man is able to make thousands of dwarf slaves for his planet daily in the Mormon Mausoleum. Besides him, the other residents are “baggers,” human-like creatures that are infected by the Tall Man’s blood, the dwarves, and, of course, the silver spheres, all trying to break out of the barrier that contains them and into the real world. A group of hi-tech troops are sent in to destroy the red dimension where the Tall Man gets his power. Reggie follows so he can find Mike after a series of nightmares he had. Will they be able to finally destroy the Tall Man for good?”\n\nBruce Campbell would have been in that.\n\nThe scenes with Jennifer’s breasts being silver balls and Mike ends up in a deserted future Los Angeles where Jody tells him it’s not safe to be out too long due to a disease come from the Avery script.\n\nThis movie feels like it’s trying to find an explanation by confusion. It’s all one unending over and over again reality where the Tall Man causes Mike to spend his life trying to stop him and he ends up creating him.\n\nPhantasm V: Ravager: I think that there was such a demand for a final film, it just had to be made. According to the book Phantasm Exhumed, it was originally a spin-off web series that was titled Reggie’s Tales. This footage was eventually expanded with new footage that featured appearances by main cast members and became the fifth movie.\n\nWhen I watched this again, it felt like it had too many echoes of Bubba Ho-Tep. It makes me question if we want to see our heroes become old and infirm, as I had to watch it happen to my father and spent years trying to talk to someone who was no longer there.\n\nAnyways, I feel like this is some ancient parable.\n\nHere’s how it works.\n\nPhantasm is a kid trying to make sense of death while over the course of the other movies trying to do everything it can to stop death from claiming him, his family and friends.\n\nBy Phantasm V: Ravager, it’s now an old man, looking back on life and accepting the inevitability of death.\n\nAre the movies connected at all?\n\nOther than the fact that the same characters are in all of them, it feels like the main connection is using the same footage. They are all in their own subgenre:\n\nPhantasm: Surreal dream logic art horror\n\nPhantasm II: Action horror\n\nPhantasm III: Lord of the Dead: Comedy horror with some Raimi\n\nPhantasm IV: Oblivion: Low budget return to the surreal dream logic horror but made by someone who isn’t in the same place they were 20 years ago.\n\nPhantasm V: Ravager: Fan film with a budget.\n\nHave the Phantasm characters shown up anywhere else?\n\nAngus Scrimm did this Adult Swim ad.\n\nFarewell to the Alamo Drafthouse: In this short video, footage between the Tall Man and Mike was teased years before the last movie. It may have actually been footage from the Steven Romano scripted Phantasm Forever that would have had Mike waking from seemingly being in a coma for years with Dr. Morningside at his side. Rocky was to return and Ashley Laurence from Hellraiser fame would have appeared. But how about this: A. Michael Baldwin’s Mike and James LeGros’ Mike would have faced off.\n\nMike Tyson Mysteries: The episode “Mystery On Wall Street” has one of Mike’s drivers get abducted by Phantasm (Jeff Bergman), who is the Tall Man.\n\nWhat movies reference or are influenced by Phantasm?\n\nArrebato has a movie theater advertising this movie.\n\nThe Boxer’s Omen\n\nThe Dead Pool: Director Peter Swan’s movie clip is from Phantasm.\n\nA Nightmare On Elm Street\n\nTroll 2: The dream feel and mirror smashing at the end feel way too close to be not an influence. Also Claudio Fragasso is not above just taking things from movies and I say that with peace and love.\n\nIn the Mouth of Madness: The tagline for Sutter Cane’s book The Hobb’s End Horror is “If this book doesn’t scare you to death, you are already dead. ” Phantasm‘s tagline was “If this one doesn’t scare you, you’re already dead!”\n\nSpider-Man 2: Doc Ock’s pincers in one scene are shot to look like one of the Sentinels. Maybe that’s payback for Sam Raimi’s ashes showing up in Phantasm II.\n\nIn the Strangest Places: A character is named Phanni and the fortune teller scene is remade.\n\nStar Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens: The silver Captain Phasma is named for Phantasm.\n\nPsycho Goreman: PG calls Luke boyyyyyyy.\n\nSatan’s Slave: This Indonesian movie is a loose remake.\n\nSupernatural: The Winchester brothers driving in a Chevy Impala chasing demons feels a little bit indebted.\n\nCharmed: In the episode “Wrestling With Demons,” Mr. Kellman (Ron Perlman) shows up to use the Sentinels and Buff Bagwell, Booker T and Scott Steiner wrestle in Hell.\n\nWhat songs sample the Phantasm theme or parts of the movie?\n\nS’Express – “Coma II”\n\nEntombed – “Left Hand Path”\n\nMr. Bungle – “Squeeze Me Macaroni” has the Tall Man saying, “Boyyyyy…”\n\nThe line “The funeral is about to begin” is in Marduk’s “Hearse,” “Mortician” by Mortician, “7th Angel” and “Funeral Procession” by the Electric Hellfire Club, Splatterhouse’s “Maggot Sermon” and Cold War’s “Scars Left As Evidence.”\n\n“Stomp the shit out of the Tall Man” is in “Guilty of Being Tight” by Municipal Waste\n\n3 Six Mafia – “Late Night Tip”\n\nDoug E Fresh & The Get Fresh Crew – “Play This Only At Night”\n\nMobb Deep – “The Nighttime G.O.D. Pt. III” and “There That Go (Alchemist Remix)”\n\nRussian Meatsquats – “Let’s Hang Out”\n\nWhite Throne – “Vengeance Rising”\n\nTormentor – “Intro”\n\nIron Maiden – “Mother Russia”\n\nTommy Wright III – “Don’t Start No Shit”\n\nReggie Banister – “Have You Seen It?”\n\nBuckethead – “Mausoleum Door”\n\nKing Louie – “Difference”\n\nWhat’s your Phantasm theory?\n\nLet me know in the comments.\n\nReferences in this article\n\nPhantasm.com.
