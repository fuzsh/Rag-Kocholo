        "text": "Introducing Mystery Class #4--Asuncion, Paraguary\n\n( 25.267 S, 57.667 W)\n\nGreetings from American School of Asuncion,\n\nin Asuncion, Paraguay!\n\nSection A, seated along the middle school outdoor hallway. The open door is our class room.\n\nSection C, pictured near the new elementary playground. Section B, pictured on the big soccer field (Cancha), with some of the school buildings in the background\n\nOur School-- \"Home of the Gators\"\n\nWe are the sixth grade students of the American School of Asuncion in Asuncion, Paraguay, \"Home of the Gators\". In sixth grade, we have 36 students in three sections. Above are some pictures of us in our sections. We have only 10 girls in our entire grade 6 class!\n\nThe school has about 650 students in grades K-4 to grade 12. We have elementary, middle school, and high school all on the same campus.\n\nOur classes are in English and Spanish. We also have a class in Guarani, our country's second official language. When we graduate, we get a diploma from the USA and one from Paraguay.\n\nYou can learn more about our school on our website\n\nThe security gate at our school.\n\nThe playground for our younger students.\n\nOur Country\n\nWe are located in the South American Country of Paraquay, which sits south of Brazil and Bolivia, and northeast of Argentina.\n\nOur City: Asuncion\n\nOur city is quite small for a capital city. There are many soccer fields and we all love soccer! The river you saw in the picture we sent before is of the Rio Paraguayo. We also have malls, movie theatres, some apartment buildings, and many houses. Although main roads in Asuncion are made of concrete, the city also has many roads made of stones.\n\nHere is the Skyline of Asuncion\n\nClimate\n\nThe climate in Asuncion is hot most of the year. Our seasons are the opposite of yours in the Northern Hemisphere, so we go on summer vacation during December! The temperature can reach as high as 50šC in the summer and as low as 5šC in winter. That might not seem very cold but our buildings do not have heat or insulation so it can feel very cold! It does not snow in Paraguay at all.\n\nBirds\n\nThere are many different kinds of birds here in Paraguay. We even see a lot of parrots flying around our schools and homes. Here are photos of a toucan and some parrots. The parrots can also be very noisy.\n\nWe had a great time being a Mystery Class. We hope you visit us sometime."
