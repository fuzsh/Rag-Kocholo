        "text": "Release Date\n\nApril 14, 2011\n\nRunning Time\n\n27:12\n\nPrevious Review\n\nNext Review\n\nTagline\n\nIn this special episode, The Cinema Snob spotlights one of the most controversial horror films of all time.\n\nLink\n\nThe following transcript, while still incomplete as of this writing, is NSFW due to descriptions of extreme violence, including but not limited to its title card.\n\nWe fade in on Detective Bola (Jerrid Foiles) driving across the city of Springfield, IL. The opening titles appear over it, with the theme from today's movie serving as the soundtrack. Jerrid stops the car, gets out, and approaches someone's doorstep. He knocks on the door and stands patiently, waiting for the homeowner. Jillian Zurawski opens the door.\n\nJillian: Yes?\n\nBola: (Removes his sunglasses) Mrs. Snob?\n\nJillian: (Rolls her eyes) I have a name, goddamnit.\n\nBola: Big Box Model?\n\nJillian: (Rolls her eyes again whilst sighing) For fuck's sake, \"Mrs. Snob\" is fine.\n\nBola: I'm Detective Bola. I'm the man hired to find your missing husband.\n\nJillian: Brad's missing? Sorry, I've been asleep. There's been a lot less yelling in the house lately, so I've been trying to take advantage of how quiet it is.\n\nBola: Yeah, your neighbors noticed this, too. That's why they called me. With no cursing or screaming, or obscure references being heard through the neighborhood, they just assumed your husband was missing.\n\nJillian: (Sighs) Okay. Let's run with it. Come inside. (She and Bola walk in, and he notices Brad's chair)\n\nBola: So this where your husband normally sits?\n\nJillian: I wouldn't sit there if I were you. He's been naked in that chair on more than one occasion.\n\nBola: Oh, I'm fine. Thank you.\n\nJillian: Would you like some water?\n\nBola: Yes, please. (As Jillian walks out of the room, he leans toward the chair and sniffs it) Ahhhhhhhhhh--\n\nJillian: (Upon coming back with a red Solo cup full of water) You sniffed the chair, didn't you?\n\nBola: (Scoffing) NO!\n\nJillian: (Sighs again) Here. (She hands Bola the water, and he drinks it)\n\nBola: This water tastes like Cola.\n\nJillian: Yeah, well, he only has Crystal Pepsi flowing through our pipes.\n\nBola: Well, that's stupefyingly nostalgic.\n\nJillian: Tell me about it. (She and Bola sit down on Brad's couch)\n\nBola: So...what can you tell me about your husband, uh... Brad? (He pulls out a notepad and begins writing)\n\nJillian: He's a failed exploitation filmmaker who got lucky doing Internet comedic reviews, making fun of movies that are a lot worse than his.\n\nBola: Sounds like you two are close.\n\nJillian: The most of me he's seen in the last few months are my tits whenever he looks at his website.\n\nBola: (Gets up) Mind if I check the backyard for clues? (Puts the notepad back in his jacket)\n\nJillian: (Gets up as well) Do what you like. But I better warn you: gunfights and karate showdowns have been known to go on back there.\n\nWe cut to the Jones' backyard, where Bola puts his sunglasses back on and surveys the landscape. He walks over to bags of garbage, while also making sure to kick a basketball out of the way. Next to the bags, he finds a VHS tape. Bola picks it up, and we see that it has no labels or any other identifying marks whatsoever. Cut back inside, where Bola shows off the tape.\n\nBola: Jackpot!\n\nJillian: What's that?\n\nBola: (Puts the tape down as it zooms in on his face) A VHS tape! Surely it contains Brad's last few moments alive!\n\nJillian: Whoa whoa whoa! Now you're saying my husband is dead?\n\nBola: When we find a tape at a crime scene, that's always the conclusion we go to!\n\nJillian: Hey dipshit, look around you. (Pan across Brad's collection) It's not that hard to find VHS tapes in here.\n\nBola: (As he looks at the cassette) No, no, this tape is gonna contain all the information I need in solving this case.\n\nJillian: He doesn't even shoot on VHS! Why the hell would his footage be on there?\n\nBola: Convenience. It's much easier for me to find a VHS tape in the backyard than a memory card.\n\nJillian: (Sighs) Fine. (Sits on the couch and crosses her arms) Put the tape in.\n\nBola puts the tape in the VCR and sits on the couch next to Jillian. After a shot of the TV, color bars appear on screen, then we get a title card reading \"Brad's Last Moments Alive.\"\n\nBola: Tuh. See? What did I tell you?\n\nJillian: Yes. Gloat that my husband is dead.\n\nAfter a \"film start\" intro, we see Brad's closet.\n\nCameraman (VO): Oh, don't see here, where's our star? Hello?\n\nBrad Jones/Snob: Tuh. Hey. (Brad puts his glasses on, and the cameraman chuckles)\n\nCameraman (VO): Hey there, shoot. Got your hair slicked back?\n\nBrad: Well, it's not as easy as it was in the early days. Now I have to get all this shit done before it starts... poofing out like static electricity.\n\nBola: Who's that talking with him?\n\nJillian: Uh... the director, I guess?\n\nBola: Your husband uses a director?\n\nJillian: Not usually.\n\nWe now see Brad on the toilet, with a cigarette in his right hand and a film effect over the footage\n\nBrad: I don't know if I can do Cannibal Holocaust, man.\n\nCameraman (VO): (Laughs mildly) What? Is it too bad even for the Cinema Snob?\n\nBrad: No, it's not that. It's not that at all. (Slides his glasses onto his face) It's just that this movie is disturbing. It's one of the most disturbing movies ever made.\n\nJillian: Hey, he said he quit smoking!\n\nCameraman (VO): Yeah, but... you've done disturbing.\n\nBrad: And people watch this shit to...laugh, to...be entertained, not to be... (Wipes his nose) mentally tortured, is all shit.\n\nCameraman (VO): (Chuckles) Well, if that's the case, why do...Bloodsucking Freaks? Salo? Uh, Island of the Dead? Fucking Horrifying Experiments of the S.S.' Last Days!\n\nBrad: Those movies didn't have directors who had to prove to a federal judge that he didn't kill his actors. This is like... it's like doing a Snob video off of I Spit on Your Grave. (Rests his hand on his chin for a while)\n\nCameraman (VO): Which you should do.\n\nBrad: Pfft. How do I snob a 45-minute rape scene?\n\nCameraman (VO): Pfft. Uh... okay, George Carlin once said that... a person can make even rape funny.\n\nBrad: Yeah...when it's Elmer Fudd and Porky Pig. (Scratches his head) I'm not gonna get into I Spit on Your Grave now. (Gets up)\n\nJillian: Why are they talking in the bathroom? I hate when people try and put a plotline in the reviews.\n\nBrad is now at his chair, ready to become the Snob\n\nCameraman: Alright, we're rollin', buddy.\n\nBrad: We're on?\n\nCameraman: Yup.\n\nBrad: (Uncrosses his legs and reaches for some papers) Okay. Cannibal Holocaust, one of the most controversial... this is, this is gonna be a voiceover, by the way.\n\nFilm footage\n\nBrad (VO): Cannibal Holocaust is truly one of the most powerful and shocking horror films ever made. Showing up on several lists of controversial films throughout history, Cannibal Holocaus--\n\nCameraman (VO): Wait, wait, what are you doing?\n\nBrad (VO): I'm talkin' about Cannibal Holocaust.\n\nCameraman (VO): W-- you're giving your opinion on it; don't give your opinion on it, give the Snob's opinion.\n\nBrad (VO): (Chuckling) Sorry, I... I get those confused sometimes. Alright, alright, I'm ready, let's start it.\n\nThe film's title zooms out onto a black background, and not long after, \"The men you will see eaten alive, are the same men who filmed these incredible sequences\"\n\nSnob (VO): Cannibal Holocaust?! The fuck kind of title is that?! (Cut to film clips) It isn't graphic-sounding enough with the word \"cannibal\" in your title?! You have to add the word \"holocaust\" in there for good measure?!\n\nSnob: The fuck's the point? How about I call a movie Extinction Rapist, and see how many smiles that title dishes out!\n\nThe opening titles play\n\nSnob (VO): Well, this doesn't seem so bad. Listen to the theme; it's beautiful! How could a movie with a love theme like this POSSIBLY be one of the most shocking movies of all time?\n\nSnob: It's a foreign movie... maybe the title is supposed to translate to \"funocaust.\" (Puts his hand on his chin, again) ...although it does still have \"cannibal\" in the title. Eh, the movie Hannibal proved that cannibalism can still be funny.\n\nBola: First!\n\nJillian: What the hell?\n\nBola: I'm the first person to comment on this review! (Jillian rolls her eyes)\n\nSnob (VO): We flew out to the Amazon, and goddamn, we're gonna film it. I think they're just scouting locations for Guyana: Cult of the Damned. (Later in the credits) Ohh-oh shit, it's goin' faster! They're getting chased by Reb Brown and Lou Ferrigno! (Cut to...) The movie then switches over to New York City with a local news story talking about man, and his conquests.\n\nReporter: What seemed to be unthinkable undertakings yesterday, are history today. The conquest of the moon, for example; who talks about it anymore?\n\nSnob (VO): (Scoffs mildly) Nobody, I guess, since the movie Apollo 18 got delayed! (More shots of NYC) The news story tells of four documentary filmmakers who left for an expedition to document Amazonian cannibal tribes, as we see here on this cardboard cutout of a TV.\n\nCut to a construction site\n\nReporter 2: And what about you, Alan?\n\nAlan (Gabriel Yorke): Well, there's only one thing that scares me. (Puts his arm around a nearby woman) And that's marriage! (A laugh track plays over it)\n\nSnob: (Removes his glasses) Tfft. Careful with that laugh track; we need it for the next 80's Dan. (He and the cameraman laugh)\n\nSnob (VO): Honestly, I'm not buying that they've gone missing. They got Chuck Norris with them! If these people didn't come back, then there's a reason that Chuck wanted them vanished!\n\nCut to a biplane flying\n\nReporter (VO): Those are the last pictures we have of them.\n\nSnob (VO): Heh, yes, from a mysterious cameraman randomly filming their plane flying away! (Cut to a park) A rescue team is assembled to find the filmmakers, led by Dr. Harold Monroe, played by Robert Kerman. Jesus, Robert, you couldn't have shaved the pornstache for this one?\n\nSnob: Should I say who he is?\n\nCameraman (VO): Sure, we want the kids to know.\n\nSnob: (After putting his glasses back on) Alright, alright. Robert Kerman was also a pornographic actor at the time. Some of you might remember him (Still of...) as Mr. Greenfield from Debbie Does Dallas!\n\nJillian: My husband watches porn?\n\nBola: You really don't know anything about your husband, do you? (Jillian just sits there silently, then we cut to cannibals eating human bones, with some skin and guts still on them)\n\nSnob (VO): Before the rescue team arrives, the cannibals just...chomp away freely! Mmmmmmm, original recipe! They're not giving away their secret ingredient! (Cut to a man on a boat) But Louis Gossett Jr. and his Strike Commandos don't stand for cannibalism in their jungles!\n\nHe shoots at a cannibal, who runs away\n\nCommando: Aiyuden! (?)\n\nSnob (VO): Soon enough, Dr. Monroe arrives by plane. (They both wave at each other)\n\nSnob: Okay, so when will it be appropriate for me to say \"touchdown, Debbie?\" (He and the cameraman both chuckle)\n\nCameraman (VO): Give it time.\n\nSnob: Alright.\n\nSnob (VO): Monroe meets with the commandos and-- (The lead commando swats his arm) Shit! He just killed two flies! Well, there's no other creatures that get needlessly harmed in this! (Cut outside) Monroe is quickly assigned a guide.\n\nChaco (Salvatore Basile): We gonna need some weapons, some ammunition, plus some medicine; that's all we need.\n\nSnob (VO): (Imitating Chaco) And a stereotypical accent.\n\nChaco: He's the son of a shaman, and he's been consecrated to the spirit of the jaguar.\n\nCut to the end of an Atari Jaguar commercial, then back to Monroe and his crew\n\nSnob (VO): The group uses one of the captured Yukomo tribesmen to lead them to the rest of his people, and to also carry the bulk of their luggage.\n\nChaco: Dying in time! (?)\n\nMonroe: Oh, that's terrific.\n\nGuide: Check his rights, senor. This guy's unpaid. That means if you don't look, he'll slit your throat. (As he says this, it suddenly cuts to the next shot)\n\nSnob (VO): Yeah, or he'll slit the end of that scene. So far, nothing out of the ordinary seems to be happening, except when they happen upon the set of Fulci's Zombi 2! (Monroe gets up and turns toward a skeleton, with worms crawling out of its eyes and most of its organs decayed)\n\nSnob: (As he looks at his script pages) ...you can go ahead and cut it, I'm just memorizing the next part.\n\nJillian: Interesting how half of this review is edited and the other half is raw footage.\n\nBola: I halfway edit stuff all the time and put it onto a tape!\n\nJillian: (Looks at him with disdain) You do?\n\nBola: Sure. Makes for an interesting narrative.\n\nSnob (VO): The group then witnesses the execution of an adulteress and... (Cut to the adulteress [Eva Bravo] being tortured in mud) Wait a minute. (Freeze-frame) That's a white girl!\n\nSnob: They put mud on a white girl to make her look like... you know, that's something when no one of a specific race wants to play the part!\n\nOne of the tribesmen picks up a rock\n\nSnob (VO): Oh, God, please tell me he's making pottery!\n\nSnob: (Sounding defeated) No, he's not. There's no pottery. There's not even a relaxing mud bath. I sure hope this scene ends happily.\n\nIt doesn't, as the girl has her head violently bashed with a rock. We then cut to the Snob, glasses off, rubbing his face.\n\nCameraman (VO): You know, you are the exploitation guy.\n\nSnob: I know.\n\nJillian: Wow, Brad.\n\nSnob (VO): The group uses the tribesmen to lure out... (As Yare takes off his pants) what the hell? Is he gonna rape him?\n\nChaco: If Yare pulls this off, I swear, I'll buy him a bottle of whiskey.\n\nSnob (VO): But if he doesn't pull this off, I'll give him a Big Flats. (Tribesmen take their shots) In order to get in good with the Yukomos, all you gotta do is just stand naked and let them shoot at you! (Cut to the Yukomo village) The group makes its way to the village, where they find clues as to what happened with the filmmakers, including a native who has been shot in the leg.\n\nSnob: All Monroe has to do now is just convince them that a Coke bottle did that!\n\nSnob (VO): Peace is made with the tribe, though, when they show them how to properly be in a street gang!\n\nA tribesman successfully flicks a switchblade, and his fellow natives cheer\n\nChaco: This would be easy. (?)\n\nSnob (VO): As they move deeper into the jungle, they happen upon more sinister music. (Monroe and Chaco look onward as a cannibal hauls a tree over to a campfire) God, something terrible is gonna happen. (A woman falls from a tree and lands on the ground, bloodied) Yep. (A tribal war begins) Monroe and his men witness a war between the tribes Yanamomo and Shamatari, which they break up with the power of \"I have a fucking GUN!\" (A Shamatari tribesman falls over) Is it just me, or is...Kerman looking more and more like Jason Statham? He's gonna drive out of this jungle at 100 miles per hour in a Seventies Mustang! (Monroe, now naked, wades into the river) But it's Kierman, so instead, he nails all the Yanamomo chicks!\n\nSnob: (Takes off his glasses) Can I say \"touchdown, Debbie\" now?\n\nCameraman: (As the Snob puts his glasses back on) Yes. Yes, you may.\n\nSnob: Nice. (Over a censored still of Monroe and a few of the Yanamomo women, \"Touchdown Cannibal Debbies!\" is shown, complete with a \"boing\" sound effect)\n\nSnob (VO): But soon after, Monroe sees them worshipping the lost film reels. Joke's on them; it's actually a copy of Corky Romano! The only way he can get the film canisters back is to now impress the Yanamomos, which he does by firing at the big ball in the sky, and playing some sweet tunes on his radio. (A tribal chant plays, and tribesmen come out) Oh shit, it's their fucking choice, son! Oh yeah, and did I also say he has to have dinner with them? (Monroe is fed some organs) That's right; liver with a side of more liver!\n\nCameraman: (Notices the Snob writing on a notepad) Uh, whatcha writin' there?\n\nSnob: Some ideas for the next Brad Tries.\n\nCameraman: Oh, dude, come on!\n\nSnob: (Puts the notepad away) Oh, what, like it'd be any more offensive than Nazi cola?!\n\nSnob (VO): The footage is brought back to New York City, where, sight-unseen, the TV studio wants to put it on the air.\n\nMonroe: But before I make any...decision on this, I'd like to review all the film material, as yet, we've seen none of it.\n\nSnob (VO): Pretty sure this is how $h*! My Dad Says got on the air. But first, Monroe watches a previous documentary from the filmmakers, called The Last Road to Hell.\n\nSnob: And I'm not making this up. It features stock footage of actual executions! Comedy show!\n\nTo be continued"
