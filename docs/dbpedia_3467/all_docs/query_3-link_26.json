        "text": "Production support for filming in Paraguay\n\nFilming in Paraguay, you will find yourself a millionaire! Working with our video production company in Paraguay pays off, but we mean literally. One euro equals 7,000 Guarani, so you will walk off a rich man after your first visit to an ATM.\n\nYou might even hang on to more of those Guarani than you originally thought, as the country is famous for its low cost of living. To make the same economy with your film budget, choose our video production services. We will connect you to a production coordinator who can plan your budget, keep recordings of spending and control it.\n\nProduction support & video production services in Paraguay\n\nParaguay is a bilingual nation – speaking Guaraní first and Spanish second. Guaraní is an onomatopoeic language. Its words imitate water splashes or animal sounds. When it comes to documentary filming, we all speak the same language. Many filmmakers come to Paraguay to capture 1000 different types of birds, including America’s largest feline cat – the jaguar, ocelots, panthers, the pampas fox, monkeys, and parakeets.\n\nWhatever animal you are interested in, we offer film location scouting services so you can capture them in an ideal setting. Work with our video production company in Paraguay to find a local production assistant with an international mindset.\n\nFilm crew for hire & local contributors\n\nWhen filming in Paraguay, you do not need to preoccupy yourself with the call sheet or the names on it. We can manage both by finding you a talented team.\n\nResearch & fact-checking\n\nYour corporate video requires preparation and accurate information. We can make sure it presents reality, as part of our post-production services as a top video production company in Paraguay.\n\nFilm permits & local access\n\nFor production support including film permits in Paraguay, look no further than Storytailors. We can make sure you have all the documentation in place, including work permits or travel visas.\n\nLocation scouting & management\n\nOur film location manager will find, lock down and maintain the setting of your commercial video production. They work diligently, under tight deadlines to secure locations before production starts.\n\nFilm equipment rental\n\nOur collaborators will arrange for you to have the best lens rental. Thus, you will be able to capture Paraguay’s beautiful wildlife no matter how close or far it may be.\n\nLogistics handling\n\nWe are an adaptable film production company. Our logistics’ strategy is built around the shooting location’s specific accessibility and the project’s demands for transportation, crew movement, and more.\n\nTips from our local producers\n\nGetting film permits in Armenia\n\nLorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.\n\nVisas and ATA Carnet\n\nLorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.\n\nFun fact about filming in Armenia\n\nLorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.\n\nOur local work\n\nSee how we work\n\nWhether you have a lot of experience filming or are just starting, contact our video production company in Paraguay. We can follow your lead to bring your creative vision to life by leveraging our knowledge of the land or make suggestions on how your story can be told to meet your goals. Much like Jose Luis Chilavert, our production coordinator is self-proclaimed to be the best in the world, with a portfolio of customers who agree and recommend their production support services. A free-kick specialist, goalkeeper Chilavert took penalties and famously scored against Argentina in a World Cup qualifier. When filming in Paraguay, make sure to mention admiration for him to win locals over.\n\nAccess to unique film locations\n\nNarrowing down a filming location isn’t just about aesthetic appeal. Film location scouting also has to consider logistics, safety, timing, and shooting permissions. If you partner with us, you will be able to film in some exclusive locations that may fit your script best.\n\nComplete support with paperwork\n\nFrom film permits in Paraguay to contracts with vendors – our production assistant is on top of it! Whatever paperwork your filming might presuppose – we will secure it, and keep it up to date and organized at hand if needed during shoots.\n\nBroad-ranging portfolio\n\nOur video production services in Paraguay have attracted many famous customers and our portfolio boasts all types of productions. For example, we helped Google, DHL, and Oracle with commercial video production, company or testimonial videos, and more.\n\nFull-service production support\n\nWhen filming in Paraguay, you will want more than just the services of a film production company well versed with local authorities and vendors. You will want a creative partner, able to keep their eyes on your goals, and Storytailors is just that.\n\nOur international work\n\nWe serviced content for\n\nKey people\n\nRuxandra\n\nProducer & Fixer\n\nPaul\n\nGlobal Production Specialist\n\nAyman\n\nProducer\n\nAriel\n\nVideographer\n\nStorytailors were incredibly dialed from day one through the last – from helping assemble our production crew in Seoul, to navigating our 16-hour time zone difference with grace and ease, to translating Korean interviews in post – they truly were an extension of our creative production team in Portland.\n\nDawn Wagner Perkiss\n\nRevery USA producer working for ORACLE\n\nThe Storytailors team were an immense support on a remote project that started with many moving pieces. We ultimately shot with a brilliant team in Bolivia who were thorough and a pleasure to work with.\n\nAntonia Vickers\n\nAcademy Films producer working for UNICEF\n\nWorking with Storytailors on our recent film in Cambodia was an efficient, helpful, and creatively collaborative experience. The Storytailors team understood what our specific goals were and matched us with skilled artists, with intimate knowledge and connection to the local community we were interested in capturing.\n\nZach Morgan\n\nUntold LA producer working for Amazon Prime\n\nPaul Lungu kindly supplied us with fixers and crews for a series of short charity films that we made in four European countries. Everything was dealt with very efficiently and the crews and fixers were friendly and helpful. The project was particularly challenging because of the Covid pandemic but everything passed without a hitch.\n\nPaul Kittel\n\nMaverick UK producer working for DHL\n\nStorytailors were great in facilitating an overseas shoot in South Korea during lockdown. It was a tricky brief, with lots of moving parts and the guys helped us find solutions at every turn.\n\nLucy Hewitt\n\nWired UK producer working for Hyundai\n\nStorytailors Is the video production company you need\n\nChoose Storytailors as your video production company in Paraguay and let the prices that you see in Guarani be your only scare here. Our production coordinator is not just a great problem solver, used to remain calm and take decisions under pressure, but also a team player, sharing information and checking in with the other team members as needed.\n\nYour corporate video will benefit a lot from their experience, as they are well-versed in communicating a company’s core beliefs and values through film. They offered video production services to benefit corporate overview videos that set the tone and communication style for all of the respective companies’ video content. Truly, the Chilavert of video production!"
