It follows the plights of three women and their experiences with abortion. Each of the three stories takes place in the same house, 22 years apart: 1952, 1974, and 1996. All three segments were co-written by Nancy Savoca. Savoca directed the first and second segment while Cher directed the third. The women's experiences in each vignette are designed to demonstrate the popular views of society on the issue in each of the given decades.\n\nDebuting at the Toronto International Film Festival, If These Walls Could Talk became a surprise success and was the highest-rated movie in HBO history.[1] It was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards, including for Outstanding Television Movie and three Golden Globe Awards, including Best Miniseries or Television Film.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\n1952\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 1952 segment deals with Claire Donnelly, a widowed nurse living in suburban Chicago, who becomes pregnant by Kevin, her brother-in-law and decides to undergo abortion in order not to hurt her late husband's family. However, abortion at the time is strictly illegal. Claire eventually finds another nurse who provides her the phone number of a woman who can find her someone to perform the abortion. The woman on the phone tells Claire that the only trustworthy care provider she knows is located in Puerto Rico, and Claire cannot afford the travel costs—with air fare and hotel costs, the total trip would cost about $1000 (about $10,800 in 2022). After a failed attempt to end her pregnancy with a knitting needle, Claire contacts a man who comes to her home and performs a clandestine, hasty procedure on her while she lies atop her kitchen table. Claire finally manages to abort, but dies shortly afterwards due to massive blood loss.\n\n1974\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 1974 segment deals with Barbara Barrows, a struggling and aging mother with four children and a night-shift-working policeman husband, who discovers she is pregnant despite having recently gone back to college. She considers abortion with the support of her teenage daughter, Linda, but ultimately chooses to keep the child.\n\n1996\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 1996 segment deals with Christine Cullen, a college student pregnant by a married professor, who decides on an abortion when he breaks up with her and only offers her money. After consulting with her roommate, Patti, she made an appointment with Dr. Beth Thompson. However, the abortion takes place during a violent protest, and during the actual abortion, an anti-abortion protester walks in and shoots Dr. Thompson immediately after she completes the procedure. Christine comforts Dr. Thompson as she slowly bleeds out.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\n1952 segment\n\nDemi Moore as Claire Donnelly\n\nShirley Knight as Mary Donnelly\n\nCatherine Keener as Becky Donnelly\n\nJason London as Kevin Donnelly\n\nCCH Pounder as Jenny Ford\n\n1974 segment\n\nHedy Burress as Linda Barrows\n\nSissy Spacek as Barbara Barrows\n\nJoanna Gleason as Julia\n\nXander Berkeley as John Barrows\n\nJanna Michaels as Sally Barrows\n\nIan Bohen as Scott Barrows\n\nZack Eginton as Ryan Barrows\n\n1996 segment\n\nAnne Heche as Christine Cullen\n\nCher as Dr. Beth Thompson\n\nJada Pinkett as Patti\n\nEileen Brennan as Tessie\n\nLindsay Crouse as Frances White\n\nCraig T.

Without that power, you couldn't do it. These topics are not on everybody's top 10 list of things to do.\"[3]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film received mostly positive reviews from critics. If These Walls Could Talk holds an 88% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on eight reviews.[5]\n\nAmong the positive reviews were Siskel & Ebert, who both gave the film \"Two Thumbs Up.\"[6]\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Award Category Nominee(s) Result Ref.\n\n1997\n\nCableACE Awards Editing a Dramatic Special or Series/Movie or Miniseries Peter Honess and Elena Maganini Won [7] Festival International de Programmes Audiovisuels Fiction Won Golden Globe Awards Best Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television Nominated [8] Best Actress in a Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television Demi Moore Nominated Best Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television Cher Nominated NAACP Image Awards Outstanding Lead Actress in a Television Movie or Mini-Series Jada Pinkett Nominated Online Film & Television Association Awards Best Motion Picture Made for Television Nominated [9] Best Direction of a Motion Picture or Miniseries Nominated Best Writing of a Motion Picture or Miniseries Nominated Best Editing in a Motion Picture or Limited Series Nominated Primetime Emmy Awards Outstanding Made for Television Movie Suzanne Todd, Demi Moore,\n\nLaura Greenlee, and J.J.
