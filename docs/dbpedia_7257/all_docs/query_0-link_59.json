Please let us know if you would like a device when purchasing your ticket or by emailing ADA@SFFilm.org.\n\nWhat These Walls Won’t Hold\n\nFilmed during the coronavirus pandemic, Adamu Chan’s What These Walls Won't Hold is not about COVID but about the way the crisis brought into focus and catalyzed ongoing organizing efforts at San Quentin State Prison. Chan, who was incarcerated there, chronicles his journey home, interweaving his account with those of his loved ones both inside and outside the penitentiary walls. What emerges is a tender picture of a community thriving with relationships built on trust, and an indomitable zeal to fight for a brighter and better future for those incarcerated. It creates a blueprint for resistance and liberation that is for all and invites us to imagine the abolitionist utopia that awaits us at the end of our strife.\n\nAdamu Chan (USA 2022, 42 min)\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nHow We Get Free\n\nIn Denver, an intrepid activist runs for office with the aim of eliminating cash bail.\n\nGeeta Gandbhir, Samantha Knowles (USA 2023, 30 min)\n\nSol in the Garden\n\nA formerly incarcerated woman catches the sun as she nourishes a garden with her new community.\n\nEmily Cohen Ibañez, Débora Souza Silva (USA 2022, 21 min)\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nTotal Runtime 94 min"
