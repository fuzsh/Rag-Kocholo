        "text": "Lisa Witt is known around the world as that upbeat piano teacher on YouTube. But did you know that she‚Äôs also an artist who writes original songs? Today, we‚Äôre releasing a performance of Lisa‚Äôs original song ‚ÄúFour Walls.‚Äù It‚Äôs an absolute banger with a sweet story behind it. Here‚Äôs a (lightly edited and condensed) interview with Lisa on ‚ÄúFour Walls,‚Äù how she composes, and the role of music in her life.\n\nüéπ Don‚Äôt Miss Lisa‚Äôs D√©but! ü¶Ñ\n\nSign up to get the latest updates from Pianote ‚Äî including free lessons, tips, articles, interviews, and more ‚Äî delivered straight to your inbox every week. Unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThe Lisa Witt ‚ÄúFour Walls‚Äù Interview\n\nSo how do you figure out the chord progressions?\n\nThat‚Äôs a good question! I always challenge myself. If the last song I wrote was in F Major, I‚Äôll try to make my next song in D Major. I typically stick with pop chords.\n\nOften in pop music, the progression starts on the I chord. So I start with that, but I also think: what can I use instead of the I? Or, where can I go instead of the vi? Is there a different diatonic chord I can throw in?\n\nAnd I‚Äôll try to find a really cool sounding riff on the piano. I‚Äôll take that and build chords around it, then add words.\n\nüéπü§î Why is Lisa talking about random numbers?? Lisa is talking about diatonic chords, or all the chords that exist within a scale. The chord built on the first note of the scale is the ‚Äúone‚Äù (or I), the chord built on the fifth note is the V. A common chord progression in many pop songs is I-V-vi-IV.\n\nSo how do you avoid defaulting to the I chord?\n\nIt‚Äôs brutal! Sometimes, for example, I‚Äôll start on the I, then travel up quickly and use it like a passing note to the iii. So, I‚Äôll go C-D-E‚Ä¶and then start my melody there. I try not to start in a ‚Äúlanded space.‚Äù Or I‚Äôll go to the relative minor.\n\nAuthenticity is the most attractive thing, and it‚Äôs what draws people in. So, if you can be authentic and not write for somebody or something, that‚Äôs when you get the best results.\n\nSo on that note of authenticity, what are your inspirations? Pop songs are often about love, but everyone writes about love. I know you love horses, so to be authentic, would you write about horses?\n\nI love horses and I would write about the freedom I experience when I‚Äôm on one. Then I‚Äôd probably take that and disguise it under an idea of love.\n\nDo you think there are certain themes that you often return to?\n\nYeah. There‚Äôs always some level of relationship drama happening. So I often return to telling that story. I think that‚Äôs pretty normal for all of us.\n\n‚ÄúFour Walls‚Äù is really about grief. Not fitting in is another theme. These are all things I process with a pen and a melody.\n\nYeah, we‚Äôre social creatures.\n\nI do find that I tend to gravitate towards inspiration from nature. I recently wrote about the sun ‚Äî or, I wrote to the sun. That was really cool.\n\n‚ÄúFour Walls‚Äù was similar ‚Äî there‚Äôs a lot of plant life in that song! So, yes, nature is really inspiring for me and there are so many lessons to be learned from watching the outside. So that comes out in songs.\n\nSo, what skills would you say piano players need in order to write a song, if any?\n\nHonestly, I think it‚Äôs pretty basic. You don‚Äôt need to be very good at the piano to write songs on it. Because writing songs is just exploring. I get so excited about what I‚Äôve done with Pianote because all you need to write a song is a scale and the chords that belong to that scale. Thats the focus of a LOT of what we do inside Pianote.\n\nüéπüî• Chords: Piano‚Äôs Secret Weapon! If you know chords, you‚Äôll unlock hundreds of songs, along with the ability to compose. To learn more, check out this lesson: A Piano Player‚Äôs Best Kept Secret.\n\nDo you have a favorite key?\n\nA lot of my songs are in F Major. Lately, I‚Äôve been playing with F Major, B-flat Major, and D Minor, and I like having those pop chords together.\n\nMy next step is, I‚Äôve got an interface that I‚Äôm going to purchase; everything else I have at home. [With these tools,] I‚Äôll start recording the piano and vocals. That gives me what I need to get these songs produced.\n\nSo what‚Äôs next for Lisa?\n\nWe‚Äôre sure many of you are excited for Lisa‚Äôs debut album!\n\nLisa‚Äôs next step is to find a producer that deeply understands her ‚Äúenergy‚Äù and ‚Äúheart.‚Äù Songwriting is a process, and Lisa doesn‚Äôt approach production with everything planned. She likes to collaborate with co-writers and producers who share a similar vision.\n\nAnother thing Lisa does is build soundscapes and moodboards out of existing favorite tracks. So, if there‚Äôs a song on Spotify where she loves a certain five seconds of, she‚Äôll tell her team that she wants something like that in her own song.\n\nShe will likely do some fundraising and awareness-building to determine a budget before hiring a producer. Let‚Äôs all wish Lisa the best of luck on her debut!"
