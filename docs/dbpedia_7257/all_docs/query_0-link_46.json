        "text": "Are soundtracks making a comeback? The idea of a movie-related compilation of choice tunes that add up to a distinct vibe seemed to go out of fashion after the early 2000s, when the music for “Garden State” was such an event.\n\nBut films like “Barbie” and “I Saw the TV Glow” may indicate that some directors are thinking in terms of the soundtrack again. That prompted me to ask Times readers about their favorite film albums, and hundreds responded with heartfelt stories, funny memories and recollections of life-changing moments.\n\nMovies from the 1980s and ’90s tended to dominate, with the Motown sounds of “The Big Chill” and the ’90s grunge of “Singles” among the most popular submissions, along with the reggae stars of “The Harder They Come” from 1972. Movies from the 1950s and ’60s had fans, too, with the music more likely to be scores (orchestral compositions made specifically for the film) or Broadway imports.\n\nThe Coppola family made a strong showing, with Francis Ford, Sofia and her cousin Nicolas Cage all name-checked repeatedly. But other genres and artists we expected to hear about, like hip-hop and the Beatles (and “Garden State” for that matter), weren’t mentioned much."
