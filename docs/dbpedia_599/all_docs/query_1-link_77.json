        "text": "Do you want to see the panorama of Gdynia? Go to the viewpoint rising 52 meters above sea level. (entrance near the city beach). You can get there on foot using the stairs or by train (its lower station is located near the Musical Theatre). The funicular runs free of charge from 10 am to 10 pm. From the observation deck, the Bay of Gdańsk, the Gdynia port and the square look beautiful. A characteristic element of this place is a high cross.\n\nThe largest musical theater in Poland is located in Gdynia. In addition, it is right after the Grand Theater in Warsaw, one of the largest in terms of the number of seats in the audience. Three halls can accommodate a total of over 1,500 spectators. Initially, the theater was established in Gdańsk in 1957. The official opening of the theater in the Gdynia building took place in 1979. In 2010, it was expanded, which involved, among others, with its area increased to 19,000 sq. m2, and the building received a new shape, the most modern lighting and electroacoustics were installed. Annually, this place is visited by over 100,000 people. viewers. It is here that events such as the Polish Feature Film Festival, the Ladies’ Jazz Festival, the Shakespeare Festival and the Festival of Musical Theaters take place.\n\nThe museum was established in 1953 and since then it has been collecting exhibits related to the history of the Polish Navy. The museum changed its location several times. In 2012, a ceremonial opening took place in the new building, which houses the permanent exhibitions, and right next to the open-air ones. A part of the museum is also ORP “Blyskawica”, the world’s oldest surviving destroyer, actively participating in World War II. The ship is unavailable to visitors during the winter.\n\nBeing at the Naval Museum, it is impossible not to visit the Museum of the City of Gdynia. This is because both centers are located in the same building on the seaside boulevard. The Gdynia museum has been operating since 1983. Although its origins can be traced back to the Municipal Public Library, operating since 1968. At that time, the historic Abraham’s House on Starowiejska Street was designated as the seat of the Documentation Department of the City’s History. However, so many exhibits were collected that over time the storage and exhibition functions were taken over by the pavilion at ul. Washingtona 21. The ceremonial opening of the new headquarters took place in 2007.\n\nThe Emigration Museum in Gdynia is a young institution on the map of this city. It was made available to visitors in 2015 and documents the history of the emigration of Poles. The seat of the museum is the building of the Maritime Station in Gdynia and it became the seat not by chance. It was here that the pre-war passenger traffic was located, and hundreds of thousands of people left the station before the war broke out. During the war, the building was severely damaged and it took 70 years for it to be rebuilt. In addition to the exhibition part, there is a bookshop, bistro and restaurant in the building, and from September to March the Film Club.\n\nThis facility was opened in 2007 in the Pomeranian Science and Technology Park in Gdynia. In 2013, the Center began operating in its new premises. It is a perfect place to spend a few hours watching interactive exhibitions, science shows or taking part in workshops, e.g. on astronomy. There is a bistro on site.\n\nThis place mesmerizes with a picturesque view of the bay and the cliff. No wonder that it has already become a showcase of the city. The cliff stretches for about 650 m, and its highest elevation reaches 40 m above sea level. It’s worth going there and seeing the cliff while you still can. Its slopes are washed away by waves and it is estimated that in several decades the cliff may disappear. 10 minutes from the cliff on foot in the direction of Sopot, there is the popular Orłowo Pier, measuring 180 meters. Being in the area, it is also worth visiting the Żeromski House, where this outstanding writer lived for several months."
