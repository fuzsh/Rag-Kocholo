        "text": "Gdynia, city, Pomorskie województwo (province), north-central Poland. It lies along the Gulf of Gdańsk, just northwest of Gdańsk city.\n\nFirst mentioned in 1253, Gdynia began as a fishing settlement. Major growth came only after World War I, when Gdynia was returned from Germany to Poland by the Treaty of Versailles. When the German-controlled legislative assembly in Gdańsk barred Poland’s use of that port’s facilities, Poland chose Gdynia as the site for its new port. From 1924 to 1939 Gdynia was the major Baltic port, surpassing Gdańsk and Szczecin. Nazi Germany destroyed the town and harbour during World War II, but Gdynia was quickly rebuilt after the war."
