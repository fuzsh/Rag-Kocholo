        "text": "Friday, September 1, 1939\n\nIn Poland... At 0445 hours German forces invade Poland without a declaration of war. The operation is code named Fall Weiss (Plan White). The Germans allot 52 divisions for the invasion (some 1.5 million men), including the 6 armored divisions and all their motorized units. Of the divisions left to defend against an Anglo-French front, only about 10 are regarded by the Germans as being fit for any kind of action. General Brauchitsch, the Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, is in command of the campaign. Bock leads Army Group North, consisting of the 4th Army (Kuchler) and 3rd Army (Kluge); Rundstedt leads Army Group South, consisting of 8th Army (Balskowitz), 10th Army (Reichenau) and 14th Army (List). Air support comes from two Air Fleets, commanded by Kesselring and Lohr, which have around 1,600 aircraft. Army Group South, advancing from Silesia, is to provide the main German attacks. The 8th Army on the left is to move toward Poznan, the principal thrust is to be delivered by 10th Army which is to advance in the center to the Vistula River between Warsaw and Sandomierz, while 14th Army on the right moves toward Krakow and the Carpathian flank. The 4th Army from East Prussia is to move south toward Warsaw and the line to the Bug River to the east; 3rd Army is to cross the Polish Corridor and join 4th Army in moving south. The Poles have 23 regular infantry divisions prepared with 7 more assembling, 1 weak armored division and an inadequate supply of artillery. They also have a considerable force of cavalry. The reserve units were only called up on August 30th and are not ready for combat. In the air, almost all the 500 Polish planes are obsolete and prove unable to blunt the impact of the German attack. During the day, the Luftwaffe launches air strikes on Warsaw, Lodz and Krakow. The Polish Commander in Chief, Marshal Rydz-Smigly, has deployed the stronger parts of his army in the northwestern half of the country, including large forces in the Poznan area and the Polish Corridor. He hopes to hold the Germans to only gradual gains. All along the front the superior training, equipment and strength of the Germans quickly brings them the advantage in the first battles. Many Polish units are overrun before their reinforcements from the reserve mobilization can arrive. At sea, as in the air, Polish technical inferiority leads to crushing early defeats. Three of the four Polish destroyers manage to leave for Britain before hostilities begin and later one submarine also escapes. On the first day the old pre-Dreadnought battleship, Schleswig-Holstein, bombards the Polish naval base at Westerplatte.\n\nIn Berlin... Officials claim that Polish army regulars started firing on Germans along the frontier and that the fire was returned beginning at 0445 hours. Hitler addresses the Reichstag during the day, declaring \"I am determined to eliminate from the German frontiers the element of insecurity, the atmosphere which permanently resembles that of civil war.\"\n\nFrom Warsaw... The Polish government appeals for British and French intervention under the terms of the Mutual Assistance Treaties.\n\nIn London... The British government demands a German withdrawal from Poland.\n\nIn Britain... Because of the fear of air attacks, the evacuation of young children from London and other supposedly vulnerable areas is begun. General mobilization is proclaimed. (The Royal Navy was mobilized on August 31st.) Air Raid Precautions (ARP) are introduced and a \"blackout\" enforced from sunset. British railways are taken under government control.\n\nIn Paris... The French government demands a German withdrawal from Poland.\n\nIn France... General mobilization and a \"state of siege\" (martial law) are proclaimed.\n\nIn Rome... The Italian government announces that it will not take any military initiative.\n\nIn the Soviet Union... The armed forces are mobilized and the draft age is lowered from 21 to 19.\n\nIn Washington... President Roosevelt calls for a ban on indiscriminate bombing of civilians and undefended towns.\n\nIn Oslo... The Norwegian government declares its neutrality.\n\nIn Bern... The Swiss government declares its neutrality.\n\nIn Helsinki... The Finnish government declares its neutrality.\n\nSaturday, September 2, 1939\n\nIn Poland... Troops of German Army Group South (Rundstedt) troops are already over the Warta River in many places after rapid but expensive victories in the frontier battles. Krakow is now near the front line. In the north, 4th Army (Kluge) makes contact with the Third Army (Kuchler) from East Prussia. Two Polish divisions are destroyed while attempting to pull back through the Corridor. The Luftwaffe is spreading chaos in the Polish rear. The Polish regular troops have been stationed too far forward so the German advance is soon in their rear areas, preventing movement of reserves and completely dislocating any communication left unscathed by the repeated German air strikes in support of the ground forces. There are 6 air raids on Warsaw.\n\nIn London... Throughout the day there are frantic talks about how to oppose Germany. The British Parliament is openly opposed to the passive line that the Chamberlain government is taking and in the evening, the Cabinet decides to present an ultimatum to Germany. The National Service Act is passed, allowing for the conscription of all men aged 19-41.\n\nIn Paris... Deliberations on how to oppose the German invasion of Poland are held throughout the day. A French government decides to transmit an ultimatum to Germany. The government declares that it will fulfill its obligations to Poland.\n\nIn France... The British RAF Advanced Air Striking Force arrives. Some 10 bomber squadrons are involved in the deployment.\n\nIn Rome... Mussolini again declares Italian neutrality and calls for a 5-power peace conference.\n\nIn Berlin... The German government announces that Norwegian neutrality will be respected, provided that Britain and France do the same. Hitler rejects an offer to mediate the German-Polish dispute, made by Mussolini on August 31st and the proposal for a peace conference.\n\nIn Dublin... The Irish government declares its neutrality.\n\nIn Bern... The Swiss government orders a general mobilization.\n\nSunday, September 3, 1939\n\nIn London... The British ultimatum to Germany expires at 1100 hours and at 1115 hours, Chamberlain broadcasts to announce that the war has begun. Chamberlain forms a War Cabinet, which includes Churchill as First Lord of the Admiralty (which is signaled to all Royal Navy ships and installations with the message \"Winston is back\") and Eden as Secretary for the Dominions. Churchill and Eden have been the most prominent opponents of an appeasement policy. A Ministry of Economic Warfare is established. The British government also announces the implementation of a blockade of Germany. At 1135 hours, as if to confirm the state of war, there is an air-raid warning in London but it is a false alarm.\n\nIn Paris... In the afternoon, at 1700 hours, the French declare war before their ultimatum expires.\n\nIn Poland... The Polish Lodz Army is now in retreat after being beaten in the frontier battles with Army Group South. German 10th Army ( General Reichenau) forces have crossed the Warta River in some areas while 14th Army (General List) troops are converging on Krakow. The city of Czestochowa falls to German forces. Some Polish units penetrate into East Prussia but their position becomes untenable as German forces cut them off to the south. The Polish air force ceases to exist as an effective fighting element. In Warsaw, there are pro-British demonstrations.\n\nIn the North Atlantic... The British passenger liner, SS Athenia, is torpedoed off the northwest coast of Ireland en route to Canada by U-30 because it is mistakenly identified as an auxiliary cruiser. There are 112 dead including 28 American citizens, of some 1400 passengers including some 316 Americans. The German government is unaware of the action of the U-boat until later in the month. Britain believes that this is the start of unrestricted submarine warfare. At this time, 39 of the German fleet of 58 U-boats are at sea. Doenitz, the submarine chief, had hoped for a fleet of 300 before contemplating war with Britain.\n\nIn Britain... The 3-day evacuation of 1.5 million civilians from the larger cities to the country is completed.\n\nOver Germany... During the night (September 3-4), British RAF aircraft drop 6 million leaflets on cities in northern Germany and the Ruhr in the first of a series of propaganda raids.\n\nIn Sydney... The Australian government declares war on Germany.\n\nIn Wellington... The government of New Zealand declares war on Germany.\n\nIn Brussels... The government of Belgium declares its neutrality. King Leopold III assumes command of the Belgium Army.\n\nThursday, September 7, 1939\n\nOn the Western Front... French patrols cross the frontier into Germany near Saarbrucken, marking the beginning of the Saar offensive. A total of 11 divisions advance along a 32 km frontage. There is negligible German opposition. The French mobilization is too slow and their tactical system too inflexible to permit any grander offensive operation. These gentle probes continue until September 17th when a larger advance is supposed to be made but is in fact cancelled because the Polish collapse makes it pointless.\n\nIn Poland... The Polish naval base at Westerplatte, a enclave in Danzig, surrenders after renewed German bombardment after being besieged since September 1st. The Polish command decides that it will be impossible to hold the line of the Narew River although the order to do so has only been in force for one day. The forces in the Narew area are to retire to the Bug River. The German Schleswig-Holstein begins daily bombardment of Hela, a Polish naval base.\n\nIn Berlin... Hitler meets with Admiral Erich Raeder, Commander-in-Chief of the Kriegsmarine, and orders that \"in order not to provoke neutral countries, the United States in particular, it is forbidden to torpedo passenger steamers, even when sailing in convoy. Warfare against French merchant ships, attacks on French warships and mine laying off French ports is prohibited.\" The order is in response to the sinking of the Athenia.\n\nIn Germany... The death penalty is decreed for anyone \"endangering the defensive power of the German people.\"\n\nIn London... General Viscount Gort, VC, is appointed to command the British Expeditionary Force.\n\nIn the North Atlantic... The first British Atlantic convoys set out. The convoy system has already been reintroduced on the East Coast. Although escorts can only be provided as far as 12.5 degrees west, they do provide effective protection against U-Boats. Many of the faster ships and some particularly slow ones do not sail in convoy at this stage or later in the war. During 1939, almost all U-Boat successes are from such \"independents.\"\n\nFriday, September 8, 1939\n\nIn Poland... The German 4th Panzer Division, spearheading the German 10th Army (Reichenau) reaches the Warsaw suburb of Ochota, in the southeast, late in the day (having advanced 225 km in 7 days). The Polish garrison commander in Warsaw, General Czuma, broadcasts a defiant Order of the Day: \"We shall fight to the last ditch!\" Some 100,000 Polish civilians in Warsaw are engaged in digging trenches on the city outskirts. Meanwhile, other elements of the German 10th Army are heavily engaged around Radom, only 60 miles south of Warsaw; about 60,000 Polish troops are encircled to the west of Radom. The German 14th Army (List) reaches the San River north and south of Przemysl. In the north, the German 19th Panzer Corps (Guderian) is attacking along the line of the Bug River to the east of Warsaw.\n\nOn the Western Front... A group of 5 Curtiss Hawk fighters of l'Armee de l'Air (French air force) engage 5 Me109 fighters and claim to shoot down 2 of the German planes.\n\nIn London... In response to what the British government declares to be German resort to unrestricted submarine warfare, the government announces a long-range blockade of Germany, broadening the original blockade announced on September 3rd. Also, the government revives the convoy system for merchant ships. Three protected routes are established, two from Liverpool and from the Thames to the Atlantic, one from the Thames and the Firth of Forth.\n\nIn Washington... Roosevelt proclaims a state of \"limited national emergency,\" citing the war in Europe which \"imposes on the United States certain duties with respect to the proper observance, safeguarding and enforcement\" of its neutral status \"and the strengthening of the national defense within the limits of peacetime authorizations.\" All US military forces are authorized to increase enlisted manpower strength and to recall reservists to active duty.\n\nSaturday, September 9, 1939\n\nIn Poland... The German 4th Panzer Division, part of the German 16th Panzer Corps, mounts an attack in the southeast suburbs of Warsaw but is beaten off. The German command believes that almost all the Polish forces have retired east of the Vistula River but in fact fresh units from the Poznan Army and part of the Pomorze Army have joined together around Kutno. About 10 Polish divisions are assembling in this area under the command of General Tadeusz Kutrzeba. They now begin a counterattack over the Bzura River against the German 8th Army. The battles which follow will be the hardest fought of the campaign. Initially, the Poles gain some success.\n\nOn the Western Front... French troops advance into the Warndt Forest across the German border and occupy 3 square miles of German territory. The action is widely viewed as having more propaganda than military purpose since the region, referred to by the French as \"occupied Germany,\" is deserted, heavily mined and booby-trapped.\n\nIn France... The last of 13 RAF squadrons arrives in move begun on September 4th to strengthen the British Expeditionary Force.\n\nFrom Moscow... Molotov prematurely congratulates the Germany for the \"entry of German troops into Warsaw\" and promises Soviet intervention \"within the next few days.\"\n\nFrom Berlin... Goring threatens reprisals against Britain if the RAF bombs Germany and boasts that Berlin will never be subjected to enemy aerial attack. He says that \"the Polish Army will never emerge again from the German embrace.\" Ribbentrop invites the Soviets to advance to their new common frontier, the Narew, Vistula and San rivers (the Bug and Pissa would eventually replace the Vistula to avoid a divided Warsaw.\n\nTuesday, September 12, 1939\n\nOn the Western Front... French forces have now advanced about 5 miles (8 km) into Germany on a 15-mile (24 km) frontage in the Saarland region. The French claim that the action has forced the Germans to withdraw 6 divisions from Poland, although British observers express doubts. The advance places the front within half a mile of the Siegfried Line and a frontal assault on this defensive system is considered to be out of the question. General Gamelin calls an end to the Saar offensive.\n\nIn Poland... Some of List's troops are fighting near Lvov while others are moving north from their bridgeheads over the San. The Polish army around Poznan, the one that was to have marched on Berlin, unexpectedly turns about and attempts to take the German 8th Army in the flank. This is the start of the violent battle of the Bzura River. Polish troops push the German forces 12 miles south of Kutno and recapture Lowicz. Gdynia is evacuated by the Poles. Luftwaffe planes bomb Krzemieniec (Kremenets) in eastern Poland, a declared open village where the diplomatic community from Warsaw has sought refuge.\n\nIn Bucharest... The German Foreign Minister, von Ribbentrop, demands that the Romanians not give asylum to Polish officials crossing the border and threatens military action in case of noncompliance.\n\nIn France... The Anglo-French Supreme War Council meets for the first time at Abbeville. Meanwhile, a Czech army-in-exile is formed.\n\nIn Britain... The home office opens an inquiry into blackout rules.\n\nIn the North Atlantic... The US Navy begins regular neutrality patrols along the entire length of the eastern seaboard and in the Caribbean.\n\nWednesday, September 13, 1939\n\nFrom Berlin... The German Armed Forces High Command (OKW) announces that civilian targets in Poland are being bombed because civilians are involving themselves in the fighting.\n\nIn Poland... A small German infantry force begins to cross the Vistula just south of Warsaw. The Bzura battles are now going badly for the Polish forces. The heaviest fighting will be over by September 15th but some engagements will continue until the 19th. Although the Germans will take their largest single haul of 150,000 prisoners in this battle, by September 19th, units of two Polish brigades and elements of others will manage to escape to Warsaw.\n\nFrom Warsaw... The US ambassador to Poland, Anthony J. Drexel Biddle, Jr., reports that German bombers are attacking the civilian population. He says \"they are releasing bombs they carry even when they are in no doubt as to the identity of their objectives.\n\nIn Paris... The French Prime Minister, Edouard Daladier, forms a War Cabinet in which he is responsible for foreign affairs as well as retaining the portfolios of war and national defense. The former foreign minister, Georges Bonnet, is appointed Minister of Justice. Raoul Dautry is appointed Minister of Armaments and Georges Pernot is appointed Minister of Blockade, both are new portfolios related to the war effort. Daladier is keen to have a war cabinet that will enable France to put recent divisions aside and fight the war with a spirit of national unity.\n\nIn Algeria... The French cruiser La Tour d'Auvergne sinks from an accidental explosion at Casablanca.\n\nSunday, September 17, 1939\n\nIn Poland... Soviet troops enter Poland. Naturally because of the German attack there is almost no defense in the east. The Soviets employ two army groups or Fronts. The Poles have only 18 battalions in the east of their country. Just before dawn, the Red Army invades along the entire 800-mile (1300 km) border. Poles are surprised and Soviet forces advance virtually unopposed. Meanwhile, the Polish government is fleeing towards the Romanian border, evacuating from the border town of Kuty -- the fifth and last temporary seat in the Polish provinces. All surviving Polish aircrew fly to Romania. In Warsaw, St. John's Cathedral is bombed during mass; the dead are buried in public parks because the cemeteries are full. Warsaw is now completely isolated as converging German forces of German Army Group North and Army Group South meet at Siedlce, in eastern Poland. Some 40,000 Polish prisoners have been captured by the Germans at Kutno and Brest-Litovsk is taken after a bitter 3-day battle. German are given a stop line because of the Soviet invasion in the east.\n\nIn Moscow... Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, announces that the USSR is invading to protect Ukrainian and Belorussian minorities in Poland. Soviet newspapers have been making claims of \"brutal treatment\" of national minorities in Poland, especially Ukrainians and Belorussians. The Soviet government promises to respect Finnish neutrality and recognizes Slovakia as an independent state.\n\nIn Athens... The Italian government assures the Greek government that it will take no military action against Greece even if Italy enters the war.\n\nIn the North Atlantic... The British aircraft carrier, HMS Courageous, is sunk by U-29 while on anti-submarine patrol off the southwest coast of Ireland. More than 500 men are killed (514 of 1200 crew members). After this second incident, carriers are withdrawn from such work. Courageous has been one of the most effective of the British carriers.\n\nWednesday, September 27, 1939\n\nIn Poland... Warsaw surrenders after two days of intensive air and artillery bombardment. The siege has resulted in the deaths of some 2000 Polish soldiers and 10,000 civilians. A total of 40,000 people are believed to have been killed or injured. About one eighth of the buildings in the city have been destroyed. German forces take about 150,000 prisoners. General von Blaskowitz, who received the Polish surrender, allows the Polish officers to keep their swords and promises that the troops will only go into captivity for as long as it takes to \"dispose of the necessary formalities.\" The terms of the capitulation provide for the immediate relief of the civilian population and the wounded.\n\nIn Berlin... Hitler tells his service chiefs that he plans to attack in the west as soon as possible and sets the date as November 12th. He has reached this decision entirely on his own. Army representative oppose the decision. Meanwhile, Hitler establishes the Reichssicherheitshauptamt [Reich Chief Security Office] (RSHA) under Reinhart Heydrich, who now heads the Gestapo, the Criminal Police (Kripo) and the Security Service (SD)\n\nIn London... Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon presents his first War Budget. Income tax is raised from 5/6d (25 1/2p) to 7/6d (37 1/2p) in the pound.\n\nFriday, September 29, 1939\n\nIn Moscow... Germany and the USSR sign a boundary and friendship treaty. By its terms Poland is partitioned, giving Germany control over the area generally west of the Bug River. Germany receives nearly 73,000 square miles of Polish territory, the USSR, 78,000 square miles. While Soviet Union gets slightly more land, the Germans now control the majority of the population (some 22,000,000) and fifty percent of all Polish industry as well as substantial mining centers. All of Lithuania is transferred to the Soviet sphere of influence. An economic agreement is also signed which includes a Soviet promise to provide Germany with the entire oil output of the Dohowicz fields.\n\nOver Germany... The RAF lost 5 Hampden bombers in a daylight raid on the Heligoland area. The raid was in two waves. In the first, 6 Hampdens attacked two German destroyers but did no damage; the second wave of 5 planes was wiped out.\n\nIn Britain... A national census is taken to obtain information on rationing and mobilization.\n\nIn London... In the House of Commons, Neville Chamberlain says that Britain and France went to war to stop Nazi aggression and nothing has changed that position. Chamberlain is believed to be referring to recent private contacts between German and British representatives that have suggested formal peace negotiations may begin.\n\nIn the United States... In New York city, Fritz Kuhn, the leader of the pro-Nazi German-American Bund, is imprisoned."
