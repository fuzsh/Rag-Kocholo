        "text": "Itâs the central district of the city. Initially, the area was an agricultural and fishing village, but at the beginning of the 20th century it became a summer holiday village.\n\nThe real development came after 1920, when it was under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles\n\nPoland was granted access to the seacoast, and then a decision was made to start the construction of the port. The huge investment was the work of engineer Tadeusz Wendy, who designed and built the port, and Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski – the then minister of industry and trade.\n\nAlong with the construction of the port, the area around the “window to the world” was also gaining new face. Simultaneously with the granting of city rights to Gdynia in 1926, the first urban plan was created, which became the foundation for the construction of the city center. When the construction was started, three axles were established. The oldest one was Starowiejska Street, the commercial one was ÅwiÄtojaÅska street, and the most representative are today’s streets leading to the sea: 10 Lutego, oÅciuszki Square and Jana PawÅa II Lane with South Pier and Basen Å»eglarski. At that time, a compact frontage development was designed, in which the buildings reached a height of 6-7 storeys. Objects that still bring joy to the eyes of both residents and tourists were growing rapidly – the ZUS office building in Gdynia, called the PLO building; the residential building of Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego or the church at ÅwiÄtojaÅska street, built on the ballast stone foundations of the s / s Kentucky ship, which was one of the first to dock at the Gdynia port.\n\nIn 1931, the Marine Station was established – it was used to send emigrants who wanted to start a new life in South America.\n\nWhen a modern city was built, not all buildings lost the battle with time, thanks to which today’s Gdynia ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie is not only modernist projects from the interwar period, but also rural buildings from the settlement times and later – summer houses.\n\nThe lightning-fast career of the city and its downtown meant that in 1939 Gdynia was one of the most modern and largest cities of the Second Republic of Poland and proud to have a fully equipped port.\n\nUnfortunately, on 19 September 1929, Gdynia was taken over by the German army, and the port became a Kriegsmarine base. As a result of the shelling of the base by the troops of the Second Belorussian Front in 1945, and earlier Allied air raids, the port suffered enormous losses. After the war, the watercraft submerged in the basins were a big problem, among them\n\n“Schleswig-Holstein”, which started the Second World War.\n\nFortunately, the representative, administrative and residential part of today’s Gdynia ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie district was not affected.\n\nIn February 2015, pursuant to the regulation of the President of the Republic of Poland, BronisÅaw Komorowski, the urban layout of Gdynia ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie was recognized as a historical monument.\n\nThe Gdynia ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie district is clearly divided into the northern, industrial and port part and the representative southern part, which in its coastal part is undergoing huge changes in the 21st century. The areas that were excluded from the urbanization process from the beginning of the port’s existence are gradually absorbed by the city, thanks to which the area known as the waterfront is gradually changing its face. By 2026 Sea City, that is ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie Morskie is to be implemented here.\n\nAs part of the planned development estates, openness is assumed, so that residents and tourists can enjoy new places for walking and relaxing, and use the modern marina.\n\nIn the eyes of tourists, Gdynia ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie is above all an impressive modernist architecture, the Marina Gdynia yacht marina, the Seaside Boulevard, the Southern Pier, the Emigration Museum and street murals. For residents, Gdynia ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie is a great place to live, and the saturation with trade and services is unheard of. Here you can buy and take care of literally everything – the inhabitants have at their disposal: shoemakers, opticians, dentists, beauty salons, travel agencies, bicycle repair shops, tattoo studios, tailor services, billiard clubs, goldsmiths, pharmacies, photo shops, cafÃ©s, bookstores, art galleries, cepelia, funeral parlor, yoga centers, florists, haberdashery, jewelers, massage parlors, purse makers, orthodontic offices, copy shops, banks, drawing schools, drugstores, post offices, salons only for adults, pawn shops, ice cream parlors, restaurants, pubs, purse makers, pizzerias , bakeries, ophthalmologists, internists, a Chinese center, and even waste paper and scrap buying point. Customers are invited to visit stores: grocery, vegetable, footwear, clothing, computer, stationery, liquor, fish, pet, roller blinds, antiques, curtains, wedding dresses, lamps, DIY jewelry, toners, sewing machines, devotional articles, and military. Moreover, at Antoniego Abrahama street, there are more than a dozen exchange offices in the short section between 10 Lutego and Starowiejska streets. It is hardly surprising that the alternative street name is: Kantorowa.\n\nThe whole Gdynia small business since 1938 has been “watched over” by the City Market Halls in Gdynia, where you can also buy everything that is needed (and unnecessary) for everyday life, and which attract customers not only from Gdynia.\n\nGdynia ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie also has its own hospital with a ED – the St. Wincent a Paulo Municipal Hospital.\n\nFor those who want to get married, the Registry Office awaits at the Gdynia City Hall.\n\nGdynia has always been a modern city. It is not surprising then that in Gdynia ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie, at part of Abrahama street, the first woonerf in the agglomeration was commissioned.\n\nGdynia ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie borders from the north with Oksywie, ObÅuÅ¼e and PogÃ³rze, from the west with Chylonia, Leszczynki and GrabÃ³wek, from the west with the Forest Plots and Kamienna GÃ³ra, and the eastern border is the Bay of GdaÅsk.\n\nLeisure\n\nIt is hard to find a second city in Europe whose center lies on the seashore. Gdynia ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie has this privilege, which means that recreational areas are at the fingertips of every resident. The most popular place for walking along the shore, jogging and cycling is the Nowowiejski Seaside Boulevard . In fact, it is located in the neighboring district of Kamienna GÃ³ra, but no one feels the difference. It was opened in 1969, is 1500 meters long and connects the downtown beach with Polanka RedÅowska, another favorite place of Gdynia citizens.\n\nFor lovers of sunbathing and sea bathing there is a 200-meter-long beach (territorially mostly also on Kamienna GÃ³ra), with a beach volleyball court, sanitary facilities, a large playground for children, many dining options, a medical point and sunbed rental, and the disabled have a bathing trolley available for transport on the sand.\n\nPeople who like greenery eagerly enjoy the charms of the Council of Europe Park with Aleja Topolowa, which provides shelter from excess sun rays. A favorite walking place for the inhabitants of Gdynia ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie is also the Southern Pier, with a promenade running through its center – Jana PawÅa II Lane.\n\nWater sports enthusiasts are attracted by the largest and most modern marina in Poland, around which there are sailing clubs dedicated to children and adults, charter cruises on the GdaÅsk Bay are also possible.\n\nA huge attraction, especially for children, is the Gdynia Aquarium of the Sea Fisheries Institute in Gdynia. It is a place where you can get to know the Baltic ecosystem and admire the most beautiful fish in the world – living and swimming.\n\nCommunication\n\nThe streets of Gdynia ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie are serviced by buses and trolleybuses, the dense mesh of which allows you to reach all districts of Gdynia and Sopot. An important communication junction is the Gdynia GÅÃ³wna railway station, located 2 km from the sea, serving long-distance trains, SKM and Pomeranian Metropolitan Railway, thanks to which it is easy to get to the airport in GdaÅsk.\n\nEducation\n\nGdynia ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie offers the youngest residents several local commune kindergartens, the Navy Kindergarten and the Catholic Kindergarten of the Holy Family.\n\nMontessori method fans at a distance of less than 3 km (from InfoBox – central\n\npoint of the district) will find two facilities in the neighboring districts.\n\nThere is also no problem with access to local commune schools, including the Sports Complex of General Education Schools (with a primary school and the Secondary School No. VII) and the Complex of Special Schools No. 17. The educational offer of Gdynia ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie also includes the Catholic School Complex of st. John Paul II and Secondary School No. 10.\n\n1.7 km from the InfBox, in the WzgÃ³rze Åw.Maksymiliana district , there is a prestigious Secondary School No. 3 with bilingual departments, which has been among the country’s leaders for years.\n\nThere is a non-public post-secondary school waiting for older youth – the Maritime School in Gdynia, the Provincial Complex of Post-secondary Schools in Gdynia, and the D. Baduszkowa State College of Vocal and ActingÂ , Faculty of Navigation of the Maritime University, Gdynia Film School, University of Social Communication in Gdynia.\n\nFor mature residents who want to educate themselves, Gdynia ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie offers TEB Edukacja in Gdynia, which includes medical schools, technical secondary school, high school for adults and the third age academy.\n\nOutside the district, but a short distance from the centrally located InfoBox, there are: WSB University – 1 km\n\nSchool of Administration and Business – 1.9 km, Maritime University – 3 km.\n\nCulture\n\nThe hallmark of Gdynia’s culture associated with Gdynia ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie is the Polish Film Festival, also organized under the name Gdynia Film Festival. During the festival, Polish feature films are shown, and the main prize is “Golden Lions”.\n\nIn Gdynia ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie, high culture is promoted by two theaters: Danuta Baduszkowa Musical Theater , existing since 1958 and proud to have the second largest stage in Poland, and the Witold Gombrowicz City Theater, presenting world classics of contemporary drama.\n\nThe Midsummer event âSummer begins in Gdynia is extremely popular. âCudawianki â, which is accompanied by numerous concerts, artistic activities in public space, and above all on the city beach.\n\nAlso in summer, Gdynia ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie invites you to the Ladies’ Jazz Festival, devoted to women and jazz music. Most of the concerts are held at the Musical Theater.\n\nThe post-industrial part of Gdynia ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie is decorated with fascinating murals. This is the result of the Traffic Design festival, during which the wall graphics are made by artists from all over the world.\n\nCatering\n\nGdynia ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie is a place where it’s easy to get a good meal. Numerous restaurants, pubs, dumpling houses, cafÃ©s and pizzerias allow you to eat your dream dish. As befits a city by the sea, many places offer fish, including: âSmaÅ¼alnia ryb Fregataâand âBar PrzystaÅâ.\n\nPart of the restaurant, apart from an excellent menu, also offers excellent views, an example of which is the “Mondo di Vinegre” at the Emigration Museum.\n\nThe restaurant “OberÅ¼a86”, located in the Abraham House, where the “king of Kashubians” Antoni Abraham lived, serves particularly good Polish and European cuisine.\n\nGdynia ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie also offers exotic cuisine restaurants, such as “Tokyo Sushi Bar & Restaurant”, “Umi Ramen” or “Malika Restaurant”.
