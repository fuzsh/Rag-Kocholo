        "text": "A company based in Hong Kong controls a key part of Poland’s Gdynia port — raising national security concerns as it’s close to a dock used to unload U.S. and NATO military aid for Ukraine.\n\nPolish authorities say they are keeping a watchful eye on the Gdynia Container Terminal (GCT), operated by Hutchison Port Holdings, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-headquartered CK Hutchison Holdings. The government is under pressure to designate the terminal as critical infrastructure.\n\n“Everything that has to do with Poland’s security is being analyzed permanently,” Deputy Defense Minister Cezary Tomczyk told POLITICO. “That obviously includes the issue of supplying arms to Ukraine and we are doing what we can to maximize the security of the process.”\n\nGCT is a full-service container and heavy-lift handling facility in Gdynia, occupying around 20 hectares and almost 600 meters of waterfront in the Baltic Sea port.\n\nThe terminal sits right across from a Polish special forces base and navy shipyard where Polish missile frigates are being built. The U.S. Department of Defense temporarily uses a nearby dock to unload NATO and U.S. military gear for northeastern Europe, as well as equipment bound for Ukraine.\n\nSecurity concerns are not only limited to Hutchison’s proximity to key NATO and Polish military assets in the port, but also to the company’s ability to interfere with the port’s accessibility.\n\nIn August, equipment for the American army was to be unloaded on a dock near GCT. However the ship’s bow protruded about 50 meters into Hutchison’s zone, and the company refused to consent to the unloading. The Gdynia port authorities tried to intervene to find a solution, but ultimately the transshipment of the military equipment was unsuccessful.\n\nWar worries\n\nThe war raging in Ukraine is serving as a wake-up call for the Polish authorities, and they are now discussing ways of securing critical infrastructure in the country.\n\nLast month, the Polish parliament’s Special Forces Committee, chaired by Marek Biernacki, an MP with the Third Way, part of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s ruling coalition, discussed the protection of critical infrastructure objects in Polish maritime areas — focused on offshore wind farms and the port in Gdynia.\n\n“The committee has prepared an opinion to the prime minister indicating that there is a lack of a legal environment for large investments that should be protected as part of critical infrastructure,” Biernacki told the Polish media.\n\n“We will apply to the director of the government security center for the so-called Chinese wharf, which is part of the port in Gdynia and leased to a company with Chinese capital, to be formally recognised as a critical infrastructure facility,” Biernacki told Poland’s Dziennik Gazeta Prawna newspaper.\n\nIf that happens, Hutchison would have to report to the government about its security operations, but it wouldn’t impact the port’s business operations in peacetime.\n\nHutchison Port Holdings did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCheap lease\n\nIt’s not the only friction over the Hutchison investment.\n\nThe company has an exceptionally cheap lease on the site until 2089 thanks to a deal signed in 2007. Hutchison pays 294,000 złoty (€68,000) per year, the city of Gdynia told the O2 news portal.\n\n“It seems the Chinese port entity is only paying a tiny fraction, about 1 percent, of what other companies must pay to operate today in such a strategic port area,” said Tony Housh, chair of the American Chamber of Commerce in Poland. “This clearly indicates not only unfair competitive advantage to all other operators in Gdynia, Gdańsk and Szczecin, but also that the Polish state is potentially losing hundreds of millions of dollars during this unusual lease. This is on top of concerns about national security and protection of trade data.”\n\nThe Polish concerns are part of a broader EU worry about the impact of Chinese investments in port infrastructure.\n\nIn January, the European Parliament adopted a report highlighting the dangers of the bloc opening its strategic ports to foreign investments.\n\n“We have to label our ports, especially the ones listed in the TEN-T plans, as critical infrastructure so we are better equipped to screen investments and ward off undue influence of foreign actors,” said Tom Berendsen, a Dutch member of the European Parliament who is shepherding the report. “We also direly need legislation to take back control of port infrastructure in critical situations.”\n\nA report from the European Parliamentary Research Service last year found that Chinese state companies such as COSCO Shipping and China Merchants Port Holdings were involved in port investments in 10 EU countries. Hutchison Port Holdings was also flagged in the report.\n\nLast year, the German government went ahead with a decision to sell 24.9 percent of a Hamburg port terminal to COSCO, despite security concerns and opposition from within the ruling coalition."
