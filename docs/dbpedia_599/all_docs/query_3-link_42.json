        "text": "On 1 September 1939, shortly after the first shots on the Westerplatte were fired, the city of Gdańsk itself also became a battlefield when German SS troops took possession of Polish buildings and institutions.\n\nIn the days before the war, the Polish citizens in the city had prepared themselves to defend the Polish institutions in Gdańsk. About 50 armed postmen defended the Polish Post Office for about 14 hours. After the death of some of their colleagues they surrendered. While leaving the building carrying a white flag, director Jan Michoń was killed. Later the other postmen were executed as franc-tireurs, in one of the first war crimes of the Second World War. Only in 1995 did a German court pardon the postmen). In his novel The Tin Drum, Günter Grass gave an emotional insight into these events.\n\nThat same morning, German SS, SA, police and Gestapo units also arrested some 1500 members of the Polish minority. They were gathered in the Victoriaschule near the city centre. Many of them were deported to a newly established concentration camp in Stutthof. 67 of them were executed, and many died in camps and elsewhere as a result of German terror. Polish citizens in the nearby city of Gdynia were also expelled from their homes and directed to central Poland. The Polish inhabitants of Pomerania were terrorised throughout the war, put in concentration camps and executed for being Polish. The elites of the Polish nation especially, like teachers and catholic priests, were in the Nazis’ sights.\n\nIt was also on 1 September 1939 that Gauleiter of Gdańsk (Nazi Provincial Governor), Albert Forster, announced the reunion of Gdańsk with the German Reich in a radio speech."
