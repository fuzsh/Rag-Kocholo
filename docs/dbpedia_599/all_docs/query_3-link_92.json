        "text": "Understand\n\n[edit]\n\nGdynia is one of the youngest and modern cities in Poland. In the early 1900s Gdynia was a little village, but after World War I and establishing the Free City of Danzig, the Polish Government decided to build a deep-sea port. Construction began in 1921. The city rose fast in the 1920s and 1930s, so architecture and planning reflect European trends of the day - Modernism. The city continues to grow to this day. Today, Gdynia is a modern city with a population of 244,000 (2021) and is the second major Polish port in the Baltic Sea after Gdańsk.\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nThe nearest airport is in nearby Gdańsk Lech Wałęsa Airport GDN IATA, 25 km from the city centre. The airport is a popular destination for low-price flights from many European airports. Domestic flights are also available.\n\nThe regional trains SKM operate between the airport (Gdańsk Port Lotniczy) and the main station of Gdynia (Gdynia Główna). The fastest train takes 26 minutes.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nGdynia is one of the biggest railway hubs in Poland with connections to Warsaw, Kraków, Poznań, Wrocław, Katowice, Szczecin, Toruń, Białystok and many others. A few international trains, including daily service from Berlin are available too. All mainline trains are operated by PKP\n\nIf travelling in the coastal area Gdańsk, Sopot and Gdynia, then look out for the SKM commuter train. Travel from nearby Gdańsk takes about 35 minutes (6.50 zł) with the frequent SKM urban trains, which leave every 8–20 minutes.\n\nBy boat\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom Sweden: Karlskrona-Gdynia by Stena Line. Day trip for a passenger with bike costs around 240 zł.\n\nAdditionally, Żegluga Gdańska runs a once-weekly ferry from the small port city of Baltiysk, in the Kaliningrad enclave.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nSee: PKS\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom Gdańsk by the route E75 just east along the coast.\n\nSee\n\n[edit]\n\nGdynia is a relatively modern city and one will not find many historical buildings. The oldest building in Gdynia is the 13th-century St. Michael Archangel's Church in Oksywie. There is also a 17th-century neo-Gothic manor house located in the Folwarczna Street in Orłowo.\n\nHowever, what most tourists look for Gdynia deals with its recent past. In the harbour there are two museum ships anchored, the ORP Błyskawica destroyer and the Dar Pomorza Tall Ship frigate. Gdynia is also famous for its numerous examples of early 20th-century architecture, especially monumentalism and early functionalism. Świętojańska street and Kościuszki square are also worth mentioning.\n\nThe surrounding hills and the coastline attract many nature lovers. Leisure pier and cliff-like coastline in Kępa Redłowska as well as the surrounding Reservation Park are also popular. A 1.5-km-long promenade leads from the marina in the city centre to the beach in Redłowo. Most of Gdynia can be seen from Kamienna Góra (54 metres asl) or a newly built observation point near Chwaszczyno.\n\nYou can also take hydrofoil or ship trip to Gdańsk Westerplatte, Hel or just see port.\n\nGdynia is the only city in Poland and one of the few in Europe to pride itself on such long and accessible seashore. You will easily catch great views of the sea, and also find long promenades, beautiful waterfronts, marinas, yacht clubs and great sand beaches.\n\nBeaches\n\n[edit]\n\nPlaża Miejska (city beach) is in the centre, next to Gdynia Marina and Bulwar Nadmorski (Seaside Promenade).\n\nPlaża w Orłowie is in Orłowo District, next to beautiful Orłowo cliffs. Reach by SKM Gdynia Orłowo or trolleybus lines 21 and 26.\n\nOsada Rybacka (Fishermen Village) is a quite wild beach in Oksywie district - besides suntanning, you can see beautiful, old fishermen equipment and a funicular for fish transport. It is better to go there in the morning, as in the late afternoon the sun is hidden by cliffs. The beach is accessible by 152 bus line from the city centre - get out at the terminus of the line in Oksywie Dickmana direction.\n\nMuseums\n\n[edit]\n\nSightseeing\n\n[edit]\n\nKamienna Góra with nice panoramic view, also possible to see Hel peninsula.\n\nCliff and wooden pier in Orłowo. Reach by SKM Gdynia Orłowo or trolleybus lines 21 and 26.\n\nTrójmiejski park krajobrazowy (Tricity Sightseeing Park) - a forest-park surrounding all tricity, with many sightseeing spots.\n\nBulwar Nadmorski (Seaside Promenade)."
