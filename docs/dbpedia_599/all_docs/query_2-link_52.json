In addition, the advantage of the Shipyard is its unique location in the immediate vicinity of the main Polish naval base, meaning Naval Port in Gdynia.\n\nHowever, as in almost every business, also in PGZ Naval Shipyard, the key factor is the workforce â€“ appropriately qualified and aware of the importance of projects with special importance for Polish state security.\n\nPGZ Naval Shipyard is the oldest Polish shipyard operating since 1922, continuing the tradition of the Naval Shipyard and established in Puck before World War II, and then transferred to Gdynia Naval Port Workshops.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the main task of the Shipyard was precisely the maintenance, servicing and construction of new vessels for the Polish Navy, and the plant inseparably entered the history of both the Polish Navy and the city of Gdynia."
