        "text": "In order to understand why Gdansk was a target for Hitler in 1939, we really need to understand at least some of its history. From its 10th century beginnings right through to the 20th century, Gdansk has been the subject of who it actually belongs to.\n\nThe Polish king Mieszko I was said to be the city’s founder, sometime during the 980s. Early trading merchants were quick to see its potential, and it wasn’t long before the town started to attract interest from elsewhere – not all of it welcome: Pomeranian Princes, Polish Kings and the Margraves of Brandenburg all thought that they had the right to take control of Gdansk, but it was the Teutonic Knights who ultimately took over.\n\nThis band of Germanic Catholic crusaders arrived in 1308 at the invitation of the Polish rulers who wanted help in repelling the Margraves of Brandenburg, but after falling out with their hosts, the Knights decided to deal with things their own way – by slaughtering the locals and installing their own colony of German settlers. The Knights may have been ruthless, but Gdansk (now called by its German name of Danzig) began to flourish and became an important member of the influential Hanseatic League.\n\nAfter outstaying their welcome, the Knights were kicked out of the city in 1454 and Danzig returned to Poland, but only nominally, because by now it had effectively become an independent city state. The scene was set. Danzig/Gdansk was now an autonomous economic power, but belonging to Poland and predominantly populated by Germans.\n\nThe city eventually became the most prosperous port on the Baltic coast, and remained so until 1792, when it was taken over by Prussia after Poland’s defeat in the Polish-Russian War. There was a brief respite in 1807 when Napoleon’s successes in the region allowed the city to become the Free City of Danzig, but after his defeat at the Battle of Leipzig in 1813, it came back under Prussian control, and the city’s links with Poland were severed.\n\nPrussia, under Otto von Bismarck, was the driving force behind the unification of the German states in 1871 which meant that Danzig/Gdansk was now German, but defeat in WWI was to change all that. The Armistice on 11th November 1918 was not the end of the war, but the end of the fighting. Germany and the other Central Powers had been beaten on the battlefield but a signed agreement was needed to cement a peace. At Versailles a treaty was drawn up by members of the Allied powers that amounted to an ultimatum. It was a case of ‘sign it or we’ll resume the battle’. Germany signed it, but it must have felt like a surrender.\n\nThe conditions set out by the Treaty of Versailles were far reaching, and looking back, many experts think that they were too harsh. 25,000 square miles of territory, along with 7 million people no longer belonged to Germany and the financial reparations eventually brought Germany to its knees economically.\n\nAs far as Danzig/Gdansk was concerned, Germany now had to recognise Poland as an independent country, and for historical reasons, included Eastern Pomerania in which the city was located. This enabled Poland to have access to the sea, but it also isolated East Prussia from the rest of Germany. This Polish Corridor excluded Danzig due to its majority German population, and came under the sovereignty of the League of Nations (forerunner of the United Nations) as a Free City. Just like the situation after the Teutonic Knights left, the city was once again independent, but really a part of Poland with the majority of the population being German.\n\nFighting in those WWI trenches were Winston Churchill and Adolf Hitler. They never ever met, but were to become leaders of their respective countries and adversaries again in 1939. Their experiences in the trenches must have had a profound affect on both men, but it seemed particularly so for Hitler. He never forgot how the young men of the Kindercorps were sacrificed on the battlefield, the way that Germany was forced to surrender and the consequences of the capitulation.\n\nThe Treaty of Versailles left Germany in a state of turmoil and political upheaval, and in 1919 Hitler joined the newly-formed German Workers Party, which was founded in protest against the terms of the treaty. The party promoted German pride and anti-semitism, and in 1921 Hitler became its leader under the new name of the Nationalist Socialist Workers (Nazi) Party. His rousing speeches, coupled with the severe economic depression in 1929 saw the Nazi Party win 230 out of 608 seats in the 1932 German parliamentary elections, and the following year Adolf Hitler became Germany’s new Reich Chancellor.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Hitler started to control every part of German life, firstly by banning all other political parties, and then by persecuting those who he considered unfit for his new Germany. Jews in particular were singled out, but communists, Gypsies, homosexuals, handicapped people (both physically and mentally), intellectuals and artists were all targeted. On 9th November 1938, over 7,000 Jewish shops, synagogues, schools and hospitals were smashed up by Nazi troops and sympathizers, giving rise to the name of Kristallnacht (the night of broken glass). Over 30,000 Jewish men were rounded up and sent to concentration camps – and this was just the start.\n\nHitler was also turning his attention to foreign policy. Against the rules of the Versailles Treaty, he started to re-build the armed forces, and in 1936 re-occupied the German Rhineland. In 1938 he annexed Austria, and then through the Munich Agreement in September, annexed Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia.\n\nUp to this point, the WWI victors had chosen to resist confrontation, but when there were signs that Poland was to be next, Britain and France gave Hitler another ultimatum. If he carried out his threat to attack, then it would be seen as a declaration of war – but this time, Hitler’s Germany was not only better prepared, but almost relishing the prospect.\n\nIn August 1939 the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Germany gave Hitler another boost. The non-aggression pact between two former enemies wasn’t just a peace deal, but a plan that involved a secret protocol covering the spheres of influence of both Germany and Russia. This plan included Poland, the Baltic States and Finland. As far as Poland was concerned, the country was to be divided up between Hitler and Stalin. On September 1st Germany invaded Western Poland and on the 17th Russia attacked from the east.\n\nThe opening assault on Poland took place at the Free City of Danzig, not just because it had a majority German population, but because its location in the Polish Corridor was where East Prussia had been cut off from the rest of Germany. The attack began where the Martwa Wisla meets the sea – Westerplatte.\n\nThe Free City of Danzig included an area around the city which included the Westerplatte peninsula, and the map above shows the harbour channel separating the two. The Treaty of Versailles, if you remember, created the Polish Corridor to allow Poland access to the sea, but Danzig was 98% German.\n\nThe Russian Revolution was also having an impact on the region at the time, and in the aftermath of WWI, hostilities broke out between Poland and the newly formed Soviet Union. The Polish-Soviet War lasted between 1919 and 1921 and led to the League of Nations allowing Poland the right to build an ammunitions transit depot on Westerplatte to safeguard their access to the sea.\n\nThe depot was enclosed on three sides by water, and on the landward side by a wall which allowed access for trains to run in and out of the depot to and from the harbour. The conditions laid down by the League of Nations meant that the depot was restricted to a minor defensive role, but that still didn’t make the Danzig population particularly enthusiastic about it. As tensions rose between Germany and its European neighbours, the garrison was secretly reinforced, but it still only consisted of a handful of small guardhouses, barracks and a couple of hundred men hidden amongst the woods.\n\nOn August 25th 1939, the battleship Schleswig-Holstein sailed into Danzig Harbour, ostensibly on a courtesy call, but on board were 225 marines under the command of Captain Gustav Kleikamp. With the support of 1,500 men from the land-based SS Heimwehr “Danzig”, an attack on Westerplatte was proposed for the following day, but had to be delayed until later.\n\nOn the morning of September 1st at 04.45, the Schleswig-Holstein opened fire on the depot. The idea was to soften up any form of defence so that the marines could overrun the garrison without too much trouble. The Danzig police had, after all, informed Kleikamp that “Westerplatte would be taken in 10 minutes”. Not everyone thought it would be that easy, but even so, they didn’t think it was going to be too difficult either.\n\nEven the Poles didn’t expect the assault to last long, but in the end, the garrison under Major Henryk Sucharski, held out until 7th September. I’m not going to describe the battle in detail, but the casualty list speaks for itself. There were 50 Germans killed and around 150 injured, while the Polish casualties were 15 killed and around 40 wounded. Having survived air, sea and land attack for seven days, Sucharski surrendered to Kleikamp, who was so impressed with his arch-rival’s stubborn defence that he allowed him to keep his ceremonial sabre."
