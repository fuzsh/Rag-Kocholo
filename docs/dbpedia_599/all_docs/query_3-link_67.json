The port of Gdynia was heavily impacted during World War II, resulting in a serious risk of unexploded ordnances in the seabed. Together with the company ESC, we conducted survey and scanning activities during which we detected several explosives. Only after their dismantling could we start the dredging and bottom reinforcement operations in complete safety.\n\nThoroughly protecting the seabed\n\nBesides dredging and backfilling, we also performed reinforcement works in certain areas of the port to protect the seabed against erosion and water scour. For this, we worked closely together with our subcontractor Strabag. The dredging works run in parallel to the installation of the bottom reinforcement. This and the fact we are operating in an active port make meticulous planning and daily communication with all parties key. All works are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2023.\n\nMore details about this project?\n\nThe port of Gdynia was Cosette’s maiden project.

Thanks to her compact size, this vessel type is very manoeuvrable and ideal to reach the most difficult nooks and crannies in ports. Cosette proved that perfectly in Gdynia, where she especially dredged areas close to the quay walls and in difficult corners.\n\nCosette\n\nBackhoe dredger\n\nSpecifications\n\nThis dredger is a pontoon equipped with a hydraulic excavator that excavates the soil and discharges it into a split hopper barge.

Since 2022, we are deepening certain port areas from -13.5 to -16 metres to facilitate large container ships and bulk carriers. In other zones, we perform backfilling works to elevate the seabed and stabilise quay walls. All this to the same end: to ensure job security in and around the port, create additional work opportunities, attract investment and guarantee further development of the city. Gdynia can rest assured: its place in the world economy is secured.\n\nSuccessful as the port has been, its future hangs in the balance. Ships have become larger and larger, and the port is no longer equipped to welcome the jumbo vessels that currently sail the Baltic Sea. Time to take action!\n\nIn northern Poland along the Baltic Sea lies Gdynia. Historically a small fishing village, but this changed in the 1920s. Eager to take the region to a higher economic and political level, the Polish government decided to put Gdynia’s strategic location to good use. A brand-new port was constructed, along with docks, piers, a railway and other industrial installations.
