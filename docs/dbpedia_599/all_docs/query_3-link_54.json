        "text": "A visit to the ORP Blyskawica, Gdynia\n\nThose who decide to visit Gdynia, a city located just a 30 minute-drive from Gdansk will be able to see the world’s oldest destroyer.\n\nThe ORP Blyskawica destroyer was built together with its sister vessel “Grom” in 1937 in an English shipyard in Cowes. A few days before WW2 both destroyers left Poland and joined the Royal Navy – it was called operation Peking (to avoid being destroyed in the first days of WW2). For whole period of WW2, the ORP Blyskawica fought against the Nazis in many countries except Poland! She became famous due to her heroic defence of the Isle of Wight during an air raid by 160 German bombers. In the first months after WW2, she participated in Operation Deadline, destroying over 100 German U-Boats (U-Boots).\n\nSince 1976 the ORP Blyskawica has served as a vessel museum. If you come by cruise ship to Gdynia, and you choose one of my tours in Gdansk I will show you the ORP Blyskawica on the way.
