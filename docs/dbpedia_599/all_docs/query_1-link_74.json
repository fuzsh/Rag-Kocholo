        "text": "Gdansk has been gorgeously rebuilt but is very popular. Understand that the historic core will feel a lot more touristy than Warsaw. The two biggest attractions for me were the Solidarity Center, where I spent about an entire day, and the World War II Museum, where I spent twenty hours. Yes, I am odd, but that is one time-consuming historical museum! It really does take 20 hours if you want to read all the information posted in English and watch all the English-accessible videos. I also enjoyed a much quicker visit to the Amber Museum. If you're bothered by crowds and have no particular interest in 20th-century history, you could see the beauty of Gdansk in one full day and might be ready to head to a less mobbed city. If you're into WWII and Cold War history, you'll need at least 3 nights for Gdansk alone, and that will not allow you to absorb everything in the WWII Museum\n\nI didn't go to Sopot for lack of time. I popped over to Gdynia to see the Emigration Museum. It's very modern and would be especially interesting to people with a family history of emigration (even if not from Poland) recent enough that it's part of the family lore. That is not my situation, but I was still glad to see the museum. I recall a long walk from the train station to the museum; I imagine a bus would have taken me at least part of the way, but I like to walk. I'd say the Emigration Museum is skippable if you have limited time and no strong interest in the topic. I'm afraid I don't know what else there is to see; I spent a lot of time in Poland in 2018 and a bit more this year, but it was impossible to see everything.\n\nFinland (more expensive) and the three Baltic countries (don't forget Lithuania) are great destinations. There, too, I spent a lot of time indulging my interests, which include Art Nouveau architecture and art as well as 20th-century history. I ended up spending 9 to 13 days in the various capital cities, plus extra time in some very nice secondary cities. It's a very interesting area. Ground transportation between Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania isn't very fast, so changing cities will take more time than you might expect from the short distances involved.\n\nOn my 2023 Nordic/Baltic trip I headed from Lithuania to Poland, but to Bialystok rather than the north. With the current situation involving Russia and Belarus, I didn't have a lot of ground-transportation options. The annoyance that is Kaliningrad may be an issue for you as well."
