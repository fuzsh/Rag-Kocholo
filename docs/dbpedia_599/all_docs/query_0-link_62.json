The city was founded as a Polish harbor in 1926. Because of its unusual location, you will easily catch great views of the sea and beautiful scenery, and also find long promenades, beautiful waterfronts, marinas and yacht clubs.\n\nTours Excursions Transportation:\n\nVirtually everyone continues on to Gdansk (Danzig to German speakers) by cruise bus or public train. The dock is about 2 miles from the train station. On disembarking, walk 100 meters to the right to catch one of the many local taxis. A full taxi with four passengers should cost about 16-20 Zlotys (about $5-$6 US should be enough) from the dock to the station.\n\nAt the Glowna train station in Gdynia do not go to the line of ticket windows that you see when you go in. This is for long distance trains only. You instead have to go to a kiosk on the side where there is a person behind a window and get your ticket there. ATM's are available. It costs 4 zloty ($1).

The battles to liberate the city in 1945 resulted in almost total destruction.\n\nGdansk's historic center was rebuilt with great reverence; today it represents one of the richest and most lavish complexes of architectural relics in Poland. Entering the historic quarter is like walking straight into a Hansa merchants settlement. Huge stone gateways guard both entrances to the main thoroughfare. The well-proportioned tower of the town hall makes a powerful impact and the main square is surrounded by stately mansions. One of the most prominent buildings is Artus Court, formerly the residence of Gdansk's rulers. Gigantic St. Mary's Church reputedly is the largest brick church in the world, able to accommodate 25,000 people.\n\nGdansk Historical Museum\n\nThe museum is located inside the impressive Town Hall. The lavish decor almost upstages the exhibits.\n\nMaritime Museum\n\nThis museum features a model of every ship produced in the local shipyards since 1945. It is housed in the massive and largely original 15th-century Gdansk Crane once powered by human power, walking on a treadmill.\n\nNational Art Museum\n\nOne of Gdansk's major highlights is this museum. It boasts a varied collection of fabrics, chests, gold and silverware, as well as a tremendous amount of local Gothic art and sculpture. All are redolent of the town's former wealth. The museum's most prized possession is Hans Memling's colossal Last Judgment, the painter's earliest known work from 1473.\n\nSopot has a great geographical location - lying between the beautiful woods of the Tri-City Landscape Park, and the numerous sand beaches of the Bay of GdaÅsk. Sopot is known for its sanitaria many artists and endless quantities of tourists, who mainly visit the city during the summertime. Monte Casino Street (ul. BohaterÃ³w Monte Cassino) is the center of Sopot, a pedestrianized promenade.\n\nShopping and Food\n\nShop for crystal, silver and embroidered linens. Gdansk is especially known for amber (look out for fakes). which can be bought unset or, more often, crafted into silver jewelry. The major shopping area is the historic center of Gdansk. Most shops are open 7 days a week\n\nCurrency:\n\nThe legal tender in Poland is the Polish zÅoty (zÅ, PLN). Poland is not expected to adopt the common European currency Euro (â¬) in soon, but it can be used to pay in many bigger shops (\"hypermarkets\") even now. Remember to always check the conversion rates though!\n\nCurrency Converter\n\nCommunication:\n\nNon-Polish speakers will find that most of the younger generation (35 and under), speak, or at least understand, English reasonably well.\n\nNo Wifi or internet at the Francuskie Pier.\n\nFree wireless access at Pomorskie pier.\n\nFree wifi in all the old town of Gdansk.\n\nOpening Hours and Holidays:\n\nShopping hours Mon-Fri 1000-1800/2000 and Sat 1000-1300/1600. âNight shops' open 24 hours.
