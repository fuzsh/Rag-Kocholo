        "text": "I’m updating this post in early August 2024 after my last visit to Gdynia City Beach and the surrounding beach.\n\nIf you’re based in Gdańsk, it’s very convenient to hop on an SKM train to Gdynia. On my most recent visit to Gdynia on August 2, 2024, I didn’t travel to Gdynia Main Train Station (Gdynia Główna) – the closest stop to Gdynia City Beach. Instead, I got off at Gdynia Redłowo Station and walked to Kępa Redłowska. This is a large nature preserve and seaside park on former military grounds. A convenient place to enter the park is by the Street workout Park Redłowo which is marked on Google Maps. It’s at the end of Mikołaja Kopernika Street:\n\nKępa Redłowska and Redłowo Beach\n\nWalking briskly, I reached Kępa Redłowska in around 20 minutes. Do bear in mind that it’s a moderate uphill climb up Lucjana Cylkowskiego Street.\n\nI then cut through the forest and soon reached Redłowo Public Beach (Plaża publiczna Redłowo). Due to the lack of facilities and parking here, this beach never gets crowded – even at the beginning of August. The picture below was taken further up the shoreline a short distance from where the seafront promenade begins:\n\nThe Feliks Nowowiejski Seafront Promenade\n\nI started my walk along the Seafront Promenade in Gdynia at its southern tip close to the “Coming Home” fish sculpture. During my walk up to Sea Towers, I came across a range of facilities and attractions.\n\nJust a few words, though, about the promenade before I provide information about these facilities and attractions.\n\nThe Seafront Promenade in Gdynia is named after the famous Polish composer, Feliks Nowowiejski (1877-1946). In 1924, Nowowiejski composed the opera “The Legend of the Baltic Sea”, inspired by the holidays he spent in Gdynia.\n\nCommissioned in 1969, the Seafront Promenade is one of the most favourite leisure spots for both locals and tourists. It stretches around 1.5 kilometres between Gdynia City Beach and Redłowo Beach. In addition to its recreational qualities, the promenade also assumes a hydro-technical function in that it protects the seashore, particularly the slopes of Kamienna Góra, against storms.\n\nThe promenade is not just a haven for walkers. Cyclists can also enjoy the cycle path which runs along the entire promenade. There are also facilities for physical exercise and a children’s playground.\n\nNow, I will share some of the best sights and facilities around Gdynia City Beach, beginning with the “Coming Home” fish sculpture:\n\nThe “Coming Home” Fish Sculpture\n\nThe sculpture “Coming Home” is situated at the southern end of the Seafront Boulevard, close to the entrance to the beach in Gdynia Redłowo. Portraying two silver salmon returning to the rivers, the sculpture is a gift from the residents of Gdynia’s sister city Seattle. It was created by American artist Louise McDowell and funded by the Seattle-Gdynia Sister City Association. The sculpture on the Boulevard is only a copy as the original is located in Gdynia City Hall.\n\nGdynia City Beach\n\nAfter much walking on sand, admiration of views across the Gulf of Gdańsk and a fair bit of picture taking, I reached the southern tip of Gdynia City Beach.\n\nGdynia City Beach covers an area of 40.5 thousand square metres and is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful beaches on the Polish coast. A 200-metre section of the beach is a guarded swimming area.\n\nNear the beach, there are modern sanitary facilities. The beach is disasbled-friendly, owing to wooden boardwalks which facilitate wheelchair movement right to the waterfront and marina without any hindrance.\n\nAt the top end of the beach, you can hook a right just before Del Mar restaurant to walk along the wooden boardwalk which runs across the beach right round to Gdynia Marina."
