        "text": "In the run-up to the round, because already the 85th anniversary of the birth of ORP „Blyskawica” – the hero’s ship, and the celebrations related to it, which will take place on November 25, 2022, in Gdynia, we visited this excellent ship – a war hero of the Polish Navy, to talk to its commander Lieutenant Commander Paweł Ogórek and his crew.\n\nORP Blyskawica is a hero ship, not only for Gdynia but also for the whole of Poland, as the only one in the history of the Polish Navy awarded the Golden Cross of Virtuti Militari, the highest Polish decoration awarded for bravery on the battlefield.\n\nThe ORP „Blyskawica” crew, together with the Society of Friends of the Ship, the Blyskawica Museum, and the Naval Museum in Gdynia, are organizing a solemn celebration on November 25, this year, related to the round anniversary of the ship.\n\nWe asked Lieutenant Commander Paweł Ogórek if he could tell us more about it. Here’s what he told us: „For every man, the most important date in his life is the date of his birth, which he later celebrates and celebrates every year. A birthday is the most important thing that could happen to a person. Therefore, it is the same with the ship. The date of the first raising of the war flag, i.e., the incorporation of this ship into the Polish Navy, is the most important date for it. On November 25, 1937, the war flag was solemnly raised on the ORP „Blyskawica” for the first time and incorporated into the Polish Navy. Until 1947, ORP „Blyskawica” performed tasks in the composition of the Polish Navy in the Baltic Sea and during World War II in the Polish Armed Forces in the West, and when in July 1947, it returned from the turmoil of war until 1967 (again this magical seven always occurs here) it served in the Composition of the Polish Navy performing training and combat tasks. After the tragic accident that took place here on board (because of the failure of the steam system, seven members of its crew died), ORP „Blyskawica” still served as an anti-aircraft defence battery in Świnoujście, and from 1975 it was decided to replace ORP „Burza” as a museum ship.\n\nRegardless of its current function, remember that ORP „Blyskawica” is a ship still in service. This is not a museum exhibit. Here there is still a crew consisting of non-commissioned officers and sailors, walking in uniforms of the Polish Navy, who are soldiers and sailors of the Polish Navy. And this year, on November 25, we celebrate the beautiful, round, 85th anniversary of raising the flag. For every crew, for every ship, it’s the biggest celebration that can only be in the history of ship service, and that’s what we’ll be celebrating this year. Let us hope that many of our friends and sympathizers will also be with us.”\n\nLet us briefly recall the history of the construction of this ship.\n\nORP „Blyskawica” was built in a small port in the east and west of Cowes in the north of the Isle of Wight in Great Britain. The ship was built at East Cowes, launched in 1936 and fitted into West Cowes on the opposite side of the river Medina. Representatives of the Polish Navy were able to work with the J. Samuel White shipyard personnel to make sure that it met Polish requirements.\n\nORP „Blyskawica” was put into operation in 1937. In September 1939, and it was one of three Polish destroyers (apart from it, they were ORP „GROM” and ORP „BURZA”), which before the outbreak of the war were delegated to Great Britain by order of their superiors and were the first Polish troops to cooperate with British forces after Great Britain joined the war.\n\nWhenever she needed repairs, re-armaments, or modifications during the war, she returned to J. Samuel Whites at Cowes. Between 1937 and 1947 she spent 24 months in the city. ORP „Blyskawica” was in the shipyard in Cowes in May 1942 and repelled the heaviest bombing raid the German air force made on this city during the entire war. In a heroic uprising of the crew, ORP „Blyskawica” defended Cowes, saving the inhabitants and the city from destruction.\n\nOur next question to Commander Paweł Ogórek was precisely about the celebration of this event in Cowes, which is, as we know, very solemn. We asked him how long it had been going on. Since when are the representatives of ORP „Blyskawica” invited, and how long have they been participating in these celebrations? After the participation and interest in the history of our ships, we know that on the part of the British, they attach great importance to this event.\n\n„In 1992, and it was on the initiative of the British side through our Embassy, such an initiative was taken for the first time. Perhaps it related to the political changes that took place in Poland then, with a fuller opening of our country to the world. Then there is such an initiative that as part of the 50th anniversary – the round anniversary – of the defence of Cowes by ORP „Blyskawica”, a Polish delegation will participate in these celebrations. Contrary to appearances, ORP „Blyskawica” throughout the post-war period was one of those elements that connected the Polish reality with Great Britain, whatever it was. In 1992, after these political changes and after the initiatives taken, in the solemn celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the defence of Cowes. The anniversary of the defence of the city of Cowes by ORP „Blyskawica” was attended by a delegation of two Polish ships. At that time, ORP „Wodnik” and ORP „Kaszub” stood on the roadstead of the port of Cowes – as many as two Polish ships. At that time, as far as I remember, there was a military orchestra, as well as a representative company,” – explained Capt. Lieutenant Ogórek.\n\n„It was probably the first time when we celebrated this ceremony so solemnly and officially because the arrival of people in uniforms and in greater numbers, however, already testifies to the high rank of this meeting, which for the first time was initiated and later became a cyclical meeting. Every year, a delegation from ORP „Blyskawica” in the number of several people, depending on many factors, but let’s say so to five people, takes part in the celebrations. Together with the British, we tried to maintain that a ship sails for the so-called round anniversaries every five years. Every year, a delegation from ORP „Blyskawica” plus, of course, Polish officers serving in Great Britain, in the international military or NATO institutions also participate in the celebrations. The Embassy of the Republic of Poland, of course, also. The pandemic period has inevitably forced some restrictions on us. Fortunately, this cooperation was successful again this year. It was the first time I had attended these celebrations, and I was deeply moved and surprised positively, but also full of admiration that the British are celebrating this anniversary so much. Because I will be honest, I know there are many different types of anniversaries in Poland because through the history of history, a lot of random events, wars, and battles have rolled, and I have the impression that sometimes a little, we will celebrate an anniversary because of a bit of habit or even a routine. On the other hand, I was very, very positively surprised by the attitude of the British people towards us. Then people in uniforms, in Polish uniforms, those uniforms that they remember, visit the inhabitants of Cowes, although most of them were rather well born after the war, but they remember, cultivate tradition and are full of gratitude all the time. ORP „Blyskawica” because they built it well, and repaid them by saving their families and homes. I think that since ORP „Blyskawica” is still in service, it is the link that binds it all together and it remains for us to rejoice and keep our fingers crossed that it will be possible to continue it, regardless of the passage of years and history.” It should be noted here that we, the Polish diaspora in Great Britain, are really looking forward to the representatives of ORP „Blyskawica” every year, and that these celebrations will take place and that we will take part in them. So, for the Polish community in the UK, it is also a considerable ennoblement. It shows that as Poles, we took part in the action at sea and not only in the air – because the history in the UK is more focused on Poles taking part in the Battle of Britain because it is such a media topic. We had a lot of Polish air squadrons in the RAF. People know about the exploits of Polish airmen, but they know very little about what Polish sailors did for the British. And this is something that needs to be discussed as much as possible”, said Capt. Lieutenant Ogórek.\n\nAccording to the inhabitants of Cowes in the UK, their city survived only thanks to the Poles and Blyskawica. More about their gratitude in our article The residents of the Isle of Wight paid tribute to the Poles who saved the island from a German attack in 1942.\n\nOur guide, who has been serving on this ship since January 1993, i.e., almost 30 years – Senior Staff Ensign of the Navy, Dariusz Chełmowski, whose function on Blyskawica is a ship’s boatswain, told us more about the history and today of ORP Blyskawica.\n\nWe asked our guide why Blyskawica is so essential to the history of Poland.\n\n„Blyskawica is very important because this ship during the Second World War, like the decks of all Polish ships that were stationed in Great Britain, was an independent territory of the Polish state. The decks of the ships are extraterritorial. Poland was occupied by the Germans and Russians during the Second World War, and the decks of Polish ships were then the only democratic territory of the Polish state. Blyskawica, during the Second World War, took part in it almost continuously – and this from the first to the last day of the war. Among other things, from the third day of the war – September 3, 1939. Blyskawica patrolled part of the coastal waters of Great Britain. On the second of September, she was immediately brought under the command of the British Admiralty and performed tasks for the Royal Navy. While patrolling the coastal waters, on September 7, 1939, Blyskawica came across a German submarine, which threw bombs, severely damaging it. Another very important naval campaign in which Blyskawica took part was the Battle of Narvik, in which Blyskawica’s twin – ORP Grom, was sunk. Two aerial bombs fell next to Błyskawica, hitting ORP Grom. One exploded at the height of the stern, making a hole in the ammunition chamber number 3, but it was not yet a fatal blow, while the second bomb exploded near the amidships, and the explosion of this bomb broke Grom in half, and it sank within two and a half minutes. 59 Poles and one British were killed. They did not die directly because of the explosion of these bombs, but only because the hatches jammed, which blocked the sailors’ escape routes because of the ship’s breakthrough. And immediately after this event, emergency hatches were installed on ORP Błyskawica. So, it can be said that the tragic experience of ORP Grom improved the emergency procedure on Błyskawica,” explained Senior Staff Ensign of the Navy Dariusz Chełmowski.\n\nORP Błyskawica participates in the most important public holidays. Also, this year, she celebrated Polish Army Day on August 15, which was very solemn. Every year, ORP Blyskawica, like all other military units in Poland, very loudly celebrate the most important holiday for soldiers, i.e., the Polish Army Day, which is celebrated on August 15. Blyskawica is annually involved in all national holidays, starting with the 3rd of May and the Days of the Sea. The last Sunday of June is a holiday of the Navy, August 15 – the Day of the Polish Army, November 11 is the regaining Independence, or sailors’ memorable holiday – November 28, when Józef Piłsudski recreated the Navy by his decree. However, when it comes to August 15, as every year, Blyskawica takes an active part, and at 12 o’clock, after reading special orders and a special occasional appeal, Blyskawica performs a Christmas salute consisting of 21 shots. This is the highest form of honouring this holiday by the ship and other holidays, such as May 3. August 15 and November 11.\n\nNot everyone knows the construction of Blyskawica used the latest Polish technical thought, and the technologies and improvements on this ship were specially adapted to its war needs.\n\nDuring the construction of Błyskawica, several technological innovations were used which were not previously used in warships. During the construction, Polish engineers suggested changing the design at every stage to optimize and modernize the ship to extremely high standards. Among other things, the Poles suggested that as many as 14 bulkheads should be created, which resulted in the creation of 15 watertight compartments, which resulted in more excellent protection against sinking. The two largest watertight compartments, i.e., machine-boiler compartments, could be completely flooded, and the ship maintained positive buoyancy. Other fleets built fewer watertight compartments, which caused a greater risk of sinking because it was enough to flood one compartment, that is, the torpedo made a hole in some watertight compartments, and this often caused the sinking of this ship.\n\nA professional guide to this aspect was offered by our guide to ORP Blyskawica, Dariusz Chełmowski: „On Blyskawica, Polish innovation provided the possibility of preventing sinking even when a torpedo hit. Of course, this was not a certainty, but it always allowed to avoid such events as sinking.\n\nAnother technological novelty used by the Poles was that the main armament of this ship was mounted in the axis of this ship, which often allowed to defend the ship on an almost 360-degree scale. These were 120 mm naval cannons, Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns, and torpedoes – the torpedo apparatus itself was also modernized by Polish engineers. This allowed to shoot from all types of torpedoes, which at that time were produced in the world.\n\nIt consisted in the fact that Polish engineers installed reducing sleeves in the middle of torpedo tubes, which can reduce the calibre of torpedoes. Because the British calibre 550 mm after the use of reducing sleeves could be fired with torpedoes calibre 533 mm or French torpedoes calibre 460 mm. This gave Poles incredible independence from the supplier and the freedom to choose the best equipment and weapons. Another solution ahead of the era and all fleets in the world was that on Błyskawica the naval rooms were located close to the Naval S.B., i.e., the Combat Position. This allowed the artillerymen to be able to fill their combat position, i.e., the cannon, within a few seconds when the bomb alarm was announced. And this allowed very often to repel the enemy attack in time, i.e., resulted in defence of the ship, and in many cases in the world, also sailors. If the naval spaces were on the bow, if this sailor, after the announcement of the bomb alarm, was to run to his cannon at the stern, it would last several dozen seconds or even several minutes, and sometimes this determined the life of this ship. It is undoubtedly great merit of Poles that so many new technological changes have been introduced on Blyskawica”.\n\n„Another innovation used during the construction of this ship was the design and implementation of steam rooms for sailors. Simply, the sailors had saunas – with hot water for washing and ordinary toilet bowls, which was not often found in other fleets at that time. The Poles designed their ships so that they were not only safe but also to make life more comfortable for the sailors of the Polish fleet. Polish GROM class ships had these comforts. These were the most luxurious ships when it comes to the navy,” explained Dariusz Chełmowski.\n\nThe popularity and ethos of this ship is expressed in the fact that many people come to visit ORP Blyskawica – and the greatest intensity of these visits is in June, July, and August.\n\n„These are undoubtedly the months in which we accept the most for sightseeing. Now it is on the order of about 1000-1500 people a day. The balance of the whole year is about 120 thousand visitors. Unfortunately, the last two years of the pandemic have effectively reduced this number because they were on the order of – the first year of the pandemic over 42,000, and the second year around 50,000 visitors. I do not remember anymore, but it was this order of magnitude, although normally in time, let’s say in quotation marks, „normal” Blyskawica was visited by about 120,000 people during the year” – confirmed Dariusz Chełmowski.\n\nORP Blyskawica, in addition to the museum function, serves as a representative ship of the Polish Navy. During the tremendous public holidays and visits of superiors, from the commander of the 3rd Flotilla of Ships up to and including the President of the Republic of Poland, the honorary guard and the gangway are exhibited, and the whole crew performs then in gala uniforms, and this is undoubtedly the biggest attraction in Gdynia, and it is safe to say in the whole of Poland. Then sympathizers from all over the country come to Gdynia to admire the ship. On the other hand, the gala uniform is one of the most beautiful uniforms in the world, and the maritime ceremony that the sailors from Blyskawica show confirm all this.\n\nOne of the most important and at the same time, the most sublime elements of the exhibition, which can be seen at ORP Blyskawica, is the uniform of the tragically deceased Vice Admiral Andrzej Karweta – the commander of the Polish Navy.\n\nAdmiral Andrzej Karweta, along with all the Armed Forces commanders, was part of the presidential delegation heading to Katyn to commemorate thousands of Polish officers murdered in 1940 by the Soviets. As a result of the government crash Tu 154 M, the President of the Republic of Poland Lech Kaczyński and his wife Maria died, as well as 94 people – members of the delegation, BOR officers, the crew of the plane.\n\nAndrzej Karweta (1958 – 2010) was a graduate of the Heroes of Westerplatte Naval Academy in Gdynia. As a second lieutenant in the Navy, he took his first post in the 13th Marine Division. Minesweeper Squadron in Hel – initially, he was the ship’s department’s commander and then the ship’s deputy commander. He later commanded the minesweepers ORP „Czapla” and „Mewa”, at the same time he commanded the tactical group 13. Minesweeper Squadron. In the years 1992 – 1996, he held staff and command functions in the 13th Squadron. In the following years, he was delegated to various positions in NATO structures, after returning to Poland he became in 2006 the deputy commander of the 8th Infantry Division. Coastal Defense Flotilla in Świnoujście. During this time, he studied at the National Defence Academy and then at the Royal Academy of Defense Studies in London.\n\nIn 2007, after being promoted to the rank of rear admiral, he became deputy chief of the Naval Staff in Gdynia. In the same year, President Lech Kaczyński appointed him to the rank of vice-admiral and appointed him Commander of the Navy.\n\nAndrzej Karweta was posthumously promoted to the rank of fleet admiral. On April 26, 2010, a funeral ceremony was held on board the ORP „Blyskawica” with the honorary assistance of sailors and banner postcards of all Navy units,\n\nIn the near eighty-fifth anniversary of the first raising of the ORP „Blyskawica” flag, it is still worth recalling the decorations pinned on its flag, honouring the merits of those who fought on this ship and always served for the Homeland.\n\nORP Błyskawica, during its service, was awarded:\n\n– The Golden Cross of Virtuti Militari awarded on 28 June 1987, in the fiftieth anniversary of service under the Polish flag, by the Council of State,\n\n– „Cross for Merit for the ZHP”, awarded on October 24, 1987, by the ZHP Headquarters,\n\n– Haller Ring was awarded on 10 February 2006 by the Board of the Maritime office for Veterans and Repressed Persons,\n\n– The „Pro Mari Nostro” Medal, awarded on 29 June 2014 by the Board of the Maritime and River League,\n\n– Medal „25th anniversary of the World Union of Home Army Soldiers”, awarded on September 3, 2014, by the Board of the World Union of Home Army Soldiers.\n\nAmong these decorations and medals, next to The Virtuti Militari, which is the highest honour of ORP „Blyskawica”, the Maritime Heritage Award Medal is of particular importance. The World Ship Trust gives it to the world’s best preserved historic ships. Considering that currently, in more than 50 countries there are about three thousand such units, the distinction gained by the Polish destroyer with the number 29 is even unique.\n\nAt the end of our visit to ORP Błyskawica we asked if our guide was planning any special celebrations for the 30th anniversary of his service.\n\n„I never thought about it. It will simply be a beautiful jubilee, although, as a rule, I do not celebrate such things. But I must say that I am very proud of the fact that I serve so much in the Polish Navy,” said Dariusz Chełmowski.\n\nDaily sacrifices, pride in the uniform and service for the Polish Navy, bravery and at the same time modesty and total dedication of the CREW of ORP Błyskawica – made this extraordinary ship great.\n\nAnd this tells us a lot about the incredible dedication and pride with which the Commanders and Crew perform service on the ORP Błyskawica.\n\nWe are looking forward to the upcoming celebrations of the 85th anniversary of ORP Błyskawica and we hope to join this great celebration.\n\nCongratulations on a great day today, and we wish Commander Paweł Ogórek and the entire crew of the ship all the best!\n\nAuthor: Iwona Golinska – President and Founder of „Polish Sue – Sue Ryder Association in Great Britain”.
