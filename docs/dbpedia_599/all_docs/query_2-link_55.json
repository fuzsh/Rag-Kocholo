There is the usual exchange of courtesies, and the ship's company entertains a party of local children.\n\nFull description\n\nHMS Tiger steams at 25 knots through the North Sea - HA onto the focsle shows spray breaking over the bows. Crew rouse out side fenders as Tiger approaches the Kiel Canal. The cruiser steams into the entry lock, which she shares with a small freighter Helene Clausen. The lock is flooded and Tiger enters the canal. The passage is uneventful - a low sun casts Tiger's shadow on the trees that line the canal bank. Having entered the Baltic, Tiger is taken under escort by a Soviet Riga Class frigate, one of the later types with lattice mast, pendant number 331. Tiger enters Gdynia harbour to go alongside French Quay near the old Gdynia-Amerika Line terminus. On the quayside the Polish guard of honour presents arms, a salute which is returned by the ship's Royal Marines. An Il-28 flies low over the harbour. Captain Hutchins leaves the ship to inspect the Polish guard. A large crowd watches the antics of the RM sentries posted on the quayside. The Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Navy, Rear-Admiral Studzinski, pays a visit to the ship, followed by the President of the National Council and then the British Ambassador. Sequence showing Captain Hutchins laying a wreath at the memorial to the heroes of Westerplatte. Tiger is opened to visitors. Two Polish naval ratings talk with a British counterpart. A RN helmet diver comes up from working on one of Tiger's propellers fouled by a length of wire. The Royal Marine band Beat the Retreat on the quayside. Sequence showing orphan children being entertained onboard the cruiser - for the occasion Tiger is dressed overall, and has a canvas awning spread over the quarterdeck. The children are entertained with clowns, the usual improvisations such as a bosun's chair rigged to run from the bridge down onto the boat deck, trips in the ship's launch, mock cannon fire, and music. Below decks party food is served. Tiger leaves Gdynia - crowds wave farewell. Final sequence showing Tiger cruising among islands in the approaches to Stockholm. In preparation for mooring, the accommodation ladder has been rigged over the side and hawser with buoy securing shackle faked down on the quarterdeck.\n\nPhysical description\n\n35mm\n\nObject Details\n\nCategory\n\nFilm\n\nRelated period\n\n1945-1989 (content)\n\nCreator\n\nAdmiralty (Production sponsor)\n\nProduction date\n\n1959-10\n\nPlace made\n\nGB\n\nDimensions\n\nwhole: Number Of Items/reels/tapes 1\n\nCatalogue number\n\nADM 1696\n\nOur collections information\n\nWe have over a million object records online, and we are adding to this all the time.
