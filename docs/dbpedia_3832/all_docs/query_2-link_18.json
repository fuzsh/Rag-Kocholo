        "text": "Billie could apparently “eat that girl for lunch.” But who, pray tell, is that girl?!?! The pop queen teased her new song “Lunch” at Coachella back in April, and the lyrics have had stans in a frenzy ever since. If you somehow didn’t see the clips, Billie croons: “I could eat that girl for lunch / Yeah she dances on my tongue / Tastes like she might be the one.” Over the past few months, Billie’s opened up about embracing her queer identity and writing music about the journey.\n\nThe Grammy darling’s third studio album, Hit Me Hard And Soft, will be out on May 17, so no one speak to me that day. In fact, I don’t want to hear anything but the sound of Billie’s voice for several business days after this release. “Lunch” is one of 10 new tracks that will likely explore this era of queer discovery and sexual freedom. While I’m obviously curious about the entire track list, this bop is currently dominating my brain space since most of it has been leaked. Naturally, I had to do a deep dive: Here are my theories regarding the subject of “Lunch.”\n\nBillie Wrote “Lunch” After Embracing Her Queerness\n\nIn a vulnerable Rolling Stone interview, Billie got real about her new album and newfound comfort with her queerness. She wrote “Lunch” in the midst of exploring her identity. “I wrote some of it before even doing anything with a girl, and then wrote the rest after,” the singer said, adding, “I’ve been in love with girls for my whole life, but I just didn’t understand — until, last year, I realized I wanted my face in a vagina.” There ya have it.\n\nWho Is “Lunch” About?\n\nIf I had to take an educated guess, I would say actress Odessa A’zion is a plausible subject for this tune. Last November, Billie posted and then deleted a video of her and Odessa making out. Plus, they were spotted kissing and dancing together at this year’s Coachella. They kinda just give couple energy, and fans have picked up on that. That all being said, “Lunch” could’ve also been inspired by a totally random hookup. Hey, Billie’s been sharing a lot recently — maybe she’ll tell us herself one day.\n\nWho Is Claire, The Girl Mentioned In “Lunch”?\n\nThe pop star does mention a specific name in “Lunch.” Billie sings in the chorus: “Call me when you’re there / Said, ‘I brought you something rare’ / And I left it under Claire / So now she’s coming up the stairs / So I’m pulling up a chair / And I’m putting up my hair.” Spicyyyy. Fans are conflicted on this question. One TikToker emphasized the context and argued that Claire is a fake name Billie used. Others are convinced that Claire equals Clairo, the bedroom pop singer who happens to be pals with Billie. The great mystery of our time!"
