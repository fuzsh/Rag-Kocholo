        "text": "Story Behind the Song: 'Evergreen'\n\nBarbra Streisand wanted Paul Williams to write one song for her 1976 film \"A Star Is Born.\" He showed up to their first meeting with a whole script full of notes and plans to write multiple songs for the entire movie. It wasn't exactly a pleasant surprise for Streisand, but Williams stood his ground, and soon they were collaborating on a new tune called \"Evergreen.\" Williams recalled writing the song with Streisand during a recent conversation with Bart Herbison of Nashville Songwriters Association International.\n\nYou wrote one of Barbra Streisand's landmark songs. You won a Grammy for it, and every other award — \"Evergreen.\"\n\nShe played the melody for me. She was just learning to play guitar. First of all, I was actually approached by her to write one song for the end of the picture, \"A Star is Born.\" Kenny Ascher and I had written a song called \"You and Me Against the World.\" She said, \"That's the kind of song that should be at the end of this movie.\" Now, that's what she said to me on the phone, but I was in \"My god, it's Barbra Streisand\"-ville, so what I heard was \"I want you to write all of the songs for \"A Star Is Born.\" So I showed up with a script, and it had all of these notes all of the way through it. \"This song will be about that, and this about that ... .\" She and (producer) Jon Peters looked at me like, \"He's nuts.\" They said, \"Would you let us have a moment alone?\" So I went in the other room and ate some peanuts or whatever they had in the lobby, and came back. They said, \"You're not intimidated?\" I said, \"No. This is what I do.\" She says, \"Well, we didn't ask you to do any of the things (you did.) All I wanted was one song. But we have seven weeks until we start shooting. Come aboard and work with us.\" So I worked on the songs.\n\nThe first thing she did, she said, \"Can you use this?\" She picked up a guitar and (played the melody). I said, \"Oh my God, it's beautiful.\" She was like a little kid. It's a side of her I'd never seen before. It's funny, I think I've told this story maybe once or twice. She was like, \"You really like it?\" I said, \"Like it? It's our love theme.\" I wrote words to it. The only thing that the finished song had that was different from the way it is now is the first two lines were switched. I wrote \"Love, fresh as the morning air/ Love, soft as an easy chair.\" That \"easy\" doesn't sing good. (If you switch the lines), it works better. I called her up, and said, \"How's that?\" She said, \"Fine.\" Click. I thought, \"You do go on, don't you?\"\n\nTell me about when you heard her version for the first time.\n\nI think I really heard everything when I saw the film. As soon as I turned in the songs, I went on tour with Olivia Newton-John. We actually ran into them while they were filming it in Arizona, which was interesting. You're passing through on a tour, and as you go by, they're making a movie with your songs in it. To hear her sing anything, to hear her sing the phone book, there is an instrument there that — I mean, she sounds like Barbra Streisand. She wakes up that way. The first time I heard that I thought, \"Maybe we've got a shot with that.\"\n\nTo be rigorously honest, the song that I thought was going to come out of the picture was a song called \"With One More Look at You,\" which I wrote with Kenny. She sings it in one take at the end of the picture, which I think is one of her most brilliant performances. But she sang \"Evergreen,\" and she's put it on a bunch of albums. She just did it with Babyface on an album that was the No. 1 album in America (last year).\n\n— Compiled by Dave Paulson, dnpaulson@tennessean.com\n\nAbout the series"
