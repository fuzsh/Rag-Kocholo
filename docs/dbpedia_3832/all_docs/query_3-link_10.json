Modifications since the previous version ============================================ Version 2.1: This document was seriously out of date, in fact I'd almost forgotten it existed, and contained references to the old mailing list address, from where it had to move when the maintainer, Mike Oliver, changed jobs. Versions 2.0x were never posted. It's now survived my move to an ISP, here's to hoping this will get updated more frequently now... Version 2.02: I've tried to make it clear where my source is something that Francis or Rick has said in interview, and to remove any bias there might have been towards the 'new' band, as opposed to the 'classic' line-up. This is after I got an email from someone claiming to be Alan Lancaster (I've no idea if it *really* was). I've offered him the opportunity to set the record straight if he wants to. Version 2.01 adds information that has been posted to the mailing list by various people that answer some of the questions I posed in 2.0, but didn't have the necessary information to answer. Thanks to everyone who's helped out! There are however still some unanswered questions, so if you know the answer, please let me know. I've now decided to change the format of this document, and edit it using a proper word processing program (Word, if you must know!). Given the number of changes I've made, and the relative completeness of the previous version, I've titled this one version 2.0, and changed the subject header. The previous version of this document also appears to have become the unofficial FAQ for the mailing list (commonly known as 'From The Mailers Of'). Proper details for joining and querying the mailing list have been added in section 4. If you find any glaringly obvious mistakes in this document, or areas where I've stated a point of view rather than facts, please tell me by emailing <dimmicmj@aston.ac.uk>. 2. General Information ======================== 2.a. About the current band The current band consists of Francis Rossi (lead & rhythm guitars, vocals), Rick Parfitt (rhythm guitar, vocals), Andrew Bown (keyboards, guitar), John 'Rhino' Edwards (bass and guitar) and Jeff Rich (drums). Francis and Rick are both founder members of the band, Andrew joined in 1976 after having been a session and live musician for a number of years, and Rhino and Jeff joined in 1986 after having worked on Rick's solo album. The band plays a sort of 'rock blues' style of music, which has influenced a lot of other bands, though they tend not to acknowledge the influence. 2.b. Band history ================= The band was formed originally in 1962 by Francis Rossi and Alan Lancaster, at their school in south-east London. They soon joined up with a drummer, John Coghlan (please tell me I've spelt that right!). They rapidly went through a number of name changes, being first the Scorpions, then the Spectres. As the Spectres, they were booked to do a holiday season in 1965 at Butlins holiday camp in Minehead, Somerset, where they met Rick Parfitt who was working with a cabaret act there. In late '66, the Spectres were signed to the Piccadilly label, shortly before it was taken over by PYE. After several flopped single releases (available on the compilation, B Sides and Rarities, and now on 'The Singles Collection 1966-73,' on the Castle Communications label, C/N CCS CD 821) they changed their name to Traffic, and then, after Steve Winwood's Traffic had a hit single, to Traffic Jam. They released another single, which was banned, and decided that they needed another voice in the band. They invited Rick Parfitt to join. Shortly afterwards, in 1968 they changed their name to The Status Quo and released a song that hit the UK charts at number seven: 'Pictures of Matchstick Men' (which was recently covered by Ozzy Ozbourne for the film 'Private Parts'). Their debut LP, 'Picturesque Matchstickable Messages from The Status Quo' was released later that year, and provided another hit, 'Ice in the Sun,' as well as a number of other singles that flopped. Their second LP, 'Spare Parts' was released the following year, under the name of 'Status Quo', but it and the single from it, 'Are You Growing Tired Of My Love,' failed to go anywhere. The band decided on a change of direction and image. Out went the Carnaby Street frilly shirts, and in came the long hair, jeans, and heavy music, along with their heads down style. In 1970, now down to a four-man line up, after the original keyboard player, Roy Lynes, had left, they released their third album, 'Ma Kelly's Greasy Spoon,' and the single 'Down The Dustpipe.' Dismissed on Radio 1 by Tony Blackburn, it nevertheless got to number 12. However, attitudes were beginning to change, and John Peel played 'In My Chair' later that year, which also hit. '71's single, 'Tune To The Music' flopped, however, and later in '71, they released what was to be their final album on Pye, 'Dog of Two Head.' In early '72, Quo left Pye and signed to Phonogram's rock subsidiary, Vertigo. They took the daring step of producing their next album, 'Piledriver,' themselves, and it turned out as rough and ready as the title suggested. The single from that album, 'Paper Plane,' hit number 8 in the UK chart. That single began a chain of hits that was almost unbroken until 1985. In January 1975, 'Down Down' became Quo's first UK number one. Depending on which chart you look at, it is still their only one to date. If I remember correctly, Anniversary Waltz was number one in the Independent chart, but only got to number two in the BBC chart which most people consider 'official'. Andrew Bown, a former member of the Herd, joined the band in October 1976. The band remained in the same line-up until 1981, when John Coghlan left after an argument in a recording studio in Montreux, Switzerland. Quo were recording the album that was to become '1+9+8+2,' the title implying both the year it was released and that it was the band's 20th anniversary. He was replaced by Pete Kircher, who had been the drummer with the Original Mirrors. Later in 1982, Quo were asked to kick off the Prince's Trust launch gig at the NEC in Birmingham. The recording of the concert was later released as the album, 'Live at the NEC'. Due to disagreements within the band, they decided in 1984 that their next tour would be their last one, and titled it, 'End of the Road.' Although they said that they would continue to record, it became the end of the road for Quo in their then current form. In 1985, both Francis and Rick recorded solo albums. Rick's, titled 'Recorded Delivery' ended up costing him money he didn't have, and was never released. Francis' ('Flying Debris') had two singles released from it, which made it into the charts and then suddenly dropped out again. A large number of the songs from both solo albums were subsequently released as B-sides to Quo singles. The band were invited by Bob Geldof to open the Live Aid concert on 13 July 1985, with the song that became the event's anthem, 'Rocking All Over The World.' The song, written by John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival, was a hit for them in 1977. The nucleus of the band was together for that day, but soon after, Alan Lancaster sued Rick and Francis for the use of the Status Quo name without him. Ultimately, Alan lost the case, and Phonogram decided it was about time for Quo to fulfil their contract obligation to produce a further three albums. Rick suggested John 'Rhino' Edwards and Jeff Rich, who had worked with him on his solo album, and together they recorded the album 'In The Army Now,' released in 1986. They released a compilation of most of their top ten hits (Mystery Song, which reached number seven in 1976, is notably missing), 'Rocking All Over The Years,' to celebrate their twenty-fifth anniversary. Yes, I know, they can't add up - after the departure of Alan Lancaster and John Coghlan, the band appear to have decided to date the foundation from 1965, when Rick and Francis met. They also held a birthday bash at Butlins in Minehead, where Rick and Francis had met twenty- five years before. A medley, the 'Anniversary Waltz' was specially recorded for the album, and reached number two in the charts. In 1991, they received two music industry awards; the Brit Award for an Outstanding Contribution to the Music Industry, and a World Music Award at a ceremony in Monte Carlo. At the Brit Awards, they caused a storm by accepting their award in tuxedoes, then going up on stage and tearing off their suits to reveal their denim stage gear underneath! Quo made it into the Guinness Book of Records later that year with the 'Rock 'Til You Drop' event. They played four venues in under twelve hours, at Sheffield, Glasgow, Birmingham NEC and Wembley Arena. The proceeds from the shows were given to Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy, the Brit School for Performing Arts, and local children's charities. The following year, Quo headlined Radio One's twenty-fifth birthday celebrations, 'Party In The Park' at Sutton Park in Birmingham. The recording of this concert was released as the album 'Live Alive Quo'. Their self-written biography, 'Just For The Record' was published by Bantam Press in 1993. In 1995, Quo celebrated their thirtieth anniversary with a complete album of cover versions, titled 'Don't Stop.' It included collaborations with the Beach Boys (Fun, Fun, Fun), Brian May from Queen (Raining In My Heart) and Maddy Prior from Steeleye Span (All Around My Hat). However, Radio One refused to play Fun Fun Fun, as with their previous eight singles. This led eventually to Quo challenging Radio One in the High Court. Since Radio 1 is a station with a government grant, and paid for by the taxpayer and licence fees, Quo reasoned, it should play the singles that the public had put in the chart. Unfortunately, they lost this action, and their chances of being played decreased. In 1997, Rick went into hospital suffering from chest pains and had to have a quadruple heart bypass operation. However, he recovered fine and played an excellent gig at Norwich Football Ground on 2 August. Later on, the record company released a new compilation album, on two CDs/cassettes, containing almost all the top twenty hits, and some songs that didn't hit at all (such as All Around My Hat), under the title 'Whatever You Want - The Very Best Of Status Quo'. This release caused much controversy on the mailing list, but the consensus now seems to be that the album is worth it (since it contains songs such as 'Down The Dustpipe,' 'In My Chair,' 'Again and Again,' and others that are less well-known). In 1998, the band were touring again, in Europe, Japan, and Australia, and recording songs for a new album slated for release in early '99. As mentioned earlier, Castle Communications (who hold the copyright to the masters from the PYE years) have now re-mastered much of the early material, including rare tracks from about the right period on each of the first four albums, and a new compilation of all the tracks from the singles (both sides) and some out-takes and alternate versions. Quo Anthology, anyone? In March 1999, Quo released their eagerly awaited new album, now titled 'Under The Influence'. Impressions of this new album are good, with everyone seeming to like at least nine out of the twelve songs. The first single 'The Way It Goes' did not do well in the UK, only reaching no. 39. The second single, 'Little White Lies,' will be released on 1 June 1999 in the UK. Quo provided some new tracks and some old ones for a TV series in Germany titled 'Benzin im Blut.' Some of the old favourites have been remixed, to a mixed reception, for this series and the accompanying soundtrack album. 2.c. What do they play? Rick and Francis' main guitars are Fender Telecasters, although Francis has been known to play a G&L Telecaster, and Rick a variety of guitars, including a Gibson SG. Francis uses slightly heavier than average strings, and Rick's are a *lot* heavier! They both use Marshall JCM900 and/or JCM600 amps and Marshall 4x12 cabinets, with Vox AC30 combo amplifiers kept behind them with a mike feed to the mixing desk. It all adds up to a great, very distinctive sound! Rhino plays a lot of basses when recording, but on stage sticks to Status basses (no relation, I'm told). Andy plays mostly Roland keyboards, and Jeff plays Premier drums. On the song 'Gerdundula,' however, Rick, Francis, Andrew and Rhino all play guitars. Full details are on the official web site, as are details of Andy's keyboards, Jeff's drums and Rhino's basses. 2.d. What do they do in their spare time? Jeff and Rhino frequently play in a band commonly known on the mailing list as the '4 Bills'. Here's what Lee Hawkins <LHAWKINS@dsl.uk.ibm.com> has to say about them: \"'4 Bills And A Ben', to give them their full title, are a band in which John Edwards and Jeff Rich frequently play. The band does not have a fixed line-up, it changes with the availability of its members. For example, the 4 Bills will continue to perform when Quo are out on tour, thus John and Jeff get replaced on bass and drums. All the musicians in the 4 Bills \"pool\" are highly rated musicians. For example, Spike Edney (ex-Queen keyboard player) sometimes plays on keyboards and guitar, and Steve Byrd (from Tina Turner's band) is a regular on lead guitar. The only 'fixed' member of the group is front man Johnny Warman, a singer songwriter from London, who is an excellent singer and energetic performer. \"As for their music, it's largely 60s/70s rock 'n' roll and a bit of soulish stuff thrown in. Covers from people like The Rolling Stones, The Who, Animals, that kind of era. Don't expect any Quo covers though, that's not the point. Typically, they play 90 minutes to two hours and their show is very energetic. Venues tend to be small, their 'second home' is the famous Half Moon in Putney, a renowned London music pub but they also play benefit gigs at schools and clubs, usually in the London area.\" You can find out more about where they're playing by emailing Lee; he tends to follow their movements. Alex Gitlin added: \"Now, as a side fact, Steve Byrd was the guitarist in the very first incarnation of GILLAN - the band formed in 1979, out of the shambles of Ian Gillan Band (which, in turn, was Deep Purple vocalist Ian Gillan's 70s jazz-rock outfit). He was soon replaced by Bernie Torme - in time for the recording of \"Glory Road\" (1980) which is, apparently, where the Quo connection ends.\" A bit irrelevant, but I thought I'd put it in anyway. 2.e. Who writes all the songs? Both Rick and Francis are prolific song-writers, having written hundreds of songs for various Quo albums. In particular, one person with whom a lot of their songs were written was Bob Young, their tour manager for a number of years. He also played harmonica / blues harp for Quo over the same period. He left in the early eighties, but is rumoured to be working on the new album. Of course, that doesn't mean no-one else writes songs: before he left in 1984/5, Alan Lancaster also wrote a large number of songs, including 'Ol' Rag Blues,' a hit in September 1983. He often co-wrote songs with Rick and Francis. A lot of the fans' favourites, such as 'Backwater,' were written by Rick and Alan. Finally, occasionally all the members of the band write songs together, such as 'Break the Rules' and 'Roll Over Lay Down,' which were both written by Francis, Rick, Alan, John Coghlan and Bob Young. However, Quo are also well known for their covers. Possibly the song that is most associated with them is 'Rocking All Over The World,' which was written by John Fogerty. 2.f. The fan club It's at the following address: From The Makers Of PO Box 153 Stanmore Middlesex HA7 2HF UNITED KINGDOM Joining information is also on the official web page. 2.g. What's happening in 1999? More touring, hopefully more recording, more information as I get it. 3. Frequently Asked Questions =============================== 3.a. What chart positions did the singles get to? Nigel Sutton compiled the following list of UK chart positions (which have had Kevin Miles' corrections added)! It is based around the track listings for 'Whatever You Want -- The Best Of Status Quo.' Singles labelled 'non' either didn't get into the charts or don't really count. I believe the chart positions given are those from the BBC/Gallup poll, which is usually recognised as the 'official' chart. Disc One: 1. Pictures Of Matchstick Men 7 Black Veils of Melancholy ? 2. Ice In The Sun 8 Technicolour Dreams non Make Me Stay A Little Bit Longer ? Are You Growing Tired of My Love 46 The Price Of Love non 3. Down The Dustpipe 12 4.

When You Walk In The Room 22 ? 18. Fun, Fun, Fun. 24 19. Don't Stop 36 ? 20. All Around My Hat 47 3.b. What chart positions did the albums get to? To be honest, I don't have full details. However, the ones I do know about are: Piledriver 3 ? Hello! 1 Quo 2 On The Level 1 Don't Stop 3 Whatever You Want - Best Of 13 ? 3.c. Who wrote 'Gerdundula?' This song appeared first on the reverse of 'In My Chair', and then was re-recorded for the 'Dog of Two Head' album. However, although it's credited as being written by 'Manston/James,' Francis' introduction to the song on stage now seems to be that they wrote it somewhere in Germany. The classic tale that has been repeated at times is that they were given the song by two individuals after a gig somewhere in Germany. As for the title, I personally do not believe Francis' story that it was named after two German people, 'Gerd und Ulla.' However, given my track record, this one might turn out to be true. I have attempted to look it up in a German dictionary, and failed! Quo seem to have been going through a German phase at the time, since on the same album appeared the song 'Umleitung,' meaning 'diversion.' In neither case does the song actually appear to bear much resemblance to the title. And now I come to look at the sleeve notes for the singles compilation, which claims that Rossi and Young subsequently owned up to being Manston and James, though where they got the names from is a mystery. And yes, the story about 'Gerd und Ula' is true; they were two German friends of the band. The reason for the pseudonyms may have something to do with the fact that the song was published by Birchwood Music / EMI Music, rather than Valley Music, their usual publishing house. If anyone knows why the song was credited as Manston/James rather than its true authors, let me know, as I'm fascinated! 3.d. What are 'STs' in Mystery Song? Rick was asked this question by someone on the mailing list: it means 'Stocking Tops,' apparently. The song itself is actually about a prostitute, as confirmed by Francis at Reading in December 1997 (and possibly on other occasions when I wasn't there)!. The full lyrics were included on the inner bag of the original 'Blue For You' album, but are not included on the later re-releases. 3.e. What are the lyrics to 'In My Chair?' *I* don't know, what are you asking me for? <g> 3.f. What do they say at the beginning of the songs? Quo are well known for leaving snippets of speech from the recording studio at the beginning and end of recordings. Some of the more difficult ones to work out are below. I think it gives us a bit of an insight into their attitude to recording! i) Again and Again After much searching debate, one of the list members, Matthew Fearn, sent this message to Rhino, to try to get the point resolved... From: Matthew Fearn - FEAR NOUGHT! To: Rhino Subject:Mailing list query - AGAIN AND AGAIN We're currently having a raging debate on the mailing list about something so mundane that it's driving everybody up the wall. At the start of the studio version of Again And Again Rick says something like \"Sing along, sing 'bout the blues\". However, nobody can decipher exactly what Rick says. And got this response: From: Rhino To: Matthew Fearn - FEAR NOUGHT! Subject:Re: Mailing list query - AGAIN AND AGAIN On Wed, 12 Nov 1997 16:59:06 GMT+0, you wrote: >We're currently having a raging debate on the mailing list about >something so mundane that it's driving everybody up the wall. At the >start of the studio version of Again And Again Rick says something >like \"Sing along, sing 'bout the blues\". However, nobody can >decipher exactly what Rick says. Rick says \"Sing along, keep the album loose\". Laters, RHINOO! Well, that seems to clear things up! Later, Mike Ellwood reckoned that Rick also says this in the live version of Again and Again, in the Mystery Song medley. I reckon he's right. ii) Forty-five Hundred Times In the same message as above, Mike reckoned he'd decoded what they were on about at the beginning of the 'new' version of 4500 Times, from the Rock 'Til You Drop album: \"We're going to start again Timmy\" (who he)? (Actually, I reckon it's \"We're starting again Timmy\", and 'Timmy' is probably Tim Summerhayes, who engineered the album) \"I'm not going to say whose fault it is, but he's blonde and curly and not unlike one of the Marx brothers...\" (Probably a reference to Jeff -- anyone got a clue what Jeff might have done?) \"OK, rolling...\" 4. Internet Sites =================== 4.a. The mailing list The list was created a few years ago by Alex Gitlin. It is now maintained by Mike Oliver. This mail server accepts commands in the body of an email, sent to 'majordomo@rory.eng.sun.com'. For a full list of commands, send a message with a line reading 'help' in the body. To subscribe to the list, the following should suffice: From: <your email address> To: majordomo@rory.eng.sun.com Subject: <doesn't really matter> subscribe status-quo <your-email-address-here> Don't type the angle brackets! Majordomo is an automated mailing list server software; sending anything other than a valid request to this address is just likely to bounce mail back at you. 4.b. The newsgroup The newsgroup was created by myself, intended to be in addition to the mailing list, although possibly replacing it as usage picked up. Unfortunately due to lack of connectivity (though I'm working on this) and being spammed (again, I'm trying to prevent this), pick up hasn't been very good. The group's name is 'alt.music.status-quo' and should be found on your local news server. If it's not there, and other 'alt.music' groups are, please ask your administrator to add it; they can usually be contacted at 'usenet@[site name]' or 'news@[site name]'. 4.c. Web sites The official web site may be found at 'http://www.statusquo.co.uk/'. Other sites are around; there will eventually be a list of them here, but I've not had any URLs to link to. If you would like your web site to have a starring location in this FAQ, please submit one to me! 5. Using the news group and mailing list - a few pointers =========================================================== 5.a. Policy Some of this may be repeated lower down -- if so, sorry! These are Mike Oliver's ideas about the policy for the mailing list. They're quoted verbatim from a message he sent to the list on 24 November 1997. \"The list policy is pretty loose, it's really just basic netiquette. In a nutshell: \"- keep it on-topic. All messages should have some Quo content, because that's the reason people subscribe to the list in the first place. This \"rule\" gets bent fairly often. The occasional slightly-off-topic message doesn't hurt too much, but entire off-topic threads quickly get to be annoying for most people on the list. This is where the \"no me-too messages\" part comes in -- they add nothing to the discussion. \"The only non-Quo stuff that really belongs on the list is meta-discussion like this about list policy, even though at times it can get to be right up there with a visit to the dentist on the popularity scales. \"- no commercial activities; the list isn't here to subsidise anyone's business. The exchange and sale of Quo memorabilia on a casual basis is fine. \"- no binaries (including graphics, screensavers, spreadsheets, executables) because they're a waste of time and money for almost everyone. If you want to distribute a binary then put it on the Web or on an FTP site and post the URL or FTP location to the list. If you aren't able to publish on the Web or by FTP, someone on the list might be able to lend you some space for a while. \"- no huge postings, because many people have limits on the size of their mailboxes. As with binaries, use the Web or FTP. A secondary reason is that huge postings tend to be unoriginal (the content is recycled from previous messages) and there's no need to clog people's mailboxes with old news. \"- no harassment, flooding, illegal activities, or anything else that might get the list evicted from its home. The engineering support group at Pyramid lets me host the list on a machine here because they're good guys and because it doesn't cost them much in network bandwidth, machine cycles or hassle. If any of those things change then the list could be looking for a new home pronto. \"I'm not a lawyer and that's not an exhaustive list, I'm simply trying to outline the acceptable behaviour. What it boils down to is to be considerate of the other people on the list. \"My own yardstick for posting to the list is pretty much \"are at least a dozen people going to think that the time and money they spent retrieving and reading this message were well spent\". Other people seem to have rather shorter yardsticks, but if something is of interest to only one or two other people then clearly the sensible thing to do is to email it directly to them. If you want to know whether a specific message would be appropriate you can always ask myself or Alex before sending it to the entire membership.\" 5.b. What's on topic Anything concerning the band! Specifically, from the charter of the group as proposed in alt.config: - To discuss the music of UK-based rock band Status Quo; - To discuss various fan activities relating to live performances by the band. Obviously there are wide ranges of topics not covered by these two that are on-topic for the group. 5.c. What *not* to do i) Binary files \"I've got this great .WAV file...\" (or JPEG, or MP3 seems popular these days) Please don't post it to this group. Instead, put it on a web page or ftp site, and post a link to the group. The same goes for pictures, screensavers, etc, etc. It's hard to justify this one at times. The charter also lists this (from the newgroup message), but since I wrote that too, I guess that makes me the guy who decided. I don't like binaries in the wrong place! In text-only newsgroups it's a mess, and it also makes for extremely large downloads. It is accepted Usenet etiquette that binaries go in binaries groups. Some people like to enforce this idea; I'm not one of them. I just give subtle hints (or not so subtle if you've done it before.) A lot of users (certainly those who download the entire group before reading it, and read off-line) don't like this as it increases download time, and therefore costs them more money. It also costs *you* more to upload them to the group in the first place! Besides, it makes life harder for system administrators, making it tougher for them to assign a decent expiry time for groups. Don't forget, your post is stored on thousands of servers around the world, and all those bytes add up. I'm not advocating short messages (as I'm sure you can tell) but there are better places for it. ii) Unsolicited Adverts Advertising is fine so long as it's relevant to Status Quo. News about gigs, rare records for sale, and so on are all OK. Please don't be tempted to post an advert about your wonderful software downloads page; that's off-topic and will annoy some people. However, don't post your advert more than about once a week, and it's preferable if the advert is *wholly* relevant, rather than there being one relevant line. iii) Crossposting Please cross-post if you think the subject is relevant to both Quo and to some other band or current event that's happening. If you're comparing bands, please don't rubbish Quo, as we're not likely to be pleased. Obvious trolls will be ignored (well, by me at least). iv) Posting in HTML News was designed for posting in plain text; if you post in plain text, it guarantees that people will be able to read your posts. Therefore the ideal is to post in plain text, standard ASCII. Be assured that if I see anything else, you're likely to get a polite but firm email from me. The reason I'm really against HTML is that a lot of browsers have a tendency to post in 'multipart/alternative,' with the plain text first, then the same message formatted with HTML afterwards. This has a tendency to make a mess, and to triple the length of the posting. v) Any of the following These are miscellaneous offences, but ones which really annoy me! * 'Call 1-900-HOTBABES for hot action!' * 'I was abducted by aliens' * Any Multi-Level Marketing schemes, especially ones that read 'This is not MLM'. If it looks like a dog, and barks like a dog, it's a dog, even if it does wear a sign saying 'This is not a dog' <g>. * Unsolicited adverts for musical items not immediately Quo- related * Unsolicited adverts for anything else at all * Any items that are copyright (and not by you). An exception is made for Quo song lyrics and chordings that you have worked out yourself. 6. Contacting the maintainer ============================== Who, me? Please email me if you have any comments, complaints or corrections, at <dimmicmj@aston.ac.uk>. If you could mark the subject with [FAQ], that would help enormously, since I do get all the mail from the Quo and FAQ maintainers mailing lists, which adds up! 7. Acknowledgements ===================== Some information for this document was taken from Rick and Francis' book, 'Just For The Record.' (ISBN 0-593-03546-1, Bantam Press, 1993). I highly recommend this book if you can get hold of it! (Sorry, Alan, I still reckon it's a good read, however factually inaccurate you might consider it). Thanks to Lee Hawkins <LHAWKINS@dsl.uk.ibm.com> and Alex Gitlin <heep@juno.com> for the sections on the 4 Bills. Thanks also to Mike Oliver for letting me reproduce his list policy, and for his critique of the section regarding joining the mailing list. I'd also like to thank those people who've so far criticised this document: thanks for your input, I'm afraid I've forgotten who you are! -- Mike Dimmick"
