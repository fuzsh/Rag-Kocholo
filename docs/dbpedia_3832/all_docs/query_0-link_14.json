        "text": "Over the course of some 25 years and 30 albums Status Quo have become major stars in their native England. Unfortunately, in spite of occasional brushes with the American charts, the group's never managed to attract much attention in the States.\n\nThe group's roots can be traced to 1962 when school friends Mike \"Francis\" Rossi and Alan Lancaster formed a jazz combo. With the addition of drummer John Coghlan and keyboard player Jesse Jaworski the band began playing school dances and local clubs as The Spectres. Replacing Jaworski with Roy Lynes in 1965 the group signed with the small Piccadilly label. After releasing three unsuccessful singles the group changed it's name to Traffic Jam. Unfortunately, after Traffic Jam's first single (\"Almost But Not Quite\") was banned by the BBC the group was dropped from Picadilly's recording roster. Left without a contract the band found itself forced into the role of back up band for stablished acts such as Madeline Bell and Tommy Quickly. Adding to their problems, the band found themselves threatened with a lawsuit from Island Records which was concerned with the similarity between the Traffic Jam name and that of Steve Winwood's Traffic. Traffic Jam quickly became Status Quo.\n\nFollowing the addition of guitarist Richard Parfitt the band was signed to Pye Records (Chess' Cadet Concept subsidiary acquiring American distribution rights). Produced by John Schroeder, their 1968 debut \"Picturesque Matchstickable\" showcased an entertaining, if uneven collection of psychedelic pop. In one of those odd marketing moves the English and American releases differed significantly. Retitled \"Messages from the Status Quo\" for the American market, Cadet Concept opted for new cover art, as well as a different track listings - covers of The Lemon Pipers' \"Green Tambourine\" and Tommy Roe's \"Sheila\" dropped in favor of original material. Musically the set was surprisingly impressive, tracks such as \"Black Veils of Melancholy\", \"Sunny Cellophane Sky\" and \"Technicolor Dreams\" opting for a heavy psychedelic influence, while \"Ice In the Sun\" (Written with '50s rocker Marty Wilde) and a cover of The Bee Gees \"Spicks and Specks\" offered up a lighter, more commercially oriented attack. Released as a single, the instantly recognizable title track b/w \"Gentlemen Joe's Sidewalk Cafe\" provided the band with their only American top 40 hit. In spite of the hit and two brief American promotional tours, the LP failed to attract much domestic attention, Cadet Concept quickly electing to drop it's American distribution rights.\n\n\"Messages from the Status Quo\" track listing:\n\n(side 1)\n\n1.) Black Veils of Melancholy (Frances Rossi) -\n\n2.) When My Mind Is Not Live (Richard Parfitt) -\n\n3.) Ice In the Sun (Marty Wilde - R. Scott) -\n\n4.) Elizabeth Dreams (Marty Wilde - R. Scott) -\n\n5.) Gentlemen, Joe's Sidewalk Cafe (Kenny - Young) -\n\n(side 2)\n\n1.) Paradise Flat (Marty Wilde - R. Scott) -\n\n2.) Technicolor Dreams (T. King) -\n\n3.) Spicks and Specks (Barry Gibb) -\n\n4.) Sunny Cellophane Sky (Alan Lancaster)-\n\n5.) Pictures of Matchbox Men (Frances Rossi) -\n\nLike lots of other folks, I've never quite understood how American radio and the buying public didn't get caught up in the mid-1970s wave of British hard rock bands like Status Quo. Zeppelin just swallowed the full bandwidth ? These guy were too British for American tastes ? Beats me, but the fact of the matter is while these guys were massive stars in the UK, they couldn't even get arrested in the States.\n\nSelf-produced, 1975's \"On the Level\" debuted at the top of the UK charts, capturing the band at the peak of their commercial run. Commercially this was also prime Status Quo - a good thing if you were a fan, probably less impressive if you missed their head banging appeal. And that was at least some of the beauty behind Status Quo, These guys made no pretense of being sophisticated musicians trying to expand musical boundaries and expose fans to new ideas and concepts. Exemplified by the likes of 'Little Lady', 'Nightride', and ''Down Down (their biggest hit), the messages here were pretty much your standard rock and roll lexicon of booze, partying, and women (typically in one combination). Yeah, King Crimson and Yes fans were probably appalled by the band's successes, but you've got to admit these guys could recycle a Chuck Berry riff like nobody else and yes - there are times when we all want to just party and relax a bit. This is a great soundtrack to crank up after a hard day and have a couple of cold ones ... And yes, It is an album I still play on a regular basis.\n\n- Admittedly 'Little Lady' was little more than a recycled Chuck Berry tune, but few bands could turn in a track like this with as much energy and enthusiasm. Berry would have approved, even if he would have wanted songwriting royalties. Excellent boogie track and it got the album off to a roaring start. rating: *** stars\n\n- 'Most of the Time' started out as a surprisingly sensitive acoustic ballad (it sounded like Rossi was recorded live), before abruptly morphing into a squalling blues-rock number. I'm not normally a big fan of the genre and this wasn't one of the album highlights for me, but still this one was actually pretty good. rating: *** stars\n\n- Kicked along by a bouncy melody and singsong chorus that climbs in your head and won't leave 'I Saw the Light' was one of the album's more commercial tracks. It was a prime slice of Quo with a fairly uncomplicated structure (I suspect any good garage band could master it in a day or two), but cute lyrics. rating: *** stars\n\n- One of two Alan Lancaster compositions, 'Over and Done' was even more pop-oriented with some wonderful jangle rock guitars and a cool hyperactive lead guitar solo. Hard to believe this one wasn't tapped as a single. rating: **** stars\n\n- Moving back towards bar-band rock, kicked along by Lancaster's pounding bass line, 'Nightride' had a slinky rhythm that was incideously catchy. Simply another classic Quo tune that go lost as a 'B' side. rating: **** stars\n\n- Previously released as the album's lead-in single (in an edited format), 'Down Down' has always been kind of a puzzle to me. Original entitled 'Get Down' it was their biggest UK single,. The song's always struck me as an okay blues-rocker, but as least to my ears, not particularly original, or commercial. I'd label it a good arena rocker and not much more than that. Lancaster's ''Over and Done'' and 'Broken Man' both made a bigger impression on me. YouTube has a clip of the band playing the song on BBC's Top of the Pops: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNPJuJSVmNA rating: ***\n\n- Lancaster's always struck me as the band's secret weapon. Not only was he an excellent bassist; had a likeable gruff voice, and consistently wrote some of the band's strongest material - witness 'Broken Man' which gets my nod as the best performance on he album. rating: **** stars\n\n- Folks tend to overlook the fact Quo could write highly commercial pop-rock that was easily as good as anything Sweet, or the competition was pushing out there. Anyone doubting that comment only needs to check out the infectious 'What To Do'. Another one that left you wondering why it wasn't tapped as a single. rating: **** stars\n\n- The album's lone disappointment, 'Where I Am' sounded like the band was trying to morph themselves into an acoustic folk group. Dull and forgettable. rating: ** stars\n\n- Chuck Berry covers are usually pretty lame affairs - what's the point of trying to out-do the original ? Mind you their cover of 'Bye Bye Johnny' wasn't about to make you forget the original, but as an also-ran version it wasn't half bad showing they knew where their roots came from. rating: *** stars\n\n- It wasn't shown of the track listing, but the album ended with a short segment featuring a drunk audience singing along with the band (not sure what they were singing to ...). rating: * star\n\nAs mentioned above, 'Down Down' was released as a single in advance of the album, providing the band with their first UK # 1 chart entry, though the US release vanished without a trace.\n\nUK release:\n\n- 1974's 'Down Down' b/w 'Nightride' (Vertigo catalog number 6059 114)\n\nUS release:\n\n- 1975's 'Down Down' b/w 'Nightride' (Capitol catalog number 4039)\n\nCertainly one of their most consistent and enjoyable allbums, it hit the top of the UK charts, but did nothing in the States. By the way, the cover art showing the band poising in an Ames room was quite intriguing - what's an Ames room you ask ? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ames_room\n\n\"On the Level\" track listing:\n\n(side 1)\n\n1.) Little Lady (Richard Parfitt) - 3:05\n\n2.) Most of the Time (Frances Rossi - Bob Young) - 3:21\n\n3.) I Saw the Light (Frances Rossi - Bob Young) - 3:55\n\n4.) Over and Done (Alan Lancaster) - 3:55\n\n5.) Nightride (Frances Rossi - Bob Young) - 3:52\n\n(side 2)\n\n1.) Down Down (Frances Rossi - Bob Young) - 5:24\n\n2.) Broken Man (Alan Lancaster) - 4:13\n\n3.) What To Do (Frances Rossi - Bob Young) - 3:15\n\n4.) Where I Am (Richard Parfitt) - 3:10\n\n5.) Bye Bye Johnny (Chuck Berry) - 4:35\n\nSurrounded by a sea of punk aggression and new wave angst, Status Quo soldier on with the release of 1979's \"Whatever You Want\". Released by Vertigo in the UK, propelled by the title track single, the album proved a major commercial success, but the band remained unable to attract the attention of an American distributor.\n\nVertigo catalog number 6360 175\n\nFinally Riva Records signed the group to an American distribution deal but apparently concerned the English title and cover wouldn't sell in the States, the label decided to repackage the album with a different title and cover art. The track listing remained untouched, though the running order was inexplicably switched around. The result was 1980's \"Now Heart This\". Call me cynical, but somehow I missed out on how the group mug shot-styled photo and dumbsh*t title were suppose to sweep American audiences off of their collective feet. Produced by Par Williams, the album actually marked a nice return to form for the band. Far more melodic and pop oriented than some of their recent releases, virtually all of the ten compositions had commercial possibilities. The album also found the band taking a couple of unexpected chances, including the acoustic pop song Living On An Island'.\n\n- As a sunny, easy going acoustic pop song, 'Living On An Island' opened the album with a completely atypical effort. Mind you the song was quite good, in a Smokey (the band) top-40 way, but it was just so radically different from standard Status Quo. Yeah, it took a little time to get use to this new, sensitive style ... rating: **** stars\n\n- 'Shady Lady' was closer to the patented Status Quo sound. A short and sweet slice of mindless power pop, this one had definite commercial appeal. rating: **** stars\n\n- One of two Alan Lancaster contributions, 'Who Asked You' was easily the album's stand out performance. A classic pop song with fantastic melody and an instantly catchy title track hook, it's hard to understand why this one wasn't a top-40 hit. rating: ***** stars\n\n- 'Your Smiling Face' was a decent slice of boogie-rock. You've heard similar stuff dozens of times before, but these guys played it with more energy than you'd expect and there was a nice guitar solo midway through. It's one of those songs that got better the more beer you drank. Yes, I've actually danced to this one. rating: *** stars\n\n- 'Whatever You Want' was a big British hit for the band which in turn attracted the attention of Riva Records and led to the release of the modified parent LP in the US. To my ears this was classic Status Quo and I can actually remember hearing this one while living in Belgium in the early 1980s. Lyrically it didn't have much to offer, but the song was quite catchy and the group's harmony vocals were very nice. rating: **** stars\n\n- While listed as separate tracks, 'Come Rock with Me' and 'Rockin' On' were really a continuous medley. Curiously the track listing seemed to get them listed backwards. Musically and lyrically (pretty much just 'rockin' on' sung over and over), this was another one that sounded better as your alcohol consumption increased. rating: *** stars\n\n- 'Runaway' was one of the more pop-oriented selections, but I didn't like it one bit. Not an original thought in the whole thing and the goofy synthesizers at the end were terrible. rating: ** stars\n\n- Co-written by Lancaster, 'High Flyer' was another mindless boogie-rocker with a set of woe-is-my-life-on-the-road lyrics. Kind of hard to shed any tears for their lifestyle choices. rating: ** stars\n\n- 'Breaking Away' was probably my favorite song on the album. In addition to showcasing the band's talented guitar pool, the song started out with a nice chugging rhythm that effortlessly switched over to a bluesy segment. rating: **** stars\n\nIn the UK the album was tapped for a pair of singles:\n\n- 1979's 'Whatever You Want' b/w 'Hard Ride' (Vertigo catalog number 6059 242)\n\n- 1979's 'Living On An Island' b/w 'Runaway' (Vertigo catalog number 6059 248)\n\nNow Hear This\" track listing:\n\n(side 1)\n\n1.) Living On An Island ( Richard Parfitt - Robert Young) - 4:50\n\n2.) Shady Lady (Francis Rossi - Robert Young) - 3:00\n\n3.) Who Asked You (Alan Lancaster) - 3:57\n\n4.) Your Smiling Face ( Richard Parfitt - Robert Young) - 4:22\n\n5.) Whatever You Want ( Richard Parfitt - Robert Young) - 4:03\n\n(side 2)\n\n1.) Come Rock with Me (Francis Rossi - Robert Young) - 3:17\n\n2.) Rockin' On (Francis Rossi - Robert Young) - 3:24\n\n3.) Runaway (Francis Rossi - Robert Young) - 4:28\n\n4.) High Flyer (Alan Lancaster - Robert Young) - 3:50\n\n5.) Breaking Away ( Richard Parfitt - Robert Young) - 6:40"
