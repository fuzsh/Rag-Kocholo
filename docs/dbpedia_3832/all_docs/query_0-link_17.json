        "text": "How do you know that? Just because I look in better shape...I don't know. I fail to understand it myself sometimes because I do feel pretty fit really for my age and I don't know how I manage to keep a fair complexion, and I've got all my hair. It must be the good old Parfitt genes I guess. But thank you very much for the compliment. Much appreciated at my age. At 48...haha. Do I miss the party lifestyle? Not at all. In fact I went to a party at a club a week ago because it was my son's 40th birthday and after an hour, I decided that I had to go because the music was too loud and I wanted to go to bed and that was at 9.15pm. How times have changed. I couldn't bloody wait to get home to bed.\n\nRick: We've known Queen since the 70s and always loved them. Freddie was a lovely man...person we should say. I've always loved playing them. One of the best bands we've shared a bill with was Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band. They were like us on stage, the entire band was into it and working, which I'd always seen as Quo's forte. ZZ Top were good, a little strange though. They had a lot of trouble following us, because we'd gone out and done this whole hard-hitting set and then they came out and were so laid back, which is their thing, but it took over an hour to get the audience in it, but after that it was great. They were very strange people...maybe they didn't like us because I called the bass player a wally. Rod Stewart. Nice bloke. Really down to earth. One of us. One of the lads.\n\nFrancis: Who are Royal Blood? The last thing I heard that people liked were some American band that I can't remember the name of...Fall Out Boy...I thought they were tremendous. And Haim. But generally unless a band has been around for 5 years and has a profile, I don't know them. But I do like Haim. One of our sons was at Reading the year before and so I watched them on telly and I think they're great. My musical taste is extremely broad. I also find Taylor Swift great. She's marvellous. I like women, yep. Johnny Rotten? Yes we did know that. Somebody told us that they'd heard an interview with him and he was talking about us. We kind of bypassed one another in the 80s. We were everything the punks were against. It's funny how age does that...because they weren't that far removed the punk thing and us. We do admire John Lydon, we've got a lot of respect for him these days. He's one of the few people who says what he feels. He doesn't care who he's talking to. He just says it how it is. Like Russell Brand talking to Jeremy Paxman. I saw a whole different side to him. His attitude towards Paxman, who is well known for putting people down and steering the interview where he wants to go, was great. He was completely out-punched by Russell Brand. Before that I'd just seen this scruffy bloke on stage trying to be funny. He was just one of those people we'd never found funny. We don't think he would be a leader, but he would be a damn fine advisor to politicians. We don't vote either. It doesn't make any different whatsoever. We just wouldn't know who to vote. All politicians lie, and we can't stand politicians. Politicians and golfers...don't like them.\n\nNo. When we were down there, various people like Tina Turner had been there. We did not play to a segregated audience and we had a mixed race crew. We weren't informed that it was supposed to be a segregated audience, otherwise we never would have gone. It was a ploy designed by a certain person working within our organisation to bury us...Who was it? We'll call them Deep Water...they took a lot of money off us. So we had to formally apologise to the UN in the end and that was the end of the matter. We climbed out of the well after that. Various acts decided they would never work with us again and all of them worked with us subsequently...\n\nIt wasn't a reason. They dropped every act over 30, it wasn't just us. We went into partnership with them for a show for their 25th anniversary and we both turned the gig down when our manager mentioned it to us. And then they came back to us and said their listeners had voted for us. So we played it. And as soon as the show was over, they dropped us from the playlist. We learned that you shouldn't take on Mother. You're not gonna win. We have a very good relationship with them now."
