        "text": "Post by railroad007 on\n\nNobody will ever admit this or even consider it but how many bands since 1972 onwards don't have a guitarist who can't play Caroline, Down Down or Paper Plane. Unlike Hendrix, Clapton, Beck and Page, Rossi & Parfitts playing was doable with some application and something with strings to strum.\n\nI don't care who they are or what they say Quo inspired all of them be it Weller, Marr or Gallagher. Also there are thousands who picked up the guitar and enjoyed themselves because they were inspired by Status Quo, they didn't have to sound like them but lifelong Quo fans can spot it in other bands a mile away.\n\nAll those 60's guitar heroes copied the styles of American blues men as though on some sort religious movement. Whereas Hank Marvin, Francis Rossi and Rick Parfitt made it sound like something that anybody could have a go at.\n\nPost by MrWaistcoat on\n\nThis is a topic I tried to start a number of times on the old boards. It's one of those things that can't be answered, probably because the influence was so wide.\n\nWhen fashionable, they influenced the glam scene...while the live show influenced the ramones and the sex pistols. In the early 80's the Quo of a decade earlier was an influence on most of the new metal bands\n\nWhat I can't talk about with any knowledge is the non rock side of Quo's influence. I was surprised to read on here recently that the guy from haircut 100 opens his shows with Down Down\n\nSuspect it's an influence few acts felt it was helpful to mention!\n\nPost by mortified on\n\nWhere would we have been without Quoasis?\n\nI think Quo's influence, if there was any, has been subliminal. Perhaps more style than substance.\n\nLike you say, MrWaistcoat, Nick Heyward has been opening the Haircut 100 show with Down Down and there's an interview with him somewhere in which he talks about the tuning and how difficult he found it was to nail it. But the most unlikely of acts you'd think would play a Quo song.\n\nI always thought Tiger Feet was right up there as being heavily Quo influenced. An obvious one I know, but given what the guitarist Rob Davis has been up to since, he's obviously a man with his finger on the pulse and Quo were flying at the time. I suspect he knew what he was doing.\n\nPost by MrWaistcoat on\n\nmortified The Sweet have always acknowledged the influence. The Sweet then influenced Motley Crue...\n\nBut yes, Oasis are one of the biggest bands in the UK to follow Quo\n\nSlightly off topic, look at this www.music-map.com/status+quo I've not heard of half of these acts!\n\nPost by railroad007 on\n\nmortified The Sweet have always acknowledged the influence.

The Shock Of The Lightning has all the ingredients. A lot of the stuff at the back of the song can only come from one source.\n\nPost by railroad007 on\n\nmortified The Sweet have always acknowledged the influence.
