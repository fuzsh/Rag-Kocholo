The Rock band Status Quo return to Brighton Centre with nostalgia on their latest tour Britain’s most underrated rated Rock band and career history spanning 60 years with Font man Francis Rossi staging a fantastic show! The band were formed in London in 1962 and was founded by Francis Rossi and Alan Lancaster. Originally called ‘The Scorpions’ and with a number of line-up changes and with the introduction of Rick Parfitt, Status Quo had over 60 UK chart hits more than any other rock band! They opened up ‘live aid’ at Wembley Stadium in 1985.

As a special guess ‘Shakin’ Stevens’ accompanied Quo on this latest tour. He had a seven piece band on stage including two female backing singers, performing some of the well-known hits including ‘Green door’ ‘This Ole House’ and finished with the spirit of ‘Merry Christmas Everyone’

Status Quo took to the stage sporting their trademark waistcoats and Jeans and launched straight in ‘Caroline’! In Fitting with the Brighton Centre surroundings and an all seated event, the fans were not as wild as of the band’s heyday, full on Rock show but Rossi’s energy never fails to slow throughout the show when preforming hit after hit. The bands newest member Riche Malone fits in nicely with the elders ‘John ‘Rhino’ Edwards’ and ‘Andrew Brown’ with some fine guitar paying, gets the audience off their seats and dancing and singing along to the likes of ‘Down Down’ and ‘Rockin’ All Over the World’ for an memorable evening of classic Rock.
