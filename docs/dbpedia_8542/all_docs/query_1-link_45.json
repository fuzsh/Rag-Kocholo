        "text": "Reg Presley, (#296), Chris Britton, (#293), Pete Stapleton, (#294), Ronnie Bond, (#295). I recall that at the Town Hall gig, that every number the group played started with a Wild Thing-style guitar twang, which achieved its goal of teasing the audience and setting the girls off screaming.\n\nHaving started out as a Big L climber on April 24th, Wild Thing went on to become a huge national and international hit. The song performed even better in the USA than the UK, where it hit #1 in September of '66.\n\nFor trivia-enthusiasts, the flute-like solo on Wild Thing is played on an instrument called an ocarina.\n\nFrom Andover, Hampshire, the group formed as The Troglodytes in 1964. The Kinks' manager Larry Page signed them up, shortening the name to The Troggs. Vocalist Reg Ball also underwent a name-change. His choice of Presley, a decidedly more commercially-dynamic surname for a singer, also served to bring good publicity for the band.\n\nTroggs autographs from June '66\n\nAt the time of joining the Knees Club, the contact address for the group was given as c/o the Sorrows' Fan Club, but the Troggs' connection with the Sorrows was not explained.\n\nReg Presley received a massive influx of royalties from the Nineties revival of his 1967 Iver Novello award-winning song, Love Is All Around, by Wet Wet Wet, which became a mega-hit after being played over the end credits of major British film success, Four Weddings and A Funeral. Until the end of 2011, the Troggs still toured throughout Europe, fronted by Reg, with Chris Britton on lead guitar. Newer additions were bassist, Pete Lucas, and Dave Maggs on drums. Having become something of a cult band, their appearances continued to attract thousands of fans, many born long after the Sixties. Sadly, in December 2011, Reg was taken ill during a German gig and was found to be suffering from lung cancer. He retired from the band and commenced chemotherapy, but sadly succumbed to his illness in February 2013.\n\nFull information on the Troggs can be found on their official website\n\nReg Presley won three 1994 Ivor Novello Music Awards, for Love Is All Around, as International Hit of The Year, Best Selling Song and Most Performed Work. The Knees Club is proud to have signed up Reg at High Wycombe Town Hall as Member 296.\n\n10\n\n3\n\nSorrow Merseys Fontana TF 694\n\nAfter the guitarist and drummer left the successful Merseybeats to carve new careers, the two remaining members, Tony Crane (#195) and Billy Kinsley (#196), formed breakaway duo, The Merseys. They had been a mere 19 days away from entering the nationals with their only national (as opposed to Radio London) hit, Sorrow, when they joined the Knees Club on April 9th. The duo returned to the Fab Forty in July, with So Sad About Us.\n\nAlso signing-up for the KC, were the Merseys' backing group. The Fruit Eating Bears (\"Honestly!\" as one bemused reviewer of the time remarked upon seeing the name), were Kenny Goodlass (#197), Ken Mundye (#198), Kris Findlay (#199), George Cassidy (#200) and Joey Molland (#201).\n\nSorrow proved a successful choice for Knees Club recording stars. The Merseys made #3 in the Fab and #4 in the Nationals with it, while Bowie's recording reached one place higher in 1973.\n\nIn 2001, Tony Crane and Billy Kinsley continued to tour with the then current version of the Merseybeats as they celebrated 40 years in the music business.\n\nPhoto of the Merseys with the Fruit Eating Bears from the official Merseybeats website.\n\nIn 2010, we heard from a Fruit Eating Bear! \"My name is Kenny Mundye and I am number #198 Knees Club member, signed in at the Marquee 9th April 1966 (sigh, all those wonderful years ago). I was the drummer with the Merseys.\" Ken who now lives in Edenbridge in Kent, (website) runs percussion workshops and is resident drum teacher at Hextable Performing Arts College and Northfleet Technical College. He has kindly contributed a poem of 1962 memories.\n\nThe day broke, I awoke, the dawn chorus, the aroma of the Kardoma, memories of Whitechapel, the 55 bus.\n\nA bacon buttie, game of footie, shoes with side laces, dashing home for People and Places,The Beatles' first tele appearance (much to the annoyance of my parents).\n\nLeather jackets, strange harmonies... a cellar full of memories.\n\nWhat happened to Come Dancing... Oh please love me do...\n\nMe dad lit his pipe, Three Nuns was his delight... I can hear him say Pete Best was OK... me dad knew them all.\n\nThe Undertakers, King Size Taylor, The Remo Four... he once won a tenner on Spot the Ball, went down the pub, a brown mixed or two... it was a good year was '62."
