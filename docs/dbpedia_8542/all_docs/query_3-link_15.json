Price £2.50.\n\nI think the time has come to pay tribute to Merseybeat, the musical movement that exploded in Liverpool and on Merseyside during the early sixties, involving as many as 5.000 young people who gave life to more than 600 bands. The Merseybeat scene occupies a position of great significance in the history of rock music (and not just on a European scale), in terms of both musical content and technical innovation.\n\nThe Beatles were part of this scene, and it is probably fair to say that they were more talented, but also luckier, than their rivals. Some of the bands became famous because their records, perhaps just for a brief period, scaled the heights of the charts. But many others remained in total obscurity, although they still occupy a place in the hearts of the fans who followed their every appearance in the clubs of Liverpool and Hamburg.\n\nHowever, they are all equally important. Many of the musicians are no longer with us, while others have faded into oblivion. Some of the bands have reformed and, in spite of the advancing years of their members, continue to perform on stages throughout the world. Others are invited to appear at Veterans' Conventions and gatherings.\n\nOn these pages, I have attempted to draw up a brief list of the most important artists. But the recognition and homage is extended to all those groups - reliable sources place the official total at 418 - and also to the many thousands of musicians who helped make rock music great.\n\nINTERVIEW WITH BRIAN GRIFFITHS OF \"THE BIG THREE\"\n\nINTERVIEW WITH CHRIS HUSTON OF \"THE UNDERTAKERS\"\n\nGerry & The Pacemakers The Merseybeats\n\nThe Mojos Rory & The Hurricanes The Swinging Bluegenes Kingsize Taylor & The Dominoes The Searchers The Undertakers The Big Three\n\nMERSEYLINKS\n\nFerry 'Cross The Mersey\n\nMany great site to Gerry & the Pacemakers here!\n\nThe Hollies\n\nHome for the Hollies Days\n\nRory Storm\n\nA brief history page of\n\nRory Storm & the Hurricanes\n\nThe (Liverpool) Roadrunners\n\nThe Official Roadrunners Site\n\nThe Hollies\n\nThe Official Hollies Home Page\n\nPete Best Portafolio\n\nA brief biographic page of Pete\n\nThe Pete Best Band Live\n\nA entier live concert\n\nFreddie and the Dreamers\n\nFan Page\n\nHerman's Hermits\n\nFan Page\n\nThe Merseybeats\n\nOfficial Webpages!\n\nThe Swinging Blue Jeans\n\nOfficial Webpages!\n\nStar Club\n\nThe Star Club Homepage\n\nStar Club\n\nThe Official Homepage of famous Star Club in Hamburg\n\nMersey Cats, Elvis musicians & Epi aid Liverpool orphans\n\nThe Mersey Cats are an organization of former Mersey Beat musicians popular in the in 1960's British pop scene.\n\nTheynow sponsor numerous charity events in the UK\n\nK&K music photo archive\n\nAre you interested in photos of The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, the famous Star Club, and many more..?
