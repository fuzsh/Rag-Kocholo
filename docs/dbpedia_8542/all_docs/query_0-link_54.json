        "text": "​\n\nCondolences to all that knew and worked with Ian \"Fergie\" Ferguson, who passed away this week. Fergie was a member of Badfinger's Road crew 1970 - 1974.\n\nCheck the credits and Thank you on Badfinger's albums you would see his name mentioned, along with Nick & Tag. In the 80's he was working with Yngwie Malmsteen and Ritchie Blackmore.\n\nThe Best of Badfinger has the best tracklist (in my opinion) but not the best sound. The Very Best of Badfinger has some oddball choices (album mix of “Baby Blue”, early version of “Name of the Game”). Timeless has all the big hits, the best sound and a good selection of tracks. I’d start with Timeless then expand to No Dice and Straight Up if you like what you hear.\n\nI've been really annoyed with a local radio station. They keep playing Tom Evans remakes of Come and Get It and No Matter What as the originals. I have emailed them with no response.\n\nI guess I have to take them a Best Of Badfinger to show them that Tom did not sing lead on No Matter What. Very sad.\n\nTom, Joey w/ (Tony Kaye & Peter Clarke) in 1978 re-recorded \"Come And Get It, I'm pretty certain they did not re-record No Matter What.\n\n[Peter Clarke, Tom, Joey & Tony Kaye]​\n\nyes...totally!! Been YouTubeing Badfinger for about the past year. I'm looking for one particular video where the bassist (Tom Evans) does his best to out-voice Ham--standing back from the mic and letting it rip. I understand the band spent a lot of time feuding, either within the band or outside the band. Sad story--2 suicides...it's all about the money. (Thanks for the idea--going to YOuTube now!)\n\nThis isn't the video I'm looking for but it gives one an idea of the upmanship on display. Evans standing back from mic. Guitar player (can't think of name right now) is caught smiling his approval.\n\nLove this live vocal version of Pete's song by band w/ Rob Stawinski sitting in on drums from Kenny Rogers's program, thanks for sharing!\n\nWhat you are hearing are a set recorded in Nashville with Nashville players featuring Joey Molland on vocals. Its terrible but as someone else said, I will give Joey a pass for taking the money. The version of Sweet Tuesday Morning there is kind of nice and I'm pretty sure Joey is on the acoustic. If you see an el cheapo CD of Badfinger its probably these ten tracks.\n\nGreat band. Straight Up is definitely brilliant. And such a sad story ultimately. I’ve always thought\n\nthat their Beatles connection might’ve hurt them as much as helped them. Sure, they got a big launch\n\nwith their endorsement. But rubbing elbows with the Beatles does create tremendous expectations.\n\nAnd sounding a little similar sets them up to live up to a lot! I love the band, but to have such successful\n\nfriends could create a little bit of an illusion. And later spottier releases are scrutinized perhaps a bit to harshly?"
