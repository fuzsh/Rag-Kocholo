        "text": "Readers will be familiar with the American early 1970s rock band Jo Jo Gunne, helmed by former Spirit members Jay Ferguson and Mark Andes.\n\nHowever, the first band to use the name Jo Jo Gunne was in fact a little known British R&B outfit, formed at Debrome school in Feltham, Middlesex in early-to-mid 1965.\n\nThe original line up comprised:\n\nRonny Butterworth – lead vocals\n\nSimon Spackman – lead guitar\n\nDon Bax – rhythm guitar\n\nAlan Townsend – bass\n\nDoug Gordon – drums\n\nHowever, later that year the musicians made the decision to move in a more soul direction and took on a new lead singer, Pete Pennycate, to accommodate the new configuration.\n\nSpackman moved from lead guitar to keyboards to allow newcomer Renwick MacDonald to join from local rivals Themselves. Butterworth and Townsend focused on trumpets and Bax took up the bass.\n\nBy early 1966, Jo Jo Gunne comprised:\n\nPete Pennycate – lead vocals\n\nRenwick MacDonald – lead guitar\n\nSimon Spackman – organ\n\nDon Bax – bass\n\nAlan Townsend – trumpet and trombone\n\nRonny Butterworth – trumpet\n\nDoug Gordon – drums\n\nDuring June 1966, the band won Melody Maker’s National Beat Competition, which was held at Brighton’s Regent Ballroom. Also, during August, they took part in the London Palladium competition.\n\nOver the next 18 months, this line up (minus Butterworth who dropped out around November 1966 to play with Twickenham band, The All Night Workers) played the following gigs:\n\n5 October 1965 – Nurses Club, Jolly Gardeners, Isleworth, west London with The Road Agents\n\n25 February 1966 – Cavern Club, Burnley, Lancashire with The Fruitdrops May not be the same band\n\n19 March 1966 – London Cavern, Holland Park, west London with supporting group\n\n25 March 1966 – Cellar Club, Kingston upon Thames, southwest London\n\n2 April 1966 – Cellar Club, Kingston upon Thames, southwest London\n\n12 April 1966 – 100 Club, Oxford Street, central London with The Pretty Things\n\n17 April 1966 – Imperial Ballroom, Nelson, Lancashire with The Generation\n\n14 May 1966 – Cellar Club, Kingston upon Thames, southwest London\n\n28 May 1966 – Zeeta House, Pontiac, Putney, southwest London\n\n11 June 1966 – Cellar Club, Kingston upon Thames, southwest London\n\n18 June 1966 – Zeeta House, Pontiac, Putney, southwest London with The Roger Harris Show\n\n22 July 1966 – Bletchley Young Conservatives, Coronation Hall, Bletchley, Buckinghamshire\n\n6 August 1966 – Cellar Club, Kingston upon Thames, southwest London\n\n12 August 1966 – Cellar Club, Kingston upon Thames, southwest London\n\n13 August 1966 – Bletchley Carnival Week, Bletchley, Buckinghamshire with The Future Set\n\n17 September 1966 – Borough Assembly Hall, Aylesbury, Bucks with The Future Set\n\n10 October 1966 – Borough Assembly Hall, Aylesbury, Bucks with The Future Set and The Choozey Beggars (this needs confirmation as this may be December instead)\n\n11 November 1966 – Chesham Co-op Hall, Chesham, Bucks\n\n6 January 1967 – Tiles, Oxford Street, central London with Alvin Cash & The Crawlers (billed as Jo Jo Gunn)\n\n13 January 1967 – The Flamingo, Wardour Street, Soho, central London with Derek Savage Foundation (billed as Jo Jo Gunn)\n\n27 January 1967 – Brackley Town Hall, Brackley, Northamptonshire\n\n28 January 1967 – White Bicycle, Maple Ballroom, Northampton with The Crew (billed as Jo-Jo-Gunn)\n\n17 February 1967 – Upper Cut, Forest Gate, east London with The New Pirates and The Afex (billed as Jo-Jo Gunns)\n\n18 February 1967 – Flamingo, Wardour Street, Soho, central London with The All Night Workers\n\n22 February 1967 – St Michael’s Youth Centre, Sydenham, southeast London (billed Jo Jo Gun)\n\n24 February 1967 – Upper Cut, Forest Gate, east London with David Essex and Mood Indigo (billed as The Jo-Jo Gunns)\n\n25 February 1967 – Rub-a-Dub, Reading, Berkshire\n\n5 March 1967 – New Yorker Discotheque, Swindon, Wiltshire with The Iveys and The Inspiration\n\n10 March 1967 – The New All Star Club, 9a Artillery Passage, E1, east London\n\nAccording to an article in the Hounslow, Brentford and Chiswick Post, dated 5 May, Jo Jo Gunne split up in late April with Simon Spackman joining McDonald’s former band Themselves in early May while Pete Pennycate went solo.\n\nThe newspaper’s 16 June issue adds more information. It notes that bass player Don Bax was working with The Penny Blacks, the same band that would feature soon-to-be-joining members Alan Barratt, Paul Maher and Tom Marshall.\n\nIn late August 1967, Jo Jo Gunne reformed with Alan Barratt replacing Pete Pennycate on lead vocals.\n\nBarratt had started out singing with The Penny Blacks, which also included lead guitarist Tom Marshall; rhythm guitarist John Day; bass player Dave Arnold; and drummer Paul Maher.\n\nWhen Barratt joined Jo Jo Gunne that summer he also brought Paul Maher with him (who took over from Doug Gordon) and recent recruit Don Bax.\n\nSimon Spackman and Renwick MacDonald joined the new version (presumably both from Themselves, who soon changed name to Virgin Sleep). Original member Alan Townsend also rejoined.\n\nAccording to Alan Barratt, the new version debuted on 8 September 1967 at the California Ballroom in Dunstable, Bedfordshire.\n\nIn late 1967, Jo Jo Gunne signed a deal with Don Arden’s Starlight Agency after Amen Corner’s singer Andy Fairweather-Low recommended the band to the infamous promoter.\n\nAmen Corner and Jo Jo Gunne had shared a billing at the California Ballroom in Dunstable on 29 September 1967 alongside rival west London band, The All Night Workers.\n\nThe All Night Workers would maintain a close link with Jo Jo Gunne and several musicians would play with both bands.\n\nThe first of these was original member, trumpet player Ronny Butterworth, who re-joined Jo Jo Gunne from The All Night Workers around late September/early October 1967.\n\nThe revamped line up now comprised:\n\nAlan Barratt – lead vocals\n\nRenwick MacDonald – lead guitar\n\nSimon Spackman – organ\n\nDon Bax – bass\n\nAlan Townsend – trumpet and trombone\n\nRonny Butterworth – trumpet\n\nPaul Maher – drums\n\nHowever, around late October lead guitar player Renwick MacDonald left and another former Penny Blacks member, lead guitarist Tom Marshall joined the line up for the rest of 1967 and into spring 1968.\n\nWhen Marshall left around February/March 1968 to join The Playground (and subsequently Harmony Grass and Capability Brown), Spackman moved from organ to lead guitar and keyboard player Ken Carroll joined Jo Jo Gunne.\n\nCarroll had spent the past few months playing with a band called Deep Purple, which had been formed in late 1967, some six months before the more famous version (although there were a few other local groups across England that used the name before 1968).\n\nThe following concert dates are taken from this period:\n\n8 September 1967 – California Ballroom, Dunstable, Bedfordshire with James and Bobby Purify and The Yum Yum Band\n\n23 September 1967 – Hemel Hempstead Pavilion, Hemel Hempstead, Herts

Like That” (Decca F 12807), which was released on 12 July 1968 but failed to chart.\n\nJust after the recording, Carroll introduced a second singer in to the band, Mick Wheeler, who’d previously worked with Ronny Butterworth in The All Night Workers during 1966-1967 and then in Carroll’s short-lived Deep Purple in late 1967-early 1968. When Wheeler joined, he also doubled up on congas.\n\nThe revised line up comprised:\n\nAlan Barratt – lead vocals\n\nMick Wheeler – lead vocals, congas\n\nSimon Spackman – lead guitar\n\nKen Carroll – organ\n\nDon Bax – bass\n\nAlan Townsend – trumpet and trombone\n\nRonny Butterworth – trumpet\n\nPaul Maher – drums\n\nAround mid-July, Jo Jo Gunne were offered the opportunity to play some gigs in Saint-Tropez in France but Ronny Butterworth didn’t participate and dropped out just before the continental trip.\n\nFrom 2 August to 5 September 1968, the band (minus Butterworth who has since died) played a nightly residency at the Club St Hilaire de la Mer in Saint-Tropez before returning to the UK.\n\nOn their return Ken Carroll left the band and went on to play with Johnny Johnson & The Bandwagon. He currently works with Samtana.\n\nThe following gigs were advertised with the above line up:\n\n12 June 1968 – Samantha’s, Bournemouth, Dorset (possibly one of Wheeler’s first gigs)\n\n15 June 1968 – Clouds, Derby (billed as Jo-Jo Gunn Group)\n\n22 June 1968 – Locarno Ballroom, Swindon, Wiltshire with Hoffman’s Biscuits (billed as Jo Jo Gunn)\n\n28 June 1968 – Hatchetts Playground, Piccadilly, central London\n\n29 June 1968 – Broken Wheel, Retford, Nottinghamshire\n\n6 July 1968 – St Albans City Hall, St Albans, Hertfordshire with The Rocky\n\n12 July 1968 – Supreme Ballroom, Ramsgate, Kent (billed as Jo Jo Gunn)\n\n19 July 1968 – Soul Club, Plaza, Newbury, Berkshire with J J Bender & SOS\n\n20 July 1968 – Eastbourne Town Hall, Eastbourne, East Sussex with The Soul Stars\n\n27 July 1968 – Red Cross Hall, East Grinstead, West Sussex\n\n28 July 1968 – Beau Brummel Club, Nantwich, Cheshire with The Scorpions (billed as Jo Jo Gunn) (one of Butterworth’s final gigs)\n\n3 August 1968 – Walton Hop, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey (unlikely to have happened if they went to France)\n\n10 August 1968 – Clockwork Orange, Chester, Cheshire with Headline News (billed as Jo Jo Gunn) (unlikely to have happened if they went to France)\n\n11 August 1968 – Victorian Club, Liverpool (unlikely to have happened if they went to France)\n\n31 August 1968 – Walton Hop, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey (unlikely to have happened if they went to France)\n\n7 September 1968 – Walton Hop, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey (one of Carroll’s final gigs)\n\n12 September 1968 – El Grotto, Ilford, east London (billed as Jo Jo Gunn)\n\n13 September 1968 – El Grotto, Ilford, east London (billed as Jo Jo Gunn)\n\n18 September 1968 – Samantha’s, New Burlington Street, central London (billed as Jo Jo Gunn)\n\n20 September 1968 – Victoria Hall, Falkirk, Scotland (billed as Jo Jo Gunn)\n\n22 September 1968 – Kinema Ballroom, Dunfermline, Scotland (this needs confirmation) (billed as Jo Jo Gunn)\n\n2 October 1968 – Hatchetts Playground, Piccadilly, central London\n\n6 October 1968 – Drokiweeney, Manchester (billed as Jo Jo Gunn)\n\n12 October 1968 – St Albans City Hall, St Albans, Hertfordshire\n\n26 October 1968 – Hermitage Ballroom, Hitchin, Herts\n\nAround mid-November 1968, Simon Spackman also left (and has since died) and west London guitar hero Dave Wendels (ex-Cliff Bennett & The Rebel Rousers, Lulu’s backing band, The Luvvers, Tom Jones’s backing band, The Squires and The Krew) joined the band.\n\nThis new line up transformed the group and played dozens of successful gigs around the UK, including Mr Smiths in Manchester, Bournemouth Winter Gardens, Pantiles in Bagshot, Surrey plus London venues like Hatchetts Playground in Piccadilly, the Valbonne Club, Samantha’s, the Scotch of St James and Sibylla’s.\n\nThey also supported Three Dog Night on a Scottish tour. In Scotland they supported Geno Washington and the Ram Jam Band, as well as playing The Electric Garden (Radio 1 club) in Glasgow.\n\nThe new line up played the following:\n\n3 November 1968 – Cosmo, Carlisle, Cumbria with Pete Kelly Solution (Paul Maher says it was cancelled)\n\n5 November 1968 – Sibylla’s, central London (billed as Jo Jo Gunn)\n\n7 November 1968 – 100 Club, Oxford Street, central London with PP Arnold (billed as Jo Jo Gunn)\n\n7 November 1968 – Willesden College of Technology, Willesden, northwest London with PP Arnold (possibly one of Spackman’s final gigs)\n\n9 November 1968 – Clouds, Derby\n\n11 November 1968 – Bamboo Club, Wilmslow, Cheshire (billed as Jo-Jo Gunn)\n\n11 November 1968 – Chesham Jump Club, Co-op Hall, Chesham, Bucks\n\n16 November 1968 – Fellowship Inn, Eltham, southeast London (possibly one of Wendels’ first gigs)\n\n22 November 1968 – El Grotto, Ilford, east London\n\n23 November 1968 – Cromer Links Pavilion, Cromer, Norfolk with Kiss (billed as Jo Jo Gunn)\n\n24 November 1968 – Crystal Palace Hotel, Crystal Palace, south London\n\n25 November 1968 – Sibylla’s, central London (billed as Jo Jo Gunn)\n\n8 December 1968 – Mr Smith’s, Manchester (billed as Jo Jo Gunn)\n\n14 December 1968 – Walton Hop, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey\n\n16 December 1968 – Hatchetts Playground, Piccadilly, central London\n\n23 December 1968 – Corby Civic Centre, Corby, Northamptonshire with Size Seven and State Express (billed as Jo Jo Gunn)\n\n24 December 1968 – Walton Hop, Walton on Thames, Surrey (billed as Jo Jo Gunn)\n\n29 December 1968 – Bull’s Head, Yardley, West Midlands (billed as Jo Jo Gunn)\n\nHowever, around January 1969 longstanding member Alan Townsend departed (and has since died) and Dennis Fisher came in on trumpet from the group, Mothers Ruin.\n\nTownsend spent several months working with The All Night Workers before subsequently working with The Roy Young Band later in the year and doing a multitude of sessions.\n\nBy now, the line up comprised:\n\nAlan Barratt – lead vocals\n\nMick Wheeler – lead vocals, congas\n\nDave Wendels – lead guitar\n\nDon Bax – bass\n\nDennis Fisher – trumpet\n\nPaul Maher – drums\n\nThis configuration recorded the band’s second single – Potter and Dee’s “Beggin’ You Baby” c/w “Bad Penny” (Decca F 12906), which was released on 25 April 1969.\n\nThe band played the following dates:\n\n4 January 1969 – Clouds, Derby\n\n7 January 1969 – Whisky a Go Go, Wardour Street, Soho, London (billed as Jo Jo Gunn)\n\n11 January 1969 – Royal Lido Ballroom, Prestatyn, Wales with Strawberry Cartoon (billed as Jo Jo Gunn Soul Band)\n\n15-16 January 1969 – Hatchetts Playground, Piccadilly, central London\n\n25 January 1969 – St Albans City Hall, St Albans, Hertfordshire\n\n27-28 January 1969 – Hatchetts Playground, Piccadilly central London\n\n1 February 1969 – Blue Lagoon, Newquay, Cornwall with The Vigilantes\n\n17 February 1969 – Hatchetts Playground, Piccadilly central London\n\n18 March 1969 – Alex’s Disco, Salisbury, Wiltshire\n\n27 March 1969 – Hatchetts Playground, Piccadilly central London\n\n5 April 1969 – Le Metro, Birmingham (billed as Jo Jo Gunn Soul Show)\n\n5 April 1969 – St Albans City Hall, St Albans, Hertfordshire\n\nWhen “Beggin’ You Baby” flopped, Jo Jo Gunne split with Don Arden. According to Barratt, the singles were too poppy and did not represent the band’s live set, which was funkier/soul orientated material.\n\nAfter the band proposed an album of its own material and Decca turned the opportunity down, Jo Jo Gunne split from the label.\n\nAround Easter, Jo Jo Gunne signed with Laurie O’Leary who landed them a three-month residency in Freeport, Grand Bahamas, where they played nightly in the House of Lords club, returning in July. Wheeler has kept the outgoing flight from England, which was on the 10 April.\n\nThe following dates were advertised but were not possible as they weren’t in the UK:\n\n9 May 1969 – Rush Common House, Abingdon, Oxfordshire with Status Quo and Fire (billed as Jo Jo Gunn)\n\n24 May 1969 – Il Rondo, Leicester\n\n25 May 1969 – Railway, Wealdstone, northwest London\n\n26 May 1969 – Hatchetts Playground, Piccadilly, London\n\n5 June 1969 – Blaises, Kensington, west London (billed as Jo Jo Gunn)\n\n11 June 1969 – Revolution, central London (billed as Jo Jo Gunn)\n\n21 June 1969 – Pavilion Ballroom, Bournemouth, Dorset with Finnians Fogg\n\n3 July 1969 – Revolution, central London\n\n6 July 1969 – El Grotto, Ilford, east London\n\n10 July 1969 – Blaises, Kensington, west London\n\nOn their return in early-to-mid July, Dennis Fisher and Don Bax departed and the remaining quartet of Alan Barratt, Mick Wheeler, Paul Maher and Dave Wendels formed a short-lived version with Manchester bass player Dave Bowker (now David Booker) who’d previously worked with Ivan Meads, The Richard Kent Style, Kirk St James and Sponge among others. Booker had met the musicians in the Bahamas while playing with Sponge.\n\nThe group travelled to Cologne in July/August and played the Storyville Club but on their return, Wendels and Booker both left and played with Billy J Kramer, a week-long engagement at Batley Variety Club.\n\nWendels then joined The Roy Young Band while Booker joined O’Hara’s Playboys after auditioning unsuccessfully for Badfinger (Joey Molland got the job).\n\nThe short-lived line-up played the following dates:\n\n23 August 1969 – Marine Court, St Leonards, East Sussex with Sunshine Sky\n\n6 September 1969 – Civic Hall, Guildford, Surrey with Marshall Hammond\n\n12 September 1969 – El Grotto, Ilford, east London\n\n19 September 1969 – Winter Gardens, Penzance, Cornwall\n\nLongstanding lead singer Alan Barratt was offered a backing vocal spot with The Roy Young Band but declined. He also departed around this time and later went on to sing with The Good Old Boys with Nick Simper from the original Deep Purple.\n\nMick Wheeler and Paul Maher then put together an entirely new version of Jo Jo Gunne.\n\nMick Wheeler – lead vocals\n\nGeorge Williams – lead guitar\n\nBarney Barnes – organ\n\nBilly Ball – bass\n\nPaul Maher – drums\n\nIn early 1970, Wheeler’s former band mate from The All Night Workers, Malcolm Randall briefly took over the drum stool before Phil Chesterton came in full-time.\n\nThis new line up continued into the early 1970s and returned to Saint-Tropez for a residency. The group subsequently morphed into a later version of The Love Affair, long after its lead singer Steve Ellis had left.\n\nHuge thanks to Alan Barratt, Paul Maher, Mick Wheeler, Ken Carroll, Tom Marshall, Ronny Butterworth, David Booker and Dave Wendels for their help in piecing the story together.\n\nI’d like to thank Alan Barratt, Tom Marshall, Mick Wheeler and Paul Maher for providing photos.\n\nThanks also to Jason Barnard at Strange Brew who originally posted this article. This is a substantially revised and updated version.\n\nConcert dates were taken from a number of sources, mainly local and regional newspapers. Thanks to Alan Barratt for providing some live dates from late 1967-early 1968 from his personal diary. Most of the London dates were taken from Melody Maker.\n\nCopyright © Nick Warburton.

Like Jimmy Cliff, he’s best known for his reggae recordings but he was an exceptionally gifted soul performer and worked with some top British musicians during the mid-to-late 1960s. His backing bands included The Sound System, The Krew, Tony Knight’s Chessmen and Maximum Breed.\n\nHis first venture into soul appears to have been with two singles on the small Aladdin label (see below).\n\nReleased on 12 March 1965, Owen Gray’s “Gonna Work Out Fine” c/w “Dolly Baby”, was the first of two 45s on the label, the first produced by Denny Cordell.\n\nHis second release “Lindy Lu” was backed by a great version of “Can I Get a Witness”, which has since become a Northern Soul favourite.\n\nIn mid-to-late 1965, he moved labels and to Island Records for three singles. The first coupled “Shook, Shimmy & Shake” with “I’m Going Back” and was followed by “Paradise” c/w “Bye Bye Love”. Little is known about the background to both of these releases and the personnel on the recordings.\n\nInitially, the singer worked with The Soul Sets, including a gig at the Cue Club in early January 1966.\n\nHowever, in January/February 1966, Chris Blackwell linked Owen with west London Mod outfit, The Sound System.\n\nThe band had morphed out of The All-Nite Workers and featured guitarist Tony St Clair; bass player Ron Thomas; keyboard player Mick Fletcher; sax players Mel Wayne and Dave Mahoney; and drummer Phil Wainman, who later went on to produce The Sweet among others.\n\nTogether, they backed Owen on a lone 45, a rousing version of “You Don’t Know Like I Know” backed by “Take Me Serious”, which appears to have been penned by Ron Thomas, who later went on to work with The Heavy Metal Kids, among others.\n\nOwen Gray & The Sound System also gigged around the London club circuit in the first few months of 1966 before Blackwell linked them up with Jimmy Cliff and renamed them The New Generation. Later that year, the group became singer Gary Hamilton’s second version of The Hamilton Movement.\n\nLeft without a band, Owen joined forces with The Krew who’d just lost their two lead singers Beryl Marsden and Steve Aldo.\n\nLed by scouser and future Wings sideman Howie Casey on sax, the group also featured fellow Liverpudlian Tommy Murray on lead guitar (who was later replaced by Ted Tunnicliffe); Glaswegian Archie Legget; Yorkshireman Eddie Sparrow on drums; and Londoner Alan Reeves on keyboards.\n\nOwen Gray and The Krew moved to France in April 1966 and played several clubs in the ski resorts, notably the Bus Palladium in Courcheval, before landing a residency at exclusive Paris nightclub Le Bilboquet.\n\nWhile playing in Paris in July that year, the musicians recorded an EP for Barclay Records’ subsidiary label, Riviera, comprising popular soul covers and strong Owen Gray originals, “Everything’s Alright” and “Somebody Stole My Girl”.\n\nHowever, by the end of 1966, Owen Gray was back in London and back on the soul circuit, playing the clubs that were popular with the burgeoning Caribbean community such as Paddington’s Cue Club.\n\nBack on Island Records, he recorded one of his finest soul outings, the stupendous “Help Me” coupled with “Incense”, which were produced by Chris Blackwell and Jimmy Miller respectively.\n\nIssued in January 1967, the single should have been a massive hit but inexplicably it failed to chart and is now a much sought-after collectors’ item.\n\nA few months later, Owen was back with another London band, this time Tony Knight’s Chessmen, led by drummer Tony Brown. The singer remained with the group until about September 1967.\n\nDuring Owen’s time with The Chessmen, the musicians passing through included noted sax players Dave Coxhill and Stan Sulzmann and future John Mayall’s Bluesbreaker Keith Tillman.\n\nIn July 1967, the band travelled out to Italy to play the Piper Club in Viareggio.\n\nLittle is known about his soul projects from this point on, although he did work with singers Ruby and Youth backed by The Shell Shock Show during late 1967 and early 1968.\n\nHowever, during 1968, he started to do studio work on the Old Kent Road with producer David Hadfield.\n\nFor the recordings, he was backed by Freddy Mack’s former band, The Mack Sound, who were going by the name Maximum Breed.\n\nFuture Butts Band and Gonzalez keyboard player Roy Davies was among the musicians in this talented band.\n\nSeveral singles were issued during this period, including “Sitting in the Park” and “Dream Lover” but by now, Owen was starting to focus his efforts on the reggae audience.\n\nCopyright © Nick Warburton.

Soon after, the trio were joined by lead singer Chris Wright and drummer Phil Kenton.\n\nTaking on Jan’s father, John, as the group’s manager, the musicians began gigging at youth clubs and social clubs in the Hayes, Harrow and Wembley areas.\n\nDuring late 1963, however, the band changed name to Wainwright’s Gentlemen after the musicians discovered that there was another Unit 4 on the west London scene (future Brinsley Schwartz Ian Gomm’s group).\n\nIn early 1964, Wainwright’s Gentlemen became resident band at Hayes Beat Club in Hayes, Middlesex and also landed a residency at two coffee bars in London’s West End – Le Chat Qui Peche in Regent Street and the Cave St Germain in Poland Street.\n\nHaving entered the Mecca Dancing and Walls Ice Cream nationwide Beat Group contest, Wainwright’s Gentlemen appeared at Hammersmith Palais on 9 January 1964 in their area competition, beating several groups, including The Detours, who later became The Who.\n\nWainwright’s Gentlemen returned to the Hammersmith Palais on 6 February for the ‘Hall Final’, which the band won.\n\nUnfortunately, when the national finals were held at the Lyceum on the Strand on 4 May, the group finished fifth out of 13 bands.\n\nLater that year, Wainwright’s Gentlemen secured a recording test at Jackson Sound Studios in Rickmansworth but the session was not successful.\n\nIn mid-October, the band added Annette Culley as a second singer. She may have been the same Annette who sang with The Keymen.\n\nWright, who worked at Dawe Instruments in Acton, Middlesex, invited tenor sax player Dave Brogden from The Midnites to join the group in early November 1964 but the very night he auditioned and joined Wainwright’s Gentlemen, Wright had a falling out with Jan Frewer’s father and departed.\n\nSelected gigs:\n\n9 January 1964 – Mecca Dancing and Walls Ice Cream’s nationwide Beat Group Contest, Hammersmith Palais, Hammersmith, west London\n\n10 January 1964 – Bedsitter Club, Holland Park, west London\n\n11 January 1964 – Le Chat qui Peche, Regent Street, central London\n\n6 February 1964 – Hall Final of Mecca Dancing nationwide Beat Group Contest, Hammersmith Palais, Hammersmith, west London\n\n21 February 1964 – Bedsitter Club, Holland Park, west London\n\n28 February 1964 – Bedsitter Club, Holland Park, west London\n\n1 March 1964 – Beat contest at Watford Town Hall, Watford, Herts with others The group came third\n\n7 March 1964 – The Scene, Florida Room, Brighton, West Sussex\n\n9 March 1964 – Bedsitter Club, Holland Park, west London\n\n30 March 1964 – Hi-Fi Hop, Walton Playhouse, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey\n\n30 April 1964 – Bedsitter Club, Holland Park, west London\n\n2 May 1964 – Long’s Ballroom, Bishop Stortford, Herts with The Marauders\n\n4 May 1964 – Mecca Dancing nationwide Beat Group Contest finals, Lyceum Ballroom, Strand, central London with others\n\n23 May 1964 – Hi-Fi Hop, Walton Playhouse, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey\n\n6 June 1964 – Assembly Hall, Walthamstow, north London with Johnny Lonesome & The Travellers adn Keith Young & The Skyways\n\n9 June 1964 – Hi-Fi Hop, Walton Playhouse, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey\n\n12 June 1964 – Long’s Ballroom, Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire with Manfred Mann\n\n27 June 1964 – Hi-Fi Hop, Walton Playhouse, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey\n\n6 July 1964 – Attic Club, 1a High Street, Hounslow, Middlesex with Rory Blackwell & His Monsters\n\n25 July 1964 – Assembly Hall, Walthamstow, north London with The Four Zodiacs and The Nu-Trons\n\n31 July 1964 – Whitehall, East Grinstead, West Sussex with The Shades\n\n8 August 1964 – Bedsitter Club, Holland Park, west London\n\n13 September 1964 – Attic, Hounslow, Middlesex\n\n25 September 1964 – Attic Club, 1a High Street, Hounslow, Middlesex with Ken Gordon & The Downsiders\n\n29 September 1964 – Kodak Hall, Wealdstone, Middlesex with The Dolphins and The Beachcombers\n\n4 October 1964 – Kihoty Club, Guildford, Surrey with The Aces and The Shieks\n\n24 October 1964 – Witham Public Hall, Witham, Essex (Billed as Annette with Wainwright’s Gentlemen)\n\nIan Gillan – lead vocals\n\nAnnette Cully – lead vocals\n\nJim Searle – lead guitar\n\nAlfred Fripp – rhythm guitar\n\nDave Brogden – tenor saxophone\n\nJan Frewer – bass, vocals\n\nPhil Kenton – drums\n\nWithin days of Dave Brogden joining on tenor saxophone, Wainwright’s Gentlemen brought in Chris Wright’s replacement – Ian Gillan, lead singer with Hayes, Middlesex group, The Javelins.\n\nThe new formation remained steady until early March 1965. Brogden’s diary shows that the musicians traveled to Jackson Sound Studios in Rickmansworth on a number of dates in February (3rd, 10th, 15-16th, 19th and 28th) presumably to cut material. However, his original date sheet puts the recording dates for the three tracks that the band cut as 3rd, 8th and 15th March.\n\nWainwright’s Gentlemen recorded three tracks – “Ain’t That (Just Like Me)”, which has since surfaced on Acid Jazz’s Rare Mod 3 CD compilation; “Que Sera Sera”; and “Slow Down”.\n\nAt the start of March, Dave Brogden gave three months’ notice that he was leaving Wainwright’s Gentlemen to join west London group Jean & The Statesides. His first contribution to his new band was at EMI Abbey Road studio on 17 June. He would remain with The Statesides until 26 September when Phil Kenton got in touch to join him in an Irish show band at an Irish dance hall in Balham, south London (see later entry).\n\nAround the same time, Ian Gillan started to get itchy feet and covertly started his own band Ian & The Dragsters who gigged intermittently while he remained with Wainwright’s Gentlemen until late April. Dave Brogden played with Gillan’s band on nights when Wainwright’s Gentlemen weren’t gigging.\n\nSelected gigs:\n\n7 November 1964 – Star & Garter, Windsor, Berkshire\n\n8 November 1964 – La Dolphin Club, Baker Street, central London\n\n12 November 1964 – Wistowe House dance hall, Hayes, Middlesex\n\n14 November 1964 – Dreamland, Margate, Kent with Tony Lindell & The Cruisers\n\n15 November 1964 – Star & Garter, Windsor, Berkshire\n\n16 November 1964 – Seagull Hotel, Southall, Middlesex\n\n21 November 1964 – Assembly Hall, Walthamstow, north London with The Mad Hatters and Brian Ford & The Sapphires\n\n22 November 1964 – Star & Garter, Windsor, Berkshire\n\n25 November 1964 – USAF Ruislip, Ruislip, Middlesex\n\n26 November 1964 – Wistowe House dance hall, Hayes, Middlesex\n\n29 November 1964 – Star & Garter, Windsor, Berkshire\n\n30 November 1964 – Seagull Hotel, Southall, Middlesex\n\n1 December 1964 – Hammersmith Town Hall, Hammersmith, west London with The Grenades, The Impacts and The Fairlanes\n\n3 December 1964 – Locarno Ballroom, Streatham, southwest London\n\n6 December 1964 – Star & Garter, Windsor, Berkshire\n\n7 December 1964 – Seagull Hotel, Southall, Middlesex\n\n10 December 1964 – Wistowe House dance hall, Hayes, Middlesex\n\n12 December 1964 – Hammersmith Town Hall, Hammersmith, west London\n\n13 December 1964 – Start & Garter, Windsor, Berkshire\n\n17 December 1964 – Locarno Ballroom, Streatham, southwest London\n\n18 December 1964 – Willesden Grammar School Youth Club, Willesden, northwest London\n\n19 December 1964 – Hotel in Holborn, central London\n\n20 December 1964 – Star & Garter, Windsor, Berkshire\n\n22 December 1964 – Overseas Visitors Club, Fulham, west London\n\n23 December 1964 – Ventures Youth Club, Greenford, Middlesex\n\n24 December 1964 – Plaza Ballroom, Guildford, Surrey with The Downsiders\n\n26-27 December 1964 – Star & Garter, Windsor, Berkshire\n\n28 December 1964 – Seagull Hotel, Southall, Middlesex\n\n31 December 1964 – Whitehall, East Grinstead, West Sussex\n\n1 January 1965 – Ventures Youth Club, Greenford, Middlesex\n\n2 January 1965 – Watford Town Hall, Watford, Herts\n\n3 January 1965 – Star & Garter, Windsor, Berkshire\n\n7 January 1965 – Wistowe House dance hall, Hayes, Middlesex\n\n8 January 1965 – Ashford Golf Club, Ashford, Middlesex\n\n9 January 1965 – Unknown venue in West Wickham, Kent\n\n10 January 1965 – Star & Garter, Windsor, Berkshire\n\n11 January 1965 – Seagull Hotel, Southall, Middlesex\n\n14 January 1965 – Wistowe House dance hall, Hayes, Middlesex\n\n15 January 1965 – London School of Economics, central London\n\n16 January 1965 – Dreamland, Margate, Kent with Twinkle and The Gonks\n\n17 January 1965 – Locarno Ballroom, Leicester\n\n20 January 1965 – Ballroom in Dartford, Dartford, Kent\n\n21 January 1965 – Clay Pigeon, Eastcote, Middlesex\n\n23-24 January 1965 – Star & Garter, Windsor, Berkshire\n\n27 January 1965 – Hall in Carpenter’s Park (this could be Carpenders Park, Watford)\n\n28 January 1965 – Wistowe House dance hall, Hayes, Middlesex\n\n29 January 1965 – Hoover Social Club, Alperton, Middlesex\n\n30 January 1965 – Hi-Fi Hop, Walton Playhouse, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey\n\n31 January 1965 – Star & Garter, Windsor, Berkshire\n\n1 February 1965 – Seagull Hotel, Southall, Middlesex\n\n5 February 1965 – Ealing Club, Ealing, Middlesex with Unit 5\n\n6 February 1965 – Annunciation Club, Wembley, Middlesex\n\n7 February 1965 – Star & Garter, Windsor, Berkshire\n\n11 February 1965 – Wistowe House dance hall, Hayes, Middlesex\n\n13 February 1965 – Tottenham Town Hall, Tottenham, north London\n\n14 February 1965 – Kodak Social Club, Hemel Hempstead, Herts\n\n17 February 1965 – London School of Economics, the Strand, central London\n\n18 February 1965 – BOAC Social Club, Northolt, Middlesex\n\n20 February 1965 – Railway Hotel, Greenford, Middlesex\n\n21 February 1965 – Star & Garter, Windsor, Berkshire\n\n22 February 1965 – Seagull Hotel, Southall, Middlesex\n\n23 February 1965 – Kodak Social Club, Harrow, Middlesex\n\n25 February 1965 – Wistowe House dance hall, Hayes, Middlesex\n\n25 February 1965 – Clay Pigeon, Eastcote, Middlesex (advertised in newspaper)\n\n26 February 1965 – Kookey Nook, Windsor, Berkshire\n\n27 February 1965 – Whetstone Hotel, Finchley, north London\n\n28 February 1965 – Star & Garter, Windsor, Berkshire\n\nIan Gillan – lead vocals\n\nAnnette Cully – lead vocals\n\nJim Searle – lead guitar\n\nAlfred Fripp – rhythm guitar\n\nDennis ??? – tenor saxophone (or Dave Brogden intermittently)\n\nJan Frewer – bass, vocals\n\nPhil Kenton – drums\n\nDuring early March 1965, Wainwright Gentlemen’s employed a tenor sax player called Dennis to cover for Dave Brogden, who was unable to commit to the band fully (he was working covertly and intermittently with Gillan’s band The Dragsters). Dennis, however, only lasted around a month until late March.\n\nEven though he was leaving in mid-June to join Jean & The Statesides, Dave Brogden agreed with Jan Frewer to continue to perform with Wainwright’s Gentlemen from 1 April to 24 September whenever he was able to honour gigs (see gigs with *).\n\nAfter a gig on 26 April, lead singer Ian Gillan left Wainwright’s Gentlemen to concentrate on his own group, Ian Gillan & The Dragsters. However, soon after performing a gig on 20 May with his band, Gillan joined Episode Six and later found fame with Deep Purple.\n\nAlfred Fripp departed on the same date as Ian Gillan and joined south London band Jaymes Fenda & The Vulcans. Fripp would briefly return to Wainwright’s Gentlemen in January 1967 when Frewer was injured in a car accident and covered bass duties until Frewer recovered.\n\nSelected gigs:\n\n2 March 1965 – Kodak Hall, Wealdstone, Middlesex with The Gaylords and The Beachcombers\n\n4 March 1965 – Clay Pigeon, Eastcote, Middlesex\n\n18 March 1965 – Clay Pigeon, Eastcote, Middlesex\n\n1 April 1965 – Clay Pigeon, Eastcote, northwest London *\n\n2 April 1965 – Leonian Hall, Harrow, northwest London *\n\n3 April 1965 – Blythe Hotel, Sevenoaks, Kent *\n\n4 April 1965 – Windsor, Berkshire (most likely Star & Garter)\n\n5 April 1965 – Seagull Hotel, Southall, west London\n\n8 April 1965 – Wistowe House dance hall, Hayes, west London\n\n9 April 1965 – Café des Artistes, Fulham, southwest London\n\n10 April 1965 – Scala, Dartford, Dartford, Kent *\n\n11 April 1965 – Windsor, Berkshire (most likely Star & Garter)\n\n12 April 1965 – Co-op Hall, Wealdstone, northwest London *\n\n15 April 1965 – Clay Pigeon, Eastcote, northwest London\n\n16 April 1965 – Café des Artistes, Fulham, southwest London\n\n17 April 1965 – Cinema in Watford, Watford, Herts *\n\n18 April 1965 – Kodak Social Club, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire\n\n19 April 1965 – Dreamland Ballroom, Margate, Kent with Tony Rivers & The Castaways\n\n22 April 1965 – Wistowe House dance hall, Hayes, west London\n\n23 April 1965 – Café des Artistes, Fulham, southwest London\n\n25 April 1965 – Southall Community Centre, Southall, west London\n\n26 April 1965 – Seagull Hotel, Southall, Middlesex (Gillan and Fripp’s last gig)\n\nAnnette Cully – lead vocals\n\nJim Searle – lead guitar\n\nJan Frewer – bass, vocals\n\nPhil Kenton – drums\n\n+\n\nDave Brogden – tenor sax (intermittently)\n\nThe stripped back line-up played just over a week’s worth of gigs with Brogden helping out when he could make the commitment. However, around 10 May, Jan Frewer’s father brought in two new musicians – keyboard player Tyni Manning and new tenor sax player Robert Schole.\n\nSelected gigs:\n\n29 April 1965 – Clay Pigeon, Eastcote, northwest London\n\n30 April 1965 – Café des Artistes, Fulham, southwest London\n\n2 May 1965 – Windsor, Berkshire (most likely Star & Garter)\n\n3 May 1965 – Wimbledon Palais, Wimbledon, southwest London * (this was mentioned in a newspaper cutting, dated 19 May)\n\n6 May 1965 – Wistowe House dance hall, Hayes, west London\n\n7 May 1965 – Café des Artistes, Fulham, southwest London *\n\n8 May 1965 – Venue in Reading, Berkshire (possibly Olympia Ballroom) *\n\n9 May 1965 – Windsor, Berkshire (most likely Star & Garter)\n\nAnnette Culley – lead vocals\n\nJim Searle – lead guitar\n\nTyni Manning – keyboards\n\nJan Frewer – bass, vocals\n\nRobert Schole – tenor saxophone\n\nPhil Kenton – drums\n\nThe new line-up was short-lived and could have only lasted a month or so (possibly until 4 June) despite being promoted (and photographed) in the Harrow Weekly Post on 19 May.\n\nSelected gigs:\n\n13 May 1965 – Clay Pigeon, Eastcote, northwest London\n\n15 May 1965 – St Mary’s College (most likely in Twickenham, west London)\n\n16 May 1965 – Star & Garter, Windsor, Berkshire\n\n20 May 1965 – Wistowe House dance hall, Hayes, west London\n\n21 May 1965 – Old Lyon Hall, Harrow, northwest London (may have been Café de Artiste in Fulham, southwest London instead but was advertised in Harrow Observer & Gazette)\n\n22 May 1965 – Star & Garter, Windsor, Berkshire\n\n23 May 1965 – gig in Mudeford (Dorset?)\n\n27 May 1965 – Clay Pigeon, Eastcote, northwest London\n\n28 May 1965 – Café des Artistes, Fulham, southwest London\n\n29 May 1965 – Starlite (but was this Greenford, northwest London)\n\n30 May 1965 – Windsor, Berkshire (most likely Star & Garter)\n\n2 June 1965 – Clay Pigeon, Eastcote, northwest London with Tony Rivers & The Castaways (Melody Maker says 3 June)\n\n3 June 1965 – Wistowe House dance hall, Hayes, west London\n\n4 June 1965 – Café des Artistes, Fulham, southwest London\n\nAnnette Culley – lead vocals\n\nJim Searle – lead guitar\n\nJan Frewer – bass, vocals\n\nPhil Kenton – drums\n\n+\n\nDave Brogden – tenor saxophone (intermittently)\n\nAs agreed with Jan Frewer, Dave Brogden continued to occasionally gig with Wainwright’s Gentlemen (see below gigs with*) when he wasn’t working with The Statesides, who he officially joined on 17 June. This agreement to sit in with Wainwright’s Gentlemen lasted until late September.\n\nBrogden remembers that a few days after 26 September, Wainwright Gentlemen’s drummer Phil Kenton got in touch (possibly because there was a hiatus in Wainwright Gentlemen’s gigs) and said he’d been offered an extremely well paid gig with an Irish show band performing at an Irish dance hall in Balham. The group also needed a sax player and the residency, which guaranteed three nights a week, started on 1 October.\n\nThe sax player left The Statesides and Kenton departed Wainwright’s Gentlemen to join the Irish show band but Kenton only lasted the weekend before being replaced by an Irish drummer. Kenton briefly returned to Wainwright’s Gentlemen but was clearly getting itchy feet to move on.\n\nBrogden meanwhile lasted a few more weeks before the Irish show band stopped working and he returned to The Statesides on 29 October.\n\nSelected gigs:\n\n5 June 1965 – Assembly Hall, Walthamstow, north London with The Prophets *\n\n6 June 1965 – Windsor, Berkshire (most likely Star & Garter)\n\n10 June 1965 – Clay Pigeon, Eastcote, northwest London\n\n11 June 1965 – Café des Artistes, Fulham, southwest London *\n\n12 June 1965 – LSE, Malden (Surrey?)\n\n13 June 1965 – Windsor, Berkshire (most likely Star & Garter)\n\n15 June 1965 – gig in Dagenham, Essex\n\n17 June 1965 – Wistowe House dance hall, Hayes, west London\n\n18 June 1965 – Café des Artistes, Fulham, southwest London\n\n19 June 1965 – Star & Garter, Windsor, Berkshire *\n\n20 June 1965 – Star & Garter, Windsor, Berkshire\n\n24 June 1965 – Clay Pigeon, Eastcote, northwest London\n\n25 June 1965 – Café des Artistes, Fulham, southwest London\n\n26 June 1965 – Kodak Hall, Hemel Hempstead, Herts\n\n27 June 1965 – Windsor, Berkshire (most likely Star & Garter)\n\n3 July 1965 – Café des Artistes, Fulham, southwest London *\n\n5 July 1965 – Hermitage Ballroom, Hitchin, Herts\n\n9 July 1965 – Café des Artistes, Fulham, southwest London *\n\n24 July 1965 – Hi-Fi Hop, Weybridge Hall, Weybridge, Surrey\n\n6 August 1965 – Café des Artistes, Fulham, southwest London *\n\n13 August 1965 – Café des Artistes, Fulham, southwest London *\n\n21 August 1965 – Royal Star Ballroom, Maidstone, Kent (Kent Messenger)\n\n21 August 1965 – The Savoy Rooms, Catford, southeast London with Trendsetters Ltd\n\n28 August 1965 – Gari Ballroom, Great Yarmouth, Norfolk with John’s Court\n\n11 September 1965 – Queen of Harts (location not known) *\n\n18 September 1965 – Club de Dance, Colchester, Essex *\n\n22 September 1965 – Clay Pigeon, Eastcote, northwest London *\n\n24 September 1965 – Café des Artistes, Fulham, southwest London\n\nAnnette Cully – lead vocals\n\nVal Cockayne – lead vocals\n\nJim Searle – lead guitar\n\nPeter Cockayne – keyboards\n\nJan Frewer – bass, vocals\n\nPhil Kenton – drums\n\nAround late September, the band appeared to have stopped gigging briefly, which was when Kenton landed the gig with the Irish show band. When that didn’t work out, he returned to Wainwright’s Gentlemen who had brought in a second (female) singer Val Cockayne and her husband Peter on keyboards during the drummer’s absence.\n\nIt isn’t clear how long the Cockaynes stayed with Wainwright’s Gentlemen but possibly until November-December (and long enough to be photographed).\n\nPeter Cockayne recalls that Mick Tucker joined shortly before the couple departed Wainwright’s Gentlemen. However, it’s also plausible that Tucker just auditioned when Kenton left to work with the Irish show band and the group held on to his details as a future replacement when Kenton did finally depart sometime in late 1965.\n\nSelected gigs:\n\n9 October 1965 – Hi-Fi Hop, Weybridge Hall, Weybridge, Surrey\n\nAnnette Cully – lead vocals\n\nGordon Fairminer – lead guitar\n\nJim Searle – lead guitar\n\nTony Hall – tenor saxophone (joined slightly after Fairminer)\n\nJan Frewer – bass, vocals\n\nMick Tucker – drums\n\nLead guitarist Gordon Fairminer, who had played with Ian Gillan in The Javelins and who joined Wainwright’s Gentlemen immediately after the Cockaynes left, remembers that Mick Tucker came to see the group play at the Clay Pigeon in Eastcote on one occasion and that he replaced Kenton soon after. Tucker had started out in an instrumentals band with future Wainwright’s Gentlemen and Sweet guitarist Frank Torpey.\n\nShortly after Fairminer joined (circa November/December 1965), Wainwright’s Gentlemen also brought in tenor saxophone player Tony Hall, who had started out playing with early ‘60s west London band Peter Nelson & The Travellers. As Peter’s Faces, this group had made some recordings.\n\nFairminer and Searle began playing harmony solos on guitar, which was innovative for its time.\n\nThe new guitarist remembers that Wainwright’s Gentlemen had a regular Friday night residency at the Café des Artistes in Fulham from late 1965 through to 1967.\n\nThe new line up remained stable until around June-July 1966 when the musicians auditioned for another male singer and brought in Brian McManus (aka Connolly), who had previously sung with The Troop from Harefield, northwest London.\n\nSelected gigs:\n\n11 December 1965 – Acre Hall, Northwood, northwest London\n\n25 June 1966 – Dorothy Ballroom, Cambridge with Bob Kidman & His Band, The Paramounts, Mood Indigo and The Astrobeats\n\nAnnette Cully – lead vocals\n\nBrian McManus (aka Connolly) – lead vocals\n\nGordon Fairminer – lead guitar\n\nJim Searle – lead guitar\n\nTony Hall – tenor saxophone\n\nJan Frewer – bass, vocals\n\nMick Tucker – drums\n\nSometime around early November Annette Cully departed and the group continued with Brian Connolly as sole lead singer.\n\nSelected gigs:\n\n30 July 1966 – Borough Assembly Hall, Aylesbury, Bucks with The Reasons\n\n24 September 1966 – Victoria Ballroom, Cambridge (featuring Annette)\n\n1 October 1966 – Harrow County School for Boys, Harrow, London with The Stalkers\n\n22 October 1966 – ABC North Harrow Bowling Centre, Moonlight Bowl, Harrow, London (featuring Annette)\n\nBrian McManus (aka Connolly) – lead vocals\n\nGordon Fairminer – lead guitar\n\nJim Searle – lead guitar\n\nTony Hall – tenor saxophone\n\nJan Frewer – bass, vocals\n\nMick Tucker – drums\n\nThe remaining members – Brian Connolly, Tony Hall, Jim Searle, Gordon Fairminer, Jan Frewer and Mick Tucker – recorded two demo tracks at Regent’s Sound in late 1966/early 1967, which surfaced on an acetate – “You Look So Tame” and “One of a Kind”.\n\nOn 2 January 1967, Jan Frewer, Gordon Fairminer and Mick Tucker were involved in a car crash on the way home from a gig on the south coast, possibly in Brighton.\n\nAccording to Fairminer, Frewer was driving his Singer Chamois when the incident happened. The guitarist was in the front passenger seat and Mick Tucker was in the back seat.\n\nThe car hit a tree at around 50-60 mph on a wet Mortlake Road. The guitarist broke both legs. Frewer fractured his pelvis and Tucker had some internal bleeding. The bass player and drummer were both hospitalised for about a week.\n\nFormer Wainwright’s Gentlemen guitarist Alf Fripp covered for Frewer while he recovered.\n\nFairminer had a full length plaster on his left leg for about four to five months and half length on his right leg for about a month. While he recuperated, Jim Searle carried all the lead guitar duties.\n\nThe guitarist remembers that after the plaster was removed from his right leg, he continued to gig with Wainwright’s Gentlemen and recalls a show at the Café Des Artistes in Fulham perched high at the front of the stage, with his straight plastered leg hanging over the edge of the stage with a very large black boot. Some of the audience scribbled messages on the plaster.\n\nThe Hounslow Post reported its 14 July 1967 issue, page 10, that Julie was singing with the band. However, Fairminer has no recollection of another female singer after Cully left.\n\nSelected gigs:\n\n12 November 1966 – Sperry FC, Bracknell, Berkshire\n\n19 November 1966 – Winter Gardens, Banbury, Oxfordshire with The Cinette Sounds\n\n4 March 1967 – Harrow Boys County School, Harrow, London with The Mustangs\n\n8 April 1967 – Sperry FC, Bracknell, Berkshire with The Movement\n\n10 June 1967 – Sperry FC, Bracknell, Berkshire with The Rite Amount\n\n11 August 1967 – Les Jeux Interdits, Cambridge\n\n2 October 1967 – Harrow County Boys School, Harrow, London with Two of Each\n\n1 November 1967 – Les Jeux Interdits, Cambridge\n\n8 November 1967 – Les Jeus Interdits, Cambridge\n\nBrian McManus (aka Connolly) – lead vocals\n\nFrank Torpey – lead guitar\n\nTony Hall – tenor saxophone\n\nJan Frewer – bass, vocals\n\nMick Tucker – drums\n\nAround November 1967, former Tribe lead guitarist Frank Torpey came in for Gordon Fairminer. Jim Searle also departed at this point (if not earlier) and later became a classical guitarist.\n\nHowever, Torpey (who’d started out in a band with Mick Tucker in 1962) only lasted a handful of months and by late January 1968, Frewer’s friend Robin Box had succeeded him on lead guitar. According to an article in the Harrow Observer, dated 24 October 1969, Box had previously played with The Phantoms and Five’s Company.\n\nTorpey notes in his diary that his final gig took place on 20 January at a hospital but he doesn’t have any more details. The gigs below are from his diary (where he has firm details).\n\nSelected gigs:\n\n17 November 1967 – Bedford College, Regent’s Park, central London\n\n18 November 1967 – London University, London\n\n25 November 1967 – Gillingham, Kent (possibly Aurora Hotel)\n\n2 December 1967 – Harrow County Boys’ School, Harrow, northwest London with Two of Each\n\n9 December 1967 – Croydon, south London (no details)\n\n15 December 1967 – Ealing Town Hall, Ealing, west London\n\n23 December 1967 – Clay Pigeon, Eastcote, northwest London\n\n31 December 1967 – Private party\n\nBrian McManus (aka Connolly) – lead vocals\n\nRobin Box – lead guitar\n\nTony Hall – tenor saxophone\n\nJan Frewer – bass, vocals\n\nMick Tucker – drums\n\nTucker and Connolly weren’t happy with Torpey’s dismissal and in early February 1968 they left the band. The pair reunited with Torpey and together with bass player Steve Priest from another west London band, The Army, they formed The Sweet.\n\nRemaining members Robin Box, Jan Frewer and Tony Hall brought in drummer Roger Hills and, according to an article in the Harrow Observer from 24 October 1969, toured the northern clubs with Gordon Waller from Peter & Gordon.\n\nThey then toured Europe for three months, including playing at the P&N Club in Munich, West Germany as Rupert’s Spoon. Returning to the UK around late May, they toured the northern club circuit.\n\nSelected gigs:\n\n17 February 1968 – Ship Hotel, Weybridge, Surrey with The Effect\n\n4 May 1968 – Harrow County Boys’ School, Harrow, northwest London with Orbit 5\n\n1 June 1968 – Aurora Hotel, Gillingham, Kent with The Web and The Foundations\n\nMinus Frewer, who later went on to roadie for The Sweet, Robin Box, Tony Hall and Roger Hills found work backing The Flowerpot Men whose members included Hall’s ex-colleagues from Peter’s Faces. They toured Europe as their backing band, Rupert’s Spoon.\n\nHall later left to join Simon K & The Meantimes before joining Geno Washington & The Ram Jam in mid-1970. In early 1971, however, he reunited with Robin Box and Roger Hills in White Plains.\n\nIn later years Hall went on to work with the Houseshakers, Screaming Lord Sutch, Flying Fox and Chas & Dave among others and also did session work for Shakin’ Stevens and Sheena Easton.\n\nHuge thanks to Dave Brogden (who very kindly shared his diary entries), Jan Frewer, Alf Fripp, Val Cockayne, Phil Cockayne, Frank Torpey, Gordon Fairminer, Tony Tacon and Tony Hall for helping with the story. I’d also like to credit Mark Lay’s book on the band’s early years.\n\nThis is an extensively updated version of an article that was originally published on the Strange Brew website.

Torpey had started out in a band with future Sweet drummer Mick Tucker. Drummer Malcolm Wolffe subsequently played with Happy Magazine and then Geno Washington & The Ram Jam Band.\n\nRegulars at the Ealing Club and the State Ballroom Kilburn, the band gigged widely (see gigs list below) and travelled to Paris twice to play at the Gaff Club. The Tribe also spent a month in Copenhagen, Denmark in spring 1966. Petticoat Magazine ran a short article on them in its 4 June issue (see below).\n\nSigned to Shel Talmy’s Planet label, The Tribe’s debut single was the blues rocker “The Gamma Goochie” c/w “I’m Leaving”, which was produced by John Sullivan and issued on 4 February 1966.\n\nThe former can be found on the Big Beat compilation CD Planet Mod while the latter has been included on another CD in the Big Beat series, Planet Beat. Out of interest, Planet Mod also includes the previously unreleased Tribe recording “Don’t Let It Be”, which was cut in March 1966.\n\nAfter recording a couple of unreleased demo tracks after leaving Planet, including a cover of Edwin Starr’s “Headline News” and a track called “Sometimes You Win, Sometimes You Lose” (the latter at Abbey Road), The Tribe moved to RCA for its second release in May 1967 – the soulful “Love Is a Beautiful Thing” c/w “Steel Guitar and a Glass of Wine”.\n\nThat same month, the group landed a three-month residency at the Marquee (and while there played at the exclusive Mayfair club the Scotch of St James a handful of times after finishing up at the Marquee in the evening).\n\nIn mid-August, to tap into the burgeoning psychedelic scene, The Tribe changed name to Dream and appeared at the Festival of the Flower Children held at Woburn Festival on 27 August 1967.\n\nWhen the band broke up in October 1967, Torpey spent a few months with another west London band, Wainwright’s Gentlemen where he worked with soon-to-be Sweet band mates Brian Connolly and Mick Tucker.\n\nSelected gigs:\n\n7 November 1964 – Wilton Hall, Bletchley, Bucks with The

No part of this article may be reproduced or transmitted in any from or by any means, without prior permission from the author.\n\nUnlike the earlier versions, I have found very little information on Freddie Mack’s groups post-February/March 1969 when he split with the previous version. I would love to hear from anyone who can fill in the blanks.\n\nBilled mainly as ‘The Freddie Mac Extravanganza’, an entirely new version debuted on 11 April 1969 at the New Market Hotel in Bristol. A few weeks later, they played at the New Rainbow Suite Co-op in Birmingham on 24 April.\n\nAccording to the Nantwich Chronicle, the 13-piece band performed at the Civic Hall, Nantwich, Cheshire with Rubber Soul on 26 April.\n\nThe Freddie Mac Road Show played at the Royal Hotel, Walsall on 4 May 1969, according to the Walsall Observer and South Staffordshire Chronicle. The Birmingham Evening Mail lists the band playing at Club Cedar with Passion Forest the next day.\n\nAccording to Melody Maker, the new line up then toured West Germany in June.\n\nDrummer Maurice McElroy remembers playing in a seven-nine piece band with Freddie Mack called the Freddie Mac Extravaganza II, which featured a female singer, a male singer, a female dancer plus two other dancers. However, it only lasted a few months.\n\nMcElroy confirms that his version played from late June (just after the West German tour above) but he himself left around October 1969.\n\nMcElroy says that the band’s roadie Roy Truman left soon after joining Freddie Mack to form a band called Swegas (alongside trumpet player Chris Dawe who worked with Mack in 1967-1968) in which he played bass.\n\nSwegas appears to have been formed in mid-1969 and McElroy joined them later that year. Noel Norris appears to have played with Freddie Mack again in 1970 (see later line up below).\n\nThe drummer remembers the following musicians in Mack’s band:\n\nTerry Jenkins – lead guitar\n\nBuddy Bounds – trumpet (replaced by Noel Norris)\n\nNick Judd – keyboards\n\nMaurice McElroy – drums have found the following gigs, which would cover McElroy’s time with the group:\n\n23 June 1969 – Whisky A Go Go, Wardour Street, Soho, central London\n\n14 July 1969 – Quaintways, Chester, Cheshire with Shady Lane and Wall City Jazzmen\n\n19 July 1969 – Raven Club, RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire with Stonewall Jackson and Dusk Soul featuring Clive Bond (billed as Freddie Mack Show)\n\n21 July 1969 – Thomas A Beckett, Old Kent Road, south London (pictures of the group playing here on this date can be found at Getty) The same photo appeared in the Evening Standard, 22 July 1969, page 30\n\n28 July 1969 – Whisky A Go Go, Wardour Street, Soho, central London\n\n9 August 1969 – California Ballroom, Dunstable, Bedfordshire with Heatwave\n\n14 August 1969 – Dreamland Ballroom, Margate, Kent with Lee Harmer’s Popcorn (billed as Freddie Mac Extravaganza)\n\n25 August 1969 – Whisky A Go Go, Wardour Street, Soho, central London (billed as Freddie Mac Extravaganza)\n\n30 August 1969 – Kent Pop Festival with Deep Purple\n\n5 September 1969 – The Factory, Birmingham\n\n20 September 1969 – California Ballroom, Dunstable, Bedfordshire with First Back from Heaven and Respect (billed as Freddie Mack Extravaganza)\n\n26 October 1969 – Le Metro, Birmingham\n\nAccording to singer Bob Mundy (see comments section below), his group, The International Road Show from Southend-on-Sea joined Freddie Mack around November 1969.\n\nBob Mundy – vocals\n\nErline ? – vocals\n\nYudell Anderson – vocals\n\nSteve Sallis – guitar\n\nBrian Williams – bass\n\nJohn Walsh – Hammond organ\n\nPat Green – drums\n\nJeff Bridges – tenor sax\n\nPhil Presland – baritone sax\n\n+\n\nKenny Baxter – saxophone\n\nDigby Fairweather – trumpet\n\nI have found the following gigs for this formation:\n\n13 December 1969 – Cue Club, Paddington, London (billed as Freddie Mack & The Mack Sound)\n\n24 December 1969 – California Ballroom, Dunstable, Bedfordshire with Jimmy James & The Vagabonds and Lloyd Williams Soul Caravan\n\n27 December 1969 – Flamingo, Wardour Street, Soho, central London with The Earthquakes (billed as Freddie Mack Extravaganza)\n\n21-22 March 1970 – Tamla Village, D’Arblay Street, London with Freddie Notes & The Rudies and The Tonics\n\nLead guitarist Mick Clarke played with Freddie Mack from around mid-to-late 1970 (and possibly in the April-May 1969 line up too). Clarke was with a band called Hunter when he met Mack and this same band recorded under the name Orang-utan after he left the singer in late 1970.\n\nClarke says that the band was fluid, in as much as it would have different horn players on each gig. However, the rhythm section was pretty stable. The guitarist adds that the typical line-up would feature Freddie Mack, a go-go-dancer, lead guitar, bass, drums, organ and three to five horn players (but sometimes nine).\n\nNoel Norris, who had played with an earlier line up, left in October 1970 to form the band Marriage. Norris and Geoff Peach both went on to play with Pacific Gas & Electric in the United States. They then reunited again in a version of The Foundations in the early 1970s.\n\nClarke also says that singer Carl Douglas sat with the band at times, which would have been after September 1970 when he returned from Spain.\n\nMick Clarke lists the following musicians who played alongside him:\n\nMick Clarke – lead guitar\n\nJeffrey Jai Seopardi – drums\n\nSteve Humphries – bass\n\nEddie Thornton – trumpet\n\nNoel Norris – trumpet\n\nGeoff Peach – saxophone\n\nAround 1971/1972, former members of the band Sonority joined forces with Freddie Mack. Bobby Morris got in touch and I’ve included his email details in the comments section below.\n\nI have found the following gigs which may cover different line-ups:\n\n25 April 1970 – Baths Hall, Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire with Cloud Nine, Freddie Notes & The Dynamic Rudies and Maggie & Sharon\n\nThe Torbay Express & South Devon Echo lists a group called Tenderness (ex-Freddie Mac Show) performing at the Madison Club in Torquay on 2-3 October 1970, which suggests this band backed Freddie Mac at some point in 1970.\n\n21 November 1970 – California Ballroom, Dunstable, Bedfordshire with The Carl Edwards Roadshow\n\n25 October 1971 – Wall City, Quaintways, Chester Cheshire with Aquarius (billed as Freddie Mack Sounds)\n\n28 October 1971 – Beau Brummell Club, Royal Hotel, Crewe, Cheshire (billed as Freddie Mack Road Show)\n\n6 November 1971 – Aquarius Club, Lincoln, Lincolnshire (billed as Freddie Mack Sounds)\n\nCopyright © Nick Warburton.
