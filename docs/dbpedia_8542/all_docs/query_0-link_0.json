        "text": "English beat band\n\nThe Merseybeats (sometimes written as The Mersey Beats) are an English band that emerged from the Liverpool Merseybeat scene in the early 1960s,[1] performing at the Cavern Club along with the Beatles, Gerry and the Pacemakers, and other similar artists.[2]\n\nThe group's original members were Tony Crane (vocals, lead guitar), John Banks (drums), Aaron Williams (rhythm guitar) and Billy Kinsley (vocals, bass). Kinsley left the group at the beginning of 1964 and was replaced by John Gustafson, though Kinsley returned at the end of that year. The group split in 1966, with Crane and Kinsley continuing as a duo dubbed The Merseys. The Merseys ended in 1969. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Merseybeats would stage several occasional reunions before reforming permanently in 1993.\n\nThe current line-up is Tony Crane and his son Adrian Crane on keyboards and lead guitar.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Merseybeats\n\n[edit]\n\nOriginally called the Mavericks, the band was formed by singer/guitarist Tony Crane and singer/bassist Billy Kinsley in late 1960.[3] They became the Pacifics in September 1961.[1] They were renamed the Mersey Beats in February 1962 by Bob Wooler, MC at the Cavern Club. In April 1962, they became the Merseybeats. By now Crane and Kinsley had joined up with guitarist Aaron Williams and drummer John Banks.[1] Pete Best was offered a position in the group by Brian Epstein after being dismissed from the Beatles, but turned it down.\n\nThey signed a recording contract with Fontana Records and had their first hit single in 1963 with \"It's Love That Really Counts\",[3] followed in 1964 by their million-selling record \"I Think of You\", which gained them their first gold disc.[1] They suffered a setback in February 1964 when Kinsley left to form his own band, the Kinsleys.[1] He was temporarily replaced by Bob Garner (later of the Creation) and permanently by Johnny Gustafson, formerly of the Big Three.[1]\n\nWith Gustafson they had two more major hits during 1964, \"Don't Turn Around\" and \"Wishin' and Hopin'\",[3] and released their only album in the latter part of that year. Kinsley returned to the group at the end of 1964.[1]\n\nThe Merseybeats appeared regularly at Liverpool's Cavern Club, and they claim to have appeared there with the Beatles on more occasions than any other band from that era. They were also successful abroad, touring in Germany and the US in 1964, and having their own Merseybeats Show on Italian television.\n\nThe Merseys\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring 1965 their initial success waned, and after a few more singles the band folded in early 1966. Crane and Kinsley continued as a vocal duo called the Merseys.[1] They had a major hit with their first single, a cover of the McCoys' \"Sorrow\", which reached Number 4 in the UK Singles Chart.[1] The introduction on the record featured a bowed bass played by Jack Bruce. A line from this song, \"with your long blonde hair and eyes of blue,\" is included in the Beatles' \"It's All Too Much\", released in 1969 as part of the Yellow Submarine soundtrack album. David Bowie recorded a single version in 1973 which reached Number 3 in the UK Singles Chart.[1] The duo split in 1969, with Crane and Kinsley both going on to front a number of other bands.\n\nTony Crane and The Merseybeats\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 1970s Crane continued to tour and perform live as Tony Crane and the Merseybeats, with various line-ups.[1]\n\nLiverpool Express\n\n[edit]\n\nSee Liverpool Express\n\nThe Merseybeats re-formed\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Merseybeats' original drummer John Banks died on 20 April 1988, at the age of 44.\n\nKinsley and Crane re-formed the Merseybeats in 1993, and after celebrating 45 years in the music industry in 2006, they continued to tour and perform on the 'sixties circuit', and at venues in the UK, and across Europe. Kinsley departed in 2020, leaving the band in the hands of Crane and his son Adrian.\n\nFormer bassist and vocalist John Gustafson died on 12 September 2014, at the age of 72.\n\nMembers of The Merseybeats (1961–1966, 1969–present)\n\n[edit]\n\nCurrent\n\nTony Crane – lead guitar, lead vocals (1961–1966, 1969–present)\n\nAdrian Crane – keyboards, lead guitar (2000–present)\n\nFormer\n\nBilly Kinsley – bass, lead vocals, rhythm guitar (1961–1964, 1964–1965, 1969–2020)\n\nDavid Elias – rhythm guitar, backing vocals (1961–1962)\n\nFrank Sloane – drums (1961–1962)\n\nAaron Williams – rhythm guitar, backing vocals (1962–1966)\n\nJohn Banks – drums (1962–1966)\n\nBob Garner – bass guitar, lead vocals (1964)\n\nJohnny Gustafson – bass, lead vocals (1964)\n\nKen Mundye – drums[5] (1969–1974, filled in for Banks for a few gigs during 1965)\n\nAllan Cosgrove – drums (1974–2000)\n\nBob Packham – bass, backing vocals (1974–2021)\n\nRocking Johnny John Houghton – lead guitar, backing vocals (1979–1981)\n\nColin Drummond – keyboards, violin (1986–1993)\n\nDave Goldberg – keyboards (1993–2000, 2009–2011)\n\nLou Rosenthal – drums (2000–2021)\n\nChris Finley – keyboards (2011)\n\nToni Baker – keyboards (2011)\n\nAlan Lovell – rhythm guitar, lead vocals (2011)\n\nMembers of The Merseys (1966–1969)\n\n[edit]\n\nTony Crane – lead vocals (1966–1969)\n\nBilly Kinsley – lead vocals (1966–1969)\n\nwith backing group The Fruit Eating Bears:\n\nJoey Molland – guitars\n\nChris Finley – keyboards\n\nGeorge Cassidy – bass\n\nKenny Goodlass – drums\n\nKen Mundye – drums\n\nThe Merseybeats discography\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\n1963: Oriole Records compilation – This Is Merseybeat Volume One (one track – \"Our Day Will Come\")\n\n1964 (June): Fontana Records – The Merseybeats – UK #12:[6]\n\nMilkman\n\nHello Young Lovers\n\nHe Will Break Your Heart\n\nFunny Face\n\nReally Mystified\n\nThe Girl That I Marry\n\nFools Like Me\n\nMy Heart and I\n\nBring It on Home to Me\n\nLavender Blue\n\nJumping Jonah\n\nDon't Turn Around\n\n1990: Fontana Records – The Merseybeats – first CD release of the album with several of the group's non-album A- and B-sides added\n\n2002: Bear Family Records – I Think of You: The Complete Recordings – compiles the group's entire discography on one CD\n\n2003: Merseybeat Records – Anniversary Tour 2003 – live album\n\n2021: Cherry Red Records – The Merseybeats/The Merseys – I Stand Accused: The Complete Sixties Recordings – Double CD comprising the complete discography of the Merseybeats and the Merseys\n\nEPs\n\n[edit]\n\n1963: Fontana Records – I Think of You:\n\nI Think Of You\n\nMister Moonlight\n\nIt's Love That Really Counts\n\nThe Fortune Teller\n\n1964 (March): Fontana Records – The Merseybeats on Stage:\n\nLong Tall Sally\n\nI'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Cry\n\nShame\n\nYou Can't Judge A Book By Its Cover\n\n1964 (November): Fontana Records – Wishin' and Hopin':\n\nWishin' and Hopin'\n\nHello, Young Lovers\n\nMilkman\n\nJumping Jonah\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Peak chart\n\npositions Record Label B-side Album UK 1963 \"It's Love That Really Counts\" 24 Fontana Records \"The Fortune Teller\" \"I Think of You\" 5 \"Mister Moonlight\" 1964 \"Don't Turn Around\" 13 \"Really Mystified\" The Merseybeats \"Wishin' and Hopin'\" 13 \"Milkman\" \"Last Night (I Made a Little Girl Cry)\" 40 \"See Me Back\" 1965 \"Don't Let It Happen to Us\" — \"It Would Take a Long, Long Time\" \"I Love You, Yes I Do\" 22 \"Good, Good Lovin'\" \"I Stand Accused\" 38 \"All My Life\"\n\nVideos\n\n[edit]\n\n1999: The Merseybeats in Concert\n\nThe Merseys discography\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\n2021: Cherry Red Records – The Merseybeats/The Merseys – I Stand Accused: The Complete Sixties Recordings – Double CD comprising the complete discography of the Merseybeats and the Merseys\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Peak chart\n\npositions Record Label B-side UK 1966 \"Sorrow\" 4 Fontana Records \"Some Other Day\" \"So Sad About Us\" \"Love Will Continue\" \"Rhythm of Love\" \"Is It Love\" 1967 \"The Cat\" \"Change of Heart\" \"Penny in My Pocket\" \"I Hope You're Happy\" 1968 \"Lovely Loretta\" \"Dreaming\" \"Honey Do\" (as Crackers) \"It Happens All the Time\" (as Crackers)\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nLewisohn, Mark (2013).
