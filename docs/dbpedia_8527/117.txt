The Prime Minister has appointed Craig Oliver, currently Controller of BBC Global News, as the Director of Communications at 10 Downing Street.

The move follows last month’s resignation of ex-News of the World editor Andy Coulson amid continuing controversy surrounding phone-hacking allegations.

The Prime Minister said: “I am very pleased that Craig Oliver is to become the new Director of Communications at 10 Downing Street. Craig has formidable experience as a broadcast journalist. He will do an excellent job in explaining and communicating the Government's programme.”

Mr Oliver said: “I'm delighted to be joining David Cameron and his team at such an exciting and challenging time. It's difficult to leave the BBC after a fascinating few years – but this is an opportunity I can't turn down.”
