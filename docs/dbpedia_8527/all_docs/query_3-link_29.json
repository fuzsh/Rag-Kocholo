        "text": "Hey, Hair-in-the-fridge. If you think you can escape from this mess, you can't. All you gotta do is watch a little TV. Disrespect, mockery, anger and contempt are all over the airwaves.\n\nOn Sunday, on CTV's Question Period, Craig Oliver was interviewing Finance Minister Jim Flaherty. After letting Flaherty waffle for a while, Oliver barked at Flaherty, \"Are you getting it?\" Later, he responded to another bit of Flaherty flim-flammery with, \"Are you aware of the seriousness of the situation?\"\n\nWatching TV over the past few days has been a bracing and, one has to say with some astonishment, exciting experience. This isn't politics we're watching unfold. This is personal.\n\nYesterday, around noon, on CTV Newsnet, Scott Laurie delivered a summary of the news, mainly from Ottawa, and then brought Mike Duffy on the air. Laurie put his hand to his head, and said, \"You know, Mike, I dunno where to start. This is just incredible.\" Around the same time, on CBC Newsworld, Nancy Wilson was killing time before the next news update and, over footage of the House of Commons, said: \"The political climate is hot, hot, hot. We're seeing lots of political reporters milling about. ... This is a very fascinating story, fluid for sure.\"\n\nIt's all very strange. As if the country and its media woke up with a start and decided that Hair-in-the-fridge and his cronies were, well, inadequate, inept and incompetent.\n\nThis is extraordinary. Canada is a big country, as we all know. And, as far much of the world is concerned, it's a big, boring country. But, last Thursday, at some point between the time I had lunch with a colleague in Vancouver and I landed in Toronto in the middle of the night, Canadian politics - famously boring, as some see it - was suddenly exciting. How exciting? There are two signs that something major is happening in this country - Don Newman gets all giddy and Craig Oliver is all fired up.\n\nThis current political crisis presents a challenge to our TV news reporters and anchors. Events are usually predictable and bland and offer little cause for excitement. The gusto and vigour of fast, constantly changing reports that characterize the U.S. all-news channels are absent here. Our pundits are wordy, windy and earnest. Down there, the pundits are passionate, pithy or barking mad.\n\nOn Friday, I decided to check out Politics with Don Newman on CBC Newsworld and Mike Duffy Live on CTV Newsnet.\n\nI told somebody that this was my plan and response was something like, \"Whoa, dude, good idea!\" Obviously, in certain quarters, these broadcasts are not considered must-see TV. On Friday, they were.\n\nNewman looked unflappable, as usual. At first, it seemed this suddenly evolving revolution in Ottawa, and talk of a coalition government, was not going to faze him. No Wolf Blitzer-style, \"You're watching Politics with Don Newman!\" or \"Breaking news, breaking news!\" from Don. He had a long chat with Keith Boag, CBC's parliamentary fella, and, frankly, it was a bit boring.\n\nOver on CTV Newsnet, Duffy was all too obviously having the time of his life. MP after MP squeezed into the little interview space in the House of Commons, and agitated prattling ensued. Then, back on Newsworld, Newman suddenly started getting sarcastic. He mocked the idea of Hair-in-the-fridge Harper not knowing much about Flaherty's Economic Statement. He laughed. He was downright giddy.\n\nIt was Sunday's Question Period on CTV that nailed it, though. Flaherty looked stunned, petulant and out-of-touch. The out-of-touch element is what Oliver made crystal clear. Everything Flaherty said brought a barking rhetorical question. As Flaherty claimed to be willing to talk to the opposition and to others about an economic stimulus plan, Oliver snapped, \"Why didn't you consult before now? Why didn't you do what Obama is doing - reach out to the opposition?\" Flaherty could just sit there and take it.\n\nThe capper came at the end of the tense interview. Flaherty claimed that a steady hand was needed to guide our economy. He used the phrase \"steady as she goes.\" Oliver replied, \"Sometimes steady as she goes is not a good idea, especially if you are heading for the rocks!\"\n\nIt dripped with contempt, and that contempt came not from personal vindictiveness but from that place where the personal is political - in the heart, and with the strong sense that what you're feeling is what everyone watching is feeling.\n\nWe are witnessing extraordinary television right now. Long may it last. Check it out, Hair-in-the-fridge.\n\nTomorrow, by the way, more reports from Vancouver.\n\n*****\n\nAiring tonight\n\nThe Mentalist (CBS, 9 p.m.) is definitely a hit, and little wonder. On most contemporary crime shows, mysteries are solved with a science we're not sure actually exists. Here, it's all about human nature and the hero's ability to understand people. Tonight, our hero, Patrick Jane (Simon Baker), suspects the only surviving member of a National Guard unit of murdering his friends, and goes undercover to prove it.\n\nLaw & Order: Special Victims (NBC, CTV, 10 p.m.) is anchored in the personal tonight. A rape case involving a young female Marine stirs up painful memories from Detective Benson's (Mariska Hargitay) past. Benson is put to the test when a pregnant corporal disappears from her post as a Marine, and is about to give birth to her rapist's child. With flashbacks of sexual assault, Benson soon realizes that her past may stir up painful emotions that threaten her ability to remain professional.\n\nNorm (Newsworld, 10 p.m. on The Lens) is a powerful doc about Karen Llewellyn and her struggle to take care of her brother, Norm, who was born with Down syndrome in 1949 when children like him were sent away to institutions. Though Norman spent much of his childhood with his family, he was ultimately put into foster care by his parents. Karen, who had been adopted, spent most of her life feeling that she had usurped Norm's place in the family. The day he left, she vowed they would never be separated again. Now, they both face the harsh realities of aging.\n\nJ.D.\n\nCheck local listings."
