        "text": "Craig Oliver’s diary really should be interesting. He was David Cameron’s director of communications and he was, his publicists tell us, “in the room at every key moment” of the campaign to keep Britain in the EU.\n\nJust to underline his importance, Oliver is embarrassingly keen to tell you how close he was to important people: “Merkel sits down opposite me…. DC calls straight after. He says I did really well…Obama saunters in with the PM. He swings round my side of the table and shakes my hand…”\n\nYet for all the physical closeness, despite the grand job and great importance, Oliver’s diaries say nothing revelatory about the events for which he was a front-row spectator or about the people involved. This is a book about access without insight, proximity without perception.\n\nThe book is subtitled “The Inside Story of Brexit” but is actually the inside story of how a press officer went to meetings with other press officers (and some very important politicians) and talked, often bitterly, about the minutiae of daily media coverage of the referendum. Before you conclude that means it’s of interest solely to Westminster insiders and political hacks, let me assure you that as a political hack of 15 years’ standing, I found it almost painfully tedious.\n\nTo read this book is to suffer a form of intellectual claustrophobia, trapped in Oliver’s narrow world. He does show a few signs of being aware of the big world outside his self-absorbed existence, pondering once or twice how the wider public might see the events that largely pass him by. But these are brief flashes of light in the darkness, fading quickly as we are treated to yet another description of a meeting where Oliver said something clever and important about something essentially trivial.\n\nThe result of this all this self-regard is a book that is frustrating as well as boring. We barely catch sight of people who really were interesting and important, such as Cameron, let alone learn about what they were thinking and feeling or why they did the things they did. On the whole, Oliver thinks it’s more important to tell us about what he said to them.\n\nThere is no reflection on the strategic fundamentals of the referendum: why was Remain unable to counter the Leave campaign's arguments on immigration? Why were Labour voters so lukewarm about the EU? Why didn't clever people like Oliver see the Leave vote coming?\n\nNor do we learn anything of substance about the EU or Cameron’s policy towards it. Oliver also held the title of deputy chief of staff and was said by “friends” to be closely involved in policy formation and the important business of government.\n\nBut if he was, this book betrays no sign of such a role: Cameron’s attempts to renegotiate Britain’s EU relationship take place somewhere else while Oliver sits waiting for his master to return, filling his day complaining about headlines on the BBC and newspaper editorials. (Full disclosure: I wrote some of the Telegraph leaders that cause him such anguish.)\n\nOliver’s book was written with comparable haste but rather less control, dashed off in a couple of months. The result is a text that is no joy to read, and often confusing: days and dates are not defined, events and characters suddenly hove into view without explanation or context.\n\nOliver is neither a stylist nor a wit. There’s no shame in that, but his very ordinary prose makes it a little harder to swallow his criticism of the writing of Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. Not just their writing, either. This book is an attempt settle scores.\n\nEveryone on the Remain side is decent and good and clever and talented. Everyone on the Leave side is shifty, incompetent, odd or just plain nasty. This lopsided view is understandable enough: the Leavers’ victory shredded Oliver’s career and credibility; he’d be a saint to speak kindly of them.\n\nA book that promises “the inside story” should answer at least some of the reader’s questions about its subject. Oliver falls well short of that standard, instead leaving only more questions. Foremost among them: is the author of this unfortunate book the least deserving recipient of a knighthood in modern times?\n\nUnleashing Demons: The Inside Story of Brexit by Craig Oliver is published by Hodder at £20.
