        "text": "Canal+ has set a political thriller about the assassination of the President as its latest TV series from the Czech Republic.\n\nMoloch kicks off after an attack on the fictional President, as the investigative journalist Martin Braun teams up with the young online investigator Julia to uncover exactly what happened and why. During their search, they become embroiled in a dangerous game of secret services, international politics and forces determined to keep the truth hidden for various reasons.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nVivendi Eyes London Stock Exchange Listing For Canal+ As Part Of Company Split Project\n\nDavid Suchet Lands First TV Acting Role In Six Years With Channel 5 Series 'The Au Pair' Opposite 'Lupin' Star\n\nCanal+ Ups Stake In Asian Streamer Viu; See-Saw Snaps Up Plimsoll Drama Boss - Global Briefs\n\nMiroslav Donutil, a prominent Czech film and theatre actor, will star as the President of the Czech Republic, and Jan Révai, a frequently cast Czech actor, will play the role of investigative journalist. Polish actress Eliza Rycembel, known for her role in the Oscar-nominated film Corpus Christi, will play the online investigator Julia.\n\nScreenwriter Štefan Titka, who co-created the miniseries concept with Vratislav Šlajer and Lukáš Hanulák, said the story has “topicality” following the assassination attempts on Donald Trump and Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico.\n\n“Our aim is to provide a deeper societal and moral context to such incidents through our story, but Moloch will primarily be an intense thriller with surprising revelations, inspired by our favourite political thrillers from the 1970s and 1980s,” he added.\n\nFilming on the series has kicked off and will run until October in Slovakia and Ukraine. CANAL+, Bionaut and Raketa are producing together with Kateryna Vyshnevska, Vratislav Šlajer (Bionaut), Hanulák and Jakub Košťál. Hanulák is also directing. Ukraine’s Film.UA is doing production services. The project is the first series from Central Europe to receive support from Eurimages’ fledgling programme for series coproductions.\n\nThe series is scheduled to premiere on the CANAL+ streaming platform in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in spring 2025.\n\nBest of Deadline\n\n‘It Ends With Us’ Soundtrack: All the Songs You’ll Hear\n\nBook To Movie Adaptations Coming Out This Year\n\nList Of Hollywood & Media Layoffs So Far In 2024: From Paramount To Warner Bros Discovery To CNN"
