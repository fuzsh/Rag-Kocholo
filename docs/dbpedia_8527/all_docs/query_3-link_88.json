        "text": "BBC staff responded with shock and anger today as Huw Edwards – formerly one of the nation’s most admired broadcasters – pleaded guilty to making indecent images of children.\n\nThe BBC has admitted it knew that Edwards had been arrested last November and called his actions “abhorrent” in a statement.\n\nBut bosses faced calls for a fresh investigation into the newsreader’s conduct and demands for the corporation to try and claw back the salary awarded to its highest-paid journalist.\n\n“This is terrible for the BBC. There was compete shock at the guilty plea,” said one staffer.\n\n“News of the arrest came as a total bombshell on Monday and the details of the charges the BBC had to report are sickening.\n\n“This was the man who held the nation’s hand through the death of Queen Elizabeth. No-one had any idea there was such a dark side to a trusted colleague.”\n\nThe 62-year-old veteran broadcaster admitted three offences relating to 41 photographs he had on WhatsApp, including seven of the most serious type.\n\nEdwards committed the offences between December 2020 and August 2021, Westminster Magistrates’ Court was told today. During this period, he had been involved in an online chat with convicted paedophile Alex Williams, 25, who sent him 377 sexual images on WhatsApp, of which 41 were indecent images of children.\n\nThe investigation into Edwards began in November 2023 after information was received from South Wales Police.\n\nAn examination of a phone seized by its officers as part of an entirely unrelated investigation revealed Edwards’ participation in the WhatsApp conversation.\n\nWilliams was charged in relation to his WhatsApp chat with Edwards and pleaded guilty. He was convicted of seven offences following the investigation by South Wales Police and received a 12-month suspended sentence.\n\nThere is anger within the BBC that the broadcaster had paid Edwards up to £480,000 despite him only appearing on air for three months of the last financial year. After the BBC learned of his arrest, it continued to pay him for a further five months.\n\nHe had also received a £40,000 pay rise prior to his suspension last July over claims that he paid a teenager for explicit pictures. Edwards left the BBC in April on “medical advice”, nine months after being removed from screens.\n\n“People have been asking if anyone at the BBC knew Edwards had been arrested in November when he was off air getting full pay?,” an insider asked.\n\n“News staff are facing redundancy at the same time as the BBC has been paying someone we now know is a sex offender.”\n\nThe BBC said it had been told “in confidence” that Edwards had been arrested in November on “suspicion of serious offences and released on bail whilst the police continued their investigation”.\n\nThe broadcaster said it would have dimissed Edwards had he been charged during the period he was on suspension. The BBC “had also been made aware of significant risk to his health”.\n\nThe BBC is now under pressure to open a new investigation into Edwards. Following his suspension, the BBC received complaints that Edwards had been sending inappropriate messages to some younger members of staff. They were considered not to have reached the level of harassment.\n\nA staffer said: “People were nervous about making complaints over such a powerful figure within the BBC. There should now be an opportunity for anyone to come forward if they have had experiences they didn’t want to discuss before.”\n\nThe seriousness of the offences dismayed some newsroom figures, who had previously expressed sympathy for Edwards. “There was a view that he had been unlucky, his private life was a mess and he’d been caught in a tabloid sting,” said one former colleague. “Now that will turn into revulsion and we don’t know what else might come out.”\n\nExecutives hope the matter is now ended, i understands, with the guilty plea removing the need for a trial which would have led to witnesses giving evidence that could have led the headlines for days.\n\nEdwards’ plea surprised many at the BBC but editors quickly determined that the story should lead its bulletins.\n\nCulture editor Katie Razzall pulled no punches, telling viewers: “It’s a spectacular fall from grace for a figure who embodied the BBC’s values of trust, reliability and responsibility.”\n\nEdwards’ disgrace could be “reputationally damaging for the BBC” she said, depending on “when they learned of the arrest. Why was he still being paid and will the BBC try to recoup some of his salary? We are still in the dark about the answers.”\n\nSir Craig Oliver, who was editor of the flagship BBC Ten O’Clock News bulletin when Edwards was lead presenter, said the star could be a “very difficult and complicated man to deal with. He talked about his bouts of depression, he sometimes clashed with staff. But most people who know him will be shocked that he pleaded guilty to this.”\n\nOliver told Radio 4’s World at One that shortly before The Sun story that prompted his suspension, colleagues had become concerned over Edwards’ behaviour amid “gossip about his private life”.\n\nSir Craig said the BBC had a “big decision to make” about whether to use Edwards’ presentation of landmark moments in the nation’s history, such as the death of the Queen and the King’s coronation. “Will people see it as tainted and problematic?” he asked.\n\nIn its report on his downfall, BBC News used pictures of a silent Edwards preparing to make the announcement about Queen Elizabeth’s death but not his actual words. Sir Craig warned that seeking to claw back Edwards’ salary could lead to an expensive legal battle.\n\nThe BBC’s statement in full\n\nA BBC spokesperson said: “The BBC is shocked to hear the details which have emerged in court today. There can be no place for such abhorrent behaviour and our thoughts are with all those affected.\n\n“The police have confirmed that the charges are not connected to the original complaint raised with the BBC in the summer of 2023, nevertheless in the interests of transparency we think it important to set out some points about events of the last year.\n\n“In November 2023, whilst Mr Edwards was suspended, the BBC as his employer at the time was made aware in confidence that he had been arrested on suspicion of serious offences and released on bail whilst the police continued their investigation. At the time, no charges had been brought against Mr Edwards and the BBC had also been made aware of significant risk to his health.\n\n“Today we have learnt of the conclusion of the police process in the details as presented to the court. If at any point during the period Mr Edwards was employed by the BBC he had been charged, the BBC had determined it would act immediately to dismiss him. In the end, at the point of charge he was no longer an employee of the BBC.\n\n“During this period, in the usual way, the BBC has kept its corporate management of these issues separate from its independent editorial functions.\n\n“We want to reiterate our shock at Mr Edwards’ actions and our thoughts remain with all those affected.”\n\nThe BBC declined to comment on calls for Edwards’ pay to be recovered.\n\nA suspended sentence – a sentence that is served in the community instead of in prison – might be considered for Edwards, according to the prosecution.\n\nHis barrister Philip Evans KC, mitigating, told the court that there is “no suggestion in this case” that he has “in the traditional sense of the word, created any image of any sort”.\n\n“It is important also to remember for context that devices, Mr Edwards’ devices, have been seized, have been searched, and there’s nothing in those devices,” he said.\n\n“It is only the images that are the subject of the charges that came via a WhatsApp chat.”"
