        "text": "Spare a thought for Craig Oliver, or Craig Dre as Benedict Brogan is calling the new Downing Street director of communications.\n\nThe poor chap has barely arrived in Downing Street and is already under fire for extravagant tastes (those Dr Dre headphones) and a poor sense of time-keeping after he missed David Cameron's convoy on Monday.\n\nOliver's failure to catch his lift in the limo, with echoes of a West Wing episode when Josh Lynam missed the presidential convoy, was caused by his first crisis in No 10.\n\nCritics say this was of Craig's own making when he tried to play down awkward headlines in Monday's Guardian and other newspapers about Prince Andrew's future as Britain's special trade representative. Oliver reportedly told the BBC that the stories were overblown but then prompted another round of difficult headlines by saying that the Prince had effectively been given a yellow card: another gaffe and the Queen's son would be off.\n\nCue a rash of blogs and stories which raised questions about Oliver's suitability for the job.\n\nLet's be charitable for a moment and put Oliver's difficulties down to the inevitable teething troubles anyone can experience in a new job. This allows us to ask a much more important question: is Oliver the right person but at the wrong time?\n\nAndy Coulson handpicked Oliver as his successor for two broad reasons. Oliver:\n\nIs unflappable and has been a figure of calm authority at senior levels at the BBC, ITV and Channel 4. That is no mean feat.\n\nIs better qualified than virtually anyone else in Britain to judge how to promote and project the prime minister on television.\n\nWhen Coulson put these arguments to Cameron and George Osborne they wasted little time in signing up the former editor of the BBC News at Ten.\n\nThe prime minister believed that one of Coulson's finest achievements was to short circuit the traditional way of projecting stories. In the old days a political leader's staff would give a newspaper an old fashioned scoop which would be put on the front page. This would then be followed up by the broadcasters.\n\nCoulson instead cut out the middlemen (newspapers) and briefed the stories directly to the broadcasters who would lead their bulletins when an exclusive interview with Cameron was thrown in. This did not always go to plan because some broadcasters, such as the BBC political editor Nick Robinson, have a habit of asking awkward questions.\n\nSo the idea was for Oliver to build on Coulson's most important innovation and deal with the media in this order. Broadcasters would come first, followed by online media. The press would be his third priority.\n\nIn drawing up this strategy, Coulson, Cameron and Oliver overlooked an important detail. Handing stories on a plate to the broadcasters works when a party leader or a prime minister is in command of the political landscape, as Cameron was from the autumn of 2007 (shortly after Coulson joined his team) until around the time of Coulson's departure in January this year.\n\nWhen a prime minister struggles to control the agenda, as Cameron is now, the Coulson model does not work. At times like this the No 10 communications team have to become much cannier for a simple reason. When governments enter choppy waters the press and bloggers set the agenda because there is no end of disgruntled ministers, backbenchers, advisers and former advisers lining up to twist the knife. That is precisely what is happening now.\n\nThe challenge for Oliver, who has no experience of newspapers, is to show he can anticipate trouble. The era of cosy handouts is over for the moment."
