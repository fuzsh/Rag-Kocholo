        "text": "A Ministerial letter issued collectively from Guernsey, Isle of man and Jersey to the Prime Minister, David Cameron\n\nRead the letter to Prime Minister, David Cameron from President, Policy and Resources Committee, States of Guernsey, Hon Allan Bell CBE MHK, Chief Minister, Isle of Man Government and Senator Ian Gorst, Chief Minister, Government of Jersey, which is available in the downloads section on this page.\n\nCopied text from the letter below:\n\nDear Prime Minister\n\nThe Referendum decision by the United Kingdom (UK) electorate means that Protocol 3 of the UK's Treaty of Accession, which governs the Crown Dependencies' relationship with the European Union, will cease when the UK leaves the EU.\n\nThe Crown Dependencies' long held position on our future relationship with the EU is that we wish to retain the status quo. We believe our interests will be best served by a continuation, as far as is possible, of the substance of the current arrangements, and in particular, the provisions of Protocol 3 relating to trade in goods between the Islands and the EU.\n\nWe have welcomed the regular engagement with your Ministers and officials in the years leading up to the renegotiation and Referendum, which has helped ensure that we have been kept informed of developments and that we have been able to discuss and confirm our position on areas of importance. We note your comments in the House of Commons that you will engage with the Crown Dependencies in this process.\n\nGoing forward, continued communication and cooperation between our governments will be essential as we seek to ensure that our respective interests are understood and, ultimately, protected. In this regard, we wish to make three points:\n\nFor all the Crown Dependencies, our closest relationship is with the UK. It is our understanding that the UK's withdrawal from the EU will not prevent the continued free trade in goods and services, the free movement of capital and the free movement of people between our jurisdictions. We trust that this continues to be the view of the UK Government and we look forward, over the coming months and years, to building on the long-standing, mutually beneficial relationship between us.\n\nBy virtue of Protocol 3, the Crown Dependencies currently form part of the common Customs Union allowing for tariff free trade in goods with the EU. This relationship will cease once the UK formally withdraws from the EU, and we therefore have a direct interest both in the terms of the UK's withdrawal, and the negotiation of a future relationship.\n\nDecisions taken on the grandfathering of rights for EU nationals are of particular relevance to the Crown Dependencies, as we are home to a significant number of non-British EU nationals and residents that have EU rights through their connection to the UK.\n\nWe recognise, of course, that the process for the UK's withdrawal from the EU and the negotiation of a future relationship is likely to be both complicated and highly resource intensive. Equally, you will understand the significant economic interest and the individual interests that we, as elected leaders of the Crown Dependencies, have a duty to safeguard.\n\nWe would be grateful for your confirmation, therefore, that undertakings given that the Crown Dependencies will be kept informed on matters of interest to us are adhered to, and where appropriate, are able to contribute to relevant discussions and negotiations.\n\nWe look forward to working with the United Kingdom to further our respective interests.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nDeputy Gavin St Pier, Chief Minister, States of Guernsey\n\nHon Allan Bell CBE MHK, Chief Minister, Isle of Man Government\n\nSenator Ian Gorst , Chief Minister, Government of Jersey"
