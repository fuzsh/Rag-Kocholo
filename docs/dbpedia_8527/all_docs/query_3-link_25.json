He will do an excellent job in explaining and communicating the government's programme.\"\n\nOliver, a former Scottish Television trainee, added: \"I'm delighted and privileged to be joining David Cameron and his team at such an exciting and challenging time.\n\n\"My background is broadcasting, but I know that newspapers play a crucial role and I look forward to talking with them.\n\n\"It's difficult to leave the BBC after working here for five fascinating years - but this is an opportunity I can't turn down.\""
