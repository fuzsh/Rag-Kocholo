        "text": "DAVID Cameron’s controversial former communications chief never joined the Conservative Party, it has emerged.\n\nSenior Tory officials made the discovery about Sir Craig Oliver last week after being told he wanted a pass to the Tories’ annual conference, which began today.\n\nThe revelation stunned some party bosses, who believed he had become a member after working in No10 for five years and helped to run the Tories’ general election campaign last year.\n\nFormer BBC TV executive Sir Craig has come to Birmingham to publicise a tell-all book about the EU referendum campaign that is published this week.\n\nBut as he isn’t a Tory member, the party insisted on trying to charge him £1,450 to come to the four day-long conference as a \"commercial guest\" instead.\n\nA senior Tory party source said: “If you work for the Prime Minister and run election campaigns for the Conservatives, it’s bizarre he never became a party member.\n\n“A lot of us are now wondering why not.”\n\nBut a source close to Sir Craig told The Sun: \"Craig sweated blood and tears for the Conservative Party for five years, and his dedication to it cannot be questioned.\n\n“He never claimed he was a party member to anyone so it's a real shame that people should feel the need to suggest he has mislead anyone because they don’t like some of the hard truths he has written.\""
