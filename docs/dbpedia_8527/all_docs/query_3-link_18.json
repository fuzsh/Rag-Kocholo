        "text": "Craig Oliver — sorry, Sir Craig Oliver — was David Cameron’s Director of Politics and Communications from 2011-16. He was in charge of the Remain campaign’s “air war” during the EU referendum. Well, as Cameron said, “that went well”. He kept a diary for the first six months of 2016 that has been hastily cobbled together into a book purporting to be the “inside story of Brexit”.\n\nThat fight for the country’s future was “the biggest political story for a generation”. It surely ought to make for an exciting read? Well try this: “The key meeting of the morning involves bringing together the key stakeholders around the leaflet setting out the Government position on the advantages of staying in the EU.” Pages of this book"
