        "text": "Sir Craig Oliver is a distinguished figure in British political communications, known for his influential role as the Director of Politics and Communications for former British Prime Minister David Cameron. His tenure of six years at No 10 Downing Street was marked by significant contributions to the government’s strategy, messaging, and campaigns, showcasing his expertise in political communication and strategy.\n\nOne of Sir Craig’s notable achievements was his direction of communications for several political teams, including the 2015 General Election. His efforts played a crucial role in achieving an unexpected overall majority for the Conservative Party, defying the polls and demonstrating his strategic acumen. However, perhaps his most famous role was as the Director of Communications for the campaign to keep Britain in the European Union during the Brexit Referendum. The intense and high-stakes nature of this campaign was captured in his bestselling book, “Unleashing Demons,” which later inspired the Channel 4 drama “Brexit: The Uncivil War.” In this drama, the characters of Sir Craig and Dominic Cummings were portrayed by Rory Kinnear and Benedict Cumberbatch, respectively, highlighting the significant impact of his work in shaping UK’s political landscape.\n\nDuring his time in Downing Street, Sir Craig undertook a radical overhaul of government communications, adapting them for the digital age. This transformation showcases his forward-thinking approach and adaptability to changing media landscapes. Now, as a Keynote Speaker, he frequently discusses themes such as digital transformation, communications strategy, and leadership. His experiences allow him to offer unique insights into the challenges of navigating a complex, constantly evolving media world during times of significant change and volatility.\n\nBefore his pivotal role in government, Sir Craig had a successful career in journalism, including stints as an editor of the BBC’s flagship television news programmes and Controller of BBC Global. His transition from journalism to political communications and back to the media as a broadcaster and commentator exemplifies his versatility and deep understanding of both sides of the news industry.\n\nCurrently, Sir Craig Oliver is a Partner and Co-Global Head of Strategy and Reputation at FGS Global, where he works with some of the world’s most prominent businesses. His expertise in strategy and reputation management is highly sought after in the corporate world. Additionally, his commitment to social causes is evident in his role as a trustee of the Make a Wish charity, reflecting his dedication to giving back to the community.\n\nSir Craig’s career is a testament to his ability to adapt and excel in various high-stakes environments, from the heart of British government to the global stage of journalism and corporate strategy. His journey offers invaluable insights into the intersections of media, politics, and public affairs, making him a respected and influential figure in these fields."
