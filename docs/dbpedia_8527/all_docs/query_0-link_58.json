        "text": "Welcome to Prime Ministerial. In each episode, Jonn Elledge and Stephen Bush look at the legacy of the previous six prime ministers and ask whether they achieved success on their own terms.\n\nThis episode focuses on David Cameron. A special adviser during the Major government, he eventually succeeded his old boss, Michael Howard, as party leader and took the Conservatives back into government, albeit in a coalition. After winning a majority in 2015, he lost the Brexit referendum that followed and with it his premiership.\n\nStephen and Jonn speak to the political economist Helen Thompson and Cameron’s former communications adviser Craig Oliver.\n\nProduced by Adrian Bradley and May Robson, with thanks to Caroline Crampton and Nick Hilton.\n\nHow to listen to the New Statesman Podcast\n\n1.
