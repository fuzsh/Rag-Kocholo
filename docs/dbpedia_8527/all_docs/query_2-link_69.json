        "text": "When David Cameron resigned as Britain’s prime minister after losing the Brexit vote in 2016, he offered members of Parliament a rueful valedictory: “I was the future once.” Few, perhaps including Mr. Cameron himself, expected to see him return.\n\nAnd yet on Monday morning, there he was, striding up the leaf-strewn driveway of 10 Downing Street to accept an appointment as foreign secretary from the current prime minister, Rishi Sunak. Mr. Cameron’s appointment must rank as one of the most remarkable comebacks in British political history.\n\nFor Mr. Sunak, who has presented himself as a change agent, it is not just a surprising choice, but also a deeply counterintuitive one. Mr. Cameron is nothing if not a bridge to the Conservative past. The decisions he made, and the policies he pursued, are vexing Mr. Sunak’s government today, a dubious inheritance that helps explain the erratic course of a prime minister in political trouble.\n\nFew public figures are more closely identified with Brexit than Mr. Cameron, who called the referendum on leaving the European Union, campaigned against it, and then resigned after a narrow majority of Britons, including Mr. Sunak, voted in favor of it.\n\nAnd few are more linked to austerity, the economic policy that Mr. Cameron, 57, introduced when he took office in 2010. It has been blamed for starving Britain’s public services, including the crisis-ridden National Health Service, which has helped drag down the popularity of Mr. Sunak’s government.\n\nMr. Cameron’s victory in 2010, forming a coalition government with the centrist Liberal Democrats, inaugurated a long era of Conservative government. Though Mr. Sunak has at times embraced that legacy, in particular with his emphasis on fiscal responsibility, he has also appeared to be running in opposition to it.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
