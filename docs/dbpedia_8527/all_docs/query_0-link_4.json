This must-attend event, designed on the theme \"Leading with GRC,\" will feature speakers and sessions that will address today's most pressing economic and geopolitical issues including Brexit and political instability, increasingly sophisticated hacks and data breaches, evolving risks and compliance requirements, mounting terrorist threats, and economic turmoil. Business and government leaders will meet at the GRC Summit in London to discuss the strategies and solutions needed to build better governed, more risk-aware, and compliant organizations.\n\nAt the GRC Summit in London, Mr. Oliver will recount his experience as Former Prime Minister Cameron's Director of Politics and Communications, where he was responsible for setting the Government's strategy and message. During his keynote speech, he will share the inside story and lessons learned during the EU referendum campaign, drawing from his interactions with key government leaders including David Cameron, George Osborne, Barack Obama, Angela Merkel, Jeremy Corbyn, Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Theresa May and Peter Mandelson.\n\nOliver has a wide range of experience, from helping run a successful General Election campaign, to communicating complex domestic and foreign policy issues, as well as helping the Government navigate its way through a series of crises. During the EU referendum, Oliver acted as the Director of Politics and Communications for the campaign to keep Britain in the European Union. Before entering government, Mr. Oliver had a successful career in broadcast journalism where he served as the Editor of the BBC's main news programmes before becoming Controller of the BBC World Service.\n\nMetricStream CEO Shellye Archambeau said, \"We look forward to welcoming Craig Oliver as our distinguished keynote speaker at the GRC Summit in London.\" She continued, \"Right now, business and government leaders around the world are squarely focused on understanding the short and long-term social and economic implications of Brexit.
