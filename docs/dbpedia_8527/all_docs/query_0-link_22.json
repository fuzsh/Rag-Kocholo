I saw it as something to be slogged through. I’d had all-consuming jobs for years. My system was constantly flooded with adrenaline.\n\n“I’d always believed if I just worked hard, I’d be happy, but although on the outside I seemed fine, inside the pressure was building and cracks were appearing. It was like just before a dam bursts.”"
