        "text": "A podcast for those of us who want a simpler, more fulfilled life, but haven't quite got there yet...\n\nThis is a podcast where well-known people talk about what they’ve learned from life - particularly the tough times. Guests have come from the worlds of entertainment, politics, business and journalism, including: Richard Curtis, George Alagiah, Amber Rudd, the Rev. Richard Coles, Lyse Doucet and David Baddiel. It’s a chance to hear their wisdom - and to think about how it might apply to your life…\n\nAfter the Brexit vote, Craig Oliver's high-powered job and privileged position at the heart of the British government came to an abrupt end.\n\nIn the aftermath of that bruising battle, he despaired at how divided society had become, but also came to realise something fundamental was missing from his own life. Outwardly he was still achieving; but he realised he'd never felt comfortable in his own skin.\n\nLife had always felt more of a grind than a gift – he'd always believed that if he only worked harder, he'd find fulfilment. Now he realised that wasn't the case. Like many others, he asked himself why he'd always had a constant feeling of unease and discontent?\n\nHe wondered what wise people had to say about how we can live better. Craig decided to try a different path to the one he'd travelled before, reading and listening to many people. Some had little to offer, but he found many revelatory.\n\nThroughout this podcast series, Craig talks to some extraordinary people about the wisdom they've been able to take from the ups and downs of life - including traumas and triumphs - and finds out what they believe will help others gain peace of mind and heart.\n\nAbout Craig Oliver\n\nCraig Oliver spent the first part of his career as a broadcast journalist - editing ITV, Channel 4 and the BBC’s flagship news programmes, including the News at Six and Ten. He won numerous awards for the coverage of stories ranging from the death of Princess Diana to the aftermath of 9/11 and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAfter a brief stint as Controller of BBC Global, he was asked by David Cameron to become his Director of Politics and Communications. He spent nearly six years at the heart of Downing Street, which included the 2015 General Election and three referendums. His best-selling book, Unleashing Demons, about the bitter Brexit campaign was adapted into the film, Brexit: The Uncivil War, in which Craig was played by Rory Kinnear.\n\nHe currently advises some of the biggest businesses in the world on how they navigate an increasingly tumultuous environment. He has three daughters and lives in West London."
