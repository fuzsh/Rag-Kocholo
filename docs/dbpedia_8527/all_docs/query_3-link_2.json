        "text": "LONDON — It wasn’t quite the interview — or the story — I’d envisaged. On a sweltering weekday afternoon in July, I was speaking over the phone to Craig Oliver while he was driving in London, and his mind was obviously elsewhere. David Cameron’s former communications director was dropping his pet cat at a sitter before he took his kids on holiday to a remote part of Italy. At least, I think that’s what he was doing — the line wasn’t great, and we were talking over the sound of a sat-nav giving directions in the background.\n\nFor the past few months I’d been working on a profile of Cameron’s messaging maestro. Oliver, 47, a former senior BBC editor, spent six years in Downing Street overseeing how Cameron was presented, defining the way the government communicated its policy agenda, and commanding its forces in a brutal day-to-day media “air war.” When Cameron needed a trusted ally to oversee the campaign to keep Britain in the European Union, it was Oliver to whom he tossed the ball.\n\nBut now, everything had changed. The story I’d hoped to get — Cameron’s government seen through the eyes of an important but low-profile insider, at the peak of their power — fell apart when the U.K. voted for Brexit on June 23. Suddenly, Oliver was out of government, just another unemployed political operative trying to figure out his next career move. Who would care what he had to say now?\n\nActually, I still did. Oliver had been one of a handful of people closest to Cameron, he’d spent more than a decade at the intersection of British media and politics, and he’d been at the heart of the historic referendum campaign. Even if he was no longer a player, an interview with Oliver promised a post-mortem of the biggest political event in a generation. I expected insights into the missteps and miscalculations that led to the U.K. leaving the EU and to Cameron’s resignation. Oliver’s thoughts would be, I hoped, revealing, raw, and still relevant.\n\n“Part of me is waiting for the moment when you suddenly feel utterly bereft” — Craig Oliver\n\nBut instead of a long, searching face-to-face final interview, I had to settle for a phone conversation while Oliver ran last-minute errands before going on vacation.\n\nWorse, he was stonewalling.\n\n“Part of me is waiting for the moment when you suddenly feel utterly bereft,” Oliver said when I asked how it felt to find yourself abruptly ejected from power. “I was sad to leave Downing Street. I was sad to lose the referendum. But I don’t feel like my life has been blighted. I feel like there’s a new chapter starting.”\n\nThat was as close as he got to self-examination. In a conversation lasting about 50 minutes — with a 15-minute break while he took the cat inside — Oliver danced around questions about why the Remain campaign failed so spectacularly. He declined to comment on Prime Minister Theresa May’s new government. He gave me a few insights about what it was like to deal with a hostile press, cited one or two policy achievements that he was proud of. But mostly, he seemed surprisingly sanguine about everything that had just happened.\n\nIf Oliver had spent the last month beating himself up about where it all went wrong, he wasn’t showing it. The spin doctor was still spinning.\n\n* * *\n\nMy first interview with Oliver took place in what now seemed like a different era. We met in Number 10 on a Friday morning at the end of May. His office was roomy, wood-paneled, with a fireplace, dining table, several sofas and a view into the picturesque back garden where Cameron sometimes hosted functions.\n\nIt was just under a month before the referendum, and the first day of purdah, when civil servants and government departments were barred from campaigning. Cameron had tapped Oliver to move across to “Britain Stronger In Europe,” the official Remain campaign, formalizing a strategic role he had played for months.\n\nOur conversation was cordial. He came over as smart, composed, purposeful. He wasn’t self-critical, but nor was he boastful or pompous.\n\nWonkishly, I was interested in how the government tries to manipulate media coverage, to control the “narrative,” in the face of a fragmenting, fiercely competitive media at a time of dizzying technological change — when the next PR crisis can emerge, as Oliver put it, in “the time it takes somebody to type out a tweet.”\n\nOliver compared his role to that of the coach of a Champions League-caliber soccer team. Sometimes, in the daily cut-and-thrust of Westminster, politicians and journalists can be like children running headlong after the ball in one messy scramble. “Actually, the job is to stay in formation,” Oliver said.\n\n“He’s made it clear he doesn’t give a s*** about us, so I don’t really give a s*** about him” — veteran political correspondent at a major newspaper\n\nI roughly knew Oliver’s back story: Born in Nottingham in 1969. Grew up in Scotland. Father Ian was chief constable of a major Scottish regional police force. Three daughters by his ex-wife, the BBC News presenter Joanna Gosling. He went to a state school, then studied English literature at St Andrew’s University in Fife. He did a journalism diploma at Cardiff University, then started a career in broadcasting as a junior reporter at a small Scottish TV station in 1992.\n\nBy his early 30s, Oliver was a senior executive at ITV News, overseeing bulletins watched by millions of people a night. In 2006, the BBC poached Oliver to edit the News at Ten, where he was credited with bringing sharper editorial focus and increasing ratings. “He was undoubtedly the best editor I ever worked for,” John Simpson, the BBC’s World Affairs Editor, and a friend of Oliver’s, told me.\n\nThen came the jump to Downing Street, which took colleagues by surprise. Oliver replaced Andy Coulson, the formidable former News of the World editor who would later be convicted of conspiracy to hack phones. Tory MPs and government aides wondered whether the new communications chief had the nous or the street smarts for the cut-and-thrust of Westminster politics. Journalists in the press pack also regarded the new man warily. In his first few weeks on the job, Oliver was mocked by the tabloids for wearing garish white Beats headphones into Number 10, and for missing Cameron’s motorcade one morning.\n\n“There’s a sense of being blooded when you start the job,” Oliver told me. “It felt to me like I was plucked from the river banks and thrown into the whitewater rapids. I might have bashed my head on the rocks and drown or I might have survived.”\n\nHe quickly recovered from those early wobbles, and his influence in Cameron’s administration quietly grew. He became one of the four or five closest advisers to the prime minister, and was closely involved in two of Cameron’s biggest triumphs: the 2014 Scottish independence vote and the 2015 general election.\n\nFor the most part, he ran a disciplined media operation. Newspapers complained that Oliver put too much emphasis on getting favorable coverage from broadcasters, but on that, like much else, his views were simpatico with those of his boss. Oliver weaned the government press machine off a habit of seeking a quick “sugar hit” from giving scoops to newspapers in return for favorable coverage and drastically increased its use of social media, sometimes using Twitter to announce news instead of briefing it first to journalists.\n\nIn the Westminster press corps, journalists grudgingly admitted that he had been an effective gatekeeper, though Oliver still had plenty of critics. “He’s made it clear he doesn’t give a s*** about us, so I don’t really give a s*** about him,” a veteran political correspondent at a major newspaper said.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen I met Oliver again, on the second Friday in June, the race was already slipping away. With only weeks to go, polls now predicted a 50/50 chance of Brexit, and there was talk of panic in Downing Street.\n\nOliver was more tense. He wore a white shirt, no jacket or tie, grey trousers, black shoes, and plonked down in a sofa, placing his iPhone on the seat next to him so he could glance at it regularly.\n\nFrom the start, he told me, they’d tried to sell voters on two themes: One was a positive message, a case for the benefits of EU membership: “Stronger, Safer, Better off.” The other was negative: “Don’t risk it. Leaving the EU would be a leap in the dark.” Both, he said, were “very, very clear. Everybody can go out there and say it. And I think that we’re having real traction in the campaign.”\n\nThe truth, however, was that neither seemed to work. The economic warnings had been dismissed by many as scaremongering (“Project Fear”). The Leave campaign’s promise that Brexit would be a vote to “take back control” seemed to be gaining traction, and it had the full-throated support of most of the powerful conservative newspapers.\n\nThat week, one of Oliver’s trump cards had flopped. A senior MP, Sarah Wollaston, had defected from the Leave camp because of its dubious claim that leaving the EU would save £350 million a week that could be spent on the NHS. He had given the story to the Times, thinking it would lead their front page, but instead they buried it and splashed on a wealthy Tory donor endorsing Brexit (even though the Times ultimately endorsed Remain).\n\nOliver wasn’t worried. “I would agree with you [the Leave campaign] had a good few days on immigration,” Oliver said. But he cautioned me to be “wary of prevailing narratives,” and pointed to the run-up to the general election, when pollsters and pundits were adamant the Tories would lose.\n\n“Remember the kind of narrative that was,” Oliver said. “Labour have got a better ground war, a better ground campaign, everything’s going well and aren’t they doing brilliantly. Turned out not to be the case. They didn’t have a very good ground campaign. They weren’t having an impact.”\n\nI asked Oliver about the TV debates, his natural turf. I told him I didn’t think the previous night’s broadcast — a two-hour head-to-head on ITV, in which Boris Johnson led the Leave side — had gone that well. He disagreed. Not many people sat through the full broadcast, he said. What really mattered were the soundbites that would later lead TV bulletins and flitter through social media. “When you’re playing those debates, you need to think, ‘How is this clipping?’” Oliver said.\n\nHe was right, to an extent. On the 10 o’clock bulletins from the night of the debate, Remain supporters appeared to dominate. Their quips about Johnson’s ambitions of becoming prime minister featured more prominently than any of the Leave campaign’s arguments.\n\nThe trouble was, we would later discover, the attacks on Johnson didn’t really go down well with the public. Remainers came across as “too mean,” an adviser to the Leave campaign told me later. The clips just played to Leave’s argument that Remain was trying to keep voters scared.\n\nBefore I left, I asked Oliver if he thought they could lose the vote. “As you look at me today, do I think we have got a real challenge? Yes I do. We really have a real challenge. Do I think, you know, is there a possibility that [you’ll be] writing this article saying, you know, that it didn’t all work out?”\n\n“That’s a possibility,” he said.\n\n* * *\n\nFour weeks passed before I reached Oliver on the phone as he was getting ready to go on holiday. When polls closed on the night of June 23, Oliver and the rest of Cameron’s team had thought victory was in hand. But as results trickled in, the mood in Number 10 darkened. The next morning, Cameron resigned. A few weeks later, they were all out of power — replaced by a new administration.\n\nOn Cameron’s last day, Oliver and a few of his inner circle gathered in the prime minister’s private office to reminisce. Cameron’s wife, Samantha, and children were there, dressed up ready to go to Buckingham Palace, where Cameron would give the Queen his formal resignation. Number 10 had been cleaned and tidied, ready for the arrival of May’s people. Cameron left two bottles of red wine as a gift for his successor.\n\nAs they filed out to face the waiting press, Downing Street staff formed a guard of honor and Cameron went down the line giving high-fives. Outside, Oliver and other aides watched Cameron give his final speech as prime minister, then depart for the Palace. The aides left through a back entrance and headed to the Admiralty pub on Trafalgar Square.\n\n“Genuinely, I don’t think we would’ve run a different campaign” — Craig Oliver\n\nIn the post-match analysis of the Brexit result, critics had been scathing. Cameron was blamed for not doing enough in his time in office to improve the lives of poorer voters, and had been punished for it; or calling the referendum, putting the country’s future on the line to settle an internal party dispute; or not getting a better deal from European leaders in February, but naïvely thinking he could sell it to voters anyway; and for quitting right after the vote, without leaving a plan in place.\n\nOliver’s Remain campaign was blamed for being too negative, for not highlighting the benefits of the EU, for underestimating the depths of public concern about migration, for not uniting the various political parties, and for failing to counter a nimble, aggressive, motivated opponent.\n\nI wondered what Oliver’s own analysis was, now that he’d had a few weeks to ponder, and his answer perplexed me. “Genuinely, I don’t think we would’ve run a different campaign,” he said.\n\nThey’d had data, polling, past experience. All the experts, all the models, predicted that the economic consequences of Brexit would trump the public’s concerns about immigration. “Even right up to the last minute, most people, most pollsters, most people who’d modeled it — hedge funds, businesses — thought the Remain camp was going to win,” Oliver said.\n\nEven the Leave campaign thought voters would choose to stay. The other side didn’t have a “brilliant strategy,” either, Oliver said. He accused them of playing dirty, pushing discredited claims about Britain sending £350 million a week to the EU and Turkey being on the brink of joining the union. “We were up against a campaign that was prepared to mislead on an industrial scale,” Oliver said.\n\nI asked if Cameron was to blame, but Oliver wouldn’t entertain that, either. A showdown about Britain’s EU membership was a “slow train coming,” Oliver said, repeating a soundbite he’d used a few days earlier in an interview with the BBC. “The idea that there didn’t need to be a referendum is for the birds,” he told me.\n\nOliver refused to be dragged into a session of soul-searching. He had spent the weeks after leaving Number 10 lining up paid speeches, having exploratory conversations about a new job, and starting work on a book about the referendum campaign: “Unleashing Demons,” to be published by Hodder & Stoughton later this year. He was in line for a knighthood, a parting gift from his former boss — and he got one. He headed to Sicily, where he had rented a villa near Marsala on the west coast of the Mediterranean island.\n\nThere was one area where Oliver conceded the campaign had got it wrong, though he presented it more as an observation than a mea culpa. None of the experts the campaign employed foresaw that so many voters who are normally uninterested in politics would turn out to vote to give the political establishment a kicking. “Normally pollsters believe those people aren’t going to turn up, but they did in this case and nobody predicted that,” Oliver said.\n\nCameron’s administration had been accused of overlooking those left behind by globalization, the struggling classes who felt squeezed between what they saw as an uncaring elite and a growing population of immigrants they felt threatened their economic security and cultural values. The models on which Oliver had relied, on which the Remainers built their campaign, excluded those very people, and they handed them a crushing defeat."
