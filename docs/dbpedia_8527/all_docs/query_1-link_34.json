        "text": "As Second Gentleman of the United States, Mr. Emhoff is working to share the priorities of the Biden-Harris Administration with people across the country and around the world.\n\nMr. Emhoff has traveled to 42 states and fifteen countries. During his travels, he has met with community leaders, legal aid providers, health care professionals, parents, teachers, caregivers, small business owners, communities of color, and Tribal communities to hear their stories and to share how the Biden-Harris Administration is working to help their families. As the nation’s first Second Gentleman – married to the first woman vice president – Mr. Emhoff knows the power and importance of having women in leadership positions. He is a champion of gender equity and has seen what it means for young girls and boys to look up to Vice President Harris. Mr. Emhoff has also met with leaders across our nation and throughout the world to discuss the importance of equity in the workplace, equal pay, and access to reproductive health care.\n\nAs the first Jewish spouse of an American president or vice president, Mr. Emhoff is honored to share his Jewish heritage and culture with the nation – from celebrating Hanukkah in the White House to affixing Mezuzahs on the doorposts of the Vice President’s Residence. Mr. Emhoff is a leading voice on combating antisemitism and hatred wherever it exists. He has convened Jewish leaders at the White House to bring attention to the rise in antisemitism and helped spearhead the Administration’s first-ever National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism. He has also traveled the country and globe – including to Germany and Poland – to build coalitions focused on religious tolerance. He regularly engages with faith leaders and the Jewish community to discuss the Administration’s priorities to promote religious freedom.\n\nAs an attorney who practiced law for over 30 years, Mr. Emhoff cares deeply about justice and equality in our legal system. He is a dedicated advocate for access to legal aid and removing barriers – legal, social, and financial – to ensure every person can get the help they need in the justice system. In January 2020, Mr. Emhoff began teaching law courses at the Georgetown University Law Center and is enjoying the opportunity to mentor the next generation of lawyers.\n\nAdditionally, Mr. Emhoff has committed himself to raising awareness about mental health and loneliness. He has partnered with Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy at events across the country to uplift private and public sector programs that destigmatize mental health issues, provide mental health resources, and offer opportunities and support to those who need it in communities across America. Through his engagement and activism, the Second Gentleman is reminding all Americans – regardless of age, gender, or background – that it’s okay to talk about and address mental health challenges, including substance use disorders, openly and free of stigma.\n\nDouglas Emhoff was born in Brooklyn, New York. He was raised in Matawan, New Jersey by his parents, Mike and Barbara, with his siblings, Jamie and Andy. His family then moved to Los Angeles, California during his teen years. Mr. Emhoff earned a B.A. from California State University, Northridge and a J.D. from University of Southern California Gould School of Law. He and Vice President Harris have been married for almost ten years and are part of a modern blended family in which they proudly co-parent Cole and Ella Emhoff."
