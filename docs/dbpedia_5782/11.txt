Iban (formerly called Sea Dayak) is a Malayo-Polynesian language spoken by nearly 700,000 people in Sarawak (Malaysia), Brunei, and adjacent Indonesia. It is the most widely spoken indigenous language in Sarawak. It is closely related to Malay, the dominant language in Malaysia and Indonesia. As with most languages, Iban has a number of dialects; the texts given here should be understood by Iban speakers living in Malaysia, but possibly not by those living in Indonesia.

Portions of the Book of Common Prayer have been translated into Iban from the late 1800's and up to the present day. William Muss-Arnolt discusses earlier Anglican liturgical translations into Iban in Chapter XXXIX of The Book of Common Prayer among the Nations of the World (1914).

Two translations are presented here. The first is a fairly complete translation of the 1662 BCP, printed in 1914. It appears in David Griffiths' Bibliography of the Book of Common Prayer 1549-1999 as 28:3. We have the more important services as HTML text (see the Table of Contents below), plus the entire book as PDF graphics.
