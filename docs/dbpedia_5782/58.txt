A number of indigenous peoples of the island of Borneo are collectively known as the Dayak. They speak a variety of languages belonging to the Indonesian branch of the Austronesian language family.

Dayak (also spelled Dyak) is a general term that has no precise ethnic or tribal meaning. Especially in the Indonesian part of Borneo, it is applied to any of the non-Muslim indigenous peoples of the interior of the island (to distinguish them from the largely Malay population of the coast). In the Malaysian part of Borneo, the term Dayak is used less extensively. There, it is often understood to refer specifically to the Iban and Bidayuh peoples. The most prominent of the Dayak groups are the Kayan, Kenyah, Ngaju, Bidayuh, and Iban.

Most of the Dayak traditionally lived along the banks of rivers. Their communities, seldom with more than a few hundred members, consisted of one or more longhouses. These dwellings were divided into apartments that could house as many as 100 families. The Dayak lived by growing rice for their own use and by fishing and hunting. By the early 21st century some Dayak had given up their longhouses for separate family houses. Others had left their rural villages altogether for towns and cities along the coast. Rural Dayak, however, have typically continued their traditional subsistence lifestyle.

Among the Iban and Bidayuh, there have never been any formal class distinctions. The Kayan and Kenyah, by contrast, traditionally recognized three main social classes. The upper class was made up of the family and near relatives of the village chiefs. The middle class consisted of common villagers. The lower class included captives of war and other persons looked down upon for various reasons. While still recognized by many older villagers today, class distinctions have lost much of their meaning for the younger generation.
