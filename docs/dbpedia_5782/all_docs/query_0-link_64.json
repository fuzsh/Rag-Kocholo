        "text": "Summary:The indigenous people of the Dayak Iban tribe of Kapuas Hulu have felt uneasy about the state of the environment due to unusual weather changes. The Iban Dayak tribe responds to this anxiety through a spiritual ritual called the ritual of minta’ ‘ari’. This ritual is their request to the universe to cease bad weather changes such as floods and continuous rain. Researchers obtained data through the social media of the Dayak Iban Sungai Utik tribe, which displayed the ritual of minta’ ‘ari’. Their responses to climate change are generally based on ecocentrism: the belief that climate change is an ecological disaster caused by humans and advances in the era of modern technology, that deviates from a respectful relationship between humans and nature. In response, the indigenous people of the Iban Dayak tribe took on the responsibility of performing minta’ ‘ari’ and reclaiming the relationship between humans and nature to deal with climate change."
