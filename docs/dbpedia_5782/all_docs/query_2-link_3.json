        "text": "Ethnic and Linguistic Diversity\n\nMalaysia’s constitution recognizes Standard Malay as the official language. Teachers use it as the language of instruction at national primary schools, while secondary schools use Mandarin and Tamil.\n\nThe application of three different languages in educational settings results from Malaysia’s multi-ethnic society. Malays account for about 50% of the population, Chinese for nearly 24%, and Indians for over 7%. The United Nations hails Malaysia as a success in maintaining a harmonious balance between different ethnic groups, and respect for all languages has played a significant role in that.\n\nDo you want to learn more about languages? Visit our YouTube channel or check out this video that we've made for you:\n\nWhat Language Do Malaysians Speak?\n\nMy Malaysian language overview must, of course, mention imported languages.\n\nMalay – Malaysia’s Official Language\n\nMany locals refer to Malaysia’s national language as “Bahasa Malaysia” (the language of Malaysia), “Bahasa Melayu” (the language of the Malay), or simply “Malaysian.”\n\nMalay leads all other Malaysian languages with around 19.6 million speakers or 58.4% of the country’s population. Millions of people speak Malay outside of Malaysia, too. When you add up the Malay speakers in Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, and elsewhere, it totals over 290 million people.\n\nMalay has 10 dialects, only some of which are spoken in Malaysia. They include Kelantanese, Terengganu, Kedah, Sarawak, and Perak Malay.\n\nEnglish\n\nMany Malaysians speak English as a second language due to the country’s colonial history and the role of English in international business. Sarawak (a Malaysian state on Borneo) has designated English as an official language alongside Malay.\n\nMalaysian English sees use in business and official settings as limited and defined by the National Language Act 1967.\n\nTamil\n\nOver 1.8 million Tamil speakers live in Malaysia, mostly in Peninsular Malaysia. Locals speak several Tamil dialects, reflecting historic immigration patterns and modern socioeconomic dynamics.\n\nOther Indian languages in Malaysia include Gujarati, Hindi, Bengali, Malayalam, Punjabi, Telugu, and Urdu.\n\nChinese\n\nTeachers use Mandarin to educate children in Chinese schools in Malaysia. However, some Chinese Malaysians also speak Hokkien, Hakka, Cantonese, Teochew, and more.\n\nYou will find around 1.9 million Hokkien, 1.7 million Hakka, 1.4 million Cantonese, 1 million Teochew, and 1 million Mandarin speakers in Malaysia. Foochow, Hainanese, and Min Bei have a few hundred thousand speakers each.\n\nRead more: Examine Chinese Languages and Their Importance\n\nRegional Languages of Malaysia – What Is Spoken Where?\n\nMalaysia is split down the middle by the South China Sea, dividing the country into two regions: Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo. It also shares borders with Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, and Indonesia. Multiple shared boundaries and geographical divisions encouraged rich language diversity.\n\nHave you seen my post on the languages of Indonesia? If not, you can access it by clicking the link below.\n\nRead more: Indonesian Language Snapshot\n\nThe Languages of Peninsular Malaysia\n\nThe languages spoken in Peninsular Malaysia are split into Malayic languages and Aslian languages, with a few exceptions. Let’s survey the most commonly spoken languages in Peninsular Malaysia besides Standard Malay.\n\nKedah Malay\n\nMainly spoken in northwestern Malaysia, Kedah Malay has around 2.6 million native speakers, including some in Thailand. It gave rise to several subdialects, such as Kedah Utara, Perlis-Langkawi, and Penang.\n\nKelantanese Malay\n\nAlso known as Kelantan-Pattani Malay, Kelantanese Malay has around 2 million native speakers in Malaysia and 3 million in Thailand. Geographically isolated from the rest of Peninsular Malaysia by mountains and rainforests, the Kelantanese people speak a distinct form of Malay.\n\nPerak Malay\n\nWith around 1.4 million speakers, Perak Malay represents one of the most commonly spoken Malay dialects. It contributes to the identity of Perak state residents. Perak Malay has two sub dialects: Kuala Kangsar and Perak Tengah.\n\nTerengganu Malay\n\nTerengganu state locals speak Terengganu Malay as a lingua franca for multiple ethnic groups. It is mutually intelligible with Kelantan-Pattani and Pahang Malay. Total speakers number well over 1 million.\n\nNegeri Sembilan Malay\n\nPeople in Negeri Sembilan and Alor Gajah speak this form of Malay. Many scholars consider Negeri Sembilan Malay a dialect or variant of Minangkabau. Native speakers number around 500,000. For an in-depth discussion of the difference between a dialect and a language, click the link below.\n\nRead more: What Is the Difference Between a Language and a Dialect?\n\nSouthern Thai\n\nWidely spoken in southern regions of Thailand, Southern Thai also has a few clusters of speakers in northern Malaysia. Around 70,000 of its five million speakers live in Malaysia, where locals refer to it as Pak Thai or Dambro.\n\nSemai\n\nNative to western Malaysia, Semai has around 44,000 speakers. Of Malaysia’s many Aslian languages, only Semai remains unendangered. About 2,000 Semai speakers use it exclusively.\n\nJakun\n\nConsidered a dialect of Malay by some and a separate language by others, Jakun has around 28,000 speakers. Most of them live on the eastern coast of Peninsular Malaysia and further inland.\n\nOther Peninsular Malaysian Languages\n\nPeninsular Malaysia has bred many other native languages, including Temuan, Temiar, Baba Malay, Jah Hut, Semelai, Duano’, Mah Meri, Kristang, Semaq Beri, Orang Seletar, Batek, Jahai, Semnam, Cheq Wong, Ten’edn/Mos, Chitty Malay, Jedek, Minriq, Kensiu, Lanoh, Mintil, Kintaq, and Orang Kanaq.\n\nMalaysian Borneo – Language List\n\nMalaysian Borneo preserves many languages from the North Bornean, Land Dayak, Melanau-Kajang, Kayan-Murik, Sama-Bajaw, Malayic, and Philippine branches of the Austronesian language family tree. The number of North Bornean speakers outstrips all others, however. Let’s take a quick look at some of Malaysian Borneo’s languages.\n\nIban\n\nWith around 790,000 native speakers and a further 700,000 second-language speakers, Iban remains an essential, native Malaysian language. Most people who speak Iban live in Sarawak.\n\nSarawak Malay\n\nSpeaking of Sarawak, the state is home to around 600,000 speakers of Sarawak Malay. Linguists debate whether they should consider Sarawak Malay a language or a local vernacular of Malay. However, speakers of Standard Malay often can not understand Sarawak Malay.\n\nBajaw\n\nUsed by people in the Malaysian states of Sabah, Labuan, and Sarawak, Bajaw has more than 430,000 speakers.\n\nSuluk\n\nA language originating from the Philippines (known as Tausug) spoken by more than 205,000 people in eastern Sabah. The use of Suluk in this region is attributed to trade and migration.\n\nDusun\n\nAlso known as Bunduliwan, Dusun has around 140,000 speakers in Malaysian Borneo.\n\nMelanau\n\nMelanau has around 110,000 native speakers; most live in Malaysian Borneo’s Sarawak state.\n\nOther Languages from Malaysian Borneo\n\nYou will find many languages in Malaysian Borneo with less than 100,000 speakers, including Lelak, Seru, Bukitan, Tringgus, Iban, Sekapan, Sarawak Malay, Tutoh, Tring, Kajaman, Papar, Sungai, Bajaw, Lahanan, Serudung, Sugut Dusun, Tausug, Kanowit, Central Dusun, Ukit, Melanau, Sama, Biatah, Brunei Bisaya, Coastal Kadazan, Rungus, Mainstream Kenyah, Tagol, Sian, Bukar Sadong, Jangkang, Dusun, Punan Batu, Jagoi, Iranun, Sabah Bisaya, Tatana', Eastern Kadazan, Lotud, Nonukan Tidong, Bahau, Lun Bawang, Kayan, Penan, Tombonuwo, Ida'an, Kinabatangan, Lundayeh, Sebuyau, Timugon, Kuijau, Daro-Matu, Keningau Murut, Molbog, Uma' Lasan, Kelabit, Paluan, Cocos Malay, Okolod, Bintulu, Berawan, Remun, Lengilu, Kiput, Narom, Kalabakan, Minokok, Sa'ban, Sembakung, Kota Marudu Talantang, Sebop, Bookan, Bonggi, Selungai Murut, Murik Kayan, Dumpas, Gana', Klias River Kadazan, Abai, Belait, Brunei Malay, Kendayan, Kimaragang, Maranao, and Sabah Malay.\n\nOther Native Malaysian Languages\n\nMinangkabau is spoken by around 930,000 inhabitants, Javanese by more than 660,000, and Buginese by roughly 143,000. You can also hear Acehnese, Banjarese, Cham, Kerincini, and Mandailing as you travel around Malaysia.\n\nCreoles\n\nSeveral creole languages thrive in Malaysia, including:\n\n• Kristang – Based on Portuguese Language\n\n• Chavacano – Spanish-based creole derived from native speakers from Southern Philippines\n\n• Manglish – English-based creole, rich with Malay, Tamil, and Chinese influences\n\nDo you have an interest in creoles? Explore these fascinating linguistic blends in more detail by clicking the link below.\n\nRead more: Creole Languages\n\nExtinct Malaysian Languages\n\nThe promotion of a national language can lead to unintended consequences. Due to the extensive use of Malay and English in Malaysia, some indigenous tongues have dwindled to unsustainable levels or disappeared entirely, including Kenaboi, Sabüm, and Wila’.\n\nSome of the indigenous languages under threat include Orang Kanaq with 80 speakers, Kintaq with 110, Mintil with 180, Lanoh with 240, and Lengilu with four.\n\nWrap Up\n\nOverutilization of Malay and Malaysian English in Malaysia promotes the loss of native tongues. In some cases, the best we can do involves recording the endangered languages before they are gone for good. To continue your study of the languages of Asia, click the link below."
