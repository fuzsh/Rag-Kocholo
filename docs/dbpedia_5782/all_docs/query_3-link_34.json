        "text": "Malay (Bahasa Melayu) is a member of the Malayic subgroup of the Austronesian language family. This subgroup includes languages like Gayo in Sumatra (Eades & Hajek Reference Eades and Hajek2006), Minangkabau in Sumatra, and Iban in Borneo, as well as many local dialects of Malay found in Borneo, Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia, and eastern Indonesia (Adelaar Reference Adelaar2005).\n\nClosely related varieties of Malay have national language status in Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore, where it is referred to as Standard Malay (Bahasa Melayu Baku, Bahasa Baku), and in Indonesia, where it is called Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia) (Soderberg & Olson Reference Soderberg and Olson2008). There is a high degree of mutual intelligibility between all these standard varieties, which are said to derive from the Malay of Johor in Peninsular Malaysia (Steinhauer Reference Steinhauer2005).\n\nIndonesian is the most divergent of these standard Malays in its lexis, due to extensive influence from languages like Dutch and Javanese, while phonetically and phonologically the most divergent are probably the varieties spoken in much of Peninsular Malaysia. The Standard Malay spoken in Brunei seems to be in an intermediary position, in many ways similar to Indonesian in its pronunciation and grammar, but more like Peninsular varieties in its lexis (Poedjosoedarmo Reference Poedjosoedarmo1996).\n\nOne important reason for variation is that, for most speakers, Standard Malay is a second language or dialect, existing in a diglossic relationship with a local variety. That local variety can be a distinct language, or it can be a local dialect of Malay which, as with Brunei Malay, can diverge greatly from Standard Malay in many respects.\n\nThe local varieties naturally differ quite substantially phonetically and phonologically from Standard Malay, and these differences influence the varieties of Standard Malay that are spoken in each place. In Malaysia this has given rise to two groups of standard varieties, which can be termed the ‘a-varieties’ and the ‘schwa varieties’, as they differ in the realisation of word-final orthographic 〈a〉 (pronounced as either /a/ or /ə/) in addition to a range of other features (Asmah Haji Omar Reference Omar1977). Pronunciation of Indonesian also varies considerably depending on the first language of the speaker, as van Zanten (Reference van Zanten1986) and van Zanten, Goedemans & Pacilly (Reference van Zanten, Goedemans, Pacilly, van de Weijer, van Heuven and van der Hulst2003) have demonstrated.\n\nIn Brunei, the pronunciation of Standard Malay similarly reflects influences from Brunei Malay (Dialek Melayu Brunei), the dominant vernacular variety of Malay in the country. Brunei Malay differs markedly from Standard Malay in its phonology, grammar, and lexis (Clynes Reference Clynes2001, Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka Reference dan Pustaka2007), to the extent that some might regard it as a separate language (Martin Reference Martin1996). One major difference in the phonology involves the vowels: Brunei Malay has only three vowels, /i a u/, rather than the six vowels of Standard Malay, so for example perang /pəraŋ/ ‘war’ in Standard Malay is parang /paraŋ/ in Brunei Malay; and orang /oraŋ/ ‘person’ in Standard Malay is urang /uraŋ/ in Brunei Malay.\n\nVariables such as age, gender, level of education, and profession naturally give rise to further sociolects in the Standard Malay of Brunei. Poedjosoedarmo (Reference Poedjosoedarmo1996: 38) contrasts the formal speech of government officials, which she describes as having the ‘staccato syllable-timed rhythm of Standard Indonesian’, with the stress-timed speech of newsreaders. Still, the Standard Malay of all formal genres in Brunei shows the least divergence from other varieties of Standard Malay, while that used in less formal contexts (such as in the radio patter of disc jockeys, or the speech of teachers in classrooms) at times diverges quite radically.\n\nTypically, communities in which Standard Malay is used are multilingual and multiglossic (Sneddon Reference Sneddon2003). In Brunei, while Standard Malay dominates in the domains of education and administration, in informal contexts Brunei Malay is strongly preferred, often with a considerable amount of code-mixing. The overall mix is further complicated by influences from other Malay varieties, from TV, films, radio and the Internet, so that many Bruneians are at least passively multi-dialectal, often understanding even the informal registers of Indonesian and Malaysian films and TV dramas. Finally, in a country where education is bilingual in Standard Malay and English, with English dominating from the fourth year of primary school, English increasingly constitutes a rival code in high diglossic contexts and even, for some speakers, in low diglossic contexts. As a result, English has influenced the syntax, lexis, phonetics, and phonology of both Standard Malay in Brunei (Poedjsoedarmo Reference Poedjosoedarmo1996) and Brunei Malay (Maxwell Reference Maxwell1990).\n\nAll these influences can be found in the recordings described here. The reader is a university tutor in Malay and also a part-time professional newsreader. She is aged 26 years and has been educated in both Brunei and England. The formal style she uses shows phonological influences from Peninsular Malaysia (e.g. the use of glottal stop) and also apparently from English (e.g. aspiration of voiceless plosives and the pronunciation of the affricates). However, the level of influence from Brunei Malay is surprisingly low. This no doubt reflects genre expectations on the part of the speaker – that she should use her best ‘newscaster’ style in the formal context of recording a written text."
