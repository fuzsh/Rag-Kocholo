        "text": "Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia)\n\nIndonesian, an Austronesian language, is a standardized form of Malay and is spoken throughout Indonesia. About 30 million people speak Indonesian as their first language and a further 140 million speak it as a second language. Indonesia is a linguistically diverse region where the Indonesian language acts as a lingua franca, even though there are more native speakers of Javanese - about 75 million.\n\nIn the 1930s, as part of the independence movement, the Indonesian language was standardised and the term Bahasa Indonesia was adopted as the name of the language.\n\nWritten Indonesian\n\nDuring the time Indonesia was a Dutch colony, the Latin alphabet was introduced to write Indonesian and a number of Dutch spellings were used. This alphabet was called ejaan lama (Old Script) in Indonesian.\n\nIn 1947 the spelling of oe was changed to u. Then in 1972 a set of official changes to the Indonesian spelling system were introduced by former president Soeharto. The major changes included changing ch to kh, dj to j, j to y, nj to ny, sj to sy, and tj to c.\n\nIn Muslim communities in Indonesia the Jawi alphabet, a version of the Arabic alphabet, is sometimes used to write Indondesian.\n\nIndonesian alphabet (Alfabet bahasa Indonesia)\n\nA recording of the Indonesian alphabet by Pangus Ho\n\nHear the Indonesian alphabet, with example words:\n\nIndonesian pronunciation (Cara Pengucapan)\n\nDownload an Indonesian (and Malay) pronunciation chart (Excel)\n\nNotes\n\nThere are four digraphs: ng (eng), ny (nye), kh (kha) and sy (sya). The final two only appear in words of Arabic origin.\n\nThe vowels e and o are pronounced [ɛ] and [ɔ] in closed final syllables.\n\nai and au are pronounced [aɪ̯] and [aʊ̯] in final position and as separated vowels, [a.i] and [a.u], elsewhere.\n\nThe letters q, v, x, and z are used in loanwords from Europe and India.\n\nSource: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Indonesian/Lessons/Alphabet\n\nSample text\n\nSemua orang dilahirkan merdeka dan mempunyai martabat dan hak-hak yang sama. Mereka dikaruniai akal dan hati nurani dan hendaknya bergaul satu sama lain dalam semangat persaudaraan.\n\nA recording of this text by Ali Aulia Ghozali\n\nTranslation\n\nAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\n\n(Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights)\n\nSample videos in Indonesian\n\nInformation about Indonesian | Phrases | Numbers | Family words | Tower of Babel | Articles | Learning materials\n\nLinks\n\nInformation about Indonesian\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language\n\nhttps://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfabet_bahasa_Indonesia\n\nOnline Indonesian lessons\n\nhttp://www.seasite.niu.edu/Indonesian\n\nhttp://indonesianlanguage.net/learn-indonesian1\n\nhttp://langhub.com\n\nhttp://www.indonesianpod101.com/\n\nIndonesian phrases\n\nhttp://www.expat.or.id/info/bahasa.html\n\nhttp://www.seasite.niu.edu/indonesian/percakapan/indonesia7days/indo7days_fs.htm\n\nhttp://www.indonesian-easy.com\n\nOnline Indonesian dictionaries\n\nhttp://www.freedict.com/onldict/ind.html\n\nhttp://vvv.sederet.com\n\nhttp://indodic.com\n\nPenerjemah Bahasa Indonesia - Inggris (Indonesian - English Translator)\n\nhttps://indolang.com/\n\nRirio - folk tales and children's stories in Indonesian with recordings\n\nhttps://ririro.com/id/\n\nMalayo-Polynesian languages\n\nAlorese, Ambai, Ambel, Anuki, Balinese, Bambam, Banjarese, Batuley, Bengkulu, Biak, Bima, Bugis, Bushi, Chamorro, Duri, Fijian, Fordata, Gayo, Iban, Indonesian, Javanese, Kei, Kerinci, Komering, Lamaholot, Lampung, Ledo Kaili, Madurese, Makasarese, Malagasy, Malay, Mamasa, Mandar, Mandar, Mbula, Mentawai, Minangkabau, Mualang, Musi, Ngaju, Nias, Ogan, Palauan, Sasak, Selaru, Sumbawa, Sundanese, Toqabaqita, Toraja-Sa'dan, Ulumandaʼ, Urak Lawoi’, Wamesa, Yamdena\n\nLanguages written with the Latin alphabet\n\nPage last modified: 29.05.23\n\n[top]\n\nWhy not share this page:\n\nIf you like this site and find it useful, you can support it by making a donation via PayPal or Patreon, or by contributing in other ways.
