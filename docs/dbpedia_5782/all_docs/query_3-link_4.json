It helps people express their beliefs, values, and how they interact with each other.\n\nFor example, during religious ceremonies, like the “Muspa” (means praying), “Base Bali” is used to connect people with their spiritual heritage.\n\nThe local language is also used to keep stories and wisdom from the past alive.\n\nBy telling stories and passing down traditions in Basa Bali, communities can keep their culture strong.\n\nLanguage is also useful for everyday life on the island.
