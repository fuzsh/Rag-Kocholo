        "text": "Thriving in the Unknown: How adaptability fueled my Creative Strategy journey! My formative years (10-13) were a masterclass in cultural immersion. Home was in Cambodia (Phnom Phen, & Battambong) & in Thailand (Chiang Mai). A British school with its self-directed learning â€“ a stark contrast to my teacher-led background (India). Individuals and teachers from various cultures challenged me to understand as well as appreciate cultural differences. The same school also, ignited my passion for basketball (who knew a hoop was a universal language?), and fostered connections with those who now are creative powerhouses in Thailand & Poland! The 6 gulps back in time with this Katring Deang, lead to a crucial question: How can we empower young minds to thrive in a world demanding adaptability? As a creative strategist in today's time, I believe empathy and self-directed learning are one of the key cornerstones of success. Hope to continue to cultivating confident, culturally-aware individuals who can navigate complexity with kindness. Now, can we have volunteers to share a story of overcoming a cultural barrier and the creative solution it sparked. Tagging you all below, because I believe you all bring great learnings to the table, that lot many of us can learn from & certainly not to waste any of your valuable time. Roma Maheshwari Abhijat Bharadwaj Faizan Babi Sabiha NS Khan Let's challenge the status quo! #multicultural #creativestrategy #selfdirectedlearning #KratingDaeng #learnings #content Kratingdaeng Red Bull\n\nDear Indonesians, Iâ€™m wondering how and who has planned and designed our curriculum since beginning. Does it curriculum teach the students to be employee? Does it design to not become an entrepreneur and opening job opportunities. I do believe that not everyone wants to become an entrepreneur. Sometimes they just want to responsible for specific tasks and responsibilities. But, this is not a choice for them even not an option. Theyâ€™re starving for a job because theyâ€™re in need of financial support. Who has created our Human Resources to be clueless as they are now. I found out my Indonesian connection are jobless for 1-2-3-4-5-6 years. How could they improve their quality of life even to fulfil their primary needs they canâ€™t afford it. I donâ€™t blame them to not try from entrepreneurship path. But they just donâ€™t have the skills and ability to cross those ways. They donâ€™t have enough mindset to be one since their curriculum design is to be an employee. How hard they improve their resume & portfolio. If there always be someone better for them. They wouldnâ€™t be able to afford for the job. The supply and demand isnâ€™t balance. Weâ€™re not talking about their dream job or their dream company yet. Theyâ€™re in the stage of financial support needed. I hope our economic activities are doing better everyday. #humanresources #indonesians #employee #entrepreneurship\n\nFrom 1st to 5th October, I went to a few states in West Malaysia for a benchmark visit. This is for the community development project that I'm currently involved with Institute of Development Studies (Sabah). The purpose of this visit is to get some insight from the people and locals who have involved with community development projects as well to explore the concept; whether it can be applied for the community that I'm currently working with. 7 of us, travelling to Arau then to Tanjung Dawai, down to Batu Maung, Penang and to Ipoh, Perak and Selangor Food Valley. Our final pitstop was UiTM Shah Alam whereby we've met with Sr Dr Ismail Maarof, the only Sabahan who holds the fellowship at Institut Pemikiran dan Kepimpinan Melayu, UiTM Shah Alam. We've shared ideas and thoughts on how we can develop further the community in Sabah based on their history and culture. A few things that I've learned during this trip: I. Leaders play an important role in developing and improving his community. - we can have hundreds and thousands more development plan for the community but if their leader doesn't do anything, it'll only remain just a plan. II. Culture can unite people. - Malaysia, blessed with its rich and diverse culture is indeed a blessing for Malaysian. In Borneo itself, we have more than 30 different ethics comprises of Kadazan, Iban, Dusun, Murut, Melanau and Bajau to name a few. Through this diverse culture, it becomes an identity that we Malaysian should be proud of. It is a powerful tools to connect and unite the community. III. Our infrastructure still need to improve. - When I visited the Northern part of Malaysia, which Perlis, I can see that their 'kampung' is well-equipped; they have accessible road, clean water is available in every household and each district has clinics and schools. I was thinking during that time that we can't deny that infrastructure plays an important role for any community to develop. As a Sarawakian living in Sabah, I do hope that Sabah one day can progress the same like her neighbours Sarawak. It has been 60th years since we joined the Federation of Malaysia and gained independence from British. Hopefully, in 10 years time, changes will happened to the community that I served. #communitydevelopment #forSabahtoSabah #LandBelowtheWind #SMJ"
