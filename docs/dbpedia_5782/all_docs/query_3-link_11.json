Some old Brooke official said that Iban was the\n\nworld's easiestlanguageto learn how to speakbadly. Those Brooke officers\n\nwere unencumbered by visa requirements and some of them were in the\n\ncountry for decades.They knew that Iban was a rich and profound\n\nlanguage, and so could speakironically like this. In writing this grammar,\n\nI feel like an aeronautical engineer who knows how a plane works but\n\nsticks to flying kites.\n\nIban hasa very large vocabulary, full of the most subtle shadesofmeaning.\n\nIts gramrnar appears simple to someone used to tle headachesof endless\n\ntables of verb-forms and rules of syntax, but Iban grammar is no simpler\n\nthan that of ancient Greek. If leaming Greek requires you to memorize\n\neachverb in its 180inflectedforms; Iban askssomethinsno lessdifficult.\n\nWhere Greek, say, makes the grammar of any stateirent completely\n\nexpticit in the forms the words take, the grammatical fullness of lban is\n\nrealized in the interaction between language and context, in the choice of\n\nwords, in subtle shifts of emphasis and linguistic gesture.\n\nAttention to context, gesture, and nuance is vital for tbheetwuenednerssptaonkdeinn-saoldf\n\nany language. I am not making a hostile antithesis\n\nwritten language. Iban also has a literary language. in prose as well as\n\nverse. However, Iban literary and spoken modes exist together much more\n\ncomfortably than in westem languages,for the reasonthat until the second\n\nhalf of this century none of geat quantity of Iban literature was ever\n\nwritten down. Iban was once wholly, and for the most part remains. an oral\n\ntradition. This means that on usage of words and grammar , there is no\n\nauthority apart from the people who actually speaklban. you have to ask\n\nsomebody. Ard to ask somebody you haye to be there, so leaming Iban\n\nmeans you learn and sympathize with Iban life and thought. In nry\n\nopinion, since we are all human beings, this is not asking too much of\n\nsomeonewho feels like making the attempt.\n\nA\n\nThe oneIbangrammaravailabletodayisatechnicalinguisticanalysis,not\n\nvery useful to people who are not themselvesprofessionallinguists. I\n\nhaveput togettrorthisJalai Jaka.'Iban 'the way of Iban speech,'to help\n\nthe moreseriouslyinterestedoutsideiunderstantdhebasicgramniarof the\n\nIban language.The pagesthatfollow oughtto be sufficientto allow lhe\n\nleamerquickly to getinto theflow ofday-to-dayspeech.All tanguagesare\n\ndeep;but peopleleamto speakasto swimby wadingin at theshallowend.\n\nMy aim is to hold the beginner'shanduntil he or shelearnsto float, and\n\nthen castthemoffjoyfully to cavortin theseaof words.\n\nIb:rn oral literature-much ofit recordedin print andreadyto be enjoyed\n\nby the modemsilent reader---offersendlesstreasuresto thosewho love\n\npoetry. Ibanliterarylanguageis verydifficult. I find it hard€rthanPindar\n\n(reputedthemostferociouslydifficult ancientGreekpoet)becausein this\n\nlate era, fewer andfewer peopleare still alive who feel at easewith the\n\nliterary andritual language,and so far very Iban scholarshave had the\n\nopportunity to edit and commenton the epics of their ancestors.The\n\nmeaningsof manywordsof poetryarerecordedonly in thememoriesof\n\nIban singers.\n\nI am offering this presentwork, therefore,partly in the hopethat some\n\nyoung person-Iban or foreign----oflinguistic talent, love for literature,\n\nenthusiasmfor Ibanculture,and,aboveall, energyanddeterminationm, ay\n\nbe aided to learn Iban and be inspired to give us the scholarly helps\n\nnecessaryto keep Iban literature alive, vigorous, and diverseinto the\n\nfuture; and partly to encouragetravellers to try to talk to the natives\n\n('native' hasalwaysbeenagoodword in Sarawak)ih their own language.\n\nI alsohopethatlbanswho wantto leammoreabouttleir own languageo, r\n\naboutEnglish,will find hereaguidethatmakesthemechanicsof grammar\n\neasyandpleasant.\n\nAlthough the study of gammar, even at an elementarylevel, is not as\n\ncommonasit usedto be,I amcountingon thefact thatmostof thepeople\n\nwho pick up this book will understandthe basictermsand conceits of\n\ngrammarf,or example,what'sasubject,whatanobject,whatanadverbis.\n\nIf you're in doubt,any good Englishdictionaryshouldgive you the\n\nmeaningof a term.\n\nI havedeliberatelywrittenthisbookasagrammar,notasa 'teachyourself'\n\ntype course.I have not included passagesfor practice or exercises.I\n\nassumethatthepersonwho wantsto usethis book is alreadyin Sarawak,\n\nor will becominghereshortly.

Iban word orderand,\n\nin greatpart, its syntaxare somuch like what English speakersconsider\n\n'natural' thatI haveomittedanydetailedexplanation,which would getus\n\ninto fine points and away ftom the aim of getting you to talk. I have\n\narrangedmy gmmmarthus: first I talk aboutthesoundsand pronunciation\n\nof lban;thenI discussthenatureof theIbanlanguageandits 'parameters;'\n\nthenI proceedfollowing the variouscategoriesof partsof speech,under\n\nwhich mostpointsof syntaxcanbeconvenientlyexplained.\n\nMy translationosf the exampleswill often seem'stilted.' I havebeen\n\npedanticquitedeliberatelyin orderto illustrateasclearlyaspossiblehow\n\nIbangrammarworts by trying to imitate it with Englishwords. However,\n\nI mustwamyouthatthoughastiltedtranslationmaylay barethegrammar,\n\nit canin no way conveythe fitnessandeleganceof the Iban itself. The\n\nrough andpidgin-like quality of the English illustrationsdoesnol imply\n\nthatthis is whatIban soundslike to an Iban speaker.Quite the opposite:\n\nit meansthatEnglishlacksthegramrnaticarlesourcespeculiarto Ibanthat\n\nIbanusessofruitfully, thatEnglishandIbanarcdifferent.\n\nEveryonewho studiesIban shouldget a copy of Anthony Richards'An\n\nIbqn-EnglishDictiozary,republishedin paperbackby PenerbitFajarBakti,\n\nPetalingJaya. Not only is Richardsvery thoroughandcomprehensiveh,e\n\nalsoincludesexamplesof the way eachword is used,amountingin all to\n\nthousandsa, ndhis dictionaryis in greatpartanencylopediaof thingsIban.\n\nI owe him thegreatestdebtin my own acquisitionof Iban andfor help in\n\nwriting this. When I take a definition or examplefrom Richards'\n\ndictionary,I markit with theletterR.\n\nA wordon spelling. SeveraIlbanscholarsI haveshowtrthisgrammarto in\n\ndraft haveurgedme to conformmy spellingof Iban wordsto the system\n\nproposedin l 995by theMajlis Adat-Istiadat.After carefulthought,I have\n\nbelieveit is bestfor menot to follow this advice. First of all, I havemade\n\nextensiveuse of Richards' Iban-EnglishDictionary in writing this\n\ngrammar. I hope and expectthat anyoneusing my grammarwill rcfer\n\nconstantlyto Richards,and if I were to alter his spellingsyou, reader,\n\nwould be left confusedand hunting for words. Richards' dictionary is\n\nthcbcstavailableto thepresent,theonly dictionarythatgivesgrammatical\n\ncxplanationsand examplesof usage.For this reasonI considerhis\n\n6\n\ndictionary,as a dictionary,to possessmore authority than anything yet\n\npublished. Secondw, hile the revisedspellingsystemmay,whenit is\n\nestablishedb, enefitnativespeakersof Iban,who know,for example,that\n\ntheu prescribedby thenewsystemattheendsof wordsis to bepronounced\n\nsometime[so] sometimeIso?], sometime[su], andsometimeIsu?], (as\n\nin nmto,jale', tuju,paku'), thenon-nxive speakerneedsanexplicit guide\n\nto thesubtletiesof Ibansounds.\n\nIt is ahardtaskto describea languagewhenyou try not to leavetoo many\n\ngapingholesandugly errorsin thdtdescription.In onesensem, y work has\n\nbeencircular. In order to leam lban, I neededto leam its words;but in\n\norderto leamthewords,I neededto leamlban! As mucheffort asRichards\n\nput into his dictionary,he did not get everything,andsinceI haverarely\n\nfoundsomeonewho couldexplaina word to mewithout greatstruggles,I\n\nhadto rely mainly on my own wit to divine rnanymeanings. I found it\n\nuseful to try to shed somelight on the grammarof Iban and work at\n\nlearning the langubgefrom the other side. Yet without the intimate\n\nknowledgeof wordsandusagethatcomesfrom hearinga languagefrom\n\nbirth, I canonly get sofar, andI havegottenthere.\n\nTherefbreI leavethis grammarat thepoint I havebroughtit, andhopethat\n\nmy errors and over-simplificationswill rouseIbans who love their\n\nlanguageto point out whereI got it wrong. Praiseis soothingto theego,\n\nbutcriticism is whatgetsgoodwork done.I welcomeall commentsonthis\n\neffort, andif anyonecancore.t me, he or shecanbe surethat additions\n\nandconectionswill appear,with acknowledgiment,in thenextedition,if\n\nthis book is happyenoughto be reprinted.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI wish to give the first placein my thanksto Mr Drahmanbin Haji Amit,\n\nDistrict Officer Lundu District at the time I began to write, for his\n\nkindness,couriesy,andeffectivenessin gettingmeaspacein whichI could\n\nwork, without which I couldhaveaccomplishednothing.

Until theSpaniardsandPortuguesebegan\n\nto planttheir colonies,Austronesianwasthelanguagefamily spreadmost\n\nwidely overtheworld. Evennowit stretchesfrom Madagascairn thewest\n\nto Hawai'i andEasterIslandin the east,frorn Taiwanin thenorthto New\n\nZealandin the south.\n\nCompare:'coconut'-Ibannyiur Hawaii'atl.niu\n\nAll of thenativelanguagesin Bomeoarerclatedto oneanother,and\n\nrelated also to BahasaMalaysia,the national languageof Malaysia,to\n\nBahasalndonesia,andto the variouslocal Malay dialects. Iban is a very\n\ncloserelativeto Malay, althoughIban is more closelyrelatedto the\n\nancestralanguage(which apparendyarosein Bomeor ) that developed\n\ninto both. If you know Malay,you cangeta goodmanyhints conceming\n\nIban, but you must rememberthat people who sPeakone cannot\n\nautomaticallyspeakthe other,andthatthe geniusesof the two languages\n\narc very different. Iban is alsoclosely relatedto Selakau,spokenin the\n\nwest of Borneo,but lesscloselyrelaiedto Bidayuh and OrangUlu\n\nlanguages.\n\nLcarning the tangnge.\n\nBomeansare,in general,very goodat leaminglanguagesM. any Dayaks\n\nknow at leasttwo, not only local dialects,but suchlanguagesasChinese\n\nand English, which lie outsidethe Austronesianfamily.

Iban people do like to spell ra,\n\nt2\n\nrumah,'ho.use.' The letter r is pronounced differently in different\n\nareas.Ibans usually pronounce r witl a single flap of the tongue.\n\nIn some areaspeople pronounce it like the French r, which is\n\nmade by vibrating the uvula, the little thing that dangles at the\n\nback of the palate. In Sebuyau dialect r becomes h. Berapa iko'\n\norang di baroh rumah? 'Hout many people under the house?'\n\nbecnmesBehapa ik'o'ohang di bahoh humah? However, the sound\n\nr is never trilled the way it is in Indonesian, except when people\n\naretrying to pronounce words exceptionally distinctly, as when\n\nin front of a large audience. Another thing to watch out for, if you\n\ntravel among regions of Sarawakwhere Ibans have different ways\n\nof speaking, is the tendency for r to be converted to, or change\n\nplaces with, l. Some Ibans say berari 'all the time,' (ftom icri\n\n'day') others say belarl some say ular 'snake,' others say zral.\n\nl : l6l.ok 'tired'\n\nw: wong,ai'wong 'rapids.'Thissoundcanexist in the middle of\n\nwords without being spelledout; for example, beruang lberuwa\\l\n\n'bear.' But compare bawang, 'onion.' Sometimes the w sound is\n\nspelled u at the beginnings of words. Uap, 'vapo stgam.'\n\nsungai 'iver.' In some dialects s at the ends of words can be\n\npronounced [h] : p?dis 'painful' becomespedih\n\nThis sound does not occur at the beginnings or in the middles of\n\nwords, even if spelle(l there (for example tn hari 'day' ot sahari\n\n'all day') but only at the ends oJ words, where it signifies a\n\nprolongation ofthe vowel into a rough breathy sound, as in tilr\n\n'tea' or mai.oh 'much/many.' This h at the ends of words is\n\nimportant. The pa tree is different from the pauh nee.\n\nIban also has one consonant that appears in English but is not\n\nrecognized in the standard language.Thi s is the glotnl stop l7l, a\n\nsound made by suddenly cutting off the wind at the very back of\n\nthe tbroat. The glottal stop is what you hear when an Englishman\n\nfrom the north ofhis country saysa littl€ bottk: 'ali'lbo'l...' ln\n\nIban the glonal stop is very important at the ends of words. Of\n\ntwo words that look the sarne,one may have it, one may not, and\n\nthe two will have different meanings. For example, there are the\n\nwordspaya,'pattem,' paya\" swamp,' and payah'fio\\ble\", di'\n\n'you'(sing.) is different from di 'at.'\n\nIJ\n\nAugustineAnggat told me an amusingpieceof riddling word-play that\n\nillustratestheimportanceof theglottal stop:\n\nBaka' Bakn baka baks' aku: 'Baka's betel-basket [is] Iike my\n\nbetel-basket.'\n\nI have followed Richards' practice in his dictionary and indicated the\n\nglottal stopby anapostrophe(') afterthelastvowel.Therehasbeenmuch\n\nargumentabouthow theglottal stopshouldbemarked,but theapostrophe\n\nseemsto me (and to someother worthy folks) to be the most elegant\n\narrangementE. venso,only afew Ibansmarktheglottal stopwhenwriting\n\ntheir language.\n\nexamplea: i' 'water.'\n\nEverydoypronunciation and rqid speech\n\nNative speakersof any language,when they talking in an informal\n\nsituation,takelibertieswith pronunciation,sothatwhatcomesout of their\n\nmouthis not pedanticallycorrectand,asit were,preciselychiselled,but\n\nhereandthereshortenedc, lipped,andslurred.

Word order is tlrc most importaot way Iban uses to indicate\n\ngramrnaticalrelationships. Iban placesthe words of a sentencein\n\ni fairly strict order of Subject,.verb,Object.\n\n.

'Copulative' here hasnothing to\n\ndo with sex, but refers simply to the connecting of two concepts.\n\nSchematically a copulative sentencetakes the form ofa simple equation a\n\n= b, where a is a noun or pronoun, and b is another noun, br an adjective or\n\nsomething that acts like an adjective. The a portion is what the sentenceis\n\nall about and called the subjea in grammar. The subject of a CS (we are\n\nabbreviatingagain)asof any sentenceis alwaysa noun. l2 The equal-sign\n\nplus the b portion is what you say about the subject and is called the\n\npredicate. ('Predicate' means, 'what you say about something'-Latin\n\npraedicare.) In English, the equal-sign is representedby a form of the verb\n\n'to be,' which /xrJt be there; it cannot be left out.\n\n'Grassis green.'\n\n'The watermelon is rioe.'\n\n10srio'is sa-+ iko' 'tail' numericacllassifetrbr animals.\n\n11In Germantodaytheindefinitearticle remains'one'ein.

'To be'is very\n\nmuch here,exceptstrangelyit doesnot appearasan explicit word. You\n\nmight saythat in Iban 'to be' is unmarked[seenote6], or thatits form is\n\n'zero,'that is, nothing. However,it is betterto saythat 'to be' in Iban is\n\nrepresentedby whatlinguistscall a 'trace.' A traceis somethingthattakes\n\npan in the grammaticalo-gicof thoughtbeforespeech,but which is not\n\nrealizedin speechitself. rr\n\nTheconceptsof equating,or associatingwith aquality or categorythat 'to\n\nbe' representsaresobasicto our thoughtthatmanyotherlanguagesaswell\n\naslban haveneverfelt th€needto maketheuseof the verbmandatoryin\n\nthe spokenlanguage. We can do the samein English, althoughnow it\n\nsoundspoetic:\n\n'And darkthe SunandMoon, andtheAlmanachdeGotha.' ta\n\nBut in casualspeechwe can,while waiting for a bus in the rain, for\n\n13To drc ideaof tr\"\"e clearer,I'll give anexampleof a type I haveoften heardfrom\n\nIbanss-paek\"atingEnglish: :Thisis therice whichI boughtit yesterday.'If a nativespeakerof\n\nBnglishwereto saythis, he would not addihe 'it,' which is a tracein theway he mentally\n\nprocesseshis language.The Iban speakeri,nfluencedby theway he processesthoughtinto\n\nspeech,males thetraceexplicit.\n\n14T.S.F]h<*Fou, guarter& 'Eastcoker' trI\n\n2l\n\nexample,tum to afriendandsay'Terribleweather,a' ndbesuresheknows\n\nwe mean'The weatheris terrible.'\n\nTracesarenot entirely 'nothing.'

You will seethatwhenan\n\nIban speakermakesa CS of either the generalor'specificvarietywhich\n\nassignsthe subj€ctto somecategoryheor sheis carefulto specifythekind\n\nof categoryas well as whdt that categorycontains.There are several\n\nreasonsfor this. The simplestis that,asinthe first two kindsofCS, you\n\nhaveto avoid bringingthesubjectaDdpredicateintodircctcontact.because\n\nof the'followingwordmodifiesp' arameterH. enceyoucannotsayeither\n\n*Manokburong16or +Burongmtnok 7f yott are going to makethem\n\nmean'Chickensarebirds.' Manok burongmeans'the chickenof a bird'\n\na:ndburongmanokmeans'the bird of a chicken\".kami Sebuyau means\n\n'we Sebuyaua' ndSebuyaukamimeans'our Sebuyau.'\n\nThe secondreasonis that Iban likes to make it clear that a logical\n\nrelationshipis beingdiscussed.A word of category-which is alsooftena\n\nnumericalclassifer aswell [seebelow]---comesat theheadof its phrase:\n\nsabarnaburong,orang Sebuyau.Thereforethe words split into two neat\n\nparcels,easilyinterpretableassubjectandpredicate,with theface 'to be'\n\nbetweenthem. The very presenceof a word of categorymeansthatthese\n\nassertionsareclassifications.\n\n16when anasteriskappearsin front of awordor phmsein alinguisticwork,it meansthatthat\n\nword or phraseis not found o! not permittedin the language,or is a hypothetical\n\nreconstruction,\n\n23\n\nThe carethatIbantakeswith makingthelogical natureofCs clearis best\n\nillustratedwith a samplesyllogism:\n\nUginganakmensiasiko'.\n\nSemoaa' rutkmensieanda'mu' enda'paraidudihari,\n\nNya'alai Ugingenda'tau' enda'parai dudihari.\n\n'Socratesis a man. All menaremortal, ThereforeSocratesis mortal.'\n\nWhile English speakersoften use copulativesentencesI,ban likes to\n\nexpressthe sameideasmore colorfully. In English we might say, 'My\n\nbreakfastis alwaysapieceof toast,anorange,andtea,' anIban would say\n\nTiappagi aku makaiasi' enggauikanpusumimi4 lalu akangirup segelas\n\nkopi: 'Every moming I eatrice with a little dried fish anddrink a cup of\n\ncoffee.'\n\nWithout gettinginto knotty talk aboutlogic andsemanticsy, ou caneasily\n\nseethatthey operateaswell in Iban asin anyotherlanguage.Thus,you\n\ncan say ljart, rumput 'Grass is green,' but not *Mansa , semangka,\n\n'Watermelonis ripe.' This makesno senseas an assertionabout\n\nwatermelonsas a whole, and cannotrefer as it standsto a specific\n\nwatermelon.\n\nAnother lban prelerence\n\nDiscussionof breakfastbrings up anotherpoint Iban wherelikes things\n\notherthanwhatEnglishlikes. English,broadlyspeaking,likes to express\n\nthingswith nouns. Iban,on the otherhand,is very fond of expressingas\n\nmuch aspossiblethroughverbs. For example,in English we would say\n\n'We wentup theriver thatway with our children.'In Ibanthis goes:Kami\n\nmenyanakmudikkin. Heremenyanakcanbeanalyzedasa verbformedas\n\nfollows: anat means'child', sa-, is a prefix thatmeans'same'or 'with,'\n\n(by therulesof rasalization-seebelow-sa- becomesrya-; thea melds\n\nwith the following a) andme-makesthe wholething into an intransitive\n\nverb. Mrdit on theotherhand,is averbwhosespecialmeaningis 'to goin\n\naboatupriver.' Ibanis hereoftenmorecolbrful thanEnglish. Wesay'We\n\nhav€a dog.'IbanssayKani nupiasu' slto''We raisea dog.' 'To weara\n\nshirt' is expressedby bebajufrombaju'shirt;' 'to live,' asin 'we live across\n\ntheriver' is expressedbyberunmh'to havea house'(rrrrnai 'house).'

'why?' ngapa''invai'.n.'\n\nHow a word behavesmostly dependson how or whereit's usedin the\n\nphmseandsentence.A major pripciple of Iban grammaris, aswe have\n\nsaid,that whenoneword follows another,the secondword modifiesthe\n\nfirst. The natureof the first word determineswhat part of speechthe\n\nsecondwordis to beinterpretedas.

The Englishnouncanalso\n\ntake a form, usually by adding -'s, to show that the nouns 'owns'\n\nsomething,as in 'the cat's food,' or 'the boys' ball.'

We shall leam more about this later.\n\nNumeri.cal chssifiers\n\nIn the section on copulative sentences,we saw that Iban likes to have the\n\nlogical framework of a statement clear, whether you are talking about\n\nsomething as class, or as a specific thing. We English-speakers are happy\n\nto say 'two watermelons' whether we mean that in the senseof 'two fruits\n\nof watermelon' or of 'two kinds of watermelon,' but in Iban you cannot say\n\n+d.uasemangka.It's not enough and the phrasedoesn't mean anything.\n\nThe correct way of saying it would be in the first casedua igi' buah\n\nsenangka. alndi,n the second,dua bansa semangka,\n\nIn lban, if you want to sayhow many of a thing thereare,you must always\n\nusewhat is calleda numericalclassifierin connectionwith the nountiat is\n\nbeingcounted.We do the samething in English,but much lessregularly.In\n\nEnglish,we usenumericalclassifierswhen the thing we're talking aboutis\n\nby naturesomethingthat doesn't come in piecesthat can be counted.For\n\nexample:\n\n'Give me two teaspoonsof sugarin my coffee.'\n\nSugarcan't be counted,exceptgrain by grain, so we put a word in front to\n\nspecify how we ale to measureit. We don't do this in English with wor{s of\n\nthings that we can count. Thus we say 'There are twelve people in the\n\nroom.'\n\nIban uses numerical classifiers like English, to specify how uncountable\n\nthings are to be measured.\n\nAku deka' meli dua gantang beras wangi nya'.\n\n'I want to buy two pecks of the fragrant rice.'\n\nAnd Iban also usesnumerical classiners in front of nouns of thines which\n\nwe thinft countable.\n\nBisi'd.uabelnsiko'orang di baroh rumah.\n\n'There are twelve tairs [it.] of people under the house.' 22\n\nBeri dua banng rokok.\n\n'Give two sticks of cigarette.'\n\nJust as we say: 'I need three she€tsofpaper.'This feature of Iban can make\n\n22 'Under thehouse?'Ibanhouses,whetherlonghousesor single,areusuallybuilt high off\n\nthegroundon pos6.\n\n28\n\nsenseto anEnglish speaker.All things in this world come in quanta, wheth€r\n\nnatural, tails of people, or artifcial, sfteetr of Paper. Iban makes the nature\n\nof thesequanta clear rather than, like English, just assuming it.\n\nNotice that the noun that is being quantified or measured comes in the\n\npossessiveposition after the numerical classifier. Here Iban works in the\n\nsameway as English genitive ('of') construction\n\n'I saw threebowls of soupon the table.'\n\nThat is, the soup itself is thought of asbeing a lot of liquid in a pot, and then\n\nyou take three bowls out of it.\n\nKami meda'tigq iko'orang sida' iya. 'We saw three there of them.'\n\nlit 'We saw three tails of people of them there.]'\n\nAri samuasida,' tiga iko' aja' niki ka ruai kami. 'Olutof all of them,\n\nonly three climbed up to our veranda.'\n\nThe samewith simple words meaning 'many/much 'or 'fedless.'\n\nEnggai aku ngirup maioh tuak diqtu'. 'I'd rather not drink a lot of\n\nrice-wine now.'\n\nlri' mimit qja' ai' nwia nuan deka' ngerebusundang. 'Pour [in] just a\n\nlittle bit of water when you want to boil prawns.'\n\n' Simpan semoa nyc '. 'Put away all of them.'\n\nIn westem languages we call this constructi:on t|].epartative Senitive.\n\nIn the most elaborate style of Iban, there exists a sp€cific numerical classifer\n\nfor almost each and every noun, rather as we say 'a gaggle of geese,' 'a\n\npride of lions,'etc. But from day to day, people use a small number of\n\ngeneral-purpose classifiers. Here is a table:\n\nTypeof thing Classifier Examole\n\nsmallroundishthings tgr'('seed') sekru sigi\"one*rew'\n\nhandleablesizethings, iti'('piece') duaiti'bup'twotl'l,oks'\n\nusuallyflat\n\nstick-like things batang('stick') tiga batqng paip\n\n-'three pipes'\n\nlargishroundedthings bunh ('truit') enpat buah moto\n\n'four cars'\n\npeople and animalsiko' ('tarl') lima iko' orang 'five people'23\n\nAs in English, many phrasescome with the classifier 'built in,' so to speak,\n\n29\n\nfor exampleduit lima puloh ringgit'cashfifty dollats,' tiga kayu' rambutan\n\n'thrce rambutan tees' (more elegantly, tiga pun kayu' rambutqn: pun 'frUmk\n\nof tree)'. Any noun signifying a container or unit of measure,such as\n\np inggai' plzte,' rnangkok' cnp,' tong' tin,' garlang'rice-measure,'\n\ngrni 'gunny-sack,' m'rcr'mete\\' or paun 'po}nd,' will function as a\n\nnumerical classifier To designate single items, put the pre6x sa- (or se-) in\n\nfront of the classifier-nounthat gives you the unit of measure:secangkir\n\ntih' a cupof tea,' satin ikan sadin' a canof sardines.S' akatidagin babi,'a\n\nkati (Chinesepound) of pork.' Sa- means 'one,' which English 'a' also\n\nmeantoriginally.\n\nOccasionally the noun of the thing count€d will be placed at the headof the\n\nphrase,and the numericalclassifierwill follow:\n\nInd.aiJarwu ngaga' tuak dua igi'tojau.

Among these features are the prefixes\n\nke- andge--\n\nMany Iban words begin with the syllable ke or ge. In many of thesewords\n\nthese syllables have been an integral part of the word from as far back as\n\nwe can see;it is merely part of the word's sound.\n\nExample'. kebun' g?Ided Setah' ftee-l^t€x'\n\nYou cannotseparatethesewordsout into *ke + bunor *ge + talr. However,\n\nmany other words appear to have been formed in very ancient times by\n\nputting a special ft€- or g€- in front of another syllable or syllables\n\nAll languages employ the device of onomatopoeia in rnaking words An\n\nonomatopoeiais a word made up in imitation of a sound, like English\n\n'swoosh.'25 In Iban, as well asin otherAustronesianlanguages,a sound\n\nlike cah isjust a sound. However,te- canbe prefixedto a onomatopoeiato\n\nmake it into an actualword. There aremany suchformations in lban. Amrtng\n\na few are:\n\ncah (+ ke-\\-> kecah' chatler' lverbal form engkecahl\n\nrukap (+ ge-) -s geratcp 'squeal,squeak'\n\nBalinese contains a large variety of words formed from onomatopoeias:\n\nBalinese: geblag 'the sound of a door banged shut'\n\nkeplak 'the sotnd of a firecracker blowing up'\n\nThe names of the most ancient musical instruments in the classical\n\nlavanese gamelan orchesha are so formed:\n\nJavanese:ketuk 'the thing that goes \"tuk\" '\n\nkenong 'the thing that goes \"nong\" '\n\nkempul 'the thingthat goes \"pul\" '\n\nand of coursegong itself, which is an instrumentof such dignity that its\n\nsoundis a good enough namewithout a grammatical fixture. Another word\n\ncommon to both Iban and Malay is gendang, the term for drum or for\n\nmusic with drums, which can be analyzedge-n-dang-\n\nThis useofte- andge-, being so widespread,is very old. My beliefis that\n\nthe use of fte- and ge- to form words from onomatopoeiasshows most\n\nclearly the prefixes' basicfunction, which is to converfnotionsinto words\n\nor to convert words from one category to another.26 Iban also uses\n\n/.e- and ge- to form words that have more to with feeling or action than with\n\nsound. The idea is that people describedsomethingin terms of a vocal\n\nsoundthey made.up,asifto say 'this is what it would soundlike if it hada\n\nsound.' the result can be either a noun or an adiective.or a verb-root.\n\nkebap 'flap of wings.' 27\n\nkebut 'mo\\e, budge'\n\nkecit'squirl'\n\nkedap 'ptslse of hean'\n\nkenyit'stmled'\n\nkenyut'throb'\n\ngerit'nibble'\n\ngegar'shake, shiver'\n\n25 Onomatopoeia is, however, not just a kind of word-play, but one of the impoftant means by\n\nwhich words arecreated.For example,the word for'goose'in theAmerican Indian languag€\n\nNaragansettwas ,,ort English :goose'itself go€sback to the samesourceas of the Sansknr\n\nword,aiisa The main soundofthis word, [h5], is very closeto ,honk.' W]atcouldbe more\n\nnatural? The Sanskit is alsothe ancestorof the Iban word for goose,anra. English and lban\n\nhave each yet another word that sharesa common origin in Sanskit. Ibanpdla,,head' dedves\n\nirom Sanskit kapAia 'pot'; the sameancesfal root showsup in English as .gab]€.'\n\n26It may be possiblethat in this function the preiix &e-is relatedto the relativepronoun lg,\n\nbut this needs a deeper look.\n\n-' Always used in reduplicated form: kebap-kebap.\n\nIt is likely that many of the Iban words beginning with ke and ge\n\noriginatedthis way, but the investigationis outsidethe rangeof this book.\n\nWhile /re- is easily recognized as a prefix in nouns made out of\n\nonomatopoeias, in these examples I have listed above the [e- is an\n\ninseparable part of the word. One does not use /ryil in the senseof\n\n'startled,'or gar in the senseof 'shake.'With most Ibannounsor verb-roots\n\nthat begin with ke-, this syllable should be consideredan integral and\n\ninseparabtepart of the word. 28\n\nKe- as a separable prefix is still used. When it attached to a number, it\n\nmakes an ordinal:\n\ndua'two', kedua'second'; lapan'eight' kelapan'eighth.'\n\nLikewise,whente- comesbeforeterubah'at first' it makesfeterubah'first,'\n\nand when it comes before diri, the reflexive pronoun 'self,' the result is\n\nkediri 'alone, by oneself/itseli'\n\nPrefaced to a reduplicated numeral, f€- makes a word that stands for'all\n\n(howevermany) of X':\n\nKetiqa-tigapun lensataku bebuahmagang. 'All three of my lensat\n\ntreesarefruitins.' 29\n\nA good example, though, of how understanding the old function of &e- (or\n\nge-) might be useful is the etymology of the word kemudi 'stern of boat '\n\nThis word can be analyzed and found to contain the root udi 'after, behind,'\n\nwhich we also seein dudi. Kemudi, then, is udi madeinto a noun by having\n\n/re- prefixed to it. The -zr- comes in the middle to make the transition\n\nbetweenthe two vowels. Then tlere is a type of largewaspwith a painful\n\nsting called a kerawoi. The bright yellow band around its abdomen\n\nresemblesthe gidle or brassof silver rings called rawai, wom by women.\n\nThis inSectthenis 'the thing with the rawai.'\n\nWe canusethis methodto discoverthe etymologyof words whoseorigins\n\nareforgotten, suchaskenyalang 'rhir,oceroshombill,' (the most magnificent\n\nof the hornbills and a bird very significant in Iban religion). I propose that\n\nkenyalangcan be analyzedas follows: ke-nya-lang.As we saw with thc\n\nword menyanak above,the -ttya- portion derives from sa- 'with-/together'\n\n28 ln Malay, Iban'sclosestrelative,the prefix te- is widely usedto makeabstraclnou,rso l ol-\n\nrcots or other nouns. The combination te- plus root is always followed by thc suliix rtrt\n\nExamples:/aJd 'king' kemjaan'government' , sihat'healthy' kesihah hcalth.' lbrn docsnol\n\nuse the suffix -dn, with the single exceplion of the word t ruflar, 'anccstry, desccnt.'\n\n29str2 o.26.\n\nby naselization. l.cng is the nameof anotherbird, the Brahminy kite, the\n\nbiggestraptor in Sarawakand the bird that tops the list of the sacredIban\n\nomen-birds.I believethatthehombill's name,Kenyaldn8,means'the bird\n\nequal to, or togetherwith Lang, the eagle.'The hornbill may not be an\n\nomen-bird, but it as important in Iban religion as Lang is. Likewise,\n\ngelinggam'paint' andb, elinggam'sophisticated'may ultimately go backto\n\nSatstrit linggam 'mark, sign.'\n\nAlthough its role in nounswas fixed long ago, the prenx &e-doesplay a\n\nrole in the formation of someverbs where it can be analvzed as a seoarable\n\npiece of grammaticalplumbing. We will talk more atiength about these\n\nusesof ke- in the sectionon verbsahead.\n\nAgent and abstract noan$ the preftx pe-\n\nThe prefix pe- put onto the beginningof a verb makesan agent-noun,that\n\nis, the word for somebodywho doesa particular action, or the nameof a\n\nthing that doessomething,or an abstractnoun.\n\najar,'teach' pengajar 'teacher'\n\npegai 'ltold' p emegai' holder,handle.'\n\npemuka' 'opel:]et'\n\nbuka\"open' pengait 'hook'\n\nkat 'to hook' pemansang'progress'\n\nmansang'go forward'\n\nNote that the verb has to be converted from the root form to the nasalized\n\nform. Nasalizationwill be explainedin the sectionon verbsbelow.\n\ni The begininning soundof a noon or an adjectivealso must be nasalized\n\nbefore pe- can be prefixed to it, except when that sound is nr, which\n\nremainslhe same.\n\n2zrnas'sunshine' pemanas'heat', also (by metaphor),'angry\n\ntemper'\n\nkemas'neat cleaf pengemas'neatnessc, leanliness.'\n\nmaioh'many lmuch' pemaioh' qnantity'\n\nberdt'hea\\y'\n\nmenah'bea\\tifitJ' pemerat'weight'\n\npemanah'beauty'\n\nBefore words that begin in I or r, the syllable -zge- is insertedafter the\n\npe- and before the word to be converted.\n\nlama' old, long' pengelama'peiod. of time'\n\nrami 'lots ofpeople, crowded'pengerami 'a thronging,a gathering'\n\nrindu' 'tolove' pengeindu' 'loye'\n\n34\n\nWhen pe- is usedbeforesomewords beginningin b the prctix can appear\n\naspem:,\n\nberita' news'pemberita' newspaper'\n\nberani'btave' pemberani' courage'\n\nThis way of making words is a handyone,becauseyou can improvisc with\n\nit and make complex words from simpler words to expressall sorts of\n\nconcepts. If nakni means 'to eat,' what should pemakai mean? 'Frxrd,'\n\nnaturally. And if irup means'to drink'(hint: esp. alcohol), what should\n\npengirup mean? Modem Ibanusespe- to createnew wordsfor new things:\n\nszran'line, groove,' penyuran'ruler, straightedge,'\n\nSinceIban canmake abstact nouns,it can often expressthingsin the same\n\n'sophisticated'way we use in English. Insteadof saying sirnplyMaioh\n\norang! Peda-mih! 'Lots ofpeople, look!' you can sayPeda-mdhpemaioh\n\nmensianya'! 'Look at the quantity of humanity!' As in English, these\n\nabstract nouns often have a very specific meaning; one possibility is fixed,\n\nand others are excluded. To giye the answerto my questionjust above,\n\npengirup does not mean 'something to drink' but'drunkardi' penyengok\n\n(fromjengok'peek') means'window' andnothingelse.\n\nAdjectives\n\nThe purpose of an adjective is to describe some attribute or quality of a\n\nnoun. In a phrasesuchasatak besai'abig child' we saythatthe adjective,\n\nbesai, modifies the nolurr,annk. Adjectives in Iban always follow the noun\n\nthey modify, according to the general rule about the relationship of two\n\nwords one after another.\n\nAka meda' anak besalnyc' 'I seethe big child.'\n\nWhen an adjective follows the noun like this it is said to be in the\n\nanrib iveposition-\n\nThe other way an adjective can be used is to make an assertion about\n\nsomething; as we said above in the section on the omission of 'to be,' an\n\nadjective can be apredicate. Aprej'icats adjective in a copulative sentence\n\ncan precede the noun that is the subject of the sentence,\n\nBadasjako'nuan. 'Your speech[is] fine.'\n\nThis word order puts more stress on the predicate. Or the adjective can\n\nfollow the noun.\n\nJako' nuan badas.\n\nHowever,an adjectivewhen usedas a predicatethis way, unlike the way it\n\n35\n\nis used to mark an attribute, is always separatedfrom the noun. In the last\n\nexample, if you took away tbenuan 'yo]u', then you would havejako, badas.\n\nThe feeling of a sent€ncewould be desnoyed and you'd be left with a\n\nphrasemeaningmerely 'fine speech.'\n\nOn the other hand, if the predicate adjective shows the result of the action\n\ndone to something, it follows the noun.\n\nIya ngecqt prau iya kuning. 'He painted,his boat yellow.,\n\nMore on noun plus noun or adjective in the genitive position.\n\nThe genitive positioning of two words, noun or adjective,has a rangeof\n\nusesin Iban which extendbeyond simply indicating possession.A noun\n\ncan follow another noun and be understood,as the object of an action the\n\nfirst noun performs on it.\n\npemuka'botol 'an openerof a bottle' 'a bottle-opener'\n\nA noun in the genitive position can be the thing for whose beneft the\n\nfirst exists.\n\nrumqh manok'thehouse o'mf e[fdoirc]inthee']cohfic[fkoern] sth' .echgiucnk'e,ng-uhnopuoswed' er'\n\nubat bedil'chemical [lit.\n\nbaja sayur 'fertilizer of [for] vegetables'vegetable-fertiliier,\n\nAnd a noun in the genitive position can indicate from where the first\n\ncomes,or of where it is characteristic.\n\niobkeraarnanssguuAmnmgaeqi rii'ku'aanfci'osaohpkoeefdrs[ironicn,eoofuof[tion[ff,r]ofrtmho]emrt]hivAeemfra'er,mrriic'vae,,fra,-Arfmismh-re,icriec.a, n,\n\nPoetic Iban extends this last use of the genitive position to express .like' or\n\n'as' without having to usea preposition. In this examplethe noun follows\n\na verb:\n\nbuloh baoh ngelanggai bayan 'the tall bamboo curving-erect [like] a\n\nparakeeC[i.e. with its long, pointy leavesgrowing out like the tail feathers\n\nof a parakeetl.ru\n\nAr adjective can be followed by a noun to show in what respectthe quality\n\nof the adjectiyeis shown:\n\nlontang ati 'easy at heart' = 'happy'\n\nberqt tulang 'heavy of bone' = 'lazy'\n\n30 Masing,Comingof theGods ,v.2,p.5\n\n36\n\nBuloh baoh ngelanggai bayan\n\nij au rumput' glass-gra,en-'\n\nThe normal way these phrasesare pronounced, with no brcak between the\n\ntwo words and a slight stresson the secondelement, shows they are phrases\n\nand not clipped sentences.\n\nOr a noun can follow an adjective to show what the adjective's quality is\n\ncharacteristicof, to show 'like' or'as':\n\nberani babi'braveflike al pig' i.e. 'wants to do somethingbut hasno\n\nskill'\n\nangat tai' mano^k'hot[as]chickendroppings'i.e. 'enthusiasticfor a\n\nmomentonly.' rr\n\nNouns and adjectives, etc., can be put together in the genitive and\n\nattributive positions to make long compounds. The elaborate praise-names\n\nof heroes and gods in Iban epic in poetry can consist of many elements.\n\nCornpounds\n\nAn exception to the general rule about two words in a row is the creating of\n\ncoErpounds. Iban is fond of putting two words together to make\n\ncompounds that express the pairing of things or concePtscommonly\n\nassociated. The compound can be understood as a single word.\n\nNol!'ns:asu' mayau'dogs-cats'; ru]nok itit' chickens-ducksi'.e.'poultry;'\n\npaku' -tubu'fems-bambooshoots'i.e.'vegetables.'\n\nAdjectives: c€lap angot'cold-hot' [ofmalaria: satit 'sickness' cilap angat].\n\nAdverbs: kin kin' 'thither-hither,' iaras kebaroh 'up-down' siang malam\n\n'daylight-nighf [i.e. a period of 24 hours]\n\n\\erbs: pilai rwnsang 'retum-go out' nurun niki 'go down-go up'\n\nOr a mixture: maioh-macqm 'many-type/like, as' (adjective plus nour/\n\npreposition) i.e. a variety of things:\n\nReduplication\n\nA feature of Iban, and of all other Austronesian languages,is reduplication.\n\nReduplication means 'doubling by repetition' which about explains it. In a\n\nvery ancient stageofAustronesian, people usedreduplication to make words\n\nout of onomatopoeias.A good example is *cucu, formed from a sucking\n\nnoise like tsya. ihis proto--wordevolved into the Iban word last 'breast '3f\n\n3l Theseexamplesarc \"rrrprnajd&o' 'proverbs'takenfrom thecollectionof Christy Duitl\n\nTanggl."
