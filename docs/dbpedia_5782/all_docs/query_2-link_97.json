Proficiency will be tested annually (para 3-11) in those languages for which Defense Language Proficiency Tests are available. If tests are not available, an oral interview will be given according to chapter 3, section IV, of this regulation. c. Commanders authorized linguists must ensure that appropriate nonresident language enhancement and refresher/maintenance material is obtained and integrated into unit training schedules. d. Those who have demonstrated a foreign language proficiency, regardless of how acquired, are encouraged to maintain that proficiency. All personnel with languages required by MOSs and functional areas (FAs) who have been trained to the designated minimum proficiency must sustain and/or enhance that proficiency to remain qualified in their MOSs or FAs. Chapter 2: Linguist Requirements Formulation 2-1. Establishing linguist requirements a. Linguist requirements must be identified to and validated by ODCSINT before documentation in TDA and modification table of organization and equipment (MTOE) documents. b. When identifying linguist requirements-- (1) Note positions in which the primary duties of incumbents cannot be performed without foreign language capability. (2) Note positions which, for optimum effectiveness, must be filled by those with a foreign language capability. This includes effective liaison, planning, coordination, and advisory functions. (3) Clearly document specific language requirements with minimum proficiency requirements. (4) Identify the language proficiency required for each skill (listening, reading, and speaking) for each position requiring the use of a foreign language. Caution should be taken in designating proficiency levels for the required skills. Basic language courses are designed to train to level 2 proficiency (limited working proficiency). Intermediate courses are designed to train to 2+ level proficiency (limited working proficiency plus). Advanced courses are designed to train to level 3 proficiency (general professional proficiency). (5) The eighth and ninth characters of the MOS code for Active Army enlisted linguist positions will contain a language code from appendix B of this regulation. (6) New language requirements or changes to existing authorizations require a 2-year lead time between approval and execution. 2-2. Requisitioning linguists a. Requisitions for linguists will be included in a unit's monthly submission. b. Requisitioning procedures are contained in AR 614-185 for officers and in AR 614-200 for enlisted personnel. Chapter 3: Management of Linguist Assets Section I: Acquisition 3-1. General Linguists play an important role in carrying out Army missions. The Army must recruit, train, and retain qualified linguist personnel to satisfy defense needs. 3-2. Recruiting programs Linguist personnel are acquired through initial accessions and in-service recruiting programs. Language shortages are continually being reviewed for inclusion in the enlistment bonus (EB) and selective reenlistment bonus (SRB) programs. (For more information, see AR 600-200 and DA 611-series circulars.) The ACASP should be used as much as possible to recruit personnel with preexisting (native or civilian acquired) language skills consistent with current Army needs. The ACASP saves the Army training time and money and benefits the soldier-linguist with accelerated promotions. (Also see AR 601-210.) Section II: Qualification--Defense Language Aptitude Battery 3-3. Description The Defense Language Aptitude Battery, or DLAB, is a quantitative estimate of the aptitude of a person to learn a foreign language in a formal training program. Test components for DLAB are listed in DA Pam 611-16. The DLAB has replaced the Army Language Aptitude Test (ALAT) and the Defense Language Aptitude Test (DLAT) 1 and DLAT 2 as a standard language aptitude test. Scores on the ALAT, DLAT 1, and DLAT 2 are no longer acceptable qualifying criteria for entry into the DFLP. The minimum qualifying DLAB score is determined by language category. Within their respective components, the Commanders of PERSCOM, NGB, and ARPERCEN will ensure that compliance with DLAB entry requirements be coordinated with and approved by the Army Program Manager (DAMI-PIT). Requests for waivers should include mitigating factors such as evidence of prior foreign language training or experience, especially in the language to be trained. Waivers to these requirements must be coordinated with and approved by the Army Service Program Manager (ODCSINT). Qualifying DLAB scores by language category are as follows: a. Category I: 85 or higher. b. Category II: 90 or higher. c. Category III: 95 or higher. d. Category IV: 100 or higher 3-4. Personnel to whom the DLAB is administered a. Officer personnel. The test is given to-- (1) Officers (except Army Medical Department (AMEDD) and Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAGC) officers) first entering active service at basic branch courses or at their first duty station when not attending a basic branch course. (2) Officers applying for language training if they have not been previously tested. (3) Officers requesting to be tested if they have not been previously tested. b. Enlisted personnel. The test is given to enlisted personnel who-- (1) Enlist for options requiring DLIFLC facility training. (2) Apply for language training and whose personnel records do not show a DLAB score. This does not apply to military intelligence (MI) linguists applying for intermediate or advanced language training. These soldiers require a current (within last 12 months) DA Form 330 reflecting the following minimum proficiency scores in the language for which training is requested: (a) Intermediate: Listening--2; Reading--2 (b) Advanced: Listening--2+; Reading--2+ (3) Successfully complete Special Forces Assessment and Selection training and whose personnel records do not reflect a DLAB score. 3-5. Approval for DLAB reevaluation a. Personnel who fail to qualify with a score of 85 or higher on the initial evaluation may be reevaluated after a 6-month waiting period. b. First and second retests after a 6-month waiting period may be given on approval of the individual's immediate commander. c. Forward requests for third and subsequent retests and exception period directly to COMMANDER, PERSCOM (ATTN TAPC-PDE), 2461 EISENHOWER AVENUE, ALEXANDRIA VA 22331-0472. 3-6. Recording and reporting DLAB scores a. For the active Army, the test control officer (TCO) takes the test results from the answer sheets and sends them to the appropriate PSC by using a memorandum with the subject line \"DLAB Test Results.\" The records custodian records these scores for officer and enlisted personnel according to AR 640-2-1. DLAB scores are also reported through SIDPERS according to AR 680-5 and DA Pam 600-8-2. b. For USAR Individual Ready Reserve (IRR)/individual mobilization augmentee (IMA), the TCO provides DLAB test scores and testing dates to the Commander, ARPERCEN (ARPC-MOT-T), for inclusion in personnel files. For Troop Program Unit (TPU) personnel, the TCO forwards test results to the individual's unit for inclusion in personnel files at the Major U.S. Army Reserve Command (MUSARC) level. 3-7. Disposition of DLAB answer sheets a. The personnel testing activity ensures that completed DLAB answer sheets are double-wrapped and forwarded by certified or registered mail to the COMMANDANT, DLIFLC (ATTN TEST CONTROL OFFICER, ATFL-ESE-T), PRESIDIO OF MONTEREY CA 93944-5006. Servicing TCOs may consolidate DLAB answer sheets and forward them monthly. b. Servicing TCOs maintain a record of test results for each individual tested in accordance with AR 611-5. c. For ARNG personnel, the TCO forwards test scores to the individual's unit, which subsequently forwards them to the Personnel Services Branch at the State Adjutant General's Department for inclusion in personnel files. Section III: Evaluation and Reevaluation of Linguist Proficiency 3-8. General Language testing is given to Army members who have received foreign language training at Government expense, who claim knowledge of a foreign language as a result of civilian education, residence in a foreign country, or family usage, or whose records indicate previous language study. 3-9. Language proficiency tests a. Language skills in listening, reading, and speaking comprehension are measured by various evaluation techniques and instruments. These include the DLPT I, II, III, and IV; the Defense Language Reading Proficiency Test (DLRPT); and the Interagency Oral Proficiency Interview. Available tests are listed by language in DA Pam 611-16. b. Administer and score tests and handle answer sheets according to the Administration and Scoring Manual for each version of DLPT and DLRPT administered. 3-10. Initial evaluation As an initial evaluation, individuals are given the DLPT for any language in which qualified or for which proficiency is claimed. For languages in which no printed or recorded tests exist, individuals will arrange oral interview tests according to paragraph 3-14 of this regulation, provided certified testers are available. Individuals to be given the DLPT are as follows: a. Cadets at the U.S. Army Military Academy (USMA) upon completion of their senior year. b. Officer personnel at basic branch courses or at their first duty station. Officer personnel who do not attend the basic branch course are tested at their initial duty assignment. c. Enlistees for ACASP options requiring a determination of foreign language proficiency prior to enlistment. d. Enlistees processing through the USARECBN who claim proficiency in a foreign language. e. Individuals graduating from the DLIFLC or other military, civilian, or contract foreign language programs supported by Army funds. f. Individuals completing a command language program course of study (other than Foreign Language Training Center, Europe (FLTCE); Summer Language Program (SLANG); and routine nonresident language training classes supported by Army funds). g. Individuals requesting an initial evaluation upon completion of a self-study course (for example, night school, college, or home study). h. Personnel whose records, evaluation reports, or other documents show a knowledge of a foreign language not recorded on their qualification records. This includes personnel applying for a language-dependent MOS or functional area. i. Individuals not identified above who claim knowledge of a foreign language or languages j. USAR personnel, who will be evaluated annually. 3-11. Reevaluation a. Reevaluation procedures (1) Annual reevaluation is mandatory for individuals, except general officers, who have been trained at Government expense (except for Headstart, Gateway and independent personal nonresident programs). (2) Soldiers requiring a language proficiency will be evaluated in their languages annually. Those who fail to meet the minimum proficiency standard (level 2--listening and level 2--speaking or reading) are given remedial language training and reevaluated with the DLPT every 6 months. If minimum (2/2) proficiency is not met within 1 year for soldiers possessing a category I or II language identifier, 2 years for soldiers possessing a category III language identifier, or 3 years for soldiers possessing a category IV language identifier, language qualification will be withdrawn and, if in a language-dependent MOS, reclassification will be initiated. Soldiers within the reenlistment window (8 months of expiration term of service--ETS) who fail to meet the standard may be extended in accordance with AR 601-280, paragraph 3-3d(8), to complete remedial training. If, upon completion of remedial training, a soldier fails to meet standards, the soldier may request reenlistment for retraining in another primary military occupational specialty (PMOS) only. Waiver of PMOS prerequisites for linguist MOSs may be granted by TAPC-EPL-M. Reserve Component personnel have the following time to achieve minimum proficiency (2/2) in their languages: 2 years for soldiers possessing a category I or II language identifier, 4 years for soldiers possessing a category III language identifier, and 6 years for soldiers possessing a category IV language identifier. Waivers for Reserve Component personnel are submitted through the chain of command to the appropriate waiver authority. (3) Individuals with a language proficiency who were not trained at Government expense are encouraged to be reevaluated annually so that a current linguist file can be maintained. (4) Procedures to identify and notify linguists requiring reevaluation are established by the- (a) PSC for the Active Army. (b) Commander, ARPERCEN, for USAR in coordination with the appropriate MACOM. (c) DCSPER and U.S. Army Reserve Command (USARC) for USAR TPU members (d) The Personnel Services Branch at the State Adjutant General's Department or, in its absence, the individual's unit, for ARNG personnel. b. Reevaluation during foreign language training. Soldiers attending formal language training are exempt from annual reevaluation in the language in which they are being trained for the duration of training. (1) Soldiers must be certified proficient within the past 12 months in a foreign language for which the Department of Defense has a critical need. Orders authorizing FLPP are effective for not longer than 12 months from the evaluation date on the DA Form 330. (2) Soldiers attending basic, refresher, intermediate or advanced language training courses sponsored by the Defense Language Institute (not unit language refresher training) are not to be tested on the DLPT of the language being trained until the training is completed. This restriction applies only for the language in which the soldier is currently being trained; previously authorized FLPP continues uninterrupted while the soldier is in training at the same rate. Soldiers who are proficient in more than one language still require recertification in the other languages if the DA Form 330 expires while the soldier is in training. 3-12. Retesting with the DLPT a. Individuals who have completed significant training programs may be retested in less than 6 months from the last test date as an exception to policy. Exceptions for DLPT retesting must be submitted for approval to the Commander, PERSCOM (TAPC-PDE). If approved for retesting, 6 calendar months (for example, 16 April to 16 October) must elapse before any subsequent test. This requirement cannot be waived. b. Requests for exception will document significant training. Normally, this training consists of at least 6 weeks of immersion training or 6 weeks (5 hours a day) of classroom training. A statement from the individual's commander giving the kind, purpose, and accomplishment that warrants retesting consideration will be included in the request. c. The retesting date then becomes the date required for annual reevaluation according to paragraph 3-11a of this regulation. Section IV: Interagency Oral Proficiency Interview 3-13. General An oral proficiency interview is conducted with a DLIFLC-approved tester in the following circumstances: a. When an individual claims proficiency in a language for which no printed or tape-recorded language proficiency test is available. (See DA Pam 611-16 for a list of all available tests.) Interviewers can assign a speaking proficiency level of 0 through 5 based on an oral interview. Because of the relationship between the speaking and listening skills, the speaking proficiency level score can also be awarded as the listening score. b. When an individual who receives proficiency levels of 3 on all skills tested requests the option of attempting to increase his or her proficiency rating. These individuals will not have their scores lowered as a result of taking the oral interview. The purpose of the oral interview would be only to award higher proficiency levels. The interviewer can assign \"L\" and \"S\" ratings above 3. No procedure currently exists for awarding \"R\" ratings higher than 3 on the basis of an oral interview with the exception of DLIFLC. 3-14. Method for obtaining an oral interview Arrangements for interviews can be made only by the TCO. For specific arrangements, the TCO should contact the Oral Proficiency Testing Office (ATFL-EST-L), Test Administration Branch, DLIFLC. 3-15. Reporting language proficiency derived from oral interview The DLIFLC Oral Proficiency Testing Office reports the results of an oral interview to the requesting TCO, who completes and submits DA Form 330 or 330- E according to paragraphs 3-18 and 3-19 of this regulation. 3-16. Evaluation of proficiency when a DLIFLC-approved interviewer is unavailable The TCO should contact the DLIFLC Oral Proficiency Testing Office for self- rating guidance and forms. The highest rating to be awarded in speaking on the basis of self-rating is 3. Self-rating does not allow for self-assessment of proficiency in the listening and reading skills. Section V: Reporting Language Proficiency 3-17. Language Proficiency Questionnaire DA Form 330 or 330-E is the sole-source document for all of the following: a. Reporting foreign language proficiency. b. Award and withdrawal of SQI \"L.\" c. Eligibility for FLPP. d. Top-loading of the control language (CLANG) or language identification code (LIC) into the enlisted master file (EMF) by the Commander, PERSCOM (TAPC-EPL-M). (Note: A CLANG or LIC cannot be changed or updated through SIDPERS.) 3-18. Preparation DA Form 330 is prepared for all Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) officers and enlisted personnel any time the DLPT or Interagency Oral Proficiency Test is administered. It is also used to report the results of self-rating according to paragraph 3-16 of this regulation. Individuals responsible for its preparation are specified in chapter 1. 3-19. Disposition a. Copies 1 and 2 of DA Form 330 or 330-E for AC personnel are sent to the Commander, PERSCOM; copy 3 is retained in the individual's records. (1) For enlisted personnel, the address is COMMANDER, PERSCOM (ATTN TAPC-EPL-M), 2461 EISENHOWER AVENUE, ALEXANDRIA VA 22331-0457. (2) For officers, the address is COMMANDER, PERSCOM, 200 STOVALL STREET, ALEXANDRIA VA 22332-0406, with the applicable attention line as noted below: (a) ATTN: TAPC-OPE-P (for IN, AR, FA, AV, SF, and AD). (b) ATTN: TAPC-OPF-P (for CM, EN, MI, MP, and SC). (c) ATTN: TAPC-OPG-P (for QM, TC, OD, FI, and AG). (3) For officers not listed in paragraphs (2)(a) through (c) above, the address is COMMANDER, PERSCOM (ATTN TAPC-OPB-D), 200 STOVALL STREET, ALEXANDRIA VA 22332-0411. (4) For warrant officers, the address is COMMANDER, PERSCOM (ATTN TAPC-OPW-D), 200 STOVALL STREET, ALEXANDRIA VA 22332-0406. b. For USAR TPU personnel-- (1) Copy 1 is forwarded to the COMMANDER, ARPERCEN (ATTN ARPC-MOT-T), 9700 PAGE BOULEVARD, ST LOUIS MO 63132-5200. (2) Copy 2 is forwarded to the COMMANDER, USARC (ATTN AFRC-INO), 3800 NORTH CAMP PARKWAY SW, ATLANTA GA 30331-5099, except for personnel assigned to U.S. Army Pacific Command (USARPAC). Copy 2 for USARPAC USAR TPU personnel is forwarded to the COMMANDER, USARPAC (ATTN APIN-PR), FORT SHAFTER HI 96858-5100 (3) Copy 3 is retained in the individual's records. c. For USAR IRR/IMA personnel, all copies of DA Form 330 or 330-E are forwarded to the COMMANDER, ARPERCEN (ARPC-MOT-T), 9700 PAGE BOULEVARD, ST LOUIS MO 63131-5200. d. For ARNG personnel-- (1) Copy 1 is forwarded to the Personnel Services Branch at the State Adjutant General's Department. (2) Copy 2 is forwarded to the CHIEF, NGB (ATTN NGB-ARP-C), 111 SOUTH GEORGE MASON DRIVE, ARLINGTON VA 22204-1382. (3) Copy 3 is retained in the individual's records. e. If an individual or an individual's unit is ordered to active duty for more than 180 days according to AR 135-200, AR 135-210, and/or AR 135-300, the personnel office of the first activity processing either the individual or the unit will comply with procedures in paragraph a above. f. Servicing TCOs will maintain a record of test results according to AR 611-5 for each individual tested. Section VI: Linguist Identification 3-20. General It is essential that individuals possessing foreign language proficiency be adequately identified so their skills can be matched to Army linguist requirements. This becomes especially important during Army contingency operations requiring foreign language specialists. An individual is identified as a linguist when he or she obtains a minimum proficiency level of 2 in listening and 2 in either speaking or reading in any foreign language, regardless of how the proficiency was acquired. The exception to the level 2 proficiency requirement applies to individuals in career management field (CMF) 18, who attend the Special Operations Foreign Language Center and acquire a minimum proficiency level of 1. 3-21. Award of a language identification code a. All individuals who enter the Army with a language capability (other than English) or who obtain a language skill while on active duty, regardless of proficiency, are awarded the appropriate language identification code, or LIC, as follows- (1) For commissioned officers, according to AR 611-101. (2) For warrant officers, as part of their MOS codes according to AR 611-112 and DA Pam 600-11. (3) For enlisted personnel, as part of their MOS codes according to AR 600-200 and AR 611-201. b. Languages and corresponding LICs are listed in appendix B of this regulation and in AR 18-12-4. c. Once awarded, the LIC is not removed from an individual's record. The LIC is maintained as a permanent entry to identify soldiers who qualify or have qualified in a foreign language. 3-22. Award and withdrawal of special qualification identifier (SQI) \"L\" a. SQI \"L\" is awarded by local PSCs to all enlisted personnel who obtain a minimum proficiency level of 2 in listening and in either speaking or reading. b. SQI \"L\" is withdrawn if an individual fails to meet the minimum proficiency level noted in paragraph a above or fails to meet the minimum qualification levels in the regulation specified in paragraph 3-21a of this regulation. 3-23. Failure of enlisted soldiers to meet minimum proficiency levels at Defense Language Institute (DLI) sponsored courses a. The Troop Commander, DLI, has the authority to waive the minimum proficiency level requirements and graduate soldiers. However, this authority should be used on a limited basis and such actions coordinated with PERSCOM (TAPC-EPL-M). b. Soldiers who do not meet course standards and for whom a waiver is not granted are disqualified for duty in language-dependent MOSs and must be reclassified. c. Reclassification actions must be coordinated with and approved by PERSCOM (TAPC-EPL-M) to assure maximum utilization of acquired language skills. Section VII: Control Language 3-24. Genera The control language, or CLANG, identifies the enlisted soldier's primary foreign language for management and strength accountability purposes. It will be designated by the Commander, PERSCOM (TAPC-EPL-M), and appears as the eighth and ninth characters of the soldier's MOS code. 3-25. Designation a. Individuals with only one language have that language designated as their CLANG. b. Individuals with two or more languages have their CLANGs determined by TAPC-EPL-M and the appropriate career branch within PERSCOM. c. The overriding factor in determining the CLANG is the Army's needs. Additional considerations include the-- (1) Soldier's language proficiency. (2) Desires of the individual. d. For enlisted personnel, the CLANG is entered into the SIDPERS personnel file (SPF) through a top of the system transaction. This is accomplished by the Commander, PERSCOM (TAPC-EPL-M), for active Army enlisted personnel, and by ARPERCEN (ARPC-MOT-T), for IRR/IMA personnel, upon receipt of DA Form 330 or 330-E. Section VIII: Career Development 3-26. Enlisted personnel Army enlisted linguist personnel are managed through the following three groups: a. Personnel in language-dependent MOSs. Career development of these personnel will be ensured in training, assignment, and utilization directed by career branch managers and user unit commanders. These personnel will be assigned to duties that stress progressive acquisition and use of higher-level language skills. Intermediate and advanced language courses, when available, are routinely incorporated into their career progression. Language-dependent MOSs are as follows: (1) 97E--Interrogator (2) 98G--Voice Interceptor (3) 97L--Translator/Interpreter (Reserve only) Army linguist proficiency standards for individuals in language-dependent MOSs are minimum ratings of level 2 in listening and level 2 in either reading or speaking. These standards are based on job performance requirements for duty in a linguist MOS; for 98G, the primary proficiency is listening and reading and for 97E, the primary proficiency is listening and speaking. b. Personnel in non-language-dependent MOSs. These personnel, trained in a foreign language in preparation for a specific assignment, continue to be identified as linguist assets after their initial use and are routinely considered for subsequent linguist assignments. However, the attainment of a language skill should not block or hinder the individual's normal pattern for career development in his or her PMOS or CMF. c. Personnel possessing a foreign language capability not received through Army-sponsored training. Utilization of personnel found by voluntary DLPT testing to meet routine language requirements depends on the overall needs of the Army and the individual's language proficiency and availability. The primary reason for identifying such individuals is for potential use in national emergencies or mobilization. Language capability normally does not influence career development within the PMOS or CMF. 3-27. Officer personnel Officer linguist career development will continue to be based on confirmed requirements and be administered under the Officer Personnel Management System (OPMS) specialties or warrant officer MOSs. Officers in the Intelligence and Foreign Area Operations branches, in particular, should seek language training and use it as an important component of a well-balanced background. Section IX: Utilization and Reutilization 3-28. Utilization a. Upon completion of language training, individuals are assigned against the linguist authorizations for which they were trained. Commanders will ensure that these soldiers satisfy the linguist requirement for at least 1 year. b. When requirements have been canceled, the individual will be assigned, when possible, to a position or area where the acquired language capabilities can be used. c. Enlistment bonus and selective reenlistment bonus recipients are assigned against the MOS and language requirements for which the bonus was received. (See AR 601-280, chap 8.) d. The utilization policy above will not be used as a basis for preventing enlisted personnel from applying for Officer Candidate School (OCS), applying for direct commission, or applying for appointment to warrant officer. 3-29. Reutilization a. Enlisted personnel in language-dependent MOSs serve successive assignments against the language requirements for which they were trained. Assignments to positions not requiring a language must be approved by the COMMANDER, PERSCOM (ATTN TAPC-EPL-M), 2461 EISENHOWER AVENUE, ALEXANDRIA VA 22331-0457 for AC enlisted personnel and by the appropriate MUSARC for USAR personnel. ARNG personnel should refer to NGR 600-200 for specific guidance concerning reassignment restrictions. b. Reutilization of enlisted personnel in non-language-dependent MOSs and of officer linguists to fill language requirements is determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the needs of the Army and the impact on the individual's professional development. While reutilization is less costly and improves the language proficiency of an individual, its effect on the Army's goal of developing sufficient qualified linguists to continually meet Army requirements must also be considered. 3-30. Application for linguist assignments (enlisted personnel) Qualified personnel may apply for a linguist assignment by submitting DA Form 4187 (Personnel Action) through command channels to the COMMANDER, PERSCOM (ATTN TAPC-EPL-M), 2461 EISENHOWER AVENUE, ALEXANDRIA VA 22331-0457. Chapter 4: Training 4-1. Resident foreign language training. The DLIFLC provides full-time language training for the Army. Most resident basic course instruction is conducted at the Presidio of Monterey, CA, but members of the Defense Attaché System (DAS) and service personnel studying designated low-enrollment languages are trained in other Government or commercial facilities under the auspices of the DLIFLC's Washington, DC office. Basic language courses at DLIFLC are designed to train to level 2 in listening, reading, and speaking skills. 4-2. Nonresident foreign language training. Nonresident foreign language programs are the responsibility of unit commanders. This training may include materials provided by Distance Education Training Division, DLIFLC, and other training materials/systems approved by the MACOM foreign language training manager. 4-3. Unit training (Command Language Programs) a. Commanders at all levels whose unit mission accomplishment depends on the foreign language skills of assigned personnel will, as part of their Command Language Programs, establish on- and off-duty refresher maintenance training programs. Sufficient refresher and maintenance training time should be given in unit training programs to ensure that foreign language proficiency is maintained or enhanced. Commanders should not require individuals attending Command Language Programs to take the DLPT more than annually unless a situation warrants retesting. b. Commanders at all levels whose mission accomplishment does not depend on language skills but who consider language training necessary for other reasons may also establish training programs. 4-4. Qualifications for DLIFLC training. To qualify for training at the DLIFLC, individuals must meet the following requirements: a. All military personnel. Applicants must-- (1) Have successfully completed high school or general education development (GED) equivalent. (2) Possess a qualifying DLAB score as defined in paragraph 3-3. (3) Possess an interim or final SECRET security clearance. (4) Have no major speech impediment that would cause language acquisition to be difficult or personally embarrassing (5) Possess a physical profile serial of 1 in the S factor (Psychiatric) and the minimum hearing acuity of 2 in each ear in the H factor (Hearing). (6) Meet the height and weight standards in AR 600-9 or AR 40-501 for non prior service (NPS) personnel undergoing initial entry training (IET). b. Military Intelligence linguists. When applying for intermediate or advanced language training, these individuals must meet language proficiency criteria specified in paragraph 3-4b(2). c. Officers. (1) Officers, except those in the Military Intelligence and Special Forces branches and in MOS 18A (Special Forces warrant officers), must have served at least 3 years in their branch or MOS (for warrant officers) in the active military service. This requirement may be waived by career division chiefs to meet valid requirements. (2) ARNG and USAR officers must have enough time after language training to complete their incurred obligation without exceeding 20 years active Federal Service or RC retention criteria. d. Enlisted personnel. Enlisted personnel must-- (1) Have a qualifying DLAB score according to paragraph 3-3 (2) Have completed basic and advanced individual training before entering a language course (except those enlisting for 97E and 98C linguist MOSs and MOS 98Gs receiving language training as a prerequisite for advanced individual training--AIT). Personnel undergoing basic or advanced individual training may submit applications for language training, provided the MOS for which they are being trained has linguist authorizations. (3) Waive enlistment or reenlistment commitments. Those with enlistment or reenlistment commitments must agree to waive them according to AR 601-280, chapter 2. 4-5. Preparation and submission of DLIFLC training applications a. Officers. Officers may show a general interest in DLIFLC training by regularly submitting DA Form 483 (Officer's Assignment Preference Statement). They may also submit applications for language training to the COMMANDER, PERSCOM (ATTN TAPC-OP-APPROPRIATE CAREER DIVISION), 200 STOVALL STREET, ALEXANDRIA VA 22331-0411, except as indicated in c and d below b. Enlisted personnel. Applications for DLIFLC training, to include DLAB scores, are prepared on DA Form 4187 and processed according to DA Pam 600-8. Forms are sent to the COMMANDER, PERSCOM (ATTN TAPC-EPL-M), 2461 EISENHOWER AVENUE, ALEXANDRIA VA 22331-0457. c. Judge Advocate General's Corps officer personnel. These personnel send their applications to HQDA (DAJA-PT), WASH DC 20310. d. Reserve Component personnel. These personnel submit their applications according to AR 135-200. 4-6. Individuals ineligible for resident language training. The following categories of personnel may not apply for resident language training: a. Those serving on a service-remaining requirement based on prior training. They must first have served in the MOS for which trained for a period specified in AR 614-200. b. Transient and patient personnel. c. Individuals under courts-martial charges. d. Individuals serving on stabilized assignments (unless the application for training is for a time after the stabilized assignment is terminated). e. Enlisted personnel attending courses at Army Service Schools (unless training is in an MOS complemented by language training). f. Personnel in overseas commands unless the course is scheduled to begin after the foreign service tour is completed. g. Individuals being processed for discharge. (This does not apply to individuals reenlisting for their own vacancies.) h. Officer and enlisted personnel who did not complete a DLIFLC course because of academic failure. (The Commander, PERSCOM (TAPC-EPL-M), has the authority to grant waivers on a case-by-case basis.) i. Personnel whose records are under suspension of favorable personnel actions. j. Personnel whose security clearances have been suspended or revoked (AR 604-5). 4-7. Selection for DLIFLC training a. General. The selection of active Army personnel for language training is governed by projected worldwide requirements by MOS and branch, grade and language. Training requirements at the DLIFLC are filled, as much as possible, with volunteers. When volunteers are not available, the Commander, PERSCOM, makes selections for school attendance. The Commander, PERSCOM (TAPC-EPL-M), may waive standards for enlisted personnel to fulfill the needs of the Army. b. Service obligation. Volunteers approved for language training at Government expense incur the following service obligation: (1) Officers. Officers incur a service obligation computed from when a language course ends (according to AR 350-100) of 1 year for a course of 7 to 20 weeks, 2 years for a course of 21 to 33 weeks, and 3 years for courses longer than 33 weeks. (a) Assignment orders contain the following statement: \"Service obligation of 1, 2, or 3 years (whichever is applicable) incurred under the provisions of AR 350-100.\" (b) The service obligation for language training does not apply to officers who were involuntarily ordered to language training. (c) ARNG and USAR officers (on active duty or in Reserve status) who do not have sufficient service time remaining to meet the obligatory tour listed in (a) above should request a service extension under AR 135-215. The application includes a statement of understanding of the service obligation incurred. (2) Enlisted personnel. (a) Enlisted personnel incur service remaining requirements computed from when the school course ends, according to AR 614-200. Personnel selected for language training for a special program must meet the service obligation of that program. (b) Applicants who are qualified for language training but who do not have enough time remaining in the service must either extend or reenlist (AR 601-280). Extensions or reenlistments must take place prior to departing the current duty station or the individual will be deleted from assignment to the DLIFLC. 4-8. Duty status while attending DLIFLC training a. Those selected for language training in courses of 20 weeks or more are assigned on a permanent change of station (PCS) as outlined below. (1) When courses are conducted at the Presidio of Monterey, students are assigned to the TROOP COMMAND, DLIFLC, PRESIDIO OF MONTEREY CA 93944-5006. They must report for enrollment during normal duty hours on or before the report date specified on their orders. (2) When courses are conducted under the auspices of the DLIFLC Washington Office, students are assigned to the HQ COMPANY, US ARMY GARRISON, FORT MYER VA 22211-5009. They must report for enrollment between 0800 and 1600 hours on the reporting date to the DLIFLC WASHINGTON OFFICE, CRYSTAL GATEWAY NORTH (SUITE 507), 1111 JEFFERSON DAVIS HIGHWAY, ARLINGTON VA 22202-4306. (3) Officer attaché trainees who receive language training at the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) are assigned to the US ARMY FIELD SUPPORT CENTER (ATTN IASV-P), FORT MEADE MD 20755. b. Those selected for language training of less than 20 weeks are assigned temporary duty (TDY) en route to a new assignment or TDY and return to unit. Transmit records for TDY personnel according to AR 640-10. 4-9. Other educational institutions and commercial contractors. Non-DOD educational institutions and contractors may be used for language training when DOD assets are unavailable and when these alternatives best meet the overall needs of the Army. Chapter 5: Linguist Readiness and Language Programming and Budgeting 5-1. Linguist readiness reporting Unit commanders who are authorized linguists and who are required to report unit status according to AR 220-1 will include information on the unit's linguist posture in the unit status report. The narrative in the \"remarks\" column of the unit status report should describe aspects of the unit's linguist posture such as language mix on hand versus that authorized, linguist proficiency, and training programs.

In languages for which only DLPT I and II are available, soldiers are tested only in listening and reading. 2. DLPT III and IV add a taped, spoken component to the testing system. However, for FLPP qualification, the spoken portion of DLPT III and IV is waived until otherwise directed. However, even though only the listening and reading portions are required for FLPP qualification, soldiers may be administered the spoken component if they request it. TCOs should have already received DLPT III and IV. Forward information regarding procedures for ordering to the Army Personnel Test Program manager at the following address: COMMANDER, PERSCOM (ATTN TAPC-PDE), 2461 EISENHOWER AVENUE, ALEXANDRIA VA 22331-0472 (telephone: DSN 221-2830 or commercial (703) 325-2830). 3. Procedures for ordering DLPTs are contained in DA Pam 611-16. Further guidance is available from the Army Personnel Test Program Manager at the above address. A list of currently available tests with their formats and component numbers are issued to all TCOs via message and updates of DA Pam 611-16. Implementation of new tests and availability of their components are announced by electric message or DA circular. 4. The DLRPT is available in the following languages: Amharic, Haitian-Creole, Hausa, and Hindu. FLPP eligibility is determined on the basis of that one skill only. 5. The telephonic verbal proficiency test is used to determine FLPP for languages in which no DLPT exists. FLPP eligibility is determined on the basis of speaking proficiency only, even if the test is taken in person and a reading score is given. TCOs can arrange for telephonic verbal testing in these languages by contacting the Language Proficiency Testing Branch at DLIFLC in Monterey, CA (telephone: DSN 878-5505/5228 or commercial (408) 242-5505/5228). 6. Telephonic verbal proficiency testing with DLIFLC is used to determine a proficiency level greater than 3. TCOs must contact the Language Proficiency Testing Branch at DLIFLC as noted above. 7. Soldiers who are due annual reevaluation but are assigned to a foreign country where U.S. Army testing support is not provided are tested prior to departure from the losing command. Testing is administered according to AR 611-;5, paragraph 3-9. Soldiers who are currently in a foreign country or on short-notice deployment where testing facilities are not available can have their commanders and/or supervisors recertify their current proficiency in lieu of the DLPT. Document recertification on DA Form 4187 with the following annotation: \"The commander/supervisor certifies that the recipient can perform his/her linguistic duties in a satisfactory manner and is proficient at a level consistent with the FLPP rate for the previous year.\" The DA Form 4187 is forwarded to the appropriate record custodian for issuance of orders to authorize FLPP. Orders authorizing FLPP are effective for not longer than 12 months from the evaluation date on the DA Form 330. Soldiers must be recertified using DLPT as soon as practicable and in all cases within 60 days after return to their permanent duty station. 8. See paragraph 3-11b(2) of this regulation for exemptions related to soldiers attending DLI-sponsored courses.
