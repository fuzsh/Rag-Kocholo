        "text": "Language: Indonesian\n\nSource: In common use\n\nDescription\n\nDayak comes from the local word daya meaning \"savages\", a term used by coastal Malay people of Borneo to describe the natives in the interior. Linguistically they are part of the group of the Austronesian languages, and their religion used to be mainly animism although many have since converted to Islam or Christianity. Dayak are well known for their headhunting practices that continued for some tribes even into the 20th century.\n\nDayak groups\n\nThe Dayaks can be divided into seven main groups, with each many subgroups:\n\n1. Ngaju\n\nGreater Batang Baiju, Lesser Batang Baiju.\n\n(Central Kalimantan.)\n\n2. Ot Danum\n\nMost important group in the upper Melawi River.\n\n(Upper reaches of south Kapuas River, and along the Schwaner range, bordering West Kalimantan and Central Kalimantan.)\n\n3. Apo Kayan-Kenyan\n\nSubdivided in Kayan Dayak, Kenyah Dayak, Bahau Dayak.\n\n(Sarawak, East Kalimantan and North Kalimantan.)\n\n4. Iban (Sea Dayak)\n\n(Sarawak, Brunei, West Kalimantan)\n\n5. Kadazan-Dusun\n\n(Sabah)\n\n6. Punan\n\n(Sarawak)\n\nDayak swords\n\nThe Dayak are best known for their headhunting swords, which most collectors call mandau, a name popularized by Carl Alfred Bock in his 1882 publication. Locally the sword went by several other names.\n\nParang ilang in the Kayan language. (The most widely used name.)\n\nDuku apang by the Iban (Sea Dayak).\n\nBaieng by the Kenyah.\n\nBandau by Lun Bawang\n\nA characteristic feature of the mandau, a.k.a. parang ilang, is that for a right-handed person the blade was hollow ground on the left side, and convex on the right side. Sometimes the opposite is encountered, made for a left-handed person.\n\nFor more information, see my glossary article: mandau.\n\nImportant sources on Dayak people and their weapons\n\n(Arranged per date)\n\nCarl Alfred Bock; Head-hunters of Borneo: a narrative of travel up the Mahakkam and down the Barito; also, Journeyings in Sumatra.
