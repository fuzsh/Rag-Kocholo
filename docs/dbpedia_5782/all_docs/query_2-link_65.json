        "text": "Indonesian (bahasa Indonesia [baˈhasa indoˈnesija]) is the official and national language of Indonesia. It is a standardized variety of Malay, an Austronesian language that has been used as a lingua franca in the multilingual Indonesian archipelago for centuries. Indonesia is the fourth most populous nation in the world, with over 270 million inhabitants of which the majority speak Indonesian, which makes it one of the most widely spoken languages in the world. Indonesian vocabulary has been influenced by various languages, including Javanese, Minangkabau, Buginese, Banjarese, Arabic, Dutch, and English. Many borrowed words have been adapted to fit the phonetic and grammatical rules of Indonesian.\n\nMost Indonesians, aside from speaking the national language, are fluent in at least one of the more than 700 indigenous local languages; examples include Javanese and Sundanese, which are commonly used at home and within the local community. However, most formal education and nearly all national mass media, governance, administration, and judiciary and other forms of communication are conducted in Indonesian.\n\nPhonology[]\n\nVowels[]\n\nIndonesian has six vowel phonemes as shown in the table below.\n\nTable of vowel phonemes of Indonesian Front Central Back Close /i/ /u/ Close-Mid /e/ /ə/ /o/ Open /a/\n\nDiphthongs[]\n\nIndonesian has four diphthong phonemes only in open syllables. They are:\n\n/ai̯/: kedai ('shop'), pandai ('clever')\n\n/au̯/: kerbau ('buffalo'), limau ('lime')\n\n/oi̯/ (or /ʊi̯/ in Indonesian): amboi ('wow'), toilet ('toilet')\n\n/ei̯/: survei ('survey'), geiser ('geyser')\n\nSome analyses assume that these diphthongs are actually a monophthong followed by an approximant, so ⟨ai⟩ represents /aj/, ⟨au⟩ represents /aw/, and ⟨oi⟩ represents /oj/. On this basis, there are no phonological diphthongs in Indonesian.\n\nDiphthongs are differentiated from two vowels in two syllables, such as:\n\n/a.i/: e.g. lain ('other') [la.in], air ('water') [a.ir]\n\n/a.u/: bau ('smell') [ba.u], laut ('sea') [la.ut]\n\nConsonants[]\n\nIndonesian consonant phonemes Labial Dental/\n\nAlveolar Palatal Velar Glottal Nasal m n ɲ ŋ Plosive/\n\nAffricate voiceless p t̪ t͡ʃ k (ʔ) voiced b d d͡ʒ ɡ Fricative voiceless (f) s (ʃ) (x) h voiced (v) (z) Approximant w l j Trill r\n\nOrthographic note:\n\nThe sounds are represented orthographically by their symbols as above, except:\n\n/ɲ/ is written ⟨ny⟩.\n\n/ŋ/ is written ⟨ng⟩.\n\nThe glottal stop [ʔ] is written as a final ⟨k⟩, an apostrophe ⟨'⟩ (the use ⟨k⟩ from its being an allophone of /k/ or /ɡ/ in the syllable coda), or it can be unwritten.\n\n/tʃ/ is written ⟨c⟩.\n\n/dʒ/ is written ⟨j⟩.\n\n/ʃ/ is written ⟨sy⟩.\n\n/x/ is written ⟨kh⟩.\n\n/j/ is written ⟨y⟩.\n\nStress[]\n\nIndonesian has light stress that falls on either the final or penultimate syllable, depending on regional variations as well as the presence of the schwa (/ə/) in a word. It is generally the penultimate syllable that is stressed, unless its vowel is a schwa /ə/. If the penult has a schwa, then stress moves to the ante-penultimate syllable if there is one, even if that syllable has a schwa as well; if the word is disyllabic, the stress is final. In disyllabic stress with a closed penultimate syllable, such as tinggal ('stay') and rantai ('chain'), stress falls on the penult.\n\nHowever, there is some disagreement among linguists over whether stress is phonemic (unpredictable), with some analyses suggesting that there is no underlying stress in Indonesian.\n\nRhythm[]\n\nThe classification of languages based on rhythm can be problematic.[1] Nevertheless, acoustic measurements suggest that Indonesian has more syllable-based rhythm than British English,[2] even though doubts remain about whether the syllable is the appropriate unit for the study of Malay prosody.\n\nGallery[]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nIndonesian language"
