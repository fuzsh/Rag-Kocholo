        "text": "With the team unable to compete as constituted in the Western Conference, it was painfully obvious for all involved with the Memphis Grizzlies that it was finally time to break up the Marc Gasol-Mike Conley core and build a young nucleus around talented rookie power forward Jaren Jackson Jr.\n\nThe first huge step was made Thursday afternoon when the Grizzlies finally traded Gasol to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for center Jonas Valanciunas, wing C.J. Miles, point guard Delon Wright and a second round pick in 2024, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. Gasol has a 15% trade kicker and will get an extra $1.28 million for being traded, according to ESPN's Bobby Marks.\n\nSeveral teams were interested in Gasol, most notably Charlotte. Gasol was held out of Memphis' last two games in preparation for a potential trade, with his number 33 (which could one day be retired by the Grizzlies) ripped off of his locker and half his stuff seen in a garbage bag on Tuesday night.\n\nConley was not traded prior to Thursday's 3 p.m. deadline despite interest from numerous teams, most notably Utah, Indiana and Detroit. But the teams were unable to meet Memphis' reported demands. The Grizzlies will try to trade Conley again before June's draft, according to ESPN's Zach Lowe. Conley has two years and $66 million remaining on his contract, and has been a Memphis mainstay for more than a decade. One reason Conley was kept is his ability to mentor the 19-year-old Jackson, ESPN's Tim McMahon reported.\n\nValanciunas and Miles both have player options for next season, at $17.6 million and $8.7 million respectively. So while those players may still be on the books next season, and Miles is still a valuable wing despite a down season so far, the potential prize in this trade will be Wright, who will be a restricted free agent after the season.\n\nIn 49 games, all but two off the bench, Wright, 26, is averaging seven points and just over two assists per game while helping Toronto's second unit. He's ranked 33rd among 97 point guards in ESPN's Real Plus Minus metric and is 27th in that metric defensively.\n\nIt's yet to be seen what Memphis will do with the trio of players, and they could technically all be off the books in July, but it seems likely that the oft-injured Valanciunas will opt in to the final year of his contract. Miles could potentially get more than the money he's owed next year in a new multi-year contract, and a team could go after Wright in restricted free agency, but the Grizzlies would have the opportunity to match an offer sheet should that happen.\n\nGasol was 53 games into his 11th NBA season, all with Memphis, making three All-Star games and reaching the playoffs six times. Memphis advanced in three of those years, including a run to the conference finals in 2012-2013. Those were the days when the Grit N' Grind era was at its peak with Gasol, Conley, Zach Randolph and Tony Allen playing under head coach Lionel Hollins.\n\nWith Memphis struggling offensively, those glory days are long gone, even if the team's tried re-creating versions of it. The Grizzlies have struggled mightily offensively even with Gasol and Conley healthy, and it became abundantly clear that a large roster overhaul was necessary. That began in earnest Thursday with the Gasol deal and with rotation players JaMychal Green and Garrett Temple being dealt to the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for guard Avery Bradley, whose 2019-2020 contract is only guaranteed at $2 million if he's waived by July 3. That's expected to take place. Memphis also traded guard Shelvin Mack to Atlanta for 22-year-old shooting guard Tyler Dorsey.\n\nThough a Conley trade would have signaled a full teardown for Memphis, that will have to wait until the offseason. But with Gasol, Green, Temple and Mack traded for young players and veterans on short contracts, the Grizzlies' rebuilding phase has officially begun. Now it's up to management to build a team around Jackson, Dillon Brooks, Ivan Rabb and their 2019 first round pick. But the Gasol era, and thus the Grit N' Grind era is officially history."
