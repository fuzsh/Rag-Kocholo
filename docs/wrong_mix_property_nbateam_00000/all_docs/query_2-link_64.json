        "text": "With the 2024 NBA Free Agency approaching, plenty of players are set to sign with different teams. One of the top names on the market is set to be Nic Claxton. At just 25 years old, Claxton is bound to have plenty of suitors. The team that makes the most sense though that Claxton will sign with is the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nFOR MORE NBA CONTENT, CHECK OUT THE FOLLOWING LINKS:\n\n–LeBron James Will Join the Phoenix Suns in 2024 NBA Free Agency\n\n–Three Underrated 2024 NBA Free Agents\n\n–The Chicago Bulls MUST DRAFT Donovan Clingan or Matas Buzelis in 2024\n\nClaxton has been the epitome of consistency, converting 79.1% of his shots near the rim over his career. That type of production found himself routinely being a key player for the Brooklyn Nets last season, averaging 11.8 points, 9.9 rebounds, and 2.1 blocks per game. Claxton is extremely athletic and an elite shot-blocker making him play big on the inside.\n\nA big need for the Grizzlies is rebounding, which makes Claxton an ideal player. Jaren Jackson has struggled on the boards, and that resulted in Memphis averaging the seventh-fewest rebounds per game last season, with 42.6. The Grizzlies need a more physical center presence that can make rebounding a strength for a team. Not only would Claxton add that presence, but his capabilities as a scorer would prove to be even more beneficial for the Grizzlies to turn into true contenders.\n\nAnother key in this is the friendship between Claxton and Ja Morant. The two were teammates at AAU together and already know each other’s play style to gel together instantly."
