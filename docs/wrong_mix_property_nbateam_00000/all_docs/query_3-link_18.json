        "text": "Building on our initial exploration of the Big East’s dynamic landscape, Part 2 of our series delves deeper into the strategic nuances that could elevate teams to contender status or relegate them to the realm of pretenders. As the new season approaches, excitement is building. Changes in each team’s roster promise to shake up their fortunes. In this article, we will spotlight the newly added transfers, as well as the incoming freshmen who will ignite a fresh wave of energy in the Big East conference.\n\nFrom UConn’s pursuit of a historic three-peat to the underdogs trying to shake up the hierarchy, the competition between coaches could shape the story of this season. Stay tuned as we dissect how tactical prowess and sideline leadership could make or break the aspirations of Big East teams this year. This is Big East contenders vs. pretenders.\n\nWay Too Early Big East Contenders vs. Pretenders (Part 2)\n\nDePaul Blue Demons\n\nHead Coach: Chris Holtmann\n\nIncoming Freshmen: Chris Riddle – SF (3-star recruit), Sekou Konneh – F (3-star recruit)\n\nImpact Transfers (In): J.J. Traynor – F, N.J. Benson – F, David Skogman – C, Isaiah Rivera – G\n\nImpact Transfers (Out): Jaden Henley – G\n\nHigh-Level Outlook: Recent history has not been kind for DePaul basketball. The Chicago-based private Catholic school has two NCAA tournament appearances since 1992, the most recent coming back in the 2003-04 season. The Blue Demons haven’t been Big East contenders in a long time. Out is head coach Tony Stubblefield and in is former Ohio State head coach Chris Holtmann. Holtmann brings a considerable amount of success with him to DePaul. It is fair to assume that Holtmann will eventually start winning in the Big East, but it feels much too early for wins now.\n\nDePaul is looking to recover from a 3-29 season, during which they went 0-20 in Big East play. They are expecting a moderate improvement in the upcoming season. The departure of Henley from the program is notable, but Holtmann has made some impactful additions, bringing in transfers Traynor, Benson, Skogman, and Rivera. These new additions are expected to make immediate contributions and earn significant playing time. Riddle and Koneh may also benefit from the large number of player departures and roster changes, providing them with the opportunity for immediate playing time. Despite these changes, the overall status of the program, including the roster and incoming talent, will likely continue to hold DePaul back this season. It’s unlikely that they will be Big East contenders in the near future. Holtmann, however, is a successful coach with the capabilities to guide the program back on track. Nevertheless, this upcoming season will likely be focused on learning and rebuilding.\n\nPrediction: Big East Pretenders\n\nGeorgetown Hoyas\n\nHead Coach: Ed Cooley\n\nIncoming Freshmen: Thomas Sorber – C (4-star recruit), Kayvaun Mulready – SG (4-star recruit), Caleb Williams – F (3-star recruit)\n\nImpact Transfers (In): Malik Mack – G, Micah Peavy – F\n\nImpact Transfers (Out): Dontrez Styles – G, Ryan Mutombo – C, Rowan Brumbaugh – G\n\nHigh-Level Outlook: The Georgetown Hoyas are facing an identity crisis. While they are recognized as one of the more esteemed and well-known teams in the NCAA, their recent lack of success has proven to be a more significant obstacle than initially anticipated. Coach Cooley is coming off his first season with the Hoyas, during which the team posted an overall record of 9-23, with a 2-18 performance in Big East play. This falls short of the former Big East-contending Hoyas’ expectations. With the departure of Styles, Mutombo, and Brumbaugh from the program, new opportunities are arising. The atmosphere in the Nation’s Capital feels stagnant. Coach Cooley is working hard to breathe new life into this struggling program.\n\nThe additions of Mack and Peavy will undoubtedly elevate this team. With Mack from Harvard and Peavy from TCU, their arrival is bound to change the trajectory of this storied program. Cooley’s success on the recruiting trail is proving to the Georgetown brass that he is the one to lead them out of these challenging times. Incoming freshmen Sorber and Mulready have the potential to make a significant impact. Williams’ physical prowess could make him an immediate asset to the coaching staff. While the Hoyas may not be Big East contenders, they are certainly not destined to be basement dwellers. This upcoming season will be pivotal for Cooley and the team as they strive to reclaim their position among the top ranks of the Big East.\n\nPrediction: Big East Pretenders\n\nMarquette Golden Eagles\n\nHead Coach: Shaka Smart\n\nIncoming Freshmen: Damarius Owens – F (4-star recruit), Royce Parham – F (4-star recruit), Joshua Clark – C (3-star recruit)\n\nImpact Transfers (In): N/A\n\nImpact Transfers (Out): N/A\n\nHigh-Level Outlook: Under Smart, the Marquette Golden Eagles have spread their wings and they are SOARING. Smart left Texas to join Marquette back in 2021. The move was deemed questionable at the time, but hindsight is 20-20. Smart is 75-30 at Marquette and is showing no signs of slowing down. The Golden Eagles pose the largest threat to the back-to-back Champion UConn Huskies as Big East contenders. Tyler Kolek and Oso Ighodaro were both second-round picks in the NBA Draft but Kam Jones is coming back for his senior season. That is a huge win for the team as Jones is a first-round talent.\n\nThe Marquette Eagles are not losing any players to the transfer portal, nor are they bringing anyone in through this portal. The team is adding two 4-star forwards who could quickly compete for playing time. With the team being short on forwards, the addition of these two top-100 recruits should strengthen the team. Watch out for improvement from Coach Smart’s previous recruits, as this is his fourth year with the program and the roster now consists entirely of his own players. Marquette is a true contender in the Big East and will aim to prove themselves on the court in the upcoming season."
