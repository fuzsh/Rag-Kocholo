        "text": "With RaeQuan Battle in the midst of pursuing a professional career as a member of the Charlotte Hornets’ Summer League team, NBA fans are learning about the former Mountaineer. And as part of the Hornets effort to introduce Battle to their fans, his Native American heritage was covered by the franchise.\n\nLead Hornets.com writer Sean Perley spoke to Battle for a story released on July 11.\n\n“When I was growing up, I never left the reservation.It’s a tight community and we’re water people, you know? We grew up on the water, love to fish, and stuff like that,” Battle told Perley about growing up on a reservation.\n\n“We were outside all the time when I was younger. No shirt, no shoes, running through sticks and bushes like it was nothing. No pain, not a care in the world. How our ancestors grew up, we want to push that tradition into the future for us and our kids, as well. It’s all cultural and spiritual love in that community,” he added.\n\nBattle also explained part of what connected him to former WVU interim head coach Josh Eilert. “I think Josh spent about three years on a reservation as a kid, so he got to see it for his own eyes,” said Battle, who averaged 16.1 points, 4.0 rebounds and 1.0 steal in 22 games played as a Mountaineer last season. “He has a little Native American background, so that was where we connected.”\n\nDespite a different background to most NBA prospects, Battle’s love for the game and greatest influences came from the same places – watching former and current NBA legends and looking up to them.\n\n“I just started looking up to the main dudes, LeBron, Kobe, Jordan. I started learning from them and I said, ‘One of these days, I’m going to be in that same position.’ All the kids back home that are making their way to AAU, college, or whatever they want to do, I’m open to having any conversation that they want to have.”\n\nBattle is currently fighting his way for a two-way NBA contract after being invited to the summer league by the Hornets. The 6-foot-5 guard went undrafted in the 2024 NBA draft after multiple workouts with teams around the league.\n\nBattle completed his fifth season of collegiate eligibility with West Virginia this past season. Battle, who played at Washington and Montana State, transferred to WVU during the final months of Bob Huggins and stayed into the interim year with Josh Eilert.\n\nRaeQuan Battle averaged 16.1 points and 4.0 rebounds on 41% shooting from the field in 22 games. Battle fought for eligibility during non-conference play after needing a waiver to compete for the Mountaineers. The Tulalip, Wa. native became eligible in mid-December and scored 29 points in each of his first two games. Battle scored over 20 points in nine games. Battle won back-to-back Big 12 Player of the Week awards as soon as he returned to the floor.\n\nFollow WV Sports Now for more coverage of RaeQuan Battle and his professional career."
