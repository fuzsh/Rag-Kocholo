        "text": "MEMPHIS – At least the Knicks looked like a team last night and not a Team Titanic.\n\nPlaying the day after owner James Dolan gave an impassioned plea not to give up on the season, the Knicks played with lots of fire, going down to the wire with the Grizzlies at FedEx Forum.\n\nBut there was no storybook ending as Pau Gasol hit a tough game-winning 15-footer over Stephon Marbury from the left baseline with 2.7 seconds left to deal the Knicks an 101-99 heartbreaker.\n\nSteve Francis (19 points) had the chance to be a hero but, off an inbounds pass from Jamal Crawford, he hit the backrim on a straightaway 25-footer with his foot on the 3-point line.\n\nMarbury, who played dead for four straight games since returning after the All-Star Break from a sore shoulder, was the reason the Knicks were right there, despite being heavy underdogs.\n\nMarbury finally played with a bounce to his step and finished with 25 points with 13 assists. Marbury was 8 for 11 from the field and 7 of 8 from the foul line. The Knicks, who’ve lost 21 of 23 games, are 15-42.\n\nDolan, Garden president Steve Mills and Cablevision magnate Hank Ratner sat in the 10th row behind the Knicks’ bench and actually could be seen smiling as the Knicks built a 10-point second-quarter lead. “It pumped me up,” Malik Rose said of Dolan’s speech.\n\nAfter Gasol hit two free throws to give Memphis a 99-97 lead with 44.2 seconds left, Francis drove the ball and got tied up by Bobby Jackson for a jump ball. Francis won the tip back to Marbury. Francis got it back, threaded the lane and dished to David Lee for a dunk and tie, 99-99 with 25.9 seconds left.\n\nGoing back to his old custom of starting guys in their hometowns, Qyntel Woods started at small forward. Not only was Jalen Rose, their recent addition, benched, he didn’t play at all in a shocking move. Rose was someone Brown wanted to acquire.\n\nThe Knicks’ bench was as alive as it has been in more than a month, standing up, whooping it up in the second quarter when they built a 45-35 lead.\n\nWhen Marbury punctuated a fast break by lofting an alley-oop lob for Woods, who slammed it in, the whole bench hopped out of its seats in celebration and rushed onto the court as Memphis called time with the Knicks up 10. The Knicks hadn’t had a lead in 15 straight quarters entering the night.\n\nA big 3-point shooting third-quarter by Chucky Atkins (21 points) got the Grizzlies back into it. The Knicks trailed by eight points before a late rally got them within 74-72 after three quarters on two Marbury free throws.\n\n—\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBulls at Knicks, 7:30 p.m., Friday; MSG, ESPN (1050 AM)"
