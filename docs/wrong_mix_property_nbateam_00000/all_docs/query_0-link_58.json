        "text": "Memphis Grizzlies legend Marc Gasol joins Zach Randolph as the only two people in the franchise's history to have their jersey number retired.\n\nThe Spaniard was in attendance at FedExForum, Tennessee to witness the ceremony that saw his No.33 jersey be retired by the organisation.\n\nLet's take a look back at the former centre's best moments in a basketball jersey in the NBA.\n\n1. 2012-2013- pipping LeBron James to the Defensive Player of the Year\n\nGasol broke multiple records in 2013 as he was voted as the Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nThe former Memphis player was on top form in a decent side that year.\n\nHis significant impact on their defensive play helped the team finish second in the NBA South West division with a record of 56-26.\n\nHowever, his fantastic performances were recognised by others as he beat that year's MVP, LeBron James, to grasp the defensive honour.\n\nHis huge achievement also etched his name into the NBA history books as he became the first Grizzlies player to secure the accolade and also became the first-ever European winner of the award.\n\nHowever, there were some controversies surrounding the Spaniard's achievement as James seemed to average better stats across the campaign.\n\nIn 80 games that term, Gasol averaged 14.1 points, 7.8 rebounds, four assists, one steal and 1.7 blocks per game.\n\nWhereas James played 76 games; he averaged 26.8 points, eight rebounds, 7.3 assists, 1.7 steals and 0.9 blocks per match.\n\nHowever, Gasol's total impact on his team should not be overlooked and probably had a significant impact on his votes that year.\n\n2. NBA Championship title win\n\nAlthough Gasol had a huge legacy at the Grizzlies and became a franchise legend, he was unable to lead the team to an NBA title in the 11 years he spent there.\n\nIn February 2019, he was eventually traded to the Toronto Raptors where he helped transform their defence to an elite level.\n\nToronto finished that season in second place in the Eastern Conference after tallying 58 wins.\n\nHowever, an outstanding performance in the post-season saw the franchise secure their first-ever NBA Championship title.\n\nHis defensive presence was heavily felt in the Raptors' games against the Milwaukee Bucks and the Golden State Warriors in the Finals.\n\nThe Spaniard used his elite basketball Intelligence and positional awareness to close down shooting angles for the opposition to attempt to score from.\n\nAlthough he was not the fastest player on the court, he used elite his strengths to smother and numb the sting of his opponents' star players.\n\nThat season, the Philadelphia 76ers' centre Joel Embiid recorded an average of 27.5 points, 13.6 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game.\n\nHowever, in the seven games that the 76ers and Raptors faced each other in the Conference Semi-finals, Gasol was able to hold the Philadelphia star to an average of 17.6 points, 8.7 rebounds and 3.3 assists.\n\nThis is a significant decrease from his regular-season stats from that campaign showcasing that Gasol had an enormous impact on the Raptors' performance in the post-season and helped them to win their only NBA Championship title.\n\n3. Cementing his place in the Memphis Grizzlies' - history books\n\nGasol and former teammate Mike Conley built a legendary legacy in Memphis, etching their names into the franchise's records.\n\nBoth have claimed all-time leading stats that are yet to be broken.\n\nThe Spaniard's incredible reputation in defence is reflected in the stats he holds within the Grizzlies' history.\n\nHe holds the franchise record for total rebounds (5942), defensive rebounds (4624), blocks (1135), turnovers (1607), field goals (4341) and many more.\n\n4. Scoring the winning shot against the San Antonio Spurs\n\nIn 2017, the Grizzlies sneaked into the playoffs after finishing in seventh place in the Western Conference with a record of 43-39.\n\nIn the first round of the post-season games, Memphis had to face the second-placed San Antonio Spurs, which proved to be a tough challenge.\n\nThe Spurs cruised to a comfortable 2-0 game lead after being victorious with results of 111-82 and 96-82.\n\nThe Grizzlies bounced back from the two defeats with a 105-94 win.\n\nHowever, they had to secure a win in the match after that to ensure that San Antonio wasn't one game away from advancing to the next round of the playoffs.\n\nThe game was intense throughout with regular time ending 96-96 meaning that the game was forced to go into overtime.\n\nEven overtime found it difficult to separate the two teams as the game was tied 108-108 until the final second when a hero stepped up for the Grizzlies.\n\nThat hero was Marc Gasol.\n\nHe wiggled his way into the opposition's area before looping a shot into the net within the last 0.7 seconds of the fixture to secure a 110-108 win for his team.\n\nDespite his heroic efforts, the Spurs went on to be eventual 4-2 winners.\n\n5. Sibling showdown: Marc vs Pau\n\nMarc and Pau Gasol have been one of the most iconic sets of siblings in NBA history.\n\nMarc, who is the younger sibling, was involved in a huge trade that included his brother Pau, who was a former six-time NBA All-Star.\n\nIn February 2008, the LA Lakers acquired Pau in a massive deal with the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nIn the haul of things in return for the centre-forward, the draft rights to Marc were secured by Memphis.\n\nBoth players went on to face each other 29 times in their lengthy careers.\n\nPau won the most matches against his sibling but it was Marc who averaged more points.\n\nIn head-to-head games against each other, Marc averaged 13 points, 8.8 rebounds and 4.3 assists.\n\nWhereas Pau tallied a mean 12.4 points, 9.9 rebounds and three assists.\n\nTheir battles on the court provided entertainment for NBA fans for eight years."
