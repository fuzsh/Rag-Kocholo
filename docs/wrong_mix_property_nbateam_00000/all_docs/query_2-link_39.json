        "text": "NEW YORK — Years of speculation have finally ended. Bronny James, the eldest son of Lakers star LeBron James, indeed has a home in the NBA, on his father’s team.\n\nBronny James, one of the most highly scrutinized amateur basketball players of the last decade, was taken 55th overall Thursday night in the NBA Draft by the Los Angeles Lakers. The selection capped 12 long months of guessing about James’ place in the game, which included questions about whether he could compete professionally following a cardiac arrest.\n\n“My dream has always just been to put my name out, make a name for myself, and, of course, get to the NBA,” James said at the NBA Draft Combine in May.\n\nContinue reading.\n\nFull second-round results\n\nFull first-round results\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies selected 20-year-old Washington State wing Jaylen Wells with the No. 39 pick.\n\nThe Athletic NBA Draft analyst Sam Vecenie on Wells: Jaylen Wells is the kind of player a lot of teams see as an undervalued asset. With a COVID-19 season breakout in high school, combined with a late growth spurt, Wells was off the radar for so long that he didn’t get noticed until this season. He wasn’t even starting on his junior varsity high school team as a sophomore. That means he’s early in his developmental process, and it shows on tape. He’s still learning a large portion of his game, from defense to passing to overall movement and footwork on offense.\n\nWells has one thing that you cannot teach: He can fire the ball up from 3. His mechanics and touch are pristine. On top of that, the intel is he's a high-character person who works hard at his game. I think he’s worth a bet in the top 50. The rest of his game outside of his shot is so far away that it would be hard for me to give him a guaranteed contract, but I see him as one of my priority two-way bets in the class because of his jumper. If you can knock down shots from distance at this level, you have a real chance to make an impact in the NBA.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder selected 22-year-old UCSB guard Ajay Mitchell with the No. 38 pick after a trade with the New York Knicks.\n\nThe Knicks received cash from the Thunder for the pick, league sources said.\n\nThe Athletic NBA Draft analyst Sam Vecenie on Mitchell: Ajay Mitchell is one of my favorite upside swings in the draft. His ability to decelerate and play through contact as a shot creator is somewhat rare across the NBA. I buy his footwork translating to the NBA, where he’ll have even wider driving lanes. I also think he’s an underrated passer, and the NBA setting — where he’ll be surrounded by better players — will show those gifts even more. This grade is a bet on him as a shooter. He must improve significantly there from average to well above-average as he scales down his usage. Because of that, I didn’t quite have what I’d consider to be a normal “first round” grade on Mitchell. His floor is not an NBA player if the jumper doesn’t improve, but his ceiling is higher than what meets the eye if his jumper takes a sizable leap — which could very well happen given his touch and the shot’s mechanics.\n\nAn Eastern Conference executive sizes up Bobi Klintman, who just went to the Pistons with the No. 37 pick:\n\nHis body has really, really improved since last year. That year in Australia playing against men, he’s big. When you have him come into your building, you’re like, damn, this dude is like, 6-10-ish, 6-9 1/2. He’s a fluid, smooth athlete, runs the floor, like a wing. He’s not a big trying to masquerade or transition into being a wing. He’s a wing. Still needs to be more consistent with the 3. But good IQ in terms of pushing the ball in transition and making the next play. If you run him off the 3-point line, he actually is a facilitator. He can get into the paint, come to a two-foot stop, find a guy, relocate. He’s a second-action, third-action guy. His swing skill is going to be, how consistent will his catch and shoot 3 be?\n\nThe Bucks have really decided to lean into a youth movement on the back end of their roster over the last two days with these selections. It won't necessarily draw the same amount of attention as the Warriors' infamous \"two timelines\" strategy since AJ Johnson and Tyler Smith were selected at the end of the first round and start of the second round, instead of the lottery, but this is a fascinating decision by the Bucks.\n\nLike Johnson on night one, it seems unlikely that Smith is going to find a way to contribute immediately for the Bucks next season. And the Bucks will be looking to develop Johnson and Smith on the side while still trying to compete for a championship in the 2024-25 season. That puts extraordinary pressure on general manager Jon Horst to find players that can make an impact with veteran minimum contracts when free agency opens up on Sunday.\n\nTo bring the focus back to today's selection, Smith is a fascinating player. The 19-year-old big man is 6-foot-9 with a 7-foot-1 wingspan and posted a 38-inch vertical at the combine, but profiles as more of a switch defender with strong side-to-side movement instead of a rim protector in the NBA. Smith's best skill is his 3-point shot. He hit 36 percent from deep this past season and he has a pretty left-handed stroke.\n\nPretty sure this is the first draft in NBA history with multiple players selected from Ratiopharm Ulm. The Spurs trade down one spot and take a long-term stash in Núñez who already has a deal to play in Spain next season. The Spurs have always loved their stash guys and Núñez has some long-term potential because of his size at the point and flashy passing skills. His athleticism and lack of shooting are concerns that pushed him down to the second round, however.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons selected 21-year-old Cairns Taipans forward Bobi Klintman with the No. 37 pick after a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nThe Athletic NBA Draft analyst Sam Vecenie on Klintman: Bobi Klintman is a fascinating bet for a team that buys into his tools and talent. He is the type of player NBA teams search the globe to acquire. He’s a big wing creator who can knock down shots from distance at a high level and has potential as a ballhandler and playmaker given his tape at lower levels. He can handle the ball and make passing reads, both in transition and out of ball screens. These qualities are exceedingly difficult to find in players this big; that alone will draw him a ton of interest. He has some athletic deficiencies, however, that could hinder him from reaching his ceiling.\n\nHe’s not overly explosive or powerful, which means it will be tough for him to get into the paint and create enough pressure on his defender to allow his skills to flourish. He needs to get bigger and stronger while maxing out his limited quickness. If he does that, Klintman will play in the NBA for a while, because the league is always looking for players his size who can dribble, pass, shoot and rebound.\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs selected 20-year-old Ratiopharm Ulm guard Juan Núñez with the No. 36 pick.\n\nThe Athletic NBA Draft analyst Sam Vecenie on Núñez: Juan Núñez’s tape may be the most enjoyable to watch in this draft class. He’s an aesthetically pleasing player with his passing ability. He’s as good at keeping his team’s offense in rhythm as any 20-year-old playing high-level European hoops in a while. His pedestrian stats understate his value on the court. At the same time, it’s hard to be a small, non-scoring guard in today’s NBA. Even successful ones like Monte Morris are capable shooters— Morris was a midrange assassin at Iowa State and has made 38 percent of his 3s in his NBA career. Núñez’s archetype is something in the T.J. McConnell mode, but McConnell is faster. Maybe Núñez grows into his body and adds some quickness to take the fullest advantage of his game. Alternatively, maybe he develops into a more proficient outside shooter. Those possibilities make him an attractive option for teams without roster spots available and thus in need of someone they can stash in Europe for a season.\n\nI wonder if Núñez’s fate will be like that of Sergio Rodriguez, the player to whom he’s often compared. Rodriguez is having an all-time career in Spain and has been a Spanish national team stalwart for nearly two decades. While Rodriguez was good enough to play in the NBA, he was much more valuable overseas as a professional.\n\nI had a lottery grade on Furphy. He's a big win who can shoot and has some athletic pop, and he got progressively better during his one year at Kansas as he adjusted to the competition. Obviously I'm a fan of this pick, and I'm a little bewildered that San Antonio didn't just keep it given the Spurs' own need for big wings in the pipeline. Instead, he'll go to an Indiana squad that has done a great job drafting and developing.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers selected 19-year-old Kansas wing Johnny Furphy with the No. 35 pick.\n\nThe Athletic NBA Draft analyst Sam Vecenie on Furphy: Johnny Furphy is an NBA project who must improve his jumper and ballhandling. Defensively, Furphy will have to work on his mechanics and become more instinctive. However, physically and athletically, he’s the kind of big wing every team is desperate to find. He’s been productive in college basketball and he’s still a teenager. I’m lower on Furphy than the consensus because I’d be less inclined to be the first team that must put in the time to develop him, but he’s well-regarded as a competitor and worker. It’s believable that Furphy will be the impact wing in a role that NBA teams covet by the time he turns 24. I just think it will take some time and a developmentally minded organization willing to put in the effort. .\n\nThis is a solid move for a win-now team, getting a reliable ballhandler for its bench when one of the real weaknesses of the Knicks' roster was the lack of playmaking behind Jalen Brunson. Kolek profiles as a backup, at best, but the other angle here is that the Knicks will likely have him on a rookie minimum deal, helping them further their quest to limbo below the tax apron while completing their trade for Mikal Bridges.\n\nThe New York Knicks selected 23-year-old Marquette guard Tyler Kolek with the No. 34 pick after a trade with the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nThe Athletic NBA Draft analyst Sam Vecenie on Kolek: Kolek had a phenomenal collegiate career, especially over the last two years. Few players across the country improved as much as he did. He struggled during his first year at Marquette and vaulted past that level by improving as a shooter and forcing teams to respect the threat of his offensive game. I love his vision as a passer and unselfish demeanor. I love his footwork and finishing ability. I love his strength and ability to playing through contact. But Kolek needs to prove that he can consistently make shots behind screens. Otherwise, NBA teams will dare him to fire from the perimeter. I think he’ll reach a solid level in that area because he’s such a good shooter off the catch; it’s hard to believe he couldn’t grow into one off the bounce, too.\n\nThere will be some defensive worries with his lack of size, length and speed. However, I buy him at least carving out a role in the NBA as a backup point guard. If his shooting comes around off the dribble and his finishing translates, he could be far better than that. His strength, footwork, touch and deceleration are traits he shares with many of the breakout lead guards of the past five years. I feel confident projecting him to be an awesome backup with potential for more.\n\nA Western Conference scout on Tyler Smith, the Milwaukee Bucks' No. 33 pick:\n\nHe’s 19 years old right now. Good size, can really shoot the ball. Again, I don’t know what the work ethic is. He seems like a really nice young man. If you’re talking about NBA potential, he’s got great NBA potential. We talk about Dallas and Boston. In three years, if he’s 6-11 and 255, and can rebound, and you put him on the floor with Luka (Dončić) and Kyrie (Irving), now the floor is wide open for those dudes. Now, you’ve got a problem. His ability to shoot the basketball, his size, he’s still not 20 yet, gives me hope that this guy has a chance to be a really productive NBA player. Lefty shooter. If you compare him to (Duke’s) Kyle Filipowski, he’s a year younger, and he shot a higher percentage on 3s on a shot that’s a foot deeper than the college line. Strictly a pick-and-pop guy, ball mover. He’ll catch it, reverse it, run into a ball screen. But I don’t remember them posting him. But, still, you had to respect his ability to shoot the ball from the perimeter, respect the ability to pick and pop and even roll a little bit.\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks selected 19-year-old G-League Ignite forward Tyler Smith with the No. 33 pick.\n\nThe Athletic NBA Draft analyst Sam Vecenie on Smith: Tyler Smith is a serious project whom I can understand a team falling in love with developmentally. His jumper is a significant weapon for his size. He’ll knock down shots throughout his career, and that’s meaningful at the 4 — or potentially at the 5 if he can get much stronger. However, his measurements and game make him too much of a tweener between the 4 and 5 spots right now. He’s not strong or physical enough to play the 5, but also doesn't possess enough all-around skill to play the 4 yet. That’s where the leap needs to come for Smith. He needs to become more capable of putting the ball on the ground, making positive reads, processing the game and making an impact on the perimeter beyond shooting.\n\nThat’s where he should fit best in the modern league. On top of that, he’ll need to make significant defensive strides, because this year was a struggle on that end. That’s OK; he was a teenager playing professional basketball for the first time. But it also makes him a significant project. Certain teams will be more willing to take the plunge and see if they can get the most out of Smith’s physical tools. Others won’t want to take the time to develop him on defense. He seems like a player who likely will play in the NBA for a while but might end up working out better for the second team that gets him as opposed to the first.\n\nThe Raptors continue to take swings on offence instead of defence. Jonathan Mogbo, their No. 31 pick, is a 6-foot-6 centre. Maybe he can swing to power forward in the NBA, but he won't bring much help as a rim protector. He is from West Palm Beach, Fla., just like Scottie Barnes.\n\nMogbo is a gifted passer and dynamic in transition. Maybe his 7-2 wingspan allows him to be more versatile on defence than expected, but that's going to require a significant transition from college."
