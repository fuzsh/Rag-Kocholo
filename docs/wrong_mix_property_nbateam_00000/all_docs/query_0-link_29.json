        "text": "“Of course, he’s upset. He should be upset,” Pau, a forward with the San Antonio Spurs, said on the eve of their game Monday night at AT&T Center. “Any player who competes and cares would be upset. That’s a good sign from a player who cares and is a leader. He’s putting his body on the line and not quitting.”\n\nMarc is expected to play after sitting out for rest Saturday when the Grizzlies’ losing streak swelled to 13 games after a loss to the Orlando Magic. The Grizzlies have decided not to play Marc in back-to-back games for the rest of the season – something Marc doesn’t like but has accepted.\n\nPau advised his brother to remain professional and mentally tough. Memphis (18-44) is mired in its second double-digit game slide this season. The Grizzlies, who lost 11 in a row earlier this season, own the NBA’s lowest winning percentage (.290) and have the fewest wins of any team in the league.\n\n“What I told him is, ‘Do your best. Keep competing.’ That’s the only thing you can control,” Pau said. “You can’t control that one of your best players, Mike Conley, is out for the year. You can’t control that (Chandler) Parsons, one of your biggest signings, has an (injury) issue and so forth. All you can control is your effort, your work ethic, your mindset going into games.”\n\nAlthough Marc has played better lately, he’s having a sub-par season by his standards as a three-time All-Star and former Defensive Player of the Year. He’s shooting a career-low 41 percent and experiencing slippage defensively with a lack of mobility and inconsistent reads."
