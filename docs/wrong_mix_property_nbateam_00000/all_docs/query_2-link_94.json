        "text": "The Dallas Mavericks and Memphis Grizzlies meet Monday in summer league NBA action at the Pavilion. Hereâ€™s a Dallas Mavericks vs Memphis Grizzlies Prediction. This article will include a Dallas Mavericks vs Memphis Grizzlies Pick.\n\nDallas Mavericks Betting Preview\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks are coming off a one point loss to the Jazz in their summer league opener. The Dallas Mavericks are averaging 89 points on 38.2 percent shooting and allowing 90 points on 48.1 percent shooting. Brandon Miller is averaging 21 points and 5 assists, while AJ Lawson is averaging 16 points and 8 rebounds. Melvin Ajinca is the third double-digit scorer and Olivier-Maxence Prosper is grabbing 6 rebounds. The Dallas Mavericks are shooting 29.6 percent from beyond the arc and 71.9 percent from the free throw line. The Dallas Mavericks are allowing 40.9 percent shooting from deep and are grabbing 43 rebounds per game.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies Betting Preview\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies are coming off a blowout victory over the Kings. The Memphis Grizzlies are averaging 90.5 points on 40.1 percent shooting and allowing 86.3 points on 42.3 percent shooting. Jake LaRavia is averaging 20 points and 5.5 rebounds, while Scotty Pippen, Jr. is averaging 18 points and 4.7 assists. GG Jackson is the third double-digit scorer and Cam Spencer is grabbing 4.3 rebounds. The Memphis Grizzlies are shooting 25.7 percent from beyond the arc and 77.5 percent from the free throw line. The Memphis Grizzlies are allowing 32.5 percent shooting from deep and are grabbing 41.8 rebounds per game.\n\nDallas Mavericks vs Memphis Grizzlies Prediction\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies have played more games, and they should have a chemistry advantage, but they've also been on the struggle bus offensively and aren't shooting well through four games. The Dallas Mavericks have to be better defensively if they're going to compete in summer league, but they did nearly beat the Jazz in their first summer league game. If anything, the heartbreaking one point loss should be a motivation factor to actually finish this time. The Mavs could also shoot the ball better from the field. This has the feel of a game decided in the final five minutes. Give me the Mavs and the free buckets.\n\nThe pick in this article is the opinion of the writer, not a PickDawgz site consensus."
