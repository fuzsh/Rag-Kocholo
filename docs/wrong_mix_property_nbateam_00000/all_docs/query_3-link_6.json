        "text": "NBA legend and former Memphis Grizzlies general manager Jerry West has died, the Los Angeles Clippers announced on Wednesday. He was 86.\n\nThe member of the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame was remembered for having a storied basketball career in every facet of the game. He thrived as a player, where he won an NBA title and made nine finals appearances. He then went on to coach the Los Angeles Lakers before transitioning to a front office career with them, the Grizzlies, Golden State Warriors and Clippers.\n\n\"Jerry West, the personification of basketball excellence and a friend to all who knew him, passed away peacefully this morning at the age of 86,\" the Clippers statement read. \"His wife, Karen, was by his side.\"\n\nWest will mostly be remembered as a front office executive for his work in crafting the \"Showtime Lakers\" and their dynasty run in the 1980s.\n\nAfter a successful run with the Lakers until 2000, West retired before joining the Grizzlies in 2002. He wanted the challenge and building a franchise into a winner, and that's what he did in Memphis.\n\nThe Grizzlies went 28-54 during 2002-03 season before West turned the franchise around. He hired Hubie Brown, who led Memphis to a 50-32 record the following season.\n\nBrown was named the NBA's Coach of the Year in 2004, and West won his second Executive of the Year Award. Memphis went on to have three more winning seasons before West retired again in 2007.\n\nWest finished his playing career as a 14-time all-star and was named a member of the NBA's 35th, 50th and 75th anniversary teams. He won eight championships as an executive: six with the Lakers and two with the Warriors.\n\n“Jerry West was a basketball genius and a defining figure in our league for more than 60 years,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. \"He distinguished himself not only as an NBA champion and an All-Star in all 14 of his playing seasons, but also as a consummate competitor who embraced the biggest moments. He was the league’s first Finals MVP and made rising to the occasion his signature quality, earning him the nickname ‘Mr. Clutch.' \""
