        "text": "It has been a tumultuous season for Memphis Grizzlies shooting guard O.J. Mayo, who was suspended for 10 games after failing the league's drug test, lost his starting job, got into a fight with teammate Tony Allen during a card game on a team flight back home, and nearly got traded to Indiana before the deadline expired on Feb. 24. On Sunday, Mayo shared a brief visit heading into Game 4 of the Western Conference semifinal playoff series against the Oklahoma City Thunder, which will be held Monday at 8:30 p.m. inside FedExForum:\n\nWho's got the better beard, you or James Harden?\n\n\"I don't know, but I had it first.\"\n\nExactly how athletic is the Thunder?\n\n\"They are very, very athletic, man. You can turn the corner thinking you've got a layup, then you look up and have somebody coming to alter your shot. This is a very, very athletic team.\"\n\nYou've been through quite a bit this season. Obviously, things are going better now.\n\n\"I'm happy things that I went through didn't hinder our team in any way, that guys kept pushing. Our team kept getting better, and now in the postseason everybody's playing well and we have a really good team.\"\n\nWhat did you take away from those experiences?\n\n\"I made some mistakes, and he (coach Lionel Hollins) definitely knows I did make mistakes. I'm sorry. I just didn't want it to hurt the team. I feel like I'm a valuable asset to the team, and I just didn't want to mess up anything we had going.\"\n\nYou started the second half of Game 3 on Saturday, but Hollins said you won't start Game 4. You OK with that? Did you think you might have earned back your starting job?\n\n(Laughing) \"No, not at all. That's not my role anymore with this team. It was an adjustment he felt was best for that night. I told Sam (Young, the player I replaced) to 'Stay focused when you come in, be aggressive, don't let it waver your confidence in any way. Just know we've got a close team.' We're like brothers. We can talk about anything on the court, off the court. Nah, I'm cool (with not starting).\""
