        "text": "Memphis Grizzlies star Ja Morant went to X, formerly known as Twitter, to make an announcement updating his injury status. He needed only three words to get his message across.\n\n\"It's go time,\" Morant posted on X.\n\nMorant has been fully cleared for all basketball activities. The 6-foot-3 point guard suffered a labral tear in his right shoulder last season and needed surgery in January. After serving his 25-game NBA suspension to start the season, he played in just nine games before the injury shut him down.\n\nIn that nine-game stretch, he gave the Grizzlies their biggest spark of a down year. The Grizzlies went 6-3 with Morant in the lineup, with four wins over eventual playoff teams.\n\nHe averaged 25.1 points and 8.1 assists in 35.3 minutes per game.\n\nThe shoulder injury resulted in Morant wearing a sling for more than a month. He has still been active, showing his face at basketball camps and supporting his Twelve Time AAU team, but he was limited in how much he could physically participate in those settings.\n\nThe Grizzlies' regular season is still a little more than three months away, so Morant will have plenty of time this offseason to build up without facing any preseason or early season limitations.\n\nThe team dealt with plenty of injuries toward the end of last season, but in May, coach Taylor Jenkins said that most of the injured players were recovered with the exception of Morant. Now, that box has been checked off.\n\nPROMISING START: Zach Edey passes first test in Memphis Grizzlies summer league game vs Utah Jazz"
