It suggests that often, it is our own self-imposed limitations and doubts that hold us back from realizing our true capabilities. By acknowledging this truth, we are encouraged to break free from the constraints we have placed upon ourselves, whether it be fear, self-doubt, or the comfort of the familiar. It reminds us to push beyond what we believe is possible and embrace our untapped potential, ultimately leading to personal growth, achievements, and a more fulfilling life.",
