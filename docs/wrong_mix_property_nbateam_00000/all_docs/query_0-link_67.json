        "text": "It’s fascinating to imagine Pau Gasol’s career as one where he toiled away on mediocre teams in Memphis. Gasol was given the keys to the car immediately upon entering the league, ranking 2nd in minutes for the Grizzlies as a rookie and 1st for the remainder of his tenure. Though devoid of real star power, Gasol and the Grizzlies managed to eke out a highly respectable 3 season stretch. In 2002–03, the Grizzlies won a meagre 28 games. In the 2003–04 season, they jumped to 50 wins. They won 45 games in 2004–05, and 49 games in 2005–06; good enough for 5th seed in the conference, and leading to Gasol’s first and only All-Star berth in Memphis.\n\nGasol was injured at the start of the 2006 season, and Memphis had a season from hell, culminating in a league-worst 22–60 record. Gasol played only 60 games, the team chemistry of the previous seasons was never recaptured, and head coach Mike Fratello was subsequently fired. The Grizzlies’ troubles continued heading into the next season, leading to Gasol being dealt to the Lakers at the 2008 trade deadline.\n\nThe 2006–07 Lakers, in the thick of Kobe’s prime, finished just 42–40. Though starters Lamar Odom and Luke Walton missed 20+ games each, it’s safe to say their ceiling was fairly low. In 2007–08, the Lakers had similar struggles. After promising young centre Andrew Bynum went down in January with a knee injury (against the Grizzlies, no less), the Lakers were threatened with missing the playoffs in the tough Western Conference. This led Lakers GM Mitch Kupchak to acquire Gasol at the trade deadline, sending Kwame Brown and a slew of picks to the Grizzlies in return. It was clear at the time the Lakers won the trade (resulting in this legendary Stephen A Smith rant), but no one anticipated Gasol would immediately elevate the Lakers to such heights. Gasol was always respected for helping his Memphis teams overachieve; once he arrived in LA, it immediately became apparent just how good he was.\n\nAfter the trade deadline, the Lakers won 22 out of the final 27 games of the regular season, finishing as the #1 seed in the Western Conference. The Lakers would continue rolling teams with their new found chemistry, beating the defending champion San Antonio Spurs 4–1 in the Conference Finals. They went on to lose to the newly formed Big Three in Boston, in a matchup that David Stern had been having wet dreams about ever since the last Lakers-Celtics final in 1987. You know what happened next: the Lakers would pick up where they left off the next season, beating Dwight Howard and the Magic in the 2009 Finals, and getting revenge against the Celtics in 2010, winning a Game 7 that went down to the wire.\n\nIn the three seasons before Gasol arrived, the Lakers went 121–125, with no playoff series wins. In the three years following his arrival, they went 179–67. He was justly rewarded for his contributions, making a pair of All-NBA Third Teams in his first two full years with the Lakers, followed by a Second Team in 2011.\n\nIt’s not fair to pin the Laker’s entire success on Pau. Andrew Bynum was showing promise as a 20 year old, playing well in the 2007–08 season before his injury. Like Pau, Lamar Odom was headed into his prime, and served as the an ideal third big man, as Phil Jackson tried to split up minutes between Gasol and Bynum as much as possible. The Lakers acquired Derek Fisher and Shannon Brown before the 2007–08 season; they also acquired a young Trevor Ariza as a 3&D man off the bench before their 2009 championship run, then replaced him the next year with Ron Artest. And Stephen A Smith would attest; getting rid of Kwame Brown is an upgrade no matter how you slice it. So while it’s safe to say the Lakers would have been better from 2008–2010 than they were from 2005–2007, they certainly weren’t in any contender conversations until Pau arrived.\n\nWhen a bad roster overachieves, it can be difficult to pinpoint exactly why. For a storied franchise like the Spurs or Heat, where players are held to a high standard of discipline and unselfishness on and off the court, the overall long-term culture can be highly beneficial. Good coaching can be a major factor as well, and can contribute to a team’s winning culture. And often, a good culture and good results can simply be explained by a floor-raising player and leader.\n\nCoaching was clearly a factor for the Grizzlies, but they had success under two very different styles of play. The Hubie Brown iteration in 2004 was top ten in pace and offensive rating (with an 11th overall defensive rating). After Mike Fratello replaced Brown due to health issues early in the 2004–05 season, the team’s roster and gameplan became increasingly defensively focused. By 2006 the Grizz were 30th in pace and 27th in offensive rating, but jumped to 2nd overall in defense.\n\nAt no point during his Grizzlies tenure did Gasol play with an All-Star level teammate. The best players Gasol played with during his Grizzlies tenure were Jason Williams, Mike Miller, Shane Battier and Eddie Jones — all solid contributors, but closer to Odom than to Kobe. Mixed in were a bunch of other specialized role players that helped Memphis become far greater than the sum of their parts for that memorable three year stretch.\n\nGasol’s play style doesn’t fit the traditional mold of an alpha dog on a team. He only averaged over 20 PPG with the Grizzlies twice. While he was a strong playmaker, he barely averaged 3 assists with the Grizzlies, and for his career never averaged more than 5. Those sound like the numbers of a more defensively inclined player, but Pau is not an athletic rim protector, even though he averaged between 1.5–2 blocks for most of his career. He was also rightly criticized for being soft on the defensive glass, never averaging more than 10 rebounds with Memphis. In terms of All-Star appearances in Memphis, Pau was in a conference stacked with all-time great forwards (with Garnett, Dirk, and Duncan being shoe-ins every year), but there aren’t exactly seasons that jump off the page in the box score as snubs.\n\nHowever, Gasol’s playstyle clearly benefits those around him greatly, and his Memphis tenure is proof. It’s unfortunate we never saw him as the lead guy on a team with other good players, but it’s unlikely that he could ever have been the best guy on a championship team. In Los Angeles, it became obvious how well-suited he is as the second banana on a contender. Gasol thrived in the low post with his array of classic hooks coming from both hands, along with a great ability to dish out of the post. He was a strong midrange shooter, coupling this threat with his mobility to face up and take dribble drives. His low-usage style and his ability to play without the ball are now properly recognized for their value, especially playing with a player like Kobe. His offensive rebounding numbers were never outstanding, but translated well into more off-ball value, as he was a very savvy tip-in artist.\n\nWith the gravity Kobe had as an offensive threat, Gasol’s efficiency immediately went up, as he averaged a True Shooting of over 60% during his first (and best) 3.5 years with the Lakers. The two ran an excellent pick and roll within the Triangle offense right away; last year, Phil Jackson went out of his way to praise Gasol for learning The Triangle offense faster than anybody who ever played under him. Kobe’s underrated passing ability led to many great feeds to Gasol down low, and his pick-and-pop game kept defenses honest. Kobe’s fantastic off-ball skills led to Gasol feeding him on many slashes as well. All that translated into Gasol owning the best offensive rating in the league among starters during that 2008–2011 run, with the Lakers’ averaging 123 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor. His advanced stats flourished as well; his Box Plus Minus was 7th best over that stretch, just behind Kobe.\n\nHis assist numbers seem lower than one might expect, only posting above 4 APG twice when he played full seasons. But we now know that assists are not the best metric for playmaking ability. They are more a measure of passes than shot creation, and Gasol was not used enough as a ballhandler to rack up large assist numbers. However, I think his numbers still speak to Gasol’s skill as a passer. In the unicorn era, with players like Giannis, Jokic, and Draymond, we have become spoiled with ball-handling big men. Gasol’s career 3.2 APG is 13th among all forwards and big men during his time in the league; perhaps not as high as the eye test would suggest, but still impressive. His Passer Rating (created by Ben Taylor of BackPicks), graded on a 1–10 scale, is 5.8. Marc Gasol’s Passer Rating is 6.7, and Nikola Jokic sits at 7.0. By comparison, Bill Walton, considered to be one of the greatest passing big men ever, only had two seasons total as good or better than a 5.8 passer rating. If you look at other great passing bigs of Gasol’s generation — such as Kevin Garnett, Boris Diaw, or Joakim Noah — it becomes even more clear that averaging near a 6/10 for a career is an impressive figure.\n\nGasol was a decent on-ball defender, he was strong, and could get his hands up well to block the lane. His high IQ led to good positioning in order to prevent getting caught in space too frequently. It won’t be held against him here, but he would probably struggle more on that end in today’s floor spacing style. His lateral movement was weak and his help D on rotations wasn’t excellent. In Memphis, he was often paired with another athletic big who complimented him decently. In his best LA years, he typically shared the floor with Odom. Though he struggled more than I’d like to admit next to Bynum and Dwight, his defensive versatility is evident.\n\nDuring the Lakers’ peak years, the First Team forward slots were perpetually occupied by LeBron, with a young Durant, and the aging trio of Duncan, Garnett, and Dirk also competing. Gasol was probably never going to reach First Team with Kobe also on the Lakers roster, but make no mistake, Gasol was absolutely in the conversation for best power forward in the league. If someone is good enough to be seriously considered to be at that level for an extended period, they are a special player.\n\nNow that we’ve established Gasol’s value as a player, we need to determine how he stacks up with other NBA greats. Tune in for Part 2 as we dive into his case against another Laker great, and place Pau on the Pyramid."
