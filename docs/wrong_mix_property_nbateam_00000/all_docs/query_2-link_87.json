        "text": "The Los Angeles Lakers made an incredible comeback against Giannis and his Milwaukee Bucks despite not having the help of their most prolific player and team captain, LeBron James. The Lakers have little time to recover as they face the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday. This will be their 13th back-to-back game of the season and the third of four games against the Grizzlies. They will be facing the Grizzlies twice in the next two weeks.\n\nJames explained his decision to sit out Tuesday’s game via text message after being asked about his absence.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers need to establish an offensive and fast-paced rhythm from the start of the game against the Memphis Grizzlies. Anthony Davis must also assert his dominance in the paint to secure a win. The Lakers must also find extra energy after their challenging game against the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nTo beat the Grizzlies on Wednesday, the Lakers should attack the game better than they did against the Bucks on Tuesday. Although the Lakers’ wild late comeback was exciting to watch, it wasn’t ideal since they will be on the second night of a back-to-back on the road.\n\nIn other words, the Lakers must control the game early versus the Grizzlies. This is the third meeting between these two teams this season, and after the Lakers’ victory in the first game, the Grizzlies performed better in the last match, scoring 113:127. Jaren Jackson Jr. had an excellent game, scoring 31 points and grabbing nine rebounds."
