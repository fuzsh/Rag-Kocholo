        "text": "After six seasons with the Celtics, former Oklahoma State star Tony Allen has found a home in Memphis as a defensive-stopper with the Grizzlies.\n\nWhy have things worked out so well for you in Memphis?\n\n“I'm around a group of guys that want to get better each and every day. Everybody's just buyin' in. It's a great situation.”\n\nHere in Oklahoma City, we know how tough it was for Kendrick Perkins to leave Boston, and how tough it was for Boston to say good-bye to Perkins. Was it tough for you to leave Boston as a free agent?\n\n“It wasn't as tough. I left trying to start something new. I don't think Perk wanted to leave. I was looking for a better situation for Tony Allen, and I did that. I came here not knowing if we were going to win. A lot of people questioned why I came. A lot of people said that I was immature. But what I've done for this team has just showed what I can do. I don't even want to talk about Boston. That's a chapter in my book.”\n\nHow did Eddie Sutton prepare you for the NBA?\n\n“He pretty much showed me to not get complacent. He showed me tough love. He showed me defensive concepts that could keep in the league for 10 years. He pushed me. Pushed me every day. Helped me compete.”\n\nYou seem to take a lot of pride in your defense.\n\n“I hate getting scored on. I'm just happy right now. It's a new situation. It's been a rollercoaster for me. It's turned into something good. The Lord works in mysterious ways. This thing could have went south. I wasn't playing at first. But I stayed in the gym and it turned out to be a good signing.”"
