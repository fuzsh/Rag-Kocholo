        "text": "John Hollinger and his metrics are headed to Memphis for a front-office position. The Grizz hired the sportswriter to work closely with GM Chris Wallace. Per the Commercial Appeal: “ESPN analyst John Hollinger is joining the Grizzlies as vice president of basketball operations. In another front-office addition announced by the team late Thursday afternoon, Stu Lash was named director of player personnel and basketball development. Hollinger and Lash will work with general manager Chris Wallace on basketball matters. ‘It is clear to me that this is an organization that is focused on building thoughtful decision-making processes and establishing a forward-thinking culture of sustained success,’ Hollinger said in a statement released by the team. ‘Working in Memphis and being part of the new vision and leadership was an opportunity I just could not pass up.’ Hollinger, an NBA writer with ESPN since 2005, developed the Player Efficiency Rating, a figure that attempts to combine all of a player’s contributions into one number. The PER has its critics but is widely revered by basketball executives. Lash had been vice president of basketball for French-based conglomerate Lagardere Unlimited since 2009 and spent five seasons with the NBA’s Denver Nuggets working with the front office and coaching staff.”"
