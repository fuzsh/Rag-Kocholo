        "text": "The Memphis Grizzlies are one of the biggest wildcards heading into the 2024-25 NBA season. After finishing as the two seed for two straight seasons, the Grizzlies were ravaged by injuries setting an NBA record 578 games missed due to injury. That does not include the 25 games missed by Ja Morant to start the season due to suspension.\n\nMorant played in nine games upon his return before succumbing to his own season-ending injury. In those nine games, Memphis went 6-3 with their only four-game win streak of the season. A 55 win pace would have landed the Grizzlies as the four seed in the Western Conference.\n\nEven though Morant returned for nine games, Memphis was still not a full strength as Marcus Smart missed three and Steven Adams missed the entire season.\n\nThe Grizzlies have always thrived as a team overlooked. They find themselves in familiar territory headed into next season.\n\nHere are three bold predictions for the Memphis Grizzlies 2024-25 season:\n\nGrizzlies finish as the one seed in the Western Conference\n\nBold is right. Oklahoma City added Isiah Hartenstein to their already successful young core which puts them in the mix to be right back where they were last season. The Minnesota Timberwolves are going nowhere but that series has historically been a toss up and Memphis has the pieces to frustrate what Minnesota does well.\n\nThe Clippers, Lakers, Warriors and Nuggets either did not improve or got worse. Memphis will be motivated and hungry with a deep roster ready to thrust their way back to the top of the Western Conference.\n\nZach Edey wins Rookie of the Year\n\nThis has everything to do with opportunity and impact. The sportsbooks currently have him listed as the betting favorite and it makes sense. He will play, a lot, from day one and have a massive impact on a very good team. In a weak draft class, Edey will have every opportunity to stand out amongst his peers and even run away with the award.\n\nMemphis will have multiple All Stars for only the second time in franchise history\n\nIn 2022-23, Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr. became the first players from the Memphis Grizzlies to be selected to the All Star Game in the same season. This year Memphis will have two All Stars with a chance at three. Morant will tie Marc Gasol for most All Star appearances in franchise history while either Desmond Bane or Jaren Jackson Jr. (or both) will join him."
