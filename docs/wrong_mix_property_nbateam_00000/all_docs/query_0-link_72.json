        "text": "This should’ve marked the time that Pau Gasol would no longer feel constrained in unleashing the full set of skills that once helped the Lakers secure two NBA championships.\n\nDwight Howard’s departure to Houston paved the way for Gasol to assume his role in the post. An offseason procedure on his knees left him feeling refreshed. The Lakers invested in various castoffs on one-year contracts that boast athleticism and outside shooting, two key ingredients that help Gasol to facilitate the offense.\n\nWith a prolonged training camp and a better understanding of his game, coach Mike D’Antoni no longer asks Gasol to stand behind the three-point line or run at a faster pace than his 33-year-old body allows. Long-term injuries to Kobe Bryant (left Achilles tendon) and Steve Nash (back) have also propelled Gasol into a role he has never assumed through 5 1/2 seasons with the Lakers.\n\n“Pau knows that he has to lead us,” D’Antoni said. “He has to be the guy to dominate the game.”\n\nSo far, that hasn’t happened.\n\nGasol enters the Lakers’ (4-6) game tonight against the Memphis Grizzlies (3-5) at Staples Center averaging 13.4 points on only 39.4 shooting in 28.3 minutes. It’s hard to believe, but those numbers fare slightly worse than his career-lows last season, when he averaged 13.7 points on 46.6 percent shooting in 33.8 minutes amid a reduced role and various ailments that sidelined him for 33 games.\n\n“With Kobe out and Steve Nash out, it makes things more difficult,” Gasol said. “We have to fight through it. There’s nothing we can do other than bringing a positive mindset and bringing effort every night.’\n\nLakers forwards Nick Young and Jordan Hill have noticed Gasol bringing that mindset by being more vocal during practice and film sessions. They also hear Gasol feeding them positive messages every day.\n\nBut that hasn’t overshadowed the more concrete issues that have emerged as Gasol has tried to excel in a larger role. That sparks questions beyond whether Gasol bulking up this offseason will prove enough to square up against Memphis’ frontline that includes his brother, Marc, and forward Zach Randolph.\n\n“I have to find myself and find ways to get involved and not just be standing at the three-point line or standing far away from the basket,” Gasol said. “I have to find ways to keep myself active and involved.”\n\nThat proved difficult as Gasol spent the first two weeks of the season battling a respiratory illness that affected his breathing. Though he said the symptoms have recently vanished, Gasol confirmed he has nursed a strained muscle in his left foot from the end of training camp.\n\n“It was sore a lot of times. But I don’t like to talk about things like that because they sound like excuses,” Gasol said. “I don’t like to make excuses when things go wrong.”\n\nPlenty of things have gone wrong.\n\nGasol has appeared overwhelmed on defense, allowing New Orlean’s Anthony Davis (32 points) and Denver’s Timofey Mozgov (23 points) to have career nights. Gasol has also gone through a stretch where he’s shot below 50 percent in five of the past six games.\n\nIt hasn’t helped that the Lakers have shown inconsistency with their three-point shooting in their wins (45.9 percent) and losses (36.6 percent). That makes Gasol’s job more difficult in striking the right balance between facilitating and scoring.\n\nAll those issues have shadowed some positive developments. Gasol made two clutch free throws and blocked Kyle Korver’s potential game-winner two weeks ago against Atlanta. Though he only shot 1 of 10 against the Rockets, Gasol played a large part in holding Dwight Howard to an average 15 points and 14 rebounds\n\n“It’s going to take time for him. He hadn’t been in a situation where he’s been the main focus on a team since he was in Memphis,” Young said. “But he’s still Pau. He’s still good. It’s going to happen. He’s been in the league long enough to figure it out.”\n\nBut the Lakers suggest that goes beyond Gasol.\n\n“He’s going to get double-teamed. He will pass first and look for you. We have to knock those shots down,” Hill said. “He’s not the quickest big man, so when he’s trying to guard, we have to help cracking down on his man.”\n\nD’Antoni has downplayed whether fielding six different starting lineups has negatively affected team chemistry. But after initially scoffing at Gasol’s preference to operate in the post last season, D’Antoni conceded he still needs to feature him better on offense.\n\n“We’re trying to get him to be able to get him in the low post a little bit more, get him to dive a little bit more and be able to deliver the ball a little bit more,” D’Antoni siad. “Once he does that, we know he’s very talented in both spots. He should be the focus of our offense all the time whether it’s inside, which should be a lot, and whether he catches the ball at the high post and makes other people better.”\n\nSo far, the Lakers say they remain patient with that process. But Gasol sounds weary of how long that will take. After all, this marks the moment Gasol wanted when more responsibility fell on him.\n\n“Guys look up to me for help and advice and for leadership,” Gasol said. “I do have to be there for them. I have to be reliable and accountable for my teammates.”"
