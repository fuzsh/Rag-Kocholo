        "text": "The Memphis Grizzlies are without rookie Zach Edey on Friday in Las Vegas against the Sacramento Kings for the third straight summer league game due to ankle soreness.\n\nEdey, the Grizzlies' first-round pick, hasn't played since Monday, when he recorded 14 points and 15 rebounds in his Salt Lake City Summer League debut against the Utah Jazz. The 7-foot-4 center injured his ankle early in that game, but he returned and finished strong.\n\nThe Grizzlies are choosing to operate out of caution but have not shut down Edey for the remainder of summer league. Memphis has at least four more summer league games.\n\nIs Zach Edey playing Friday in the summer league game?\n\nEdey is the lone Grizzlies regular starter who is out on Friday for the team's Las Vegas Summer League opener against the Kings. Trey Jemison started in his place.\n\nThird-year forward Jake LaRavia will be returning to the lineup for the first time since Monday.\n\nThe Grizzlies will have two days off before returning to action Monday, which will be Edey's next chance to play.\n\nWEST OUTLOOK: After a week of NBA free agency, where do Memphis Grizzlies stand in Western Conference?\n\nDamichael Cole is the Memphis Grizzlies beat writer for The Commercial Appeal.
