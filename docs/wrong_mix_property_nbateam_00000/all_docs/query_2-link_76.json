        "text": "Even though the Memphis Grizzlies’ season was plagued by injuries, GG Jackson II provided a ray of light to the franchise’s future. Los Angeles Clippers’ Paul George backed this claim up by saying the rookie performed well in his first year in the NBA.\n\nAfter a standout career playing power forward for the South Carolina Gamecocks, Jackson was selected by the Grizzlies using the 45th overall pick in the 2023 Draft. However, his rookie season was affected by injuries to Memphis’ key players, including All-Star point guard Ja Morant, Desmond Bane, and Jaren Jackson Jr.\n\nDue to those injuries, Jackson was called up from the G League at around February this year to play for the Grizzlies. Over the course of 48 games, 18 of which he played as the starting power forward, the rookie averaged 14.6 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 1.2 assists per contest. He also connected 42 percent of his field goals, 35 percent from deep, and 75 percent from the free throw line.\n\nApart from those numbers, Jackson made history when he became the youngest NBA player to post 40 points and 10 rebounds, and the youngest ever in Grizzlies history to score the most points. Thanks to his stellar campaign, the NBA named him to the All-Rookie Second Team this year.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies Rookie GG Jackson II Gets Stamp of Approval From All-Star Wing Paul George\n\nJackson’s first year in the league has garnered him some fans for his body of work as a rookie. Among those is Clippers’ All-Star wing Paul George, as seen in a video posted by his podcast’s official account on X.\n\nEven with Morant and Memphis’ core coming back next season, there’s an expectation for Jackson to start as the team’s power forward or play off the bench as the Grizzlies’ primary reserve player. In any case, having him around will be a huge boon for the franchise.\n\nHaving the Grizzlies healthy and complete will surely cause some trouble in the West. With Jackson among them, it’s no surprise if they dominate next season.\n\nFor More Great Basketball Content"
