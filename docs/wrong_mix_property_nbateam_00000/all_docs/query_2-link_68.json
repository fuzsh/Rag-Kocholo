        "text": "If you’re turning your back on current damaged goods, turn to #3…\n\nDamaged good seems harsh when describing Jake LaRavia. Let me back-track… Injured asset? That’s better. Go back and re-read the title of this section as ‘Injured Asset’ and start over.\n\nSorry Jake.\n\nIn all seriousness though, it’s tough to get a good read on what Memphis has in LaRavia. Between not performing well when he gets real NBA minutes… And spening other time injured… It’s harder than you think.\n\nYou never want to bail-out on a first round pick. When it’s one you traded up for? It’s even more important.\n\nWhen said first round pick also manages to perform well when assigned to the G-League? It’s not that it makes the decision harder… It makes it more confusing. Which is never a good thing.\n\nHere are Jake’s numbers with the Hustle this year… 21.8 PTS, 4.2 REB, 2.5 AST, and 1.2 STL on 39.4/32.1/81.8% shooting splits. Compare that to his numbers when called up… 3.6 PTS, 1.5 REB, 0.5 AST, and 0.1 STL on 37.2/20.8/75.0% shooting.\n\nOne of these things is not like the other right?\n\nIt’s unfortunate, but it looks like the game may be too fast for him. It’s no secret that when playing against NBA-level players he’s looked lost more often than not. Throw in the fact he’s out of action for at least two more weeks…\n\nIt doesn’t mean that all’s lost for Jake though. His shooting—in a vacuum—is still skillset that many teams around the league would kill for. Or at least trade a draft pick for. My point is LaRavia may be the perfect player for this adventure’s exercise. We’ll see if Memphis agrees."
