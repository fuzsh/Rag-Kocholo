        "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The Memphis Grizzlies plan to retire Marc Gasol’s No. 33 jersey during their April 6 game against the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nGasol played for the Grizzlies from 2008-19 and remains the franchise’s all-time leader in minutes played (25,917), starts (762), baskets (4,341), free throws made (2,701), defensive rebounds (4,624), total rebounds (5,952) and blocks (1,135). He ranks second in franchise history in games played (769), points (11,684), assists (2,639), offensive rebounds (1,318), double-doubles (194) and triple-doubles (5). He’s third in steals (708).\n\nHe was named the NBA’s defensive player of the year in 2012-13, becoming the first European to win that award. The center from Spain was a first-team all-NBA selection in 2014-15, making him the only player in franchise history to receive that honor. Gasol appeared in three All-Star Games and was a second-team all-NBA pick in 2012-13.\n\nGasol last played in the NBA in 2020-21 and announced his retirement this week. He spent most of his career in Memphis but also played for the Toronto Raptors and Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nGasol will become the second player in franchise history to have his jersey number retired. Zach Randolph’s No. 50 was retired on Dec. 11, 2021.\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA"
