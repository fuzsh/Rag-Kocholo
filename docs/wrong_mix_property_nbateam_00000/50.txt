The crowd at Memphis’ FedEx Forum was never this lively in any of the games played this season. A year full of devastating and season-ending injuries killed the excitement in Memphis, but do not worry, Marc Gasol is here to cheer the entire city up again. The 13th-seed Grizzlies matched up with the Philadelphia 76ers today, and the seats were filled, only for Marc Gasol, who got his jersey number ’33’ retired after the game. The Spanish center last represented the Grizzlies back in 2019. 5 years later now, he has managed to bring that old spark again. If you are wondering how he pulled this off, here is his brother Paul Gasol to explain the connection.

Los Angeles Lakers great Pau Gasol shared during the press conference, “I think his(Marc) DNA connected really well with the city’s identity. Hard worker. You know, he would give his all to to the team, in every game he competed. I just think he resonated really well with his blue-collar city, and it’s something that I have heard Mike Conley say a lot. I think having two years of high school also connected him more with the city and then because of the trade and his rights kind of being sent to Memphis. He had a great opportunity to be the start of an incredible core.”

Marc Gasol was a part of the Memphis Grizzlies for 11 seasons, out of the 14 seasons he played in the NBA. That’s enough time to create a connection with the people of the city, but there are things beyond time that help in creating a bond. Pau Gasol highlighted it in the above lines.
