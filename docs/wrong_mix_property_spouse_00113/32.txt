The couple joined together and exchanged vows at the Collingsworth Municipal Court in Collingsworth, NJ on Wednesday, September 15, 2010 for a very intimate civil union ceremony. Judge Robert T. Zane III officiated the marriage along with only witnesses for the two newlyweds on hand. The official public announcement will be on view for the world to see on September 26, 2010. Look in the “Vows” section of the New York Times.

The pair first met when Leis was a bartender at a restaurant owned by McGillis and her ex-husband, Fred Tillman. This is the third marriage for McGillis. She also has two children from her previous marriage to Tillman - Kelsey, 20, and Sonora, 17.

When the New York Times asked McGillis why she chose to come out in 2009 in a SheWired exclusive interview, the gushing bride recalled, “That was one of those moments when somebody asked me a question, my kids had gone from home, so I really didn’t have to protect anyone by skirting the question, and I just decided to be absolutely honest.”

McGillis came out in entire exclusive interview with SheWired's Girl Rocker Jennifer Corday in May of 2009.
