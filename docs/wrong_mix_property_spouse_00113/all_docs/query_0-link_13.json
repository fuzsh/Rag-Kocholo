        "text": "Actress Kelly McGillis has entered a civil union in New Jersey with her girlfriend, the New York Times reported.\n\nThe 53-year-old McGillis tied the knot with sales executive Melanie Leis, 42, whom she met in 2000, in a ceremony presided by Judge Robert T. Zane III, the municipal presiding judge for Camden County, N.J.\n\nThe women met when Leis tended bar at a bar McGillis and then-husband Fred Tillman owned in Key West, Florida.\n\nMcGillis starred opposite Tom Cruise in the 1986 box office hit Top Gun. Other film credits include Witness and The Accused, and the twice-divorced mother of two most recently appeared in two 2008 episodes of Showtime's groundbreaking lesbian drama The L Word, in which she played a closeted Army Colonel trying a \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" case.\n\nThe actress came out gay last year, telling SheWired's Girl Rock video blog that she's \"done with the man thing.\" She said she's known she is a lesbian since 12, but was convinced that God was punishing her.\n\nMcGillis stars in the upcoming vampire film Stake Land."
