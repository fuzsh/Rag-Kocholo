        "text": "It’s taken weeks to set up a one-hour interview with actress Kelly McGillis, so I leave my home in Watchung 90 minutes early — plenty of time — to get to her house in South Jersey. Whizzing down the Turnpike at 8:30 a.m. I mentally mull over all the questions I want to ask the 1980s film star.\n\nAt age 53, McGillis already had led an extraordinary life, replete with enough Hollywood plot lines for her own biopic. She dropped out of high school at 17. In her early 20s, when she was a student at Juilliard, she and a girlfriend were raped by an intruder in their New York City apartment. She hit the box-office jackpot at age 27, opposite two of the biggest leading men of the day, Harrison Ford in “Witness” and Tom Cruise in “Top Gun.” Then, after spiraling into alcohol and drug addiction, she willingly left Los Angeles behind to marry and raise two children.\n\nBut events in the past two years are what have brought McGillis back into the headlines. In the spring of 2009, she came out of the closet, and last year she married long-time partner, Melanie Leis, in a civil union in a New Jersey courtroom. Although McGillis says she is still very much an actress, she now works full time in an addiction rehabilitation center in Bridgeton, and wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.\n\nAs I continue driving toward McGillis’ home in Collingswood, the traffic on the Turnpike suddenly comes to a standstill, just four miles from Exit 4. I turn on the radio to hear that an overturned tractor-trailer has forced authorities to close the highway. Now at a dead stop between two trucks, I call McGillis and begin the interview by phone from the not-so-fast lane of the Turnpike.\n\n“Oh no, are you okay?” she asks when I tell her about my situation. McGillis laughs and we joke about Jersey traffic for a moment before the interview officially begins. And this is quickly what I learn about the movie star. She’s kind, thoughtful, articulate, funny, extremely self-aware and about as far removed from the narcissism of Hollywood as a person can get. Oh yes, and one more thing, she’s happy — truly happy, she says — living a semi-anonymous life in suburban New Jersey. Although she loves acting — now appearing in the post-apocalyptic, vampire western “Stake Land” — she finds more satisfaction in her work helping other alcoholics and addicts at Seabrook House in Bridgeton, a nonprofit center for the treatment of chemical dependency.\n\n“I have the ability, because I was a drug addict and an alcoholic, to share my pain and suffering,” McGillis says. “If I can impact one life, that’s enough. And I don’t know if I can do that in acting. I can have a greater influence by sharing my experiences in addiction and recovery.” When asked if anyone at Seabrook recognizes her a film star, she says, “I just say that’s not why I’m here. I don’t mix the two.”\n\nIn truth, McGillis admits her life has been a bumpy one. Growing up in an upper-middle class family, the oldest of three girls, in Newport Beach, Calif., she hid her sexuality from an early age, but not her love of acting.\n\n“She had talent, she had the looks and obviously she had the determination,” says Tom Bradac, her drama teacher at Newport Beach High School. “She could look and act sophisticated, but underneath she was a kid. That was what I was more interested in because that’s where the creative spark was — the jumping for joy.”\n\nMcGillis also admits she was a wild teenager and that her parents kicked her out of the house at age 17. She moved to New York to study acting at Julliard and, while living with another female student at the school, two men forced their way into their Brooklyn apartment and sexually assaulted them at knife point.\n\n\"That 20 minutes of my life seemed to last 20 years,\" she told People Magazine in November 1988. \"For a long time I wanted to withdraw from the world. . . I didn't want to leave my little apartment. I would become so overwhelmed with grief. I gained 30 pounds. I had nightmares. Because I was so afraid to go to sleep at night, I would drink, and it got progressively worse. It was like having a little demon inside eating me up.\"\n\nSeeking parental approval, she says, she briefly married, then divorced, her first husband in her early 20s.\n\nToday, McGillis admits that for years she believed the rape was punishment for being gay. The only way she knew of handling the trauma was to escape through alcohol and acting.\n\n\"I never went to therapy, I couldn't afford it,\" she says. \"Then when I was working, I was too busy to be alone with myself. I did everything to avoid myself — drinking, drugs.\"\n\nPlaying an assistant district attorney in 1988's \"The Accused,\" based loosely on the true story of a woman raped by four men in a New Bedford, Mass., bar, was more than an acting choice — it was a chance at redemption, she says.\n\n“It was very healing. You only get that by looking back. I think that random crap happens, but we make of it what we will. At every moment, we have a choice to sink or swim.”\n\nAt the time of “The Accused,” however, McGillis, still held on to other secrets. While she talked openly about the sexual assault, she did not reveal that her girlfriend, with whom she was then in a relationship, also was raped. A year after the film’s release, McGillis married for the second time.\n\nYacht broker Fred Tillman offered her love, security and, most of all, children. Two daughters, Kelsey and Sonora, were born in Key West, Fla., where McGillis and Tillman owned a restaurant. It also was where McGillis met Melanie Leis, a bartender, with whom, she says, she eventually fell in love.\n\nBy 2002, McGillis was divorced, had been through rehab and was living in a halfway house for addicts in Mohnton, Pa., just southwest of Reading. When she finished the program, her daughters came back to live with her in Pennsylvania, and Leis moved in, too. However, the relationship was rocky. In 2008, with her daughters grown and out of the house, she and Leis were estranged again. McGillis moved to Collingswood with another woman, but when that relationship quickly soured, she wound up alone, stranded in the Garden State.\n\n“I was here less than three weeks and I thought, ‘Oh God, I’ve made a terrible mistake.’” But she settled in, made new friends and re-kindled her relationship with Leis. “I ended up in New Jersey because I moved in with someone. But I didn’t know anyone. I felt so lost,” McGillis says. “I love where I live now. I love Collingswood. I love being close to Philly.”\n\nWhen she dipped back into movies two years ago, it helped that \"Stake Land,\" directed by Pennsylvania native Jim Mickle, was filmed around Pottstown, just 20 miles from where McGillis used to live. During the 26-day shoot, Mickle admired her openness. \"She has an inability to lie on-screen,\" he says. \"And I think that made her so right for the film.\"\n\nRaised outside of organized religion, McGillis says she’s always been drawn to Buddhism and Eastern religion. In 2009, she not only came out of the closet, spontaneously, in an interview with SheWired.com, but she also began studies at the Lancaster Theological Seminary, just miles from where she played an Amish widow nearly 25 years earlier.\n\n“I’m just incredibly fascinated with faith and spirituality. What I’m passionate about is helping people find their own spiritual path, and I don’t think there’s just one path up that mountain,” says McGillis, who continues to meditate and practice yoga. Her calmness impressed one of the producers of \"Stake Land,\" Derek Curl. \"She has such a peaceful energy,\" says Curl. \"A set can be chaotic, confusing, (but) she has a sense of serenity and peace that helped us all stay focused.\"\n\nSpirituality, like the meaning of life, says McGillis, is in the eyes of the beholder. Her favorite quote is from Shakespeare, when Hamlet says to his friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern that he is sorry they are stuck in Denmark because it is like a prison. Rosencrantz disagrees, to which Hamlet says, “There is nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so.”\n\nMcGillis left the Lancaster seminary after a term and a half, but would like to go back someday. Since leaving, she has continued her own spiritual journey. For a time she helped prisoners at Camden County Jail with addiction issues, and now does the same work full time at Seabrook House. Her relationship with Leis, whom she wed in a much-publicized civil ceremony in September 2010, has hit another rough patch.\n\n“It’s not in a good place,” she says. “Sometimes people do self-sabotaging stuff. I’m fine with it. I went through my pain process and anger process. I’m fine. (But) I can’t change anybody.” Being solitary now, she says, is no longer frightening.\n\n“I don’t know what I want to be when I grow up. I’m interested in so many freakin’ things. When your kids grow up, all of a sudden you’re faced with, ‘Wow, what do I do next?’”\n\nAs our interview nears the end, Turnpike traffic finally starts to move again. I pass a burned-out hulk of a car and the remnants of that overturned tractor-trailer. I’m still talking to McGillis as I continue driving toward her house. Finally, I end where I was supposed to begin, at the actress’s front door. I ask if I can come in, just for a minute, to finally meet her face-to-face, even though our hour is up. “Of course,” she says, “I just have to go change.”\n\nFive minutes later the 5-foot-10 actress — who reveals she slouched through the entire shooting of “Top Gun” with the much-shorter Cruise — bounds down the stairs of her small, artistically furnished home. She’s dressed in dark pants and her “Seabrook” polo shirt, ready to go to work. McGillis is still a beautiful woman, perhaps more so in her embrace of her gray hair and the wrinkles, which, she proudly proclaims, she has “earned.”\n\nHer cavernous blue eyes are as soft and warm as her still-girlish voice. When I ask if she’s ever thought of writing a book, she laughs. “A lot of people would have to be dead. I don’t want to create harm, I don’t want to lie or be dishonest about my experiences . . . I’m not very diplomatic. I’m very direct. I’m 54 in July. I don’t take shit from anybody. I don’t have time for that.”\n\nTime now is spent working and engaging in what she calls “Life Skills 101. Shopping, house cleaning, socializing.” When McGillis isn’t exercising or meditating, she’s often reading. A few of her favorites: “Letters to a Young Poet,” by the German Rainer Maria Rilke, “The Science of God: The Convergence of Scientific and Biblical Wisdom,” by Gerald Schroeder and “The Spirituality of Imperfection,” by Ernest Kurtz and Katherine Ketcham.\n\nAs for the future, McGillis hopes it will include more acting, but she’s not willing to change herself to suit someone else’s notion of glamour."
