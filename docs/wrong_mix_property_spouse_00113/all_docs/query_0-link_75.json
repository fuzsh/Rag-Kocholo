While Witness proved to be her breakthrough, her performance as Charlotte Blackwood in Top Gun propelled her to household star status.\n\nIt comes as a surprise that she was neither approached to appear in the sequel of the film nor had any real interest in seeing it when it was released. Still, let's get to know what Kelly has been involved in lately and many more details.\n\nAjiona Alexus Biography - Actress And Singer\n\nPassionate About Acting Since An Early Age\n\nThe prolific actress was born on July 9, 1957, in Newport Beach, California, United States.

Although McGillis's professional career is flourishing and established, surely her personal life isn't the same.\n\nInitially, the Top Gun actress was married to fellow Juilliard student Boyd Black in 1979; however, in 1981, they divorced. A few years later, in 1989, the Newport Beach native married for the second time with Fred Tillman. Kelly McGillis' ex-husband was a wealthy yacht salesman, and the duo together owned a $1.5 million, 110-foot schooner, which was destroyed in a blaze in Florida at a marina in 1996. Eventually, the former duo divorced as well in 2002.\n\nFurthermore, Kelly came out as a lesbian in 2009. With two marriages behind her, very few expected to hear her particular announcement. But this is who she is, embracing her identity with pride. In 2010, the Witness actress came into a civil union with her partner Melanie Leis after being together for ten years. Sadly, their romance didn't last long, and by 2013, the former lovebirds parted ways.\n\nAdditionally, the actress has also faced some traumas in her personal life. Kelly was raped by two men in her New York apartment in 1982. She was also gang-raped by three men when she was 12.\n\nWhat's worse is that a few years later, on June 17, 2016, a woman broke into her North Carolina home and was left bruised and scratched after being assaulted by her. The series of unfortunate activities led the actress to intense alcohol addiction as well.\n\nKelly Is A Mother Of Two\n\nWith her ex-husband, Fred Tillman, the former pair welcomed two daughters during their marriage. Their first child, Kelsey Laurel Tillman, was born on May 24, 1990, and Sonora Ashley, the former couple's second child, was born on April 10, 1993.\n\nThe performer is a wonderful mother to her kids, who are incredibly close to her. Fortunately, Kelly McGillis' daughters are already grown-up individuals, and they are leading their lives happily.\n\nTo conclude, a lot has happened in Kelly McGilli's life, including three unsuccessful marriages. No matter what happened in her life, the actress has peacefully moved on, outgrowing her fears, and she currently lives an ordinary life far from the spotlight in North Carolina. She is definitely one heck of a strong woman, and we send her our best wishes.\n\nTrivia And Facts"
