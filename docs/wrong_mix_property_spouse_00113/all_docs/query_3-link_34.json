        "text": "Actress Kelly McGillis struggled with early fame and personal identity in the years that followed her breakout roles in two of the most popular films of the 1980s. Still in her final year at the famous Julliard School of Drama, McGillis was cast in the quirky black comedy \"Reuben, Reuben\" (1983). And while her debut may not have been a box office hit, it would attract the attention of the director of her next film, \"Witness\" (1985), which most certainly was a success. As well received as McGillis' pairing with Harrison Ford was in that Oscar-nominated film, her next appearance - this time alongside heartthrob Tom Cruise - in \"Top Gun\" (1986), was an unprecedented smash hit and catapulted her to stardom. Although it garnered co-star Jodie Foster more accolades than it did her, McGillis' dedicated turn in \"The Accused\" (1988) was satisfying for the actress on a deeply personal level. Her early successes proved hard to duplicate, however, as features like \"Winter People\" (1989) failed to find an audience. Ultimately, McGillis found gratification with live stage work, balanced by occasional film projects such as \"The Monkey's Mask\" (2001) and \"The Inkeepers\" (2011). Refusing to be pigeonholed as the starlet du jour, McGillis chose her own path, one that while not leading to box-office gold, allowed her to find herself as an actress and as a person."
