        "text": "Top Gun actress Kelly McGillis is recovering after a horrifying home invasion in North Carolina.\n\nRead: Convicted Robber Throws His Feces at Judge Who Sentences Him to 40 Years in Prison\n\nIt happened June 17 when the 58-year-old opened the door to her home in Hendersonville and sensed someone was inside.\n\nShe posted about the incident the following day in a lengthy Facebook post.\n\nShe wrote: “I was trying to get rid of the stuff in my hand to better assess what was going on when a stranger, a woman, came barreling down the hallway and began yelling at me. I asked her who she is and why she was in my house and she said 'you know why you've been stalking me in Twitter.' Not true.”\n\nThe actress says the suspect, identified as Laurence Marie Dorn, started screaming at her.\n\nThe actress struggled to call police and says she escaped in her truck and flagged down a motorist who called 911.\n\nShe wrote: “She ran out after me and began punching and scratching my (sic) trying to grab the phone out of my hand. I began screaming as loud as I could hoping someone somewhere might hear me.”\n\nThe motorist told 911: \"A woman just pulled me over. She said that someone has just broken into her house.\"\n\nMcGillis was screaming: \"Help me!\" as the motorist was on the call.\n\nRead: Police on the Hunt for 'Bikini Bandit' Who's Still on the Loose in Southern California\n\nMcGillis then took the phone and said: \"I don't know her. She says she knows me and I don't know anything about her.”\n\nThe operator asked: \"How did they get in?\"\n\n“I have no idea. I came home and the door was unlocked, the lights were on. And I said hello? Hello and she came out and just said a bunch of s***,” she said.\n\nMcGillis says she’s upset that her neighbors didn't come to her rescue as she screamed.\n\nThe intruder, who had her daughter with her at the time, has been arrested and the child was placed in protective custody.\n\nThe actress told WLOS: “I feel you have an obligation when I hear ‘Help! Help! Help!’ to either help them first or call 911 if it is a dangerous situation. But to flat out ignore it…”"
