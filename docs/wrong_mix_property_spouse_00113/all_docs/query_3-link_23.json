        "text": "Kelly McGillis says she is \"alright\" after a home intrusion got physical.\n\nThe Top Gun actress took to Facebook to share a scary story about a woman who broke into her home and she said proceeded to attack her. McGillis said it began when she returned to her North Carolina residence and noticed a light on inside.\n\n\"When I put my key in the front door it was unlocked. I thought it was strange but I made up the story that maybe I had left it unlocked just as I had left the bathroom light on,\" she wrote, explaining that when she entered the house she noticed a stranger's shoes.\n\n\"A stranger, a woman, came barreling down the hallway and began yelling at me,\" McGillis continued. \"I asked her who she is and why she was in my house and she said 'you know why you've been stalking me in Twitter.' Not true.\"\n\nWATCH: Mandy Moore Granted Restraining Order Over Alleged Stalker\n\nMcGillis, 58, went on to recall in detail her side of what occurred on Saturday:\n\n\"At that moment I got worried that there may be someone else in the house with her. We have quite a few guns and lots of ammo and that's when I started to panic. Thinking that if they have one of them I could be shot. I ran out the front door and called 911. She ran out after me and began punching and scratching me trying to grab the phone out of my hand. I began screaming as loud as I could hoping someone somewhere might hear me. I still had my car keys in my hand so I set off the car alarm. That distracted her enough to throw the cell and try to deal with the keys. More fighting ensued. I got the cell phone back and dialed 911 again. More fighting...I finally broke away, got in the truck and drove off trying to find a neighbor to call 911. There was no one around since it was Friday night, so I chased someone in a car, kept flashing my lights and honking the horn. They finally pulled over and she made the 911 call for me. A truly good Samaritan.\"\n\n\"I'm alright. Scratched and bruise,\" she concluded. \"I feel very thankful it turned out well.\"\n\nMajor Frank Stout of the Henderson County Sheriff's Office tells ET, \"Last night, the victim returned home to find the subject in her residence. After a struggle, the victim was able to flee her residence and call 911. A short time later, deputies were able to locate the suspect and place her under arrest without further incident.\"\n\nThe suspect, Laurence Marie Dorn, was charged with second degree burglary, misdemeanor larceny, misdemeanor stalking, and assault and battery, according to the sheriff's office, and is being held on a $60,000 bail.\n\nWATCH: Chris Brown's Home Invaded by 3 Armed Men, Aunt Forced Into Closet\n\nOn Wednesday, McGillis seemed to still be experiencing some lingering shock, captioning a selfie, \"Relaxing at home with some oxygen. My anxiety is/was so high it was best for me to get hooked up.\"\n\nShe also shared a photo from the shooting range and explained, \"They rushed me through the conceal and carry course so I am armed and ready. The Henderson County Sheriff's department has been absolutely the greatest.\"\n\n\"Here's my first target practice. I only missed five from the center out of thirty rounds. All hit the target,\" she said.\n\nSandra Bullock experienced a similarly frightening incident last year when an alleged stalker broke into her home and she was forced to call 911 while hiding in the closet. Hear the chilling call in the video below."
