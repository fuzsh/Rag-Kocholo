        "text": "In anticipation of Jim Mickle’s Stake Land premiering on September 17th at the Toronto International Film Festival, a new still has made its way online, this time featuring the return of Kelly McGillis to the big screen after a nearly decade-long absence.\n\nEntertainment Weekly debuted the shot of McGillis, who plays a nun caught in a crisis of faith who joins forces with vicious vampire hunters Martin (“Gossip Girl”‘s Connor Paolo) and In the Cut’s Nick Damici. But her biggest threat may not come from the bloodthirsty masses — rather from a militia head (Broadway’s Michael Cerveris) who interprets the post-apocalyptic chaos as the Lord’s work.\n\nStake Land is part of TIFF’s Midnight Madness series and also stars Danielle Harris. The Midnight Madness Package is $157 or $100 for students and seniors (prices exclude taxes and fees). Other ticket packages for the Festival are also available for purchase by cash, debit or Visa. Purchase online here, by phone at 416-968-FILM or 1-877-968-FILM (Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.), or in person at the TIFF Box Office at 2 Carlton Street, West Mezzanine (Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.) The 35th Toronto International Film Festival runs September 9 to 19, 2010.\n\nClick to see the image bigger, and for more information follow Midnight Madness on Twitter.\n\nSynopsis\n\n“In the aftermath of a vampire epidemic, a teen is taken in by a grizzled vampire hunter on a road trip through a post-apocalyptic America, battling both the bloodsuckers and a fundamentalist militia that interprets the plague as the Lord’s work.”\n\n– Uncle Creepy\n\nVISIT THE EVILSHOP @ AMAZON!\n\nGot news?
