        "text": "\"Top Gun\" actress Kelly McGillis was left \"bruised and scratched\" after a woman broke into her North Carolina home last week and assaulted her, police said.\n\nMcGillis, 58, described the incident and her feelings in a series of Facebook posts, and wrote Thursday that she's \"armed and ready\" in the wake of the physical struggle.\n\n\"The incident Friday night has now pushed me over the edge,\" McGillis said in one post. \"It has been my tipping point. No I am not a victim. I am a survivor.\"\n\nThe Henderson County Sheriff’s Office identified the burglar as Laurence Marie Dorn. She was picked up after the June 17 incident and charged with second-degree burglary, misdemeanor larceny, misdemeanor stalking, assault and battery, and interfering with emergency communication.\n\nShe remains booked in the Henderson County Jail on a $60,000 bond.\n\nMcGillis, who teaches acting at The New York Studio for Stage and Screen in Asheville, described how she came home around 9 p.m. after attending a theology lecture. Something wasn't right, she said.\n\n\"When I put my key in the front door it was unlocked. I thought it was strange but I made up the story that maybe I had left it unlocked just as I had left the bathroom light on,\" she wrote.\n\n\"I was trying to get rid of the stuff in my hand to better assess what was going on when a stranger, a woman, came barreling down the hallway and began yelling at me,\" she continued. \"I asked her who she is and why she was in my house.\"\n\nThe woman claimed that McGillis was stalking her on Twitter, which the actress — who shot to fame playing a flight instructor (and Tom Cruise's love interest) in 1986's \"Top Gun\" — denied.\n\nMcGillis said she was worried because she's a gun owner, and didn't know if the intruder got a hold of her weapons.\n\nRelated: 'Top Gun' Inspiration Becomes Highest-Ranking Woman at Pentagon\n\n\"I ran out the front door and called 911. She ran out after me and began punching and scratching (me) trying to grab the phone out of my hand,\" McGillis said. \"I began screaming as loud as I could hoping someone somewhere might hear me.\"\n\nFinally, after \"more fighting ensued,\" McGillis said, she climbed into her truck and drove off until she intercepted another driver who could also call police. Eventually, the deputies came and arrested the woman.\n\n\"I'm alright. Scratched and bruise. I feel very thankful it turned out well,\" McGillis said.\n\nShe wrote in another post that she remains rattled over the assault and will begin carrying a gun with her — a decision that came after a string of scares, including being gang raped in her youth, attacked on a subway during college and later being raped again, she said.\n\nShe added that she has begun taking a conceal and carry course, but described herself as \"not being (a) pro gun fanatic.\"\n\n\"Am I supposed to be getting some kind of lesson from all of this. Or is (the) Universe out to get me? Or God?\" she wrote. \"I don't know if there are answers. I just know I am deeply frightened.\""
