        "text": "It's officially Top Gun Day (yep, that's a thing) and 30 years since the iconic film graced the big screen, but we've still got the need for speed.\n\nWhile the film's stand-out stars – think Tom Cruise, Tim Robbins and Val Kilmer – have rarely left the spotlight, its leading lady Kelly McGillis has barely been seen since.\n\nSince her starring role in the 1986 film – where she played instructor Charlie – Kelly seemingly skipped out on Hollywood – favouring theatre over blockbusters.\n\nToday, the actress is barely recognisable as she rocks a shorter 'pixie' crop and thick-rimmed glasses.\n\nSince her role in the top-grossing film, the 58-year-old had two children with her second husband Fred Tillman, before coming out as gay and marrying long-term love Melanie Leis.\n\nRead more:Top Gun Day: 31 facts you probably didn't know about the 80s movie\n\nAfter flight instructor Charlie, Kelly took a turn opposite Jodie Foster in The Accused – who nabbed an Academy Award for the part – but she failed to acquire any major nomination.\n\nWhat followed was a string of theatre roles, including in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice and Twelfth Night.\n\nIn honour of Top Gun's 30th anniversary, here are a couple of facts you probably didn't know about Kelly's role in the movie.\n\nThe lift love scene between Kelly and Tom Cruise was only added after test audiences demanded more obvious romance.\n\nKelly had already cut her hair and dyed it darker for another movie role, which is why she's wearing a baseball cap and the bedroom scene is all in silhouette.\n\nIn more 'love interest' news – at 5'10\", Kelly was three inches taller than Tom, which led to her acting barefoot after the studio raised concerns over the height difference."
