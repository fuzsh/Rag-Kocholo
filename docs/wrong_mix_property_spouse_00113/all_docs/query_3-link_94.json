        "text": "BURBANK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--TOP GUN heroine and ’80s action staple Kelly McGillis continues her acting resurgence in Friday’s episode of Z Nation on Syfy. Her roles in films like TOP GUN, WITNESS, and THE ACCUSED cemented her as one of the most bankable box office stars of the 1980s. She continued acting throughout the ’90s before taking a several-year hiatus from the industry and only in recent years began taking on new projects, including Z Nation.\n\nIn Friday’s episode, titled “Sisters of Mercy,” McGillis plays the leader of a mysterious women’s cult based in post-apocalyptic Salt Lake City, where she faces down a zombie bear. The episode will be directed by Emmy Award-winning Rachel Goldenberg.\n\nZ Nation launched as Syfy’s highest-rated acquired scripted series premiere since Dr. Who in 2006 and was the network’s most social acquisition ever. The pilot, “Puppies and Kittens,” won the 10pm timeslot for Syfy, outperforming AMC’s Turn and Halt and Catch Fire as well as TNT’s Legends, WGNA’s Salem, and Outlander on Starz. The second episode drew more viewers than the first in both the US and Canada (where it airs on Space), and the show continues to draw high viewerships and young-skewing audiences.\n\nZ Nation airs Friday nights at 10pm on Syfy starring DJ Qualls (LOST, SMALLVILLE), Kellita Smith (THE BERNIE MAC SHOW), and Michael Welch (TWILIGHT SERIES). Created by Karl Schaefer (EUREKA, EERIE INDIANA) and Craig Engler.\n\nThe Asylum is one of the world's leading brand-oriented motion picture and television studios. With a focus on high-concept, market-driven entertainment, like the SHARKNADO franchise, The Asylum finances, produces and releases up to 25 films per year through its direct pipeline to the nation's top retailers and its network of international partners. Since its founding in 1997, The Asylum has released more than 500 films and has built a library of over 200 original productions, including top-rated movie premieres for Syfy, Lifetime, and Animal Planet networks. Z Nation marks The Asylum’s first foray into series television."
