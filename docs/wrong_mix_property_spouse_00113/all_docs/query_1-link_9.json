        "text": "TOP Gun star Kelly McGillis has been spotted at church ahead of the long-awaited release of the Tom Cruise sequel.\n\nThe 62-year-old actress was in good spirits at the service, smiling as she greeted friends in North Carolina.\n\nKelly was spotted as she left the Hendersonville church, dressed in light colours as she braved the heat.\n\nThe star looked happy and relaxed in an oversized white shirt and baggy cream trousers, which she teamed with a pair of flip-flops.\n\nKelly had her short hair casually styled and completed her look with a black handbag and a pair of thick-rimmed glasses.\n\nThe actress made her big screen debut in 1983 staring in comedy hit Reuben.\n\nShe got her big break in 1985 when she landed a role in thriller Witness, playing opposite Harrison Ford as an Amish widow.\n\nHowever, it was the next year that saw Kelly become a household name as she starred in Top Gun with Hollywood actor Tom Cruise.\n\nThe blonde beauty played Charlie, an astrophysicist who falls for Cruise's character Maverick.\n\nIn 1988 she took on the role of a lawyer defending a rape victim, played by Jodie Foster, in The Accused.\n\nWhile Jodie took home an Oscar for her stunning performance, Kelly was inspired to reveal that she'd been the victim of rape when the film was released.\n\nSpeaking to People in the '80s, Kelly bravely recounted how she was raped by two strangers as she explained that taking part in the film had helped her come to terms with what had happened.\n\nShe said: \"The first few weeks after the incident I couldnâ€™t eat or sleep. I twitched incessantly.\n\n\"When the project was finished, it was like a demon had been put to rest, but still I was struggling with publicly telling my story because I was afraid.\"\n\nThe beauty married for a second time in 1989, having two daughters with husband Fred Tillman.\n\nFollowing their divorce in 2002, Kelly retired from the spotlight and moved to Pennsylvania, coming out as a lesbian in 2009.\n\nThe star entered a civil partnership with Melanie Leis in 2010, but they broke up a year later.\n\nNow Kelly occasionally appears in bit-roles for TV shows, such as The L-Word.\n\nEarlier this month, the trailer for the long-awaited Top Gun 2 trailer was released - 34 years after the original hit our screens.\n\nTom Cruise, now 57, returns as cocky pilot Maverick, but it is not expected that Kelly will reprise her role.\n\nGot a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220."
