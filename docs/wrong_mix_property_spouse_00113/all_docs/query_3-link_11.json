        "text": "Originally published on GlamourBuff.com\n\nKelly McGillis gained her breakthrough in the entertainment industry in the mid-1980s after portraying roles like Rachel in Witness and Charlie in Top Gun. For her performance in the former one, she even got nominated for Best Actress for a BAFTA Film Award.\n\nFast forward to the present time, the once-renowned actress is nowhere to be seen in Hollywood. And that absence got felt by millions when the sequel to Tom Cruiseâs Top Gun, Top Gun: Maverick, got released in 2022 after years of delay.\n\nSo, the question looming around everyoneâs mind is, âWhatâs Kelly McGillis doing now?â âWhere is Kelly McGillis today?â and âWhy did the A-lister actress seemingly leave Hollywood?â\n\nDuring her 2019 interview with Entertainment Tonight, McGillis answered some burning questions about her present life, what she had been up to, and why she wasnât in Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nMcGillisâs focus in life changed after 2000 as she took fewer acting roles, and that decision came when she got sober and was on a journey to figure out herself. She said, âI think just my priorities in life changed.â\n\nâIt wasnât like a major decision that I made to leave, it was just that other things became more important. I love acting, I love what I do, I love doing theater, but I donât know. To me, my relationships to other people became far more important than my relationship to fame.â\n\nâI feel really blessed that I donât have to work, you know? But I get the option to work, so Iâm really blessed in that way. Not many people get that option later in life, so I feel very lucky,â McGillis added.\n\nAnd one of the priorities she had was to raise her two daughters â Kelsey and Sonora â whom she shares with her ex-husband Fred Tillman. She told the outlet that she was focused on raising her children when she wasnât acting.\n\nShe said, âIt was very challenging for me to have any kind of sense of self or self-identity or real self-worth other than what I did for a living. And it justâit didnât become a priority; what became the priority initially was raising my girls and being the best sober parent I could be.â\n\nKelly McGillis then and now (Photo: Twitter)\n\nOne of the other topics discussed during McGillisâs interview with Entertainment Tonight was if she was asked to be a part of Top Gun: Maverick or if it was her decision not to be a part of the now-box office blockbuster sequel movie.\n\nShe replied that she wasnât asked to return to Top Gun: Maverick. âOh my god, no,â she said. She added, âIâm old, and Iâm fat, and I look age-appropriate for what my age is. And that is not what that whole scene is about.â\n\nâTo me, Iâd much rather feel absolutely secure in my skin and who and what I am at my age as opposed to placing a value on all that other stuff.â\n\nAs she went on, she mentioned that she wasnât in a hurry to watch the sequel movie, which was initially scheduled to be released in 2019 but got delayed due to COVID-19.\n\nâI guess it depends on what kind of reviews it gets. Iâm not racing to the theater, and Iâm not racing away from the theater to see it. Itâs just not on my little list of things that I would like to get done,â McGillis told the outlet.\n\nAs for why McGillis wasnât in the movie, director Joseph Kosinski told Insider, âI didnât want every storyline to always be looking backwards. It was important to introduce some new characters.â\n\nSince that interview, there havenât been many updates about her. It could be assumed that she has been going well and keeping with her priorities. On the other hand, she did return to Hollywood for a cameo role as Miriam Saslaw in the 2020 TV show Dirty John.\n\nThat said, McGillis, who is 65 years of age now and has 54 acting credits to date, might be relishing her time outside the entertainment industry. In 2013, she told Yahoo! she did other work outside the industry to make a living for herself and her family.\n\nAnd the work included one as a teacher and another at a rehab center. She told the outlet, âI did have another job for a while and it is working at drug and rehabilitation center. Right now, I am concentrating teaching acting privately in small studio that goes with a school in Asheville, North Carolina.â\n\nâI feel it is my time to give back, and thatâs something that I know how to do. And yeah, I live a quiet, little life. I live in a log cabin on top of the hill in North Carolina, and it is lovely,â she added.\n\nSo, it could be possible that she still lives in North Carolina and has the same profession, but it couldnât be said with full confidence without any confirmation.\n\nKeep reading Glamour Buff for more stories like this!\n\nContent Infringement Warning: We have noticed multiple sites copying our content without our consent.

His mother pursued a career as an actress, while his father was the owner of a plastics factory.\n\nUnfortunately, both of the actorâs parents are no longer in this world. His father passed away at Cork University Hospital on April 26, 2004, while his mother peacefully departed at home on September 16, 2009.\n\nSimilar to his approach with his siblings, Dominic has maintained a high level of privacy regarding his parents. He hasnât disclosed much information about them nor shared any details on his social media platforms.\n\nRegarding the actorâs family background, he was born into a family of Irish descent. His maternal grandparents were born in Ireland, and his paternal grandmother was of Irish-American heritage.\n\nDominic Westâs early life\n\nDominic grew up in the picturesque surroundings of Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire. During his early years, he attended a boarding school, an experience he later shared with Radio Times.\n\nHe revealed that being sent to boarding school at a tender age was a deeply profound and almost as traumatic experience as losing his parents. According to him, the education away from home, particularly at Eton, had a significant impact on him.\n\nReflecting on this period, he expressed, âIt was the worst feeling I have ever had, very similar to the grief when my parents died. Itâs the same thing, really; you think youâve lost your parents. I learned to bury the emotional effects of that and then I went to drama school and had to dig it all up again.â\n\nDominic West went to boarding school at a young age. (Source: Spectator)\n\nSubsequently, Dominic pursued his education at the renowned Eton College, where his passion for acting was ignited when he secured the role of Hamlet in the Shakespeare play of the same name.\n\nAfter a transformative gap year, he spent four months working as a cattle herder in Argentina. Following this unique experience, the actor continued his academic journey by studying English literature at Trinity College Dublin, earning his degree in 1993.\n\nHe then concluded his formal training at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, successfully graduating in 1995. Shortly after earning his degree, he took on small roles in a variety of British and Hollywood films, including Richard III, Surviving Picasso, True Blue, Spice World, and more.\n\nBrief on Dominic Westâs career\n\nDominic secured his breakthrough in Hollywood with the rom-com film 28 Days in 2000. His career reached new heights in 2002 when he played the notable role of Fred Casely in Chicago.\n\nHe also took on the award-winning character of Detective Jimmy McNulty in the American crime drama series The Wire. From 2003 to 2007, he showcased his versatility with memorable character roles in films such as Mona Lisa Smile, 300, Hannibal Rising, and more.\n\nMoving to 2011, the actor contributed to the British supernatural film The Awakening and gave award-winning performances in the British television drama series The Hour and Appropriate Adult. He also showcased his theatrical talent in plays like Butley and Othello that year.\n\nDominic continued his theatrical endeavors with roles in The River and My Fair Lady. The year 2014 marked a significant milestone as he landed the award-winning role of Noah Solloway in the American television series The Affair, a role he continues to portray to this day.\n\nMoreover, expanding his diverse portfolio, the actress lent his distinctive voice to the character Rudder in the film Finding Dory.\n\nDuring this period, he also showcased his versatility by portraying various characters in animated TV films like Revolting Rhymes and took on the role of a narrator for an episode of the esteemed British documentary program Panorama.\n\nTransitioning into 2018, Dominic graced the big screen with his presence in the film Colette and the remake of Tomb Raider. Maintaining his active presence on the screen, in 2019, the actress captivated audiences in the British television series Brassic.\n\nLater, in October 2020, the actor stepped into the role of Charles, Prince of Wales, for the final two seasons of The Crown. His performance earned him nominations for two prestigious awards â the Screen Actors Guild Award and the Golden Globe Awards.\n\nDuring an appearance on The Graham Norton Show, Dominic shared insights into his experience on the show, emphasizing that taking up the role of Charles, previously portrayed by Josh OâConnor, was an easy decision.\n\nDominic West as Charles, Prince of Wales in Netflixâs âThe Crownâ (Photo: Twitter)\n\nLikewise, he addressed the weight of joining a hugely successful series like The Crown, noting, âThere was significant pressure due to its prior success and Joshâs excellent portrayal. However, when it comes down to it, you must choose roles that genuinely interest you; such opportunities are rare.â\n\nExpressing his fondness, the actor conveyed how much he enjoyed stepping into the shoes of such a brilliant character. He also revealed that during his preparation, he immersed himself in numerous documentaries to thoroughly understand and capture the essence of the role.\n\nDominic West Shares Four Children With His Wife Catherine Fitzgerald\n\n5 children all together!\n\nDominic West is an English actor, director, and musician.\n\nHe is best known for playing Jimmy McNulty in HBOâs The Wire, Noah Solloway in Showtimeâs The Affair, which earned him a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor â Television Series Drama, Ebenezer Scroogeâs nephew Fred in A Christmas Carol, and Charles, Prince of Wales, in the Netflix drama The Crown, which earned him another Golden Globe Award nomination.\n\nAs successful as Dominic is in his professional life, the same is the case for his personal life. He is happily married to his wife, Catherine FitzGerald, with whom he shares four children â Dora West, Senan West, Francis West, and Christabel West.\n\nHere is all we know about them.\n\nDominic Westâs children\n\nWhile Dominic only shares four children with his current wife FitzGerald, he has five children.\n\nHe welcomed his first child, daughter Martha West, with his former girlfriend Polly Astor. Martha has followed in her fatherâs footsteps in the entertainment industry.\n\nShe grew up in south-east London. She auditioned for her first professional job at the age of nine, and she was cast as the supporting lead alongside Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly in Creation, a biopic about Charles Darwin.\n\nIt is reported that she eventually discontinued her acting career as a child at the request of her parents, who wanted her to concentrate on her studies at St Marylebone CE School. She received her training at the National Youth Theatre and participated in the Royal Courtâs Young Court program.\n\nShe graduated from Oxford University in 2021, where she performed and created plays, some of which received local attention.\n\nShe has appeared alongside her father in the BBC series Pursuit of Love. She also attended the 2019 Met Gala with Dominic.\n\nDora, Dominicâs second child but the first one he shares with his wife, was born in 2006. She does not have any social media, so there is no information about her.\n\nSenan, FitzGeraldâs second child, has followed in his fatherâs and half-sisterâs footsteps into the acting industry. He was cast as Prince William in the final few episodes of Season 5 of The Crown alongside his father, despite his lack of acting experience.\n\nIt helped that Senan, who was blonde and blue-eyed, resembled a young Prince William, and the natural father-son bond didnât hurt. However, Dominic did not let Senan reprise his role in the sixth season of the Netflix show.\n\nDominic West with his son, Senan West, and wife Catherine FitzGerald. (Source: Twitter)\n\nHe told the Radio Times [via The Times] that he did not want his son to act in the scene where he would learn that his mother [Princess Diana] had died. He said, âI didnât really fancy doing the scene at Balmoral [Castle], telling a boy his mother has died.â\n\nHe revealed that Senan was invited back but it was Dominic who stopped his son from playing Prince William. âThey invited Senan back because he did such a good job, and he was great, but I did slightly balk at that. It was unfair of me because he did want to do it, but I wouldnât have fancied that, to be honest,â he confessed.\n\nNot much is known about Dominicâs youngest two children, Francis and Christabel. They maintain a low profile and they have not joined their siblings and father into the world of acting.\n\nDominic lives with his children and wife at Glin Castle in Ireland. He told House and Garden, âGlin enriches my life and my kidsâ lives in terms of identity and continuum. My children are surrounded by Irish wit and humanity. They have a far broader existence than they would anywhere else in the world.â\n\nDominic West and his wife, Catherine FitzGerald\n\nFitzGerald and West fell in love while attending Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, but their relationship was short-lived. âI fell in love with my wife when I was at university and I managed to persuade her to fall in love with me for about three months but then she ran away and married someone else,â Dominic told British Vogue.\n\nFitzGerald also talked about their love story with the Irish Independent and said that it would not have been the right decision to settle with him at the time. âWe had all the time in the world to explore the pubs and back streets and walk the canal. But at the end of the summer, I left him. And he has not let me forget it! But I couldnât have settled down with him right then forever. That would not have been a good idea for either of us,â she explained.\n\nWhen FitzGerald and Dominic split up, she married Edward Lambton, the 7th Earl of Durham, in 1995, while the actor relocated to the United States to shoot The Wire and had a daughter with Astor.\n\nFitzGerald and Lambton ended their relationship in 2002, and she and Dominic reconnected the same year. He was taking a year off and returned to London to be with his daughter, and a mutual acquaintance introduced them.\n\nâWe were both, then, at the right time in our lives,â FitzGerald told the Irish Independent. âAnd it was lovely to have that shared history, from earlier days.â\n\nThe duo has been together since then. They welcomed their children and were engaged for three years before getting married at the Glin Castle on June 27, 2010.\n\nAll looked good between Dominic, his wife, and their children.\n\nHowever, their marriage was put to the test in 2020, when Dominic was seen looking cozy with The Pursuit of Love co-star Lily James on the streets of Rome, Italy. The two were seen riding a scooter together, and at one point, James nuzzled Dominicâs neck.\n\nHe wasnât wearing his wedding band while he was with James. However, FitzGerald forgave her husband for the affair.\n\nThe day after the images were released, Dominic and FitzGerald addressed reporters outside their London home, presenting a unified face. They then handed reporters a note that read, âOur marriage is strong and weâre very much still together. Thank you. Catherine and Dominic.â\n\nIn the years after, the pair has remained supportive of one another, with FitzGerald appearing beside her husband at the season 5 premiere of The Crown in 2022 alongside their children.\n\nIdris Elbaâs Tattoos â Unveiling the Meaning behind His Inks\n\nIdris Elba loves getting tattoos.\n\nEnglish actor Idris Elba has left a lasting impact on the entertainment industry for three decades, showcasing his versatility through diverse roles in film and television, all while passionately pursuing a music career.\n\nOver the years of witnessing Idrisâ on-screen prowess, fans have not only appreciated his artistic talent but also observed his passion for getting inked across his body.
