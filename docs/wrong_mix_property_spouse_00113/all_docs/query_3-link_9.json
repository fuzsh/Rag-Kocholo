        "text": "The 1986 American film Top Gun is about a young pilot at the United States Navy’s elite fighter weapons school who competes to become the best in the class.\n\nTom Cruise stars in this action drama alongside Kelly McGillis, Val Kilmer, Anthony Edwards, Tom Skerritt, Tim Robbins, and Meg Ryan. Watch the official trailer below:\n\nTop Gun was such a hit when it was released that it became the highest grossing film of 1986 and has made many “top film” lists over the years. In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected Top Gun for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.”\n\nTop Gun was partially filmed in Nevada at the Naval Air Station in Fallon. The NAS Fallon is the United States Navy’s premier air-to-air and air-to-ground training facility.\n\nMost of the aerial sequences were shot at NAS Fallon. Ground-mounted cameras provided shots of the aircraft maneuvering over land.\n\nAir-to-air shots were filmed using a Learjet with camera pods pointed towards either the front or the rear of the aircraft.\n\nWe’re just getting started with our Scene in Nevada series, but if you like it, check out our interactive Nevada Film Tourism Map where you can find more film locations from your favorite video games, movies and more!\n\nThe information contained in this article is deemed to be accurate and true to the best of our knowledge.
