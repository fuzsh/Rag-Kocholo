        "text": "TOP Gun star Kelly McGillis says she’d love to write her amazing life story – but isn’t sure anyone would believe it.\n\nThe actress became one of Hollywood’s biggest names after breakthrough success opposite Harrison Ford in Witness, before starring with Tom Cruise in the fighter pilot drama.\n\nBut she has led a turbulent life and battled depression and addiction after being raped at knifepoint.\n\nAs she rebuilt her film career, mum-of-two Kelly, 56, saw her marriage end and five years ago, she announced she was gay.\n\nShe said: “My life has been interesting, very full, very diverse. I am really happy with the life that I have had. I am very contented.\n\n“Lots of friends have told me I should write a book, but nobody would believe it.\n\n“Maybe some day when some people have passed on and they won’t be insulted, maybe then I’ll write the book.”\n\nKelly has co-starred with some of Hollywood’s biggest stars since her movie debut alongside Tom Conti in Reuben Reuben in 1983 – a role which earned the Paisley-born star an Oscar nomination.\n\nAs well as appearing with Ford in Witness and Cruise and Val Kilmer in Top Gun, she played Jodie Foster’s lawyer in the rape drama The Accused.\n\nBut she admits Top Gun was probably her career-defining moment.\n\nKelly said: “It was so big and its popularity has lasted an awfully long time – far longer than I expected.\n\n“At the time, we felt we were making a good movie but who knew that it would be as big as it was?\n\n“For a while, every time I went to the grocery story they were playing Take My Breath Away and I’d be thinking, ‘Do they do this just when I walk in this door?’”\n\nAlongside the box office successes, Kelly also experienced rejection early in her screen career.\n\nShe was hired to star with Tom Hanks in the 1984 comedy Bachelor Party before being unceremoniously sacked.\n\nShe said: “After one day of shooting, the producers came to me and said something to the effect that I was not right for the movie, I was not pretty enough.\n\n“It was not easy to take and it threw me into a state of depression for quite some time.”\n\nBut Kelly got over the shock and went on to achieve success with Golden Globe and Bafta nominations for her work. She also won the Best Actress award at the Venice Film Festival for the 1987 comedy Made In Heaven.\n\nThese days she is happy to combine smaller supporting film roles with enjoying the quiet life at her log cabin home in North Carolina.\n\nHer latest movie is We Are What We Are – a horror tale about a reclusive American family whose extreme beliefs include cannibalism.\n\nShe agreed to take the role after working with director Jim Mickle on his award-winning vampire movie Stake Land.\n\nKelly said: “I like working but I also love not having to carry the movie.\n\n“I just come in, play a goofy character, then go home to the mountains of North Carolina.\n\n“I have always wanted to live in a log cabin, so that’s what I did. It is lovely.”\n\nOff-screen, Kelly’s life is just as dramatic as any of her characters.\n\nIn February 1982, she and a roommate were raped at knifepoint by two men who broke into her New York apartment. She came out as a lesbian in 2009 and married her girlfriend Melanie Leis in a civil ceremony the following year.\n\nShe had previously battled depression and drink and drugs addiction – something that made her determined to help others conquer their demons.\n\nShe has worked with addicts in rehab centres and prisons and recalls one scary incident at a women’s jail in Pennsylvania.\n\nShe said: “I was alone and walking to the gym, where the AA meeting was held.\n\n“All of a sudden the escape alarm went off and there were lots of guards with big shotguns running down the hallways and I had no place to go.\n\n“I couldn’t go in or out and all the doors were slammed shut. I did not know what to do.\n\n“That was the only time it was really scary. I was really grateful when the all-clear was sounded and they opened the door and I could get the heck out of there.”\n\nBut she says that one of her scariest times was when she played an Amish mother opposite Star Wars legend Harrison Ford in Witness in 1985.\n\nShe said: “It was only my second film and I didn’t know a whole lot about making movies.\n\n“I was so intimidated at working with director Peter Weir and Ford.\n\n“I thought, ‘My God, these guys are all big league hitters and here am I, just out of school.’ I just did the best job I could.”"
