Her notable roles include captivating performances in Witness (1985), Top Gun (1986), Made in Heaven (1987), and The Accused (1988).\n\nRELATED: Blippi Net Worth 2023 – Everything You Need To Know\n\nAt the height of her career in 2002, she made a significant decision to depart from Hollywood, choosing to relocate first to Pennsylvania and subsequently to North Carolina. Since then, she has engaged in a handful of film projects and has also graced several stage productions, all while maintaining a discreet presence in the public eye. Kelly McGillis continues to showcase her talent and passion for acting, leaving an enduring legacy despite her preference for a more private lifestyle.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nProfile Summary\n\nEarly life\n\nMcGillis, the oldest of three daughters, was born on July 9, 1957, in Newport Beach, a suburban area in southern California. Her parents were Virginia Joan (née Snell), a homemaker, and Donald Manson McGillis, a physician. With a mix of Scots-Irish, German, and Welsh ancestry, McGillis grew up in Los Angeles and attended Newport Harbor High School.\n\nDuring her formative years, McGillis pursued her passion for acting and enrolled in the Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts at Allan Hancock College in Santa Maria, California. However, she decided to leave high school in 1975 and obtained her GED before making the move to New York City. In pursuit of her dreams, she enrolled at the renowned Juilliard School to study acting and successfully completed her education in 1983 as part of Group 12.\n\nWhile McGillis’s exceptional talent brought her fame and fortune, she also faced personal challenges related to her weight and health. In more recent times, however, she made a firm commitment to prioritize her well-being and embarked on a journey of self-discovery that has profoundly transformed her life.\n\nFamily, Husband & Relationships\n\nKelly McGillis was born to Donald Manson McGillis, a Physician, and Virginia Joan McGillis, a homemaker. Her father’s name is Donald Manson McGillis, and her mother’s name is Virginia Joan McGillis. Her paternal ancestry traces back to Scots-Irish roots, while her maternal side has German ancestry. Additionally, she also has connections to English and Welsh heritage.\n\nIn addition to her parents, McGillis has two siblings.

While pursuing her acting career, she also worked as a waitress and took on various stage roles. Her passion for acting led her to enroll in classes at the prestigious Juilliard School, where she successfully completed her training in 1983.\n\nIn 1983, McGillis landed the role of “Geneva Spofford” in the film “Reuben, Reuben.” She followed this with her notable portrayal of “Rachel Lapp” in the 1985 film “Witness.”\n\nAlthough she appeared in films like “Top Gun” (1986) and “The Accused” (1988), which were nominated for awards and achieved high box office success at the time, these movies did not significantly contribute to her rising popularity.\n\nNevertheless, McGillis persevered in her career without complaints. It was during the 1980s that she began to establish herself with major hit films, including her roles in the renowned William Shakespeare play “The Merchant of Venice.” In the 1990s, she took a break from movies but had previously played various roles in films such as “The Babe” (1992), “Winter People” (1989), “North” (1994), and “Amish” (1989).\n\nAfter her hiatus, McGillis made a comeback in her film career with “At First Sight” (1999). She then took on the challenging role of a young woman in “The Monkey Mask” (2000), a lesbian cult film based on the Australian novel by Dorothy Porter.\n\nMcGillis has also made notable appearances in stage productions, including John Webber’s play “The Duchess of Malfi,” “Mrs. Robinson,” “Pasadena Playhouse,” “The Little Foxes,” “Don Juan,” “The Seagull,” “Peccadillo,” “Twelfth Night,” “The Merry Wives of Windsor,” “Mary Stuart,” “Hedda Gabler,” “A Mourning Becomes Electra,” “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” “Measure for Measure,” “Love for Love,” “Six Characters in Search of an Author,” “Three Sisters,” and “The Winter’s Tale.”\n\nOne of McGillis’s breakthrough films was “Witness” (1985), directed by Peter Weir and starring Harrison Ford. She further gained popularity by working with producer Jerry Bruckheimer in the blockbuster movie “Top Gun” (1986). However, despite the success of these films, establishing a lasting career in the film industry proved to be a challenging task for Kelly McGillis.\n\nNet Worth\n\nIn 2022, Kelly McGillis, renowned for her role in Top Gun, is reported to have an approximate net worth of $4 million. Throughout her career, she has accumulated remarkable filmography with over 40 film credits to her name. In addition to her work on the silver screen, she has also graced numerous stage productions, showcasing her versatility as an actress."
