        "text": "The actress Kelly McGillis and her sales executive girlfriend MELANIE LEIS were joined in a civil union this week, reports The New York Times. The couple have known each other since 2000 after meeting when Leis was tending the bar of a restaurant that MCGillis owned with her second husband, FRED TILLMAN. Judge Robert T. Zane III officiated the ceremony at the Collingswood Municipal Court on Wednesday 15th September 2010.\n\nBack in 2009, MCGillis told People Magazine about a time when a reporter had asked her whether she was looking to date men or women, she said, \"It was like a moment of truth. I thought, Hmm, do I say the truth, or do I just say, It's none of your business, which is my standard answer? I said you know, I'm just going to say the truth. Definitely a woman\"\n\nMCGillis' best known roles were alongside Harrison Ford in the 1985 film 'Witness', opposite Tom Cruise in the 1986 hit movie 'Top Gun', and in 1988's 'The Accused', which also starred Jodie Foster. In recent years, the 53-year-old has turned her attention to theatre and television - she appeared in the stage play of 'The Graduate' as Mrs Robinson in 2004 and joined the cast of 'The L Word' for its fifth season in 2007."
