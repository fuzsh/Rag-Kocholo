        "text": "Kelly McGillis is an American actress best known for her starring roles in films such as ‘Top Gun’ and ‘Witness.’ Kelly was born in Newport Beach, California and soon after she was born, the family moved to Los Angeles, California. Growing up in LA, Kelly somehow became increasingly attracted towards the prospect of working in the show business. Following her high school graduation, she moved to New York City and enrolled into the Juilliard School, from where she graduated in 1983. In 1983, she made her acting debut playing Geneva in the film titled ‘Reuben, Reuben.’ She had her major breakthrough in 1985, when she appeared opposite Harrison Ford in the crime thriller film titled ‘Witness.’ Film’s success opened ways for her in Hollywood. On the top of that, the universal success of her film ‘Top Gun’ further turned her into a national icon. In the 1990s, she appeared in films such as ‘The Babe’ and ‘Painted Angels.’ Her career slowed down by the 2000s though. In June 2016, she was attacked in her house by a woman named Laurence Marie Dorn, following which Kelly applied for a gun licence. She has also been in news regarding her sexuality, as she is openly lesbian."
