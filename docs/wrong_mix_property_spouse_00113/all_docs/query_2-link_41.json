Although there is no consensus, current evidence indicates that sucralose and saccharin could influence the gut microbiota. The aim of this study was to analyze the existing scientific evidence on the effects of saccharin and sucralose consumption on gut microbiota in humans. Different databases were used with the following search terms: sweeteners, non-caloric-sweeteners, sucralose, splenda, saccharin, sugartwin, sweet’n low, microbiota, gut microbiota, humans, animal model, mice, rats, and/or in vitro studies. In vitro and animal model studies indicate a dose-dependent relationship between the intake of both sweeteners and gut microbiota affecting both diversity and composition. In humans, long-term study suggests the existence of a positive correlation between sweetener consumption and some bacterial groups; however, most short-term interventions with saccharin and sucralose, in amounts below the ADI, found no significant effect on those groups, but there seems to be a different basal microbiota-dependent response of metabolic markers. Although studies in vitro and in animal models seem to relate saccharin and sucralose consumption to changes in the gut microbiota, more long-term studies are needed in humans considering the basal microbiota of participants and their dietary and lifestyle habits in all population groups. Toxicological and basal gut microbiota effects must be included as relevant factors to evaluate food safety and nutritional consequences of non-calorie sweeteners. In humans, doses, duration of interventions, and number of subjects included in the studies are key factors to interpret the results.

A gluten-free diet (GFD) in patients with CD is suggested to have a beneficial effect on CAIT. Thus, the present systematic review was undertaken to achieve more robust evidence about the change in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid-specific antibodies (T-Ab) levels obtained in CD patients following a GFD. A specific search strategy was planned. The last search was performed on March 2022. The following data were mainly searched for in order to be extracted: sample size, mean and/or median with standard deviation (SD), and error (SE), individually, of thyroid hormones and T-Ab at baseline and after GFD, and the duration of the study. The initial search retrieved 297 records and 6 articles met the inclusion criteria. In total, 50 patients with both CD and CAIT and 45 controls were reported. The effects of a GFD on the thyroid hormonal and immunological profile could be extracted only in a part of the studies. Two studies were case reports. A low risk of bias was observed. These findings advise further studies, ideally randomized, in order to better investigate the potential relationship between GFD and thyroid homeostasis. The level of evidence is not still sufficient to recommend GFD to patients with CAIT.

Obesity has long been linked to ROS and ER stress, but the effect of GABA on the ROS-associated ER stress axis has not been thoroughly explored. Thus, in this study, the effect of GABA and fermented Curcuma longa L. extract enriched with GABA (FCLL-GABA) on the ROS-related ER stress axis and inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease 1α (IRE1α) sulfonation were examined with the HFD model to determine the underlying anti-obesity mechanism. Here, GABA and FCLL-GABA supplementations significantly inhibited the weight gain in HFD fed mice. The GABA and FCLL-GABA supplementation lowered the expressions of adipogenic transcription factors such as PPAR-γ, C/EBPα, FAS, and SREBP-1c in white adipose tissue (WAT) and liver from HFD-fed mice. The enhanced hyper-nutrient dysmetabolism-based NADPH oxidase (Nox) 4 and the resultant IRE1α sulfonation-RIDD-SIRT1 decay under HFD conditions were controlled with GABA and FCLL-GABA. Notably, GABA and FCLL-GABA administration significantly increased AMPK and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) levels in WAT of HFD-fed mice. These significant observations indicate that ER-localized Nox4-induced IRE1α sulfonation results in the decay of SIRT1 as a novel mechanism behind the positive implications of GABA on obesity. Moreover, the investigation lays a firm foundation for the development of FCLL-GABA as a functional ingredient.

The aim of the presented study is to analyze self-regulation of eating behaviors in the population-based sample of Polish adolescents within the Polish Adolescents’ COVID-19 Experience (PLACE-19) Study. The Self-Regulation of Eating Behavior Questionnaire (SREBQ) was used to assess self-regulation of eating behaviors in the studied population of 1126 Polish adolescents (818 females and 308 males), aged 15–20, recruited based on a random quota sampling within a national sample. Based on the screening questions of the SREBQ, 145 individuals were excluded from the analysis. The participants of the study were categorized based on their gender, body mass index, body mass index change during the COVID-19 pandemic, and food products declared as tempting. The major factors associated with SREBQ score were body mass index change and tempting food products. The respondents losing weight during the COVID-19 pandemic were characterized by a higher SREBQ score than those maintaining stable body mass or gaining weight (3.4 vs. 3.2 vs. 3.2; p = 0.0001). The respondents declaring both sweet and salty food products as tempting were characterized by a lower SREBQ score than those declaring only sweet, only salty, or declaring no tempting products (3.2 vs. 3.4 vs. 3.4 vs. 3.4; p < 0.0001). The major factors associated with SREBQ categories were gender, body mass index change, and tempting food products. A higher share of respondents characterized by a high self-regulation of eating behaviors was observed for males than for females (27.4% vs. 18.8%; p = 0.0142); for respondents losing weight during the COVID-19 pandemic than for respondents gaining weight (25.9% vs. 15.5%; p = 0.0423); as well as for respondents declaring no tempting products than those declaring both sweet and salty food products (38.3% vs. 18.2%; p < 0.0001). It was concluded that the self-regulation of eating behaviors in adolescents is closely associated with food products perceived as tempting by them, as well as with gender. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the low self-regulation of eating behaviors was a significant determinant of the body mass gain. Taking this into account, female adolescents characterized by a low self-regulation of eating behaviors especially should be subjected to a dedicated intervention program to prevent overweight and obesity.

Thus, this study aimed to observe the changes in DHB among older adults when the COVID-19 pan-demic first erupted in China (at the beginning of 2020) and explore the impact factors on self-care routines in daily life. We applied a cross-sectional study among 1256 (83.7%) valid older Chinese from 19 February 2020 to 19 March 2020, the score of DHB changes (mean ± SD, 14.70 ± 2.140; range, 8–18) presented a significant growth (t1256 = 44.636, p < 0.001) during COVID-19. From 3 hierarchical linear regression models, the older Chinese who received a higher education include high school (β = 0.403, 95% CI [0.009, 0.797], p = 0.045) and college degree and above (β = 0.488, 95% CI [0.034, 0.943], p = 0.035), and lived in the eastern China (β = 0.771, 95% CI [0.392, 1.151], p < 0.001) took DHB more frequently. However, the high-risk infection (β = −0.740, 95% CI [−1.248, −0.231], p = 0.004), overweight/obese character (β = −0.265, 95% CI [−0.526, −0.004], p = 0.047), and alcohol consumption (β = −0.350, 95% CI [−0.634, −0.065], p = 0.016) are significant factors in decreasing a senior’s DHB performance. For China, self-care offers a straightforward strategy among the range of measures required to combat COVID-19 and future health threats. In summary, findings in this study can build a foundation for developing healthcare policy and services for the relevant government and departments on prompting DHB and the importance of self-care among the older population.

The rising androgen/estrogen ratio along the menopause transition favors the accumulation of central fat, which contributes to insulin resistance and a series of concatenated effects, leading to a higher incidence of metabolic syndrome. The modulatory effect of diet on the metabolic syndrome phenotype has been shown for the Mediterranean diet, and nuts are key determinants of these health benefits. This review of the impact of nuts on the risk factors of the metabolic syndrome cluster examined studies—prioritizing meta-analyses and systemic reviews—to summarize the potential benefits of nut ingestion on the risk of metabolic syndrome associated with menopause. Nuts have a general composition profile that includes macronutrients, with a high proportion of unsaturated fat, bioactive compounds, and fiber. The mechanisms set in motion by nuts have shown different levels of efficacy against the disturbances associated with metabolic syndrome, but a beneficial impact on lipids and carbohydrate metabolism, and a potential, but minimal reduction in blood pressure and fat accumulation have been found.

In this study, we examined the effects of chlorogenic acid on energy metabolism in vitro. Hepatocellular carcinoma G2 (HepG2) cells were cultured in a medium containing chlorogenic acid. Chlorogenic acid increased the activity of mitochondrial enzymes, including citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase (MDH), which are involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Proteome analysis using the isobaric tags for the relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) method revealed the upregulation of proteins involved in the glycolytic system, electron transport system, and ATP synthesis in mitochondria. Therefore, we propose a notable mechanism whereby chlorogenic acid enhances energy metabolism, including the TCA cycle, glycolytic system, electron transport, and ATP synthesis. This mechanism provides important insights into understanding the beneficial effects of coffee consumption.

Loss of visual acuity (VA) and visual contrast sensitivity function (VCSF) are the major symptoms of retinal degenerative diseases. Cordyceps militaris is a carotenoid-rich Chinese medicinal fungus with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory functions. C. militaris extract is a natural substance, and its bioactive constituents have been shown to confer health benefits, but their application in retinal tissue and functional vision protection in vivo remain incompletely understood. In the present study, we evaluated the influence of water-soluble, carotenoid-rich C. militaris extracts on the visual performance of light-damaged mouse retinas in vivo, using adult female CD-1® (ICR) albino mice. We showed that oral administration of this C. militaris extract (10 mg/kg, twice daily) protected the neural retina tissue against light-evoked photoreceptor cell death, reduced Müller cell hypertrophic gliosis, and elevated GSH levels and promoted the recovery of VA- and VCSF-thresholds, especially for high spatial frequency-characterized vision. These results suggest that, probably because of its water-soluble carotenoids, C. militaris extract has the potential to prevent or treat light-induced visual dysfunction.

To identify the modifiable risk factors for iron-related pathological conditions, we examined the association between iron intake and the risk of knee OA progression. Methods: A total of 1912 participants in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI), aged 45–79 years and with at least one knee radiographic OA at baseline, were identified and were followed up to 6 years. The iron and other nutrient intake was measured by the validated Block Brief 2000 Food Frequency Questionnaire. The outcome measures were by radiographic progression on the basis of the Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) grade and the joint-space-narrowing (JSN) score. The association between the iron intake and the knee OA progression was examined by Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression. Results: Among the study participants, 409 participants experienced KL-grade progression, and 684 participants experienced JSN-score progression within 6 years. Overall, the association between iron intake and the risk of KL-grade progression followed a U shape (p for nonlinearity < 0.001). The risk of KL-grade progression was significantly lower in participants with iron intakes of <16.5 mg/day (per mg/day: adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 0.75; 95% CI (confidence interval), 0.64–0.89), and it was higher in those with iron intakes ≥16.5 mg/day (per mg/day: HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.04–1.38). Consistently, when the iron intake was assessed as deciles, compared to those in Deciles 3–5 (10.9–23.3 mg/day), the risk of KL-grade progression was higher for Deciles 1–2 (≤10.9 mg/day: HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.17–2.10) and for Deciles 6–10 (>23.3 mg/day: adjusted HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.19–2.16). Similar U-shaped relations were found for iron intake with the risk of JSN-score progression (p for nonlinearity = 0.035). Conclusions: There was a U-shaped association between the iron intake and the progression of knee OA, with an inflection point at about 16.5 mg/day, and minimal risk from 10.9 to 23.3 mg/day of iron intake. An appropriate iron intake was advisable for knee OA, whereas excessive or deficient iron intake increased the risk of knee OA progression.

The inflammation mediated by NF-κB signaling plays an important role in tendon senescence and degeneration. Friedelin (FR) is a triterpenoid derived from green plants, which has a variety of pharmacological functions, such as analgesia, anti-inflammation, antioxidation, and anti-tumor functions. However, the role and mechanism of FR in tendinopathy are unclear. Here, we found that FR improved the mechanical strength of the Achilles tendon, restored the orderly arrangement of collagen fibers, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, and promoted tenogenesis, thereby blocking the progression of tendinopathy. Mechanistically, FR promoted the autophagic degradation of p65 by enhancing the interaction between p62 and p65 and effectively inhibited the activation of the NF-κB pathway, thus alleviating the inflammatory response of tenocytes. In addition, FR recruited E3 ubiquitin enzyme RNF182 to increase the K48-linked ubiquitination of p65 and promoted p62-mediated autophagic degradation. Furthermore, blocking ubiquitination reversed the degradation of p65 by FR. Therefore, these findings identify the new pharmacological mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect of FR and provide a new candidate drug for the treatment of tendinopathy.

Pernicious anemia is linked to but different from autoimmune gastritis. Pernicious anemia occurs in a later stage of autoimmune atrophic gastritis when gastric intrinsic factor deficiency and consequent vitamin B12 deficiency may occur. The multifaceted nature of pernicious anemia is related to the important role of cobalamin, which, when deficient, may lead to several dysfunctions, and thus, the proteiform clinical presentations of pernicious anemia. Indeed, pernicious anemia may lead to potentially serious long-term complications related to micronutrient deficiencies and their consequences and the development of gastric cancer and type 1 gastric neuroendocrine tumors. When not recognized in a timely manner or when pernicious anemia is diagnosed with delay, these complications may be potentially life-threatening and sometimes irreversible. The current review aimed to focus on epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical presentations of pernicious anemia in an attempt to look beyond borders of medical specialties. It aimed to focus on micronutrient deficiencies besides the well-known vitamin B12 deficiency, the diagnostic approach for pernicious anemia, its long-term complications and optimal clinical management, and endoscopic surveillance of patients with pernicious anemia.

Optimal nutritional management is paramount in improving short and long-term prognosis for neonates and infants with congenital heart malformations, as current strategies target preoperative and postoperative feeding requirements. Standardized enteral and/or parenteral feeding protocols, depending on the systemic implications of the cardiac defect, include the following common practices: diagnosing and managing feeding intolerance, choosing the right formula, and implementing a monitoring protocol. The latest guidelines from the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition and the European Society of Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care, as well as a significant number of recent scientific studies, offer precious indications for establishing the best feeding parameters for neonates and infants with heart defects.

It evokes skeletal muscle hypertrophy by increasing anabolic pathway, which is essential to prevent sarcopenia in elderly population. In this study, we examined the effects of AM on skeletal muscle hypertrophy by focusing on the molecular mechanism. We employed an in vitro model to investigate whether AM-treated skeletal muscle, as represented by myotube C2C12 cells, was hypertrophic, and to further investigate the efficacy of AM-activated phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling that must occur prior to myotube hypertrophy. The results showed that the myotubes formed larger multinucleated myotubes with increased diameter and thickness (1.16-fold relative to control group, p < 0.05). Administration of PI3K and mTOR inhibitors abolished AM-induced muscular hypertrophy. Moreover, AM-induced PI3K-mediated myotube hypertrophy was accompanied by the activation of Akt and mTOR signaling. We concluded that the AM is a nutritional activator to enhance muscular hypertrophy by increasing PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling phosphorylation. As the AM is effective in myotube hypertrophy, AM and its derivatives may be promising candidates for ergogenic aid to prevent sarcopenia.

Among the cereals, rye has the highest fiber content and high rye consumption has been linked to increased production of gut fermentation products, as well as reduced risks of obesity and metabolic disease. The effects on body weight and metabolic risk factors may partly be mediated through gut microbiota and/or their fermentation products. We used data from a randomized controlled weight loss trial where participants were randomized to a hypocaloric diet rich in either high fiber rye foods or refined wheat foods for 12 weeks to investigate the effects of the intervention on gut microbiota composition and plasma short chain fatty acids, as well as the potential association with weight loss and metabolic risk markers. Rye, compared to wheat, induced some changes in gut microbiota composition, including increased abundance of the butyrate producing Agathobacter and reduced abundance of [Ruminococcus] torques group, which may be related to reductions in low grade inflammation caused by the intervention. Plasma butyrate increased in the rye group. In conclusion, intervention with high fiber rye foods induced some changes in gut microbiota composition and plasma short chain fatty acid concentration, which were associated with improvements in metabolic risk markers as a result of the intervention.

However, there was less information about microbial metabolism on the adverse reactions. This study aimed to explore whether Lactobacillus casei could regulate gut microbiota or short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) disorders to protect intestinal adverse reactions induced by isoniazid (H) and rifampicin (R). Male Wistar rats were given low and high doses of Lactobacillus casei two hours before daily administration of anti-TB drugs. After 42 days, colon tissue and blood were collected for analysis. The feces at two-week and six-week were collected to analyze the microbial composition and the content of SCFAs in colon contents was determined. Supplementation of Lactobacillus casei increased the proportion of intestinal goblet cells induced by H and R (p < 0.05). In addition, HR also reduced the level of mucin-2 (p < 0.05), and supplementation of Lactobacillus casei restored. After two weeks of HR intervention, a decrease in OTUs, diversity index, the abundance of Bacteroides, Akkermansia, and Blautia, and an increase of the abundance of Lacetospiraceae NK4A136 group and Rumencoccus UCG-005, were observed compared with the control group (p all < 0.05). These indices in Lactobacillus casei intervention groups were similar to the HR group. Six-week intervention resulted in a dramatic reduction of Lacetospiraceae NK4A136 group, butyric acid, valeric acid and hexanoic acid, while an increase of Bacteroides and Blautia (p all < 0.05). Pretreatment with Lactobacillus casei significantly increased the content of hexanoic acid compared with HR group (p < 0.05). Lactobacillus casei might prevent intestinal injury induced by anti-tuberculosis drugs by regulating gut microbiota and SCFAs metabolism.

Our goal was to evaluate current sugar intake levels (intrinsic and added) and their major dietary sources within the EsNuPI study participants by applying two 24-h dietary recalls that were completed by 1448 children (1 to <10 years) divided into two subsamples: One “Spanish Reference Sample” (SRS) of the general population (n = 707) and another sample which included children consuming adapted milks including follow-on milk, toddler’s or growing up milk and fortified and enriched milks, here called “Adapted Milk Consumers Sample” (AMS) (n = 741). Estimates of intrinsic and added sugar intakes from the Spanish EsNuPI population as well as the adherence to recommendations varied notably according to age segment, but no major differences between subsamples were found. Younger children (1 to <3 years) showed the highest added sugar contribution to total energy intake (TEI) (SRS: 12.5% for boys and 11.7% for girls; AMS: 12.2% for boys and 11.3% for girls) and the lowest adherence to recommendations set at <10% TEI (SRS: 27.4% for boys and 37.2% for girls; AMS: 31.3% for boys and 34.7% for girls). Adherence increased with age but remains inadequate, with approximately one in two children from the older age segment (6 to <10 years) exceeding the recommendations. Main food sources of intrinsic sugars for both subsamples were milk and dairy products, fruits, vegetables and cereals, while for added sugars, these were milk and dairy products (mainly yogurts), sugars and sweets (mainly sugary cocoa and nougat), bakery products (mainly cookies) and cereals (mainly bread and wheat flour). However, for the AMS, the groups milk and dairy products and cereals showed a significantly lower contribution to intrinsic sugar intake but a significantly higher contribution to that of added sugars. These results demonstrate that sugar intake and the adherence to recommendations in the studied population varied notably according to age but not to the type of milk consumed. In addition, our results highlight the need to monitor the consumption of added sugars by the infant population, as well as the need to make efforts to facilitate this task, such as harmonizing the recommendations regarding free/added sugars and the inclusion of information on their content on the nutritional labeling of products in order to incorporate them into food composition databases.

A completely randomized block design was set up, where the experimental unit (n = 6000 birds) received conventional or enriched diet and was slaughtered at 37 (light class), 47 (medium class), or 57 (heavy class) days of life. Hence, functional and standard Pectoralis major muscles from every market class were analyzed for FA composition, inorganic elements and vitamin E. Lipid metabolism indices and health lipid indicators were assessed along with the nutritional value. A multiple linear model revealed that in breasts, the dietary treatment significantly influenced (p < 0.05) the FA profile, lipid metabolism and health lipid indices, while the slaughtering weight was related (p < 0.05) to most of elements (e.g., Na, Mg, K, Mn, and Se) and vitamin E. The interdependence of the two factors had strong relations (p < 0.05) with total PUFAs, including linolenic acid, desaturase activities, health lipid indices, trace essential elements and vitamin E. Consequently, enriched meat from heavy chickens showed the best functional and nutritional traits. Overall, the study pointed out that both market class and dietary manipulation are two relevant factors to consider for producing breast meat with higher nutritional and functional value.

Pomegranate can be used to prevent or treat metabolic syndrome (MetS) risk factors. Although previously published reviews addressed the effects of pomegranate on different diseases, there is no systematic review that exclusively focuses on clinical trials related to all MetS-related risk factors. In view of this limitation, the objective of this up-to-date, comprehensive, and systematic review is to critically evaluate the potential of pomegranate (P. granatum) on various MetS risk factors on the basis of clinical studies. PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, COCHRANE, and Clinical Trials.gov databases were searched on 15 October 2021. The Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines were followed, and the bias risk evaluation was performed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We identified 5683 studies in the databases. After removing the duplicates, 3418 studies remained. Of these, 147 studies met the eligibility criteria, and finally, only 20 were included in the qualitative analysis. The included studies suggest that pomegranate can be beneficial to reduce body weight, blood pressure, glycemia, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Moreover, it can augment high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and improve insulin resistance. Although relevant effects were observed, additional well-designed clinical trials are needed to determine the correct formulations and doses to be used to prevent or treat MetS components.

Our aim was to describe the diet of a cohort of Spanish children, from 2 to 36 months, and to identify the components that could influence the quality of the diet at 24 and 36 months of age. This was a longitudinal prospective study analyzing information from administered questionnaires about general characteristics and food frequency consumption in 97 full-term babies. At 2–3 months of age, only 53.6% of infants were observed to be breastfed. The intake of animal foodstuffs from 12 to 36 months was higher than national recommendations, and the contrary was true for fruits and vegetables. The intake of vitamin D was below European Food Safety Authority recommendations. Moreover, energy intake at 6 months was inversely associated with Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) at 24 months, whereas vegetables intake was positively associated with MDS at 36 months. These results could be useful in the creation of future guidelines focused on the promotion of breastfeeding and healthy early-life food habits.

We aimed to investigate the relationship between canned fish consumption and CRC risk. We analysed data from two case–control studies conducted between 1992 and 2010 in several Italian areas, comprising a total of 2419 incident cases and 4723 hospital controls. Canned fish consumption was analysed according to the weekly frequency of consumption as <1 serving per week (s/w) (reference category), 1 < 2 s/w, and ≥2 s/w. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using unconditional logistic regression models, adjusting for several recognised confounding factors. Overall, canned fish consumption was lower among cases than among controls (23.8% vs. 28.6%). An inverse association was found between canned fish consumption and CRC risk with a significant trend in risk (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.71–0.92 for intermediate consumption and OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51–0.85 for the highest one), which was consistent across strata of several covariates. This study is the first to offer a basis of support for canned fish consumption as a component of a healthy diet, and it has relevant public health implications given the high ranking of CRC in incidence and mortality worldwide.

In this context, the role of resolvins, specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), deriving from omega-3 essential fatty acids, may be crucial. Indeed, differential production in numerous high-risk conditions associated with both childbirth and neonatal health, the correlation between maternal omega-3 intake and resolvin concentrations in maternal blood and at the placental level, and the high values found in breast milk in the first month of breastfeeding, are some of the most important hallmarks of these autacoids. In addition, a growing body of scientific evidence supports the lack of SPMs, at the level of immune-metabolic tissues, in the case of obesity. Furthermore, the obesity-related lack of SPMs seems to be decisive in the context of the current outbreak of COVID-19, as it appears to be one of the causes associated with the higher incidence of complications and negative outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The usefulness of metabolomics in this field appears clear, given that through the metabolome it is possible to observe the numerous and complex interactions between the mother, the placenta and the fetus in order to identify specific biomarkers useful in the prediction, diagnosis and monitoring of the various obstetric conditions. However, further investigations are needed in order to evaluate the possible use of some resolvins as biomarkers of maternal–fetal outcomes but also to establish adequate integration values in pregnant women with omega-3 fatty acids or with more active derivatives that guarantee optimal SPM production under risky conditions.

University students report using caffeine-containing products to enhance mood and performance or for a desire of alertness. The current study investigated caffeine consumption in university undergraduate students, and associations with smoking status, alcohol and cannabis consumption, fruit and vegetable consumption, and sleep quality. Motivations for caffeine intake were also ascertained. A total of 886 undergraduates aged 18–25 years from the University of the Balearic Islands participated in a cross-sectional survey. Caffeine was consumed by 91.1% of participants. Caffeine consumers were more likely to be female, smokers, and alcohol and cannabis consumers. Coffee was found to be the main source of caffeine intake in both men and women (48.9% of total caffeine intake). Higher percentages of women consumed coffee (56.4 vs. 42.1%, p = 0.01) and tea (40.3 vs. 19.8%, p < 0.001), whereas a higher percentage of men consumed energy drinks (18.0 vs. 7.4%, p < 0.001). Main motivations for caffeine intake were those related to cognitive enhancement. Caffeine intake was associated with poorer subjective sleep quality (p < 0.001). In conclusion, undergraduate students that were female and smokers reported higher caffeine intakes. Coffee was found as the main caffeine contributor, with higher contributions of tea in women and energy drinks in men. Universities should consider the implementation of health campaigns and educational programs to educate students of the risks of high caffeine consumption together with associated behaviors such as smoking, alcohol consumption and poor sleep quality to physical health and academic performance.

This study examined perceptions and knowledge regarding nut consumption among Australian healthcare professionals and their provision of nut consumption recommendations. A cross-sectional online survey of Australian health professionals was conducted in February–April 2020. Questions in the survey included demographic details, participants’ perceptions of nut consumption, and nut consumption recommendations they may make to clients and patients. A total of 204 health professionals completed the survey, of which 84% were dietitians or nutritionists. Health professionals demonstrated basic nutritional knowledge regarding nut consumption; however, non-dietitians/nutritionists lacked knowledge of long-term benefits of nut consumption. Dietitians/nutritionists were more likely to agree that nuts are healthy and do not cause weight gain when compared to non-dietitians/nutritionists (p = 0.021). A total of 63% of health professionals advised at least some of their clients to eat more nuts, and this was higher among dietitians/nutritionists (68%) than non-dietitians/nutritionists (31%). While basic nutritional knowledge regarding nut consumption was observed among all health professionals, there is scope for further education, particularly for non-dietitians/nutritionists, to ensure that nutrition information provided to patients and clients is accurate and reflects the current evidence base.

This study aimed to explore the ECM/BCM ratio as a predictor of mortality risk with nutritional-inflammatory markers in HD patients. A prospective observational study was conducted in 90 HD patients (male: 52.2%; DM: 25.60%). Clinical and biochemical parameters [serum albumin, serum C-reactive protein (s-CRP), interleukine-6 (IL-6)] were analysed and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) was performed. Protein-energy wasting syndrome (PEW) was diagnosed using malnutrition-inflammation score (MIS). Based on BIA-derived measurements, the ECM/BCM ratio with a cut-off point of 1.20 was used as a PEW-fluid overload indicator. Comorbidity by Charlson index and hospital admissions were measured. Out of 90 HD patients followed up for 36 months, 20 patients (22.22%) died. PEW was observed in 24 survivors (34.28%) and all non-survivors. The ECM/BCM ratio was directly correlated with MIS, s-CRP, Charlson index and hospital admissions but was negatively correlated with phase angle and s-albumin (all, p < 0.001). Values of the ECM/BCM ratio ≥ 1.20 were associated with higher probability of all-cause mortality (p = 0.002). The ECM/BCM ratio ≥ 1.20, IL-6 ≥ 3.1 pg/mL, s-CRP and s-albumin ≥ 3.8 g/dL and Charlson index were significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk in multivariate adjusted analysis. This study demonstrates that the ECM/BCM ratio ≥ 1.20 as a nutritional marker and/or fluid overload indicator had a significant prognostic value of death risk in HD patients.

Specifically, we assessed consumers’ intention to purchase the enriched product compared to the conventional one. The methodology adopted inferential and multivariate statistical techniques: (1) exploratory factor analysis (EFA), (2) ordinary least squares regression (OLS) and (3) non-hierarchical clustering. This study appears to be the first research project related to exploring consumers’ interest in an extra virgin olive oil enhanced with vitamins, thereby providing preliminary indications. The main results represent a significant starting point for the development of new marketing strategies for the food industry.

A household-based, double-blind, cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in rural Pakistan. The primary objective was to examine the effects of consuming zinc-biofortified wheat flour on the zinc status of adolescent girls aged 10–16 years (n = 517). Households received either zinc-biofortified flour or control flour for 25 weeks; blood samples and 24-h dietary recalls were collected for mineral status and zinc intake assessment. Plasma concentrations of zinc (PZC), selenium and copper were measured via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and serum ferritin (SF), transferrin receptor, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and C-reactive protein by immunoassay. Consumption of the zinc-biofortified flour resulted in a moderate increase in intakes of zinc (1.5 mg/day) and iron (1.2 mg/day). This had no significant effect on PZC (control 641.6 ± 95.3 µg/L vs. intervention 643.8 ± 106.2 µg/L; p = 0.455), however there was an overall reduction in the rate of storage iron deficiency (SF < 15 µg/L; control 11.8% vs. 1.0% intervention). Consumption of zinc-biofortified flour increased zinc intake (21%) but was not associated with an increase in PZC. Establishing a sensitive biomarker of zinc status is an ongoing priority.

Investigations were carried out in 24 subjects at risk of developing metabolic syndrome who received 280 g/day of frozen raspberries for 8 weeks. Blood and stool samples were collected at weeks 0 and 8. Inter-individual variability in plasma TMAO levels was analyzed, 7 subjects were excluded due to noninformative signals and 17 subjects were kept for analysis and further stratified according to their TMAO response. Whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing analysis was used to determine the impact of raspberry consumption on gut microbial composition. Before the intervention, the relative abundance of Actinobacteriota was significantly higher in participants whose TMAO levels increased after the intervention (p = 0.03). The delta TMAO (absolute differences of baseline and week 8 levels) was positively associated with the abundance of gut bacteria such as Bilophila wadsworthia (p = 0.02; r2 = 0.37), from the genus Granulicatella (p = 0.03; r2 = 0.48) or the Erysipelotrichia class (p = 0.03; r2 = 0.45). Changes in the gut microbial ecology induced by raspberry consumption over an 8-week period presumably impacted quaternary amines-utilizing activity and thus plasma TMAO levels.

Herein, we aimed to determine the differences in hearing impairment among working-age adults by income level and identify the nutritional factors that affect hearing loss in various socioeconomic groups. Seven-hundred-and-twenty participants had hearing impairment, while 10,130 had normal hearing. After adjustment for propensity score matching, income and smoking status were identified as significant variables. By assessing the relationship between hearing impairment and nutrient intake by income level using multiple regression analyses, significant nutrients differed for each income category. Carbohydrate and vitamin C levels were significant in the low-income group; protein, fat, and vitamin B1 levels were significant in the middle-income group; and carbohydrates were significant in the high-income group. Income was significantly associated with hearing impairment in working-age adults. The proportion of individuals with hearing impairment increased as income decreased. The association between hearing impairment and nutritional intake also differed by income level. Our findings may enable the establishment of health policies for preventing hearing impairment in working-age adults by income level.

Some Lactobacillus strains with cholesterol-lowering potential have been isolated from artisanal food products. The purpose of this study was to isolate probiotic Lactobacillus strains from traditional yoghurt (dahi) and yogurt milk (lassi) and investigate the impact of these strains on the blood lipid profile and anti-obesity effect in a high cholesterol high fat diet model in Wistar rats. Eight candidate probiotic strains were chosen based on in vitro probiotic features and cholesterol reduction ability. By 16S rDNA sequencing, these strains were identified as Limosilactibacillus fermentum FM6, L. fermentum FM16, L. fermentum FM12, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus FM9, L. fermentum Y55, L. fermentum Y57, L. rhamnosus Y59, and L. fermentum Y63. The safety of these strains was investigated by feeding 2 × 108 CFU/mL in saline water for 28 days in a Wistar rat model. No bacterial translocation or any other adverse effects were observed in animals after administration of strains in water, which indicates the safety of strains. The cholesterol-lowering profile of these probiotics was evaluated in male Wistar rats using a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet (HFCD) model. For 30 days, animals were fed probiotic strains in water with 2 × 108 CFU/mL/rat/day, in addition to a high fat, high cholesterol diet. The cholesterol-lowering effects of various probiotic strains were compared to those of statin. All strains showed improvement in total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and weight gain. Serum cholesterol levels were reduced by 9% and 8% for L. rhamnosus FM9 and L. fermentum Y57, respectively, compared to 5% for the statin-treated group. HDL levels significantly improved by 46 and 44% for L. rhamnosus FM9 and L. fermentum Y57, respectively, compared to 46% for the statin-treated group. Compared to the statin-treated group, FM9 and Y57 significantly reduced LDL levels by almost twofold. These findings show that these strains can improve blood lipid profiles as effectively as statins in male Wistar rats. Furthermore, probiotic-fed groups helped weight control in animals on HFCD, indicating the possible anti-obesity potential of these strains. These strains can be used to develop food products and supplements to treat ischemic heart diseases and weight management. Clinical trials, however, are required to validate these findings.
