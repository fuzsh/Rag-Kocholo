Yang\n\nPhysics, 1957\n\n\"for their penetrating investigation of the so-called parity laws which has led to important discoveries regarding the elementary particles\"\n\nPaul C. Lauterbur\n\n(d. March 27, 2007)\n\nPhysiology or Medicine, 2003\n\n\"for their discoveries concerning magnetic resonance imaging\"\n\nRobert J. Aumann\n\nEconomics, 2005\n\n\"for having enhanced our understanding of conflict and cooperation through game-theory analysis\"\n\nBarry Barish\n\nPhysics, 2017\n\n\"for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves\"\n\n* Four faculty members at Stony Brook University's School of Marine and Atmospheric Science have been recognized for their contributions to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize along with former Vice President Al Gore \"for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change\"\n\nBarry Barish\n\n2023\n\n\"For exemplary service to science, including groundbreaking research on sub-atomic particles. His leadership of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory led to the first detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes, confirming a key part of Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. He has broadened our understanding of the universe and our Nation’s sense of wonder and discovery.\"\n\nJoanna S. Fowler\n\n2008\n\n\"For her pioneering work in chemistry involving the synthesis of medical imaging compounds and her innovative applications of these compounds to human neuroscience, which have significantly advanced our understanding of the human brain and brain diseases including drug addiction\"\n\nDennis P. Sullivan\n\n2004\n\n\"For his achievements in mathematics, including solving some of the most difficult problems and creating entirely new areas of activity, and for uncovering striking, unexpected connections between seemingly unrelated fields.\"\n\nJames Glimm\n\n2002\n\n\"For his original approaches and creative contributions to an array of disciplines in mathematical analysis and mathematical physics, which are fundamental to the theory of operator algebras, shock-wave theory, advanced quantum field theory, quantum statistical mechanics, applied mathematics, and scientific computation Also affiliated with Brookhaven National Laboratory\"\n\nPaul Lauterbur\n\n(d. 2007)\n\n1987\n\n\"For first proposing and demonstrating the use of nuclear magnetic resonance to form images, and for his continuing contributions to the development of this method for safely producing exquisitely detailed images of the interior of the body for use in medical research and clinical diagnosis.\"\n\nChen N. Yang\n\n1986\n\n\"For his pathbreaking research in theoretical physics, which he has influenced for many years by his profound questions and deep mathematical insight. His ideas have had great impact not only on theoretical developments but also on experiments in elementary particles and condensed matter.\"\n\nMaurice Goldhaber\n\n(d. 2011)\n\n1983\n\n\"For his many contributions to all aspects of nuclear physics and more recently particle physics, and for the leadership he has provided the scientific community, as an administrator of science, as a shaper of scientific thought, and as a prolific source of stimulating ideas.\"\n\nJohn W. Milnor\n\n1966\n\n\"For clever and ingenious approaches in topology which have solved long outstanding problems and opened new exciting areas in this active branch of mathematics.\"\n\nEsther Takeuchi\n\n2008\n\n\"For her seminal development of the silver vanadium oxide battery that powers the majority of the world's lifesaving implantable cardiac defibrillators, and her innovations in other medical battery technologies that improve the health and quality of life of millions of people.\"\n\nRichard Gambino\n\n1995\n\n\"For the discovery and development of a new class of materials-the amorphous magnetic materials-that are the basis of erasable, read-write, optical storage technology, now the foundation of the worldwide magnetic-optic disk industry.\"\n\nPaul C. Lauterbur\n\n(d. March 27, 2007)\n\n1988\n\n\"For [...] contributions in conceiving and developing the application of magnetic resonance technology to medical uses including whole body scanning and diagnostic imaging.\"\n\nRobert Lazarsfeld\n\n2015\n\n\"for his books \"Positivity in Algebraic Geometry I and II\", published in 2004. These books were instant classics that have profoundly influenced and shaped research in algebraic geometry over the past decade.\"\n\nJohn W. Milnor\n\n2004\n\n\"in recognition of a lifetime of expository contributions ranging across a wide spectrum of disciplines including topology, symmetric bilinear forms, characteristic classes, Morse theory, game theory, algebraic Ktheory, iterated rational maps...\"\n\nJames G. Glimm\n\n1992\n\n\"for his paper, Solution in the large for nonlinear hyperboic systems of conservation laws, Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, XVIII (1965), pp. 697-715.\"\n\nJohn W. Milnor\n\n1982\n\n\"for a paper of fundamental and lasting importance, On manifolds homeomorphic to the 7-sphere, Annals of Mathematics (2) 64 (1956), pp. 399–405.\"\n\nSir Simon Donaldson\n\n2020\n\n\"for their contributions to differential geometry and topology\"\n\nDennis P. Sullivan\n\n2010\n\n\"for his innovative contributions to algebraic topology and conformal dynamics\"\n\nJohn Milnor\n\n1989\n\n\"for ingenious and highly original discoveries in geometry, which have opened important new vistas in topology from the algebraic, combinatorial, and differentiable viewpoint.\"\n\nGeorge C. Williams\n\n(d. Sept. 8, 2010)\n\n1992\n\n\"For his seminal contributions to current evolutionary thought, including the importance of natural selection and adaptation, and the understanding of sexual reproduction, social behavior, senescence, and disease.\"\n\nSimon K. Donaldson\n\n1986\n\n\"Received medal primarily for his work on topology of four-manifolds, especially for showing that there is a differential structure on euclidian four-space which is different from the usual structure.\"\n\nJohn Milnor\n\n1962\n\n\"Proved that a 7-dimensional sphere can have several differential structures; this led to the creation of the field of differential topology.\""
