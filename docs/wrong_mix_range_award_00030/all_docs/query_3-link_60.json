        "text": "Climate change facts\n\nWhat do you need to know about climate change?\n\nWe’re already seeing the effects of human-caused climate change — but nature can help. Protecting nature today ensures a more sustainable future.\n\nFact 1: 421 parts per million\n\nThe concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in our atmosphere, as of May 2022Jump to references1, is the highest it has been in human history. Tweet this fact\n\nFact 2: 2023 was the hottest year on record\n\nAnalysis by NOAA shows that average global temperatures in 2023 were 2.12 degrees F (1.18 degrees C) warmer than the 20th-century average — and higher than any other year since records began in 1850.Jump to references2 What's more, the 10 warmest years on record have all been in the past decade. Tweet this fact\n\nFact 3: 20% of emissions\n\nAs much as 20 percent of all global greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans are due to deforestationJump to references3 — exceeding the emissions from all of the passenger vehicles on the planet.Jump to references4 Tweet this fact\n\nFact 5: Fight climate change, improve livelihoods — naturally\n\nScaling up natural climate solutions, such as restoring degraded forests, could create as many as 20 million new jobs.Jump to references7 In total, ecosystem restoration creates 3.7 times as many jobs as oil and gas production per dollar.Jump to references8 Tweet this fact\n\n6.\n\nFact 6: A disturbing trend\n\nAccording to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service, average global temperatures in July 2023 were higher than any other month on recordJump to references9 — and beat the 1991-2020 average temperature for July by 0.72°C. Tweet this fact\n\nFact 7: 3.6 billion people\n\nAs many as 3.6 billion people live in areas of high vulnerability to climate change impactsJump to references10 such as droughts, floods, heat waves, extreme weather events and sea-level rise. Tweet this fact\n\nFact 8: Coastal ecosystems are critical\n\nIn a single square mile, mangroves hold as much carbon as the annual emissions of 90,000 cars. If they are destroyed, all that carbon is released into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change.Jump to references11 Tweet this fact"
