        "text": "Rapid and large changes in warming\n\nEarth's climate has changed throughout history. In the past 650,000 years, there have been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate eraâ€”and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth's orbit that alter the amount of energy our planet receives from the sun. But the warming we've seen over the past few decades is too rapid to be linked to changes in Earth's orbit and too large to be caused by solar activity.\n\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth's climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warming. Carbon dioxide from human activity is increasing more than 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last ice age.\n\nObservable evidence of rapid climate change includes:\n\nGlobal temperature rise\n\nWarming ocean\n\nShrinking ice sheets\n\nRetreating glaciers\n\nDecreased snow cover\n\nSea level rise\n\nDeclining arctic sea ice\n\nExtreme weather events\n\nOcean acidification\n\nExplore the evidence for rapid climate change in detail at climate.nasa.gov.\n\nThe role of human activity\n\nCO2 levels in Earth's atmosphere have increased from 280 parts per million (ppm) to 414 ppm in the past 150 years. (Scientists use ppm to measure what fraction of the air is made up of a certain molecule, in this case CO2. One ppm of CO2 would mean that for every 1 million air molecules you breathe in, one would be CO2.)\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a United Nations organization that includes 195 member countries and thousands of independent scientific experts, published a Synthesis Report in March 2023. It concluded that human activities, principally through greenhouse gas emissions, have unequivocally caused global warming. The main drivers of these emissions are energy use, land use, and the consumption and production of goods."
