The Working Group I contribution was accepted and approved in September 2013. The Working Groups II and III contributions were accepted and approved in March and April 2014 respectively, and the Synthesis Report was approved in November 2014.\n\nCompared to previous reports, AR5 puts greater emphasis on assessing the socio-economic aspects of climate change and implications for sustainable development, regional aspects, risk management and the framing of a response through both adaptation and mitigation.\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE 2013\n\nThe Physical Science Basis\n\nWorking Group I Contribution to the\n\nFifth Assessment Report of the IPCC\n\nSummary for Policymakers\n\nHeadline statements\n\nTechnical Summary and\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nReport\n\n(available in English only)\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE 2014\n\nImpacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability\n\nPart A: Global and Sectoral Aspects\n\nPart B: Regional Aspects\n\nWorking Group II Contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC\n\nSummary for Policymakers\n\nSummaries, Frequently Asked Questions, and Cross-Chapter Boxes Volume\n\n(available in English only, yet)\n\nFull Report Part A and Part B\n\n(available in English only)\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE 2014\n\nMitigation of Climate Change\n\nWorking Group III Contribution to the\n\nFifth Assessment Report of the IPCC\n\nSummary for Policymakers\n\n(available in English only, yet)\n\nTechnical Summary\n\n(available in English only, yet)\n\nFull Report\n\n(available in English only)\n\nMore information on the AR5 can be found in the AR5 English pagehere.\n\nIPCC Special Reports\n\nBesides the Assessment Reports, the IPCC publishes Special Reports on specific topics such as aviation; regional impacts of climate change; technology transfer; emissions scenarios; land use; land use change and forestry; carbon dioxide capture and storage; and on the relationship between safeguarding the ozone layer and the global climate system. They can be accessed under Publications.\n\nThe latest of these Special Reports were released in 2011:\n\nMethodology Reports\n\nThe IPCC also prepares methodologies and guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories through the Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (TFI). These help Parties to the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol to draw up national inventories of greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks. The last major publication was the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.\n\nThe TFI has produced two sets of additional guidance that were adopted and accepted by the IPCC at its 37th Session held on 14-18 October 2013 in Batumi, Georgia:\n\nthe 2013 Supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Wetlands, (in English) provides methodological guidance on lands with wet and drained soils, and constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment\n\nthe 2013 Revised Supplementary Methods and Good Practice Guidance Arising from the Kyoto Protocol, (in English) provides Parties to the UNFCCC who report under the Kyoto Protocol with the additional guidance they need for its second commitment period.\n\nThese supplementary guidelines were prepared at the invitation of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice of the UNFCCC and Conference of the Parties Serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC respectively.\n\nFor more information please see the TFI website (English).\n\nThe Task Group on Data and Scenario Support for Impact and Climate Analysis\n\nThe Task Group on Data and Scenario Support for Impact and Climate Analysis (TGICA) facilitates the distribution and application of climate change related data and scenarios. TGICA oversees a Data Distribution Centre (DDC) that provides data sets, scenarios of climate change and other environmental and socio-economic conditions, and other materials (e.g. technical guidelines on the use of scenarios and fact sheets offering clarifying explanations/concise guidance on topical issues).\n\nFor more information visit the TGICA page (English).\n\nOther useful links in the English-language pages\n\nFor information about the various meetings that the IPCC organizes and documentation from these meetings, please see Meeting Documentation page.\n\nFor the full IPCC calendar of meetings and other important dates, please see the IPCC Calendar.\n\nFor IPCC press releases and other communications and outreach materials please see News and Outreach.\n\nFor presentations and speeches provided at various IPCC outreach events around the world, please see Presentations and Speeches.\n\nFor information on the IPCC Scholarship Programme, please see IPCC Scholarship Programme.\n\nWhat is the IPCC?\n\nNote: Some links take the reader to English-language documents where translations are not available\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization\n\nHeadquarters in Geneva. IPCC Secretariat\n\nis hosted by WMO\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change. It was established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988 to provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts. In the same year, the UN General Assembly endorsed the action by WMO and UNEP in jointly establishing the IPCC.\n\nThe IPCC is a scientific body. It reviews and assesses the most recent scientific, technical and socio-economic literature produced worldwide relevant to the understanding of climate change. It does not conduct any research nor does it monitor climate related data or parameters.\n\nIt is an intergovernmental body. It is open to all member countries of the United Nations and WMO. Currently 195 countries are members of the IPCC. The Panel meets at least once a year in plenary at the level of government representatives where the main decisions about the IPCC work programme are taken and Bureau Members, including the Chair, are elected. Governments participate also in the scoping of reports, nomination of authors, the review process and accept, adopt and approve reports at plenary sessions.\n\nBecause of its scientific and intergovernmental nature, the IPCC embodies a unique opportunity to provide rigorous and balanced scientific information to decision-makers. By endorsing the IPCC reports, governments acknowledge the authority of their scientific content. The work of the organization is therefore policy-relevant and yet policy-neutral, never policy-prescriptive.\n\nHow the IPCC works\n\nThousands of scientists from all over the world contribute to the work of the IPCC on a voluntary basis as authors, contributors and reviewers. None of them is paid by the IPCC.\n\nThe Panel takes major decisions at plenary sessions of government representatives. A central IPCC Secretariat supports the work of the IPCC.\n\nThe IPCC is currently organized in three Working Groups and a Task Force. The Working Groups and Task Force are assisted by technical support units (TSUs), which are hosted and financially supported by the government of the developed country Co-Chair of that Working Group/Task Force. A TSU has also been established to support work on the Synthesis Report.\n\nWorking Group I deals with the physical science basis of climate change, Working Group II with climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, and Working Group III with mitigation of climate change. The Working Groups meet in plenary at the level of government representatives. The main objective of the Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories is to develop and refine a methodology for the calculation and reporting of national greenhouse gas emissions and removals.\n\nBesides the Working Groups and Task Force, further task groups and steering groups may be established for a limited or longer duration to consider a specific topic or question. One example is the Task Group on Data and Scenario Support for Impact and Climate Analysis (TGICA).\n\nFor more information on how the IPCC works visit the Structure pages (in English).\n\nFactsheets\n\nWhat is the IPCC?\n\nHow does the IPCC select its authors?\n\nWhat literature does the IPCC assess?\n\nHow does the IPCC review process work?\n\nHow does the IPCC approve reports?\n\nHow does the IPCC deal with alleged errors?\n\nTimeline - highlights of IPCC history\n\nThe IPCC's work is guided by a set of principles and clear procedures for all the main activities of the organization. These processes and procedures are constantly being reviewed and updated to ensure that they remain strong, transparent and reliable. For recent changes to IPCC procedures and related information see Review of Processes and Procedures (English) which covers all the recent changes to IPCC procedures approved by the Panel in the period 2010-2012.\n\nIn order to set priorities and guide decisions on whether to prepare Special Reports, Methodology Reports and Technical Papers, the IPCC has adopted the \"Decision Framework and Criteria for Special Reports, Methodology Reports and Technical Papers\". The IPCC also has a \"Conflict of Interest Policy\" and an \"IPCC Policy and Process for admitting Observer Organizations\".\n\nAssessment Reports\n\nThese are published materials comprising the full scientific and technical assessment of climate change, generally in three volumes, one for each of the Working Groups of the IPCC, plus a Synthesis Report. Each of the Working Group volumes is composed of individual chapters, an optional Technical Summary and a Summary for Policymakers. The Synthesis Report synthesizes and integrates materials contained within the Assessment Reports and Special Reports. It is written in a non-technical style suitable for policymakers and addresses a broad range of policy-relevant but policy-neutral questions. It is composed of a longer report and a Summary for Policymakers.\n\nIPCC Fifth Assessment Report: Climate Change (AR5)\n\nFull report available in English only\n\nClimate Change 2013\n\nWorking Group I Report\n\n\"The Physical Science Basis\"\n\nSummary for Policymakers\n\nSummary for Policymakers, Technical Summary and Frequently Asked Questions Volume\n\nFull Report\n\n(available in English only)\n\nClimate Change 2014\n\nWorking Group II Report\n\n\"Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability\"\n\nPart A - Global and Sectoral Aspects\n\nPart B - Regional Aspects\n\nSummary for Policymakers\n\nSummaries, Frequently Asked Questions, and Cross-Chapter Boxes Volume (available in English only, yet)\n\nFull Report Part A and Part B\n\n(available in English only)\n\nClimate Change 2014\n\nWorking Group III Report\n\n\"Mitigation of Climate Change\"\n\nSummary for Policymakers\n\n(available in English only, yet)\n\nTechnical Summary\n\n(available in English only, yet)\n\nFull Report\n\n(available in English only)\n\nClimate Change 2014\n\n\"Synthesis Report\"\n\nSummary for Policymakers\n\nLonger Report\n\nIPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change (AR4)\n\nFull report available in English only\n\nIPCC statement on the melting of Himalayan glaciers - 20 January 2010 (PDF)\n\nWorking Group I Report\n\n\"The Physical Science Basis\"\n\nCLICK HERE Working Group II Report\n\n\"Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability\"\n\nCLICK HERE Working Group III Report\n\n\"Mitigation of Climate Change\"\n\nCLICK HERE The AR4 Synthesis Report\n\nCLICK HERE\n\nIPCC Third Assessment Report: Climate Change 2001 (TAR)\n\nFull report available in English only\n\nWorking Group I:\n\nThe Scientific Basis Working Group II:\n\nImpacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability Working Group III:\n\nMitigation Synthesis Report\n\nCLICK HERE\n\nIPCC Second Assessment Report: Climate Change 1995 (SAR)\n\nDigitized by the Digitization and Microform Unit, UNOG Library, 2010\n\nFull report available in English only\n\n1992Supplementary Reports\n\nDigitized by the Digitization and Microform Unit, UNOG Library, 2010\n\nFull report available in English only\n\nIPCC First Assessment Report 1990 (FAR)\n\nDigitized by the Digitization and Microform Unit, UNOG Library, 2010\n\nIPCC Special Reports\n\nSpecial Reports are an assessment of a specific issue and generally follow the same structure as a volume of an Assessment Report.
