The purpose of the IPCC was to assess the state of knowledge on the various aspects of global change including science, environmental and socio-economic impacts and response strategies. The IPCC is recognized as the most authoritative scientific and technical voice on these issues, and its assessments had a profound influence on the negotiators of the United Nations Framework Convention, UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol. The IPCC is organized into three working groups plus a task force on national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories. Working Group I assesses the scientific aspects of the climate system its changes; Working Group II addresses the vulnerability of human and natural systems, the negative and positive consequences of climate change, and options for adapting to them; and Working Group III assesses options for limiting greenhouse gas emissions and otherwise mitigating these changes, as well as economic issues. Approximately 400 experts from some 120 countries are directly involved in drafting, revising and finalizing the IPCC reports and another 2,500 experts participate in the review process. The IPCC authors are nominated by governments and by international organizations including NGOs.\n\nYear: 2015\n\nFrom collection: Vital Climate Graphics\n\nCartographer: This\n\nGraphics included in same album\n\nView all media"
