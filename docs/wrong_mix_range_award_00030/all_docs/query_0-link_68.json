        "text": "Whereas the Nobel Prize is a prestigious international award that has been administered annually since 1901 by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden, and recognizes the world’s most outstanding achievements in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and peace;\n\nWhereas the Norwegian Nobel Committee, who selects the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, only receives nominations by invitation from qualified nominators;\n\nWhereas the Norwegian Nobel Committee received 181 nominations for the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize;\n\nWhereas the Norwegian Nobel Committee selected Vice President Albert Arnold (Al) Gore, Jr., and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as joint Nobel Peace Laureates for 2007, recognizing them for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change;\n\nWhereas Vice President Gore’s work on global warming was recently documented in the Academy Award-winning film, An Inconvenient Truth;\n\nWhereas the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of thousands of scientists and officials from more than 100 countries, has collaborated to achieve greater certainty as to the scale of global warming;\n\nWhereas the Earth’s climate is changing, warming by 1.1 to 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit since the Industrial Revolution;\n\nWhereas over the past 150 years, measured carbon dioxide concentrations have risen by more than one-third;\n\nWhereas the international scientific consensus is that global warming is caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions due to human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels;\n\nWhereas the United States contributes almost one-fifth of net global greenhouse gas emissions;\n\nWhereas global temperatures are likely to increase by 2 to 11 degrees Fahrenheit between 1990 and 2100, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change;\n\nWhereas during the 20th century, glaciers and ice caps have experienced widespread losses of mass, contributing to rising sea levels;\n\nWhereas higher incidences of drought and increased severe weather events result from rising temperatures;\n\nWhereas according to the United Nations Environment Program Report, climate change is one of the key factors in the civil unrest leading to the mass death, destruction, and displacement of the people of Sudan;\n\nWhereas extensive climate change will continue to cause large-scale migration and will contribute to the increased danger of violent conflicts and wars, both within and between states, around the world;\n\nWhereas poorer nations and the most vulnerable communities will bear the greatest burden of the effects of global warming as increasing temperatures and rising sea levels threaten food security, induce increased competition for resources, and cause significant migrations;\n\nWhereas Vice President Gore has been a leader in generating international interest in exploring the causes, potential consequences, and solutions for the climate change crisis;\n\nWhereas the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is credited with creating an increasingly informed consensus about the connection between human activities and global warming;\n\nWhereas the Norwegian Nobel Committee stated that Vice President Gore is probably the single individual who has done most to create greater worldwide understanding of the measures that need to be adopted to combat global warming; and\n\nWhereas the work of both Vice President Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has challenged the public to take individual and collective action to address the threat of climate change: Now, therefore, be it"
