        "text": "Al Gore's film An Inconvenient Truth was an unlikely box office hit\n\nClimate change campaigner Al Gore and the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have been jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThe committee cited \"their efforts to build up and disseminate knowledge about man-made climate change\".\n\nMr Gore, US vice-president under Bill Clinton, said he was \"deeply honoured\".\n\nMr Gore, 59, won an Oscar for his climate change film An Inconvenient Truth while the IPCC is the top authority on global warming.\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY\n\nThe liberals and the PC crowd now have their delusion raised to Nobel status\n\nJeremy Mason, Houston, USA\n\nIPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri said he was \"overwhelmed\" by the award.\n\nHe told a cheering crowd of colleagues and journalists outside his office in Delhi that he hoped the award would bring a \"greater awareness and a sense of urgency\" to the fight against global warming.\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee said it wanted to bring into sharper focus the \"increased danger of violent conflicts and wars, within and between states\" posed by climate change.\n\nIt highlighted a series of scientific reports issued over the last two decades by the IPCC, which comprises more than 2,000 leading climate change scientists and experts.\n\nThe reports had \"created an ever-broader informed consensus about the connection between human activities and global warming\", the committee said.\n\nMr Gore was praised as \"probably the single individual who has done most to create greater worldwide understanding of the measures that need to be adopted\", through his lectures, films and books.\n\nThe choice of recipients continues a trend of the Nobel Peace Prize redefining the potential sources of conflict and threats to peace, says the BBC's world affairs correspondent Mike Wooldridge.\n\n'Planetary emergency'\n\nSpeaking in Washington, Mr Gore praised the IPCC, \"whose members have worked tirelessly and selflessly for many years\".\n\nThe IPCC chairman said he was overwhelmed and stunned\n\n\"We face a true planetary emergency,\" Mr Gore warned. \"It is a moral and spiritual challenge to all of humanity.\"\n\nHe said he would donate his half of the $1.5m prize money to the Alliance for Climate Protection.\n\nMr Gore's selection has prompted supporters to renew calls for him to stand in next year's US presidential race. Until now, Mr Gore has said he will not run.\n\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (IPCC)\n\nEstablished in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep)\n\nMade up of more than 2,000 leading climate experts\n\nTasked with assessing scientific data on the risk of human-induced climate change, its potential impacts and options for mitigation\n\nDoes not carry out any research of its own\n\nFirst Assessment Report published in 1990; its Fourth Assessment Report called Climate Change 2007 to be published mid-November\n\nPresident George W Bush, who defeated Mr Gore in a bitter fight for the presidency in 2000, was \"happy\" at the \"important recognition\" for his rival and the IPCC, a White House spokesman said.\n\nHowever, the president was not about to change his more sceptical stance on global warming to a more \"Gore-style\" approach, the spokesman said.\n\nThe former vice-president has emerged as a leading climate campaigner. His 2006 documentary film, An Inconvenient Truth, was an unlikely box-office hit and won two Oscars - though it was also criticised by a British judge this week for containing nine errors, and for being alarmist.\n\nThe IPCC, established in 1988, is tasked with providing policymakers with neutral summaries of the latest expertise on climate change.\n\nThe organisation involves hundreds of scientists working to collate and evaluate the work of thousands more."
