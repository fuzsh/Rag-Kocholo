        "text": "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, is the world’s highest authority on climate science. It is made up of leading climate scientists from around the world who provide regular assessments of the latest climate science, and represents the scientific consensus on climate change.\n\nThe IPCC is publishing their sixth series of assessments, also known as the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). AR6 consists of three major reports published in 2021-22:\n\nA report on the physical science basis of climate change, which was released in August 2021;\n\nA report on climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, which was released in February 2022;\n\nA report on mitigation of climate change, which was released in April 2022.\n\nIn September 2022, the IPCC will also publish a Synthesis report for the sixth series.\n\nThe IPCC’s findings include findings with important implications for health, and that are of use when communicating about climate change and health. See the following resources and events, to learn more about the health implications of the IPCC’s findings."
