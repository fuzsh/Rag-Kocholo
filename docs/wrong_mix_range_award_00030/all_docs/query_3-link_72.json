        "text": "The earth's climate is changing. Multiple lines of evidence show changes in our weather, oceans, and ecosystems, such as:\n\nChanging temperature and precipitation patterns.1 2\n\nIncreases in ocean temperatures, sea level, and acidity.\n\nMelting of glaciers and sea ice.3\n\nChanges in the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme weather events.\n\nShifts in ecosystem characteristics, like the length of the growing season, timing of flower blooms, and migration of birds.\n\nThese changes are due to a buildup of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere and the warming of the planet due to the greenhouse effect.\n\nAtmospheric Data Trapped In Ice\n\nSource: Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, 2018\n\nThe Greenhouse Effect\n\nThe earth's temperature depends on the balance between energy entering and leaving the planet’s system. When sunlight reaches the earth’s surface, it can either be reflected back into space or absorbed by the earth. Incoming energy that is absorbed by the earth warms the planet. Once absorbed, the planet releases some of the energy back into the atmosphere as heat (also called infrared radiation). Solar energy that is reflected back to space does not warm the earth.\n\nCertain gases in the atmosphere absorb energy, slowing or preventing the loss of heat to space. Those gases are known as “greenhouse gases.” They act like a blanket, making the earth warmer than it would otherwise be. This process, commonly known as the “greenhouse effect,” is natural and necessary to support life. However, the recent buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from human activities has changed the earth's climate and resulted in dangerous effects to human health and welfare and to ecosystems.\n\nKey Greenhouse Gases\n\nMost of the warming since 1950 has been caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases.4 Greenhouse gases come from a variety of human activities, including burning fossil fuels for heat and energy, clearing forests, fertilizing crops, storing waste in landfills, raising livestock, and producing some kinds of industrial products.\n\nCarbon Dioxide\n\nCarbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas contributing to recent climate change. Carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere through burning fossil fuels, solid waste, trees, and other biological materials, and as a result of certain chemical reactions, such as cement manufacturing. Carbon dioxide is absorbed and emitted naturally as part of the carbon cycle, through plant and animal respiration, volcanic eruptions, and ocean-atmosphere exchange.\n\nSource: Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, May 30, 2019\n\nMethane\n\nBoth natural and human activities produce methane. For example, natural wetlands, agricultural activities, and fossil fuel extraction and transport all emit methane.\n\nNitrous Oxide\n\nNitrous oxide is produced mainly through agricultural activities and natural biological processes. Fossil fuel burning and industrial processes also create nitrous oxide.\n\nF-Gases\n\nChlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride, together called F-gases, are often used in coolants, foaming agents, fire extinguishers, solvents, pesticides, and aerosol propellants.\n\nOther Greenhouse Gases\n\nGround-Level Ozone\n\nGround-level ozone is created by a chemical reaction between emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds from automobiles, power plants, and other industrial and commercial sources in the presence of sunlight. In addition to trapping heat, ground-level ozone is a pollutant that can cause respiratory health problems and damage crops and ecosystems.\n\nWater Vapor\n\nWater vapor is another greenhouse gas and plays a key role in climate feedbacks because of its heat-trapping ability. Warmer air holds more moisture than cooler air. Therefore, as greenhouse gas concentrations increase and global temperatures rise, the total amount of water vapor in the atmosphere also increases, further amplifying the warming effect.5\n\nFor more information on greenhouse gases, see Greenhouse Gas Emissions.\n\nAerosols\n\nAerosols in the atmosphere can affect climate. Aerosols are microscopic (solid or liquid) particles that are so small that instead of quickly falling to the surface like larger particles, they remain suspended in the air for days to weeks. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and biomass, contribute to emissions of these substances, although some aerosols also come from natural sources such as volcanoes and marine plankton.\n\nUnlike greenhouse gases, the climate effects of aerosols vary depending on what they are made of and where they are emitted. Depending on their color and other factors, aerosols can either absorb or reflect sunlight. Aerosols that reflect sunlight, such as particles from volcanic eruptions or sulfur emissions from burning coal, have a cooling effect. Those that absorb sunlight, such as black carbon (a part of soot), have a warming effect.\n\nNot only can black carbon directly absorb incoming and reflected sunlight, but it can also absorb infrared radiation.6 Black carbon can also be deposited on snow and ice, darkening the surface and thereby increasing the snow's absorption of sunlight and accelerating melt.7 For more information, see the 2015 Report to Congress on Black Carbon. While reductions in all aerosols can lead to more warming, targeted reductions in black carbon emissions can reduce global warming. Warming and cooling aerosols can also interact with clouds, changing their ability to form and dissipate, as well as their reflectivity and precipitation rates. Clouds can contribute both to cooling, by reflecting sunlight, and warming, by trapping outgoing heat.\n\nClouds can have both warming and cooling effects on climate. They cool the planet by reflecting sunlight during the day, and they warm the planet by slowing the escape of heat to space (this is most apparent at night, as cloudy nights are usually warmer than clear nights).\n\nClimate change can lead to changes in the coverage, altitude, and reflectivity of clouds. These changes can then either amplify (positive feedback) or dampen (negative feedback) the original change. The net effect of these changes is likely an amplifying, or positive, feedback due mainly to increasing altitude of high clouds in the tropics, which makes them better able to trap heat, and reductions in coverage of lower-level clouds in the mid-latitudes, which reduces the amount of sunlight they reflect. The magnitude of this feedback is uncertain due to the complex nature of cloud/climate interactions.8\n\nVose, R.S., D.R. Easterling, K.E. Kunkel, A.N. LeGrande & M.F. Wehne. (2017).
