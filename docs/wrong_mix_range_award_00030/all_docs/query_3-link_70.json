        "text": "Hundreds of independent lines of evidence confirm that our climate is changing. For example, scientists have documented long-term changes around the world in temperature, precipitation, sea level, and the amount of heat stored in the ocean. Especially dramatic changes are underway in the Arctic, where warming is amplified by powerful feedbacks. Reductions in sea ice, land-based ice, and snow cover, along with the thawing of permafrost, are having profound impacts in the Arctic and beyond. Rising sea levels, caused mainly by the expansion of seawater as it warms, along with billions of tons of water added to the ocean each year from melting glaciers, ice caps, and ice sheets, are affecting coastal communities in many parts of the world, including places like South Florida, Chesapeake Bay, and low-lying communities along the Gulf Coast in the United States. Changes in the length of growing seasons and pollen seasons, the timing of bird migrations, and range shifts in plants and wildlife provide still more evidence for recent changes in climate.\n\nThe Greenhouse Effect\n\nGreenhouse gases, such as CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide, act like a blanket around the planet. They trap energy in the atmosphere and cause it to warm. This phenomenon, called the greenhouse effect, is natural and necessary to support life on Earth: without it the Earthâs average temperature would be around 0Â°F. But scientists agree that the continuing buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphereâcaused mainly by the burning of fossil fuels for energyâwill upset the natural energy balance and change Earth's climate, with potentially dangerous risks to human health, infrastructure, the economy, and ecosystems.Â\n\nClimate scientists have concluded that humans are largely responsible for the climate change that has occurred since the 1950s.[1]Â Human activitiesâsuch as burning fossil fuels for energy, cultivating crops, raising livestock, and clearing forestsâare releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.Â These greenhouse gases are being emitted faster than forests and the oceans can remove them, causing them to build up in the atmosphere.Â\n\nThe atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) has increased by more than 40% since pre-industrial times, and the current CO2Â level is higher than it has been in at least 800,000 years.[1] We know that human activities are the cause of this increase because the CO2Â emitted by burning fossil fuels carries a distinct chemical fingerprint thatâs detectable in the atmosphere.[2]\n\nScientists have known since the 1800s that greenhouse gases trap heat, preventing it from escaping to space. The warming effect of greenhouse gases is amplified by feedbacks, especially from water vapor (a powerful and plentiful natural greenhouse gas),Â leading to more warming and changes in climate.[1] Natural influences on climate, such as changes in solar radiation, natural cycles, volcanic eruptions, and the climateâs normal year-to-year variability, canât fully explain the current warming trend.[1]Â The climate changes observed in recent decades follow a number of patternsâsuch as cooling at high altitudes and more warming at night than during the dayâthat are consistent with what scientists would expect from an increase in greenhouse gases rather than changes in solar variability or other natural causes.[1]\n\nThe Earthâs average temperature has risen by 1.5Â°F over the past century, and climate scientists estimate it will rise another 0.5 to 8.6Â°F by the end of this century, depending, in part, on future emissions.[1]Â That may not sound like much to worry about, since most of us experience much greater temperature changes over the course of a day or from season to season. But the global average temperature during the height of the last ice age was only 5 to 9Â°F cooler than it is today.[3]Â Relatively small changes in the planetâs average temperature can mean big changes in local and regional climate, creating risks to public health and safety[4],Â water resources, agriculture, infrastructure, and ecosystems.[5]Â Following are some examples:Â [5]\n\nIncreasing heat waves: Heat waves have become more frequent in the United States in recent decades.Â Climate scientists expect the number of days with temperatures above 90Â°F to increase in the United States as the climate changes, especially toward the end of this century.Â\n\nMore extreme weather: In addition to heat waves, changes in precipitation patterns, including extreme precipitation events, storms, and floods, are becoming more common and more severe in many regions, and this is expected to continue.Â\n\nIntensified droughts: Higher temperatures lead to increased rates of evaporation and can lead to more rapid drying of soils. Without reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, longer-term droughts are expected to intensify in much of the Southwest, the Great Plains, and the Southeast.\n\nImpacts on crops: Over the past 40 years, climate disruptions to agricultural production have increased, and this is expected to continue.\n\nImpacts on health: Climate change is increasing our exposure to extreme temperatures, extreme weather events; degraded air quality; diseases transmitted through food, water, and insects; and stresses to mental health and well-being.Â These threats to human health are expected to increase with continued climate change.\n\nMore wildfires: The area burned by wildfire in parts of western North America is expected to double (or more) for each 1.8Â°F increase in global average temperature.[6]\n\nRising sea levels: Global sea level has risen by about eight inches since the late 1800s, and is projected to rise another 1 to 4 feet by the end of this century.Â Flooding is becoming more frequent along the U.S. coastline, especially in the Mid-Atlantic region where the land is simultaneously sinking.\n\nImpacts on health: Climate change is increasing our exposure to extreme temperatures, extreme weather events; degraded air quality; diseases transmitted through food, water, and insects; and stresses to mental health and well-being.Â These threats to human health are expected to increase with continued climate change.\n\nClimate change endangers our health by affecting our food and water sources, the air we breathe, the weather we experience, and our interactions with the built and natural environments. As the climate continues to change, the risks to human health continue to grow.\n\nAlthough every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change, some populations are disproportionately vulnerable, including those with low income, some communities of color, immigrant groups (including those with limited English proficiency), Indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, persons with disabilities, and persons with preexisting orÂ chronicÂ medical conditions.[4]\n\nBy making choices that reduce greenhouse gas pollution, and preparing for the changes expected in the future, we can reduce risks from climate change. Our decisions today will shape the world we live in and the world we leave to our children and grandchildren.Â\n\nDue to time lags in the climate system and the fact that CO2 stays in the atmosphere for hundreds or thousands of years, the climate will continue to warm until at least mid-century regardless of what we do today to reduce emissions (see graph below). If we fail to make substantial cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, the Earth will keep warming for centuries to come.[1]\n\nBut it is not too late to address climate change and reduce the risks of impacts in the second half of this century and beyond. Doing so will require substantial cuts in greenhouse emissions. This will require stepping up improvements in energy efficiency, reducing waste, slowing deforestation, and shifting to cleaner energy sources.Â\n\nCommunities can also prepare for the changes in the decades ahead by identifying and reducing their vulnerabilities and incorporating consideration of climate change risks into planning and development. Such actions can ensure that the most vulnerable populationsâsuch as young children, older adults, and people living in povertyâare protected from health and safety threats from climate change."
