        "text": "Overview\n\nClimate change is the greatest environmental threat confronting the world. While there have been natural shifts in Earth's weather patterns for eons, the changing climate over the past few hundred years has been driven overwhelmingly by human activities. Activities such as burning fossil fuels increase the concentration of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, trapping more heat from the sun and raising global temperatures. Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas driving global climate change, though methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and other gases also contribute to a warming planet.\n\nThe effects of climate change can be seen worldwide in all aspects of life. Climate change is causing vast shifts in ecosystems and weather patterns, including stronger hurricanes, more intense wildfires, longer droughts, and an ice-free Arctic. Climate change is also detrimental to human health, could shrink economies, endangers national security, and is affecting and will continue to affect every part of society.\n\nSince 1880, the average global temperature has increased by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius). Two-thirds of that warming has occurred since 1975.\n\nCarbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are higher than at any point in the last 800,000 years.\n\nIn 2020, burning fossil fuels accounted for 92 percent of U.S. human-caused carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nMany countries that have contributed the least in terms of global carbon dioxide emissions will experience some of the worst consequences of climate change.\n\nThere is an urgent need to address climate change. Energy efficiency and renewable energy are the fastest, safest, cleanest, and most cost-effective means of reducing our use of fossil fuels and preventing the worst effects of climate change. Nature-based solutions, like ecosystem conservation and climate-smart agricultural practices, help protect biodiversity and natural systems while also storing carbon dioxide. In addition, techniques such as the direct capture of carbon dioxide from the air (direct air capture) and the capture, use, and storage of carbon emitted by industrial facilities will be necessary to reduce the carbon dioxide levels already present in the atmosphere.\n\nRead more on climate change: Fossil Fuels | National Security and Energy Independence\n\nRapid, Human-Driven Change\n\nSeveral gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, exist naturally in the atmosphere and contribute to the warming of the Earth's surface by trapping heat from the sun—a process known as the greenhouse effect. When the share of such greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is stable, the effect is beneficial, making surface temperatures friendly to life on Earth and reducing temperature swings.\n\nHuman activities like burning fossil fuels emit potent greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, among others. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in 2021 was 417 parts per million (ppm), which is higher than it has ever been over the last 800,000 years. Before the Industrial Revolution in North America and Europe, which began in about 1760, carbon dioxide levels averaged about 280 ppm. The rate at which carbon dioxide is being added to the atmosphere has been accelerating as well. In the 1960s, the growth rate was about 0.6 ppm per year. During the 2010s, that rate increased to 2.4 ppm per year.\n\nScientific Consensus\n\nThere is broad scientific agreement that human activities, most notably the burning of fossil fuels for energy, have led to the rapid buildup in atmospheric greenhouse gases. Over 97 percent of actively publishing scientists agree, and have written so in numerous peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n\nIn a 2021 report providing an update on the physical science of climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a global body of the United Nations that provides scientific information about the climate crisis, wrote: “It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred.”\n\nThe Hard Numbers Behind the Consensus\n\nUsing air bubbles trapped in ice cores, scientists are able to measure the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as far back as 800,000 years ago. They observed that carbon dioxide levels started increasing exponentially in the mid-20th century, to levels higher than at any time over the past 800,000 years. The rate at which carbon dioxide is being added to the atmosphere continues to increase. In the 1960s, about 0.6 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide were added to the atmosphere each year; in the 2010s, that rate increased to 2.3 ppm per year.\n\nAs the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased, so have global temperatures. Since 1880, the average global temperature has increased by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius).\n\nEffects of Climate Change\n\nClimate change is a global challenge. The effects of rising temperatures, melting ice, rising sea levels, stronger storms, more frequent droughts, more intense wildfires, and other impacts will be felt across the planet. However, not all countries will experience the effects at the same time or with the same intensity.\n\nClimate change is already having catastrophic consequences for people around the world, from deadly heatwaves in Japan to mega-fires in California to powerful typhoons in India to severe droughts in Europe. Disasters such as these will only increase with the continued fossil-fuel burning that drives more carbon dioxide emissions and higher temperatures.\n\nMass migrations are also already occurring because of climate change. An average of 20 million people are forced to move each year because of climate-driven hazards, a number that is expected to continue to grow.\n\nAs atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide rise, oceans also absorb more carbon, causing ocean waters to become acidic. Acidic conditions make it more difficult for organisms such as corals and crustaceans to form hard shells or skeletons, ultimately affecting the entire marine food chain—and human consumption of seafood.\n\nOverall, climate change is affecting every aspect of our lives and the lives of every living organism on this planet. It is an existential threat that requires global cooperation to solve.\n\nSolutions: Clean Energy, Energy Efficiency, Nature-Based Solutions, Carbon Capture\n\nWe can improve the energy efficiency of our buildings, vehicles, and energy generation sector. We can transition to clean renewable energy resources that do not emit new greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. In addition, responsible land management practices that protect forests and soils can help keep carbon out of the atmosphere and conserve ecosystems. Ramping up the deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies will not only provide environmental benefits—it will also provide jobs and economic growth.\n\nIn addition to the transition to clean energy, conserving our ecosystems and implementing nature-based solutions such as wetland preservation, living shoreline installation, and climate-smart agricultural practices can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lessen climate change impacts.\n\nHowever, a certain amount of warming is inevitable based on past and current emissions. Implementing carbon capture techniques like direct air capture will be necessary to address the carbon dioxide that has already been released and prevent the worst effects of climate change. Overall, a quick implementation of all of these solutions will be critical to addressing this planetary crisis.\n\nFor more information see:\n\nEESI Climate Change Frequently Asked Questions\n\nThe United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\n\nIPCC Sixth Assessment Report on Climate Change (2021-2022)\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA): \"How Do We Know Climate Change Is Real?\"\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA): “Scientific Consensus: Earth's Climate Is Warming”\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA): “Climate Change”\n\nU.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP)\n\nUSGCRP Fourth National Climate Assessment (2018)\n\nLast updated in October 2022.\n\nLearn more about Climate Change\n\nEESI at 40: How EESI Started Helping Rural Communities Save Energy\n\nFarm Bill Climate Side-by-Sides (2024)\n\nMaximizing the Impact of Natural Climate Solutions\n\nCatawba College Sets Record as First College in the Southeast to Achieve Carbon Neutrality\n\nPublic Health\n\nCities Leading the Way on Nature-Based Solutions\n\nPowering Affordable Clean Energy in Rural Areas: Showcasing Three Rural Cooperatives\n\nEESI at 40: Working at the Intersection of Climate Science and Policy\n\nImplementation Update: How Has the IRA Advanced Conservation on Farms?\n\nMaryland Comptroller Leans into Climate Resilience for a Sustainable Financial Future"
