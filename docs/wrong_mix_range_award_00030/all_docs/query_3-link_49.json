        "text": "In a steady climate the Earth receives as much energy from the Sun as it sends back into space. Some of the solar energy is reflected, for example by clouds and small particles (aerosols), some of it is absorbed by greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, ozone and water vapour, and some is reflected or absorbed by Earth's surface. Climate forcing measures the imbalance in the Earthâ€™s energy budget caused by a perturbation of the climate system, for example changes in atmospheric composition driven by human activities. Climate forcing, also known as Radiative Forcing, therefore determines the change in globally-averaged temperature change due to the natural or human-induced changes to the energy budget. Increases in greenhouse gas concentrations over the industrial era are responsible for a positive climate forcing, causing a gain of energy in the climate system. In contrast, changes in atmospheric aerosol concentrations result in a negative climate forcing leading to a loss of energy. It is the balance between these various climate forcings that drive the change in global temperature.\n\nCAMS provides estimates of climate forcings separately for carbon dioxide, methane, tropospheric ozone, stratospheric ozone, interactions between anthropogenic aerosols and radiation, and interactions between anthropogenic aerosols and clouds. Climate forcing estimates produced by CAMS follow the definition of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and therefore are defined with respect to the year 1750 and include adjustment of stratospheric temperatures for greenhouse gases and ozone.\n\nThe radiative forcing of carbon dioxide and methane is fairly uniform across the globe, with a maximum in the Tropics. In contrast, the radiative forcing of tropospheric ozone and aerosols varies strongly on regional scales, with a maximum in the polluted Northern Hemisphere.\n\nData source and disclaimer: CAMS Climate Forcing estimates from version 2 products, based on the CAMS Reanalysis. Numbers give the net shortwave and longwave radiative forcing. Radiative forcing has been adjusted to account for changes in stratospheric temperatures but does not include rapid adjustments of tropospheric temperatures and moisture.\n\nAccess the CAMS Climate Forcing products\n\nDownload global monthly average time series"
