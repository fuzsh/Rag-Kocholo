The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was set up in 1988 to provide comprehensive assessments of the state of scientific, technical and socio-economic knowledge on climate change, its causes, potential impacts and response strategies.

Since its inception in 1988 the IPCC has prepared five multi-volume assessment reports, which can be accessed under Publications.

The IPCC and former US Vice-President Al Gore were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for their work on climate change.

The Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)

In 2014, the IPCC finalized the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), which comprises three contributions on the physical science basis; impacts, adaptation and vulnerability; and mitigation of climate change prepared by the IPCC's three Working Groups, plus a Synthesis Report. The Working Group I contribution was accepted and approved in September 2013. The Working Groups II and III contributions were accepted and approved in March and April 2014 respectively, and the Synthesis Report was approved in November 2014.

Compared to previous reports, AR5 puts greater emphasis on assessing the socio-economic aspects of climate change and implications for sustainable development, regional aspects, risk management and the framing of a response through both adaptation and mitigation.

IPCC Special Reports

Besides the Assessment Reports, the IPCC publishes Special Reports on specific topics such as aviation; regional impacts of climate change; technology transfer; emissions scenarios; land use; land use change and forestry; carbon dioxide capture and storage; and on the relationship between safeguarding the ozone layer and the global climate system. They can be accessed under Publications.

The latest of these Special Reports were released in 2011:

Methodology Reports

The IPCC also prepares methodologies and guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories through the Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (TFI). These help Parties to the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol to draw up national inventories of greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks. The last major publication was the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

The TFI has produced two sets of additional guidance that were adopted and accepted by the IPCC at its 37th Session held on 14-18 October 2013 in Batumi, Georgia:

the 2013 Supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Wetlands, (in English) provides methodological guidance on lands with wet and drained soils, and constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment

the 2013 Revised Supplementary Methods and Good Practice Guidance Arising from the Kyoto Protocol, (in English) provides Parties to the UNFCCC who report under the Kyoto Protocol with the additional guidance they need for its second commitment period.

These supplementary guidelines were prepared at the invitation of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice of the UNFCCC and Conference of the Parties Serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC respectively.

For more information please see the TFI website (English).

The Task Group on Data and Scenario Support for Impact and Climate Analysis

The Task Group on Data and Scenario Support for Impact and Climate Analysis (TGICA) facilitates the distribution and application of climate change related data and scenarios. TGICA oversees a Data Distribution Centre (DDC) that provides data sets, scenarios of climate change and other environmental and socio-economic conditions, and other materials (e.g. technical guidelines on the use of scenarios and fact sheets offering clarifying explanations/concise guidance on topical issues).

For more information visit the TGICA page (English).

The World Meteorological Organization

Headquarters in Geneva. IPCC Secretariat

is hosted by WMO

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change. It was established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988 to provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts. In the same year, the UN General Assembly endorsed the action by WMO and UNEP in jointly establishing the IPCC.

The IPCC is a scientific body. It reviews and assesses the most recent scientific, technical and socio-economic literature produced worldwide relevant to the understanding of climate change. It does not conduct any research nor does it monitor climate related data or parameters.

It is an intergovernmental body. It is open to all member countries of the United Nations and WMO. Currently 195 countries are members of the IPCC. The Panel meets at least once a year in plenary at the level of government representatives where the main decisions about the IPCC work programme are taken and Bureau Members, including the Chair, are elected. Governments participate also in the scoping of reports, nomination of authors, the review process and accept, adopt and approve reports at plenary sessions.

Because of its scientific and intergovernmental nature, the IPCC embodies a unique opportunity to provide rigorous and balanced scientific information to decision-makers. By endorsing the IPCC reports, governments acknowledge the authority of their scientific content. The work of the organization is therefore policy-relevant and yet policy-neutral, never policy-prescriptive.

How the IPCC works

Thousands of scientists from all over the world contribute to the work of the IPCC on a voluntary basis as authors, contributors and reviewers. None of them is paid by the IPCC.

The Panel takes major decisions at plenary sessions of government representatives. A central IPCC Secretariat supports the work of the IPCC.

The IPCC is currently organized in three Working Groups and a Task Force. The Working Groups and Task Force are assisted by technical support units (TSUs), which are hosted and financially supported by the government of the developed country Co-Chair of that Working Group/Task Force. A TSU has also been established to support work on the Synthesis Report.

Working Group I deals with the physical science basis of climate change, Working Group II with climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, and Working Group III with mitigation of climate change. The Working Groups meet in plenary at the level of government representatives. The main objective of the Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories is to develop and refine a methodology for the calculation and reporting of national greenhouse gas emissions and removals.

Besides the Working Groups and Task Force, further task groups and steering groups may be established for a limited or longer duration to consider a specific topic or question. One example is the Task Group on Data and Scenario Support for Impact and Climate Analysis (TGICA).

For more information on how the IPCC works visit the Structure pages (in English).

Timeline - highlights of IPCC history

The IPCC's work is guided by a set of principles and clear procedures for all the main activities of the organization. These processes and procedures are constantly being reviewed and updated to ensure that they remain strong, transparent and reliable. For recent changes to IPCC procedures and related information see Review of Processes and Procedures (English) which covers all the recent changes to IPCC procedures approved by the Panel in the period 2010-2012.

In order to set priorities and guide decisions on whether to prepare Special Reports, Methodology Reports and Technical Papers, the IPCC has adopted the "Decision Framework and Criteria for Special Reports, Methodology Reports and Technical Papers". The IPCC also has a "Conflict of Interest Policy" and an "IPCC Policy and Process for admitting Observer Organizations".

Assessment Reports

These are published materials comprising the full scientific and technical assessment of climate change, generally in three volumes, one for each of the Working Groups of the IPCC, plus a Synthesis Report. Each of the Working Group volumes is composed of individual chapters, an optional Technical Summary and a Summary for Policymakers. The Synthesis Report synthesizes and integrates materials contained within the Assessment Reports and Special Reports. It is written in a non-technical style suitable for policymakers and addresses a broad range of policy-relevant but policy-neutral questions. It is composed of a longer report and a Summary for Policymakers.
