When his experiments on animals fail, he finds the ideal substitute – Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a slow-witted gardener. Dr. Angelo's goal is to benefit his human guinea pig and ultimately mankind itself, but evil lurks the guise of \"the Shop,\" a shadowy group that seeks to use the technology to create an invincible war machine. When the experiments change the simple Jobe into a superhuman being, the stage is set for a Jekyll-and-Hyde struggle for the control of Jobe's mind and the future of the world.\n\nTHE LAWNMOWER MAN was directed by Brett Leonard from a script by Leonard and Gimel Everett. The film stars Pierce Brosnan, Jeff Fahey, Jenny Wright and Geoffrey Lewis.\n\nThe film hits Blu-ray June 20th. You can pre-order the film on Blu-ray from Amazon\n\nPost by eaz35173 on\n\nnews.boxofficebuz.com/article/box-office-buz-dvd-and-blu-ray-releases-for-june-20-2017\n\nLastly this month is the Blu-ray debut of a 90's sci-fi cult classic, The Lawnmower Man. Jeff Fahey plays Jobe Smith, a simple-minded gardener taken in by a scientist, Dr. Angelo (Pierce Brosnan) who uses Jobe as a guinea pig for a new intelligence enhancing drug. But as the treatments progress and Jobe becomes smarter, Dr. Angelo starts to lose control of the experiment as Jobe becomes something more than human.\n\nThe Lawnmower Man, while full of very dated special effects now, is still an incredibly fun sci-fi/horror yarn. Fahey is great in the role of Jobe playing him brilliantly as both a childlike gardener and a powerful villain. Brosnan is great as always and Brett Leonard's direction is solid with great pacing and a strong story arc. This new Blu-ray contains the original theatrical cut as well as the much better director's cut, both with new 4K transfers. This one is well worth revisiting even if it was from the dawn of CG with some questionable visuals. They still work within the context of the story though and make The Lawnmower Man worthy of its cult classic status."
