        "text": "The character actor and father of Juliette Lewis, Geoffrey Lewis, has died at the age of 79. Mostly known for his work on the Clint Eastwood classics HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, EVERY WHICH WAY BUT LOOSE, ANY WHICH WAY YOU CAN and more recently MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL, Lewis died of natural causes in California. Lewis also appeared in THE DEVIL’S REJECTS for director Rob Zombie.\n\nWorking right up until the time of his death in low-budget ‘baseball noir’ HIGH AND OUTSIDE, Lewis appeared in over 200 TV, short and feature productions as an actor, being nominated for a Golden Globe award for his work on the 1980 series Flo. His glittering TV career also saw him appear on popular shows like Falcon Crest, Murder She Wrote and Little House On The Prairie.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Paula Hochhalter, Juliette Lewis and nine other children. Rest in peace Geoffrey.\n\nSource: Assorted"
