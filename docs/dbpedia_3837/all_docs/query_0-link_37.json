        "text": "Technology turns mean yet again in \"The Lawnmower Man,\" a science-fiction melodrama based on a 1975 short story by Stephen King.\n\nThe film is about Jobe (Jeff Fahey), a sweet-natured, mentally retarded young slob who, as a result of experiments with a pink serum, begins to comb his hair. He also turns into a brilliant megalomaniac. Having once been happy mowing lawns, Jobe suddenly dreams of becoming one with a main-frame computer and ruling the world.\n\nOn his way to the top he takes time off to do ghastly things to his guardian, an old priest who used to beat him, and to the town bully, who humiliated him.\n\nThe two principal scientists are played by Pierce Brosnan, who is the good one, and Mark Bringleson, the bad one. The movie was directed by Brett Leonard and written by him and Gimel Everett.\n\n\"The Lawn Mower Man\" depends mostly on a lot of colorful video-game-like special effects. They are very loud but, after a while, the noise and the lights induce a torpor that is quite soothing.\n\n\"The Lawnmower Man,\" which has been rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), has vulgar language, violence and some simulated sex. The Lawnmower Man Directed by Brett Leonard; screenplay by Mr. Leonard and Gimel Everett, based on a story by Stephen King; director of photography, Russell Carpenter; edited by Alan Baumgarten; production designer, Alex McDowell; produced by Mr. Everett; released by New Line Cinema. Running time: 108 minutes. This film is rated R. Jobe Smith . . . Jeff Fahey Dr. Lawrence Angelo . . . Pierce Brosnan Marnie Burke . . . Jenny Wright Sebastian Timms . . . Mark Bringleson Terry McKeen . . . Geoffrey Lewis Father McKeen . . . Jeremy Slate Director . . . Dean Norris"
