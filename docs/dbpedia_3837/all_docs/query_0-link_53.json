        "text": "violence\n\nStrong violence includes bloody shootings.\n\nlanguage\n\nStrong language is used ('f**k', 'motherf**ker'), and is accompanied by other milder terms ('freaking', 'shit', 'God' and 'damn').\n\nsex\n\nThere is strong sex, which is accompanied by breast and buttock nudity. On one occasion, a woman rubs a man's crotch while asking him if he's \"hard\".\n\nsexual violence and sexual threat\n\nWhile in a computer simulation, a man's avatar turns into a monstrous figure that attempts to force itself on a woman under duress. However, the man soon regains control after insisting the computer took temporary charge of his mind. There are also other references to sexual violence.\n\nThere is repeated use of the discriminatory term ‘retard’. Moderate blood and injury detail is seen, largely in the aftermath of violence. A man with fantastical abilities uses his powers to stalk and kill others."
