        "text": "LOS ANGELES, Calif., Oct. 11, 2017 (SEND2PRESS NEWSWIRE) — Standard 17, LLC announces “High & Outside : a baseball noir,” also nominated for Best Screenplay & Best Film at the prestigious 2017 Raindance Film Festival in London. The film premieres Oct. 27 & Nov. 1, 2017 at the Austin Film Festival. “High & Outside” is about an independent league baseball player, Phil Harding (Phil Donlon), who takes desperate measures to keep his imperiled big-league dream alive, which threatens to destroy his already fragile family.\n\nThe film casts Golden Globe nominee Geoffrey Lewis in his last starring role as Phil’s domineering father, baseball legend Len Harding. Joining him is Ernie Hudson (“Ghostbusters”) as Phil’s manager, Lindsey Haun (“True Blood”) as Phil’s wife, Jason Richter (“Free Willy”) as Phil’s best friend, David Yow (“The Jesus Lizard”) as Lewis’ caregiver, Eddie Jemison (“Oceans 11”) as Sal, and David Proval (“Everyone Loves Raymond”) as Don.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune’s Rick Kogan said, “This is a film that will stay with you forever. Gritty and honest, it is filled with great performances that show us real human beings, flawed but compelling. It is, to borrow a phrase, a home run.”\n\nGeoffrey Lewis passed away in 2015 shortly after finishing the film. Lewis was truly one of the great American actors of our time with over 50 years in film and TV, as well as a staple in most of Clint Eastwood’s pictures. Eastwood said, “He was a wonderful actor and terrific performer.”\n\n“High & Outside” is Director Evald Johnson’s second feature. Johnson comes from non-scripted TV, along with Producers John Cook and Ellen Philips. Johnson grew up the son of his once beloved and then befallen MLB father Tim Johnson, and his story inspired “High & Outside : a baseball noir.” Dan O’Dair wrote the screenplay. Music score by Alexander Hacke of legendary German noise band, Einstürzende Neubauten. No distributor has been selected yet.\n\nMORE INFORMATION:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/highoutside\n\nWebsite: http://www.highandoutside.com/\n\nTwitter: @highandoutmovie\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/highandoutsidemovie/\n\nStandard 17, LLC is a full service production and post- production company for film and television, and is run by Evald Johnson and John Cook.
