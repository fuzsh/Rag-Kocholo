        "text": "Talented and highly capable character actor Geoffrey Lewis, with rustic (sometimes sour-faced) looks, grew up in Rhode Island but was moved out to California at the age of ten. Lewis was very keen on the dramatic arts at high school, but often preferred to put on his own one-man shows rather than participate in larger school productions. His drama teacher took note of his growing talent and referred him to the Plymouth Theater in Massachusetts, where he appeared in summer stock. Afterwards he appeared in several off-Broadway productions in New York City. After spending considerable time traveling, in both the United States and abroad, Lewis turned his attention back to his love of the dramatic arts, and scored his first minor movie role in Greenhorn (1972) as a somewhat jovial but deadly cowhand. He then cropped up as gangster Harry Pierpont in Jagd auf Dillinger (1973) before beginning a long association with Clint Eastwood, starting off with Ein Fremder ohne Namen (1973), then as kind-hearted thief Eddie Goody in Die Letzten beißen die Hunde (1974), as Clint's buddy Orville Boggs in Der Mann aus San Fernando (1978) and Mit Vollgas nach San Fernando (1980), then as a henpecked husband in Bronco billy (1980), as Ricky Z in Pink Cadillac (1989), and in Mitternacht im Garten von Gut und Böse (1997) also as patient Michael Kahn in Tödliche Visionen (1990).\n\nEqually busy on the small screen, he has guest-starred in dozens of episodes of high profile TV series. Additionally, he received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in the series Flo (1980). Apart from his extensive film and TV exposure, Lewis is also a member of the rather unique musical/storytelling \"Celestial Navigations,\" along with award-winning composer songwriter Geoff Levin. Their performances have received terrific reviews from some of Hollywood's top actors and noted musicians, including Chick Corea. As Geoffrey Lewis approaches his seventh decade, nothing seems likely to slow down this multi-talented actor, storyteller and engaging entertainer!"
