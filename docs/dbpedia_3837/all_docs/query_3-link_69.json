        "text": "A film based in the concept of the American west captures our attention today with this review of the Richard Donner directed movie Maverick (1994). Written by William Goldman and based on Maverick (TV Series 1957-1962) created by Roy Huggins, the movie looks comedically at the gambling world with a penchant for hustling others out of their money.\n\nBret Maverick Jr., as portrayed by Mel Gibson, opens Maverick on the paddle steamer Lauren Belle. Maverick Jr. aims to prove his superior skills at playing five-card draw in a poker tournament while collecting $3,000 of a $25,000 entrance fee needed for a later tournament, encountering a grouchy gambler named Angel and a young con artist named Annabelle Bransford. Alfred Molina portrayed Angel as Jodie Foster portrayed Bransford. Angel takes to what he perceives as being cheated in the card game by Maverick Jr., which is based in a correct view of what actually happened.\n\nMarshal Zane Cooper, as portrayed by James Garner, encounters Bret Maverick Jr. and Annabelle Bransford as the pair makes a haste getaway from the rigged card game in Crystal River by stagecoach. The group nearly plunge into a ravine following the sudden death of their coach driver, later aiding a group of missionary settlers robbed by bandits disguised as native Americans. The trio of Cooper, Bransford and Maverick Jr. get cornered by a group of the natives led by Joseph, an unknown friend of Maverick Jr. for the others as portrayed by Graham Greene. Another elaborate ruse to swindle another group out of money that Joseph owes Maverick Jr. ties to the larger sequence of running action and gags that exemplify the action-based comedy underlining much of this Western‘s point-of-view.\n\nThe tournament that has been the operating objective for the movie’s tension throughout leads to the revelation of more previously unknown connections and motivations among movie characters, including for one Commodore Duvall as portrayed by James Coburn. Anyone found to be cheating, comically, gets summarily thrown overboard from the paddle steamer of the tournament. The resolution to tensions at this card game reveal much with panache worthy of the movie, with still further shenanigans culminating in further panache that brings forth more hidden planning that make clear the comedy Western this movie has been.\n\nComing into the movie expecting humor, entertainment and a meandering good time is the right point-of-view for experiencing this film. I grant Maverick as directed by Richard Donner 3.75-stars on a scale of one-to-five.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, July 31, 2024"
