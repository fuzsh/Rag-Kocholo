        "text": "Character actor Geoffrey Lewis, known for his long working relationship with Clint Eastwood, a slew of roles in TV and film and as the father of actress Juliette Lewis, died April 7 at his home in Woodland Hills, CA. He was 79.\n\nFrequently appearing in Westerns during his early career, he is best known as a frequent fixture of Eastwood’s films. His appearances include Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil, Any Which Way You Can, Thunderbolt And Lightfoot, and High Plains Drifter. He also had a supporting role on the short-lived Alice spinoff Flo, from 1980-81, for which he earned a Golden Globe nomination. He appeared in such films as Night Of The Comet and Maverick and TV shows including Law & Order: Criminal Intent and Hawaii Five-O.\n\nBorn in 1935 in San Diego, Lewis spent his childhood in Rhode Island before moving back to California with his family at age 10. Lewis was a longtime member of the Church of Scientology, for which he credited his career success.\n\nAlong with his daughter Juliette, he is survived by his wife Paula and nine other children."
