        "text": "(July 31, 1935 – April 7, 2015)\n\nGeoffrey Lewis was an American character actor. Lewis was known for his film roles alongside Robert Redford and Clint Eastwood\n\nLewis’s filmography includes television shows such as Law & Order: Criminal Intent and My Name is Earl, as well as films such as Down in the Valley, The Butcher, Maverick, and When Every Day Was the Fourth of July. In 1979, he appeared in Salem’s Lot. He later played opposite Polly Holliday in the Alice spin-off Flo (1980-81).\n\nLewis worked frequently with actor-director Clint Eastwood in several films including Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Pink Cadillac, Any Which Way You Can, Bronco Billy, Every Which Way but Loose, Thunderbolt and Lightfoot and High Plains Drifter.\n\nLewis was a Scientologist. In 2005, he was quoted on the official church website: “The wins that I’ve had with Scientology coincide directly with the rise in my career. It’s hard to pick out any one specific piece of tech, suffice it to say that I as an artist was surrounded with nonsurvival considerations, actions and valences – all of my own making. Through my use of Scientology technology I have eradicated most of these things and continue to eradicate them, giving me more freedom and intention to create into the future. And, by the by, a great deal more altitude, a more inclusive point from which to view life – past, present and future…”\n\nOn April 7, 2015, Lewis died of natural causes in his home in Woodland Hills. Lewis is the father of nine; actress and singer Juliette Lewis, Lightfield Lewis, Brandy Lewis, Miles Lewis, Matthew Lewis, and Hannah Lewis."
