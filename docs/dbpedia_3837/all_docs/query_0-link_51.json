        "text": "Geoffrey Lewis, an actor with over 200 screen credits, died yesterday from natural causes.\n\nThe 79-year-old was a frequent collaborator with Clint Eastwood, starring in films such as Every Which Way But Loose and Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, and was most recently seen in war comedy Retreat! with Richard Roundtree. The father of Juliette Lewis, he was also nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance in 80s TV comedy Flo.\n\nHigh Plains Drifter\n\nLewis started his career in westerns with small roles in The Culpeper Cattle Co and Bad Company, both in 1972. But it was the next year that gave him his first major role, alongside Clint Eastwood, in High Plains Drifter, where he played outlaw Stacey Bridges. It marked the first of many such films.\n\nFletch Lives\n\nAfter showing his worth in comedies such as Every Which Way But Loose and Any Which Way You Can, Lewis had a memorable role as the Ku Klux Klan leader in the Chevy Chase sequel Fletch Lives. Lewis continued to see success outside of his work with Eastwood, especially on TV with roles in Little House on the Prairie, Murder She Wrote and The A-Team.\n\nDouble Impact\n\nIn 1991, Lewis scored a major role opposite both versions of Jean Claude Van Damme in the identical-twin action film Double Impact, as sidekick Frank Avery. No stranger to action, Lewis got to fire his umpteenth movie gun alongside Van Damme(s) and in real life, he was a firearms enthusiast. The decade continued to be busy for him with roles alongside Pierce Brosnan in The Lawnmower Man and Mel Gibson in The Man Without A Face.\n\nMaverick\n\nLewis worked with Gibson again in the 1994 western Maverick. It took him back to the genre he became known for and in 1998, he worked with Clint Eastwood again in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. The period also saw him take on more small screen roles in The X Files and Walker, Texas Ranger.\n\nThe Way of the Gun"
