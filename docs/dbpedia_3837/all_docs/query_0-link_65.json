        "text": "PLOT (spoiler alert!!!):\n\nDr. Lawrence Angelo works for Virtual Space Industries, running experiments in increasing the intelligence of chimpanzees using drugs and virtual reality. One of the chimps escapes using the warfare tactics he was being trained for. Dr. Angelo is generally a pacifist, who would rather explore the intelligence-enhancing potential of his research without applying it for military purposes.\n\nJobe Smith, a local greenskeeper with an intellectual disability, lives in the garden shed owned by the local priest, Father Francis McKeen. McKeen’s brother, Terry, is a local landscape gardener and employs Jobe to help him with odd jobs. Father McKeen punishes the challenged Jobe with a belt whenever he fails to complete his chores.\n\nDr. Angelo realizes he needs a human subject to work with, and he spots Jobe mowing his lawn. Peter Parkette, Dr. Angelo’s young neighbor, is friends with Jobe. Dr. Angelo invites both of them over to play some virtual reality games. Learning more about Jobe, Angelo persuades him to participate in his experiments, letting him know it will make him smarter. Jobe agrees and begins the program. Dr. Angelo makes it a point to redesign all the intelligence-boosting treatments without the “aggression factors” used in the chimpanzee experiments.\n\nJobe soon becomes smarter, for example, learning Latin in only two hours. Meanwhile Jobe also begins a sexual relationship with a young rich widow, Marnie. However, Jobe begins to display telepathic abilities and have hallucinations. He continues training at the lab, until an accident makes Dr. Angelo shut the program down. The project director, Sebastian Timms, employed by a mysterious agency known as The Shop, keeps tabs on the progress of the experiment, and discreetly swaps Dr. Angelo’s new medications with the old Project 5 supply (reintroducing the “aggression factors” into the treatment).\n\nJobe develops telekinetic and pyrokinetic powers and takes Marnie to the lab to make love to her while in virtual reality. Something goes wrong in the simulation when Jobe’s virtual avatar becomes violent, attacking her mind directly; Marnie is driven insane, laughing endlessly at nothing.\n\nJobe’s powers continue to grow, but the treatments are also affecting his mental stability, and he decides to exact revenge on those who abused him when he was “dumb”: Father McKeen is engulfed in flames, a bully named Jake is put into a catatonic state by a mental “lawnmower man” continually mowing his brain, and a lawnmower invention of Jobe’s runs down Harold, Peter’s abusive father. Jobe uses his telepathic abilities to make the investigating police attribute it all to “bizarre accidents” in front of Dr. Angelo.\n\nJobe believes his final stage of evolution is to become “pure energy” in the VSI computer mainframe, and from there reach into all the systems of the world. He promises his “birth” will be signaled by every telephone on the planet ringing simultaneously. The Shop sends a team to capture Jobe, but they are ineffective against his abilities and he scatters their molecules. Jobe uses the lab equipment to enter the mainframe computer, abandoning his body to become a wholly virtual being, leaving his body behind like a husk.\n\nDr. Angelo remotely infects the VSI computer, encrypting all of the links to the outside world, trapping Jobe in the mainframe. As Jobe searches for an unencrypted network connection, Dr. Angelo primes bombs to destroy the building. Feeling responsible for what has happened to Jobe, Angelo then joins him in virtual reality to try to reason with him. Jobe overpowers and crucifies him, then continues to search for a network connection. Peter runs into the building; Jobe still cares for him and allows Dr. Angelo to go free in order to rescue Peter. Jobe forces a computer-connected lock to open, allowing Peter and Dr. Angelo to escape. Jobe escapes through a backdoor as the building is destroyed in multiple explosions.\n\nBack at home with Peter, Dr. Angelo and Peter’s mother Carla (who has become a romantic interest) are about to leave when their telephone rings, followed by the noise of a second, and then hundreds of telephone rings, all around the globe\n\nREVIEW:\n\nHave you ever watched a film that you just knew was cutting edge at the time of its release, but in this day and age, they seem prehistoric? The Lawnmower Man is one such film. Going back to when this was released, I recall trying to watch it through the scrambled images through pay-per-view on television. Needless to say, it didn’t really work, but I was intrigued enough to come back and revisit this film years later.\n\nWhat is this about?\n\nA scientist performs experiments involving intelligence enhancing drugs and virtual reality on a simple-minded gardener. He puts the gardener on an extensive schedule of learning, and quickly he becomes brilliant. But at this point the gardener has a few ideas of his own on how the research should continue, and the scientist begins losing control of his experiments.\n\nWhat did I like?\n\nEvolution. In the beginning of the film, Jobe, our antagonist, starts out as a simple , developmental challenged guy. After some experimental drugs from Pierce Brosnan’s character, he gets smarts and evolves into a self-proclaimed god. Watching his change over the course of the film is the interesting part, as he slowly changes from a nice guy to the villain, including killing people and taking over virtual reality!\n\nTrapped. I won’t spoil the ending, but the way Jobe is captured is brilliant. When dealing with a malevolent techno-villain, this is pretty much the only way to take care of them, is by doing what was done here. Add in the deception that took place in order for this to transpire and it is a great way to defeat the villain.\n\nPulling the strings. As you can imagine, whenever there is research funding involved, the military and/or some huge company is pulling the strings and dangling money like a piece of cheese to a lab rat. Normally, I don’t care for this trope, but the film doesn’t focus on them exclusively, until it is time. Even then, there isn’t much light shed on the company, other than they have the money. Fun little tidbit, the big boss who appears on video screens is familiar to fan of the show Breaking Bad as Hank.\n\nWhat didn’t I like?\n\nVirtual reality. In 2014, this version of virtual reality is extremely dated. I say this version, because there are other virtual reality programs out there still trying to become mainstream. That isn’t the reason I disliked it, though. The effects used inside the computer are very rudimentary compared to some of the other things being done at the time, such as the ballroom scene in Beauty & the Beast.\n\nPowers to the test. It seems to be that whenever Jobe was about to let his powers loose, there was some mysterious force that wanted him to hold back. Why? I don’t know. It is obvious that the guy has developed some strong powers, but I felt that we never got to see the full extent of all of them. It is like in the X-Men movies, we get the basic powers of the mutants, but do we ever get to see them at the full extent? Magneto we do and Jean Grey when she becomes Dark Phoenix, but that’s it. Everyone else is shackled, and that is what I was getting from Jobe here, unfortunately.\n\nBond, James Bond. Pierce Brosnan is a capable actor. The guy has been James Bond before, for goodness sakes! However, this material doesn’t let him do anything but look bored. A tragic hero, as it would appear, even his remorse didn’t strike me as authentic, but just part of the script, nothing more.\n\nThe Lawnmower Man is one of those sci-fi horror films that is relevant for the time it was made, but has become dated. However, the subject matter is still relevant. Can you imagine someone becoming an internet god, running any and everything about the web, just like the government is trying to do with this net neutrality laws they keep trying to force through, but that’s a topic for another day. Do I recommend this? Eh, it is ok. I think I just wasn’t in the mood for it tonight. Maybe upon a second viewing I would have a different opinion. So, I have to say this is one of those you watch at your own risk.\n\n3 1/2 out of 5 stars\n\nPLOT (spoiler alert!!!):\n\nJack Beauregard (Henry Fonda) is a tired, aging legendary gunslinger who just wants to retire in peace in Europe to get away from young gunmen constantly trying to test themselves against the master. The film opens with three gunmen attempting to ambush Beauregard in a barbershop. After Beauregard has dispatched them, the barber’s son asks his father if there is anyone in the world faster than Beauregard, to which the barber replies “Faster than him? Nobody!”\n\n‘Nobody’ (Terence Hill) idolizes Beauregard and wants him to increase his fame by facing off the 150-man-strong Wild Bunch singlehanded. The Wild Bunch are a gang of bandits who launder their loot of stolen gold via a fake goldmine. The owner of the goldmine sends them after Beauregard because Beauregard’s now-dead brother was in on the deal.\n\nNobody dogs Beauregard through the west, encountering many who wish him dead, and pesters him to let him stage his grand finale. Eventually, the grand shoot-out takes place by a railway line. Nobody arranges for Beauregard to shoot at the Wild Bunch’s mirrored-concho-decorated saddles which, he discovered earlier, contain sticks of dynamite, thus letting a few good shots eliminate many of the men. To escape, the two board a train that Nobody has stolen.\n\nFinally, Nobody fakes a very public showdown in New Orleans with Beauregard, “killing” him and allowing him to slip away quietly. A street sign, marking where the gunfight took place, says “Nobody Was Faster On The Draw”. Beauregard boards a boat for Europe and a quiet retirement, while the Wild Bunch turn their attentions from Beauregard to Nobody.\n\nREVIEW:\n\nNetflix, oh Netflix! Why is it you must interfere with my viewing schedule? I actually had planned to watch something else this morning, but I saw that come Monday morning, My Name is Nobody would no longer be streaming. So, this made me adjust my plan. That being said, I wonder if this may actually be better than what I had planned, because I was enjoying this film.\n\nWhat is this about?\n\nSpaghetti Western regular Terence Hill stars as Nobody, a man who’s been chosen to take out established bandit Jack Beauregard but who strikes up a friendship with the seasoned outlaw instead.\n\nWhat did I like?\n\nOld meet new. As I get older, I find myself more and more saying, “back in my day”, “when I was young”, etc., when comparing and contrasting things that were around in my day compared to things this generation has. I guess this is just the start of me being an old man with a cane fussing at “those young whipper snappers.” HA! Seriously, though, the two main characters in this film are intriguing because they represent the two styles of westerns at the time. On the one hand, there was Henry Fonda (this was his last western, btw), who was gruff, serious, and pretty much a definitive white hat wearing good guy. On the other hand, there is Terence Hill, fun-loving, free spirit, annoying, morally ambiguous from what we can ascertain, but not really a bad guy. Now, at this point in time, westerns were shifting from the more serious, action-packed masterpieces that they were to the more comedy driven, light-hearted fair. The characterization of these two guys is a reflection of that shift.\n\n1 vs 150. Henry Fonda, as I just mentioned, plays and aging gunman who is apparently the fastest in the west. Terence Hill’s character grew up idolizing him and seems to be hell-bent on making sure he goes down in history books as a hero. What better way to do this than to have him singlehandedly face the 150 men in the Wild Bunch. For those western officiandos out there, yes, these are the same desperadoes from the movie The Wild Bunch. What is so special about this shootout? Part of it is the camera shots. Obviously, it would be the stuff of legend and near impossibility for 1 man to defeat 150 guys on horses charging at you with guns. There are only so many bullets and tommy guns haven’t been invented, yet. However, there is a fatal flaw the group has, which I won’t spoil, but it allows him to taken them down. As group of the group fall, we enter some kind of slow-mo that makes it seem much more epic. Back then it was used sparingly and not in every single action scene, like today.\n\nFunny spaghetti. This is supposed to be a spaghetti western, and it is, but the humorous parts are more prevalent, which is fine with me. It should be noted that this film has two directors. The gritty, serious parts were directed by spaghetti western master, Sergio Leone, while the rest of the film was under the helm of some other guy. The contrast of the two styles would normally leave a big mess, like mixing spaghetti and chocolate syrup. However, somehow they make it work, and the result is the fine film that I just finished.\n\nWhat didn’t I like?\n\nFollow you down. I was keeping up with the film’s plot and story until a little past the halfway mark when things shift from a pool hall to a fun house, then randomly we are shown a couple of thugs and Hill’s character in a funhouse, etc. This random jumping around continued until Fonda walks out to where we encounter the penultimate, aforementioned shootout. I have no real issue with skipping around, if it serves the film justice, as opposed to just being random, and that is what this was…randomness.\n\nComparisons. For many critics, they are quick to compare this to other works by Sergio Leone, most notably The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, but for what reason? The unnamed gunman? Technically he has a name…Nobody. The same director? Take a look at any director’s resume, no matter how many masterpieces they have, there is sure to be those 1 or 2 stinkers they would much rather forget, so you can’t compare their works like that. Each film is different. (No, I am not saying The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is a stinker). Let this flick stand on its own two feet, people, please!\n\nMusic. Ennio Morricone brought a wonderful score to this picture. Perhaps not his best, but still quality work, in my opinion. However, and I realize this was probably to capture the comedic tone the film was striving for, using Wagner’s “Ride of the Valkyrie” with a twangy sound underneath just didn’t work. The piece itself is intimidating ,but in this format/version it came off as more of a joke that you would see in a Bugs Bunny gag.\n\nMy final thoughts on My Name is Nobody are that is truly and enjoyable film that capitalizes on the changing tone of westerns at the time by acting as a “changing of the guard”, if you will. The comedy, action, twists, turns, and all around fun make this a worthwhile watch. While this is not a film for everyone, I’m sure most will enjoy it, even if you are a hater of classics and westerns and refuse to give them a chance. For everyone else that at least has half an open mind, give this a shot sometime. Perhaps you’ll be pleasantly surprised!\n\n4 1/2 out of 5 stars"
