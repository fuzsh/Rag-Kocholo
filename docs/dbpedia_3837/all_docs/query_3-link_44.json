        "text": "Today, word came through my Twitter feed that Geoffrey Lewis passed away. He was one of those character actors who appeared in movies and a ton of television shows. I have seen him many times but never knew his name. I also did not know that he was the father of Juliette Lewis.\n\nWith his passing, I thought it would be appropriate to search for wisdom in his movies. For those who have not read one of the Movie Wisdom posts, there are a few rules. First, it must be a movie in which Geoffrey Lewis appeared. Second, it must be a movie that I have seen. Third, the wisdom can be spoken by any character in the film.\n\nWith that being said, I must admit that my favorite role of his was not in a movie. It was in a Magnum, P.I. episode called I Never Wanted to Go to France, Anyway.\n\nNow, he is some of the wisdom of Geoffrey Lewis.\n\nFrom High Plains Drifter\n\nIt’s what people know about themselves inside that makes ’em afraid.\n\nFrom My Name Is Nobody\n\nFolks that throw dirt on you aren’t always trying to hurt you, and folks that pull you out of a jam aren’t always trying to help you. But the main point is when you’re up to your nose in shit, keep your mouth shut.\n\nIf a man is a man, he needs someone to believe in.\n\nThe secret of a long life is you try not to shorten it.\n\nDying is not the worst thing that can happen to a man.\n\nTwo things go straight to a man’s heart, bullets and gold.\n\nThere was never any “good old days”.\n\nFrom The Great Waldo Pepper\n\nThe biplane’s gone the way of the Dodo.\n\nFrom Every Which Way But Loose\n\nI’m not afraid of any man, but when it comes to sharing my feelings with a woman, my stomach turns to royal gelatin.\n\nFrom Tom Horn\n\nIf you really knew how dirty and raggedy-assed the Old West was, you wouldn’t want any part of it.\n\nFrom Bronco Billy\n\nI think every kid in America ought to go to school… at least up to the eighth grade.\n\nFrom Any Which Way You Can\n\nA hand out is what you get from the government, a hand up is what you get from a friend.\n\nFrom Fletch Lives\n\nIt takes a big man to admit when he’s wrong.\n\nFrom Tango and Cash\n\nToo much television can hurt your eyes.\n\nCrazy people aren’t afraid of anybody.\n\nFrom The Man Without a Face\n\nPeople spend too much time thinking of the past. Whatever else it is, it’s gone.\n\nFrom Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\n\nIf you’re thirsty, a drink will cure it, if you’re not, a drink will prevent it. Prevention is better than a cure.\n\nTo understand the living, you got to commune with the dead.\n\nIt’s better to be on the edge of a party."
