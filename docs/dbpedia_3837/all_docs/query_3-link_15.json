        "text": "Geoffrey Lewis, an actor who appeared alongside Clint Eastwood in a string of films in the 1970s and ’80s, died on April 7 near his home in Los Angeles. He was 79.\n\nHe died after a heart attack, said Carleen Donovan, a publicist for his daughter Juliette Lewis, the actress.\n\nMr. Lewis was an Eastwood regular, starting as a tough guy in “High Plains Drifter” (1973). He went on to appear in “Thunderbolt and Lightfoot” (1974), “Every Which Way but Loose” (1978), “Bronco Billy” (1980), “Any Which Way You Can” (1980) and “Pink Cadillac” (1989), often playing a sidekick or a lighter comedic role. He and Mr. Eastwood last worked together on “Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil” in 1997.\n\nMr. Lewis also had hundreds of other film and television roles. He appeared on television series including “Falcon Crest,” “Magnum P.I.” and “My Name Is Earl,” and in action movies, among them “10 to Midnight”; gangster films like “Dillinger”; horror pictures including Rob Zombie’s “The Devil’s Rejects”; and westerns like “My Name Is Nobody” and “They Died With Their Boots On.”\n\nGeoffrey Bond Lewis was born in Plainfield, N.J., on July 31, 1935. He moved to Wrightwood, Calif., when he was 10 and graduated from Victorville High School. He studied theater arts at San Bernardino Valley College for two years, then worked as a truck driver and at other odd jobs before becoming a successful actor.\n\nBesides his daughter Juliette, known for her work in films like “Cape Fear” and “Natural Born Killers,” his survivors include his wife, Paula Hochhalter; his daughters Brandy, Hannah and Dierdre Lewis and Emily Colombier; his sons Peter, Lightfield, Miles and Matthew; and nine grandchildren."
