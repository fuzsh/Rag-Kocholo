        "text": "Actor Geoffrey Lewis, who appeared in many Clint Eastwood films and made several appearances in TV shows throughout the '60s and '70s, has died of natural causes, a family friend told Variety. He was 79.\n\nJuliette Lewis' father had roles in Eastwood's High Plains Drifter and Thunderbolt and Lightfoot. Other film credits include The Devil's Rejects, Heaven's Gate and Smile. He received a Golden Globe nomination for his work on the 1980 TV series, Flo, and appeared in other series such as Little House on the Prairie, Hawaii Five-O and Murder, She Wrote.\n\nThe Other Sister actress uploaded a photo of herself with her father on Instagram and included a touching caption that read, \"My dad. My dad my dad my dad my dad. My love my dad. My dad. My hero. My dad. My dad my love my loving father. My strength my might. My friend. My hugs. My laughter. My love. My dad. Oh my heart. My heart. He loved us so. He loved us so. So so much. I am forever my father's daughter and he will never been gone.\"\n\nWhen Juliette began to find success in acting at the young age of 14, she officially emancipated herself from her parents, but it wasn't a result of a strained relationship. She told The Daily Telegraph that she just wanted to be able to draw from some of her earnings.\n\n\"The truth is that it's something very common that you did when you were acting very young and my parents actually helped me to do that,\" she told the publication in 2010. \"My parents are just the best. My dad instilled in me to naturally question all authority. I don't follow anything blindly. That's religion, cops, doctors, schools, you name it.\"\n\nThe Western-starring actor was born in San Diego, Calif., but grew up in Rhode Island before moving back to California when he was 10-years-old. It was there that he began acting in school productions.\n\nHe is survived by wife Paula Hochhalter, daughter Juliette and nine other children, three of whom are also actors."
