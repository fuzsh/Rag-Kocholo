        "text": "Area characterisation:\n\nWith a population of almost 12 million and covering an area of 1512 km2, São Paulo is the largest city of Brazil and capital of the homonymous State. It has an urbanisation rate of above 99%, following an urbanisation model based on the occupation of environmentally fragile areas and encroachment of natural habitats. As a result, the city faces important socio-environmental challenges linked to urban drainage (e.g. landslides, flooding), contamination of air and water sources, sanitation systems, and climate change. These challenges disproportionately affect the poorest segments of the population and contribute to the deterioration of local ecosystems and ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, hydraulic and temperature regulation, and biodiversity protection.\n\nVegetation cover is present in about 48% of São Paulo City, with the rural area occupying 31.78% of the municipal territory and sheltering 79.37% of this cover, and the urban area occupying 68.22% of the territory and sheltering 33.65% of the total vegetation cover (São Paulo, 2020). While the vegetation cover per inhabitant is on average 62,88 m², the distribution of green is highly unequal, with the lowest figure of 5,22 m²/inhabitant in the Sapopemba Regional Administration, and the largest figure of 2,000 m²/inhabitant in the Parelheiros Regional Administration, mostly inserted in the rural area (São Paulo, 2020).\n\nThe City manages nine Conservation Units which span 30% of the municipal territory and protect important remnants of the Atlantic Forest biome, including indigenous lands such as Tenondé Porã, in the Parelheiros Regional Administration, and Jaraguá, in the Pirituba-Jaraguá Regional Administration. In addition, São Paulo City and State government manage 131 public parks which provide valuable environmental services to millions of people (São Paulo, 2022).\n\nIn the context of the H2020 CONEXUS project, the São Paulo Life-Lab establishes pilots in three parks, respectively to protect, expand, and create urban green infrastructure (GI) through nature-based solutions (NbS) interventions. The first pilot (I) is located in the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga – PEFI, a large Atlantic Rainforest remnant with more than 520 ha of well-preserved forest in the southeast of the city. The second (II) unfolds in the Ibirapuera Park, a historic public park of more than 150 ha close to the city centre and encompassing a heterogeneous landscape with scattered forest patches and large green open spaces. The third (II) is situated in the Consciência Negra/Mata Sete Cruzes, a recently established park in the extreme eastern border of the City, which includes 20 ha of degraded land to be restored.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe main objective of the São Paulo Life-Lab is to fast-forward the urban green transition by harnessing the ecosystem services of urban forests, and while doing so, tackling socio-environmental inequalities through NbS co-creation.\n\nThe Life-Lab thus aligns with the wider vision of São Paulo City to promote urban forests as global solutions to climate change and other sustainable development challenges, including with strategic policy agendas like the 'Municipal Plan for Protected Areas, Green Areas and Open Spaces', the 'Municipal Plan for the Conservation and Recovery of the Atlantic Forest', the 'Programme for Payments of Environmental Services', the 'Municipal Plan for Urban Afforestation' and the 'Municipal Climate Action Plan', put forward as instruments for carrying out the '2030 Municipal Agenda of the City of São Paulo', launched in June 2021 (WRI, n.d.).\n\nActions:\n\nIn their different contexts, the three CONEXUS pilots leverage biodiversity to optimise the ecosystem services of urban forests at the micro and meso-scales.\n\nPilot 1, in the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga – PEFI, consists of the protection of a large Atlantic Rainforest patch. Carbon sequestration and thermal comfort are being monitored at different scales to understand the contribution of a remnant of the Atlantic Rainforest to the quality of life in the city. An Eddy Covariance tower, a high-tech instrument set at 18m above the ground, is measuring the exchanges of CO2, water, and energy between the park and the atmosphere. Additionally, the same fluxes are being measured in four native tree species to understand their contributions in terms of ecosystem services.\n\nPilot 2 supports the expansion of Ibirapuera Park. The same monitoring system has been set in this public park boosting a distinct vegetation cover. The fluxes of CO2, water, and energy are being measured for the entire park, as well as the contribution of four native tree species in the delivery of these ecosystem services. The role of the park's trees on filtering air pollution is also monitored.\n\nPilot 3 involves the collaborative restoration of a portion of the planned Mata Sete Cruzes/Cabeceiras do Aricanduva Park, the afforestation of Consciência Negra Park, and the establishment of a green corridor connecting them to Ciência Park. A new green infrastructure will be created by the local communities together with a multidisciplinary technical team of urban planners, architects, biologists, agronomist, and other practitioners. The project is a collaboration between the Municipal Secretariat of Green and Environment (SVMA), Cidade Tiradentes’ Regional Administration, and São Paulo Housing Company (COHAB). Currently, the SVMA is creating a working group to explore methodologies and guidelines to guide the development of the green corridor.\n\nLinked to the monitoring study, a programme of environmental education will be launched by the Life-Lab to capacitate local communities in the development and maintenance of urban forests as strategic elements of urban liveability and sustainability. In fact, urban forests are seen as solutions that go beyond addressing local environmental issues, but tackle global challenges such as pollution and climate change.\n\nSee also: urban forests and promotion of native ecosystems case study.\n\nPotential impacts/benefits:\n\nProtection, restoration, and enhancement of biodiversity, including through the creation of biodiversity corridors connecting green urban areas;\n\nHarnessing of forest ecosystem services including benefits for climate change resilience (i.e. carbon sequestration, temperature regulation, reduction of air pollution);\n\nCreation of a system for managing green public areas by the Cidade Tiradentes’ Regional Administration;\n\nPlace regeneration through improved quality and public value of green infrastructure (e.g. for recreation);\n\nStrengthening ‘sense of place’ and local identity by improving the perception of local environments and landscapes;\n\nMore open, transparent, participatory, and inclusive processes for green infrastructure planning and governance;\n\nAmplifying community engagement in and management of co-created NbS;\n\nExpanded knowledge-base for upscaling the integration of ecosystem services into sustainable urbanisation actions;\n\nTrialling and development of a methodology to implement green corridors in other areas of São Paulo City.\n\nLessons learned:\n\nFinancing:\n\nHorizon 2020 programme\n\nSão Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP 2019/08783-0)\n\nMunicipal funding, São Paulo City Government\n\nNbS classification\n\nurban forest restoration\n\nurban green system\n\nFurther information\n\nReferences\n\nCONEXUS Deliverable 3.1 Report with action plans for each Life-Lab (internal).\n\nCONEXUS Deliverable 2.2 Seven detailed EU and CELAC cases on NbS challenges and opportunities addressed: ‘Integration of NbS in local governance contexts and urbanisation trajectories in CONEXUS EU and CELAC cities.
