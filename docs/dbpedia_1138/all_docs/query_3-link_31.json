        "text": "To watch a show by the singer-dancer Daniela Mercury, one of Brazil’s biggest stars for nearly 30 years, is to plunge into a pulsing, hyperenergized fantasia of her hometown, Salvador da Bahia, arguably the most African city outside Africa. The stage teems with dancers in billowing Afro-Brazilian garb; a battery of drummers pounds out the rhythms of axé, the densely percussive pop native to Salvador that Mercury made famous.\n\nShe weaves through the ensemble, a radiant presence in constant motion — joining in group choreography, breaking into leaps and twirls. All the while she sings, with raspy sweetness and syncopated precision. While her productions enlist some of the most gifted choreographers, directors and musicians in Salvador, the concepts, many of the songs and the significant choices are hers.\n\nSo is the attitude. Nearly all the lyrics have messages — of nondiscrimination, of tolerance, of women’s rights, of maintaining inner fortitude. Those sentiments resound more deeply than ever as Brazil moves through one of the most politically divided and volatile eras in its history. This month, Mercury, 54, is carrying her messages to the world, as she often does. She is in the midst of her latest American tour, which will bring her to Manhattan’s Sony Hall on Tuesday.\n\nBut the colder realities of home are always waiting. Speaking in Portuguese by phone from Atlanta, she said, “Brazilian society is fighting for democracy, fighting against authoritarianism, fighting for education. We have to fight to defend nature, the indigenous, minorities. Human rights. It’s very important.”\n\nTo that end, Mercury is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and an Equality Champion for the United Nations; she has also been known to cross swords with the political and religious right over their policies. In 2018 she helped spearhead a social media campaign, #EleNao (#NotHim), before the election of Brazil’s extreme right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro. Many of his followers boycotted her with their own hashtag, #ElaNao (#NotHer).\n\nFive years earlier, Mercury, who has an ex-husband and two children, came out as a lesbian when she wed Malu Verçosa, a journalist. The couple adopted three children. “I want to help make the love between these two women be seen by everyone as normal,” the singer told the Brazilian magazine Veja, but she chose some daring ways. The cover of her 2016 album, “Vinil Virtual,” is an image her detractors have used against her ever since. Modeled on a famous Rolling Stone cover with John Lennon and Yoko Ono, it shows a nude Mercury wrapped around Verçosa. This year, for the 50th anniversary of Stonewall, the couple spoke out for gay rights at the National Congress in Brasília, the country’s capital. They ended with a kiss.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
