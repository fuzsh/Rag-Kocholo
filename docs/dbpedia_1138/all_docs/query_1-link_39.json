        "text": "We blinked and September arrived. We already put the jacket back on (depressed) and the ‚Ç¨9 ticket is already gone (depressed 2).\n\nBut we can't thank you enough for this beautiful summer we had: so thank you again for opening our newsletters, for having fun with us, for not missing any show, for supporting Brazilian culture in Germanic lands.\n\nIt is a pleasure to have you with us. Now and always! Let's face autumn in Berlin, which is also full of good things? Have you already studied German today? Are you up to date with your therapy? Did you move your body today?\n\nSo much on your head and you don‚Äôt know ho to start?\n\nSTART WITH CARTOLA!\n\nüòç PARTY | Roda de Feijoada Open Air\n\nTRIBUTE TO CARTOLA\n\nSUNDAY\n\nSePtembER 4\n\n@Festsaal Kreuzberg\n\nOur traditional roda de samba with feijoada is going to be Open Air again and this month the big honoree is Cartola!\n\nIt will be amazing and you can already plan to buy tickets in advance. At the door it's another price.\n\nFood market with delicious food: pastel, feijoada (with meat and vegan) and even picanha.\n\nIs your birthday in September? How about celebrating your birthday there at the feijoada? You don't pay admission and even get a sparkling wine to toast with your friends!\n\nFor the kids: now besides the painting workshop with artist Andreia Salame and a corner with activities for the little ones, we also have a jumper!\n\nListen to the PLAYLIST we created to practice the music of master Cartola.\n\nüòé PARTY | BAILE FUNK DA BOSSA\n\nSATURDAY\n\nSePtembER 24\n\n@Festsaal Kreuzberg\n\nBaile Funk is back in the area to heat up our lives, our souls, our energy. Who misses being able to shake and roll until dawn? Who's in need of a dance like this to give their life a boost?\n\nA line-up like this makes us really happy:\n\nMusic:\n\n√ÇMY B (Lyon/France)\n\nMc J do Rio\n\nDa Matta\n\nPerformances:\n\nFrancielly Monteiro\n\nMaque Pereyra\n\nKysy Fischer\n\nRemember that our AWARENESS TEAM will be there fighting the ‚Äúman-trash‚Äù! Any non-conceptual attitude will not be tolerated!\n\nüéπ Show | Marcos Valle\n\nTUESDAY\n\nOCTOBER 18\n\n@Gretchen\n\n‚ÄùTem que correr, tem que suar, tem que malhar (Vamos l√°)‚Äù\n\nIt sounds like a dream, but it is real: Marcos Valle's concert in Berlin, folks! He is certainly one of the main composers of MPB (Brazilian Popular Music).\n\nAuthor of more than three hundred songs, his songs have been recorded by great names of Brazilian and world music such as: Elis Regina, Tim Maia, Roberto Carlos, Sarah Vaughan, Dizzy Gillespie, with participation by Paulo S√©rgio Valle, Ruy Guerra, Eumir Deodato, Jo√£o Donato, and more recently recording with Laz√£o and Dagama, members of the group Cidade Negra.\n\nMarcos has had great success on European dance floors since the 90's, both with his original recordings and with re-recordings and remixes of his songs by other artists and DJ's, not only here, but also in Japan and China.\n\nNot to miss!"
