        "text": "Brazil is located in eastern South America, bordering the Atlantic Ocean. Shares borders with: Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela.\n\nNortheastern Brazilian Music\n\nIn the 20th century, mass migrations from the northeast introduced forró to Brazilian cities in the south. One of the most famous of these migrants was accordionist Luiz Gonzaga who was born in 1912 in the Northeastern state of Pernambuco. His father, Januario, played button accordion or oito baixos: and was also an accordion builder and repairman. Luiz learned to play the oito baixos and then the piano accordion.\n\nLuiz left the Northeast and ended up in Rio de Janeiro where he pursued a career as a musician, and ended up performing regularly on the radio playing waltzes, fox trots, sambas, and tangos. He felt the need to express his own culture, and roots, and to sing about the experiences of the displaced Northeastern immigrants working in the southern cities. He became a tremendous national success, striking a chord in the hearts of Brazilians, and popularizing forró throughout Brazil.
