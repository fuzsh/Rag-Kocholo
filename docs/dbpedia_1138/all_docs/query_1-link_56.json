        "text": "Sons da Terra was recorded last year during the Brasil 500 edition of the Berlin summer music festival HeimatKlänge and was produced as a benefit for Brazilian street kids (for more info, see Strassenkinder-archiv.de). The album is a major delight, showcasing a number of Brazilian artists who had previously enjoyed only limited (if any) exposure in Europe and the U.S. The most immediate revelations here begin with “Forro Esferográfico” by Cabruêra, a group from Northeast Brazil. Cabruêra’s sound—mangue-forró—forges samba, forró, jazz, and funk into a sizzling groove that’s one of the hottest vibes in Brazil today. Also ear-catching are the ruling drums of Ilê Aiyê (a crew from Salvador de Bahia), the distinctive Brazilian reggae of Cidade Negra, and pop star Elba Ramalho’s disarming vocal on “É d’Oxum.” Distributed in the U.S. by Harmonia Mundi.—PVV"
