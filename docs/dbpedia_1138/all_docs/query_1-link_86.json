        "text": "Foreigners may flock to Rio de Janeiro, but savvy Brazilians like to argue that the best place in their country to spend the Southern Hemisphere summer is Salvador da Bahia. Brazil's third largest city slides easily into a hedonistic groove as the weather grows hotter, with irresistible rhythms pulsing from every street corner and parties and dancing propelling revelers toward an exuberant Carnival that just may be the best in Brazil.\n\nThat remains the case even in these somber times. The novels of Jorge Amado, the music of Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil and movies such as ''Woman on Top'' have helped spread Salvador's reputation as the capital of relaxed sensuality beyond Brazil, and residents regard it almost as a mission to help visitors disconnect from the sorrows and pressures of the outside world. (It's wise, however, to be on the lookout for pickpockets when in any large crowd, especially during Carnival.)\n\nSettled by the Portuguese beginning 500 years ago last month, Salvador was Brazil's first capital, and even today there is something regal about the city. The exquisite colonial architecture, the sweeping curve of the Bay of All Saints that the city overlooks and even the stateliness of the dancers in the street -- all convey a certain air of aristocracy without being haughty.\n\nSalvador is also known as the Black Rome, a designation that reflects its status as the focal point of Afro-Brazilian culture. Candomblé, a religion that mixes Catholicism with African deities, is the city's principal faith, and drumming troupes such as Olodum, which has worked with Paul Simon and Michael Jackson, have emerged in recent years to preach a gospel of pan-African unity.\n\nCarnival comes rather early this summer, starting officially on Feb. 9 and ending at noon on Ash Wednesday, Feb. 13, so there is little time to lose. Araketu, Ilê Ayê, Filhos de Gandhi and all the other carnival clubs and music groups that are the heart and soul of Salvador's splendid Carnival are already rehearsing for the celebrations -- except when they are not relaxing on the beach or cooling off with a caipirinha, the mixture of sugar cane liquor and tropical fruit juices that is the favorite local drink.\n\nEvents\n\nSalvador's summer calendar centers around a series of religious festivals celebrated for centuries that have been transformed in recent years into Brazilian equivalents of the Rose Bowl Parade or the Orange Bowl Festival. The year begins, for instance, with the impressive maritime procession of Nosso Senhor dos Navegantes on Jan. 1, during which boats carry an image of Jesus to the church of Nossa Senhora da Boa Viagem, on Boa Viagem Square.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
