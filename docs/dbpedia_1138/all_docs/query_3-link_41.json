        "text": "JAN 19-28, 2024\n\nNOIR CITY 21\n\nIn a move taken in opposition to the nation's current wave of anti-immigrant sentiment, the venerable NOIR CITY film festival, celebrating its 21st year in the Bay Area, has declared \"Darkness Has No Borders.\" The 10-day festival will feature a dozen thematically linked double bills, pairing foreign language films with movies made in the United States and United Kingdom. The festival runs January 19â28 at Oakland's Grand Lake Theatre.\n\nNOIR CITY honcho and FNF president Eddie Muller, familiar to a national audience as the host of Noir Alley on Turner Classic Movies (TCM), credits preservation efforts by film archives worldwide, and the advent of digital distribution, as the reason \"we're now able to recognize the global scope of film noir.\" At this year's NOIR CITY, he notes, audiences will experience familiar noir tales â¦ but half will be from Argentina, Egypt, France, South Korea, Italy, Mexico, and Japan presented alongside English-language offerings. \"Some are cultural one-offs,\" he explains, \"like the 1958 Egyptian offering Cairo Station (shown with the 1950 Paramount thriller Union Station), while others are examples of noir from countries with a dark wellspring of films still waiting to be discovered.\" The 24-film program of thematically linked double bills includes heists, prison breaks, missing persons, cultural alienation, love triangles, and lots of plain old-fashioned murder.\n\n“This year's NOIR CITY program is tailored to satisfy folks who love noir that's full of the colorful vernacular slang so essential to American and British noirâas well as adventurous viewers intrigued by a familiar story–a crime committed for passion or profitâplaying out in cultures with different values, mores, and styles.”\n\nâEddie Muller\n\nKicking off the collection of rarities is the FNF's most recent restoration — 1952's Argentine film Never Open That Door (No abras nunca esa puerta) — based on two short stories by American master of suspense fiction, Cornell Woolrich. The picture was preserved by the Film Noir Foundation in 2013 and has now been completely restored by the FNF through UCLA Film & Television Archive, thanks in part to a grant from the Golden Globe Foundation (formerly HFPA). Fernando MartÃ­n PeÃ±a, Argentina's pre-eminent cinephile, will be on hand to introduce the film with Eddie Muller.\n\nIncluded on the 2024 schedule are English-language rarities such as Black Tuesday (1954), Plunder Road (1957), Across the Bridge (1957), and Strongroom (1962). Little-seen international titles include The Human Beast (France, 1938), Aimless Bullet (South Korea, 1960), Bitter Rice (Italy, 1949), Four Against the World (Mexico, 1950), Zero Focus (Japan, 1961), and Smog (1962), a forgotten surrealist masterpiece by Italian director Franco Rossi freshly restored by UCLA Film & Television Archive.\n\nTICKET INFO\n\nPurchase advance tickets through Eventbrite with any of the ticket links in the program guide above. Doors open at 6:00 pm for evening shows; noon for matinées.\n\n☇ DIRECTIONS TO THE GRAND LAKE THEATRE\n\nNOIR CITY 21 PASSPORT\n\nSecure your spot for the 10-day/24-film festival with an all-access pass for $200âa $40 savings over the regular ticket price! The Grand Lake Theatre will have a Passholders' queue for early admittance. → MORE INFO HERE\n\nAll you need to know about the NOIR CITY Film Festival ↓\n\nSurround yourself in a miasma of social media darkness: join us on Facebook, Tumblr and Twitter for a complete immersion in the world of film noir through film stills, posters, film clips, brilliant insights, and more. Maybe you'll meet a dangerous stranger along the way.\n\nLATEST FNF RESTORATION!\n\nNo abras nunca esa puerta / Never Open That DoorÂ (1952, Argentina) is a significant example of the cross-cultural cinematic legacy shared by the United States and Argentina during the post-WWII era.Â Based on a story by legendary American thriller writer Cornell Woolrich (Rear Window, Phantom Lady, The Bride Wore Black)Â the film is brilliantly directed by Argentinean Carlos Hugo Christensen.Â The extraordinary cinematography by Pablo Tabernero equals any classic film noir movie ever made â yet this film remains virtually unknown.\n\nThe Film Noir Foundation discoveredÂ No abras nunca esa puerta, along withÂ Si muero antes de despertarÂ (If I Should Die Before I Wake), in Buenos Aires years ago, but at the time we could only afford to strike \"preservation prints,\" i.e. copying but not restoring them. It created a sensation when screened at New York's Museum of Modern Art as part of \"Death Is My Dance Partner: Film Noir in Postwar Argentina,\" a critically praised 2016 event that showcased this neglected part of cinema history. Two of the FNF restorations in that series,Â Los tallos amargosÂ (1956) andÂ El vampiro negroÂ (1953), have gone on to international recognition as rescued classics, with screenings at film festivals around the world, broadcasts on Turner Classic Movies, and released in Blu-ray special editions by Flicker Alley. We expect the same forÂ No abras nunca esa puerta.\n\nThe popularity of classic film noir is at an all-time high, and the Film Noir Foundation is dedicated to fostering an appreciation of the genre as an international cinematic movement, not merely an American phenomenon. It is a revelation to experience the work of an \"all-American\" author, in Spanish, and rendered as well (perhaps better) than any Hollywood adaptation of his work. The restoration will premiere opening night of NOIR CITY 21."
