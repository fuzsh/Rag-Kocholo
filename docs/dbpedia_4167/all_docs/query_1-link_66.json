        "text": "Tag: Thriller\n\nLove Lies Bleeding – review\n\nHow to describe Love Lies Bleeding, the blackly funny and hilariously gory new thriller from Ross Glass? One the one hand, with its tale of two women against the odds in the desert it plays like a sort of neo-noir Thelma and Louise. On the other hand, with its mounting misunderstandings and poor decisions leading to outbreaks of bloody violence, there’s more than a touch of the darker Coen Brothers films too, particularly their 1984 debut Blood Simple. None of which is to say that Love Lies Bleeding is derivative – far from it. This is quite a singular piece of film-making.\n\nContinue reading “Love Lies Bleeding – review” →\n\nPrey – review\n\nDan Trachtenberg’s only previous film, 10 Cloverfield Lane, was an unexpectedly smart new take on an existing horror franchise, and in his tense and clever second feature Prey he proves that lightning can strike twice: it’s a thrilling reinvention of a Predator series that has looked increasingly stale after a string of poor sequels.\n\nContinue reading “Prey – review” →\n\nThe Northman – review\n\nRobert Eggers made his name with the excellent low-budget chillers The Witch and The Lighthouse, both ultra-atmospheric features which made great use of surreal visuals and mythological allusions. Now for the first time he has been handed a significant budget (reportedly in excess of $70 million) to make his most ambitious effort yet – the Viking revenge epic The Northman. But for all that The Northman contains some of Eggers’ hallmark strengths, it’s also a more straightforward work than his previous films.\n\nContinue reading “The Northman – review” →\n\nThe Batman – review\n\nNothing in this world is certain other than death, taxes and a new dark’n’gritty reboot of Batman emerging every few years. This time out it’s Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes) at the helm and Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/ the Caped Crusader himself, and their version of Batman is darker’n’grittier than ever. But for all its impressively squalid atmosphere The Batman is a failure – punishingly overlong, glacially slow, and jarringly self-serious.\n\nContinue reading “The Batman – review” →\n\nDark Waters – review\n\nThere’s something very classical, even old-fashioned, about Todd Haynes’ Dark Waters, a true-life tale of corporate greed and negligence. It’s unflashy, almost workmanlike in style, but consistently gripping nonetheless. I was reminded of Tom McCarthy’s Spotlight, another recent ode to the power of dogged investigation. Continue reading “Dark Waters – review” →\n\nParasite – review\n\nReviewing a film like Bong Joon-Ho’s Korean-language Parasite is particularly difficult, both because of the way it’s genre-fluid action defies easy description, and because, more than most, it is a movie best enjoyed by an audience going in knowing as little as possible. This is a film that constantly surprises, unfolding scene by scene like some kind of intricate puzzle box. Continue reading “Parasite – review” →\n\nMy Friend Dahmer – review @ Small Screen\n\nMy review of My Friend Dahmer can be found at Small Screen.\n\nThe Strangers: Prey at Night – review @ Small Screen\n\nMy review of The Strangers: Prey at Night can be found at Small Screen.\n\nA Quiet Place – review\n\nA Quiet Place, the ingenious and effective new chiller from John Krasinski (best known for his role as Jim in the American version of The Office), lets you know from the start that it is not playing around. A title card announces that we are day 89 into some unknown crisis. A group of ragged survivors scavenge a deserted supermarket in complete silence, moving cautiously, voices not even rising to a whisper. Stress is etched into their faces, but what has them so alarmed? An ill-timed outburst of noise and, with a sudden, shocking eruption of ferocious violence, we have our answer: it’s fair to say that A Quiet Place shows its teeth early.
