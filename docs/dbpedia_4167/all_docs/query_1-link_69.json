        "text": "Since 2017, it's become a tradition of mine that, for the month of March, I research and post on social media about women in film history. Looking back at the years that I've been doing this, I can't help but see it as a celebration. So far, I have learned about and shared the stories of over 100 women in the film history. Some I knew about, some I had never heard of before, but all of their stories are equally valid and inspiring.\n\nAmong this year's group, there were Oscar winners, specific industry \"firsts,\" and women who wore multiple hats to get the proverbial job done. I'm thankful for the female filmmakers who have come before me and to the women who are working hard to make a difference in the industry now, and am already looking forward to next years Women's History Month celebrations!\n\nIf you'd like to read more about the women I featured on social media throughout March, I've included a bio and their IMDB links down below.\n\nBess Meredyth (1890-1969) started her career in entertainment at a local theatre as an organist and vaudeville comedienne as a teen. She moved to Hollywood in 1911, after working as an extra for D.W. Griffith’s Biograph Studios, and quickly began writing scenarios on a freelance basis to supplement her income.\n\nAfter starting a family, from 1921-1928, Meredyth resumed her career in Hollywood, accumulating more than 125 writing credits, working in succession for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Warner Brothers, Goldwyn Productions, First National Pictures, and Columbia Pictures. Most famously during this time, MGM sent her to Italy in 1924 to help rescue the failing production of Ben-Hur (1925).One of its founding members, in 1930, Meredyth became the first woman nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for A Woman of Affairs (1928) and Wonders of Women (1929).\n\nSarah Yeiser Mason (1896-1980) began working in films in 1917 when she was allegedly \"discovered\" by actor Douglas Fairbanks while on location shooting the film Headin’ South. As the story goes, she started working for Fairbanks’ acting company the next day.\n\nEventually, Yeiser Mason started working as a \"continuity girl,\" a position that preceded today’s script supervisor. Her first film credit was for Allan Dwan’s Arizona (1918); this credit makes her one of the industry’s first continuity writers, if not the first.\n\nYeiser Mason wrote original scenarios and screenplays for studios MGM, Paramount and Columbia, and created and adapted stories for early film stars like ZaSu Pitts, Elaine Hammerstein, and Owen Moore. Yeiser Mason is best known for the films Bright Skies (1920), The Heart of Twenty (1920), Backstage (1927), The Broadway Melody (1929), Little Women (1933), The Age of Innocence (1934), Magnificent Obsession (1935), and Golden Boy (1939).\n\nIn 1930, The Broadway Melody won the Academy Award for Best Picture and in 1934, Little Women won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, making Yeiser Mason the first woman to win the award.\n\nEslanda “Essie” Cardozo Goode Robeson (1895-1965) led a unique and full life, working both within the entertainment industry and as a civil rights activist.\n\nIn 1920, she met activist, actor, and singer Paul Robeson, and they married a year later. Eslanda gave up her intentions to pursue medicine in 1925 and supported her husband as his business and talent manager. Robeson also followed her own acting career, most notably appearing as Adah in Borderline (1930), an avant-garde silent film directed by Kenneth MacPherson. The film revolves around an inter-racial love triangle and its effects on the community.As an author, Robeson wrote her first book, a biography of her husband Paul Robeson, Negro in 1930. It was well-received by critics Harry Hanson and W.E.B. du Bois. Robeson completed her second book, African Journey, in 1946, the same year she received her Ph.D. in anthropology from the Hartford Seminary. Her third book, American Argument, was published in 1949, and was a collection of dialogues and comments that allowed Robeson an opportunity to speak on society, politics, gender role, and race relations.\n\nJenny Gilbertson (1902-1990) was inspired to learn about filmmaking in 1929 after watching a screening of an amateur film about the Scottish Loch Lomond in London. She immediately purchased a 16mm Cine-Kodak camera and taught herself the fundamentals of cinematography while shooting footage of squirrels in Kensington Gardens and barges on the River Thames.\n\nAs a documentary filmmaker in Scotland and Canada, all of Gilbertson’s films focused on embracing nature, farming life, fishing, families that did such activities and anything that captured the environment she was in. Jenny lectured all over the world about her nature films, and took a hiatus from filmmaking to teach at a local Shetland primary school for two decades before making one of her most influential films, 1967’s People of Many Lands.\n\nYin Mingzhu (1904-1989), also known professionally as Pearl Ing, started her career as a model and society girl. At seventeen, Yin met director Dan Duyu at a party and the pair began working together. She went on to star in about half of the 30 movies Dan directed from 1922-1952. In 1922, Yin starred in Sea Oath, making her the first woman to play the leading role in a film made in Shanghai—the earliest center of Chinese filmmaking.Yin and Dan married in 1926, and Yin gradually started working behind the scenes as a production coordinator and investor with the Shanghai Shadow Play Company. When the Shadow Play Company was destroyed during the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1932, Yin invested in and established the Shanghai Talkie Company in 1934.As an actress, Yin is best known for Some Girl (1925), The Cave of the Silken Web (1927), A Dream of Red Mansions (1928), Oriental Night (1930), Golden Age (1933), and Peach-Blossom Dream (1934). Unfortunately, many of Yin’s films are thought to lost or destroyed, except for an original copy of The Cave of the Silken Web, which was rediscovered in Norway in 2011.\n\nHaydée Chikly (1906-1998), considered the first professional actress and screenwriter in Africa, stated at a young age: “I do not want a quiet and easy life, I want to fight, strive and struggle.”\n\nBorn in Tunisia, Africa, Chikly was encouraged to pursue her interests in the arts from her mother, a musician, and her father, an experimental filmmaker. Widely considered the first narrative film made in Tunisia and the first indigenous North African film production, Albert Samama Chikly directed his daughter in her first starring role, a short film she wrote called Zohra (1922).\n\nChikly’s next film was another silent drama, “Ain el-Ghezal” [The Girl from Carthage] (1924), a Tunisian-inspired “Romeo and Juliet.” She wrote the script \"to show how badly women were treated when they were just sold off with an arranged marriage into a man’s world.” Chikly also partially edited “Ain el-Ghezal” as a film cutter and colorist. Unfortunately, in the early 1980s, the script for “Ain Ghezal” was removed from the family archives when the Ministry of Tunisian Culture planned to open a cinema museum, and the script was lost.\n\nHannah Weinstein (1911-1984), born and raised in New York, NY, studied journalism at New York University as a young woman. After graduating in 1927, she went to work for The New York Herald Tribune. Ten years later, she left The Tribune to join the Fiorello H. La Guardia mayoral campaign. After working for the La Guardia reelection campaign, she was a speech writer for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nIn the wake of the McCarthy era, Weinstein moved to Paris in 1950 and then London in 1952, where she started Sapphire Films, a film and television production company that produced scripts by blacklisted Hollywood writers, including series episodes written (under a pseudonym) by Ring Lardner Jr. and Adrian Scott. Weinstein herself was designated a “concealed Communist” by the F.B.I. Weinstein worked in England before returning to the United States in 1962; during this ten year period Sapphire Films made 435 television films and series, including the hits Robin Hood (1955-1960), The Four Just Men (1959-1960) and Colonel March of Scotland Yard (1954-1956).\n\nIn 1971, along with Ossie Davis, Rita Moreno, Diana Sands, and James Earl Jones, Weinstein founded Third World Cinema. The production company’s goals were “to train people of color for work in the film industry and to make feature films from a minority perspective.” With Third World Cinema, Weinstein produced Claudine (1974), Greased Lightning (1977), and Stir Crazy (1980).\n\nBorn in Melbourne, Australia, Peggy Glanville-Hicks (1912-1990) pursued music from a young age and began composing at the age of 7. By the time she was 15 years old, she started studying composition with Fritz Hart and piano with Waldemar Seidel.\n\nShe attended the Royal College of Music in London from 1931-1936, studying piano, conducting, and composition. In 1938, Glanville-Hicks became the first Australian composer whose work was performed at an International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) Festival.\n\nFrom 1949-1958 Glanville-Hicks served as a critic for the New York Herald Tribune. At the same time, she was still composing and was the musical director at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1960, Glanville-Hicks composed the score for Shirley Clarke’s UNICEF-produced documentary A Scary Time. Unfortunately, the final piece was so unsettling, UNICEF deemed it too upsetting and never used it.\n\nAfter her death in 1990, Glanville-Hicks’ will established the Peggy Glanville-Hicks Composers’ House in her home in Paddington, Sydney, as a residency for Australian and overseas composers. The organization New Music Network established the Peggy Glanville-Hicks Address in her honor in 1999.\n\nBorn in San Francisco, CA, Esther Eng (1914-1970) spent her childhood in the Cantonese Opera Houses and cinemas popular in Chinatown. When she was 19, after seeing the Chinese nationalist film The Battle of Shanghai, Eng’s father and his business partners were inspired to create Kwong Ngai Talking Pictures Company (a.k.a. Cathay Pictures Ltd.). Eng quickly became a producer at the company.\n\nEng’s first film credit was co-producing Heartaches (1935), a melodrama depicting the Chinese war effort. A Los Angeles Times review acknowledged Heartaches as the “first oriental production with sound finished in Hollywood.” In June of 1936, Eng and actress Wai Kim Fong traveled to Hong Kong to recruit talent for her next project. Eng decided to register Kwong Ngai Talking Pictures in Hong Kong, cast Wai Kim Fong as the lead, and directed the film herself.National Heroine (1937) was a massive success and praised for its portrayal of a heroine fighting alongside male comrades for the sake of China. The Cantonese Women’s Association gave Eng an award for the film’s patriotic message and promotion of positive images of women. While in Asia, Eng made four more social commentary films focused on female protagonists, including It’s a Women’s World (1939). It’s a Women’s World, also co-written by Eng, was advertised as the first Hong Kong produced film to feature an all-female cast of 36 actresses. After returning to the U.S., Eng spent several months in Hollywood learning about new developments in motion pictures before directing Golden Gate Girl (1941). Eng directed four more films from 1946-1961, but never attained the same level of success as she had overseas.\n\nMilicent Patrick (1915-1978) studied at the Chouniard Art Institute from 1936-1939, where she focused on illustration and drawing. Patrick started working at Walt Disney Studios in 1939 in their all-female ink and paint department.By 1940, she was moved to the Animation and Effects department, where she became one of the first female animators at Disney. Her work as a color animator can be seen in four of the sequences in the film Fantasia. During her time at Disney, she also worked on the film Dumbo before leaving the studio in 1941.In 1947, while at Universal Studios for an acting gig, Patrick met Bud Westmore, head of the Universal’s makeup department, and showed him her sketches. Patrick became the first woman to work in a special effects makeup department, credited with contributing to makeups in Against All Flags (1952), It Came From Outer Space (1953), Sign of the Pagan (1954), This Island Earth (1955), and The Mole People (1956).In 1953, Patrick began designing the cowl piece for Gil-man in Creature from the Black Lagoon. During promotion for the film, she was sent on a press tour dubbed “The Beauty Who Created the Beast,” to discuss the creation of the creature. Westmore quickly changed it to “The Beauty Who Lives With the Beast,” to avoid citing Patrick as the creator of the Gill-man. When she returned to Los Angeles after the tour, Universal fired Patrick, letting her go due to Westmore’s jealousy over the attention she received. Unfortunately, Patrick never worked behind the scenes again. She spent the rest of her life as a \"society woman\" and portrait artist.\n\nDubbed the “Queen of Space Opera” for her contributions to the science-fiction genre, Leigh Brackett was the first woman shortlisted for the Hugo Award. Leigh Brackett discovered fantasy-science fiction by reading E.R. Burroughs’ The Gods of Mars when she was in the eighth grade, and began writing and submitting novels to editors in 1928 when she was just 13-years-old. Brackett sold her first story to the “pulp fiction” magazine Astounding in 1939 and published her first full-length novel, the mystery No Good from a Corpse, in 1944.\n\nDespite science fiction being a male-dominated genre to the extent that both the profession and the content of the stories was more often than not anti-female, Brackett pursued the genre wholeheartedly and thrived. From 1939 to 1974, Brackett published more than 50 stories in more than 13 pulp magazines. She was so much a part of the scifi world that Brackett's fans adoringly named her the “Queen of Space Opera,” and her work would help shape the genre in the mid-20th century. Her success helped break down the gender bias in the science-fiction field.\n\nIn 1944, director Howard Hawks hired Brackett to work with William Faulkner to adapt Raymond Chandler’s short story Killer in the Rain for film. Hawks thought Brackett had the right “strong stuff” after reading one of her crime novels, thinking that she “wrote like a man.” Brackett later said, “[Hawks] was somewhat shaken when he discovered that it was Miss and not Mr. Brackett.” The Big Sleep (1946), starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, became one of Hawks’ most well-known films, and Brackett continued writing scripts—notably Rio Bravo (1959), Hatari! (1962), and The Long Goodbye (1973)—and turned in the first draft of The Empire Strikes Back just before she died in 1978.\n\nBorn Eleanora Solomonovna Derenkovsky in Kiev, Ukraine, Maya Deren survived the Russian Revolution and spent her childhood in Ukraine until 1922 when her family moved to Syracuse, NY.\n\nDeren studied journalism at Syracuse University and New York University, graduating in 1936. While at NYU, she became interested in film and photography. Deren went on to study literature at Smith College and received her M.A. in 1939. After graduating, Deren became choreographer and anthropologist Katherine Dunham’s secretary in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nIn 1941, she met Alexander Hammid, a Czechoslovakian refugee who emigrated to the United States to work as a motion picture photographer for The March of Time newsreels. The two married in 1942, and it was during this time Deren changed her first name to Maya, the Sanskrit word for “illusion.” In 1943, Deren’s father died and left her a small inheritance with which she purchased a second-hand Bolex 16mm camera, which she and Hamid used to make the film Meshes in the Afternoon. Meshes of the Afternoon (1943), is one of the most influential experimental films in American cinema history. Deren went on to make several films of her own, including At Land (1944), A Study in Choreography for Camera (1945), and Ritual in Transfigured Time (1946), writing, producing, directing, editing, and photographing them with help from only one other person, Hella Heyman, her camerawoman.\n\nIn 1946, Deren published An Anagram of Art, Form, and Film and received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Work in the Field of Motion Pictures. Deren was the first filmmaker to be awarded a Guggenheim fellowship. In 1947, Deren presented Meshes in the Afternoon at the Cannes Film Festival where it won the Grand Prix International in the category of 16mm Film, Experimental Class. It was the first time the award went to a film produced in the United States and the first time a female director was honored.\n\nShirley Clarke (1919-1997) was drawn to the arts at an early age­­—particularly dance­­—which her father and discouraged. It wasn’t until she attended college that she could dance, and trained under the Martha Graham technique, the Humphrey-Weidman technique, and the Hanya Holm method of modern dance.\n\nClarke started her artistic career as a dancer in the New York avant-garde modern dance movement, but in 1951, following a long recovery after the birth of her daughter, Clarke began rethinking her creative direction. Inspired by filmmakers like Maya Deren, Clarke began developing her own style of film dubbed \"Cine-dance.\" Rather than documenting a dance as it exists on stage, Cine-dance can only exist on film.\n\nIn her first film Dance in the Sun (1953), Clarke adapted a piece of Daniel Nagrin’s choreography, and the New York Dance Film Society selected it as the best dance film of the year. In 1954 she started studying filmmaking with Hans Richter at the City College of New York; Clarke broke through the independent filmmaking scene in New York and became a member of the Independent Filmmakers of America in 1955. Clarke received an Academy Award nomination for Best Short Live Action for Skyscraper (1959) and won for Best Documentary for Robert Frost: A Lover's Quarrel With the World (1963). In 1961, Clarke signed the manifesto Statement for a New American Cinema, and in 1962, she co-founded The Film-Makers' Cooperative.\n\nIn 1961, Clarke directed her first feature film, The Connection, adapted from Jack Gelber’s play. Shot like a “faux-documentary,” the film follows a young filmmaker who attempts to film junkies waiting for their heroin dealer to arrive. The Connection was embroiled in a major censorship case as Clarke filed suit to be able to show the film in New York. She was initially denied a license because of the use of the word “shit” in the film and the case went to the New York State Court of Appeals, which she won.\n\nDorothea ”DeDe” Corothers Allen (1923-2010), nicknamed the “film editing doctor,” revolutionized imagery, sound, and pacing in American films, and is best known for editing classic films like The Hustler (1961), Bonnie and Clyde (1967), Dog Day Afternoon (1975), and Reds (1981).\n\nBorn in Cleveland, Oh, Allen moved to California to attend Scripps College in Claremont, CA in the 1940s. After graduation, she worked her way up as a production runner, a sound librarian, and then as an assistant film editor at Columbia Pictures. She edited commercial and industrial films before becoming a full-fledged feature film editor. After 16 years of working in Los Angeles without much recognition, Allen and her husband moved to New York, where she edited her first notable feature in 1959: Odds Against Tomorrow, directed by Robert Wise.One of Allen’s biggest impacts on American film and editing was her use of European techniques, particularly jump cuts. For example, in the ambush scene at the end of Bonnie and Clyde, Allen used about 50 cuts in one minute, slowing down and speeding up the action. Allen earned Academy Award nominations for her work on Dog Day Afternoon (1975), Reds (1981), and Wonder Boys (2000). She received the American Cinema Editors’ Career Achievement Award in 1994 and the Motion Picture Editors Guild’s Fellowship and Service Award in 2007. In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild compiled a list of 75 of the best-edited films; three of Allen’s films made the List: Bonnie and Clyde, Dog Day Afternoon, and Reds. Only one editor—George Tomasini—has more films on this list.\n\nBanned by the Czechoslovak government in the 1960s for her controversial and avant-garde work, Věra Chytilová (1929-2014) is best known for pioneering Czech cinema, particularly Czech New Wave.\n\nChytilová initially studied philosophy and architecture before pursuing the arts. She worked as a model and as a photo re-toucher before working as a clapper girl for the Barrandov Film Studios in Prague. She sought a recommendation from Barrandov Film Studios to study film production, but was denied. Undeterred by the rejection, she was accepted into the Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (FAMU) at the age of 28.\n\nIn 1963, Chytilová released her first feature film Something Different. Three years later, she released her most well-known film Sedmikrásky (Daisies; 1966). The film was banned for a year within Czechoslovakia upon its initial release because of its depictions and imagery of wasting food, but in 1966 the film won the Grand Prix at the Bergamo Film Festival in Italy, influencing the film’s popularity and Chytilová’s career. However, after Daisies, the government made it very difficult for Chytilová to find work within Czechoslovakia and she only made one more film before the Soviet Union invasion of 1968.\n\nIn 1976, due to low cinema attendance, the government approached Chytilová to begin directing films through one of the state-run production companies, Short Film Studios, but would not grant her creative freedoms. Due to international pressure on Chytilová’s behalf, the government allowed her to continue making films, but was continually met with controversy and heavy censorship.\n\nBrianne Murphy (1933-2003) was the first woman permitted into Hollywood features union as a director of photography, was the first female director of photography for a major film studio, and was the first woman to become a member of the American Society of Cinematographers Guild.\n\nBorn in London, England, Murphy and her family moved to the United States in 1933 to escape the war.

Eventually, director Elia Kazan allowed her to watch the rest of the filming process. She used the opportunity to learn filmmaking and how to use equipment properly.\n\nBy 1956, Murphy had settled in Hollywood and began working with low-budget filmmakers, where she was promoted to production manager. While working in production management, she would often work as a second cameraman on set to save money and gain more experience. Murphy attempted to join her local union branch in 1973. A union officer told her that she could join “over his dead body.” The rejection motivated her to work harder; she eventually became the first female executive board member to the International Cinematographers Guild. Murphy's career took off in 1975 when cinematographer Richard Glouner had to leave the show Columbo and recommended her as his replacement.\n\nIn 1980, Murphy became the first female director of photography on a major studio picture, Fatso.

However, her contract required that the network gave her one season of whatever kind of show she wanted to make. The Carol Burnett Show aired 279 episodes over eleven seasons, and went on to win 25 primetime Emmy Awards. In 2007, Time magazine listed the show as one of the \"100 Best TV Shows of All Time.\"\n\nIn 2003, Burnett received a Kennedy Center Honor for her contributions to the performing arts and American culture and was inducted into the California Hall of Fame at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts in 2009.
