        "text": "Act I. All About Eve or Wishful Casting\n\nWanna play a game? It’ll be fun. If you’re a hardcore movie or TV fan, chances are you’ve played “Wishful Casting” either as a daydream, or in a group, maybe online. Admit it. Maybe you call it something else, but the game remains the same. My mother and I used to do this all the time, brainstorming who might be the ideal candidate to replace an actor who decides to leave a TV show, or whom we might cast when a remake of a favorite movie or show was announced, who might be the best choice to cast in a book-to-movie adaptation, and, finally, who could play so-and-so if a movie were ever made about such-and-such real life event. Believe me, my mother (may she rest in peace) and I second-guessed a good many casting choices in projects torn from the headlines or from the history books.\n\nIn today’s round, I’d like to revisit 1950’s all-time classic, the one and only All About Eve, starring Bette Davis and Angela Lansbury. I mean Bette Davis and Anne Baxter. Anyway, the familiar classic scored 14 Oscar nominations and ultimately won Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay (Joseph L. Mankiewicz), among others [1].\n\nAll About Eve is steeped in movie lore. In this greatest and wittiest backstage saga, Davis plays a fortyish Broadway star, still at the peak of her prowess, who grants admittance into her inner circle an awestruck, “down-on-her-luck,” fan, that is, Anne Baxter’s titular Eve. She makes herself indispensable to Davis’s Margo though the latter comes to question whether Eve has her own agenda, such as cozying up to anyone and everyone who might help advance her (Eve’s) Broadway ambitions, even if it means seducing Margo’s longtime—albeit younger–lover, a hotshot director named Bill with lots of clout, played with enviable swagger by Gary Merrill.\n\nAbout that whole “lore” thing, well, consider that All About Eve gave Bette Davis the best role she’d had in a few good years, since the mid 1940s, and, thus, provided her one of the greatest of all comebacks–not to mention a future husband in the form of no less than onscreen romantic partner, Merrill. Margo Channing may very well be her most fondly remembered role, ripe as it is with classic one-liners. Incredible as it might seem now, Davis wasn’t the first choice for the role. No, Oscar winner Claudette Colbert was cast originally though, to clarify, Colbert was not even the first, second, or third choice, according to multiple accounts [2]. Nonetheless, Colbert looked to have the right stuff, and the project went into pre-production when, lo, an injury forced her to withdraw. Enter Davis on barely a moment’s notice. So far, so great.\n\nThe casting of Anne Baxter as scheming Eve Harrington is another lore-worthy item. Baxter was also not the first choice. 20th Century Fox head Darryl F. Zanuck encouraged Mankiewicz to hire Jeanne Crain in the role of the scheming upstart. Crain was a popular though lightweight actress who had, nonetheless, earned a Best Actress nomination after being oddly cast as a bi-racial character who passes for white in Pinky. (Why wouldn’t she pass as white? Almost nobody in the history of movies was ever as white as, and certainly not whiter than, Jeanne Crain. No one EVER mistook her as anything else.) While Mankiewicz had already established a relationship with Crain as she had just appeared in 1949’s A Letter to Three Wives (for which JMank won Oscars as director and screenwriter), he–reportedly–professed that Crain lacked the “bitch virtuosity” to pull off a role as underhanded as Eve (Staggs 72). Zanuck relented, opening the door for Baxter, who–to her credit–had recently won the Best Supporting Actress for her role in Fox’s The Razor’s Edge, playing an American woman fallen on hard times in 1920s Paris.\n\nNow, here’s where the story becomes even more interesting. In a Criterion interview, costume historian Larry McQueen offers that one reason JMank favored Baxter is that she bore a passing resemblance to Colbert, that is, a young Claudette Colbert, who’d been cast as Margo already, a story corroborated by Staggs (60). This makes a degree or two of sense. A quick look at photos of both women reveals a plausible–if not highly pronounced–likeness. (Feel free to research on your own.) The selling point could be as simple as short, similarly styled, hairdos, a patrician profile, and maybe an archness about the eyes. Whatever. McQueen continues, explaining that, as the tale unfolds, Eve would look more and more like Margo, the similarities enhanced, such that Eve seemed more threatening, playing upon Margo’s insecurities about aging and wanting to hang-on to her lover if not her career. The costumes would also reflect this in that whatever Margo wore, Eve would appear in a comparable if not exact version, meaning more youthful (shorter) and tailored (that is, more form fitting and, therefore, more figure flattering). When Margo opts for an off-the-shoulder look, Eve opts likewise; when Margo sports chiffon, Eve also sports chiffon [3]. Great conceit, especially if it works on a purely visual level without specific commentary from one character or another. The effect is never overt enough to register as “copycat.” The audience registers it almost sub-consciously. So far, so good.\n\nThe trouble is that once Colbert withdrew from the production and Davis committed, the movie lost that element of visual intrigue. Baxter looks nothing like Davis, especially given the latter’s glamourous transformation with a stylish side-part hairstyle cascading to her shoulders and dramatic red slash of mouth. Oh, and, of course, Davis’s unmistakable big, blue eyes. Remember, before she was hailed in 1981’s massively popular radio hit, “Bette Davis Eyes,” the actress was often hailed as “Popeye the Magnificent” in the press. Not so, Baxter. So, there’s that. Sure, the costume designers–Charles Le Maire for Eve (along with most of the cast) and Edith Head (on loan from Paramount) for Bette’s Margo–can still work their conceit about echoing outfits, but that doesn’t resolve what appears to be a major casting miscalculation. See, without the “oomph” of casting a younger version of the actress playing Margo, Eve has to be performed with great delicacy, great subtlety, but only up to a point.\n\nI know I am not alone when I state that I think Baxter’s performance is the weakest link in All About Eve. There. It’s out in the open. Sure, the audience learns–SPOILER ALERT!–that Eve is not everything she appears to be but the way Baxter portrays her, one has to wonder why most of the other characters are such late arrivals to the game. From the beginning, just about everything that Baxter/Eve does comes across as phony. Whether demure or lightly self-deprecating, she seems fake, not a hair’s breadth of credibility. As has oft-been noted, how can it be that Margo and her sophisticated circle of friends, including seasoned writers, directors, producers, and at least one influential theatre critic, are fooled by such an obvious pretender? Of course, the true-blue believers flip that argument on its head by observing that Margo and her friends are so ridiculously full of themselves that they naturally fall for Eve’s silken-voiced flattery. That almost makes sense though why must the audience be one-step ahead, per Danny Peary (5)? What’s the value? It’s not a Hitchcock film, after all. That noted, one player in the group snaps to Eve’s wiles right from the beginning: Birdie, Margo’s seen-it-all-and-done-it-all dresser/housekeeper, played by the one and only Thelma Ritter. After hearing Eve recount her woeful tale of dashed hopes, Birdie intones, “Everything but the bloodhounds snappin’ at her rear end.” She later shares that Eve studies Margo, the way one would study an object. Amusingly, Margo echoes Birdie’s own words when harrumphing about Eve to Bill.\n\nThat noted, I guess Baxter served Mank the performance he wanted considering that Baxter snagged an Oscar nod for Best Actress as did Davis, along with supporting players Ritter, Celeste Holm and George Sanders (who actually won the trophy in his category). Still, the game of Wishful Casting comes to me at times with this one. An early thought was that Donna Reed, still a few years away from reinventing herself with an Oscar winning performance in From Here to Eternity, could have been fun, but the person that I keep going back to is no less than Angela Lansbury. That’s right, Angela Lansbury, five-time Tony winner–six if you count her Lifetime Achievement Award–beloved voice of Mrs. Potts in Disney’s classic Beauty and the Beast, and, of course, super-sleuth of the long-running TV hit Murder, She Wrote, evermore popular in reruns.\n\nAt the time of All About Eve, Lansbury reported to MGM as a contract player though she was hardly an unknown quantity, reaping two Best Supporting Actress nominations in her first two years of moviemaking: first, for Gaslight (1944); then, for The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945). She’d eventually earn a third nomination for The Manchurian Candidate (1962), but I’m getting ahead of myself. So, yes, Lansbury had the talent to play Eve, but she also had an advantage that Baxter lacked. Lansbury resembled Bette Davis just enough to bring back the subtext that was lost when Davis replaced Colbert. This is not to say, no ma’am, that Lansbury was, ahem a Dead Ringer for Davis but that she had the right saucer-eyed look that might give Margo pause as though she were looking at a younger version of herself, and, yes, it’s mainly in the eyes. Maybe they’re not Bette Davis eyes, per se, but close enough, closer than Baxter’s almond shaped eyes, fer shur. That both Davis and Lansbury had blue eyes wouldn’t necessarily register in a black and white film, true, but Lansbury certainly knew how to use her eyes as expressively as Davis. Anyone who’s ever indulged in a MSW marathon can attest to that. Oh, sure, Lansbury was taller than Davis (per the IMDb, 5’8″ to Davis’s 5’3″), but costumes, camera angles, and staging can minimize that effect. It happens (happened), often enough, when female performers are/were taller than their male counterparts who might have been “bigger,” if not taller, stars. Or, who knows, the height difference could have worked in the movie’s favor, giving Margo another reason to feel threatened. Maybe not. Oh, and if it matters, Lansbury would have been about 25 at the time of All About Eve, two years younger than Baxter (per the IMDb).\n\nOkay, so what about that “bitch” element as Mank put it so eloquently? Could Lansbury muster that effect? Oh, I bet she could. Remember, Lansbury earned an Oscar nod for her first screen role as Nancy, a cockney maid in Gaslight, starring Best Actress winner Ingrid Bergman along with Charles Boyer and Joseph Cotten. In that old-time classic, pouty Nancy’s behavior borders on impudence when dealing with the man of the house (Boyer) and downright frosty when “handling” his anxious wife, Paula. Bergman’s Paula is as suspicious of Nancy as Nancy is of Paula, neither of whom realizes that Boyer’s plan–SPOILER ALERT–is to drive Paula to madness–or for her to believe she’s going mad–in order to cover the tracks of his sinister deeds. His agenda includes tamping down the amount of gas needed for household lighting fixtures; hence, the term we now know as “gaslighting.” For those who hadn’t already heard, that’s the origin, but I digress.\n\nAnyway, in the early 1940s, Lansbury was fairly new in the U.S, having arrived with her mother and two brothers, to get away from wartime England, when she–theatrically trained though relatively untested–scored an audition through a family contact at MGM and began work on Gaslight at the astonishingly young age of 17, even waiting until she turned 18 in order to film a scene in which Nancy smokes [4]. Anyway, whether 17 or 18, Lansbury’s Nancy is worldly beyond her years and as startling in her own way as Bette Davis’s cruelly manipulative Cockney waitress Mildred is in 1934’s Of Human Bondage, the role and the film that changed the course of Davis’s career. Oh, and guess who played Mildred in a 1948 Of Human Bondage radio production? So, yes, “bitch virtuosity.” Done. Score, Lansbury.\n\nSo, that takes care of the B quotient, but that side of Eve is the part which Baxter lands, mostly. What about the other side of Eve, the modest young thing, so vulnerable and eager to please, what about that aspect? That’s the part of Baxter’s performance that jars in its falseness. Could Lansbury be more convincing, such that Eve’s gradual unmasking brings a jolt of surprise to both the audience as well as the other characters. Yes, I think she could. To that end, consider Lansbury’s second nominated performance as lovelorn Sibyl Vane in The Picture of Dorian Gray, a mere year after Gaslight. Vane is a music hall entertainer in Victorian England who charms the protagonist, an aristocrat, blessed with all the good looks in the world (played in this version by Hurd Hatfield) who strikes a deal with the devil that allows him (Gray) to remain as youthful and gorgeous as he ever was though with a horrifying twist. Vane is like a plaything to Gray so while he’s fond of her and her singing, initially, he dismisses her when she becomes too eager to please, all but sealing her fate.\n\nAs Sibyl, Lansbury gives a heartbreaking performance, one so far far removed from snotty Nancy in Gaslight that, of course, the Academy nominated her again so quickly. Everything about Sibyl, even the way she holds herself, is different from Nancy. Further, make no mistake, Lansbury is gorgeous as Sibyl Vane, as ripe with luscious beauty as any screen siren in the movies. The back-to-back success of these two performances is what assures this viewer, at least, that she could handle the ginormous complexity of Eve, relative, that is, to Baxter’s take. In Lansbury’s case, it could be like seeing poor, pitiful, but beautiful, Sibyl Vane morph into cold and calculating Nancy without warning–and in one sitting. Oh, and to be clear, if you’ve ever seen Lansbury’s magnificent, Oscar nominated work in 1962’s The Manchurian Candidate, she leaves no doubt that she knows how to spin a character on its head.\n\nOf course, as much fun as Wishful Casting can be, it’s also fairly ridiculous since, in this case, what’s done is done, so what’s the point, right? After all, Lansbury, as noted, was an MGM contract player while 20th Century Fox produced and distributed All About Eve, meaning even if Mank and Fox casting agents had had an inkling of hiring Lansbury, that could have only happened with the blessing of MGM’s top brass, which still included the “great and powerful” Louis B. Mayer. Such loan outs were not always welcome and required considerable finesse. Lansbury, not being a top-tier star, might not have warranted the effort though she had been loaned out for other pics, notably Paramount’s lavish Samson and Delilah in 1949. Still again, records indicate that Lansbury might have been considered, however briefly, for the key role of Miss Caswell (Staggs 11), budding showgirl, protege, and arm candy to Sanders’ megalomaniacal theatre columnist Addison DeWitt at Margo’s “bumpy night” of a party; a smallish part, true, but one made legendary due to the fortuitous casting of Marilyn Monroe, a starlet only two years away from breaking through as Fox’s top box office draw thanks to Niagara, How to Marry a Millionaire, and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Miss Caswell wasn’t MM’s first big screen gig, nor even her first speaking part, but she’s an utter delight in her only appearance alongside the one and only Davis. But I digress since this piece is more All About Angela rather than All About Marilyn.\n\nBy the early 1950s, Lansbury and MGM parted ways, mutually by many accounts. Sure, Lansbury worked and even made a handful of notable films, such as her two Oscar nominated efforts but also the likes of National Velvet and The Harvey Girls. The concern was that many of the films did more for Lansbury’s co-stars, such as Elizabeth Taylor and Anne Revere in the former and Judy Garland in the latter, than they ever did for her, necessarily. In other words, she spent most of the 1940s playing sisters and BFFs of better known stars. Indeed, backing up, Lansbury lost her second Oscar race for Dorian Gray to Velvet co-star Revere, playing Taylor’s mother while Lansbury enacted the sister. Sure, it’s a living, and a nice one at that, but Lansbury also felt she had more to offer and just wanted the chance to stretch. It’s a shame, too, that in spite of her two Oscar nominations–at such a prodigiously young age and in two such wildly varied roles– this didn’t result in greater attention in MGM’s front office but as Lansbury subsequently expressed, no one at the studio ever knew what to do with her. Yes, in spite of two Oscar nominations.\n\nLansbury continued to work steadily if unspectacularly in movies and TV without the safety net of MGM for much of the 1950s and early 1960s, during which time she began playing the mothers of people not much younger than her. For example, she was barely 10 years older than Elvis Presley when she played his mother in 1961’s Blue Hawaii. She was 12 years older than Warren Beatty when the two of them played mother and son in 1962’s All Fall Down. In both instances, mind you, she was still in her 30s [5]. Her work for director John Frankenheimer in All Fall Down proved so satisfactory that even before the film wrapped, Frankenheimer approached Lansbury about what he believed should be her next role. He all but demanded it, in fact.\n\nThat role turned out to be Eleanor Iselin, politician’s wife and mother of a tormented Korean War hero Raymond Shaw, played by Laurence Harvey (a mere 3 years younger than Lansbury) in The Manchurian Candidate, 1962’s brazen mix of conspiracy thriller and political satire based on Richard Condon’s 1959 novel of the same name. Ushered to the big screen by superstar Frank Sinatra, who headlines as one of Shaw’s former platoon members, battling nightmares and flashbacks. Is it PTSD (rarely discussed as openly at the time as is now common) or something far different and insidious? An Army Intelligence officer, Sinatra’s Marco tracks down Shaw and becomes ensnared in his unravelling.\n\nEleanor Iselin is a piece of work who stage manages her political second husband’s every word and deed. The pair of them, but especially Eleanor, are so rabidly right wing, so rabidly anti-communist, that they make Roy Cohn and Senator Joseph McCarthy look like hippie-dippy flower children though the degree of Eleanor’s utter contempt for humanity would frighten Machiavelli or Lady MacBeth and, yes, make even Eve Harrington green with envy. To claim that Eleanor Iselin is fiercely protective of her son is a perverse understatement. To her credit, Lansbury doesn’t play her as vicious, “mad,” or otherwise certifiably over-the-top crazy, but, rather, she’s cold. Indeed, it seems that the higher the stakes, the colder she reveals herself to be. The face hardens, becomes mask-like; the gaze becomes steelier, and the voice rarely rises above a whisper. Think what might happen if Streep’s Miranda Priestly had spawned the heir to Anthony Hopkins’s Hannibal Lecter. That’s Lansbury’s Eleanor Iselin.\n\nThe Manchurian Candidate secured Lansbury’s third and final Oscar nomination, yet again as a supporting player. The loss was tough in many ways because Lansbury was probably so, so, close. After all, she’d won the Golden Globe in her category as well as the National Board of Review award. Yes, things were definitely moving in her favor, keeping in mind that almost everyone who knows the history of such things will probably concur: Angela Lansbury deserved the Oscar that year for her supporting performance in The Manchurian Candidate. The paradox is that almost no one–none that I’ve ever read–thinks that Patty Duke absolutely DID NOT deserve the Oscar she won that year in the same category for The Miracle Worker.\n\nAct II. The Paradox: Eleanor, Helen, and the Oscars\n\nAh, yes, Patty Duke as Helen Keller, the remarkable American scholar, author, suffragette, and disability rights advocate–among other strengths–who rose to prominence in the early 20th century after overcoming the odds against her once childhood illness left her both sightless and without hearing. Her achievements came in no small part due to the tutelage of her teacher Annie Sullivan, the “twist,” for lack of a better word, being that shortly before her work with the Kellers, Sullivan had undergone a series of operations to restore her own eyesight, which had been badly damaged since childhood due to disease. To paraphrase Mark Twain, one of Keller’s dearest friends: Helen Keller is the miracle, and Annie Sullivan is the miracle worker. William Gibson’s award winning play was based on Keller’s autobiography as well as, as one source indicates, Annie Sullivan’s own account of her unsteady introduction to the Keller family when Helen was seven years old and her parents had all but given up hope that their struggling–yet willful–child, so adrift in her own world of darkness and silence, would ever learn how to be more independent, and, okay, better behaved. [< To clarify, Duke was just a few years older than Helen was at the time the play takes place; however, the actress’s round face and ever-so-diminutive stature–she’s tiny, tiny, y’all–worked well in her favor, creating and maintaining the illusion of a much younger child.] The play premiered to high praise for Duke and Anne Bancroft (as Annie Sullivan) in 1959 and played for 791 performances, earning Tony awards for Gibson, Bancroft, and director Arthur Penn. As well, Duke, already a budding professional with a smattering of movie and TV credits, won a Theatre World award for her portrayal. Then, Hollywood beckoned with Bancroft, Duke, and Penn tapped to recrate their work onscreen along with, yes, Gibson on board to adapt.\n\nBy the time cameras rolled on The Miracle Worker, Duke was a teen, but, no matter, the odds–including the gift of being extra petite (again, with a round face)–worked in her favor. She might not look as young as 7 years old per the script, but she still looks more like a child rather than a teen. That year, even with beloved veteran Thelma Ritter (The Birdman of Alcatraz) in her sixth–and what would be her final–Oscar race, even with Mary Badham, a newcomer so beloved as ‘Scout’ in the instant classic To Kill a Mockingbird, and the debut of exciting Shirley Knight in Sweet Bird of Youth, the Oscar for 1962’s Best Supporting Actress came down to Duke and Lansbury, no ifs, ands, or buts.\n\nSo, yes, Lansbury went into the last stretch with a Globe and honors from the National Board of Review, but Duke was still in it to win it, per her Globe nomination, her three-way tie for Globes’ Most Promising Newcomer award (or something to that effect [6]), and her supporting actress first-place finish in Motion Picture Exhibitor‘s Golden Laurel awards voting (per theatre owners and operators). As dazzling as Lansbury is in The Manchurian Candidate, what Duke achieves in The Miracle Worker may very well be nothing short of singular, so extraordinary is her absolute commitment to relaying Keller’s experience through performance. Of course, this is all speculation except that we know Duke bested Lansbury in Oscar’s final tally. My thought is that voters were drawn to Duke because she carried the prestige of being a Broadway talent recreating her stage role for film; she played a real-life figure (always a plus); hers was a movie of inspiration and hope (if that’s not redundant), and people felt good about themselves for voting for her for all those reasons; that, and they were awed by Duke’s sheer talent, especially–it must be noted–in someone so young. Lansbury’s Iselin and the movie in which it appeared offered no such lasting goodwill.\n\nTo those who carp that Duke’s role in The Miracle Worker is akin to a second lead compared to Lansbury’s noticeably more–what?–compact role, that’s worth considering though in the end, there is no question that The Miracle Worker is more Annie Sullivan’s story than Helen Keller’s. No doubt, Duke’s scenes with Bancroft give the movie tremendous power but whereas at a certain point Duke’s Helen interacts almost exclusively with her teacher, the same is not true with Annie as Bancroft’s Sullivan must also hold her own in scene after scene in which she’s pitted against Keller family dynamics whether Captain Keller (Victor Jory), Kate Keller (Inga Swenson) or even James Keller (Andrew Prine), one of the captain’s–grown–sons from his first marriage, each player with an agenda and, by extension, an argument. Further, as the story progresses, the details of Sullivan’s horrific childhood–such as growing up in an asylum after being orphaned as a child–and her own battles to overcome near blindness emerge, offering insight into why and what motivates her so strongly. Annie Sullivan is unquestionably the lead, and, again, not for nothing did Gibson title it The Miracle Worker rather than The Helen Keller Story, so the carping about category fraud or category confusion regarding Duke is misleading [use the rubric] though, even among those carpers, I’ve never known anyone to flat-out argue that Duke was necessarily un-deserving in spite of quibbles about screentime; most of the time, it’s not mentioned.\n\nTo Be Continued: Broadway Comes A-Callin’ and Jessica “J.B.” Fletcher\n\nFortunately for Lansbury, Broadway came a-callin’ at just about the right time, and she (re)established herself–flourished, in fact–as a musical theatre powerhouse, forging Broadway credibility in the likes of A Taste of Honey (1960) and Anyone Can Whistle (1964) before earning Tony awards for Mame (1966), Dear World (1969), a sensational 1974 revival of Gypsy (which Lansbury first played in London and a major North American tour), and Sweeney Todd (1979). She proved such a formidable presence that when Yul Brynner took a much needed break from his well-received 1977 revival of The King and I, in a role in which he had been singularly identified both onstage and screen (to the tune of a Best Actor Oscar), producers hired Lansbury to take on the role of Anna (the I in The King and I), in order to guarantee a big name and keep the show going pending Brynner’s return (and for which Lansbury earned a Drama Desk nomination). In the midst of her incredible Broadway streak, Lansbury worked sporadically in movies and TV, mainly Disney’s musical fantasy Bedknobs and Broomsticks [7] and a pair of Agatha Christie outings (including 1978’s aforementioned Death on the Nile, in which she played flamboyant romance novelist Salome Otterbourne, earning Best Supporting Actress honors from the National Board of Review as well as a BAFTA nod [8]), before landing the role that would forever make her a household name, that of Jessica Fletcher, retired high school English teacher who turned to writing mysteries on a lark after her husband of 30 years passed, becoming a best selling author and amateur sleuth, in CBS’s long-running Murder, She Wrote…but that’s a whole other chapter and one well worth pursuing, eventually.\n\nBack to All About Eve. I love the idea of Angela Lansbury slipping into the role of duplicitous Eve and all her machinations. No doubt, she and Bette Davis would have made movie magic, but maybe it’s for the best that things worked out the way they did. Consider that, for all the film’s success, All About Eve proved–aside from her earlier Oscar win–to be the high point of Baxter’s career; never again would she have it so good though she worked steadily in stage, film, and TV for decades [9]. Bette Davis fared better, notching yet another Oscar nomination (her 9th–official–nod [10]) two years later for The Star. Like Baxter, Davis rarely lacked for opportunities during the 195os though she was hardly the draw she’d been in the late 1930s and throughout much of the 1940s, leading up to All About Eve. Sure, she heralded a brazen new niche with 1962’s darkly comic, made-on-the-cheap thriller, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?, earning her final Oscar nod–losing to Bancroft–before segueing to similar ghoulish fare–monster movies in which the “monsters” were effectively humans played at a fevered pitch by veteran screen-actresses of a certain age–most famously 1964’s Hush…Hush, Sweet Charlotte. Once that genre ran its course, Davis found more and better roles on television–while still working in movies albeit less frequently–and earning all kinds of accolades in the process [11], so good for her, but here’s the difference between Lansbury and both Baxter and Davis. In the early 60s, around the time of Whatever Baby Jane‘s premiere, fiftyish Bette Davis cheekily ran an ad in the trade journals, reminding one and all that she was ready and available for work if anyone had doubts about her mobility or affability. The stunt rocked Hollywood insiders yet despite trying to downplay the whole thing as a lark, Davis found herself at a critical juncture in her career (Stine, Davis 311). That part is undeniable. In contrast, in the mid 1970s, as Lansbury eased into her 50s, she reigned as one of Broadway’s biggest draws, and that was in many ways only the beginning as she was on the cusp of turning 60 in 1984 when she began her more than decade long run as the star of one of TV’s biggest shows, her ticket to becoming a household name if she weren’t already.\n\nLansbury always knew she had more skill, more complexity, to offer than what Hollywood’s legendary moguls allotted, so she pushed herself toward reinvention as often as needed in order to keep opportunity alive, never settling for complacency and always stretching her talent to all new heights time and again, with ever an eye on the work itself, a professional through and through and “Wishful Casting” aside, that’s the difference between All About Angela and All About Eve.\n\nThanks for your consideration….\n\nNotes\n\n[1] Only three movies hold such distinction, the other two being Titanic (1997) and La La Land (2016). A few points of further interest include the following. Back in 195o, when black and white films were still more common than not, art-direction, costume design, and cinematography were divided between color films and black and white films, such that B&W films, including All About Eve, only competed against other B&W titles in those three craft areas. All About Eve also snagged an incredible five acting nominations in three categories. Even though All About Eve was the nominations champ in the 1950/51 Oscar race, and even though it won the top two prizes, Best Picture and Best Director, it “only” won in six categories, the other four being Best B&W Costumes, Best Sound Recording, and Best Supporting Actor (George Sanders as acerbic theater columnist Addison DeWitt), as well as the award for the category we now know as Best Adapted Screenplay (Joseph L. Mankiewicz). JMank’s back-to-back Oscars for writing and directing Eve in 1950 and 1949’s A Letter to Three Wives still hold an Academy record.\n\n[2] Per Sam Staggs’s All about All About Eve: The Complete Behind-the-Scenes Story of the Bitchiest Film Ever Made (2000), goddess-y Marlene Dietrich had been discussed early on as a possible Margo and after Colbert withdrew, Dietrich was mentioned again–along with real-life theatrical legend Gertrude Lawrence (61-64).\n\n[3] Charles Le Maire, Fox’s Executive Director of Wardrobe, had already situated costumes for the likes of Baxter, Thelma Ritter, Celeste Holm–as what passes for Margo’s bestie, Karen Richards, wife of playwright Lloyd Richards–and all the rest, yes, including Colbert, when Davis was hired as the latter’s replacement. Davis was thrilled by Margo’s prospects, but her participation came with a few contractual considerations, one being that Edith Head would design her new costumes. Head, the doyenne of Paramount’s costume shop–nicknamed the Dress Doctor and Le Maire’s equivalent on her own turf–rated a surprise choice since she and Davis had almost never collaborated given that the latter had reigned for years at Warners, thus their professional paths had seldom crossed; not never, but rarely. Anyway, the story goes that Le Maire, steadfastly at work on his next project, welcomed Head as it lessened pressure on him; meanwhile, his designs for Colbert were eventually repurposed for other Fox films. When Oscar time came, the two shared the award for All About Eve with Head upstaging herself since she was also nominated for Sunset Blvd. in the same category.\n\n[4] An intriguing if entirely coincidental footnote to this story is that for the purposes of her Gaslight screentest, Lansbury played opposite Hugh Marlowe who also delivered Lansbury’s first screen kiss in the process. Any All About Eve fan knows that Marlowe eventually portrayed playwright Lloyd Richards, yet another target of Eve’s seduction. See what a tale this is turning out to be?\n\n[5] – For these purposes, ages have been “verified” via the Internet Movie Database: Lansbury was born in 1925; Elvis was born in 1935; Warren Beatty’s birth year is listed as 1937, and Laurence Harvey’s is 1928.\n\n[6] – Duke’s fellow winners in the category were Rita Tushingham (A Taste of Honey) and Sue Lyon (Lolita).\n\n[7] – During her long-running MSW gig. Lansbury found time to voice beloved “Mrs. Potts” in Disney’s first ever fully animated Academy Best Picture nominee Beauty and the Beast (1991), singing the Oscar winning title tune as part of the deal and while we’re at it: Lansbury won yet another Tony for her featured role as clairvoyant Madame Arcati in the 2009 revival of Noel Coward’s Blithe Spirit. A year later, she notched another Tony nod for her portrayal of Madame Armfeldt in a revival of Sondheim’s A Little Night Music. She lost that one, but received a Special Lifetime Achievement Tony in 2022; likewise, while a competitive Oscar long eluded Lansbury, she also earned an Honorary Oscar for a lifetime of stellar performances in 2013. (Click each link to see BOTH clips.)\n\n[8] – First, my guess is that Christie’s Otterbourne was at least inspired by real-life novelists Elinor Glyn and E.M. Hull. Next, Lansbury’s other “lesser” Christie outing was 1980’s The Mirror Crack’d, in which she portrayed my favorite Christie sleuth, Miss Jane Marple. In spite of boasting much of the same behind-the-scenes talent as 1974’s Murder on the Orient Express and 1978’s Death on the Nile, both of them star-studded box office hits with Oscar credibility (including Anthony Powell’s award winning costumes for the latter), The Mirror Crack’d, clearly inspired by the tragic story of actress Gene Tierney, registered as more a miscalculation in spite of such marquee names as Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, Tony Curtis, and Kim Novak though Lansbury notched a Saturn nomination for her efforts. [Backing up, Elinor Glyn is referenced slyly among authors whose “smutty” books send shudders up and down the spines of River City’s uptight matrons in Meredith Willson’s The Music Man; the others being Honoré de Balzac, Geoffrey Chaucer, Omar Khayyam, and François Rabelais; I would wager, as well, that E.M. Forster had Elinor Glyn in mind as the model for spirited romance novelist Eleanor Lavish in A Room with a View (played winningly by Judi Dench in the acclaimed 1986 Merchant-Ivory-Jhabvala adaptation). Meanwhile, Glyn’s contemporary Edith Maude Hull is best known for penning the novel The Sheik, later adapted into one of silent star Rudolph Valentino’s biggest hits though Valentino also appeared in adaptations of Glyn’s titles as well.]\n\n[9] In many ways, Baxter often played real-life Eve to Bette’s Margo over time in that when Lauren Bacall departed her Tony winning role as Margo in the Broadway cast of Applause, the early 1970s Comden-Green-Strouse-Adams musical based on All About Eve, in order to headline the show’s national tour, Baxter stepped into the role for the better part of a year. Talk about déjà vu, that one hits close to home; moreover, in the early 1980s when ongoing health concerns forced Davis into forgoing the key role as the proprietor in the TV adaptation of Arthur Hailey’s Hotel–after the pilot had been filmed–Baxter filled-in, yet again, as the sister-in-law of Davis’s character, owning a stake in said hotel, and leaving Davis’s character to be referenced occasionally though otherwise out of the picture. Even so, Baxter passed during the course of the show’s five year span (1983-1988), suffering a fatal stroke in 1986 at the age of 62. Davis outlived both Baxter and the TV show, passing in 1989 at the age of 81.\n\n[10] – Long story, worth its own piece, but many sources now include Davis’s write-in nomination for her otherwise un-nominated turn as “slatternly” Mildred in 1934’s Of Human Bondage, the breakthrough role that made critics and audiences take note. Likely the victim of studio politics, a danger when a performer was “loaned out” from one studio to another, Davis was widely speculated to be a certain Academy nominee, the outcry so strong when she wasn’t nominated that the Academy allowed write-in votes. Per multiple reports, Davis logged enough votes to rank higher in the final tally than at least one of the official nominees. Even the Academy’s database lists the write-in vote among that year’s nominees though elsewhere in the same database the write-in vote is either ignored or qualified. Officially, Bette logged 10 nods (a record in 1963); 11 if one counts Of Human Bondage.\n\n[11] – For example, Davis won an Emmy for her leading role–opposite no less than Gena Rowlands–in 1979’s Strangers: The Story of a Mother and Daughter, one of a handful of projects that snagged Emmy consideration for the actress. Her last great film role was in 1987’s The Whales of August, opposite Lillian Gish, another screen-legend, as widowed elderly sisters spending their summer in a Maine seaside community, surrounded by the likes of aging ladies man Vincent Price and lifelong pal Ann Sothern, another prolific movie and TV vet from Hollywood’s glory days who notched her sole Oscar nod in the supporting category for her amusingly entertaining performance though enthusiastic reviews for the leads put Davis and Gish back in circulation on talk shows and magazine features. [As a sidebar to this Whales of August footnote, in a sepia-toned prologue set during the women’s younger days, Davis’s Libby is portrayed by Margaret Ladd, known at the time for playing the more emotionally vulnerable of star Jane Wyman’s two daughters in TV’s long-running nighttime serial Falcon Crest; Gish’s Sarah is acted by one-time Oscar winner Mary Steenburgen (Best Supporting Actress for 1980’s Melvin and Howard) while Tisha Sterling, an actress in her outright besides being Sothern’s daughter, took on the role of Sothern’s younger self. Clearly, Sterling’s casting is spot-on, but Steenburgen and Ladd are visually on-target, too.]\n\n[12] – That noted, it still bears repeating that Davis’s strongest competition that year seemingly came not from Baxter but from Gloria Swanson, herself enjoying a thrilling comeback as Norma Desmond, a once wildly popular–fictional–silent screen queen who seduces a caddish young screenwriter in hopes of embarking on, well, a comeback, in Billy Wilder’s sensational–and, in the right frame of mind, darkly comic–Sunset Boulevard, one of 1950’s strongest Oscar candidates. Even if Baxter hadn’t been in the picture, Swanson loomed as a favorite though, sure, splitting votes with Baxter was never the way to win though, tellingly, all three actresses–along with the great Eleanor Parker in Caged–were bested in the final tally by Judy Holliday, wowing audiences in the stage-to-screen adaptation of her big Broadway hit, Born Yesterday.\n\nSources\n\nPeary, Danny.
