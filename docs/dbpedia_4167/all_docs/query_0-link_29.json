        "text": "Tag: Robert Benchley\n\nFarewell to 1934\n\nAbove: Ringing in the New Year at Times Square, 1934.\n\nWe bid adieu to 1934 with some odds and ends, beginning with E.B. White’s observations for the upcoming year, which if anyone had noticed the uptick in Ascot tie purchases, just might be a bit rosier than previous years of the decade.\n\nWhite was also hopeful for a new year with a less dreadful press, particularly the pandering type promulgated by William Randolph Hearst.\n\n* * *\n\nDr. Peeper\n\n“The Talk of the Town” noted that Dr. Allan Dafoe, the country doctor who gained fame for delivering the Dionne Quintuplets, expressed a desire to see Sally Rand perform her bubble dance during his visit to Gotham. “Talk” also looked in on the some of the technical aspects of the burlesque dancer’s signature act:\n\n* * *\n\nLeading Ladies\n\nFilm Critic John Mosher noted the continued rise of two leading female stars, twenty-seven-year-old Katharine Hepburn and six-year-old Shirley Temple. Mosher recalled Hepburn’s recent performance in Little Women, and proclaimed that she “succeeds again” in The Little Minister.\n\nAlthough Mosher admitted he was a “disagreeable adult” who doesn’t enjoy seeing children on the screen “more than necessary,” he acknowledged Shirley Temple’s talents as well as those of child actor Jane Withers in Bright Eyes.\n\n* * *\n\nThat Youthful Feeling\n\nGiven that William Shakespeare’s star-crossed lovers Romeo and Juliet were mere teenagers (the ages 13 and 16 were given to Juliet and Romeo, respectively), many productions featured actors more than twice that age. That was the case in 1933 when the play was revived by actress Katharine Cornell and her director husband Guthrie McClintic, who took the play on a seven-month nationwide tour before it was revised and opened on Broadway in December 1934. Critics dubbed the 41-year-old Cornell “the greatest Juliet of her time,” and it seems Robert Benchley heartily agreed in this excerpt from his stage review:\n\n* * *\n\nThe New Yorkiest Place\n\nIn 1930 gossip columnist Walter Winchell called the new Stork Club “New York’s New Yorkiest place on W. 58th,” and when it relocated to 3 East 53rd Street in 1934 it further defined itself as the ultimate New York night club. In her “Tables for Two” column, Lois Long found the new location much to her liking. An excerpt:\n\n* * *\n\nSo Long?\n\nClarence Day, best known for his Life with Father stories, also contributed a number of cartoons to the magazine, accompanied by satirical poems and humorous shorts. Day would die at the tender age of 61—after a bout with pneumonia—in December 1935, about a year after this cartoon was published in The New Yorker. I assume he was signing off from the magazine in order to arrange publication of his Life with Father book, which was published shortly after his death.\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nSunny California beckoned those who had the means and leisure to head to warmer climes during the New York winter…\n\n…for those who stayed behind, they could wrap themselves in a chic winter coat such as this one sported by Camel endorser Mrs. Langdon Post (Janet Kirby)…\n\n…another colorful ad with a not-so-colorful message from World Peaceways, a 1930s anti-war organization that characterized soldiers (and future soldiers, seen here) as pawns in the corrupt games of the rich and powerful…\n\n…the distributors of French champagne rang in the New Year by suggesting that Doyen was worth your very last cent…\n\n…we kick off our cartoons by welcoming the New Year with George Price…\n\n…Robert Day contributed a spot drawing that offered a new twist to ice hockey…\n\n…I should know this artist, but it escapes me for the moment…nevertheless, a great illustration to stretch across the bottom of an opening page…\n\n…a closeup of the signature…\n\n…another from George Price, still up in the air in the final issue of 1934…\n\n…Garner Rea introduced us to the life of the party…\n\n…”Miss Otis Regrets” is a 1934 Cole Porter song about the lynching of a society woman after she murders her unfaithful lover. Porter wrote the song as a parody of a sad cowboy song he heard on the radio. The song was further workshopped for fun at “smart set” cocktail parties…on to our next cartoon, and a moment of keen insight from James Thurber…\n\n…Garrett Price went on the town with some students of anatomy…\n\n…and we say Happy New Year with the help of Helen Hokinson…\n\nNext Time: Easy Riders…\n\nA Light in Darkness\n\nAbove: For this Hollywood-heavy post we feature stars of the 1930s—the two Joans, Joan Blondell (left) and Joan Crawford, marking the Fourth of July holiday.\n\nThe New Yorker marked the Fourth of July with this William Steig cover featuring a patriotic “strap” along the binding and one of his precocious “Small Fry”…\n\nWe’ve been looking at ways New Yorkers kept their cool in the hot summer of 1934, and one way to beat the heat was to escape into the air-conditioned darkness of a movie theater. It was not uncommon for folks to remain seated after the credits rolled and watch the feature all over again, just enjoy some cold comfort.\n\nFilm critic John Mosher no doubt enjoyed this particular perk, and perhaps this made him a bit more agreeable to whatever was playing on the big screen, including three rather dull pictures featuring actresses Marion Davies, Kay Francis and Elissa Landi.\n\nMarion Davies (1897–1961) was the veteran of the group, beginning her film career in 1917 and appearing in thirty silent films before breaking into sound movies. Sadly, her talents as an actress and comedian were overshadowed by her reputation as William Randolph Hearst’s mistress. Known for her aristocratic bearing, Austrian-American actress Elissa Landi (1904–1948) appeared in several British silents and on Broadway before signing with Fox Films in 1931. Kay Francis (1905–1968) began her film career with the advent of sound movies in 1929. A major box-office draw for Warner Brothers, by 1935 Francis was one of Hollywood’s highest-paid actors (she was also a former roommate and longtime friend of The New Yorker’s Lois Long).\n\nPerhaps one of the more notorious examples of a white actor in blackface, Operator 13 featured Davies as a Union spy who poses as a Black maid to infiltrate a Confederate camp…\n\n* * *\n\nSentimental Journey\n\nAnother critic enjoying the cool of the theater was Robert Benchley, who used this break in the Broadway season to reveal his passions regarding a number of stage actresses. An excerpt:\n\n* * *\n\nA Poke at Palooka\n\nIn his column “Of All Things,” Howard Brubaker took a shot below the belt at the new heavyweight boxing champ, Max Baer.\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nIt was hot outside, folks were cooling off with their favorite beverages, and advertisers responded in kind…we begin with a familiar green bottle, and with apologies to Max Baer, you didn’t need to know how to read to know this was a bottle of Perrier…\n\n…if your taste was more on the domestic side, there was White Rock…\n\n…a series of Hoffman Club Soda ads sought to convince consumers about their superior carbonation…\n\n…or how about a brandy, perhaps lightly chilled, especially if it’s late in the evening, and you happen to be sitting on a breezy hotel rooftop…\n\n…or you could cool down with a Lion beer…considered a heritage brewery, Lion Brewery is one of only ten pre-Prohibition breweries that has independently and continuously operated since the repeal of Prohibition…\n\n…a fairly new brand of cigarettes, Marlboro, was still taking out these bargain-sized ads to build brand recognition…Flit insecticide, on the other hand, was well-known thanks to these ubiquitous Dr. Seuss ads…\n\n…the folks at General Tire & Rubber were the latest advertiser to tie their product to the glamour of aviation…\n\n…and on to our cartoons, we begin with another installment of native birds via Rea Irvin…\n\n…Al Frueh chimed in with this three-panel encounter at a nudist colony…\n\n…Robert Day presented a case of indigestion…\n\n…Garrett Price welcomed us aboard a dream cruise…\n\n…George Price gave us this gem in the “Goings On About Town” section,,,\n\n…Gardner Rea gave us his spare line to illustrate an enormous space…one of his specialties…\n\n…Gilbert Bundy marked the Fourth with an entitled jaywalker…\n\n…and we close with Mary Petty, and a banker’s contentment…\n\nNext Time: London Calling…\n\nRing Ding\n\nBack in the days before we had a zillion different entertainment options, almost anyone with a pair of ears would tune in to hear the radio broadcast of a heavyweight title fight.\n\nJack Dempsey and Gene Tunney dominated the late 1920s, while Joe Louis, Max Schmeling and Jack Sharkey were marquee names in the 1930s along with Max Baer and Primo Carnera, who met on June 14, 1934 at the outdoor Madison Square Garden Bowl in Long Island City. The reigning champ Carnera (1906–1967), who stood six-and-a-half feet tall and weighed in at 260 pounds, had won more fights by knockout than any other heavyweight champion. But Baer (1909–1959) was known as a knockout puncher who beat one opponent so savagely that he died the following day.\n\nBaer was also something of a showboater, a quality Morris Markey found distasteful when he wrote about the Baer–Carnera bout in “A Reporter at Large.”\n\nMarkey further explained why Baer’s behavior in the ring was so bothersome, and how it differed from the comic antics of other famous athletes:\n\nComplications from diabetes would take Carnera down for good at age 60. Baer would die even younger, from a heart attack, at age 50. His last words reportedly were, “Oh God, here I go.” Baer’s son, actor and director Max Baer Jr. (best known as Jethro Bodine from TV’s The Beverly Hillbillies) is still with us, at age 85.\n\nWe aren’t quite finished with the Baer–Carnera fight…E.B. White led his “Notes and Comment” with this observation regarding the fight’s mass appeal and seeming universality:\n\n* * *\n\nApologies to Ms. Winslow\n\nI seem to have given short shrift to author Thyra Samter Winslow (1886–1961) who published more than 200 stories during her career in magazines such as The Smart Set and The American Mercury. She published more than thirty in The New Yorker, from 1927 to 1942, including the serialization of her short story collection, My Own, My Native Land. The story “Poodles” was featured in the June 23 issue.\n\nAccording to the Encyclopedia of Arkansas, Winslow’s early life in Fort Smith (Ark.) “provided background for her view of small towns as prejudiced, hypocritical, and suffocating places…many stories expose the hypocrisy, prejudice, and carefully maintained social structures of both small town and urban life. She was particularly adept at portraying women of every social class, often in an unfavorable light. Money, especially the pursuit of it as a means to happiness or status, is an important theme throughout her work.”\n\n* * *\n\nHot Enough For Ya?\n\nSo what did New Yorkers do when the summer heat set in? The next few items offer some clues, beginning with this poem by E.B. White:\n\nYou could also take in some entertainment while enjoying the cooling breezes of the Hudson River. Robert Benchley hopped aboard the Alexander Hamilton to enjoy Bobby Sanford’s showboat revue:\n\n“Tables for Two” took a look at summer dining options, from sidewalk cafes to hotel rooftops featuring dinner and dancing—this “Tables” was not written by Lois Long, but by Margaret Case Harriman, who knew a thing or two about nightlife (she was the daughter of the Hotel Algonquin’s owner, Frank Case)…\n\n* * *\n\nGet Yourself to Chi-Town\n\nThe Chicago World’s Fair (The Century of Progress) was in its second and final year, and The New Yorker found everything “terrific.” Excerpt:\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nJust a couple of entries this week…You could take a plane to the Chicago World’s Fair on a United Airlines Boeing 247…\n\n…the lower section of the ad claimed you could fly to Chicago in about five hours in planes featuring “Two pilots…stewardess…two-way radio…directive radio beam”…\n\n…and what would our advertising section be without two fashionable people lighting up?…\n\n…on to our cartoonists, we begin with Reginald Marsh’s illustration of a Rep Theatre production…\n\n…Otto Soglow’s Little King found his artistic side…\n\n…Rea Irvin continued his examination of native fauna…\n\n…Gardner Rea correctly predicted the global domination of Mickey Mouse…\n\n…Peter Arno showed the dizzying effects of a Coney Island ride…\n\n…however at the altar the thrill was gone, per Garrett Price…\n\n…another take on the ways of love, with Barbara Shermund...\n\n…the newfangled diagonal bathtub continued to dazzle, with George Price…\n\n…Gardner Rea offered up some subtle irony on the farm…\n\n…and we close with James Thurber, in a poetic moment…\n\nNext Time: A Light in Darkness…\n\nThe Power Broker\n\nAbove: Robert Moses in 1939 with a model of his proposed Battery Bridge Park Reconstruction; at right, 1934 Bryant Park renovation, view to the south on 6th Avenue from 42nd Street. (Wikipedia/NYC Parks Department)\n\nThe title for this entry comes from Robert Caro’s landmark 1974 biography of Robert Moses, The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York, which questioned the benefit of Moses’s monumental projects.\n\nLike him or not, few unelected officials have wielded more power than Moses, who through various appointed positions, including New York City Parks Commissioner, he was able to impose his will on mayors, legislators, congressmen, wealthy burghers, and even, on occasion, The White House. In turn he imposed his will on the city itself, clearing whole neighborhoods to lay down new roads that extended from Manhattan to the tip of Long Island, where neither farmer nor landed gentry could stand in his way. A profile written by Milton MacKaye examined what made Moses tick. An excerpt:\n\nIn another excerpt, MacKaye noted that Moses had been named a member of the Triborough Bridge Authority; Moses would ultimately become chairman, and through this position would possess enormous, unchecked power and influence. Moses was skilled at creating legal structures that would favor his ambitions, burying language into legislative bills and other documents that would make him impervious to influence from mayors, legislators, governors and other elected officials.\n\nFinal note, I highly recommend Caro’s The Power Broker—it’s a doorstop of a book, but also one of the best biographies of the 20th century and a must-read for anyone who wishes to understand how present-day New York came to be, and how it really works.\n\n* * *\n\nLet’s Talk About the Weather\n\nRobert Benchley, writing under the pseudonym Guy Fawkes, took a turn at “The Wayward Press” column, commenting on the sensationalistic coverage of the weather by the local press. In all fairness to the press, New York City had endured a blizzard as well as the coldest temperature ever recorded for the city: 15 below zero (Fahrenheit) on Feb. 9, 1934. (According to newspaper accounts, it was 14.3 below).\n\nBenchley also commented on journalist Ernest Gruening (1887–1974), who was the editor of the New York Post for only four months in 1934, but during those four months he really shook things up.\n\nRobert Benchley thought the press made too much of the city’s snowy weather, but these newsreels tell a different story:\n\n* * *\n\nPunch Drunk\n\nCritic John Mosher found slim pickings at the local movie houses, opting for Jimmy Durante’s Palooka as the best of crop:\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nWe start with a couple ads from the back pages…the promoters of Chicago’s famed Stevens Hotel offered a unique perspective as they appealed to New Yorkers to come check out the “Century of Progress” World’s Fair, which proved so popular that it planned to reopen in May for a second year…at right, The Gotham catered to the ladies with a special cocktail bar that only allowed men in the company of a woman…\n\n…cigarette manufacturers continued to work on their biggest growth market with ads like this one from the Lorillard Tobacco Company…here a perceptive woman chooses to ignore the “brazen claims” of other tobacco companies and makes an informed decision to inhale an Old Gold…\n\n…Liggett & Myers, on the other hand, stuck with this subservient pose, suggesting both are happy with their cigarette, and their station in life…\n\n…another colorful ad from the makers of Schlitz beer…following the end of Prohibition Schlitz quickly became the world’s top-selling brewery, a position it would hold into the 1960s until it switched to cheaper brewing methods…\n\n…the makers of Fisher car bodies (owned by General Motors) continued their lavish two-page spreads touting the homey comforts of their interiors…\n\n…and no more staid ads from luxury carmaker Packard, who ran this full-color, full-bleed spot…\n\n…it’s almost springtime for Hitler, and Germany welcomed American tourists with promises of “Dreaming Villages” (whatever those are), charming health spas and places of romance and beauty…hmmm, no mention of swastika flags hanging from every building, or parades of goose-stepping thugs…\n\n…this public service ad promoted the effectiveness of the National Recovery Act, offering the uptick in underwear sales as a sure sign of economic growth…\n\n…on to our cartoonists, we begin with Helen Hokinson experiencing the results of the recent blizzard…\n\n…as did Henry Anton, with a befuddled meteorologist…\n\n…Alain (Daniel Brustlein) gave us this wordless gem…\n\n…while Garrett Price presented a sculptor’s greatest challenge…\n\n…Alan Dunn gave us two women who expected more pizzazz from a recent funeral…\n\n…Peter Arno contended with some Peeping Toms…\n\n…and James Thurber looked in on recent maneuvers in his war between the sexes…\n\nNext Time: Art of the Machine…\n\nA Joycean Odyssey\n\nAbove, James Joyce and his longtime partner Nora Barnacle, in Zurich, 1930. They would marry the following year when Joyce established residency in the UK. (SUNY Buffalo)\n\nIt began 103 years ago when the American literary magazine The Little Review published its latest installment of James Joyce’s landmark novel Ulysses—a chapter that featured an account of a wanker on a beach.\n\nMore specifically, the passage described the novel’s main character, Leopold Bloom, pleasuring himself while gazing at a teenage girl. It didn’t take long for the pearl-clutchers at the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice to go after the editors of The Little Review, who were ultimately fined for obscenity and banned from publishing the remainder of the novel, which, by the way, Joyce had structured along the lines of Homer’s epic poem, the Odyssey.\n\nScenes in the novel that frankly described sexual acts and mocked rituals of the Catholic Church kept the book off American shelves until 1934, when District Judge John M. Woolsey ruled that the book was neither pornographic nor obscene. One wonders if Judge Woolsey took a cue from the end of Prohibition.\n\nLovers of literature, including New Yorker book reviewer Clifton Fadiman, rejoiced at the judge’s decision. We skip ahead to the Jan. 27 issue for Fadiman’s thoughts on the matter:\n\n* * *\n\nPleasurable Diversion\n\nWe now turn to the Jan. 20 issue, in which Robert Benchley concluded his stage reviews with a generous nod to his dear friend and colleague, Dorothy Parker, whose short stories were being performed as sketches at the Barbizon-Plaza Hotel, the first fully-equipped music and arts residential center in the U.S.\n\n* * *\n\nUne Séduction Américaine\n\nJanet Flanner began writing her weekly New Yorker column “Letter from Paris” in September 1925, keeping readers informed on a variety of subjects ranging from arts and culture to politics and crime. In the Jan. 20 issue she introduced readers to French actor Charles Boyer (1899–1978), who was preparing to try his luck in Hollywood. Actually, Boyer made his first trip to Tinseltown in 1930, but his return would mark the beginning of a successful run in American cinema, including the 1944 mystery-thriller Gaslight and the 1967 romantic-comedy Barefoot in the Park.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Way Of All Flesh\n\nLois Long continued to chronicle New York nightlife in her “Tables for Two” column, exuding “rapture” over the new theatre/restaurant Casino de Paree, which featured ample nudity as well as top performers dancer Bill “Bojangles” Robinson and comedienne Sheila Barrett.\n\nThe Casino de Paree featured revues, dancing, and side shows such as fire-eaters and animal acts. It closed in 1937, and the building later became home to the trendy 80s–90’s hot spot Studio 54.\n\nThe Casino de Paree’s menu gave patrons some idea of what could be expected on the stage…\n\n…but if food and drink was the only thing on your mind, you could enjoy lobster thermidor for a buck seventy-five…\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nHow reliable were Goodyear’s tires? Hopefully more reliable than this adage, which Abraham Lincoln apparently never uttered…\n\n…major exhibitions at the Grand Central Palace changed like the seasons, the National Automobile Show ceding to the National Motor Boat & Engine Show…\n\n…if you’d rather have someone else do the sailing, the Bermuda line could take you on a round-trip cruise for as little as $60…\n\n…with the end of Prohibition, the folks at White Rock were doubtless pleased to overtly advertise their product as a cocktail mixer…\n\n…on to our cartoonists, Al Frueh contributed this rendering for the theatre review section…\n\n…Daniel ‘Alain’ Brustlein found this salon conversation a bit Mickey Mouse…\n\n…Helen Hokinson explored the results of family planning…\n\n…E. Simms Campbell gave us an unlikely den of thieves…\n\n…Gilbert Bundy had us wondering what ensued at this gentlemen’s club…\n\n…and James Thurber fired the first shot in The War Between Men And Women…\n\n…on to Jan. 27, 1934…\n\n…where writer W.E. Woodward profiled Sinclair Lewis (1885-1951), whose manner had changed noticeably after receiving the Nobel Prize. An excerpt (with caricature by Al Frueh):\n\n* * *\n\nMore From Our Advertisers\n\nWe begin with this lovely color illustration by Helen Hokinson, which also graced the cover of the January 1934 issue of The Stage…\n\n…the vintners at Moët & Chandon let New Yorkers know that their fine Champagne could be had from sole distributors Labourdette and Company…\n\n…cultural critic Gilbert Seldes advised drinkers to abandon their degraded ways and return to the civilized consumption of an old favorite…\n\n…while the folks at Guinness reminded us of their product’s deep history as well as its health benefits…\n\n…and for the teetotalers the purveyors of Joyz Maté encouraged Yankees to take up this “strange” South American drink…the ad claimed it “fortifies the body against fatigue” (thanks to the generous amount of caffeine) and acts as a “corrective and a balancer” (it helped stimulate bowel movements)…\n\n…on to our cartoons, we begin with Gardner Rea, borrowing from a running gag in the Marx Brothers’ 1930 film Animal Crackers, which featured Harpo chasing a sexy blonde around a mansion (apologies for the poor reproduction quality—the archival image was quite faint)…\n\n…Gilbert Bundy gave us a couple confronting the subtleties of Times Square…\n\n…Robert Day commented on the latest trend in taxicab conveniences: coin-operated radios for passengers…\n\n…this two-page Little King cartoon by Otto Soglow revealed another side to our diminutive potentate…\n\n…and the war between the sexes raged on, with James Thurber…\n\nNext Time: Under the Knife…\n\nA Poke At Punch\n\nIn 1925 New Yorker founding editor Harold Ross wrote that he wanted his new magazine to be “humorous from a sophisticated viewpoint” and “record the situations of everyday life among intelligent and substantial people as do the English magazines, notably Punch, except that our bent is more satirical, sharper.”\n\nSharper indeed, as was demonstrated in the Jan. 13, 1934 issue, when Ross’s young magazine took aim at Punch, which was founded in 1841 and had grown long in the tooth under the guidance of Sir Owen Seaman, whose Victorian sensibilities (he joined Punch in 1897) were ripe for parody by a magazine founded during the Jazz Age.\n\nWriter and cartoonist V. Cullum Rogers (MagazineParody.com) notes that the eight pages devoted to “Paunch” was The New Yorker’s longest and most elaborate parody of another publication.\n\nE.B. White and Franklin P. Adams contributed parodies (“The Mall” by White and “The Intent Caterpillar” by Franklin) of what Rogers cites as “two of Punch’s favorite forms of bad verse: the sticky-sentimental and the mechanically clever.”\n\nThe New Yorker’s theatre critic Wolcott Gibbs joined the fun by penning “Mr. Paunch’s Cinema Review” (excerpt)…\n\n…Rea Irvin and James Thurber offered up their cartooning skills…\n\n…and Robert Benchley contributed this gem, “Hyacinths for Pamela.”\n\nRogers writes that although “Paunch” wasn’t promoted on the cover, “the issue it ran in became the first in The New Yorker’s nine-year history to sell out on newsstands. (The second sellout contained Wolcott Gibbs’s Time parody, which suggests a demand for such things).”\n\nThe parody issue concluded with this page of advertisements:\n\n* * *\n\nThe Show Must Go On\n\nThe death of Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. in 1932 did not put an end to his Follies; indeed, under the direction of his widow, Billie Burke, the show seemed to have new legs, at least according to Robert Benchley:\n\n* * *\n\nKeen on the Airflow\n\nThe streamlining trend in autos was not to E.B. White’s liking (see below), but the reviewer of the National Auto Show (pseud. “Speed”) was eager to take the Chrysler Airflow for a spin.\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nThe Chrysler Corporation ran this two-page ad that took issue with E.B. White’s criticisms of the streamlining trend in automobiles, led by Chrysler’s “Airflow” model…here Chrysler responded with a note pinned to a tear sheet from the Dec. 16, 1933 “Talk of the Town”…You wrote this before you saw the new Chryslers, Mr. New Yorker…\n\n…with the National Auto Show still in town the splashy car ads continued, including this one from the makers of Fisher car bodies…\n\n…another advertising stalwart, the Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company, gave us a young woman who enjoyed their Chesterfields “a lot”…\n\n…Guinness was back for those who missed that taste of Dublin…\n\n…and the folks behind “The Beer That Made Milwaukee Famous” placed their first ad in The New Yorker…\n\n…if you wanted to have your drink outside of the home, what better place than the Madison Room at The Biltmore…\n\n…on to our cartoons, with begin with Perry Barlow and a tot losing sleep over the new year…\n\n…Kemp Starrett also explored the world of sleep deprivation…\n\n…and we end with James Thurber, and a woman with a low tolerance for “cute” news…\n\n…in case you are wondering, Anna Eleanor “Sistie” Dall was the daughter of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt’s eldest child Anna Dall. When Dall separated from her husband in 1933, she moved into the White House with her children, Sistie and Buzzie.\n\nNext Time: A Joycean Odyssey…\n\nAmerica’s Love Affair\n\nNew York’s first big event of the new year was the annual National Auto Show centered at the Grand Central Palace.\n\nThe year 1934 was all about aerodynamic design, with Chrysler leading the way with its ill-fated Airflow, a bit too ahead of its time. Other companies followed suit in more subtle ways, especially smaller manufacturers looking for novel ways to grab a cut of market share.\n\nThe trend in streamlining was inspired by such designers as Norman Bel Geddes, R. Buckminster Fuller and John Tjaarda…\n\nChrysler pulled out all stops to promote its radical new design at the National Auto Show, even producing a special seven-page newspaper, Chrysler News, to promote the car’s many wonders…\n\n…the inside pages featured The New Yorker’s Alexander Woollcott marveling over the Airflow’s design (at the time Woollcott was a Chrysler pitchman).\n\nAlthough other manufacturers didn’t go as far as Chrysler, the streamlining trend was seen in slanting radiators and sweeping fenders.\n\nThe review also noted the novel way Pierce-Arrow sound-insulated their motorcars:\n\n* * *\n\nWearing the Pants\n\nIn 1934 it was still something of a scandal for a woman to wear trousers. Like Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo was an actress who could and would defy gender boundaries, and in Queen Christina she effortlessly portrayed the Swedish queen, who in real life was given an education and responsibilities expected of a male heir and often dressed as a man. The film was a critical success, although John Mosher felt Garbo overwhelmed the movie.\n\n* * *\n\nShe Also Wore Pants\n\nKatharine Hepburn quickly took Hollywood by storm, earning her first Oscar at age 26 for her performance in 1933’s Morning Glory. However, New Yorker drama critic Robert Benchley didn’t see that talent necessarily translating to the Broadway stage, at least not in The Lake:\n\nBenchley correctly surmised that the play’s producer, Jed Harris, was trading on the young star’s “meteoric” film success, but Hepburn’s beauty and intelligence were not enough to save this critical flop, which closed after 55 performances.\n\n* * *\n\nOn the Town\n\nThe chronicler of New York fashion and nightlife, Lois Long, detested Prohibition but after repeal also missed the intimacy of speakeasy life. In her latest “Tables for Two” column Long seemed to be settling into a routine and finding new favorites, like the Waldorf’s Sert Room and Peppy de Albrew’s Chapeau Rouge.\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nThanks to the auto show The New Yorker was raking in a lot of advertising dollars on top of the steady income from tobacco companies and the new infusion of revenue from purveyors of adult beverages…Lucky Strike grabbed the back cover for this striking ad…\n\n…and contrary to the wisdom of the ages, American speed skater Irving Jaffee (who won two gold medals at the 1932 Winter Olympics) credited his athletic prowess in part to smoking unfiltered cigarettes…\n\n…finally, real French Champagne was arriving on American shores…\n\n…as was authentic Scotch whisky…\n\n…John Hanrahan was The New Yorker’s policy counsel from 1925 to 1938 and is credited with putting the magazine on firm financial footing during its infancy…in 1931 Hanrahan rebranded the Theatre Guild’s magazine, renaming it The Stage and filling it with the same splashy ads he was also able to bring to The New Yorker…the Depression was a tough time to launch a magazine, and even though Hanrahan added articles on motion pictures and other forms of entertainment in 1935, the magazine folded in 1939…\n\n…and with the National Auto Show in town, car manufacturers filled The New Yorker’s pages with expensive ads…we’ll start with Walter Chrysler’s long-winded appeal on behalf of the Airflow…\n\n…the folks at the usually staid Packard tossed in some unexpected color…\n\n…Pierce-Arrow, at the time America’s top luxury car, offered this sneak peak of its 1934 Silver Arrow…\n\n…Cadillac bought this spread to announce both its luxury and down-market brands…\n\n…Hudson Motor Car Company invested in three color pages to announce the rollout of their 1934 Hudson 8…\n\n…and their low-priced yet powerful Terraplane…\n\n…Fisher, which made car bodies for General Motors, offered up this color photo of a pretty aviatrix to suggest their interiors were as fresh and clean as the clear skies above…\n\n…Studebaker also paired flying with their latest models…\n\n…Nash employed cartoonist Wayne Colvin for a series of six ads sprinkled across the back pages…here are two examples…\n\n…on to our cartoonists, Perry Barlow used the auto show as inspiration for this cartoon, which appeared along with the review…\n\n…Al Frueh drew up these images for the theatre section…I believe this is the first appearance of Bob Hope in the magazine…\n\n…some housekeeping…I accidentally included this James Thurber cartoon and…\n\n…this Rea Irvin cartoon in my post for the Dec. 30, 1933 issue…they belong with the Jan. 6 issue…\n\n…Robert Day offered up a roving reporter…\n\n…Carl Rose looked in on a wine connoisseur…\n\n…and we close with a steamy image, courtesy Alan Dunn…\n\nNext Time: A Poke at Punch…\n\nHeadline News\n\nThe news of the day in May 1933 included a visit to the U.S. by Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw, a controversial Diego Rivera mural at Rockefeller Center, the abandonment of the Gold Standard, and the continuing saga of legal beer.\n\nWriting under the pseudonym “Guy Fawkes,” Robert Benchley opined on the state of the print media in “The Wayward Press”…an excerpt:\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\n…more ads from the back pages touting various libations including Trommer’s “White Label” beer, a drink made from conch juice called “Konktail,” and an ad illustrated by William Steig promoting “imitation gin and other flavors” made by Red Lion…none of these products exist today…\n\n…however you can still buy canned spaghetti, if that is your thing, but not “Force” breakfast cereal…\n\n…still more selections from the back pages…on the left, an ad for Pear’s Soap that introduced us to “wise parents” whose children “are well-bred—the ‘nice people’ of tomorrow”…on the right, the lifeless gaze of a woman who pondered how life could be better in Tudor City…and in the middle, an unlikely one-column ad from luxury car maker Pierce Arrow…the automaker was America’s answer to Rolls Royce, but the Depression would take it down by 1938…\n\n…I’m guessing the Velveeta is the mild one…\n\n…technology was transforming beachwear, including this “Swagger Boy” outfit spun from Dupont’s latest synthetic, Acele…\n\n…B. Altman, on the other hand, went full-color to promote their exclusive, imported fabric under the trade name Meadowbrook…\n\n…and who ever thought a tire could look so posh, here dominating a gathering of the smart set…\n\n…and look at this swell, sporting top hat and walking stick, but he also knows a good value when it comes to his tires…\n\n…we move on to our cartoons with James Thurber and a lot of people apparently going nowhere…\n\n…Helen Hokinson’s girls were all ears at the latest club gathering…\n\n…Otto Soglow’s Little King got in on the excitement of legal beer…\n\n…and we continue to the issue of May 20, 1933, with a cover by Arnold Hall, who did at least eight covers for The New Yorker during the 1930s…\n\nThe big news in this issue was Mexican artist Diego Rivera and his controversial mural at Rockefeller Center. Rivera’s New Yorker profile was written by Geoffrey Hellman (1907–1977), who beginning in 1929 served as the magazine’s principal writer for “The Talk of the Town.” Here’s an excerpt, with illustration by Al Frueh:\n\nWhat got Rivera in hot water with John D. Rockefeller Jr. and family was a mural that departed somewhat from the artist’s earlier study sketches—Rivera had been hired to depict “man at the crossroads,” looking to the future with uncertainty but also with hope for a better world.\n\nAccording to a 2014 story by NPR’s Allison Keyes, leftist organizations and various communist groups in New York criticized Rivera for agreeing to work with capitalist paragons like the Rockefellers. In response, Rivera sent assistants to find a picture of Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin. “If you want communism, I will paint communism,” he apparently said.\n\nThe subsequent inclusion of Lenin in the mural led to protests by the Rockefeller family, the press and the public. Rivera was ultimately asked to leave the country, losing yet another commission for the Chicago World’s Fair. Rivera got paid for his Rockefeller Center mural, but the work itself was demolished.\n\nAfter returning to Mexico Rivera recreated the mural, adding some vengeful references (see below) to his 1934 work, Man, Controller of the Universe.\n\nRivera’s wife, Frida Kahlo, had accompanied him to New York, and during their time in the states (1930-34) she produced a number of now-famous paintings. However in 1933 she was not recognized as a serious artist. Indeed when she visited with the Detroit News in 1932, the headline read, “Wife of the Master Mural Painter Gleefully Dabbles in Works of Art.” In the same vein, Hellman perceived Kahlo as nothing more than a pretty helpmeet.\n\nRivera’s Rockefeller Center mural was eventually replaced in 1937 by American Progress, painted by the Spanish artist José Maria Sert:\n\nThe irony of the Rivera controversy was not lost on E.B. White, who offered this ballad in response:\n\n* * *\n\nKeep it in Your Pocket\n\nE.B. White again, this time opening his column with thoughts on the anti-Hitler parade that was held in New York.\n\nWhite refers to his “swastika watchfob”…before the Nazis came to power, the swastika was known to many cultures as a symbol of prosperity and good luck.\n\nIn his weekly column Howard Brubaker added this observation regarding life in Nazi Germany…\n\nBack home, folks could still enjoy a taste of Germany that wasn’t associated with violence and hate…an excerpt from “The Talk of the Town”…\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nThe architecture profession fell on hard times during the Depression. In 1931 the Architects’ Emergency Committee began promoting the talents of unemployed architects who were willing to work for less than half their ordinary fee, limiting charges to materials, a small amount of cash, and a place to sleep…this is an example of a series of ads that ran in The New Yorker in the spring of 1933…\n\n…one profession not feeling the hard times?—the makers of tobacco products, and specifically cigarettes…\n\n…speaking of hard times, we turn to our cartoons and Gardner Rea…\n\n…and we close on a bright note, otherwise known as Peter Arno…\n\nNext Time: Rebirth of a Nation?\n\nNot Worth a Dime\n\nFirst performed in Berlin in 1928, The Threepenny Opera was Bertolt Brecht’s socialist critique of capitalist society and was a favorite (somewhat ironically) of that city’s bourgeois “smart set.” However when it landed on the Broadway stage in 1933, it famously flopped, and closed after just twelve performances.\n\nThe first American production, adapted by Jerrold Krimsky and Gifford Cochran, opened April 13, 1933, at the Empire Theatre, featuring Robert Chisholm as Macheath (“Mack the Knife”) and Steffi Duna as his lover, Polly. Critic Robert Benchley found value in the play’s “modernistic” music, but seemed puzzled by its enigmatic production, an opinion shared by other contemporary critics.\n\nSome critics today defend the 1933 American production, noting that the Krimsky–Cochran adaptation was quite faithful to the Brecht original. Perhaps something was lost in translation, or maybe the world in which the play was conceived no longer held much relevance to Depression-era Americans.\n\nBenchley half-heartedly concluded that the play was probably worth seeing, for no other reason than to experience something different for a change.\n\nBy 1933 the world that had conceived The Threepenny Opera was long gone—Brecht fled Nazi Germany two months before his play opened in New York, fearing persecution for his socialist leanings. Things were quickly going “from bad to worse” under Adolf Hitler’s new regime, as Howard Brubaker observed in his “Of All Things” column:\n\n* * *\n\nLook Ma, No Net!\n\nKarl Wallenda (referred to as “Carl” here) was born to an old circus family in Germany in 1905, and by 1922 he would put together a family-style high-wire act (with brother Herman) that would come to be known as “The Flying Wallendas.” They debuted at Madison Square Garden in 1928, notably without their safety net, which had been lost in transit. So they performed without it, much to the acclaim of the adoring crowd. They soon became known for their daring high-wire acts, often performed without safety nets. E.B. White filed this (excerpted) report for “The Talk of the Town.”\n\nIn the years that followed Karl developed some of troops’ most startling acts, including the famed seven-person chair pyramid. They performed this incredibly dangerous stunt until their appearance at the Detroit Shrine Circus in January 1962; the wire’s front man, Dieter Schepp, faltered, causing the pyramid to collapse. Schepp, who was Karl’s nephew, was killed, as was Richard Faughnan, Karl’s son-in-law. Karl injured his pelvis, and his adopted son, Mario, was paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nKarl’s own luck finally ran out on March 22, 1978, on a tightrope between the towers of Condado Plaza Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico. High winds, and an improperly secured wire, caused the 73-year-old Wallenda to wobble, and then fall, one hundred feet to the ground. He was dead on arrival at a local hospital.\n\n* * *\n\nSafer Entertainments\n\nLois Long continued to file nightlife reports in her “Tables for Two” column, reveling in the sights and sounds (and rhythms) of the Cotton Club’s orchestra, led by Duke Ellington…but the real attraction was Ellington’s unnamed drummer, whom I assume was the great Sonny Greer…\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nGiven the news Howard Brubaker shared earlier in this post, I wouldn’t use the word Gemütlichkeit (basically, warmth and friendliness) to describe the state of things in Nazi Germany…\n\n…a better option would be a trip to the British Isles or France on the White Star lines, nicht wahr?…\n\n…RCA’s mascot, Nipper, appeared to contemplating fatherhood in this two-page ad for the company’s new “baby sets”…\n\n…Camel took a break from its magician-themed “It’s Fun to be Fooled” ads to run another elegant Ray Prohaska-illustrated spot…\n\n…on to our cartoons, Carl Rose demonstrated the economic benefits of legal beer…\n\n…E. Simms Campbell showed us a woman seeking a bit of motherly wisdom…\n\n…Whitney Darrow Jr (1909–1999), who began his 50-year career at The New Yorker on March 18, 1933, offered this look at childhood’s hard knocks…\n\n…James Thurber drew up an odd encounter at a cocktail party…\n\n…Peter Arno served up a proud patriarch…\n\n…and William Steig explored the perils of somnambulism…\n\n…on to our April 29, 1933 issue with a cover by Garrett Price…although we’ve already seen many cartoons by Price, we haven’t seen many covers (he did two covers in the magazine’s first year, 1925). Price would ultimately produce 100 covers for The New Yorker, in addition to his hundreds of cartoons…\n\n…for the record, here is Price’s first New Yorker cover from Aug. 1, 1925…\n\n…there was more troubling news from Nazi Germany, this time from Paris correspondent Janet Flanner in her “Letter from Paris” column…Flanner would later gain wider fame as a war correspondent…\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nCamel followed up its elegant ad from the previous issue with another “Fun to be Fooled” spot, this time presented as a multi-panel comic strip…\n\n…Powers Reproduction was a frequent advertiser in the early New Yorker, touting the “realism” of their color photography, but in this case the model looked more like a department store mannequin…\n\n…Otto Soglow continued to ply a lucrative sideline illustrating ads for Sanka decaf…\n\n…as we segue to our cartoonists, the opening section featuring work by both James Thurber and George Price…\n\n…Gardner Rea’s snake charmer expressed her belief that all men are created equal…\n\n…here is a cartoon by a new artist, Howard Baer, who contributed to The New Yorker between 1933 and 1937…\n\n…and another by newcomers Whitney Darrow Jr. …\n\n…and E. Simms Campbell…\n\n…Barbara Shermund continued to rollick with her modern women…\n\n…and we end with the ever-reliable Peter Arno…\n\nBefore we close I want to remember Roger Angell, who died last week at age 101. A literary legend and a great baseball writer to be sure, but also one of the last living links to the first days of The New Yorker. Rest in Peace.\n\nNext Time: Bohemian Rhapsody…\n\nDiary of a Lady\n\nIt was no surprise Dorothy Parker did not think much of society types, especially those afflicted with extreme solipsism.\n\nParker’s “The Diary of a Lady,” briefly excerpted here, featured entries from a diary of a fictional socialite who constantly bemoaned the minor inconveniences of her shallow existence, oblivious to the world around her.\n\nIn contrast to Parker, Robert Benchley’s satire was usually more on the silly side, with a lot less bite. Here is an excerpt from “Home for the Holidays” (which immediately followed Parker’s piece in the magazine), in which Benchley describes the festive mood of one family during FDR’s “bank holiday”…\n\n* * *\n\nOn the Lighter Side\n\nE.B. White was the unofficial aviation correspondent for The New Yorker, ever eager to go aloft in the latest contraption. In this excerpted “Talk of the Town” entry White described his adventures aboard the Goodyear blimp Resolute:\n\nAnd we turn again to White, this time an excerpt from his “Notes and Comment” celebrating Franklin D. Roosevelt’s planned amendment to the Volstead Act that would allow people to have a legal beer while they waited for the 21st Amendment to be ratified. White had a couple of ideas regarding locations for beer gardens. An excerpt:\n\nAlthough the Brevoort idea didn’t pan out, White did get his wish, more or less, for a Bryant Park location, the Bryant Park Grill…\n\n* * *\n\nMayor McCarthy\n\nThe profile featured Stitch McCarthy, considered one the most flamboyant “street mayors” of the Lower East Side. Writing in Lapham’s Quarterly (Aug. 1, 2018), Laurie Gwen Shapiro describes McCarthy as “a five-foot-tall, cross-eyed Romanian Jew born Samuel Rothberg, always seen with a cigar in his mouth.” What Stitch lacked in height he made up for in toughness, and by his teens was as tough as nails. Shapiro writes: “At night he managed a small-time boxer who once was scheduled to fight a bantamweight named Stitch McCartney in Jersey City. As he later told the story (no doubt over and over), his client fled in fear at the sight of McCartney and the crowd booed. He went in the ring himself, flattened McCartney, and took a version of his opponent’s name for his own.”\n\nThe profile was written by Meyer Berger, known as a master of the human interest story. Berger did a short stint at The New Yorker but for most of his career he worked for The New York Times, where he wrote a long-running column, “About New York.” Here is a very brief excerpt of the profile, with a caricature by Al Frueh.\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nI would guess Dorothy Parker would have some problems with this ad, featuring society women shilling for nail polish…\n\n…the folks at Packard went with an ad that showed the ideal customer (seated in a library, clad in smoking jacket), contemplating one of their recent ads (the same one that was featured in the Feb. 18, 1933 issue of The New Yorker…\n\n…Camel ads took on a new look thanks to the artistry of Ray Prohaska (1901–1981)…in the early 1930’s you see more use of watercolors in ads for fashion, or in this case, cigarettes…\n\n…and Gardner Rea drew up this scene for the makers of Sanka coffee, the decaf of its day…\n\n…which leads into the work of other New Yorker cartoonists and another master of the line drawing, Gluyas Williams…\n\n…Robert Day offered a bit of understatement…\n\n…Carl Rose celebrated the arrival of legal beer…\n\n…Otto Soglow showed us how royalty responds to a noisy feline…\n\n…Kemp Starrett shopped for somp’n to read…\n\n…and we close with Peter Arno, and an ill-timed joke, at least for one woman…\n\nNext Time: Stormy Bellwether…"
