        "text": "I can’t believe I’m watching these films because an actress I like is in the series and she isn’t even practically in these particular installments, and in some cases I knew that before watching. An actress named Nancy Dover fills a similar role to the legendary Thelma Todd. That role is as the leading female to Harry Langdon. These shorts would be a lot better with Todd as the leading lady, though it can be understood why she wasn’t. Todd is very feisty and dominant, while Dover is very bubbly and the sort of person that would tolerate the Langdon character more. It generally seems that any time Langdon had to be single and simply deal with a woman, it was with Todd and if he was going to date that woman, it’d be Dover. It is very strange that Todd is so underused, because she is billed above Dover in the films they both appear in, despite Todd getting very little screen time. She’s essentially a cameo. Dover does mostly do a good job as a lighthearted and plucky spark to be a straight man to Langdon, so she certainly earned enough credibility to be billed above Todd. Dover is honestly funnier than Langdon here.\n\nSkirt Shy (1929)\n\nSkirt Shy is a pretty absurdist short and is at its best when it tones down logic. The premise is excellent, a man decides to marry his sweetheart he hasn’t seen in a while and he’s completely fine with killing any of her suitors or dying trying. That’s a good enough premise for a film as is. However, neither of the two suitors are Harry Langdon. Thus, he has to be included. Making the woman they’re fighting over Harry in drag is a decent idea, though Harry feels pretty out of place. His jokes are more “random”. When his mother leaves and her suitor comes to marry her, he starts looking for her. He looks under a table when he knows she couldn’t possibly be there. She said she was going out. Such humor is also pretty bottom of the barrel. If you had to give him something funny to do and you had ten seconds, looking under a table might be what you’d come up with. You can imagine this script was written with the star being one or both of the men that were fighting, then that was repurposed for here. Langdon’s performance is similar to how you would imagine Stan Laurel handling this.\n\nWhile there are extremely overt logic problems, such as there being no reason Harry and his sister can’t just ask the suitor to wait or come back later instead of having Harry pretend to be their mother, Maggie, and Arthur Thalasso’s character being so willing to turn to violence; those logic problems seem to come with an understanding of how ridiculous this all is. Many of the gags are pretty funny, which is good enough to make this a film worth watching. A big benefit is that Harry is sometimes sidelined as Thalasso and the other suitor, Edgar, get the attention. Maggie’s actress, May Wallace, is a solid straight man. She makes you wish that the film had not featured Langdon at all and she was simply in his role. She even gets the final joke. Another disadvantage is that there seems to be some Langdon-led filler before Thalasso shows up.\n\nThelma Todd would’ve also been great as Maggie, though you shouldn’t be sorry to have Wallace. Once again, Harry is perceived as female off of very little effort in presenting himself as one, which is reminiscent of his silent feature, The Chaser. In both that film and this one, it’s rightfully played as absurd that no one could tell he’s a man. Here, there’s a slightly more rational reason that still doesn’t make sense. No explanation would’ve been funnier.\n\nSPOILERS\n\nAt one point Harry is upset by his sister hitting him, so he threatens to throw something at her. She one ups that threat and the situation is defused. That’s a nice moment for Dover to be funny. During the fight between Edgar and Arthur, Harry gets some gags that feel forced in. There’s a scene of him playing with some boxing gloves, as an example. Proving that Hal Roach doesn’t understand Langdon’s character, the guy defined by being childlike and innocent was going to kill Arthur. He killed an animal in an earlier short. Arthur gives Harry his hat with all his money. This is immediately dropped, as if there was payoff in the script and it was cut. We also later see the hat empty.\n\nA paint bucket appears from nowhere so it can be used in a gag. Harry paints an ‘X’ on Arthur’s jacket, to give Edgar a target to shoot. Harry accidentally gets an X on himself and is shot at. This also doesn’t make sense as how could Edgar not tell who is who? Harry was even trying to get him to shoot at the X. The person he is aiming for wouldn’t be telling him to hit the X! The sound of a drum playing as Harry is hit with an apple is one of the better gags.\n\nThe Head Guy (1930)\n\nHarry’s character-type seems based on children. When he’s at his best, the qualities taken are ones that make him seem more innocent and endearing. In this series, it’s like someone thought that a child being careless and randomly doing things is funny. No, we need an actual point. It’s not funny to have this guy just touch random objects and forget things. Once again, Langdon is the worst actor in his own film. The other actors are relatively straight or have a subtle quirk, also having their own story; while Langdon is running around interrupting them. That can work in a sense, like when the Marx Brothers bother a story that would be worse without them, but here you just want Langdon to shut up. The other characters are simply more interesting, including the duck.\n\nOne of the better gags is when a big bag is dropped on a holder and Harry is launched in the air in response. Some of this story focuses on what happens when Edgar Kennedy tells Harry to watch his train station. Other parts of it focus on Eddie Dunn and his theater girls when they show up at and rehearse at the station. There’s the impression that the Harry portion and the Eddie portion are from different films originally. Sometimes one pretty much stops for the other. Representative of this is that it’s implied Harry is alone before Eddie’s arrival. We later see Thelma Todd, who is not with Eddie. Who is she? Where does she come from? Why is she here? She has this random brief scene that could’ve been given to one of the theater girls, then she’s completely gone. Perhaps an early version of the script was about Harry doing things alone, then he finds Thelma or she shows up, and then antics ensue. At one point, Harry salutes Thelma before an awkward cut, as if a scene was removed. Edgar Kennedy has a plot established that’s dropped as soon as he leaves. He also never comes back.\n\nTonally, Harry crying to himself is really out of place. We’re focusing on the relatively upbeat scenes of a theater performance, only for that to be interrupted by Harry yapping all alone. Harry crying is as fun as it sounds. Eddie Dunn is so tall he’s leaning down and his head is cut off at the top of the frame at one point. He gets a great line of, “Get out of here and make it snappy!” When Eddie and company leave, they leave all their stuff behind. Even if you factored out Harry Langdon, the rest of the film isn’t that engaging. It would be alright to take a chance on, but there are better comedies. Anything good you can say is sunk by Harry. Somehow this isn’t the worst Harry film as Introducing exists.\n\nSPOILERS\n\nHarry having troubles with his girl is pretty forced in, like they needed some drama. It’s especially strange that she criticizes the types of girls Harry was dancing with, only to later be dancing with them herself. In the hypothetical early version of this script, maybe Nancy saw Harry with Todd’s character and somehow thought he was cheating on her? Harry saying he wants to die while crying features his acting at its worst. He acts like he has no idea how to say these lines. The movie literally slows to a halt for a few minutes of him wanting to kill himself before we move on. The scene can survive being tone-deaf, that’s not a matter, but it can’t survive due to how slow and long and unfunny it is. Who thought this was a good idea?\n\nEddie offers to take Nancy with her and she agrees. Harry is so mad he was literally going to kill him! He even shoots a gun at him, though it doesn’t go off. The intention might’ve been for Harry to be so emotional he wanted to kill himself and then Eddie, but it plays like scenes are just being thrown in and not that there’s something being built up and developed. Harry is fine, then he’s insane, then he’s sad, then he’s fine again. There’s a compelling moment of Harry thinking he’s been left alone. There’s a nice dark mood to the scene, reminiscent of Three’s a Crowd. The scene’s not too unlike Langdon’s excellent directing style. The sequence has first no, then little dialogue. Thus, it fits with his silent films and shows Harry having a distressed facial expression with layers to his face and a posture that suggests unease without saying it. It’s a very nice moment. I guess Nancy was just messing with him, because she stays and seems to really love Harry, with no explanation for why she said she was going to leave a second, being mad at him, and now has gotten over that. At least the shot of her revealing she’s stayed is really pretty.\n\nTo say the least, I can understand David Lord Heath’s frustration with this guy. Let’s get more of his silent films.\n\nThe Fighting Parson (1930)\n\nThe Fighting Parson so far is the best of the series. Harry doesn’t talk much. That is one reason it’s a step above the others. This short is pretty music-focused. Harry is surprisingly a pretty good banjoist and singer. He plays “Frankie and Johnnie” at one point. Harry Langdon is such a good singer and banjoist that it would be nice to have a music career of his. That’s not something I ever thought I’d say based on his earlier talkies. The centerpiece is a fight scene that has little talking in it. Langdon has excellent comedic timing, having a rhythm to his movements.\n\nHarry steals bread from a man at one point. A woman sees Harry’s sheet music lying on the ground, then we get a closeup clearly of her holding the sheet music, followed by it back on the floor. Inside the bar, a man says to Harry, “you lead and we’ll follow you”. For all they knew, maybe Harry didn’t want to play music right then? The characters and scenario of the first few minutes are dropped after the first act. That opening segment is quite slow and the movie would be better without it. Thelma Todd gets second billing, but is basically just an extra in a crowd. She was in so little she didn’t deserve the credit. There’s a scene where Harry has long sleeves, thus proving this is a sequel to Long Pants.\n\nSPOILERS\n\nHarry must be quite strong due to knocking down a platform with a lot of people on it. Harry just walks behind the bar and makes himself a beer he presumably didn’t pay for. Leo Willis’ character, who is with Nancy, thinks she’s falling for Harry when there’s no sign of that. That makes enough sense as he’s shown to have a screw loose. A fun moment is when Harry gives that man a playful little punch, defending Nancy behind him from the threatening Leo. Harry can’t figure out how to remove his jacket with the boxing gloves on, another moment of him being way too idiotic. It’s quite frightening seeing Nancy beg Harry to fight Leo so she can escape him. She is literally on her knees begging, horrified by him and his abusive behavior. He kidnapped her and is trying to force her to love him. While it’s fine to establish stakes and drama, maybe do something a little more lighthearted?\n\nWhen Leo punches the nail into the ground, he misses the first try. Leo punches Harry’s stomach and a container of water in his shirt sprays out. It should have been established before. One of Harry’s fun “child-esque” moments is how playfully he kicks away the water container. Harry has this light elegance to how he handles his boxing gloves, which are attached to poles in his shirt. He progressively gets better at using them, which would make sense. Thus, we get some good comedy of him struggling and later good comedy of him doing well. He’s so good at amusingly moving the boxing gloves. When Harry wins, Nancy seems to love him. Nancy doesn’t have a reason to. Sure, he helped her, but that doesn’t mean he’s any kind of match for her. Hopefully she doesn’t feel she owes Harry her love, but that’s probably not the case due to how happy she is embracing him. I’d like to think that The Head Guy and the later The Big Kick are sequels to this film. Here, Harry and Nancy apparently begin dating and in those two they are dating.\n\nOVERVIEW"
