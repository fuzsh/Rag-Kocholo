        "text": "Act I. All About Eve or Wishful Casting\n\nWanna play a game? It’ll be fun. If you’re a hardcore movie or TV fan, chances are you’ve played “Wishful Casting” either as a daydream, or in a group, maybe online. Admit it. Maybe you call it something else, but the game remains the same. My mother and I used to do this all the time, brainstorming who might be the ideal candidate to replace an actor who decides to leave a TV show, or whom we might cast when a remake of a favorite movie or show was announced, who might be the best choice to cast in a book-to-movie adaptation, and, finally, who could play so-and-so if a movie were ever made about such-and-such real life event. Believe me, my mother (may she rest in peace) and I second-guessed a good many casting choices in projects torn from the headlines or from the history books.\n\nIn today’s round, I’d like to revisit 1950’s all-time classic, the one and only All About Eve, starring Bette Davis and Angela Lansbury. I mean Bette Davis and Anne Baxter. Anyway, the familiar classic scored 14 Oscar nominations and ultimately won Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay (Joseph L. Mankiewicz), among others [1].\n\nAll About Eve is steeped in movie lore. In this greatest and wittiest backstage saga, Davis plays a fortyish Broadway star, still at the peak of her prowess, who grants admittance into her inner circle an awestruck, “down-on-her-luck,” fan, that is, Anne Baxter’s titular Eve. She makes herself indispensable to Davis’s Margo though the latter comes to question whether Eve has her own agenda, such as cozying up to anyone and everyone who might help advance her (Eve’s) Broadway ambitions, even if it means seducing Margo’s longtime—albeit younger–lover, a hotshot director named Bill with lots of clout, played with enviable swagger by Gary Merrill.\n\nAbout that whole “lore” thing, well, consider that All About Eve gave Bette Davis the best role she’d had in a few good years, since the mid 1940s, and, thus, provided her one of the greatest of all comebacks–not to mention a future husband in the form of no less than onscreen romantic partner, Merrill. Margo Channing may very well be her most fondly remembered role, ripe as it is with classic one-liners. Incredible as it might seem now, Davis wasn’t the first choice for the role. No, Oscar winner Claudette Colbert was cast originally though, to clarify, Colbert was not even the first, second, or third choice, according to multiple accounts [2]. Nonetheless, Colbert looked to have the right stuff, and the project went into pre-production when, lo, an injury forced her to withdraw. Enter Davis on barely a moment’s notice. So far, so great.\n\nThe casting of Anne Baxter as scheming Eve Harrington is another lore-worthy item. Baxter was also not the first choice. 20th Century Fox head Darryl F. Zanuck encouraged Mankiewicz to hire Jeanne Crain in the role of the scheming upstart. Crain was a popular though lightweight actress who had, nonetheless, earned a Best Actress nomination after being oddly cast as a bi-racial character who passes for white in Pinky. (Why wouldn’t she pass as white? Almost nobody in the history of movies was ever as white as, and certainly not whiter than, Jeanne Crain. No one EVER mistook her as anything else.) While Mankiewicz had already established a relationship with Crain as she had just appeared in 1949’s A Letter to Three Wives (for which JMank won Oscars as director and screenwriter), he–reportedly–professed that Crain lacked the “bitch virtuosity” to pull off a role as underhanded as Eve (Staggs 72). Zanuck relented, opening the door for Baxter, who–to her credit–had recently won the Best Supporting Actress for her role in Fox’s The Razor’s Edge, playing an American woman fallen on hard times in 1920s Paris.\n\nNow, here’s where the story becomes even more interesting. In a Criterion interview, costume historian Larry McQueen offers that one reason JMank favored Baxter is that she bore a passing resemblance to Colbert, that is, a young Claudette Colbert, who’d been cast as Margo already, a story corroborated by Staggs (60). This makes a degree or two of sense. A quick look at photos of both women reveals a plausible–if not highly pronounced–likeness. (Feel free to research on your own.) The selling point could be as simple as short, similarly styled, hairdos, a patrician profile, and maybe an archness about the eyes. Whatever. McQueen continues, explaining that, as the tale unfolds, Eve would look more and more like Margo, the similarities enhanced, such that Eve seemed more threatening, playing upon Margo’s insecurities about aging and wanting to hang-on to her lover if not her career. The costumes would also reflect this in that whatever Margo wore, Eve would appear in a comparable if not exact version, meaning more youthful (shorter) and tailored (that is, more form fitting and, therefore, more figure flattering). When Margo opts for an off-the-shoulder look, Eve opts likewise; when Margo sports chiffon, Eve also sports chiffon [3]. Great conceit, especially if it works on a purely visual level without specific commentary from one character or another. The effect is never overt enough to register as “copycat.” The audience registers it almost sub-consciously. So far, so good.\n\nThe trouble is that once Colbert withdrew from the production and Davis committed, the movie lost that element of visual intrigue. Baxter looks nothing like Davis, especially given the latter’s glamourous transformation with a stylish side-part hairstyle cascading to her shoulders and dramatic red slash of mouth. Oh, and, of course, Davis’s unmistakable big, blue eyes. Remember, before she was hailed in 1981’s massively popular radio hit, “Bette Davis Eyes,” the actress was often hailed as “Popeye the Magnificent” in the press. Not so, Baxter. So, there’s that. Sure, the costume designers–Charles Le Maire for Eve (along with most of the cast) and Edith Head (on loan from Paramount) for Bette’s Margo–can still work their conceit about echoing outfits, but that doesn’t resolve what appears to be a major casting miscalculation. See, without the “oomph” of casting a younger version of the actress playing Margo, Eve has to be performed with great delicacy, great subtlety, but only up to a point.\n\nI know I am not alone when I state that I think Baxter’s performance is the weakest link in All About Eve. There. It’s out in the open. Sure, the audience learns–SPOILER ALERT!–that Eve is not everything she appears to be but the way Baxter portrays her, one has to wonder why most of the other characters are such late arrivals to the game. From the beginning, just about everything that Baxter/Eve does comes across as phony. Whether demure or lightly self-deprecating, she seems fake, not a hair’s breadth of credibility. As has oft-been noted, how can it be that Margo and her sophisticated circle of friends, including seasoned writers, directors, producers, and at least one influential theatre critic, are fooled by such an obvious pretender? Of course, the true-blue believers flip that argument on its head by observing that Margo and her friends are so ridiculously full of themselves that they naturally fall for Eve’s silken-voiced flattery. That almost makes sense though why must the audience be one-step ahead, per Danny Peary (5)? What’s the value? It’s not a Hitchcock film, after all. That noted, one player in the group snaps to Eve’s wiles right from the beginning: Birdie, Margo’s seen-it-all-and-done-it-all dresser/housekeeper, played by the one and only Thelma Ritter. After hearing Eve recount her woeful tale of dashed hopes, Birdie intones, “Everything but the bloodhounds snappin’ at her rear end.” She later shares that Eve studies Margo, the way one would study an object. Amusingly, Margo echoes Birdie’s own words when harrumphing about Eve to Bill.\n\nThat noted, I guess Baxter served Mank the performance he wanted considering that Baxter snagged an Oscar nod for Best Actress as did Davis, along with supporting players Ritter, Celeste Holm and George Sanders (who actually won the trophy in his category). Still, the game of Wishful Casting comes to me at times with this one. An early thought was that Donna Reed, still a few years away from reinventing herself with an Oscar winning performance in From Here to Eternity, could have been fun, but the person that I keep going back to is no less than Angela Lansbury. That’s right, Angela Lansbury, five-time Tony winner–six if you count her Lifetime Achievement Award–beloved voice of Mrs. Potts in Disney’s classic Beauty and the Beast, and, of course, super-sleuth of the long-running TV hit Murder, She Wrote, evermore popular in reruns.\n\nAt the time of All About Eve, Lansbury reported to MGM as a contract player though she was hardly an unknown quantity, reaping two Best Supporting Actress nominations in her first two years of moviemaking: first, for Gaslight (1944); then, for The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945). She’d eventually earn a third nomination for The Manchurian Candidate (1962), but I’m getting ahead of myself. So, yes, Lansbury had the talent to play Eve, but she also had an advantage that Baxter lacked. Lansbury resembled Bette Davis just enough to bring back the subtext that was lost when Davis replaced Colbert. This is not to say, no ma’am, that Lansbury was, ahem a Dead Ringer for Davis but that she had the right saucer-eyed look that might give Margo pause as though she were looking at a younger version of herself, and, yes, it’s mainly in the eyes. Maybe they’re not Bette Davis eyes, per se, but close enough, closer than Baxter’s almond shaped eyes, fer shur. That both Davis and Lansbury had blue eyes wouldn’t necessarily register in a black and white film, true, but Lansbury certainly knew how to use her eyes as expressively as Davis. Anyone who’s ever indulged in a MSW marathon can attest to that. Oh, sure, Lansbury was taller than Davis (per the IMDb, 5’8″ to Davis’s 5’3″), but costumes, camera angles, and staging can minimize that effect. It happens (happened), often enough, when female performers are/were taller than their male counterparts who might have been “bigger,” if not taller, stars. Or, who knows, the height difference could have worked in the movie’s favor, giving Margo another reason to feel threatened. Maybe not. Oh, and if it matters, Lansbury would have been about 25 at the time of All About Eve, two years younger than Baxter (per the IMDb).\n\nOkay, so what about that “bitch” element as Mank put it so eloquently? Could Lansbury muster that effect? Oh, I bet she could. Remember, Lansbury earned an Oscar nod for her first screen role as Nancy, a cockney maid in Gaslight, starring Best Actress winner Ingrid Bergman along with Charles Boyer and Joseph Cotten. In that old-time classic, pouty Nancy’s behavior borders on impudence when dealing with the man of the house (Boyer) and downright frosty when “handling” his anxious wife, Paula. Bergman’s Paula is as suspicious of Nancy as Nancy is of Paula, neither of whom realizes that Boyer’s plan–SPOILER ALERT–is to drive Paula to madness–or for her to believe she’s going mad–in order to cover the tracks of his sinister deeds. His agenda includes tamping down the amount of gas needed for household lighting fixtures; hence, the term we now know as “gaslighting.” For those who hadn’t already heard, that’s the origin, but I digress.\n\nAnyway, in the early 1940s, Lansbury was fairly new in the U.S, having arrived with her mother and two brothers, to get away from wartime England, when she–theatrically trained though relatively untested–scored an audition through a family contact at MGM and began work on Gaslight at the astonishingly young age of 17, even waiting until she turned 18 in order to film a scene in which Nancy smokes [4]. Anyway, whether 17 or 18, Lansbury’s Nancy is worldly beyond her years and as startling in her own way as Bette Davis’s cruelly manipulative Cockney waitress Mildred is in 1934’s Of Human Bondage, the role and the film that changed the course of Davis’s career. Oh, and guess who played Mildred in a 1948 Of Human Bondage radio production? So, yes, “bitch virtuosity.” Done. Score, Lansbury.\n\nSo, that takes care of the B quotient, but that side of Eve is the part which Baxter lands, mostly. What about the other side of Eve, the modest young thing, so vulnerable and eager to please, what about that aspect? That’s the part of Baxter’s performance that jars in its falseness. Could Lansbury be more convincing, such that Eve’s gradual unmasking brings a jolt of surprise to both the audience as well as the other characters. Yes, I think she could. To that end, consider Lansbury’s second nominated performance as lovelorn Sibyl Vane in The Picture of Dorian Gray, a mere year after Gaslight. Vane is a music hall entertainer in Victorian England who charms the protagonist, an aristocrat, blessed with all the good looks in the world (played in this version by Hurd Hatfield) who strikes a deal with the devil that allows him (Gray) to remain as youthful and gorgeous as he ever was though with a horrifying twist. Vane is like a plaything to Gray so while he’s fond of her and her singing, initially, he dismisses her when she becomes too eager to please, all but sealing her fate.\n\nAs Sibyl, Lansbury gives a heartbreaking performance, one so far far removed from snotty Nancy in Gaslight that, of course, the Academy nominated her again so quickly. Everything about Sibyl, even the way she holds herself, is different from Nancy. Further, make no mistake, Lansbury is gorgeous as Sibyl Vane, as ripe with luscious beauty as any screen siren in the movies. The back-to-back success of these two performances is what assures this viewer, at least, that she could handle the ginormous complexity of Eve, relative, that is, to Baxter’s take. In Lansbury’s case, it could be like seeing poor, pitiful, but beautiful, Sibyl Vane morph into cold and calculating Nancy without warning–and in one sitting. Oh, and to be clear, if you’ve ever seen Lansbury’s magnificent, Oscar nominated work in 1962’s The Manchurian Candidate, she leaves no doubt that she knows how to spin a character on its head.\n\nOf course, as much fun as Wishful Casting can be, it’s also fairly ridiculous since, in this case, what’s done is done, so what’s the point, right? After all, Lansbury, as noted, was an MGM contract player while 20th Century Fox produced and distributed All About Eve, meaning even if Mank and Fox casting agents had had an inkling of hiring Lansbury, that could have only happened with the blessing of MGM’s top brass, which still included the “great and powerful” Louis B. Mayer. Such loan outs were not always welcome and required considerable finesse. Lansbury, not being a top-tier star, might not have warranted the effort though she had been loaned out for other pics, notably Paramount’s lavish Samson and Delilah in 1949. Still again, records indicate that Lansbury might have been considered, however briefly, for the key role of Miss Caswell (Staggs 11), budding showgirl, protege, and arm candy to Sanders’ megalomaniacal theatre columnist Addison DeWitt at Margo’s “bumpy night” of a party; a smallish part, true, but one made legendary due to the fortuitous casting of Marilyn Monroe, a starlet only two years away from breaking through as Fox’s top box office draw thanks to Niagara, How to Marry a Millionaire, and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Miss Caswell wasn’t MM’s first big screen gig, nor even her first speaking part, but she’s an utter delight in her only appearance alongside the one and only Davis. But I digress since this piece is more All About Angela rather than All About Marilyn.\n\nBy the early 1950s, Lansbury and MGM parted ways, mutually by many accounts. Sure, Lansbury worked and even made a handful of notable films, such as her two Oscar nominated efforts but also the likes of National Velvet and The Harvey Girls. The concern was that many of the films did more for Lansbury’s co-stars, such as Elizabeth Taylor and Anne Revere in the former and Judy Garland in the latter, than they ever did for her, necessarily. In other words, she spent most of the 1940s playing sisters and BFFs of better known stars. Indeed, backing up, Lansbury lost her second Oscar race for Dorian Gray to Velvet co-star Revere, playing Taylor’s mother while Lansbury enacted the sister. Sure, it’s a living, and a nice one at that, but Lansbury also felt she had more to offer and just wanted the chance to stretch. It’s a shame, too, that in spite of her two Oscar nominations–at such a prodigiously young age and in two such wildly varied roles– this didn’t result in greater attention in MGM’s front office but as Lansbury subsequently expressed, no one at the studio ever knew what to do with her. Yes, in spite of two Oscar nominations.\n\nLansbury continued to work steadily if unspectacularly in movies and TV without the safety net of MGM for much of the 1950s and early 1960s, during which time she began playing the mothers of people not much younger than her. For example, she was barely 10 years older than Elvis Presley when she played his mother in 1961’s Blue Hawaii. She was 12 years older than Warren Beatty when the two of them played mother and son in 1962’s All Fall Down. In both instances, mind you, she was still in her 30s [5]. Her work for director John Frankenheimer in All Fall Down proved so satisfactory that even before the film wrapped, Frankenheimer approached Lansbury about what he believed should be her next role. He all but demanded it, in fact.\n\nThat role turned out to be Eleanor Iselin, politician’s wife and mother of a tormented Korean War hero Raymond Shaw, played by Laurence Harvey (a mere 3 years younger than Lansbury) in The Manchurian Candidate, 1962’s brazen mix of conspiracy thriller and political satire based on Richard Condon’s 1959 novel of the same name. Ushered to the big screen by superstar Frank Sinatra, who headlines as one of Shaw’s former platoon members, battling nightmares and flashbacks. Is it PTSD (rarely discussed as openly at the time as is now common) or something far different and insidious? An Army Intelligence officer, Sinatra’s Marco tracks down Shaw and becomes ensnared in his unravelling.\n\nEleanor Iselin is a piece of work who stage manages her political second husband’s every word and deed. The pair of them, but especially Eleanor, are so rabidly right wing, so rabidly anti-communist, that they make Roy Cohn and Senator Joseph McCarthy look like hippie-dippy flower children though the degree of Eleanor’s utter contempt for humanity would frighten Machiavelli or Lady MacBeth and, yes, make even Eve Harrington green with envy. To claim that Eleanor Iselin is fiercely protective of her son is a perverse understatement. To her credit, Lansbury doesn’t play her as vicious, “mad,” or otherwise certifiably over-the-top crazy, but, rather, she’s cold. Indeed, it seems that the higher the stakes, the colder she reveals herself to be. The face hardens, becomes mask-like; the gaze becomes steelier, and the voice rarely rises above a whisper. Think what might happen if Streep’s Miranda Priestly had spawned the heir to Anthony Hopkins’s Hannibal Lecter. That’s Lansbury’s Eleanor Iselin.\n\nThe Manchurian Candidate secured Lansbury’s third and final Oscar nomination, yet again as a supporting player. The loss was tough in many ways because Lansbury was probably so, so, close. After all, she’d won the Golden Globe in her category as well as the National Board of Review award. Yes, things were definitely moving in her favor, keeping in mind that almost everyone who knows the history of such things will probably concur: Angela Lansbury deserved the Oscar that year for her supporting performance in The Manchurian Candidate. The paradox is that almost no one–none that I’ve ever read–thinks that Patty Duke absolutely DID NOT deserve the Oscar she won that year in the same category for The Miracle Worker.\n\nAct II. The Paradox: Eleanor, Helen, and the Oscars\n\nAh, yes, Patty Duke as Helen Keller, the remarkable American scholar, author, suffragette, and disability rights advocate–among other strengths–who rose to prominence in the early 20th century after overcoming the odds against her once childhood illness left her both sightless and without hearing. Her achievements came in no small part due to the tutelage of her teacher Annie Sullivan, the “twist,” for lack of a better word, being that shortly before her work with the Kellers, Sullivan had undergone a series of operations to restore her own eyesight, which had been badly damaged since childhood due to disease. To paraphrase Mark Twain, one of Keller’s dearest friends: Helen Keller is the miracle, and Annie Sullivan is the miracle worker. William Gibson’s award winning play was based on Keller’s autobiography as well as, as one source indicates, Annie Sullivan’s own account of her unsteady introduction to the Keller family when Helen was seven years old and her parents had all but given up hope that their struggling–yet willful–child, so adrift in her own world of darkness and silence, would ever learn how to be more independent, and, okay, better behaved. [< To clarify, Duke was just a few years older than Helen was at the time the play takes place; however, the actress’s round face and ever-so-diminutive stature–she’s tiny, tiny, y’all–worked well in her favor, creating and maintaining the illusion of a much younger child.] The play premiered to high praise for Duke and Anne Bancroft (as Annie Sullivan) in 1959 and played for 791 performances, earning Tony awards for Gibson, Bancroft, and director Arthur Penn. As well, Duke, already a budding professional with a smattering of movie and TV credits, won a Theatre World award for her portrayal. Then, Hollywood beckoned with Bancroft, Duke, and Penn tapped to recrate their work onscreen along with, yes, Gibson on board to adapt.\n\nBy the time cameras rolled on The Miracle Worker, Duke was a teen, but, no matter, the odds–including the gift of being extra petite (again, with a round face)–worked in her favor. She might not look as young as 7 years old per the script, but she still looks more like a child rather than a teen. That year, even with beloved veteran Thelma Ritter (The Birdman of Alcatraz) in her sixth–and what would be her final–Oscar race, even with Mary Badham, a newcomer so beloved as ‘Scout’ in the instant classic To Kill a Mockingbird, and the debut of exciting Shirley Knight in Sweet Bird of Youth, the Oscar for 1962’s Best Supporting Actress came down to Duke and Lansbury, no ifs, ands, or buts.\n\nSo, yes, Lansbury went into the last stretch with a Globe and honors from the National Board of Review, but Duke was still in it to win it, per her Globe nomination, her three-way tie for Globes’ Most Promising Newcomer award (or something to that effect [6]), and her supporting actress first-place finish in Motion Picture Exhibitor‘s Golden Laurel awards voting (per theatre owners and operators). As dazzling as Lansbury is in The Manchurian Candidate, what Duke achieves in The Miracle Worker may very well be nothing short of singular, so extraordinary is her absolute commitment to relaying Keller’s experience through performance. Of course, this is all speculation except that we know Duke bested Lansbury in Oscar’s final tally. My thought is that voters were drawn to Duke because she carried the prestige of being a Broadway talent recreating her stage role for film; she played a real-life figure (always a plus); hers was a movie of inspiration and hope (if that’s not redundant), and people felt good about themselves for voting for her for all those reasons; that, and they were awed by Duke’s sheer talent, especially–it must be noted–in someone so young. Lansbury’s Iselin and the movie in which it appeared offered no such lasting goodwill.\n\nTo those who carp that Duke’s role in The Miracle Worker is akin to a second lead compared to Lansbury’s noticeably more–what?–compact role, that’s worth considering though in the end, there is no question that The Miracle Worker is more Annie Sullivan’s story than Helen Keller’s. No doubt, Duke’s scenes with Bancroft give the movie tremendous power but whereas at a certain point Duke’s Helen interacts almost exclusively with her teacher, the same is not true with Annie as Bancroft’s Sullivan must also hold her own in scene after scene in which she’s pitted against Keller family dynamics whether Captain Keller (Victor Jory), Kate Keller (Inga Swenson) or even James Keller (Andrew Prine), one of the captain’s–grown–sons from his first marriage, each player with an agenda and, by extension, an argument. Further, as the story progresses, the details of Sullivan’s horrific childhood–such as growing up in an asylum after being orphaned as a child–and her own battles to overcome near blindness emerge, offering insight into why and what motivates her so strongly. Annie Sullivan is unquestionably the lead, and, again, not for nothing did Gibson title it The Miracle Worker rather than The Helen Keller Story, so the carping about category fraud or category confusion regarding Duke is misleading [use the rubric] though, even among those carpers, I’ve never known anyone to flat-out argue that Duke was necessarily un-deserving in spite of quibbles about screentime; most of the time, it’s not mentioned.\n\nTo Be Continued: Broadway Comes A-Callin’ and Jessica “J.B.” Fletcher\n\nFortunately for Lansbury, Broadway came a-callin’ at just about the right time, and she (re)established herself–flourished, in fact–as a musical theatre powerhouse, forging Broadway credibility in the likes of A Taste of Honey (1960) and Anyone Can Whistle (1964) before earning Tony awards for Mame (1966), Dear World (1969), a sensational 1974 revival of Gypsy (which Lansbury first played in London and a major North American tour), and Sweeney Todd (1979). She proved such a formidable presence that when Yul Brynner took a much needed break from his well-received 1977 revival of The King and I, in a role in which he had been singularly identified both onstage and screen (to the tune of a Best Actor Oscar), producers hired Lansbury to take on the role of Anna (the I in The King and I), in order to guarantee a big name and keep the show going pending Brynner’s return (and for which Lansbury earned a Drama Desk nomination). In the midst of her incredible Broadway streak, Lansbury worked sporadically in movies and TV, mainly Disney’s musical fantasy Bedknobs and Broomsticks [7] and a pair of Agatha Christie outings (including 1978’s aforementioned Death on the Nile, in which she played flamboyant romance novelist Salome Otterbourne, earning Best Supporting Actress honors from the National Board of Review as well as a BAFTA nod [8]), before landing the role that would forever make her a household name, that of Jessica Fletcher, retired high school English teacher who turned to writing mysteries on a lark after her husband of 30 years passed, becoming a best selling author and amateur sleuth, in CBS’s long-running Murder, She Wrote…but that’s a whole other chapter and one well worth pursuing, eventually.\n\nBack to All About Eve. I love the idea of Angela Lansbury slipping into the role of duplicitous Eve and all her machinations. No doubt, she and Bette Davis would have made movie magic, but maybe it’s for the best that things worked out the way they did. Consider that, for all the film’s success, All About Eve proved–aside from her earlier Oscar win–to be the high point of Baxter’s career; never again would she have it so good though she worked steadily in stage, film, and TV for decades [9]. Bette Davis fared better, notching yet another Oscar nomination (her 9th–official–nod [10]) two years later for The Star. Like Baxter, Davis rarely lacked for opportunities during the 195os though she was hardly the draw she’d been in the late 1930s and throughout much of the 1940s, leading up to All About Eve. Sure, she heralded a brazen new niche with 1962’s darkly comic, made-on-the-cheap thriller, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?, earning her final Oscar nod–losing to Bancroft–before segueing to similar ghoulish fare–monster movies in which the “monsters” were effectively humans played at a fevered pitch by veteran screen-actresses of a certain age–most famously 1964’s Hush…Hush, Sweet Charlotte. Once that genre ran its course, Davis found more and better roles on television–while still working in movies albeit less frequently–and earning all kinds of accolades in the process [11], so good for her, but here’s the difference between Lansbury and both Baxter and Davis. In the early 60s, around the time of Whatever Baby Jane‘s premiere, fiftyish Bette Davis cheekily ran an ad in the trade journals, reminding one and all that she was ready and available for work if anyone had doubts about her mobility or affability. The stunt rocked Hollywood insiders yet despite trying to downplay the whole thing as a lark, Davis found herself at a critical juncture in her career (Stine, Davis 311). That part is undeniable. In contrast, in the mid 1970s, as Lansbury eased into her 50s, she reigned as one of Broadway’s biggest draws, and that was in many ways only the beginning as she was on the cusp of turning 60 in 1984 when she began her more than decade long run as the star of one of TV’s biggest shows, her ticket to becoming a household name if she weren’t already.\n\nLansbury always knew she had more skill, more complexity, to offer than what Hollywood’s legendary moguls allotted, so she pushed herself toward reinvention as often as needed in order to keep opportunity alive, never settling for complacency and always stretching her talent to all new heights time and again, with ever an eye on the work itself, a professional through and through and “Wishful Casting” aside, that’s the difference between All About Angela and All About Eve.\n\nThanks for your consideration….\n\nNotes\n\n[1] Only three movies hold such distinction, the other two being Titanic (1997) and La La Land (2016). A few points of further interest include the following. Back in 195o, when black and white films were still more common than not, art-direction, costume design, and cinematography were divided between color films and black and white films, such that B&W films, including All About Eve, only competed against other B&W titles in those three craft areas. All About Eve also snagged an incredible five acting nominations in three categories. Even though All About Eve was the nominations champ in the 1950/51 Oscar race, and even though it won the top two prizes, Best Picture and Best Director, it “only” won in six categories, the other four being Best B&W Costumes, Best Sound Recording, and Best Supporting Actor (George Sanders as acerbic theater columnist Addison DeWitt), as well as the award for the category we now know as Best Adapted Screenplay (Joseph L. Mankiewicz). JMank’s back-to-back Oscars for writing and directing Eve in 1950 and 1949’s A Letter to Three Wives still hold an Academy record.\n\n[2] Per Sam Staggs’s All about All About Eve: The Complete Behind-the-Scenes Story of the Bitchiest Film Ever Made (2000), goddess-y Marlene Dietrich had been discussed early on as a possible Margo and after Colbert withdrew, Dietrich was mentioned again–along with real-life theatrical legend Gertrude Lawrence (61-64).\n\n[3] Charles Le Maire, Fox’s Executive Director of Wardrobe, had already situated costumes for the likes of Baxter, Thelma Ritter, Celeste Holm–as what passes for Margo’s bestie, Karen Richards, wife of playwright Lloyd Richards–and all the rest, yes, including Colbert, when Davis was hired as the latter’s replacement. Davis was thrilled by Margo’s prospects, but her participation came with a few contractual considerations, one being that Edith Head would design her new costumes. Head, the doyenne of Paramount’s costume shop–nicknamed the Dress Doctor and Le Maire’s equivalent on her own turf–rated a surprise choice since she and Davis had almost never collaborated given that the latter had reigned for years at Warners, thus their professional paths had seldom crossed; not never, but rarely. Anyway, the story goes that Le Maire, steadfastly at work on his next project, welcomed Head as it lessened pressure on him; meanwhile, his designs for Colbert were eventually repurposed for other Fox films. When Oscar time came, the two shared the award for All About Eve with Head upstaging herself since she was also nominated for Sunset Blvd. in the same category.\n\n[4] An intriguing if entirely coincidental footnote to this story is that for the purposes of her Gaslight screentest, Lansbury played opposite Hugh Marlowe who also delivered Lansbury’s first screen kiss in the process. Any All About Eve fan knows that Marlowe eventually portrayed playwright Lloyd Richards, yet another target of Eve’s seduction. See what a tale this is turning out to be?\n\n[5] – For these purposes, ages have been “verified” via the Internet Movie Database: Lansbury was born in 1925; Elvis was born in 1935; Warren Beatty’s birth year is listed as 1937, and Laurence Harvey’s is 1928.\n\n[6] – Duke’s fellow winners in the category were Rita Tushingham (A Taste of Honey) and Sue Lyon (Lolita).\n\n[7] – During her long-running MSW gig. Lansbury found time to voice beloved “Mrs. Potts” in Disney’s first ever fully animated Academy Best Picture nominee Beauty and the Beast (1991), singing the Oscar winning title tune as part of the deal and while we’re at it: Lansbury won yet another Tony for her featured role as clairvoyant Madame Arcati in the 2009 revival of Noel Coward’s Blithe Spirit. A year later, she notched another Tony nod for her portrayal of Madame Armfeldt in a revival of Sondheim’s A Little Night Music. She lost that one, but received a Special Lifetime Achievement Tony in 2022; likewise, while a competitive Oscar long eluded Lansbury, she also earned an Honorary Oscar for a lifetime of stellar performances in 2013. (Click each link to see BOTH clips.)\n\n[8] – First, my guess is that Christie’s Otterbourne was at least inspired by real-life novelists Elinor Glyn and E.M. Hull. Next, Lansbury’s other “lesser” Christie outing was 1980’s The Mirror Crack’d, in which she portrayed my favorite Christie sleuth, Miss Jane Marple. In spite of boasting much of the same behind-the-scenes talent as 1974’s Murder on the Orient Express and 1978’s Death on the Nile, both of them star-studded box office hits with Oscar credibility (including Anthony Powell’s award winning costumes for the latter), The Mirror Crack’d, clearly inspired by the tragic story of actress Gene Tierney, registered as more a miscalculation in spite of such marquee names as Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, Tony Curtis, and Kim Novak though Lansbury notched a Saturn nomination for her efforts. [Backing up, Elinor Glyn is referenced slyly among authors whose “smutty” books send shudders up and down the spines of River City’s uptight matrons in Meredith Willson’s The Music Man; the others being Honoré de Balzac, Geoffrey Chaucer, Omar Khayyam, and François Rabelais; I would wager, as well, that E.M. Forster had Elinor Glyn in mind as the model for spirited romance novelist Eleanor Lavish in A Room with a View (played winningly by Judi Dench in the acclaimed 1986 Merchant-Ivory-Jhabvala adaptation). Meanwhile, Glyn’s contemporary Edith Maude Hull is best known for penning the novel The Sheik, later adapted into one of silent star Rudolph Valentino’s biggest hits though Valentino also appeared in adaptations of Glyn’s titles as well.]\n\n[9] In many ways, Baxter often played real-life Eve to Bette’s Margo over time in that when Lauren Bacall departed her Tony winning role as Margo in the Broadway cast of Applause, the early 1970s Comden-Green-Strouse-Adams musical based on All About Eve, in order to headline the show’s national tour, Baxter stepped into the role for the better part of a year. Talk about déjà vu, that one hits close to home; moreover, in the early 1980s when ongoing health concerns forced Davis into forgoing the key role as the proprietor in the TV adaptation of Arthur Hailey’s Hotel–after the pilot had been filmed–Baxter filled-in, yet again, as the sister-in-law of Davis’s character, owning a stake in said hotel, and leaving Davis’s character to be referenced occasionally though otherwise out of the picture. Even so, Baxter passed during the course of the show’s five year span (1983-1988), suffering a fatal stroke in 1986 at the age of 62. Davis outlived both Baxter and the TV show, passing in 1989 at the age of 81.\n\n[10] – Long story, worth its own piece, but many sources now include Davis’s write-in nomination for her otherwise un-nominated turn as “slatternly” Mildred in 1934’s Of Human Bondage, the breakthrough role that made critics and audiences take note. Likely the victim of studio politics, a danger when a performer was “loaned out” from one studio to another, Davis was widely speculated to be a certain Academy nominee, the outcry so strong when she wasn’t nominated that the Academy allowed write-in votes. Per multiple reports, Davis logged enough votes to rank higher in the final tally than at least one of the official nominees. Even the Academy’s database lists the write-in vote among that year’s nominees though elsewhere in the same database the write-in vote is either ignored or qualified. Officially, Bette logged 10 nods (a record in 1963); 11 if one counts Of Human Bondage.\n\n[11] – For example, Davis won an Emmy for her leading role–opposite no less than Gena Rowlands–in 1979’s Strangers: The Story of a Mother and Daughter, one of a handful of projects that snagged Emmy consideration for the actress. Her last great film role was in 1987’s The Whales of August, opposite Lillian Gish, another screen-legend, as widowed elderly sisters spending their summer in a Maine seaside community, surrounded by the likes of aging ladies man Vincent Price and lifelong pal Ann Sothern, another prolific movie and TV vet from Hollywood’s glory days who notched her sole Oscar nod in the supporting category for her amusingly entertaining performance though enthusiastic reviews for the leads put Davis and Gish back in circulation on talk shows and magazine features. [As a sidebar to this Whales of August footnote, in a sepia-toned prologue set during the women’s younger days, Davis’s Libby is portrayed by Margaret Ladd, known at the time for playing the more emotionally vulnerable of star Jane Wyman’s two daughters in TV’s long-running nighttime serial Falcon Crest; Gish’s Sarah is acted by one-time Oscar winner Mary Steenburgen (Best Supporting Actress for 1980’s Melvin and Howard) while Tisha Sterling, an actress in her outright besides being Sothern’s daughter, took on the role of Sothern’s younger self. Clearly, Sterling’s casting is spot-on, but Steenburgen and Ladd are visually on-target, too.]\n\n[12] – That noted, it still bears repeating that Davis’s strongest competition that year seemingly came not from Baxter but from Gloria Swanson, herself enjoying a thrilling comeback as Norma Desmond, a once wildly popular–fictional–silent screen queen who seduces a caddish young screenwriter in hopes of embarking on, well, a comeback, in Billy Wilder’s sensational–and, in the right frame of mind, darkly comic–Sunset Boulevard, one of 1950’s strongest Oscar candidates. Even if Baxter hadn’t been in the picture, Swanson loomed as a favorite though, sure, splitting votes with Baxter was never the way to win though, tellingly, all three actresses–along with the great Eleanor Parker in Caged–were bested in the final tally by Judy Holliday, wowing audiences in the stage-to-screen adaptation of her big Broadway hit, Born Yesterday.\n\nSources\n\nPeary, Danny.

Inside Oscar: the Unofficial History of the Academy Awards – 10th Anniversary Edition. Edited by Gail MacColl. Ballantine, 1996.\n\nHello, again. Breaks happen. Where were we? Oh, yes. The Oscars had just happened when I wrote my last post. I followed my awards coverage with a piece about Joanne Woodward, the beneficiary of Best Supporting Actress winner Allison Janney’s gratitude.\n\nOkay, now back to business. I want to revisit one of the Academy’s most, well, infamous picks. Allegedly. I’m referring to the time when the Academy lavished Best Actress honors on Grace Kelly (The Country Girl), bypassing Judy Garland, whom many believe was the presumed frontrunner, giving her all in the spectacular, big-budget musical reincarnation of venerable Hollywood tearjerker, A Star is Born. The second official, and third unofficial, incarnation–in blazing Technicolor, no less [1]. Dynamo Garland, long a fan favorite, had not made a movie in a few years, following a period of emotional upheavals and a painful dismissal from MGM where she had toiled in one picture after another since her teens. In the interim between her last and most recent film, she re-established herself as a top concert draw. With her luster restored, she and then husband-manager Sid Luft used their new found clout to set-up shop at Warner Bros where they produced, through the auspices of their Transcona Enterprises, what was heralded as a stellar triumph, the comeback of all comebacks: the story of a Hollywood ingénue who rises to the peak of stardom while her husband (in this case, played by James Mason), already well established in the biz, suffers a downward spiral brought on by his own self-destructive tendencies, chiefly alcoholism (Peary 126; Wiley and Bona 246). The star-studded premiere was, in a TV first, broadcast live–coast to coast with studio honcho Jack Warner famously boasting, “It’s the greatest night in the history of the movies,” to which the Hollywood Reporter‘s Mike Connolly enthusiastically concurred (qtd. in Wiley and Bona 246). So far, so good. Furthermore, as Scott Schechter reports in his book Judy Garland: The Day by Day Chronicle of a Legend (2002), a reviewer for Time proclaimed that with A Star is Born, Garland had effectively nailed “the greatest one-woman show” in all of Hollywood moviedom (qtd 197), but that statement can be read more than one way, meaning it might not be a compliment, considering A Star is Born, or almost any movie, really, is hardly a solo enterprise.\n\nWhen Garland lost the Oscar, no less than Groucho Marx famously harrumphed that it was the biggest robbery since the Brinks job (qtd in Wiley and Bona 254). Whoa. That’s some kind of heavy-duty robbery, Mr. Marx. To this day, cinephiles, Oscar enthusiasts, and Garland fans still harrumph.\n\nI’m not sure I agree with Marx and the other harrumph-ers. Call me a heretic if you wish, but I actually think the right actress won the Oscar that year.\n\nBacking up a bit, in 1953 Grace Kelly was still a relative acting novice with a smattering of stage, TV, and film credits, including the high profile role of young bride to marked lawman Gary Cooper in 1952’s taut Western drama High Noon (for which Cooper won his second Oscar). Not much of a role, but Kelly proved her mettle and moved on to Mogambo, alongside luminaries Clark Gable and Ava Gardner. Incredibly, Mogambo was actually a remake of Gable’s own Red Dust (1932), in which “the King” shared the screen with Jean Harlow and Mary Astor. Stepping into the role originally played by Astor, Kelly caught the attention of the Academy, earning a Best Supporting Actress nomination–in addition to a Golden Globe. She lost that first Oscar race, btw, to Donna Reed in From Here to Eternity. Fair enough, but Kelly was only getting started.\n\n1954 was the year in which Kelly proved her star wattage. In The Country Girl she held her own against the likes of previous Best Actor winners Bing Crosby and William Holden. In a scenario somewhat similar to that of A Star is Born, Kelly plays the dutiful, deceptively mousey wife of an alcoholic, has-been actor (Crosby) attempting a comeback in a play directed by Holden’s character. The whole enterprise soon becomes a contest of wills for all three leads with Crosby, as is likely for a chronic substance abuser, playing one side (Kelly) against the other (Holden); moreover, The Country Girl was only one of Kelly’s three hit films in 1954 [2]. The remaining two were both directed by the then highly popular “Master of Suspense,” Alfred Hitchcock: first-up was Dial M for Murder, effectively filmed in 3-D, and then came the enduring undeniably classic Rear Window.\n\nThose in the pro-Judy/Anti-Grace contingent regarding the 1954 Oscars often carp that Kelly won not so much for acting, per se, but for, again, playing against type, going mousey, playing down her glam looks in favor of a drab hair do, shapeless sweaters, and little or no makeup. Sometimes wearing less than flattering glasses; sometimes not (Matthews 189; Peary 126) [3]. All in Black and White, btw. Throw in a calculated emotional outburst or two, a few tears, and Kelly wins an Oscar, right? I don’t think so. That’s almost too easy, and it ignores the powerful dynamics at play in The Country Girl, which, per this viewer (and keep in mind, I grew up around addiction), includes possibly the truest portrait of a substance abuser I can recall. Crosby, in an Oscar nominated turn (same as Mr. Mason in the Garland film) is eerily convincing as someone who uses passive-aggression to serve his own interests. In his own way, Crosby is so good that he’s downright ghastly. And Kelly has to keep up with that. I tend to think of Kelly in The Country Girl (which I first saw on TV, maybe PBS, back in the early 90s), in the same way I think of Helen Hunt and her Oscar winning turn in 1997’s As Good as it Gets, opposite hammy Jack Nicholson. Basically, the success of both actresses is that they give as good as they get, so to speak, in the presence of co-stars who might have easily devoured them.\n\nAgain, The Country Girl is only part of the story as Kelly worked in back-to-back productions for Hitchcock. In Dial M for Murder, she portrayed a woman on trial for a crime that both she and the audience know was self-defense. What she and the authorities don’t know is that her attacker was hired by Kelly’s jealous, fortune seeking husband, but his plans for a so-called “perfect murder” go horribly wrong. A frame-up seems the next best thing. In Rear Window, she scored as James Stewart’s fashionable steady turned would-be sleuth. As with Dial M for Murder, Rear Window was an instant hit that thrilled audiences and took its place as one of the year’s top box office earners. As well, please note that in the weeks and months leading up to the Oscars, Kelly nabbed honors for all three films (The Country Girl and the two Hitchcock offerings) from both the National Board of Review as well as the New York Film Critics Circle. Furthermore, Kelly also claimed a Golden Globe–for Best Actress in a Drama. With that in mind, please remember that the Academy–whether explicitly stated–aims to honor achievement when handing out its annual awards, and Kelly provided that opportunity, all wrapped in quite a pretty package.\n\nBack to Garland. While reviews for her performance in A Star is Born brimmed with praise galore, and she also nabbed the Globe in her category, the project while stunning in many regards serves more as a personal triumph for its star rather than as an across-the-board achievement. Consider that the film’s production was fraught with delays and cost overruns, partially due to interference from Warner execs but an echo, as well, of Garland’s MGM travails (Eastman 325; Matthews 813). Such woes don’t escape the Hollywood grapevine, rest assured. Next, the finished film originally ran a hefty three hours, presenting a marketing challenge. Sure there are always exceptions, most notably at that time Gone with the Wind (clocking in at close to 4 hours), but movies with lengthy running times can only be shown easily 2-3 times a day rather than 5-6, especially in single screen theatres–the norm in the 1950s. Still, Hollywood has always been an industry town, and as is so often the case with many businesses, all is mostly forgiven if and when the coffers fill. Therein lies the problem with A Star is Born. Simply, the film was hardly a roaring success at the box office. As oft reported, the story goes something like this. When the returns failed to match all sky-high expectations, the first move was to re-edit the film to a more manageable length though that only made the movie shorter without necessarily improving its performance. The effects of all this Scissorhands-ing, if you buy into the myth, is that given the film’s disappointing performance Warner nixed the idea of sinking money, that is, more money, into an Oscar campaign. Furthermore, the frequent charge is that those Academy members who bothered paying any attention to A Star is Born made their judgment based on the re-edited version, with as many as 30 minutes worth of Garland’s best scenes scrapped, abandoned on the cutting room floor; thus, the race is thrown in Kelly’s favor (Peary 126-127).\n\nIf one buys the myth.\n\nTherein lies the problem. 30 minutes more of Garland would have only made her movie longer–as Ronald Haver’s famously cobbled together restoration (dating back to 1983) attests. Here is where the whole proposition gets tricky. I do not want to go so far as to suggest that Garland merely plays herself in A Star is Born. No, I believe she is fully invested, fully believable each and every second, and that she hits all the right notes, emotionally, that is, but the concern is that Garland is doing nothing in A Star is Born that she hasn’t–hadn’t–already done in her previous films. The difference is that she does so on a much grander scale For example, is Garland in drag as a tattered newsboy singing “Lose that Long Face” such a big stretch from her and Fred Astaire’s “A Couple of Swells” hobo routine in Easter Parade? For all Garland’s big powerful moments, of which A Star is Born–at any length–is jam-packed, the performance isn’t as shaped, as nuanced, as her splendid turn in The Wizard of Oz, in which the audience falls in love with her Dorothy without being beaten over the head with cues about how worthy she is of being loved. Again, Garland is always well-worth watching, but the shortcomings, the limitations, of her performance might be forgiven if, well, if A Star is Born were a better–more balanced–picture, but it is too singularly conceived as a testament to Garland’s gosh-darn, misty-eyed exuberance as a performer, per the overblown “Born in a Trunk” number (directed by choreographer Richard Barstow, as sources indicate, well after director George Cukor wrapped production [4]) rather than as a love story equally weighted between its two leads but as has often been noted, the material is weighted such that the audience is cued to react to Garland’s suffering as she watches helplessly while Mason unravels. In other words, the emphasis is on how she suffers because of him rather than how his demons affect him and how he suffers accordingly (Kael 240-241) [5]. Garland ripping into “The Man Who Got Away” is magic. If only the film had ended there. Garland enacting a scene in which her character wins an Oscar, only to be humiliated in the process by Mason, is overkill. Since she played a role in developing the project, she shoulders some responsibility for a nagging sense of self-indulgence. [To clarify, yes, “Lose that Long Face” was one of the items cut in the re-edit, but even in the shortened version Garland is still seen having a moment in the tattered newsboy garb, and it still registers as familiar, per the earlier bit with Astaire in Easter Parade.]\n\nBack to Kelly. No, her performance in The Country Girl, isn’t as big and colorful–literally–as Garland’s, but does it represent a more significant achievement, all things considered? How about this? How about that Kelly’s achievement is the triumph of versatility in a year of one success after the next? Remember: two high profile organizations honored her for work in multiple films. Furthermore, per Tom O’Neil, in its final week Variety‘s straw poll clearly favored Kelly over Garland (174). And The Country Girl, tellingly, was a Best Picture contender. Okay, but maybe you believe it shouldn’t work that way? That the award should go to the nominated performance, per se, rather than special consideration for “body of work” stuff. Okay, so let me amend my original claim by specifying that the right actress won the 1954 Oscar, but for the wrong film.\n\nIf Kelly had won for Rear Window, I don’t think we’d even be talking about any of this anymore. As a friend of mine recently noted, Grace Kelly achieves perfection in Rear Window. How so? Without actually playing a movie star, she gets to be both a star and a consummate actress. That’s quite a feat. Hitchcock became so enamored of Kelly during production of Dial M for Murder that he decided to feature her prominently in his follow-up, based on the story “It had to be Murder” by Cornell Woolrich (writing under the pseudonym “William Irish”). As the scenario unfolds, a temporarily laid-up photographer (James Stewart) becomes suspicious of activity he spies in the apartment across the courtyard from his own. Kelly, in a role created especially for the film, plays his glamorous, devoted, and socially well-connected girlfriend. She’s head over heels, but Stewart has doubts. His occupation as a globe trotting photojournalist dictates that his assignments often come without much warning and require him to live by his wits under extreme conditions in far-flung locales for weeks and months at a time. He can’t imagine that Kelly’s elegant “Lisa Freemont” could keep up with his demanding lifestyle. To Jeffries, Lisa is far too preoccupied with her career in fashion and hobnobbing with newspaper columnists and assorted Manhattan swells, but Lisa is made of sterner, and far more adventurous, stuff than her cool exterior suggests.\n\nIn his directive to Rear Window costumer Edith Head, Hitchcock stressed that Kelly should be presented as though she were a fine piece of Dresden china (qtd. in Humphries 120; McGilligan 488). But that’s a bit of an illusion. Yes, Kelly makes one heck of a stunning entrance in Rear Window, outfitted in black and white, cinched at the waist, dripping with black beaded vines–or feathers–atop layers and layers of white chiffon and tulle. And , yes, Hitchcock frames her in ravishing close-up, replete with silken blonde hair, irresistible gaze, and ruby lips. Let the fun begin. Over the course of the film, however, Lisa demonstrates that she is much more than a delicate fixture as she matches wits with Stewart’s “L.B. Jefferies,” his detective friend (Wendell Corey), a police squad, and, yes, a cold-blooded murderer (Raymond Burr). She scales the courtyard and places herself in danger in order to retrieve evidence that will convince the police that a crime has indeed occurred when the initial investigation proves inconclusive.\n\nStewart’s character may very well serve as the audience surrogate in Rear Window as we see the story unspool from his perspective–but make no mistake, it is Kelly who asserts herself as the story’s dynamic hero. Interestingly, even with all the changes the audience sees in Lisa as the story progresses, she never loses her identity. She is still Lisa. She has not reinvented herself to accommodate Jeffries or to prove a point. That remains incidental. Instead, she shows herself to be more resourceful, more complex, than her seemingly more seasoned boyfriend could ever imagine. And he digs it, but Lisa remains her own woman, not a fixture. Again, Kelly manages to be both actress and movie star.\n\nOf course, no one thinks of big emotionally demonstrative speechifying scenes in a Hitchcock film. Certainly not, so Kelly’s role in Rear Window, in all its vibrancy, pales next to the histrionics of The Country Girl, but that’s what also makes Rear Window a richer experience. Consider that though Hitchcock periodically shifts the camera to visually eavesdrop on the activities of those who live in proximity to Stewart’s digs, much of the verbal exchanges are solely between Stewart and Kelly–and, again, all within the confines of Stewart’s relatively cramped living space. The spotlight, so to speak, is squarely on the two leads, and they have to be on-point. This is where Kelly most impresses, not in her ability to spar with Stewart, though there’s plenty of that–and it’s exciting–but in the way she seems genuinely invested in listening, in reacting. Moreover, in its talkiness Rear Window asks an audience to listen attentively through a number of shifts in tone. One minute Kelly and Stewart are hurling quips and accusations in a battle of the sexes; then, they’re almost ghoulish players in a macabre comedy of manners, that is, before the talk becomes philosophical, and Kelly admonishes the both of them for being disappointed that the man they’ve been spying on might NOT have committed a crime, to which she adds that she’s certainly not an expert on “rear window ethics.” This is the challenge for viewers. Of course, that’s Hitchcock’s genius though the two leads so fully inhabit their roles that audiences are willing to follow. Think about it, a movie designed with the inherent limitations of a self-contained world (an apartment and only that which can be seen beyond the back window) featuring a key performance by a glamorous movie star that doesn’t “read” as a performance but as a progression. Now that’s an achievement.\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\n[1] The highly lauded 1937 original, starring Oscar nominees Fredric March and Janet Gaynor, with a screenplay co-written by Alan Campbell and Dorothy Parker (and award worthy Technicolor cinematography), owes a great deal to 1932’s What Price Hollywood, starring Constance Bennett and Lowell Sherman. The common link between those two films is producer David O. Selznick; meanwhile, George Cukor of What Price Hollywood? was hired to direct the Garland version in 1954. Furthermore, in the 1970s no less than Barbra Streisand co-produced a rock-n-roll themed update with her then s.o., Jon Peters–and won an Oscar not for acting but for for co-composing the movie’s love theme (“Evergreen”) along with Paul Williams.\n\n[2] Technically, Kelly starred in a 4th pic that year, Green Fire, opposite Stewart Granger, a flick that made almost no impact and may have very well been a contractual obligation for the actress in exchange for high profile loan-outs.\n\n[3] I take tremendous exception to Charles Matthews’ claim that Kelly’s Oscar for The Country Girl came essentially for the effort that went into the performance rather than the “real acting” exhibited by Garland in her film (189). Yeah, I get it. The effort is definitely on display in Kelly’s offering, but what I see is that Kelly’s effort is in service of a character far removed from her poised persona and that is surely worth as much as Garland’s go-for-broke comeback vehicle.\n\n[4] The film-buff world is apparently divided into two camps: those who marvel at “Born in a Trunk,” and those, such as me, who find it distracting. While thrilling in its use of color, design, and wide-screen camera setups, not to mention Garland’s raw talent, it runs far too long and disrupts the narrative flow. Plus, as noted in multiple sources, it contributed to the film’s already bloated budget though it might have seemed like a good idea at the time given the era’s preoccupation with filling movie screens with spectacle in order to lure audiences away from their television sets; moreover, similarly conceived production numbers, such as the one in 1951’s Best Picture winner An American in Paris, had achieved the desired effect by most accounts.\n\n[5] Kael’s complaint is directed at both Garland’s ’54 incarnation and Barbra Streisand’s “rock musical” take, opposite Kris Kristofferson, in 1976, widely panned but hugely popular nonetheless. This prompts further exploration, if not criticism, in that the title is A Star is Born, but both Garland and Streisand were already well-established not as mere talents but mega-talents, with devoted followings, so where is the joy of discovery, the element of awe, for audiences in seeing that talent uncovered and nurtured before taking its rightful place in the spotlight? Especially, that is, when Streisand, like Garland, had an active role in developing her project?\n\nWorks Cited\n\nEastman, John. Retakes: Behind the Scenes of 500 Classic Movies.

A lot of the latter for sure. Per the IMDb, between 1956’s Love Me Tender and 1969’s Change of Habit (w/Mary Tyler Moore as a nun of all things), Elvis made a total of 31 feature films. He was in the military for part of that stretch in the ’50s, meaning most of the films were made in the 1960s. As popular as they were, a lot of Elvis’s movies were awful: formulaic, rushed through production–sometimes as many as three a year–and increasingly filmed on the cheap in order to maximize profits. Even so, we all have our favorites and not without reason. For example, Jailhouse Rock features that amazing musical number featuring the title track while the generally acclaimed King Creole boasts no less than Casablanca‘s Michael Curtiz sitting in the director’s chair and source material by Harold Robbins.\n\nWhen I was a child I was crazy about Fun in Acapulco, which I first remember seeing in a theatre, though Viva Las Vegas long reigned as my absolute favorite. What’s not to love, right? Elvis meets Ann-Margret in one of the most smokin’ hot romantic pairings in screen history: she sizzles, he smolders. These two really brought out the best in each other, especially when singing and dancing though Elvis’s fiercely protective manager, Colonel Tom Parker, kept Ms. Margret in-check on that count lest she upstage Mr. Presley; after all, Elvis was somewhat out of his comfort zone, working for MGM rather than Paramount, per usual. Plus, Viva Las Vegas was directed by George Sidney, who catapulted Ann-Margret to major stardom with 1963’s Bye Bye Birdie, so, yes, the colonel micro-managed the production from behind the scenes in order to protect his star’s rep. Still, even with limited interaction in musical sequences, Elvis and A.M. are sexy as all get-out. In spades. Yet as fab as Ann-Margret and the King were, they only made one film together, no doubt the doing of Colonel Parker though the two stars remained close throughout the years.\n\nElvis’s most frequent leading lady was no less than popular TV star and sometime pop-singer Shelley Fabares. Famous for her role on The Donna Reed Show and her #1 hit, “Johnny Angel,” Fabares shared the screen with Elvis three times: Girl Happy, Spinout, and Clambake. Clearly, they enjoy rapport though the movies aren’t anything special, but at least Fabares fared better than the likes of such co-stars as Moore, Nancy Sinatra (Speedway), and Mary Ann Mobley (Harum Scarum), the latter being the dregs of the dregs.\n\nMeanwhile, I have a soft spot for Blue Hawaii mainly because I practically melt when I hear “Can’t Help Falling in Love with You,” which a dear friend sang–beautifully–when I was escorted down the aisle at my wedding oh so many years ago. Of course, one surprising downside is that the Academy snubbed that particular tune while Grammy voters found the soundtrack worthy of a nod. Another downside to Blue Hawaii is that poor Angela Lansbury was barely 10 years older than Elvis when she was cast as his mother, so there’s a casting credibility issue. Luckily, Lansbury redeemed herself from that thankless task by going for the gusto as Laurence Harvey’s politically ambitious mother in The Manchurian Candidate though, wait for it, Lansbury was only three years older than Laurence Harvey, the man who played her son; she then set her sights on Broadway with Mame, and the rest is history, but I digress. Still, Blue Hawaii was a major success and cast the mold for Presley’s subsequent films: exotic locales, fun in the sun, lots of girls, and plenty of music. Indeed, Blue Hawaii was followed in short order by Girls! Girls! Girls!, which like its predecessor was filmed on location and followed the now familiar formula.\n\nSo it came to pass that in the deepest darkest days of this past winter, Michael and I happened upon Girls! Girls! Girls! one night, presumably on Turner Classic Movies, and I was instantly captivated. By an Elvis movie. Oh sure, I’d seen it as child (probably at a drive-in), and I easily remembered parts of it, but I had no memory of how revved up with color it was, and is. I mean this is one bright sunny movie, perfect for obliterating winter doldrums, but also a nice summer lark after a long day at the office. See, as I watched that frosty winter evening, I also turned to the IMDb to learn some behind-the-scenes particulars, and what I found is that Girls! Girls! Girls! is in fact the only Elvis movie, the only one, to ever be nominated for a Golden Globe, and, yes, that surprised me. Oh, okay, it’s not like a Globe is the same thing as an Oscar, everybody knows that, but I also thought that Elvis’s popularity would render a Globe nod a no-brainer, especially for some of the classier entries, such as Viva Las Vegas, King Creole, Flaming Star, and a precious few others.\n\nTo clarify, in the case of Girls! Girls! Girls!, the GG nomination was for the film as a whole: Best Motion Picture Musical; not surprisingly, it lost to The Music Man in a competition that also included Gypsy and Billy Rose’s Jumbo (starring Doris Day), all of which I actually enjoy. To further clarify, Elvis’s name frequently appeared on the Laurel award honor roll, voted by theatre owners and managers via the trade mag, Motion Picture Exhibitors: second place for Girls! Girls! Girls!; third place for Viva Las Vegas. He actually won for Tickle Me, the only acting award of his career. Really? I fully confess that I used to watch Tickle Me whenever it aired on the old late show, and enjoyed it immensely as a kind of mystery/comedy even though it retains a large cheese quotient. (Backing up to Blue Hawaii, it finished 4th in the Laurel voting for Best Musical.)\n\nBack to Girls x 3. What’s so special about this one? First, as noted, the colors provide an amazing and welcome sensory jolt, and by the colors, I really mean one color specifically, blue: blue skies, blue waters, and even co-stars Laurel Goodwin and Stella Stevens attired in shockingly blue outfits–designed by no less than the illustrious Edith Head [1]. Even the doors in Elvis’s rival’s office are intensely blue. Right? It’s like Blue Hawaii only bluer. The cinematography, btw, is credited to no less than Loyal Griggs, a multiple Oscar nominee and, in fact, a winner for 1953’s magnificent Shane [2].\n\nInterestingly, and in contrast to Fun in Acapulco, Elvis ventured to Hawaii for the shoot. Apparently, security concerns kept him from making the trip to sunny Mexico for the later movie. Now, this is important because Fun in Acapulco is clearly cobbled from location shots with stunt doubles (or a stunt double), and studio trickery including some obvious process shots, also known as rear projection, also known as the precursor to blue and green screen technologies [3]. Oh, there are still plenty of process shots in Girls! Girls! Girls! as Elvis’s character spends plenty of time in a fishing boat out on the water; however, there is just enough of actual location footage to help suspend disbelief, especially since the process stuff is actually pretty clever, almost seamless, compared to, say, the same era’s Beach Party flicks, some of which were also directed by Norman Taurog [4]. The process shots are also more persuasive than those of Elvis and Ann-Margret water-skiing in Viva Las Vegas, which are kind of obvious and lame.\n\nGirls! Girls! Girls! also contains a couple of swell musical numbers. A lot of the songs in Elvis movies are and were forgettable, mere filler to justify a soundtrack album as well as to compensate for skimpy scripts. Oh, there are a few such lackluster ditties in G!G!G!, but two in particular rise above the rest. First and foremost would have to be “Return to Sender,” a genuine Elvis classic that was actually recorded for the film (as opposed to a convenient retread). The other number is an especially imaginative tango, of all things, set in the teeny bachelorette apartment of Presley’s newest squeeze, played by Laurel Goodwin. The whole scene is a pip because Elvis actually prepares and serves dinner even though it’s the girl’s place, but that’s just the beginning. Presley and Goodwin cap their evening with the ingeniously conceived “The Walls Have Ears,” which finds the pair dancing amid noisy neighbors and rattling walls. Truly, it must be seen to be believed, and I won’t spoil it by including a clip. Go find it and watch it for yourself. You’ll probably be delighted in a way you might not have imagined–especially if it’s been 20, 30, or 40 years since you last saw it. Credit for the staging of this ditty belongs to choreographer Charles O’Curran whose credits include G.I. Blues, also with Presley, and Bells are Ringing.\n\nSo, when I ask myself, what was it about Girls! Girls! Girls! that prompted the Hollywood Foreign Press to nominate it for Golden Globe–after I rule out bribes by the suits at Paramount–the answers I find most satisfactory are the lush cinematography and/or production values, and a few nifty musical numbers. Plus, the movie was a big hit, of course. Also, Elvis works hard to give a real performance. What’s that, you say? I’ve spent the past week or so reading reviews of ALL Elvis movies by a number of seasoned Elvis fans/bloggers, and one frequent complaint is that he plays a character who is quite unlikeable at times. Yes, I agree. His “Ross Carpenter,” a down on his luck fisherman with both girl troubles and money woes, isn’t always nice, and what a great challenge for Elvis or any actor. How did the Colonel let this one get past his Elvis image gauge? In many movies, Elvis played characters that seemed stamped out of cardboard, characters that seemed to exist only to curry favor with audiences as though Presley could not manage that on his own. Another favorite scene, set on a lanai during a late night rainstorm, shows a softer side of Elvis, a sweetness and vulnerability that didn’t find its way into his later movies. Another plus.\n\nOf course, we’re still in the fantasy realm of Elvis, not, say, Lawrence of Arabia, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Longest Day, The Miracle Worker, or The Manchurian Candidate, all of them released the same year. One of the most glaring flaws is, of course, racism in the form of exoticizing the locals, especially a pair of sisters–wee youngsters of Chinese descent. Played by real-life siblings, Elizabeth Tiu and Ginny Tiu, these are some adorable moppets, but their very “differentness” seems exaggerated to the point of rendering them as barely more than show-biz pets or dolls if you get my drift, something less than human. You know, the way clumsy American tourists make a fuss over “native” children. At any rate, what played as cute in the early 1960s registers most differently in a presumably more culturally enlightened era though, to clarify, it’s not Elvis, per se, who treats the girls condescendingly; it’s the filmmakers who are to blame. Oh, well, at least the girls get to do something. Not so Stella Stevens, wasted in the nothing role of a catty one-time fling, that is, ex-fling, who just can’t seem to let go. She drains the energy out of almost every exchange but puts over a sultry night club number or two, and she looks swell. Goodwin hardly fares better. She’s a good sport, but she lacks pizzazz. It’s no wonder that, per the IMDb, her acting career was relatively short-lived.\n\nPoor Elvis. Well, sort of. He truly was a victim of his own success. Reportedly, he hated many of his own films and yearned for a chance to prove he had it in him to be a great film actor rather than a merely passable one. The trouble wasn’t really with him but rested with that damn Colonel Parker. The legend is that Elvis was considered for the male lead in 1961’s blockbuster adaptation of West Side Story, but the colonel didn’t feel it was the right vehicle for his star, what with gangs and knives–not to mention the fact that Elvis would have had to share the screen with a huge cast of actors, singers, and dancers that might have pulled focus. Nothin’ doin’. Of course, West Side Story was a box office blockbuster that also scored big at the Oscars, taking awards in 10 categories, including Best Picture and Best Director–shared, in an Academy first, by Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins (though the latter, hired specifically for the dance sequences, was dismissed midway through production, but I digress). Several years after quitting films with Change of Habit, Elvis was approached as a possibility to play the doomed rock star in Barbra Streisand’s remake of A Star is Born, but, once again, Parker intervened on behalf of his client, reportedly with a list of demands that did not set so well with Babs who was also one of the film’s producers. Instead, the role went to rugged country singer-songwriter and sometime actor Kris Kristofferson who at least temporarily reinvented himself as a sexy leading man. A year after A Star is Born, Elvis passed away at the age of 42. Only 42, a legend in his time, no doubt, but also a study in unrealized potential and a mass of contradictions. Maybe he could have built on the potential he showed in his early films, but he allowed himself to be manipulated by someone who stubbornly resisted opportunities for real growth.\n\nStill, as Girls! Girls! Girls! proves, not all of Elvis’s many, MANY, films were mindless failures. Indeed, as I came home today to finish the article, I turned on the TV and found King Creole on the second or third channel I selected, most likely TCM yet again. More good stuff, including gorgeous black and white cinematography, New Orleans location footage, and a fascinating sequence set in the rain. As much a treat in the summer as Girls! Girls! Girls! was in the winter. Maybe it really is good to be the King after all.\n\nThanks for your consideration…\n\nElvis at the Internet Movie Database http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000062/?ref_=nv_sr_1\n\n[1] For the uninitiated, in her illustrious career Head racked up a whopping 35 Oscar nods (in both color and black & white categories), taking home a total of 8 statuettes, a record for both a woman and a costume designer.
