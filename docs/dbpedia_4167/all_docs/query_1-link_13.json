Considered talented as well as beautiful, she starred in short comedies opposite such actors as Charlie Chase, ZaSu Pitts , and Patsy Kelly , and in feature films with the Marx Brothers, Laurel and Hardy, Buster Keaton, and Bing Crosby. Todd was at the height of her career when she died under mysterious circumstances in 1935. After her body was found in her garage slumped over the steering wheel of her parked car, her death was ruled a suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. But several details suggested foul play, including the fact that facial injuries indicated Todd had been in a struggle. A later inquest rejected the suicide ruling but found insufficient evidence to deem her death a murder.\n\nMany suspected that Todd's lover, movie director Ronald West, may have had reason to want the actress out of his life. The couple owned a café and restaurant, and Todd had obtained for West considerable sums of money to run the business. In addition, she had recently embarked on a secret affair with a San Francisco businessman. On the night before Todd died, witnesses heard her and West in the midst of a bitter argument. Though West was never charged with murder, enduring suspicions against him destroyed his career. He never directed another film.\n\nAlso suspected in Todd's death was the gangster Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano. After Todd had refused to consent to his scheme to open an illegal gambling casino in the café she owned with West, the actress began to receive anonymous death threats. Some suggested that Luciano may have ordered a hit man to kill Todd. No evidence was found to prove this theory, however. Though it appears clear that Todd's death was a murder and not a suicide, the exact circumstances of her last moments have never been determined.\n\nsources:\n\nKatz, Ephraim. The Film Encyclopedia.
