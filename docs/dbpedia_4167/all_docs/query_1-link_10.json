        "text": "This could have one of the better Hal Roach comedies… it had that (lack of) sophistication and attention to detail. For RKO though this felt a bit messy. However I always like Ben Lyon, Walter Catlett seemed to be having a blast, and all it really needed anyway was a drunk Pert Kelton doing an extended fan dance. That makes it automatically 3 stars!\n\nPlus, nice shots of Glendale’s Grand Central Air Terminal.\n\nI actually don't remember most of what happened in this other than Mercedes McCambridge always plays the best power lesbian.\n\nSilly comedy/mystery that features a miscast Ben Lyon in the lead. He has a tough time keeping up with a great supporting cast all doing what they do best. Pert Kelton, Fred Kelsey, Walter Catlett and Jonathan Hale are all good as usual but a special shout-out to Chick Chandler and Republic serial mainstay John Davidson who go above and beyond the tepid script. Unfortunately, the lovely Thelma Todd has little to do in this except look lovely.\n\nThe drunken fan dance was funny, the actress playing Aunt Jane was tiresome but probably because I’m partial to Billie Burke in such roles. The reward for watching this movie was the filler material that aired afterward, the TCM spotlight of found footage and restoration of Lime Kiln Club Field Day from 1913 and its lead Bert Williams."
