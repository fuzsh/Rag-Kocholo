        "text": "As the curtains opened on the 333rd show of Avagha rang ekachi zala (The Unisonof Colours) on August 15,producer Anant Panshikar, 58, was a proud man. \"I struggled to bring people in to the theatre for the first 50 shows,? says Panshikar the owner of the city-based Natyasampada, company, a leading producer of Marathi plays. After the initial lull, this play caught on and travelled across the country and to the United States in 2009, clocking over 300 shows. And with this, Panshikar andhis company revived the longforgotten genre of the sangeet natak, something that mostcommercial producers were wary of attempting. Since he took over the reins of Natyasampada, a group his uncle Prabhakar Panshikar had founded 60-years-ago, he has experimented with new genres and revived decades-old popular scripts. Even as new commercial plays were setting the cash registers ringing, Panshikar, an ardent fan of the classics, went into a revival mode in 2008bringing back to the stage longforgotten plays. \"The classics have excellent plots and beautiful lyricallanguage, which we hardly hear these days. That is what makes them stand out amidst a flurry of new talent and scripts,? he says. First in line was Samuel Beckett's highly acclaimed abstract play Waiting for Godot, in which Panshikar roped in actor Tom Alter for the first time on Marathi stage in 2008. He even stageda show at Mumbai's Arthur Road jail for inmates. Deviating from the traditional Natyasampada school of musical and historical plays, Panshikar went on to producea folk play Viccha Majhi Poori Kara before digging out scripts byeminent playwrights such as P L Deshpande, Vasant Kanetkarand Acharya Atre."
