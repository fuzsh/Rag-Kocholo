Hemant Pendse is one of the leading vocalists in the realm of Hindustani classical music. After receiving his initial training from late Shri. Manohar Betavadkar, he had the privilege of learning under none other than the great Guru, composer, and musician late Padmashri Pt. Jeetendra Abhisheki for a considerable long period of twenty years. Trained in the Gurukul system of learning, he imbibed the essence of the Jaipur-Agra Gayaki from Panditji. He has been equally fortunate to have an in-depth guidance from the doyen of Agra gharana late Pt. Babanrao Haldankar. Currently he is seeking guidance from Pt. Vikas Kashalkar of the Kirana-Gwalior tradition. Blessed with a very mellifluous voice, Hemant Pendseâs repertoire includes Khyal, Thumri, Dadra, devotional, and Marathi light music. Over a considerable period of time, he has been successful in applying the essence of his Gurusâ training while creating his own aesthetic principles in his gayaki. This is also reflected in his compositions in Khyal and devotional music. He has composed a number of bandishes in Khyal music and has given thematic concerts. He has also conceived, directed, and performed in thematic concerts, such as Abhangvarsha, Guruvandana, and Ek Radha Ek Meera. He also has several albums to his credit. His compositions have been appreciated by senior vocalists and music directors, including the noted Marathi music director, Pt. Shrinivas Khale. Popular vocalists like Smt. Devaki Pandit, Pt.

He has had the privilege of performing twice in the prestigious Sawai Gandharwa Mahotsav, Pune.

He is a B High grade vocalist and also a Grade 1 composer of A.I.R. Nevertheless, he is equally aware of his social responsibility as an artist. He is one of the few musicians that have taken up the cause of spreading awareness about classical music in the masses and has conceived of a series of concerts titled âClub Kansenâ, which aims at music appreciation of Khyal music. Another angle of his musical responsibility is to pass on the tradition of music to the next generation and has played a major role as a Guru. He is enlisted as a Guru on the panel of Lalit Kala Kendra, Pune University and has also conducted workshops regarding the same. Some of his students are now establishing themselves as musicians. In spite of achieving popularity in music and essaying the role of a performer, composer, and Guru, he is firmly rooted to ground and aspires for a deeper study in Sur and Laya.\n\nThe life journey of CA Shri. Bhushan Toshniwal serves as an inspiration to one and all. Despite having lost eyesight when he was merely 20 days old, he went on to achieve some greatness through dedication and determination, which only a very few would achieve in spite of disability. He is a child prodigy, who sang 5 raagas at the age of 5 and performed at the prestigious Savai Gandharva Mahotsav Kundgol at the age of 7, only to be blessed by Padmavibhushan Gangubai Hangal and Bharat Ratna Pt.

His gurus include the likes of Padmashri Anup Jalota, Padmashri Padmaja Fenani Jogalekar, Dr. Vikas Kashalkar, Ustad Rashid Khan, and Jayalakshmi Krishnamurti. He had to face many rejections in his life as people remained sceptical about his abilities. As a result, he had to face severe hardships in terms of getting admission in schools/colleges, finding a guru for music, and finding brail/audio books for commerce stream, etc. However, only due to his strong will-power, hard work, efforts to strive for perfection, never give-up attitude, and the ability to make the best of available resources, he has managed to reach great heights in the fields of academics, music and motivational speaking. As a result, along with CA, he possesses 6 other post graduate degrees in music, business management, and insurance. He has also given motivational speeches all over India in various CA conferences, companies, and colleges. He is the winner of the reality show Takdhinadhin, and a semi-finalist at SaaReGaMaPa and Maharashtra Sangeet Ratna. He performs both Hindustani classical and Carnatik classical as well as semi-classical music. He is also a graded artist of radio and Doordarshan. He has received many awards including, Swami Vivekanand Puraskar, Swami Dayanand Saraswati Puraskar, Yuva Gaurav, Rashtra Gaurav, Dnyanaratna, Swarabhushan, and the National Role Model Award from His Excellency the President Of India.\n\nSangeetacharya Dr. Mohankumar Darekar is one of todayâs widely acclaimed performers, gifted with a powerful, well trained voice that traverses with ease over three octaves, while displaying perfect diction, purity in sur and a very good command over tala and laya allowing him to create complex and rhythmically very attractive tana and sargam combinations. His very personal style is a beautiful blend mainly of the Agra and Jaipur Gharanas, accented by elements of Banaras and Gwalior Gharanas - a style which, by giving expression to intense bhakti, touches the souls of all his listeners. For over 15 years he has received systematic training under his illustrious Guruji, the late Pandit Jitendra Abhisheki. For his Ph.

Ramesh Chandra Dutt, who himself was a product of the prestigious Gandharv Mahavidyalaya at Lahore, established by Pt. Vishnu Digamber Paluskar. Aditya's training continued at home under the daily guidance of his parents who are accomplished musicians - Dr. Arvind Sharma, Professor at Panjab University and Mrs. Anita Sharma, Principal at Gandharv Mahavidyalaya, Panchkula.

Apoorva Gokhale has carved a niche for herself as one of the sought after well-known vocalists of the younger generation with a firm background of Gwalior Gharana. She has an impressive musical lineage and has proudly and responsibly inherited the musical qualities from her grandfather, the late Gayanacharya Pt. Gajananrao Joshi and her great- grandfather Pt. Antubua Joshi, an eminent court musician in the erstwhile state of Aundh, district Satara. At a very tender age of five, she initially received a sound grooming from her grandfather Pt.

She brings to Khyal singing an expression which, both lyrical and evocative at the same time, maintains the seriousness of the form, unimpaired. Her coherent presentation of khyal is an aesthetic blending of imaginative alaap, an improvisation in a sonorous and scintillating voice, gracefully weaving exquisite patterns of swaras, unfolding the image of the raga with all its beauty and dignity, combined with an innate sense of laya (rhythm). She judiciously gives equal importance to both gayaki (style) and purity of raga rendition.\n\nShri.

Even though there are few others whose dedicated efforts have been well recognized and appreciated at highest levels, it is characteristically distinct approach to harmonium playing which position Dr. Sudhanshu on a different and worthy footing.\n\nA commerce graduate and diploma holder in personal management, Dr. Sudhanshu took to music when he was ten years old with initial inspiration coming from a latent musical environment at home. He was identified as a child prodigy mix-way through his training in fundamentals of classical music including vocal and tabla under Late Appasaheb Laxman Sakhalkar. Six years later, he went into the tutelage of Pt. Rambhau K. Bijapure one of the noteworthy harmonium maestros of the time and a great 'guru' under whose able guidance Dr. Sudhanshu's musical personality was moulded.

Patwardhan of Vadodara.\n\nDr. Sudhanshu's natural inclination to render solo harmonium inspired him to ensure recognition to solo harmonium playing from music lovers, connoisseurs and critics. Despite certain limitations in harmonium, it is easy to play but difficult to render in individual capacity at advance level, but through a dedicated approach and back breaking riyaz under the able taleem from his guru, his creative instinct got shaped into a highly distinguished musical repertoire, so much that he has carved a niche for himself as an eminent harmonium player and stands tall along with other renowned contemporaries.

His fluency in classical music comes through a deep involvement and understanding of both physics and philosophy of raga as well as the instrument when he is with the instrument, the reeds get poetic, statement with a degree of musical sense and all his faculties cascade into a true musical melody. His experimentation to reduce the bulk of the present conventional harmonium and using diatonic mode is a matter of convenience as it provides versatility. He believes that as an accompaniment, his role is to adore and embellish performance of the main performer on stage.\n\nAs a solo performer, his recitals are marked by pristine qualities of instrumentality with a vocal touch and very high degree of continuity throughout the raga delineation, a rare feature indeed. His vilambit compositions are essentially swara-pradhan where nuances reflect in its true essence and raga sanchar is calm in movement over a dignified treatment. While madhyalaya and drut compositions are embodiments of a fully controlled layakari and experimentation on instrumentality is well portrayed by incorporating the tonal qualities of other instruments like flute and shehanai in preference to sitar together, his harmonium provide a healing effect through most ineffable medium, worth experiencing.
