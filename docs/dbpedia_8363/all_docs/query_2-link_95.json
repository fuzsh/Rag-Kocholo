        "text": "Background\n\nA conman Lakhoba Lokhande is being prosecuted in the court of law for allegedly duping people, marrying women for money and essentially living multiple lives. He tries to defend his own self by asking uncomfortable questions to each witness during the cross-questioning. The entire play is set in a courtroom scene with a revolving set used for cut scenes and flashbacks.\n\nStoryline\n\nThe storyline focuses on a con Lakhoba Lokhande, who claims he is a tobacco merchant from Nipani. The drama starts with a courtroom scene in which Lakhoba Lokhande is sitting in the defendant box. He has been accused by the prosecution of swindling different persons through disguise and fraud. The prosecution lawyer presents many witnesses, most of whom are the victims of Lakhoba's embezzlement (and in some cases torture). The witnesses narrate their experiences with the defendant through flashbacks. Lakhoba runs his own case after firing his lawyer. He cross questions the witnesses and during the process pleads his innocence by saying \"To Mee Navhech\".\n\nLead role played by\n\nPrabhakar Panshikar\n\nSumeet Raghavan\n\nGirish Oak\n\nPushkar Shrotri\n\nOther role played by\n\nDattopant Angre\n\nNanda Patkar\n\nChadrachud Vasudev\n\nBipin Talpade\n\nVasudev Date\n\nEran Joseph\n\nPurushottam Bal\n\nKusum Kulkarni\n\nSaroj Naik\n\nMandakini Bhadbhade\n\nBholaram Athavale\n\nShripad Joshi\n\nTone of Narrative\n\nThe general tone of the narrative of \"To Mee Navhech\" means is rather sarcastic. Playwright Atre wanted the name \"Mee To Navhech\" but then Director Mo Ga Ranganekar went ahead with \"To Mee Navhech\" leaving Atre furious. The book is also published by same name. In that book, Atre wrote that Ranganekar did not suggest the name. Atre had already decided the name because the protagonist in the play used it many times \"To Mi Navhech\". The 1st show of this play was done on 8th Oct. 1962 in Delhi\n\nRemakes\n\nNaan Avanillai (1974) [Tamil] with Gemini Ganesan\n\nWoh Main Nahin (1974) [Hindi] with Navin Nischol\n\nNaan Avanillai (2007) [Tamil] with Jeevan"
