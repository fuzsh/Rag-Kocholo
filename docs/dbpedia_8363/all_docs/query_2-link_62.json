        "text": "âGaana Saraswati Mahotsavâ, a Classical Music festival organised by Natyasampada Pratishthan enters into its 9th edition planned for March 4 and 5, 2023.\n\nAs we all are inching towards normalcy after the global pandemic, we believe that music and art have the power to heal and provide comfort, solace, and positive energy and this and other events we would be planning are our small contributions in that effort.\n\nThe event has been named after Gaana Saraswati Padma Vibhushan Smt. Kishori Amonkar to honour and celebrate her contribution in the field of Indian Classical Music. This event is a tribute to this legendary and phenomenal artiste who with her lifelong pursuit of music and complete dedication to the art, not only carved a niche for herself but also created a new path for others to follow.\n\nNatyasampada Pratishthan was founded in 2006 by late Shri. Prabhakar Panshikar, the legendary actor and producer of the Marathi theatre. Our objectives include research and promotion of Theatre, Sanskrit Literature, and Indian Classical and other music. Our goals also include spreading the rich culture of Indian arts and music to the masses including the young generation.\n\nBesides the performances, this edition will also feature the following :\n\nFelicitation of Dr. Alka Deo Marulkar with the \"Gaanatapaswini Mogubai Kurdikar Puraskar\" which we started in 2015, for her exemplary contribution in Classical Vocal Music as an accomplished artiste and a teacher.\n\nFelicitation of Pandit Omkar Gulvady with the \"Gaanasaraswati Kishori Amonkar Sangatkar Puraskar\" which we started in 2015, for his exemplary contribution in Classical Music as an accomplished Tabla Accompanist and a teacher.\n\nNatyasampada Pratishthan was founded in 2006 by late Shri. Prabhakar Panshikar, the legendary actor and producer of the Marathi theatre. Our objectives include research and promotion of Theatre, Sanskrit Literature, and Indian Classical and other music. Our goals also include spreading the rich culture of Indian arts and music to the masses including the young generation. With these goals, we have started organising âGaana Saraswati Mahotsavâ since 2013. The event has been named after Gaana Saraswati Padma Vibhushan Smt. Kishori Amonkar to honour and celebrate her contribution in the field of Indian Classical Music. Artistes who have performed in all the editions have included senior legendary artistes as well as talented upcoming artistes. As part of our goals of spreading music to the masses, we have also organised lectures by Smt. Amonkar herself on different scientific and aesthetic aspects of Indian Classical Music. We intend to build upon such initiatives in future."
