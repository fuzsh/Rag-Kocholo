        "text": "Rating: 4/5 stars (A must watch)\n\nSubhod Bhave has become the face for many legendary personalities since the past few years. ‘Ani Dr. Kashinath Ghanekar’ is also one such biopic where he plays the role of Dr Kashinath Ghanekar. The movie being a biopic portrays the on and off stage life of the actor through various phases of his life.\n\nSpeaking in many reality shows, the cast made it clear that none of them tried to mimic the personalities they were playing. They all trusted the director–that is Abhijeet Deshpande–for his vision and research, as Deshpande has not failed in delivering a hit.\n\nThe movie revolves around the life of Ghanekar, the tragedies and upsets he faced which came hand in hand with fame. Ghanekar, a theater-lover known as the first superstar in Marathi clearly failed to handle fame which was destined to him. He took on acting seriously after his wife–who was not very fond of his acting–allowed him to do so in exchange of not being able to give him a child. This was perhaps the greatest compensation for the theater industry.\n\nChasing his passion Ghanekar proved to be a versatile actor and a huge contributor to Marathi theater, especially when the crowd was shifting towards Bollywood films. It wouldn’t be wrong to say that Marathi theater industry owes him for being active in the present years.\n\nThe star cast in the movie is one every director would dream of. Apart from Bhave the main cast consists of big names like Sumeet Raghavan as Dr. Sriram Lagoo, Anand Ingle as Vasant Kanetkar, Sonali Kulkarni as Sulochana Latkar and Prasad Oak as Prabhakar Panshikar. Everyone has lived up to their reputation as actor. Even Vaidehi Parshurami who plays the role of Kanchan Ghanekar (Ghanekar’s second wife) has done a fairly good job.\n\nThe friendship between Panshikar and Ghanekar is one of the standout in the whole film. Panshikar plays a vital role in the life of Ghanekar that deteriorates after the entry of Dr. Lagoo in the movie. One finely directed scene comes right after interval when Panshikar and Ghanekar are are sitting on a seesaw-type cart, balancing themselves as Panshikar uses metaphor and says “Me uthin tar tu padshil” (If I get up, you will fall). The scene makes so much sense in context of Panshikar’s character. The movie consists of many such scenes if observed.\n\nThe movie also shows the bitter relation between Ghanekar and Dr. Lagoo. It showcases two different genres of theater and the appreciation they received. The cold war between the two actors and the dialogues are very immaculately executed. There are few new songs in the movie as the some songs are used as it is. The music video of those songs are also replicated to good effect.\n\nThere is also a parallel story line of a character named Dinkar Phule, which goes on. Phule, a college student is Ghanekar’s biggest fan and a theater lover. His love for Ghanekar is seen at every stage of his life. His character takes an interesting turn post the interval which ends in a tragic way.\n\nThe movie, which is going housefull in cinema halls across the state is an example of the greatness of Ghanekar and his contribution. However, while watching the movie surely a Dinkar Phule in everyone will die somewhere."
