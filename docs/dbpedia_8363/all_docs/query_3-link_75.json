        "text": "Ani…Dr. Kashinath Ghanekar (Marathi) review :\n\nA biopic on the first and last superstar of Marathi theatre; Ani…Dr. Kashinath Ghanekar is a brilliant re-telling of the rise and fall of the celebrated actor with Subodh Bhave playing Kashinath to perfection.\n\nSpanning nearly two decades of Dr. Ghanekar’s illustrious career starting as a dentist doing sidey acting assignments as a hobby and then graduating to lead roles and superstardom, the film is authentic and accurate in its depiction. No whitewashing, no excess and no lies…Kashinath’s vices including womanizing and his subsequent alcohol addiction which lead to his downfall is shown AS -IS. Really wish Bollywood which is infamous for whitewashing everyone from underworld dons and their sisters to match fixing cricketers right down to a druggie film star should take a cue…\n\nKashinath’s story is layered with many sub plots and particularly interesting ones are : an already married Ghanekar falling in love with a much younger girl Kanchan (Vaidehi Parshurami), his strong friendship with fellow actor Prabhakar Panshikar (Prasad Oak) and of course, his bitter rivalry with Dr. Shriram Lagoo (Sumeet Raghavan). In one powerful scene, a drunk Kashinath goes to watch Dr. Lagoo’s play and intimidates him in front of the audience.\n\nAny negatives, you may ask? Not many. A few, maybe. For one Kashinath’s strained relationship with his father isn’t properly explained. Also, his first wife bearing with women literally (!!) tumbling out of his closet looks shocking initially. Director Abhijeet Deshpande does explain wifey’s uncanny behaviour towards the end though..\n\nTechnically, the film scores big time and I was glad to find a Marathi movie, otherwise tied down by budget constraints, recreate the 70s era so efficiently- whether it is Dadar’s Shivaji Mandir theatre or V Shantaram’s ‘Pinjra’ (1972) set. The music is another plus point with Ghanekar’s popular songs re-recorded beautifully.\n\nExpectedly, the supporting cast is first rate. Prasad Oak, Sumeet Raghavan, Vaidehi Parshurami, Anand Ingle and Suhas Palshikar have performed competently. Mohan Joshi is effective as Bhalji Pendharkar while Sonali Kulkarni leaves an impression as the veteran actor Sulochana.\n\nAni.. finally above all, is Subodh Bhave.\n\nFirst, Balgandharva (2011), then Lokmanya Tilak (2015) and now Dr. Ghanekar, Subodh Bhave is truly the biopic champion. Evolving continuously as a solid actor, he’s simply outstanding in this film. His career best!!\n\nConclusion : Dr. Kashinath Ghanekar deserves a theatrical watch. It’s a rare class of cinema – a (near) flawless biopic made on such a flawed legend.\n\nRatings on some key aspects :\n\n1. Acting : 4.5/5\n\n2. Direction : 4/5\n\n3. Music : 4/5\n\n4. Story, Screenplay and Dialogue : 4/5\n\n5. Cinematography : 3.5/5\n\n6. Editing : 3.5/5\n\n7. Production Quality : 4/5\n\n8. Action : NA\n\n#SNRating for #AniDrKashinathGhanekar : 4 stars out of 5 (Very good).\n\n– Sumeet Nadkarni\n\n#AniDrKashinathGhanekar #Marathifilm #review #SubodhBhave #SumeetRaghavan #SNRatings\n\nLiked the review?\n\nClick on the link below and like the #SNRatings page to subscribe to honest and unbiased reviews of all latest movies : https://m.facebook.com/SNRatings\n\nYou can also follow us on Twitter handle : @sumu76in"
