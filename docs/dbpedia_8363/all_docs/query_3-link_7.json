        "text": "Prabhakar Panshikar : 1931-2011\n\nTo Aata Navhech (He's No More)\n\nMarathi theatre veteran Prabhakar Panshikar (1931-2011) succumbed to cardiac arrest and renal failure in Pune on Thursday. He was 79. He immortalized the role of Lakhoba Lokhande, the real life fraudster who married many times over and cheated all his 'wives', in Acharya Atre's TO MEE NAVECH (That is not me). Launched way back in 1962, the play went on to celebrate 2833 shows! The audience was mesmerized by its dramatic story, Panshikar's superlative six different roles and the revolving stage (phirta rangamanch). He is also remembered for his role as ruthless Aurangzeb in 'Ithe Oshalala Mrityu'. Among his other memorable plays are 'Ashrunchi Zhali Phule', 'Bhatala Dili Osari 'Thank You Mr Glad' and 'Jevha Gavtala Bhale Phuttat'.\n\nHe launched his banner Natya Sampada which is now helmed by his nephew Anant Panshikar, and a revived new version of the play 'Vichcha Majhi Poori Kara' has been launched. Panshikar fondly known as Pant was honoured with Acharya Atre, Bal Gandharva, Keshavrao Date Purskars and felicitated by the Sangeet Natak Akademi as well. He is survived by his wife, two daughters and a son. His son, Raghunandan is a classical singer of repute.\n\nread / post your comments\n\nMore on Theatre Update\n\n- 22 Plays, 22 Languages, 1 Stage - Prem Utsav 2024 by Mujeeb Khan (new)\n\n- Makrand Deshpande announces ''ANSH MANCH'' Theatre Festival at Prithvi\n\n- An exquisite evening of Theatre and Performing Arts held in Hyderabad National icons light up the stage\n\n- Unicorn Actors Studio pays tribute to late Tripurari Sharma\n\n- USHA KI KIRAN - A Five-Day Summer Theatre Festival in Kolkata\n\n- Plays Happening this week: 29th May - 02nd June 2024\n\n- AI fever hits Marathi play AAJJI BAI JORAT!\n\n- Interesting Plays Happening This Weekend\n\n- Lists Of Plays Happening This Weekend\n\n- Don't miss: Ila Arun - K K Raina's AJAATSHATRU\n\n- Ebrahim Alkazi's Biography Released\n\n- Theatre Community Pays Tribute to Begum Razia Baig\n\n- World Theatre Day 2024 message by Jon FOSSE\n\n- WORLD THEATRE DAY 2024: Check Out what theatre fraternity has to speak\n\n- RAGHUNATH SWEEPS META\n\nTheatre Update Archives"
