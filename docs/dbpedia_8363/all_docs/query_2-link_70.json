        "text": "Shri. Prabhakar Panshikar, has to his credit the unique distinction of performing as an actor & producer on screen & on television as well and reaching the theatre to each and every district, village and taluka in Maharashtra. He developed local artists and launched them in cities like Pune, Mumbai, Kolhapur etc. through his theatre company - Natyasampada. He did this for over five decades relentlessly with a missionary zeal till his unfortunate demise in 2011. He was an institution by himself. He has spent 53 years on stage with over 8000 performances to his credit. The Government of Maharashtra, felicitated him by giving him the 1st Jeevan Gaurav Puraskar. And further honored him by naming this annual award itself as 'Prabhakar Panshikar Jeevan Gaurav Puraskar'.\n\nNatyasampada\n\nShortly after his first successful play 'To Mee Navech', Panshikar launched his production company - 'Natya Sampada', on 8th April 1963 along with his colleagues Late Mohan Wagh and Vasudeo Kolhatkar. Later the partners split and Shri. Prabhakar Panshikar retained Natyasampada.\n\nIn spite of some pitfalls and losses incurred in the initial productions, Natyasampada continued its endeavor to give quality entertainment to the Marathi audiences. 1967-Panshikar came together with a close friend and Actor Director from the Gujarathi stage - Mr. Kanti Madia, and launched the Gujarathi Division of 'Natya Sampada'. Since 1963 to 2002. Natyasampada , produced over 40 plays, Mr. Panshikar's health started troubling him and the tours got constrained. Around 2006, he decided to stop acting and handed over the management of Natyasampada to his nephew - Anant Panshikar.\n\nAnant Panshikar\n\nIn 2007, 40 years after the production of a successful musical in Marathi titled 'Katyar Kaljat Ghusli', Anant Panshikar produced his first play under the guidance of Shri. Prabhakar Panshikar titled ‘Sangeet Awagha Rang Ekachi Zaala’. Anant Panshikar's career as 'Nirmata' began. Anant developed a team of youngsters with fresh ideas and experimented with international classic Waiting For Godot,where renowned actor from Hindi and English theatre and cinema, Tom Alter made his first appearance on Marathi stage. Since then there was no looking back and Natyasampada continued with the same glory and pompous and produced - Many Happy Returns(2009), Vichcha Majhi Puri Kara(2011), Varyavarchi Varaat(2011), Lekure Udand Jaali(2012), Lagnachi Bedi(2012) and recently Zalaach Pahije(2013)."
