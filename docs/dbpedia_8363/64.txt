Prabhakar Panshikar : 1931-2011

To Aata Navhech (He's No More)

Marathi theatre veteran Prabhakar Panshikar (1931-2011) succumbed to cardiac arrest and renal failure in Pune on Thursday. He was 79. He immortalized the role of Lakhoba Lokhande, the real life fraudster who married many times over and cheated all his 'wives', in Acharya Atre's TO MEE NAVECH (That is not me). Launched way back in 1962, the play went on to celebrate 2833 shows! The audience was mesmerized by its dramatic story, Panshikar's superlative six different roles and the revolving stage (phirta rangamanch). He is also remembered for his role as ruthless Aurangzeb in 'Ithe Oshalala Mrityu'. Among his other memorable plays are 'Ashrunchi Zhali Phule', 'Bhatala Dili Osari 'Thank You Mr Glad' and 'Jevha Gavtala Bhale Phuttat'.

He launched his banner Natya Sampada which is now helmed by his nephew Anant Panshikar, and a revived new version of the play 'Vichcha Majhi Poori Kara' has been launched. Panshikar fondly known as Pant was honoured with Acharya Atre, Bal Gandharva, Keshavrao Date Purskars and felicitated by the Sangeet Natak Akademi as well. He is survived by his wife, two daughters and a son. His son, Raghunandan is a classical singer of repute.
