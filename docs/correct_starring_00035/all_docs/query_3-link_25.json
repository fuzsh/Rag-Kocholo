        "text": "We met 17-year-old actress Meaghan Jette Martin while she was in Manhattan recently.\n\nShe has starred in the ABC Family TV show \"10 Things I Hate About You,\" and the \"Camp Rock\" Disney Channel movies.\n\nQ: Was acting one of your dreams and goals when you were younger?\n\nA: Definitely. Acting has always been a part of my life. I started doing commercials when I was 5 years old. So I've always been doing it and I don't think I could do anything else. I just love it so much.\n\nQ: We heard you play the guitar and piano. Is it hard?\n\nA: Yes it's very hard. I'm not very good at either guitar or piano. I'm working on them. Hopefully one day I will be somewhat successful at either of them.\n\nQ: How did you feel when you recorded the song \"Circle of Life\"?\n\nA: It was very scary . . . because it's such a famous song and everybody knows it; everybody knows the words. I didn't want to ruin it, I didn't want to upset anybody. So it was nerve wracking, but I'm happy the way it (turned out).\n\nQ: You seem so nice in person. Is it hard to act like a snobby person in \"Camp Rock\"?\n\nA: Well, thank you! It can be really difficult, but at the same time I have to remember that it's all acting and it's just my character and that's who Tess is. But it could be really hard especially when I really love the cast that I work with and to watch Debbie cry because I'm saying mean things. It breaks my heart a little. But we all know that we're just acting.\n\nQ: What do you like about your character Tess Tyler?\n\nA: There's not much that I do actually like about Tess. I think probably her best quality is her determination. She doesn't give up even if sometimes it's not the best thing to be determined about, not the best thing to be fighting for. She still has that drive, that hope and I think deep down she does really care about everybody. She just doesn't have the best way of showing it.\n\nQ: Are the clothes that you wear in \"Camp Rock\" similar to the clothes you wear?\n\nA: The clothes that I wear in \"Camp Rock\" actually are pretty different than the way I dress in real life. Tess is very blingalicious, as she would say, wears lots of sparkles and I'm more toned down. I definitely like sparkles and I like jewelry, but she's a bit more adventurous with her wardrobe than I am.\n\nQ: What is your favorite part in \"Camp Rock 2\"?\n\nA: I don't know if I can give away too much, but I'm excited because Tess Tyler is actually not going to be at Camp Rock. She will be somewhere else and it's going to be really cool. So I'm excited for everybody to see where she ends up.\n\nQ: What are your hobbies?\n\nA: I love to bake. If I do say so myself I make really good brownies. I like to bake cupcakes and everything. I read a lot. I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter series. I watch movies and shopping is a hobby I probably shouldn't enjoy as much as I do.\n\nQ: Was it hard being home schooled?\n\nA: I actually loved being home schooled. Most people don't like it very much, but it allowed me to do what I love to do, which is act, sing and perform. If I hadn't been home schooled I wouldn't have been able to do that so easily. So it was a good experience for me. A lot of my friends are home schooled so I still had the social aspect of hanging out with friends and I got to go to a school dance anyway.\n\nQ: Where do you like to shop?\n\nA: I like to shop at Urban Outfitters and Forever 21, Nordstrom's and Macy's and all sorts of places.\n\nQ: In the future would you like to direct your own movie?\n\nA: I don't know that I could ever be a director. I think it would be cool, but you have to be super patient when directing and I don't quite have the right amount of patience. It takes a totally different part of your mind to direct and anybody who can direct I have so much respect for. But I don't know if it's something I would be good at.\n\nQ: We really love your show. What is your favorite episode in \"10 Things I Hate about You\"?\n\nA: My favorite episode is episode 8. It is a dance. We get to go to the Fall Fling. I actually have a lot of drama that happens in that episode. I get dumped and then I end up going with Cameron. It's very exciting.\n\nSamantha Oh, Melody Jung and Fiona Syed are reporters for Newsday's Kidsday."
