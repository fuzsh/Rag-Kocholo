For this reason her mother gets a job as the Camp's cook so that Mitchie can attend as long as she helps out in the kitchen between classes. Befriended by fellow camp member Caitlyn but intimidated by the immensely talented Tess, Peggy and Ella, Mitchie pretends her mother has an important job in a music television. One day she's overheard singing, but not seen, by teen pop star and celebrity camp instructor, Shane Gray, the lead singer of Connect 3. He is completely taken and sets out to find the girl behind the beautiful voice."
