I was 17, working mostly outdoor night shoots, during a very cold Canadian autumn (like ‚ùÑÔ∏è cold), and I was so so sick and being berated, bullied and manipulated by men at least 2x my age. As you can see from this pic of me asleep on a dance studio sofa during a short break from rehearsal, I truly couldn‚Äôt keep my eyes open. (Featuring angel @annamariapdt who was a great friend through all of this)\n\nI haven‚Äôt shared this article much, mostly out of fear, and it only scratches the surface of some of the goings on, but the very kind @roisin_o_connor did a beautiful job conveying some of the darker complications of that period.\n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/disney-child-stars-alyson-stoner-meaghan-martin-b1863553.html (link in bio)\n\nI am incredibly thankful for the successes and frustrations that I‚Äôve had in my career, and ultimately I wouldn‚Äôt change anything other than standing up for myself more. I recognize how much privilege I‚Äôve had and it‚Äôs part of why I haven‚Äôt spoken out more about the uglier parts, but we are at a crucial point in history where we can acknowledge that not everything is as shiny as it seems, perhaps especially when it comes to the entertainment industry. I do plan to share more about this in the future so not trying to leave anyone hanging but gotta save some ü´ñ for the book - kidding‚Ä¶ mostly.\".",
