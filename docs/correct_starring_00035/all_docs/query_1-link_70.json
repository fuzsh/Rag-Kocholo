        "text": "While barely a teenager, Meaghan Martin began appearing in local productions of plays like \"Peter Pan\" in her hometown of Las Vegas. Before long she started appearing in children's commercials for toys like Barbie and Cabbage Patch Kids. But with her sights set on television and movie roles, Martin packed up and relocated to Los Angeles. In 2007 she landed her very first television role on the Nickelodeon sitcom \"Just Jordan.\" From there the roles began to pour in. During that same year she guest starred on the CBS drama \"Close to Home,\" as well as the Disney comedy \"The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.\" In 2008 she landed the lead role, opposite the Jonas Brothers, in the musical comedy \"Camp Rock,\" and was subsequently named as one of TV Guide's \"13 Hottest Young Stars to Watch.\" Martin's breakout role came in 2009 when she became a cast-member on the sitcom, \"10 Things I Hate About You.\" Although the show was cancelled after a single season, Martin followed it up by appearing as the lead in the 2011 made-for-TV comedy, \"Mean Girls 2.\" When she's not acting, Meaghan Martin is also an accomplished singer. In 2009 she did a rendition of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" for the re-release of the classic animated movie, \"Pinocchio,\" and also recorded songs that appeared on the soundtrack for \"Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam.\""
