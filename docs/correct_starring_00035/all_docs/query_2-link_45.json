        "text": "“Connect” with Shane, Mitchie, & more!\n\nCan you believe it’s been almost a decade since Camp Rock premiered on Disney Channel? Aside from the JoBros and Demi, we haven’t seen the Camp Rock crew all together in almost as long, but they’ve surely gotten up to a lot of cool stuff as individuals since the film has wrapped. From YouTube sensations to pop superstars, this cast has done it all!\n\nLet’s throw it back and see how the Camp Rock gang has changed, and what they’re up to now.\n\nJasmine Richards played Margaret “Peggy” Dupree, Tess’ friend.\n\nJasmine has since starred in the Canadian Disney Channel show “Overruled!,” acting as the judge of a teen court. She now also runs a YouTube Channel, called Style Lights, where she makes beauty and lifestyle videos.\n\nAnna María Pérez de Tagle played Ella Pador, Tess’ other friend.\n\nSince her role in “Camp Rock,” she’s appeared in episodes of “Hannah Montana” and “Baby Daddy.” She also performed in “Godspell” on Broadway. Now, she has her own YouTube Channel where she shares beauty secrets.\n\nMeaghan Jette Martin played the super talented mean girl, Tess Tyler:\n\nMeaghan went on to star in “Mean Girls 2” and MTV’s “Awkward.” She is also set to appear in the drama film “Journey,” to be released this year.\n\nJordan Francis and Roshon Fegan played breakdancing BFFs, Barron James and Sander Loyer!\n\nJordan has released a mixtape on SoundCloud and produced the song “Sweeterman” by Drake. Roshon starred in Disney’s “Shake It Up” and came sixth in the 14th season of “Dancing With The Stars.”\n\nAlyson Stoner played Caitlyn Gellar, Mitchie’s best friend at camp, and she was the epitome of talent.\n\nAlyson was in two “Step Up” films, voiced Isabella on “Phineas and Ferb” and started a YouTube Channel, The Real Alyson Stoner.\n\nKevin Jonas played Jason Gray, Shane’s brother and fellow member of Connect 3.\n\nAfter the JoBros called it quits, he married Danielle Deleasa. The couple has two children together!\n\nNick Jonas played Nate Gray, Shane’s other brother and fellow member of Connect 3.\n\nNick hasn’t quit acting! He appeared on “Scream Queens” and currently stars in the drama series “Kingdom.” And we’re loving his latest album, “Last Year Was Complicated.”\n\nJoe Jonas played Shane Gray, the lead singer of Connect 3 who is sent to Camp Rock to fix his arrogant attitude.\n\nJoe is currently rockin’ out in the band DNCE, which made their debut with the smash hit single “Cake by the Ocean.” When he’s not on tour with DNCE, he’s dabbing in modeling!\n\nAnd finally, Demi Lovato played Mitchie Torres, a girl who dreams of going to Camp Rock. To afford it, her mother works as the camp’s cook.\n\nDemi went from “Camp Rock” crooner to international superstar! She’s sold millions of albums, and made her feature film debut when she lent her voice to the latest Smurfs movie! Plus, she’s still super close with Nick!"
