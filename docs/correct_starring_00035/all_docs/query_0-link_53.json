Also included is a special sneak peek of the upcoming ABC primetime series \"High School Musical: Get in the Picture.\"\n\nKevin Jonas commented: \"Having 'Camp Rock' be included in 'The Wonderful World of Disney' is absolutely amazing. We grew up watching the show, and having the movie be a part of it is the biggest honor ever.\"\n\nThe longest running network television series in primetime history, \"The Wonderful World of Disney\" originally began in 1954 as a primetime feature hosted by Walt Disney himself as a showcase for original programming from The Walt Disney Studios, including feature films, original made-for-television movies, cartoons, documentaries and educational shorts. The Jonas Brothers join such legendary \"Wonderful World of Disney\" hosts as Julie Andrews, Ronald Reagan, Kirk Douglas, the Osmonds, Annette Funicello and Michael Eisner, among many others.\n\n\"Camp Rock\" is a song and dance-filled Disney Channel Original Movie for kids and families starring Platinum-certified Hollywood Records recording artists and Top 40 and Radio Disney hit-makers Jonas Brothers (Joe, Kevin and Nick) and singer/songwriter/actress Demi Lovato (Disney Channel's \"As the Bell Rings\"). The movie tells the story of a talented yet unsure teen who yearns to share her songs with the world, and of a tempestuous young superstar who has lost his passion for music and is sent packing by his band mates. Together, at a camp for aspiring young music artists, they learn to believe in themselves and to value the freedom to be who they really want to be. Also starring are Alyson Stoner (\"Cheaper by the Dozen\"), Meaghan Jette Martin, Anna Maria Perez de Taglï¿½ (Disney Channel's \"Hannah Montana\"), Jasmine Richards (\"Naturally Sadie\"), Maria Canals-Barrera (Disney Channel's \"Wizard of Waverly Place\"), Daniel Fathers, Roshon Fegan, Jordan Francis and screenwriter/actress Julie Brown. The movie was written by Regina Hicks, Karin Gist and Julie and Paul Brown. The director is Matthew Diamond.\n\n\"Camp Rock\" will air in 720 Progressive (720P), ABC's selected HDTV format, with 5.1-channel surround sound and Spanish audio via SAP. This program carries a TV-G parental guideline."
