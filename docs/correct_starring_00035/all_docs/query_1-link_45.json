        "text": "Clearly, I love ABC Family a lot. I think their original programming is fantastic. I was slightly skeptical about 10 Things I Hate About You when it was first announced, just because I was a huge fan of the movie. However, I think the show has turned out to be incredibly fun, and it doesn’t attempt to recreate the movie. As the season progressed, I found myself enjoying it more and more. It has been a great summer show, and I really hope it gets picked up for a 2nd season. I recently got the chance to interview Meaghan Jette Martin (who plays Bianca) about her character, Camp Rock 2, and what we can expect (hopefully) from season 2.\n\nTell us a little bit more about your character Bianca. Why do you think she tries so hard to fit in?\n\nI think Bianca tries hard to fit in because in her mind that is what success is. If everyone likes you then you are a successful person to Bianca Stratford.\n\nBianca is quite the opposite of her sister…do you have any siblings? Can you relate to that?\n\nI do have siblings. I am one of four kids. I have an older sister who is quite a bit like Kat and our relationship when we were growing up was similar. Now my sister is married and we’re both out of high school so we get along much better but there was a time when you could have mistaken us for Bianca and Kat.\n\nIn the latest episode, Cameron drunkenly admitted to liking Bianca, and she didn’t feel the same way. What do you think this means for their friendship?\n\nI definitely think this will add complications to their friendship. I mean, honestly, how could it not? I think this is something that they both knew would happen deep down but neither of them wanted to deal with it until Cameron was not umm… thinking straight. The plot twists coming up should be very exciting and I’m pumped to see where this new knowledge takes them.\n\nWhat do you like most about playing Bianca?\n\nThe thing I love most about playing Bianca is the people I get to work with and learn from everyday. I love getting to know more about Bianca and her personality by talking to the writers, directors and other actors. I also think Bianca is fun because currently she’s limitless.. she changes so much as a person over the first 10 episodes, who knows where else she will go!\n\nDid you study the movie to research your role?\n\nI most definitely watched the movie several times before playing the role but I wouldn’t say that I necessarily studied it. I think Larisa Oleynik does a wonderful job as Bianca in the movie and I in no way wanted to copy her or attempt to play the character the same way that she does.\n\nWhat has been your favorite part of filming the show?\n\nI love everything about filming the show. What’s not to love about waking up everyday to participate in something I’m passionate about, work with people I adore and admire and get paid to do it!?\n\nWhat can we expect to see from Bianca if there is hopefully a season 2?\n\nI think Bianca has some growing up to do so hopefully if there is a season 2 we see her make some wise decisions and show her intelligence and maturity.\n\nYou are currently on set filming Camp Rock 2. Can you give us a little preview of the movie?\n\nI can’t really say much about Camp Rock 2. There will be a camp. Some rocks. The Jonas Brothers, Demi Lovato and myself!\n\nYou are multi-talented: you act and sing. What is it like switching gears? Will we get to see you sing in 10 Things?\n\nI mostly sing for acting jobs so there, luckily, isn’t much of a switch. It’s always in character so it goes right along with the acting. I’d love to do a musical episode of “10 Things” I think that would be pretty hilarious.\n\nIs there anything you want fans of the show to know?\n\nI want everyone watching the show to know how awesome I think it is that they’re enjoying it. I hope they continue to love it and I appreciate their support SO much!!\n\nWhat are your favorite tv shows?\n\n30 Rock and House\n\nThe season finale of 10 Things I Hate About You airs TONIGHT on ABC Family at 8 pm. Be sure to tune in!"
