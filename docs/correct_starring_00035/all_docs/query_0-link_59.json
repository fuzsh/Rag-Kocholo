In 'Camp Rock' (2008) Mitchie Torres (Lovato) is a talented young musician who gets the opportunity to attend the prestigious music camp, Camp Rock. At first, Mitchie is slightly intimidated by some of her fellow campers' competitiveness, but she soon settles in and becomes friends with Caitlyn (Alyson Stoner), a down-to-earth girl who dreams of becoming a music producer. With the help of Caitlin and instructors like Shane Gray (Joe Jonas), a member of the band Connect 3 who has returned to the camp to rediscover his passion for music, Mitchie soon develops the confidence to confront her fears and embrace her musical talents. In 'Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam' (2010) Mitchie returns to Camp Rock for the summer along with Shane, Nate (Nick Jonas) and Jason (Kevin Jonas). Mitchie is enjoying spending time with her friends and writing new songs but soon trouble stirs when rival camp, Camp Star, provides fierce competition and puts Camp Rock's future in jeopardy. The members of each camp must do battle using their musical talents, but who will come out on top?"
