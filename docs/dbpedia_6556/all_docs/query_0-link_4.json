        "text": "Polish, comedic epic masterpiece that [arguably spanning nearly every genre of comedy] follows a Polish soldier across a great portion of the European and North African theatres of war; highly recommended for brilliantly delivered comedic content and original narrative! [available on NF, in three parts, as of 02/13]\n\nItalian comedy on greek isle that has its dramatic and romantic moments infused with light, comedic moments; while light on action, it is highly recommended for its rich narrative and beautiful location! [somewhat difficult to find; no longer available on NF as of 02/13]\n\nIn World War II, a Finnish sniper is left chained to a rock by German soldiers, while a captain of the Red Army, en route to his court martial, is almost blown up by Russian planes. A Lapp woman gives shelter to both of them at her farm.\n\nLegend has it that if the famous Barbary Apes leave the Rock of Gibraltar, it's a sign that the British will lose control of it. During World War II, a British officer is put in charge of the apes. When he detects that the animals' morale is slipping, he hatches a plan to go behind the German lines to \"kidnap\" a new ape for his charges to lift their spirits before the Germans find out about their condition and use it as propaganda.\n\nOriginally intended as an antiwar film, 'KH' views as a heist film heavy on action & adventure, but with great, if not light, comedic moments... [sadly, currently available VHS/DVD appear to be heavily cut/edited; original, opening theatrical (roadshow?) cut may be impossible to find]\n\nNo WWII genre film beckons an extended/director's-type cut/release more than this film, IMO [if it's even possible?]; particularly, timely for the upcoming 75th anniversary of the end of the war [coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the film (2020)]...\n\nWith the passing of Master Director Brian Hutton [2014; RIP...], the much anticipated director's cut will never be...\n\nIf Hutton and Eastwood could have had their original release without the studio demanded cuts/edits, this would likely be No. 1 on the list...\n\nChristopher Lee, Toshiro Mifune, John Belushi, John Candy, & Slim Pickens!!!, all sharing the screen [particularly Lee, Mifune, Pickens, & Belushi all on the same sub!!!] in a comedic, action romp with moments of romance and drama; largely panned by critics [and sadly, to some extent, by its own director], but with growing cult followings worldwide.\n\n'Jak rozpetalem druga wojne swiatowa' [at the top of this list] is epic in its ambitious approach to its narrative, while '1941' was epic in most every other way [production, cast, etc.]...but its nothing that a smart director's cut couldn't address...\n\nHighly recommended! [impossible to find a good un-cropped, non-laserdisc, print; BluRay someday? If there readily existed a better print, this would easily rate higher...paging Mr. Spielberg!]\n\nWar narrative with British humor/slapstick makes for a challenging, but greatly rewarding/entertaining film. Marked by biting satire, brilliant performances, & excellent cinematography [shot in Andalucia, Spain], it's likely to be a unique film viewing experience without the gritty/gory realism of modern day war genre films, but no less poignant.\n\nAn oft maligned film that may have the unique distinction of being both an 'Anti-war Film' film & an 'Anti-war' film, and unfolds in an unconventional plot structure formed by a series of narrated episodes/vignettes that are franticly-paced, dark, stirring, & above all surrealistic. [available on NF instant as of 02/13]\n\nRecommended for the WWII comedy genre fan and fans of \"Catch-22\", \"Closely Watched Trains\", \"Life is Beautiful\", \"Devils on the Doorstep\", \"The Secret of Santa Vittoria\", \"Dr. Akagi\", etc.\n\nThis is actually an extended episode/special from the end of British comedy series depicting some highlights from its nine-year run; viewing the developing narrative over the entire series from the beginning is recommended over watching this episodic synopsis that inappropriately places the brilliant genius of its humour out of context.\n\nThis entire series [1–9] is highly recommended, with series three [the POW camp, etc] likely delivering its best...\n\nWhen an open-minded Jewish waiter and his son become victims of the Holocaust, he uses a perfect mixture of will, humor and imagination to protect his son from the dangers around their camp.\n\nDuring World War II, PFC Molnár decides his military service is over, and with a serious amount of money hidden in hand grenades, he heads to an abandoned mansion where he encounters not only the sour butler but a bunch of others who are also trying to wimp out on their duties."
