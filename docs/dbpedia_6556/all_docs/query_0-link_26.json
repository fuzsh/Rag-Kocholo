        "text": "Lionsgate will release Guy Ritchie’s action-comedy Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre domestically on March 3.\n\nThe film, previously titled Five Eyes, stars Jason Statham, Hugh Grant, Aubrey Plaza, Josh Hartnett, Cary Elwes and Bugzy Malone. It will hit theaters opposite Michael B. Jordan’s Creed 3.\n\nOperation Fortune, co-financed by Miramax and STX Entertainment, has Statham playing super spy Orson Fortune as he tracks down and stops the sale of a deadly new weapons technology wielded by billionaire arms broker Greg Simmonds (Grant).\n\nPlaza, Elwes and Malone appear as skilled operators who, along with Fortune, recruit Hollywood’s biggest movie star, Danny Francesco (Josh Hartnett), to help them save the world. Ritchie directs from a screenplay he wrote with Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies (The Gentlemen, Wrath of Man).\n\nRitchie and Statham previously worked together on Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. And Ritchie and Miramax collaborated on The Gentlemen and Wrath of Man. The producer credits are shared by Ritchie, Atkinson and Bill Block."
