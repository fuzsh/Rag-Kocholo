        "text": "Saving Private Ryan is a film set on the background of the most traumatic Invasion of Normandy in the World War Two. In 1994, when millions of soldiers landing in the beaches of Normandy, Captain Miller entered the road to enemy territory with eight American soldiers, risking their lives to save the single one solider-James Ryan. Ryan was the youngest son in his family. His three older brothers were killed one after another in the fighting on the forefront. In order to comfort his mother and keep her from bearing the pain of losing her only son left, the General of American Combat Headquarter decided to send a special team to save Ryan. This team faced all kinds of dangers. When their teammates are sacrificed one by one, they began to doubt the rationality of this task: why does this solider worth eight soldiers risking their lives to rescue him? Why Ryan’s life is more valuable than their lives? Nevertheless, in spite of their doubts, they still resolutely carried out the superior’s order. This is a road to test the human concept and value in the heart of every man during the war, a road full of self-scarification. After experiencing innumerable hazards and hardships, they finally found Ryan in a battlefield. However, Ryan, who had a strong sense of responsibility, rejected to leave the battlefield.\n\nCaptain Miller is an ordinary captain among U.S. military, nonetheless, for the purpose of executing the superior’s order, he unwaveringly takes seven soldiers for the task of saving Private Ryan. Six soldiers dead on this journey. Using six soldiers’ lives in exchange for the life of a common solider may seem ridiculous for the logic reasoning. However, in the view of human nature, it is reasonable. Such supreme quality and lofty spirit of human being manifest the meaning of our life: the sense of selflessness facilitated intimacy relationships and contributions between people."
