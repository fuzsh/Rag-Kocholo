        "text": "Even though the majority of Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan focuses on the efforts to extract the title character (played by Matt Damon) from behind enemy lines, it's the opening depiction of D-Day which often sticks in viewers' minds. The Allied invasion of Normandy was one of the most important battles in the entirety of World War II, setting the stage for liberating France and the rest of Europe from the conquest of the Nazis.\n\nThe film's sequence immerses the audience in all of its grit, brutality, and ugly violence, creating a sensation of landing at Omaha Beach along with the US troops. The cinematography is powerful, and, according to Spielberg, it was his effort to capture the “almost blind terror” of those who were actually there that day as authentically as possible.\n\nClint Eastwood has repeatedly shown that he is a director with a unique vision, and in both Flags of our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima he gives viewers a chance to experience a pivotal battle of the Pacific Theater in World War II. Though taking the island seemed to have little true strategic value, Joe Rosenthal's photo of the soldiers erecting the US flag quickly became an icon of patriotism and victory.\n\nFlags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima are a sort of diptych, with each showing the battle from the perspective of different sides - American and Japanese, respectively. While the former contains some scenes of the battle, it's primarily concerned with exploring the juxtaposition of the photograph's sanctified afterlife with the less inspiring circumstances of its creation. The latter, meanwhile, focuses on the grit and ugliness of the battle, demonstrating in the scarring of the land. It also heartbreakingly conveys the ultimate futility of the Japanese soldiers' actions, made manifest in the letters the soldiers write, even knowing no one will ever likely read them.\n\nGlory is an extraordinary film for many reasons, not the least of which is the fact it brings much-needed focus to the experiences of African American soldiers fighting for the Union during the Civil War. The 1989 film climaxes with the Second Battle of Fort Wagner; the characters participate in the doomed charge against the Fort, located in South Carolina, and met their deaths in the process.\n\nThe film takes the usual Hollywood liberties with history, but much of what is shown of this particular battle is based in truth. The 54th Massachusetts Infantry was indeed key to the assault against the Fort, and though they were unsuccessful, their bravery led to wider enlistment of African American troops. Colonel Shaw (played by Matthew Broderick) was, in fact, shot fatally as he ordered his troops, just as seen in the film.\n\nThough most war films understandably focus on soldiers and their actions, Hacksaw Ridge primarily focuses on Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield), a pacifist who nevertheless played a key role in saving American soldiers while serving as a combat medic during the Battle of Okinawa. The real battle was a truly devastating affair, costing 2500 American lives and almost twice as many among the Japanese, all for control of the title ridge, a rather diminutive knoll.\n\nIn the film, Hacksaw Ridge is a more imposing edifice, and it serves as a fitting backdrop for Doss's efforts to help his squad-mates. Unsurprisingly, the film leans into the violence and ugliness of armed conflict, all of which makes Doss's actions all the more remarkable, as he lowers his wounded comrades down the escarpment at great personal risk to himself.\n\nThe evacuation of Dunkirk was a pivotal moment in World War II in which the British Navy, assisted by many smaller ships manned by private individuals, managed to get British soldiers away from Europe in the face of tremendous pressure from the Nazis. It was a miraculous evacuation, as it involved getting over 300,000 men away from the French city between May 26 and June 4, 1940.\n\nChristopher Nolan's aptly-named Dunkirk provides multiple perspectives on this pivotal operation with moments of action interspersed with more gripping personal drama. The production pays an extraordinary amount of attention to detail, and some of the characters, including Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance), are based on the accounts of real people, in this case Charles Lightoller. He was a survivor of the Titanic whose own boat played its part in saving the men at Dunkirk.\n\nMany World War II films tend to focus on land battles, there has been a recent turn to the significant naval battles of the war. Take, for example, 2020's Greyhound, which focuses on the Battle of the Atlantic, which saw Allied forces vying with the Axis for control of the ocean. Notably, the Battle of the Atlantic technically lasted from 1939 to 1945, making it the longest campaign of the war.\n\nGreyhound focuses in particular on the efforts of US Navy Commander Ernie Krause (Tom Hanks) to protect a convoy from the predations of U-boats (which were, in fact, a constant threat during the conflict). Though the story itself is fictional, it's set within the very real battle. Additionally, Greyhound does a good job of conveying just how important American supplies were to the war efforts of the British, as well as how claustrophobic and gray the Battle itself was."
