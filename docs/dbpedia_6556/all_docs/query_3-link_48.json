        "text": "Peacekeepers\n\nThe British Government ordered the deployment of troops to Northern Ireland in August 1969. This was to counter the growing disorder surrounding civil rights protests and an increase in sectarian violence during the traditional Protestant marching season.\n\nThe Roman Catholic population of Northern Ireland had little faith in the local police force, viewing the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) as a pro-Protestant organisation. Initially, it was hoped that the British Army might be more readily accepted as a neutral peacekeeping force.\n\nIllegal paramilitaries\n\nBut this optimism was misplaced. Despite the Army coming under the control of the Secretary of State for Defence in London, many Catholics saw it as a tool of the Unionist Government in Northern Ireland.\n\nAccordingly, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA), which had formed in 1969 and whose membership was growing, increased levels of violence against both the police and the Army.\n\nLoyalist paramilitary groups, including the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), intent on keeping the region part of the United Kingdom, also stepped up their campaign of sectarian violence.\n\nThe early 1970s also saw major rioting on both sides of the religious divide.\n\nUrban warfare\n\nSoldiers and vehicles on patrol in Northern Ireland, undertaking searches and acting as snatch squads, increasingly came under attack from terrorists and rioters using petrol and nail bombs.\n\nTroops honed their urban warfare skills as they countered the threat of snipers, booby traps, mortars and bombs. Riot gear became an integral part of the British soldier's kit.\n\nThe introduction of rubber bullets and plastic baton rounds proved controversial. Although classified as non-lethal weapons, their use against rioters resulted in the deaths of several civilians.\n\nDecommissioning\n\nThe 'Good Friday Agreement' marked a return to devolved government in Northern Ireland with the establishment of a power-sharing administration.\n\nAn integral part of the agreement was the cessation of paramilitary violence and the decommissioning of stocks of illegal arms.\n\nBritish Army numbers and installations in the region were reduced and security procedures gradually relaxed.\n\nTroops leave\n\nWhile the process of normalisation continued, sectarian violence and paramilitary crimes still occurred. The main threat was from paramilitary splinter groups like the Real IRA who carried out the Omagh bombing in August 1998, killing 29 people. This was the worst atrocity of the 'Troubles'.\n\nIn August 2005, in response to the PIRA declaration that its campaign was over, it was announced that the British military deployment would end on 31 July 2007.\n\nSecurity was then transferred to the police. The only troops left in Northern Ireland were there for training purposes."
