The anti-occupation/anti-coalition forces are believed to be predominantly, but not exclusively, Iraqi Sunni Muslim Arabs, plus some foreign Arab and Muslim fighters, some of the latter tied to al-Qaeda. Several minor coalition members have pulled out of Iraq; this has been widely considered a political success for the anti-occupation forces.\n\nDespite this, there was a reduction in violence throughout Iraq in the start of 2004 due to reorganization within the insurgent forces. During this time the tactics used by coalition forces were studied and the insurgency began to plan a new strategy. The calm did not last long however and once the insurgency had regained its footing attacks resumed and increased. Throughout the remainder of 2004 and continuing into the present day, the insurgency has employed bombings as their primary means of combating the coalition forces. This has led to hundreds of Iraqi civilians and police killed in addition to the coalition forces they were fighting. Many were killed in a series of massive bombings at mosques and shrines throughout Iraq. The bombings indicated that as the relevance of Saddam Hussein and his followers was diminishing, radical Islamists, both foreign and Iraqi was increasing to take their place. An organized Sunni insurgency, with deep roots and both nationalist and Islamist motivations, was becoming clear. The Mahdi Army also began launching attacks on coalition targets and to seize control from the Iraqi security forces. The southern and central portions of Iraq began to erupt in urban guerilla combat as coalition forces attempted to keep control and prepared for a counteroffensive.\n\nIn response to insurgent attacks, coalition forces focused on hunting down the remaining leaders of the former regime, culminating in the shooting deaths of Saddam's two sons in July. In all, over 200 top leaders of the former regime were killed or captured, as well as supports and military personnel during the summer of 2004.\n\nBattle/Operation name From date To date Location Purpose/Result Operation Gimlet Victory 2004 2004 Operation Hickory View 2004 2004 Counterinsurgency and Security: Helped eliminate many of the established indirect fire patterns, which insurgents had used in the past Operation I CAN 2004 2004 throughout Iraq Humanitarian: Soldiers distributed over 100 boxes of donated school supplies and toys to Iraqi children.

During early and mid-May 2005, the U.S. also launched Operation Matador, an assault by around 1,000 Marines in the ungoverned region of western Iraq. Coalition and Iraqi soldiers, Iraqi fighters and civilians have been killed in these conflicts. As of late July 2007, nearly 3,700 U.S. soldiers have been killed, and around ten times this many have been wounded. The number of Iraqi citizens who have fallen victim to the fighting has risen. The Iraqi government, with some holdovers from the CPA, engaged in securing control of the oil infrastructure (a source of Iraq's foreign currency) and control of the major cities of Iraq. The insurgency, the developing the New Iraqi Army, disorganized police and security forces, as well as a lack of revenue have hampered efforts to assert control. In addition, former Baathist elements and militant Shia groups have engaged in sabotage, terrorism, open rebellion, and establishing their own security zones in all or part of a dozen cities. The Allawi government vowed to crush the insurgency.\n\nAn election for a government to draft a permanent constitution took place during this time (ed. see Politics of Iraq for more information on the political state of Iraq). Although some violence and lack of widespread Sunni participation marred the event, much of the eligible Kurd and Shia populace participated. Sectarian violence has also been prominent part of the militant and guerrilla activity. Targets here where often Shia gatherings or civilian concentrations mainly of Shias. As a result, over 700 Iraqi civilians died in the month.\n\nBattle/operation name From date To date Location Purpose/result Operation Attleboro(Iraq) 2005 2005 Humanitarian: Delivered a variety of much-needed supplies and equipment to the Iraqi Police of Ash Sharqat Operation Avarice 2005 2006 Military intelligence acquired over 400 Iraqi rockets and warheads containing chemical agents in secret to keep them from falling into the hands of enemy combatants Operation Dunlap 2005 2005 Operation East Lansing 2005 2005 Operation Hudson 2005 ????????

Sectarian violence expanded to a new level of intensity following the al-Askari Mosque bombing in the Iraqi city of Samarra, on 22 February 2006. The explosion at the mosque, one of the holiest sites in Shi'a Islam, is believed to have been caused by a bomb planted by Al-Qaeda in Iraq.

Shiite mortar teams quickly retaliated, firing 10 shells at Sunni Islam's most important shrine in Baghdad, badly damaging the Abu Hanifa mosque and killing one person. Eight more rounds slammed down near the offices of the Association of Muslim Scholars, the top Sunni Muslim organisation in Iraq, setting nearby houses on fire. Two other mortar barrages on Sunni neighborhoods in west Baghdad killed nine and wounded 21, police said.[18]\n\nAfter capture in December 2003, Saddam Hussein was hanged on 30 December 2006, after being found guilty of crimes against humanity by an Iraqi court.[19]\n\nBattle/operation name From date To date Location Purpose/result Operation Industrial Revolution 10 August 2006 10 August 2006 Southeast Fallujah/Industrial Sector Cordon and Search looking for roadside and car bomb Making Facilities Operation Iron Arrow I 2006 2006 Obeidi region, northern portion Counterinsurgency: Conducted to root out terrorists on the Sunni side of town Operation Post Hawk 2006 2006 Operation Unified Fist 2006 2006 Baghdad Counterinsurgency: Operation Baghdad is Beautiful January 2006 January 2006 Baghdad Humanitarian: Cleanup up Baghdad Operation King Tut January 2006 January 2006 Baghdad Security: Searched for weapons caches Operation Red Bull January 2006 January 2006 the \"Triad\" area of Haditha, Haqlaniyah and Barwana Security: The search revealed 75 weapons caches terrorists planned to use during attacks in the region.
