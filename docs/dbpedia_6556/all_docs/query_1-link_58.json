        "text": "“Gaslight” was a suspense thriller directed by George Cukor and drawn from Patrick Hamilton’s 1938 play “Angel Street.” A 1940 British film adaptation preceded Cukor’s version, but MGM, the American production studio, conspired to clear the runway for its own film by having all prints of the 1940 one destroyed. (Spoiler alert: Like its beleaguered heroine, it survived.) But it is only in the Hollywood version that the female lead, played by Ingrid Bergman, became the psychological focus of the film, as a woman teetering on the edge of hysteria.\n\nThe plot is set in motion by a shocking murder: An orphan girl, Paula Alquist, races down the stairs to find her aunt, a world-famous opera singer, lying strangled on the floor. The case goes cold, but a decade later Paula is swept up in a whirlwind romance with her piano accompanist, Gregory Anton, who cajoles her into returning to her aunt’s long-dormant London townhouse. Once there, Gregory adopts a mien of protective pity even as he shreds her sense of reality. He dims the gaslights in the house but denies it, and then deludes her into believing she’s lost an heirloom brooch and that she purloined a precious painting. Soon enough, Paula is awash in uncertainty and wondering if she’s lost her marbles.\n\nIt’s that villainously manufactured epistemic crisis — the thought of someone ripping out the underpinnings of your basic sanity — that thrilled audiences and anchored the film’s legacy. But “Gaslight” is far more interesting than its one-note reputation.\n\nWhat gets strangely forgotten is that the act of gaslighting is actually built on the even more gutting fear of home invasion.\n\nWhat we learn by the film’s end is that Gregory Anton is actually the same man who murdered Paula’s wealthy aunt but was forced to flee before he could discover the whereabouts of her precious jewels. Undeterred, he went on to stalk, court, and marry Paula to regain access to the townhouse, seize the jewels, and, with Paula consigned to an insane asylum, snatch away the remainder of the estate. While gaslighting is a sinister tool in the villain’s arsenal, the deeper paranoia reflected here is about having our households waylaid by a nefarious, smooth-talking intruder.\n\nTo understand why the home invasion plot hit with especially resounding force in the early 1940s, we have to recollect the high-stakes geopolitical context of the era. “Gaslight” uses home invasion as a proxy for the fear, rampant during World War II, of domestic infiltration. The fear, put simply, was that the borders of the nation — the homeland — could be breached by spies who might infest communities and even families.\n\nIf that fear was palpable in 1944, it was because the threat was real. Starting in the mid-1930s, Nazi Germany had launched a highly coordinated operation to steal US military secrets, map US defense systems, and undermine American solidarity through racist and antisemitic propaganda. The agents burrowed in like moles. One opened a restaurant. Another worked at an airline. Others worked for delivery services. All this would get exposed in the splashy trial of a group known as the Duquesne Spy Ring, whose activities remain the largest espionage case in American history.\n\nThe spy allegory never breaks through to the film’s surface, but the parallels are clear. Gregory Anton has a foreign accent, uses an alias, holds a prior loyalty (he’s already married to someone other than Paula), and sabotages Paula’s sense of security. All these factors code him as a treacherous infiltrator in ways that would have resonated in an era of wartime paranoia.\n\n“Gaslight” contains a triumphant undercurrent of patriotic zeal, and that’s part of what makes the defeat of Gregory Anton and his accomplices so satisfying. But it’s also important to step back and reflect on how this trope as a political weapon can be a dangerously double-edged sword. It was, after all, the fear of domestic infiltration that drove President Franklin D. Roosevelt to forcibly relocate more than 125,000 Americans of Japanese descent into mass internment camps.\n\nIn fact, to rewatch “Gaslight” in the 21st century is to experience an unnerving recognition of how the threat of domestic infiltration has been taken up as a powerful cudgel by populist demagogues. In Asia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi consolidated support in India by casting his country’s Hindu majority as the “true sons of the soil” and tarring the Muslim minority as foreign invaders. In Europe, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán endorsed the Great Replacement Theory to stir fears that native Eastern Europeans are being marginalized by an influx of Arabs and Jews. Politicians in Spain’s Vox party have called for the “permanent militarization of the border” to stave off an immigrant “invasion.” Meanwhile, here in the United States, former president Donald Trump has repeatedly inflamed fears over an “invasion” of caravans of Mexican immigrants.\n\nMake no mistake: “Gaslight” should get props for birthing the concept of gaslighting. But that bit of trivia egregiously undersells the film’s subterranean political allegory. No film better distills our primal fears of nefarious home invasion and, by extension, the populist appeals to nativism that are now commonplace.\n\nSo if you overhear the canard that gaslighting is the main takeaway from “Gaslight,” here’s the right clapback: Don’t gaslight “Gaslight.”"
