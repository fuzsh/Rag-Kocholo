        "text": "Hello, my name is Eric Louie. I am the scheduling manager here at CCM, and in this video, I guide you through the recital scheduling procedure.\n\nFirst, we’ll need to set up a meeting in order to look at recital slot availability, walk through the paperwork, and look at CCM’s major event calendar so that you and your other performers can avoid any conflicts with any ensembles, productions, guest artists, or other important events. Recitals are scheduled one semester in advance. During the initial scheduling phase, I schedule Fall and Summer recitals in early April and Spring recitals in late October or early November. I have an entire week of recital scheduling, with Artist Diploma students meeting with me to schedule on Monday, doctoral Tuesday, Master’s on Wednesday, Bachelor’s on Thursdays and overflow and second recitals on Friday. Keep an eye out for instructions in your UC email which will tell you how to sign up for an appointment.\n\nIf you happen to miss this initial week of scheduling, don’t worry. Just email the scheduling office and we can set up an individual appointment with you to get your recital scheduled. Just beware that the longer you wait to schedule your recital, the fewer options there are for recital slots as they will fill up really quickly.\n\nPlease prepare for your appointment by discussing your availability with your teacher, chamber group, and collaborators. When we meet, we will discuss the availabilities of the recital venues and also look to see which major events are scheduled on or around that date. Once you select your recital slot, I will hold it for you for two weeks while you fill out the paperwork and get signatures from your teacher. If you need additional time to complete your paperwork, please email me. If I have not heard from you after two weeks, your hold will be removed, and other students will be able to sign up for that recital slot.\n\nThe recital paperwork is now completely online. You can access the form online through this link.\n\nTo fill out this form, you will need your M number, UC email address, your teacher’s UC email address, and the date, time, and venue of the recital slot that you signed up for at the appointment. Doctoral students giving a lecture will also need to provide an email for your lecture advisor and cognate recitals will need the academic dean’s signature. After you fill out the form, you can download a copy for your records. A copy will be automatically emailed to your teacher for them to digitally sign, and once signatures are complete, a finished copy will be sent to the scheduling office.\n\nHere is an example of what the form looks like. Be sure to complete each section fully. Please indicate any equipment needs, especially if you are using piano or harpsichord in your recital. Harpsichords in particular are moved around CCM all the time and tuned to different temperaments like A415, so you will need to request it in advance so we can be sure it is reserved and tuned to your needs for your recital and rehearsals. If you are a DMA student giving a lecture recital and you need the projector, please indicate that as well. Please note that the projector connects via HDMI or VGA cables, so if you have a Mac with a different connection, you’ll need to provide your own adaptor.\n\nIf you need to make any changes to your equipment needs, just send an email to the scheduling office at least 2 weeks prior to your recital.\n\nLet’s discuss some policies and a few important items. Only degree-required recitals are allowed in the spring semester. Non-required recitals can still be held off-campus in the spring, or on-campus in the fall or summer.\n\nIf you are a DMA student giving your lecture recital, your topic must be approved by the committee before you schedule your recital. You will be asked to submit a copy of the topic approval letter when you submit your paperwork.\n\nAll paperwork and fees for cancellation or rescheduling from prior semesters must be completely resolved before signing up for a new recital.\n\nStandard recital slots are Monday through Friday at 5, 6:45, and 8:30 pm. The availability of these recital slots vary depending on the hall schedule. Sometimes classes or an event will make a recital slot unavailable. Weekend times are by faculty permission only. Summer recitals are held in 3250 and Watson only, at 5 or 6:45 pm.\n\nIf you would like to give your recital off-campus, please fill out the recital reservation form with your off-campus location. You do not need to meet with scheduling to fill out the form. You are responsible for setting everything up with the venue and covering any rental or tuning fees. If you have any questions about off-campus recitals, please let me know.\n\nThis is a list of the recital venues. Because availability is so limited, Patricia Corbett Theater and Cohen are only available for percussion recitals, composition, conducting, and recitals with setups too big for a different stage.\n\nTo set up rehearsals, please contact the scheduling office at 513-556-9430. You are allowed 2 hours of dress rehearsal in the hall, and you can schedule up to 2 months in advance of your recital. You can have one 2 hour session, or split it into two 1 hour sessions. Please note, if your recital is scheduled for PCT or Cohen, you will only have access to the hall the day of your recital. Please contact the scheduling office and let us know what time you would like into the hall, and if you need the space locked or unlocked throughout your reservation.\n\nIf you need to cancel or reschedule your recital, you must submit paperwork no less than 2 weeks prior to your recital date unless the cancellation is due to an emergency circumstance. An unexcused cancellation or rescheduling of your recital date will incur a $100 cancellation fee assessed to your catalyst account.\n\nIllness (including COVID related instances), injuries, family emergencies, snow days, and school cancellations are all excused from the fee under the cancellation policy. Depending on your specific circumstance, you may be asked for documentation before the cancellation fee is waived.\n\nWe will not waive cancellation fees if you are not prepared for the performance or for scheduling conflicts.\n\nThere is a grace period that extends 3 weeks into Fall semester, and 2 weeks into spring. You can cancel or reschedule your recital without penalty if it is due to an ensemble assignment or faculty conflict. Please note that this grace period does not cover scheduling conflicts with your chamber group, auditions, conferences, or if you scheduled a vacation to Disney World.\n\nThe full cancellation policy and all of the forms can be found on the CCM scheduling website.\n\nFinally, let’s discuss programs. The scheduling office will generate a program for your recital, even if it is off campus. We need your program content in a word document 2 weeks prior to your recital date so that we have time to generate your program, edit it, and have it printed. You will receive a reminder email with a template and formatting guidelines as your recital approaches. You can also find the template on the CCM scheduling website. After you send in your information, you will receive a proof; you can make any corrections needed, then a few days prior to your recital, pick up your program at the performance management office, and take it to your recital. Please note, we are no longer requiring you to submit a teacher-signed paper copy of your program.\n\nHere is an example of what a finished program looks like."
