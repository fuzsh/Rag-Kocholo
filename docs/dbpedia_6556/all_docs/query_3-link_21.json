        "text": "Spencer noted that the Iraqi people in Basra initially welcomed Coalition forces after they had been violently oppressed and disempowered by Saddam’s regime.\n\n“Generally the people were friendly and hospitable. They were open and welcoming because obviously prior to us arriving they had been oppressed because they were in the minority”\n\nHowever, a power vacuum was created after removing Saddam Hussein and Baath Party members from their positions. Widespread looting, crime and violence threatened to destabilise Iraq. Key areas of infrastructure were destroyed and there were high levels of unemployment.\n\nHigh hopes in the Coalition turned into frustration and there were huge economic implications of trying to remove all trace of Saddam Hussein and his government.\n\nThe Iraqi security sector was dismantled and the Iraqi Army was disbanded, leaving thousands of soldiers without salaries or pensions. This footage shows a 2004 protest outside government offices in Basra, in relation to the loss of pensions by former Iraqi soldiers.\n\nIraq’s currency was largely replaced by the US dollar by the time of Spencer’s deployment but he still managed to collect some Iraqi currency notes which all bear the image of Saddam Hussein, highlighting his continued legacy.\n\nFor Spencer, British forces were “managing it to the best of their ability” but there was a growing insurgency developing that they were not prepared for.\n\nThe short notice and speed with which British forces had been deployed to Iraq had been marked by a shortage of equipment. It was noted that some personnel did not have the correct desert clothing or body armour and there were shortages of ammunition.\n\nReturning home\n\nReservists fought and died alongside members of the Regular Army but once their tour ended, they would frequently return straight back to their civilian life. Spencer spent 6 months in Iraq before his tour came to an end.\n\n“I flew straight from a conflict, a lot of pressure, a lot of stress, and straight to Paderborn to Germany. As you can imagine it’s rather instantaneous”.\n\nA period of decompression after active service is now normal but for Spencer and his wife, the intensity and speed of returning to civilian life came as a surprise.\n\n“I just remember from my perspective, it happened so quickly, Spencer coming back home…Spencer was home, I think he had another 2 weeks off with me and then went back to normal routine and work,” his wife recalled.\n\nToday reservists are currently involved in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) on Operation Shader. For Spencer, the possibility of returning to Iraq was too high and he left the reservists soon after returning home. Items he collected from his tour, as well as his account of how he served his “Queen and country”, are now held at IWM and serve as a reminder of his and other reservists’ roles in Iraq during a period of difficult transition."
