        "text": "The Xindi Conflict was a major war centered between the New Xindus Cooperative and the Interstellar Coalition that began on 3 August 2153 with the Xindi massacre known as the First Strike and lasted until 21 January 2157 with the New Xindus Surrender. It involved numerous worlds and superpowers against the unified Xindi, which were assembled in one major alliance: the Interstellar Coalition.\n\nUnknown to either side until the final days of the war was that the entire conflict had been orchestrated by the Reaper Monarch in an attempt to use the Xindi to conquer the Citadel and the Jo’avwI trying to disrupt its activities.\n\nUltimately more than a hundred worlds were directly or indirectly affected in one of the largest wars in modern galactic history. More than 11.7-billion were killed, largely because of enormous increases in lethality of weapons, thanks to new technology, without corresponding improvements in protection or mobility. The Xindi Conflict happened concurrently with the 2153 Romulan War of Succession, the Borderland Blitz and the Second Xindi Civil War, though is considered to be the prescipating event that caused all three conflicts.\n\nBackground\n\nRead More: Collector Crisis\n\nThe Xindi Conflict can be tracked all the way back to its beginnings in April 2152, when the UES Enterprise successfully destroyed the primary Collector base inside the accretion disc near the Galactic Core, rendering the species and the Reaper's primary agent extinct. In response, the Reapers decided to reactivate the Citadel Relay and begin their purge of all sentient organic life, feeling that the species of the galaxy as a whole and Humanity in general had begun to stray enough from their grand plan of galactic culling. However attempts to reach out to the Citadel Relay returned no results and though the structure remained, the Keepers abroad it did not seem to recognize the Reaper's activation order. In order to respond to this troubling problem in their plans, the Reapers activated the Reaper Monarch on New Xindus, where the five remaining and fractious Xindi sub-species were in the process of unsuccessfully terraforming the world.\n\nSeeing the Xindi as a possible new servant race to assist Monarch back to the Citadel and manually restart the structure's immense Mass Relay, the Reaper began the subtle indoctrination of the Xindi. Due to being limited in power, the Reaper was forced to slowly and selectively indoctrination, unable to manage subjugating an entire population at once.\n\nThis paid off by November 2152 when the unknowing Xindi formed the New Xindus Cooperative. Couple with this Monarch provided several Xindi with knowledge to 'discover' the Mass Relays in the Delphic Expanse. The result was the rapid expansion of Xindi influence and wealth, resulting in the Xindi fleets almost collectively tripling in size and power. Monarch however began to promote a subconscious xenophobia and culture egotism, encouraging the Xindi to conquer neighboring worlds to absorb their people and resources to further Monarch's future plans by feeding off the rampant fear of losing another homeworld, following the Destruction of Xindus.\n\nIt was Monarch's ultimate intention to topple the superpowers to the galactic north of the Delphic Expanse, focusing on Humanity which was proving too adaptable and fast expanding to properly conform to any of the Reapers designs or plans.\n\nIt wasn't until 2 January 2153 that the New Xindus Cooperative voted for a slow state of preparation for the coming war. Their first act was to begin consolidating their positions among the newly unlocked Mass Relay network. This involved the occupation of all worlds among the Relay connections. New Xindus was however voted down from becoming the new wartime command center, instead the position was appointed to Azati Prime II. This was to the Xindi an intention to avoid drawing conflict towards their still unfinished homeworld and unknowingly by Monarch to protect its position while it re-charged itself.\n\nXindi Advances\n\n“We are at war, my dear. A war we have no chance of winning.”\n\n-Queen Romina of Nalia, Blitz of Betazed, 2153\n\nInvasion of Illyria Prime\n\nRead More: Invasion of Illryia Prime\n\nOn 25 February 2153, the New Xindus Cooperative activated the four Mass Relays in the Azati Prime-system and Azati Minor-systems, fortifying their positions and locating valuable resources to exploit in the Galen, Cleon and New Xindus-systems.\n\nConcurrently, Xindi First Fleet sailed through the Mass Relay at Azati Prime-system and secured its terminus end in the Illyria-system and annexed the Illyrian homeworld of Illyria Prime and the government of the Illyrian Confederation, then executing President of the Illyrian Confederation, Menno Valkaos, for ‘war crimes’ against the New Xindus Conclave, along with most of the Illyrian Confederation’s surviving military officers and members of Illyrian Parliament.\n\nDue to the brutality of the attack and the fast fall of the government, surviving Illyrian ships fled the system, attempting to setup resistance or support for civilians still trapped on Illyria Prime.\n\nStalemate at the Hugora Nebula\n\nOver the next two months the Xindi fleets expanded outward again to control the two systems connected by the Cleon Mass Relay, the uninhabited systems of Penthara and Norellus. Both were used for the construction of major forward stations. By this time scouts from the Unified Kingdom of Inkaaran, becoming concerned about the Xindi imperial expansion, deduced how to unlock the Mass Relays around their home system and moved to quickly secured all approaches towards their worlds. Inkaaran fleets moved into the El Gatark, Muratas and Lemme-systems and the Inkaaran Royal forces began to setup defensive positions and minefields, while the Inkaaran First, Second and Fourth fleets were deployed to the Hugora Nebula, in anticipation of the approaching Xindi fleet from the Penthara Mass Relay.\n\nThe Xindi intended to move and occupy the Inkaarans, still remembering the First Xindi-Inkaaran War, the Inkaaran Alliance Occupation of Xindus and the eventual Second Xindi-Inkaaran War of the 2030-40s, however upon taking control of the mass Relays of Beloti-system and the Hugora Nebula were secured by the Xindi, attempts in early-May 2153 to cross into the Inkaara system were rebuffed by a massive buildup by the Inkaara Royal Fleet. It was made clear by the Inkaaran royal family that the Xindi were not to approach the Mass Relay to the Inkaara-system. The Xindi Council votes not to antagonize the Inkaarans for the time being and instead move on to securing the last of the three Relays in the Hugora Nebula.\n\nBlitz of Malcor III and Betazed\n\nRead More: Blitz of Malcor III\n\nRead More: Blitz of Betazed\n\nBy mid-May and early June of 2153, the Xindi annexed Malcor III and Betazed, along with the corresponding Relays in their systems. The pre-warp world of Malcor III was able to offer no sustained resistance and the Xindi enslaved the nativeMalcorians, in order to mine their world's extensive mineral reserves. The psychological/sociological trauma of first contact rendered those Malcorians free from Xindi enslavement fractious and violent. 520-thousand Malcorians were killed by the Xindi before a puppet government was put in-place.\n\nFrom the Malcor-system and into the Beta Veldonna-system, the Xindi only waited eleven-days before invading the peaceful telepathic Betazoids in the Blitz of Betazed on 7 June 2153. As the Betazoids had only achieved space flight in 2139, let alone fielded anything close to a military navy, they were unprepared and forced to surrender after only three days of battle and 3.2-million deaths, including almost a third the Royal Family of Betazed.\n\nBecause of its fertile soil, the Xindi used Betazed to provide food and biota to Xindi forces on the frontlines. The Betazoids however were able to hide their telepathic powers, for fear of being used as weapons by the Xindi or worse exterminated as a threat. A sizable resistance movement however developed to counter the Xindi, led by Betazoid Queen Nalia, even as the New Xindus Cooperative used the system's Relays to secure Tandar and the Argolis Cluster.\n\nConquest of Tandar Prime\n\nRead More: Conquest of Tandar Prime\n\nFighting with the Union of Tandar was very extensive, as the Tandaran military gave the Xindi the first true fight of their imperialistic push. Director Haon Gulev, the leader of the Union's military council, eventually offered to sign a military alliance with the Xindi in exchange for a cease fire. Xindi warships were to remain 800,000-kilometers from Tandar Prime until Gulev arrived to sign the treaty. However when Gulev's transport arrived to board the Xindi flagship XSS Yunaak'oa to sign the cease fire order, his shuttle was shot down by Xindi fighters.\n\nThe Xindi had used the ploy to move into direct line of Tandar Prime's orbit and had moved 29 asteroids into staggered positions. While the Union military engaged the Xindi fleet, the Xindi held their direct attention and fire away from the asteroids as Tandar Prime's continued orbit around its star, couple with its somewhat higher gravity, pulled the asteroids in to strike on the 29 largest Tandaran cities.\n\nBy the time the last Union warship was destroyed, Tandar Prime had been softened enough where a ground occupation force was barely required to conquer the planet. 600,000 Tandarans were killed in the strikes, the largest single civilian death-toll during the Xindi Conflict barring the Xindi First Strike and the Union of Tandar fell as the first true combatant of the New Xindus Cooperative.\n\nSecuring the Northland Relay\n\nAt the end of June 2153, the Xindi move into the Draylon-system, the closest Relay point to the worlds occupied by the largest galactic superpowers like the Vulcan Confederacy, Klingon Empire, United Earth and the Andorian Empire. The Draylon Relay was heavily fortified and the system's sole habitable world of Draylon II became a fortress. The Brellick Habitat was moved into orbit of the Southland Relay to act as a waypoint. Spy missions were launched on nearby target worlds, through a Mass Relay located in a region known as the Northland by the native worlds, taking special care to note critical assets and infrastructure but not to expose the Xindi's presence.\n\nXindi Invasion\n\n\"Two years ago, we crossed a new threshold, took a step out into the galaxy on a noble quest of exploration and discovery, to reach out to new worlds and new civilizations, to go where no man or woman has gone before. Today that threshold has slapped us back. But it is too late for us to return to cradle, to somehow restore the sense of isolation and safety we had when we believed we were alone in the universe. We must stand up to the bullies, we must right the wrongs, we must be better than the highest bar we set and most importantly, we must move forward, or risk slipping back into darkness.\"\n\n-Admiral Maxwell Forrest, August Wave Memorial Service, Tokyo, 2153\n\nFinal Preparations\n\nWhile Monarch's indoctrination was slow and stubble, it however seemed to take its best roots in the Xindi-Reptilians, whose native paranoia and xenophobia led to take an increasingly hostile and imperialistic stance inside the New Xindus Cooperative. It had intended to use the Xindi's fear of losing another homeworld to cause them to decimate the entire region and leave the collective superpowers fractured and crippled before a Xindi empire would take control, with Monarch at the helm. However it quickly found the Xindi-Reptilians too eager to enact its plans.\n\nMonqarg Program\n\nWhen the Xindi-Primate Councilmen Barga Degra began design the Xindi super-weapon, codenamed the Monqarg Program, intending to use it to destroy whole worlds and knock the neighbouring superpowers into submission and out of a war, Xindi-Reptilian Councilmen Guruk Dolim however thought the projected 5-year completion plan was too long. He instead opted to begin construction on nearly two dozen smaller crafts, prototypes originally designed by Degra in his first testing phase of Monqarg to inflict damage on scales much smaller but still more devastating. This program would be codenamed Ketin. The Council voted in January 2153 to allowed both Monqarg and Ketin to proceed, on the basis of whichever was completed first stage testing and showed the greatest chance of ultimate success, would be approved for final production.\n\nDisappearance of the Ort'ne Sect\n\nUnknown to the Xindi, operatives of the Jo’avwI Order discovered the development of the twin Xindi Planet-Killer project. Quickly deducing that several components used in the construction were of Collector design, the Jo’avwl believed the Xindi were victims of Collector manipulation and sought to destroy the project. At first, two operatives of the Boin Sect were deployed to assassinate the leaders of the two projects (Degra and Dolim), a third was meant to destroy all data so no attempt could be made to replicate the technologies. Yet within one week after arriving on New Xindus all operatives went silent and were presumed dead. A second attempt with an entire team of operatives disappeared after only four days.\n\nIn concern the Jo’avwl deployed an operative of the Ort'ne Sect, however contact was lost after only two days. Fearing something was amiss Lady Sarin of Cial Convoy sent the entire Ort’ne Sect with the intent to completely topple the Xindi government by any means. All operatives went dark within hours of arriving. In total thirteen of the top agents of the Jo’avwl had been lost but what was most troubling was that the Xindi government made no notice of the loses.\n\nKemocite Deception\n\nIf a covert effort to remove the program was unachievable, Sarin instead decided an overt method must be used to remove the Xindi. If the Xindi were provoked into using the technology of the Planet-Killer too soon and incited enough fear on a galactic scale, the surrounding races could perform a ‘pile on’ effect and topple the Xindi. It was Sarin's ultimate hope that Klingon Empire, being the strongest of the local powers, would take the reigns of that unification and eventually assume its ancestral role as the core of the Jo'avwI Order.\n\nSarin took note that the Xindi’s supply of kemocite, critical to both the Ketin and Monqarg Programs, was all supplied via the Xindi-Arboreal colony of Azati Minor Vb or Yergdec. Kemocite was a multiphasic isotope of a radiolytic compound and in both programs, used to build phase focusing fields for the reverse-wave motion device, the primary firing mechanism of the weapon. Sarin arranged for a bomb to be planted along one of the lesser fault lines on Yergdec. When it detonated, the result was an earthquake that knocked out the power systems to the main refineries. This damage reduced production levels to 70%, meaning the colony could not meet the demands needed to supply the weapon on its predetermined time table. As the colony was on charter by the Xindi Council, such an occurrence spelled its doom via financial collapse.\n\nWhen desperation set in that their charter could be revoked, the Jo’avwl arranged for the Orion Botchok Planetary Congress to sell Yergdec's foreman, Gralik Durr kemocite through Tarlac intermediaries, and not wanting appear weak, Durr would hide the news of their off-world trading.\n\nNow controlling the kemocite production, Jo’avwl enacted the next phase of her plan. They were aware that while the Monqarg Program would take the longest to complete, it would deal the greatest levels of damage in a shorter period of time, whereas Dolim's Ketin Program would be completed the fastest but had the greatest likelihood to leave the victims or survivors still strong enough to fight back. Sarin also believed that whoever's program was a success would be vaulted into a position of power and control in the Xindi government, Degra was considered too logical and emotionally stable to be manipulated for later gains, whereas Dolim's ego and rampant xenophobia was considered easiest to meld for future Jo'avwI needs. The Jo'avwI Grandmaster stubbly encouraged the Tarlac, through the Orions, to pressure Gralik Durr to schedule shipments for Dolim to get priority, thereby moving Dolim's program ahead of Degra's by several weeks.\n\nUnscheduled Launch\n\nWithin six-months Dolim's teams were successful in completing 27 prototypes, while Degra's was still four-years off from a tangible model. However the Council surprised Dolim and unknowingly the Jo'avwI when they noted that due to the faulty nature of the Ketin Program were faulty, most likely only good for two or three uses before it overloaded its power production plant and destroyed itself. Because Dolim could not and would not correct the issue, the Council voted to continue Monqarg program and mothball the Ketin Program as a fall back option.\n\nSarin could not allow this and had her operatives to begin influencing Dolim to make a demonstration of his programs success. It was Sarin's intent that Dolim would most likely use one of the worlds the Xindi had already conquered, such as Malcor III or Illyria Prime, as an example.\n\nHowever only due to Monarch's minimal indoctrination and the xenophobic and paranoid hallmarked by the Xindi-Reptilians, General Dolim launched the entire fleet of Ketin prototypes, using them to launch a surprise attack on the homeworlds of 25 different empires.\n\nXindi First Strike\n\nRead More: Xindi First Strike\n\nWithin six-months Dolim's teams were successful in completing all 27 proto-types, while Degra's was still four-years off. However the Council surprised Dolim and unknowningly Sarin when they noted that Dolim's weapons were faulty and most likely would be good for two or three uses before it overloaded and was destroyed. Because Dolim could not and would not correct the issue, the Council voted to continue Degra's program and mothball Dolims project as a fall back option.\n\nSarin could not allow this and stubly had her operatives to begin influencing Dolim to make a demostration of his programs success. It was Sarin's intent the Dolim would most likely use one of the worlds the Xindi had already conquered, such as Malcor III or Illyria Prime.\n\nHowever only due to Monarch's minimal indoctination and the xenophobic and paranoid hallmarked by the Xindi-Reptillians, General Dolim launched the entire fleet of proto-types already completed, using them to launch a surprise attack on the homeworlds of 25 different empires.\n\nOn 1 August 2153, before the Council could react, General Dolim attacked the worlds of Vulcan, Qo'nos, Caprica, Picon, Virgon, Hiigara, Takret, Krios Prime, Alpha-1, Axanar, Osaaria, Kantare, Kreetassa, Valakis, Romulus, Remus, Vissa, Rigel IV, Coridan, Earth, Andoria, Denobula, Paraaga, Xyrillia, Risa, Tellar Prime and Delta. Death toll ranges up to 9-billion, from nine million on Rigel IV to all of Romulus-system rendered uninhabitable.\n\nFirst Shots Fired\n\nReeling from the devastation caused on their homeworlds, the collective races hit by General Dolim's weapon attempted to scramble to maintain order. Millions had been killed and in the case of the Romulan Star Empire , their entire home solar-system had been blanketed in deadly radiation that left the entire area unapproachable.\n\nBefore the first day had passed, the New Xindus Council, after voting to censure General Dolim but to continue the war, decided to deploy the Xindi cruisers XSS Gurr'vak, Huyy'nal, Finn’ran, Kilixy, Navarin and Yunn'nir to launch distraction attacks while they moved as many forward units through the Northland Mass Relay to combat a anticipated counter-attack from the native powers.\n\nBattle of Vega\n\nRead More: Battle of Vega\n\nOn 4 August 2153, the first official exchange of fire took place in the still un-named Xindi Conflict, when the United Earth cruiser UES Enterprise attacked the XSS Gurr’vak which was raiding the United Earth colony of Surajkund for its high lead deposits, a necessary material for Xindi-Reptilian shipbuilding. Four Surajkund Defense Brigade frigates, the Asola, Timur, Aravalli and Anogeissus, had harassed the Gurr'vak for three-hours before finally retreating when the UES Enterprise intervened. After a protracted two-hour battle the Gurr'vak was damaged just enough to push it into the atmosphere of Surajkund, destroying the vessel with all hands. The first 'official' combat of the Xindi Conflict resulted in the first combat death for the Enterprise, Crewman Jane Taylor, along with the loss of a Xindi cruiser with all 60 hands.\n\nTriple Hits\n\nRead More: Bombing of Threllvia IV\n\nRead More: Massacre of Fi'von\n\nRead More: Razing of Hercules\n\nOn 5 August 2153, the battleships XSS Finn’ran, Kilixy and Navarin, attacked the United Earth colony on Hercules. The resultant attacked decimated the colony, killing nearly 16-million of the nearly 26-million colonists. On 6 August 2153, the XSS Huyy'nal bombarded the Andorian colony Threllvia IV, killing all 1,870 colonists. The next day the XSS Yunn'nir attacked the Vulcan science outpost Fi'von, destroying it with all scientists along with three out of date cruisers, killing 246 Vulcans. The three attacks effectively wiped out the front-line colonies of the three largest super powers and resulted in an immense civilian death toll.\n\nXindi Implication\n\nWith combined evidence that the Xindi, which had only been known to the Vulcan Confederacy in passing, were behind the attacks, the Vulcan Ninth Destroyer Group, the Andorian Second Frigate Squadron and the newly formed United Earth 1st Fleet tracked the returning XSS Huyy'nal and Yunn'nir back to the Northland Relay and made ready to strike.\n\nXindi Rush\n\nIn only five days since the Xindi First Strike, the Xindi had moved over 78 warships and 200-thousand ground military personnel through the Nortland Relay, the largest single movement of Xindi units in the entire war to date. On the 8 August 2153, the Xindi Fourth Destroyer Flotilla, Fourth and Fifth Xindi Fleets, the Eighty-First Frigate Squadron and the Twenty-Third Xindi Combat Group had departed the Northland Relay, taking with them the majority of the Xindi ground troops.\n\nThe Xindi Fourth Fleet deployed itself into the Hellespont Nebula, intending to use the already fracture region as their first conquest by raiding major worlds, such as Denobula and Tellar, keeping the fractions from organizing long enough for a large Xindi troop detachment to be deployed through the Northland Relay. The 81st Frigate Squadron was meant to raid the inner colonies of United Earth, intended to disrupt the largest empire in the region by the fact it lacked a truly mobile military to move on the offensive. The Xindi Fifth Fleet was launched into Andorian space, projected to destroy the critical outpost worlds the Andorians used to field their powerful but fuel guzzling warships.\n\nThe 23rd Combat Group and Xindi 4th Destroyer Flotilla moved to the Calor pulsar with the intention to raid Vulcan, whose fleet was rated as the strongest left standing after the First Strike. Commandant Dalop planned to use the bi-weekly radiation pulse on 11 August 2153 to mask the fleets approach and to bombard the Vulcan homeworld. No conquest was planned, just enough loss of life and materials to knock the stable Vulcan government out of the war and into isolationism.\n\nFall of the Romulan Star Empire\n\nRead More: Romulan War of Succession of 2153\n\nDue to the Xindi First Strike on Remus aggravated thalaron crystal veins that snaked the planet's surface and detonated, the resultant wave of thalaron radiation and debris ended all organic life on the Romulan homeworld before the gravitational turbulence and incoming fragments impacted, tearing off most of the outer crust of Romulus. The level of destruction was the most devastating though unintended phase of the Xindi First Strike as resulted in civil war.\n\nThe direct result of the loss of Romulus was the 2153 Romulan War of Succession, an armed conflict between surviving outer Romulan colonies supporting Romulan Civil States and inner core Romulan worlds supporting the Romulan Star Republic. This conflict ended with the defeat of the Star Republic forces, the conquest of the remaining Romulans into the Romulan Civil States and Star Republic Praetor Valdore committing suicide as a consequence.\n\nBattle of the Northland Relay\n\nRead More: Battle of the Northland Relay\n\nUnknown to Xindi forward elements deployed through the Northland Relay, the allied Vulcan Ninth Destroyer Group, the Andorian Second Frigate Squadron and United Earth First Fleet launched the first offensive action against the Xindi in what would later become known as the Battle of the Northland Relay on 9 August 2153. The United Earth, Andorian Empire and Vulcan Confederacy forces took heavy damage but the timely arrival of a Hiigaran, Cylon, Tellarite, Suliban, Vissan, Denobulan, Colonial and Krios fleet also tracking the Xindi attacks back to their source, turned the tide and allowed the allied forces to capture the Mass Relay.\n\nThe newly allied fleet loses numbered seven vessels destroyed against the Xindi's total of nine, including one of the largest Xindi-Aquatic battleships.\n\nFall of Denobula\n\n\"For one week the skies over Denobula were filled with ships, shuttles rushing day and night without pause to try and get as many people off world while massive destroyers and cruisers slugged it out with the Xindi. It was a time of chaos and loss, but one of unity and heartfelt mercy. For when the night had come to take Denobula, a dozen worlds who could not even stopped them, still stood against the abyss and said you will not take this world without a fight!\"\n\n-High Regent Coxolan, The Victory of Mercy at the Fall of Denobula, 2153\n\nBarely a day later on August 10th, receiving word of the victory at the Northland Relay, Commandant Dalop anticipating that his position would have to become one of entrenchment until reinforcements could arrive. Without the Mass Relays to provide swift transition of units from Azati Prime II to the front, the fastest Xindi reinforcements were nearly 6-months away. Dalop directed the 4th Destroyer Flotilla to break up into two groups, Squadron B and Squadron A; Squadron B sets course to invade and subdue the Denobulan colony of Mitey Inno, Destroyer Squadron A and the 23rd Xindi Combat Group were ordered to run silent towards Denobula.\n\nIn the spirit of cooperation and fears that the Xindi could launch another attack through the Northland Relay, which many scientists could still not figure out how to de-activate, the Confederacy of Vulcan, Andorian Empire, United Earth, Hiigaran Empire, United Planets of Tellar, Principality of Denobula, Association of Vissa, Cylon Imperium, Twelve Colonies of Kobol and the Sovereign Kingdom of Krios, agree to sign an emergency alliance, the Coalition Naval Accords, to patrol the Relay for the time being. Diplomats on all sides began to reach out to secure assistance from any other power that had also suffered Xindi attacks.\n\nConquest of Mitey Inno & Defeat at Andra\n\nRead More: Conquest of Mitey Inno\n\nRead More: Defeat at Andra\n\nBy the next morning, 11 August 2153, a distress call alerted Denobulan General Benixol that the Xindi Destroyer Squadron B's had conquered the Mitey Inno colony. Benixol deployed the Denobulan First Fleet to retake the settlement, along with reinforcements from the United Earth 2nd Fleet and the 34th Colonial Battle Group. The newly fleet formed near the Andra-system in an attempt to intercept and destroy Xindi Destroyer Squadron B. However three days of waiting for any sign of the aggressor gave way to surprise when the Xindi Destroyer Squadron B jumped into the heart of the fleet on August 14, 2153 and intentionally detonates the warp-cores on eight of their larger yet obsolete warships, decimating the United Earth-Denobulan-Colonial Fleet. The remaining Xindi ships turn back towards Mitey Inno, drawing away any allied vessels still capable to warp-drive. In the confusion Xindi Destroyer Squadron A broke through and advanced towards Denobula Trixia. Allied ship lost almost 14 total craft, including General Benixol's flagship, while the Xindi loses only number those ships they sacrificed.\n\nFive days later on August 19, Andorian recon units made flybys of Mitey Inno and quickly established that most of the population has been killed and the Xindi Destroyer Squadron B was not present. Concerned that group could be making a move against Denobula, Andorian General Thy'lek Shran notified allied forces and the Thirty-Fourth Colonial Battle Group redeployed back to the Denobulan homeworld as their ships were the fastest with the Colonial FTL-drive.\n\nFall of Denobula\n\nRead More: Fall of Denobula\n\nXindi forces under command of Commandant Dalop invaded Denobula on 20 August 2153, resulting in a week long battle between Coalition forces and the Xindi invasion fleet that was devastating for both sides.\n\nDenobula officially fell on the morning of 5 September 2153, when Xindi forces entered orbit and after suffering light damage from the orbital mine fields, bombarded Denobula's surface for five hours before landing ground troops. In total the Coalition and Denobulan forces has lost 89 ships to the Xindi 44 and almost 677-thousand lives, against the Xindi's 5,900.\n\nBy the afternoon, the Denobulan government collapsed as civil chaos erupted and Commandant Dalop personally led Xindi troops into the Palace of Havxin and ordered for Empress Ramxa IV to formally surrender and declare the Principality of Denobula an annexed territory of the New Xindus Cooperative. Her majesty's response was to detonating a low yield tactical warhead, vaporizing the entire eight-hundred year old Palace of Havxin , Dalop, four-troop transports, 400 Xindi and herself. With the government gone, the act of fighting the occupying Xindi under newly promoted Admiral Dhren was taken over by local resistance forces and the newly appointed Vice-Countess Midexla with the Denobulan government-in-exile on Axanar.\n\nSecuring the Northland\n\nWhile Denobula had been lost, the Northland Relay was successfully secured when Coalition combat engineers managed to perturb the element zero core of the artifact just enough to ensure that no ship could jump between the Northland and its still unknown terminus and ripping itself apart. This not only ensured a nearly fool-proof method to secure the instantaneous transport devices but in a matter of hours of its activation three Xindi ships fall prey to this action before catching on.\n\nCoalition on the Defense\n\n\"I was among the first to walk the ruins of P'Jem when the first relief teams landed in what was left of the settlements. If there was a point when I thought we weren't going to win this war, the first twenty-minutes of counting dead Vulcans who had been massacred by Xindi chemical weapons were it.\"\n\n-Doctor Van Traan, Battle of P'Jem, 2153\n\nFrom September to November of 2153, the newly formed Coalition was almost entirely on the defensive as they fought to entrench their worlds and establish the proper defenses to stave off invasion. By 11 September to 15 September, the evacuation transports carrying Denobulan refugees arrived at Anaxar, where Coalition officials grimly noted that the majority of the evacuees were children, nearly 80% rating as adolescent by Denobulan standards.\n\nBetrayal of the Jo'avwI\n\nDuring the Fall of the Denobula, the Jo'avwl Order discovered that agents of Klingon Intelligence and more importantly Jo'avwI's arch enemy the Gre'thor, had come to their own conclusion that the Xindi were behind the attack on Qo'nos. Seeking all connections to the Xindi, the Klingon Empire began intense investigations ranging from probing their diplomatic connections to the boarding trade vessels that had been logged to have traded with the Xindi.\n\nFearing the Gre'thor would discover the survival of the Jo'avwI Order or the Klingons would attack one of the neighboring powers, causing the still young Xindi Conflict to spiral into a region-wide war, further fracturing the quadrant while the unified Xindi could expand further without any to stand against them.\n\nIn order to focus the attention of the Klingons, the Jo'avwI secretly paid off Duras, Son of Toral, to lead Klingon Intelligence to the recovery of the kemocite used in the focusing fields of reverse-wave motion device and the records of several hundred kilo-tons of kemocite to the New Xindus Cooperative a year before the attack, led the Klingons to the to Botchok Planetary Congress and the Tarlac intermediaries.\n\nBorderland Blitz\n\nRead More: Borderland Blitz\n\nBy 15 September, the Coalition noted the Klingon Empire was beginning to move most of its heavy offensive units towards the border it shared with the Delphic Expanse. The United Earth flagship UES Enterprise, named the new Coalition flagship, was redeployed to the Klingon border in hope that the Klingon Empire could enter the war, as Coalition officials began to increase diplomatic overtures to the Empire. Concerns however began to rise when Klingon units appear to be massing not near the Empire's border with Delphic Expanse, but the Borderlands.\n\nHowever after six days of waiting, the Klingon Empire surprised the galaxy when on 21 September 2153 it launched the Borderland Blitz. Under false information provided by Duras, Son of Toral; Klingon Intelligence and by proxy the Klingon High Council blamed the Orions for the source of the Xindi probe attack and ordered the Borderlands to be invaded. During this stage in history the Borderlands were a region of Orion dominance. Ellora, Tarlac, Botchok, Dav'ir, B'Morgia, Tini, Volgas, Kammzdast, Zchol, Thirat, Syrenya, Noilth, Vab and Verex III, along with much of the Botchok Planetary Congress was completely conquered, while thousands native to the area flee for their lives. The Coalition member nations were stunned by the action, though fears of angering the Klingons during a time of war kept a formal protest from being lodged.\n\nIn order to counter the chaos created and to offer stability to the refugees starting to fill their ports, United Earth, Rigel, Coridan, Risa and Vulcan passed emergency resolutions on 22 September 2153, to begin accepting refugees from Elora, Tarlac and Botchok, along with minor groupings of other Borderland natives. Several thousand civilians were allowed to settle on Weytahn, Coridan, Pandora, Hellion Prime, Vulcan, Hiigara, Tesso Allo and Mars. Over two-million Orions, Elorans, Tarlac and a myriad of other Borderland natives resettle in total and accepted citizenship on Coalition worlds, while billions more remain in annexed Klingon space.\n\nInvasion of Roshanata XI\n\nRead More: Invasion of Roshanata XI\n\nWhile dealing with the refugee crisis created by the Klingons, the Xindi used the debacle to their advantage and attacked the Andorian colony of Roshanata XI, in the Mu Virginis-system on 28 September 2153. The Xindi Fourth Fleet, after their retreat from an attempted raid on Vulcan freighter convoys to their outer colonies and running low on supplies and fuel, invaded Roshanata XI after a protracted bombardment of the primary settlement. While the Andorian colonists fought valiantly they were only defended by three outdated Andorian frigates, along with a single Tellarite cruiser, which all fell within an hour. Invading Xindi killed the majority still alive on the outskirts of the settlement while survivors fled into the northern ice lands, which slow the Xindi-Reptilian and Xindi-Insectoid advance.\n\nOver 18,000 colonists were killed but Xindi deaths were significantly higher. With supplies almost gone and the salvaged materials from the colony's remains, Fleet Commander Drevid ordered almost 80% of his troops, the largest consumer of his food and medical supplies, to occupy the settlement. Without the majority of the Xindi-Reptilian, Xindi-Arboreal and Xindi-Insectiods infantry, only keeping the Primate and Xindi-Reptilian elite ground forces, Drevid managed to extend his food stores by almost two-months. While the Fourth Fleet moves on with the intention of raiding and occupying a more habitable Coalition world, promising to return for the remaining troops occupying Roshanata XI, by the first week's end, most of the Xindi-Reptilians perished in the cold weather conditions on the Andorian colony. Coupled with resistance fighters from the remaining colonists whittling down their numbers, nearly 34-thousand Xindi were killed or perished from hypothermia during the entire colony's occupation.\n\nLose of Juno Base\n\nRead More: Lose of Juno Base\n\nCoalition forces were delivered a sour victory on 5 November when the 81st Xindi Frigate Squadron attempted to raid the United Earth research base on Juno in the Sol-system. Asteroid 3 Juno was one of the largest main belt asteroids, and as such boasted the largest research complex in the Sol Asteroid Belt, almost entirely dedicated to the reserve engineering of captured Xindi technology.\n\nWhile all 11 Xindi Frigates were shot down, few had realized that most of the frigates were running on their last legs with skeleton crews. Raiding of United Earth trading convoys had been much more difficult than the Xindi had expect, as many freighters carried enough weaponry to defend themselves against the firepower of a Xindi frigate.\n\nAfter weeks of constant attacks, supplies and personnel had been reduced to almost nothing. Without support from the Northland Relay or hope to return to New Xindus Cooperative controlled space, the frigate squadron had resolved to cause as much damaged in a honorable warrior's way.\n\nA captured escape pod, supposedly carrying the Frigate Squadron's command officer, General Droxiph, was brought back to the Juno research base, only to detonate seconds after landing. A fifty-gram antimatter charged had been shielded inside and being as the detonation was directly within the perimeter of the base's dome, the explosion depressurized the entire structure, killing all 320 researchers and destroying three vessels.\n\nCapture of the XSS Rilik\n\nRead More: Capture of the XSS Rilik\n\nLooking for a wave to increase moral, which had been steadily falling as deaths and lost battles mounted, the UES Enterprise, against Coalition Command's direct ordered, mounted a surprise ambush on the Xindi-Reptilian cruiser XSS Rilik near Andoria on 22 December 2153. The Coalition flagship was severely damaged and six officers were killed, however a series of photo charges were transported past the Rilik's shields and detonated inside the primary conduits of the ship's power plant. In a matter of seconds the Rilik was dead in the water and a timely intervention from Andorian and Osaarian warships managed to capture her before the Xindi-Reptilians could scuttle her.\n\nWhile intending to use the capture as a way to boast trust in the Coalition, operatives and experts from each member nation worked in tandem to pull every secret they could from the Xindi cruiser. Engineering teams extensive examining the Mass Effect engines of the vessel while intelligence operatives began to pull apart the Rilik's databases for information. Pay dirt was struck when a deployment report received only minutes before the Enterprise's attack detailed the Rilik's route to join the Xindi Fourth Fleet before the Xindi were to move against the Vulcan colony of P'Jem.\n\nBattle of P'Jem & Romulans Entry to the War\n\nRead More: Battle of P'Jem\n\nCoalition forces quickly moved to secure the colony on 28 December 2153 but arrived a hour too late as the Xindi Fourth Fleet deployed shock-troops to the Vulcan colony, attacking the pacifist monastery community. The use of chemical weapons caused thousands of civilian deaths before the Xindi-Reptilians were forced into retreat.\n\nHowever ships of the Romulan Civil States under orders from newly crowned Romulan Emperor Donatra to intervened, the Romulans decimated the major warships of the Xindi while the Coalition engaged them head on.\n\nThe Xindi Fourth Fleet was completed destroyed and P'Jem secured, over 9,420 Vulcans and Coalition personnel were killed during the battle and three Coalition ships were lost.\n\nHowever the entire Xindi Fourth Fleet, twelve of the New Xindus Cooperative’s most advanced warships, were destroyed along with their crews of 1,240 killed.\n\nTide Turning\n\n“There shall no talking, no bargaining, no negiotation with the enemy when Coalition officers and citizens are being held under the barrel of a gun. Lords of Kobol curse you and be appeased by our actions. All ships fire at will.”\n\n-Admiral Edward Torres, Battle of Axanar, 2154\n\nWith the official joining of the Romulan Civil States and the addition of cloaking technology to the Coalition Fleet, a rapid series of counter-strikes were launched against the Xindi, forcing most of their forward offensive units back into Xindi held space.\n\nConquest of Samsara\n\nRead More: Conquest of Samsara\n\nOn the 1 January 2154, the new year saw two sudden but decisive victories and one defeat against the Xindi by Coalition forces. Xindi forces began an invasion of Samsara colony, leading the colonists to use the main colony ship to submerge the 15-million people safely at the bottom of the ocean. Xindi ground forces, assuming the settlement was abandoned and evacuated, as only small towns/villages occupy the shoreline, the Xindi occupied the area.\n\nBattle of Axanar\n\nRead More: Battle of Axanar\n\n3 January 2154, Commander Drevid ordered the Xindi 5th Fleet to attack the Jorine Shipyards in orbit of Axanar in hopes of stealing at least 42 warp coils for his forces. Two of the nine facilities were destroyed in the opening volley of the raid, an action that Commander Drevid hoped would force the other seven facilities to surrender and turn over the materials he wanted, before he destroyed them once and for all. However the stations refused, delaying Commander Drevid long enough for the Coalition Twelfth Fleet to preform one of the single largest FTL/Hyperspace jumps since the Hiigaran exodus from Kharak.\n\nUsing the quantum wave-front of three Avatar-class heavy cruisers, the HF Adora, Gush Etzion and Karkom, the fleet jumped into extreme Axanar orbit. While the Adora, Gush Etzion and Karkom were out of commission, depowering their entire energy reserves to accomplish the jump, the Colonial Columbia-class BS Hephaestus and Minerva, along with the newly christened Olympus-class BS Zeus, use pin-point jumps with tethered portions of remainder of the fleet’s assets to move into immediate airspace of the Jorine Shipyards.\n\nSince Commander Drevid noted the FTL jump signatures of three Battlestars, he assumed only three ships, and deployed the bulk of his fighter units and three destroyerrs to intercept, intending only to keep the Battlestars occupied until he could retreat. However the approaching fighters were lost as the 12th Fleet launched radar jammers and flash signature producing Swallows.\n\nAssuming it to be merely a distraction, Commander Drevid deployed the Fifth Fleets heaviest unit, the Battleship XSS Rliff, to intercept and destroy the Colonial units, while he began to deploy assault squadrons onto the shipyards. The Rliff was unprepared when the three Colonial units turned out to be the 43 ships of the 12th Fleet. Rliff did manage to get off several torpedo volleys, three Coalition ships before it too was shot down and lost with all hands.\n\nWhen Commander Drevid received word of the Rliff’s destruction, he knew the Colonial interlopers were not as they appeared and he most likely over estimated their assets and disposition. While his flagship and six other ships remained at the Jorine Shipyards to receive the now retreating assault shuttles while he sent the remaining nine vessels to engage and hold the Colonial units long enough.\n\nThe remaining 41 vessels of the Coalition Twelfth Fleet engaged the bulk of the Xindi 5th Fleet. 11 Coalition ships were lost,\n\nIncluding those killed when Commander Drevid destroyed two of the Jorine Shipyard facilities, 23-thousand personnel lost their lives in the largest battle of the war since the Fall of Denobula, primarily on the two orbital shipyards.\n\nNotwithstanding, Xindi deaths numbered 2,700 and 14 ships were destroyed as well, every ship Commander Drevid had launched against what he assumed was merely a Colonial trio. Only when the fleet entered range of the Shipyards and the Xindi officer declared he would open fire on the civilian facilities if he wasn’t allowed to retreat, did the 12th Fleet drop its sensor jammers, allowing Commander Drevid to see the 30 ships positioned against his seven.\n\nFrom the CNC of the 12th Fleet flagship, the BS Zeus, Admiral Edward Torres declared there would be talks with the Xindi in time of war and when civilians were being used as a bargaining chip. The entire Coalition force opened up with three immediate volleys of torpedo fire, followed by rapid fire blasts of phasers and kinetic rounds. With was over two-thirds of the Xindi Fifth Fleet being destroyed and seven ships heavily damaged, Commander Drevid ordered a retreat from Axanar.\n\nBattle of Tellar Prime\n\nRead More: Battle of Tellar Prime\n\nHeavily damaged and in retreat, Commander Drevid decided to attempt a dangerous and possibly impossible return to Xindi-held space, a measure that was so controversial to his crews since that meant abandoning those left on Roshanata XI, mutiny broke out on four of his remaining seven ships, forcing him to space three frigate crews to maintain order.\n\nCommander Drevid decide to launch the Xindi 5th Fleet in an attempt to distract Coalition forces and in order to accomplish that Commander Drevid intended to knock out the Yuverin Array on Tellar Prime, thereby allowing the Xindi fleet the ability to bypass several larger and powerful Coalition fleets before escaping into neutral territory.\n\nThe Xindi 5th Fleet attacked Tellar Prime on 22 Januar 2154 but since Commander Drevid had left most of his ground forces on Roshanata XI and could not mount even a minor ground operation to take out the Array, he ordered the planetary bombardment of Tellar as his ground forces secure and raid needed supplies.\n\nThousands of Tellarites were killed but the Coalition Second, Thirteenth and Seventh Fleets destroyed the already weakened vessels. Tellarite waning commitment to the Coalition was reaffirmed, when several Coalition vessels use themselves as shields to protect cities on Tellar. Coalition and Tellarite deaths number 547-thousand and four ships.\n\nHowever Fleet Commander Drevid was killed with the last remnants of the Xindi 5th Fleet, over 670 officers and seven ships.\n\nCoalition Naval Accords\n\n\"The Xindi have come to savage our world, a place we have poured our blood, sweat and tears into building. If they wish to bring it down, then it is only fair that they pay for it with their own blood, sweat and tears.\"\n\n-Governor Rohan Dslavia, Third Battle of Barnard's Star, 2154\n\nAs 2154 dawned on the war-torn empires, the Coalition moved to cement its power as a legitimate and legal government. On 21 January 2154, the Coalition Naval Accords were signed, whereas all member nations within the Coalition agreed to cede power of their collective militaries and have them merged into the Coalition Fleet. All forces were joined under a joint banner of cooperation and all ships have their prefixes changed to the I.C.S., to identify them as part of a Interstellar Coalition Ship. The new Coalition Fleet was placed under command of United Earth Admiral Maxwell Forrest, with Andorian Commandant Thy'lek Shran as his second.\n\nSingapore Space Command, which had until this point been the headquarters of the United Earth Starfleet, becomes the new Headquarters of Coalition Fleet.\n\nBattle of Magnus\n\nRead More: Battle of Magnus\n\nBarely two months later, on 9 March 2154, the Xindi light cruiser XSS Denem attacked the Coalition subspace communication relay on Brashear Station at Magnus colony, Wolf 359-system and was engaged by the Romulan light cruiser ICS Selis. The battle was the first military action fought by the Romulan Civil States without a direct counterpart from another Coalition member vessel. Denem was destroyed, almost 2/3 her crew captured and the survivors were interred at Württemberg Station in Magnus orbit. Coalition deaths however numbered 22 when the Denem opened fire and nearly destroyed Brashear Station, killing over half the crew.\n\nSinking of the Jewel\n\nRead More: Sinking of the Jewel\n\nAlmost a month later in April, the Coalition suffered the terrible Sinking of the Jewel disaster. The Tellarite passenger liner Jewel of Shallash was attacked and destroyed by Xindi corvette XSS Usanatir near the Liu Yang-colony, 47 Ursae Majoris-system. The Jewel of Shallash had departed from Risa five-days previous, returning medical patients and passengers to Tellar. 1195 of the 1959 passengers were killed, only 764 including crew survive. ICS Enterprise and Selis responded, driving off the Usanatir but not before the Coalition suffered the single largest civilian shipping death toll in the war.\n\nAs civil news agencies carried the news of the horrific attack on the Jewel, Xindi Admiral Dhren on occupied-Denobula decided to launch ships against Hellion Prime, in order to occupy the world and its sophisticated energy production systems, which could decimate the Coalition energy industry across seven sectors.\n\nFirst Battle of Barnard's Star\n\nRead More: First Battle of Barnard's Star\n\nOn 23 April 2154, the Xindi attacked Hellion Prime in the First Battle of Barnard's Star and attempted to deploy troops to occupy the colony. Heavy sand storms on the surface however caused multiple crashes and delaying actions long enough for counter-attacks by the Coalition to drive the Xindi out of system. Over 12,700 Xindi troops were killed in the costly attack and 38 ships were lost, almost a third of Dhren's atmospheric capable vessels.\n\n11 Coalition ships and 1,106 officers were also lost, including the Tellarite Comant-class battleship ICS Hinjaka and Nemnam-class cruiser ICS Tac’to, the Vissan Vinj-class cruiser ICS Uyvan, the Andorian Taholsin-class destroyers ICS Ghorahi and Bhime, the Taiidan Sajuuk Cor-class ion cannon frigate ICS Arnona, the Cylon Attackstar-class cruiser ICS Beta-4640 and Firestar-class frigate ICS Omega-1316, the United Earth Christopher-class corvette ICS California, the Vulcan Surook-class cruiser ICS Sa’am and the Krios Alvoc-class corvette ICS Sanamayn.\n\nSecond Battle of Barnard's Star\n\nRead More: Second Battle of Barnard's Star\n\nBarely two weeks later on 7 May 2154, the Xindi again attacked Hellion Prime via an attempt to destroy the Twenty-Second Coalition Battle Group near the outer range of the system in the Second Battle of Barnard's Star. Dhren had hoped that without significant troops to defend Hellion Prime if it were to fall, he could secure the colony through occupation and then use the colonists as hostages to deter a counter-strike. Quick reactions of four nearby Tellarite ships managed to drive the Xindi off when Dhren lost five ships when he anticipated a loss of zero.\n\nThird Battle of Barnard's Star\n\nRead More: Third Battle of Barnard's Star\n\nHoping to distract the Coalition and make them believe he was shifting focus, Admiral Dhren ordered a frigate squadron under the XSS Yeriun to the inner Coalition worlds to appear as if on a spy mission for a possible invasion. On 15 May 2154, the ICS dreadnaught Everest caught the Yeriun in the Alpha Centauri-system. Both vessels exchange fire before Yeriun retreated with heavy damage however Coalition suspicions had been raised enough for Dhren's liking. Unfortunately newly promoted Supreme Admiral of the Navy Maxwell Forrest and Fleet Admiral Shran saw through the ruse and began to make preparations to turn the tables on Dhren's failures.\n\nWith morale among his troops waning, Dhren decided to personally led the Third Battle of Barnard's Star on 3 June 2154, intend to cement confidence in his leadership. Xindi forces made a sudden warp jump into Hellion Prime orbit, attempting to take the colony by surprise by completely bypassing its reinforced orbital defense grid and the Coalition Second Fleet under command of Rear Admiral Archer.\n\nThe attack ploy was a disaster, three of Dhren's seven remaining cruisers impacted with the orbital Frair Station within seconds of jumping into normal space, while six more individual crafts including another cruiser disintegrated when they dropped out in the atmosphere. Still pushing for the invasion to continue, Dhren ordered troop ships to land on the surface near the Hellion Prime capital of New Mecca, leading to massive civilian casualties. Most of the forces were eliminated when the New Meccan and Coalition forces destroyed a dam, drowning the bulk of the ground forces who were staging in the city's lower wards, at the cost of leaving New Mecca partially under several meters of water.\n\nOver 23,250 Coalition personnel and civilians were killed, along with five ships, the Taiidan Skaal Tel-class destroyer ICS Malha, the Andorian Taholsin-class destroyer ICS Khandbari, the Colonial Dinah-class destroyer ICS Fons and the Hera-class corvette ICS Apollo, along with the United Earth Daedalus-class destroyer ICS Ben Franklin.\n\nDhren ordered a final retreat with over 21 ships and 62-thousand Xindi lost, however he was summarily relieved of command by his second in command, Captain Dovon, and executed for this tactical ineptitude.\n\nLiberation of Denobula\n\nRead More: Liberation of Denobula\n\nRetreating back to their stronghold on Denobula, newly promoted Admiral Dovon knew a Coalition counter-attack would soon follow. With barely five-thousand troops and nineteen ships left, he understood the only reason he currently held Denobula was his technological superiority over the conquered Denobulans. Dovon intended to supply his ships as best he could before beginning a full retreat back towards Xindi-controlled space.\n\nDovon was taken by surprise when only five days later on 8 June 2154, the Coalition Third Fleet under the leadership of Fleet Admiral Shran, attacked Denobula. Dovon attempted to retreat within the first hour of the battle, leaving almost all of his ground-side troops to fend for themselves. The newly minted Admiral did not provide proper orders to his fleet and nearly a third of his ships moved deeper into Denobula's gravity well to begin removing troops from the planet, only to be unable to break orbit fast enough to beat the Coalition advances. Using a combination of fighters to herd Dovon's ships and bombers to disable them before cruisers moved in for the final kills, Dovon's entire fleet of 19 ships was destroyed barely 4-hours into the battle. Xindi forces attempted to entrench themselves in the Denobulan capital of Loxt and managed a 22-hour running street battle with the Coalition before finally they were defeated.\n\nThe Coalition celebrated the Liberation of Denobula, however it was a sour victory as during the occupation over 80-million Denobulans have been killed and much of their cities razed. A freak winter on the normally tropical planet was credited with slowing the Xindi massacre of the population, which could have been significantly higher.\n\nRiding high on the liberation Coalition operatives on the ICS Trrrrei triggered a solar plasma eruption in the star of Xi Bootis on 14 June 2154, hitting the nearby patrol of Xindi warships and causing crippling damage. The survivors retreated when the Coalition Sixth Fleet entered the system and liberate the Samsara without a single shot fired or life lost.\n\nCoalition Offensive\n\n\"I stood on what was once the highest peak of the Dalar continent, now the largest island in the Dalar Sea after the Xindi massacre of Betazed. At my side stood Queen Romina of Nalia. She said 'the Xindi murdered billions of my people because they feared our power... how will they fare against our rage!'\"\n\n-Fleet Admiral Thy'lek Shran, Massacre of Betazed, 2155\n\nBy July 2154 the Coalition had finally managed to push Xindi forces out of all major sectors and even most of the minor outlying regions. The threat however of a renewed Xindi offensive was enough for Rear Admiral Archer to push for a direct offensive against the Xindi home territories. While many member worlds attempted to push for a continued fleet build up and securing Coalition territories, Archer pushed onward that while the nation was recovering. The Admiral pressed that the Xindi had never faced any intrusion into their territory, their infrastructure was intact and continuing to ramp up, whereas the Coalition was still in recovery and faced with an enemy in a territory that they knew little about.\n\nThe Coalition Council finally voted for offensive, understanding that while there were in a period reconstruction, the Xindi knew where to hit them, while they were in the dark. But they were aware of one Xindi location. The Northland Relay had remained under control of the Coalition Fleet, with its element zero core still disrupted and preventing Xindi ships from transitioning through. Archer's first operation of the new offensive to secure the relay's terminus end, the christened Southland Relay.\n\nCritical crash retrofits followed, using technology recovered from Xindi wrecks and captured vessels, Archer had over 30 crafts upgraded with mass effect engines to transition the Northland Relay. In concurrence any Coalition vessel retrofitted with a Colonial/Cylon FTL drive or a Hiigaran hyper-drive was to assemble and wait for confirmation of the fleets galactic location from the Southland Relay, then jump to reinforce Archer's forces.\n\nBattle of the Southland Relay, First Battle of Draylon & Capture of Brellick Habitat\n\nBattle of the Southland Relay\n\nRead More: Battle of the Southland Relay\n\nOn 27 July 2154, the newly christened Coalition First Fleet jumped through the Southland Relay into the Draylon system. While the Xindi had fortified the relay, they had never assumed the Coalition would have been able to reverse engineer their mass effect engines. Only a few frigates and a light mine field were stationed near the artifact but still dealt heavy damage to the first wave of Coalition forces, destroying six ships and dealing heavy damage to Archer's flagship the ICS Enterprise. This was however long enough for a galactic position to be calculated and a return signal to be sent through the relay.\n\nFTL and hyperspace capable Coalition forces jumped in with the second Coalition wave from the relay and began to overwhelm the Xindi forces. By the end of the day 21 Xindi ships were destroyed and 2300 officers killed against 18 Coalition vessels destroyed and 870 dead.\n\nCapture of Brellick Habitat\n\nRead More: Capture of Brellick Habitat\n\nThe biggest victory was the conquest of the Xindi habitat of Brellick, surrendering after being threatened with an extended bombardment. This marked the first capture of Xindi territory and over 2.2-million Xindi taken prisoner.\n\nFirst Battle of Draylon\n\nRead More: First Battle of Draylon\n\nBy the next morning on 29 July 2154, while the Coalition First Fleet returned to shipyards in the home Coalition territories for repairs, the Coalition Eleventh Fleet under Admiral Sav’tak, sailed with all available ships into the Draylon-system, under orders to undertake whatever operation she thought best against an Xindi-Reptilian port. Sav’tak decided to surprise the Xindi-Reptilian vessels in dry-dock at Draylon II. The main Interstellar Coalition force comprised the Vulcan battleships Hor’va, Bortola, and the Andorian cruiser Grav’ir. Two squadrons of battleships, two squadrons of cruisers, and five destroyer squadrons were held back in support. The Coalition support group comprised two armored cruisers and three destroyer divisions. They captured two Xindi cruisers off-guard, resulting in their destruction and the occupation of Draylon II. Coalition deaths number 22. Xindi deaths number 645. Xindi ship loses number 2.\n\nBy the next day of 30 July 2154, Coalition forces succeeded in cutting off and destroying the Xindi-Insectiod light cruiser SMS Ziir, when it arrived in the blockaded Draylon-system critically low on fuel from a long-range patrol behind Coalition lines. The ship surrenders with all hands.\n\nAfter two days, on 2 August 2154, Coalition engineers managed to against disrupt the element zero core of the Draylon Mass Relay to the nearby Argolis-system. This effectively locked the Xindi out of Draylon and forced them to rely on warp travel to reach the system, which was too distant for an immediate response.\n\nFor the next month into September, the Coalition worked feverishly to fortify its position in Draylon, nearly 2-thousand engineers deployed mines, installing sensor arrays and scramblers, hidden bunkers and assembling a complete starbase with full shipyard capabilities. It was decided that due to being in unknown territory and the threat of a massive Xindi counter-attack, the Coalition Council that the Northland-Southland Relay would only remain active for two-hours every three-days. The newly established Starbase Draylon was in the interim the completely self-sufficient front-line offensive headquarters of the Coalition war-effort under command of Rear Admiral Archer.\n\nCommand however believed that the offensive had to continue and following a series of Xindi fighter raids on the just operational Starbase Draylon, began preparations to remove the fighter facility in nearby Tarsus. Admiral Sav’tak was to lead the operation however due to the sudden onset of an early Pon'far, Vice Admiral Archer took over the entire fleet. Rear Admiral Archer barely two-days into the operation's preparations, in anger over the apparent lack of cooperation between the still single species Coalition ships, Archer ordered an immediate reorder of the command structure of every Coalition vessel, placing Earthers in command of Vulcan ships, Andorians on Tellarite vessels, etc.\n\nBattle of Tarsus III\n\nRead More: Battle of Tarsus III\n\nOn 7 September 2154, Vice Admiral Archer led the Coalition Fleet action against the Xindi at Tarsus III. Four Xindi ships were destroyed, the orbital Xindi outpost was destroyed, forcing the Xindi fleet to retreat and allowing the Coalition to capture the Tarsus-system. No Coalition ships were lost in the battle, 78 officers were killed while four of the defending six ships were destroyed, along with the orbital fighter base and over 1,200 Xindi.\n\nDefeat at Forren\n\nRead More: Defeat at Forren\n\nClashes between Xindi and Coalition forces were sporadic, while Coalition forces continued to increase their presence. Shifting desires for a renewed offensive however began to breed in the Coalition front-line officers, who believed that the lack of a continued push of the front-lines or the war would stall yet again.\n\nOn 27 October 2154, Admiral Cain submitted three plans for an invasion of the Xindi habitat of Forren. Coalition Fleet Chief Forrest denied and ordered Cain not to engage in operations in Forren and to wait for Admiral Greco and the battleship ICS Sinjuku to take command of his fleet and proceed to Tarsus for retrofit.\n\nCain however went against Forrest's orders and falsified communications on orders to strike against the Forren habitats. He believed Forren to be a success, since only the local garrison would be of concern and Cain expected an orbital bombardment to remove that concern.\n\nHowever when Cain's forces jumped in system he discovered General Molxom and a full cruiser battalion. Cain engaged Molxom's forces, both fleets being taken by surprise by the presence of each other. Being armed with only obsolete or outdated ships, the battleship ICS Pegasus and Mauth, along with a full frigate squadron were destroyed, 1,600 killed with Cain among them. Belfast and Oberon both escaped with serious damage. Molxom suffered no ships lost, minor causalities while the entire Coalition force decimated.\n\nSecond Battle of Draylon\n\nRead More: Second Battle of Draylon\n\nOn 8 December 2154, following the defeat at the Defeat at Forren, Coalition forces were re-deployed on screening patrols around Draylon II, for fear that the victorious Xindi cruiser squadron would attempt to launch a counter-attack on Draylon II to secure a further victory over the reeling Coalition front-lines. Two Xindi cruisers, three light cruisers, and three auxiliaries cruisers jumped into the Draylon-system intending raid the Coalition supply base at Starbase Draylon. The larger Coalition screening squadrons however detected the advance cruisers early on, and all except XSS Drosod and the auxiliary XSS Seydlitz were hunted down and destroyed. Over 2,200 Xindi and six cruisers were lost against only 10 Coalition deaths, caused when the carrier ICS Mandela suffered the only direct hit of the entire confrontation.\n\nCapture of Sorva and Eri​tta\n\nRead More: Capture of Sorva and Eritta\n\nRacing to secure on their victory as support among the Coalition worlds again began to wane following news reports on the Defeat at Forren. The Second Coalition Fleet blockaded the civilian Xindi habitats of Sorva and Eritta in the Argolis Cluster on 11 January 2155. Four Xindi warships were caught in dry-dock and captured at the cost of two destroyers and 180 lives but Xindi cutter squadrons lost six vessels and over 930.\n\nLiberation of Malcor III\n\nRead More: Liberation of Malcor III\n\nThe most influential find following the capture of the second and third Xindi habitats was the discovery of mineral transport records from Malcor III, more importantly the pre-warp world enslaved by the Xindi. The revelation that the Xindi had conquered a defenseless pre-warp world spurred a radical uplift in public opinion back home and even without public relation efforts on the part of Coalition High Command, ethical outrage among Humans, Hiigarans, Cylons, Denobulans and even logical Vulcans created a renewed drive to push the Xindi offensive.\n\nThe Coalition Council voted 22 to 4 to mandate the liberation of Malcor III, only the Colonial, Taiidan, Tellarite and Krios dissented on the grounds of delaying military action on Malcor until military buildup programs brought the number of front-line units up. Though not bound by Council decrees on battle doctrine or fleet deployments, the Coalition Fleet still began immediate efforts for the immediate liberation of the Malcorians.\n\nFollowing a series of fighter raids from February 14 to 1 March 2155 on the Xindi-Aquatic colony of Sulluma to make the enemy believe the Coalition was planning a bold strike on the largest Xindi frontier colony world. When the Xindi redeployed four cruiser squadrons and two battleships to Sulluma, removing one of Malcor's three cruiser squadrons, the Coalition Fleet launched the Liberation of Malcor on 2 March 2155. Following a seven hour battle and the loss of four ships and 4,300 lives, the Xindi were driven out with a staggering 19 ships lost and 9,200 dead.\n\nAfter nearly two-years under Xindi rule, the Interstellar Coalition tragically believed Malcorians would welcome the liberation, however the trauma of Xindi occupation and brutality left the world locked in civil war and infighting among fractions. Nearly 490-million people had perished during the occupation and the Xindi took perverse pleasure in terrorizing the population and destroying invaluable cultural artifacts. At the height of the occupation, nearly one-million Malcorians were executed daily, which according to the captured Xindi was to “stabilize the population so that there was only five Malcorians for every one Xindi.” It was eventually deduced that the Xindi had intended to destroy the Malcorians culturally and reduce them to mere slave labor, with nothing to rally towads.\n\nA provisional government established soon after was killed when radical Malcorians detonate a bomb during the opening proceedings. Coalition forces were reluctant to establish a military occupation force on a people they had just liberated or to install a Coalition backed puppet government, however when it was found Malcorian fractions were planning to re-purpose Xindi weapons in a campaign of extermination against neighboring worlds in the name of protection, already using Xindi chemical weapons on villages refusing to accept them as the rulers of Malcor III, the Coalition was forced to annex the unwilling world on March 20. Cultural psychologists from all over the Coalition were dispatched to begin rehabilitating the population and a new government with the Coalition providing security and support was established.\n\nLiberation of Betazed\n\nRead More: Liberation of Betazed\n\nDuring the liberation of Malcor III, several non-Malcorians were found among the slave population. These had been Betazoids imported to Malcor for the expressed purpose to helping to develop Malcorian's lacking agricultural industry, which had been pushed towards aqua-culture which most Xindi found unappealing. While the Malcorians were more primitive and fractious, the Betazoids not only were more approachable, leaders of their resistance promised to allow their homeworlds annexation and support in the war in exchange for the liberation. They also relieve their telepathic abilities would give the Coalition a considerable edge in the fighting.\n\nAttempting to avoid direct public acknowledgement of the Betazoid's telepathic abilities for fear of inspiring the Xindi to fortify their position on Betazed, the Coalition Fleet had to enact a plan of deception among even their own forces. Elements of the First, Second, Seventh and Tenth Fleets were recalled on refit and repair notices, only to be combined in the new Emergency Zero Fleet.\n\nUnder joint command of Captain Tucker and Captain T'Pol, the Emergency Zero Fleet launched into the Beta Veldonna-system on 22 March 2155 and engaged in a bloody fight with the Xindi occupation force. 3,500 officers were killed and eight Coalition ships were lost, including Captain Tucker's flagship the ICS Tal'Kir, though the Tucker managed to evacuate with most of his crew before the Tal'Kir suffered a warp core breach. Ground battles were more intense but after 11 days of fighting the Xindi lost more than 19-thousand and 23 ships.\n\nBetazed was officially liberated on 1 April 2155 upon the surrender of Xindi General Chronan and the thankful Betazoids joined the Coalition, using their telepathic powers to send secure communications for short-distances. They become a critical asset not only for combat communications and espionage, but also in the fields of psychology and diplomacy.\n\nWith the securing of Betazed, the Coalition now controlled the Nortland, Southland, Forren, Beta Veldonna, Draylon, Argolis, Malcor, Melona, Tarquin and Tammeron Relays, effectively taking complete control of the entire northern branch of the Xindi Mass Relay system. This left only the critical junction at Melona-system as the last leg before reaching the Hugora Nebula and its critical three way Mass Relay crossroads.\n\nCapture of Melona\n\nRead More: Capture of Melona\n\nCritical to pulling off a plan to take Sulluma and the Melona-system, was to remove the planet-side sensor arrays that could detect and calculate probably ship vectors up to three-light years around the system. Any attack would be found out and the Third Xindi Forward Offensive Squadron, one of the New Xindus Cooperative’s most powerful fleets, would be able to respond and cause devastating damage to any invading force.\n\nThis was the first official mission undertaken by the Betazoids following their liberation and induction into the Coalition. Several dozen Betazoid loyalists, Betazoids who had sided with the Xindi Occupation of Betazed, knowingly committed war crimes and been sentence to death, were covertly removed from prisons and bride, threatened or extorted to cooperate. Most had promises that their families would be given new identities and moved to safety so as to avoid the threats against collaboration that was rising dangerously in Betazoid society. In exchange for their cooperation, they would be given a captured Xindi freighter, the XSS Revorn and sent towards Mellona-system, appearing to carrying a slave transport with nearly one-thousand souls intending to appear as to have escaped Betazed and wanting to provide critical information for the recapture of Betazed to the Xindi. Since Sulluma had suffered desperate slave shortages due in part to a planetary viral plague that had decimated the Illyrian slave population, the Xindi were expected to jump at the chance for new slaves and for information on Betazed. Unknown to the collaborator Betazoids, Coalition Intelligence and the Betazoid government had made a deal in order to secure the release of the prisoners. To their knowledge there were merely carrying sensor disruption equipment to take out the Sulluma senor relays, nothing else.\n\nUpon arriving at Sulluma on 14 April 2155, the transport's Betazoid contingent managed to use their telepathy to confuse and forge their way past the Third Xindi Forward Offensive Squadron and into orbit. Upon preparing to land, the crew activated the sensor disruption device, only for the last second to realize it was actually a high-yield tactical EMP. The Betazoid government had only agreed to Coalition use of the collaborators on the grounds that their death-sentences would not be nullified.\n\nAs the Ravorn, disabled by its own EMP, crashed into Sulluma's outback, the entire colony and the critical sensor arrays were knocked out. Blind on all approaches, the Fifth, Seventh, Twenty-Fourth and Thirty-Fifth Coalition Cruiser Squadrons jump in system and attack. The battle saw the Third Xindi Forward Offensive Squadron destroyed, after XSS Drosod was cornered and destroyed by the ICS Galactica, ICS Belfast, and ICS Sobak. The Xindi-Aquatic colony on Sulluma surrendered upon regaining power 2-hours later and finding all its orbiting defenses and patrols destroyed. It would remain under Coalition control for the remainder of the war. 8 Xindi ships were lost along with 1,800 hands in all, while only one Coalition captured freighter and its Betazoid crew of 15 were intentionally sent to their deaths.\n\nLiberation of Tandar Prime\n\nRead More: Liberation of Tandar Prime\n\n23 April 2155, saw the first orbital bombardment by a Coalition fleet. The Sixth Coalition Fleet had intended to catch the Xindi Tenth Fleet in resupply operations and capture the Tandar Prime military research compound on the surface. However when the base began to launch long-range tactical missiles with warp-range capabilities, calculated to be targeted at Elora, Risa, Mazar and Capella the Sixth Fleet was forced to drop tactical photonic bombs on the Xindi base.\n\nIn order to accomplish this however the Xindi Tenth Fleet was able to escape almost fully resupplied. In total the bombardment of Tandar Prime killed all 16,900 Xindi stationed there, along with four ships landed for planet-side repairs, while one Coalition corvette, the ICS Pria, was lost taking a hit from a long-rang tactical missile after its weapons were taken out from damage.\n\nWith the removal of their main forward base, the few hundred remaining Xindi on the planet who killed in the ensuing Tandaran slave riots as Coalition forces moved ground-side. By 30 April 2155, Tandar Prime was liberated and the newly restored and democratic Union of Tandar joined the Interstellar Coalition.\n\nInkaaran Rebuff\n\nFollowing the securing of Sulluma to the Coalition and the fourth Xindi settlement under military occupation, the government began to probe the local space for allies against the New Xindus Cooperative. In general most minor system governments refused to be acknowledge against an enemy of the New Xindus Cooperative, for fear of brutal reprisals that could follow.\n\nCoalition diplomats attempted to secure first an alliance and that failure, a military transport rights through the Relays and space of the Unified Kingdom of Inkaara. It was hoped that following two wars with the Xindi, including the occupation of the original Xindi homeworld of Xindus, along with fact that the Kingdom had halted all Xindi advances through their space via the Hugora Nebula, the Inkaarans would be willing to side with the Coalition. The Unified Kingdom of Ikaara refused on 3 June 2155 to give aid to the Coalition based on isolationist elements heavy within the government since the Second Inkaaran-Xindi War. The result was that Coalition troops returning from the front-lines had to wait longer for medical attention, leading to more deaths in transit.\n\nLiberation of Roshanata XI\n\nRead More: Liberation of Roshanata XI\n\nWhile securing a Inkaaran alliance had failed, forces from the Coalition Eleventh Fleet finally managed to remove the last of the Xindi forces holding Roshanata XI, Mu Virginis-system, on 8 July 2155. Following a rapid surprise attack to remove the last elements of the Xindi Fourth Fleet left by Fleet Commander Drevid. While Coalition forces manage to reclaim the Andorian colony, barely 910 of the original 20-thousand colonists remain. Over 2,200 lives and two Coalition ships were lost in the recapture of Roshanata XI. While Devid had stationed over 42-thousand troops on the planet, by the time of the Eleventh Fleet arrived, only 8-thousand Xindi remained. All were killed along with the nine remaining Xindi ships. This marked the last world lost to the Xindi during the first Xindi advance on the Coalition home space to be retaken.\n\nFor the next two months the Xindi and Coalition fought a stalemate, as either side refused to launch offensive actions while securing their front-line territories. However the Coalition understood the Hugora Relay they held was merely a choke point against the three relays held by the Xindi in the Hugora Nebula. Any attempt to invade the nebula could result in three way reinforcements arriving from anywhere. Since knowledge of what lay beyond those Relays, Coalition High Command was reluctant to send forces into the Hugora Nebula.\n\nCasra Tragedy\n\nRead More: Casra Tragedy\n\nHowever on 4 September 2155, high yield ion particles were detected from the Melona Relay, a occurrence only observed when a Relay on one end was struck by an ion storm and the other end was dispersing the buildup of stray ions. Deducing that the Hugora Nebula must be suffering an ion storm and as such, any ship in the area without military grade shielding on a 8-rating or high could survive such damage, of which only Xindi habitats were rated it, then the system must currently be undefended. Coalition forces could offset the ion buildup and energy discharges on most of their cruiser and battleship-level classes thanks to bio-organic circuitry designed and implemented by joint Cylon-Suliban research, though only for up to seven hours.\n\nRear Admiral Archer quickly deployed the heavy elements of the Coalition First Fleet and launched through the Melona Relay. As predicted, only several automated defense batteries remained while the Casra habitat had been locked down with its higher armor rating. With no military units in system, the Coalition Fleet effortlessly destroyed the defense batteries and began to land boarding parties on Casra. While fighting was intense Coalition troops managed to secure much of the stations internal systems and government offices. However almost two-hours into the invasion, the Xindi-Reptilians detonated the anti-matter reactor of Casra to keep the habitat out of Coalition hands. In only a few seconds the entire station was destroyed and only by moving his forces outward to secure the other three relays in the nebula, did Archer and the First Fleet escape destruction. 950 Coalition soldiers, seven transports and four warships were lost, but nothing compared to the 12-million Xindi residents on the station who perished in the inferno.\n\nThe act, known as the Casra Tragedy on both sides, was painted by the Xindi-Reptilians as a Coalition war crime to the rest of the New Xindus Cooperative. However members of the upper Xindi-Primate government quickly realize it was a piece of propaganda when sensor logs from several freighters fleeing the Coalition invasion confirmed Casra's reactor core was not under Coalition control at the time of its destruction, Xindi-Reptilian plans made note of keeping the station out of Coalition hands at all cost and that the reactor was detonated through the intentional weapons discharges with a energy signature that only matched high military grade pulse energy rifles, those used exclusively by the Xindi-Reptilians. Grumblings of dissent began to appear in many of the inner circles among the Xindi-Primates and Xindi-Arboreals against the Xindi-Reptilians willingness to go to any lengths to keep the Coalition from victory.\n\nBetazoid Massacre\n\nRead More: Betazoid Massacre\n\nContinued tensions reached their breaking point between the Xindi parties following the Betazoid revelation. Originally Xindi-Reptilians and Aquatics had been reviewing the bodies of several hundred Betazoids exported for medical research on Azati Prime II, in order to determine an anti-body in their bio-chemistry that actually retarded the spread of Chrion disease, a major affliction among younger Xindi-Reptilians and Aquatics since leaving Xindus. However cranial reviews began to show structures in the Betazoid brain that could create psionic abilities, specifically telepathy. Taking note that since the liberation of Betazed and the Betazoids joining the Coalition that the number of secure short-range transmissions among Coalition forces had dropped to almost zero, elements within the Xindi began to suspect their former slaves were actually powerful telepaths and now a powerful asset to their enemies.\n\nDebate again split the Council, as the Xindi-Primates and Xindi-Arboreals supported a re-conquest of Betazed, while the Xindi-Reptilians and Xindi-Insectiods supported Betazed destruction, whereas the Xindi-Aquatics abstained from voting. Again the Xindi-Reptilians took the tied vote to launch unilateral action again, this time General Dolim claimed a rogue officer under his control had acted to launch six of the remaining 17 prototype probe weapons to destroy Betazed. In response the Council again censured him, though the Xindi-Reptilians refused to replace him as their councilor.\n\nOn 6 October 2155, Xindi probe weapons attacked Betazed and while the Coalition defense forces managed to shot down three, the remaining working in tandem struck their fire on Betazed's major fault lines in its eastern hemisphere. The results were the entire continent of Dalar and the Piri Islands shattering into hundreds of islands and every volcano on Betazed to erupt. Nearly a fourth of the planetary population was killed, primarily on the heavily populated continent of Dalar. 1.4-billion Betazoids dead was the final death toll once recovery efforts began.\n\nRaids of Xindi Territory\n\n\"Something dark now festers in the heart of a place we once considered our last sanctuary.\"\n\n-Councilor Barga Degra, A Rebellious Proposal, 2155\n\nMission of the ​First Long-Range Scout Flotilla\n\nFollowing the massacre on Betazed, Rear Admiral Archer began to push for more probing and intelligence gather towards Xindi space, which until currently the Coalition could confirm at least 20% of its supposed volume, based on reports from captured prisoners and ships. On 10 October 2155, Coalition Fleet Command approved Archer deep space mission into the core of Xindi territory, intent on completing a scouting mission of the Xindi core colonies and headquarters. Using Colonial FTL drives, Archer formed the First Long-Range Scout Flotilla and took the ICS Hn'shan, ICS Ylop, and Archer's former command, the ICS Enterprise. Following a voyage through Inkaaran space, approved by the Unified Kingdom of Inkaara in exchange for Cylon bio-synthetic technology, Archer's group successfully performed surveillance of the Galen and the Illyria-system on 18 October 2155 and the 24 October 2155.\n\nHowever when the First Long-Range Scout Flotilla surveyed the Xindi-Aquatic/Primate colony of Azati Prime II on 30 October 2155, operatives discovered the Xindi super weapon in dry-dock planet-side. Reading reports of its significant destructive power, Rear Admiral Archer decided to sabotage the weapons facility and from a shuttlecraft, coordinated squadrons of bombers who hit the installation. The attack only damages the weapon and most of Archer's squadrons were taken by surprise by underwater anti-aircraft fire. Archers shuttlecraft was also hit and Archer was apprehended from the crash site. In the process of his interrogation he gained Councilman Degra's trust when the Councilor noted Archer avoided hitting civilian targets at a great tactical disadvantage. Councilman Degra noted that if civilian lives were disregarded, much of Azati Prime II's planet-side settlements could have been decimated along with thousands dead.\n\nDuring Archer's interrogation, the ICS Enterprise, Hn'shan and Ylop were heavily damaged by attacking Xindi ships sent by General Dolim in retribution for their attack on the colony. 68 hands were lost however the attack was recalled by the Xindi-Primates, specifically Councilman Degra, using the idea that sending the damaged Coalition flagship ships back to their space would be a bigger hit to their moral. Archer was returned, whereas a bomb placed in his prison cell makes it appear he escaped.\n\nAdmiral Archer returned to the Enterprise as his flagship and the Ylop and Hn'shan repair the ships. After he was recovered, a hidden message by Councilman Degra was found in the pod inviting him to a meeting. An accident on the Hn'shan forced the ship to be abandoned and its crew transfer to the Ylop. Archer ordered them to return with much of the fleets injured and took a skeleton crew to meet Councilman Degra.\n\nRun of the Kovaalan Nebula\n\nRead More: Run of the Kovaalan Nebula\n\nFive days later, on the 6 November 2155, the ICS Enterprise made preparation to enter the Kovaalan Nebula, intending to use the Mass Relay in the nebula to reach Councilman Degra in time. Just prior to crossing into the gaseous region, the ICS Enterprise encountered a time displaced copy of itself, which originally traveled back in time to 2037 and has spent the intervening 117-years waiting to return to its divergence point. Most of the original crew's descendants now manned the craft, including Rear Admiral Archer's great-granddaughter Karyn Archer and Captains T'Pol and Tucker's son Lorian as its CO. Due to damage to the existing Enterprise, it was decided to use the older but much more heavily modified and functional secondary vessel. The Enterprise was used in a suicide attack to allow the remaining time-displaced Enterprise to bypass the Kovaalan Order protecting the Kovaala Nebula, using the Kovaalan Mass Relay to jump to the meeting coordinates.\n\nXindi-Primate//Arboreal Proposal\n\nAbroad the time-displaced Enterprise, Rear Admiral Archer meet with Councilman Degra on 8 November 2155, who details the Xindi-Arboreal and Primate plan to turn against the Insects and Xindi-Reptilians, citing major disagreements with their bypassing the Xindi Council, increasing military control of Xindi colonies, war crimes against the Coalition and the Xindi conquered worlds, Casra Tragedy and police actions that have taken numerous lives. Archer agrees on the condition that an alliance with the Primates and Xindi-Arboreals will not nullify the war-crimes charges against the Xindi leaders for the Xindi First Strike or the war. Councilman Degra agrees to complete transparency, in exchange for Coalition aid when the Xindi-Primates and Xindi-Arboreals split.\n\nXindus Campaigns\n\n\"You hide behind your minefields, your great fleets, your grand armies, refusing to take action in a war that you claim no part in causing. Ironic that innocence is so commonly claimed by those soaked in blood.\"\n\n-Chief Petty Officer Karyn Archer, Fury Before the Emperor, 2155\n\nCouncilman Degra's Proposal\n\nReturning straight away to Starbase Draylon on 25 November 2155, Admiral Archer, abroad his time-displaced capital ship, returned to friendly space and gained tentatively but suspicious approval from the Coalition Council. His story carried more weight when the crew of the time-displaced Enterprise detailed scans from across Xindi-space, detailing widespread atrocities being carried out by the Xindi, though also detailing Xindi-Primate and Xindi-Arboreals, along with limited Xindi-Aquatic, attempts to shelter and protect conquered alien populations. Of note, was Councilman Degra's secret deal that saved 10-thousand Illyrians from extermination by listing them as lost in an ion storm, then allowing the freighters carrying them to escape to Triannon.\n\nInkaara Enters the War\n\nA week later, 3 December 2155, Karyn Archer, now a non-commissioned chief petty officer in the Coalition Fleet, was able to convince the Unified Kingdom of Ikaara to join the war against the Xindi, citing a Ikaaran law that members of the royal family under dangerous circumstances must be protected. Though Karyn was a Coalition officer, her lineage as the great-granddaughter of Vice Princess Esilia Tv'eln was confirmed via historical record, which confirmed Esilia married an alien male named Archer who claimed to be from the future and had one confirmed son before disappearing from Inkaaran records. Genetic testing confirms Karyn to be the great-granddaughter of Vice Princess Esilia. As it was legally binding, the Kingdom had to declare defacto war on the Xindi to protect her.\n\nAs such, the Unified Kingdom of Inkaara signed a military alliance treaty with the Interstellar, which provisions maneuvered by Karyn Archer and Vice Prince Ennoc Tv'eln for a possible future entry of the Kingdom into the Coalition as a member state.\n\nRaid on Cleon\n\nRead More: Raid on Cleon\n\nBarely a day later, on 4 December 2155, using the Mass Relays connected to the Inkaaran-system, the Coalition Fifth Fleet rapidly raided Xindi trade convoys. The next day, on 5 December 2155, with the addition of Ikaaran forces, the Coalition Eighth Fleet raided the Xindi outpost on Cleon, capturing critical fleet deployment reports and several dozen high-value individuals, including the Xindi-Aquatic representative to the Xindi Council. 54 Coalition and Inkaaran officers were killed. But two Xindi ships and 360 officers were killed, including the destruction of the central command bunker on Cleon.\n\nDefeat at the Penthara Mass Relay\n\nRead More: Defeat at the Penthara Mass Relay\n\nHowever three days later, on 8 December 2155, the Coalition Sixteenth Fleet attempted to capture the Penthara Mass Relay but met with disaster when a surprise ambush by the Xindi-Reptilians caught the Coalition fleet off-guard. Two dozen ships were lost before Admiral Ozzal Garti orders a retreat. 21 Coalition ships and 1,290 lives we lost, to only half that number in Xindi ships, 10 lost and 450 dead.\n\nFirst Battle of Galen\n\nRead More: First Battle of Galen\n\nThe start of the new year saw Xindi forces hard pressed to gain ground against the Coalition, including on 14 January 2156 when the ICS Lor'Vela was lost on a deep-range scouting mission near the Galen-system, but not before a final suicide run destroyed three Xindi corvettes. Several escape pods and shuttles managed to hide in the atmosphere of a nearby gas giant and were soon rescued by the ICS Selis. 34 officers lost their lives, but 176 Xindi and three corvettes were destroyed.\n\nFirst Battle of Herva\n\nRead More: First Battle of Herva\n\nTwo days later, on 16 January 2156, the Xindi auxiliary cruiser XSS Meewe attacked the Earth merchant ship UES Avish near the Coalition Forward Base of Herva in the Delphic Expanse. The Avish was taken by surprise and destroyed. 128 civilians were killed when the Meewe opened fire on the escape pods, 349 managed to escape to Herva Base where orbital defenses kept the Meewe at bay, before it retreated with the arrival of the dreadnought ICS Aconcagua.\n\nConquest of Penthara IV\n\nRead More: Conquest of Penthara IV\n\nSeeking a turn around, the Coalition Eleventh Fleet launched another attack to take Penthara IV on 17 February 2156, winning a long and bloody victory over the Xindi fleets stationed at the colony. Death tolls and ships lost were almost twice that of the occupying enemy forces however the nearby civilian colonies in the Beloti-system however surrendered without a fight.\n\nThe Eleventh Fleet flagship ICS Columbia was lost during the battle, along with 1,960 officers and 26 ships. Xindi deaths only numbered 710 and nine ships, but four of them Xindi battleships, including General Dolim's former flagship the XSS Atcrea.\n\nSixel Exodus\n\nMarch did see stabilization begin to take hold on Malcor III. After nearly a year of fractious fighting, rebellious Malcorian fractions accepted a Coalition compromise on 13 March 2156, allowing them to be settle several worlds near Romulan space and given full sovereign control of their colonies, in exchange for accepting a low-tech existence closer to the Malcor industrial age. Most of the factions accept the titled Sixel Exodus program, several do not but without the unified support they quickly fall to government and Coalition forces.\n\nMalcor rebels were transported to Alpha Mensae III, Alpha Hydri IIb, Calder II, Rho Virginis V, Yadalla Prime and Porrima I, nearly 1.3-million by the time the movement was completed in 2-years. Unknown to them, Coalition monitoring bases were installed in all systems to make sure the Malcorian rebels maintain the end of their bargain.\n\nSecond Battle of Herva\n\nRead More: Second Battle of Herva\n\nMore than a week later, on 25 March 2156, The Xindi Eighth Cruiser Flotilla attempted to destroy the Coalition Forward Base of Herva, however the strategic placing of mines on all major transit routes into the system cost the cruisers dearly, resulting in the forces turning back without any Coalition loses. Seven ships and 2398 officers were lost to great embarrassment to the Xindi.\n\nFoundation of the Interstellar Coalition & Xindi Civil War\n\nSigning of the Articles of the Coalition\n\nAfter almost three-years of war, fighting and cooperation, the Articles of the Coalition were ratified on 20 June 2156, in Singapore on Earth, establishing the Coalition Council as the federal wing to all member states and the Coalition Fleet as the nation's primary military, science and space navy. Supreme Admiral of the Navy Forrest was named Chief of the Coalition Fleet, Fleet Admiral Shran as his second. Newly promoted Vice Admiral Jonathan Archer was named Chief of Coalition Offensive Operations. The Interstellar Coalition officially came into existence as a legitimate and full government. Long-term discussions on a capital were placed on hiatus until the Xindi Conflict was over, temporary facilities were used in Singapore, Earth.\n\nSecond Xindi Civil War\n\nRead More: Second Xindi Civil War\n\nConcurrent to this announcements we made to three concurrent operations now underway by the Coalition Fleet. Operation Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, Operation Dynamite and Operation Snatch & Grab, each part of what would eventually become the firing shots of the Second Xindi Civil War.\n\nOperation Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\n\nRead More: Operation Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\n\nOperation Guess Who's Coming to Dinner began in January 2156 when information leaked via wreckage from the ICS Lor'Vela when it was caught in the Galen-system, detailing the signing of the Articles of the Coalition in June 2156 and the intent to launch a major fleet from Earth to attack the Xindi, as a moral boast for the new government and publicity event.\n\nIntending to derail the conference and to destroy the fleet while it was in parade operations for the ceremony, 38 Xindi capital ships undertook a 6-month silent running voyage from Xindi-held space. As the fleet jumped inside the oort cloud of the Sol-system, 64 Coalition warships ambushed the force and opened fire. However as the Xindi vessels moved to intercept, ships belonging to the Xindi-Primates and Xindi-Arboreals began to open fire on their counterparts. The confusion it sparked allowed the Coalition force to lose only two frigates and the Xindi-Primates and Xindi-Arboreals to lose three corvettes, while seven Xindi-Reptilian, ten Xindi-Insectiod destroyed and the one Aquatic vessel to be captured.\n\nOperation Dynamite\n\nRead More: Operation Dynamite\n\nOperation Dynamite was centered in Xindi-space, where pre-placed bombings decimated Xindi-Reptilian and Xindi-Insectiod military bases, habitats and stations long enough for the rebel-Xindi to launch several critical strikes. Attempts to secure or destroy the Xindi Planet Killer failed but the New Xindus Shipyards, the largest Xindi shipyard, was completely de-orbited.\n\n90-thousand Xindi were killed on both sides, along with 48 capital ships destroyed, including five of the seven Xindi dreadnoughts along with the ability to build, repair or even maintain the remaining pair. During this Xindi-Primate Councilman Degra and Xindi-Arboreal Councilman Jannar detonate bombs inside Azati Prime Central Command, critically damaging the bunker and knocking the Xindi military headquarters off-line completely.\n\nOperation Snatch & Grab\n\nRead More: Operation Snatch & Grab\n\nWhile this was intend to do as much damage to the Xindi-Reptilians and Xindi-Insectiods as possible, its true intention was to distract the military long enough for Operation Snatch & Grab. Using FTL and hyperdrive installed on Macross and Kushan-class motherships, an un-precedent evacuation was undertaken, as the 27 largest Primate and Xindi-Arboreal civilian habitats and colonies were evacuated or towed the facilities to safety. Millions of Primates and Xindi-Arboreal civilians were moved into Vulcan and Hiigaran-space or into Coalition held Draylon II before Xindi-Reptilians and Xindi-Insectoids can respond, ensuring that threatening civilian massacres could not be widely used to force the Democratic Xindi Alliance to capitulate.\n\n77 Coalitions officers lost their lives and four escort ships were lost during retribution attacks by the Xindi-Reptilians and Xindi-Insectiods but 18 Xindi ships and 7,100 were lost in exchange.\n\nSecond Xindi Civil War Erupts\n\nThe first act of Councilman Degra and Xindi-Arboreal Councilman Loan Jannar was to declare the formation of the Democratic Xindi Alliance, a rebel faction against the illegal policies of the Xindi-Reptilian and in particular, General Dolim.\n\nCoupled with the catastrophic loss of lives, General Dolim ordered declared the secession of the Xindi-Arboreals and Xindi-Primates to be an illegal action, while secretely approving attacks on any Xindi-Arboreal or Primate individual or their property. Those unfortunate enough to heed warnings to move to the 27 major Xindi-Arboreal or Primate habitats were killed, while several ships that attempted to stay loyal were also destroyed regardless of their allegiances. 145-thousand lives and 23 ships lost on both sides of the Second Xindi Civil War.\n\nWithdrawal of the Xindi-Aquatics\n\nUnnerved by the rampant destruction and pillaging of Xindi-Primate and Xindi-Arboreal properties, and mass killings of those unfortunate Xindi-Primates and Xindi-Arboreals left on New Xindus, the Xindi-Aquatics on 23 June 2156 removed all their ships from offensive action.\n\nMany information and news stations, on all sides of the new Xindi Civil War, began to draw dark references from the First Xindi Civil War and the Xindi-Reptilian Clan Lacertilia's terrorist actions that destroyed Xindus.
