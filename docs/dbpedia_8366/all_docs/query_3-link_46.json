You may not realize it, but in your own way, you can help a lot of people. Not in a bullshit ‘I’m going to save the world’ kind of way, but give direction to those who could fall through the cracks and disappear forever. …Don’t fuck it up, yeah?”\n\n– Sheridan Dubhlocke\n\n_\n\nHere stands a witch. A tiny woman of indeterminate age, seeming at once young and old. Her frame is muscular, yet hunched. Her voice is deep and musical, mysterious and seductive. Her eyes are golden lights in seas of darkness. The scents of blood and incense cling to her wherever she goes. Light doesn’t touch her the same way as her surroundings; the shadows she casts blot like spilled ink on the pages of reality. Even in a closed room, you can never quite feel alone with her. She is, in simple terms, unnerving. Uncanny. Other.\n\nSohma Anantasari is something of an enigma. Few know her true motivations or goals. She has been called brave, yet cowardly. Cruel, yet kind. Only a few trusted allies have any real inkling of what’s going on behind the fortress walls of her mind. What she shows to the world is a keen intellect and a sharp tongue, both prone to poetry and melancholy.\n\nHer mannerisms vary between Sith intensity and aloof disinterest, often changing in an instant if something catches her eyes or ears. She deigns to answer questions about forbidden knowledge with the same care as if she had been asked the weather forecast. She treats those close to her with compassion, and her enemies coldly. Yet, she lacks the naked hostility and emotion of others who could be called Sith, calling into question her ability to stand among the ranks of true Dark Side practitioners.\n\nShe views herself not as weak, but different. In fact, Sohma has had radical views on the Force since she was first introduced to its wonders. They allowed her to rise quickly through the ranks of the Sith Order, where she apprenticed to the Sith Lord Valerius Valoran. She served her Master faithfully, even garnering the notice of Darth Revan himself, before the schism which led to the creation of the Revanite Order.\n\nAs an unaligned practitioner, however, she has flourished. In a few short months, she has unlocked a bevy of applications for her abilities she wouldn’t have previously considered, as well as new paths to power which she is eager to explore. Now, she stalks the sector like a ghost, imparting knowledge to any who seek it and gathering resources for her next endeavors. Those whose fates align with her own may yet be privy to the bounties of her dark academia.\n\nSOHMA’S CURRENT IN-GAME DESCRIPTION\n\nA woman clad in clothing reminiscent of ancient styles. She is short and perilously thin, poised like a knife, and followed by the faint yet constant scents of blood and incense. Around her shoulders rests a white hooded shawl, the shadows of which are unnaturally deep and obscure all but the outline of her face. Her voice would seem calming if not for the tenebrous and vaguely threatening undertones. And, if you approach close enough, you may notice the whispers of a second voice just on the edge of hearing, or the sense of something hidden lurking nearby. Those not closely attuned to the Dark Side of the Force may find her mere presence slightly uncomfortable.\n\nIn the small of her back rests a saberstaff of strange and disconcerting design, bearing twin Redmoon sigils. A collection of baubles hangs from her belt; trophies of combat, varying from innocuous to macabre. Most noticeable are a rancor tooth, the spiked head of an ornate gaderffi, the dog tags of both Republic and Imperial soldiers, and several mummified ears.\n\nOUTDATED - FOR PERSONAL REFERENCE ONLY\n\nBLADE ARTES:\n\nIntro to Shii-Cho - (1/1)\n\nShii-Cho - Practitioner (4/8)\n\nIntro to Makashi - (1/1)\n\nMakashi - Novice (3/8)\n\nIntro to Soresu - (1/1)\n\nSoresu - Beginner (1/8)\n\nIntro to Ataru - (1/1)\n\nAtaru Acrobatics - (1/1)\n\nAtaru - Skilled (6/8)\n\nFORCE ACADEMICS:\n\nTutaminis - Practitioner (4/8)\n\nForce Acrobatics - Skilled (6/8)\n\nTelekinesis - Practitioner (4/8)\n\nMeditation - Skilled (6/8)\n\nMatukai Hardening - Beginner (1/8)\n\nForce Choke - Competent (5/8)\n\nForce Lightning - Competent (5/8)\n\nGolden Path - Competent (5/8)\n\nDrain Life - Competent (5/8)\n\nDeadly Sight - Aspirant (2/8)\n\nMISC:\n\nSith Values (1/1)\n\nSith Code (2/2)"
