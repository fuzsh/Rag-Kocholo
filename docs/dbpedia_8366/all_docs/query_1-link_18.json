I was beaten regularly... A good child was a fearful child, and I was a very, very, good little girl, which meant I lived in a world of silent, dark terror most of the time.\" Her mother was a teacher, and brought Toussaint to live in Brooklyn in the late 1960s.\n\nToussaint graduated from Manhattan's High School of Performing Arts in 1978.
