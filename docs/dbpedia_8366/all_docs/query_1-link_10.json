        "text": "Toussaint was born in Trinidad and Tobago\n\nIn a 2014 interview with HuffPost, the actress talked about what it was like to grow up in the southernmost island country.\n\n\"I grew up under the British system, which I think is horrific for children — very, very strict — a system that did not recognize children as being individuals. You were small animals earning the right to be human. Childhood for me then felt extraordinarily powerless, and as an artistic child who learned in alternative ways, it was hell.\"\n\nIn the 1980s, Toussaint made her screen debut.\n\nThe transition from stage to screen can be difficult, but Toussaint's talents helped her get through it. In 1986, she portrayed a widow in the made-for-TV film A Case of Deadly Force. She then snagged a recurring role as Vera Williams in the Soap Opera One Life to Live. Toussaint made her way to other shows, including 227 and Law & Order.\n\nShe also made her film debut in the female lead role opposite Burt Reynolds in the crime comedy Breaking In (1989)."
