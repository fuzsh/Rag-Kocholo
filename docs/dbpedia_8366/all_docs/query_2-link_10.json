This is a busy year for Toussaint as she gears up for the December release of the Oprah Winfrey-produced film Selma, which is already getting Oscar buzz, and Toussaint also joined the cast of ABC's highly-anticipated drama series Forever.\n\nAfter graduating from the prestigious Julliard School drama division, Toussaint spent the first 12 years of her career acting on stage in New York City before moving to Los Angeles. She quickly landed a plum role co-starring opposite Annie Potts (Designing Women) in the series Any Day Now, which earned her an NAACP Image Award nomination for best actress in a drama series, a TV Guide Award nomination for Best Actress in a Drama Series, and she received the Wiley A. Branton Award from the National Bar Association. Toussaint's television credits include pivotal roles on popular television shows including Friday Night Lights, Saving Grace, Law & Order and Ugly Betty. She has also had several guest appearances on the hit television shows \"CSI,\" Grey's Anatomy and opposite Kerry Washington on ABC's hit drama thriller Scandal.\n\nNo stranger to the silver screen, Toussaint's first film role was opposite Burt Reynolds in the crime comedy Breaking In.
