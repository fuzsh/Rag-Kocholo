        "text": "Highest Rated: 100% Nightjohn (1996)\n\nLowest Rated: 31% Hudson Hawk (1991)\n\nBirthday: Apr 4, 1960\n\nBirthplace: Trinidad and Tobago\n\nA commanding character actress with a powerful screen presence, Lorraine Toussaint graduated from Juilliard and built a theatrical career as a Shakespearean actress before she tackled screen acting, landing supporting roles in such films as \"Hudson Hawk\" (1991), \"Point of No Return\" (1993) and \"Dangerous Minds\" (1995) and a series regular role opposite Annie Potts on the then-and-now best friends drama \"Any Day Now\" (Lifetime, 1998-2002), for which she earned five Outstanding Lead Actress Image Award nominations. She recurred on \"Law & Order\" (NBC, 1990-2010), \"Ugly Betty\" (ABC, 2006-2010) and \"Friday Night Lights\" (NBC, 2006-08; The 101 Network, 2008-2011), earned a series regular role opposite Holly Hunter on \"Saving Grace\" (TNT, 2007-2010) and notched a supporting turn in the Jamie Fox/Robert Downey, Jr. drama \"The Soloist\" (2009). An immensely gifted actress who had long flown under the radar, Toussaint earned a massive critical boost with her powerful supporting turn in the indie \"Middle of Nowhere\" (2012), as a hardworking mother who struggles to support her daughter's (Emayatzy Corinealdi) decision to put her life on hold to support her incarcerated husband (Omari Hardwick). One of the best and most striking character actresses in the business, Lorraine Toussaint left many critics and fans hoping her considerable talents would be even more widely recognized.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n100% Nightjohn\n\n99% Selma\n\n88% Middle of Nowhere\n\n88% If These Walls Could Talk\n\n82% Fast Color 80% Concrete Cowboy\n\n80% Breaking In\n\n78% Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark\n\nPhotos\n\nLorraine Toussaint Orange is the New Black, Lorraine Toussaint, 'Hugs Can Be Deceiving', Season 2, Ep. #3, 06/06/2014, ©NETFLIX Orange Is the New Black, Lorraine Toussaint, 'Hugs Can Be Deceiving', Season 2, Ep. #3, 06/06/2014, ©NETFLIX Rosewood, Lorraine Toussaint (L), Morris Chestnut (R), 'Wooberite &amp; The Women of Rosewood', Season 1, Ep. #21, 05/18/2016, ©FOX Rosewood, Gabrielle Dennis (L), Lorraine Toussaint (R), 09/23/2015, ©FOX Rosewood, Vondie Curtis Hall (L), Lorraine Toussaint (C), Morris Chestnut (R), 'Quadriplegia And Quality Time', Season 1, Ep. #7, 11/11/2015, ©FOX Rosewood, Morris Chestnut (L), Lorraine Toussaint (R), 09/23/2015, ©FOX Rosewood, Morris Chestnut (L), Lorraine Toussaint (R), 09/23/2015, ©FOX Orange is the New Black, Lorraine Toussaint, '40 OZ of Furlough', Season 2, Ep. #9, 06/06/2014, ©NETFLIX Orange Is the New Black, Lorraine Toussaint, '40 OZ of Furlough', Season 2, Ep. #9, 06/06/2014, ©NETFLIX Orange is the New Black, Lorraine Toussaint (L), Kate Mulgrew (R), 'Hugs Can Be Deceiving', Season 2, Ep. #3, 06/06/2014, ©NETFLIX Orange is the New Black, Lorraine Toussaint, 'Looks Blue, Tastes Red', Season 2, Ep. #2, 06/06/2014, ©NETFLIX Orange Is the New Black, Lorraine Toussaint (L), Kate Mulgrew (R), 'Hugs Can Be Deceiving', Season 2, Ep. #3, 06/06/2014, ©NETFLIX Orange Is the New Black, Lorraine Toussaint, 'Looks Blue, Tastes Red', Season 2, Ep. #2, 06/06/2014, ©NETFLIX SOPHIE AND THE RISING SUN, LORRAINE TOUSSAINT, 2016. ©MONTEREY MEDIA Rosewood, Lorraine Toussaint, 'Silkworms y Silencio', Season 1, Ep. #17, 04/20/2016, ©FOX Rosewood, Lorraine Toussaint (L), Morris Chestnut (R), 'Sudden Death &amp; Shades Deep', Season 1, Ep. #19, 05/04/2016, ©FOX Rosewood, Lorraine Toussaint, 'Sudden Death &amp; Shades Deep', Season 1, Ep. #19, 05/04/2016, ©FOX Rosewood, from left: Anna Konkle, Lorraine Toussaint, Morris Chestnut, Joy Bryant, 'Silkworms y Silencio', Season 1, Ep. #17, 04/20/2016, ©FOX Rosewood, Lorraine Toussaint, 'Fashionistas and Fasciitiss', Season 1, Ep. #9, 11/25/2015, ©FOX\n\nFilmography\n\nMovies\n\nCredit 92% 91% Nimona Queen Valerin (Voice) - 2023 80% 70% Concrete Cowboy Nessie (Character) - 2020 68% 84% The Glorias Flo Kennedy (Character) - 2020 78% 72% Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark Lou Lou (Character) $68.7M 2019 73% 93% Sprinter Donna Sharp (Character) - 2018 82% 58% Fast Color Bo (Character) $74.7K 2018 44% 63% Love Beats Rhymes Nichelle (Character) - 2017 69% 62% Sophie and the Rising Sun Salome Whitmore (Character) $30.3K 2016 68% 61% The Night Before Mrs. Roberts (Character) $43.0M 2015 No Score Yet No Score Yet Runaway Island Naomi Holloway (Character) - 2015 99% 86% Selma Amelia Boynton (Character) $52.1M 2014 88% 65% Middle of Nowhere Ruth (Character) $166.9K 2012 No Score Yet 64% Accidental Friendship Executive Producer - 2008 No Score Yet 81% Their Eyes Were Watching God Pearl Stone (Character) - 2005 No Score Yet No Score Yet The Sky Is Falling Janie (Character) - 1999 No Score Yet No Score Yet Blackout Effect Kim Garfield (Character) - 1998 No Score Yet 60% The Cherokee Kid Mama Turner (Character) - 1996 No Score Yet 88% America's Dream Philomena (Character) - 1996 100% 85% Nightjohn Dealey (Character) - 1996 88% 74% If These Walls Could Talk Shameeka Webb (Character) - 1996 No Score Yet 31% Jaded Carol Broker (Character) - 1996 No Score Yet No Score Yet The Good Doctor: The Paul Fleiss Story Unknown (Character) - 1996 34% 64% Dangerous Minds Irene Roberts (Character) $84.9M 1995 No Score Yet No Score Yet It Was Him or Us Lt.
