        "text": "3\n\nServants’ Private Lives\n\nNo matter what profession they are in, the French have a passion for making their fortunes.… Even les petits gens, those who elsewhere content themselves with having enough to survive on, here [in France] are possessed with a mania for bettering themselves; and someone has rightly remarked that it is France that furnishes Europe with valets de chambre and cooks, employments that made the fortunes of the people.\n\n—De Muralt, Lettres sur les anglois et les françois et sur les voiages\n\nDomestic service! It’s a losing game.\n\n—Martine, a servante, in Molière, The Learned Ladies\n\nIn her study of the portrayal of domestic servants in the French comedies of the eighteenth century, Maria Demers points out the increasing tendency, as the century wore on, to picture servants, especially men servants, as ambitious and eager to get ahead. “Around 1650,” she notes, “a valet is nothing, has nothing, and wants nothing,” but by the eve of the Revolution he is Figaro, whose pride, self-confidence, and ambitions are virtually unlimited.1 In portraying the growing ambitions of servants in the course of the eighteenth century, writers were only mirroring what was happening in real life. For, ironically enough, it was this least modern and “capitalistic” employment that attracted some of the most ambitious members of the lower classes. And it fostered in them some of the most modern attitudes: a passion for social mobility, a devotion to making money, and a willingness to take risks to make their fortunes. All of these were different from the attitudes of the typical peasant or artisan of the Old Regime.\n\nThey were different from the attitudes of earlier generations of servants as well. To be sure, domestic service had always been a pathway of social mobility for a certain type of servant: the well-born but penniless young man who entered the household of a great lord in expectation of protection and advancement. One thinks of the career of Guilio Mazarin, or on a lesser level, that of M. de Gourville, born in 1625 into the petty bourgeoisie of Angoulême. At seventeen he became a valet de chambre in the Rochefoucault household and eventually rose to become its chief homme de confiance, meanwhile garnering enough in gifts and commissions to end his days as a modest country squire, with land, a carriage, and servants of his own, and a fortune sufficient to provide for his ninety-six nieces and nephews and endow a maison de charité besides.2 But in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries such success was confined to gentlemanly upper servants; the vast majority of domestics seem to have been content to have their food and lodging provided and did not dream of having anything more.3\n\nBy the eighteenth century, however, the monetization of servants’ work appears to have given domestics a new vision of themselves. Their labor was no longer a duty they owed to their masters; instead it was a commodity to be exchanged for cash, a resource of their own to be sold to the highest bidder. As C. B. MacPherson argued in his classic exposition of the value system of a market economy, this new view of labor fostered an individualistic outlook, a sense of pride and ambition, a determination to make the best possible bargain with life.4 And on a more mundane level, the rise in servants’ pay in the course of the century enabled them to accumulate the wherewithal to make their dreams come true.\n\nAt any rate, in the last decades of the Old Regime servants seem to have become more ambitious and independent of their masters. They changed jobs more frequently than formerly. They saved more money, and they were more “capitalistic” in its management. They were less apt to look on their service as a temporary occupation that would enable them eventually to return home to their native villages, and more apt to become permanent settlers in the towns to which they had migrated. And they made much more ambitious marriages. All of this suggests a determination to rise as high as they possibly could.\n\nThe ultimate ambitions of servants varied, of course, in relation to their sex, background, personalities, and experiences in life. For many female domestics a respectable marriage was a major goal. Male servants, by contrast, were usually more interested in moneymaking than marriage, and they often dreamed rather impractically of leaving service for new careers in commerce. Many higher servants—secretaries, tutors, and cooks, for example—even hoped for social recognition as respectable members of the bourgeoisie.\n\nUnfortunately most of these dreams were doomed to failure. Domestic service probably provided the best road to social mobility open to the lower classes during the Old Regime, but it was a road strewn with pitfalls for the unwary. An illegitimate pregnancy, an unfortunate marriage, a long period of illness or unemployment which ate up years of savings, even a stingy employer who withheld wages or an unfair one who refused to give a reference—all these could spell ruin for a servant’s hopes and dreams. The monetization of domestic service may have encouraged in servants the ambitious attitudes inherent in a market economy, but it also left them victims of its vagaries. Using domestic service as a pathway to social mobility was at best a gamble, and for all too many the gamble was what Molière’s Martine called it: “A losing game.” This chapter will explore the private lives of domestic servants—their social origins, their career patterns, their moneymaking, their sex lives and marriages, their survival in old age—to see how they fared in their quest for a better future.\n\nThe Decision to Enter Service\n\nPicturing domestic service as a road to social mobility implies that people specifically chose to enter the occupation with that in mind. In fact this was not necessarily so. Most servants seem to have entered service at such a young age that it is likely they did not choose the occupation for themselves, but instead had the choice made for them by their parents or other relatives. Most servants came from such poor backgrounds that it seems likely that the immediate attraction of relieving the family of the burden of feeding and sheltering one of its members weighed more heavily in the decision to place a child in service than did prospects of future advancement.\n\nThe best source for the family backgrounds of domestic servants is their marriage contracts, which usually give the servant’s birthplace and his or her father’s occupation. I have analyzed all the marriage contracts of servants registered in Toulouse and Bordeaux in the years 1727–29 and 1787–89, periods chosen to illuminate changes over the course of the eighteenth century. For Paris, the great number of marriage contracts and the limited daily allowance of documents permitted to researchers in the Minutier Central (five per day) made a similarly thorough investigation impossible; there I relied on a small sample drawn from the years 1787–89.5 Marriage contracts are of course a source biased in favor of the more successful and prosperous servants, for only they could afford to marry. Therefore the evidence they provide of the poverty and deprivation of servants’ backgrounds is all the more striking.\n\nMarriage contracts reveal that servants were usually the sons and daughters of poor peasants, who left home and family to come to a town or city in search of work. As table 6 shows, the overwhelming majority were born in rural villages. This was especially true of female domestics; in all cities and in all periods men servants were more likely to be urban born than women were.\n\nMen were also more likely to migrate to the towns of their employment from long distances, as table 7 shows. Toulouse and Bordeaux show striking similarities in the recruitment patterns of servants. Female domestics were usually drawn from the towns and villages of a city’s immediate hinterland. As table 7 shows, over 50 percent of the women servants of Toulouse and over 70 percent of those of Bordeaux came from what I have labeled the “surrounding district,” that is, the dioceses of Toulouse and Bordeaux and those dioceses immediately adjacent to them.6 (The difference between the figures for the two cities results primarily from the fact that the dioceses surrounding Toulouse are much smaller than those around Bordeaux.) Toulouse’s servantes came mostly from the wheat-producing plains of the Garonne valley, while those of Bordeaux came from the vine-growing villages that now make up Bordeaux’s appellation controllée. The names of their birthplaces—Entre Deux Mers, St. Emilion, Fronsac, Médoc—would warm any wine-lover’s heart. Both the Garonne valley and the Bordelais were relatively prosperous during the eighteenth century. Male children of peasant families could therefore find work at home, or as agricultural laborers or vignerons; only girls were likely to be sent away to support themselves as servants in the nearby cities.\n\nMale servants, by contrast, tended to migrate from farther afield. A large proportion came from what I have labeled “feeding areas,” regions so poverty-stricken that male as well as female children were forced to leave at young ages to relieve their families of the burden of their support. For Toulouse the feeding area was the region to the south and southwest7 stretching to the foothills of the Basses-Pyrénées, where the land was rocky and difficult to farm, and where migration to Spain, often for years at a time, was the only alternative employment. For Bordeaux the feeding area was similarly hilly and impoverished.8 The city was a magnet for the peasants’ sons from the Bas-Limousin, a picturesque but unproductive region of green hills and valleys curving to the east and northeast of the city. Here too small rocky unproductive farms exported their men in regular cycles of migration.9 Male servants also came from other, more distant areas of France, or from foreign countries, more often than women servants did, as the columns labeled “Rest of France” and “Foreign” suggest.\n\nRecruitment patterns of Parisian servants differed slightly from those of Toulouse and Bordeaux, for the simple reason that the capital was a mecca for domestics: its high salaries and prestigious households drew ambitious servants of both sexes from all parts of the country. To “make it” as a servant sooner or later one had to go to Paris, just as to make it as an actor in America today one has sooner or later to go to Hollywood or New York. Therefore both male and female servants traveled longer distances to Paris than to Toulouse or Bordeaux (although Bordeaux too attracted the ambitious, since it was the gateway to the riches of the Indies). In other ways Parisian migration patterns matched those of the other cities.10 Servantes were more likely than male domestics to come from the Paris immediate hinterland, the Seine basin, and they often came by water because, as Richard Cobb has shown us, river barges were a favorite means of travel to Paris in the eighteenth century.11 Male servants came largely from a “feeding area,” which for Paris included the whole northern third of France: Normandy, Picardy, and Artois, the Val du Loire, Champagne, Burgundy, the Franche-Comté, and Lorraine. Much of this feeding area differed from the others in that it was not poor and mountainous but instead a rich fertile plain. But here too it was poverty that triggered migration, for these plains were divided into large estates farmed by landless agricultural laborers, brassiers, whose families sent their surplus sons to Paris to become domestics.\n\nThe patterns of migration of servants to the three cities differed little from those of other migrants to the same towns.12 Artisans and wage laborers newly come to these cities showed the same patterns of short hops for women and longer displacements, from the same poverty-stricken feeding areas, for men. They also showed the same tendency, seen in table 7, toward increasing longer distance migration as the eighteenth century progressed. As the price rise and overpopulation made conditions in the countryside worse, migration of all sorts increased, and immigrants to towns tended to come from farther and farther afield.13 All this suggests that the initial decision to enter domestic service was probably primarily a matter of “push” instead of “pull.” Poverty rather than hope for the future drove men and women from home, and domestic service was only one of several employments to choose from in the city.\n\nFurther evidence that it was poverty that drove people into domestic service comes from an analysis of servants’ social backgrounds. Most domestics came not only from poor sections of the country but also from the lowest levels of rural society: they were the sons and daughters of poor agricultural day laborers. This was especially likely to be true of female servants. As table 8 shows, the majority of servantes were the daughters of agricultural laborers: journaliers, manouvriers, brassiers, vignerons in the wine country of Bordeaux. Agricultural laborers formed the largest single category of fathers of female servants in all three cities. Other female servants were the daughters of petty rural craftsmen; those few who were urban-born were usually the daughters of textile workers or wage laborers. Only a small minority came from the respectable petty bourgeoisie. Not surprisingly this category was largest in Paris, which attracted the most ambitious and socially respectable servants.\n\nThe social background of male domestics was slightly different (see table 9). Although here too most came from families of agricultural laborers, men servants were more likely than women to have parents who had been in service themselves. They were also more likely to come from families of craftsmen (not surprisingly, since more of them were born in cities) and of minor public servants—huissiers and the like. Above all, they were more likely to have fathers who were members of the petty bourgeoisie: schoolmasters, notaries, surgeons. Again such respectably born servants were especially concentrated in Paris. Fully a quarter of the male servants in Daumard and Furet’s sample of marriage contracts for 1749 came from the petty bourgeoisie. But Toulouse also had a sizable number of men servants from such backgrounds in the 1720s (12.8 percent of all male domestics). In both cities the proportion of men servants from respectable backgrounds decreased in the course of the eighteenth century, probably because of the declining prestige of domestic service. The repectably born increasingly shunned an occupation labeled vile and degrading. They were replaced by young men whose poverty did not allow them such scruples. A clear “proletarianization” in the social backgrounds of male domestic servants occurred over the course of the eighteenth century. The percentage of those whose fathers were petty bourgeois and independent craftsmen declined, while those whose fathers were textile workers, wage laborers, and peasants rose. From the rural sector, fewer were sons of relatively well-off laboureurs and more were the sons of penniless journaliers and vignerons. In sum, the pattern of recruitment of male domestics drew closer to that of the less prestigious female servants in the last decades of the Old Regime. By then domestic service was, for both sexes, an occupation that attracted primarily the children of the poor whom their families could not support.\n\nFinding a Job—and Keeping It\n\nDomestic service was clearly what we would today call an entry-level occupation, a first job. People became servants at a young age and later often moved on to something else. There were certain exceptions to this, to be sure. Many tutors had been seminarians or law students before they entered a household; secretaries were often ex-law students or even lawyers. And the post of garde-chasse attracted army veterans, as the following advertisement attests: “Two cannoneers, one aged thirty-two and the other thirty-five, invalids of the Grimaldi Company, garrisoned at the Château Trompette, knowing how to write and hunt, want to become gardes-chasse. Address yourself to the château, to their captain, who will vouch for them” (Journal de Guienne, June 27, 1785).14 But apart from these cases, domestic service was an occupation for the young and inexperienced. The vogue for jockeys in the last half of the eighteenth century meant that boys could become servants at very young ages indeed. Advertisements for jockeys usually specified their ages as twelve or thirteen; one eleven-year-old advertising for the post in the Journal de Guienne stated that he had “already been in service.”15 Girls started their careers as domestics slightly later. Twelve to fifteen were the ages usually specified for beginning servantes and filles d’enfants in advertisements, and evidence from marriage contracts suggests that most female servants got their first jobs in their mid-to-late teens.\n\nJust how these young people left their native villages and found their first jobs in strange cities is not clear. Doubtless many were placed by parents or relatives. When the Chevalier de la Rénaudie hired fifteen-year-old Jean Germane as a farm servant, he noted in his livre de raison that the arrangment had been made with the boy’s father.16 Often young people were placed by older siblings already in service. Restif tells of a young man from Normandy who goes to Paris, gets a position as a secretary, and then finds a job for his younger sister and sends for her.17 Sometimes whole families migrated to the city in that way. One Parisian court case involved three sisters, all domestics; they had probaby come to Paris one at a time, the elder one finding a job for the next, and she in turn paving the way for the youngest.18 In such circumstances, with job and lodging guaranteed and a familiar face to greet you at the end of the road, leaving home was not too painful.\n\nBut if a young servant had to go off to the city alone, he or she was likely to have a difficult time of it. The journey itself could be frightening. Restif has a marvelous description of the trip of a young girl setting out from Normandy to go to Paris to become a servant. She traveled by public coach, wedged in among soldiers and prostitutes whose rough talk and manners frightened her, and three enormous peasant women who crowded her off her seat.19 Many young people seeking posts as domestics could not afford even such conveyances and went to the city on foot. This too could have its dangers. Marie Guillermine, daughter of a mason in the small Provençal village of Salon, left her home in 1765 to look for work in the larger town of St. Rémy. On the road she met a man who said, what a coincidence: he lived in St. Rémy and he was looking for a maid! Marie eagerly accepted his offer of work, only to be dragged off into the woods and raped along a deserted stretch of the road.20\n\nThe journey’s end could hold perils as well. Restif tells us, “There were always at the arrival of the public coaches [in Paris] unscrupulous men, employees of criminal haunts, shipping off into prostitution the newly arrived girls who have come to enter service.”21 If they avoided that trap, newcomers still had to find a place to sleep, and to learn the ropes of job-hunting in the city; they had to discover the location of the bureaux d’addresse, both legal and illegal, where jobs were listed, the names of cabaratiers who would be willing to take messages from prospective employers for a small fee, and the spots, like the petite porte of the Palais Royal in Paris, where out-of-work domestics congregated to be looked over by those seeking servants and to exchange tips on available openings.22 Such tips were probably a newcomer’s best hopes for finding a position, but even they could hold pitfalls for the inexperienced. Renée Letalu came to Paris from Brittany in 1750 “with the design of serving there as a femme de chambre.” She met a certain Mme. Beaufrère, who said that she had heard that La nommée Riquet knew someone who needed a maid. That someone, a Mme. Alléon, offered Renée a job as servante, which she took “while waiting for a better position.” But after three weeks Mme. Alléon told her she was no longer needed; however, she offered to introduce the girl to “a gallant gentleman” whose acquaintance might prove profitable to her. Renée at first refused, but after some discouraging job hunting she agreed to meet the man. He raped her, then set her up as his mistress, and eventually left her pregnant and syphilitic, her career as a servant over before it had really begun.23 Doubtless such occurrences were all too common. Failure to find a first job or settling for the wrong sort of position could mean a quick descent into criminality, with girls turning to prostitution to survive, and boys taking up that combination of scrounging, begging, and outright thievery which characterized male juvenile delinquency in eighteenty-century cities.24\n\nFinding the right first job was important for another reason as well. The first job seems more or less to have determined the level at which a servant would remain through his or her career. In Old Regime France domestics had little scope for advancement either within their original household or through changing positions. Their advancement within a household was limited by the lack of a strictly defined servant hierarchy which, as we have seen, characterized large establishments in this period.25 The noble households of prerevolutionary France did not offer the automatic progression from bootboy to butler, from skivvy to parlormaid to lady’s maid, which marked servants’ careers in Victorian England. Usually servants in great houses remained at the level at which they began. Nor was changing jobs a way to better one’s position. The goal of most servants was employment in a prestigious noble household. Yet it was almost impossible for, say, a woman who started her career as an inn servant to end up as a femme de chambre to the wife of a parlementaire. In general servants spent their careers in households of the same social level as the one where they first worked. An example is the career of Jeanne Duchamps, a servante who married in Bordeaux in 1788. When she made her marriage contract she had been with her current master, a merchant, for only three weeks; before that she had spent two months in a different household, three months in a second, and a year in a third. All but one of these previous employers were also merchants.26 Servants might sink on the social scale, for the bourgeoisie apparently derived some snobbish satisfaction from employing former members of noble households (for example, Marguerite Siari, former chambermaid of a marquise, was employed by a Toulousan avocat when she married,)27 but they rarely rose.\n\nDespite this discouraging situation servants changed jobs frequently, especially in the latter half of the eighteenth century. This suggests that while servants did not necessarily enter the occupation out of ambition, they often developed that quality in the course of their careers. Of course, servants had other reasons for changing jobs as well. Much of their movement was involuntary, when they were fired for incompetence or for some misdemeanor. And sometimes they left their jobs because that was the only way to escape from an intolerable situation—beatings, sexual abuse, and the like. Servants also changed jobs because that was often the only way they could get paid or get a raise. In the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, as we have seen, servants remained unpaid for long periods, and leaving a position was frequently the only way a servant could make his master actually hand over his wages. Even in the late eighteenth century, when payment was more regular, leaving a job was often the only way to get a raise, since employers tended to pay a servant his entry level salary throughout his career, although the general level of servants’ wages might have risen in the meantime. For example, one Marion, last name not recorded, was hired as a maid-of-all-work by the Marquis de Barneval in 1754 for the then fairly high salary of forty-eight livres per year. But she continued to receive this amount throughout the twenty-eight years she remained in the Marquis’s household. Meanwhile, wages had risen, of course; Marion’s successor was hired at a starting salary of sixty livres.28 Thus there were very practical reasons why a servant might quit his or her job. Nonetheless one gets the impression that many domestics left perfectly satisfactory positions because they imagined something better might lay just over the horizon. Many seem to have had an image in their minds of the ideal job: a post in a prestigious noble household, where the master was easygoing and liberal, the pay good, the work light, and the company below stairs congenial. And many spent their lives pursuing this chimera.\n\nBefore 1750 servant movement was inhibited by the fact that they were not paid and therefore could not save to tide them over a period of job-hunting. Lack of self-confidence and excessive deference to their masters may also have dampened their impulse to leave. But in the late eighteenth century the more regular payment of servants’ wages and the resulting boost to their self-image removed these inhibitions. In the livres de raison which I examined dating from 1600 to 1750, the average stay in a household for servants was four years; in those from 1750 to 1820 the average stay was only one and one-half years.29 In some households of the late eighteenth century the turnover was staggering. The Marquis de Barneval, a Toulousan noble, employed no less than 149 different servants between 1769 and 1783; three-quarters of these stayed less than one year, and of these three-quarters stayed less than six months.30\n\nIn the last decades of the Old Regime the career pattern of the typical servant showed a few relatively long stays at congenial households, interspersed with many short sojourns in less pleasing surroundings. A good example is the career of Marguerite Tallandier, a forty-six-year-old woman who had worked as a servante in Paris for twenty-two years. She stayed at her first job, with a marchand de vin, for three years, then moved on to the home of a marchande lingerie, where she stayed for four. Next came her apparently favorite post, with a clerk; she stayed there eleven years. But after he died she began a period of unhappy searching for a household she could like as well, remaining in one job for six months, another for three weeks, and so forth. She spent almost four years drifting from place to place.31 Most domestics held many jobs in their lives: between five and ten was probably the average, although some, like Damiens, the would-be assassin of Louis XV, served over thirty different masters.32 For such restless spirits, changing employment was a way of life: the ideal job always lay just over the hill.\n\nUnemployment and Downward Mobility\n\nChanging jobs could have its rewards, of course, but it had its dangers as well. Unless a servant lined up a new position (either through his own contacts with friends of his master or through the offices of a friendly servant in a household adding to its staff)33 before he quit his old one, job-changing carried with it the threat of a long period of unemployment—chomage in the French term. Nothing was more dangerous for servants’ ambitions, for even a few weeks’ unemployment could eat up the savings of a lifetime.\n\nSome unemployment among servants was of course involuntary and therefore unavoidable. This tended to peak in the summer months, when nobles in cities and towns shut up their hôtels and adjourned to their country châteaux during the hot weather, often taking only a small core of household staff with them and firing the rest.34 Unemployment among servants probably also rose with the price of bread,35 because high bread prices usually created commercial depressions in the preindustrial economy of the eighteenth century, prompting hard-hit artisan and mercantile employers to fire their servants. Thus domestics were often thrown on the job market just when the cost of the food they needed for survival was at its highest and when competition for what few jobs there were was sharpest because the cities were flooded with hordes of immigrants looking for work.\n\nServants with some savings could survive up to a month of unemployment with relative ease. Of course they had to adjust their life style to their new circumstances. They pawned their fine clothes, ate the black bread of the poor instead of the leavings of haut cuisine, and abandoned the fashionable districts of the city to seek lodging in the cheapest and most disreputable chambres garnies. Marc Botlan was fortunate enough to find the registers of some Parisian lodging houses in the 1770s. These show that unemployed servants were most often found in the seedy establishments of the rue du Pelican and the rue des Vieux-Augustins; they were much less likely to stay in the more respectable houses on the rue de Grenelle.36 With such adjustments, a servant could usually manage to survive for a few weeks. When Pierre Jallet, an unemployed valet de chambre, was asked at the Châtelet how he survived without a job “he replied that he did not work, that he waited for a position [to be obtained] through the protection of M. DuBarry or other employed servants, and that he lived on the interest from his loans, the belongings he had sold, and a few small rentes.” He neglected to mention that his wife worked as a femme de chambre, at least until she was fired because her mistress found her constant crying about her husband’s unemployment too depressing.37\n\nMost servants could manage to keep themselves fed and housed for a month of unemployment on about 15 livres, one-tenth of the yearly salary of a cocher—though more like one-third of that of a servante.38 But any more prolonged chomage could make serious inroads on their resources. Therefore after a month or so of joblessness, most unemployed servants bundled up their remaining belongings, left them with a trusted friend, and began to live a nomadic life, changing lodgings every few days to avoid paying the rent and turning their hands to any work available. Unemployed servantes often worked temporarily as laundresses or gardes-malades. But male servants, always more conscious of the gulf between themselves and the rest of the menu peuple, apparently refused to become day laborers and instead tried to survive by hanging around the fashionable districts and running errands for tips.39 If these expedients failed, servants would take to the road in earnest, trying their luck in another city, or going back home to throw themselves on the mercy of their families. When Françoise Maugras, a Parisian servante, was fired from her job in 1747, she packed up her remaining belongings, “nippes et hardes” consisting of a skirt, two chemises, an apron, twelve headkerchiefs, three fichus, and a pair of stockings, left them with her friend Lefebvre and his wife, and went back home for a stay which would last three years. When she returned to Paris she discovered that the Lefebvres, having had no word from her and thinking that she had died, had long ago sold all her possessions.40\n\nServant Criminality\n\nA final option for the unemployed and desperate servant was to turn to crime—to beggary, theft, or prostitution. And this brings us to one of the most misunderstood aspects of servants’ lives: their criminality. Most employers during the Old Regime were convinced that their servants were basically criminal at heart, and that their characteristic crime was vol domestique, the theft of money or goods by a servant from his master. And most officials of the royal and municipal governments believed that the dishonest servant was responsible for the great increase in theft which plagued French cities and towns in the last decades of the Old Regime. These notions were embodied in police ordinances, and they have been accepted uncritically by many modern historians.41 But these notions reveal more about the attitudes of the master class toward its domestics than they do about servant criminality. They reflect the subconscious fear and worry masters felt about the strangers who shared the intimacies of their households, a worry that grew to hysterical proportions with the more rapid turnover among servants in the last decades of the eighteenth century. But they do not reflect the realities of servant crime. For analyses of actual police and court records from the ancien régime show that in fact servants were probably less criminally inclined than other members of the lower classes; that when they did commit crimes they were more likely to be crimes of violence than theft; and that their thefts were usually not vol domestique but instead cases in which an unemployed servant robbed a friend, landlord, or casual passer-by.\n\nCourt records reveal that servants in general committed far fewer crimes than might be expected, given the size of their presence in urban populations. In Paris in the last decades of the eighteenth century, approximately 15 percent of the population were servants, but they contributed only 7.6 percent of those accused of crimes.42 Similarly, servants formed approximately 8 percent of the population of Bordeaux, but only 4 percent of all accused felons.43 Nor did servant criminality increase as the century progressed—in fact, the opposite occurred. In Toulouse, for example, the Parlement condemned to death for theft and other serious crimes an average of 1.09 persons per year between 1633 and 1728; 12.5 percent of these were servants. But between 1750 and 1778, the average condemnations per year rose to 7.79, but only 10.1 percent of these were domestics.44 Paris showed a similar trend. Servants were one of the few occupational groups whose proportional contribution to criminality declined over the last half of the eighteenth century, and this decline continued through the years of the Revolution.45 The only area of criminal statistics in which servants appear to have been over, rather than under, represented is that of violent crimes. The Châtelet records for the last decades of the Old Regime show that only 7 percent of all crimes involved violence, but almost 13 percent of those of servants did so.46 This tendency toward violence may reflect the rural backgrounds of most domestics: in early modern Europe violence was the characteristic crime of the countryside, while crimes against property typified urban criminality.47 Or it may have grown out of the high level of violence traditionally allowed to servants, since one of their duties—and privileges—was to chastise physically anyone who offended their masters. But whatever its cause, the penchant of servants for crimes of violence throws further doubt on traditionally accepted notions of servant larceny centering around vol domestique.\n\nDefenders of the traditional view of servant criminality might argue that criminal statistics of the Old Regime are not convincing, given the wide gap between crimes committed and those reported and prosecuted, and that these statistics are especially unreliable for cases of vol domestique. For it has been suggested that masters became increasingly reluctant to report and prosecute the thefts by their domestics during the course of the eighteenth century.48 Their reluctance is said to have stemmed from the ferocious punishment accorded such crimes. Vol domestique was considered worse than ordinary theft because it involved a betrayal of trust. A servant owed his primary loyalty to his master; his primary duty was the protection of his master’s property. Therefore a servant who robbed his master was doubly guilty: he was a disloyal servant as well as a thief. Given the familial rhetoric that surrounded the patriarchal household of the Old Regime, the act was almost equivalent to patricide. Thus it is not surprising that the crime was harshly punished. In all law codes of the Old Regime, vol domestique carried the death sentence, usually death by hanging. The coutume of Paris mandated that the guilty servant be executed on the doorstep of the master whom he had betrayed. This punishment is said to have been a major factor in dissuading masters from reporting domestic thefts. Their growing humanitarianism, so the argument goes, made them reluctant to exact the death penalty for petty pilfering, and their new notions of domestic comfort made the thought of a rotting corpse suspended in their doorway understandably distasteful.49\n\nDoubtless there is something to this argument. Employers’ memoirs of the period do show a humanitarian reluctance to prosecute servants for petty thefts. For example, the famous artist Elizabeth Vigée-Lebrun was robbed by one of her servants while in exile in St. Petersburg during the Revolution. She was unable to prevent the reporting of the crime, but she moved heaven and earth (“I cannot tell you what it cost me in prayers and solicitations,” she wrote) to see that the thief was pardoned. The young man’s parents had once been in her employ, and she did not want to inflict on them the grief of having their son hanged.50 But while such cases did occur I find it hard to believe that they were prevalent enough to alter substantially the statistics of servant criminality. Instead these statistics seem to me an accurate reflection of what we know of servants’ lives and attitudes. The generally low crime rate of servants could easily have stemmed from their passion for “respectability,” and their relatively high rate of violent crimes could reflect the license for violent behavior traditionally allowed male domestics.\n\nAnother way in which the criminal statistics seem to reflect the reality of servants’ lives is the fact that among at least the reported instances of servant thievery unemployed servants predominated. Statistics of servant larceny suggest that the typical servant thief was not the employed servante who filched her mistress’s handkerchief, but instead the out-of-work domestic who shoplifted, picked pockets, or robbed his landlord and fellow lodgers simply to stay alive. Such is the pattern revealed in thefts of servants prosecuted in the Châtelet in the last decades of the Old Regime, summarized in table 10, below. Clearly chomage drove the majority of servants to stealing.51\n\nTheft was simply the most desperate expedient by which unemployed servants stayed alive. Most thieving servants were not habitual criminals; instead, they were trying to survive as best they could. Unfortunately, however, the committing of just one theft could easily draw a servant from the paths of respectability, and plunge him—or, much less frequently, her52—permanently into the criminal underworld which existed in all French cities and towns. This was especially likely to happen if a servant stole clothing or table linen, favorite targets of servant larceny. Stolen money was easily spent, and stolen food was simply eaten, but stolen clothing or linen had to be disposed of through a fence. Frequently these were revendeuses, women who wandered the streets peddling patched and faded sheets, and skirts and stockings which had already passed through the hands of fifteen or twenty owners.53 Revendeuses were often wives of servants and former servants themselves, like Anne Baudière, ditte La Mangonette, wife of Jean Semèze, cocher, arrested for trafficking in stolen goods in Toulouse in 1689, and La nommée Faur, described by one of her criminal contacts as a former domestic and “married to a man who remains in the service of some gros Monsieur.”54 For revendeuse, was, like laundress, a logical occupation for a female servant forced to give up her job upon marriage. Servants were therefore often acquainted with these women, and they in turn often put the domestics who brought them goods to fence into contact with bands of robbers on the lookout for accomplices who might leave a window open or a door ajar for the convenience of thieves.55 Thus servants might be drawn into a permanent life of crime. This happened to Gabriel Larrisière, who began his career as the respected and well-paid cook of Cardinal Bonzi of Toulouse and ended it on a scaffold. Unemployment apparently drove Larrisière into petty thievery, and through this he discovered a criminal underworld which appealed to him more than the kitchens of les grands. He left domestic service, adopted a nom de guerre, Laforgue, and embarked on a career of crime, eventually joining a gang which stole the plate from church altars and fenced it through a shady goldsmith in Montauban. Larrisière was executed for vols avec effraction and sacrilege in 1717.56\n\nStories like Larrisière’s point up the dangers of chomage for servants. Long-term unemployment could not only wipe out the savings from decades of work; it could also set a servant on a downward spiral to disaster. The same also holds true for that special criminal opportunity for women: prostitution. The extent of servant prostitution, like servant thievery, has been greatly exaggerated by historians. And like thievery, prostitution is best understood in the context of servant unemployment and the desperation it induced.\n\nEver since Parent-Duchâtelet’s famous survey of Parisian prostitutes of the 1830s revealed that almost one-third of them had once been servants (thus making domestic service the most heavily represented former occupation among them), historians have assumed that servants were especially likely to join the ranks of the world’s oldest profession.57 For them the classic prostitute is the female servant seduced and then abandoned by her employer or swain and forced to sell herself to survive. Olwen Hufton, for example, emphasizes this type in her discussion of prostitution among the eighteenth-century poor.58\n\nThe notion that servants contributed heavily to the ranks of prostitutes fits well with employers’ perceptions of the immorality of domestics, but it does not accord with what we know about at least professional prostitution in the ancien régime. Unfortunately our knowledge is sparse, because lists of professional prostitutes rarely give anything besides their name and crime. Yet what information there is suggests that servants were in fact rather unlikely to become prostitutes. For example, in the lists of women condemned for prostitution to the Hôpital La Grave in Toulouse from 1729 to 1739, former occupations were given for fourteen. Only one was a former servante, although two others were, respectively, the wife of a cocher and the widow of a cuisinier.59 In Bordeaux, where prostitution flourished as befitted a great port, 150 professional prostitutes were listed on the capitation roll of 1784. But most of these were former lingères and couturières; the former servants among them were mostly ex-slaves from the West Indies, like Marie La Negresse and La Martiniquaise.60 In the records of arrest for prostitution in Bordeaux’s municipal archives, the only servant mentioned is a male domestique condemned for patronizing a fille de joie.61 Even in Paris, which had the most widespread, organized, and professionalized prostitution of any city in France, servants were surprisingly underrepresented among the inhabitants of brothels.62 And new studies of prostitution in the nineteenth century show that even in that era of Parent-Duchâtelet servants were not especially likely to take to the streets. Instead the needle trades were the largest contributors to the ranks of the filles de noce.63\n\nThus the traditional conception of the servant prostitute, like that of the servant thief, needs some revision. Nevertheless there were two types of female domestics who often became prostitutes: inn servants and the unemployed servante. That the serving women of inns, taverns, and cabarets would offer more than drinks to their customers was a longstanding tradition in European society. As M. Fournel, an eighteenth-century jurist, pointed out, in the laws of ancient Rome inn servants were classified as prostitutes. This tradition lingered in the law codes of the ancien régime: because of their equivocal reputation inn servants were denied the legal right to sue their seducers for damages if they became pregnant, a right that all other women, including all other types of domestic servants, enjoyed.64 This provision reflected the realities of their situation. Even in the eighteenth century, when most servants’ work had become monetized, inn servants apparently did not receive regular wages and lived solely on their tips. In one court case Jeanne Leconte, servante in the Reine de France in Bordeaux, was “interrogated how long she had been a servant in the aforesaid cabaret and how much she earned as wages. Responded that she had been a servant for two months and that she got no wages, only sharing gifts and tips with another servante.”65 Therefore it is not surprising, given the traditions of the occupation, that inn servants supplemented their meager earnings with casual prostitution. Those who made déclarations de grossesse, statements required by law of unwed mothers in the ancien régime, were quite frank about their activities. Marthe Peyrig, servante at the Bras d’Or in the Provençal town of Lambesc, stated that her pregnancy was the work of one of the inn’s overnight guests, an army officer; she had carried his bags to his room, and after what she described as “certain discourses,” they had sex.66 Rose Michel became pregnant by a frequent guest at the inn where she worked, a carter whose name she did not know; and Jeanne Marie Lamere, employed in a cabaret in Orgon, could not identify the author of her pregnancy; she confessed to “having been known abandonedly by various men.”67\n\nThe other type of female domestic likely to engage in prostitution was the unemployed servante. Whether out of work because she had been seduced and abandoned, or simply the victim of bad luck in the job market, the unemployed servante might easily turn to casual, short-term prostitution to survive. Such casual prostitution by normally respectable women was in fact the characteristic type of prostitution in the late eighteenth century and was far more widespread than the “professional” kind practiced by women who made prostitution their sole support. Part-time prostitution was not automatically considered disgraceful among the poor, who well understood the exigencies of survival. Nor did it necessarily represent a first step on the road to ruin. Many a woman who sold herself in time of need returned to respectability in better times and even eventually married.68 On the other hand, prostitution could also easily be the first step on a downward path to the criminal underworld. For prostitutes risked, besides the two obvious hazards of their calling, pregnancy and venereal disease (both of which could make a servante unfit for further respectable employment) contacts with the criminal world of shady cabarets and backstreet gambling; like servant thieves, servant prostitutes could therefore easily be drawn into a lifetime of crime.\n\nThese then were the risks of job-changing and unemployment: loss of savings and of hopes for the future, a hand-to-mouth existence of temporary jobs and shelters, an ignominious return to home and family, and an opening to criminal temptations which could draw a servant deep into the underworld of illegality. How many domestics succumbed to these dangers is impossible to say. In her study of nineteenth-century servants Theresa McBride estimated that about one-third were downwardly mobile.69 This is probably a good guess for the Old Regime as well.\n\nMoneymaking and Upward Mobility\n\nThe majority of servants, however, appear to have survived occasional spells of unemployment with little difficulty, and marched steadily onward toward their goals in life. Paramount among these was making money. Many servants were surpringly successful at this. As mentioned earlier, this least “capitalistic” of occupations ironically produced some of the shrewdest businessmen—and -women—and the largest fortunes among the working classes.\n\nAs we have seen, domestic service, with its high salaries and its wide variety of perks and perquisites, was at least after 1750, one of the more lucrative occupations open to the lower classes.70 And since their food and shelter were usually provided for them, servants could save almost every sou they earned. Therefore it is not surprising that they were among the wealthiest members of the lower classes.\n\nIt is difficult to compare the fortunes of servants with those other members of the lower classes because domestics were not listed under their own income level on capitation rolls. The best source for comparison is therefore marriage contracts, although admittedly these are biased in favor of the more prosperous types who could afford to marry. Analysis of marriage contracts reveals a striking pattern. In town after town of the Old Regime servants regularly commanded more wealth at marriage than did agricultural workers, wage laborers, or even artisans, and in many cases their fortunes matched those of the lower levels of the bourgeoisie.\n\nThe value of servant dowries in Toulouse, Bordeaux, and Paris are summarized in table 11. The patterns discernible here are not surprising. Male servants, as befitted their superior salaries and prestige, generally commanded greater wealth at marriage than did their female colleagues. Dowries were greater in commercial Bordeaux, with its higher wages, than in Toulouse, and they were greatest of all in Paris, that Promised Land of eighteenth-century servitude. And in each town and for each sex dowries rose dramatically with the rise in servants’ wages during the course of the eighteenth century.\n\nPerhaps the most striking feature of this table is the wide range of wealth it reveals. Even in the late eighteenth century there were servants whose total possessions at marriage were less than 100 livres. For example, the entire dowry of Jeanne Joffres, servante of Toulouse, is described as “a bit of linen,” so poor that the notary put no monetary value on it; and Magdeleine, an illegitimate farm servant, married solely on the strength of a forty-livre charitable donation from Toulouse’s Hôpital La Grave.71 Yet a substantial and growing segment of the servant population was well-off; an example is Gabriel Lachasse, Parisian cocher, who started life as the son of a poor farm laborer in Brie but, by the time he married, had accumulated 2,000 livres cash and numerous clothes and household goods, and his bride, widow of a master-shoemaker, owned property worth almost 4,000 livres.72 Such wealth was rarely found in other working-class occupations. In Bordeaux in the 1780s servants had more than double the proportion of dowries of over 800 livres than did masons; in Toulouse in the same period the average dowry of a servant was 100 livres more than that of an artisan and over 200 livres more than that of an agricultural laborer.73 And in mid-eighteenth-century Paris the percentage of servants with dowries of over 1,000 livres almost approached that of the bourgeois roturiers sans profession.74\n\nWhy were servants often so much wealthier than other lower class types? The answer lies in part in their large salaries and the opportunity for saving that their occupation afforded. But it also lies in the fact that their role as purchasers of household supplies for their employers gave them experience in the techniques of handling large sums of money denied to other members of the lower classes. Domestic service exposed them to the ways of wealth as well as the ways of the wealthy; they gained a sophisticated knowledge of financial practices which often encouraged them to try their luck at commerce. For example, many servants who learned about the wholesale food trade through buying provisions for their households eventually began to trade on their own account. Philippe Briquet, a maître d’hôtel to a baron in Toulouse, made sizable investments in wholesale wheat, financing them by loans from friends as well as his own savings.75 And while servants were especially active in the provisioning trades, these were not their only commercial activities. The notarial records of the ancien régime reveal servants who trafficked in everything from cotton stockings to mulberry leaves for the silk industry.76\n\nBut the favorite investment of servants was undoubtedly the rente, or personal loan at interest. In the Parisian estate inventories studied by Daniel Roche, almost 50 percent of the assets of servants who died intestate from 1695 to 1715 and over 50 percent of the assets of those who died intestate from 1775 to 1790 were in rentes. (Comparable figures for salaried workers were only 19 percent and 45 percent.)77 Servants were among the major buyers of the small rentes sold by charitable institutions.78 They also made many loans to private individuals. Servants were probably the major moneylenders to the menu peuple; loan transactions like that between Joseph Pidoux, suisse of Mme. La Maréchale de Broglie, and one Romedon, a secondhand dealer, who borrowed 48 livres from him, abound in the police and notarial records of the ancien régime.79 Even their social superiors were not above borrowing from domestics. A Toulousan avocat owed 300 livres to chef Louis Vintrou; a Jewish trader borrowed more than 6,800 livres from Parisian domestique Nicolas Cornette dit Champagne at a hefty 20 percent interest.80 Especially common were loans by servants to their employers. Costerine Patou, fille de service of the Dlle. de Vitry, was asked by her mistress if she had saved any of her wages from earlier jobs; she replied, yes, she had 200 livres. Madame promptly borrowed that to pay the household expenses. François Pages, a merchant in Toulouse, borrowed 550 livres at 5 percent interest from his servante; Dominique Trilhon, a priest, borrowed 200 livres from his. And a Bordelais maidservant, Jeanne Jonc, loaned her mistress, the widow of a noble, a total of 1,453 livres in the course of the twenty-five years she worked for her; this money probably kept the household going.81 So accustomed were servants to making loans that one gets the impression that many of them thought of money primarily in terms of the interest it could earn. Maidservant Marianne Fabruel, urged by her mistress to buy some new clothes, gave her employer 121 livres to purchase the garments. When her mistress refused to hand them over, Fabruel complained to the police: not only had she lost the 121 livres, she pointed out, but she had also lost the 5 percent interest she could have earned by loaning out the money.82\n\nTheir experience in handling money inspired many domestics to dream of leaving service and going into business. Femmes de chambre often hoped to set up shop as dressmakers; Anne Lavigne, for example, lady’s maid to the Marquise Denointelle, paid 200 livres to a marchande de modes for a two-year apprenticeship in that trade.83 The traditional ambition of male domestics was to go into the provisioning trades, following in the footsteps of Audiger, a seventeenth-century maître d’hôtel and author of La Maison réglée, who after failing to get monopolies on all the peas and roses (both great luxuries in the seventeenth century) sold in Paris, made a fortune selling lemonade and iced drinks in his shop near the Palais-Royal.84 By the 1780s, however, many male servants were interested in other forms of commerce as well, especially in the booming commercial cities like Bordeaux. Bordeaux’s newspaper, the Journal de Guienne, often carried advertisements placed by maîtres d’hôtel who wanted to become respectable clerks “in an office or shop” and cooks who wanted to set sail for the West Indies to make their fortune.85 Indeed, the sugar islands seem to have been the focus of the hopes and dreams of many ambitious servants in the eighteenth century. Femmes de chambre in Bordeaux offered to serve free of charge during the voyage employers who would pay for their passage to the Indies, and Parisian domestique Antoine Gonthier was cheated out of his savings by a man who promised to take him to Martinique, give him a slave, and set him up as a sugar planter.86\n\nServants’ grandiose dreams of becoming West Indian sugar planters were doubtless doomed to failure. Although there were a few spectacular examples of servants who made fortunes—Gourville, Audiger—most of them lived in the seventeenth century and owed a great deal to the generosity of noble patrons. The notion propagated by Montesquieu that many financiers of the Regency had once been domestics has recently been proven a myth.87 But servants’ more modest hopes of becoming shop clerks or marchandes de modes probably were realizable, although we have no way of knowing how many men and women deserted domestic service for such ventures or how well they fared.\n\nWhat attracted servants into the lower levels of commerce was not simply a desire for gain, for the financial rewards of such positions were rarely greater than those of domestic service. It was instead the bourgeois respectability such positions conferred. By the last decades of the eighteenth century the spread of the notion that domestic service was degrading made many servants desire to leave their occupation and join the ranks of the respectable. The Parisian chef L’Amireau provides a good example. His letters show that, although financially successful and proud of his skill at his craft, L’Amireau was self-conscious about and resentful of his position as a servant. He once apologized for a present he gave to his fiancée: it was not much, he wrote bitterly, but it was “sufficient and even very proper for a person obliged to servitude,” as he was. And one of his proudest moments came when he alone of all the household was asked to dine on terms of equality by a country curé.88 It was ambitious and touchy servants like L’Amireau who were most apt to desert the occupation for the sake of bourgeois respectability.\n\nLove, Sex, and Marriage\n\nA major goal for most servants, and one inextricably bound with their other goals of leaving service and moving up in the world, was marriage. Marriage was especially important for the female servant. Only in marriage could she legitimately seek sexual fulfillment and find real economic security. And only when she married could she cease to be a servant and become instead mistress of a household of her own.\n\nMarriage was less crucial for male domestics, both because their financial situation was more secure and because they faced fewer penalties if they sought sexual fulfillment outside the bonds of matrimony. Nonetheless most men servants also wanted to marry, and not only for the personal happiness it might bring. In early modern Europe marriage was an economic as well as a social rite of passage. Since the lower classes rarely married without some sort of economic stake, marriage symbolized the attainment of at least a modest financial success. It also marked the period when dependency ceased and a man became a true adult, when he left his father’s or his master’s household to found a household of his own and take upon himself the economic responsibilities of an adult member of the community. This symbolic aspect of marriage appealed to male servants, so conscious of their dependency. Marriage was a part of their dreams of achieving economic success and of being recognized as independent and respectable citizens by society. Again the correspondence of Parisian chef L’Amireau illustrates this feeling. In his letters to his fiancée he dwells as lovingly on the joys of being a respectable master of his own household, with a good bourgeois bonne ménagère for a wife, as he does on the pleasures of sharing their lives together.89\n\nBut servants who wished to marry faced a number of formidable obstacles, the most important of which was their employers’ prejudice against married domestics. Household manuals of the Old Regime were adamant on this point: married servants should be avoided at all costs. The problem with marriage was that it created divided loyalties. Married domestics could not devote themselves totally to their masters’ interests, as good servants should. Instead they would always be tempted to put the interests of their own families first. Married servants would be distracted from their duties by family worries; they would be tempted to insinuate their dependents into the household, to sneak away to visit their spouses, and to rob their masters to feed their hungry children.90 This preference for celibate servants is important, for masters had the means to enforce it. Not only could they refuse to hire married servants, but they could also prevent the marriages of those already employed, for by a law of 1567 employed domestics were required to obtain their masters’ permission before marrying.91 That masters did indeed prevent their servants from marrying is suggested by the fact that seventeenth-century confessionals listed a master’s denying his servants permission to marry for purely selfish reasons as a mortal sin.92\n\nThe prejudice against married servants never completely prevented their employment—in 1714, for example, the Sieur de Lamourous, Bordelais land-owner, hired Pierre Dupersson and his wife as “valet and servante in the house” at a combined wage of fifty-seven écus per year.93 And signs suggest that by the last decades of the eighteenth century employers were less inclined to exercise patriarchal controls over the private lives of their servants. The newspapers of the 1780s are full of advertisements of married domestics seeking employment in the same household: “A husband and wife, aged twenty-eight, want to be placed in a household, the one as domestique, the other as femme de chambre. Both know how to read, write, iron, and work in linen.”94 But the prejudice never completely disappeared. Even during the Revolution married servants feared dismissal, as the following anecdote, recounted by the Duc de Bourbon in a letter written in 1798, illustrates:\n\nA very interesting event … is a secret marriage: that of my servante, named Riche … and my intrepid marmiton Ursin. Fear of my whip prevented the disclosure while it was not strictly necessary, that is, not forced by any symptom of the appearance of any little Ursins. But they were afraid of an indiscretion and took the great decision to come and throw themselves at my feet to confess the mutual fault.… It was hard not to burst out laughing at the mixture of tears, sadness, happiness and worry of the new household which waited to be fired.95\n\nThe prejudice against married servants did not mean that servants had to forswear marriage completely. Their rates of celibacy were probably only slightly higher than those of the rest of the lower classes.96 But it did mean that their marriage patterns differed from those of artisans and wage laborers. Servants were more likely than any other lower-class group to indulge in premarital sex. They married later than artisans or wage laborers, and they married much more exogamously. They were, as we have seen, generally wealthier at marriage than other members of the lower classes, but marriage was for them often an economic setback instead of a benefit. All of these oddities in servants’ marriage patterns are directly traceable to the prejudice against married domestics.\n\nWe can see how the prejudice against married domestics shaped servants’ private lives as we follow them on their long road to the altar. Let us begin with the sex to whom marriage was most important: women. Most women servants began their careers in their mid-teens, but they generally did not marry until their late twenties or early thirties.97 The ten or fifteen years between their starting to work and their marriage was devoted to two objectives: first, accumulating a dowry large enough to snare a respectable husband, and second, avoiding an illegitimate pregnancy which might ruin their marriage prospects.\n\nOf the two, accumulating a dowry was infinitely easier. It was almost impossible for a lower-class woman to marry without a dowry, if only a modest lit garni (bed and linens) worth ten or twenty livres. In the south of France almost every couple made a marriage contract—91 percent of all servants marrying in eighteenth-century Toulouse did so, for example98—and almost every contract specified at least a small dowry. Usually the bride’s parents provided her dowry, but female servants came from backgrounds so poverty-stricken that they often had to provide their own. In my sample of marriage contracts from Toulouse and Bordeaux, only 10.8 percent of the women servants had their dowries given to them by their families, their master, or a charitable foundation, while 63.5 percent furnished their own dowries out of their own “salary and loans.”99 Luckily it was fairly easy for a servant to save a substantial sum, since she did not have to spend her salary on food and lodging. Indeed probably many women were attracted to domestic service in the first place because of the unparalleled opportunity it provided to save for a dowry.\n\nAs shown in table 11, the size of the dowries of female servants varied widely. Two factors influenced this: the length of time women worked before marriage and the type of job they held. Obviously the longer a woman worked the more she could earn and save. In Toulouse marriage contracts often specified the length of time a woman spent in service before marriage: it averaged 5.3 years in the 1720s and 4.8 in the 1780s.100 In Toulouse in the 1720s, women who worked for less than a year before they married had dowries that averaged only 47.3 livres, while those who worked from one to five years had dowries averaging 141.3 livres and those who worked for over five years had dowries averaging 219.3 livres. Equally important in determining dowry size was the type of job a woman held. Specialized upper servants usually earned higher salaries and therefore accumulated bigger dowries than mere servantes. In Toulouse in the 1780s, for example, the average dowry for servantes was only 210 livres but cooks, femmes de chambre, and gouvernantes commanded dowries averaging 452 livres, 700 livres, and 1,400 livres respectively. Also, women who worked in noble and bourgeois households, where salaries were more likely to be high—and to be regularly paid—generally found it easier to accumulate a large dowry than did farm servants or those employed in lower-class households.101\n\nThe size of a servant’s dowry was important, for it helped determine the sort of husband she could win, although obviously it was not the sole factor affecting the choice of a spouse. Servantes who kept up their ties to their family often returned home to marry a peasant suitor approved by their parents. Others married young men they met while in service: male servants in the same household (although masters’ prejudices against married domestics made such matches rarer than might be expected); artisans and clerks whose stores they visited; shopboys who came to the kitchen on errands; day laborers whom they met dancing at carnival time. But the size of dowries definitely affected a woman servant’s range of choice. As table 12 shows, servants and artisans who married female domestics generally demanded bigger dowries than did mere peasants or wage laborers. Male servants, after all, were fairly well-off and socially ambitious, and they needed a large fortune at marriage in case they had to leave service and set themselves up in some other occupation. And artisans could afford to be choosy, for they had much to offer a wife: they were among the most prosperous and prestigious members of the lower classes. Also, they tended to marry endogamously, wedding the sisters and daughters of fellow craftsmen; such alliances brought useful contacts within their crafts. A servant girl needed a large dowry to compete with such brides.\n\nThe marriage patterns of female servants have been classified in table 13. Two trends immediately stand out. The first is the low rate of endogamy—that is, marriage between servants. This trend is especially striking in the first half of the eighteenth century, when employers’ prejudices against married servants were strongest. In the latter half of the century the prejudice lessened, and the number of servant-servant marriages rose. But never (except in Paris, where married domestics could easily hire themselves out as servants by the day) did it approach the levels of endogamy usual among the menu peuple. In most eighteenth-century towns, after all, at least 40 percent and usually 50 percent of artisans married within their social group; among daily laborers the figure often rose to 60 or 70 percent.102\n\nThe second trend which table 13 reveals is a turn toward more adventurous and ambitious marriages as the century progressed. In both Toulouse and Bordeaux fewer servants returned to the villages of their birth to marry peasants and agricultural laborers in the last half of the eighteenth century; instead they increasingly cut themselves off from their families and early roots and established themselves permanently in town.103 And among townsmen they increasingly chose as husbands not the relatively “undemanding” textile workers and wage laborers, but instead domestics, artisans, and shopkeepers, who required substantial dowries from their brides. An apparent exception to this is Bordeaux, where the percentage of artisan husbands decreases and that of wage laborers increases from 1727–29 to 1787–89. But this is the exception that proves the rule. For in Bordeaux crafts became increasingly modernized and monetized in the last decades of the eighteenth century: instead of hiring apprentice journeymen who hoped to gain the maîtrise one day, masters increasingly employed laborers who worked for a daily wage. It is these tonneliers à la journée and garçons platiers à la journée who form the bulk of the “wage-laborer” category in Bordeaux in the 1780s. Because of the high wages in Bordeaux, they were relatively prosperous, and they could demand the substantial dowries traditional to craftsmen, as table 12 shows.\n\nThis turn toward more ambitious marriages on the part of the female servants obviously owed a great deal to the monetization of servants’ work and the rise in servants’ wages over the course of the eighteenth century. Higher wages allowed servants to accumulate large dowries and therefore to compete successfully with the daughters of artisans and shopkeepers for city-bred spouses. But the mere fact that servants could accumulate large dowries was not solely responsible for their turn toward more ambitious marriages in the late eighteenth century. Opportunity, after all, means little without the will to take advantage of it. It was probably the new self-confidence of female servants, bred of their participation in a market economy, which made them determined to strike the best possible bargain with life. For them this meant becoming the wife of a respectable and prosperous artisan or shopkeeper.\n\nAttaining this goal was not, however, simply a matter of saving for a dowry and looking around for a prospective husband on whom to bestow it. Husband-hunting was for female servants a perilous business. From the moment they began to work and save for a dowry until they arrived safely at the altar, they faced a danger that could ruin not only their marriage plans but all their hopes for the future: the bearing of an illegitimate child.\n\nWe know a great deal about the women who bore illegitimate children in Old Regime France because of the existence of déclarations de grossesse, statements required by French law of unwed mothers which are full of details about their seducers and the circumstances surrounding their pregnancies.104 Unfortunately no déclarations survive for either Paris or Toulouse, and only a spotty sample, three half-burned registers covering the years 1772 to 1784, exists for Bordeaux.105 I have analyzed these and also used an informative sample of over 2,000 déclarations covering almost all of the eighteenth century and drawn mostly from Aix-en-Provence, a parlementary city very like Toulouse in its economic and social makeup.106\n\nIn both, and indeed in every sample of déclarations that I know of, domestic servants formed the largest single category of women who became pregnant out of wedlock. In Aix they formed 58 percent of the total; in Bordeaux almost 20 percent, figures far greater than the proportion of servants in the female working population of the two towns. This suggests that there were aspects of domestic service that posed special threats to a woman’s virtue. And this was indeed the case. Déclarations show that all lower-class women, no matter what their occupation, ran a high risk of an illegitimate pregnancy during the months when they were courting. Sex between an engaged couple was apparently acceptable during the ancien régime, because of the popular tradition, dating back to before the Council of Trent, which regarded a betrothal as equivalent to marriage.107 If the woman became pregnant and eventually married, the result was a prebridal pregnancy, fairly widespread and easily tolerated by the society of the Old Regime. But if something—lack of money, family objections, or the man’s simply getting cold feet—prevented the marriage, the woman suffered through an illegitimate pregnancy and became part of the illegitimacy statistics. Domestic servants, however, faced a sort of double jeopardy. For in addition to the normal risks of pregnancy during courtship, servants ran the risk of being seduced during their long years of waiting and saving, before they could really start courtship in earnest, by either their masters or by the male servants in the households in which they worked.\n\nThis danger is illustrated in tables 14 and 15. Table 14 shows the sexual partners of the servants who made déclarations in Provence and Bordeaux. The largest categories of seducers were, first of all, male servants and second, masters and other men of the upper classes.108 Table 15 gives the ages of the servants at the time of their déclarations. This shows that while female servants involved in relationships with artisans and other lower-class potential suitors were usually in their late twenties and early thirties, years when they could legitimately begin to think about courting, those involved in relationships with their masters and other upper-class men were usually in their teens and early twenties, new to town and to their jobs and just beginning the long slow process of saving for a dowry.\n\nDoubtless these factors lay behind many of the sexual relationships between servant and master. The sheer loneliness of many maids, newcomers to the city, away from home and family for the first time, afraid or unable to make new friends in the city, must have driven them into their masters’ arms. For such women their masters’ advances were a sign that at least someone knew and cared about their existence. The sexual frustration involved in the long years of waiting until they could start courting doubtless also made many servants enter into relationships with their masters. So too did the temptations to cut these years short by accumulating a dowry through “gifts” bestowed by enamored employers, for upper-class men often promised to “take care of” their lower-class paramours, and offered them gifts of money, clothing, and jewelry in exchange for their favors. Such promises were made in 26 percent of the master-servant cases in my sample from Provence. A few servants may have even fallen in love with their employers, who with their fine clothes and manners might be more attractive than the rough cobblers and carters who came courting. After all, domestic service exposed its practitioners to a dazzling new world of wealth and luxury, and it is not surprising that at least some of them found this world—and its inhabitants—more alluring than their own.\n\nThe déclarations suggest, however, that the majority of servants accepted their masters’ advances not out of loneliness, desire, or love, but simply because they felt they had no other choice. A servant, after all, shared a house with her master; she had nowhere to hide if he was bent on her seduction. She was all too easily approached as she slept on the kitchen hearth or outside her master’s door, all too easily cornered as she went on her daily rounds. Employers did not scruple to use physical force against their servants. Thérèse Cavaillon, twenty-two-year-old servante of the receveur des gabelles at Berre, was raped at knifepoint by the son of the house on carnival day when he knew that no one else would be at home to hear her screams.109 But usually force was unnecessary; in most cases economic threats sufficed. Marguerite Angellin slept with her master, although, she stated, he “was married and even a grandfather,” because “he said that if she didn’t he wouldn’t pay her wages.”110 A final factor at work was the long tradition of the sexual exploitation of servant by master, which doubtless made many maids give in with a sense of resigning themselves to the inevitable.111 Farm servant Thérèse Roux expressed this in her déclaration when she said that she had at first resisted the advances of her employer, Louis Seste, “but since he was her master she was obliged to consent.”112\n\nMany of the same factors were involved in the seduction of servantes by their male fellow domestics. Like masters, fellow workers too could offer relief from the loneliness and frustrations of the years of waiting; like masters, they too could take advantage of sharing the same household to force themselves on reluctant women. And if they lacked the economic threats which masters could make, they had an equally potent weapon in the promise of marriage.\n\nDéclarations suggest that sexual relationships between servants in the same household could take three forms. Some were clearly exploitative: male servants taking advantage of living under the same roof to trap their prey. Servante Magdeleine Comte was raped on the dining room table by the domestique of the household while she was folding linen.113 Often servants were attacked as they made the bed, not only for reasons of comfort, but also because of the suggestive overtones of the task.114 Not all servant-servant relationships were exploitative, however; in the two other types the female servants were willing and even eager victims. One type was the “courtship gone wrong”—relationship in which two servants fell in love and planned to marry but were prevented from doing so, usually by money problems. This was especially likely to happen in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, when the prejudice against married domestics meant that both of the potential partners often had to find new careers if they married. In fact marriage was so difficult for domestics in this period that it seems probable that any female servant in earnest about getting married would not become serious about a servant suitor. She would instead indulge in a servant-servant relationship—the other type—a love affair with no thought of marriage. Doubtless many cooks and maids found that such affairs enlivened their long years of waiting with flirtation and romance. Déclarations show that such relationships often began during the summer months when households adjourned to the country. It is easy to imagine how the fine weather and the relaxation of household discipline turned servants’ thoughts to love.115\n\nIn the last half of the eighteenth century the dissipation of the prejudice against married domestics seems to have changed romance within the household. Servant could now court servant in earnest. Therefore it seems likely that in the last half of the eighteenth century fewer servant-servant relationships were “waiting games” and more were genuine courtships, and that more servant-servant relationships ended in marriage rather than in an illegitimate pregnancy, as was the case earlier. Evidence for this comes from a comparison of tables 13 and 14, showing the husbands and seducers of female servants. In the last decade of the Old Regime the proportion of servant-servant illegitimacies declined dramatically, while the proportion of servant-servant marriages rose.116\n\nMasters and fellow servants were of course not the only sexual partners of female domestics. As table 14 shows, they also slept with artisans, day laborers, soldiers, sailors, and other members of the lower classes. The advanced ages of the female servants in such cases (see table 15) suggest that they entered these relationships with marriage in mind—that these were either cases of genuine “courtship gone wrong” or cases in which the servant slept with a man in hopes of receiving a marriage proposal. During their courting years female servants were probably more likely to end up seduced and abandoned than other women of the lower classes, both because they had much greater freedom of action than girls living with their families and because, uprooted as they were, they could not bring to bear the pressures of parents and community on their suitors to make them do their duty. For despite the premises of patriarchy, masters did not act in loco parentis in this matter. In Old Regime households servants could come and go more or less as they pleased, and they could entertain their suitors in the kitchen or their rooms more or less at will. Eighteenth-century police records are full of complaints like that of Sr. Jean Duré, master tailor in Paris, who employed a servant named Nanette who had always behaved “with dignity.” But one day Duré entered the kitchen unexpectedly and surprised Nanette in the arms of a young man named Gaillard, who during the ensuing shouting match fled naked except for his shirt.117 Déclarations show that the majority of sexual relationships between female servants and lower-class suitors were consummated not in the man’s lodgings but in the household where the servant worked. Given their freedom of action and their lack of protection it is not surprising that many servantes were taken advantage of by unscrupulous suitors; instead it seems amazing that any managed to marry at all.\n\nServants who were seduced and abandoned faced a bleak future. To be sure, an illegitimate pregnancy did not inevitably ruin a servant’s life. In my samples of wills I found two made by women servants who acknowledged bearing bastard children; they had left their babies with peasant nurses and gone on working.118 An illegitimate pregnancy did not even necessarily ruin a servant’s prospects for marriage. But on the other hand, it took an enormous dowry to wipe out such a stain on one’s character. This is shown by the case of Marie Pradel, a twenty-eight-year-old servante who gave birth to a bastard in 1721. The next year she robbed her master of over 2,000 livres, most of which she handed over to Louis Bonamy as part of the substantial dowry he had demanded before he agreed to marry her.\n\nMarie’s act is a measure of the desperation an illegitimate pregnancy could induce. Most servants found it difficult to survive one. They usually lost their jobs when their condition became apparent, especially if their mistress thought the husband or son of the house might be responsible for their pregnancy. They could not go home for fear of bringing disgrace upon their families. Therefore they took to the road, sleeping in the open and supporting themselves by beggary, theft, and/or prostitution. The interrogations of servants arrested for infanticide offer glimpses of this life on the road. For example, Anne Coignet gave birth to her baby in the open, by a river bank, and left the child behind a tree stump, although when arrested she maintained that she had given it to a passer-by to take to a hospital. Bertrande Fouquelle bore her child in an abandoned hut. After it was born she simply reached up through a hole in the thatch and left it on the roof. She too denied her guilt and maintained that the baby had been born dead.119 Such unconvincing lies are frequently found in infanticide interrogations; they represent, I think, what the woman desperately wished was the truth.\n\nDisgrace, dismissal, descent into vagabondage, theft, and prostitution, perhaps even the killing of one’s child on one’s conscience: the price female servants paid for their sexual indiscretions could be heavy. Young girls who entered servitude in order to marry were therefore taking a risky gamble. The circumstances of the occupation made it easy for them to save for a dowry, but it also exposed them to heightened risks of seduction, illicit pregnancy, and all the problems they entailed. Those servantes who managed to marry were not only very clever—they were also very lucky.\n\nFor male servants marriage was neither so vital nor so difficult as it was for their female counterparts. Obviously men could relieve the sexual frustrations of the long years of waiting for marriage without the disastrous consequences that befell their female colleagues. Menservants appear to have taken full advantage of this fact. In most samples of déclarations male servants formed the largest single occupational category of accused seducers (see table 14). After all, they had certain advantages which their rival craftsmen and artisans lacked. First of all, menservants were usually handsome, because they were hired to look well in livery, and their fine clothes and sophisticated manner, adopted in imitation of their masters, might well turn a woman’s head. Second, unlike most other workers, they had a lot of free time from their not very arduous duties to spend in the pursuit of women. Third, they often inhabited a special servant subculture which encouraged both exploiting women and boasting about it. Traces of this subculture appear in police records. The reports of the Parisian commissaires de police, for example, memorialize one twenty-year-old lackey, Jean-Jacques Toussaint, who bragged in a cabaret to two male friends, both also servants, about his seduction of a seventeen-year-old laundress, Marie-Jeanne Dubuisson. He said that Marie was his mistress, that he had had her maidenhead, that he had made her reach climax three times the previous night, and that he was sure he had made her a baby.120 Fourth, male domestics had virtually unlimited access to a captive group of women—the female servants in their household. And finally, male domestics found it easier than other young men to abandon rather than marry their victims, not only because the households in which they worked traveled frequently, but also because they themselves changed jobs so often.\n\nAll these factors facilitated their careers as lady-killers. As table 16 shows, male servants most often bestowed their sexual attentions on their fellow servants, but they also seduced laundresses, peddlers, and textile workers. They were also attracted to couturières, whose fine clothes and lady-like demeanor, adopted in imitation of their customers, appealed to men who themselves imitated the appearance and adopted the manners of their upper-class masters.\n\nYet despite the ease with which male servants found sexual companionship, most wanted to marry. Marriage was for male domestics a badge of the success and respectability they craved. Their choice of wives reflected this. Table 17 gives the family backgrounds (derived from the occupations of their fathers) of the brides of men servants in our sample of towns and periods. This shows that male domestics had a strong tendency to “marry up” on the social scale, especially in the last half of the eighteenth century. It was a popular truism in the ancien régime that respectable young women shunned male servants because of their bad sexual reputation; in an anonymous Misère des domestiques a lackey complained: “Mais bien plus qu’une fille ait en soit peu d’honneur / D’un habit de livrée elle aura de l’horreur.”121 Yet their marriage contracts show that male servants successfully wooed the daughters of respectable artisans and shopkeepers and even members of the petite bourgeoisie, like surgeons and schoolmasters, and sometimes even the daughters of marchands and négociants. In 1787 in Bordeaux, for example, Pierre Georges, cook of a président à mortier in the Parlement, married Dlle. Jeanne-Claudine Groy, the daughter of a small-scale negociant with a respectable dowry of 7,000 livres.122 Male servants favored the daughters of artisans and shopkeepers not only because of their respectability, but also because their fathers might help them leave service and make a new start in a shop or craft. The same reasons made the daughters or widows of cabaratiers, bakers, and other members of the food and lodging trades attractive to domestics; such businesses were logical places for ex-servants to put their skills to work. And the daughters of marchands and négociants of course offered a chance to go into commerce. This tendency of menservants to make ambitious, hardheaded marriages which offered both respectability and new careers increased noticeably in the course of the eighteenth century. By the last decades of the Old Regime most male domestics were themselves the sons of the poorest agricultural laborers, but their brides were increasingly drawn from the artisanate, the food and lodging trades, and the bourgeoisie. For male servants, as for their female counterparts, marriage was intimately bound up with their hopes for the future.\n\nThe Obscure Later Years\n\nGiven the importance that most servants attached to marriage, it is sad to report that for many of them their wedding day marked the beginning of a period of financial and personal problems. Little is known about the middle and old age of servants—or indeed about that of the lower classes in general. But what we do know suggests that for domestics marriage often marked the beginning of financial setbacks that would darken their later years and heighten the tensions between spouses that seem to have marked the marriages of servants.\n\nThe evidence that many servant marriages were unhappy comes mainly from police records—admittedly a biased source, since only couples who fought called in the police or were reported by the neighbors. But the marital problems recorded in police records appear to have been widespread; when divorce was legalized during the Revolution servants were in the forefront of those taking advantage of the new laws.123\n\nWhy were servant marriages so often troubled? In part their problems seem to have stemmed from the fact that they married so late. By their early thirties, both bride and groom were usually set in their ways, and it was difficult for them to adjust to the give and take of married life. Late marriages also meant that often servant couples did not have the children who might have held together a bad marriage. Jean-Pierre Gutton has reconstructed the families of servants who married in the parish of Saint-Nizier in Lyons in every tenth year from 1710 to 1790. He found that only 22.7 percent of all married servant couples had children, and that of these more than one-third had only one child.124\n\nThe prejudice of employers against married servants was another source of tension. For this meant that a servant couple either had to quit their jobs and find new ones when they married, or live apart. In the former case the financial problems of making a new start often put strains on the union. In his complaint to the police Anglebert Théodore Berg, a former Parisian valet de chambre, stated that the trouble between him and his wife, a ladies-maid, stemmed from their decision to leave service and set up in business as marchands de vin. His wife became a drunkard and drank up all the profits. The couple fought and finally separated, each eventually going back into domestic service.125\n\nRemaining in service could lead to problems as well. The prejudice against married servants meant that the couple could rarely find work in the same household and therefore had to live apart. If both stayed in service, they lived in their separate households, like our chef L’Amireau and his Rose, who, despite L’Amireau’s dreams of having his own home and turning his wife into a proper bourgeoise ménagère, refused to give up her job when she married.126 More often, however, only the husband continued in service. The wife became a laundress, ouvrière en linge, marchande de bière, or the like, and was established in rented rooms, where her husband visited her whenever he could get away from his duties. Such was the arrangement adopted by Jean Le Doux, domestique of the Marquise de St. Sulpice. In a complaint to the police he was described as living in the Marquise’s household on the rue des Vieilles Huileries, while his wife, Marie-Magdeleine Fosinier, a revendeuse de bas, lived in a nearby apartment on the rue Sts. Pères.127 Either way, the couple saw each other only at infrequent and irregular intervals. L’Amireau and his wife, for example, met mostly for walks in the public gardens of Paris, just as they had during their courtship.128\n\nIn these circumstances relationships were easily corroded by misunderstandings and suspicions, especially about sexual fidelity. This is shown in police records. In complaints to Parisian commissaires de police, both Françoise Guillet and Marie Quidou, wives of the cocher of the Comte de Guehry and the valet de chambre of the Comte de Vaugrenon, respectively, were accused of taking lovers during their husbands’ frequent absences, and Françoise Baudouin, married to Nicolas Poivre, cocher of M. de Berque, suspected her husband of carrying on an affair with the wife of his employer, whose household he of course shared.129 Even when there were no such suspicions servant marriages were often precarious; separated for so much of the time, the spouses often simply drifted apart. One such couple was François Tournier, domestique of the Comtesse de Bonnevaille, and his wife Françoise Braty, a marchande de linge. Braty complained to the police that over the years her husband had gradually grown indifferent toward her and no longer took an interest in their children.130\n\nThe marriage of L’Amireau and his wife Rose shows a similar history of love turning to indifference and finally hatred. During their courtship L’Amireau idolized his bride-to-be; he wrote a poem to her and stood in the rain for hours waiting for their rendezvous.131 But after they were wed in 1786, they argued over Rose’s reluctance to give up her job and turn herself into a ménagère, and despite the birth of a daughter, Caroline, whom they both seem to have loved, they grew apart. The relationship between them became so bad that in 1791 L’Amireau refused to attend a farewell party given for his father-in-law, Pierre Farcy, a valet de chambre, who was emigrating to Switzerland with his employer. He explained that he wished to avoid meeting his wife there. In a letter of apology to his father-in-law he wrote: “Now I still love my wife enough, in spite of all the trouble she has caused me, not to give her the discomfort of finding herself face to face with me.”132 The L’Amireau marriage was probably unique only in being so well documented. Its problems were common enough.\n\nIf marital tensions cast a shadow over the later years of many domestics, so too did financial difficulties. As we have seen, when they made their marriage contracts servants were in general wealthier than other members of the lower classes. But by their death they had lost this advantage, and were often worse off than artisans and even agricultural laborers. In Toulouse for example, in the late 1780s, servant marriage contracts averaged 434 livres, while those of petty craftsmen averaged 291 livres, and those of agricultural laborers a mere 228 livres. But inventaires après décès, the official evaluation of estates of people who died without leaving a will, paint a different picture. The average estate of an intestate domestic was only 912 livres, while that of petty craftsmen was 1,841 livres.133 This pattern was common in most cities and towns. Only in Paris, home of the highest salaries and most ambitious domestics, did servants manage to retain their financial superiority over other members of the lower classes into their old age. There, in 1790, the median of servant inventaires was 3,000 livres, and many female servants left estates of 10,000 to 15,000 livres, while those of men servants could rise as high as 55,000 livres. But the median estate of a day laborer was only 500 livres.134\n\nExcept for the prosperous Parisians, servants clearly lost ground financially in the years between their marriages and their deaths. Why did this happen? A number of factors seem to have been at work. If a husband or wife—or both—changed jobs when they married, they were faced with the financial difficulties of starting out on a new job or launching a new business, and often, especially for female servants, their new career—laundress, revendeuse—was much less lucrative than the one they had left behind. And if the couple set up their own household, they lost the great financial advantage of having their food and shelter provided for them. A valet de chambre’s 250-300-livre annual salary did not seem nearly so princely when, instead of being saved and invested in loans and rentes, it had to be spent on the basic necessities of life.\n\nAnother factor which contributed to the relatively precarious financial situation of older servants was the expensive tastes many acquired during their service in wealthy households. Servants were much more likely than other members of the lower classes to spend their money on fine clothes and furnishings, on pocket watches and other marks of social status. Daniel Roche has analyzed inventaires après décès from eighteenth-century Paris, and he found that servants spent more than twice as much on their beds and bedding—fine woolen coverlets, feather pillows—than did artisans, and that femmes de chambre usually had clothes worth four to six times as much as those of the humble wives of compagnons.135 Obviously a taste for the little luxuries of life could have a disastrous effect on a servant’s financial situation.\n\nThe other spending habit that servants acquired from their employers—investing in rentes and other sophisticated liquid assets, rather than in land and shops as artisans and peasants did—also seems to have contributed to their gradual decline in fortune. For while such investments could provide larger immediate returns than land or a shop, they were also much more risky. Debtors could all too easily run away without repaying their loans. But investments in land or a business usually retained their value—and could be passed on to children.\n\nA final factor in the relative penury of older servants was their unique family pattern. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the care of those too old or infirm to work was generally a family responsibility. Sons and daughters, grandchildren, and even nieces and nephews accepted, albeit grudgingly, their duties toward the elderly.136 Servants, however, were often deprived of the security of having someone to care for them in old age. As we have seen, they were more likely to remain unmarried than were other memb"
