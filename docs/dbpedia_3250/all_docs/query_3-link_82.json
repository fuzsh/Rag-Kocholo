        "text": "The highlight of the 44Cup event calendar is undoubtedly always the World Championship, because it means additional spectacle and thrills to the limit for everyone involved.\n\nThis year, the 44Cup race management has chosen a special location for the World Championship. For the first time in a long while, the RC44 racing circus is travelling away from the sea to inland waters, and this time to nothing less than “our” Lake Lucerne.\n\nThis picturesque lake was the setting for a number of historic events relating to the founding and formation of Switzerland. In this sense, rivalries – albeit perhaps less “sporting” ones – have been played out on this mystical body of water in the past.\n\nIt is perhaps a little less in the mentality of the locals to talk in superlatives. But the idyllic harbour at the mouth of Lake Uri has rarely seen anything like the 44Cup racing circus coming to Brunnen in mid-August. The famous winds on Lake Uri attract a large number of water sports enthusiasts with all kinds of kites and sails. But the arrival of nine ocean-going racing yachts will cause quite a stir on land alone. Of course, the racing teams and all those travelling to the event will want for nothing. After all, Brunnen, like the entire Lake Lucerne region, is renowned for its hospitality.\n\nThe regatta is organised by the “44Cup Brunnen” association and the RC44 management. And as a Swiss regatta team and 44Cup competitor, the Black Star Sailing Team is also very keen to ensure that this regatta is a success. Not just as an event, of course.\n\nAs a local team, Black Star Sailing trains every year on Lake Uri. In 2022, Black Star became world champion in the GC32 foiling catamaran class! It’s hardly surprising that the team led by skipper Christian Zuerrer has big plans for the World Championships on Lake Uri.\n\nWe look forward to your support on site! (More on this below.) And if you can’t be there, it’s best to follow the regatta on these channels:"
