Perhaps no, not Luisa, his ex-wife and not Marine Cretu – his ex-girlfriend.\n\nAncelotti is currently dating a stunning blonde identified as Mariann Barrena McClay. Below is the stunning photo of his hot Canadian woman.\n\nShe loves Carlo very much because is fun to be with. Below is a photo of them attending the Oktoberfest (Oktoberfest is the world’s largest Volksfest, which is held annually in Munich, Bavaria, Germany).\n\nMariann Barrena McClay was born in Vancouver, Canada, to María Concepción Gutiérrez and Antonio Barrena. With an impressive academic background, she holds an MBA in Marketing from Thunderbird School of Global Management, an MBA in International Business, and a PhD in Finance from Cass Business School. Additionally, she earned a BBA in Business Administration from Simon Fraser University.\n\nBefore her marriage, Mariann worked as a consultant at Barclays Bank in London. It was during this time, in 2011, that she met Carlo Ancelotti, who was then managing Chelsea. Their relationship blossomed, and they married in Vancouver in July 2014.\n\nAw! They look so happy, and we don’t know whose baby she is holding at that time. It was their second marriage for both of them, and Mariann has a very pretty teenage daughter, Chloe McClay.\n\nAbout Luisa, Carlo Ancelotti’s Ex-Wife:\n\nBefore her, Carlo was married to his wife Luisa for over two decades. When looking at their photo below, one thing is common. Carlo surely has an eye for beautiful women.\n\nAfter splitting with Luisa, he dated gal Marina Cretu, who is 13 years younger than him. Ancelotti and his ex-wife Luisa Gibellini have two children: Davide, who is a Real Madrid fitness coach.\n\nJust as Harry Redknapp, Steve Bruce and Zinedine Zidane have given their sons opportunities in football, Carlo Ancelotti has also done the same.\n\nHe once appointed his inexperienced son, Davide, as Bayern Munich’s assistant coach while he was at the Allianz Arena.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti has a daughter named Katia, who is from his ex-wife. Below is a photo of lookalike Katia and her father.\n\nKatia is his first child and daughter, born on the 18th of April, 1984. She got married in 2014 to her partner,\n\nCarlo Ancelotti’s Personal Life:\n\nThe manager has the following attributes in his personality:"
