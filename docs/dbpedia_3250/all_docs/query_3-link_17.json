Switzerland received the most votes among UEFA delegates, beating a combined proposal from the Nordic countries, Poland and France. Explore the 8 Swiss stadiums that will host the Women's Euro in two years' time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n16 national teams to compete in Euro 2025\n\nSwitzerland, which is also home to UEFA and world football's governing body FIFA, co-hosted the men's European Championships in 2008 with Austria and organised the men's World Cup in 1954. The country's football traditions are therefore rich and the Helvetians have proven that they are capable of hosting major sporting events at their home.\n\nHowever, before Europe's best players take to the Swiss pitches, qualifiers must take place to determine the 15 teams that will join the hosts in 2025. European qualification will begin in spring 2024, after the Women's Nations League. The qualification consists of a league phase and a final play-off tournament. Residents of Switzerland can bet on sports through some of the most popular betting sites, where they can find the best odds.\n\n© ovoltaire\n\nOnce all of the national teams are known, it will be time for competitive excitement. So meet the 8 football arenas with a total capacity of 175 000, which will allow more than 700 000 tickets to be sold for the 31 matches to be played.\n\n8 stadiums in 8 cities in Switzerland\n\nThe selected arenas consist of three venues capable of accommodating more than 30,000 fans. One of them is St. Jakob-Park in Basel, home to FC Basel and the biggest stadium in Switzerland with a capacity of 37,500 spectators. The other two 30,000-seaters are Stadion Wankdorf in Bern, home of Young Boys and Stade de Genéve in Geneva, where Servette FC play on daily basis.\n\nOther stadiums include Letzigrund in Zurich with 26,104 seats, known for hosting athletics meetings as well as Stade de Tourbillon in Sion with a capacity of 14,283 spectators and Stadion St. Gallen with a seating capacity close to 20,000. Stadion Luzern in Lucerne will seat 16,800 fans, and lastly Arena Thun with a capacity of 10,000 spectators.\n\n© Michał Nowak\n\nGreat excitement lies ahead in magnificent stadiums. Switzerland is a beautiful country whose beautiful landscapes, historic cities, Alps and crystal-clear lakes delight all visitors. In two years' time, fans from all over Europe will come there to cheer on their national teams. The upcoming tournament is sure to be very successful and the size of the stadiums will allow for a large turnout. If you haven't yet thought about your holiday plans for 2025 then you should already do so and book time for football excitement."
