See UEFA Coefficients calculation method for more information on how to calculate the coefficients.\n\nSee below for the rankings from 2009-2017, the rankings from 2004-2008, the rankings from 1999-2003, the rankings before 1999, and for a list of exceptions in the calculation of the coefficients. An overview of all clubs in this database is given at clubs participating in European Cups since 1955.\n\nThe first part of this database contains the results valid since the 2017/18 season: the club ranking is only based on the number of points of each individual club with a minimum of 20% of the country ranking.\n\nMatches Country Coefficients Country Ranking Club Points Club Ranking 10-year Ranking 2027 2027 2027 2026 2026 2026 2025 2025 2025 2023/2024 2023/2024 2024 2023/2024 2024 2024 2022/2023 2022/2023 2023 2022/2023 2023 2023 2021/2022 2021/2022 2022 2021/2022 2022 2022 2020/2021 2020/2021 2021 2020/2021 2021 2021 2019/2020 2019/2020 2020 2019/2020 2020 2020 2018/2019 2018/2019 2019 2018/2019 2019 2019 2017/2018 2017/2018 2018 2017/2018 2018 2018\n\nThe 2nd part of the database contains the results from 2009 until 2017. Team coefficients are based on the number of points of each individual team added to 20% of the country coefficient. For rankings before 2009 see below.\n\nMatches Country Coefficients Country Ranking Team Coefficients Team Ranking 2016/2017 2016/2017 2017 2016/2017 2017 2015/2016 2015/2016 2016 2015/2016 2016 2014/2015 2014/2015 2015 2014/2015 2015 2013/2014 2013/2014 2014 2013/2014 2014 2012/2013 2012/2013 2013 2012/2013 2013 2011/2012 2011/2012 2012 2011/2012 2012 2010/2011 2010/2011 2011 2010/2011 2011 2009/2010 2009/2010 2010 2009/2010 2010 2008/2009 2008/2009 2009 2008/2009 2009 2007/2008 2007/2008 2007/2008 2006/2007 2006/2007 2006/2007 2005/2006 2005/2006 2005/2006 2004/2005 2004/2005 2004/2005\n\nThe 3rd part of the database contains the results from 2004 until 2008.

Before 1990 these rankings were only used to determine the number of berths in the UEFA Cup. In the first years of the UEFA Cup, and before 1971 in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, teams were invited to participate. This archive contains the calculated country rankings for all previous years.\n\nThe team rankings are used for the seeding of draws. From 1994 until 1998 only for the seeding of draws in the UEFA Cup. It is unknown whether these coefficients had any meaning before that time. This archive contains the calculated team rankings for all previous years.\n\nIn 2012 the results of the matches of Trabzonspor in the qualifying round are not counted towards the country coefficient of Turkey, although those results were included in the coefficient calculation of their opponents associations (Portugal and Spain). Just before the group stage draw the Turkish champion FenerbahÃ§e was withdrawn by the Turkish association, and replaced by Trabzonspor who already played in the Champions League and Europa League qualification rounds. Though FenerbahÃ§e did not play they were included in the total number of teams for Turkey in the coefficient calculation.\n\nIn 2008 and 2009 the 3 points obtained by Amica Wronki in 2004/05 are used for the calculation of the team ranking of Lech Poznan which merged with Amica Wronki in May 2006.\n\nIn 1998/99 the UEFA Cup, 2nd Round 2nd leg match between Fiorentina and Grasshopper was abandoned. The match was awarded 3-0 to Grasshopper, but this result is not included in the rankings.\n\nIn 1995 AC Milan got two points deducted due to crowd trouble. UEFA used this penalty only for the rankings of 1995. Subtract 0.286 from the country ranking of Italy in 1995 as a correction.\n\nRankings of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and East Germany are given until 1992, and the ranking of Czechoslovakia until 1993. The new associations evolved from these countries started without a ranking history, except for Russia. The 5-year ranking of Russia from 1993 until 1996 contains the results of the Russian teams that participated from 1989 until 1992 as teams of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe country coefficients in this archive include the result of the UEFA Cup 89/90 qualification matches between AJ Auxerre (France) and Dinamo Zagreb (Yugoslavia). The original rankings published by UEFA included these matches for the rankings of 1992 and 1993, but excluded the matches for the rankings of 1990, 1991, and 1994. In order to obtain the rankings published by UEFA subtract 0.4 for France, and add 0.5 for Yugoslavia in 1990, 1991, and 1994.\n\nIn 1987/88 the 2nd leg walkover of Benfica (Portugal) against Partizani Tirana (Albania) is not included in the rankings. However, UEFA did include it in 1992, but not in the 1988-1991 rankings. Add 0.333 to the country ranking of Portugal in 1992 to correct for this.\n\nIn 1975/76 Lazio Roma refused to play the 1st leg at home because of possible political demonstrations against Spain. UEFA awarded the match 3-0 to Barcelona, but this result is not included in the rankings."
