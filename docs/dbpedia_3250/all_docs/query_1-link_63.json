        "text": "Ole Miss' final piece for its 2024-25 men's basketball roster was arguably the biggest one.\n\nToward the end of May, veteran guard Matthew Murrell chose to put his pro aspirations on pause a second time to play his fifth and final season in Oxford.\n\nAfter the first time going through the NBA Draft process, Murrell wowed pro scouts with his athleticism and offensive prowess. However, some of the feedback he received was centered around validating said scoring ability in game action and efficiently. He delivered, playing under then first-year head coach Chris Beard.\n\nMurrell had by far the most efficient season of his Ole Miss career. He shot 46 percent from the floor, a full 10 percent higher than his junior season total. He also led the Rebels with an impressive 16.2 points per game. He surpassed the 1,000 career point plateau in the process and earned Second Team All-SEC honors as well by season's end. He was also in the running for the Howell Trophy.\n\nThe improvement made the inevitable pro decision that followed even tougher.\n\n\"I don't think people understand what the narrative was,\" Beard said. \"Matt had a real decision. It wasn't like Matt went through the NBA process and didn't do well. It was quite the opposite. It went really well, with the amount of phone calls we were getting and the opportunities he was presented... It was a basketball decision, and we supported it. I said it before, we would've supported whatever he chose. I wanted him to go through the process and get the information and do it the right way. He did. Period.\"\n\nMatt took a couple days to rest his body and went right back to work, both on and off the field. He took some basketball managers out for dinner one night, spent some time with an incoming freshman and hit the court running, figuratively and literally.\n\n\"Individually, he's just got to continue his journey, in terms of valuing what that stat sheet says. Matt can be a mid 40 percent three-point shooter. This summer, he's made half his shots in practice, which is hard to do as a scorer. He has his assist-to-turnover in a good place, but just continuing that journey,\" Beard said.\n\nContinuity will obviously have to play a role in his last dance, but defense has to be in the details this time around according to his head coach.\n\n\"Encouraging him to take great priority in the defensive side of the ball too,\" Beard said. \"I think Matt is an All-SEC defender. When I had to vote for those guys back in the spring, I just thought of Matt. He's got positional size, can guard the ball, can't post him up. He gets steals defensively, deflections, vertical jumps, but I think the stat sheet has to show that at some point too. When the coaches vote for All-SEC defense, the things everyone does is look at the stat sheet.\n\n\"What does that mean for Matt? My expectations, and I shared this plan with Matt, is for him to be the best defensive rebounding guard in the conference. If he can get to five or six defensive rebounds per game, always a great thing for us for being an automatic fast break when Matt pulls a clean defensive rebound. Matt had a great summer in that regard, just anticipation, being in the right position and having the courage to go make plays with his athleticism. Rim protection too. When people think of that, they think about the big guys. But in basketball, there's so many times that a guard has to be a rim protector too. Matt has the ability to wall-up with his size, vertical jump to block.\"\n\nThe Rebels will tip off the 2024-25 season on Nov. 4. Inside the Rebels will provide updates, notes, facts, observations and more."
