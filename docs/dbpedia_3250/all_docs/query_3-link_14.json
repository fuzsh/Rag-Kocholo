        "text": "On Tuesday, the UEFA Executive Committee announced that the Swiss Football Association will host the 2025 Euro tournament. The tournament will take place in eight cities across Switzerland in June and July of 2025. Switzerland beat out Poland, France, and a joint bid from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland for hosting rights.\n\nHost venues\n\nAll the 2025 Euro matches will take place in the following venues:\n\nBasel: St. Jakob-Park\n\nBern: Stadion Wankdorf\n\nGeneva: Stade de Genève\n\nLucerne: Luzern Arena\n\nSion: Stade de Tourbillon\n\nSt. Gallen: Stadion St. Gallen\n\nThun: Stockhorn Arena\n\nZürich: Stadion Letzigrund\n\nDuring the group stages, the venues will be split into four pairs, and each group will be assigned to a pair. This is to limit the travel time that teams, personnel, and fans will need to travel around during the early stages of competition. There is no word on which venue will host the championship match yet.\n\nSwitzerland’s past Euro experience\n\nThe Swiss national team automatically qualifies for the 2025 Euro as the host nation. This will be their third appearance in a European Championship. The Swiss qualified for a Euro tournament for the first time in 2017 and appeared in the most recent Euro in 2022. In both tournaments, they were eliminated in the group stages. Playing in front of a home crowd may give Switzerland the boost they need to advance to the knockout stages in 2025. In the meantime, the Swiss team will be playing in the upcoming World Cup so that fans can get an early glimpse of the host team’s play.\n\nWhich other European teams are you hoping to see in the 2025 Euro tournament? Do you think Switzerland will finally make it past the group stages in 2025? Let me know in the comments below. Tune into Paramount+ for the 2023 NWSL season.
