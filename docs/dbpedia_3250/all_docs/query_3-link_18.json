        "text": "The 2024 World Rowing Cup II is set to be staged from 24 to 26 May on the iconic Rotsee in Lucerne, Switzerland. A total of 234 crews from 43 nations will compete in 23 boat classes, in the hopes of earning points that will contribute to their countries overall standing in the series.\n\nThe men’s single sculls has 29 entries, with World Rowing Cup leader Oliver Zeidler being the standout name. Zeidler completed the World Rowing Cup hat-trick last year – winning all three World Rowing Cup events in the same boat class in the same year – and seems well on his way to repeat on his performance. He will face tough competition, with the likes of Simon Van Dorp of the Netherlands, Stefanos Ntouskos of Greece, Tom Mackintosh of New Zealand, and Sverri Nielsen of Denmark.\n\nThe men’s double sculls will see the return of the reigning Olympic Champions of France, Matthieu Androdias and Hugo Boucheron, for their first international race together again time since last year’s European Rowing Championships – a good marker two months ahead of the Olympics on home waters, especially facing the reigning World Champions of the Netherlands, Stef Broenink and Melvin Twellaar.\n\nThe women’s single sculls will see five out of the six women in last year’s A-Final at the World Rowing Championships racing. While Karolien Florijn of the Netherlands still hasn’t lost a race in two years, she will face tough competition with the reigning Olympic Champion, Emma Twigg of New Zealand, but also World medallist Tara Rigney of Australia, and former Lucerne World Cup winner, Alexandra Foester of Germany.\n\nThe women’s double sculls will see Norway’s surprise European gold medallists, Thea Helseth and Inga Marie Kavlie, looking to test themselves against a wider field that includes boats from Lithuania and the USA that medalled at last years’ World Rowing Championships.\n\nFor the first-time ever, Para-Rowing will be contested at a World Rowing Cup in Lucerne. The top names in the sport – Birgit Skartstein and Moran Samuel in the PR1 women’s single, Roman Polianskyi and Giacomo Perini in the PR1 men’s single, or the Dutch, Irish, and Polish combinations in the PR2 mixed double sculls are set to compete for the first time on the Rotsee.\n\nThe 2024 World Rowing Cup II will be the first time seeing USA, Canada, New Zealand, as well as many South American and Asian countries racing internationally this season – and perhaps the only time before the Olympic and Paralympic Games later this summer in Paris. The USA has entered both men and women’s eights, their men’s eight hoping to qualify for the Games at the Final Olympic and Paralympic Qualification Regatta just days prior to the 2024 World Rowing Cup II.\n\nThe Netherlands are currently in the lead of the 2024 World Rowing Cup points, with 68. They are followed by Great Britain with 63, and Italy with 58."
