        "text": "European Cup\n\nThe European Cup (also known as the European Champion Clubs' Cup) was established in 1955, inspired by the South American Championship of Champions, the South American tournament for club teams. It could also be seen as an expanded version of the Mitropa Cup, that had existed in Europe for a long time but only included clubs from Central and East Europe. The European Cup would include winners of national domestic leagues from all over Europe. These clubs would compete in a knock-out tournament with two-legged home and away ties. It would become the most prestigious club tournament for clubs in Europe until 1991 when the tournament was replaced by the Champions League.\n\nWinners and runners-up\n\nAll the winners and runners-up through the years of the European Cup.\n\nSeason Winner Runner-up 1990-1991 Red Star Belgrade Olympique Marseille 1989-1990 Milan Benfica 1988-1989 Milan Steaua Bucuresti 1987-1988 PSV Eindhoven Benfica 1986-1987 Porto Bayern Munich 1985-1986 Steaua Bucuresti Barcelona 1984-1985 Juventus Liverpool 1983-1984 Liverpool Roma 1982-1983 Hamburger Juventus 1981-1982 Aston Villa Bayern Munich 1980-1981 Liverpool Real Madrid 1979-1980 Nottingham Forest Hamburger SV 1978-1979 Nottingham Forest MalmÃ¶ FF 1977-1978 Liverpool FC Brugge 1976-1977 Liverpool Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach 1975-1976 Bayern Munish Saint Etienne 1974-1975 Bayern Munich Leeds United 1973-1974 Bayern Munich AtlÃ©tico Madrid 1972-1973 Ajax Juventus 1971-1972 Ajax Internazionale 1970-1971 Ajax Panathinaikos 1969-1970 Feyenoord Celtic 1968-1969 Milan Ajax 1967-1968 Manchester United Benfica 1966-1967 Celtic Internazionale 1965-1966 Real Madrid Partizan Belgrade 1964-1965 Internazionale Benfica 1963-1964 Internazionale Real Madrid 1962-1963 Milan Benfica 1961-1962 Benfica Real Madrid 1960-1961 Benfica Barcelona 1959-1960 Real Madrid Eintracht Frankfurt 1958-1959 Real Madrid Stade de Reims 1957-1958 Real Madrid Milan 1956-1957 Real Madrid Fiorentina 1955-1956 Real Madrid Stade de Reims\n\nHistory\n\nThe biggest European tournament for football clubs began in 1955. In the first edition 16 teams would partake and in the final at Parc des Princes in Paris, Real Madrid beat Stade de Reims by 4 goals to 3.\n\nThe very next year the tournament would be expanded to include 22 teams. In the following years the numbers of participating teams continued to grow until it reached 32 teams, which was ideal for playing five rounds (Round of 32, Round of 16, Quarter-finals, Semi-finals and Final). Some years included 33 teams, which resulted in a Preliminary round between two teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStatistics\n\nIf the Champions League is excluded and only titles between 1955-56 and 1990-91 are counted, these clubs have won the most titles:\n\nTable 2.
