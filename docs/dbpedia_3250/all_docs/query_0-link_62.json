        "text": "THE BEGINNING\n\nDefIce and Zed belonged to the first generation of Breakers in Berne (Switzerland), both started to dance in ’83. Their first crew was called City Rockers. Between ’83 and ’86 they were the only Breakers in Berne who seriously practiced day after day. That’s why they joined a crew from another city (Biel-Bienne / Switzerland) called Jazzy Rockers.\n\nBut in ’86 DefIce finally wanted to have a crew in “his” town who could show all others that also Berne had good Breakers. He founded The Spartanic Rockers together with Zack, Action and Butch. But soon after (end of ’86) they split up again and The Spartanic Rockers consisted of DefIce and of a new member: Monty.\n\nSome month later The Spartanic Rockers was completed by Baze. Because of professional reasons DefIce left the crew in ’89 and joined sometimes another Swiss Breaking Crew called Crazy Force Crew from Lucerne (Switzerland). Between ’89 and ’92 the members of The Spartanic Rockers were Monty, Baze and Zed (who joined the crew sometimes for shows and contests).\n\nIn ’90 DefIce took part in the “Battle Of The Year” together with Crazy Force Crew and Zed took part in the same contest together with 2 dancers from Zurich (Switzerland) called Frank & Power. In ’91, after spending several month in the UK and practicing with them, Zed became a member of the English Breaking crew Second 2 None. In the same year Zed won also the Swiss-Championship in Breaking and Monty won the European-Championship in Breaking.\n\nIn ’92 Zed stopped dancing because of a motorcycle accident and because of traveling around the world. In the same year Jamez who started to dance in ’88, who was in crews like Union Rockers, First High Society and Bern City Breakers and who took part in the “Battle Of The Year 92” with the crew Rock’t Better came to The Spartanic Rockers and after him in ’93 also Remy who started to dance in ’89 and who was in crews like Double Crush Rockers and Freeztyle Rockers.\n\nIn ’95 Baze stopped to dance totally and Jamez partly. In the same year Monty and Remy won the Swiss-Crew-Championship in Breaking. In ’97 Monty and Remy took part in the “Battle Of The Year 97” together with Crazy, Magic and Mike of the Crazy Force Crew. In the same year Zed started to dance seriously again and joined The Spartanic Rockers again.\n\nGOING INTERNATIONAL\n\nIn 1997 The Spartanic Rockers got new members from Japan after getting known them via the World Wide Web one year before.\n\nThe first meet up was at the 20th RSC Anniversary in NYC (USA).

But only by 2 there was no possibility to qualify for the final battles. During the same time Jamez started to practice again seriously. Some weeks later The Spartanic Rockers was completed with Jo (former member of the Japanese Breaking crew Freez) and Go (member of the Japanese Popping Crew 3D Connection and originally from Osaka).\n\nIn autumn ’98 Takeo, Hiro, Tsuyoshi, Go and Jo took part in the “UK Break-Championship 98” and they won the final battle against Style Elements (USA)!
