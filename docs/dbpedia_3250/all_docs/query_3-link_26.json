        "text": "2 August 2023\n\nBy Tim Koch\n\nTim Koch goes from Henley to Switzerland, changing at Twyford.\n\nAlthough the remark was not aimed at me in particular, a few months ago I was told, “You cannot consider yourself a rowing journalist until you have been to Lucerne.” My response was straight out of a cowboy saloon in the Old West: “That’s fighting talk mister.” Long story short, three days after the end of Henley I was having a beer on the edge of Lake Lucerne with veteran rowing journalist, writer and historian Chris Dodd, my guide for the duration.\n\nThe Rowing World Cup is organised by the sport’s international governing body, World Rowing (formerly FISA) and it acts as a lead-up to the World Rowing Championships. Racing at the World Cup includes the 14 Olympic boat classes and a selection of international boat classes. It began in 1997 and is comprised of three regattas held throughout early summer, usually in Europe. In each event, points are awarded to the top seven finishing boats and an overall winner is determined after the last regatta of the year.\n\nThe 2023 World Cup III is the first World Rowing event to which I have had press accreditation, but my intention was not to produce specific reports on this important part of the international rowing calendar. Rachel Quarrell has done this far better than I could do and her daily dispatches are on the wonderful Row360.\n\nIn my three articles, the aim is simply to give a visual impression of this historic and beautiful rowing venue and the atmosphere of an international rowing competition held almost exactly one year before the Paris 2024 Olympic Regatta. In most cases, I have not attempted to identify the people or the races pictured, my intention is to let the images speak for themselves. However, decent photography was difficult as the temperature was in the 30s and the bright light on the water produced high contrast shots and burnt-out highlights.\n\nWarming up and cooling down\n\nSome Qualifiers, Heats and Semis\n\nA short video introduction to Lucerne and World Cup III is on World Rowing’s YouTube Channel.\n\nPart II will be The view from the start, Part III will be Finals Day."
