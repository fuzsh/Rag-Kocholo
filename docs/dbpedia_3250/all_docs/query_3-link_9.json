        "text": "Switzerland will host the 2025 Women's European Championship, European football's governing body UEFA said on Tuesday.\n\nSwitzerland last hosted a major tournament in 2008, staging that year's edition of the men's Euros along with neighbours Austria.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\n\n\"This is a historic day for Switzerland, the SFA and women's football,\" Swiss FA president Dominique Blanc said in a statement.\n\n\"This major step will shape the development of women's football at all levels.\"\n\nThe Swiss FA said it would set up a body responsible for the organisation of the event, adding that the \"first workshops and visits to the venues with UEFA are already planned for April and May\".\n\n\"The tournament will take place over four weeks in June and July 2025 at the planned venues of Basel, Bern, Geneva, Zurich, St. Gallen, Sion, Lucerne and Thun,\" the Swiss FA said.\n\n\"The existing infrastructure will be used [or, as in the case of the turf base in Thun and Berne, modified] and the construction of additional stadiums, hotels or training grounds is not necessary according to the current state of knowledge.\"\n\nIn October, UEFA said it had received four bids to host the tournament, including bids from France and Poland as well as a joint bid from Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.\n\nThe Nordic bid provided the strongest competition to Switzerland, making it to the UEFA Executive Committee's final round of voting, where it received four votes to Switzerland's nine.\n\n\"We believe we submitted a good application with a clear plan on how to create the best Euros ever,\" Norwegian Football Federation president Lise Klaveness said.\n\n\"We always knew that the competition would be tough, and we can only congratulate Switzerland who came away with the victory.\"\n\nUkraine had also expressed interest in hosting the event before the Russian invasion.\n\nThe previous edition of the tournament was held in England in 2022, where the hosts won the title after beating Germany in the final at Wembley Stadium.\n\nLast year's tournament, which was postponed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, had a projected global cumulative live viewership of 365 million, while a record crowd of 87,192 were at Wembley for the final.\n\nCurrently, the largest stadium is Basel's St. Jakob Park, with a capacity of around 38,000. However, speaking on Tuesday, England's Euro 2022 winner Lauren Hemp said the tournament still promised to be a major success for the women's game.\n\n\"It will always be hard to top a home Euros in front of a packed out Wembley stadium, obviously winning it as well against Germany. Looking forward to the future, yeah, it might hold 38,000 but there's still gonna be so many fans that will be there and hopefully it will be packed out and so many people watching from back home,\" she told reporters.\n\n\"The women's game is growing so much that it will be on so many people's TV screens and advertised so much that it will still be an incredible experience. I'm really looking forward to the next few years with England because there's so much to look forward to. Being in Switzerland will be a different experience. It's something to look forward to as players.\"\n\nGermany are the most successful team in the history of the competition, having lifted the title on eight occasions."
