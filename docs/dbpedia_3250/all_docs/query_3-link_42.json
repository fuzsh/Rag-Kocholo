        "text": "By Rupert Guinness with the Australian Rowing Team in Europe\n\nThe Australian Rowing Team (ART) will get a crucial gauge of form for its Olympic and Paralympic Games preparation when it races 13 boats in World Cup II at Lucerne, Switzerland, from Friday to Sunday.\n\nThe team has qualified nine boats for the Olympic Games and three in the Paralympic Games in Paris. Against a crack international field, World Cup II will provide the ART with a clear idea of where its crews stand against the best in the world, and where they must improve.\n\nRowing Australia High Performance Director Paul Thompson has cast his eye over the progress of each Australian boat and crew that will be racing, providing an insight what we might be able to expect from them in the coming days.\n\nWOMEN’S SQUAD\n\nWomen’s Pair\n\nCrew #1: Jessica Morrison OAM, Annabelle McIntyre OAM\n\nCoach: John Keogh (Women’s Head Coach).\n\nPaul Thompson: “I'm so excited to see how this Pair will go. They won all but one race last year – the World Championships, where they took Silver. They are fast. Last year they rowed an unofficial world's best time (6:47.11 at Holland Beker Regatta in Amsterdam). They are coming into a full-strength field this year; and we know how strong they are and how well they work with their coach John Keogh assisted by Hally Chapman.”\n\nCrew #2: Olympia Aldersey, Lily Alton Triggs\n\nCoach: Hally Chapman\n\nPaul Thompson: “They were in the Eight last year. They are mentally so good, and experienced athletes who can go fast as a pair. It's great to have such world class athletes in the World Cup team as Spares backing up the selected boats.”\n\nWomen’s Four\n\nCrew: Eliza Gaffney, Jean Mitchell, Jacqueline Swick, Molly Goodman\n\nCoach: Tom Westgarth\n\nPaul Thompson: “A new look women's Four … it will be exciting to see how far they go. We've got Eliza and Jean back into the Australian team through some great domestic performances. And we have the experience of Molly, and ‘Jackie’ is a great talent. There's no reason why this Four can't do really well with Tom guiding it.”\n\nWomen’s Coxed Eight\n\nCrew: Katrina Werry, Lucy Stephan OAM, Samantha Morton, Georgina Rowe, Sarah Hawe, Georgia Patten, Bronwyn Cox, Paige Barr, Hayley Verbunt (coxswain)\n\nCoach: John Keogh, Hally Chapman\n\nPaul Thompson: “You can just see the quality of their rhythm and the quality of their rowing when they get it right. The Eight, World Championship Bronze Medallists last year, is looking really strong. There is some fabulous experience and physicality in the boat to really take the race on. This will be a really exciting boat to follow through its journey to Paris.”\n\nWomen’s Single Scull\n\nSculler: Tara Rigney\n\nCoach: Ellen Randell\n\nPaul Thompson: “Tara is Tara … every time she gets out on the water in a Single Scull she produces a great performance. She has such wonderful feel and determination. A World Championship Bronze Medallist in 2022 and last year, she is a really classy athlete, and she is all class in an already really strong field. It’s tough but so is Tara.”\n\nWomen’s Double Scull\n\nCrew: Amanda Bateman, Harriet Hudson\n\nCoach: Ellen Randell\n\nPaul Thompson: “This crew has matched up really well and shown they have some fabulous speed under Ellen’s watchful eye. The World Champion Romanians are not here, but they were beaten in the European Championships by winners Norway and Lithuania. So, it’s quite open. Amanda and Harriet have got the capability to really step into that space.”\n\nWomen’s Quad Scull\n\nCrew: Rowena Meredith, Caitlin Cronin, Laura Gourley, Kathryn Rowan\n\nCoach: Tom Westgarth\n\nPaul Thompson: “We've got a strong core of 2021 Olympic Bronze Medallists in this Quad Scull with Rowena and Caitlin who were in the boat last year as was Kathryn, then coming into the boat we have Laura. Let's see how they go. There's no reason why they can't be very competitive.”\n\nMEN’S SQUAD\n\nMen’s Coxed Eight\n\nCrew: Ben Canham, Josh Hicks, Spencer Turrin OAM, Alexander Purnell OAM, Jack Hargreaves OAM, Jack O’Brien, Angus Dawson, Angus Widdicombe, Kendall Brodie (Coxswain),\n\nCoach: Mark Prater.\n\nPaul Thompson: “Our Eight is a very good crew and move well together with consistent medal performances over this Olympiad, including a World Cup win in Lucerne last year. This is the Eight’s first international test against the best since last year’s World Championships where they won the Bronze Medal. We should be confident in the preparation that coach Mark Prater has given them. They've all got pedigree and are really experienced racers with a good feel for the boat.”\n\nMen’s Coxless Four\n\nCrew: Tim Masters, Fergus Hamilton, Jack Robertson, Alex Hill OAM\n\nCoach: Lyall McCarthy\n\nPaul Thompson: “This is another really exciting boat with Alex Hill from the 2021 Olympic Gold Medal winning Four offering great insights, Jack and Tim from last year’s medal winning Eight and ‘Ferg’ coming in from the Pair. They’re evolving very well as a crew under the enthusiastic eye of Lyall McCarthy. They have worked hard to be all on the same page. There is really something exciting about them.”\n\nMen’s Coxless Pair\n\nCrew #1: Patrick Holt, Simon Keenan\n\nCoach: Rhett Ayliffe\n\nPaul Thompson: “Simon and Patty are a pretty handy crew. They are matched up well, get on well together and are keen to learn and explore their speed. Simon is starting to row with some real rhythm, which is great and Patty is enabling him to do that. They are very strong athletes and a strong crew.”\n\nCrew #2: Rohan Lavery, Jackson Kench\n\nCoach: Rhett Ayliffe\n\nPaul Thompson: “Rohan and Jackson have been in the Eight over the years and are World Championship medallists. They've done a fabulous job as Spares. They are a couple of really talented athletes. So, there is no reason why they can't be hunting down some big crews as well.”\n\nPARA ROWING SQUAD\n\nMen’s PR1 Single Scull\n\nCrew: Erik Horrie OAM\n\nCoach: Chad King\n\nPaul Thompson: “It's great that Lucerne is putting on Para events. It’s a fabulous opportunity that Erik, a five-times World Champion and three-time Paralympic medallist, can race here on the ‘Lake of the Gods’. We know he's worked really hard. He had an unfortunate injury at the World Championships last year and is keen to show his form. He's one of the most experienced Para rowers in the world. He knows how to race. It will be great to see him put that together.”\n\nPR3 Men’s Pair\n\nCrew: Nicholas Bartlett, Tobiah Goffsassen\n\nCoaches: Chad King\n\nPaul Thompson: “The PR3 Men's Pair entry is part of the classification process for Nicholas. So, we've got Toby and Nick racing a Ukrainian crew. This will be their first international race and World Cup. I'm really looking forward to seeing how well they do.”\n\nWHAT’S UP FOR AUSTRALIA – World Cup II Day 1: Friday\n\n9.20AM (5.20PM AEST) – PR1 Men’s Single Scull Heat 1: Erik Horrie – First two to the A-Final.
