        "text": "STEUBENVILLE — Catholic Central High School will honor five former star athletes, two outstanding coaches and a distinguished alumnus at the 2024 Hall of Fame Dinner and Award Ceremony.\n\nAthletes honored will include Edward “Corky” Laman, a 1967 graduate; John Fornsaglio, a 1979 graduate; Mary Gilloon Hartman, a 2003 graduate; Zack Hawrot, a 2006 graduate; and Brenton Coldabella, a 2014 graduate. The coaches being enshrined are John Nese and Clyde DiAngelo, two excellent educators and exceptional coaches. John Buccigross of ESPN fame, and a former Crusader athlete, will receive the Lifetime Achievement award and be the guest speaker.\n\nThe dinner and induction ceremony will take place Sept. 19 at Catholic Central High School. Festivities will begin at 5:30 p.m. with dinner being served at 6 p.m., and the award ceremony will begin at 7 p.m. Dinner reservations costing $25 can be made by contacting Alisha Teramana at the school.\n\nThe award ceremony is open to the public free of charge.\n\nFollowing is a synopsis of each of their accomplishments:\n\n• John Buccigross, Lifetime Achievement Award: Buccigross graduated from Catholic Central in 1984. A CCHS letterman in basketball, baseball and golf, his love of sports was boundless. He was on Central’s freshman basketball team that lost every game. Three years later, the senior class won the district championship.\n\nAfter graduation, Buccigross attended Heidelberg University in Tiffin, graduating in 1988. Originally recruited to play basketball, Buccigross played his final two years on the Heidelberg golf team.\n\nSince Buccigross first got cable and ESPN in his Steubenville home in 1981 his dream was to work as an ESPN “Sportscenter” anchorman. Fifteen years later that dream came true. After five years working at a small news operation on Cape Cod in Massachusetts and two years in Providence, R.I., Buccigross was hired at ESPN on Sept. 28, 1996. In his 28 years at ESPN he has done a little of everything (ESPN Radio, a hockey column on ESPN.Com from 2002-2017, authored a book with former NHL player Keith Jones to name just a few) but mostly “Sportscenter,” which he continues to do during the summer months.\n\nFor the past three NHL seasons, Buccigross has been part of ESPN and ABC’s coverage of the NHL as a play-by-play broadcaster and a studio host. Additionally, he’s called the last 11 Men’s NCAA Hockey Tournaments, including the frozen Four and Championship games.\n\n• Coach John Carmen Nese: During his years of coaching boys and girls basketball and baseball, Nese might have won more games than any coach in Central history. During his Central career he coached boys basketball 1963-1973, baseball from 1963-1975 and girls basketball from 1987-1990 and compiled an overall record of 373 wins and 174 losses. Nese captured 12 sectional, eight district, one regional and four OVAC titles during his coaching career. Probably the highlight of his career was the 1965 baseball season when his team finished runner-up in the state baseball tournament. The 1965 baseball team is legendary and was one of Central’s greatest teams.\n\nNese is a member of the District 5 Basketball Association Hall of Fame, the Ohio Valley Athletic Conference Hall of Fame and the Ohio High School Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame. Nese also served as co-coach of the U.S. All-Stars in the Dapper Dan Roundball Classic in 1973. Nese was named Eastern District and District 5 Girls Basketball Coach of the year in 1987-1988 and 1988-1989.\n\nNese died in 2017.\n\n• Coach Clyde DiAngelo: DiAngelo is widely respected as an educator and coach within the CCHS community and the entire Ohio Valley. Having coached basketball, baseball, track and football, DiAngelo has the most career boys basketball wins in CCHS history with an overall record of 123-99. Maybe just as impressive, DiAngelo was also a highly successful baseball coach during a six-year span including a run to the Ohio State final four in 1985.\n\nDuring his tenure as head basketball coach, DiAngelo’s teams were OVAC AAA champions in 1979 and 1984, Eastern Buckeye League champions in 1989, sectional champions in 1979, 1982, 1984, 1985 and 1990 and district champions in 1984. During his six years as head baseball coach, DiAngelo compiled an overall record of 97-49. His teams won OVAC championships in 1984, 1985 and 1986; Eastern Buckeye League championships in 1983, 1985 and 1986; and sectional, district and regional champions in 1985, making the Ohio State final four.\n\nDiAngelo has received a number of coaching awards and honors. Recently, he was awarded the Earl Haberfield OVAC Boys Coaches Award and in 2015 the Franciscan University of Steubenville Baron Club Award. Others include being named District 5 AA Basketball Coach of the Year in 1979 and 1984, District 5 Division III Basketball Coach of the Year 1989, District 5 Division All-Star Game Coach 1982 and 1984 and OVAC Basketball All-Star Classic Coach 1984 and 1989.\n\nDiAngelo served as head track coach for four years (1975-1979) and as an assistant football coach (1975-1978.)\n\n• Ed “Corky” Laman: Laman, a 1967 graduate of CCHS, was a two-sport athlete at Central, lettering two years in football and track. However, football is where he excelled, being a two-way star at offensive guard and defensive tackle. Laman was voted team MVP by his coaches and teammates and second-team all-state for the Crusaders, who finished the season with a 6-3-1 record, losing only to Ohio ranked No. 2 Niles McKinley, No. 3 Steubenville Big Red and No. 10 East Liverpool. Laman also was named first-team Eastern District and OVAC special mention.\n\nLaman was described by teammates as athletic, quick off the ball and extremely strong. They were qualities that he put to good use on the offensive and defensive line.\n\nLaman was also a valuable member of the track and field team as a discus and shot participant.\n\nLaman attended Kansas State University and was a defensive lineman for the Wildcats.\n\n• John Fornsaglio: John Fornsaglio, a 1979 graduate of Central, was a member of the basketball, track and field, and golf teams at CCHS, lettering two-years in each sport. Basketball, however, is where he excelled.\n\nAs a senior, Fornsaglio was team captain, named third team all-state and first-team team Eastern District as the 1978-1979 basketball team finished with a 17-5 record and a district runner-up finish. He also was named All-OVAC and captain of the team and played in the District 5 All-Star game. Fornsaglio led his team in scoring with 18.5 points per game and averaged 13 rebounds per game. As a junior, Fornsaglio was his team’s second leading scorer with 13.9 points per game and top rebounder at 10.7 rebounds per game.\n\nAccording to DiAngelo, his coach at Central, Fornsaglio was a versatile player, being a strong force on the boards and also possessing a soft touch from the outside.\n\nFornsaglio was also an important piece of the 1979 Crusader golf team that was OVAC AAA runner-ups.\n\n• Zach Hawrot: Hawrot, a 2006 graduate of Catholic Central High School, is one of the most decorated athletes in Catholic Central history and clearly one of the best. Hawrot excelled in football and baseball earning a total of seven varsity letters, but is best remembered as Centrals all-time leading rusher with more than 3,000 yards.\n\nIn 2005 his senior season, Hawrot rushed for more than 1,878 yards on 300 carries and led his team into the Ohio Division 6 championship game. For his efforts, he was named first-team all-state and was first-time Eastern District and offensive player of the year; first team OVAC and tri-captain of the All-Valley Team.\n\nThe highlight of Hawrot’s senior season was Central’s state semi-final game against Newark Catholic, when he carried the ball 22 times for 205 yards while leading the Crusaders to a 36-35 victory. As a junior, Hawrot was almost as good, rushing for 1,273 yards. He was named second-team all-state; first team Eastern District, OVAC and all-valley; and was named the Herald-Star Breakout Player of the Year.\n\nAs a running back, Hawrot had the unique ability to find the open hole, accelerate through it, make one cut and run north and south. Hawrot was an excellent defensive catcher and fine hitter on Frank Spence’s baseball team.\n\n• Mary Gilloon Hartman: Gilloon Hartman, a 2003 graduate, earned 10 varsity letters, four in basketball, four in track and two in soccer, while participating in sports at Catholic Central. Hartman did not just participate, she excelled in each of these sports.\n\nIn basketball, Hartman is one of Central’s all-time leading scorers and rebounders. For her career, Hartman scored 874 points, but, more important, Hartman was an all-around team player and leader. In 2000-2001, as a sophomore, Hartman was named to the District 5 Division 3 All-Star team second team and second team All-OVAC. As a junior, Hartman was named to the District 5, Division 3 second team. Hartman had a great senior season, being named to the all-conference OVAC basketball team; first team-District Five, Division 3 All-Star Team; and was a participant in the OVAC All-Star Game.\n\nHartman’s track career is even more impressive. As a freshman, and part of Central’s OVAC championship team, Hartman finished second in the OVAC 800, 1600 and 3200 runs. Hartman’s track career reached a climax in her senior year as she led the Central girls track team to the OVAC team championship, winning the 800 and 1600 runs as well as being a member of the 4×400 and 4×800 winning relay teams. Hartman proceeded to win the regional championship in the 1600 as well as qualifying as part of 4×400 and 4×800 relay teams. Hartman’s track career culminated with a sixth-place finish in the 1600 at the Ohio state track meet.\n\nHartman broke the school record in the 800 and 1600 runs, and was named academic All-Ohio in her senior year. She was a two-year letter winner in soccer as a freshman and sophomore.\n\nHartman went on to a successful college career in basketball and track at John Carroll University.\n\n• Brenton Colabella: Colabella, a 2014 graduate, earned 12 varsity letters, four each in football, basketball and baseball, while at Catholic Central. That, in itself, would make Colabella a school hall of famer, but it is really a small part of the story. Colabella was a first-team all-state quarterback and a second-team all-state baseball player. Colabella’s basketball coach said this about Colabella in a letter of support for his nomination: “As a four-year letterman for the Crusaders basketball team, it was almost as if his presence was larger than life. He was a fiery, competitive, dedicated player and these traits carried over to his teammates. “\n\nColabella may be the most prolific quarterback in Central history, with 7,608 yards passing, 82 touchdown passes and four years of leading the Crusader offense. During his career, the Crusaders went from a one-win team in his freshman year to a 9-3 playoff team and an opening-round win in the playoffs. As a senior, in addition to being first-team all-state, Colabella was first-team all-OVAC, captain of the Ohio OVAC all-star team, first-team Eastern District and Division 7 Offensive Player of the Year; and first-team and captain of the All-Valley team. Colabella was named third-team all-state as a junior.\n\nColabella also was a big part of Central’s baseball and basketball success during his four years at the school. On the baseball diamond, Colabella was a slick-fielding shortstop for most of his career with a career batting average of .453. As a senior, Colabella led the Crusaders to a 22-6 record, a sectional and district championship and a runner-up finish in the regional tournament. Colabella was named first-team Eastern District, first-team all-OVAC and second-team all-Ohio.\n\nColabella was a productive member of the basketball team as well, earning four varsity letters. Upon graduation, Colabella went on to a successful football career at West Liberty University."
