        "text": "They beat us at the WC, but we beat them in the semi-final of the Europe Cup in 1988 and in the quarterfinal for the Europe Cup in 1992.\n\nAC was better in europe, but you have to remember, in that days only the national champion went to the european cup. An Inter team of the Matthäus era would have played a good role in a championsleague that season they won the Uefa Cup.\n\nTo answer the question, wether the dutch at AC or the germans at milan had the bigger influence, I would say that the most influencial player of them was, when fit, Matthäus followed by v. Basten, then Gullit, Brehme, Klinsmann, Rijkaard.\n\nOver the longer stretch one has to consider the long injuries of Gullit and v. Basten.\n\nOf course Gullit and v. Basten were at times the best attacking midfielder and striker in europe, but in the end only a midfielder and a striker, very good ones but nothing innovative.\n\nThe real master of Milan was Baresi, more than any of the dutch players. He was the one that made the innovative back-line with either libero and area defending possible, and this new style was in the end what made the difference.\n\nAnd at Inter, Matthäus clearly was the special one, in a way defining the role modell for the modern day box-to-box power midfielder.\n\nSo the answer to the question should be: the german influence was bigger than the dutch, because Baresi was an italian.\n\nWe will never know but it could have been possible. At the same time, one must remember that Inter lost 2-1 on aggregate in the 1989-90 European Cup first round to Malmo.\n\nWhat are you talking about? Nothing innovative?\n\nI'm not sure on that but the 4-4-2 formation with the zonal defence was very influential. That influenced the demise of catenaccio in it's purest form.\n\n\"What are you talking about? Nothing innovative?\"\n\nPlaying libero in an areal defense system like Baresi did was new, innovative.\n\nPlaymaking with defensive duties - from box-to-box - with the dynamic strength of Matthäus runs was never seen before, innovative.\n\nGullit was an highclass attacking playmaker, but nothing new, you have seen many other midfielders play this role nd style before and after Gullit.\n\nV. Basten maybe was the deadliest scorer since Gerd Müller, but it was his scoring rate, his flair, not a new approach to the game or a new tactical positioning that made him special.\n\nthe dutchs havent beaten germany in wcq..both games ended in draws..0:0 in germany and 1:1 in netherland..van basten did score the equilizer very late in minute 87..jürgen kohler has leaved the field injured 13 minutes before...and kohler has defended van basten very well up to his injury.....the goal of van basten came not from a genius play...a not well timed shot of koeman came straight to van basten where scored straight out of this situation..\n\nits no crime point out addidtional information .\n\nmüller is my favorite player so i never could say tap ins are no good goals..positioning is a strenght too...i pointed out the goal came not from a genius play...and i did point out jürgen kohler has leaved the field injured and kohler pretty much did a great job against van basten before his injury...\n\nin international games only from time to time van basten was sharp or consistant in goalscoring...in reality van basten in his international career games wasnt a great constant goalscorer...judging 101 NT/European cup games...\n\nvan basten in 43 all european cup games has scored 29 goals...in 16 of his 43 games he did score goals..only a 37% ratio....4 of van bastens 29 goals was penaltys i think??.all 4 penaltys was scored in championscup games..van basten has scored 18 goals in 27 championscup games, in 17 of this 27 games he was held scoreless..in 3 of his 10 goalscoring championscup games he did score only penalty goals..van basten in his european cup carrer has two 4 goal games and one 5 goal game..13 goals scored in 3 games..in his other 40 european cup games he did score 16 goals..so in reality van basten has scored in 3 europeancup games 45% of his total europeancup goals....\n\nvan basten with the NT\n\n24 goals in 58 games..in 18 of his 58 NT games he did score goals. a 31% ratio...in 69 % of his games he was held scoreless...42 of his 58 games was competive wc/wcq+ec/ecq games..only in 12 of this 42 games van basten scored goals..a very decent 28,5% ratio..\n\nis this ok???\n\nI don´t agree. Almost all teams played with an number 10 playmaker in former times that had no defensive duties.\n\nMatthäus played like a combination 6, 8 and 10, that saved one midfield player. They could change in a single game between a 4-5-1, a 4-4-2 or even a 4-4-3, at anytime, just depending on Matthäus decision what would be best in the moment.\n\nIf I'd look it up, it might, but you can do that too.\n\nWhat is a genius play? Dribbling past four players? Volleying from the edge of the box? Or just being there faster than anyone else? A goal is a goal and last time I checked you don't get two points for a header and three for a volley.\n\nBozsik, Mackay, Edwards. That's three players from the 50s who played the same role as Matthaus.\n\nBack to the discussion at hand: Dutch Masters AC MILAN vs. German Legion INTER MILAN:Who was better?\n\nDuring late 80's/early 90's(1988-1992, when Brehme, Klinsmann, and Matthäus played for Inter):\n\nMilan: 1 Scudetto(league finishes:3rd, 2nd, 2nd, 1st), 2 European Cups(Record in the EC: 1989: Champion, 1990: Champion, 1991: Quarterfinals)\n\nInter: 1 Scudetto(league finishes: 1st, 4th, 2nd, 8th), 1 UEFA Cup\n\n(Record in the EC: 1990: First Round)\n\nNapoli: 1 Scudetto(league finishes: 2nd, 1st, 7th, 4th), 1 UEFA Cup\n\n(Record in the EC: 1991: Second Round)\n\nSamp: 1 Scudetto(league finishes: 5th, 5th, 1st, 6th), 1 Cup-Winners' Cup\n\n(Record in the EC: 1992: Runners'-up)\n\nAnd what is the conclusion? Inter weren't even the 2nd best team in Serie A during that time frame. Napoli and Samp could also match what Inter did in Serie A. Plus both won a European Trophy and performed better in the European Cup than Inter. So for how talented Inter's German players were they really didn't have anywhere near the impact of Milan's Dutch players."
