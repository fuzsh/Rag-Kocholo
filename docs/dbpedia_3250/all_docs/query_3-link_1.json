        "text": "LUCERNE, Switzerland â€” The Champions League final will be moved from its traditional Wednesday night slot and instead be held on a Saturday night, Michel Platini, the president of UEFA, announced Friday.\n\nThe decision was made at a meeting of UEFA's executive committee in Lucerne. The change will come into effect beginning with the 2009-10 season.\n\nThe European Cup final has traditionally been played in midweek since the competition began in 1955-56.\n\n\"I did not see many children or families in Athens because Wednesday is a school night,\" Platini said, referring to last season's final. \"Moving it to Saturday should make it more of a family occasion.\"\n\nThe committee also approved Platini's proposals to guarantee a greater share of places in the Champions League to countries from outside the top-ranking nations. But the top three nations, currently Spain, Italy and England, will have three automatic places in the group stage rather than two.\n\nPlatini said the changes were unanimously approved by the executive committee and should lead to a more democratic competition. \"There will be more champions in the group stage and there will be more democracy in the competition,\" he said.\n\nThird-place and fourth-place clubs from the big three countries have been almost assured of a qualifying place because they usually had to play teams from weaker countries.\n\nAs of 2009, however, the fourth-place team will be pitted against second-place teams from stronger countries such as the Netherlands or Portugal.\n\nThe UEFA Cup, Europe's second-tier club competition, was also overhauled to have 48 spots in the group phase, up from the current format of 40. The tournament will now have 12 groups of four teams each, where the top two in each group move on to the knockout rounds. The current format is comprised of eight groups of five."
