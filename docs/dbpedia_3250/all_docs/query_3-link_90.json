        "text": "The nation is commiserating alongside England’s Lionesses following their defeat at this year’s Women’s World Cup final.\n\nSpain triumphed over the England women’s team in Sydney after a first-half strike from Olga Carmona, drilling a sensational strike past Mary Earps.\n\nFollowing their 1-0 loss, fans and stars alike flooded the internet with words of praise and gratitude for the squad that kept them entertained throughout the course of the four weeks.\n\nWomen’s football is enjoying a surge of popularity across the globe having finally stepped out of the shadows of the men’s game.\n\nFollowing the World Cup final heartbreak, football fans are looking forward to cheering on the Lionesses once again at the next UEFA Women’s Euros.\n\nBut when will they take place, and where is it being held? Here’s what you need to know.\n\nWhen is the next UEFA Women’s Euros?\n\nThe fourteenth edition of the UEFA Women’s Euros is set to take place in summer 2025.\n\nThere is no set date for the tournament to begin, but the 2022 Women’s Euros took place between July 6 to 31, 2022.\n\nThe thirteenth edition of the tournament was originally set to take place from July 7 to August 1, 2021, but was rescheduled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhere will it be held?\n\nEngland will be defending their title in Switzerland when the 2025 Women’s Euros roll around.\n\nThe Swiss Football Association were appointed hosts by the UEFA Executive Committee in April when it convened in Lisbon earlier this year, beating off competition from Poland, France, and a joint bid from Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden.\n\nThe tournament will take place across eight venues in Switzerland, including:\n\nAccording to the UEFA website, there will be more than 720,000 tickets available for the final tournament.\n\nThe site also states: ‘In line with UEFA’s recently introduced guidelines, the Swiss strategy also embraces Circular Economy models (reduce, reuse, recover) to minimise waste wherever possible.\n\n‘Further social responsibility initiatives are planned regarding human rights, inclusion, and equality.’\n\nHow many teams will be taking part?\n\nSixteen teams will take part in the tournament.\n\nThe Women’s Euros expanded to 16 teams in 2017 when the Netherlands emerged triumphant on home soil. Before this, just 12 teams competed in the competition.\n\nWhen does qualifying start?\n\nQualifying for the Women’s Euros is based on the results of the 2023/24 UEFA Women’s Nations League, which takes place between September 21 and December 5.\n\nFollowing the league phase, the Nations League finals will take place from February 21 to 28, 2024.\n\nTeams will be split into three different leagues – League A with 16 teams, League B with another 16 teams, and League C with all those remaining.\n\nThe top two teams in each of the four groups in League A will qualify directly for the 2025 finals.\n\nThe remaining slots – usually around seven or eight spots – will be contested over two rounds of home-and-away European Qualifiers play-offs.\n\nIn League C, teams will compete in groups of three or four teams over six match days against different teams in their group.\n\nThe European Qualifiers league will see the eight top teams in League A directly qualify for the Women’s Euros 2025, and the remaining slots will be contested over two rounds of European Qualifier playoffs.\n\nIn the first round of matches, the teams in third and fourth place in League A will face the winners and three runners-up in League C, with eight winners progressing to the second round.\n\nAt the same time, the four group winners and two runners-up in League B will face the remaining two runners-up and four third-placed teams in League B, with six winners also going on to the second round.\n\nIn the second round, the teams will play against each other with seven winners progressing to the final tournament.\n\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\n\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nMORE : Alex Scott holds back the tears defending Lucy Bronze after England World Cup final heartache"
