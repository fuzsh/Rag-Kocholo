        "text": "Even a casual glance across the social media sites of the world’s top rowers would show how much the athletes love Lucerne’s Rotsee. They call it the “Lake of the Gods”. The often perfect racing conditions are backed by a truly Swiss standard of first-class organisation.\n\nToday it seemed as if those “Gods” might be angry as thunder was forecast to rattle around the course with lightning threatened.\n\nSo it was with some relief that the morning race programme was able to start on time with dark skies all around. And the day began with a surprise for British fans when Helen Glover and Heather Stanning could not go to the start line because of illness to Stanning.\n\nThe World, Olympic and European Champions went out to warm up but had to withdraw at the last minute from what would have been the first test of the season in a final against the two top USA pairs and New Zealand’s no.1- ranked duo of Rebecca Scown, former World Champion, and Genevieve Behrens. The race was won by Felice Mueller and Grace Luczak of the USA.\n\nWill Fletcher and Richard Chambers capped a fantastic debut season together last year in the lightweight men’s double scull with a World silver behind the stand-out World combination of Stany Delayre and Jeremie Azou of France. Here Azou is racing with Pierre Houin, who beat Delayre at the French trials. The form pair through the heats and semis, having beaten the GB double twice en route to the final, seemed to be the Norwegians Kristoffer Brun and Are Strandli.\n\nGB meanwhile were racing here for the first time this summer after Chambers suffered a hand injury.\n\nThe French made the strongest start, taking a half-length lead, over the Norwegians and the British, within the first 300m. France continued to power away and the Norwegians followed. Fletcher and Chambers were still holding third.\n\nSouth Africa’s London 2012 lightweight men’s four winners James Thompson and John Smith, made a push in the second quarter and came up to take third wth the Irish European Champions also showing their hand.\n\nIn the third quarter, as France built their lead, the GB duo were holding fifth and had a battle on their hands. As France powered on to win, with Norway taking silver and South Africa bronze, the GB duo showed they need to add a final touch of race pace, which can come before Rio, after racing in multiple different patterns here.\n\nChris Bartley and Peter Chambers are both Olympic silver medallists in the lightweight men’s four. Bartley stroked the boat in London but has moved to the bow seat for this season’s campaign and Chambers is stroking. Between them sit Mark Aldred and Jono Clegg who have become experienced international racers since London.\n\nThe quartet, ninth at last year’s Worlds, took European silver at the beginning of the month behind the World Champion Swiss. In this ever-competitive boat class the Danes and New Zealanders are also top crews.\n\nFrance, though, made the best start but there was less than a second covering the top five as the crews raced through the 500m timing point. New Zealand soon hit back and were leading at halfway with the Swiss a third of a length down and GB coming up to challenge the Danes for third.\n\nStroke by stroke the British quartet fought to come back but they did not have enough in the tank and, perhaps sapped by the effort of chasing down the Danes, they were unaware of the French flying up the inside to take fourth. Gold to New Zealand, silver to Switzerland, much to the delight of the big crowd, and bronze to the Danes.\n\n“It was good to be competitive for part of the race even if that wasn’t our best row”, said Bartley afterwards. “We had hoped for a step up from the heat but that wasn’t one”.\n\nThe GB Rowing Team’s men’s quadruple scull, winners of World medals in 2013 and 2014, isn’t having the best of luck this season so far. Injury to several-times GB trials winner Charles Cousins has ruled him out for the year and today they raced with Jack Beaumont in the bow seat instead of Peter Lambert who had been struck down overnight by the same virus as Stanning.\n\nIn today’s race the GB combination of Beaumont, Angus Groom, Sam Townsend, and Graeme Thomas made a fast start and were leading in the first 250m with Germany the other crew quick to show.\n\nBowman Beaumont took a look across at 500m gone and he would have seen that no-one had gone with their pace. In the adjacent lane the Swiss came up to take second before Australia emerged as the main challenger at halfway.\n\nWith 650m to go the GB boat still looked connected but the pace of the Australians saw them through into the lead from where they went on to win. GB held on strongly to silver and the Swiss won bronze.\n\n“It was a bit surprising to be up by so much in the early part of the race but we knew the Australians had a good sprint. In a last minute combination like today there is only so much you can do but we are pleased with the result and there is still a lot more we can do” , said Groom.\n\n“We had wanted to bounce back in Brandenburg from last season’s Worlds but that didn’t happen. At some stage you have to put in a performance and huge credit to the guys today. It shows how adaptable Jack [Beaumont] is too. To be able to come in like that and win a medal”.\n\nSam Townsend added: “I think there is bags of potential in this boat, no matter who rows. Jack did an excellent job today, coming in just one and a half hours before racing. We nearly capsized with our first stroke in training but we kept our heads in the race. All credit to the Aussies, they have a good sprint, but we hope to stay on the other side of them next time.”\n\nJack Beaumont: “It just goes to show how good these guys, Pete [Lambert] and our coach Paul [Stannard] are, the fact they can make this change, throw me in at the last minute and still get a result.”\n\nAlan Campbell, by his own high standards, had a poor European Championships. Here he has bounced back through the heats and semis to race in the final against most of the world’s form open single scullers. The Coleraine man, bronze medallist at London 2012, was leading in the early part of the race before Ondrej Synek and Mahe Drysdale locked horns at the head of the field in a continuation of their intriguing series of head-to-heads.\n\nBehind them Stefan Broenink of the Netherlands and Angel Fournier Rodriguez of Cuba came through Campbell who was now lying fifth where he ultimately finished. This was a significant step up on Brandenburg and was not a disappointment for him.\n\n“I as a bit tired from yesterday and I didn’t race very well in the semi-final and that was my downfall not today. I have identified that, I can see that it has happened and I know what I have to do. I am looking forward to Poznan now as a result of here. I feel very confident and I feel back in a good way and I’m very positive”, said Campbell.\n\nDrysdale turned on the power with 350m to go and took victory, Synek in silver and Fournier Rodriguez in bronze.\n\nNathaniel Reilly O’Donnell and Mat Tarrant were one of a small number of GB Rowing Team crews who raced at the season’s opening World Cup in Varese and did so with impact, taking the gold medal.\n\nHere they faced the so-called “unbeatable” Kiwis, the World and Olympic Champions Eric Murray and Hamish Bond as well as the Dutch duo Roel Braas and Mitchel Steenman whom they beat in Varese and the seasoned South Africans Lawrence Brittain and Shaun Keeling.\n\nThe GB men’s pair, who won World coxed pair gold with Henry Fieldman last year, started sharply and were in the lead briefly before the Dutch came through to take the lead with Murray and Bond waiting to pounce in third.\n\nAnd pounce they did, coming through in the second quarter to hit the front at halfway with O’Donnell and Tarrant eking out a second position ahead of the Dutch.\n\nWith 650m to go the South Africans began to make an impact and came though to take third from the Dutch who then hit back. GB were still holding onto second with the Kiwis striding on out in front.\n\nIn the final 200m the pace was frenetic and the Dutch came back on the British combination. At the line there was nothing to split the two crews time-wise. So whilst they recorded the same 6:51.05, the silver went to the Dutch on the photo-finish decision.\n\n“I think we performed much better than in the heat. We were not happy with what we did in the heat so we spent some time working on things yesterday, reminding ourselves of what makes the boat go faster”, said Tarrant.\n\n“Things have been going well in training over the last couple of months and whilst we were disappointed with our heat here we worked hard and I thought our base was stronger here today but the Dutch pulled it out in the final”.\n\nLike the earlier men’s quadruple scull combination, the GB men’s four crew is racing here with a substitute for Constantine Louloudis who is back in training and recovered from a virus but not yet race-ready. Callum McBrierty took the bow seat and Alex Gregory moved to stroking the boat with Moe Sbihi in the two-seat and George Nash in the three-seat.\n\nThe Australians, Dutch and USA were the main challengers but, at this level in Olympic year, no crew can be discounted.\n\nOff the start, the GB combination gave it big guns and were in a good place but the Australians came through to take the lead just before the 500m mark wth the Dutch up close to GB.\n\nAfter halfway the Australians were still leading but the GB quartet were eating back into that lead. They had the overlap and then were back within two-thirds of a length.\n\nAs the race hit the grandstand stretch the British dug deep and were within a canvas when drama struck the Australians as their two-man Joshua Dunkley-Smith caught a crab, bringing their boat speed to a resounding stop and their campaign for gold with it. Gold to GB in 5:55.48 and silver to the Australians in 5:55.75 with the Dutch in bronze.\n\n“We knew the Australians had a fast start and we were grinding it out and grinding it out and getting back to them and I kept saying in my head ‘you’re not going to get this one, you’re not going to get this one’ and on the line it could have gone to anyone”, said McBrierty.\n\n“That wasn’t exactly a text-book way to win was it?”, said Gregory.\n\n“We could have stayed at home and trained but we didn’t want to shy away from it”, said Sbihi. “We need to practise for this kind of thing. At the Olympics someone could go down ill so this wows invaluable”.\n\nKatie Greves, Melanie Wilson, Frances Houghton, Polly Swann, Jessica Eddie, Olivia Carnegie Brown, Karen Bennett, Zoe Lee and cox Zoe de Toledo arrived here as the best crew in Europe, taking gold in Brandenburg in early May.\n\nThis was the first opportunity to take on the rest of the world in the shape of World and Olympic Champions, the USA, the New Zealanders and the regular podium visitors, Canada.\n\nOnly being in front of the USA could have given the GB boat a better start. As it was they were second to the USA at 500m gone and third by under half a second to New Zealand at the halfway.\n\nWith a stunning final 750m, the GB crew came back through the Kiwi crew to take second and were closing tightly on the USA at the line. 6:01.12 to the USA and 6:01.95 to GB. Bronze to NZ.\n\n“I have had so many conversations about how to make the boat go faster with all these women”, said Zoe Lee. “I think that was why when we were behind we found the spirit to come back through”.\n\nKatie Greves said: “That was a really good race. We did what we wanted to do out of the blocks and held it well until halfway but just let ourselves down a bit in the third 500m. We are developing a real belief in ourselves, though, and came back strongly. We are so nearly there.”\n\nFrances Houghton added: “It was a brilliant result but at the same time we know there are so many things we can step on with, which is exciting. That is a great position to be in running up to the Olympics and I am so proud of all of the girls.”\n\nOlivia Carnegie-Brown said: “That was a bit of a show for the spectators. Every time we race we are finding out more about ourselves and finding more speed. That is the closest we have ever got to the American eight and I could hear them shouting at each other. We are getting closer and we believe we can take them when it really matters.”\n\nMuch excitement surrounded the men’s double repechage yesterday. GB’s no.1 double of Jonny Walton and John Collins led throughout to win but behind them the second-ranked duo of Nick Middleton and Jack Beaumont put on a heroic turn of pace at the finish to come from nowhere and take the second qualifying slot.\n\nIronically, they were drawn in adjacent lanes in today’s final where the Croatian Sinkovic brothers were the big favourites. Out front the New Zealanders led first but had to give up that lead to the Sinkovic family.\n\nWalton and Collins were within tight contention at 500m gone but slipped back gradually on the clock as the race went through halfway to finish fifth overall with Beaumont and Middleton in sixth. Lithuania came through powerfully to take the bronze with Germany in third.\n\nGreat Britain’s eight has also been affected by illness with Pete Reed, the Olympic Champion in the men’s four in Beijing and London, being replaced by Alan Sinclair.\n\nAll the Olympic-qualified eights are here bar Poland. and GB was drawn between Russia and the Netherlands. Germany, the Olympic Champions, were favourites to win.\n\nToday the Dutch took an early lead with Great Britain, Germany and New Zealand all chasing them down. Just before halfway the USA, who had started slowly, began to make some inroads. Of the top five boats, any crew could win from here in an exciting finale to a damp-weather day full of colour on the water.\n\nAs the Dutch lead looked like it could be eroded, the British were lying in fourth and still in with a chance in a tight field with 500m to go but the Dutch kept their foot down and raced to gold with the Germans coming back to snatch silver from the Americans by just over two tenths.\n\nB FINALS\n\nTwo GB crews were involved in the B finals, with both the women’s pair and lightweight women’s double finishing third in their race and ninth overall.\n\nThe second GB women’s pair of Louisa Reeve and Vicki Meyer-Laker, who only started racing together this week, put in a big push to move up to third in the final 500m, in a race won by Germany from France.\n\nBrianna Stubbs and Ellie Piggott got off to a good start in their lightweight women’s double final and were in an effective three-way tie for the lead at 500m.\n\nIreland and Poland began to pull clear and went on to take the top two spots but there was a good scrap between the Brits and Switzerland for third place, with still nothing between them at the 1,500m mark.\n\nStubbs and Piggott were finally able to move away in the closing stages and went on to finish half-a-length clear of the home boat."
