        "text": "Barcelona (CNA).- The 51st edition of the Joan Gamper Trophy will take place this Wednesday where the new squad will be presented, and the manager expressed his delight at the players brought in.“On paper, this is the best squad that I have had in my three years at Barça”, stated Luis Enrique in his pre-match press conference on Tuesday. The five new members of the first team, Denis Suárez, Umtiti, Digne, André Gomes and Samper, to be introduced to the Camp Nou in the Joan Gamper Trophy. The game will be preceded at 7.30pm CET by the official presentation of the first team squad, including the new signings Denis Suárez, Lucas Digne, André Gomes and Samuel Umtiti, as well as Sergi Samper, who has been promoted from Barça B. The only players that are still missing are Neymar Jr and Rafinha, who are competing for their native Brazil at the Rio Olympics.\n\nLuis Enrique promised in his pre-match press conference on Tuesday that absolutely everyone in the squad will be getting a run-out on Wednesday night, including all three goalkeepers, who’ll be getting thirty minutes each.\n\nForm guide\n\nThis is the last of four friendlies for Barça before things get really serious with the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup on Sunday. In three games against British opposition, the Blaugrana beat Celtic 3-2 and Leicester City 4-2 but suffered a hefty 4-0 reverse in their last outing, the trip to Wembley to face Liverpool.\n\nSampdoria, who finished 15th in Serie A last season, have made three summer signings in Patrik Schick (Sparta Prague), Daniel Pavlovi? (Grasshopper) and Luca Cigarini (Atalanta). So far this preseason, they have won 2-0 at fellow Italian side Chievo and lost on penalties in Malaga after their game three days ago ended 0-0 after 90 minutes.\n\nHistory\n\nLa Samp were Barça’s victims both in the 1989 European Cup Winner’s Cup Final (2-0) and the 1992 European Cup Final (1-0). This is the third time they have come to the Gamper. Five years after Ronald Koeman scored the extra time winner at Wembley, they lost 2-0, but on the 20th anniversary, they won 1-0 thanks to a solitary goal from Roberto Soriano. That was the last time that the visiting team has been victorious at the Gamper, Barça having beaten Santos, Club Leon and Roma in the last three editions, scoring a combined total of 17 goals to no reply!\n\n“If we find a player that will improve us, we will do it. If not, we continue with this squad, which is already great”, said Luis Enrique and praised the current squad. “It has been strengthened brilliantly.”\n\nThe new players\n\nThe five new members of the first team, Denis Suárez, Umtiti, Digne, André Gomes and Samper, to be introduced to the Camp Nou in the Joan Gamper Trophy. “They have arrived at a very high physical level, the first days have been very positive”, stated Luis Enrique. Regarding Barça’s midfielders, the coach considered that they are enough since “many of them can adapt to different positions”. In reference to the right-back he assured that “is a very well covered position”. \"Football does not understand the past. Credit must be renewed daily, and the only way I can transmit that to the Barça fans is by coaching the team”, said the coach."
