        "text": "After being the fastest in the semi-final race on Saturday, the Sinković brothers achieved another victory with a result of 6:07.19! Second place was taken by the Australian crew of David Bartholot and Caleb Antill (6:08.10). Aleix Garcia Pujolar and Rodrigo Conde Romero from Spain (6:08.56) took third.\n\nFourth place was taken by the Lithuanian crew (6:10.03), fifth by the British crew (6:11.44), while the Serbian crew finished last with a time of 6:15.53.\n\nThe Croatian rowers were ahead from the beginning of the final race and took the lead in the fight where the Australians David Bartholot and Caleb Antill were a serious and constant threat.\n\nHowever, at every passage, from 500 to 1000 and 1500 meters to the finish line, the Sinković brothers were slightly ahead of the Australians. They repelled all their attacks, kept a constant fierce rhythm, and in the end celebrated with a winning time of 6:07.19.\n\nThe famous Croatian rowers have thus won the first and second World Cup and secured the title of overall winners even before the regatta in Lucerne.\n\nCroatia’s sister rowing team Ivana and Josip Jurković won fifth place in the coxless pairs final in Lucerne.\n\nThe Jurković sisters rowed the 2000 m section in 7:11.92 minutes. The New Zealand crew won with a time of 6:56.51. Silver was won by the Romanian crew (6:56.62), and bronze by the Great Britain crew (7:00.76).\n\nIvana and Josipa Jurković started the race well and were in third place on the first pass at 500 meters. They then fell to fourth and fought until the end with the Czech crew, who nevertheless finished fourth (7:00.74), while the Croatian crew had to settle for fifth. Only the Canadian women placed behind the Jurković sisters.\n\nMore soon…\n\nTo read more about sports in Croatia, follow TCN’s dedicated page.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nthe fields marked with * are required"
