        "text": "The Great Britain men’s eight brought the curtain down in style and the crowd to their feet to win the men’s eight gold medal by just eight hundredths of a second from their big rivals and Olympic Champions, Germany.\n\nMatt Gotrel, Constantine Louloudis, Pete Reed, Paul Bennett, Mohamed Sbihi, Alex Gregory, George Nash, Will Satch and cox Phelan Hill worked themselves into a good lead early in the race before Germany mounted a charge which brought them back bow-ball to bow-ball with the British crew.\n\nAn immense effort in the final ten strokes kept the challenge at bay and gave GB, the World Champions, the gold in 5:33.95. New Zealand were third.\n\n“It was pretty nerve-wracking in the boat, I don’t know what it was like watching, but it was good to stay on the right side of it,” said Sbihi.\n\nSatch added: “We are pretty pumped after that. It’s 15 years since a British eight last won in Lucerne, so it’s a bit of an historic moment.”\n\nEarlier European Champions James Foad and Matt Langridge marked their return to world cup action after an injury pause with a barnstorming second half to take silver in the men’s pair behind the New Zealand Olympic Champions.\n\nFoad said: James Foad: “We have to take confidence from that. We were nine seconds behind New Zealand this time last year but we are closing the gap and there is still more to come from us”.\n\nSandwiched between the men’s medals came a well-fought bronze for the GB women’s eight who took the race to the World silver medallists and eventual winners, Canada, from the start before being pipped by beaten to silver by the New Zealanders.\n\nThe afternoon medals followed gold from the women’s pair and bronze from the open men’s single scull in the morning’s session.\n\n“We have had five strong medals today and two outstanding golds from our women’s pair and men’s eight. We didn’t get everything right here but we will go away to our pre-Worlds camps next week with confidence in what we’ve achieved and some good learnings for those Championships”, said Sir David Tanner, GB RowingTeam Performance Director.\n\nEarlier today Helen Glover and Heather Stanning had given themselves the best possible platform for their World Championships preparation by winning that world cup women’s pair gold.\n\nThe Olympic, World and European Champions moved out to a 27-race winning streak by holding off a strong New Zealand pair, Grace Prendergast and Kerri Gowler. The GB duo moved out to a big early lead and then sustained the pressure to win in 6:57.59. Denmark took the bronze.\n\nGlover said: I felt like we were in control through all of it. In some sense, I guess, we expected a bit more of a race from them”.\n\nStanning added: “That was really pleasing because Helen called the race perfectly. We saw New Zealand put in a push but Helen said ‘stay there’. We had the stimulus outside the boat but we felt contained within it.\n\n“We knew we were going to attack it because it was the last chance to put down a marker before the World Championships.\n\nA year ago Lucerne was the scene for one of Alan Campbell’s worse regattas which resulted in him missing out on the 2014 World Championships. Today the London 2012 bronze medallist showed his continuing return to form by winning a plucky bronze in the open men’s single scull in a race won by Mahe Drysdale of New Zealand.\n\nCampbell said: “To come back from last year like that, to go from 14th to bronze and being back on the podium – it feels like a gold-medal performance to me”.\n\nOlympic Champion Kat Copeland, racing this season with Charlotte Taylor, did not have such a good day. They finished fourth in the lightweight women’s double scull won by New Zealand with South Africa in silver Holding third until the final 300m, the GB boat was pipped by the USA for bronze.\n\nJonny Walton and John Collins were fifth in the double scull final as were the women’s quadruple scull in their final.\n\nHighlights of Lucerne will be shown on BBC 2 on Monday at 15.00.\n\nSCROLL DOWN FOR MORE\n\n====================================================================\n\nSAVE THE DATE\n\nThe GB Rowing Team for the World Championships will be announced on Tuesday 21st July. We will have a press event at our training base near Reading. More details and a timetable to follow.\n\nThis year’s World Championships from August 30 – September 6 doubles as the Olympic and Paralympic qualifying regatta.\n\nSCROLL DOWN FOR MORE\n\n====================================================================\n\nRACE REPORTS\n\nJames Foad and Matt Langridge sat out Varese for Foad to recover from slight injury. Henley provided an opportunity for the lead GB men’s pair to return to racing in advance of Lucerne.\n\nThe men’s pair event has been dominated in recent years by Eric Murray and Hamish Bond of New Zealand who are the World and Olympic Champions and who lined up next to the British boat today. Jack Hargreaves and Nicholas Wheatley of Australia and Roel Braas and Mitchel Steenman of Holland were both on the podium in Varese and the South Africans David Hunt and Shaun Keeling have both been World finalists. Serbia were not to be dismissed either.\n\nAs Foad and Langridge sat on the start line they must have known the task would be tough. South Africa flew off the start and took a lead with the Dutch in second place. In the second quarter Bond and Murray hit the front and the Serbians followed them. The GB duo, often strong in the second half, came up on the shoulders of the Dutch and edged past them into third at 1500m gone.\n\nThat is when they made the difference. As the tempo moved up a notch Foad and Langridge responded with a storming effort to the line to win a well-deserved silver. By the line, they were just over a length down on the New Zealanders.\n\nMatt Langridge: “We got the wins at Henley and the Europeans without rowing well but we have definitely moved on here. We are still in front of everyone bar the Kiwis and now we have a good base to work on.”\n\nFoad added: “We came here with still not a lot of racing under our belts. We only had Henley last week and that was completely different, the competition was not as strong as here. We have learnt from each of the three races over this weekend and we both feel there is still a lot more to come”.\n\nMelanie Wilson, Kristina Stiller, Frances Houghton and Jess Leyden lined up in the women’s quadruple scull final here in lane five. Germany were the on-paper favourites having re-established their hold on one of their favourite events recently.\n\nEarly in the race the Germans began to assert themselves with Poland chasing before they were passed by the Australians who in turn were overtaken by New Zealand. The GB quad were not having the best of it. They were sixth and would need a big push to get into the reckoning. It did not happen.\n\nAt the head of the field the Germans held on despite another big push by Australia which saw them into silver followed by the fast-finishing Dutch in third.\n\nJonny Walton and John Collins struck third time lucky to arrive in today’s final having been rowed out of the main event by close margins at the semi-final stage at both the European Championships and Varese World Cup.\n\nThe Henley winners knew that Croatia’s Sinkovic brothers and Germany’s European Champions Marcel Hacker and Stephan Krueger were the ones to watch as well as the New Zealanders who beat the GB boat intthe semi-finals.\n\nSomewhat inevitably the Croatian world champions started strongly to take an early lead. Collins and Walton were in a very tightly packed following phalanx. Germany began to move through the field to take second at the 500m. Australia were third and GB fourth.\n\nAs the halfway point came and went the Croatians seemed to be a country-mile ahead with Collins and Walton still in contention but lying sixth before the front of the race lifted the pace and left the British duo without the opportunity to come back on them. Fifth for GB in a time of 6:28.29 in a race won by the Croatians. Germany were second and Australia third.\n\nKatie Greves, Louisa Reeve, Jess Eddie, Donna Etiebet, Vicky Meyer-Laker, Olivia Carnegie-Brown, Rosamund Bradbury, Zoe Lee and cox Zoe de Toledo were bronze medallists in Varese last month behind the American Olympic Champions and Canada, the World silver medallists. With the USA absent here in Lucerne, Canada had to be the main target with a weather eye on the improved Kiwis and the Romanians, second to GB in the repechage.\n\nGreat Britain got off to a cracking start and were level for the first 150m with Canada before the World Silver medallist took a canvas lead. To the other side of the British crew, the Australians were also showing well before the New Zealanders began to come into the picture.\n\nIn the third quarter of the race the field was very, very close with New Zealand getting ahead of GB to take second and Romania were challenging the British for bronze.\n\nDe Toledo urged her crew on. They put in another effort to hold onto third. The effort was enough to see the British crew not only onto the podium but also into closer reckoning with the Canadian winners and Kiwi silver medalists.\n\nOlivia Carnegie-Brown said: “We wanted this week to be about putting things into practice. i think we did that when we needed to and now we can go away and build on that and come back and do it again at the World Championships”.\n\nDonna Etiebet said: “I think we should be proud of how we executed things today. Getting it mentally right here was probably more important than anything else. Going away to training camp we can now build on our strengths”.\n\nJess Eddie said of the delay at the start because of start traffic light problems: “I felt with the issues at the start we couldn’t get away as well as normal. So given that, I feel that we did well to get into it”.\n\nRo Bradbury said that there was more to come: “I think we can do better than that. Perhaps I am a little disappointed with that and know that we have more to come’.\n\nVicky Meyer-Laker added: “This weekend has been all about getting our race right. I think we have made big steps on. This was confidence building as well go into the training camps”.\n\nMatt Gotrel, Constantine Louloudis, Pete Reed, Paul Bennett, Mohamed Sbihi, Alex Gregory, George Nash, Will Satch and cox Phelan Hill roared into today’s final via a heat victory which Satch said put them in the right place after Henley.\n\nToday the GB boat eked out a quarter-length lead in the opening 600m. In the middle of the race the GB eight moved out to a second’s lead over Germany. “Never estimate the Germans ability to come back”, said an expert in the crowd. The words were prophetic as the German counterattack was launched. Stoke by stroke the GB crew dug in and held onto the gold.\n\n“It was pretty nerve-wracking in the boat, I don’t know what it was like watching, but it was good to stay on the right side of it,” said Sbihi. “It was important psychologically that they didn’t get through us.\n\n“We go away from here with things to work on. We still have the Russians and the Americans to come back at the World Championships, this is a really challenging event. It’s going to be very competitive and we’ll have to work hard to stay at the top of the field.”\n\nNash added: “We were all expecting a tough race but maybe not that close at the end! We got out pretty hard and did well for 1,500m but then the Germans pulled out a major sprint we only just held off. All that matters is getting that bow ball across the line first and it’s great that we did.\n\n“We have got a lot to motivate us in the next few weeks on training camp and there is no risk that we are going to be complacent.”\n\nSatch, who stroked Britain to victory, said: “We have three days off now and then we go away to quite an intense training camp – and we’ll come back even faster.”\n\nMORNING SESSION REPORTS\n\nIf prior form were the barometer then today’s final of the women’s pair should looked set to be a close contest between GB’s Olympic Champions, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, and New Zealand’s 2014 World U23 Champions Grace Prendergast and Kerri Gowler. The Americans, contenders for the top prize at this year’s Worlds, are absent here in Lucerne.\n\nWhen the race got underway the GB duo made a quick start and moved out to a length lead over the New Zealanders. Their intention was clear. The GB boat had better boat speed just beyond the 500m mark and moved further away. For the British supporters in the grandstands watching on the big screen, the anxiety was whether Glover and Stanning had spent too much, too early.\n\nAt 1500m gone, Glover and Stanning still had a good lead but the New Zealanders began to close. Prepared to wait for their moment, the GB boat called the race perfectly to withhold the pressure. The Antipodeans had dug deep to get the overlap but then, just as the GB boat moved away again, they caught a crab in the finishing 20 strokes. Victory in 6:57.59 to New Zealand’s 7:00.24 and a perfect pre-Worlds marker. Denmark were third.\n\nJono Clegg had brief respite after winning silver in the lightweight men’s pair last night before he was told the news that he would be substituting for an injured Will Fletcher in the lightweight men’s double final here today with Richard Chambers. Fletcher was understandably crestfallen at missing out. For Clegg it meant a switch from sweep oar to sculling, too.\n\nIn today’s final the GB boat faced the 2013 World Champions Are Standli and Kristoffer Brun as well as the recently all-conquering French crew of Stany Delayre and Jeremie Azou. For Chambers it was also a chance to race James Thompson and John Smith of South Africa, from the crew that took 2012 gold ahead of GB in London’s light men’s four final, and who are the reigning World Champions.\n\nEarly in the race the British were up close with the French and in second place at 250m gone. By halfway the British, to the surprise of the spectators given the circumstances, were holding third behind the French and the Norwegians but with Italy pressuring them hard.\n\nIn the final 500m it was clear that Clegg and Chambers were tiring and they dropped back to fifth place in the end – a good result. At the head of the field the French drove on to win whilst South Africa’s finishing speed saw them into silver with Norway in third.\n\nCharlotte Taylor and Kat Copeland are GB’s new combination in the lightweight women’s double scull in 2015. They emerged into the top boat from a tight-knit and closely-contested training group including Imogen Walsh who took silver in the lightweight women’s single last night on the Rotsee.\n\nTaylor and Copeland were involved in a scintillating final in Varese last month in which they came through with the last two strokes to win against New Zealand’s World Champions, Sophie Mackenzie and Julia Edward. The two crews met in the semi-finals here and the Kiwis took the honours. Kirsten Mccann and Ursula Grobler of South Africa, world finalists in 2014, were also a consideration.\n\nTaylor and Copeland were third at halfway and South Africa produced the surprise package by leading in the opening 1000m. New Zealand came back on them and moved ahead with the British combination struggling to make inroads. Taylor and Copeland are renowned for their finish but today could not find that top gear. New Zealand went on to win in 6:55.06 with South Africa second and the Americans coming through to take bronze, just half a second ahead of Taylor and Copeland.\n\nAlan Campbell, the GB Rowing Team’s London 2012 bronze medallist, lined up in tough company for today’s single scull final. He was drawn alongside World and Olympic Champion Mahe Drysdale in a race which included Ondrej Synek, the reigning World Champion and London 2012 silver medallist.\n\nCampbell came through to today’s final by way of second place behind Mindaugas Griskonis of Lithuania in the semis. Campbell, returning to form after a difficult 2014, got off to a decent start but Drysdale of New Zealand led the field with 300m gone. Behind him were Griskonis, Synek and then Campbell at close quarters.\n\nDrysdale continued to pile on the pressure at the front. Campbell stayed in the mix in fourth. Griskonis came up to challenge Drysdale and Campbell move into third. Aware of Synek’s finishing strength Campbell put in a burst with 250m to go and bagged the bronze with gusto in 6:54.80. Drysdale took gold and Griskonis the silver.\n\nB FINALS\n\nKaren Bennett and Rebecca Chin rounded off a good regatta by taking fourth place in today’s B final of the women’s pair. They stayed in contention throughout in a race won by Australia.\n\nOliver Cook and Stewart Innes followed up on the mirror-like Rotsee in the Sunday morning sun by taking second in their B final using a big push in the final 150m to surge past Spain. France were the winners.\n\nGB’s European Champion men’s four of Alan Sinclair, Scott Durant, Tom Ransley and Nathaniel Reilly O’Donnell have not re-found their form since winning in Poznan. Today they were fifth just before halfway in the B final before surging through to take third in a close finish with the Czech Republic who were second to Germany.\n\nKatherine Grainger and Vicky Thornley suffered a shock exit from yesterday’s women’s double scull semi-finals having experienced a boat-stopping crab which gave them too much to make up. In today’s B final the GB boat led from the get-go and it was probably not surprising to see them cross the line to win by clear-water from Finland and Denmark.\n\nJamie Kirkwood, Peter Chambers, Chris Bartley and Mark Aldred finished the B final programme for GB with another win. They moved into a narrow lead just after halfway and were neck and neck with Spain before getting the verdict by just over a tenth of a second.\n\nSCROLL DOWN FOR MORE\n\n===========================================================\n\nRESULTS\n\n(Events featuring GB Rowing Team crews only.
