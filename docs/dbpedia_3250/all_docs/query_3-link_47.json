        "text": "Switzerland have been chosen as hosts for the Uefa Women’s Euro 2025 national team tournament.\n\nThe Swiss bid was selected at a meeting of Uefa’s executive committee in Lisbon on 4th April.\n\nSwitzerland overcame bids from France, Poland and a combined bid from four Nordic countries – Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.\n\nThe Swiss Football Association (FA) replied to Uefa’s tweet confirming the news by posting: “Happy to welcome you all at home! See you then!”\n\nSwitzerland, which is the home of Uefa and of soccer’s world governing body Fifa, co-hosted the Uefa men’s 2008 European Championship alongside Austria, and hosted the men’s World Cup in 1954.\n\nEngland will head into the tournament in just over two years’ time as holders after the Lionesses’ triumph on home soil last summer.\n\nSwiss FA president Dominique Blanc said: “This is a historic day for Switzerland, the association and women’s football.\n\n“This big step will shape the development of women’s football at all levels. I would like to thank everyone involved who made this project possible, especially those responsible at the federal government, the cantons and the host cities, who have supported us from the start.”\n\nThe tournament will be staged in June and July 2025, with the Swiss bid proposing matches would be hosted in Basel, Bern, Geneva, Zurich, St Gallen, Sion, Lucerne and Thun.\n\nMarion Daube, the association’s director of women’s soccer and the leader of the bid project, added: “The Swiss FA has made the promotion of women’s football an important part of its strategy for the future and is extremely pleased that we are supporting our strategy to hold a tournament with high visibility in our country.\n\n“We are proud that our application was successful and we want to show that football is accessible to everyone. Our tournament should be a four-week festival for the whole of Switzerland and, due to our location in the heart of Europe, also for the surrounding countries.”"
