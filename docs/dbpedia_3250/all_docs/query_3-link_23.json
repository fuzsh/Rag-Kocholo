        "text": "GOOD SEED MAKES A GOOD SPORT​\n\nA UEFA European Championship (and FIFA World Cup) Timeline​\n\nBased on my A Solution to Dissolution: If the UEFA Nations League Began in 1998 Timeline\n\nBy NTF aka Seb​\n\nPrologue​\n\nFollowing the introduction of the Nations League in 1998, UEFA began implementing the Nations League overall rankings as seeding for the qualifiers for the European Championship and FIFA World Cup, starting with Euro 2000 qualifying. It would also provide teams with a second opportunity to qualify for the Euros or the World Cup based on their Nations League performance should they have failed to qualify directly from their qualification group.\n\nUEFA Euro 2000 qualifying ​\n\nThe group phase qualifying matches were played from March to November 1999, while the qualifying play-offs took place in March 2000. Alongside the co-hosts Belgium and the Netherlands, the nine group winners and the best runner-up qualified directly. Altogether, there were nine qualifying groups: five groups with five teams, and four groups with six teams. The four remaining participants were determined by four play-off paths based on team performances in the 1998-99 UEFA Nations League.\n\nDraw ​\n\nThe draw was conducted on 18 December 1998 in Ghent, Belgium. The 49 participating teams were divided into eight pots based on the November 1998 Nations League overall rankings. In connection with the introduction of this new ranking system, UEFA decided that the reigning champion would no longer be automatically top seeded. This notably meant that the Euro 1996 winners Germany would be ranked 14th for the qualifying draw, not first. Belgium (ranked 20th) and the Netherlands (ranked 8th) were not present due to having already qualified for the final tournament as hosts. The four participants of the 1999 UEFA Nations League Finals (Norway, Portugal, Romania and Spain) would be allocated to a separate pot and drawn into Groups 1-4, which only had five teams. This meant they would only have to play eight qualifying matches, leaving two matchdays free to play in the Nations League Finals. Similarly, the six participants of the interleague play-offs in March 1999 (Armenia, the Faroe Islands, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta and Moldova) would also allocated to a five-team group. However, only five such groups existed, meaning one of those teams would have to play in a group with six teams. UEFA decided that the lowest-ranked team (Liechtenstein) would be placed in a six-team group. As UEFA viewed it as “out of the question” to introduce qualifying groups with less than five teams, this was viewed as the lesser of the evils.\n\nParticipating teams seeded according to the November 1998 UEFA Nations League overall rankings.​\n\nFR Yugoslavia notably made a return to Euro qualifying, having been previously banned due to UN sanctions. Additionally, Andorra, who became UEFA members in November 1996, made their qualification debut. Also, Bosnia and Herzegovina, having featured in the qualifiers for the 1998 World Cup, now made their debut in the Euro qualifiers. All three “newcomers” did play in the 1998-99 Nations League, though.\n\nSeeding criticism\n\nThe football associations of Armenia, Belarus and Latvia criticised UEFA for using their raw Nations League point tallies to determine their seed, despite them playing in a three-team group and thus playing fewer matches, whereas every other group consisted of four teams. The three FA's argued that UEFA should've disregarded the matches played against the fourth-placed team in each League C group to make the Euro 2000 qualifying seeding more fair, as was normally done when ranking second-placed teams in qualifying groups with a different numbers of teams. UEFA refuted this, arguing that \"this is a different scenario since there's just a single group with a deviating number of teams, not several\", further adding that \"the benefit of playing in a three-team Nations League group outweighed the detriment of having a marginally worse seeding in the European qualifiers\". Critique also came from some of the FA's in Pot 5, who argued it was unfair that they would have to play in a six-team group despite being seeded higher than the teams in the Interleague Pot, who would be allocated to five-team groups and thus play fewer matches.\n\n—--------------------\n\nBack with a new timeline! As a result, it’s probably good I clarify some things:\n\nIf you are ever curious about results in the Nations League in TTL (highly relevant when it comes to team selection and path formation for the qualifying play-offs), feel free to click the hyperlink to my Nations League TL in the title.\n\nEven though the Nations League overall rankings are only used for seeding Euro qualifying in OTL, they will also be used for seeding the World Cup qualifiers in TTL, since FIFA rankings were not used for that in 2002 qualifying. In other words, UEFA wouldn’t displease FIFA by incorporating the Nations League overall rankings for World Cup qualifying seeding while discontinuing the use of the UEFA national team coefficient rankings.\n\nIf the pots allow it, the groups will be faithfully recreated to how they were in OTL.\n\nSince the matches are played at different dates than in OTL, “replays” of matches from OTL will not necessarily be identical in TTL. However, they will still be identical a lot of the time.\n\nWhile the final tournaments of the European Championships will be shown in their entirety in TTL, only the European qualifiers will be shown for the World Cup. Hence why the \"FIFA World Cup\" part of the title is in parenthesis. This is because the effect the new play-offs would have on the final outcome of the World Cup is negligble. World Cup outcomes will just be briefly mentioned in TTL as opposed to having major parts dedicated to them, with graphics, etc.\n\nPart 1 - Disruption\n\nUEFA Euro 2000 qualifying group stage\n\n​\n\nEffects of NATO air strikes on Serbia\n\nFrom 24 March to 10 June 1999, NATO executed an aerial bombing campaign against FR Yugoslavia during the Kosovo war. This caused severe air travel disruption in the Balkan region, forcing several of the scheduled March matches to be postponed, including the Greece v Czech Republic match, Austria v Israel match, Cyprus v Austria match, Italy v Belarus match, Turkey v Croatia v match, Macedonia v Albania match, Bulgaria v FR Yugoslavia match, Albania v Slovenia match, FR Yugoslavia v Macedonia match, Bosnia and Herzegovina v France match, and Bosnia and Herzegovina v Andorra match [1]. Subsequently, UEFA introduced an additional matchday in August so the affected countries could play all of their qualifying matches.\n\nGroup Summary\n\nThe four participants in the 1999 UEFA Nations League Finals did not play on the June matchday, while five out of the six teams that played in the interleague play-offs did not play any qualifying matches in March. Spain won Group 1, scoring an impressive 27 goals and notably participating in a spectacular 3-3 draw with Denmark, who are heading to the play-offs along with third-placed Switzerland. Group 2 was won by the Czech Republic, who were victorious in every match except one and finished ahead of a strong Norwegian side that ultimately won silver in the 1998-99 UEFA Nations League, a performance more than good enough to earn Norway a spot in the play-offs. Greece weren't nearly as good, but would still also gain a golden opportunity to qualify through the play-offs. The team who defeated Norway in the 1999 final, Romania, topped Group 3 in front of Germany, who ultimately did enough to qualify directly as the best runner-up. Portugal won Group 4 as expected, while Ukraine and Russia would have to hope for the best in the play-offs. Sweden didn't concede a single goal in the qualifiers and unexpectedly topped Group 5 ahead of England as a result. The Three Lions' fate will be determined by the play-offs, as will that of Poland. In accordance with the expectations, Italy were triumphant in Group 6, one that was admittedly quite easy. Meanwhile, Israel and Austria did enough in the Nations League to secure a play-off ticket. Turkey caused a minor upset by beating Croatia to the top spot in Group 7. The 1998 World Cup bronze medalists will compete in the play-offs to determine their fate, as will Finland. The NATO air strikes were surely on the minds of the Yugoslav players, but they didn't let it distract them, as they finished first in Group 8. The Republic of Ireland earned a play-off spot along with fifth-placed Bulgaria, courtesy of their Nations League performance. Reigning world champions France won Group 9 as expected, closely followed by a respectable Scottish side who will hope for the best in the play-offs along with a less favoured Lithuania.\n\nFinal standings of the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying group stage. ​\n\nControversies\n\nControversially, Austria, Bulgaria and Lithuania qualified for the play-offs despite performing worse than other teams in their respective groups, who didn't get a chance to participate in the play-offs. The problem was especially bad in Group 8, where Bulgaria finished as low as fifth. Subsequently, the Cypriot, Bosnian, Macedonian and Slovenian FAs directed criticism towards UEFA. Furthermore, several FAs expressed that the \"seeding was inadequate\", due to \"how much weaker some of the groups are than others\". On a different note, there were also concerns about fan violence or disruption in Group 8, due to its highly political nature, especially given the recent Yugoslav wars. Fortunately, none of the fears came to fruition.\n\nRanking of second-placed teams\n\nThe best runner-up qualified directly for the final tournament. Because not all groups had the same amount of teams, matches played against fifth-placed and sixth-placed teams were not counted, even though it would've been sufficient enough to discard the matches against the sixth-placed teams [2].\n\nAustria, Bulgaria, Finland, Greece, Lithuania, Poland, Russia and Switzerland also advanced to the play-offs via the Nations League.​\n\nTeam selection for the qualifying play-offs\n\nBased on the Nations League rankings, the 16 best teams that failed to qualify directly were selected to participate in the qualifying play-offs [3]. They would subsequently be allocated to four different play-off paths containing four teams, each featuring two semi-finals and one final to fill the four remaining spots for Euro 2000. For the play-off draw, the teams would be seeded according to the Nations League rankings. This was to prevent any one path from being significantly stronger than another.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n[1] Different matches were postponed in OTL, such as the Macedonia v Republic of Ireland match. However, due to the different qualifying schedule in TTL, that's not necessarily the case anymore.\n\n[2] It doesn't make sense in my opinion, but it is what UEFA did in OTL and I don't see any reason why they wouldn't have reached the same decision in TTL.\n\n[3] The team selection and path formation for the (Euro 2020) qualifying play-offs were different in OTL, being more based on Nations League group winners, regardless of the division they were in. This was quite unfair, as it made it so a group winner from League D was guaranteed a place at Euro 2020, while most non-group winners from League C would not even have a spot at the play-offs, despite being ranked higher on the Nations League overall rankings. UEFA presumably got away with it since it was a 24-team competition, meaning all decent to good teams qualified directly regardless. However, with a 16-team tournament, where the competition to qualify is much stiffer, that unfairness would be amplified to the point that it’s highly doubtful UEFA would’ve incorporated the same regulations when it comes to team selection and path formation for the play-offs. To put it into context, Latvia would be guaranteed a play-off spot while League A countries such as England and Germany would risk missing out altogether. It wouldn’t exactly be ASB for UEFA to reach such a controversial decision, but I still think it’s more probable the team selection would be made like this under the circumstances of TTL.\n\nPart 2 - A Lot at Stake\n\nUEFA Euro 2000 qualifying play-offs​\n\nDraw\n\nThe draw for the play-offs was held in Aachen, Germany on 22 November 1999, shortly after the conclusion of the qualifying group stage, while the play-off matches themselves would be played on 26 and 31 March 2000. There were also four separate draws to determine who would host each respective play-off final.\n\nSeeding\n\nThe 16 teams were seeded according to the November 1998 Nations League overall rankings for the qualifying play-offs draw. Some critics argued that it was \"unfair\" and \"didn't make sense to seed them based on the Nations League rankings\", as \"the overall rankings for the European qualifiers were more recent\" and thus \"more accurate\". UEFA subsequently stated that it made more sense to use the Nations League rankings as the 16 teams had qualified for the play-offs via the Nations League. All play-off paths would contain one team from each pot to make them as balanced as possible. The teams ranked 1 to 8 played in League A of the 1998-99 UEFA Nations League, while the teams ranked 9 to 16 played in League B.\n\nTeams seeded according to the November 1998 UEFA Nations League rankings.​\n\nThe draw resulted in the following play-off paths:\n\nThe winner of each play-off path qualified for UEFA Euro 2000.​\n\nIn each play-off semi-final, team 1 would play against team 4 and team 2 would face team 3, with the higher-ranked team hosting the match. Following a draw, these semi-final winners were allocated to host the play-off final:\n\nPath 1: Winner semi-final 2 (Scotland v Austria)\n\nPath 2: Winner semi-final 2 (Russia v Poland)\n\nPath 3: Winner semi-final 2 (Bulgaria v Ukraine)\n\nPath 4: Winner semi-final 1 (Norway v Republic of Ireland)\n\nPath 1\n\nIn the qualifiers, Israel had been good, not great, which perhaps made the silence at Hampden Park even more poignant than it would've normally been after Avi Nimni gave Israel the lead through a correctly awarded penalty. Scotland responded well, though, finding the equalizer through Don Hutchison mere minutes later. The rest of the match was completely in Scotland's favour, inching closer and closer to a leading goal. Just as the optimism in the stands about being close to breaking the deadlock was starting to be replaced by frustration about the second goal still not coming, Barry Ferguson made it 2-1 with 78:24 on the clock. Hampden Park went wild, as Scotland successfully saw the rest of the game out. The other semi-final was also dramatic. Croatia obtained the lead in the 29th minute thanks to a goal by Mario Stanić, which was successfully defended for the remainder of the first half - and the majority of the second. However, just as the clock passed 84 minutes, Stéphane Chapuisat made it 1-1. The extra time did not even see any hints of a decisive goal, sending the match to penalties. Davor Šuker's confident opening penalty set the tone for the rest of the shootout, which was won by the Croatians. Scotland and Croatia both qualified for Euro 1996 and the 1998 World Cup - who's tournament streak would end? Despite the expectations, the match itself was quite dull. You could tell a spot at a major tournament was at stake, with neither team willing to take any risks. Well, until the 71st minute, when quite a clumsy, albeit necessary challenge to prevent Billy Dodds from scoring, resulted in a Scottish penalty. The superstition says the fouled player shouldn't take the resulting penalty. Dodds didn't seem to care, as he gave Scotland the lead which ended up being enough to secure their ticket to Euro 2000. Hampden Park, Glasgow and all of Scotland somehow went even wilder than before.\n\nScotland qualified for Euro 2000.​\n\nPath 2\n\nRussia always appeared to have the upper hand against Poland, especially when backed by their home fans. Nevertheless, the first 45 minutes failed to produce any goals. However, 19 minutes into the second half, Yegor Titov sent Moscow into a frenzy. Poland fervently sought the equalizer, launching a final assault just as the fourth official displayed that three minutes would be added. Russia were emphatic on the counter-attack, making it 2-0 through Valery Karpin. The other semi-final was characterized by domination to an even greater extent. Jon Dahl Tomasson scored a brace in the first half, while Ebbe Sand managed the same feat in the second as Denmark put four goals past Lithuania in Copenhagen. For the play-off final, Denmark would have to leave their capital for Moscow. The Luzhniki Stadium was packed, and its roaring sound deafening when Vladimir Beschastnykh made it 1-0 Russia after almost exactly an hour had passed, following an opening half which left a lot to be desired. However, now the match appeared to have truly begun. It went back and forth, with both teams enjoying good chances. In the 88th minute, Tomasson capitalized on such a chance. Russia 1, Denmark 1. The extra time was a stark contrast, being completely lacking in entertainment and willingness to go forward. Denmark were victorious in the subsequent penalty shootout, stunning Moscow silent - except for the valiant Danish away fans.\n\nDenmark qualified for Euro 2000. ​\n\nPath 3\n\nUkraine's 1-0 win over Bulgaria in Sofia had a deceivingly close scoreline. Andriy Shevchenko could've just as easily scored two more goals in addition to the one he netted. In England's semi-final against Greece, The Three Lions managed to find one such additional goal through a trademark David Beckham, adding to the opener scored by Michael Owen in the first half. England were victorious in the end, but their ultimate fate would be decided in Kyiv. Just like with the other finals, you could tell a lot was at stake. The first half was completely lacking in entertaining football and anything resembling a dangerous attack. Paul Scholes decided to take matters into his own hands in the 63rd minute, hammering in the opening goal which ended up being decisive.\n\nEngland qualified for Euro 2000.\n\n​\n\nPath 4\n\nThe first semi-final was just what you'd expect a match between Norway and the Republic of Ireland to be - low-scoring but fiercely competitive and with a lot of close combat. Roy Keane seemed to enjoy it. However, Norway and their goalscorer Ståle Solbakken were probably happier in the end, as they were heading to the play-off final. Twenty-one minutes into the other semi-final, Jari Litmanen made Finland happy, giving the Finns a somewhat unexpected lead in Vienna. Austria fought back and found the equalizer almost exactly five minutes later thanks to Ivica Vastić. Following the match re-entering a deadlock, both teams became apprehensive and less willing to take risks, resulting in quite safe and boring football. The remainder of the match flew by without any major chances, and extra time loomed. In the 107th minute, Andi Herzog's golden goal set up Austria for an all-or-nothing final against Norway. As the first half of the match was nearing its end, the Norwegians were given a golden opportunity to take the lead from the penalty spot. Ole Gunnar Solskjær was never in doubt. However, as the second half began, the doubts crept in. Austria started off strongly, being rewarded with a goal by Vastić in the 51st minute. Fortunately for Norway, they collected themselves and made it 2-1 after 13 minutes through a goal by John Carew. Norway would be making their Euro debut.\n\nNorway qualified for Euro 2000.​\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nStay tuned for the next part and Euro 2000! Please let me know what you think of this timeline so far. I'm intrigued to hear your thoughts.\n\nPart 3 - Without Complications\n\nUEFA Euro 2000​\n\nDraw\n\nThe draw for the final tournament was conducted on 12 December 1999 in Brussels, Belgium. In accordance with UEFA's new regulations introduced in connection with the Nations League, defending champions Germany would not automatically be top seeded, just as had been the case in the qualifying draw. The identity of the four play-off winners was not known at the time of the draw. Ultimately, Scotland, Denmark, England and Norway secured the final four spots for Euro 2000.\n\nSeeding\n\nThe 16 teams were drawn into four groups of four, and were seeded according to the European Qualifiers overall rankings based on their results in UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying. Co-hosts Belgium and Netherlands were automatically assigned to Groups B and D respectively, while highest-ranked France were allocated to Group C.\n\nThe composition of the draw pots was as follows:\n\nPot 1: Group winners ranked 1-2 (and co-hosts Belgium and Netherlands)\n\nPot 2: Group winners ranked 3-6\n\nPot 3: Group winners ranked 7-9, best group runner-up (ranked 10 overall)\n\nPlay-off winners 1-4 (identity unknown when the draw was conducted)\n\nTeams seeded for the final draw of UEFA Euro 2000. ​\n\nGroup stage\n\nGroup A\n\nPortugal got a good start to the tournament, defeating Romania with a last-minute goal. This set the tone for the rest of their group stage, which saw them win 3-2 against England. This was followed by an even more emphatic 3-0 triumph over Germany. Despite having won the 1999 UEFA Nations League, Romania weren't favoured to reach the quarter-finals. However, they proved the doubters wrong by first drawing 1-1 with Germany and then participating in a flashy five-goal encounter against England, which was won 3-2. England had a tournament to forget, despite the win over Germany, while the campaign of Die Mannschaft could be considered disastrous [1].\n\nUEFA Euro 2000 - Group A final standings.\n\nWikipedia contributors. (2023, January 6). UEFA Euro 2000. In Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. Retrieved 15:35, January 21, 2023, from https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UEFA_Euro_2000&oldid=1132028901\n\nGroup B\n\nEveryone seemed to defeat everyone in this group. Co-hosts Belgium got off to a flying start by sensationally defeating Spain. However, in the end it didn't mean much, following the Red Devil's subsequent losses to Scotland and Italy. Contrastingly, Spain ultimately topped the group due to being triumphant 2-1 against Italy, and being on the right end of the 3-2 match versus Scotland. Italy's 2-1 win against Scotland and 2-0 victory over co-hosts Belgium made sure their loss to Spain ultimately didn't matter in the end. However, it meant they would have to settle with being in second, not first. Scotland had a respectable campaign, suffering narrow losses to Italy and Spain but managing to eclipse Belgium [2].\n\nUEFA Euro 2000 - Group B final standings. ​\n\nGroup C\n\nThe group started off with a spectacular 3-3 draw between FR Yugoslavia and world champions France, both of home advanced to the quarter-finals. France did so by putting two unanswered goals past Norway and beating Turkey 2-1. FR Yugoslavia failed to break down Turkey in a boring 0-0 affair, but managed to break the deadlock against Norway and win 1-0. On the first matchday, Norway managed just that against Turkey, but it wasn't enough for them to advance. Turkey's only point came in that dull goalless draw against FR Yugoslavia [3].\n\nUEFA Euro 2000 - Group C final standings. ​\n\nGroup D\n\nCo-hosts Netherlands soared to first place without complications, defeating Sweden and the Czech Republic 2-1, while they convincingly netted thrice against Denmark. The Czech Republic's road to second place was similarly straightforward, comfortably winning 2-0 over Denmark and narrowly edging past Sweden in a thrilling 2-1 encounter. The loss to the Netherlands ultimately did little to dampen the mood. Sweden were happy to have won the Scandinavian derby, but the other two close defeats cost them a place in the quarter-finals. To be blunt, Denmark had a really bad display overall. Zero wins, zero goals [4].\n\nUEFA Euro 2000 - Group D final standings. ​\n\nKnockout stage\n\nQuarter-finals\n\nIn the 33rd minute, Francesco Totti gave Italy the lead against Portugal in the first quarter-final [5]. Portugal kept their head in the game, equalizing through Nuno Gomes right on the stroke of half-time. The second half and subsequent 30 minutes of extra time were characterized by a greater degree of hesitancy, despite not being completely starved of good chances and entertaining football. Nevertheless, this match would be decided by a penalty shootout. Italy proved to be more potent, Totti scoring the decisive goal, just as he had earlier in the match. Speaking of penalties, that's exactly how Gaizka Mendieta gave Spain the lead against Romania in Brussels. Viorel Moldovan equalized around the hour-mark and extra-time loomed. However, Raúl made it 2-1 with the last kick of the game, sending Spain to the semi-finals. The Netherlands completely annihilated FR Yugoslavia 6-1. Patrick Kluivert scored a hattrick, while Marc Overmars would have to settle with a brace. In addition to that, Dejan Govedarica had the misfortune of scoring an own goal. Savo Milošević's late strike only served as consolation. The co-hosts were in the semi-finals [6]. Thierry Henry gave France an early lead versus the Czech Republic, but the Czechs and more specifically Karel Poborský made it 1-1 from the penalty spot in the 35th minute. The match was tied at half-time and for 15 minutes into the second, when Youri Djorkaeff restored France's lead. It ended up being the winning goal [7].\n\nSemi-finals and final\n\nMarco Delvecchio may have felt as he'd placed Italy in the final when he opened the scoring in the 55th minute. These feelings likely become more and more pronounced as the minutes went by, inching closer to the final whistle. It wasn't until the 94th minute when Sylvain Wiltord shattered Italian hearts and sent the match to extra-time. There, David Trezeguet became a hero for France as he made sure Le Bleus were victorious thanks to a golden goal [8]. The other semi-final wasn't nearly as dramatic. A simple but crucial Patrick Kluivert goal secured the Netherlands a place in the final.\n\nIn the final, Christophe Dugarry opened the scoring for France early on, stunning the home crowd of mostly Dutch fans silent. Kluivert made sure this silence didn't last long, though, equalizing less than six minutes later. Trezeguet again rose to the occasion, just like he had done in the semi-finals against Italy. At half-time the score was France 2, Netherlands 1. One can only speculate about what was said during the break, because the dutch appeared rejuvenated. Frank de Boer equalized six minutes into the second half, while Boudewijn Zenden scored what proved to be the winning goal in the 59th minute [9]. The Netherlands had won their second Euro title in history.\n\nUEFA Euro 2000 - knockout stage​\n\n-------------\n\nNOTICE: As I realised it makes much more sense for there to be four play-off paths instead of three, I’ve now made those edits to previous parts, along with any other adjustments that were necessary to maintain the continuity. This means an entirely new play-off path has been introduced, so even if you’ve read the preceding parts already I suggest you have a look at them again now that they’re revised. However, note that these changes ultimately did NOT affect the final teams that qualified for Euro 2000, nor the seeding. So frustrating when you try thinking of everything but something slips by. Oh well, with 40 parts (including my Nations League timeline), I guess it was inevitable that a minor error like this would happen at some point. Also, it’s comically ironic that one of the parts were named ‘Disruption’.\n\n[1] Group identical to OTL. As a result, the image used is from the real Wikipedia page about Euro 2000, hence the image attribution. Additionally, while the group is identical to OTL, that's not necessarily the case when it comes to the match schedule, as not all teams were in the same seeding pots in TTL. This is also true when it comes to the other groups.\n\n[2] The following Group B matches were identical in OTL: Italy 2-0 Belgium.\n\n[3] The following Group C matches were identical in OTL: Norway 0-1 FR Yugoslavia.\n\n[4] The following Group D matches were identical in OTL: Denmark 0-2 Czech Republic, Czech Republic 1-2 Netherlands, Denmark 0-3 Netherlands.\n\n[5] Note that the matches are addressed in chronological order.\n\n[6] Match identical in OTL.\n\n[7] Match identical in OTL, except it was played in the group stage, not knockout stage.\n\n[8] Match identical in OTL, except it was the final, not a semi-final.\n\n[9] Match identical in OTL, except it was played in the group stage, not knockout stage.\n\nPart 4 - Critical ​\n\n2002 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA draw and group stage​\n\nEuropean Qualifiers ​\n\nThe group phase qualifying matches were played from March to November 2001 [1], while the qualifying play-offs took place in December of the same year. UEFA originally wanted the play-offs to be played in March 2002 to avoid fixture congestion, but FIFA didn’t permit it as they wanted the identity of all teams to be known when the draw for the final tournament was conducted in December 2001 [2]. France qualified automatically as the defending champions. The nine group winners qualified directly, while the best runner-up participated in the inter-confederation play-off [3]. A couple of AFC members were critical of the way UEFA decided which team they would send to the inter-confederation play-offs, arguing that it was “insulting” that the best runner-up qualified like it was a “reward” to play against a team outside Europe instead of the UEFA play-offs. The eight other runner-ups and eight best teams based on the Nations League overall rankings who finished outside the top two in their qualifying groups formed four play-off paths to determine the four remaining UEFA spots for the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\nDraw​\n\nThe draw was conducted on 7 December 2000 in Zurich, Switzerland [4]. The 50 participating teams were divided into eight pots based on the November 2000 Nations League overall rankings [5]. France (ranked 3rd) were not present due to automatically qualifying as defending champions. The other three participants of the 2001 UEFA Nations League Finals (Italy, Portugal and Sweden) would be allocated to a separate pot and drawn into Groups 1-4, which only had five teams. This meant they would only have to play eight qualifying matches, leaving two matchdays free to play in the Nations League Finals. Similarly, the four League C teams that would play in the interleague play-offs in March 2001 were also allocated to five-team groups (and placed in the Interleague Pot for that purpose). The two League D teams which would participate in the interleague play-offs had to play in six-team groups, as there weren’t enough groups with five teams. Andorra made their World Cup qualifying debut.\n\nParticipating teams seeded according to the November 2000 UEFA Nations League overall rankings.​\n\n​\n\nGroup Summary​\n\nEngland won Group 1, comfortably clear of second-placed FR Yugoslavia, who would have to hope for the best in the play-offs. Group 2 was the textbook definition of a two-horse race. Portugal and the Republic of Ireland were both tied on 20 points, only dropping points against each other and having to be separated by goal difference. In the end, the Republic of Ireland advanced to the inter-confederation play-offs as the best runner-up, while neighbouring Wales advanced to the UEFA play-offs. Italy topped Group 3 as expected, while the Czech Republic and Bulgaria earned spots in the play-offs. Group 4 was really competitive, with winners Sweden and third-placed Finland only being separated by a single point. The latter of whom advanced to the play-offs along with runners-up Russia. Reigning Euro champions the Netherlands won Group 5, followed by Poland in second. Meanwhile, Norway got the unflattering record of being the worst-performing team to advance to the play-offs, even being eclipsed by Belarus. Group 6 was really competitive at the top. Winners Croatia finished with 24 points, followed by Ukraine and Scotland who obtained 23 and 21 points respectively. Group 7 was less nail-biting. Spain won it easily, while Denmark finished in second ahead of Israel. In Group 8, Belgium finished one point clear of runners-up Romania. Slovenia also did enough to secure a ticket to the play-offs. Ahead of the final matchday, either of the three teams could’ve won the group. Group 9 was another highly competitive two-horse race. One would think that Turkey's superb goal difference was enough to grant them a first-place finish, but Germany were marginally superior. Turkey would have to try their chances in the play-offs, along with Austria.\n\nFinal standings of the European Qualifiers for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. ​\n\n​\n\nRanking of second-placed teams ​\n\nThe best runner-up qualified for the inter-confederation play-offs, while the eight other runners-up advanced to the UEFA play-offs along with the eight best teams from the Nations League who failed to at least finish second in their qualifying group. Because not all groups had the same amount of teams, matches played against sixth-placed teams were not counted.\n\nEight additional teams qualified for the UEFA play-offs via the Nations League. ​\n\nTeam selection for the qualifying play-offs​\n\nBased on the November 2000 Nations League rankings, the eight best teams that failed to finish higher than second in their qualifying groups advanced to the UEFA play-offs along with eight of the runners-up. The 16 teams would subsequently be allocated to four different play-off paths containing four teams, each featuring two semi-finals and one final to fill the remaining four UEFA slots for the 2002 World Cup.\n\nGermany were the lowest-ranked team to qualify directly.\n\n​\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[1] In OTL, the matches were played from September 2000 to October 2001.\n\n[2] In OTL, the final tournament draw was also conducted in December, but a couple of weeks earlier.\n\n[3] In OTL, the UEFA team which would participate in the inter-confederation play-offs (instead of the UEFA play-offs) was determined in connection with the play-off draw in August 2001 (oddly before the completion of the qualifying group stage). In TTL, it’s more probable that this would’ve been decided based on the ranking of second-placed teams, due to how different the UEFA play-offs are in TTL. Nevertheless, the Republic of Ireland also reached that stage in OTL, so it doesn't affect the outcome regardless. Additionally, it's worth noting that the inter-confederation play-offs will be played in December in TTL, not November as in OTL.\n\n[4] In OTL, the draw was conducted in December 1999.\n\n[5] FIFA first used their World Rankings in seeding for the European Qualifiers for the 1998 World Cup. Oddly, this practice was discontinued for the qualifiers of the 2002 and 2006 tournaments in favour of UEFA national team coefficients (FIFA Rankings made a return for the 2010 edition and onward). Since the Nations League rankings replaced the coefficients as a seeding method in both OTL and TTL, it's likely they would've been used to seed the European Qualifiers for the 2002 and 2006 World Cups in TTL instead of the FIFA rankings or any other ranking system.\n\nPart 5 - Charged​\n\n2002 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA play-offs and UEFA-AFC play-off​\n\nDraw\n\nThe draw for the UEFA play-offs was held on 30 November 2001 [1] at FIFA’s headquarters in Zürich, Switzerland, while the matches themselves would be played on 13 and 18 December. During that international break, the inter-confederation play-offs also took place [2]. A couple of UEFA members expressed criticism that the duration between the play-off draw and matches was too short. There were also four separate draws to determine who would host each respective play-off final.\n\nFor the play-off draw, the following procedure was applied:\n\nIn the order drawn, the eight seeded teams were assigned to semi-finals 1 to 8 as the host team\n\nIn the order drawn, the eight unseeded teams were assigned to semi-finals 1 to 8 as the away team\n\nSemi-finals 1 and 2 formed play-off Path 1\n\nSemi-finals 3 and 4 formed play-off Path 2\n\nSemi-finals 5 and 6 formed play-off Path 3\n\nSemi-finals 7 and 8 formed play-off Path 4\n\nThe semi-final winners that host play-off finals 1, 2, 3 and 4 were decided by a draw\n\nSeeding\n\nThe eight qualifying runners-up were seeded in pot 1 based on their performance in the qualifiers, while the eight teams that qualified via the Nations League were unseeded in pot 2 according to the November 2000 Nations League rankings.\n\nTeams seeded ahead of the draw for the UEFA play-offs. ​\n\nPath 1\n\nEven on home soil, the more favoured Czech side failed to break down Finland. However, the Czech Republic’s potency in the penalty shootout was enough to earn them a place in the play-off final. The other semi-final was no blistering affair either. Marius Niculae gave Romania the lead in the 22nd minute and Israel never found the equalizer. The play-off final was a similar story, as the Czech goal drought continued while Cosmin Contra's 75th-minute goal for the Romanians was unanswered [3].\n\nRomania qualified for the 2002 World Cup.​\n\nPath 2\n\nDenmark emphatically defeated Austria in Copenhagen with four different goalscorers; Ebbe Sand, Jon Dahl Tomasson, Dennis Rommedahl and Thomas Gravesen. In Istanbul, Turkey enjoyed a similarly comfortable win against Wales. Yıldıray Baştürk opened the scoring after less than 11 minutes, while Hakan Şükür added a second around the half-hour mark. The Turks kept having the upper hand in the second half, but John Hartson scored a consolation goal for Wales against the run of play. Still, Okan Buruk made it 3-1 in the 65th minute, ultimately securing Turkey a spot in the play-off final versus Denmark. In said final, Tomasson sent Copenhagen into delirium when he opened the scoring for Denmark early on, a scoreline which remained for the remainder of the first half. However, Arif Erdem brought Turkey right back into the game in the 71st minute. Extra time loomed, where Şükür's brilliant diving header made it 2-1 for Turkey. In the era of the golden goal, it meant the match was over and that the Turks had secured a ticket to their first World Cup since 1954 [4].\n\nTurkey qualified for the 2002 World Cup.​\n\nPath 3\n\nThe first semi-final was an even affair that could've been won by either side. In the end, Hennadiy Zubov's goal for Ukraine was enough to eclipse Scotland. The other semi-final was more one-sided, as goals from Vladimir Beschastnykh, Yegor Titov and Aleksandr Shirko earned Russia an easy win over Norway. The play-off final was very charged, both politically and sportingly. Ukraine had only achieved independence from the Soviet Union around 10 year earlier. On top of this, Ukraine and Russia were in the same Euro 2000 qualifying group. The visiting Russians obtained the lead in the 19th minute after a goal from Beschastnykh, only for Andriy Shevchenko to equalize in the dying seconds of the first half. The second half was highly energetic but lacked great goalscoring opportunities. This was also the case during extra time, but to an even greater extent. In Euro 2000 qualifying, Russia lost a penalty shootout (against Denmark) to miss out on the final tournament. This time, history heartbreakingly repeated itself for the Russians, while Ukraine qualified for their first-ever major tournament [5].\n\nUkraine qualified for the 2002 World Cup. ​\n\nPath 4\n\nPoland were triumphant over Bulgaria in Chorzów without any real hassle, as Emmanuel Olisadebe, Marcin Żewłakow and Radosław Kałużny got on the scoresheet. The other semi-final came down to the wire. Željko Milinovič gave the visiting Slovenians a somewhat surprising lead in Belgrade, but Predrag Đorđević equalized for FR Yugoslavia [6] in the 51st minute. The remainder of the match didn't see any additional goals, nor did extra time. Slovenia won the politically charged penalty shootout. Fortunately, the tension in and off the stands never resulted in any violence. The final was uniquely moved to a different city than in the semi-final, to the capital Warsaw. Slovenia again obtained an away lead, this time through Mladen Rudonja, only for Olisadebe to make it 1-1 shortly afterwards. The scoreline lasted for the remainder of the first half, and the entire second one plus extra time. In yet another penalty shootout in these play-off paths, Poland secured their ticket to the World Cup, while Slovenia fell short at the finish line [7].\n\nPoland qualified for the 2002 World Cup. ​\n\n​\n\nUEFA-AFC play-off\n\nIn Dublin, Robbie Keane gave the Republic of Ireland the lead early into the second half [8]. Some heroic saves from Shay Given made sure the Irish were victorious in the first leg. His great form persisted in the second leg, but Yahya Golmohammadi equalized for Iran on aggregate in the dying minutes. Psychologically devastating for Ireland. The extra time was lacking in solid chances and entertaining football, perhaps because of the fear of opening yourself up to counter-attacks and losing because of the golden goal rule. Whatever the reason was, this match would be decided by penalties. The shootout just gave Given another chance to be a hero. Ireland won in Teheran in front of 100,000 spectators, mostly Iranians.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland qualified for the 2002 World Cup. ​\n\n-----------\n\n[1] The draw was conducted on 31 August 2001 in OTL.\n\n[2] The UEFA-AFC play-off was played in November in OTL.\n\n[3] Romania failed to qualify in OTL.\n\n[4] Denmark qualified in OTL.\n\n[5] Russia qualified in OTL, while Ukraine failed to qualify.\n\n[6] On an entirely different note, OTL saw FR Yugoslavia being banned from playing home matches in October 2000 due to the disruption caused by the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević. However, due to the qualifying matches being played at later dates in TTL, it never affects the qualifying matches here. Still, it does affect the 2000-01 Nations League, specifically causing the FR Yugoslavia v Portugal match to be played in November instead of October.\n\n[7] Slovenia qualified in OTL.\n\n[8] The Republic of Ireland won the Dublin match 2-0 in OTL.\n\nPart 6 - Enough​\n\n2002 FIFA World Cup​\n\nThe 2002 FIFA World Cup was the 17th edition of the tournament and the first to take place in Asia, being hosted by Japan and South Korea. The draw for the final tournament was conducted on 21 December 2001 [1] in Busan, South Korea.\n\nGroup stage [2]\n\nGroup A\n\nIn Group A [3], The defending champions France got an underwhelming start to the tournament, dropping points in a 1-1 draw against World Cup debutants Senegal [4]. However, order was restored when they defeated Uruguay 1-0 in the next match [5]. This ultimately wasn’t enough, though, as Romania sensationally won 2-1 against Le Bleus on the final matchday to send the champions packing. The Romanians had previously replicated that scoreline versus Uruguay, only to lose 1-0 against Senegal thanks to a missed penalty and a goal being incorrectly disallowed for offside. Thankfully for Romania, they still did enough to advance to the knockout stage, as did Senegal, despite dropping a 3-0 lead over Uruguay in their third match. The South American side had a tournament to forget.\n\nFinal standings of Group A. ​\n\nGroup B\n\nThe group [6] was blessed with some high-scoring games. Spain topped it by drawing 2-2 with the Netherlands, and beating Paraguay and South Africa 3-1 and 3-2 respectively. The Netherlands drew 2-2 with Paraguay as well, having previously defeated South Africa 2-1 to clinch a spot in the knockout stage. The match between Paraguay and South Africa also finished 2-2, with both sides failing to advance in the end.\n\nFinal standings of Group B.​\n\nGroup H\n\nGroup H [7] saw co-hosts Japan start off with a blistering 2-2 draw against Belgium. This was followed by a 1-0 win over debutants Ukraine, where they in fairness received a lot of help from the referee. Nevertheless, Japan’s subsequent 2-0 victory against Tunisia ultimately made them worthy group winners. Belgium joined them in the round of 16, following a 1-1 draw versus Tunisia and a spectacular 3-2 triumph over Ukraine, who were decent, but quite unlucky throughout the tournament. Tunisia had a World Cup to forget.\n\nFinal standings of Group H. ​\n\nKnockout stage [8]\n\nRomania\n\nRomania had become somewhat of a bogey team for England in recent years, having defeated The Three Lions at the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000, not to mention impressively winning their group at this tournament. However, the tides turned for England, who ran out 3-0 victors with unexpected ease, following goals from Rio Ferdinand, Michael Owen and Emile Heskey.\n\nNetherlands\n\nPatrick Kluivert opened the scoring for the Netherlands against rivals Germany in the round of 16. For long it appeared that this was the decisive goal, but Oliver Neuville had other plans, equalizing for Die Mannschaft in the 88th minute. Oliver Kahn had made some heroic saves in the group stage and throughout the match. This persisted during extra time, but it was unsustainable for the Germans, as the Dutch created more and more dangerous chances. Eventually, the Netherlands found the golden goal through Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. Germany could add another disappointing major tournament to their recent record, while Oranje were heading to the quarter-finals.\n\nThere, the Netherlands enjoyed a much more straightforward win over the United States, as Roy Maakay and Andy van der Meyde got on the scoresheet. Ahead of the semi-final, there were big talks about South Korea’s coach Guus Hiddink. A Dutchman coaching a national team against the Netherlands made for a really interesting storyline. Would his knowledge of Dutch football result in another upset win for the Koreans? While it probably helped, it wasn’t enough. Edgar Davies’ goal in the 71st minute secured the Netherlands a place in their third-ever World Cup final. Would the defending Euro champions join the exclusive club of having won back-to-back major titles, and becoming world champions? As it turns out, no. The Netherlands were not bad, but Brazil still had that extra level, winning thanks to a 79th-minute goal by Ronaldo.\n\nKnockout stage of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. ​\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nThat’s the first World Cup of this TL completed! I promise this is not a Dutchwank. I don’t have any links to the Netherlands. Their success in TTL so far is mostly coincidental and goes to show how fine the line between an underwhelming and successful era is.\n\n[1] The final draw was conducted on 1 December in OTL.\n\n[2] Only groups that are different from OTL are shown. The rest unfolded exactly as in OTL.\n\n[3] Denmark was in the group instead of Romania in OTL.\n\n[4] France lost 1-0 in OTL. While France still flopped in TTL, I don’t think they’d flop as much as in OTL, due to the additional competitive experience gained from playing in the 2000-01 Nations League. Keep in mind that they didn’t need to play any qualifying matches due to being defending champions. This lack of competitive experience is likely part of the reason why they were so abysmal at the 2002 World Cup in OTL. However, I don’t think this logic is applicable to the other UEFA teams, as they still participated in the qualifiers, meaning the benefits of the experience gained from playing in the Nations League are comparably much more negligible. Doing so would also risk turning this TL into a UEFA wank, which I don’t want to. “Sweden’s additional experience gained from the Nations League enabled them to pick up a comfortable 2-0 win over Senegal in the last 16”, “Due to the added experience gained in the Nations League, England managed to find the winning goal against Nigeria and ultimately topped Group F”, etc.\n\n[5] The match finished 0-0 in OTL.\n\n[6] Slovenia was in the group instead of the Netherlands in OTL.\n\n[7] Russia was in the group instead of Ukraine in OTL.\n\n[8] The knockout stage section will only follow teams that are new in TTL.\n\nPart 7 - Redundant​\n\nUEFA Euro 2004 qualifying draw and group stage​\n\nUEFA Euro 2004 qualifying\n\nThe group phase qualifying matches were played from March to November 2003, while the play-offs were to take place in March 2004, despite discussions of placing them in December 2003 (as with the qualifying play-offs for the 2002 FIFA World Cup) so the identity of all the teams would be known when the final tournament draw was conducted. Alongside hosts Portugal, the 10 group winners and best runner-up qualified directly. In total, there were 10 qualifying groups: nine groups with five teams and one group with six teams. The four remaining spots were determined by four play-off paths formed based on performances in the 2002-03 UEFA Nations League.\n\nDraw\n\nThe qualifying draw was conducted in December 2002 in Porto, Portugal. The 51 participating teams were divided into five seeding pots based on the November 2002 Nations League overall rankings. As all groups except one would have five teams, UEFA deemed it “redundant” to have a UNL Pot and Interleague Pot as in the preceding qualifying draw. However, the teams participating in the 2003 Nations League Finals in June and Interleague play-offs in March respectively were still marked so they would be allocated to a five-team group and thus have a free matchday to participate in the competitions mentioned above. Additionally, San Marino, the lowest-ranked team, was automatically assigned to the six-team group. Portugal (ranked 6th) were not present due to having already qualified for the final tournament as hosts. Kazakhstan, having switched confederations from AFC to UEFA earlier in the year, made their European qualifiers debut [1]. FR Yugoslavia notably changed its name to Serbia and Montenegro on 4 February 2003, between when the draw was conducted and the qualifying group stage began.\n\nTeams seeded for the qualifying draw. ​\n\nGroup Summary\n\nFrance convincingly won Group 1 with a superb goal difference, while Russia and Slovenia advanced to the play-offs via the Nations League. Group 2 was a close one ultimately topped by Denmark. Romania and Norway would have to hope for the best in the play-offs. The defending champions Netherlands were triumphant in Group 3 without too much hassle, followed by Austria and Israel who would accompany each other in the play-offs. Sweden beat Bulgaria by one point to top Group 4. Latvia exceeded expectations, but were ultimately eliminated from qualifying contention. Bulgaria would at least have a second chance in the play-offs. Group 5 was also competitive at the top. Germany barely managed to win it in the end, closely followed by Scotland and Belgium, who did well enough in the 2002-03 Nations League to earn a play-off spot. Greece beat the odds, and Spain, to win Group 6. Fortunately for the Spaniards, they still did enough to qualify directly as the best runner-up. Wales’ Nations League performance earned them a play-off spot, while Ukraine barely missed out. England got the job done and topped Group 7 ahead of play-off-bound Switzerland. The Czech golden generation was victorious in Group 8. Croatia and Poland would have to try their chances in the play-offs. Italy won Group 9 with ease, despite suffering an upset loss to Serbia and Montenegro, who advanced to the play-offs alongside Finland. Group 10 was narrowly won by Turkey, with the Republic of Ireland, who were heading to the play-offs, not far behind.\n\nFinal standings of the qualifying group stage. ​\n\nRanking of second-placed teams\n\nThe best runner-up qualified directly for the final tournament. To make the rankings fair, matches against the sixth-placed team in Group 10 were not counted.\n\nBelgium, Finland, Wales, Norway, Poland, Israel and Slovenia also qualified for the play-offs via the Nations League. ​\n\nTeam selection for the qualifying play-offs\n\nBased on the November 2002 Nations League overall rankings, the 16 best teams that failed to qualify directly were selected to participate in the qualifying play-offs. They would subsequently be allocated to four different play-off paths containing four teams, each featuring two semi-finals and one final to fill the four remaining spots for Euro 2004. There were discussions about changing the team selection for the qualifying play-offs to be more in line with how they had been for the 2002 World Cup. Specifically, the runners-up would automatically qualify for the play-offs, as opposed to exclusively relying on their Nations League performance. No changes were made, though [2].\n\nGreece unexpectedly qualified directly despite their low ranking.​\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nBack with part 7! Please let me know what you think of this TL so far. See you in the next part, where the qualifying play-offs will conclude.\n\n[1] In OTL, Kazakhstan made their European qualifiers debut for the 2006 World Cup.\n\n[2] While FIFA allowed UEFA to partially incorporate the Nations League in the qualifying for the World Cup, they only allowed it to have limited influence. Not as much as in the Euro qualifiers, where UEFA would want their new competition to play a bigger part to, among other things, promote it.\n\nPart 8 - An Early Lead ​\n\nUEFA Euro 2004 qualifying play-offs ​\n\nDraw\n\nThe draw for the play-offs was held on 24 November 2003 in Frankfurt, Germany, shortly after the completion of the Euro 2004 qualifying group stage, while the play-off matches themselves would be played on 25 and 30 March 2004.\n\nSeeding\n\nThe 16 teams were seeded according to the November 2002 Nations League overall rankings. All play-off paths would contain one team from each pot to make them as balanced as possible. The teams ranked 1 to 5 played in League A of the 2002-03 UEFA Nations League, while the teams ranked 6 to 16 played in League B.\n\nTeams seeded ahead of the play-off draw.\n\n​\n\nThe draw resulted in the following play-off paths:\n\nThe winner of each play-off path qualified for Euro 2004. ​\n\nIn each play-off semi-final, team 1 would play against team 4 and team 2 would face team 3, with the higher-ranked team hosting the match. Following a draw, these semi-final winners were allocated to host the play-off final:\n\nPath 1: Winner semi-final 2 (Switzerland v Scotland)\n\nPath 2: Winner semi-final 1 (Belgium v Slovenia)\n\nPath 3: Winner semi-final 2 (Finland v Norway)\n\nPath 4: Winner semi-final 2 (Bulgaria v Wales)\n\nPath 1\n\nHakan Yakin gave Switzerland the lead against Scotland in the 38th minute. Shortly into the second half, this lead was extended by Alexander Frei, only for James McFadden to ignite a spark of hope for Scotland. It was ultimately only a consolation goal, though. Switzerland won 2-1. In the other semi-final, Ian Harte opened the scoring for the Republic of Ireland early into the second half after some dull opening 45 minutes. As added time began, Robbie Keane added a second in what was quite a comfortable win for the Irish. However, the tables turned in the crucial play-off final. The successful recipe of Yakin and Frei again made sure Switzerland were victorious, earning them a place at Euro 2004.\n\nSwitzerland qualified for Euro 2004. ​\n\nPath 2\n\nAs the game was settling, Wesley Sonck gave Belgium the lead against Slovenia. Around the hour-mark, Thomas Buffel added a second to earn the Belgians a place in the play-off final. Slovenia were uncharacteristically bleak, as were Austria in the other semi-final. Romania made it 1-0 then 2-0 through Christian Shivy and Daniel Pancu, while Roland Kollmann’s consolation goal came far too late for Austria. In the final against Romania, Sonck added another to his and Belgium’s tally in the 32nd minute, only for Adrian Mutu to equalize nine minutes later. Romania maintained the initiative in the second half, taking the lead through Ionel Dănciulescu in the 67th minute. But the game was far from over, as Bart Goor made it 2-2 close to 20 minutes later. However, the Belgians had barely stopped celebrating before Pancu restored Romania’s lead just as the fourth official was displaying the amount of added time. Romania defied their seemingly bleak prospects and qualified thanks to two consecutive away wins.\n\nRomania qualified for Euro 2004. ​\n\nPath 3\n\nThis path was undoubtedly the least entertaining of the four. Norway edged past Finland 1-0 in Helsinki thanks to a Martin Andresen penalty. Croatia managed the same feat at home against Poland, as Dado Pršo found the back of the net. The final was hardly more blistering, despite containing much more drama. Steffen Iversen sent Oslo into a frenzy when he opened the scoring for the Norwegians in the 14th. Coincidentally, it was 14 minutes into the second half when Darijo Srna dampened the mood for the home team. Norway 1, Croatia 1 - a scoreline which could not be broken during the remainder of the match including extra time. Croatia proved more potent from the penalty spot, securing their ticket to Euro 2004.\n\nCroatia qualified for Euro 2004. ​\n\nPath 4\n\nDimitar Berbatov gave Bulgaria an early lead against Wales through a correctly awarded penalty, only for Jason Koumas to equalize shortly afterward. The deadlock failed to be broken in the first half. However, Berbatov added a second and made it 2-1 Bulgaria in the 54th minute, a scoreline which remained unchanged. In the other semi-final, Zvonimir Vukić gave his visiting Serbia and Montenegro an early lead versus Russia, who responded well and made it 1-1 not long thereafter through Vadim Evseev. Forty minutes into the second half, Dmitri Bulykin scored what proved to be the decisive goal for Russia. Another “Dimitri” announced himself in the play-off final against Bulgaria - Sychev, who opened the scoring for Russia in the ninth minute. Bulgaria’s young talisman Berbatov equalized just five minutes later, only for Sychev to secure his brace later in the first half. However, Berbatov intended to score yet another brace, doing just that as he made it 2-2 in the 67th minute. The match didn’t see any additional goals. At least not away from the penalty spot. Russia had fallen on the finish line in the qualifiers for Euro 2000 and the 2002 World Cup. Dimitar Berbatov had been impeccable for his Bulgaria throughout the qualifiers. However, fate proved to be cruel. He missed Bulgaria’s deciding penalty.\n\nRussia qualified for Euro 2004. ​\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nBack with another part. Euro 2004 is on the verge of completion. Stay tuned to see how it turns out! As always, let me know your thoughts if you feel like sharing.\n\nPart 9 - Other Plans​\n\nUEFA Euro 2004​\n\nDraw\n\nThe draw for the final tournament was conducted on 30 November 2003 in Lisbon, Portugal, before the identity of the four play-off winners was known. In the end, Switzerland, Romania, Croatia and Russia secured the final four spots for Euro 2004. As with every Euro tournament since the 2000 edition, the defending champions (Netherlands) were not automatically top seeded.\n\nSeeding\n\nThe 16 teams were drawn into four groups of four, and were seeded according to the European Qualifiers overall rankings based on their results in UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying. As hosts, Portugal were automatically assigned to Group A.\n\nThe composition of the draw pots was as follows:\n\nPot 1: Group winners ranked 1-3 (and hosts Portugal)\n\nPot 2: Group winners ranked 4-7\n\nPot 3: Group winners ranked 8-10, best group runner-up (ranked 11 overall)\n\nPot 4: Play-off winners 1-4 (identity unknown when the draw was conducted)\n\nTeams seeded ahead of the group stage draw. ​\n\nGroup stage\n\nGroup A\n\nHosts Portugal breezed through the group, beating Turkey 2-1, defeating Russia 2-0 and edging past their Iberian neighbours Spain 1-0. La Roja still did enough to advance with their wins over Russia and Turkey, which saw scorelines of 1-0 and 2-1 respectively. Russia’s 2-1 triumph over Turkey was their only highlight of the tournament, while the Turks lost all matches 2-1 in what can only be described as a fiasco [1].\n\nFinal standings of Group A of Euro 2004. ​\n\nGroup B\n\nSweden got off to a flying start, not least because of Henrik Larsson’s flying header in the 3-0 win over Switzerland. England replicated that scoreline against the Swiss, having previously lost 2-1 to France thanks to two late goals. On the other hand, Sweden’s 1-1 draw saw them at least pick up a point against Le Bleus thanks to a late equalizer. The drama between England and Sweden on the final matchday was even greater, though. Thanks to yet another late equalizer, Sweden managed to draw 2-2 with the English, effectively eliminating The Three Lions. Meanwhile, France’s 3-1 win over Switzerland saw them win the group [2].\n\nFinal standings of Group B of Euro 2004. ​\n\nGroup C\n\nThis group was somehow even more dramatic. Denmark and Italy started off with a goalless draw, as the Netherlands won against Romania thanks to a single goal. Denmark also managed to eclipse Romania. The scoreline was 2-1 after their last-minute winner. Meanwhile, Italy and the Netherlands drew 1-1. The stakes were high ahead of the final matchday, with Denmark, the Netherlands and Italy all having chances to advance or even win the group. Oranje’s late equalizer versus the surprisingly impressive Danes was enough to see Italy be eliminated, despite them ultimately winning 2-1 against Romania with a late goal. The top three sides all had five points [3].\n\nFinal standings of Group C of Euro 2004. ​\n\nGroup D\n\nThe ‘group of life’ ended up being a ‘group of death’ for Germany, who finished in fourth following a goalless draw with Croatia, a 1-0 loss to Greece, and a 2-1 defeat against the Czech Republic. Contrastingly, the Czechs were great and deservedly won the group. Despite their underwhelming opening 1-1 draw versus Greece, the blistering 3-2 victory over Croatia and solid 2-1 win against Germany was more than enough. Croatia’s 2-1 triumph over Greece on the final matchday saw them advance to the quarter-finals by the skin of their teeth [4].\n\nFinal standings of Group D of Euro 2004. ​\n\nKnockout stage\n\nQuarter-finals\n\nCristiano Ronaldo opened the scoring for Portugal against Sweden in the 33rd minute. Throughout the match, well into the second half, it appeared to be the winning goal. Henrik Larsson took matters into his own feet in the 86th minute, cutting into the penalty area and setting Zlatan Ibrahimovic up for an easy tap-in. The game still didn’t go to extra time, however, as Nuno Gomes headed in a corner kick in the dying minutes. The next day, Spain took the lead against France through Raúl after an hour. Le Bleus responded quickly, equalizing through David Trezeguet. Then the French tones took over, eventually culminating in Zinedine Zidane making it 2-1 in the 83rd minute. The third quarter-final didn't see any goals outside of the penalty shootout, where the Netherlands defeated Croatia. The last quarter-final was much more entertaining, albeit one-sided, as a goal from Jan Koller and a Milan Baros brace made sure the Czech Republic ran out 3-0 victors against Denmark [5].\n\nSemi-finals and final\n\nIn the first semi-final, it was again Ronaldo who gave Portugal the lead in the first half. Maniche added a second in the 58th minute. An own goal restored a little bit of hope for the Netherlands, but Portugal still won 2-1 in the end [6]. After a blistering opening 10 minutes, the semi-final between France and the Czech Republic became oddly uninspired for the remainder of the first half. Maybe memories of their previous competitive encounters entered the heads of the players. In the 1996 semi-final, the Czech Republic beat France on penalties, while Le Bleus came out on top in the 2000 quarter-final [7]. Their meeting at the 2003 Nations League Finals, which the Czechs won 2-0, further raised the stakes. Around 15 minutes into the second half, the lack of inspiration vanished. The match opened up and Thierry Henry opened the scoring for France in the 65th minute. Almost 20 minutes later on the dot, Marek Heinz equalized for the Czech Republic. Extra time loomed. The controversial golden goal rule was now replaced by the basically just as controversial silver goal rule. This was likely on everyone's mind when France were awarded a free-kick right outside the penalty area in the 105th minute. Zidane stepped up and scored emphatically, securing Le Bleus a place in their second consecutive Euro final, while hosts Portugal participated in their first. Being a final, the match was naturally characterized by nerves. The players were a bit hesitant, though France's greater final experience showed. Nevertheless, it was the super sub Rui Costa who smashed in a stunning opening goal for Portugal in the 62nd minute. Le Bleus never panicked, though, finding the equalizer through Henry 9 minutes later. The remainder of the 90 minutes failed to produce any goals, and for long it seemed the extra time would suffer the same fate. However, Trezeguet had other plans, finding the winner for France in the 118th minute. Portugal tragically lost the final on home soil, while France exorcised their Euro 2000 demons [8] and became Euro champions for the second time in history.\n\nKnockout stage of Euro 2004. ​\n\n--------------------\n\nThe second Euro of this timeline is completed!

Along with hosts Germany, the 10 group winners qualified directly for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The 10 runners-up advanced to the play-offs along with the two best teams based on the Nations League overall rankings who finished outside the top two in their qualifying groups. Notably, this was the first qualifying campaign which saw three play-off paths as opposed to four.\n\nDraw\n\nThe draw for the qualifying groups was conducted in December 2004 in Munich, Germany. The 51 participating teams were divided into five seeding pots based on the November 2004 Nations League overall rankings [1]. The teams participating in the 2005 Nations League Finals in June and Interleague play-offs in March respectively were still marked so they would be allocated to a five-team group and thus have a free matchday to participate in the competitions mentioned above. Germany (ranked 3rd) were not present due to qualifying automatically as hosts. San Marino were assigned to the six-team group, due to being the lowest-ranked team. Kazakhstan made their European World Cup qualifying debut, having previously participated in the qualifiers for UEFA Euro 2004.\n\nTeams seeded ahead of the European qualifiers draw for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. ​\n\nGroup Summary\n\nThe Czech Republic won Group 1 as expected, closely followed by Serbia and Montenegro, who only conceded a single goal. Group 2 was highly competitive at the top. Denmark and Ukraine were tied on head-to-head results, with the Danes advancing courtesy of their superior overall goal difference [2]. Portugal lived up to the expectations and topped Group 3, while Slovakia surpassed what was anticipated of them and finished in second. Fortunately for Austria, their Nations League performance still earned them a spot in the play-offs. Group 4 was won by defending Euro champions France [3], though not as emphatically as expected. Switzerland finished in quite a close second. Italy were easily victorious in Group 5, finishing eight points ahead of runners-up Scotland. Poland surprised in Group 6, winning it ahead of England who would have to hope for the best in the play-offs. Group 7 saw Spain finish first ahead of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who advanced to the play-offs for the first time in history. Meanwhile, third-placed Belgium still did enough to advance via the Nations League. Sweden topped Group 8 by the skin of their teeth, despite their opening home loss to runners-up Croatia. The Netherlands won Group 9 without any hassle, while Israel finished in second with equal ease. Turkey were triumphant in Group 10, closely followed by runners-up Norway [4].\n\nFinal standings of the European qualifying groups. ​\n\nRanking of second-placed teams\n\nThis was notably the first season since the inception of the Nations League where not a single runner-up qualified directly. Instead, all runners-up advanced to the play-offs, being divided into a seeded pot and an unseeded pot based on their performance in the European qualifiers. To make the rankings fair, matches played against the sixth-placed team in Group 10 were not counted.\n\nAustria and Belgium qualified for the play-offs via the Nations League and will be in the unseeded pot. ​\n\nTeam selection for the qualifying play-offs\n\nBased on the November 2004 Nations League rankings, the two best teams that failed to finish higher than second in their qualifying groups advanced to the play-offs along with the 10 runners-up. The 12 teams would subsequently be allocated to three different play-off paths containing four teams, each featuring two semi-finals and a final to fill the remaining three UEFA spots for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\nHosts Germany finished as runners-up at the 2005 UEFA Nations League Finals in Sweden.​\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nAs always, I hope you enjoyed it. See you with the qualifying play-offs.\n\n[1] Since the Nations League rankings replaced the coefficients as a seeding method in both OTL and TTL, it's likely they would've been used to seed the European Qualifiers for the 2002 and 2006 World Cups in TTL instead of the FIFA rankings or any other ranking system.\n\n[2] Denmark failed to qualify in OTL.\n\n[3] Greece won Euro 2004 in OTL.\n\n[4] Turkey failed to qualify in OTL.\n\nPart 11 - Extinguished ​\n\n2006 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA play-offs​\n\nDraw\n\nThe draw for the qualifying play-offs was conducted on 18 November 2005 at the FIFA headquarters in Zürich, Switzerland, with the matches themselves being played on 8 and 13 December. There were also three separate draws to determine who would host each respective play-off final.\n\nFor the play-off draw, the following procedure was applied:\n\nIn the order drawn, the six seeded teams were assigned to semi-finals 1 to 6 as the host team\n\nIn the order drawn, the eight unseeded teams were assigned to semi-finals 1 to 6 as the away team\n\nSemi-finals 1 and 2 formed play-off Path 1\n\nSemi-finals 3 and 4 formed play-off Path 2\n\nSemi-finals 5 and 6 formed play-off Path 3\n\nThe semi-final winners that host play-off finals 1, 2 and 3 were decided by a draw\n\nSeeding\n\nThe 12 participating teams were divided into two seeding pots based on their performance in the European qualifiers for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\nTeams seeded ahead of the UEFA play-off draw. ​\n\nPath 1\n\nThe stakes were high for England, who unexpectedly finished behind Poland in their qualifying group. Thankfully for The Three Lions, Frank Lampard and Michael Owen earned them a routine win against Belgium in their play-off semi-final. England's matches were notably played at Anfield in Liverpool and at Old Trafford in Manchester respectively, due to the construction of the new Wembley Stadium not being finished yet. Ukraine’s triumph over Slovakia in Kyiv was not as straightforward as that of England, as Szilárd Németh opened the scoring for the visitors in the 49th minute. The Ukrainians remained composed, though, first equalizing through Andriy Shevchenko and finding the winning goal through Ruslan Rotan shortly thereafter. The play-off final saw England gain an early lead thanks to Wayne Rooney. Around 20 minutes later, Joe Cole made sure The Three Lions would go into half-time with a two-goal cushion. Schevchenko gave Ukraine a lifeline in the 54th minute, but Peter Crouch extinguished any hope of a Ukrainian comeback just as the match entered added time [1].\n\nEngland qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. ​\n\nPath 2\n\nSerbia and Montenegro, who conceded just one goal in the qualifiers, remained defensively solid in their play-off semi-final against Switzerland. The problem was just that their offense left more to be desired, meaning the match would have to be decided by penalties. Here, the home side were emphatic, however, winning 3–0 as Switzerland’s qualifying hopes died out [2]. The other semi-final didn’t see any goals either. At least not for the opening 90 minutes, but two minutes into the second half of extra time, Ole Martin Årst made Norway victorious against Austria, who they also defeated in the play-offs to reach Euro 2000. Their most recent spell at a major tournament. In the play-off final, Serbia and Montenegro extended this drought, as Mateja Kežman's 15th-minute goal never received a response.\n\nSerbia and Montenegro qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. ​\n\nPath 3\n\nScotland had to travel far for their away match against Israel, only for the home side to obtain the lead in the 7th minute through Yossi Benayoun. However, on the stroke of half-time, Scotland got back into the game thanks to an unlikely hero - the centre-back Andy Webster. Then the match saw a distinct lack of heroes for the remaining opening 90 minutes and later extra time. Until the penalty shootout that is, where the Israeli goalkeeper Nir Davidovich rose to the occasion. The other semi-final saw a quite politically charged matchup between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Fortunately, the match never saw any major disturbances from the crowd, who got to see Darijo Srna score Croatia's winning goal through a correctly awarded penalty. In contrast to the quite bleak semi-finals, the final was a blistering affair. Ivan Klasnić gave Croatia the lead in the 15th minute, which was quickly followed by an equalizer from Benayoun shortly afterwards. The Brazilian-born Eduardo restored Croatia's lead before half-time, though. Seven minutes into the second half, a clumsy challenge gave the visiting Croatians a golden opportunity to go 3-1 ahead. An opportunity which was seized by Srna, adding to his goal tally from the semi-final. Benayoun went a step further in the 68th minute, scoring his second of the match and third of these qualifying play-offs. Israel 2, Croatia 3. This was only the beginning, though, as Omer Golan made it 3-3 in the 85th minute, sending the match to extra time. However, Croatia's greater experience was clearly shown here. They had another gear. Eduardo scored his second of the match to secure Croatia a place at the World Cup.\n\nCroatia qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.​\n\n---------------------------\n\n[1] Ukraine qualified in OTL.\n\n[2] Switzerland qualified in OTL.\n\nPart 12 - Spark of Brilliance​\n\n2006 FIFA World Cup​\n\nThe 2006 FIFA World Cup was the 18th edition of the tournament, hosted by Germany. The draw for the final tournament was conducted on 18 December 2005 in Leipzig, Germany [1], with the teams being seeded according to a ranking system which was based on the FIFA World Rankings and the performances of teams at the two preceding World Cups [2].\n\nGroup stage [3]\n\nGroup C\n\nGroup C [4] was a two-horse race between Argentina and the Netherlands, which was ultimately won by the former, courtesy of goal difference. En route to first place, the Argentinians’ respectable opening 3-1 win against Japan was followed by an emphatic 6-0 demolition of Serbia and Montenegro. They ended their group phase with a 0-0 draw against the Dutch, whose previous 1-0 win against Serbia and Montenegro and 2-0 victory over Japan saw them finish in second without conceding a single goal. The Japanese finally got a reason to celebrate on the final matchday, where they won 3-2 versus Serbia and Montenegro [5].\n\nFinal standings of Group C at the 2006 World Cup. ​\n\nGroup F\n\nBrazil soared to first place in Group F [6], edging past Croatia 1-0 before breezing past Australia 2-0 and hammering the Ivory Coast 4-1. Australia made a long overdue return to the World Cup and got a dream start, defeating the Ivorians 3-1 in their opener. The 2-2 draw with Croatia on the final matchday, which saw Josip Simunic be shown three (!) yellow cards before being sent off, was enough for the Australians to reach the last 16. Croatia would’ve advanced had they scored one more goal against the Ivory Coast, who had a disappointing tournament and left Germany without a single point.\n\nFinal standings of Group F at the 2006 World Cup. ​\n\nGroup G\n\nThe defending Euro champions France topped Group G [7], starting their campaign with a 1-0 victory over Turkey. This was followed by an underwhelming 1-1 draw with South Korea, but Le Bleus’ subsequent 2-0 win against Togo was still enough to earn them first place. Runners-up Turkey bounced back after their opening loss, defeating Togo 1-0 and South Korea 3-2. The Koreans were decent, but the draw with France and 2-1 win against Togo were not enough for them to advance.\n\nFinal standings of Group G at the 2006 World Cup. ​\n\nGroup H\n\nGroup H [8] was easily won by Spain, who defeated Denmark 3-0, Tunisia 3-1 and Saudi Arabia 1-0. Nevertheless, Denmark were comfortably the second-best team in the group, highlighted by their 4-0 demolition of the Saudis, which was followed by 1-0 win over Tunisia. The 2-2 draw between Tunisia and Saudi Arabia was entertaining, but ultimately of no importance when it came to deciding the group’s outcome.\n\nFinal standings of Group H at the 2006 World Cup. ​\n\nKnockout stage [9]\n\nRound of 16\n\nFrance got a routine win against Denmark. Thierry Henry opened the scoring in the 13th minute and Sylvain Wiltord added another in the second half. Spain’s triumph over Turkey was a similar story. A clumsy challenge saw Spain go in front thanks to a David Villa penalty. Fernando Torres added a second in the 76th minute, meaning Hakan Şükür's header 15 minutes later only served as consolation.\n\nQuarter-finals\n\nAfter a somewhat hesitant opening hour, Henry opened up the game, as well as the scoring for France. This awoke Italy, who equalized through Luca Toni less than two minutes later. Then the game again entered its previously uncertain state. Extra time would've been an identical story, had it not been for Zinedine Zidane being sent off for headbutting Marco Materazzi, who in fairness severely provoked the Frenchman with statements that were way out of order. Nevertheless, Zidane would've surely been a valuable asset in the penalty shootout, which was won by Italy. For Spain, Villa also proved to be a valuable asset when he converted another penalty in the quarter-final versus the defending champions Brazil. A brilliant individual performance by Kaka made sure the scoreline was 1-1 at half-time, though. Adriano quickly gave Brazil the lead in the second half, which ended up being the final score. It was notably the only quarter-final which didn't go to penalties. Spain's quarter-final 'curse' continued.\n\nSemi-finals and final\n\nThe semi-final between Brazil and their former colonial rulers Portugal was a disappointingly dull affair, not seeing a single goal despite the occasional spark of brilliance. Brazil's greater experience at the latter stages of major tournaments proved to be crucial, as they were victorious in the subsequent penalty shootout, securing a fourth (!) consecutive appearance in a World Cup final, breaking their own record. Meanwhile, Italy made a return to this stage for the first time since 1994, where Brazil also stood against them. Who could forget that penalty shootout? However, this final didn't need a shootout - or extra time. Materazzi's header in the 19th minute never received a response, meaning Italy were world champions for the first time in 24 years!\n\nKnockout stage of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. ​\n\n---------\n\nWow, I’ve really been pumping these out recently. The second World Cup of this TL is now completed. Enjoy!\n\n[1] The draw was conducted on 9 December in OTL.\n\n[2] Due to the new teams that qualify in TTL and some teams having different performances at the 2002 World Cup compared to OTL, the seeding pots for the 2006 World Cup are slightly different in TTL. One example is that Argentina are no longer in the top-seeded pot. This places them in the same pot as the Ivory Coast, meaning the two can’t be in the same group as in OTL. And yes, figuring out how the seeding worked and applying it to the new teams in TTL was just as tedious as it sounds. Fun fact: When doing the same with the 2002 World Cup, I found that Romania were just 0.5 points (!) away from being top-seeded, which would have made the group’s constellation in TTL impossible.\n\n[3] Only groups that are different from OTL are shown. The rest unfolded exactly as in OTL.\n\n[4] The Ivory Coast were in the group instead of Japan in OTL.\n\n[5] Serbia and Montenegro lost “this” match against the Ivory Coast in OTL, due to conceding two completely pointless handball penalties (something similar also happened in 2010). Because of this, I think Japan would win this match, despite Serbia and Montenegro being the slightly better team.\n\n[6] Japan were in the group instead of the Ivory Coast in OTL.\n\n[7] Switzerland were in the group instead of Turkey in OTL.\n\n[8] Ukraine were in the group instead of Denmark in OTL.\n\n[9] The knockout stage will only address matches that are new in TTL, whether it’s a completely new team such as Denmark or a matchup taking place earlier than in TTL, such as the quarter-final between Italy and France.\n\nPart 13 - Giant-Killings\n\nUEFA Euro 2008 qualifying draw and group stage​\n\nUEFA Euro 2008 qualifying\n\nThe group phase qualifying matches were played from March to November 2007, while the play-offs were to take place in March 2008. Alongside co-hosts Austria and Switzerland, the group winners qualify directly. For the first since the Euro 1992 qualifiers, no runners-up advanced directly to the final tournament. In total, there were 10 qualifying groups: nine groups with five teams and one group with six teams. The four remaining spots were determined by four play-off paths formed based on performances in the 2006-07 UEFA Nations League.\n\nDraw\n\nThe qualifying draw was conducted on 1 December 2006 in Montreux, Switzerland [1]. The 51 participating teams were divided into five seeding pots based on the November 2006 Nations League overall rankings. The teams participating in the 2007 Nations League Finals in June and Interleague play-offs in March respectively were still marked so they would be allocated to a five-team group and thus have a free matchday to participate in the competitions mentioned above. Austria (ranked 16th) and Switzerland (ranked 22nd) were not present in the draw due to having already qualified for the tournament as co-hosts.\n\nThe Montenegro problem\n\nMontenegro gained independence from Serbia and Montenegro on 3 June 2006 and were subsequently granted provisional UEFA membership in October of the same year. UEFA decided that this provisional membership was enough for Montenegro to be allowed to participate in Euro 2008 qualifying [2], the draw for which would be conducted on 1 December 2006. A debate concerning full membership was to take place in January 2007, after the qualifying draw but a couple of months before the qualification process itself began, which is believed to have been one of the main reasons Montenegro were allowed to enter on such short notice. Nevertheless, Montenegro were granted full UEFA membership in January 2007 and admitted to FIFA later in May. However, there were still concerns regarding the seeding of Montenegro, as they had not participated in the 2006-07 Nations League, or in any season before then. In accordance with UEFA regulations, Montenegro were seeded last, despite most people agreeing they were better much than the likes of San Marino. UEFA subsequently decided that the two sides would be automatically allocated to the six-team group.\n\nTeams seeded ahead of the Euro 2008 qualifying draw. ​\n\nGroup Summary\n\nThe qualifiers saw many upsets, with many group favorites finishing behind underdogs. However, Group A was not one of them. Favorites Portugal won it, though thanks to goal difference. Serbia and Belgium would get a second chance in the play-offs, due to their Nations League display. Group B was also really close, at least at the top, where Scotland’s unexpected win against France was enough to clinch them first place against the odds. Le Bleus and Israel would have to hope for the best in the play-offs. Greece won Group C, closely followed by rivals Turkey who would have to settle with being in the play-offs. The Czech Republic topped Group D, while Norway and the Republic of Ireland advanced to the play-offs. Russia managed to be triumphant in Group E, with play-off-bound Croatia not far behind. Group F was comfortably won by Spain, and saw Northern Ireland unexpectedly finish in second, ahead of even Denmark. Nevertheless, due to their Nations League performance, it was only the Danes and Latvians who qualified for the play-offs. In Group G, Romania’s surprising home win against Netherlands was enough to win the group in front of Oranje. The Dutch’s destiny will be determined in the play-offs, as will that of Bulgaria. Group H was as one-sided as can be, being completely swept by Italy. Ukraine found themselves in the play-offs. Group I saw yet another surprise, with Poland finishing first ahead of neighbours Germany, who won bronze at the World Cup less than two years prior. The final upset, though quite a small one, happened in Group J, with Sweden finishing one point ahead of England, who advanced to the play-offs with Slovakia.\n\nPlay-off team selection controversy\n\nFinland and Northern Ireland didn't advance to the play-offs despite performing better than team(s) in their groups who did qualify, sparking controversy surrounding whether the team selection process for the play-offs was fair. It was especially bad for Northern Ireland in Group F, where both Denmark and Latvia earned a play-off spot, but not Norn Iron. The Northern Ireland FA filed an official complaint to UEFA, who subsequently stated that they would \"examine if there were other more fair possible methods for deciding which teams advance to the play-offs\".\n\nFinal group standings of the Euro 2008 qualifiers. ​\n\nTeam selection for the qualifying play-offs\n\nBased on the November 2006 Nations League overall rankings, the 16 best teams that failed to qualify directly were selected to participate in the qualifying play-offs. They would subsequently be allocated to four different play-off paths containing four teams, each featuring two semi-finals and one final to fill the four remaining spots for Euro 2008.\n\nTop-ranked Germany surprisingly failed to qualify directly. ​\n\n— — — — — —\n\nNOTICE: A kind reader shared some useful thoughts on the pot distribution for the seeding of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, noting that it makes more sense for Australia to be in Pot D in TTL, not Pot B. By extension, this means Angola can not be in the same group as Argentina, and Australia can not be in the same group as Japan. As a result, I’ve made edits to the groups affected by the different pots. Additionally, it means Group D can be identical to OTL and has thus been removed from the post. Note that this does not change the knockout stage bracket whatsoever. If you’re more curious about the changes, I highly suggest you read Part 12 again.\n\nBack again! Stay tuned for the qualifying play-offs, which feature unusually many strong teams.\n\n[1] It was conducted in January in OTL.\n\n[2] Montenegro did not participate in the Euro 2008 qualifiers in OTL, due to the draw and matches taking place months later than in TTL.\n\nPart 14 - Unusually\n\nUEFA Euro 2008 qualifying play-offs​\n\nDraw\n\nThe draw for the play-offs was held on 25 November 2007 in Nyon, Switzerland [1], shortly after the completion of the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying group stage, with the play-off matches themselves scheduled to take place in March to April 2008.\n\nSeeding\n\nThe 16 teams were seeded according to the November 2006 Nations League overall rankings. All play-off paths [2] would contain one team from each pot. The teams ranked 1-9 played in League A of the 2006-07 UEFA Nations League, while the teams ranked 10-16 played in League B. These play-offs featured unusually many strong teams.\n\nTeams seeded ahead of the play-off draw.​\n\nThe draw resulted in the following play-off paths:\n\nThe winner of each play-off path qualified for UEFA Euro 2008. ​\n\nIn each play-off semi-final, team 1 would play against team 4 and team 2 would face team 3, with the higher-ranked team hosting the match. Following a draw, these semi-final winners were allocated to host the play-off final:\n\nPath A: Winner semi-final 1 (Germany v Belgium)\n\nPath B: Winner semi-final 1 (Croatia v Latvia)\n\nPath C: Winner semi-final 1 (Netherlands v Slovakia)\n\nPath D: Winner semi-final 2 (Serbia v Bulgaria)\n\nPath A\n\nGermany were emphatic against Belgium in Dortmund, putting four goals past them. Miroslav Klose’s 23rd-minute opener was followed by a Mario Gomez goal 14 minutes into the second half. Before the home fans were done celebrating, Lukas Podolski had already made it 3-0. In the 89th minute, Klose secured his brace. The other semi-final, which was played in Istanbul, was not nearly as dramatic - at least not the first half. But when Nihat Kahveci gave Turkey the lead after almost exactly an hour, things changed for the better. Norway had to wait 16 minutes before things changed for the better in their favour, though, because that’s when John Carew equalized. However, that’s the only equalizer the Norwegians found in that match. Kahveci restored Turkey’s lead almost immediately after kick-off, ultimately securing victory and a place in the play-off final. The final was notably played in Berlin at a different venue than the semi-final. Even more notably, however, the visiting Turks obtained the lead at Olympiastadion in the 17th minute thanks to Arda Turan. Turkey couldn’t cherish their lead for long, though, due to Bastian Schweinsteiger’s subsequent equalizer. The match was tied for the remainder of the first half, and for the opening 24 minutes of the second one, until Klose restored order for Germany. As added time approached, Lukas Podolski erased any hope of a Turkish comeback, despite Kahveci’s late consolation goal [3].\n\nGermany qualified for Euro 2008. ​\n\nPath B\n\nLatvia were giving Croatia a harder time than expected in Zagreb, obtaining quite a fortunate early lead thanks to Māris Verpakovskis. The Croatians remained collected, though, finding the equalizer within two minutes. Niko Kranjčar was the goalscorer. Just as the fourth official indicated the first half would have one added minute, Ivica Olić made it 2-1 Croatia. This lead was successfully defended for the entire second half, earning Croatia their place in the final. The other fight for a spot in the final took place in Copenhagen, where Nicklas Bendtner sent the home fans into a frenzy when he opened the scoring for Denmark in the 28th minute. However, this joy only lasted for around five minutes, before Wayne Rooney made it 1-1. After this, it's clear both teams became nervous and hesitant, knowing what was at stake. Still, that didn't stop Steven Gerrard from attempting an audacious half-volley from just outside the penalty area in the 101st minute. Denmark 1, England 2. The Three Lions were in the final. The final was more straightforward. Kranjčar again proved to be Croatia's gem. His 10th-minute goal was left unanswered.\n\nCroatia qualified for Euro 2008. ​\n\nPath C\n\nThe Netherlands hammered Slovakia in Rotterdam, where Klaas-Jan Huntelaar's brace was accompanied by goals from John Heitinga and Johannes Vennegoor of Hesselink. All Slovakia got was a consolation strike from Marek Mintál. The other semi-final was more dramatic, despite the lower goal tally - and the goalless first half. Andriy Shevchenko changed that in the 53rd minute, though. The floodgates were now open, which was highlighted by Serhiy Nazarenko making it 2-0 shortly thereafter. Robbie Keane's 93rd-minute goal came far too late for any hope of a comeback to be alive. Ukraine's triumph proved to be in vain, however, as the Dutch retained their offensive prowess in the play-off final in Amsterdam, where Dirk Kuyt and Ryan Babel got on the scoresheet along with Huntelaar, who added to his goal tally from the semi-final.\n\nNetherlands qualified for Euro 2008. ​\n\nPath D\n\nBlagoy Georgiev gave his visiting Bulgaria the lead against Serbia in Belgrade before the 20-minute mark was reached. Fortunately and deservedly for Serbia, Danko Lazović equalized in the 43rd minute. The Serbs took over more in the second half, yet the match still somehow reached extra time, where Serbia maintained a clear upper hand, which ultimately culminated in two deserved goals from Marko Pantelić and Nikola Žigić. The other semi-final saw no twists and turns. Thierry Henry made sure France were victorious, despite their poor display. The final saw Le Bleus gain the lead thanks to a Franck Ribéry penalty after around 30 minutes. Serbia proved to be strong, though. Especially Žigić, who equalized in the 62nd minute. The rest of the match was underwhelming, with neither sides willing to take risks. Penalties were seemingly inevitable, a sentiment which proved to be correct. In a shootout where neither side were potent, the French were ultimately victorious.\n\nFrance qualified for Euro 2008. ​\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[1] There were no play-offs for Euro 2008 in OTL.\n\n[2] These were notably the first qualifiers in which the play-off paths were named by letters instead of numbers.\n\n[3] Part of me feels bad for “denying” Turkey’s good Euro 2008 tournament which we saw in OTL. But these things happen in football and I want to be careful and do what I think would’ve happened given the circumstances and draws of this TL, not just what I want to happen. Otherwise, the integrity of this timeline becomes jeopardized in a way in my opinion."
