        "text": "The BRICS Games are an annual gathering of the eight-nation BRICS intergovernmental organisation, now in its fifth edition in Kazan, Russia, with participants from 89 countries, after the last one was held in the South African city of Durban in 2023.\n\nBRICS is an intergovernmental organisation of eight countries (Brazil, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Iran, Russia, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates) whose initial aim was to highlight investment opportunities. However, the grouping has evolved into a cohesive geopolitical bloc, with their governments meeting annually at formal summits and coordinating multilateral policies since 2009. Bilateral relations between the BRICS are largely based on the principles of non-interference, equality and mutual benefit.\n\nA total of 15 countries have formally applied to join the BRICS: Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Pakistan, Senegal, Thailand, Venezuela, Vietnam and Yemen. In addition, the following countries have expressed interest in joining BRICS: Angola, Cameroon, Colombia, Comoros, DR Congo, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Libya, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Serbia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, Somalia, Uganda and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe BRICS Games are an annual gathering of member countries, now in its fifth edition. Kazan, known as the \"third capital of Russia\", has taken over the relay from Goa in India (2016), Guangzhou in China (2017) and Johannesburg (2018) and Durban (2023), both in South Africa, while the 2022 edition was held online from 1 to 30 September 2022 after a four-year break due to Covid.\n\nKazan, the capital of Tatarstan Republic, has prepared a full programme with 27 sports modalities in a two-week event until 23 June: Acrobatic Rock and Roll, Athletics, Artistic Gymnastics, Badminton, Basketball Double (online and on court), Belt Wrestling, Boxing, Breaking, Canoeing and Kayaking, Chess, Diving, Fencing, Football Double (online and on court), Gymnastics, Judo, Karate, Kurash, Horse Racing, Rowing, Sambo, Skateboard, Synchronised Swimming, Table Tennis, Tennis, Weightlifting, Wrestling and Wushu. The event is fully supported by the Government of Russia.\n\nMost importantly, this fifth edition of the BRICS Games involves many more countries than those that make up the organisation. A total of 89 countries and 4,751 athletes will compete for 387 medals (129 gold, 129 silver and 129 bronze) at a record 17 different venues.\n\nMore than 60 countries were invited to take part. By 1 June 2024, representatives from 97 countries had confirmed their participation, although 89 countries were announced at the Opening Ceremony on 12 June 2024. The teams are made up of representatives of countries, including unrecognised and unfriendly countries that do not officially recognise these games, such as the IOC (e.g. Great Britain, France, Lithuania, etc.).\n\nThe most numerous teams come from Russia, Brazil and China. With the exception of Russia and Belarus, which are excluded as countries from the 2024 Olympic Games (only as Authorised Neutral Athletes and under many conditions), the other countries were not represented by the strongest athletes in their disciplines.\n\nAfter the second day of the V BRICS Games, Russia is leads the medal tally with 26 medals (16 golds), followed by Belarus with three golds (13 medals) and China and Uzbekistan with two golds each.\n\nThe BRICS Games will be attended by participants from:\n\n-Abkhazia.\n\n-Afghanistan.\n\n-Algeria.\n\n-Argentina.\n\n-Armenia.\n\n-Azerbaijan.\n\n-Bahrain.\n\n-Bangladesh.\n\n-Belarus.\n\n-Bolivia.\n\n-Botswana.\n\n-Brazil.\n\n-Bulgaria.\n\n-Burkina Faso.\n\n-Central African Republic.\n\n-Chad.\n\n-Chile.\n\n-China.\n\n-Colombia.\n\n-Croatia.\n\n-Cuba.\n\n-Ecuador.\n\n-Egypt.\n\n-Equatorial Guinea.\n\n-Eritrea.\n\n-Eswatini.\n\n-Ethiopia.\n\n-France.\n\n-Gabon.\n\n-Georgia.\n\n-Germany.\n\n-Ghana.\n\n-Hungary.\n\n-India.\n\n-Indonesia.\n\n-Iraq.\n\n-Iran.\n\n-Israel.\n\n-Italy.\n\n-Japan.\n\n-Jordan.\n\n-Kazakhstan.\n\n-Kuwait.\n\n-Kyrgyzstan.\n\n-Lebanon.\n\n-Lithuania.\n\n-Malaysia.\n\n-Mali.\n\n-Mauritania.\n\n-Mexico.\n\n-Moldova.\n\n-Mongolia.\n\n-Morocco.\n\n-Namibia.\n\n-Nigeria.\n\n-North Korea.\n\n-Pakistan.\n\n-Palestine.\n\n-Paraguay.\n\n-Peru.\n\n-Portugal.\n\n-Puerto Rico.\n\n-Republika Srpska.\n\n-Romania.\n\n-Russia.\n\n-Senegal.\n\n-Serbia.\n\n-Slovakia.\n\n-Somalia.\n\n-South Africa.\n\n-South Korea.\n\n-South Ossetiaa\n\n-Spain.\n\n-Syria.\n\n-Switzerland.\n\n-Tajikistan.\n\n-Thailand.\n\n-Togo.\n\n-Tunisia.\n\n-Turkey.\n\n-Turkmenistan.\n\n-United Arab Emirates.\n\n-United Kingdom.\n\n-Uzbekistan.\n\n-Venezuela.\n\n-Vietnam.\n\n-Yemen.\n\n-Zambia.\n\n-Zimbabwe."
