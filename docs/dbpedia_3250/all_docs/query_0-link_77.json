        "text": "Overview\n\nThe Sports Hall of Fame recognises sporting achievements by athletes and coaches who have had a significant impact on Whanganui’s sporting heritage.\n\nInductees have achieved success at the highest level in their chosen sporting field(s) and brought credit to sport in the Whanganui district. Thirty-two elite Whanganui sportspeople have been inducted into the Hall of Fame since it was launched in 2008. Wrestling great Pat O’Connor, legendary jockey Brent Thomson and professional golfer Simon Owen were the last inductees announced in 2019.\n\nThe Sports Hall of Fame is located in the foyer of the Cooks Gardens Event Centre.\n\n2023 Whanganui Sports Hall of Fame Nominations\n\nA partnership with the Whanganui District Council Mayor’s office and Sport Whanganui has resulted in the relaunch of the Hall of Fame in 2023, after a period of dormancy largely due to COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nNew sporting greats were inducted into the Whanganui Sports Hall of Fame following a ceremony at Cooks Gardens on 8 March 2024. Nominations for 2024 will open later this year.\n\nThe selection panel\n\nThe Sports Hall of Fame has a selection panel to choose inductees. They are:\n\nChair: Keith Smith, former Whanganui District Council Sport and Recreation Advisor\n\nJudges:\n\nCath Cheatley\n\nGrant Mckinnon\n\nJared Smith\n\nJolene Johansen\n\nJB Phillips\n\n2023 inductees\n\nKenneth (Ken) Ruby | Wrestling\n\nBorn in Wellington, Ruby’s athletic prowess made him a household name as one of New Zealand’s top amateur wrestlers of the 1940s-50s. He was a member of the New Zealand team to compete at the British Empire (Commonwealth) Games in Auckland in 1950, and in Vancouver in 1954, where he placed fifth.\n\nUpon his return from Canada, Ruby and his young family moved to Whanganui and went on to give back to the sport for many years as a coach and official, including starting what is now the Whanganui Boys and Girls Gym Club alongside Police Constable Jim Bowley.\n\nRuby later became an international referee-judge, officiating at multiple Commonwealth Games and World Championship events. He was named a Life Member of the New Zealand Referee-Judge panel in 1980, and life member of the NZ Olympic Wrestling Union in 1989.\n\nIn 1998, Ruby was awarded the Queen’s Service Medal (QSM) for community service in the Queen’s Birthday Honours. He passed away in Tauranga in 2011.\n\nIan Wright |Rowing\n\nIan Wright is recognised as one of the top rowing coaches in the world and has a successful pedigree as an athlete, representing New Zealand at the highest levels of the sport.\n\nWright took up rowing at Whanganui High School in 1978 and made his first New Zealand Rowing Team in 1983 as a member of the under-23 squad to compete against Australia. He went on to compete at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, winning a silver medal with Barrie Mabbott in the coxless pair, and a bronze in the eight.\n\nWright was part of the New Zealand Olympic rowing team to compete in Seoul, Korea in 1988, where he won a bronze medal in the coxed four alongside Chris White, Andrew Bird, Greg Johnston and George Keys. He was stroke of the coxed four that finished 11th at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and returned for a third cycle to compete at Atlanta in 1996, finishing 13th.\n\nAs a coach at St Paul's Collegiate in Hamilton, and later at Hamilton Boys' High School, Wright produced Maadi Cup-winning squads at each school. He coached the New Zealand under-23 team at various times during the 2000’s and the development coxed four to the world championships in 2003. Wright has coached national teams in Australia and Switzerland and in 2023 was nominated for Coach of the Year by World Rowing.\n\n2019 Inductees\n\nPatrick John (Pat) O’Connor\n\n(1924 – 1990) | Wrestling\n\nRaetihi-born Pat O’Connor was world professional wrestling champion for 31 months, also winning world tag team titles, was twice New Zealand amateur heavyweight champion and won a silver medal at the 1950 Auckland Empire Games.\n\nPat was from a farming background. After attending Massey Agricultural College he spent six months in the Royal New Zealand Air Force and played sport in Whanganui, including grade rugby with the Wanganui Marist Rugby Football Club.\n\nWhile in Whanganui he trained as a blacksmith to help finance wrestling coaching under the late Don Anderson before linking up with the Anton Koolman Gym in Wellington.\n\nPat represented New Zealand at the Pan American Games, was New Zealand heavyweight amateur champion in 1949 and 1950 and was second in the heavyweight division at the 1950 Empire Games.\n\nThen it was off to America to try his hand in the professional ranks where he won the 1955 National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) world tag team title with partner Roy McClarity in Chicago, holding the title for a year. He also won the NWA British Empire title in Toronto and the Canadian Open Tag Team title with Billy (Whipper) Watson.\n\nPat’s major wrestling break-through came in his then home city, St Louis, when he ended the 13-month reign of Dick Hutton as NWA world champion, winning the title with a spinning leg lock on January 9, 1959.\n\nThe New Zealander defended the title for 31 months before losing to “Nature Boy” Buddy Rogers before a North American record crowd of 38,622 at Chicago’s Comiskey Park on June 30, 1961 – an attendance record that stood until 1986.\n\nDuring Pat’s reign as world champion the American Wrestling Association (AWA) seceded from the NWA in May 1960 and he is the only wrestler to have held both the NWA and AWA world titles at the same time. He later briefly won both the AWA (1967) and WWA (1968) world tag team titles with Wilbur Snyder.\n\nLater a prominent professional wrestling promoter, Pat retired in 1982 after 32 years of wrestling. He returned to New Zealand briefly for several fights.\n\nHe died from cancer at the age of 65 in St Louis, Missouri, on August 16, 1990, and was held in such esteem that memorial services were held in both Kansas City and St Louis. This was fitting because he had been inducted into the United States top-ranked Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame.\n\nSimon Owen\n\n(1950 - ) | Golf\n\nWhanganui born Simon Owen, the 1976 International Double Diamond individual golf champion, won 17 tournaments around the world during his professional career and represented New Zealand five times in team events.\n\nAlthough he won titles in Scotland, Italy, Tunisia, Malaysia, Australia, Fiji and New Zealand, Simon is best known for his effort in leading the field in the 1978 British Open with three holes to play at the famous St. Andrews course in Scotland.\n\nHe slotted six birdies in the space of seven holes, including chipping in on the 15th green, in the fourth and final round to move ahead of his playing partner, the legendary Jack Nicklaus.\n\nAlthough Simon played several fine shots over the closing three holes, it was the American who snared a birdie to a bogey by the Kiwi to take a 1-up lead on the 16th.\n\nSimon’s approach on the notorious 17th (Road Hole) trickled off the green. He just missed a par putt and Nicklaus carded a par four for a 2-up advantage.\n\nRegulation pars on the 18th saw Nicklaus claim the title by two shots from Owen and the American trio of Tom Kite, Ben Crenshaw and Raymond Floyd.\n\nSimon said it was an honour to play alongside the greatest golfer the world has ever seen and give him a run for his money.\n\nAlthough he played in a dozen British Opens and the 1979 US Masters it was his titanic 1978 tussle with Nicklaus that stands out as his closest effort to creating golfing fame.\n\nHis two main European victories were winning the 1974 German Open with a score of 12-under 276 after a birdie on the first extra play-off hole against England’s Peter Oosterhuis and the 1976 Double Diamond tournament at Gleneagles with 8-under 132, two shot clear of Brian Huggett (Wales) and David Ingram (Scotland).\n\nSimon also won the 2001 Tunisian Open in a play-off with American Bob Lendzion and the 2007 Italian Open after a play-off with John Benda (USA), Tony Allen and Carl Mason (both England) on the European seniors’ circuit.\n\nHe also won the 1972 Fiji Open, 1976 New Zealand Open, 1978 New Zealand PGA and Malaysian Masters, 1980 South Australian Open and 1981 Tahiti Open.\n\nSimon was in the New Zealand team that reached the semi-finals of the 1990 Dunhill Cup tournament at St. Andrews alongside Frank Nobilo and Greg Turner after making his Dunhill debut the previous year.\n\nHe played in the New Zealand World Cup team in 1973 and 1989 in Spain and in California in 1976.\n\nSimon and his wife Cathy now live at Kinloch where he is a teaching professional.\n\nBrent Thomson\n\n(1958 –) | Horse racing\n\nBorn in Whanganui and son of noted horse trainer, the late Kevin Thomson, Brent won more than 2500 winners in 27 countries around the world, becoming a member of both the New Zealand and Australian Racing Halls of Fame.\n\nHe was a natural lightweight jockey who started his racing career in Whanganui at the age of 15, was New Zealand’s top apprentice the following year and in 1974 rode Fury’s Order to victory in the Benson and Hedges Cup at Riccarton.\n\nBrent went on to ride Fury’s Order to win the first of his four Australian weight-for-age Cox Plates within five years in 1975. The Cox Plate domination included a hat-trick of victories for ace trainer Colin Hayes.\n\nThe Whanganui rider was stable jockey for Hayes for six years and he was to win three Victorian premierships, the first rider from outside that state to achieve the feat.\n\nBrent was lured to Britain by prolific owner Robert Sangster where his successes started at Royal Ascot in the Cork and Orrery (now the Queen Elizabeth Jubilee) and also included the Queen Elizabeth II and back-to-back Ascot Gold Cups. The then 24-year-old rider won 30 races in the first five months.\n\nHe returned to Australia in 1987 to win the Caulfield Guineas and a second Caulfield Cup but eventually moved to Asia where he found riding in Hong Kong very exciting.\n\nHe was attached to the powerful Brian Kan Ping-chee stable for part of his five years on the Asian circuit, retiring in 2000 after riding in Macau. His 2500-plus winners included the 1984 Baden-Baden Grand Prix in Germany on Australian mount Strawberry Road, one of 54 Group 1 events he won.\n\nBrent rates Dulcify the best horse he ever rode, winner of the AJC Derby, Victorian Derby, Rosehill Guineas and the 1979 Cox Plate but the horse was fatally injured during the 1979 Melbourne Cup.\n\nNicknamed the “Wanganui Whiz-kid” and later “The Babe” in Australia, Brent enjoyed great popularity around the world and now lives in Melbourne where he is a New Zealand Bloodstock representative.\n\n2018 Inductees\n\nRobin Michael Newton Hood\n\n(1939– ) | Diving\n\nWhanganui-born Robin Hood has an outstanding record in international springboard and high platform diving administration.\n\nHe has officiated at 14 world championships, nine World Cups, seven Olympic Games, ten Commonwealth Games and five Asian and South-East Asian Games.\n\nRobin started his diving career with the Gonville Swimming Club in 1949, winning club, centre and interprovincial titles as well as club and centre backstroke, medley and freestyle swimming championships.\n\nHe shifted to Hamilton in 1959 to join diving coach, the late Mervyn Campbell, at the Rovers Swimming Club, winning the New Zealand 3-metre springboard title three times in 1966, 1967 and 1968, followed by the 1-metre springboard title in 1970.\n\nA gold medal in the 1966 New South Wales 3-metre state championship helped him win selection to the New Zealand Commonwealth Games team for Kingston, where he finished fifth.\n\nAfter missing inclusion in the 1968 Mexico Olympics team, Robin retired from national competition in 1971 to concentrate on the administration side of diving.\n\nThis had started at Gonville with the formation of the Wanganui Diving Committee of the Wanganui Swimming Centre. Robin was a foundation member of the New Zealand Diving Committee attached to the New Zealand Amateur Swimming Association (NZASA). It later became Diving New Zealand.\n\nRobin’s first national appointment was as manager of the New Zealand diving team to the 1982 world (FINA) championships in Ecuador. As the NZASA emissary he successfully helped win the rights to host the 1983 FINA world junior diving championships in Hamilton and he became secretary of the organising committee.\n\nHe was technical director of the organising committee when the 1999 FINA World Cup was held in Wellington.\n\nSince the 1974 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, where he was a referee, Robin has officiated in a major capacity – referee, judge, delegate or lecturer – at international FINA events around the world, including 22 clinics in 16 countries.\n\nRobin, who retired from FINA duties in Rome in 2009 and now lives in Albany, received a Diving New Zealand Life Membership Award in 2001, was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame (Paragon Award) for Outstanding Contribution to Diving in 2004, was awarded the FINA Gold Pin for Service to International Diving in 2009, and in 2018 named as an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for service to springboard and platform diving by the Governor-General, Her Excellency The Rt Hon Dame Patsy Reddy.\n\nCharles Ernest Phillips\n\n1940–2003 | Softball\n\nWhanganui-born Charlie Phillips was the first New Zealander to play, umpire and administer softball internationally.\n\nHe represented New Zealand at the inaugural world championships in Mexico in 1966, finishing third behind the United States and Mexico, and again in Oklahoma in 1968 where he placed fifth.\n\nThose two Kiwi softball teams were the pioneers for New Zealand sides – now the most successful in the world with seven world titles.\n\nAlthough a class pitcher for the Whanganui representative team, Charlie gained international honours as a shortstop and third baseman. He was a very alert in-fielder with quick reflexes and a powerful arm, as well as being a strong batter.\n\nCharlie, a foundation member of the Braves Softball Club, was an all-round sportsman, also representing Whanganui in football (a top-class goalkeeper), badminton, squash and table tennis.\n\nHe was New Zealand Softball Umpire-in-Chief for 13 years (1983–1996), officiating at world championships, and deputy chief umpire at world women’s and junior tournaments.\n\nIn 1997 he was inducted into the New Zealand Softball Hall of Fame, and in 1999 into the International Softball Federation Hall of Fame.\n\nHis international citation recognised Charlie’s contribution and dedication to the development and growth of world softball, in particular umpiring, and mentions his experience in all facets of the sport – playing, umpiring and administrating over a 30-year span.\n\nHe was also the South Pacific Regional Umpire-in-Chief, which included assisting with the standardising of international umpire training programmes.\n\nCharlie Phillips has a major legacy in New Zealand softball. He is also credited with introducing t-ball into this country after witnessing its popularity on an overseas trip.\n\nThe Phillips family was heavily involved in Whanganui softball: Charlie’s father, Fred, as an umpire, mother Alice a scorer, brother Bill played for New Zealand in the outfield, and sister Margaret represented Whanganui.\n\n2017 Inductees\n\nPeter Henderson\n\n1926–2014 | Rugby\n\nInducted into the Sports Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nPeter Henderson is rated as one of the fastest All Blacks of all time.\n\nNicknamed ‘Sammy’, Peter was a New Zealand sprint champion with a quickest 100 yards time of 9.7 seconds.\n\nHe played 19 rugby matches for the All Blacks on the 1949 tour of South Africa and against the visiting British Isles Lions in 1950. He represented New Zealand 19 times, including seven tests, and was the top try scorer in South Africa with seven tries.\n\nBorn in Gisborne, Peter was an All Black triallist and North Island representative in 1948, played for Hawke’s Bay in 1944–45 and 26 times for Whanganui between 1946 and 1950. He scored a hat-trick of tries in a 22–8 away victory over Canterbury in 1948, played in a Ranfurly Shield challenge against Otago on the same South Island tour and against the Lions at Spriggens Park in 1950.\n\nOn the athletic track he won the New Zealand 100 yards title in the 1948–49 season in 10 seconds and in 1950 was in the New Zealand 4x100 yards men’s relay team that finished third at the Auckland Empire Games, after placing fifth in the individual 100-yards final.\n\nPeter, who lost his job as a dental technician while on the South African tour, was lured to Britain by English professional rugby league club Huddersfield in late 1950 and played 258 matches for the club over seven years, scoring 214 tries in his 633 points.\n\nAs a right-winger he helped Huddersfield beat St Helens 15–10 in front of 89,588 spectators in the 1952–53 Challenge Cup final at Wembley Stadium.\n\nPeter also played for the Other Nationalities side that won the 1953 tri-nations test league series against England and France.\n\nSwitching to league, however, earned him a 38-year ban by the New Zealand Rugby Union which lasted until 1989.\n\nPeter, who was a Kaierau Club member, joined the New Zealand Barbarians Rugby Club and was also a keen lawn bowler in his latter years in the Bay of Plenty, helping to promote an annual tournament for league and rugby players.\n\nHe attended the Wanganui v Wellington Ranfurly Shield match at Cooks Gardens in 2009 and the Wanganui Rugby Football Union’s 125th jubilee in 2012.\n\nLints Family\n\nAlan Bruce Lints (1924–2019) | Hockey\n\nInducted into the Sports Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nThis Whanganui-born father and son combination have represented New Zealand in men's hockey, as well as being involved in the sport at international, national and district levels.\n\nAlan Bruce Lints (pictured right) represented New Zealand against Australia in 1958, captained North Island Minors for three of his six years in the team and was a New Zealand secondary schools' representative in 1951 and a North Island Colt.\n\nHe represented Whanganui at all levels between 1954 and 1968 and has held the roles of president, vice president, secretary, selector-coach, delegate and fixtures and umpires' appointee and is a life member of the Wanganui association and the Tech COB club.\n\nIn 1977 he was awarded the NZHA Pakistan Trophy for outstanding service to the sport, the year he was convenor of the national tournament held in Whanganui. He was a panel member of the NZHA select committee which investigated the future of hockey in New Zealand.\n\nAs an umpire, Alan Bruce gained his New Zealand A-grade badge in 1960, controlling provincial games against touring international teams, as well as two national finals and a North v South fixture.\n\nAt the national level Alan Bruce served as NZHUA president, vice president, executive member and was a theory and practical examiner for A grade badges, as well as umpires' director of a national tournament in Dunedin.\n\nAlan Bruce Lints also represented Whanganui in senior cricket and is a life member and patron of the Wanganui East Bowling Club.\n\nAlan Brodie Lints (1959– ) | Hockey\n\nAlan Brodie Lints (pictured right) represented New Zealand in 1986 at the London World Cup and toured Argentina in 1987 and India in 1988.

Although he started as a back in league, he soon made his name, as with the All Blacks, as an outstanding forward. Seeling played more than 200 games for Wigan, including three successive English rugby league finals (1910–12) plus the 1911 Challenge Cup final. Regarded as one of the club’s immortal players, the name of Charlie Seeling is one of only six chiselled in stone as you enter the club’s field at Central Park.\n\n‘Bronco’ Seeling always regarded Whanganui as his home and in 1956 was planning a trip back to New Zealand when he was killed in a car crash.
