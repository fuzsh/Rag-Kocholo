        "text": "On June 14, the UEFA European Football Championships will get underway when hosts Germany play Scotland in Munich. With Switzerland set to take part in the tournament for the third time in a row, here are the best places to watch the Nati in action!\n\nWhen and where does Switzerland play in Euro 2024?\n\nFans of the Swiss national team will not have to wait long to cheer the team on once the Euro 2024 starts. The team’s first game will be against Hungary at 3pm on June 15 at the RheinEnergieStadion in Cologne.\n\nSwitzerland’s next game will come again in Cologne against the Tartan Army of Scotland at 9pm on June 19. The national team’s final group stage match will be against Germany, facing the hosts at the Waldstadion in Frankfurt at 9pm on June 23.\n\nWhat are Switzerland’s chances at the European Championships?\n\nWhile the Swiss national team is known for punching above its weight, and recorded its best-ever performance at the Euros in 2021 (Euro 2020) by reaching the quarter-finals and knocking out France, the Nati’s preparation for this tournament has not been smooth sailing. In qualifying Switzerland came second in the group following a loss to Romania and draws against Kosovo, Israel and Belarus.\n\nWith Germany expected to top the group, second place is likely to come between Hungary and Switzerland. Luckily, the four highest-scoring third-place teams also progress to the knockout stages, improving the country’s chances of advancing.\n\nUpdate: Switzerland to face England in Euros quarter-final on July 6\n\nAfter placing second in Group A, Switzerland was able to dominate Italy in the round of 16, beating them by two goals to nil at the Olympiastadion in Berlin on June 29. Goals by Remo Freuler and Ruben Vargas mean that the Nati will face England in the quarter-finals at 6pm on July 6.\n\nIf they win the game in Düsseldorf, Switzerland will face the Netherlands or Turkey in Dortmund on July 10. The winner of that game will reach the final in Berlin on July 14.\n\nWhere to watch the Euros in Switzerland\n\nIf you weren’t one of the lucky ones who got tickets to the Euros and are now headed for Germany, don't worry, there are going to be many public viewings available in Switzerland where you'll be able to savour the atmosphere and share in all the highs and lows that football has to offer. Here are some of the largest gatherings in the five largest Swiss cities and beyond.\n\nBest public viewings of Euro 2024 in Zurich\n\nSwitzerland’s largest city, Zurich, is set to be jam-packed with events related to the Euro 2024. Alongside the standard events in bars and restaurants, and even a viewing in front of the FIFA museum, there will be several large public viewing places dotted across the city.\n\nFirst, from June 13 to August 10, the Sihlcity shopping centre will convert its outdoor area into what they describe as a “European Football Championship oasis.” The venue will feature a three-story tree house with plenty of seats and screens to help people catch up with the action, and a street market serving delicious food and refreshing cocktails.\n\nAcross the city in Hardbrücke, the MAAG Halle will be broadcasting all the games on giant 20-metre square screens. Food, drinks and a party atmosphere will make a night at the venue one to remember. However, while entry is free, visitors are encouraged to show up well ahead of the game to make sure they get a spot.\n\nCheer on Switzerland at the fan zone in Geneva\n\nHopping across the Röstigraben, Geneva is also set to celebrate the European Football Championships in style. The must-visit venue for watching football this summer in the city has to be the massive open-air fan zone at Plainpalais. Four giant screens will broadcast all the games of the tournament for residents to enjoy, all entirely for free.\n\nWith a series of food and drink stands also set to attend, the fan zone is expected to be more festival than football viewing!\n\nBest places in Basel to watch the European Championships\n\nWhile Germany may only be a few minutes away from Basel, the city on the Rhine will give you plenty of reasons to watch the matches in Switzerland. A Basel institution: for the entire duration of the tournament, the Markthalle will be broadcasting all the games. Get your friends together and head down for days of high passion and cold beer!\n\nWhat's more, the Baltazar bar in the heart of the city will also be broadcasting the games on three large screens, all the more reason to visit this favourite among locals. It is expected to be busy, so be sure to arrive ahead of time!\n\nLausanne to host a fan zone in Ouchy during the Euros\n\nWant to watch Euro 2024 in Lausanne? Alongside the bars filled with passionate fans, there really is only one prime place to visit!\n\nBetween June 14 and July 14, the local council will transform the Place de la Navigation in Ouchy into an open-air fan zone - a beautiful place to watch the beautiful game. The completely free event will give everyone in the Olympic city a chance to cheer their team on (hopefully to the final) and have delicious food and drink.\n\nWatch Euro 2024 from the Grosse Schanze in Bern\n\nWith Young Boys recently winning the Super League, it’s perhaps unsurprising that the de-facto capital Bern is set to be gripped by football fever during Euro 2024. The largest public viewing of the tournament in Bern will take place at the \"Summer Beach\" in the Grosse Schanze right next to the station. Be sure to pack your picnic blanket as seats are limited!\n\nOther Swiss cities during Euro 2024\n\nWhile the largest cities may draw the largest crowds, smaller towns are also set to host fantastic public viewings of Euro 2024 - from the lakeside boulevards of Thun and Arbon to the Piazza Manzoni in Lugano and the Winti Arena in Winterthur. For a full list of all the other major events, check out this list by EventButler.\n\nWhere to watch the Euros on TV in Switzerland\n\nIf you can’t make it to one of the public viewings, or just want a private viewing party with family and friends, the entirety of the European Championships will also be shown on Swiss television. SRF, the national broadcaster, will show all 51 games live on television, srf.ch/sport and on the SRF app. This also applies to their French and Italian versions, RTS and RSI."
