        "text": "MECHANICSVILLE, Md. – The world’s most prestigious off-road motorcycle racing series is set to continue its second half-century of thrilling competition with the 53rd season of the Pro Motocross Championship, sanctioned by AMA Pro Racing. The centerpiece of the SuperMotocross World Championship Series has provided one-of-a-kind thrills for race fans across the country since 1972, becoming its own unique American pastime as the toughest test in motorsports.\n\nThe 11-round summer campaign will visit 10 different states on a compelling journey to crown a pair of AMA National Champions with the sport’s most distinguished title. Since 1989, Southern Maryland’s Budds Creek Motocross Park, in Mechanicsville, has brought this captivating battle of man and machine to the National Capital Region, hosting both athletes and spectators from all over the world for more than three decades for what has become a beloved summer motorsports tradition. On Saturday, August 17, the fastest racers on the planet will make their anticipated return for the 34th running of the Yamaha Budds Creek National and the penultimate round of the 2024 season.\n\nAt the heart of Pro Motocross are the colossal giants of America’s most imposing racetracks, many of which have been challenging racers and thrilling audiences since the championship’s early years. The sprawling, natural terrain layouts feature awe-inducing obstacles, from massive jumps to towering hillsides, which provide the setting for an incredible spectacle of speed, skill, and a relentless pursuit of victory. While the unparalleled skill of these uniquely gifted athletes make navigating the challenging terrain look graceful, this championship is the ultimate test of physical and mental fortitude that will push even the best in the world to the absolute limit.\n\nArguably the most distinctive feature of Budds Creek Motocross Park is its soil. The distinctive light brown clay that encompasses the region is a racer’s dream, thanks to its incredible traction, while the multitude of elevation changes throughout Budds Creek’s expansive layout provide a unique challenge for competitors and some of the best sight lines in American motocross for the fans. The racing at this renowned venue is always close and often unpredictable. Budds Creek has welcomed several surprise winners over its history and in recent years, thanks to its late position in the schedule, it has become a popular venue for crowning new champions. With its close proximity to the nation’s capital, the atmosphere at the Budds Creek National always has a special feel and provides a perfect setting to celebrate this unique, passion-filled slice of Americana.\n\nOn the track, a decorated contingent of the best racers on the planet, who come from across the globe, comprise the competitive field set to wage battle over the course of the summer. The fastest American-born racers like Jason Anderson, social media sensation Haiden Deegan, Chance Hymas, Aaron Plessinger, Chase Sexton, along with former champions Eli Tomac and Cooper Webb, will go bar-to-bar against the most elite international competitors, headlined by the likes of AustralianHunter Lawrence, championship-winning Frenchmen Dylan Ferrandis and Tom Vialle, and Japanese rising star Jo Shimoda.\n\nThe SuperMotocross World Championship is a comprehensive 31-race season the combines the winter AMA Supercross Championship, which takes place on man-made racetracks in major stadiums across the country from January to mid-May, and the summer Pro Motocross Championship, the original homegrown series that visits the most iconic, rural venues in off-road motorcycle racing from late-May through August. Awaiting at the conclusion of these two series is the SuperMotocross World Championship Playoffs and Final in September, which will crown the ultimate champions across a full calendar year of this grueling and captivating motorsport.\n\nFor information about the Pro Motocross Championship, sanctioned by AMA Pro Racing, please visit ProMotocross.com and be sure to follow all of the Pro Motocross social media channels for exclusive content and additional information on the latest news:\n\nFacebook: @americanmotocross\n\nInstagram: @promotocross\n\nTwitter: @ProMotocross\n\nYouTube: AmericanMotocross"
