        "text": "The USA won two World Cup golds and seven medals overall, six of them in Olympic boat classes at the Lucerne Rowing World Cup last weekend.\n\nThe Men's Four and Women's Double did the winning in Lucerne one the World Cup started: the M4- ahead of another of GB's world champion boats, and the W2x beat out a new look Australian crew as well European champ Norway, who took down the Romanian Olympic and World Champions in Szeged last month.\n\nThe just-qualified men's eight finished just two-tenths of a second away from sprinting through the defending world champs from Britain to add a third. Not a bad week for the nine men who went to Lucerne as a non-qualified crew and now return as a contender for a medal in London. You can read more from the crew in row2k's Final Qualifier report from last week.\n\nThe other podiums for the USA's Olympic boats came from bronze medals rows by the Light Women's Double--which has medalled every time out this quadrennial--the Women's Four, and the Women's Eight, in addition to that silver in the Men's eight.\n\nOn Saturday, Sophia Luwis picked up her third World Cup medal in the Light Women's Single, a silver, to go along with the bronze she won at Worlds last year in the non-Olympic LW1x.\n\nYou can see the full Sunday results here.\n\nThe USA has used the second World Cup as a European tune-up trip each of the past two seasons and collected plenty of hardware, but this year's WC2 field in Lucerne featured nearly all the medal favorites for Paris. Apart from the Romanian team, the Sinkovic brothers and the Lithuanian W2x, every Olympic class medal-winning entry from the Belgrade Worlds was on the Lake of the Gods this past weekend--and the Men's Four even had the same six A Finalists from Worlds.\n\nNaturally, Olympic predictions would be premature: teams are at different places in their training plans ahead of Paris, and the absence of the Romanians, who won five medals and made six of the 7 finals on the women's side of things, is no small asterisk. Nonetheless, the USA's six Olympic boat-class medal winning crews here proved themselves very much in the mix for podium places in Paris...a big step on from the zero-medal nadir of Tokyo 202One.\n\nMen's Four - Gold\n\nThe US Men's Four of Liam Corrigan, Michael Grady, Justin Best, and Nick Mead picked right up where the quartet left off in Belgrade, winning their heat on the opposite side of the draw from the favored British. The Brits dropped their own heat by .03 to Australia.\n\nThat left folks in the boatpark breathless for a renewal of one of the great GB-Aussie rivalry in the event, but the final was all USA. The US crew set a pace that only New Zealand could match and GB wound up third ahead of Australia, but off the top step.\n\nIn the past, it has been fairly unusual for a US small boat crew to stay unchanged from year to year, but the Men's Four was one of three medal winners from Belgrade--along with the W2x and LW2x--to stay intact, and on a roll. The only shift in the crew has been Mead moving to bow and Best taking up residence in the two seat.\n\nrow2k caught up with Best about the boat staying together and how this second season is unfolding in training.\n\n\"After selection wrapped up earlier this spring, the four of us sat down to align on a few points of our second go-round as a crew,\" said Best. \"We are on the same page in terms of expectations around training, the approach to the stroke we feel maximizes our speed, and what we have to do to reach our goals. The boat is going well at the moment, and the proof of our commitment to those points showed this weekend.\n\n\"In both the heat and the final, we wanted to maintain a long stroke through the body of the piece to keep the boat speed consistent and I think we accomplished that for the most part.\n\n\"It’s good to check this box but we know no one is peaked right now and our competition will be getting faster in the coming weeks,\" Best added. \"We’re excited to attack the training heading into late July.\"\n\nBest makes a lot of the calls from his two seat perch, and we asked what he saying to the boat as they led the field into the third 500 this weekend. (See race replay here)\n\n\"The calls I make are a blend of technical and 'hype' calls. Grady and I typically split calls for length in front of the pin, taking a full deep breath, and reminders to get the blades quick to the water.\"\n\n\"I also love to give affirming calls to keep the motivation high. Since there is no coxswain, using your voice to let the guys know you’ve got each other’s back even when it may be hurting can make a massive difference.\"\n\nWomen's Double - Gold\n\nKristi Wagner and Sophia Vitas in the W2x had been racing together year-on-year as well: this is their third season, and they've moved steady up: fifth in 2022 and then bronze in 2023. After narrowly missing a World Cup 2 gold last year--to a Chinese crew they would later beat in Belgrade--Wagner and Vitas jumped to the top of the podium here to win their first gold as a crew. It was also the first international win for both.\n\nThey earned the gold by attacking the middle 1000 and timing their finishing move to perfection to catch the new Australian duo of Harriet Hudson and Amanda Bateman. The Norwegian double, which somewhat sensationally beat the Romanians at the European Championships, as mentioned above, trailed in third.\n\n\"We had a race plan that we did not execute as well during our semi final, so I think we were feeling more motivated to really push in that middle thousand during the final, Wagner told row2k.\n\n\"As for the sprint, I think Sophia and I can agree that is the most fun part of our sport, so even though I was hurting pretty badly when Sophia called it up, it is also so fun to sprint for the line and especially fun when you get your bow ahead like we did this time.\"\n\n\"I think we are pretty internal and want to execute our own best race on the day. But I have been so impressed with the field in the women's double and am excited to be a part of such a fun, fast and exciting boat class.\"\n\nIndeed, race commentator Sarah Cook thought that Wagner might have even been smiling a bit in the third 500, and that was well before the US put their bow in front at the end. (See race replay here)\n\nrow2k asked Wagner about the time the two have been able to spend together as a crew the past three seasons, and how that has helped them.\n\n\"One of the biggest things we have done is spent a lot more time in the boat together this year, said Wagner. \"We first hopped into the double starting in December and that has been a massive shift for us, being able to be doing the same training and consistently working on things together, with a lot of singles rowing and erging mixed in there as well.\n\n\"I think it’s really cool to show how investment in small boats is paying off for the US,\" Wagner added.\n\n\"We train a lot with the lightweight women's double and they never let us get away with anything. Training together has been really great for both crews and we are also pretty good at knowing when everyone needs some alone time. But we usually compare piece days to almost the whole US team on percentages.\n\n\"Josy Verdonkschot will give us prognostic times for a race 2k split based on any type of workout we do, and it is always based on the Gold Medal Standard for each individual boat class. So on any day the women’s single for example could 'beat' the men’s eight relativistically, and that can be helpful motivation as well.\"\n\nOther Notable Results\n\nIn addition to the US results, we saw a few notable finishes that we will keep an eye on as the athletes complete the run-up to Paris:"
