        "text": "New Manchester United assistant manager Ruud van Nistelrooy has opened up on how Manuel Pellegrini changed his outlook on not playing during a stint at Malaga.\n\nFormer United striker Van Nistelrooy has joined Erik ten Hag's coaching staff this summer. The Dutchman is one of several backroom changes made at Old Trafford following a disappointing 2023/24 season which saw Man United finish eighth in the Premier League, their lowest top-flight finish since 1989/90.\n\nVan Nistelrooy's coaching record so far includes a stint as manager of PSV Eindhoven's youth teams before becoming the Dutch club's manager for a season in 2022/23. After winning the Johan Cruyff Shield and KNVB Cup, he resigned with one match remaining in the Eredivisie season, citing a lack of support.\n\nREAD MORE: David de Gea Man United return stance as transfer question posed after Andre Onana struggles\n\nREAD MORE: I watched all of Manchester United's pre-season tour - Erik ten Hag was right about his team\n\nThe 48-year-old has opened up on how former Manchester City boss Pellegrini helped him understand how players on the bench can still have an impact on a team. \"Listen, you’re not going to start most of the games. You’re going to come on. It’s important now that you’re taking care of the younger players,\" he told the Guardian.\n\n\"It was my last season as a player, at Málaga, and Manuel Pellegrini had told me I wasn’t going to be a regular starter. In the beginning, it was difficult to accept. I was a player, not a coach, and I wanted to play.\n\n\"In the end, though, it made me transform my ideas and think: ‘OK, how can I help these guys?’ Off the pitch, I could give them advice on how to create a lifestyle that would benefit them as a player.\n\n\"On the pitch, I could help them improve – and the club at that time had lots of young attackers. Salomón Rondón was 23, Isco was 22, Juanmi only 19, Samu Castillejo – who later went to Milan – even younger.\n\n\"First on the mental side, and then later on the tactical and technical sides, I could help these guys. I started to build up a relationship with them. Through talking and training, I realised that, hey, I can have an influence. That really got me into coaching, and I went straight into doing my badges.\""
