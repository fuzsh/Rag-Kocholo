        "text": "Congratulations to all 1,732 determined hikers who reported completing the entire Appalachian Trail since 2019! The following list includes those who reported finishing thru-hikes of all types (flip-flops, southbound, etc.) and section hikes to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC). The number of thru-hike attempts and finishes in 2022 was just shy of the record number recorded in 2017. We received applications from hikers as far away as the Czech Republic and Australia. The ATC wants to thank all of those hikers who are also ATC members and encourages others to give back to the trail they love at: appalachiantrail.org/give\n\nPlease note: This marks the last year this listing will appear in the magazine. You can find all 2,000 miler names on our website at appalachiantrail.org/2000milers."
