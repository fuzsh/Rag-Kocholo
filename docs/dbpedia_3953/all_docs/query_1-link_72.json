OWEN United States Senator from Oklahoma, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency T gives me very great pleasure to have the opportunity of presenting to you as briefly as possible the substance of the pending bill, and the purpose of those who are charged with the duty of considering and perfecting that bill. In the first place, I wish to say that the committee of which I have the honor to be chairman has deeply felt its responsibility. The members have given this question the most careful and painstaking attention. They have desired to hear from every part of the country the different points of view of those who might enable the committee to understand better the great problem before it, and to accomplish its task in a manner acceptable to the country. I realize that the time is brief in which I may properly hold your attention, and for that reason I shall waste no words in coming directly to the meaning of this bill, its purpose and its plan. The great purpose of the bill is to prevent panic and to give greater stability to the commerce and finance of the United States, to make more efficient the resources which we have in the banking world and to put behind the business of the country the powerful support of the government. The principles of the bill are those which have been worked out successfully in the great civilized nations of western Europe—in England, Germany, France, Belgium, Holland. The first and most important feature of this bill, in my judgment, is that it concentrates and mobilizes the banking reserves of the nation (which are now not concentrated but widely scattered among 25,000 competing banks), making these concentrated reserves mobile, and more useful to the commerce I 1 Read at the meeting of the Academy of Political Science, October 14, 1913. (I) Digitized by Google 2 SECOND CURRENCY CONFERENCE [VOL. IV and industry of the nation. This will also protect the banks against one another in a dangerous struggle for reserves. The banks of the nation have fifteen hundred millions of gold, legal-tender notes, and other forms of money, which the United States by the Act of March 14th, 1900, is obliged to maintain at a parity with the gold dollar. Those reserves are held by 25,000 banks. This bill proposes to concentrate a part of these reserves in twelve reserve banks which are \" piped \" together, if I may use such an expression, by a provision that a Federal Reserve Board consisting of seven officers of the United States, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, shall have the right to require a reserve bank with idle funds to discount for another in need of current funds, thus meeting the needs of commerce. The amount of this reserve will be between four hundred and five hundred millions, after the system has become established, in about three years. The next important feature of this bill is to permit the issuance of United States notes, treasury notes, called federal reserve notes, to these twelve banks, upon commercial paper, safeguarded by a gold reserve of 33}^, and by the resources and double liability of the member banks. The possible issue of these notes is obviously large. In addition to these two important features, the mobilization of reserves, and the issuance of these elastic notes under conditions which should prevent undue inflation and which should cause automatic contraction, according to the necessities of our commerce, there are various other minor advantages in this measure. The most important advantage is that which, as a necessary corollary, flows from the concentration and mobilization of these reserves and the issuance of elastic currency notes, and that is a constant, stable market for commercial bills of a qualified class, which we do not have to a sufficient extent in the United States, but which has been developed to a very high degree in the European nations. This system will have the great advantage of giving protection for the future against financial panic, and that is one of its great purposes. There is another important purpose of this bill. At present the great banks in the central reserve cities are almost of neces(2) Digitized by Google No. i ] THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK BILL 3 sity compelled to carry a large part of the reserves of the nation as call loans on the stock market. The abatement of this use of the reserves of the country can be accomplished, to the advantage of the ethically managed banks, and to the advantage of the great merchants and business men of the country, who will thus have available for commerce these national reserves, supplemented by elastic currency, whereas these reserves are now held largely, and of necessity, as call loans, for the stock exchange. The effect of this new system will be to stabilize commerce and finance in the republic, and put an end to the violent fluctuations of interest rates on the stock exchange, which have a certain hypnotic effect upon the entire country, frequently affecting most injuriously the interests of those who are concerned in the great commercial enterprises of the nation. Another advantage proposed by this bill is the opening of this system freely to the state banks and trust companies, just as far as it can be done with safety. It will have another effect, namely, the lowering of the bank reserves, which will be entirely justified under this system. When the banks carry their reserves in the federal reserve banks, in case of need they can always obtain—not merely sometimes, but always—the discount of their qualified commercial paper, and thus use commercial paper to replenish the reserves in their own vaults. Another advantage of the bill is that it proposes to protect the two-per-cent bonds, which is obviously a just and righteous thing to do, because the banks bought these bonds upon the understanding that they should have the right to issue currency against them, and in my judgment the bonds ought not to be permitted by the United States to go below par, by reason of any government act or neglect which would lead to such depreciation below par. Another advantage of the new bill is that it will also lower the current reserves required to be kept against the savings deposits in the national banks, and permit those deposits to be utilized in greater degree in accomodations of an investment character, particularly in the making of farm loans, which under proper conditions can be made a marketable security. A (3) Digitized by Google 4 SECOND CURRENCY CONFERENCE [Vol. IV market could easily be built up for safeguarded farm mortgages and in that way we could greatly stimulate the productive energies of the agricultural sections of the country, upon which we all largely depend for the prosperity of the nation. This bill, of course, is only a step in the perfection of the financial system of the United States. We anticipate that in the near future a better system can be devised for obtaining long-time, low-rate loans for the agricultural development of the nation. But that is another problem, and cannot properly be involved in a bill of this character. Another advantage of the bill is that it permits national banks which are qualified to do so to establish foreign branches, and in that way to serve the foreign interests of our great merchants and those engaged in establishing foreign trade for the people of the United States. Another advantage of the bill is that of clearing checks at par; and that means the clearing of individual checks—not merely the checks of one reserve bank upon another reserve bank, but the clearing of individual checks—by the reserve banks through these federal reserve banks. There is a very large volume of these checks. They are cleared at par in some places, such as Boston, Kansas City, Atlanta and Nashville, but under this proposed system these checks would be cleared through the federal reserve banks everywhere, giving a much higher velocity to the great credit system of the United States. Another obvious advantage is the diminishing of the volume of these current checks by clearing them promptly through the federal reserve banks. There are certain objections which have been urged very strenuously to the provisions of this bill. The first great objection is that the banks of the country are not given representation on the Federal Reserve Board. The bankers strenuously urge that since they are required to put their money into the stock of these banks, and since they are expected to put certain reserves into these banks, they ought to have the right of representation on the Federal Reserve Board which exercises general supervision over this system. In the bill the banks are authorized to elect six out of nine directors managing each of (4) Digitized by Google No. i ] THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK BILL 5 the federal reserve banks, while the United States has but three out of the nine, appointed by the Federal Reserve Board. In that way the direct management and safeguarding of the funds in any federal reserve bank is in the hands of men selected by the banks themselves comprising the membership of that particular reserve bank. The appointment of three directors by the United States is more than justified, because the United States is expected to put in its own funds, between two hundred and three hundred millions, and to furnish its credit and power to the system. That is another great advantage of this system. It makes useful to the country from two to three hundred millions of money now locked up in the vaults of the Treasury of the United States. The answer to the demands of the bankers for part of the governmental control is first one of precedent, based upon human experience. The Bank of Germany, the Reichsbank, which is a great public utility bank, has its supervisory board, a curatorium, consisting of five men. At its head is the Chancellor of the Empire, with supreme authority over the Reichsbank. The Prussian Minister of Finance by custom is always nominated by the German Emperor as a member of the curatorium. The other three members of the curatorium are three members of the German Bundesrath, corresponding with our United States Senate. The nine directors who have administrative charge of the Reichsbank are all appointed by the German Emperor upon the nomination of the German Bundesrath. The stock is held individually by private persons who are content with government management. That bank has the right to issue legal-tender notes, elastic notes issued against commercial paper, and automatically retired under a penalty of five per cent interest. That German Bank is a great public utility bank, protecting the commerce and industry of the German Empire, and Germany sets a sound precedent in having its bank a purely government institution. Nobody ever charges it with being a political institution in an offensive sense. It would be regarded as scandalous and impossible for the directors to attempt to use the powats of the great institution for private or partisan purposes. It is impossible to think of such a thing. (S) Digitized by Google 6 SECOND CURRENCY CONFERENCE [VOL. IV The French Bank, the Bank of France, is the great public utility bank of France. Its governor, its sub-governor and the managers of the 188 branches of the Bank of France are appointed by the President of France upon the nomination of the Minister of Finance. The stock is held by private persons, but it is a governmentally controlled bank, so controlled because intended to protect the commerce and industry of the French Republic. The Bank of England in like fashion is a great public utility bank. It is not so well contrived, in my judgment, as either the Bank of Germany or the Bank of France; but upon the board of governors of the Bank of England is no banker, bill broker, or bill discounter. It has on its board some heads of acceptance houses, however—men familiar with great commercial enterprises, men trained in the school of commerce. The reason for this practise of England, Germany and France, is that these banks are great public utility banks. They are not exercising the function of making money for their stockholders, but they are safeguarding the commerce and industry of these nations, stabilizing the interest rate, protecting the national gold reserve, and giving stability to the business of those nations. In the United States these federal reserve banks are not to be mere private enterprises for the sole purpose of making money for the stockholders; although it is proposed by this bill to allow stockholders six per cent (I believe that is the consensus of opinion). It is not intended that the policy of these banks, however, should be to make money for the stockholders or directors; their function must be to protect the commerce of the nation, to stabilize the interest rate and to give permanency to the prosperity which this country ought to enjoy continuously, with its wonderful natural resources, and with the mutual patriotic cooperation of the splendid and powerful men who have been developed in the free atmosphere of America. Another objection urged by the bankers to this proposed bill is that the government should not issue the currency; that the currency ought to be issued by the banks. The answer to that (6) Digitized by Google No. i ] THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK BILL 7 is first an economic one. It may be argued that a bank note corresponds with a bank deposit, and the argument has validity as far as it goes—that is, in as far as the depositor of the bank would be content to receive the note of the bank in exchange for his deposit, but that does not state the whole truth. Those notes are made current throughout the United States. The government of the United States by Act of March 14, 1900, is compelled to maintain those notes on a parity with the gold dollar; and ought to be so compelled, because those notes are current from hand to hand among our citizens, and no citizen ought to be required to pause for a moment to ascertain the condition of the bank emitting that note. When he takes a dollar under the safeguard of this great nation of ours he ought to be assured that that dollar is as good as a gold dollar. For that economic reason it is better that the dollar which is issued should be a dollar issued by the government of the United States as a direct government obligation. After all, the government is obliged to redeem it under the law. Even the holder of a national bank note has the right to demand redemption in legal tender, and the holder of legal tender has the right to demand redemption in gold; and the Act of March 14, 1900, requires the United States to maintain these national bank notes and all other current money on a parity with gold. So, since the note of all of the people is better than the note of some of the people, and since it is obviously a wise economic policy to have the dollars which are current throughout our country of the very highest character, the attitude of the administration in having these federal reserve notes government notes is fully justified. Moreover, the issue of such currency has a positive money earning power of over one per cent which ought to belong to and be enjoyed by the United States and not by private bankers. There is also a political reason. The Democratic national platform has three times in the last sixteen years declared against the issue of the money of the nation by private corporations and in favor of the issuance of the currency by the nation itself. The country banks have raised a great cry against the clear(7) Digitized by Google 8 SECOND CURRENCY CONFERENCE [VOL. IV ing of individual checks at par by the federal reserve banks. They say that they will lose money by it. The answer to that is that this bill provides that they may charge their customers for these checks. They reply that their \" customers will not stand for it;\" that they prefer to have these checks charged to the merchants of the cities; that is, that when these checks come back to the country banks for collection they will then charge collection and exchange to the merchants in the cities, who receive these local checks and send them for collection, under the obvious idea that the merchants of the cities are not aware that they are being taxed in this small way, and under the idea, I suppose, that the customers of the country banks are making a profit at the expense of the city merchants, and that the city merchants have no way of recouping themselves. I take it that the city merchants are able to take care of themselves in a trade of that kind, and that the charge at last rests where it belongs, upon the local customer of the country bank. The bill can easily provide that the Federal Reserve Board shall fix the rates to be charged upon these checks, and the country banker need not lose anything he is justly entitled to. If he transfers funds from a country town to St. Louis, Chicago, or New York, he performs for the depositor a service for which he has a just right to charge. The Federal Reserve Board can fix that charge so there will be no extortion on the one side or failure to pay justly on the other. I have given you a brief sketch of this matter, and if because of the brief time I am privileged to speak I have not covered certain points so as to be perfectly clear, if any gentlemen desire to ask me any questions I shall be glad to answer them. A VOICE: Have you or the administration any objection to the Federal Reserve Board being appointed for life in a similar manner to the Supreme Court justices, in order that there may be no suspicion of political influence? Has that thought been considered at all ? MR. OWEN: NO, that thought has not been considered. Nobody has ever suggested a life appointment. The directors of the German Bank are appointed for life, but in our country men live too long to be appointed for life. They may become (8) Digitized by Google No. i ] THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK BILL 9 decrepit. They may become afflicted with mental decadence or with physical weakness. They may become from a variety of physical or mental causes unfit to continue in office. But it has been thought wise to give them a term of eight, ten or twelve years—a sufficient length of time to make the positions attractive to great men. No man ought to go on that board who is not a great man, the equal intellectually, morally, ethically, in every respect, of any man who adorns our great Supreme Court bench. A VOICE : Do you think an eight-years' appointment would bring these great men ? MR. OWEN : I think it would. We have a great many men in this country who, having made their own fortunes and having distinguished themselves in commerce and finance, would be willing and glad to render public service to their countrymen. MR. SELIGMAN : A great many people seriously question the right, or advisability, of the Federal Reserve Board's compelling the reserve banks to discount for one another. That is a thing that has caused trouble in the minds of a great many people. MR. OWEN : The nearest approach we can get to a central bank with twelve regional banks is to \" pipe\" the regional banks under the safeguard of a wise and conservative administration. MR. SELIGMAN: Is it a safe cooperation? MR. OWEN : It is as safe as to put the funds in a common reservoir with no requirement of cooperation needed. A VOICE: Why should the national banks be compelled to go into the organization? MR. OWEN : They are not compelled to come into the organization. They can go out of it if they don't like it. The national banks of this country have been formed in accordance with the national banking law. Our banking system has proved to be a great commercial system for the United States. It has developed the industry of the little village and of the cross-road. It has preserved the savings of the people of the small town for use in that town, and in this way has preserved the unit upon which the greatness of America must rest and does rest. These (9) Digitized by Google IO SECOND CURRENCY CONFERENCE [VOL. IV national banks which have been built up are of necessity supervised by the government, because our system is different from the branch banking systems of Europe, where one great banking house puts a branch here, there and yonder, and with its by-laws controls each branch. Through the provisions of its banking laws and the checks provided by the comptroller of the currency and his examiners, the United States government provides for the protection of the smaller banks against the unwisdom and inexperience which might easily be found where a few men come together with $25,000 in a small town and go into the banking business without experience in that business. The government places at their disposal the large banking experience of the country. The small banks are instructed continuously against putting themselves in jeopardy by unwise banking. When the government of the United States establishes this new system, which has been found necessary to prevent panics, and gives the national banks as well as the state banks and trust companies the advantage of cooperation, under government safeguard, if a national bank happens to be unwilling to conform to the reasonable and just requirements demanded by the national welfare and the bank's own best interest, it would be a vital error on the part of the government to permit this whole system to be destroyed, by leaving it optional whether a bank avails itself of it or not. If the indifference of a bank, its lack of understanding, its apathy, its neglect or its ignorance of the law and its advantages is to be controlling, the system would not be established with any certainty. Men would stand off and say, \" Let others join this ; I will see how it works before I go into it.\" The consequence would be that the possible advantages of this system would not be realized. It is a righteous and just thing that when the government has worked out carefully the details of this plan, and after long study is well assured of its advantages, having put the microscope upon the bill with extreme care to see that it is just and sound in every particular—it is righteous and just, I say, to make the plan compulsory. Obviously the system itself cannot be permitted to fall by leaving it merely optional. It ought to be made a success. It deserves (10) Digitized by Google No. i] THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK BILL \\\\ to be made a success. The national interest requires and therefore justifies it. A VOICE : It seems to me that there are two viewpoints. In the first place, if the national banks, which hold about onethird of the banking resources of the country, do not come in, the state banks are quite apt not to come in. And if the national banks are compelled to come in if they do not want to, why should not they have the option of having their bonds redeemed at par ? How can the system be a success if only onethird of the banks come in ? M R . OWEN : The national banks have about eight thousand millions of resources. The state and other banks have about nine thousand millions of resources, and they are abundantly strong to make this system a success. I have not the slightest doubt in the world that the national banks will as a class almost unanimously avail themselves of this system. The proper attitude of the government toward the bonds I have already explained. («) Digitized by Google THE OPPOSITION TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK BILL' CARTER GLASS Representative from the Sixth Congressional District of Virginia, Chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Currency I T is generally agreed that there is a pressing necessity for currency legislation in this country. The country itself thinks so, if any significance may be attached to the thousands of letters received by the banking and currency committee of the House within the last six months, or to the resolutions passed by hundreds of commercial bodies throughout the United States, calling for immediate consideration and action by Congress. From every quarter and from all classes of citizens the demand has proceeded. For more than a quarter of a century there have been strong symptoms of an intense dissatisfaction with the prevailing national banking and currency system, and this spirit of discontent has been accentuated as from time to time the utter inadequacy of the system has been made manifest in periods of financial peril. While the existing system has operated satisfactorily under ordinary business conditions, and while the administration of the system for the fifty years of its history furnishes a high tribute to the integrity and efficiency of those concerned in its operation and oversight, its very best friend is bound to admit that in time of stress and storm it has broken down utterly. This has occurred so often, and the ensuing disaster has been so dreadful as to cause the banking experts of other nations and practical financiers everywhere to marvel at our continued failure either to adopt a better system or to correct the evils of the one we have. While we may boast that no note holder has ever lost a dollar and that the losses of depositors constitute an inconsiderable percentage of the total 'Read by title at the meeting of the Academy of Political Science, October 14, 1913. (12) Digitized by Google OPPOSITION TO FEDERAL RESER VE BANK BILL \\3 liabilities of the banks, nevertheless the failure of the system in acute exigencies has caused widespread business demoralization and almost universal distress. Five times within the last thirty years financial catastrophe has overtaken the country under this system, and it would be difficult to compute the enormous losses sustained by all classes of society—by the bankers immediately involved, by the merchants whose credits were curtailed, by the investors whose shops were closed, by the railroads whose cars were stopped, by the farmers whose crops rotted in the fields and by the laborers who were deprived of their wages. The system breaks down in emergencies. For years, the business and banking mind has been casting about for a remedy, but into the story of this quarter-century of ineffectual efforts for reform I have no time to go. Suffice it to say that all political parties are now committed to a solution of this problem, and the public is demanding prompt action. The chief and everlasting curse of attempted banking and currency legislation in this country has been the proneness of public men to procrastinate. When the Vreeland-Aldrich makeshift was adopted, ex-Secretary Lyman J. Gage warned the committee and Congress that the bill was \" merely a dangerous narcotic to lull the nation to sleep, from which slumber it would some day awaken in agony.\" We should no longer, from habit or timidity, gravely shake our heads and insist that we \" will not be hurried in this matter,\" that we want further time for consideration, that we must have other hearings and additional information. Sometimes I am led to wonder what sort of information is wanted by the men who continually plead for delay. There is no theme on earth upon which information may be more readily obtained than upon the currency question; there is no topic upon which we have more authoritative expert expression; and there are few subjects upon the general principles of which expert opinions are in greater accord. If it did no other good, the National Monetary Commission, at a cost of approximately one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, assembled a great library on the subject of banking and currency reform, which for two years has been accessible to every member of Congress and to the public. Less than six (13) Digitized by Google I4 SECOND CURRENCY CONFERENCE [VOL. IV months ago the banking and currency committee of the House closed exhaustive hearings on this subject, at which representatives of every important known national group testified—big bankers and little bankers, merchants and farmers, credit men and manufacturers, currency experts, laboring men and textbook writers. There is scarcely a provision of this pending currency bill which may not be related to those hearings. They took the widest range and reflected every conceivable variety of opinion and there is absolutely no excuse for further delay. The limited time allotted to me, therefore, I shall devote to the consideration of the three most prominent criticisms which have been made against the bill. It is urged: first, that the bill confers dangerously autocratic powers upon the Federal Reserve Board, an alleged political board, and that the banks should be given direct representation upon this board; second, that it is unjust and confiscatory to require national banks to join the system on penalty of forfeiting their national charters if they fail to do so; third, that it is unreasonable and contrary to the best banking practise to deny to banks joining a regional reserve bank the privilege of counting deposits with reserve agents as lawful reserve money. These are the three criticisms which have been most persistently and vigorously hurled against the bill. If one accepted them with the broad generalizations and predictions of dire calamity with which they are usually made, he would be forced to conclude that the very foundations, not only of sound banking, but also of justice and business morality, were being assailed. In reality, these features of the bill contain nothing that is either new or startling. The Federal Reserve Board is essentially a supervisory board, and clearly should not represent any section, faction or type of business interest. It should represent the public as a whole. There is only one way of securing a board of this kind, namely, to have it appointed by the President of the United States, who alone is the elected representative of the entire nation. That is the way we select the Secretary of the Treasury and the comptroller of the currency, in whom have been vested for half a century by the national banking act (M) Digitized by Google No. i] OPPOSITION TO FEDERAL RESERVE BANK BILL 15 many of the powers conferred by this bill upon the Federal Reserve Board. That is the way we select the interstate commerce commission, whose actual power over the railroads of the country is much greater than that which will be exercised over the banks by the proposed Federal Reserve Board. When the Aldrich plan was before the country, the European bank which its sponsors most often cited as a helpful example for the United States and the one to which they gave more attention in their report than to all the others combined, was the Imperial Bank of Germany. The following brief description of the control of the Reichsbank is taken from an interview with two of its officers, which was published by the monetary commission: * [The capital] is all private ownership. . . . The government owns no shares. [In our organization] we have, so to speak, three boards: first, the Curatorium; second, the Direktorium (president and directors); third, the Central Ausschuss [or Central Committee]. The Curatorium is composed of five members. The chairman is the Chancellor of the Empire. The Emperor appoints the second member, and it has been the custom to appoint the Prussian Minister of Finance. The Bundesrath [the upper house of the imperial legislature] appoint from among their own number three members, which completes the Board. . . . In the Chancellor lies supreme power although he has exercised it but once in the history of the bank. The Direktorium . . . is appointed by the Emperor for life. It consists of nine members, seven of whom are directors, and two of whom are the president and vice-president, respectively. The president and the other members of the Direktorium are recommended by the Bundesrath to the Emperor, who makes the appointment. In the case of the directors, the advice of the Central Ausschuss is heard. The third body . . . [namely, the Central Committee] is composed of fifteen stockholders who are elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders, together with fifteen alternates, who serve in the absence of any of the members of the board. . . . The Central Ausschuss [Committee] are made familiar with the transactions carried on by the 1 Interviews on the Banking and Currency Systems of England, Scotland, France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.

IV bank, and give their advice and recommendations to the Direktorium in reference thereto. In practise, their advice is generally carefully considered and taken. . . . The management is so constituted that the government has actual and final control through the Curatorium. The business of the bank is transacted by the second body, the Direktorium. Here we have one of the most successful banks of Europe— a bank which possesses practically every power that the bill before Congress would confer upon the Federal Reserve Board and upon the regional bank boards combined, and which, in addition, does a regular banking business with the public, competing with other banks. It has a practical monopoly of note issue, it is the depository of government funds, it holds the bulk of the bank reserve money of the empire, and it performs for banks and public alike most of the transfer and exchange business of the country. Yet this situation is controlled almost absolutely by politically appointed boards. The administration's plan does not begin to go so far in the direction of government control, since the real banking functions in the proposed plan are entrusted to the boards of the regional banks, two-thirds of whose members are elected by bankers, the functions entrusted to the Federal Reserve Board being almost entirely supervisory functions except a few carefully guarded ones which will be exercised only in times of great emergency, and then in the searching light of publicity. Although the members of the Federal Reserve Board will all be appointed by the President of the United States, the board will not be a political board in any narrow sense of that term. It is my earnest conviction, based upon long and serious reflection, that no man can conceive—as none has yet pointed out— how any part of this system can be perverted to political uses. In my judgment, if the United States has ever had a President ingenious enough to do this evil thing, it has never had one desperate enough and will never have one shameless enough thus to betray the confidence of the nation. I happened to be present when an eminent banker suggested such a possibility to the present occupant of the executive chair, and heard this banker promptly challenged to show how it might be done. I (16) Digitized by Google No. i ] OPPOSITION TO FEDERAL RESERVE BANK BILL \\-j shall not soon forget the emphasis with which the President of the United States declared that no man would ever be found willing to imperil his reputation or tarnish his fame by so flagrant a prostitution of his high office. The X-ray of publicity is turned full upon the operations of the Federal Reserve Board. There can be nothing sinister about its transactions. Meeting with it at least four times a year, and perhaps oftener, will be a bankers' advisory council, representing every regional reserve district in the system. This council will have access to the records of the board, and is authorized to give advice and offer suggestions concerning its general policy. How could we have exercised greater caution in safeguarding the public interest? The second criticism of the bill relates to the so-called compulsory feature. Critics allege that it is unjust and confiscatory to compel national banks to invest part of their capital in a federal reserve bank, on penalty of forfeiture of their national charters if they fail to do so. Many of these same critics, however, have been for years criticizing the federal government for its inadequate and unscientific national banking laws, under which the country's credit system has again and again broken down, to the distress of banker, merchant, farmer and laborer alike. Now the national government is about to effect a thorough-going reform of these same defective banking laws, in the interest of the entire public. To be successful, the newlycreated federal reserve banks must be strong and must inspire confidence from the start. If sacrifices are involved in joining the new system, these sacrifices should be borne by all, not merely by those bankers who are at once wide-awake and public-spirited. I ask you in all fairness, is it unreasonable for the government to say to the national banks, \" If you wish to retain the name ' national,' and to enjoy the privileges which are conferred upon banks chartered by the national government, you must assume the obligations which the national government believes the dictates of sound banking require in the public interest. If you do not wish to do so, you are perfectly free to give up your federal charter and to accept the privileges and assume the obligations which state charters involve. You may have a year to decide, but if you are to remain permanently in (17) Digitized by Google 18 SECOND CURRENCY CONFERENCE [VOL. IV the national system, you must expect to play the game according to the national rules.\" The real opposition to this bill, however, is not as to gov- . ernment control, upon which we shall never yield. It is not as to compulsory membership, which was provided in another way in the Aldrich scheme, a scheme that was unanimously endorsed by the American Bankers' Association. It is not as to the required capital subscription or the five-per-cent dividend. It is none of these. It is as to that most vital requirement of the bill, that in the future, funds on deposit in other national banks cannot be counted as legal reserve. This means an immediate loss of profits to many bankers—I say immediate, for in the long run the change will benefit bankers as well as the public—and it is the prospect of this loss that explains most of the organized opposition to the bill. The fight is to drive us from our firm resolution to break down the artificial connection between the banking business of this country and the stock speculative operations at the money centers. The monetary commission, with more discretion than courage, absolutely evaded the problem; but the banking and currency committee of the House has gone to the very root of this gigantic evil, and in this bill proposes to cut the cancer out. Under existing law, we have permitted the banks to pyramid credit upon credit, and to call these credits reserves. It is a misnomer. They are not reserves, and when financial troubles come and the country banks call for their money with which to pay their creditors, they find it is invested in stock-gambling operations. There is suspension of payment and the whole system breaks down under the strain, causing widespread confusion and almost inconceivable damage. The avowed purpose of this bill is to cure this evil, to withdraw the reserve funds of the country from the congested money centers and to make them readily available for business uses in the various sections of the country to which they belong. This we propose to do cautiously, without any shock to the existing arrangement, graduating the operation to prevalent conditions, and extending it over a period of thirty-six months. This affords ample time to the reserve and central reserve city banks to adjust conditions 08) Digitized by Google No. il OPPOSITION TO FEDERAL RESERVE BANK BILL 19 to the reserve requirements of the new system. Out of abundant caution, we have allowed actually longer time than the best practical bankers of the country have said was needed. But the complaint of these critics is not as to the time, but as to the fact. They do not want existing arrangements disturbed ; they are willing to perpetuate a defective, unscientific system sanctioned by law but condemned by experience and bitterly offensive to the American people—a system which everybody knows encourages and promotes the worst description of stock gambling. In conclusion, let me repeat: the time for action on this great question is now, while the public interest is alive, and while we can act with that caution and deliberation which is impossible when the country is in the throes of a financial panic. To those who advocate further delay in the hope thereby of securing legislation which they consider more conservative or more favorable to the banking interests, I say with all the seriousness at my command, that they are pursuing a false hope. The most vigorous opposition to this bill has been from those who want a more radical measure. If legislation now is postponed until the public is goaded by another panic, you may rest assured that the resulting legislation will be more radical—yes, far more radical—than that contained in the present bill. (19) Digitized by Google THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT: A REPLY TO CRITICISMS' ROBERT J. BULKLEY Representative from the Twenty-First Congressional District of Ohio, Member of the House Committee on Banking and Currency I T is obviously impossible within the limit of time at our disposal either to explain fully the Owen-Glass bill, or to discuss fully all the criticisms that have been leveled against it. I shall assume that the bill has been sufficiently explained to you already, and that you understand its purpose and general outline. I desire to treat some of the criticisms which have been made against the bill and to discuss them from a point of view slightly different from that which Senator Owen has adopted. In selecting the criticisms to be discussed, I have decided to take up those of the Honorable A. Piatt Andrew, formerly assistant secretary of the treasury, former secretary of the National Monetary Commission, and one of the authors of the Aldrich plan, and the criticisms made by the American Bankers' Association. I do this because Dr. Andrew is a thorough student of the subject, and his connection with the Aldrich plan entitles his criticism of our plan to careful consideration; and because the American Bankers' Association may be presumed to represent in the most official way that body of men which is most directly interested in the bill. Dr. Andrew insists principally upon three criticisms. He criticizes the number of the reserve banks which we propose to establish. He criticizes the provision with respect to note issues, and expresses the fear that the bill will result in a great inflation. He also criticizes, but does not so much emphasize, the danger of political control and the so-called compulsory membership of national banks in the federal reserve banks. 'Address at the meeting of the Academy of Political Science, October 14, 1913. (20) Digitized by Google THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT 21 The American Bankers' Association, on the contrary, suggests the danger of a great contraction. They attack the constitutionality of the measure, but lay particular emphasis upon the compulsion—the driving of the national banks into membership in this organization—and upon the feature of exclusive governmental control. We all know that it is easier to criticize than to construct. It therefore seems fair that in analyzing the criticisms of this bill, we should compare the constructive work of our critics with our own work. I shall therefore take the liberty of comparing the provisions criticized in our bill with the corresponding provisions of the Aldrich plan, of which Dr. Andrew is one of the authors, and which was unanimously endorsed two years ago by the American Bankers' Association in New Orleans. To take up the criticisms, then,—first, the criticism has been made of the proposed establishment of twelve regional reserve banks, and the American Bankers' Association has suggested that the number be reduced to not more than five. But the representatives whom they delegated to present their criticisms to the Senate committee on banking and currency were frank to say that the real preference of the association was for one central bank, as provided in the Aldrich plan. They say that the establishment of as many as twelve regional banks will so divide up the reserve money of the country that the proposed mobilization of reserves will not be effective. It is admitted, I understand, that the power given to the Federal Reserve Board to compel one regional bank to rediscount for another would measurably offset the dangers arising from a scattering of the reserves among twelve regional banks, but it is contended that this power is in itself a dangerous element because of the possibility that it might be abused for political purposes, which means, presumably, purposes of partisan politics. In fact, the power could not be so used, because, by the terms of the bill, rediscounts may be compelled only upon the unanimous vote of the Federal Reserve Board, which must have in its membership at least two representatives of political parties not in power. Let us examine the alternative of one central bank, as provided by the Aldrich plan. Under that plan the central bank (21) Digitized by Google 22 SECOND CURRENCY CONFERENCE [VOL. IV was to rediscount the paper of the constituent banks through its branches. It is not clear whether this meant that the paper offered for rediscount was to be passed upon by the central board, by the board of directors of the local branch, or solely by the branch manager, who was to be the representative of the central bank. Any of these methods would be much inferior to the provisions of the Owen-Glass bill; because if the central board were to undertake to handle the matter directly, either it would have to depend absolutely upon the judgment of its one representative; or if either the board of directors or the executive committee should attempt to exercise its own judgment, it would act under the disadvantage of lack of familiarity with local credits and conditions. If this function were entrusted to the board of directors of the local branch, those directors would be placed in a position of lending the money of the central bank to the constituent banks which elected them to office. In other words, the banks to whom the members of the local boards owed their positions would be interested ioo^b as borrowers, and only about jjo as lenders. Thus there would be a much stronger pressure to accept questionable paper than if the local board were lending the money of its own constituent banks. Each independent regional bank under the Owen-Glass plan would have a territory approximately equal to that of one of the branches under the Aldrich plan, and it could therefore be presumed that the directors would have about the same degree of familiarity with local credits and conditions as the directors of the branches under the Aldrich plan, but under the OwenGlass plan their responsibility as lenders would be as great as their responsibility as borrowers, which would not have been the case under the Aldrich plan. Turning now to the question of note issues, the currency provided for by the Aldrich plan was to consist of notes of the National Reserve Association, to be issued in the discretion of the directors of the association. These were to be redeemable on demand in lawful money, and behind them there was to be held nominally a reserve of $of> in lawful money. I put some emphasis upon the word \" nominally,\" because practically the (22) Digitized by Google No. i ] THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT 23 reserve required was considerably less than 50^. In the first place, the reserve was to be held against all demand liabilities, including deposit liabilities. But from the aggregate amount of such liabilities there was permitted a deduction of some $350,000,000 before computing the required 50^ reserve. Then it was possible for the board of directors to go below the SOjb reserve in their discretion, the only penalty being the payment of a graduated tax on the amount of the deficiency. But, inasmuch as the payment of this tax would not affect the dividends to be paid to the banks which elected the directors and would only reduce the amount of profit going to the government, which had only a small minority representation on the board of directors, it will be seen that there would not be much inducement to keep up the reserve if the interest of the banks would be served by letting it go down. The notes issued by the reserve association would have been available as reserve money in the constituent banks, and inasmuch as they were to be legal tenders for debts due to the government and to the banks, there would be practically no inducement to present them for redemption. And in fact there would have been no redemption of these notes except as they happened to come into the central bank in the ordinary course of business. Therefore the element of elasticity was entirely lacking, ready means being provided for the expansion of note issues without check even by any government representative, and no inducement existing for the contracting of such issues. Under the Owen-Glass plan the proposed federal reserve notes will come back for redemption as soon as they have served their immediate purpose, because they cannot be counted as reserve money by constituent banks, because the collateral specifically placed behind them will be constantly maturing and cannot be replaced without the consent of the Federal Reserve Board, and further, because the federal reserve banks borrowing such notes will be paying interest upon them, which interest will be a real charge against the possible profits of their stockholders. Mr. Vanderlip has suggested that the proposed federal reserve note issue would lack the quality of easy contraction because the notes would to a large extent become impounded (23) Digitized by Google 24 SECOND CURRENCY CONFERENCE [VOL. IV in the reserves of state banks not members of the system. He could fairly have said this—and more—in criticism of the Aldrich notes, but in saying it about the notes provided in the pending bill he overlooks the fact that these notes may be redeemed in the same manner as existing national bank circulation, that is to say, by the deposit of lawful money in a fund to be held in trust for the redemption of the notes. The impounding of lawful money in such a trust fund has, of course, the same effect in contracting the circulation as the actual return and retirement of the notes themselves. The federal reserve notes of the Owen-Glass plan have, therefore, complete elasticity —a quality which the Aldrich notes would not have had. Dr. Andrew says he is afraid of \" greenbackism,\" which means—if it means anything—the issue of currency upon the mere fiat of the government, without actual value behind it, and the danger of it lies in inflation of the currency. Yet the federal reserve notes can be issued only when loojfc of prime commercial paper plus 33^ of lawful money is actually deposited to secure them; that is, there must be $1.33 of good security directly hypothecated to secure every dollar of such notes in circulation. This is very far from fiat money. And if it be urged that there is still danger of the inflation of such an issue, I will remind our critics that these notes can be issued only upon application of the banks themselves. Inflation could not follow except as the result of the bad judgment of the bankers of the country. And if it is to be presumed that the bankers will use bad judgment, what would have saved us from inflation under the Aldrich plan with its looser requirements as to security behind the notes ? The Owen-Glass plan, however, provides a further check against inflation because it gives the Federal Reserve Board the absolute right to stop it—a safeguard not contained in the Aldrich plan. The American Bankers' Association, although it once indorsed the Aldrich plan in toto, has apparently seen new light since taking that action, and last week in Boston it indorsed the amendments to the pending bill prepared by its currency commission and adopted last August by the so-called Chicago bankers' conference. The bankers' association now proposes (24) Digitized by Google No. i ] THE FEDERAL RESERVE AC! 25 a note issue by the federal reserve banks, with the permission of the Federal Reserve Board. This permission is an important check against inflation not provided by the Aldrich plan. As proposed by the bankers, however, it would only half accomplish the purpose; it would give the Federal Reserve Board the power to prevent too many notes going out, but would not enable it to force them in by raising the rate of interest on the notes or by refusing to permit paper deposited as collateral to be replaced at maturity. So far as elasticity is concerned, this note issue proposed by the bankers would be fairly subject to Mr. Vanderlip's criticism. Notes impounded in reserves of non-member banks could not be redeemed, and therefore the issue would not have the same power of contraction as is provided under the Owen-Glass plan. None of the arguments ordinarily used against a government note issue is fairly applicable to the plan proposed in the pending bill, and it does seem as though the objections now being urged are to a large extent sentimental, or else based upon an unwillingness to recede from a dogmatic position that the government should not issue notes. Nobody seriously contends that there is the slightest danger of the government ever being called upon to make good any loss arising from the inability of the banks to maintain the proposed note issue. Yet it is more or less seriously suggested that if such an impossibility should occur, it might be very embarrassing to the government. So it might; but in such a contingency I do not hesitate to say that I would prefer to have the government take the loss and suffer the embarrassment attendant upon it, rather than to have such a loss fall upon the innocent holders of the notes. Much has been made of the contention that a bank ought to have as good a right to supply its customers with credit in the form of notes as in the form of book accounts. I cannot believe that this is the real issue: the banks do not want merely the right to put their promise to pay on a piece of paper and let it circulate as far as it will. A certified check endorsed to bearer would accomplish that, but would come back for redemption too quickly to suit them. What they want is an issue of notes produced by the government bureau of printing and engraving, (25) Digitized by Google 26 SECOND CURRENCY CONFERENCE [VOL. IV an issue which the laborer, the farmer, and the people generally, excepting only those technically educated in banking, will think is money and will hold as money. The distinction between a bank note and currency is perhaps not very well founded technically, but practically in this country it is a very real one, as we have all been brought up to the use of government currency and we all feel a little bit safer when we receive for our property or services a note with the government's mark on it. This, too, may be in part sentimental, but it is as well founded in logic as any uncompromising prejudice against government currency, and it is a sentiment pretty widely felt by the people of this country. I hope the members of this Academy will consider the suggestions I have here made with this question in mind: Could we provide such an adequate system of redemption as we have here provided, could we provide the same amount of public satisfaction that the proposed note issue will give, in any other way than by government currency issued through the banks? Remember, too, that the Federal Reserve Board cannot bring about inflation but may always stop it, and may at any time force contraction. By no possibility can credit or currency inflation occur without the prior application of the bankers themselves. Dr. Andrew takes occasion to express the fear that the rediscount provisions of the Owen-Glass bill may result in great inflation. There is no time to go into figures here, but it may be conceded that an inflation would be possible under the rediscount and reserve provisions of this bill, though the possible inflation would not be nearly so great as the inflation made possible by the corresponding provisions of the Aldrich plan. Under either plan much would depend upon the discretion and good judgment of those in control. But this important consideration must always be borne in mind: Inflation would be impossible under either plan unless the bankers permitted it; under the Aldrich plan if the bankers wanted to permit it, they would do so, but under the Owen-Glass plan if the bankers wanted to permit it, they might still be checked by the government representatives. (26) Digitized by Google No. i ] THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT 27 Personally I agree fully with Dr. Andrew's suggestion that suspension of reserve requirements should be automatic rather than discretionary, and I am free to admit that in my judgment our bill allows to the Federal Reserve Board an unnecessary discretion on this point. Nevertheless, it is still better than the Aldrich plan which Dr. Andrew advocates, because, as we have already seen, the tax on deficiencies therein provided was a tax which would not fall upon those responsible for the deficiency. Furthermore, the Aldrich plan did not even propose to tax deficiencies in reserves of the member banks. The pending bill provides that if the Federal Reserve Board does permit a deficiency in reserves, it must impose a graduated tax upon such deficiency, and this tax does fall upon those who are responsible for the deficiency, whether they be federal reserve banks or constituent member banks. Turning to the criticisms of the American Bankers' Association, prepared by their currency commission, and recently endorsed by the association at its Boston meeting, the report of that commission seems to have been written in bad temper and does not seem consistent with the dignity and fairness which such a body ought to possess. It states that the pending bill imposes great hardships on the banks and on the public generally. Some of the alleged hardships on the banks are specified, but there is no specification of the hardships which are said to be inflicted upon the public, except an implication that the bill would cause capital to be withdrawn from business, or in other words, that the bill would cause a contraction of credit. The association seems willing to make this implication, though unwilling to make the direct statement that credit would be contracted. Mr. James B. Forgan of Chicago and Mr. Arthur Reynolds of Des Moines, president of the American Bankers' Association, individually predicted a great contraction. Mr. Reynolds made no argument to support his prediction, and Mr. Forgan's argument on the subject has already been completely refuted. Such eminent bankers as Mr. Vanderlip, of this city, Mr. George M. Reynolds of Chicago and Mr. Sol Wexler of New Orleans admit that the reserve provisions of the pending bill are correct in theory and ultimately workable, though I be(27) Digitized by Google 28 SECOND CURRENCY CONFERENCE [VOL. IV lieve they express some doubt as to whether there may not be a little embarrassment during the period of readjustment to the new conditions. In any case, the contraction argument has been thoroughly exploded. The report approved by the bankers' association proceeds to question the constitutionality of the pending measure, on the ground that the provision requiring national banks to buy stock in the federal reserve banks amounts to depriving them of their property without due process of law. The fact is that the statute under which the national banks are chartered reserves to Congress the right to alter, amend or repeal. The situation has been best explained by my colleague, ex-Governor Montague of Virginia, whom I quote: In this bill no bank is required to enter the banking business under the new provisions, and there is no confiscation of existing banks upon failure so to do. It is true there is a dissolution of existing charters after the expiration of a certain time, a power to impose such a dissolution having been reserved in their charters and accepted by the existing banks. None of the imaginary hardships and confiscations predicted can come to any bank unless it voluntarily enters the system containing these regulatory provisions. The contract, therefore, is the reserved right of Congress to amend or repeal these charters—contracts assented to when the several banks were organized—and if the banks now resist such amendment or repeal it is they who violate the contract and not the government. Governor Montague also cites the case of Noble State Bank v. Haskell,' decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, which involves almost the identical question here presented. At a dinner of the Economic Club in Boston last week, I called these arguments to the attention of the gentleman who was present as representative of the American Bankers' Association, and who was a member of the currency commission which prepared the resolutions. I challenged him to say whether his commission had considered the question, and whether he himself believed that the bill was unconstitutional. His answer was that he did not know, nor care, whether the provision was 1 219 U. s . 104. (a8) Digitized by Google No. i ] THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT 29 unconstitutional or not. Possibly the members of the American Bankers' Association do not care much about constitutional questions, but when they pass resolutions charging that a bill publicly endorsed by the President of the United States and passed by the House of Representatives is an unconstitutional measure seeking to confiscate their property, they ought to care whether what they say has any foundation or not. The final question raised is that of government control. That is really the big issue, the issue which more than any other up to this time seems irreconcilable, although the bankers have come far in admitting that the government ought to have a majority of the controlling board. I think I should be somewhat lacking in frankness, if I did not say that in my judgment there is some danger of political control accompanying the provisions of this bill. I do not wish to be understood as conceding the exaggerated arguments that have been made on this point, for I think they have been much exaggerated, but I think that in the course of time there may be some danger of developing under this plan an undesirable political control. But what is the alternative? It seems to me that it is more important that the people of this country should be protected against the threat of the manipulation of credits in private and irresponsible hands, than that they should be protected against political danger. The government is always responsible. The people have the right to see what is going on while it is going on, and they have the ballot to correct whatever does go wrong. Let it be admitted that it will be necessary for the people to watch their servants and hold them to strict account. Eternal vigilance is still the price of liberty. That may be admitted, and still we may say that we must have governmental control. Banking is a public utility. It is so recognized in the European countries, and it is coming to be so recognized in this country. It will not do for the bankers to keep on talking about being permitted to do what they will with their own. The property under their management is not all their own. The property belongs primarily to the depositors of the United States. Of course the bankers have the confidence of those depositors, for the public will not deposit (29) Digitized by Google 30 SECOND CURRENCY CONFERENCE with a bank unless they have confidence in it; but they do not deposit merely because they have confidence in the bank; they deposit because they must deposit in order to have the facilities for business. It is a necessity, and it is a public utility in that sense. A few years ago we heard a great deal from those in control of the great life-insurance companies on this subject of being permitted to do what they would with their own; but their spirit has been very much chastened recently. The railroads and other public utilities are not allowed, without let or hindrance, to do what they will with their own, and their property is more their own than is the property controlled by the bankers. These public utilities have had restrictions put upon their right to do what they will with their own, and the time is coming when the bankers must come to see and expect this as necessary. Again I say, there is going to be governmental control, and I sincerely hope that you gentlemen of the Academy of Political Science and you gentlemen of the Chamber of Commerce, even those of you who have your daily work in Wall Street, will recognize the necessity for such control, and will use your best efforts in cooperating to make that control wise and beneficial to the people of the United States.

ALDRICH Ex-Senator from Rhode Island, Chairman of the National Monetary Commission A NY intelligent criticism of legislative proposals for banking and monetary reform must be based on a knowledge of existing conditions and of the present and prospective needs of the country, and a clear understanding of the defects to be cured and the evils to be avoided, as well as the nature of the remedies to be adopted. The magnitude of the interests to be affected favorably or unfavorably by suggested changes should lead us to exercise the greatest care in the formation of our judgments, and to see to it that we are not influenced in our opinions by local or other prejudices. Statistics are available to show the extent of the banking interests directly affected by monetary legislation, but we cannot possibly measure the magnitude of the interests which the American people of every community, of every section, have in the wisdom or unwisdom of suggested changes. The number of stockholders and depositors in, and borrowers from our banking institutions is greater than that of the adult population of the country. The people who have the deepest direct interest in the efficiency and good management of our financial institutions are the active business men throughout the country, whose enterprise has earned for the United States the first place in the world of industry and commerce. The people who will suffer most from injurious changes will be the wage earners and the great mass of people engaged in productive industries. CHARACTER AND MAGNITUDE OF OUR BANKING SYSTEM The current report of the comptroller of the currency shows that we have in the United States approximately 29,000 state and national banks (about 22,000 state and 7,000 national), 1 An address at the dinner of the Academy of Political Science, October 15, 1913.

The rapid growth of our banking facilities in recent years is shown by increases from 1900 to 1912 in the number of institutions, from about 13,500 to 29,000; in banking resources from 10,785 million dollars to 24,986 millions; in loans and discounts from 5,657 millions to 13,953 millions; in individual deposits from 7,239 millions to 17,024 millions. The increase in population between 1900 and 1912 was twenty-two per cent, while the increase in banking resources was one hundred fifty-eight per cent. The wise management of these banks, for in the main the management has been wise, and the judicious use of these enormous banking resources have been perhaps the most important factors in promoting the growth and securing the unexampled prosperity of our agricultural, commercial, and industrial interests in recent years. Every community in the United States, large or small, has one or more banks. The managers of these banks are men familiar with the wants of their customers and they are usually accepted as the financial advisers of their neighbors. In all matters affecting the prosperity of the neighborhood in which they are located their advice and judgment are often sought and usually followed. The intimate and important relations existing between banks and bankers and the people and communities should be carefully considered in any examination of the provisions of suggested legislation. GENERAL CONDITIONS DEMAND REFORM The exceptional record of the successful growth of our banking interests to which I have referred has been coincident with the unexampled prosperity of the country. We must not, however, lose sight of the fact that our great banking resources have been found in serious emergencies powerless to avert general disaster. Our banking system has broken down when subjected to any very severe strain. While there is nothing in present or prospective business conditions that should occasion alarm, we must remember that financial troubles often, in fact usually, come unheralded. Even the causes that produce them can never be definitely stated. It is evident that in the (32) Digitized by Google No. i ] BANKING REFORM IN THE UNITED STATES 33 near future the adequacy of our banking facilities is to be tested by new demands for credit in addition to our normal business requirements. In magnitude, the unusual demands here and abroad for additional credit and for the placing of new loans by states and industrial organizations have never been equaled. Demands of this nature, world-wide in extent, impose new and greater burdens upon the banking resources of the world. With the close business and financial relations which modern conditions have established between the great commercial nations, each country must bear some share of these new responsibilities. The need of the states of the near East for means to fund indebtedness contracted during the late conflict and to enable them to repair the ravages of war adds largely to the usual European demand. In Europe, fear that grave political problems may not always be found capable of peaceful solution, and dread of the evil effects of an undue expansion of credit in any quarter, are disturbing elements. The high rates demanded for government and other loans, the impossibility of floating long-time loans at any rate, are evidences of unsettled and unsatisfactory conditions in the world's money market. In the United States our financial institutions will be called upon to meet insistent requirements of steam and electric railroads and industrial corporations for new loans to pay for necessary improvements and extensions, and to refund maturing obligations. Government and other large borrowers will be obliged to pay rates which a few years ago would have been considered extortionate. The effect of recent tariff legislation on business and government revenues is yet unknown. These conditions taken together naturally create a feeling of uncertainty in all financial centers. The enormous shrinkage, amounting to thousands of millions of dollars, which has recently taken place in the value of securities and property in the United States, furnishes evidence, whatever may be the cause, of a want of confidence in our continued prosperity on the scale of our past achievements. These among other considerations should lead us to exercise the greatest care in the selection of remedies for admitted (33) Digitized by Google 34 SECOND CURRENCY CONFERENCE [VOL. IV defects in our banking system. The people of this great country, with all the momentous consequences involved, cannot afford to venture on untried experiments, or to adopt principles or methods that have been rejected by the teachings of universal experience. We cannot measure the direful results which might follow revolutionary changes. Any remedial legislation should be constructive and not destructive. We should seek to strengthen rather than weaken the efficiency of our credit organization. We should supplement rather than supplant a system which has grown to such enormous proportions under state and national laws, and to which the business of the country has with more or less satisfactory results become adjusted. CHARACTER OF THE REFORM DEMANDED To secure a wise and comprehensive reform of our banking and monetary system, we require: 1. An efficient banking organization by which bank suspensions and financial crises with their evil results can be avoided. 2. Means to secure a concentration of cash reserves of the banks and their mobilization for use whenever and wherever needed in times of trouble. In times of stress, scattered reserves of banks have been found useless for either defense or protection. The scramble of 25,000 banks in 1907, each to take care of its own interests and to increase its own cash reserves, contributed very largely to the panicky conditions which led to general disaster. Banks must be furnished with effective means for replenishing their reserves and increasing their loaning power at times when the need for credit expansion is imperative. 3. The general cooperation of banks must be secured to protect their own or the public interests when these are menaced and when individual or local efforts are ineffectual to prevent the paralysis of business and domestic exchanges. 4. An organization must be provided that can deal effectively with conditions which imperil the credit and status of the United States as one of the great financial powers of the (34) Digitized by Google No. i ] BANKING REFORM IN THE UNITED STATES 35 world. In times of threatened trouble or actual panic, the power to control the movements of gold and the course of foreign exchange through raising the rates of discount or otherwise is essential, from both a national and an international standpoint. 5. We must have an organization whose influence can be made effective by an advance in discount rates or otherwise in preventing an undue expansion or dangerous inflation of bank credits. 6. A currency should be provided that, in character and volume, in contraction as well as in expansion, will be responsive to normal or unusual demands. Seasonal or unusual demands for currency or credit for crop moving or other purposes have at times produced very unsatisfactory conditions in the money market owing to the inelastic and unscientific character of our monetary system. 7. A broad discount market must be created with recognized and legalized standards of commercial paper. Recent conditions also impose unnecessary burdens upon business and production, and hinder the natural development of certain sections of the country. These evil results are felt more keenly in new and undeveloped communities. The lack of such a discount market leads banks in all sections to send surplus money to New York to be loaned there on stock exchange securities. The methods necessarily used in raising the enormous sums required for the production, movement and marketing of our agricultural and other products, are crude and unnecessarily expensive to producers. Notes and bills of exchange issued or drawn for agricultural, commercial, or industrial purposes, can be discounted only in a narrow, local market, and the result has been that our farmers and all others engaged in productive industries have been obliged to pay higher rates for their loans and have been placed at a great disadvantage in securing the credit which they have required and to which they are fairly entitled, for the growth, retention and distribution of their products. The adoption and use of proper standards for such commercial paper would enable our banks (35) Digitized by Google 36 SECOND CURRENCY CONFERENCE [VOL. IV profitably to replace in their portfolios speculative low-rate loans of all kinds with notes, bills of exchange and acceptances, based on the products and commodities of the country. If this change can be made, it will prevent the dangerous congestion which takes place at times in the great financial centres. It is difficult to understand, in this connection, why national banks, which are authorized by the House bill to accept drafts growing out of transactions involving importation or exportation of goods, are not permitted to accept domestic drafts of the same character. Why should a bank in Mississippi or Texas be permitted to accept the draft of a cotton planter on Liverpool, based on cotton shipments, when it could not accept the drafts of the same planter on a domestic consumer? Why should an importer in New York have better facilities than the western farmer who ships his grain to an eastern market? EFFECTIVE REMEDIES SUGGESTED BY EUROPEAN EXPERIENCE While there seems to be a general agreement as to the nature of the reforms demanded, unfortunately there is no such consensus of opinion as to the methods and machinery which should be employed in securing the desired results. This is to be regretted, as it seems certain from the experience of other nations that simple and effective remedies for defects are easily within our reach. While we have suffered greatly in almost every decade of our history from the evil effects of financial crises, the people of the great commercial countries of Europe have been entirely free for nearly half a century from disastrous losses arising from this cause. This exemption may be said to be due solely to the character and efficacy of their credit and banking organization. The experience of England and France, and later of Germany, in this respect, has led all the important commercial nations of the world except the United States to follow, in the essential features of their credit organization, in the footsteps of these great countries. The adoption within a few years by Sweden, Switzerland, and Japan of banking organizations along the lines of the countries I have referred to, completes the adher(36) Digitized by Google No. i] BANKING REFORM IN THE UNITED STATES 37 ence of the commercial world, outside of this country, to one general banking and monetary policy. CRITICISM OF THE BILL In considering the character of the remedies proposed by the bill which recently passed the House of Representatives I am not unmindful of the fact that it is much easier to criticize than to construct, and I certainly do not intend by any criticism I may make to increase the difficulties of legislators charged with serious responsibilities, but rather to call attention to changes which, it seems to me, must be made in the plan in the interest of wise and permanent legislation. The authors of the bill having in a majority of cases accepted remedies and adopted ideas based on experience of other countries, and on sound economic principles, it is all the more to be regretted that in some of the most important provisions of the bill the lessons of experience have been ignored. My suggestions with reference to certain provisions of the bill are made with the hope that they may prove of service to those who have the bill in charge, in their difficult task of perfecting the measure. It is certainly desirable that the American people, whose highest interests are to be affected favorably or unfavorably by congressional action, should have as clear an understanding as possible of the nature of the proposals. The two features of the bill which are open to the most serious objection are, first, the provisions which authorize the issue of government notes to be circulated as money and loaned on collateral security to the federal reserve banks created by the bill; second, the provisions which create a government board which can be accurately described as a government central bank of an objectionable type. NOTE ISSUES The proposals with reference to note issue are radical and revolutionary in their character and at variance with all the accepted canons of economic law. It can hardly be necessary for me to recount in this presence the disastrous results which have inevitably followed the (37) Digitized by Google 38 SECOND CURRENCY CONFERENCE [VOL. IV issue of paper money by governments or states. I need only remind you of our own colonial and revolutionary experiences. That of France at the time of John Law and the French Revolution is equally significant. In exceptional cases, like our own experience with United States notes, where continuous depreciation has not ended in absolute worthlessness of issues, the losses arising from the use of a depreciated currency have greatly exceeded any possible financial benefits which have resulted from the violation of economic laws. Competent authorities estimate the greater cost of our civil war, owing to the use of depreciated currency, at more than five hundred millions of dollars. In all cases of government issues, when the resulting expansion and inflation have brought about instability of conditions and values, those dependent upon wages and salaries and those engaged in agriculture and other production have been the principal sufferers, while the capitalists and speculators who could take advantage of constantly changing conditions have been the only classes who have been benefited. This condition has never been better characterized than by Daniel Webster, who said: Of all the contrivances for cheating the laboring classes of mankind, none is so effectual as that which deludes them with paper money. It is the most perfect expedient ever invented for fertilizing the rich man's fields by the sweat of the poor man's brow. Ordinary tyranny, oppression, excessive taxation, these bear lightly on the happiness of the community compared with fraudulent currencies and the robberies committed by depreciated paper. Our own history has recorded enough, and more than enough, of the demoralizing tendency, the injustice and intolerable oppression on the virtuous and well-disposed, of a degraded paper currency, authorized by law, or in any way countenanced by government.1 Pelatiah Webster, writing in 1781, after the total volume of Continental paper money had become worthless, said: We have suffered more from this than from any other cause or 1 Congressional Globe, 27th Cong., ad sess., app., p. 65. (38) Digitized by Google No. i ] BANKING REFORM IN THE UNITED STATES 39 calamity. It has killed more men, pervaded and corrupted the choicest interests of our country more, and done more injustice than even the arms and artifices of our enemies.1 Leading economists, financiers and statesmen of every shade of political belief have joined in the condemnation of the use of the obligations or notes of governments as a circulating medium. On this subject the views of Alexander Hamilton, who believed in a centralized national government, were fully concurred in by General Jackson and Mr. Benton and the leading statesmen who represented opposite views of government and of currency and banking questions. Mr. Hamilton said in his report of 1790: The emitting of paper money by the authority of government is wisely prohibited to the individual states by the national constitution, and the spirit of that prohibition ought not to be disregarded by the government of the United States. Though paper emissions, under a general authority, might have some advantages not applicable, and be free from some disadvantages which are applicable to the like emissions by the states, separately, yet they are of a nature so liable to abuse—and, it may even be affirmed, so certain of being abused— that the wisdom of the government will be shown, in never trusting itself with the use of so seducing and dangerous an experiment. I will quote the views of General Jackson and Mr. Benton later. Among American economists, the position and authority of Professor C. F. Dunbar will not be questioned. I know of no political economist of standing in this country who will not agree that the following statement of Professor Dunbar sets forth the sound economic doctrines that should control note issues: The necessary conclusion from our experience with the legal tender notes plainly is that a government currency, under our conditions, is an unfit subject for national legislation. * * * * * The often-repeated argument that a government issue, being a loan without interest, results in a saving to the treasury, which is 1 Horace White, Money and Banking, 4th ed., p. 9a. (39) Digitized by Google 40 SECOND CURRENCY CONFERENCE [VOL. IV lost when the right of circulation is delegated to banks is frequently resorted to. The experience of the United States presents a complete answer to this penny-wise reasoning. * * * The people of the United States have lost by shaken confidence, discouraged enterprise, and the actual ruin of thousands of citizens, resulting from the mismanagement of their currency, an amount beyond all comparison with the annual saving made by them at the treasury. * * * Errors made in the past will be also made by the new men in the future; and the possibility that, in any moment of popular discouragement or passing delusion, some fresh experiment or abandonment of wholesome limitation may be resolved upon in haste, but with irreparable results, must continue to be a standing menace to our credit, public and private. * * * Experience has shown that we can rely upon no principle or policy as a safeguard against the caprice or the temptation which at intervals must surely beset any legislative body having control of the direct issue of paper.1 Among British economists, Mr. H. D. MacLeod is perhaps the leading authority on banking and currency questions, and the view he expresses in the following quotation would be universally acquiesced in by foreign political economists. He says : Governments and states should never issue paper money themselves. When states and governments once begin to issue paper money, they can never resist the temptation to issue it in boundless quantities, so that it soon begins to depreciate. They have no power to redeem it, and the depreciation is incurable.2 Citations of a similar character could readily be made from the opinions of all leading authorities, from the public utterances of statesmen, from the views of the representatives of all parties and of all classes. Note issues in all commercial nations are made through banks of issue created by the government; all the conditions of issue, including those relating to character and amount, are 1 C. F. Dunbar, Economic Essays, pp. 219, 225-7. ' H. D. MacLeod, Theory of Credit, v. 2, pt. 2, p. 1105. (40) Digitized by Google No. i ] BANKING REFORM IN THE UNITED STATES 41 fixed by government. This method of note issue finds universal approval in all enlightened countries. In the thorough reexamination of banking and monetary questions which has recently taken place in Germany, Switzerland and elsewhere, no representative of any party and no individual appeared to favor the substitution of government notes for bank issues. It is true that in the period from 1814 to 1861, Congress authorized the issue of treasury notes in limited amounts, which were in every case issued as evidences of indebtedness on account of money borrowed to meet deficiencies in revenue or expenses growing out of wars. These treasury notes were receivable for public dues and were, with few exceptions, payable at a fixed time with interest, and were usually in denominations that precluded their use as currency. The power given Congress by the constitution to borrow money clearly involved the right of issue of securities of such character and in such form as Congress might determine, and the right of the government to issue obligations of this nature was not seriously questioned in any quarter. Our own experience prior to the adoption of the constitution led the framers of that instrument expressly to forbid the states from emitting bills of credit, and the doctrine that the issue of notes of the government of the United States for circulation as money was not authorized by the constitution, found wide acceptance. The opinion of Professor Woodrow Wilson was that generally held by statesmen of the period. In his history of the United States, he says: It (the constitution) absolutely forbade the state to issue bills of credit, did not give the federal government power to do so, and was meant practically to prohibit the use of any currency which was not at least based directly upon gold and silver.1 The first issues of United States notes with full legal-tender qualities and intended to circulate as money were made during the civil war and grew out of the urgent necessities of the gov1 Woodrow Wilson, History of the American People, v. 4, p. 46. (40 Digitized by Google 42 SECOND CURRENCY CONFERENCE [VOL. IV eminent at that time. The plea of necessity was the only justification urged for this radical departure from the policies and doctrines of the founders of the republic. Excessive issues of these notes and the repeal of the right to exchange the notes for interest-bearing obligations of the United States produced the usual result of depreciation and discredit. The reasons for the general condemnation of government note issues are not difficult to understand. No government has yet been found strong enough to resist the pressure for enlarged issues in times of real or imaginary stress, or to meet some real or fancied exigency in its own affairs or a popular demand for more money. Issues have been at first limited in amount and surrounded by proper safeguards as to exchangeability and convertibility, and by what seemed to be ample provisions for ultimate safety, but experience has shown that in every case in response to a popular demand these safeguards have been one after another ignored or removed, restrictions as to amounts of issue have been modified or repealed, and the exhilaration which has followed the initial issues has led to an irresistible demand for continuous inflation, and this has been followed by progressive depreciation, a necessary destruction of value, and general bankruptcy. Some of the friends of the House bill who do not like to be classed as advocates of the further issue of government notes assert that the notes to be issued are after all notes of the reserve banks and that the United States occupies the same relation to them that it does to national bank notes. The differences are, of course, perfectly obvious and fundamental. The notes to be issued by the House bill are by its express terms \" obligations of the United States \" issued for the purpose of \" making advances to federal reserve banks,\" the banks to furnish \" collateral \" and to pay \" interest \" on the loans. National bank notes are in terms and in fact obligations of the national banks. The treasury under the banking law redeems national bank notes for the national banks and takes as security for any failure of the banks to respond in payment of advances United States bonds equal in amount to the total amount of bank-note issues with right to sell at (42) Digitized by Google No. i] BANKING REFORM IN THE UNITED STATES 43 any time at public or private sale without notice. In the one case we have obligations of the United States issued by a government agent and loaned to reserve banks. In the other case we have obligations of the national banks with a pledge of Government bonds to secure their final redemption by the banks. EXPERIENCE OF FRANCE In this connection the experience of France in 1790 and the years following with the issue of assignats furnishes valuable lessons. France had confiscated the real property of the French church, which consisted of valuable estates in town and country forming about one-third of the real property of France and having a value of about 4,000 millions of francs and yielding a yearly income of about 200 millions. The first issue of notes made in 1790 was limited to 400 millions of francs, and was based upon a specific pledge of this vast property. The holders of the notes had a right to exchange them for the property pledged at perfectly satisfactory prices. The arguments that were used in support of this issue have a familiar sound. It was contended: Paper money under a despotism is dangerous; it favors corruption; but in a nation constitutionally governed, which itself takes care of the emission of its notes, which determines their number and use, that danger no longer exists.1 It was claimed that paper so limited and so secured was as good as gold and that, as it could not be issued in excess, there was no possibility of depreciation. Great stress was placed upon the fact that entirely different conditions existed in Law's time, and that with a free government and new conditions only beneficial results could follow; that prosperity and abundance were assured. A scientific, practical guarantee of goodness was asserted and in an address issued by the French Assembly it was said that the paper had no \" value derived from the national authority, but a value real and immutable; a value which permits it to sustain advantageously a competi1 A. D. White, Fiat Money in France, p. 4. (43) Digitized by Google SECOND CURRENCY 44 CONFERENCE [VOL. IV tion with the precious metals themselves.\" In the later discussions it was asserted that the precious metals would soon be used only in the arts, and a currency of paper, secured upon the first and most real of all property, would take its place. A demand was made later for an issue sufficient in amount to pay the government debt. No paper currency ever had what seemed to be a more practical guarantee for its security and value. It was based upon what was then and is now the highest form of security, a mortgage on productive real estate of unquestioned value. The notes bore interest at "
