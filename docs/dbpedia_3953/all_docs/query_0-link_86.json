There are many acceptable definitions of political culture. A simple and useful one is the recognizable “beliefs and expectations that give meaning to the political process and guide … the conduct of politics and government” (Richard L. McCormick, The Party Period and Public Policy: American Politics from the Age of Jackson to the Progressive Era [Oxford, 1986], 116). For another, see Jean H. Baker, Affairs of Party: The Political Culture of Northern Democrats in the Mid-Nineteenth Century (Ithaca, N.Y., 1983), 11–12.\n\n3. Bernard Bailyn, The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution (Cambridge, Mass., 1967, and enlarged 25th anniversary ed., 1992); Gordon S. Wood, The Creation of the American Republic, 1776–1787 (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1969); id., The Radicalism of the American Revolution: How a Revolution Transformed a Monarchical Society into a Democratic One Unlike Any That Had Ever Existed (New York, 1991); J. G. A. Pocock, The Machiavellian Moment: Florentine Political Thought and the Atlantic Republican Tradition (Princeton, 1975); id., Virtue, Commerce, and History (Cambridge, 1985); Lance Banning, The Jeffersonian Persuasion: Evolution of a Party Ideology (Ithaca, N.Y., 1978). For a general treatment of the republican-centered literature, see Robert E. Shalhope, “Toward a Republican Synthesis: The Emergence of an Understanding of Republicanism in American Historiography,” William and Mary Quarterly, 3d ser., 29 (1972): 49–80 (hereinafter cited as WMQ); id., “Republicanism and Early American Historiography,” ibid. 39 (1982): 334–356.\n\n4. Recent writings have begun to draw attention to the differences among the republican historians. Daniel T. Rodgers, for example, distinguishes between a Harvard and St. Louis tradition (“Republicanism: The Career of a Concept,” Journal of American History 79 [1992]: 11–38 [hereinafter cited as JAH]). Bernard Bailyn has pointed out that he never described “the spokesmen of the Revolution” as “civic humanists” (Ideological Origins, vi). And Jack P. Greene argues that there is a marked distinction between Gordon Wood’s notion of “public virtue” and J. G. A. Pocock’s concept of “civic virtue” (Imperatives, Behaviors, and Identities: Essays in Early American Cultural History [Charlottesville, Va., 1992], 208–214, 233–234). These various distinctions notwithstanding (and in the last case, contextualized reading of both of Wood’s books (see esp. Radicalism of the American Revolution, 104–109) suggests that Greene has overemphasized the authorial conceptual gulf between Pocock’s civic-minded citizens and Wood’s virtuous Revolutionary leaders), the chief republican historians remain very close cousins.\n\n5. Joyce Appleby, Capitalism and a New Social Order: The Republican Vision of the 1790s (New York, 1984); id., Liberalism and Republicanism in the Historical Imagination (Cambridge, Mass., 1992); John P. Diggins, The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-Interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism (New York, 1985); Stephen Watts, The Republic Reborn: War and the Making of Liberal America, 1790–1820 (Baltimore, 1987); Isaac Kramnick, Republican and Bourgeois Radicalism: Political Ideology in Late Eighteenth-Century England and America (Ithaca, N.Y., 1990).\n\n6. For some reactions to liberal criticism, see Wood, Radicalism of the American Revolution; Lance Banning, “Jeffersonian Ideology Revisited: Liberal and Classical Ideas in the New American Republic,” WMQ 3d ser., 43 (1986), 3–19; id., “The Republican Interpretation: Retrospect and Prospect,” and Robert E. Shalhope, “Republicanism, Liberalism, and Democracy: Political Culture in the Early Republic,” in The Republican Synthesis Revisited: Essays in Honor of George Athan Billias, Milton M. Klein, Richard D. Brown, and John B. Hench, eds. (Worcester, Mass., 1992), 91–117, 37–90. Liberalism has often been perceived as a secondary force in public thought during the colonial years (1) because of the difficulty of demonstrating liberal values (see, e.g., the response of James A. Henretta in his “Reply,” WMQ, 3d ser., 38 [1980]: 697, to James T. Lemon, The Best Poor Man’s Country: A Geographical Study of Early Southeastern Pennsylvania [Baltimore, 1972], and that of Michael Zuckerman, “Review Essay: Farewell to the ‘New England Paradigm’ of Colonial Development,” Pennsylvania History 57 [1990]: 66–73 [hereinafter cited as Pa. Hist.] to Jack P. Greene’s Pursuits of Happiness: The Social Development of Early Modern British Colonies and the Formation of American Culture [Chapel Hill, N.C., 1988]); (2) because of the tendency to forgo discussions about acquisitiveness in favor of those focusing on colonial economic growth and a transition to capitalism (see, e.g., John J. McCusker and Russell R. Menard, The Economy of British North America, 1607–1789 [Chapel Hill, N.C., 1985], and Allan Kulikoff, The Agrarian Origins of American Capitalism [Charlottesville, Va., 1992]); (3) because of the recent discovery of various “traditional” characteristics in colonial societies (see, e.g., Appleby, Capitalism and a New Social Order, 7–14, Wood, Radicalism of the American Revolution, 11–92, and Kulikoff, Agrarian Origins of American Capitalism, 13–33); (4) because of the intellectual attractiveness of classical republicanism as “a predecessor and counterpoint to emergent liberalism” (see Peter Onuf, review of Liberalism and Republicanism in the Historical Imagination, by Joyce Appleby, WMQ 3d ser., 50 [1993]: 791); and (5) because of the appearance of a prominent literature of liberalism beginning in 1776 (as symbolized by Adam Smith’s An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations [Dublin, 1776]). John Brooke’s The Heart of the Commonwealth: Society and Political Culture in Worcester County, Massachusetts, 1713–1861 (Cambridge, 1989) is illustrative of this tendency. In describing cultural change in Massachusetts society from the first days of European settlement to the Civil War in terms of an evolving, tension-filled equilibrium between classical republicanism and liberalism, Brooke stresses that classical republican modes of thought and behavior predominated over their liberal counterparts throughout the colonial period.\n\n7. The major statement asserting the ubiquity of the English “radical Whig” or “country” underpinnings of Revolutionary republican thought is Bernard Bailyn’s The Origins of American Politics (New York, 1968). As Bailyn explains, “It was primarily this opposition frame of mind through which the colonists saw the world and in terms of which they themselves became participants in politics.” The rush to embrace republicanism during the 1970s and 1980s produced some modification of Bailyn’s thesis, most notably in some acceptance of the argument that “court” as well as “country” thinking played a significant role in the North American colonies. (See, e.g., William Pencak, War, Politics, and Revolution in Provincial Massachusetts [Boston, 1981].) But by encouraging such historians as John M. Murrin to place the various colonies along a court/country continuum, such recent scholarship has simply recast Bailyn’s original argument in slightly different form—for country ideas only make sense in the context of the court/country dichotomy. See John M. Murrin, “Political Development,” in Colonial British America: Essays in the New History of the Early Modern Era, Jack P. Greene and J. R. Pole, eds. (Baltimore, 1984), 440. For Murrin’s broader application of the court/country model to American politics, see “The Great Inversion, or Court versus Country: A Comparison of the Revolution Settlements in England (1688–1721) and America (1766–1816),” in Three British Revolutions: 1641, 1688, 1776, J. G. A. Pocock, ed. (Princeton, 1980), 368–453. Joyce Appleby lays out what she considers to be the English antecedents of American liberal thought in her Economic Thought and Ideology in Seventeenth-Century England (Princeton, 1978) and in several essays in Liberalism and Republicanism.\n\n8. Focusing on the colonial assemblies (which he had earlier placed at the center of his own explanation of the Revolution in The Quest For Power: The Lower Houses of Assembly in the Southern Royal Colonies, 1689–1776 [Chapel Hill, N.C., 1963]), Jack P. Greene has voiced the strongest objections to Bailyn’s view in “Political Mimesis: A Consideration of the Historical and Cultural Roots of Legislative Behavior in the British Colonies in the Eighteenth Century,” American Historical Review 75 (1969): 337–360 (hereinafter cited as AHR), an important article offering Greene’s own single-strand interpretation of colonial politics and questioning Bailyn’s tendency to push republican concerns back so far into the colonial period. The dominant political discourse in the eighteenth-century colonies, Greene argues, was that of “the seventeenth-century tradition of opposition to the Crown.” Rather than having country concerns uppermost in their minds, he asserts, politically aware colonists were animated by “fear” of the royal prerogative and by a “jealous concern” for the “privileges and authority” of their assemblies (“Political Mimesis,” 341, 343). In general, historians have perceived Bailyn’s model of colonial politics as capacious enough (because it does include conflict between assemblies and governors) to encompass much of what Greene distinguishes as a separate paradigm. In his King and People in Provincial Massachusetts (Chapel Hill, 1985), Richard Bushman offers a noteworthy alternative in arguing that in the monarchically oriented provincial culture of Massachusetts, the language of seventeenth-century English opposition predominated in popular politics prior to the 1740s, and the republican-informed English country tradition thereafter. For a recent example of a Revolution-determined, reductionist view of colonial politics, see Marc Egnal, A Mighty Empire: The Origins of the American Revolution (Ithaca, N.Y., 1988).\n\n9. Exceptions to this seem to occur when historians choose to construct a model of western European “traditionalism” out of the colonial experience in order to magnify the extent of the “transformation” that American society underwent during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. But this is simply another example of subordinating the colonial past to a Revolutionary or Early National agenda. One recent and glaring example of this is Wood, Radicalism of the American Revolution. For a similar tendency from a different ideological perspective, see Edward Countryman, A People in Revolution: The American Revolution and Political Society in New York, 1760–1790 (Baltimore, 1981).\n\n10. On the paucity of recent interest in colonial “political development” see Greene, Imperatives, Behaviors, and Identities, 214–215.\n\n11. Greene, Pursuits of Happiness. Although Greene’s argument is that, aside from New England, all the British North American colonial regions were structurally similar, and that there was an accelerating convergence among all the major colonies of the first British empire during the middle two quarters of the eighteenth century, much of his evidence indicates immense diversity among the British colonies.

Some critics, however, including a number of Quakers, saw the founding of Pennsylvania as an abandonment of that war, for the major strategy English Friends had adopted in order to overcome their persecutors was to confront them with Quaker suffering. Immigration could be construed as avoidance of the suffering necessary to win the war in Britain. On the prosecution of Quakers in England and their resistance, see Craig W.

They rejected ordination and clerical ceremonies, and the notion of a paid, or “hireling,” clergy, and believed that no formal education was required for an individual to become a spiritual leader. Quaker “public Friends”—both men and women—gradually gained a reputation as spokespersons on behalf of the “Inner Light” in their local meetings. Established public Friends kept an eye open for those with such talent and recruited them into ministerial meetings and the powerful monthly, quarterly, and yearly meetings. As they followed their “concern” to attend regional, North American, and overseas meetings to testify to “God’s Truth,” their reputation usually grew proportionately.\n\n147.

Most open criticism of the settlement centered on the Public Debt Acts. There were those who saw in that legislation the old pattern of corruption extended to the assembly and beyond. Governor, councilmen, assemblymen, and many freemen had their noses in the public trough. (Mulford, Speech; Governor Hunter to Lords of Trade, 2 Oct. 1716, DRCNY, 5:480.) A small group of very prominent anti-Leislerian merchants objected to the second Debt Act, fearful that the paper money the act authorized would erode their prominent economic position. Their political allies were the last holdouts against anything more than an annual revenue act. Hunter to Secretary Popple, 3 Dec. 1717, DRCNY, 5:494–495.\n\n71. Peter R.

In requesting the legislature to annul the three patents against which the Iroquois had long protested, Hardy was following the orders of the Board of Trade (Lords of Trade to Governor Hardy, 19 Mar. 1756, DRCNY, 7:77). DeLancey played a double game on the issue of the patents. In 1754, he was prepared to push for the annulment of the Kayaderosseros Patent because that would be a blow against a number of his Livingston critics and because it was a way of building bridges between himself and Sir William Johnson. But there is no question that once the issue became broader and other patents came into question, DeLancey sided with “the wealthiest, and most leading men in this Province,” as Sir William Johnson described those in the forefront of opposition against a more general vacating act.

Early Pennsylvania Quakers had always harbored ambivalent attitudes toward the Crown. On the one hand, while in England, they had often looked to the Crown for protection from persecution; on the other, they maintained that “the King has nothing more to do here [in Pennsylvania] than to receive a bear skin or two yearly” (Robert Suder to the governor, 20 Nov. 1698, Historical Collections Relating to the American Colonial Church, William S. Perry, ed., 5 vols. [Hartford, Conn., 1971] 2:11). The political power their progeny came to wield in Pennsylvania and their preoccupation with an intransigent Thomas Penn gradually dimmed their collective memory of the arbitrary ways of English royalty and distracted them from recent unsettling experiences neighboring royal colonies had suffered at the hands of the British.\n\n226.

Acting as corporate bodies (no matter how informally constituted), local communities would occasionally plead the issue of rights as a grievance before the assembly. For example, when some residents of southeastern Long Island advanced their right to take their produce to New York City in their own boats rather than on the city ferry, they petitioned the assembly as the freeholders of Brookland. When the hearing took place, the trustees of Brookland attended the presentation of the aggrieved party’s case. The rights of the Brookland freeholders were town rights as well as individual rights.

For New York City, see Howe, “Accommodation and Retreat.”\n\n3. Roeber, “‘The Origin of Whatever Is Not English,’” 226–234. See Adrian Howe, “Accommodation and Retreat,” 192–370, for an extended argument that after the early 1700s the Dutch backed away from any political activism that might encourage Dutch/English political confrontations, and the suggestion that the Morris/Alexander appeals to some elements of the Dutch vote in the 1730s were cloaked in the rhetoric of class conflict. There are one or two allusions in the context of the political competition of the 1730s to a Morris/Alexander attempt to mobilize the “Dutch mob,” and it is certainly possible that a major portion of the disproportionately large lower-class Dutch population enlisted in the campaign against Governor Cosby’s friends (New-York Weekly Journal, 15 Mar. 1736, 6 Oct. 1735; Howe, “Accommodation and Retreat,” 320–353). However, the Morris/Alexander political appeal to the working poor, coupled with the prominence of Dutch leaders like Rip Van Dam and Cornelius Van Horne in their ranks, was enough to explain that. In retrospect, the single most significant characteristic of Dutch political behavior during the Cosby/Morris political wars was the relative balance between the two sides. The New Yorkers who backed Lewis Morris, Sr., during the Van Dam case consisted of roughly equal proportions of Dutch and British, along with a small French minority.
