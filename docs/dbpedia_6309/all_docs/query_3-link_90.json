        "text": "Myra here.\n\nIt’s Monday, What are You Reading is a meme hosted by Jen from Teach Mentor Texts and Kellee and Ricki from Unleashing Readers (brainchild of Sheila at BookJourney). Since two of our friends, Linda from Teacher Dance and Tara from A Teaching Life have been joining this meme for quite awhile now, we thought of joining this warm and inviting community.\n\nLast Week’s Review and Miscellany Posts\n\nWe’re also inviting everyone to join our Award Winning Books Reading Challenge for 2015 (#AWBRead2015)! It’s that time of the year to set new reading goals for the coming year.\n\nCongratulations to Libby Vine on being the March-April AWB Winner for her review of Snowflake Bentley. Please send your contact details to gatheringbooks (at) yahoo (dot) com to receive your copy of A Song for Ella Grey by David Almond courtesy of Pansing Books.\n\nHere is the sign up page and the May-June linky if you already have reviews up. One randomly-selected participant would receive a copy of Lone Wolf, courtesy of Pansing books.\n\nClick here to view my announcement post to learn more details.\n\nWe have just launched our new reading theme: Walking the Literary Silk Road – China and the Middle East. Special thanks again to Iphigene for creating this gorgeous poster. She described her creative process for this poster in this fashion:\n\n“The peacock feather has to do with both of the regions’ mythology. The Middle East/Persians call it Simurgh and the Chinese call it Fenghuang. Both creatures are similar to the Phoenix in its bird-like quality and the ‘peacock’ tail. The upper part shows a traditional Islamic tile pattern, while the lower half also shows a traditional Chinese pattern.”\n\nHere are two picturebooks that I thought captured the Chinese and the Middle Eastern experience.\n\nThe Camel In The Sun\n\nWritten by: Griffin Ondaatje Illustrated by: Linda Wolfsgruber\n\nPublished by: Groundwood Books: House of Anansi Press, 2013\n\nBorrowed from the Jurong West Public Library. Book photos taken by me.\n\nI have been seeing this book make the rounds for quite awhile now, and have been very intrigued by it. Now that we have a China/Middle East reading theme, I deliberately searched for it and found a copy in our public library.\n\nSet “in the lands East of the Red Sea” this story takes us into a journey of compassion, quiet understanding, and what it means to be tired and alone in the world. The Author’s Note also provides a fairly-detailed account of what inspired the writing of this story (while the author was visiting a family in Sri Lanka) and how this retelling of a hadith (“an account of the Prophet’s words or actions passed from generation to generation”) came into being.\n\nWhile the ending of the story felt abrupt for me, it was also a realistic portrayal of life and its many circuitous paths. It also allows space for the reader to draw her own conclusions and imagine how the rest of the camel’s days would be like. A beautiful story that would definitely leave footprints in any reader’s heart.\n\nRed Kite, Blue Kite\n\nWritten by: Ji-Li Jiang Illustrated by: Greg Ruth\n\nPublished by: Hyperion Books, 2013\n\nBorrowed from the Jurong West Public Library. Book photos taken by me.\n\nThe setting of this book is during the Chinese Cultural Revolution – a period of unrest and uncertainty. Throughout the story, one is able to have a first-hand feel of this kind of internal turmoil and anxiety from a child’s eyes and through a young child’s voice.\n\nTai Shan and his father Baba love to fly kites – they love the feeling of being above but under, neither here nor there, flying free in the skies:\n\nMy red kite is small and nimble. Baba’s blue kite is big and strong. Mine follows his, forward and backward, up and down. The kites hop and giggle as they rise and dive, soaring and lunging together. Baba loves telling stories while our kites fly. I laugh and cheer and feel like it’s me up in the clouds, looking down at the dotted houses.\n\nThings changed when “a bad time” came to their town with people wearing red armbands, smashing signs and tearing into people’s homes. I found the image above particularly striking with the largely monochrome art dotted with streaming bright red and blazing armbands providing a stark contrast to the young boy’s earth tones and bewildered posture.\n\nTai Shan had to stay with a farmer named Granny Wang in a small village quite close to where Baba’s labor camp was.\n\nTai Shan and his Baba was able to communicate to each other through their kites flying in the skies – despite the fact that they are apart from each other. When Baba’s blue kite could not be found in the skies any longer, Tai Shan knew that his father was in grave danger. How the story ended, I shall leave for you to discover.\n\nThis book has managed to stir something in me as it provides a snapshot of a father’s love, a young boy’s resilience, and how a child’s innocent eyes remain untainted by a war that he does not recognize as his. The only thing that he knows is that it took his father away from him. Truly a remarkable read.\n\nCurrently Reading…\n\nI was able to finish reading Under the Mesquite by Guadalupe Garcia McCall, a beautiful and heart-wrenching novel-in-verse. I also read two poetry collections (it’s been a poetry kind of week):\n\nThe Flag of Childhood: Poems from the Middle East selected by Naomi Shihab Nye, and Poisoned Apples: Poems for You, My Pretty by Christine Heppermann.\n\nThese are the two books that I am now reading for my two book clubs: Tim Winton’s Eyrie for GatheringReaders at NIE, and The Perks of Being A Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky for my Saturday-Night-Out with Book-Geeks.\n\nThe Camel In The Sun: Selected for the Middle East Book Award 2014; Selected for the Leserstimmen Prize 2015; Selected for the Austria Children’s Book Prize 2015\n\nRed Kite, Blue Kite: 2013 Notable Social Studies Trade Books for Young People; 2013 Junior Library Guild Selection; 2013-2014 Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature in the Picture Book"
