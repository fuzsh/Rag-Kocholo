        "text": "We’ve got a kite for sore eyes, because the ABC Kite Fest is returning to Zilker Park for its 96th year.\n\nBringing tens of thousands of residents together (as many as 50,000 in 2023) for a wholesome afternoon of free fun, ABC Kite Fest is slated for 10 a.m.-5 p.m. on Sunday, April 14.\n\nA little history on the fest\n\nA time-honored tradition for Austinites young and old, the kite extravaganza was created by The Exchange Club of Austin in 1929.\n\nOriginally held at the former Lamar Park, the inaugural event was a competition where the Exchange Club would give out medals for largest box kite, steadiest tailless kite, most artistic kite, smallest kite, and more.\n\nThe competition moved to Zilker Park in 1936 and was henceforth known as the Zilker Park Kite Tournament until ABC Home and Commercial Services began supporting the event in 2010.\n\nThe festival has been open to competitors of all ages — including homemade and manufactured kites — since 1956. Contest categories in present times include highest angle kite, best kite pilot, steadiest kite, most unusual kite, oldest + youngest pilots, and more.\n\nLet the fun begin\n\nAside from thousands of kites to gaze upon, here are a few more things you can expect.\n\nThe High Flyer Club | For $100, the VIP experience includes early entry into the festival, access to reserved parking, specialty food options, and an air-conditioned restroom.\n\nMossFest | Children can enjoy concerts from the Barton Hills Choir, Justin Roberts, DiscoTex, and Mr. Will from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.\n\nThe Kids Club | This club will feature bounce houses and activities for little ones.\n\nThe Pet Zone | Grab your pup for an off-leash pet playground pop-up, plus rock climbing walls for the humans."
