        "text": "Ji-Li Jiang, Author\n\nGreg Ruth, Illustrator\n\nDisney Hyperion Books, fiction, 2013\n\nSuitable for Ages: 5-8\n\nThemes: Father/son relationship, Kites, Separation, Hope, Chinese Cultural Revolution, Multicultural\n\nOpening: “I love to fly kites. But not from the ground. My city is crowded, and the streets are skinny. Baba and I fly our kites from the tippy-top of our triangle roof. We are above but still under, neither here nor there. We are free, like the kites.”\n\nSynopsis: When Tai Shan and his father, Baba, are separated during China’s Cultural Revolution, Tai Shan goes to live with Granny Wang. Baba is able to visit Tai Shan every Sunday, but they stay close by greeting each other every day with flying kites. It is their secret way of communicating their love for one another and ease the separation. One day Tai Shan isn’t able to see Baba’s kite in the sky and worries if he will ever see his father again.\n\nWhy I like this book: Ji-Li Jiang has written a beautiful poetic story about a father/son relationship that endures under the most difficult time in China’s history. Greg Ruth’s double-page spreads are done in ink and watercolors. They are large, evocative and a feast for the eyes. It is a compelling story that teaches children about the Chinese culture and a little history at the same time."
