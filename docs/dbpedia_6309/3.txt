Red Kite, Blue Kite by Ji-li Jiang, illustrated by Greg Ruth

Based on the true story of a family friend, this book tells the story of a father and son separated during the Cultural Revolution in China. Tai Shan and his father, Baba, loved to fly kites together from the roof of their home in their crowded city. Then bad times come and the schools are closed. Baba is sent to a labor camp and Tai Shan is sent to life in a small village with Granny Wang. Both Tai Shan and his father continue to fly their kites, using them as a signal to one another and a way to maintain contact. Eventually, Baba is taken further away to another labor camp where they cannot communicate with kites. All that can be done is to wait until Baba is free again and their kites can soar together once more.

This picture book will be best understood by older children. There is no need to have a background in Chinese history to understand this book because the story is so universal. The use of kites as imagery of freedom and connection works particularly well, especially in the ending which is particularly uplifting after the tension and sorrow of the rest of the tale. Jiang writes in prose that is filled with the emotion of the time. He writes with deep compassion and doesn’t shy away from the pain that fills Tai Shan’s days separated from his father.

Ruth’s illustrations capture the mood of the story very effectively. He moves from bright golds and oranges in the city to the dull colors of khaki and earth when the two are separated. The color scheme is only alleviated by the pop of color from their kites. When the two are together again, the color begins to return to the landscape.

This is a striking and universal look at families that are torn apart by war and the haunted time they spend apart. Appropriate for ages 6-9.
