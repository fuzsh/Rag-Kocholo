Eighty years ago on Tuesday, Orson Welles revealed the terrifying power of fake news.

On Oct. 30, 1938, Welles directed a radio adaptation of “The War of the Worlds,” reimagining its Martian invasion through fictitious news flashes. Many contemporary newspapers claimed the show sparked a mass panic, sending multitudes of listeners fleeing their homes in fear.

But that stubbornly persistent narrative is false. The myth of the “War of the Worlds” panic not only misinterprets how media persuasion and fake news actually work — it prevents us from understanding how to grapple with the problem today.

Over the past decade, a scholarly consensus has formed that the press grossly exaggerated the effects of Welles’s broadcast. Only a small fraction of radio listeners mistook it for real news, and precious few did anything that could be described as “panicking.” The better question, then, is why “The War of the Worlds” frightened some people but not others.

In 1938, the answer seemed clear. Many scholars believed radio could, like a hypodermic needle, inject ideas straight into people’s minds, convincing them of anything — even something as fantastical as an alien attack.

But further investigation refuted this simplistic picture. A Princeton University survey of frightened listeners indicated only about a third understood the invaders to be Martians. The rest imagined something more plausible that they already feared, such as a Nazi blitzkrieg.

The broadcast, in short, didn’t bypass the conscious intellect to convince people of something they wouldn’t otherwise believe. It passed through pre-existing fears, attitudes and beliefs, to be corroborated or refuted within the mind of each listener.
