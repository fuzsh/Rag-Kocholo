The sixth, Joey, was off to California to make it in acting; the real-life spinoff “Joey” didn’t last.\n\nThe end of the show’s 10-year run also meant the band the Rembrandts — co-founded by Minnesotan Danny Solem — could stop opening every concert with the poppy theme song that made them famous. Written by the show’s producers, it was a catchy tune, but one that didn’t quite fit into the repertoire of the band behind such tuneful numbers as “Just the Way It Is, Baby.”\n\nActor George Clooney — “Gravity,” “Ocean’s Eleven,” “The Descendants,” “Hail, Caesar!” and “ER” — is 56.\n\nActress Emily Alyn Lind — “Secret Life of Bees,” “Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia” — is 15.\n\nEnglish actress Naomi Scott of Foxs sci-fi drama “Terra Nova” and “Power Rangers” is 24.\n\nMusician Nanna Bryndis Hilmarsdottir of the Icelandic indie band Of Monsters and Men is 28.\n\nComedian Sasheer Zamata of “Saturday Night Live” is 31.\n\nActress Gabourey Sidibe — of “Empire,” and her breakout role “Precious” — is 34. You also might have caught her in “American Horror Story.”\n\nActress Adrianne Palicki — “Friday Night Lights,” “About a Boy,” “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” — is 34.\n\nActress and dancer Edyta Sliwinska of “Dancing with the Stars” is 36.\n\nGuitarist Chris Shiflett of Foo Fighters is 46.\n\nFrench singer and guitarist Laetitia Sadier of the rock group Stereolab is 49.\n\nActress Roma Downey of “Touched by an Angel” is 57.\n\nSinger John Flansburgh of the band They Might be Giants is getting “Older,” which is your earworm for the day. Flansburgh is 57.\n\nHost Tom Bergeron  “Dancing With the Stars,” “Hollywood Squares”  is 62.\n\nActress Lynn Whitfield — “The Josephine Baker Story” (she had the title role) and “The Cheetah Girls” — is 64.\n\nSinger and St. Paul native Mary Macgregor is 69. The University of Minnesota grad had the 1976 No. 1 easy-listening hit “Torn Between Two Lovers.” The song, which she says she hated, ruined her career writing jingles, she said. These days she writes songs on her California horse ranch, according to SuperSeventies.com.\n\nActor Alan Dale — “Lost,” “The O.C.” — is 70.\n\nTurn another page. Singer Bob Seger is 72.\n\nSinger Jimmie Dale Gilmore is 72.\n\nBaseball Hall of Famer Willie Mays is 86. The Say Hey Kid won 12 Gold Glove awards, hit 660 career home runs for the New York and San Francisco Giants and the New York Mets and was National League MVP twice.\n\nScreenwriter, director and actor Orson Welles — “Citizen Kane,” “War of the Worlds” — was born on this day in 1915. He died in 1985, after repeating many times, “We will sell no wine before its time.” Photo is from 1941.\n\nAustrian psychiatrist Sigmund Freud was born Sigismund Schlomo Freud on this day in 1856. He died in 1939. He’s shown leaving Victoria Station after his arrival in London June 6, 1938.\n\nOriginally Published: May 6, 2016 at 5:00 a.m."
