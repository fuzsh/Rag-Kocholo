Wunderkind Orson Welles made a splash with his The War of the Worlds 1938 radio program that shocked America, as well as with his masterpiece film, Citizen Kane (1941). He spent the rest of his career chasing the high experienced from those two productions, overspending and overfilming, and often without funds. Still, he is without parallel in the annals of film and is responsible for such classics as The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), Jane Eyre (1943), and Touch of Evil (1958), among many others. Largest pressbook: 12 x 18 in.",
