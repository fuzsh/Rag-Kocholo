        "text": "Is that a real paranormal activity in your trousers or are you just happy to mess with my head?\n\nLove âem or hate âem, the twisted roots of cinemaâs found footage genre were already snaking their way into popular culture a long time before you were born, according to Sarah Appleton and Phillip Escottâs granular and engrossing doc, The Found Footage Phenomenon.\n\nAs noted by Steven Degennaro, Austin-based director of 2016âs Found Footage 3D, there's an argument that found footage stems from other art forms, from epistolary novel such as Bram Stokerâs Dracula, its diary entries and letters \"written in a sort of found journal-esque style.â Even listening to the radio could cause a âfound soundâ panic, as Orson Wellesâ 1938 prank gone haywire War of the Worlds proved.\n\nOf course, the limbic lynchpin for the horror show version of the found footage genre remains 1999âs The Blair Witch Project, with Heather Donahueâs runny nose and the filmâs stark, shaky-cam Hi8 video footage turning co-directorâs Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrickâs micro-budgeted filmic con into one of the most profitable indie movies ever made netting close to $250 million in worldwide sales. And yes, the rumors of viewers actually becoming physically ill and losing their popcorn-and-cola lunches during screenings are true.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of The Found Footage Phenomenon is just how many filmmakers are on board and eager to discuss and dissect not only their own forays into the frightening found, but those of other filmmakers as well. Alexandra Heller-Nicholas, author of Found Footage Horror Films, breaks down whatâs probably the most notorious film in the genre, Ruggero Deodatoâs 1980 magnum vomitus Cannibal Holocaust, while Deodato himself recalls how he was charged with murder in his native Italy due to the gruesomely effective, literally visceral fake-viscera pouring out of the actors on the screen. Two decades before that, Michael Powellâs seminal, Hitchcockian Peeping Tom used the psychotic killerâs view through the viewfinder of his killer camera, and while The Found Footage Phenomenon excels at underlining the history of the genre, things get really intriguing when everyone from Fantastic Fest favorite Andre Ovredal (Trollhunter) gnaw on the form's post-Paranormal Activity resurrection following Blair Witchâs release nearly a decade before.\n\nAll agree that the introduction of prosumer video and editing equipment had a major impact via the previously impassable budgetary line items necessary for shooting on film. More interesting though is the effect that the then-new(-ish) tech of the internet and the web had on the cultural zeitgeist. The birth and seemingly overnight global dominance of YouTube, several filmmakers, including Rob Savage of last yearâs pandemic-isolated Zoom-doomer Host point out, was a massive game changer. All-too-real snuff films were being uploaded by both Taliban fighters and U.S. Army grunts (a clear influence on Brian DePalmaâs stridently anti-war film Redacted). David Ayerâs faux-footage bad cop/bad cop End of Watch rattled nerves with nary an exorcist in sight. Found footage films had found their own specific ideologies and pop cultural messages, be they the dangers of unsupervised social media, as in Michael Goiâs Megan is Missing, or the rise of neo-Nazi nationalism and the corresponding tides of white power anti-Semitism found in James Cullen Bressack and screenwriter Jarret Cohenâs fiercely out-of-bounds home invasion nightmare Hate Crime.\n\nItâs not explicitly mentioned in Appleton and Escottâs excellent albeit often disturbing documentary, but now that weâve opened the Pandoraâs Box into the era of fake news, Deepfakes, conspiracies run amuck, and a real-life virus going viral in every sense of the word, the question is where will found footage films â horror or otherwise â go from here?\n\nThe Found Footage Phenomenon\n\nUS premiere\n\nThursday, Sept. 23, 10:10pm at Alamo Mueller\n\nAvailable on FF@HOME Sept. 30-Oct. 11."
