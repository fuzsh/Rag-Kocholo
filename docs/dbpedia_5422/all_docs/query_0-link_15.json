        "text": "By Scott Ross\n\nThe Dark Crystal (1982) This Jim Henson/Franz Oz collaboration was visually impressive and dramatically anemic in 1982, and the passage of four decades has not diminished the former nor improved the latter. Its David Odell screenplay (from a screen story by Henson) is an oleo of warmed-over Tolkein crossed with Henson’s old ”Land of Gorch” sketches for “Saturday Night.” The picture is short on both humor and wonder, although the puppetry is, as usual for Henson, beautifully designed and managed. It’s essentially Elves vs. Orcs for control of the future, with the Orcs represented by vulture-like creatures called Skeksis, and the outcome is never in doubt. Since there is no suspense, and the characters are defined more by what species they are than by what they say or do, there’s little to occupy either mind or heart. (The most interesting characters are the astronomer Aughra, whose voice was provided by Billie Whitelaw, and the Skeksis Chamberlain skekSil, voiced by Barry Dennen.) It’s certainly worth seeing once, for the puppet designs and for Oswald Morris’ richly textured photography. The recent 4K UHD edition is sumptuous-looking.\n\nThe Gay Divorcee (1935) After their brief duet on “The Carioca” in Flying Down to Rio set up a public clamor for more, a re-teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers by RKO was inevitable. Their first starring vehicle was an adaptation of Astaire’s last Broadway success (The Gay Divorce, a title apparently taboo under the Production Code) and in the blinkered tradition of Hollywood studio lunacy the entire Cole Porter stage score was tossed with the exception of “Night and Day,” its biggest hit. Although the movie isn’t as buoyant as the team’s best work it’s a lively picture, funny, absurd and engaging. It also sets the template for the Astaire-Rogers series: Initial dislike of Fred by Ginger (or like followed by misunderstanding leading to dislike, or some other variation on the theme), cast of wacky supporting actors (such as Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore, Erik Rhodes, the wisecracking Helen Broderick or, here, the charming Alice Brady), screwball complications, a romantic dance and, if we’re lucky, a challenge. I’m one of those oddballs — Pauline Kael was another — who prefer the non-romantic Fred & Ginger routines to their more celebrated ballroom turns, except (as in Follow the Fleet and Swing Time) when the duets are dramatic. Many think the essence of Astaire and Rogers are items like “Cheek to Cheek” and, here, “Night and Day,” and they’re marvelous expressions of romance but they don’t, at least for me, carry the absolute joy of “I’ll Be Hard to Handle,” “Let Yourself Go” and “Pick Yourself Up”… the latter pair of which, juxtaposed that way, sound like an answer in one of those ironic double-feature puzzles. Dances like those sum up the appeal of Astaire and Rogers as a team far more than the formal love-duets; although they, like the ballroom dances, were thoroughly worked out, they feel spontaneous in a way the romantic dances never can. You get a sense, despite the sweat, of the joy of performance in “Isn’t it a Lovely Day (To Be Caught in the Rain?),” for example, and despite Astaire’s displeasure at being part of a team again after his sister Adele broke up the act, of the pleasure each performer took in the other.\n\nThe Gay Divorcee was directed by Mark Sandrich, who guided Astaire and Rogers in more pictures than anyone else, and his crisp style is as much a part of the team’s work as those white Art Deco sets and the loopy plots, usually cobbled by Allan Scott or Dwight Taylor. (This one was written by by George Marion Jr., Dorothy Yost and Edward Kaufman, but the original stage book was by Taylor.) David Abel’s beautiful cinematography, evident here, was on display in five of the nine pictures Astaire and Rogers made together at RKO as well as Holiday Inn, also directed by Sandrich. In this initial offering, the producers (or producer, since Pardo S. Berman was credited) hadn’t yet grasped that Astaire and Rogers were what people wanted to see, not elaborate musical numbers with a cast of thousands, so we get “The Continental” for 17 exhausting minutes, only a few of which are given over to Ginger and Fred. Worse, the creators assigned an entirely extraneous number to Edward Everett Horton(!) and a young Betty Grable, “Let’s K-nock K-nees,” which when I see it always makes me think of Arlene Croce’s riposte in The Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers Book: “Must we?” The “Night and Day” dance, on the other hand, based on the stage version choreographed by Fred, is one of the duets people who love the team remember best, and it’s beautifully worked out. The picture ends with another of Fred’s cleverly conceived dances from the stage show, in which he and Rogers sail over the sofas and chairs of his hotel suite, and it’s so casually charming it makes you grin in deep appreciation.\n\nA personal note: I first saw The Gay Divocee at a summer afternoon library screening about 40 years ago. Seated behind my friend and me were a pair of elderly Jewish women, complete with Molly Picon accents. When the picture began with nightclub patrons, including Fred, playing with little legless dolls through which their forefingers were inserted to make them “dance,” one of the women cooed happily to her companion, “Cute!… is that cute?”\n\nI can never see this movie without recalling the pleasure my friend and I got from that, at that moment and for years afterward in the remembering.\n\nTwilight’s Last Gleaming (1977) A very effective nuclear-nightmare thriller directed by Robert Aldrich which did not find much love when it was released but which deserves a far wider audience. Based by Ronald M. Cohen and Edward Huebsch on a good early ’70s novel by the reliable Walter Wager the story, about a band of escaped convicts led by a former Army general who take over a missile launching site, while far-fetched, is taut and tidy and builds nicely to its unexpected conclusion. Burt Lancaster is the general (of course) and his gang includes the always-wonderful Paul Winfield and a typically weaselly Burt Young. On the government side are the unmatchable Melvyn Douglas as the Secretary of Defense, Joseph Cotten as the Secretary of State, Richard Widmark as a duplicitous Air Force general, the excellent Gerald S. O’Loughlin as the White House chief of staff, and Charles Durning as the president. The part was offered to Henry Fonda, who passed, and Durning not only delivers a superb performance, but the role turns out to be the great one of the picture.\n\nCohen and Huebsch cannily upped the ante for Lancaster, making what in Wager is merely a bid for money and freedom far more selfless and democratically sound (the general becomes a kind of Ellsberg figure), making the climax both shocking and inevitable. Aldrich, whose direction seems to me ideal for a movie of this kind, makes extensive use of split-screen throughout the picture, feeling that “you couldn’t tell that story in less than three hours without them.” There are times when the split-screens feel excessive, although it’s possible they would seem less so on a big theater screen. Yet they’re brilliantly manipulated overall, and even when the dialogue in one panel overlaps with that in another, you never miss who is speaking or what is being said; as with Howard Hawks’ overlapping dialogue, nothing of importance is lost. The movie’s crystalline cinematography is by Robert B. Hauser, the kinetic editing is by Michael Luciano, William Martin and Maury Winetrobe and Jerry Goldsmith provided a brief but very effective musical score. The terrific supporting cast includes Richard Jaeckel, William Marshall, Leif Erickson, Charles Aidman, Charles McGraw, John Ratzenberger and, in too brief a role, Roscoe Lee Browne.\n\nRoberta (1935) Such were the vagaries of the 1930s Hollywood studio system that Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, fresh from their triumph in The Gay Divorcee, were cast as supporting characters in this adaptation of the Jerome Kern/Otto Harbach stage musical. One doesn’t mind so much that their over-the-title co-star is the charming Irene Dunne; that Randolph Scott is given equal weight is practically an offense against God and Mammon. His performance in this, and in the subsequent Follow the Fleet (see below) leave one to marvel that he ever had an important career, or that he may have been the love of Cary Grant’s young life. I hope at least he was good in bed, because he certainly stinks up this movie.\n\nWhen Fred and Ginger are on screen, or Helen Westley as Dunne’s eponymous dress-designing aunt, or Dunne herself is singing “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,” Roberta is first-rate entertainment. So let’s concentrate on those strengths, shall we, and forget if we can Scott’s performance and the number of times he says something is “swell”? Fred plays a bandleader, and gets a lively number (“Let’s Begin”) with his musicians, notably Candy Candido, with whom he does a kind of genderfuck bit avant la lettre. Ginger is Fred’s American former girlfriend, passing herself off as a Polish countess (I’m not kidding) in Paris. Although Astaire and Rogers do one of their ballroom specialties, to “Lovely to Look At” and “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,” their two other numbers are a lot more fun: The satirical “I Won’t Dance” and “I’ll Be Hard to Handle,” one of those joyous episodes of thoroughly worked-out yet seemingly impromptu hoofing that were, even more than their signature romantic duets, their peculiar specialty. On the debit side, Dunne has to perform “Yesterdays,” featuring one of Harbach’s worst sets of lyrics. No singer, not even one as lyrical as Irene Dunne, can be expected to triumph with lyrics like,\n\nYesterdays\n\nDays I knew as happy sweet\n\nSequestered days […]\n\nThen gay youth was mine\n\nAnd truth was mine\n\nJoyous free and flaming life\n\nForsooth was mine\n\nWho in the 1930s talked like that, let alone sang? That last bit is so convoluted and linguistically passé it occasioned one of Billie Holiday’s few recorded lyric flubs.\n\nWilliam A. Seiter, most of whose pictures were mediocrities, directed with intelligence and a certain gracefulness of style that does what it can to make the material seem more interesting than it is. Alan Scott was one of the three credited screenwriters, and the author of the movie’s “additional dialogue” was the same Glenn Tryon who starred in the 1926 silent comedy 45 Minutes from Hollywood, with Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy in brief cameos, and who would go on to star in two movies (Lonesome and Broadway) for the expressionistic Hungarian director Paul Fejos before drifting into screenwriting and direction.\n\nBetty Boop: The Essential Collection, Volume I – IV (1930 – 1938) These four Blu-Rays from the sadly now defunct Olive Films represent both the best of the series produced by Max Fleischer and directed by his brother Dave, and the worst. The Fleischers weren’t entirely to blame for the decline of the Betty Boop cartoons; once the Production Code went into full force, Betty was made less sexy and more respectable, and it killed her character: Her innocent sexuality was what made her so appealing; without that she had no real reason for being. External pressures to one side, there is absolutely no excuse for items like the 1937 Betty and Grampy short Zula Hula with its astonishingly crude and insensitive African caricatures. The Fleischers have been criticized for things like turning Louis Armstrong into a cartoon cannibal chasing Bimbo and Koko the Clown in I’ll Be Glad When You’re Dead, You Rascal You (1932) but the natives in Zula Hula are offensive beyond my ability to comprehend the why of them. You could almost forgive that if the damn thing was funny, but none of the later Boops is amusing in the slightest. It was as if, having been robbed of the slight, daring whiff of salaciousness that clung to Betty’s character, the Fleischers didn’t know what the hell to do with her. The animation in the shorts continued to be exceptional, but what good is that if you aren’t laughing?\n\nFortunately the discs contain all the great Betty Boop cartoons from the early ’30s, when the Fleischers’ invention, sense of humor and casual surrealism were in their glory. (Speaking of stereotypes: There are several “pansy” gags in the Bettys; when a Frankenstein monster threatens her in Betty Boop’s Penthouse and she hits him with plant spray he turns first into a ballet dancer and then into a literal pansy.) One of the visual aspects of the Boop shorts I like best are the thick, Art Nouveau lines around the characters; it gives them a distinctive look that can’t be mistaken for the product of any other studio. The Fleischers were enamored of the Rotoscope technique Max had developed and used it, I think, excessively. This is nowhere better illustrated than in the 1938 Thrills and Chills, in which when Betty skates on the ice she becomes weirdly elongated, and it’s obvious her head and body have been drawn over those of a live model… and the business just goes on and on, as if Dave was so in love with the process he just couldn’t stop Rotoscoping.\n\nJust as Disney and Ub Iwerks were the products of their Midwestern upbringings, the Fleischers were New York to their core. That’s reflected not only in the daring sexiness of the shorts but in their soundtracks, which not only tend to the jazzy; several times they employ jazz and swing musicians, especially Cab Calloway, who is in three Betty Boop cartoons, cleverly Rotoscoped. In the bizarre Minnie the Moocher (1932) he appears as a walrus with a bobtail; in the fantastic The Old Man of the Mountain (1933) he’s the eponymous villain; and in what may be the single best entry in the series, the 1933 Snow-White, the Wicked Queen in her witch guise transforms Koko into a ghost with long human legs who dances to “Saint James Infirmary” via Calloway’s hip vocal and trademark sliding movements. Other disc highlights: The wildly surrealistic Bimbo’s Initiation (1931) satirizing fraternity rites; the clever Stop That Noise (1935); the two-strip Technicolor Poor Cinderella (1934) featuring Max’s beloved 3D effects, achieved through the use of small motorized sets against which the animated drawings were superimposed; the charming Parade of the Wooden Soldiers (1934); the melodrama spoof She Wronged Him Right (1934); and Betty Boop’s Bizzy Bee (1932) in which she runs a diner whose sole menu item seems to be hotcakes.\n\nSunset (1988) An amiable pastiche written and directed by Blake Edwards (based on unpublished manuscript by Rod Amateau) set in late-1920s Hollywood and teaming Wyatt Earp and Tom Mix to investigate a murder mystery involving studio power, gangsters and the fabled corrupt Los Angeles law enforcement James Ellroy has built a career on. That Earp is played by James Garner and Mix by Bruce Willis, on the cusp of his Die Hard stardom, is a good indication of the charm factor attending this slight but most enjoyable fantasia from one of the last great American purveyors of pleasure at the movies.\n\nGarner had played Earp 20 years earlier, in the post-OK Corral The Hour of the Gun, and it was bitter portraiture, grim and obsessive. The Earp of Sunset is more mellow if no less tough and determined and Garner gives the sort of relaxed, intensely likable performance that had become his personal metier, nicely matched by Willis’ laconic good humor. The autumnal cinematography was the work of Anthony B. Richmond, Henry Mancini provided a tuneful, engaging musical score, and the rich supporting cast includes Mariel Hemingway, Kathleen Quinlan, the director’s daughter Jennifer Edwards, Richard Bradford, M. Emmet Walsh, Joe Dallesandro, Dann Florek, Dermot Mulroney, the wonderful Patricia Hodge as the wronged woman in the case and Malcolm McDowell as her shady, dangerous husband. A truly sick character, McDowell’s is perhaps the ultimate creative expression of the difference between a beloved public clown and his dark private persona. Edwards, who had directed Peter Sellers in six pictures, had been around Hollywood for decades and who suffered throughout his life his own periods of debilitating depression — not for nothing was he known by his friends as “Blackie” — knew that comedy produces more than its share of unusually disturbed individuals.\n\nFor what it’s worth, Earp really did serve as a technical advisor in Hollywood, for Mix and others.\n\nThe Last Picture Show (1971) Criterion’s new 4K UHD edition of Peter Bogdanovich’s 1992 Director’s Cut convinces me that this rich evocation by the filmmaker and Larry McMurtry of the latter’s early novel depicting adolescence in a blighted 1950s Texas town is not only among the finest of all American movies of the 1970s but quite possibly Bogdanovich’s best work.\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (1941) John Huston’s debut as a screenwriter-director and the second important step in Humphrey Bogart’s ascendancy to stardom following High Sierra retains its status as one of the most perfect entertainments of the studio era. The “Warner 100” 4K UHD edition brings out of the rich quality of Arthur Edeson’s already sumptuous lighting.\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) Another old favorite revisited in its recent 4K UHD restoration. Last year’s 4K Cinderella unaccountably destroyed the beauty of Marc Davis’ miraculous rendering of its heroine’s fairy-dust transformation before the ball. This version of Snow White on the other hand is mouth-watering, the movie’s already remarkable look burnished and enhanced by the process.\n\nTexasville (1990; Black-and-White Director’s Cut) Included on the new Criterion edition of The Last Picture Show, this warm-hearted sequel is presented in the form its director envisioned; In black-and-white, and lengthened by nearly 30 minutes, deepening the relationships and bringing out more of its comic values.\n\nTop Hat (1935) No one should be forced to choose a single Astaire-Rogers musical, and I am always torn between this one and Swing Time. Top Hat is probably the better movie: it’s swifter, more sparkling, lays some nice emphasis on those two incomparable sissies Eric Blore and Edward Everett Horton, and boasts a perfect Irving Berlin score including a title song that elegantly sums up the appeal of Fred Astaire, whom Graham Greene once called the human equivalent of Mickey Mouse. That isn’t the insult it seems; in the early ‘30s Mickey was not yet the figure of dull respectability he became; he was rambunctious, elastic, mischievous, even slightly cruel — just like Fred.\n\nPerhaps inspired by their “Let Yourself Go” duet in Follow the Fleet Astaire and Rogers also get a challenge-dance here to “Isn’t This a Lovely Day (to be Caught in the Rain?)” that is not only among their half-dozen or so best routines, it’s also a rapturous expression of the sheer joy of performance. If these two didn’t fall in love after a number like that, one of them would have to be frigid and the other gay. After the requisite complications, masquerades and misunderstandings, the pair performs Berlin’s lilting, sensuous “Cheek to Cheek” in a Venice ballroom and featuring Ginger’s feathered dress which, although it drove her partner to distraction, proved that she understood what looked best on her when she danced with him; and another of those new dance sensations, “The Piccolino,” led off by Ginger’s charming verse and chorus. This brings me to a side-note: However wonderful a performer Fred Astaire was — and aside from his status as the finest dancer the movies have ever known he was also one of the American songbook’s great stylists — compare the way he listens to Ginger singing with the way in which she takes in his vocalizations: He smiles a lot but looks faintly glazed; she hangs on every word whether she’s facing him or not, and always seems to be hearing them for the first time. She not only (in the cartoonist Bob Thaves’ memorable phrase) “did everything Fred did, backwards and in heels”; at times she also acted him off the screen.\n\nAll of the members of the RKO Astaire-Rogers machine were involved here: The producer Pando S. Berman; the director Mark Sandrich (he made five of their pictures, and his style is modest but elegant and his pacing is nearly always perfect); the screenwriters Allan Scott and Dwight Taylor; the cinematographer David Abel, whose polished black-and-white photography is what we think of when we remember the Astaire-Rogers pictures, along with those gloriously anachronistic all-white Art Deco sets designed by Carroll Clark but erroneously attributed the wonderfully-named Van Nest Polglase (Venice never looked so clean); the choreography was by Fred with Hermes Pan; the musical direction and orchestrations were by Hal Bourne; and the cast includes Erik Rhodes as a silly, English-mangling Italian co-respondent, Horton as Fred’s manager, the vermouth-dry Helen Broderick as his wife and Blore as his butler Bates, who feuds with him throughout and whose machinations resolve the plot. The main titles, incidentally, are fairly unique for their time, with first Fred’s feet and legs dancing into the frame and appearing above his name, and then Ginger’s. It’s a marvelously stylish gesture, almost a shorthand, one that hints at the spirited revelry to come.\n\nProduced on a relatively lavish Depression-era budget of $609,000, Top Hat brought in $3.2 million at the box-office, and became the most profitable RKO release of the decade.\n\nFollow the Fleet (1936) Adhering to the pattern set by Roberta in 1935 (and why would you want to?) RKO once again made Astaire and Rogers more or less subservient to Randolph Scott. As if that wasn’t bad enough the men play sailors, and Astaire’s idea of expressing his working-class bona fides is to constantly be chewing gum.\n\nWell, at least Irving Berlin wrote the songs. Ginger gets the sexy “Let Yourself Go,” which she and Fred then dance to, in an “impromptu” ballroom contest exhibition. It’s one of their most joyous numbers, performed by both of them with a rubber-legged, loose-limbed panache that makes you smile broadly throughout. Most of Fred’s numbers are done with his Navy band (“We Saw The Sea,” “I’d Rather Lead A Band,” “I’m Putting All My Eggs in One Basket”) but Harriet Hilliard, the future Mrs. Ozzie Nelson (and mother of Ricky) has a splendid solo in “Get Thee Behind Me, Satan.” I know I’m in the minority in believing this to be one of Berlin’s finest ballads, but it is in any case beautifully framed by the director Mark Sandrich and his cinematographer David Abel, and at least partially redeems the horrible “Why, without your glasses you’re beautiful!” old-maid cliché Hilliard is forced to endure before she sings. (Berlin originally wrote the song, interestingly, for Rogers to perform in Top Hat. Obviously, he thought well of it.) What makes Follow the Fleet special, however, and secures it a place in movie musical history (or at least, in Astaire-Rogers iconography) is the “Let’s Face the Music and Dance” number. It was the most dramatic entry in the series until “Never Gonna Dance” in Swing Time displaced it a year later, and its seriousness of intent — it begins with Fred and Ginger in a gambling den, separately losing their bankrolls and contemplating suicide — is almost shocking in the context of so light an entertainment, and the dance between them is so charged with unstated emotionalism it’s hair-raising.\n\nThe screenplay was credited to Allan and Scott Dwight Taylor with “Additional Dialogue,” as they used to say, by Lew Lipton. At least in this one Randolph Scott doesn’t say “Swell!” every other line. Sharp eyes will spot Betty Grable as a trio singer, Lucille Ball in a small role and Humphrey Bogart as a sailor. The Hubert Osbourne 1922 play Shore Leave, on which Follow the Fleet was based, incidentally, had a long afterlife: It was also the source for the 1927 Vincent Youmans musical Hit the Deck, itself filmed by MGM in 1955.\n\nTouch of Evil (1958) Kino’s 4K UHD edition of the dark, unsettling Orson Welles thriller reminds us that this skewed police procedural is one of the key pictures, both in Welles’ filmography, and of the decade in which it was made.\n\nThe Trial (1962) Orson Welles‘ adaptation of the Kafka novel has always been the movie of his I like least… or was, anyway, before I saw his television film of the Isek Dinesen The Immortal Story, which I like even less. I feel in this a bit like the filmmaker’s disciple Peter Bogdanovich, whom Welles never tired of twitting by referring to The Trial as “that picture you hate.” It’s difficult to say exactly what it is about it that leaves me cold; it’s one of those movies that works in nearly every individual scene yet never comes together for me in a fully satisfying manner. In the early ’80s I heard an academic posit on “All Things Considered” that Dr. Strangelove could not be considered an entirely successful satire because there isn’t a single sane character in it, but Candide is brilliant satire and no one could consider its eponymous hero remotely sane until the end. Still, there is no one in Welles’ version of The Trial with whom we can entirely identify, and perhaps that’s the problem. The confusion of Anthony Perkins’ Josef K. about what is happening to him is palpable (Perkins is very good) but, at least as the writer-director of this movie envisions him, K. is snide and ambitious and guilty of indeterminate social crimes that distance him from us as surely as he distances himself from his insurance company employees by occupying an elevated office from which to conspicuously lord it over them.\n\nWelles was famously forced to improvise his sets for The Trial when the funding fell through, filming the picture in the then largely abandoned Gare d’Orsay, which has since become the Musée d’Orsay, and the riveted walls give the images an otherworldly quality that adds measurably to the picture’s feeling of an endless nightmare. The new 4K UHD Criterion print restores it to something I assume approximates its original pictorial brilliance, light and shadow beautifully in balance. (The richly textured cinematography was by Edmond Richard.) In addition to Perkins, Welles gets marvelous performances from Jeanne Moreau, Romy Schneider, Elsa Martinelli, Suzanne Flon, Akim Tamiroff, Madeleine Robinson, William Chappell and himself as the satanic Advocate, smoke cigar rising from his head like something emerging from the vents of Hell.\n\nFor the record, I admit I liked The Trial a little better this time. Perhaps in another 10 years and another five screenings I’ll come to consider it one of Welles’ best… but I doubt it.\n\nCopyright 2023 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nHome-viewing from The Armchair Theatre over the last three months; because there isn’t a single bloody thing in the cinemas worth the time, petrol, cash or personal energy it would take to go out. Although I will admit I was convinced by a friend to attend a special screening of Daughters of the Dust… thereby proving the point.\n\nTootsie (1982) Take one vanity project for a notoriously self-involved actor (Murray Schisgal writing a screenplay about acting for Dustin Hoffman); mix with a separate script by Don McGuire concerning an out-of-work performer donning drag for a soap-opera role that borrows a bit too liberally from Some Like it Hot, even unto its blond object of affection and unwanted middle-aged suitors; add in re-writes by a small army of scenarists headed by the great Larry Gelbart and including, un-credited, Barry Levinson, Robert Garland and Elaine May; bake by a director widely known as one of Hollywood’s most notorious writer fuckers (Gelbart claimed the movie was stitched together from any number of scenarists’ drafts), and the result should have been a disaster. Instead, through some weird alchemy it not only wasn’t but somehow those ingredients contrived to blend so well the picture became a small classic of its kind. Revisiting Tootsie from a 35-year remove, it seems almost miraculous: A popular comedy that tickles the mind as often as it does the ribs. And the direction, by Sydney Pollack, never a favorite filmmaker of this writer, looks as good now as it did in 1982; whatever its internal flaws (including a series of consecutive events supposedly encompassing a single evening that Gelbart later wrote was “a night that would have to last a hundred hours”) the picture is strikingly lovely, with Owen Roizman’s sumptuous lighting and the crisp, witty editing by Fredric Steinkamp and William Steinkamp giving it a patina of warmth and sophistication, a rare combination for any movie comedy.\n\nHoffman’s “Dorothy Michaels” ranks as one of the great comic creations in American movies, yet the actor also locates the loneliness of the character — or, rather characters, since everything Dorothy says and does is filtered through Michael Dorsey’s brain and emotions — and an essential sweetness and decency Michael himself lacks when he’s wearing pants.* As the unwitting object of Michael’s interests, Jessica Lange was a revelation in 1982, lightness and gravity in balance, and what she does is still astonishing in the sheer rightness of her every glance, inflection and wistful hesitation. Terri Garr is no less entrancing, in what is surely her best screen performance, and Bill Murray gets the picture’s best lines as Michael’s playwright roommate. (May created the character, and wrote his speeches.) Against his own wishes, Pollack took on the role of Hoffman’s agent, and their scenes together, reflecting some of the very real anger and frustration each felt toward the other, are among the movie’s comic highlights. The wonderful supporting cast includes Dabney Coleman as the sexist television director, Charles Durning and George Gaynes in the Joe E. Brown role(s), Doris Belack as the savvy “daytime drama” producer, Geena Davis as a nurse in the soap-within-a-film’s fictional hospital, and the late Lynne Thigpen as the show’s floor manager. Dave Grusin, who often floundered when composing for dramatic pictures, wrote for Tootsie one of his most felicitous comedy scores. It isn’t funny in itself, nor does it try to be; its alternate airs of peppy urbanity and plangent emotionalism make for a perfect juxtaposition that reflects the plot’s development and moods without attempting either to compete with them, or to ape the action.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n* Hoffman based Dorothy’s soft Southern vocal mannerisms on those of his friend Polly Holiday.\n\nThey Might Be Giants (1971) James Goldman has long been one of my favorite writers. While nowhere near as prolific (nor as well known) as his brother William, his smaller output includes the 1965 play and subsequent movie 1968 The Lion in Winter (for which he won an Academy Award); the beautifully compressed book for the landmark Stephen Sondheim/Harold Prince Follies, arguably the single greatest theatrical musical of the 20th century; the wonderfully conceived and unexpectedly moving Robin and Marian (1976); a superb novel about King John, Myself as Witness, in which Goldman re-examined an historical figure he felt he had maligned in his previous writing; and the play on which this lovely picture was based and for which he wrote the perfectly structured adaptation. Hal Prince produced the play’s only major production in London, later castigating himself for hiring the wrong director (Joan Littlewood) for the piece, although Goldman himself said he was unhappy with the script, which he subsequently withdrew from further production. The movie, while disappointing financially — presumably those involved expected another Lion in Winter — is a blissful variation on Arthur Conan Doyle, in which a mad retired jurist (George C. Scott) called Justin Playfair, who believes he is Sherlock Holmes, is examined by a psychiatrist (Joanne Woodward) named Mildred Watson. They meet as antagonists, form an uneasy alliance and drift toward romance, while Playfair seeks a rendezvous with the elusive Professor Moriarty. It may sound twee, and there are many on whom its gentle charms are no doubt lost, but it’s a funny, and surprisingly emotional, rumination on the relative insanity of a brilliant, harmless paranoid and of the increasingly mad society to which he is expected to conform. That last notion no doubt seems trite, but it has seldom been handled with such deftness and wit. Anthony Harvey, who also directed The Lion in Winter, shot the picture with a nervy energy that captures the New York City of the early 1970s, not as if under glass but as a living stage for Playfair’s intrigues.\n\nScott and Woodward tear into their roles with the relish of great actors who know in their bones they’ve got their hands on some of the choicest dialogue around, and the rich supporting cast includes Jack Gilford, Al Lewis, Rue McClanahan, Theresa Merritt, Eugene Roche, James Tolkan, Kitty Winn, Sudie Bond, Staats Cotsworth, F. Murray Abraham, Paul Benedict, M. Emmet Walsh and Louis Zorich. There’s also a brief but extremely effective chamber score by John Barry, arranged and augmented by Ken Thorne. Two home-video versions exist: One (a Universal Vault DVD) running under 90 minutes, reflects the theatrical release while the other, the television edit (on Blu-Ray from Kino Lorber) is longer, and includes the wry, delightful extended sequence in an immense Manhattan grocery store. It could, I suppose, be argued that the story doesn’t need the grocery sequence, and the climax plays well without it. But it also seems to me that the movie is enriched by its inclusion, and diminished by its excision. So, caveat emptor.\n\nDr. Mildred Watson: You’re just like Don Quixote. You think that everything is always something else.\n\nJustin Playfair: Well, he had a point. ‘Course, he carried it a bit too far. He thought that every windmill was a giant. That’s insane. But, thinking that they might be, well… All the best minds used to think the world was flat. But what if it isn’t? It might be round. And bread mold might be medicine. If we never looked at things and thought of what might be, why we’d all still be out there in the tall grass with the apes.\n\nDaughters of the Dust (1991) Julie Dash’s dreamlike evocation of Gulla society on a small South Carolina island in the early years of the 20th century was well-received critically but not a box-office success. 20/20 hindsight by knee-jerk commentators now has it that the picture was badly handled by its distributor because its writer-director was not only a woman, but a black woman. Yet I don’t see how this luminously photographed exercise in non-linear rumination could have been a popular success in any era: It’s so diffuse it seems less Impressionistic than merely undefined; we can scarcely tell what the various narrative threads are, much less what they mean. What’s best about the picture, aside from Arthur Jafa’s exquisite cinematography, are the wonderful faces of the expressive actors, especially those of Cora Lee Day as the family matriarch clinging to her African roots and religion, Cheryl Lynn Bruce as her overly-devout Christian granddaughter, and Barbara-O as her mirror opposite, a wayward young woman who left the island for a man but who now is involved with a younger woman. But 60 minutes into this hour-and-52-minute glorified student film my eyes had long since begun to glaze over and even those interesting faces weren’t enough to clear them.\n\nThe Last Hard Men (1976) A tough, bloody Western from an unsparing Brian Garfield novel, starring Charlton Heston and James Coburn as old antagonists on a collision course. Although (unlike in the book’s ending) the movie’s climax seemingly leaves his character’s survival in doubt, and while the actor was too young for the role — as Garfield wrote it, the former lawman is in his 60s, and becoming increasingly frail — Heston is quite a good match for the ruthless Coburn, and the filmmakers (Andrew V. McLaglen was the director, and Guerdon Trueblood wrote the script) don’t flinch from the story’s most horrific moment, when the Heston figure’s daughter (Barbara Hershey) is gang-raped by Coburn’s team of escaped prisoners. The role of Hershey’s earnest suitor is the sort of part the young Jeff Bridges could have turned into a third lead by doing almost nothing, and while Chris Mitchum is attractive, he’s completely out of his depth; as an actor he was never much more than the pretty son of a movie star. While the performance of Michael Parks, as the sheriff who accompanies Heston on part of the quest to retrieve his daughter, suffers from his role being less interesting than in the Garfield book, the actors playing Coburn’s gang (Jorge Rivero, Thalmus Rasulala, Morgan Paull, Robert Donner, Riley Hill and especially Larry Wilcox and John Quade) are an impressively frightening bunch and Duke Callaghan’s widescreen cinematography is lustrous. Leonard Rosenman composed a terse, uncompromising score (it was later made available on CD) which was then replaced by a collection of newly-recorded cues from several of Jerry Goldsmith’s previous 20th Century-Fox titles — 100 Rifles (1969), Rio Conchos (1964), Morituri (1965) and the 1966 Stagecoach. I assume this was due to their being more traditional action cues and Western pieces than Rosenman’s dark, brooding compositions. But while they are splendid in themselves, if you’re already familiar with them from their sources they’re a needless distraction.\n\n“Johnny Quest“: The Complete Original Series (1964 – 1965) When I was a child the Saturday morning re-airings of this 1964 one-shot, an impressive attempt by Joseph Barbera and William Hanna to create and direct a weekly prime-time animated adventure series,‡ made an enormous impression. It was the first “serious” animation I’d ever seen, its often eerie plot-lines were, for a 5-year old, fascinatingly scary… and in the titular figure, the irrepressible blond-topped All-American Jonny, lay my first big crush.† The gifted comics artist Doug Wildey designed the show and its central cast: Plucky Jonny, his slightly mystical adopted Indian brother Hadji, father Benton Quest and bodyguard Race Bannon (who, white hair aside, was, somewhat confusingly for me, almost a dead-ringer for my own father). Produced in the so-called “limited” format pioneered by Hanna-Barbera, and which Chuck Jones astutely referred to as “illustrated radio,” the series, re-viewed from an adult perspective, contains highly variable animation; there are times when the characters are beautifully drawn, while at others they are remarkably poorly drafted, and this older viewer could certainly do with less of Jonny’s annoying little dog Bandit. But the stories are nearly always, despite a 26-minute limitation, well-plotted and exciting, often with an agreeable avoidance of earthly explanation for seemingly supernatural phenomenon. Children, like many of their adult counterparts, love to be frightened, and they especially love ghost stories and impossible monsters; it was a consistent reliance on rationality than killed my initial enthusiasm for the later H-B “Scooby Doo, Where Are You?”\n\nAmong the pleasures of the series were, and are, the voices, especially the appealing Tim Matheson as Jonny, the undemonstrably masculine Mike Road as Race, the charming Danny Bravo — who seems to have based his vocal characterization on Sabu — as Hadji, Vic Perrin as the show’s recurring villain Dr. Zinn and occasional guest artists such as Keye Luke, Jesse White, J. Pat O’Malley and even, astonishingly, Everett Sloan as an unrepentant old Nazi. Hoyt Curtin’s superb main title theme, with its bracing mix of big band and James Bond, is another asset; most of the incidental music is his, with additional and uncredited compositions by Ted Nichols. Many of the series’ best (and creepiest) episodes were written by William Hamilton: “The Robot Spy,” “Dragons of Ashida,” “Turu the Terrible,” “Werewolf of the Timberland” and “The Invisible Monster.” Among the others of especial note are “The Curse of Anubis” (Walter Black), “Calcutta Adventure” (Joanna Lee), and “Shadow of the Condor” and “The House of Seven Gargoyles” (both by Charles Hoffman). The recent Warner Archives Blu-Ray collection, while it contains few extras, looks terrific.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n† Like “Top Cat” and “The Jestsons,” “Jonny Quest” lasted only a single prime-time season. But when you’re a child, you’re not counting episodes, and due to repeated Saturday morning re-airings all three shows seemed to run forever.\n\n‡How typical of me that my first big crush would be not another boy but a cartoon character… Still, I don’t know whether it was so much that I was attracted to Jonny as that I longed to be him. And isn’t hero-worship often what early same-sex crushes amount to?\n\nKlute (1971) The truly chilling paranoia thriller starring Donald Sutherland and Jane Fonda, who as the call-girl Bree Daniels gives what I consider the finest performance by an American movie actor of the last 50 years.\n\nIn the Heat of the Night (1967) This tense, unblinking police procedural coated in a patina of social critique was one of the great successes of its year, which also saw the premier of Bonnie and Clyde. And while the picture is very much of its time in its examination of racist bigotry in the then-current American Deep South, it’s also a brisk, exciting detective thriller that holds up remarkably well, not least due to the crisp direction by Norman Jewison and to the picture’s precise Stirling Silliphant screenplay. Indeed, I prefer Silliphant’s creative adaptation to John Ball’s original novel, in which race is an important component, yet is less central to the narrative’s tensions than in the much bolder, angrier, movie, especially via the incendiary central relationship between Sidney Poitier’s Virgil Tibbs and Rod Steiger’s Chief Gilliespie. It should be remembered that the picture was in release only three years after the murders of Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner, and the sense of dangerous rot and slowly simmering violence Jewison captures onscreen is as palpable as the oppressive, humid heat of its Mississippi setting. (Although most of it was shot in the southern Illinois town of Sparta.) Poitier gives a performance of wit, implacable inner strength and fierce integrity. There are a number of moments in the picture where what we see in a character’s face is more revealing, and quietly powerful, than what is said. Poitier has one such scene, when Steiger dismisses him, and his assistance in the murder investigation. Perhaps the most difficult thing an actor can do is to allow us to see him thinking. Too many actors project thought in those moments, and it’s nearly always phony. With Poitier, the impact registers itself in, first, his disbelief, followed by his fury, and, finally, a soft, subtle smile. He gets it; he’s been here before. Yet none of what we see is obvious, or overdone.\n\nLee Grant, as the widow of the murder victim, has a similar scene where, shocked into silence by the news of her husband’s death, she reacts against Poitier’s gentle attempt to seat her with an anguished, rigid gesture that slowly turns to acceptance and, more potently, the need to be comforted. It’s devastating to watch. As the racist sheriff, Steiger, at the height of his screen prowess, meets his co-star blow-for-blow. Gillespie is as much an outsider in the town as Virgil, and as distrusted by the locals. His tension is coiled deep, and he expresses that inner explosiveness in the way he compulsively chews gum, stopping only when he has something to say, or when comprehension breaks through his consciousness. The supporting roles are so perfectly cast they seem inevitable — absolutely real: Warren Oates as a patrolman with a secret; Larry Gates as a smooth and powerful old racist; the usually genial William Schallert as the bigoted mayor; Beah Richards as the local abortionist; Quentin Dean as a white-trash slut; Anthony James as a smirking creep; Scott Wilson as a prime suspect in the killing, whose changing relationship to Virgil is far warmer than what transpires between Tibbs and Gillespie; and Jester Hairston as an Uncle Tom butler outraged by Tibbs slapping his employer. (If you look sharp, you’ll also see Harry Dean Stanton as a cop.) That slap was a blow for liberty, and must have resounded sharply in many places across the globe, not merely the Southern United States. The dark, expressive cinematography is by Haskell Wexler — cheated by the constricted budget of a crane, he and Jewison make frequent, and often very effective, use of zoom lenses. Hal Ashby provided the fluid editing, and Quincy Jones’ score, mixing jazz and blues, has a nervous, funky energy perfectly in keeping with the movie’s sense of dark foreboding, and he composed a terrific main title song (with lyrics by Marilyn and Alan Bergman) that’s sung with passionate soul by Ray Charles. Jones’ cue for Wilson’s attempted escape (and suggested by Jewison) is a highlight, puttering out expressively as the murder suspect realizes he’s licked — the musical equivalent of a runner who’s out of breath.\n\nGhostbusters (1984) Horror comedy was far from a new concept when Ghostbusters was made — Harold Lloyd starred in something rather redundantly called Haunted Spooks in 1920 — but until 1981 and An American Werewolf in London there had never been one with elaborate special-effects, and even that was modestly budgeted; Ghostbusters cost six times as much (its budget was between $25 and 30 million.) Most of its predecessors tend to be either comedies with a few ghostly appurtenances (cf., Bob Hope’s The Ghost Breakers, Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, Young Frankenstein and Don Knotts’ The Ghost and Mr. Chicken) or genuine horror with black comedy overtones (The Abominable Dr. Phibes, Theatre of Blood, Phantom of the Paradise and, indeed, American Werewolf in London) but Ghostbusters takes nothing seriously. Its writer/stars, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, see everything as funny, and since The Ghostbusters themselves seldom panic, we spend the entire movie in a state of amused relaxation right along with them; the audience takes its cue from laid-back smart-ass Bill Murray’s Peter Venkman, for whom the entire natural world is a sardonic joke, so why should the supernatural world be any different? Murray’s comic persona is so relaxed he’s like a more sarcastic version of Bing Crosby.\n\nThe picture is inconsequential — you smile through most of it, even if you seldom laugh out loud — yet at the same time memorable; several of its set-pieces, phrases and gags became instant cultural touchstones, and after seeing the movie you’ll likely never look at a bag of marshmallows the same way. Sigourney Weaver has a good, serio-comic role as the woman whose apartment is being taken over by an ancient deity, Rick Moranis is sweetly oblivious as a dweeby neighbor, Annie Potts is the Ghostbusters’ preternaturally un-fazable secretary, William Atherton is an officious prick from the EPA (why do so many satires go after EPA rather than corporate polluters?) and Ernie Hudson gets a largely thankless role as the token black member of the team. László Kovács shot the movie beautifully, and the veteran Elmer Bernstein composed a score that, anchored to a loping main theme, was almost too effective: Despite his having composed in his long career everything from epics (The Ten Commandments) and Westerns (The Magnificent Seven) to thrillers (The Great Escape) and intimate dramas (To Kill a Mockingbird) and in every conceivable format from symphonic to jazz, the success of Airplane!, The Blues Brothers, An American Werewolf, Trading Places and Ghostbusters got him typecast for years as purely a comedy composer.\n\nTouch of Evil (1958) Orson Welles‘ minor masterpiece, and the last time he was permitted the luxury of the studio system’s largess.\n\nThe Pink Panther (1963)\n\nA Shot in the Dark (1964)\n\nThe Return of the Pink Panther (1975)\n\nThe Pink Panther Strikes Again (1976)\n\nRevenge of the Pink Panther (1978)\n\nThe Trail of the Pink Panther (1982)\n\nHow Blake Edwards took his love for silent comedy routines deep into the post-War pop consciousness.\n\nChinatown (1974) The modern classic by Robert Towne and Roman Polanski.\n\nBeetlejuice (1988) I misunderstood Beetlejuice when it was new; my contemporary review (fortunately now lost to the landfills) betrayed a certain — and to me, now, inexplicable — inability to keep pace with Tim Burton’s patented blend of amiability and dark comic outrage. It wasn’t that I couldn’t appreciate his often exhilarating blend of comedy and horror; the Large Marge sequence in Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure made me laugh so hard I nearly fell out of my seat. But I somehow wasn’t ready for an entire feature with that sensibility, unfettered. Revisiting Beetlejuice now, as I feel compelled to do every few years, I can’t help wondering why my younger self couldn’t relax enough to embrace such a cheerfully anarchic comedy as this one. Written by Michael McDowell (sadly, one of all too many creative men who succumbed to AIDS) and Warren Skaaren (also now prematurely dead, of bone cancer) from a story by McDowell and Larry Wilson, it’s a spook-fest for jaded children, a supernatural comedy that stints neither on the humor nor the paranormal.\n\nAs the nice young Connecticut couple who discover they’re dead and doomed to live with the wacko modern artist and her bourgeois real-estate developer husband they can’t scare away, Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis embody the spirit of the whole enterprise; they’re too sweetly gentle to make decent ghosts. As the titular “bio-exorcist,” Michael Keaton was a revelation, and his performance still amazes; nothing he’d done in movies up to that point had prepared us for the primal forces he unleashed in himself as Beetlejuice. His non-stop patter, loopy asides, gross-out wit and sheer brazen crudity were like nothing we’d seen in a movie comedy before. I think you’d have to imagine how movie audiences reacted the first time they saw the Marx Brothers to understand the impact that performance had on us in 1988. The strong supporting cast includes a very young Winona Ryder as the developer’s slightly off, death-obsessed teenage daughter; the peerlessly self-satisfied Jeffrey Jones as her father; the ever-treasurable Catherine O’Hara as his nasty, pretentious wife; Sylvia Sidney, in her of her final performances, as Baldwin and Davis’ case-worker, making the most of a role that is really little more than a delicious sick joke; Glenn Shadix as an obnoxious interior designer§; and Dick Cavett as a blasé society snob. Danny Elfman composed one of his brightest early scores, which deftly incorporates some of Harry Belafonte’s calypso hits. The first time I saw Beetlejuice, the use of “Day-O” offended me; now that sequence strikes me as one of the happiest in the picture. That’s one of the perks of revisiting old movies: Realizing that it wasn’t the original, uncategorizable, picture that was to blame for your dismissal of it, and being happy that you’ve lived to become a person who can surrender himself to it.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n§ Although Shadix’s performance struck me at the time as an exercise in extreme stereotype, the actor was himself gay.\n\nThe Seven-Per-Cent Solution (1976) Nicholas Meyer’s ingenious Sherlock Holmes pastiche.\n\nBlackbeard’s Ghost (1968) I don’t know how I missed this one when it was released, as I habitually saw every new (or newly reissued) Disney movie, animated or live-action. It’s just possible it didn’t make it to the small Ohio town we were living in then, although every other children’s movie of the time did. In any case, I only discovered it when I came across the Disneyland soundtrack album — receiving the record for Christmas of 1970, I nearly wore it out through re-playing. It was my introduction to Peter Ustinov, who narrated it, and who starred as Blackbeard; the LP featured dialogue, mostly between him and Dean Jones, with a little Suzanne Pleshette shoehorned in, and I was entranced by Ustinov’s idiosyncratic way with a funny line, his ineffable charm, and (to borrow a phrase from Harlan Ellison in a different context) the “ineluctable rodomontade” of his florid verbiage. As I grew older and became more familiar with Ustinov, and with his performances and his work as a playwright and screenwriter, I began to suspect that he had re-written the Blackbeard script (or at least, his lines) as he had on Spartacus. And if you love Ustinov as I do, Blackbeard’s Ghost, while silly, generates a lot of laughter.\n\nAlthough basing their screenplay on a very good children’s novel by Ben Stahl, in which two boys accidentally conjure up the shade of the pirate, still very much the bloodthirsty ghoul of legend, the movie’s writers (Don Da Gradi and Bill Walsh) ditched that premise in favor of pure comedy, making this far tamer Blackbeard’s more-than-reluctant compatriot the new coach of a hopeless college track team. That the coach is played by Jones is a help; whatever criticisms might be levied at the Disney pictures in which he starred, the actor (on whom I had a slight childish crush) always brought enormous conviction to them, and his outbursts of incredulous anger are as ingratiating as the engaging grin that occasionally splits his handsome face. The slapstick in the picture, directed with no special distinction by Robert Stevenson, is sometimes dopey and occasionally better than that, and the invisibility effects by Eustace Lycett and Robert A. Mattey are, as usual with Disney, well done, as are the lovely background matte paintings by Peter Ellenshaw. The screenplay has a pleasing lightness, enriched by what I again assume were Ustinov’s additions. The laughter the Disney Blu-Ray drew from me was considerable, even if nearly all of it was generated by Ustinov, who still makes me roar at lines I memorized off that record album when I was nine. Although Elliott Reid overdoes his bit as a television sportscaster, Pleshette is, as always, simultaneously biting and adorable as Jones’ inamorata; Joby Baker makes a good showing in the unaccustomed role of the villain; Elsa Lanchester gets a good scene or two as Jones’ dotty landlady; Richard Deacon is amusingly dry as the college dean; and Herbie Faye, Ned Glass, Alan Carney and Gil Lamb all have good bits in Baker’s restaurant-cum-gambling den. The plot revolves in large part around Blackbeard’s old home, maintained as an hotel by his descendants, little old ladies with nothing else to cling to. I mention this because one of them — and I have no idea which — is identified on the imdb as Betty Bronson. That’s a name more forgotten now than it was 50 years ago, but 45 years before, that Bronson was enchanting youngsters as the screen’s first Peter Pan. I would like to think that Walt Disney, one of whose final productions Blackbeard’s Ghost was, knew that, and gave the old trouper a job. Anyway, it would be pretty to think so.\n\nInto the Woods (2014) Although I have been a Sondheim fanatic since discovering the Company cast album in 1976, and while the original production of Into the Woods was the first Broadway musical I saw before its cast recording had been released, I deliberately avoided the movie of it when it was new, on the basis of two proper names with which it was associated: Disney, and Rob Marshall. Perhaps only in Hollywood could a minimally talented hack like Rob Marshall reap such rewards (and a-wards) by removing the guts from ballsy musical plays like Chicago and Nine. After countless producers and screenwriters, including Larry Gelbart, had worked at it, what was Marshall’s great “break-through” on Chicago? Turning all the musical numbers into dream-fantasies Renee Zellweger imagines. If you have to justify why people are singing and dancing in a musical, why the fuck are you making a musical? Still, with a screenplay by James Lapine, the original book writer and director of Into the Woods, perhaps there was only so much damage Marshall could do to it. Well, it was someone’s brilliant idea to cast the magnificent Simon Russell Beale as the Baker’s Father and then butcher his role so completely he’s left with no songs and only a couple of lines, confusingly delivered, since we can’t tell who he is, whether he’s real or a phantom, and haven’t any idea whether his son (James Corden) knows either; and to let Chris Pine as an 18th century prince sport a trendy two-day growth of beard on his chin.‖ The picture looks splendid, which I attribute largely to its cinematographer (Dion Beebe), set decorator (Anna Pinnock), costumer (Colleen Atwood) and production designer (Dennis Gassner). And it’s largely well cast, with actors who can sing: Corden; Meryl Streep, sardonic but subdued as The Witch; lovely Emily Blunt as The Baker’s Wife; cute Daniel Huttlestone as a full-throated Jack; Lilla Crawford as a foghorn-voiced Little Red Riding Hood; Johnny Depp as her Wolf; Tracey Ullman as Jack’s Mother; and Anna Kendrick who, although attractive only from a single angle… and that one her director seldom favors… is an otherwise charming and effective Cinderella. Into the Woods was significantly better than I’d expected. Yet I still tremble whenever I hear another name yoked with this director’s: Follies. Hasn’t that poor show suffered enough?\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n‖As my friend Eliot M. Camarena once asked, do people like that when they’re children announce, “When I grow up, I wanna look like Fred C. Dobbs!”?\n\nThe Art of Love (1965) A surprisingly brainless affair to have come from the typewriter of the witty Carl Reiner, riding high in 1965 with the deserved success of “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” which he created and oversaw, and for which he wrote many of the most memorable early episodes. The best thing about this moderately black farce concerning a failed American artist in Paris whose supposed suicide instantly drives up the prices fetched for his work by his duplicitous best friend (James Garner) is Van Dyke as the artist. His comedic timing, seemingly boneless body and inimitable way with a line or a situation are the equal of the great comedians he worshiped, and it’s one of the ironies of modern history that he came along at a time when movie and television comedies were so often loud, witless and inane. Had Blake Edwards not already collared Peter Sellers and Jack Lemmon, what a find Van Dyke would have been for that fellow student of slapstick!\n\nReiner can’t really be blamed for the general dopiness of the movie, since he was working from an existing story by two other writers (Alan Simmons and William Sackheim) and the movie’s young director, Norman Jewison, doesn’t appear to have been a great deal of help to him. The Art of Love is attractive to look at — it was shot by Russell Metty — but inert, marking time with things like Angie Dickinson’s fainting shtick (it’s funny the first time), Elke Sommers’ perpetual innocent act and the braying of Ethel Merman, apparently cast as a madam just so she could belt out an instantly forgettable nightclub number. The usually ingratiating Garner has little to play here but his character’s cheesy self-centeredness, and Reiner stoops to such things as plunking a cartoon Brooklynite Yiddishe couple (Irving Jacobson and Naomi Stevens) in the middle of Paris. Still, Jay Novello has a couple of funny bits as a nervous janitor and little Pierre Olaf does miracle work as an umbrella-toting police detective, Cy Coleman provided a perky score (with additional music by Frank Skinner), and DePatie-Freleng came up with some modestly amusing main title animation. There’s little excuse, however, for a comedy — especially one with Dick Van Dyke — whose only big laugh comes at the very end, and absolutely none for its indulging in such feeble wheezes as the periodic introduction of a Madame Defarge-like hag, complete with knitting needles, who shows up every now and then to screech her delight at Garner’s impending execution. But at least I now understand what my mother meant when she once told me that after seeing this one on television when I was a boy I walked around the house for a week saying, “Guillotine! Guillotine!”\n\nMurder by Decree (1978) That Sherlock Holmes occupied a revered, albeit fictional, place in the same late Victorian Britain that saw the appalling murders in Whitechapel has intrigued Sherlockians for decades. What more natural meeting could there be than between Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s brilliant consulting detective and “Saucy Jacky,” as that figure of horror known popularly as Jack the Ripper styled himself in a letter to the papers? Derek Ford and Donald Ford (the former known primarily for his snickering sex comedies) imagined Holmes investigating the murders in the 1965 A Study in Terror, and the same year in which this more recent attempt was released saw the publication of Michael Didbin’s dark little novel The Last Sherlock Holmes Story, very much concerned with Jack. The elements are there even in the mind’s eye: The dimly gaslit cobblestone streets, the hansom cabs and private cabriolets, the enveloping fog that swallows up forms, faces and screams of terror and pain. That Bob Clark, the onlie begettor of Porky’s should, of all people, have directed as beautiful a fiction as Murder by Decree is as puzzling as his making that evocative adaptation of Jean Shepherd, A Christmas Story. But then, as Orson Welles once told Bogdanovich, “Peter, you only need one.”\n\nThe literate screenplay by the playwright John Hopkins emphasizes a more riant, and more passionate, Holmes than is the norm, and Christopher Plummer could scarcely be bettered in the role as the filmmakers, if not Conan Doyle, conceived it. His performance reaches two peaks, one infinitely quiet (his reaction to Geneviève Bujold’s heartbreaking madwoman), the other bristling with outrage at what his betters (including John Gielgud as the Prime Minister, unidentified in the picture but clearly made up to resemble Robert Gascoyne-Cecil) have been up to. Hopkins also, blessedly, gives us a Watson who is as far from the Nigel Bruce model as can be imagined. And while the irreplaceable James Mason is a bit hoary for the role, his aplomb is undeniable; a moment of especial charm is the way he expresses dismay at Holmes, and with a look of genuine hurt, when the former squashes the lone pea on the doctor’s plate. And if he is occasionally the voice of hidebound Empire, Mason’s (and Hopkins’) Watson is also equally as capable of wit as Holmes as, for example, when Sherlock asks his compatriot why his friend deems him only “the prince of detectives” and wishes to know who is king. I won’t spoil the joke here, nor the conclusion of this intricately plotted exercise, based on some theories by Elwyn Jones and John Lloyd in their contemporaneous book The Ripper File.\n\nThe exceptional cast includes a starchily smug and imperious Gielgud; the wrenching Bujold; Frank Finlay as an uncharacteristically deferential Inspector Lestrade; David Hemmings as the police inspector in charge of the case (and who bears absolutely no relationship to the very real Frederick Abberline); Susan Clark as a heartrending Mary Kelly; Anthony Quayle as the dangerously reactionary Sir Charles Warren; Peter Jonfield as a chillingly psychotic chief villain; and Donald Sutherland as the shaken spiritualist Robert Lees, who believes he’s seen the Ripper. Despite a few unnecessary visual flourishes, Clark’s eye is nearly unerring, abetted to an exceptional degree by the rich and expressive cinematography by Reginald H. Morris and the astonishing production design of Harry Pottle; I don’t know whether Pottle is responsible for the staggeringly effective matte paintings of London used in the picture, but whoever painted them, they put you absolutely there. The only real miscalculation in the movie is the highly derivative musical score by Paul Zaza and Carl Zittrer from which I heard distinct liftings from John Williams (the scene in Jaws of Richard Dreyfus investigating Ben Gardner’s boat), Jerry Goldsmith and Bernard Herrmann (those eerie strings) and Richard Rodney Bennett (the opening sequence of Murder on the Orient Express) and in which — aside from the plaintive traditional Irish tune for Mary Kelly — there is little that is either original, interesting, useful or pleasing to the ear.\n\nText copyright 2019 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nWhom the gods would destroy they first make wildly successful. For all his astonishing early success in theatre and on radio — and despite his self-evident greatness as a filmmaker — Orson Welles was never able to create a popular movie, usually through no fault of his own. Touch in Evil is a case in point: What should have been at the very least a minor hit never really had a hope, re-edited (and, to a degree, re-shot) as it was by hacks and unceremoniously dumped onto the “B” market by Universal when the studio apparently lost all faith in the picture. Welles, having returned from self-exile in Europe, and making waves in other people’s pictures (The Long, Hot Summer and Huston’s Moby-Dick) and television shows (he was a memorable guest on “I Love Lucy”) was primed for a chance at the brass ring, and even in a form both truncated and fattened by others, Touch of Evil should, ideally, have been the carousel horse he needed to reach it. The source, a Whit Masterson* mystery called Badge of Evil, is mildly diverting but not especially resonant, or even particularly memorable. (I had to read a precis to even recall the plot.) But as Welles re-shaped and re-fashioned it, this inconsequential pulp material becomes something dark, disturbing and, yes, even profound.\n\nIt looks unlike any other director’s work, and sounds unlike any other’s. I do not mean the overlapping dialogue or the fealty to ambient sound, although both are hallmarks of Welles, but the shape and flavor of his dialogue, as when Charlton Heston’s “Mike” Vargas says to Welles’ corrupt police captain Hank Quinlan, “A policeman’s job is only easy in a police state.” (He should have lived to see how well that has worked out in America.) Far more than things like the somewhat showy opening sequence, the characteristic shadows or the menacing camera angles, what distinguishes this as a Welles picture are its concerns, and the means by which the filmmaker explicates, and expounds on, them. In Badge of Evil, an assistant D.A. ponders a killing and a seemingly false confession, and his Latin wife is kidnapped, drugged and framed by his enemies. There’s also a climax involving a hidden wire recorder and a cop called Quinlan who is at the same time a thug, a dupe and a bit of a dope. The basic elements are there, but arranged conventionally. Welles, by making the suspicious municipal attorney (Heston) a Mexican with a Caucasian wife (Janet Leigh), gets instantly to the heart of American racism, which traditionally has looked with horror on dusky bucks squiring lily-white does; he then further compounds this sense of unease by having Quinlan harass and then arrest a young Mexican suspect (Victor Millan), who is later proven to be guilty. My revealing that is not exactly what they now (excessively, to my mind) call a spoiler; with Welles, narrative detail is scarcely the point. It is less important that the boy is guilty than that he was framed to begin with, and that in trying to coerce from Quinlan a confession for the frame-up Vargas descends to the worst sort of legal maneuvering, convincing Quinlan’s hero-worshiping partner (Joseph Calleia) to betray the man electronically. And Vargas quite literally descends, hiding under a bridge and sloshing through oily, trash-laden waters as he follows his quarry. Welles’ sympathies as a writer-director are divided: Vargas is right… but so is Quinlan. And each is equally wrong. As Welles told Peter Bogdanovich, “I don’t make those judgments, ever, about people in my pictures.” He didn’t paint Charles Foster Kane with a black-tarred brush either. Much more than “arty” camera angles and creative editing, it’s that very ambiguity, which seems to upset many literal people, that ultimately make Welles’ movies so exhilarating. As Marlene Dietrich’s Tana observes of Quinlan at the end of the picture, “He was some kind of a man. What does it matter what you say about people?”\n\nThe preferred version of Touch of Evil is the one re-edited by Walter Murch in 1998 and based largely on a 58-page memo Welles famously prepared when Universal showed him their edit… although even this edition contains some footage Welles did not shoot but which Murch needed for continuity. Appropriately for a man who made his mark as a sound editor, Murch’s great contribution to the restoration was his removing Henry Mancini’s conventional (albeit effective) “thriller” scoring from the opening sequence in favor of the more ambient sound Welles imagined, and which also contained snippets of several Mancini rock and jazz pieces, heard as they would be if an automobile was cruising a border-town’s streets and passing its many clip-joints. (Murch also took the distracting credits off the sequence and placed them at the end of the picture.) That opening, so beloved of cineastes, consisting as it does of three and a half unbroken minutes of tracking shot, while admittedly a tour de force, is to me far less impressive than the much longer, more complex, and more beautifully controlled, scene in the apartment of the accused which is also without a cut and twice as long.† Yet because it is less flashy, it goes unnoticed by most image-junkies and Scorsese acolytes. (Or am I being redundant?) Only once does Welles, who hated symbols, opt for an obvious metaphor, when the crippled, ageing, bibulous and nearly played-out Quinlan is glimpsed beneath a mounted bull’s head decorated with picadors’ lances. As Welles noted to Bogdanovich of a moment in his Othello involving Iago, “It’s instant metaphor, like instant coffee.” And we all know what instant coffee is good for.\n\nThose who for their own perverse reasons like to pretend Welles was no writer (by which accusation I presume they mean Herman Mankiewiciz didn’t just write Citizen Kane but everything else) never get what an original dramatic voice he had. There is nothing, but nothing, in the Masterson book that corresponds to Vargas’ American wife or to the two-bit gangster Grandi who menaces her, and certainly no dialogue that rivals theirs. Although frightened of this absurd little toupée-sporting hoodlum, she tells him he’s seen too many gangster movies, and he has. Welles said he got that notion from having encountered gangsters, whom he found both menacing and funny, as Grandi is; perhaps no one could have embodied those seeming contradictions better than the splendid Akim Tamiroff, whose scenes in Touch of Evil lift the picture into a realm it wouldn’t achieve without him, just as he lifted Welles’ Mr. Arkadin and as Dennis Weaver raises the role of the terrified motel night manager here into another form of reality. Leigh somehow managed to appear in a trio of indelible roles in important pictures during this period, and to enrich all three beyond the telling. (The others are The Manchurian Candidate and Psycho.) Her armor includes sex, wit, understanding, a sharpness that camouflages but does not obscure her vulnerability, and the ability to move the viewer unexpectedly. She’d have been the ideal leading lady for Howard Hawks, and I’ve often wondered why he never cast her in anything.\n\nHeston is rather good, although he more or less eschews any sort of accent. I remember being infuriated by the scene in Tim Burton’s appallingly overrated Ed Wood in which Vincent D’Onofrio as Welles (although voiced by Maurice LeMarche) complains bitterly of having to use the actor in his picture, which struck me then and strikes me now as a bit of ignorant snark by the screenwriters,‡ trendily directed toward an admittedly vulnerable target. Whether the story Welles later told of Heston’s inadvertently getting him the job of directing Touch of Evil is true or not — he was allegedly engaged to write and appear in it, until the actor, misunderstanding, said he would be honored to be in anything Orson Welles directed — Welles had nothing but praise for Heston subsequently. Well, what can one expect of people who deify a sub-nonentity like Ed Wood for being utterly without talent and trying anyway?\n\nWelles, who gave a funny mock-Method performance for Martin Ritt in The Long, Hot Summer, blustering in mumbles, if I may be permitted an oxymoron, does something similar here, but to better effect because the character of Quinlan is such a human wreck, and so used to getting his way, he no longer needs to speak distinctly. Viewers of the movie today probably assume that Quinlan’s massive body was simply Welles’ usual heft, but he was well padded in face and physique. (He later told Bogdanovich a very funny anecdote about showing up at a Hollywood party before taking off his makeup and being greeted by old friends with, “Hi, Orson, you’re lookin’ great!”) Despite its obviousness, the metaphor of the bull is not inapt; although hobbled by a limp and too much candy-induced fat, there is still power in Hank Quinlan that goes well beyond the official badge of his office. You can imagine the force he’d been, just as you occasionally catch a glimpse of the rogue who once captured Tana’s heart — or who shared her bed, in any case.\n\nAlthough they had relaxed considerably between Welles’ exit to Europe in the late ’40s and his return a decade later, things were hardly free and open in America yet. The Catholic-controlled Production Code was still fully in place, if slightly more flexible than it had been, and it’s rather astonishing how much Welles got away with here, from Janet Leigh’s firmly pointed slip to the butch Lesbian played by a disguised Mercedes McCambridge (“I want to watch…”) to the implications of gang-rape by Grandi’s young hoods at the motel, even if what transpires is an only slightly less traumatizing introduction of narcotics. When Hank visits Tana’s establishment across the Mexican border, the only assumption we can make is that it’s a house of prostitution, lending a frisson of the forbidden to this exchange between the two:\n\nQuinlan: Well, when this case is over, I’ll come around some night and sample some\n\nof your chili.\n\nTana: Better be careful. May be too hot for you.\n\nThat Dietrich delivers that line with such bland nonchalance I suppose mitigates the salaciousness of it, but any reasonably intelligent adolescent can read between those lines.\n\nIt goes without saying that Tana does not exist in Badge of Evil, and, Welles maintained, not in the original script he adapted. “I only thought up the character,” he told Bogdanovich, “if I could get Marlene. Otherwise, no such character, no such scenes.” Bogdanovich feels Dietrich brings a quality to the picture that is “absolutely cosmic,” that “she becomes a kind of mythic figure in the film,” and it’s hard to disagree. The presence of Tana reminds us that Quinlan, so easily pegged as a villain and (as she later notes) “a lousy cop,” is human, and once mattered to someone. But beyond that, Dietrich almost seems to be summing up everything she’s ever done or been on the screen, from Morocco to Witness for the Prosecution: The cool sultriness, the misterioso, the Continental wisdom, and the sexiness that emanates from her seemingly without effort. When she looks at Quinlan’s floating body at the end, Dietrich’s eyes are both expressive and unreadable, rendering those final lines of hers as more than an epitaph for a movie corpse: They become seeds of wisdom from the earth mother.\n\nTouch of Evil also benefits from Welles’ appreciation of old actors and old friends, and from his ability to spot something untouched in younger performers. His use of Joseph Calleia, for example, and of Ray Collins (as the D.A.) and Joseph Cotten (as the coroner, although at least one of his lines — “Now you could strain him through a sieve” — was dubbed by Welles) but most especially in his casting of Weaver as the motel night manager who is not merely nervous but psychotic. It’s the sort of role, at that time, perhaps only Welles could have envisioned, and he lets Weaver run with it.\n\nThere’s probably a great deal more I might say, about Russell Metty’s striking black-and-white cinematography and Mancini’s effective score, which reaches a kind of glory with his pianola theme for Dietrich. But ultimately it’s Orson’s show, and that either sells it for you, or sends you packing. I will, however, say this: Welles’ last studio picture as a writer-director looks better with every passing year.\n\nIf the elegant hacks whose offerings currently hold sway at the multiplexes had the capacity for embarrassment, a picture like Touch of Evil would thoroughly shame them.\n\n*“Whit Masterson” was the pen-name of Robert Allison “Bob” Wade and H. Bill Miller. Their second best-remembered title? Kitten with a Whip.\n\n†There are actually two long sequences done in single takes, divided by a cutaway to another set of necessary scenes.\n\n‡Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski.\n\nText copyright 2019 by Scott Ross\n\n“… everything as I see it is against him before he starts, but his courage, like everything else about him, egotism, generosity, ruthlessness, forbearance, impatience, sensitivity, grossness and vision, is magnificently out of proportion.” — Micheál Mac Liammóir on Orson Welles, Put Money in Thy Purse: The Filming of Othello.\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\n6 May 2015 marks the centenary of the birth of George Orson Welles. I doubt there’s much, if anything, I can add concerning this essential American figure that others have not already observed — those who knew him and those — the lists intermingle — who have illuminated Welles’ importance by examining the contours both of his existence and the many arts to which he gave life, and in the service of which he imbued so much and received so appallingly little.* But in this life, one has touchstones: Those figures who serve as inspirations, whose artistry touches one in ways that may defy cold analysis but whose lives and work simply matter. In my own case, there are three such artists. Tennessee Williams is one, Louis Armstrong another. Orson Welles completes the trinity. What grips me about Welles, aside from his accomplishments, which are self-evident (or should be but all too often, to the ignorant, are not) is how deeply he strove; how much adversity he faced, and how often; how high — despite all odds, and systems, and limitations — he aspired; and what altitudes, with all possible decks stacked against him, he so often obtained.\n\n“I started at the top and worked down.” — Orson Welles, F for Fake\n\nI will not rehearse here the early triumphs, save to note that Welles started big; not merely in his theatre and radio successes, at an absurdly early age, but in the profession into which he stumbled, he said, out of necessity. Broke at 16, in Ireland where he’d gone to paint for the summer and desperate to avoid college in the United States, he presented himself at Dublin’s Gate Theatre as a noted American actor who, at liberty, would condescend to perform for these Hibernian provincials if they had any leading roles going begging. Micheál Mac Liammóir, who with his work (and life) partner Hilton Edwards founded and managed the Gate, later claims to have seen through this charade, but the young Welles must have had something aside from his youth, height, bass baritone and oddly comely features (the latter accentuated by a rather sensual lower lip) for engage him they did, giving Welles an entrée in American theatre, courtesy of his Irish clippings. (He was far from stumbling into acting, however, for the theatre had been an important part of his life since at least early adolescence.)\n\nAt 24 he was on the cover of Time; at 25 the achiever of national — indeed, international — notoriety as the progenitor of a radio “hoax” that allegedly scared a chunk of a nation already made edgy by the rise of militant Fascism in Europe, nearly to death (see Brad A. Schwartz’s book Broadcast Hysteria for a through de-bunking of the myth); and at 26 in Hollywood, where, with much of his Mercury staff, he was about to make what for many years was called (by those who actually saw it) the greatest of all American movies.\n\nBy 27, he was, on the face of it, close to a has-been.\n\nThat, at least, is the legend — or part of it, anyway. “What has he done since Citizen Kane?” was the cry, one which, with a slight variation in tense, has been the cry ever since. That legend, of course, omits two very important factors, the first of which is that there even was a Kane against which to compare the remainder of Welles’ career. (And what did you do at 26?) The second is that he never stopped manufacturing wonders. Even if, as is my case, you don’t consider Kane the greatest of all movies — and I don’t know that anyone can make that distinction, for any picture — there is (if often in final forms that altered their maker’s vision, and even meaning) The Magnificent Ambersons, The Lady from Shanghai, Macbeth, Othello, Mr. Arkadin, Touch of Evil, Chimes at Midnight and F for Fake… not to mention his marvelously theatrical play Moby-Dick — Rehearsed, his fabled “home movie” The Other Side of the Wind, and all those acting jobs, some of them (The Long, Hot Summer; Compulsion, A Man for All Seasons) sublime, which he performed to keep the whole floating opera going. It was customary, during his later years, to chortle derisively, both at his commercial appearances for television and at the aging fat man himself, and that attitude, sadly, still obtains. Recently, in an online discussion of F for Fake, one especially pompous fool I knew slightly in college (and in which setting he was the same, merely younger) chimed in, snottily, with, “And then he sold no wine before its time.” And this man makes his living writing about movies.\n\nHere, let us add a third factor (and perhaps a fourth), one carefully and, I am convinced, deliberately, omitted from the usual discussion of Orson Welles: He was among the most radical of all filmmakers, domestic or foreign; and the means by which he operated were no less radical. Oja Kodar, the woman with whom Welles collaborated in life and in art during the last two decades and more of his life — and who was often, and even as recently as last year, condescendingly described in the press with the demeaning epithet “Welles’ girlfriend” — has often said that his life was a struggle against gravity. Gravity not merely as a force weighting down the spirit and the imagination, but keeping earth-bound too the available modes of expressing them. Film, for an artist, is the most unwieldy of canvasses, and the most expensive. Ironically, the collapse of the studios that could not contain, and did not care to employ, him, was a boon for just about every independent in the business except Welles. (Another fierce and iconoclastic independent, Samuel Fuller, had similar problems.)\n\nAs we are all either the beneficiaries or the victims of our times, so too was Welles. He was wed to film, to those costly spools of celluloid that had, first, to be purchased, then exposed, then developed, then edited, duplicated, dubbed and distributed. Were he operating now, with all the many and various digital technologies at his command, half the battles he waged just to work would be virtually (no pun intended) eliminated. He would surely have been entranced by the freeing possibilities, and would, I have no doubt, have exploited them more ingeniously, and with greater wit and compassion, than anyone else around.\n\n“I think I made essentially a mistake in staying in movies but it’s a mistake I can’t regret because it’s like saying I shouldn’t have stayed married to that woman but I did because I love her. I would have been more successful if I hadn’t been married to her, you know. I would have been more successful if I’d left movies immediately, stayed in the theatre, gone into politics, written, anything. I’ve wasted a greater part of my life looking for money and trying to get along, trying to make my work from this terribly expensive paintbox which is a movie. And I’ve spent too much energy on things that have nothing to do with making a movie. It’s about two percent movie-making and ninety-eight percent hustling. It’s no way to spend a life.” — Orson Welles, 1982\n\nThose who know Welles’ work only casually often maintain that his later years were “sad.” For we measure the movie artist in those expensive reels of film, and after F for Fake — itself so misunderstood and under-appreciated that the critical fraternity of the time ought, by rights, be called to account — there were no more. That we saw. And there’s, as they say, the rub. What the tut-tutters, both in sorrow and in derision, never know nor understand about Orson Welles is that, while he was deeply frustrated, which is indeed sad, he never stopped working on his own projects, which is not. And that is a mark not only of Welles’ restless prodigiousness, and his seriousness of purpose, but of how much he accomplished. Whether the results of Welles’ efforts were exhibited, or even completed, is of less importance, ultimately, than the fact that they existed at all — that they were.\n\nIf we look at Citizen Kane, not as the greatest, or even Welles’ greatest, but simply in its historical context, and if we know anything at all about the techniques then in vogue — and in danger of becoming ossified — in talking pictures, we can appreciate it for what it was, and for what Welles brought to the medium: The exuberance of a young man who did not understand the established rules, and who questioned why this or that had to be done, and why it might not be done differently, and for whom his RKO contract, the subject of much envious teeth-gnashing by others, permitted his innocent, and joyous, expansion of the existing vocabulary. For it is that giddy experimentation, augmented to the utmost by Welles having the great good fortune of a collaboration with its cinematographer Gregg Toland, which makes Kane such a pleasure to watch.\n\nThere is more to the movie than photographic innovation, however. There is, too, its aural perfection — its position as the first great feature by one of radio’s most significant practitioners. Pick almost any moment, at random, in Kane and recall what’s happening on the soundtrack; Welles not only affected the way talkies looked, but the way they could sound. Yet beyond that, too, is the screenplay, with its unusual, fragmented, structure, its use of the tropes of the medium (the March of Time newsreels in particular) and its lively admixture of history, comedy, melodrama and something dangerously close to real (and specifically American) tragedy. Pauline Kael called Kane “a shallow masterpiece,” and she had a point. Its swift (if not Swiftian) satire, its pell-mell early pace, its occasional caricature, all give the picture a certain insubstantial air. However, the dredged-up memories of its characters, which reveal, in the aggregate, a far more complex central figure that was the norm, add depth to the characterization of Charles Foster Kane, and to those who surround him. Welles’ original conception was, he said, more like the later Rashomon, in that Kane “would seem to be a very different character depending on who was talking,” whereas in the final version he was rendered less extreme, and more ambiguous. It is this very ambiguity that is a hallmark of Orson Welles’ cinema, observable in all of his best work, and which, along with a few other consistent themes and appurtenances, gives the lie to the old canard that Welles had no hand — or, if he did, a small, editorial one — in the crafting of Kane’s screenplay.\n\n“I am a writer-director — with an emphasis on the former.” — Orson Welles\n\nKael, of course, did more to roil those waters than anyone, and it must have galled Welles to see the Kane script in book form forever wedded to the essay in which Kael “proves” he didn’t write it. (Just as it would pain him, as it does many of us, to endure Time-Warner yoking all its home video editions of Kane with a spurious documentary, The Battle Over “Citizen Kane.”) That Herman Mankiewicz had a hand in the picture’s creation is not debatable. And whether Welles wrote most of it, or only some of it, is less to the point than that he was — until his late collaborations with Oja Kodar, anyway — the sole author of every subsequent movie he directed, with the notable exception of The Stranger.† Do the anti-Wellesians think he somehow pulled it over on everyone (not least of all, himself) for the rest of his life, or that, as absurdly, he miraculously sprouted a scenarist’s wings, only after Mankiewicz “wrote” Kane? The thematic concerns in Kane — with loneliness, loss, old age, betrayal, corruption and political engagement — are manifest in nearly all of Welles’ subsequent endeavors; indeed, they run throughout his oeuvre as a writer-director, as keenly as deception runs through Billy Wilder’s pictures and group failures inform John Huston’s. Did Mankiewicz somehow magically implant Welles’ recurrent concerns as well?\n\nMoreover, the shape of many of the lines and speeches in Kane, the give and take of its arguments and colloquies, the wit and eloquence (even elegance) of the expression likewise reflect the writer Welles was as much as the look of Kane reflects his directorial flourishes, begun on the stage. One sees, and hears, their corollaries in The Lady from Shanghai, in Mr. Arkadin, in Touch of Evil, in F for Fake and, especially, in the un-filmed (by Welles) The Big Brass Ring. For Welles was a writer; he wrote a plethora of newspaper and magazine columns, radio (and later, television) broadcasts, and plays, in addition to his screenwriting forays, so to imagine him as somehow not responsible for a good portion of the writing of his single great critical success is patently absurd, if not downright invidious. Yet Simon Callow, Welles’ curiously — and in some respects, militantly — antipathetic biographer, baldly states, “Orson Welles did not write one word of Citizen Kane”… and ignoramus public radio interviewers in America let him get away with it.\n\nWelles’ eloquence may owe something to his upbringing, particularly since he had no formal schooling after the age of 16. He was an aristocrat, and I think that shows in his movies as it did in the particulars of his life; for all the economic struggle that dogged his filmmaking, he clearly enjoyed a high standard of living. That background is evident too, I think, in some of his attitudes to others. Despite his leftist politics (and for all that Hearst papers and the FBI enjoyed labeling him a Communist) there was a streak of well-heeled moralism in him at times; I think I detect a little of Welles in Charles Foster Kane’s self-righteous riposte to his guardian, “If I don’t defend the interests of the underprivileged, somebody else will — maybe somebody without any money or property, and that would be too bad.” Certainly many of his attitudes were the furthest thing from enlightened; he expressed at times an appalling misogyny, in tandem with a fashionably sneering tone about homosexuals — coupled with a dismaying propensity for post-dubbing other actors with stereotyped “fag” voices. Perhaps it is those two, rather reactionary, strains that have in part led even some friendly commentators to detect a latency in Welles? Nothing, after all, succeeds like deflection.\n\nHis lack of formal education had its small defects, among them the propensity to mispronounce common terms: “Arch-type” for “archetype,” “antiquay” for “antique”… and Welles only knows why both Michael Redgrave and Robert Hardin pronounce the word telescope as “teleoscope” in Mr. Arkadin.\n\nWelles’ mother died when he was 9, his father when the boy was 15, and a deep subsequent sense of loss seems to have followed him; that emotion is a primary concern in his movies. Then too, there was his tendency toward egocentric self-aggrandizement, but even Kael granted that, when an artist has had so much taken from him, such attitudes are explicable, if not altogether laudable. That she wrote this in an essay aimed at taking even more credit from Welles is an irony about which Kael herself was, presumably, not conscious.\n\n“The absence of limitations is the enemy of art.” — Orson Welles\n\nThe ignorant are, perhaps naturally, all too ready to repeat mythology without bothering to learn anything about reality. And no one occasioned more speculation or accrued more ignorant adherents to his legend than Welles — as many now as when he was alive, if not more. “Oh, yes — Welles. Made Citizen Kane. Never did anything after that.” That this ignores Ambersons is perhaps understandable, given that the movie was mutilated by RKO while Welles was in South America, barely released to theatres, and at that with some 50 minutes of shorn footage either incinerated or dumped into the Pacific Ocean — in any case, irrevocably destroyed, beyond the hope of restoration.‡ Welles himself wanted, in the ‘60s, to re-shoot the climax, with Joseph Cotton and Agnes Moorehead (their respective ages at the time would have fit with his original conception) but could not persuade the rights holders of the efficacy of the project. Had the movie been released in anything like Welles’ initial, 140-minute cut, it would have easily bested, if not eclipsed, Kane in conception and achievement. (Jonathan Rosenbaum’s inclusion of the scripts for the deleted sequences, along with some on-set stills, in the essential 1992 book This is Orson Welles, makes that case more than amply.) That it is still a great picture, a masterpiece even in its extremely bastardized form (and with a risible ending not shot by Welles) is a testament to how great a movie Ambersons is. Yet I become quite literally physically ill every time I think of that deliberately annihilated footage, particularly what was lost of Moorehead’s performance, which, even truncated, is among the finest ever captured on film.\n\nThe “Nothing After Kane” school lives in willful ignorance of Welles’ other Hollywood projects of the time: Of The Stranger which, despite a somewhat perfunctory script (not by Welles, which makes the picture an anomaly in his filmography) contains some breathtaking sequences and, in the burlesque comic Billy House’s extended bit (and whose scenes Welles did write), one of the most delightful, if unheralded, supporting performances of the era; of Macbeth, made for pennies on Poverty Row, and on some occasionally cheesy sets yet despite this one of the richest of all Shakespearean transmigrations to film — brooding, stark and even terrifying; and of The Lady from Shanghai, with its extraordinary gallery of grotesques, from Everett Sloane’s paraplegic cuckold to Glen Anders’ wild ersatz suicide (“I was just doin’ a little taaarget practice…”) and a climax which, although spoiled by some cutting of Welles’ more extensive funhouse sequence and the addition of a bloodcurdlingly dreadful musical score, does include the brilliant hall of mirrors shoot-out that ends the picture.\n\nNot long after, in the late 1940s, Welles left America for Europe. I’ve long suspected he saw what was coming and beat it before he could be blacklisted, and in his essential What Ever Happened to Orson Welles? Joseph McBride reveals that Welles was indeed a target; his FBI file lists the usual “fellow traveler” stats. (He had also been subjected to one of those humiliating “unofficial clearance” interviews with the reactionary Hedda Hopper.) While his European budgets were curtailed — when not actually, as with Othello, nonexistent — and he was subject to terrible technical limitations, he still produced that ruminative, brief but sumptuous and disturbing tragedy, containing superb performances by himself as the Moor and by Mac Liammóir as Iago. Laurence Olivier’s Shakespeare movies got more press — and awards — than Welles’, and made more money, but I would argue that Orson’s Shakespeares are infinitely greater in the aggregate, even as they were far more limited in scope, and as their maker trimmed the texts to his own designs.§ Nothing Olivier did in that realm can touch, for instance, Welles’ Chimes at Midnight for breadth, visual poetry or sheer emotional heft.\n\nThe battle at Shrewsbury is unlike any such sequence I know in its uncompromisingly honest, and horrifying, depiction of mounted and hand-to-hand combat. And if it is hard to cotton on to Welles’ almost lovesick admiration for Falstaff (“Shakespeare’s good, pure man… the most completely good man in all drama”) it is equally difficult to suppress a shudder, and swallow past the lump in one’s throat, at Welles’ depiction of the old, fat knight’s banishment by Hal at the climax.\n\n“A maverick may go his own way but he doesn’t think that it’s the only way, or ever claim that it’s the best one, except maybe for himself.” — Orson Welles\n\nThe limitations imposed on Welles in his European exiles were two‑fold, and thorny. First, and partly because he had, usually through lack of funds, to shoot in real locations, Welles had to forego the excellence of Hollywood sound recording, and often shot silently, dubbing in the voices later, during the editing stage. (A standard practice in European cinema, especially in Italy.) And while he maintained that he would rather have a great image than a great reading, poor post‑dubbing robbed this acutely sound‑conscious filmmaker of one of the hallmarks of his artistry. When the synchronization is good, one scarcely notices it. When it is not so felicitous, one is naggingly, sometimes maddeningly, aware of it, a flaw that detracts even from so manifestly great a movie as Chimes at Midnight. As if Welles needed another stumbling‑block in his way; Shakespeare limits one’s audience enough to begin with. Even those, like Kael, who admired the movie on its release, felt that its technical flaws would likely sink its prospects. Worse, or at least more distractingly, Welles evinced a curiously self‑defeating tendency to dub other actors’ performances, and one is never not aware that, however disguised, it’s his famously distinctive timbre one is hearing. (That he so often dubbed these lines in lisping, deliberately — and, I think, maliciously — “faggy” tones, is an added hurdle to enjoyment.) Joseph McBride believes this aural lack forced Welles to be even more creative visually, but when you stack the sound of, say, Kane or Ambersons against that of Arkadin or Chimes at Midnight, the deficiencies are profound.\n\nSecond, Welles was hampered by the inavailability in Europe both of the crane that makes grand images possible, and the grips who operate it. While neither his visual acumen nor his innate ingenuity ever deserted him completely, and indeed, such sequences as Shrewsbury leave little to be further desired, one cannot but think how much richer his later pictures might be had he been less technically hamstrung. “I didn’t have to know about cutting until I got to Europe,” Welles told Peter Bogdanovich. He cut, sometimes too much, to compensate for his paucity of choices, and the rhythms, even in his best pictures of that period, are sometimes, unaccountably “off.” Of course, some of these movies (Arkadin, for instance) were taken out of Welles’ hands and re-cut, so it is entirely possible, if not probable, that what we perceive as faults in his editing may well be the work of other, less creditable, hands. Certainly this is the case with the Beatric"
