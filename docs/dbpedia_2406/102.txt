James Francis Gowin born 23 october 1803 to Mildred Jesson and Francis Gowin. Married 1833 to Catherine Branson in London and left on the ""warrior" for Sydney 13th March 1833 travelling as Mr and Mrs Garrick.Their first four children are registered in N.S.W as Gowin and the last four as Garrick. So between 1841 and 1842 they permanantly changed the name to Garrick. I am wondering if his real father was a Garrick as the parents married a year after his birth. Anyone solve the mystery for me?
