        "text": "Our data science, mathematics, and computer science program gives students the practical tools they need for advanced study and an increasing variety of careers, including computer programming, web design, and software engineering. Through internships, our students prepare for the ever-changing nature of technology and computer science while providing learning tools to succeed in today’s hi-tech world.\n\nCareer Pathways\n\nLake Forest College facilitates five career communities called Career Pathways to help students explore major/career options and position themselves for the internships that will help them to further prepare for productive and rewarding careers after graduation. Students from all majors can participate in the Career Pathways to shape their career goals alongside of their academic interests.\n\nSince math and computer science skills are needed in all industries, students most often select their career pathway based upon specialty areas they most enjoy.\n\nThe Business and Finance Pathway helps students understand how organizations function, which strengthens students’ capability to understand organizational structure and problems that need to be solved.\n\nStudents interested in working with non-profit organizations or regulatory affairs would likely be engaged in the Law and Public Service Pathway.\n\nStudents interested in multimedia design would join the Creative Arts and Communication Pathway.\n\nStudents seeking to analyze data for gene sequences would join the Science and Health Care Pathway.\n\nStudents can explore as many pathways as they’d like until they find their fit, and the Build Your Own Pathway can also serve as a home base.\n\nHere are common career options pursued by data science, mathematics, and computer science students:\n\nWeb developer\n\nApplications programmer\n\nSoftware engineer\n\nIT consultant\n\nImplementation specialist\n\nSecurity analyst\n\nActuarial scientist\n\nRisk management\n\nComputational science\n\nExplore the Career Pathways by participating in events, reading profiles of students’ and alumni experiences, and by joining a pathway (or two).
