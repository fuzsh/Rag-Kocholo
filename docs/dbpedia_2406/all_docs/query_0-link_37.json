        "text": "The Center for Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases (CVID), formerly known as the Arthropod-borne and Infectious Diseases Laboratory, is a longstanding multi-disciplinary research and training center within the Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology that serves as a cornerstone for infectious disease research and education at Colorado State University.\n\nCVID researchers have been successful in defining mechanisms of pathogen persistence and transmission, and developing new surveillance, control, and prevention strategies for vector-borne and emerging zoonotic diseases. World-class facilities, including BSL-3 laboratories and large insectary complexes, provides an outstanding scientific environment for researchers inside and outside CSU wanting to manipulate pathogens in vertebrate hosts and arthropod vectors. CVID investigators house one of the only bat breeding colonies for use in experimental research in bat-borne viral diseases.\n\nCVID projects range from local surveillance for COVID-19 and West Nile virus, to international field studies in various African and Central American countries. Research foci include chikingunya, dengue, malaria, Rift Valley fever, Zika virus, COVID-19, MERS, influenza, hantavirus disease and more.\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\nThe Center for Vector-borne Infectious Diseases welcomes individuals into our group because they are passionate, bright, hardworking and talented, while acknowledging the presence of systemic barriers that prevent equitable access to science. We value individuals of any age, culture, mental/physical ability, ethnicity, first generation status, familial status, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, sex, geographic background, marital status, national origin, race, religious and spiritual beliefs, socioeconomic status, veteran status, or different perspectives and ideologies.\n\nWe are passionate about building and sustaining a diverse, inclusive, and equitable working environment where everyone can thrive. We recognize individuals with different lived experiences widen the breadth of our scientific inquiry and approach to problem-solving, enhancing our scientific research and innovation.\n\nOur group is avowedly anti-racist, and stands committed to promoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion within CVID, our university, and our communities."
