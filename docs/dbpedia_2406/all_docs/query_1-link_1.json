        "text": "A native of Webster, South Dakota, and a graduate of the University of Michigan School of Medicine, Jim was proud of his Midwestern roots, and relished his annual summer road trip to the Black Hills and Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. He did his residency at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, specializing in orthopedic surgery and developing a specialty in sports-related injuries. Next stop was Seattle, where he founded the Sports Medicine Division at the University of Washington School of Medicine, served as the UW Huskies’ team physician, and lived on the Lake Union houseboat made famous by Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in Sleepless in Seattle. A young, enterprising, and media-savvy physician, Jim’s work caught the attention of the New York Times, who called him “the silent 13th man on the field behind the 11 players and coach.” However, new challenges and sunnier weather beckoned.\n\nIt was in the Bay Area and at Saint Francis that Jim truly made his life, his career, and his mark, forging deep and lasting friendships with colleagues, patients, and the community. He invested in making Saint Francis a world-class center for orthopedic excellence, founding the Center for Sports Medicine in 1979, the longest-running hospital-based athletic injury treatment program in the country. He was a stickler for amalgamating data on patient satisfaction, long before it became the norm, and was never shy or retiring about making his opinions known, particularly when they involved patient care, quality, technology, or governance.\n\nJim used his reputation and people skills to attract world-class talent to Saint Francis, including Victor Prieto, MD, who succeeded Jim as the Center’s Medical Director and who now serves as the Hospital’s Chief of Medicine. Jim’s larger-than-life personality was a staple for decades in the Hospital and Foundation Board rooms, and his leadership was central to the 2009 opening of the state-of-the-art Center for Sports Medicine on the 11th Floor, which is named in his honor. Jim served as chair of the Saint Francis Foundation from 2014-2015.\n\nJim loved a good party, and nothing more than celebrating with friends over dinner and a nice glass of wine. With that in mind, the Foundation will honor Jim at this year’s Hob Nob, a San Francisco holiday tradition since 1989, and one that he never missed. We look forward to sharing memories and celebrating Jim’s extraordinary life and contributions to Saint Francis on December 3 at 7 p.m. Please join us."
