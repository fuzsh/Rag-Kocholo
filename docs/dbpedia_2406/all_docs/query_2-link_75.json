        "text": "As the 10 Formula One teams begin the annual summer shutdown and put down their tools for a couple of weeks, all will be going through a period of reflection and review.\n\nThe opening act of F1 2024 has been unpredictable and dramatic, both on and off the track. Following a year of Max Verstappen and Red Bull domination, to already have seven different winners across four teams has been refreshing for the sport as a whole, as much as Red Bull may have wanted last year’s status quo to last a little longer.\n\nThere have been some big swings in F1’s pecking order compared to this time 12 months ago. But which teams have impressed the most and who has room for improvement when class resumes at Zandvoort later this month?\n\nHere’s our set of report cards for the season so far. As always, let us know your thoughts in the comments section at the bottom.\n\n(Lead image: Mario Renzi - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images, Rudy Carezzevoli/Getty Images; Design: Eamonn Dalton/The Athletic)"
