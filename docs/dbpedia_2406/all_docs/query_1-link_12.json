        "text": "Eileen Christine Garrick OBITUARY\n\nEILEEN CHRISTINE (CHRIS) GARRICK Died at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital on February 13, 2004 after a six-year battle with breast cancer. Enduring surgery, radiation therapy, and multiple bouts of chemotherapy, her faith, optimism, and wonderful spirit never wavered. Eileen Christine Garrick was born January 12, 1941, the second of seven children of Richard and Lorena Wenzl. She was born on a farm adjacent to the original homestead of her great-grandfather near the town of Steinauer, Nebraska. She started her education in a one-room rural school, later moving to Wymore, Nebraska, where she completed high school. In high school, she played clarinet in the band, was a class officer, cheerleader, and homecoming royalty. After completing high school, she moved to Lincoln, Nebraska, and worked for Security Mutual Life Insurance until she was old enough to apply to United Airlines Flight Attendant School. For the next six years, she flew for United, traveling to five continents on her vacations. On her last airline vacation in Hong Kong, she met her future husband, LCDR James Garrick, there on R&R from Vietnam. They were married at the Treasure Island Navy Chapel, July 28, 1968. She continued flying while they lived in Washington, D.C., and later, in Davis, California, worked for a travel agency. They moved to Seattle in 1969, where they lived for a time in the “Sleepless in Seattle” houseboat. Her two children, JC and Nancy, were born in Seattle. Later, while living in Phoenix, she began playing tennis and continued to play avidly until the last year of her life. They moved to Hillsborough in 1979. During the past 25 years, she has served with the Peninsula League and captained both the “Hillsborough Movers” tennis team and her “Pen Niners” golf team. She was both a soccer and figure skating mom. She was a volunteer at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital for over twenty years. Next to her family, her many friends were her life. She supported them in times of need and never failed to brighten the day of anyone to whom she spoke. She was one of the rare people who found good in everyone. She is survived by her husband, Jim, her son, JC, her daughter, Nancy, her step-daughters, Becky Peterson and Amy Ellwein, her granddaughter, Hannah, sisters, Ruth Gerber and Mary Wolf, and brothers, Richard, Tom, Mark, and Russ Wenzl. A memorial service will be held at St. Bartholomew’s Church, Corner of Alameda and Crystal Springs Rd., San Mateo, CA at 10:00 a.m., Wednesday, Feb. 18. Memorials may be directed to The Saint Francis Memorial Hospital Foundation, 900 Hyde, SF, CA 94109."
