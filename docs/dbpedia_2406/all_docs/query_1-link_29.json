Letters include a lengthy 1751 letter from Richard Berenger describing theaters and operas in Paris; transcripts of two letters from Garrick to Francis Hayman about plans for a series of prints from Shakespeare; and a 1767 letter from the actor Patrick O'Brien discussing his \"exiled\" life in New York. Manuscript verse consists of drafts of several prologues and epilogues, and copies of comic epigrams and songs. Other papers include a record of receipts for the first season of Drury Lane; \"A Scheme for a Theatrical Society;\" a list of characters performed by Garrick in 1741-42; and a copy of \"Mr. Taylor's address to young students and lovers of landscape painting.\""
