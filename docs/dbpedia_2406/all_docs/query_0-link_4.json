MACKENZIE SHAW,\n\n6037 Registrar.\n\nParliamentary Election.\n\nTO THE ELECTORS OF FORTITUDE\n\nVALLEY.\n\nGENTLEMEN-In compliance with a numerously\n\nsigned requisition from my fellow\n\nelectors, I have the honor to offer myself as a\n\nCandidate for election as your representative in\n\nthe next Parliament. Should you bestow upon me\n\nthis great mark of your confidence, I shall do my\n\nbest to justify it by faithful and honest endeavors\n\nto do my duty. I will meet you in a short\n\ntime, and explain fully my opinions on the\n\nquestions of greatest interest to us as Valley\n\nelectors. An outline of these may, however, be\n\nuseful in the meantime.\n\nIn the first place, I shall insist on justice to\n\nyou by an addition of one member at least to\n\nyour share of the representation. No Ministry\n\nwill have my support that does not secure the\n\nValley two members, because I believe that a\n\nMinistry which has not strength to carry a just\n\nand equal representative law, is not entitled to\n\ngovern, and cannot throw the blame of a defeat\n\non the Opposition. The drainage of the Valley\n\nis a work of the utmost pressing need for our\n\nhealth and comfort, and ought to be started at\n\nonce. I will press this with all diligence.\n\nThe Valley ought to be connected with the\n\ngeneral railway system by means of a branch\n\nline, and, I think, it ought to go to deep water.\n\nI will urge on the construction of this work on\n\nthe best plan, and to the most convenient point\n\nthat can be found for it.\n\nI am opposed to Government giving either help\n\nor encouragement to bring in colored labor. I\n\nfeel that our own people and European people\n\nakin to us in blood, or like us, are beat entitled\n\nto try before all others whether this country is\n\nfit for their late or work.\n\nImmigration I will support, but it should not\n\nbe beyond the means of our people to find employment\n\nfor the new arrivals. To overstock the\n\nlabor market brings distress upon our working\n\nclasses, and I believe our arrivals should bear a\n\nreasonable measure to the chances of public or\n\nprivate employment.\n\nWe should continue our public works, not on\n\nan extravagant scale, but steadily to deacon\n\ntinue them suddenly or altogether would be sheer\n\nfolly.\n\nWe must meet our public engagements like\n\nhonest people. Our current expenditure upon a\n\nscale of true economy, and the interest of our\n\ndebt must of course be met, or our credit will be\n\nlost, and our power to continue public works\n\ngone for the present at least.\n\nIf it be true that a serious deficiency of income\n\nto meet expenditure is likely to arise at\n\nthe end of the present financial year, we must\n\nbe prepared for additional taxation to make it\n\nup and to continue our works. The holders of\n\nproperty in districts should be prepared to\n\nsecure the payment of interest on their railway\n\nlines by taxation until the receipts meet all the\n\ndemands for working and interest. Each district\n\nshould be separately assessed for this purpose,\n\nand the amount raised by a tax on land,\n\nboth freehold and leasehold. I will, however,\n\nenter more fully into detail on this subject when\n\nI meet you.\n\nIn conclusion let me say, there are, no doubt,\n\nother subjects of perhaps less importance at\n\nthis time, such as local government, ice., on\n\nwhich you may wish to learn my views. I will\n\ndo my best to make them clear to you when we\n\nmeet, and whatever I believe to be for the advantage\n\nof the country will have my hearty support\n\nand active help.\n\nI am, Gentlemen,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n5318 JOHN D.

Freney, Martin Freney, and\n\nother Gentlemen signing the above requisition.\n\nGentlemen Having done me the honor to\n\nrequest me to allow myself to be nominated as a\n\ncandidate for your Electorate, I now beg to inform\n\nyou that, although I had not intended to\n\ncontest this election (on the pressing invitation\n\nof some of your electors), I have now determined\n\nto place myself entirely in your hands,\n\nand should the Electors of Bulimba send me to\n\nParliament as their representative, they may rely\n\nupon my devoting my abilities to their interests\n\nin particular and those of the colony at large.\n\nHaving lived so many years in the district, I can\n\nconfidently say I have a thorough knowledge of\n\nwhat its requirements are.\n\nRelative to the general questions of the day.\n\nI am in favor of Main Trunk Lines of Railway\n\nthrough the country, with cheaper branches to\n\ncentres of population. With regard to roads, I\n\nconsider that in conjunction with these branch\n\nrailroads the making of roads and bridges are\n\nimportant, as enabling farmers and producers\n\ngenerally to get their produce to market at\n\nsmall expense, which roads should be vested in\n\nlocal boards. I am in favor of land laws for the\n\npeople, and opening the land to small capitalists\n\nwherever required.\n\nI am strongly opposed to wholesale Immigra\n\ngration, and would confine it to assisting the\n\nrelatives and friends of colonists and with\n\nregard to Chinese and Kanaka labor, it should\n\nnot be placed in competition with European. I\n\nam opposed to Payment of Members, its liable\n\nto introduce into our Legislative Assembly men\n\nwho would not have the welfare of the colony at\n\nheart. I need not now address you at greater\n\nlength, as it is my intention to visit you at an\n\nearly date, and will then he prepared to answer\n\nany question with regard to my views on other\n\nmatters that you may think fit to question me\n\nupon.
