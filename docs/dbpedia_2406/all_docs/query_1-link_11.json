        "text": "â€‹Garrett, Thomas, M.L.A., represented Camden in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales for a number of years. He was born in Liverpool, England, on July 16th, 1830, and went to New South Wales with his parents when nine years of age. A year later he was bound to the printing business, but during his apprenticeship he ran away, and became a cabin-boy on H.M.S. Fly, then employed in resurveying the coast between Port Jackson and Hobson's Bay. The youth was soon sent back, and having finished his apprenticeship, he was engaged on a number of newspapers, subsequently being employed in the Government printing office, where he worked for three years. Mr. Garrett then turned his attention to journalism, and in 1855 established the Illawarra Mercury, and afterwards also the Alpine Pioneer and the Cooma Mercury. In 1860 he first entered Parliament, sitting for the Monaro constituency. He retired four years later in favour of Mr. Alexander Montague, but was elected for Shoalhaven, for which electorate he sat as member until 1872. Afterwards he acted for a short period as police magistrate for Berrima, but not caring for official life, he again entered Parliament, this time for Camden, for which electorate he sat until the general election in June 1892, when, on account of ill-health, he decided not to again contest the seat, and bade farewell to political life. He was Secretary for Lands in the third John Robertson Ministry from Feb. 1875 to Feb. 1877, when he resigned. In the fourth Robertson Government he filled the same post from August to Nov. 1877, when he again resigned, and was succeeded, as on the former occasion, by Mr. E. A. Baker. He was Minister of Lands in the Parkes Government from Jan. 1887 to July 1888. Mr. Garrett died on Nov. 25th, 1891."
