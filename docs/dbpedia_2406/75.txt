Just to set the record straight, Francis was born in Sydney, Australia in 1833 and surname registered as Gowen.

Ref no. V1833500 17/1833 on New South Wales Births, Deaths and marriages. Some members of the family were registered as Gowin and others as Garrick. I see the wikipedia entry is unsure of his birthplace and I don't know how to change it but this entry may help some researcher in the future
