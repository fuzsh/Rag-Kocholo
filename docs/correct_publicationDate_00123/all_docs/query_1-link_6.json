        "text": "Description\n\nWritten by Edgar Rice Burroughs\n\nCover art and frontispiece by Joe Jusko\n\nForeword by Kevin J. Anderson and afterword by Henry G. Franke III\n\nBook 2 of the Barsoom® Saga – Authorized by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc., and Featuring Rare and Previously Unpublished Archival Materials\n\nAvailable in two editions:\n\nStandard Hardcover Edition\n\nJoe Jusko Legend Edition featuring a dust jacket highlighting the virgin cover art; illustrated exterior boards; a collectible ERB Authorized Library trading card; and a bookplate signed by renowned fantasy artist Joe Jusko, along with a facsimile signature of Edgar Rice Burroughs. Each Joe Jusko Legend Edition will be limited to only 300 copies.\n\nAfter ten long years stranded on Earth, John Carter returns once again to Barsoom. But this time, he finds himself fighting for his life in the Valley Dor—the presumed Martian paradise that is in reality a violent hellscape, where legions of blood-thirsty Plant Men and four-armed great apes reward with bitter death believers who take the final pilgrimage down the sacred River Iss. Reunited with Tars Tarkas, his loyal green Martian friend, John Carter runs awry into the hands of the Holy Therns, the ancient cult that in secret rules all Barsoom. But even the Therns themselves fall victim to the ruthless pirates of the First Born—and somewhere among these myriad adversaries lies John Carter’s beloved Dejah Thoris, waiting without hope beyond his reach.\n\nThe Edgar Rice Burroughs Authorized Library\n\nFor the first time ever, the Edgar Rice Burroughs Authorized Library presents the complete literary works of the Master of Adventure in uniform hardcover editions. Published by the company founded by Mr. Burroughs in 1923, each volume of the Authorized Library is packed with extras and rarities not to be found in any other edition. From cover art and frontispieces by legendary artist Joe Jusko to forewords and afterwords by today’s authorities and luminaries to a treasure trove of bonus materials mined from the company’s extensive archives in Tarzana, California, the Edgar Rice Burroughs Authorized Library will take you on a journey of wonder and imagination you will never forget.\n\nEdgar Rice Burroughs: Master of Adventure\n\nThe creator of the immortal characters Tarzan of the Apes and John Carter of Mars, Edgar Rice Burroughs is one of the world’s most popular authors. His timeless tales of heroes and heroines transport readers from the jungles of Africa and the dead sea bottoms of Barsoom to the miles-high forests of Amtor and the savage inner world of Pellucidar, and even to alien civilizations beyond the farthest star. Mr. Burroughs’ books are estimated to have sold hundreds of millions of copies, and they have spawned 60 films and 250 television episodes.\n\nJoe Jusko: Visionary Artist\n\nJoe Jusko is among today’s most acclaimed fantasy, pin-up, and comic artists. His work has been featured on book and comic posters, and on the much-praised 1992 Marvel Masterpieces trading cards. Jusko is a recipient of myriad industry honors, including a Certificate of Merit from the Society of Illustrators and a 2001 Chesley Award nomination. Fittingly, he was born on September 1, sharing his birthday with Edgar Rice Burroughs. Jusko’s longtime love of Burroughs’ work continues to inspire him in illustrating the Authorized Library and bringing the author’s creative vision to life.\n\nSee all the books in the Edgar Rice Burroughs Authorized Library:\n\nBARSOOM SERIES\n\n#1 A Princess of Mars\n\n#2 The Gods of Mars\n\n#3 The Warlord of Mars\n\n© Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc.
