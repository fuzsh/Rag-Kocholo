        "text": "My journey through Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Barsoom novels (and my Vintage SF Month 2021) continues with Return to Mars. Return to Mars collects Barsoom books 4-6: Thuvia, Maid of Mars; The Chessmen of Mars; and The Mastermind of Mars. The three together manage to exceed ERB’s first three Barsoom books.\n\nWhich is a little surprising, perhaps, because John Carter is the great highlight of the first three books but plays a very limited role in these three. John Carter’s son Carthorsis stars in Thuvia, Maid of Mars (along with the titular Thuvia). John Carter’s daughter Tara stars in The Chessmen of Mars (unlike Cathorsis, she is a new character). And a completely new character, Ulysses Paxton stars in The Mastermind of Mars, with John Carter only making a sort of cameo appearance.\n\nThuvia, Maid of Mars\n\nTMoM is a pretty conventional Barsoom tale. But it worked as a palate cleanser after The Warlord of Mars, my least favorite Barsoom book so far by a good margin, because it is well told, however conventional it is. There is also one bit of very cool worldbuilding in the city of Lothar and its phantoms.\n\n3.5 of 5 Stars.\n\nThe Chessmen of Mars\n\nThe Gods of Mars is the first ERB book I have given 5 of 5 stars. The Chessmen of Mars is the second. The Gods of Mars earned its perfect score with perfect, propulsive pacing. The Chessmen of Mars earns its perfect score with a great cornucopia of cool as hell worldbuilding. The sequence with Ghek in the prison is also hilarious.\n\n5 of 5 Stars.\n\nThe Master Mind of Mars\n\nUlysses Paxton isn’t a member of John Carter’s family or another Martian: he is an American earthling like Carter himself. A fan of ERB’s Barsoom books (meta!), he is able to astrally project himself to Mars as he lays dying in a WWI trench, his legs blown off by an explosive shell. He quickly finds himself in the employ of a mad scientist who does a brisk business transplanting the brains of Barsoom’s old and powerful into the bodies of its young and unfortunate. The main problem with tMMoM is that it leans so heavily on a theme—overemphasis on reason—that prominently features in the immediately previous book. But it offers a love interest whose fundamental decency shines through when she is robbed of her beautiful body, and the implicit commentary on zealots in the latter half of the book is fresh and biting.\n\n4.5 of 5 Stars.\n\nThe eight ERB books I’ve read, ranked:\n\nThe Chessmen of Mars\n\nThe Gods of Mars\n\nThe Mastermind of Mars\n\nA Princess of Mars\n\nAt the Earth’s Core\n\nPirates of Venus\n\nThuvia, Maid of Mars\n\nThe Warlord of Mars"
