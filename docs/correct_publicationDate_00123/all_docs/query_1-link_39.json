        "meta_description": "The Gods of Mars is a science fantasy novel by American writer Edgar Rice Burroughs, the second of his Barsoom series.Edgar Rice Burroughs (September 1, 1875 - March 19, 1950) was an American writer best known for his creations of the jungle hero Tarzan and the heroic Mars adventurer John Carter, although he produced works in many genres. Aiming his work at the pulps, Burroughs had his rst story, Under the Moons of Mars, serialized by Frank Munsey in the February to July 1912 issues of The All-Story - under the name \"Norman Bean\" to protect his reputation. Under the Moons of Mars inaugurated the Barsoom series and earned Burroughs US$400 ($9,927 today). It was rst published as a book by A. C. McClurg of Chicago in 1917, entitled A Princess of Mars.In a Paris Review interview, Ray Bradbury said of Burroughs that \"Edgar Rice Burroughs never would have looked upon himself as a social mover and shaker with social obligations. But as it turns out - and I love to say it because it upsets everyone terribly - Burroughs is probably the most influential writer in the entire history of the world.\" Bradbury continued that \"By giving romance and adventure to a whole generation of boys, Burroughs caused them to go out and decide to become special.\" In Something of Myself (published posthumously in 1937) Rudyard Kipling wrote: \"My Jungle Books begat Zoos of them. But the genius of all the genii was one who wrote a series called Tarzan of the Apes.\"This classic title has been published by RADLEY BOOKS.
