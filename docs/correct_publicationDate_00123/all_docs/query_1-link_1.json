        "text": "Description\n\nby Geary Gravel\n\nCover art by Chris Peuler\n\nMap of Barsoom by Cortney Skinner\n\nNews of the passing of a dear friend spurs John Carter, Warlord of Mars, to investigate a series of perplexing mysteries in the forbidding icy northern reaches of Barsoom. The enigmas only deepen as he embarks upon a journey to the far-flung treasure city of Gathol with his spirited daughter Tara and an unexpected stowaway. Ensnared in an insidious conspiracy that reaches from his early years on the Red Planet back into the dim recesses of the ancient past, John Carter and his trusted longsword are now all that stand in the way of a dread menace that threatens the existence of all life on Barsoom.\n\nBonus Novelette: “Victory Harben: Stormwinds of Va-nah”\n\nby Ann Tonsor Zeddies\n\nContinuing her wayward journey upon the currents of spacetime, Victory Harben arrives in the strange hollow interior world of Va-nah from Edgar Rice Burroughs’ classic The Moon Maid. Thrust into an uneasy alliance with a renegade Va-gas warrior and her young son, Victory must turn all her wits and skills toward survival—for she and her companions have been marked for death by the brutal the Kalkar soldiers under the reign of the vile tyrant Orthis.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nGeary Gravel is the author of the Philip K. Dick Award finalist The Alchemists, as well as the novels The Pathfinders, A Key for the Nonesuch, and Return of the Breakneck Boys. He has also written several novelizations, including Hook, based on the Steven Spielberg film, and Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, based on the animated movie. He lives in western Massachusetts, where he worked for decades as a Sign Language Interpreter for the Deaf.\n\nAnn Tonsor Zeddies first encountered the ERB Universe as a child, when an old professor who lived down the street allowed her to choose a volume from his shelves. She chose Tarzan of the Apes. Later, she read the adventures of John Carter aloud to her young son. She is the author of six science fiction novels, two of which were Philip K. Dick Award nominees. Her short fiction includes stories in The Ultimate Silver Surfer and Magic in the Mirrorstone. She lives in Michigan with her husband, near the shores of an inland sea.\n\nAbout the Cover Artist\n\nChris Peuler is a genre illustrator based in Chicago, working primarily in fantasy and science fiction.
