        "text": "Author Edgar Rice Burroughs created one of the most enduring fictional characters in the history of 20th century literature: Tarzan, the English lord raised by apes, whose jungle exploits were chronicled in a string of best-selling fantasy novels, as well as countless feature films, television series, radio plays and other media. Burroughs also created the popular Barsoom series, which followed the adventures of the titular Earthling John Carter on the planet Mars, as well as a host of other science fiction and fantasy novels that would have a lasting impact upon the genre for decades. Though widely perceived as pulp material, Burroughs' fiction was imaginative and action-packed, and his core characters memorable enough to enjoy life spans that lasted beyond that of their creator, who died in 1950. He was also among the first writers to fully embrace the concept of licensing his creations to increase their visibility and income potential, though Burroughs was often at odds with film versions of his work. Though his work lacked the literary skill of more accomplished authors, Burroughs' best novels had a scope and pace that ignited readers' imagination and kept them coming back for more, which in turn enshrined his writing as part of the pop culture fabric for eternity."
