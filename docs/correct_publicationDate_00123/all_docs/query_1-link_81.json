        "text": "This is the second in Burrough's Barsoom series and it is excellent. It is, perhaps, not quite as excellent as A Princess of Mars. But it is excellent nonetheless. The same grand storytelling effortlessly mixes alien races, traditions, technologies and religions with John Carter's impeccable swordsmanship, sense of duty and honor.\n\nAs with its predecessor, one must read this book with an understanding of the prevailing prejudices at the time in which it was written. Some sentiments are fairly out of step with modern sensitivities.\n\nHowever, the story is fast paced and well written. The adventure is enormous in scope as armies of nearly unfathomable size clash in a bloody schism between the old and new. John Carter finds himself not only a participant in but an architect of revolution on a planetary scale. All the while, the reader is left wondering whether Carter's personal struggles will result in victory.\n\nBurroughs took some liberty with the passage of time in some portions of the story. These quantum shifts were noticeable but not jarring. And despite them this was a thoroughly enjoyable book which I devoured rapaciously. It was certainly a worthy successor to A Princess of Mars and I will certainly read it again."
