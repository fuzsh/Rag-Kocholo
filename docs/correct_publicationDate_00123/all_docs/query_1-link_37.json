        "text": "The Gods of Mars\n\nby Edgar Rice Burroughs\n\nThis book is the second Barsoom book released by Project Gutenberg. Also available are \"A Princess of Mars\", \"The Warlord of Mars\" and \"Thuvia, Maid of Mars\" -- others will be formatted and made available as (and if) they are released.\n\nNOTE: This is a hypertext formatted version of the Project Gutenberg edition. For more information, read the small print or check out the full ascii text. This document is part of a small, but growing collection of html formatted etexts. (Others may be found in either my home page or John Ockerbloom's indexes by author and title.) I am still trying to figure out whether anyone else is interested in these on-line readable documents. If you appreciate this document or would like to see more such, send me mail at \"rgs@cs.cmu.edu\".\n\nTHE GODS OF MARS was first published in ALL-STORY MAGAZINE as a five-part serial, January through May 1913.\n\nContents:\n\nForeword I. The Plant Men II. A Forest Battle III. The Chamber of Mystery IV. Thuvia V. Corridors of Peril VI. The Black Pirates of Barsoom VII. A Fair Goddess VIII. The Depths of Omean IX.
