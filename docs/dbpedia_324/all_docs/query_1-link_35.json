        "text": "Farm-level economics of innovative tillage technologies: the case of no-till in the Altai Krai in Russian Siberia.\n\nPubMed\n\nBavorova, Miroslava; Imamverdiyev, Nizami; Ponkina, Elena\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn the agricultural Altai Krai in Russian Siberia, soil degradation problems are prevalent. Agronomists recommend \"reduced tillage systems,\" especially no-till, as a sustainable way to cultivate land that is threatened by soil degradation. In the Altai Krai, less is known about the technologies in practice. In this paper, we provide information on plant cultivation technologies used in the Altai Krai and on selected factors preventing farm managers in this region from adopting no-till technology based on our own quantitative survey conducted across 107 farms in 2015 and 2016. The results of the quantitative survey show that farm managers have high uncertainty regarding the use of no-till technology including its economics. To close this gap, we provide systematic analysis of factors influencing the economy of the plant production systems by using a farm optimization model (linear programming) for a real farm, together with expert estimations. The farm-specific results of the optimization model show that under optimal management and climatic conditions, the expert Modern Canadian no-till technology outperforms the farm min-till technology, but this is not the case for suboptimal conditions with lower yields.\n\nSiberia, the wandering northern terrane, and its changing geography through the Palaeozoic\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCocks, L. Robin M.; Torsvik, Trond H.\n\n2007-05-01\n\nThe old terrane of Siberia occupied a very substantial area in the centre of today's political Siberia and also adjacent areas of Mongolia, eastern Kazakhstan, and northwestern China. Siberia's location within the Early Neoproterozoic Rodinia Superterrane is contentious (since few if any reliable palaeomagnetic data exist between about 1.0 Ga and 540 Ma), but Siberia probably became independent during the breakup of Rodinia soon after 800 Ma and continued to be so until very near the end of the Palaeozoic, when it became an integral part of the Pangea Supercontinent. The boundaries of the cratonic core of the Siberian Terrane (including the Patom area) are briefly described, together with summaries of some of the geologically complex surrounding areas, and it is concluded that all of the Palaeozoic underlying the West Siberian Basin (including the Ob-Saisan Surgut area), Tomsk Terrane, Altai-Sayan Terranes (including Salair, Kuznetsk Alatau, Batenov, Kobdin and West Sayan), Ertix Terrane, Barguzin Terrane, Tuva-Mongol Terrane, Central Mongolia Terrane Assemblage, Gobi Altai and Mandalovoo Terranes, Okhotsk Terrane and much of the Verkhoyansk-Kolyma region all formed parts of peri-Siberia, and thus rotated with the main Siberian Craton as those areas were progressively accreted to the main Siberian Terrane at various times during the latest Neoproterozoic and Palaeozoic. The Ertix Terrane is a new term combining what has been termed the \"Altay Terrane\" or \"NE Xinjiang\" area of China, and the Baytag, Baaran and Bidz terranes of Mongolia. The Silurian Tuvaella brachiopod fauna is restricted only to today's southern parts of peri-Siberia. Thus, allowing for subsequent rotation, the fauna occurs only in the N of the Siberian Terrane, and, as well as being a helpful indicator of what marginal terranes made up peri-Siberia, is distinctive as being the only Silurian fauna known from northern higher latitudes globally. In contrast, the other terranes adjacent to peri-Siberia\n\nCirculation patterns governing October snowfalls in southern Siberia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBednorz, Ewa; Wibig, Joanna\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThis study is focused on early fall season in southern Siberia (50-60 N) and is purposed as a contribution to the discussion on the climatic relevance of October Eurasian snow cover. Analysis is based on the daily snow depth data from 43 stations from years 1980-2012, available in the database of All-Russian Research Institute of Hydrometeorological InformationâWorld Data Centre. The snow cover season in southern Siberia starts in early autumn and the number of days with snowfall varies from less than 5 days in the southernmost zone along the parallel 50 N to more than 25 days in the northeastern part of the analyzed area. October snowfall in southern Siberia is associated with occurrence of negative anomalies of sea level pressure (SLP), usually spreading right over the place of recorded intense snowfall or extending eastward from it. Negative anomalies of air temperature at the 850 hPa geopotential level (T850) occurring with increased cyclonic activity are also observed. Negative T850 anomalies are located west or northwest of the SLP depressions. Counterclockwise circulation around low-pressure systems transports cold Arctic air from the north or even colder Siberian polar air from the east, to the west, and northwest parts of cyclones, and induces negative anomalies of temperature. The pattern of T850 anomalies during heavy snowfalls in the eastern part of the southern Siberia is shifted counterclockwise in regard to SLP anomalies: the strongest negative T850 anomalies are located west or northwest of the SLP depressions.\n\nA 33,000-year-old incipient dog from the Altai Mountains of Siberia: evidence of the earliest domestication disrupted by the Last Glacial Maximum.\n\nPubMed\n\nOvodov, Nikolai D; Crockford, Susan J; Kuzmin, Yaroslav V; Higham, Thomas F G; Hodgins, Gregory W L; van der Plicht, Johannes\n\n2011-01-01\n\nVirtually all well-documented remains of early domestic dog (Canis familiaris) come from the late Glacial and early Holocene periods (ca. 14,000-9000 calendar years ago, cal BP), with few putative dogs found prior to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ca. 26,500-19,000 cal BP). The dearth of pre-LGM dog-like canids and incomplete state of their preservation has until now prevented an understanding of the morphological features of transitional forms between wild wolves and domesticated dogs in temporal perspective. We describe the well-preserved remains of a dog-like canid from the Razboinichya Cave (Altai Mountains of southern Siberia). Because of the extraordinary preservation of the material, including skull, mandibles (both sides) and teeth, it was possible to conduct a complete morphological description and comparison with representative examples of pre-LGM wild wolves, modern wolves, prehistoric domesticated dogs, and early dog-like canids, using morphological criteria to distinguish between wolves and dogs. It was found that the Razboinichya Cave individual is most similar to fully domesticated dogs from Greenland (about 1000 years old), and unlike ancient and modern wolves, and putative dogs from Eliseevichi I site in central Russia. Direct AMS radiocarbon dating of the skull and mandible of the Razboinichya canid conducted in three independent laboratories resulted in highly compatible ages, with average value of ca. 33,000 cal BP. The Razboinichya Cave specimen appears to be an incipient dog that did not give rise to late Glacial-early Holocene lineages and probably represents wolf domestication disrupted by the climatic and cultural changes associated with the LGM. The two earliest incipient dogs from Western Europe (Goyet, Belguim) and Siberia (Razboinichya), separated by thousands of kilometers, show that dog domestication was multiregional, and thus had no single place of origin (as some DNA data have suggested) and subsequent spread.\n\nNeanderthals in central Asia and Siberia.\n\nPubMed\n\nKrause, Johannes; Orlando, Ludovic; Serre, David; Viola, Bence; PrÃ¼fer, Kay; Richards, Michael P; Hublin, Jean-Jacques; HÃ¤nni, Catherine; Derevianko, Anatoly P; PÃ¤Ã¤bo, Svante\n\n2007-10-18\n\nMorphological traits typical of Neanderthals began to appear in European hominids at least 400,000 years ago and about 150,000 years ago in western Asia. After their initial appearance, such traits increased in frequency and the extent to which they are expressed until they disappeared shortly after 30,000 years ago. However, because most fossil hominid remains are fragmentary, it can be difficult or impossible to determine unambiguously whether a fossil is of Neanderthal origin. This limits the ability to determine when and where Neanderthals lived. To determine how far to the east Neanderthals ranged, we determined mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from hominid remains found in Uzbekistan and in the Altai region of southern Siberia. Here we show that the DNA sequences from these fossils fall within the European Neanderthal mtDNA variation. Thus, the geographic range of Neanderthals is likely to have extended at least 2,000 km further to the east than commonly assumed.\n\nGlacier Evolution in the Altai Mountains, South-West Siberia, for the Last Half Century (with use of Geo-Informational Catalogue)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSurazakov, A. B.; Narojniy, Y. K.; Nikitin, S. A.; Aizen, V. B.\n\n2003-12-01\n\nTo systemize and analyze the information for the period from 1835 to present on altitudinal distributions of glaciers, exposition, their numbers and surface areas in basins, volumes, genetic classification, location of lower and upper level of glaciers, average firn line position and main morphometric characteristics, DataBase on glacier dynamics in the Altai Mountains (AGDB) has been developed in ArcGIS Format [Tomsk State University, Russia]. Data from Glacier Catalogue [1962], topographic maps with the scale of 1:25000 and 1:50000 and air photos, which fixed glaciers' state on 1952, were digitized. Instrumental observational data on glacier tongue retreat from twenty glaciers since 1835, and radio-echo sounding measurements of 120 glacier volumes were also digitized in the AGDB. Modern state of Altai glaciers and their changes since 1952 were assessed from Resurs space images and partially from instrumental observations. Based on estimation from Resurs for the period from 1952 to 1998, the value of Altai glacier retreating was about 56.9 km2, i.e. 7.1 % of total area, varied from 4 % for valley glaciers to 16 % for glaciers of flat mountain tops. Retreat of 2-8 m per year was accompanied by their 10% mass loss. The slightest degradation occurred in inner (central) part of the glacier system, in the heads of river basins with large-scale glaciation, e.g., in the Katunski, Nothern-Chuiski and Southern-Chuiski ranges, amounting to 6.3%. These are the highest regions, reaching up to 4506 m., and 80% of Altai's glaciers are located there. In the river basins with relatively small-glacierized areas, at the peripheral regions, e.g., Kurai, Chihacheva ranges, the degradation reached its maximum values up to 22%.\n\nTree Waves Upward Migration in the Altai Mountains, Siberia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKharuk, Viacheslav; Im, Sergei; Dvinskaya, Maria; Petrov, Il'ya\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe phenomenon of \"tree waves\" (hedges and ribbons) formation within the alpine ecotone in Altai Mountains and its response to observed air temperature increase was considered. At the upper limit of tree growth Siberian pine (Pinus sibirica) forms hedges on windward slopes and ribbons on the leeward ones. Hedges were formed by prevailing winds and oriented along winds direction. Ribbons were formed by snow blowing and accumulating on the leeward slope and perpendicular to the prevailing winds, as well as to the elevation gradient. Hedges were always linked with microtopography features, whereas ribbons were not. Trees are migrating upward by waves and new ribbons and hedges are forming at or near tree line, whereas at lower elevations ribbons and hedges are being transformed into closed forests. Time series of high-resolution satellite scenes (from 1968 to 2010) indicated an upslope shift in the position ribbons averaged 155Â±26 m (or 3.7 m yr -1) and crown closure increased (about 35-90%). The hedges advance was limited by poor regeneration establishment and was negligible. Regeneration within the \"ribbon zone\" was approximately 2.5 times (5060 vs 2120 ha -1) higher then within the \"hedges zone\". During the last four decades, Siberian pine in both hedges and ribbons strongly increased its growth increment and recent tree growth rate for 50 year old trees was about twice higher than recorded for similarly aged trees at the beginning of the 20th century. Growth increment increase was strongly correlated with CO2 concentration in the ambient air (R2 = 0.9), which may indicated CO2- fertilization. Hedges and ribbons are phenomena that are widespread within the southern and northern Siberian Mountains\n\nAltai Empathy Culture: Ontological Design of Altai Cognitive Environment\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nVoronin, Maksim; Belousova, Valeria; Khalina, Natalya\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis study considers the features of Altai cultural semantics through the cognitive materialism of culture basing on the assumption that the linguistic structures are part of culture, and the metaphorical linguistic use is the basis for cultural cognitive structures forming.

Altai forms a natural barrier to the northern and western air masses and therefore affords an opportunity to develop modern paleo-climate records relating to the westerly jet stream, the Siberian High and Pacific monsoon. Moreover, Altai alpine snowice accumulation areas are appropriative for studying air pollution dynamics at the center of Eurasia, eastward from the major Former USSR air pollutants in Kazakhstan, South Siberia and Ural Mountains. During the last century Altai Mountains became extremely contaminated region by heavy metal mining, metallurgy, nuclear test in Semipalatinsk polygon and Baikonur rocket site. Our first field reconnaissance on the West Belukha snow/firn plateau at the Central Altai was carried out in July 2001. Dispute of the large Alatai Mountains glaciation, the West Belukha Plateau (49o48' N, 86o32'E, 4000-4100 m a.s.l.) is only one suitable snow accumulation site in Altai to recover ice-core paleo-climatic and environmental records that is not affected by meltwater percolation. The objective of our first reconnaissance was to find an appropriate deep drilling site by radio-echo sounding survey, to recover shallow ice-core, to identify the annual snow accumulation rate, major ions, heavy metals, radio nuclides and oxygen isotopes level distribution. During 6 days of work on the Plateau, a 22 m shallow firn/ice core has been recovered by PICO hand auger at elevation 4050 m where the results of radio-echo sounding suggests about 150 m ice thickness. In addition to the firn/ice core recovery, five 2.5 meter snow pits were sampled for physical statigraphy, major ions, trace element, and heavy metals analysis to assess spatial variability of the environmental impact in this region. Four automatic snow gauges were installed near proposed deep ice coring site\n\nDroughts and Excessive Moisture Events in Southern Siberia in the Late XXth - Early XXIst Centuries\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRyazanova, A. A.; Voropay, N. N.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nIn recent years much research has been devoted to global and regional climate changes. Special attention was paid to climate extremes, such as droughts and excessive moisture events. In this study the moisture and aridity of Southern Siberia are estimated using web-GIS called âCLIMATEâ. The system âCLIMATEâ is part of a hardware and software cloud storage complex for data analysis of various climatic data sets, with algorithms for searching, extracting, processing, and visualizing the data. The ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis data for Southern Siberia (50-65Â°N, 60-120Â°E) from 1979 to 2010 with a grid cell of 0.75Ã0.75Â° is used. Some hydrothermal conditions are estimated using the so-called Ped index (Si), which is a normalized indicator of the ratio of air temperature to precipitation. The mountain regions of Eastern Siberia are becoming more and more arid each month during the last 30 years. In Western Siberia, aridity increases in May and decreases in June, in the other months positive and negative trends are found. The greatest differences between the trends of the aridity index (Si), air temperature, and precipitation are observed in July.\n\nInfluence of altitude on tick-borne encephalitis infection risk in the natural foci of the Altai Republic, Southern Siberia.\n\nPubMed\n\nShchuchinova, L D; Kozlova, I V; Zlobin, V I\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThe Altai Republic is a highly endemic area as far as tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is concerned. The aim of the research was to study the effect of altitude on the risk of tick-borne encephalitis infection in the Altai Republic. The paper analyzes the following data: the study of ixodid ticks collected from the vegetation in 116 sites at the 200-2383m elevation above sea level in 2012-2014, TBE virus prevalence of these vectors, tick-bite incidence rate, and TBE incidence rate of the population. Species identification of 4503 specimens has shown that the most common species are Dermacentor nuttalli (45.3%), Ixodes persulcatus (33.1%), Dermacentor silvarum (9.4%), Dermacentor reticulatus (8.9%), and Haemaphysalis concinna (5.0%). A total of 2997 adult ixodid ticks were studied for the presence of the TBE virus; 2163 samples were examined by ELISA, while 834 specimens were tested by PCR. The TBE virus prevalence of Dermacentor spp. ticks in both reactions was significantly higher than of Ixodes persulcatus ticks (p<0.001). The work shows that the altitude is an important factor in the development of the epidemiological situation of tick-borne encephalitis: the higher the elevation of the area above sea level, the smaller the range of vectors. There is also a change of a leading species: in middle altitude (800-1700m above sea level) the virus is transmitted by ticks of D. nuttalli along with I. persulcatus, and in high mountains (above 1700m above sea level) D. nuttalli becomes an absolute dominant species. However, these species of ticks are less effective vectors than I. persulcatus. With the increase of altitude the tick-bite incidence rate decreases (r=-0.78, p<0.05), and TBE incidence also reduces (r=-0.67, p<0.05). Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Recently, this virus was observed in certain provinces of European part of Russia, Ural, and Western and Eastern Siberia. However, the occurrence and genetic diversity of KEMV in Western Siberia remain poorly studied. Therefore, the aim of this work was to investigate the prevalence and genetic variability of KEMV in Ixodes ticks from Western Siberia. A total of 1958 Ixodes persulcatus, I. pavlovskyi ticks and their hybrids from Novosibirsk and Omsk provinces, Altai Republic (Russia) and East Kazakhstan province (Kazakhstan) were analyzed for the presence of KEMV and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) RNA. It was observed that the KEMV distribution area in Western Siberia was wider than originally thought and included Northern and Northeastern Altai in addition to the Omsk and Novosibirsk provinces. For the first time, this virus was found in Kazakhstan. The occurrence of KEMV was statistically lower than TBEV in most locations in Western Siberia. KEMV was found both in I. persulcatus and I. pavlovskyi ticks and in their hybrids. Notably, KEMV variants observed in the 2010s were genetically different from those isolated in the 1960s, which indicated the ongoing process of evolution of the Kemerovo virus group. Moreover, the possibility of reassortment for KEMV was demonstrated for the first time. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

M.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nFor all days of measurements in 2002-2015 of volume concentration of aerosols at the AERONET Tomsk/Tomsk-22 station an array of 10-day backward trajectories of air parcels arriving in Tomsk into seven layers of the troposphere with heights in the range of 0.5-5.0 km is calculated using the trajectory model NOAA HYSPLIT_4. For the three fractions of the aerosol with particle sizes < 1.0 Î¼m, 1.0-2.5 Î¼m, 2.5-5.0 Î¼m and their sum (< 5.0 Î¼m), the field of capacity of the potential sources of aerosols of these fractions for southern Siberia is determined by the CWT (concentration weighted trajectory) method using the backward trajectory array. The analysis is carried out taking into account the processes both the scavenging of the aerosols with precipitation and the dry deposition. Trajectories arriving at different heights were analyzed taking into account the weight coefficients proportional to the backward light scattering coefficients of an aerosols at corresponding heights for warm and cold seasons in Western Siberia. The most capable (in unit of volume concentration Î¼m3 /Î¼m2 ) potential sources of these fractions for southern Siberia are located above North Africa, Eastern Siberia, Central Asia and the Dzhungarian desert in the Xinjiang-Uyghur Autonomous Region of China.\n\nForest snail diversity and its environmental predictors along a sharp climatic gradient in southern Siberia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHorsÃ¡k, Michal; JuÅiÄkovÃ¡, Lucie; HorsÃ¡kovÃ¡, Veronika; PokornÃ¡, AdÃ©la; PokornÃ½, Petr; Å izling, ArnoÅ¡t L.; ChytrÃ½, Milan\n\n2018-04-01\n\nDiversity patterns of forest snail assemblages have been studied mainly in Europe. Siberian snail faunas have different evolutionary history and colonization dynamics than European faunas, but studies of forest snail diversity are almost missing from Siberia. Therefore, we collected snails at 173 forest sites in the Russian Altai and adjacent areas, encompassing broad variation in climate and forest types. We found 51 species, with a maximum of 15 and an average of seven species per site. The main gradient in species composition was related to soil pH, a variable that also positively correlates with snail abundances. The second gradient was associated with climate characteristics of winter. We observed significant differences in both species richness and composition among six forest types defined based on vegetation classification. Hemiboreal continental forests were the poorest of these types but hosted several species characteristic of European full-glacial stages of the Late Pleistocene. A high snow cover in Temperate coniferous and mixed forests, protecting the soil from freezing, allowed the frost-sensitive large-bodied (>10 mm) species to inhabit this forest type. In contrast to most of the European snail assemblages studied so far we found that the factors responsible for the variation in species richness differed from those driving species composition. This may be attributed to the sharp climatic gradient and the presence of the cold-adapted species typical of the Pleistocene cold stages. We suggest that southern Siberian forests hosting these species can serve as modern analogues of full-glacial forests in periglacial Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nMultilingual Education in South Siberia: National Schools in the Republics of Altai and Tyva\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nChevalier, Joan F.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSubtractive bilingualism is widespread throughout Siberia, with indigenous youth often more proficient in Russian than in their non-Russian local languages.

To validate or invalidate the widely reported wetting trend, we obtained a carbon isotope of cellulose (Î´13Ccelluose)-recorded warm-season moisture history from a Narenxia (NRX) peat core in the southern Altai Mountains, northern Xinjiang, NW China. The Î´13Ccelluose-recorded warm-season moisture reconstruction of the NRX peat core provides a strong support to the widely-reported proposition that the climate was generally dry before â¼8.0 cal. kyr BP and was changed to a wetting trend during the past â¼8000 years in the Altai Mountains and the surrounding areas. The wetting trend since â¼8.0 cal. kyr BP well resembles the increasing trend of the reconnaissance drought index (RDI) that was calculated on the basis of pollen-inferred temperature and precipitation data from the same core. The resemblance implies that the wetting trend during the past â¼8000 years resulted from the combined effect of temperature and precipitation.\n\nTree Wave Migration Across an Elevation Gradient in the Altai Mountains, Siberia\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKharuk, Viacheslav I.; Im, Sergei T.; Dvinskaya, Maria L.; Ranson, Kenneth J.; Petrov, Il'ya\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe phenomenon of tree waves (hedges and ribbons) formation within the alpine ecotone in Altai Mountains and its response to observed air temperature increase was considered.

It has an old and rich history because humans have inhabited this area since the Paleolithic. Today, the Altai region is home to numerous Turkic-speaking ethnic groups, which have been divided into northern and southern clusters based on linguistic, cultural, and anthropological traits. To untangle Altaian genetic histories, we analyzed mtDNA and Y chromosome variation in northern and southern Altaian populations. All mtDNAs were assayed by PCR-RFLP analysis and control region sequencing, and the nonrecombining portion of the Y chromosome was scored for more than 100 biallelic markers and 17 Y-STRs. Based on these data, we noted differences in the origin and population history of Altaian ethnic groups, with northern Altaians appearing more like Yeniseian, Ugric, and Samoyedic speakers to the north, and southern Altaians having greater affinities to other Turkic speaking populations of southern Siberia and Central Asia. Moreover, high-resolution analysis of Y chromosome haplogroup Q has allowed us to reshape the phylogeny of this branch, making connections between populations of the New World and Old World more apparent and demonstrating that southern Altaians and Native Americans share a recent common ancestor. These results greatly enhance our understanding of the peopling of Siberia and the Americas.

W.; LÃ¼thi, M.; Eyrik, S.; Blaser, C.; Saurer, M.; Schotterer, U.\n\n2003-04-01\n\nLittle is known about climatic change and paleo-atmospheric composition in Siberia. The Altai is the only alpine region in this area covered by glaciers that might serve as archives for such studies. Moreover, it is located close to air pollution sources in East Kazakhstan and South Siberia (heavy metal mining, metallurgy) as well as to the nuclear test site of Semipalatinsk (release of radionuclides into the atmosphere). In order to reconstruct air pollution levels in the Altai region, a 140-meter ice core down to bedrock was recovered from the Belukha glacier (N49^o48'26\", E86^o34'43\", 4062 m asl) in July 2001. This site was selected based on the results of an exploratory study conducted in 2000. So far, the concentrations of major ionic species and the stable isotope ratio Î´18O were determined in the approx. 90 topmost meters of the ice core covering about 200 years. Dating of the upper part of the ice core was performed by a combination of methods that include e.g. nuclear techniques and annual-layer counting. The annual net accumulation amounts to about 0.53 m weq. and indicates that snow at the Belukha glacier might be partly eroded by wind, a situation that is often observed for a glacier saddle. The borehole temperature (-16 ^oC at 80 m depth), the discernible fluctuations of the stable isotope and chemistry records as well as the linearity of the decrease of the log. 210Pb activities with depth indicate that the glaciochemical record is well preserved and not significantly altered by melting processes. In pre-industrial ice concentrations of carboxylic acids and ammonium are high, suggesting the surrounding forest as source of biogenic emissions.\n\nAspiring Geopark \"Altai\" as a Way of Sustainable Development of Altai Mountains\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChernoeva, Shuralai; Kocheewa, Nina\n\n2016-04-01\n\nMountainous Altai is the centre of biological and cultural diversity where indigenous people still maintain their traditional way of life. Collapse of the Soviet Union led to withdrawal of many industrial companies and dramatic increase in unemployment. Nowadays Altai is working on a formidable task trying to develop economy while preserving and perpetuating traditions of indigenous people. Recently tourism is becoming economic priority. The Altai Republic has a great potential for the development of the tourism industry, due to climatic conditions of the region, rich cultural and historical heritage and unique landscapes. Currently a concept of formation of Geopark in this region of Russia is being developed. It is expected that this new direction for the Russian tourism is most suitable for the traditions of the indigenous peoples and will expand the number of tourists, attracting more intelligent people to visit our territory. The indigenous people of the Altai worship nature and take care of many objects which have spiritual significance and carry out important cultural functions throughout centuries.\n\nTranspressional deformation, strain partitioning and fold superimposition in the southern Chinese Altai, Central Asian Orogenic Belt\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Pengfei; Sun, Min; Rosenbaum, Gideon; Cai, Keda; Chen, Ming; He, Yulin\n\n2016-06-01\n\nTranspressional deformation has played an important role in the late Paleozoic evolution of the western Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), and understanding the structural evolution of such transpressional zones is crucial for tectonic reconstructions. Here we focus on the transpressional Irtysh Shear Zone with an aim at understanding amalgamation processes between the Chinese Altai and the West/East Junggar. We mapped macroscopic fold structures in the southern Chinese Altai and analyzed their relationships with the development of the adjacent Irtysh Shear Zone. Structural observations from these macroscopic folds show evidence for four generations of folding and associated fabrics. The earlier fabric (S1), is locally recognized in low strain areas, and is commonly isoclinally folded by F2 folds that have an axial plane orientation parallel to the dominant fabric (S2). S2 is associated with a shallowly plunging stretching lineation (L2), and defines â¼NW-SE tight-close upright macroscopic folds (F3) with the doubly plunging geometry. F3 folds are superimposed by â¼NNW-SSE gentle F4 folds. The F3 and F4 folds are kinematically compatible with sinistral transpressional deformation along the Irtysh Shear Zone and may represent strain partitioning during deformation. The sub-parallelism of F3 fold axis with the Irtysh Shear Zone may have resulted from strain partitioning associated with simple shear deformation along narrow mylonite zones and pure shear-dominant deformation (F3) in fold zones. The strain partitioning may have become less efficient in the later stage of transpressional deformation, so that a fraction of transcurrent components was partitioned into F4 folds.\n\nTectono-metamorphic evolution of the Chinese Altai, central Asia: new insights from microstructures\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJiang, Yingde; Zhang, Jian; Schulmann, Karel; Sun, Min; Zhao, Guochun\n\n2013-04-01\n\nThe Altai Orogen, extending from Russia, through northeast Kazakhstan and northwest China, to western and southern Mongolia, occupies a pivotal position in understanding the accretionary process of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt and has drawn much attention in recent years. However, its orogenic evolution remains poorly constrained, because previous studies were mainly focused on the geochronological and geochemical signatures and much less work has been done on metamorphic and structural studies. Metamorphic rocks widely occur in the southern Altai Range and have previously been separated into high-T/low-P and medium-P types. Recent studies demonstrated that these two kinds of rocks may have similar protoliths, i.e. early Paleozoic arc-related assemblages, but experienced different metamorphic histories. The development of biotite, garnet, staurolite and kyanite metamorphic zonal sequences in the low- to medium- grade rocks, demonstrate typical medium-pressure metamorphism that has been suggested as a major consequence of the orogenesis. The high-T/low-P metamorphism, represented by the growth of garnet+cordierite+sillimanite+k-feldspar and was accompanied by extensive anatexis, remains its tectonic significance poorly constrained. Field structural investigation in the Chinese Altai reveals that the high-T/low-P metamorphic rocks have major S-L fabrics (defined by the strongly aligned biotite and sillimanite) exactly in the same orientations as those developed in the associated medium-P grade rocks. Geochronological studies constrain the major fabrics in both kinds of rocks developed during mid-Devonian, coeval with the strong magmatism in the region. Micro-structural investigation on both kinds of rocks show similar prograde metamorphic history featured by clockwise P-T path evolution. Phase equilibrium modeling in the MnNCKFMASH system indicates that the development of major fabrics in the medium-P metamorphic rocks mainly recorded the notable increase of\n\nAMS 14C and 230Th/U dating on stalagmites from North Altai Mountain, Siberia, Russia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, H. C.; Yin, J. J.; Blyakharchuk, T.; Shen, C. C.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThree stalagmites, two from Lunnaya Cave (LUN-1 and LUN-2, 52Âº40.729'N, 88Âº43.854' E, 481 m a.s.l.), one from Nadezhda Cave (HOP-1, 52Âº38.872'N, 88Âº39.194'E, 550 m a.s.l.) located along Mrassy River in the northern Altai Mountains, Siberia, Russia were collected in the summer of 2016 for paleoclimate reconstruction. HOP-1 is a 21-cm long stalagmite which contains very low U content (238U = 70 ppb) and relatively high Th content (232Th = 2 9.3 ppb), resulting in unsuccessful 230Th/U dating (-262 Â± 284 yr BP in the top and -19,935 Â± 22,246 yr BP). Thirty one AMS 14C dates from 27 horizons of the stalagmite provide a detailed chronology, showing that the stalagmite grew from 6,350 Â± 45 yr BP to 490 Â± 10 Calib. yr BP. Both LUN-1 and LUN-2 are about 20-cm long. The growth feature of LUN-2 is similar to that of HOP-1 with continuous growth, clear bands of depositional cycles in white non-transparent calcite, whereas LUN-1 has light yellow transparent calcite in the center part with multiple growth hiatuses. The 230Th/U dates show that LUN-1 from 2725 Â± 775 yr BP at 193 mm depth to 823 Â± 28 yr BP at 12 mm depth with very fast growth rate during 900 1500 yr BP. The AMS 14C dates of LUN-1 provide similar growth pattern with very fast growth between the first hiatus at 12 mm depth and the second hiatus at 155 cm depth. Six 14C dates from this fast growth period are all around 1500 Calib. yr BP without a correct age sequence. Two 14C dates from the top 12 mm exhibit \"nuclear bomb signal\" (percentage of modern carbon >100%). Similar ages of AMS 14C and 230Th/U dating results in the lower part indicate that dead carbon influence in radiocarbon ages are negligible. 230Th/U dating is not successful for LUN-2. The preliminary AMS 14C dating on LUN-2 shows that the stalagmite continuously deposited from 13335 Â± 150 Calib. yr BP. All three stalagmites do not have growth deposition during the Little Ice Age due to cold and dry climates.

The 1100-km-long section crosses the southern margin of the Chinese Altai Mountains, Junggar Accretional Belt and eastern Junggar basin, easternmost Tianshan Mountains, and easternmost Tarim basin. The crustal velocity structure and Poisson's ratio (??), which provide a constraint on crustal composition, were determined from P and S wave data. Despite the complex geology, the crustal thickness along the entire profile is nearly uniform at 50 km. The thickest crust (56 km) occurs at the northern end of the profile beneath the Altai Mountains and the thinnest (46 km) crust is beneath the Junggar basin. Beneath surficial sediments, the crust is found to have three layers with P wave velocities (Vp) of 6.0-6.3, 6.3-6.6, and 6.9-7.0 km/s, respectively. The southern half of the profile, including the eastern Tianshan Mountains and eastern margin of the Tarim basin, shows low P wave velocities and ?? = 0.25 to a depth of 30 km, which suggests a quartz-rich, granitic upper crustal composition. The northern half of the profile below the Altai Mountains and Junggar Accretional Belt has a higher Poisson's ratio of ?? = 0.26-0.27 to a depth of 30 km, indicative of an intermediate crustal composition. The entire 1100-km-long profile is underlain by a 15-30 km thick high velocity (6.9-7.0 km/s; ?? = 0.26-0.28) lower-crustal layer that we interpret to have a bulk composition of mafic granulite. At the southern end of the profile, a 5-km-thick midcrustal low-velocity layer (Vp = 5.9 km/s, ?? = 0.25) underlies the Tianshan and the region to the south, and may be indicative of a near-horizontal detachment interface. Pn velocities are ???7.7-7.8 km/s between the Tianshan and the Junggar basin, and ???7.9-8.0 km/s below the Altai Mountains and eastern margin of the Tarim basin. We interpret the consistent three-layer stratification of the crust to indicate that the crust\n\nFallout traces of the Fukushima NPP accident in southern West Siberia (Novosibirsk, Russia).\n\nPubMed\n\nMelgunov, M S; Pokhilenko, N P; Strakhovenko, V D; Sukhorukov, F V; Chuguevskii, A V\n\n2012-05-01\n\nThe fallout of artificially produced radioactive isotopes has been recorded at a site in southern West Siberia (54Â°50'43.6â³ N, 083Â°06'22.4â³ E, Novosibirsk, Russia).

The (131)I/(134)Cs ratio decreased from 9.0 on 02 April to 1.2 on 27 April, which is consistent with the radioactive decay of (131)I. This fallout can only have originated from the accidental emission of Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant, Japan, in March 2011.\n\nDiversity of mitochondrial DNA lineages in South Siberia.\n\nPubMed\n\nDerenko, M V; Grzybowski, T; Malyarchuk, B A; Dambueva, I K; Denisova, G A; Czarny, J; Dorzhu, C M; Kakpakov, V T; MiÅcicka-Sliwka, D; WoÅºniak, M; Zakharov, I A\n\n2003-09-01\n\nTo investigate the origin and evolution of aboriginal populations of South Siberia, a comprehensive mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis (HVR1 sequencing combined with RFLP typing) of 480 individuals, representing seven Altaic-speaking populations (Altaians, Khakassians, Buryats, Sojots, Tuvinians, Todjins and Tofalars), was performed. Additionally, HVR2 sequence information was obtained for 110 Altaians, providing, in particular, some novel details of the East Asian mtDNA phylogeny. The total sample revealed 81% East Asian (M*, M7, M8, M9, M10, C, D, G, Z, A, B, F, N9a, Y) and 17% West Eurasian (H, U, J, T, I, N1a, X) matrilineal genetic contribution, but with regional differences within South Siberia. The highest influx of West Eurasian mtDNAs was observed in populations from the East Sayan and Altai regions (from 12.5% to 34.5%), whereas in populations from the Baikal region this contribution was markedly lower (less than 10%). The considerable substructure within South Siberian haplogroups B, F, and G, together with the high degree of haplogroup C and D diversity revealed there, allows us to conclude that South Siberians carry the genetic imprint of early-colonization phase of Eurasia. Statistical analyses revealed that South Siberian populations contain high levels of mtDNA diversity and high heterogeneity of mtDNA sequences among populations (Fst = 5.05%) that might be due to geography but not due to language and anthropological features.\n\nDragon Lake, Siberia\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n2002-01-01\n\nNicknamed 'Dragon Lake,' this body of water is formed by the Bratskove Reservoir, built along the Angara river in southern Siberia, near the city of Bratsk.

G.; Kukavskaya, E. A.; Buryak, L. V.; Shvetsov, E.; Kalenskaya, O. P.; Zhila, S.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe Zabaikal region of southern Siberia is characterized by some of the highest fire activity in Russia. There has been a significant increase of fire frequency and burned area in the region over the last two decades due to a combination of high anthropogenic pressure, decreased funding to the forestry sector, and increased fire danger, which was associated with higher frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Central and southern parts of the Zabaikal region where population density is higher and road network is relatively more developed are the most disturbed by fires. Larch stands cover the largest proportion of fire-disturbed lands in the region, while the less common pine and birch stands are characterized by higher fire frequency. About 13% (3.9 M ha) of the total forest area in the Zabaikal region was burned more than once in the 20 years from 1996 to 2015, with many sites burned multiple times. Repeat disturbances led to inadequate tree regeneration on all but the moistest sites. Pine stands on dry soils, which are common in the forest-steppe zone, were the most vulnerable. After repeat burns and over large burned sites we observed transformation of the forests to steppe ecosystems. The most likely causes of insufficient forest regeneration are soil overheating, dominance of tall grasses, and lack of nearby seed sources. Extensive tree plantations have potential to mitigate negative fire impacts; however, due to high fire hazard in the recent decade about half of the plantation area has been burned. Changes in the SWVI index were used to assess postfire reforestation based on a combination of satellite and field data. In the southwestern part of the Zabaikal region, we estimated that reforestation had been hampered over 11% of the forest land area. Regional climate models project increasing temperatures and decreasing precipitation across Siberia by the end of the 21st century, with changes in the Zabaikal region projected to be more than twice the\n\nLate Pleniglacial vegetation in eastern-central Europe: are there modern analogues in Siberia?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMagyari, EnikÅ Katalin; KuneÅ¡, Petr; Jakab, GusztÃ¡v; SÃ¼megi, PÃ¡l; PelÃ¡nkovÃ¡, Barbora; SchÃ¤bitz, Frank; Braun, MihÃ¡ly; ChytrÃ½, Milan\n\n2014-07-01\n\nTo characterize Late Pleniglacial (LPG: 26.5-15 ka cal BP) and particularly Last Glacial Maximum (LGM: 21 Â± 2 ka cal BP) vegetation and climate, fossil pollen assemblages are often compared with modern pollen assemblages. Given the non-analogue climate of the LPG, a key question is how glacial pollen assemblages and thereby vegetation compare with modern vegetation. In this paper we present three LPG pollen records from the Carpathian Basin and the adjoining Carpathian Mountains to address this question and provide a concise compositional characterization of the LPG vegetation. Fossil pollen assemblages were compared with surface pollen spectra from the Altai-Sayan Mountains in southern Siberia. This area shows many similarities with the LPG vegetation of eastern-central Europe, and has long been considered as its best modern analogue. Ordination and analogue matching were used to characterize vegetation composition and find the best analogues. Our results show that few LPG pollen assemblages have statistically significant analogues in southern Siberia. When analogue pairings occur they suggest the predominance of wet and mesic grasslands and dry steppe in the studied region. Wooded vegetation types (continental and suboceanic hemiboreal forest, continental taiga) appear as significant analogues only in a few cases during the LGM and more frequently after 16 ka cal BP. These results suggest that the LPG landscape of the Carpathian Basin was dominated by dry steppe that occurred outside the river floodplains, while wet and mesic grasslands occurred in the floodplains and on other sites influenced by ground water. Woody vegetation mainly occurred in river valleys, on wet north-facing hillsides, and scattered trees were likely also present on the loess plateaus. The dominant woody species were Larix, Pinus sylvestris, Pinus mugo, Pinus cembra, Picea abies, Betula pendula/pubescens, Betula nana, Juniperus, HippophaÃ« rhamnoides, Populus, Salix and Alnus.

Shrinkage of the mountain glacier and two poles is reporting as an observation fact as the actual condition of the cryosphere by warming. There are mass balance reports of the glacier of 80 of world by WGMS (World Glacier Monitoring Service) as a report of the actual condition of glacier mass balance change, and the actual condition of the glacier mass change in world is clarified. In the report of WGMS, after 1980âs the glacier mass balance, in the Europe Alps and the Alaska region are decreases, and in Scandinavia region are increases. On the other hand, the glacier mass balance in the Russia Altai Mountains located in Central Asia has the little change after 1980âs. These are research using the long-term observational data of Russian region of western part of Altai Mountains. The Altai Mountains including Russia, China, and Mongolia Kazakhstan, and there are description to a World Glacier Inventory (WGI) about the glaciers of Russia, China and Kazakhstan area, but the glaciers of a Mongolian area, there are no description to the WGI. There is almost no information on the glacier of a Mongolian Altai region, and there are many unknown points about glacier change of the whole Altai Mountain region. In this research, while research clarified the present condition of glacier distribution of the Mongolia Altai region, the actual condition of a glacier change in recent years was clarified by comparison with the past topographical map. In this research, the glacier area was distinguished based on the satellite image of the Mongolian glacier regions. The used satellite image were 17 Landsat 7 ETM+ in 1999 to 2002. The glacier distinguishes using NDSI (Normalized Difference Snow Index) indexusing Band5 and Band2. The topographical map of the Mongolian area was got based on the distribution information on this satellite glacier area.

They show that water-soluble carbon outflow from the forest litter increases by 21-26% upon a Siberian moth invasion, with this value decreasing to 14% one year later. The burning of forest in an area completely defoliated by the pest leads to changes in the stock, fractional composition, actual acidity, and ash element contents of the litter. The litter-dwelling invertebrate assemblage is almost completely destroyed by fire and begins to recover only after two years.\n\nHorizontal surface-slip distribution through several seismic cycles: The Eastern Bogd fault, Gobi-Altai, Mongolia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKurtz, R.; Klinger, Y.; Ferry, M.; Ritz, J.-F.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe 1957, MW 8.1, Gobi-Altai earthquake, Southern Mongolia, produced a 360-km-long surface rupture along the Eastern Bogd fault. Cumulative offsets of geomorphic features suggest that the Eastern Bogd fault might produce characteristic slip over the last seismic cycles. Using orthophotographs derived from a dataset of historical aerial photographs acquired in 1958, we measured horizontal offsets along two thirds ( 170 km) of the 1957 left-lateral strike-slip surface rupture. We propose a new empirical methodology to extract the average slip for each past earthquake that could be recognized along successive fault segments, to determine the slip distribution associated with successive past earthquakes. Our results suggest that the horizontal slip distribution of the 1957 Gobi-Altai earthquake is fairly flat, with an average offset of 3.5 m Â± 1.3 m. A combination of our lateral measurements with vertical displacements derived from the literature, allows us to re-assess the magnitude of the Gobi-Altai earthquake to be between MW 7.8 and MW 8.2, depending on the depth of the rupture, and related value of the shear modulus. When comparing this magnitude to magnitudes derived from seismic data, it suggests that the rupture may have extended deeper than the 15 km to 20 km usually considered for the seismogenic crust. We observe that some fault segments are more likely than others to record seismic deformation through several seismic cycles, depending on the local rupture complexity and geomorphology. Additionally, our results allow us to model the horizontal slip function for the 1957 Gobi-Altai earthquake and for three previous paleoseismic events along 70% of the studied area. Along about 50% of the fault sections where we could recognize three past earthquakes, our results suggest that the slip per event was similar for each earthquake.\n\nHypogean presumably sister species Quedius repentinus sp. n. from Altai and Q. roma from Sikhote-Alin (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae): a disjunct distribution or poorly sampled Siberia?\n\nPubMed\n\nSalnitska, Maria; Solodovnikov, Alexey\n\n2018-03-12\n\nQuedius (Microsaurus) repentinus sp. n., a new hypogean montane talus-associated species from Altai is described and considered sister to the morphologically and bionomically similar Q.Â (M.) roma Solodovnikov et Hansen, 2016 from Sikhote-Alin. Both species seem more closely related to the Q. (M.) przewalskii species group from the mountains of China than to the Q. (M.) mutilatus species group from Tien-Shan. The identity of Q. (M.) przewalskii Reitter, 1887, a core of the respective species group, is clarified by re-examination of the holotype. The broad gap between the distributions of Quedius repentinus and Q.Â roma is either a noteworthy biogeographic fact pending explanation, or an artefact resulting from poor sampling pending additional records and new species discovery. Inadequate knowledge of the actual diversity and the distributions of the montane hypogean Quedius of the Russian Asia are illustrated by another new hypogean species from Altai. That species, so far known from a single female only, is here reported but not formally described.\n\nOngoing climatic extreme dynamics in Siberia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGordov, E. P.; Shulgina, T. M.; Okladnikov, I. G.; Titov, A. G.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nOngoing global climate changes accompanied by the restructuring of global processes in the atmosphere and biosphere are strongly pronounced in the Northern Eurasia regions, especially in Siberia. Recent investigations indicate not only large changes in averaged climatic characteristics (Kabanov and Lykosov, 2006, IPCC, 2007; Groisman and Gutman, 2012), but more frequent occurrence and stronger impacts of climatic extremes are reported as well (Bulygina et al., 2007; IPCC, 2012: Climate Extremes, 2012; Oldenborh et al., 2013). This paper provides the results of daily temperature and precipitation extreme dynamics in Siberia for the last three decades (1979 - 2012). Their seasonal dynamics is assessed using 10th and 90th percentile-based threshold indices that characterize frequency, intensity and duration of climatic extremes. To obtain the geographical pattern of these variations with high spatial resolution, the sub-daily temperature data from ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis and daily precipitation amounts from APHRODITE JMA dataset were used. All extreme indices and linear trend coefficients have been calculated using web-GIS information-computational platform Climate (http://climate.scert.ru/) developed to support collaborative multidisciplinary investigations of regional climatic changes and their impacts (Gordov et al., 2012). Obtained results show that seasonal dynamics of daily temperature extremes is asymmetric for tails of cold and warm temperature extreme distributions. Namely, the intensity of warming during cold nights is higher than during warm nights, especially at high latitudes of Siberia. The similar dynamics is observed for cold and warm day-time temperatures. Slight summer cooling was observed in the central part of Siberia. It is associated with decrease in warm temperature extremes. In the southern Siberia in winter, we also observe some cooling mostly due to strengthening of the cold temperature extremes.

B.; Aizen, E. M.; Joswiak, D. R.; Surazakov, A. B.; Takeuchi, N.\n\n2007-12-01\n\nThe vast arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia, Mongolia, and Northern China are the world's second largest source of atmospheric mineral dust. In recent years, severe dust storms in Asia have intensified in frequency, duration, and areal coverage. However, limited spatial and temporal extent of aerosol measurements precludes definitive statements to be made regarding relationship between the Asian aerosol generation and climate. It has been well known that glaciers are the natural archives of environmental records related to past climate and aerosol generation. In our research, we utilized central Asian and western Siberia shallow ice-core records recovered from Altai, Tien Shan and Pamir mountain glaciers. Despite the fact that ice-core data may extend climate/aerosol records back in time, their sparse coverage is inadequate to document aerosol spatial distribution. The NASA products from Aura, Terra and Aqua satellite missions address this gap identifying aerosol sources, transport pathways, and area of deposition. The main objective of our research is to evaluate an affect of climate variability on dynamics of Asian aerosol loading to atmosphere and changes in aerosol transport pathways. Dust particle, major and rare earth element analysis from dust aerosols deposited and accumulated in Altai, Tien Shan and Pamir glaciers suggests that loess from Tajikistan, Afghanistan and north-western China are main sources of aerosol loading into the upper troposphere over the central Asia and western Siberia. At the same time, the soluble ionic component of the ice-cores, related to aerosol generated from evaporate deposits, demonstrated both anthropogenic and natural impacts on atmospheric chemistry over these regions. Large perturbations of Ca2+ derived from CaCO3- rich dust transported from Goby Desert to Altai and Tien Shan. Origin and pathway of the ice-core aerosol depositions for the last 10-years were identified through calibrating ice-core records with dust\n\nA Few Issues on the Peat Research in the Altai Mountains\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nInisheva, Lydia I.; Larina, Galina; Shurova, Maya\n\n2010-05-01\n\nAt the present time we carry out complex research of marsh ecosystems in various areas of Gorny Altai to reveal the perspective deposits of peat in the Altai Mountains with the purpose of its use in the medical and recreational spheres. The peat deposits of the Northeastern Altai, Central Altai, and Southeastern Altai are surveyed; the selective chemical analysis of peat and marsh waters is carried out. The group structure of organic substance of various samples of peat is investigated by the method of Institutes of Peat. The toxic metals of Cd, Pb, Hg, Cu, Zn, and As were defined by the method of stripping voltammetry. The region of the Altai Mountains is characterized by the contrastive distribution of some heavy metals and arsenic in a soil cover. This is caused by a variety of petrography and granulometry of soil forming material, and also by a landscape and geochemical situation in the system of vertical zoning. The sources of natural accumulation of heavy metals in the ground might be the deposits of polymetals. In this connection the content of the specified toxic elements in the peat under research has been identified. The peat of the Turochak deposit is characterized by a significant ash content - up to 41,9%; the increased ash content is typical of the Kutyush deposit: from 6,1% up to 19, %. The peat of the Northeastern Altai is referred to non-bitumunous: the content of bitumen makes up less than 5%. In comparison with the European peat the peat under study of the transitive and lowland type is characterized by the significant content of easy hydrolysable substances in the amount of 24,8-41,1%. The amount of the non-hydrolysable rest makes up around 4,3 - 7,4 %. The total content of fulvic acids is less than the content of humic acids by 2,9 - 5,8 times. The high content of humic acids which can reach up to 58 % is characteristic of certain deposits. Humic acids extracted from the peat are characterized, as a rule, by similar IR-spectra.

Kravchinsky et al. (2013) presume that the 1000- and 500-year periodicities recorded in magnetic properties of soil layers correspond to solar activity induced climate changes in Southern Siberia; however, Stuiver&Braziunas (1993) relate the ~500-yr cycle to flux oscillations in the Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation. The Ë210-year periodicities may reflect the ~200-year solar de Vries cycle that is commonly believed to be one of the most intense solar cycles (e.g. Wagner G. et al., 2001; Damon&Peristykh, 2000; Stuiver&Braziunas, 1993). Dendrochronlogical data obtained from the Tien Shan and Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau confirm the existence of 200-year climatic cycles associated with solar activity in Central Asia (Raspopov et al., 2008). Absence of 1500-year climatic cycles (Bond events) in Tel 2006 record may be explained by deep intercontinental location of the Lake Teletskoye whereas 1500-year cycles are linked with the North Atlantic oceanic circulation (Bond et al., 2001; Debret et al., 2007).\n\nTestate amoebae analysis in the peat deposits of the swamp Dolgonâkoye in the south of Western Siberia and peatland paleohydrology for last 3100 years\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKurina, Irina V.; Blyakharchuk, Tatiana A.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nOur research is devoted to paleohydrological reconstruction in the swamp located in the river valley on the piedmont of the Altai Mountains in the south of Western Siberia. The reconstruction was carried out based on rhizopod analysis for the last 3100 cal yr. A large amount of different testate amoebae was found in the peat. Total 64 testate amoebae taxa were recorded in the peat core with the most abundant being: Trinema lineare, Centropyxis aculeata, C. aerophila, Euglypha rotunda, Cryptodifflugia sp. Decrease of surface wetness in the swamp are observed 2280, 2140, 1900â600 cal yr BP and increase â in 2700, 2500â1900, 230â215 cal yr BP. The results of our reconstruction of the swamp paleohydrology agrees well with the paleoclimatic data obtained earlier for the central area of the south of Western Siberia Plain. It indicates a high sensitivity of the swamp to climatic changes in the Holocene. The rhizopod analysis proved to be very effective when used for paleohydrology reconstruction in minerotrophic peat.\n\nEarthquake-triggered liquefaction in Southern Siberia and surroundings: a base for predictive models and seismic hazard estimation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLunina, Oksana\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe forms and location patterns of soil liquefaction induced by earthquakes in southern Siberia, Mongolia, and northern Kazakhstan in 1950 through 2014 have been investigated, using field methods and a database of coseismic effects created as a GIS MapInfo application, with a handy input box for large data arrays. Statistical analysis of the data has revealed regional relationships between the magnitude (Ms) of an earthquake and the maximum distance of its environmental effect to the epicenter and to the causative fault (Lunina et al., 2014). Estimated limit distances to the fault for the Ms = 8.1 largest event are 130 km that is 3.5 times as short as those to the epicenter, which is 450 km. Along with this the wider of the fault the less liquefaction cases happen. 93% of them are within 40 km from the causative fault. Analysis of liquefaction locations relative to nearest faults in southern East Siberia shows the distances to be within 8 km but 69% of all cases are within 1 km. As a result, predictive models have been created for locations of seismic liquefaction, assuming a fault pattern for some parts of the Baikal rift zone. Base on our field and world data, equations have been suggested to relate the maximum sizes of liquefaction-induced clastic dikes (maximum width, visible maximum height and intensity index of clastic dikes) with Ms and local shaking intensity corresponding to the MSK-64 macroseismic intensity scale (Lunina and Gladkov, 2015). The obtained results make basis for modeling the distribution of the geohazard for the purposes of prediction and for estimating the earthquake parameters from liquefaction-induced clastic dikes. The author would like to express their gratitude to the Institute of the Earth's Crust, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences for providing laboratory to carry out this research and Russian Scientific Foundation for their financial support (Grant 14-17-00007).\n\nEcosystem resilience to abrupt late Quaternary change in continental southern Siberia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHarding, Poppy; Mackay, Anson; Bezrukova, Elena; Shchetnikov, Alexander\n\n2017-04-01\n\nQuaternary climate variability is dominated by long term orbital forcing along with abrupt sub-Milankovitch events on the scales of millennia to centuries, driven by internal feedback mechanisms, volcanic forcing and fluctuating solar activity. Although these are well documented in the North Atlantic region, their expression is poorly understood in Siberia, particularly in relation to abrupt climatic events. Siberia has the world's highest level of continentality offering an opportunity to study changes remote from oceanic influences and improving understanding of interactions between the Siberian High and other atmospheric systems including the Aleutian Low, Arctic oscillation and Icelandic Low1 and ENSO2. Understanding of palaeoenvironmental change in Siberia is essential due to the region's high sensitivity to climatic change, with warming rates considerably higher than the global average over the past 50 years3, triggering significant environmental changes, including permafrost degradation, shifts in the forest-steppe biome, increases in forest fires and warming of seasonally ice-covered lakes. Additionally, the region provides essential palaeoenvironmental context for early hominins, for example at globally important sites such as Denisova cave4, and megafauna extinctions5. This presentation outlines ongoing work at Lake Baunt, SE Siberia including: key quaternary climate forcings, the site and its regional context, the key methods and preliminary results. These include a dated record back to Ë30ka BP (based on multiple 14C dates and Bayesian age modelling), multiproxy indicators of palaeoproductivity (e.g. biogenic silica and diatom analyses) and lake mixing regimes (inferred from diatom analyses). Together these highlight several key Quaternary fluctuations potentially correlated to events recorded in Greenland Ice Cores (GS2, GS2.1, GI1, GS1), and these are considered against key Quaternary records including those from nearby Lake Baikal and Hulu Cave in\n\nMolecular & genetic characteristics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains circulating in the southern part of West Siberia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPasechnik, Oksana; Dymova, Maya Alexandrovna; Stasenko, Vladimir Leonidovich; Blokh, Aleksey Igorevich; Tatarintseva, Marina Petrovna; Kolesnikova, Lyubov Pavlovna; Filipenko, Maksim Leonidovich\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground & objectives: A complicated epidemiological situation characterized by significantly high tuberculosis (TB) morbidity is observed in West Siberia. This study was aimed to investigate the genetic characteristics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis circulating in the southern part of West Siberia (in the Omsk region). Methods: From March 2013 to January 2015, 100 isolates of M. tuberculosis were obtained from patients with pulmonary TB living in the Omsk region. Drug susceptibility testing was performed on Lowenstein-Jensen medium (absolute concentration method). Genetic typing of isolates was carried out by variable number tandem repeats of mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRU-VNTR) typing and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. The genetic types and characteristics of cluster strains were determined using 15 MIRU-VNTR loci. Results: Thirty six VNTR types were found. Twenty six (26.0%) isolates had a unique profile, and the remaining 74 were grouped in 10 clusters containing from 2 to 23 isolates. The Beijing genotype was found in 72 isolates, 61 (85.0%) of which were part of five clusters that included two large clusters containing 23 isolates. Other genetic families, such as Latin-American Mediterranean (LAM, 11.0%), S family (2.0%) and Haarlem (4.0%), were also detected. The genetic family of 11 isolates could not be determined. Six different VNTR profiles were found in these non-classified isolates. Only 16 per cent of isolates were sensitive to anti-TB drugs. The katG315 (94.8%) and rpoB531 (92.2%) mutations were identified in 77 multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates. Interpretation & conclusions: This study showed that the M. tuberculosis population in the Omsk region was heterogeneous. The Beijing genotype predominated and was actively spreading. The findings obtained point to the need for the implementation of more effective preventive measures to stop the spread of drug-resistant M\n\nHolocene carbon dynamics at the forest-steppe ecotone of southern Siberia.\n\nPubMed\n\nMackay, Anson William; Seddon, Alistair W R; Leng, Melanie J; Heumann, Georg; Morley, David W; Piotrowska, Natalia; Rioual, Patrick; Roberts, Sarah; Swann, George E A\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThe forest-steppe ecotone in southern Siberia is highly sensitive to climate change; global warming is expected to push the ecotone northwards, at the same time resulting in degradation of the underlying permafrost. To gain a deeper understanding of long-term forest-steppe carbon dynamics, we use a highly resolved, multiproxy, palaeolimnological approach, based on sediment records from Lake Baikal. We reconstruct proxies that are relevant to understanding carbon dynamics including carbon mass accumulation rates (CMAR; g C m -2 Â yr -1 ) and isotope composition of organic matter (Î´ 13 C TOC ). Forest-steppe dynamics were reconstructed using pollen, and diatom records provided measures of primary production from near- and off-shore communities. We used a generalized additive model (GAM) to identify significant change points in temporal series, and by applying generalized linear least-squares regression modelling to components of the multiproxy data, we address (1) What factors influence carbon dynamics during early Holocene warming and late Holocene cooling? (2) How did carbon dynamics respond to abrupt sub-Milankovitch scale events? and (3) What is the Holocene carbon storage budget for Lake Baikal. CMAR values range between 2.8 and 12.5Â g C m -2 Â yr -1 . Peak burial rates (and greatest variability) occurred during the early Holocene, associated with melting permafrost and retreating glaciers, while lowest burial rates occurred during the neoglacial. Significant shifts in carbon dynamics at 10.3, 4.1 and 2.8 kyr bp provide compelling evidence for the sensitivity of the region to sub-Milankovitch drivers of climate change. We estimate that 1.03 Pg C was buried in Lake Baikal sediments during the Holocene, almost one-quarter of which was buried during the early Holocene alone. Combined, our results highlight the importance of understanding the close linkages between carbon cycling and hydrological processes, not just temperatures, in southern Siberian environments\n\n[A NATURAL PLAGUE FOCUS.

It describes a wide range of biological processes occurring in the focus and shows the most important patterns of its functioning as a complex multilevel ecological system. The key features of the formation of the focus have been revealed. The plague focus in South-Western Altai has formed relatively, recently, about half a century ago, then it has intensively developed and its enzootic area and the activity of epizootic manifestations have considerably increased. This process is due to the space-time transformations of the basic ecological and population characteristics of Pallas' pika (Ochotoma pallasi), the principal vector of the pathogen of plague and fleas parasitizing the mammal, which is in turn related to the aridization of mountain steppes in South-Western Altai.\n\nTracing the origin of the east-west population admixture in the Altai region (Central Asia).\n\nPubMed\n\nGonzÃ¡lez-Ruiz, Mercedes; Santos, Cristina; Jordana, Xavier; SimÃ³n, Marc; Lalueza-Fox, Carles; Gigli, Elena; Aluja, Maria Pilar; Malgosa, AssumpciÃ³\n\n2012-01-01\n\nA recent discovery of Iron Age burials (Pazyryk culture) in the Altai Mountains of Mongolia may shed light on the mode and tempo of the generation of the current genetic east-west population admixture in Central Asia. Studies on ancient mitochondrial DNA of this region suggest that the Altai Mountains played the role of a geographical barrier between West and East Eurasian lineages until the beginning of the Iron Age. After the 7th century BC, coinciding with Scythian expansion across the Eurasian steppes, a gradual influx of East Eurasian sequences in Western steppes is detected. However, the underlying events behind the genetic admixture in Altai during the Iron Age are still unresolved: 1) whether it was a result of migratory events (eastward firstly, westward secondly), or 2) whether it was a result of a local demographic expansion in a 'contact zone' between European and East Asian people. In the present work, we analyzed the mitochondrial DNA lineages in human remains from Bronze and Iron Age burials of Mongolian Altai. Here we present support to the hypothesis that the gene pool of Iron Age inhabitants of Mongolian Altai was similar to that of western Iron Age Altaians (Russia and Kazakhstan). Thus, this people not only shared the same culture (Pazyryk), but also shared the same genetic east-west population admixture. In turn, Pazyryks appear to have a similar gene pool that current Altaians. Our results further show that Iron Age Altaians displayed mitochondrial lineages already present around Altai region before the Iron Age. This would provide support for a demographic expansion of local people of Altai instead of westward or eastward migratory events, as the demographic event behind the high population genetic admixture and diversity in Central Asia.\n\nTracing the Origin of the East-West Population Admixture in the Altai Region (Central Asia)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGonzÃ¡lez-Ruiz, Mercedes; Santos, Cristina; Jordana, Xavier; SimÃ³n, Marc; Lalueza-Fox, Carles; Gigli, Elena; Aluja, Maria Pilar; Malgosa, AssumpciÃ³\n\n2012-01-01\n\nA recent discovery of Iron Age burials (Pazyryk culture) in the Altai Mountains of Mongolia may shed light on the mode and tempo of the generation of the current genetic east-west population admixture in Central Asia.

A combined geochemical and detrital zircon study was conducted on the (meta-)sedimentary sequences from the Russian Altai to reveal the tectono-magmatic history of these two terranes and their amalgamation history, which in turn place constraints on the accretionary orogenesis and crustal growth in the CAOB. The Cambrian-Ordovician meta-sedimentary rocks from the northern AM are dominated by immature sediments possibly sourced from intermediate-felsic igneous rocks. Geochemical data show that the sediments were likely deposited in a continental arc-related setting. Zircons separated from these rocks are mainly 566-475 Ma and 1015-600 Ma old, comparable to the magmatic records of the Tuva-Mongolian terrane and surrounding island arcs in the western Mongolia. The similar source nature, provenance and depositional setting of these rocks to the counterparts from the Chinese Altai (i.e., the southern AM) imply that the whole AM possibly represents a coherent accretionary prism of the western Mongolia in the early Paleozoic rather than a Precambrian continental block with passive marginal deposition as previously thought. In contrast, the Cambrian to Silurian (meta-)sedimentary rocks from the GA are characterized by a unitary zircon population with ages of 640-470 Ma, which were potentially sourced from the Kuznetsk-Altai intra-oceanic island arc in the east of this terrane. The low abundance of 640-540 Ma zircons (5%) may attest that this arc was under a primitive stage in the late Neoproterozoic, when mafic igneous rocks dominated. However, the voluminous 530-470 Ma zircons (95%) suggest that this arc possibly evolved toward a mature one in the Cambrian to early Ordovician with increasing amount of\n\nThree centuries of Eastern European and Altai lead emissions recorded in a Belukha ice core.\n\nPubMed\n\nEichler, Anja; Tobler, Leonhard; Eyrikh, Stella; Gramlich, Gabriela; Malygina, Natalia; Papina, Tatyana; Schwikowski, Margit\n\n2012-04-17\n\nHuman activities have significantly altered atmospheric Pb concentrations and thus, its geochemical cycle, for thousands of years. Whereas historical Pb emissions from Western Europe, North America, and Asia are well documented, there is no equivalent data for Eastern Europe. Here, we present ice-core Pb concentrations for the period 1680-1995 from Belukha glacier in the Siberian Altai, assumed to be representative of emissions in Eastern Europe and the Altai. Pb concentrations and (207)Pb/(206)Pb ratios were strongly enhanced during the period 1935-1995 due to the use of Pb additives in Russian gasoline mined in the Rudny Altai. Comparable to Western Europe and North America, Eastern European Pb emissions peaked in the 1970s. However, the subsequent downward trend in Eastern Europe was mainly caused by the economic crisis in the U.S.S.R. and not by a phase-out of leaded gasoline. Pb concentrations in the period 1680-1935, preceding the era of intensified industrialization in Russia, reflect the history of local emissions from Rudny Altai mining and related metallurgical processing primarily for the production of Russian coins. During this time, Altai ore Pb contributed about 40% of the regional atmospheric Pb.\n\nThe burden of tick-borne diseases in the Altai region of Russia.\n\nPubMed\n\nDedkov, V G; Simonova, E G; Beshlebova, O V; Safonova, M V; Stukolova, O A; Verigina, E V; Savinov, G V; Karaseva, I P; Blinova, E A; Granitov, V M; Arsenjeva, I V; Shipulin, G A\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThis article presents the results of a comprehensive survey of the burden of tick-borne infectious diseases (TBIDs) in the Altai region of Russia. Official data for TBID incidence were analyzed and 201 samples from patients with suspected TBID were studied. Furthermore, questing ticks and ticks recovered from humans were examined to estimate prevalence of TBID-causative agents. The Altai region was determined to have a heightened risk for TBIDs in Russia. The most epidemiologically significant tick-borne illness in this area is spotted fever group rickettsiosis, while nationally in Russia, the leading TBID is Lyme borreliosis. The prevalence of mixed infection was 12.4% among the studied cases. Additionally, the prevalence of poorly studied pathogens - Kemerovo virus (KEMV) and Rickettsia tarasevichiae - in ticks from the Altai region was determined. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

These samples come from a number of sites that fall into two groupings. Seven samples are from three sites, dating to the 8th-12th century AD, that belong to a northern group of what are thought to be Ugrians, who lived along the Ural Mountains in northwestern Siberia. The remaining seven samples are from two sites that belong to a southern group representing the Sargat culture, dating between roughly the 5th century BC and the 5th century AD, from southwestern Siberia near the Ural Mountains and the present-day Kazakhstan border. The samples are derived from several burial types, including kurgan burials. They also represent a number of different skeletal elements and a range of observed preservation. The northern sites repeatedly failed to amplify after multiple extraction and amplification attempts, but the samples from the southern sites were successfully extracted and amplified. The sequences obtained from the southern sites support the hypothesis that the Sargat culture was a potential zone of intermixture between native Ugrian and/or Siberian populations and steppe peoples from the south, possibly early Iranian or Indo-Iranian, which has been previously suggested by archaeological analysis.\n\nCurrent state of the Altai glaciers (Russia) and trends over the period of instrumental observations 1952-2008.\n\nPubMed\n\nNarozhniy, Yuriy; Zemtsov, Valeriy\n\n2011-09-01\n\nResults of research into climate and glacier dynamics in the Altai Mountains (Russia) over the period of instrumental observations (1952-2008) are presented in this article.

The average summer air temperature in different regions of the Altai has increased during the study period from about 0.2 degrees C (Aktru) to 1.1 degrees C (Akkem). The annual atmospheric precipitation rate has also increased, by 8-10%. Since 1952, the glacier area in different regions of the Altai has decreased by 9-27%, and volume by 12-24%.

It represents a combination of landscapes and ecosystems of alpine highlands, vast plateau-topped watersheds and intermountain depressions with unique archeological sites and traditional forms of environmental management of different cultures. The SE Altai has been inhabited since the Palaeolithic but till now the issue of chronology of the archaeological cultures is still debated. From the beginning of the 1st millennium BC, these can be generally regarded as a single economic-cultural type - nomads of arid piedmonts and mountains of temperate zone. The collective evidence indicates the significantly warmer climate in the SE Altai during the early Holocene. The Neoglacial began here about 5000 years BP and includes three periods of glaciers expansions controlled by climate deterioration (Akkem, Historical and Aktru (LIA) stages). Our numerous radiocarbon dates of fossil soils and wood fragments buried in moraines, glaciofluvial sediments and proglacial forefields argue for prolonged and frequent glacier advances separated by shorter glacier recessions. A decrease in the areas occupied by forest vegetation and the reduction in glacier size at each subsequent glacial stage expressed in the topography suggest aridity intensification during the second half of the Holocene. This conclusion is also supported by the absence of a reaction from the glaciers to the thermal minimum of the middle of 19-th century. It is very likely that such glacier dynamics is a common feature for the whole Central Asia. Thus the evolution of Altai nomad cultures, discussed in this paper, corresponds to a period of cooling and aridity intensification. In spite of climate deterioration that was the time of prosperity of the Altai nomadic cultures. It is most richly characterized by numerical dates of\n\n[Toxocariasis in the Republic of Altai.

The data of the authors' observations ofToxocara infection in animals (cats, dogs), soil contamination with helminth eggs, and prevalence of human toxocariasis in the Republic of Altai, by considering the results of tests for antibodies against its pathogen in the inhabitants of the region, were automatically processed using geoinformation mapping simulation, which yielded a mapping model to rank the region's area by morbidity rates. The use of up-to-date computers and geo information systems makes it possible to systematize information on this invasion and to see major foci of the disease to reveal the reasons for their assignment to the specific type of the region's landscape.\n\nNeoproterozoic-Early Paleozoic Peri-Pacific Accretionary Evolution of the Mongolian Collage System: Insights From Geochemical and U-Pb Zircon Data From the Ordovician Sedimentary Wedge in the Mongolian Altai\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJiang, Y. D.; Schulmann, K.; KrÃ¶ner, A.; Sun, M.; Lexa, O.; JanouÅ¡ek, V.; BuriÃ¡nek, D.; Yuan, C.; HanÅ¾l, P.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nNeoproterozoic to early Paleozoic accretionary processes of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt have been evaluated so far mainly using the geology of ophiolites and/or magmatic arcs. Thus, the knowledge of the nature and evolution of associated sedimentary prisms remains fragmentary. We carried out an integrated geological, geochemical, and zircon U-Pb geochronological study on a giant Ordovician metasedimentary succession of the Mongolian Altai Mountains. This succession is characterized by dominant terrigenous components mixed with volcanogenic material. It is chemically immature, compositionally analogous to graywacke, and marked by significant input of felsic to intermediate arc components, pointing to an active continental margin depositional setting. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages suggest a source dominated by products of early Paleozoic magmatism prevailing during the Cambrian-Ordovician and culminating at circa 500 Ma. We propose that the Ordovician succession forms an \"Altai sedimentary wedge,\" the evolution of which can be linked to the geodynamics of the margins of the Mongolian Precambrian Zavhan-Baydrag blocks. This involved subduction reversal from southward subduction of a passive continental margin (Early Cambrian) to the development of the \"Ikh-Mongol Magmatic Arc System\" and the giant Altai sedimentary wedge above a north dipping subduction zone (Late Cambrian-Ordovician). Such a dynamic process resembles the tectonic evolution of the peri-Pacific accretionary Terra Australis Orogen. A new model reconciling the Baikalian metamorphic belt along the southern Siberian Craton with peri-Pacific Altai accretionary systems fringing the Mongolian microcontinents is proposed to explain the Cambro-Ordovician geodynamic evolution of the Mongolian collage system.\n\nLate Cambrian - Early Ordovician turbidites of Gorny Altai (Russia): Compositions, sources, deposition settings, and tectonic implications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKruk, Nikolai N.; Kuibida, Yana V.; Shokalsky, Sergey P.; Kiselev, Vladimir I.; Gusev, Nikolay I.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe Cambrian-Ordovician transition was the time of several key events in the history of Central Asia. They were the accretion of Mariana-type island arc systems to the Siberian continent, the related large-scale orogeny and intrusions of basaltic and granitic magma and the formation of a huge turbidite basin commensurate with the Bengal Gulf basin in the western part of the Central Asian orogenic belt (CAOB). The structure of the basin, as well as the sources and environments of deposition remain open to discussion. This paper presents new major- and trace-element data on Late-Cambrian-Early Ordovician turbidites from different parts of the Russian Altai and a synthesis of Nd isotope composition and ages of detrital zircons. The turbidites share chemical similarity with material shed from weathered continental arcs. Broad variations of CIA (39-73) and ICV (0.63-1.66) signatures in sandstones suggest origin from diverse sources and absence of significant sorting. Trace elements vary considerably and have generally similar patterns in rocks from different terranes. On the other hand, there are at least two provinces according to Nd isotope composition and age of detrital zircons. Samples from eastern Russian Altai contain only Phanerozoic zircons and have Nd isotope ratios similar to those in Early Cambrian island arcs (ÎµNdt + 4.4â¦ + 5.4; TNd(DM)-2-st = 0.8-0.9 Ga). Samples from central, western, and southern parts of Russian Altai contain Precambrian zircons (some as old as Late Archean) and have a less radiogenic Nd composition (ÎµNdt up to -3.6; TNd(DM)-2-st up to 1.5 Ga). The chemical signatures of Late Cambrian to Early Ordovician turbidites indicate a provenance chemically more mature than the island arc rocks, and the presence of zircons with 510-490 Ma ages disproves their genetic relation with island arcs. The turbidite basin formed simultaneously with peaks of granitic and alkali-basaltic magmatism in the western Central Asian orogen and resulted from\n\nA Bi-hemispheric perspective on the last glacial termination from the Southern Alps of New Zealand and the Altai Mountains of western Mongolia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStrand, P.; Putnam, A. E.; Schaefer, J. M.; Denton, G.; Putnam, D.; Barrell, D.; Schwartz, R.; Sambuu, O.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe last glacial termination ( 18,000 - 11,000 yrs ago) represents the last great global warming and the last time CO2 rose by a substantial amount before the industrial period. Understanding the processes that drove this glacial to interglacial transition will help refine the global climate system sensitivity to CO2 and will place ongoing global warming into a paleoclimatic context. Here, we test possible drivers of the last glacial termination by comparing chronologies of mountain glacier recession in the middle latitudes of both polar hemispheres. Extra-polar mountain glaciers are highly sensitive to changes in atmospheric temperature. Thus glacier landforms, such as moraine ridges constructed along glacier margins, afford quantitative insight into past climate conditions. We present 10Be surface-exposure chronologies and glacial geomorphologic maps of mountain glacier recession since the Last Glacial Maximum in the Southern Alps of New Zealand (44Â°S, 170Â°E) and in the Altai Mountains of western Mongolia (49Â°N, 88Â°E). On the basis of these chronologies from opposing hemispheres, we will evaluate the relative roles of rising atmospheric CO2, local insolation forcing, and ocean-atmosphere reorganizations in driving the warming that ended the last ice age.\n\nSpace geodetic investigation of the co- and post-seismic deformation due to the 2003 Mw7.3 Altai (Russia) earthquake: Implications for the local lithospheric rheology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHamiel, Y.; Barbot, S.; Fialko, Y.\n\n2006-12-01\n\nWe use ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar data and SPOT optical imagery to investigate the co- seismic and post-seismic deformation due to the September 27th 2003, Mw7.3 Altai earthquake that occurred in the Chuya Basin area near the Russia-China-Mongolia border. Based on the SAR and SPOT data we determined the location of the ruptured fault trace and developed a co-seismic slip model for the Altai earthquake. The geodetic moment from our slip model was found to be consistent with the seismic moment determined from the teleseismic data. While the epicentral area of the Altai earthquake is not optimal for radar interferometry (in particular, due to temporal decorrelation), we were able to detect the post-seismic relaxation signal over a time period of 2.5 years following the earthquake. The signal is robust in that it allows us to discriminate between several commonly considered mechanisms of post-seismic relaxation. We find that the post-earthquake InSAR data do not warrant poro-elastic rebound in the upper crust, or simple Maxwellian visco-elastic relaxation in the upper mantle. The data can be explained in terms of afterslip on a downdip extension of the earthquake rupture, non-linear visco-elastic rheology of the ductile substrate (kinematically, similar to afterslip at early stages of relaxation), or the bulk visco-elastic relaxation in the lower crust. Continued InSAR observations may further constrain the mechanisms driving the post-seismic relaxation. The observed post-seismic deformation due to the Altai earthquake is qualitatively different from deformation due to other similar-size earthquakes (in particular, the Landers and Hector Mine earthquakes in the Mojave desert, southern California). These variations in the deformation pattern may be indicative of different rheologic structure of the continental lithosphere in different tectonically active areas.\n\nProjections of glacier change in the Altai Mountains under twenty-first century climate scenarios\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Yong; Enomoto, Hiroyuki; Ohata, Tetsuo; Kitabata, Hideyuki; Kadota, Tsutomu; Hirabayashi, Yukiko\n\n2016-11-01\n\nWe project glacier surface mass balances of the Altai Mountains over the period 2006-2100 for the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios using daily near-surface air temperature and precipitation from 12 global climate models in combination with a surface mass balance model. The results indicate that the Altai glaciers will undergo sustained mass loss throughout the 21st for both RCPs and reveal the future fate of glaciers of different sizes. By 2100, glacier area in the region will shrink by 26 Â± 10 % for RCP4.5, while it will shrink by 60 Â± 15 % for RCP8.5. According to our simulations, most disappearing glaciers are located in the western part of the Altai Mountains. For RCP4.5, all glaciers disappearing in the twenty-first century have a present-day size smaller than 5.0 km2, while for RCP8.5, an additional 7 % of glaciers in the initial size class of 5.0-10.0 km2 also vanish. We project different trends in the total meltwater discharge of the region for the two RCPs, which does not peak before 2100, with important consequences for regional water availability, particular for the semi-arid and arid regions. This further highlights the potential implications of change in the Altai glaciers on regional hydrology and environment.\n\nLate-Paleozoic-Mesozoic deformational and deformation related metamorphic structures o"
