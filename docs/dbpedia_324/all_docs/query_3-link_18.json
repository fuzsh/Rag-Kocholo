        "text": "List of heat waves\n\nA number of heat waves began across parts of the northern hemisphere in April 2023, many of which are ongoing. Various heat records have been broken,[1] with July being the hottest month ever recorded.[2]\n\nScientists have attributed the heat waves to man-made climate change.[1][2] Another cause is the El Niño phenomena which began to develop in 2023.[3] However, recent findings show that climate change is exacerbating the strength of El Niño.[4]\n\nThe heatwaves caused severe damage in areas such as the western United States, southern Europe, and parts of Asia.[5] The abnormal temperatures have led to a \"very extreme\" likelihood of wildfires, according to the Fire Weather Index.[6]\n\nThe heatwaves were also occurring alongside some unusually heavy flooding.[7][8]\n\nIn response to the heatwave some leaders called for greater action to stop climate change.[9] President of the United States Joe Biden has taken some measures to protect the population from extreme heat.[10][11]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nHeat waves are one of the deadliest hazards, and in line with the IPCC prediction their frequency and magnitude are rising due to man-made climate change. The July heat wave in Southern Europe and North America would be virtually impossible and the heat wave in China would be a 1 in 250-year event without climate change. But due to climate change those events are now common.[1]\n\nJuly 2023 was the hottest July on Earth in the last 120,000 years and the hottest July from the beginning of temperature measurement with a wide margin.[2] During each day in July 2023, two billion people experienced heat conditions made at least three times more likely due to climate change and 6.5 billion people experienced this impact at least one day in the month.[5]\n\nAnother cause is the El Niño phenomena which began to develop in 2023. El Niño begin when parts of the Pacific Ocean became warmer than average and generally cause a rise in the global temperature as it \"is moving some of the energy up from depth and dumping it into the atmosphere,\"[3] However, recent findings show that climate change is exacerbating the strength of El Niño. It is increasing \"the \"variability\" of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation\" creating both stronger El Niño and La Niña events.[4]\n\nClimate change may also cause changes in the jet streams that probably contributed to the heat waves. Warming in certain Arctic regions makes the jet stream weaker and wavier, causing different weather patterns to stay longer over the same place.[15]\n\nInternational\n\n[edit]\n\n2023 was the hottest year on record, 1.48 °C warmer than the pre-industrial level.[16]\n\nThe world breached the Paris Agreement 1.5 °C warming mark for a record number of days.[17] From January to September, the global mean temperature was 1.40 °C higher than the pre-industrial average (1850–1900).[18] January 2023 was the seventh warmest on record – 0.25 °C warmer than the normal but 0.33 °C cooler than January 2020.[19] In July, the global average temperature was 17.32 °C (63.17 °F).[20]\n\nOceans\n\n[edit]\n\nAbove-average temperatures in the northeastern South Pacific were recorded in March 2023.[21] The average sea temperature of the North Atlantic Ocean was 19.9 °C (67.8 °F) on 5 March, exceeding the previous record set in 2020 by 0.1 °C. On 5 June, the recorded temperature rose to 22.7 °C (72.9 °F), surpassing a record set in 2010 by 0.1 °C.[22] On 1 August 2023, the average sea surface temperature reached 20.96 °C (69.73 °F), the highest ever recorded.[23] In September, the sea ice in Antarctica was far below any previous recorded winter level.[24]\n\nAfrica\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Africa\n\n[edit]\n\nThere was a three-day heatwave in the Western Mediterranean region, originating in North Africa, from 26 to 28 April. The temperature reached over 40 °C (104 °F) in parts of Morocco and Algeria.[25] Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia still reached temperatures of up to 47 °C (117 °F) on 13 July.[26] Another heat wave hit Tabarka, Tunisia, on 14 July.[27]\n\nData recorded on 18 July showed temperatures of 46.9 °C (116.4 °F) in Tozeur, Tunisia, 47.4 °C (117.3 °F) in Chlef, Algeria (with many other places exceeding 44 °C (111 °F)), and 45.2 °C (113.4 °F) in Kharga, Egypt.[28] There had been a week of power cuts and 40 °C (104 °F) temperatures in Cairo by 19 July.[29]\n\nThe heat wave became even more intense in the following days. Data recorded on 23 July showed temperatures of 48.7 °C (119.7 °F) in Algiers, Algeria, the highest recorded temperature in the city,[30] as well as 49 °C (120 °F) temperatures in Kairouan, Tunisia. On 24 July, Tunis, Tunisia reached a temperature of 48.9 °C (120.0 °F). On 24 July, Ghar el-Melh in northern Tunisia reached a temperature of 50 °C (122 °F).[31]\n\nHeavy rain flooded Al-Marj and Derna on 12 September, killing nearly 250 in Derna, Libya.[32] Up to 20,000 were killed on 14 September, as new floods hit Bengazi, Libya.[33]\n\nSub-Saharan Africa\n\n[edit]\n\nData recorded on 18 July showed temperatures of 45.8 °C (114.4 °F) in the Faya station, Chad and 44.4 °C (111.9 °F) temperatures in Bilma, Niger.[28] 20 July saw temperatures suddenly drop to a seasonal low.[34]\n\nAsia\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 2023 Asia heat wave\n\nMiddle East\n\n[edit]\n\nA heat wave in early June hit Israel, with temperatures between 35 °C (95 °F) in Jerusalem and 45 °C (113 °F) in the Jordan Valley. Along with high winds, the heat wave caused hundreds of bushfires. Roads and some buildings were evacuated amid rolling electricity outages on 2 July. Firefighters quickly controlled the fires, limiting property damage.[35] In Iran, a 66.7 °C (152.1 °F) heat index was recorded at Persian Gulf International Airport on 16 July.[36] Al Ahsa, Saudi Arabia recorded 50.5 °C (122.9 °F) on 18 July.[28]\n\nA local record rainfall was recorded as around 125 kilograms per square meter of rainfall (equivalent to the usual amount for the whole of September) hit Istanbul in under 6 hours on 7 September according to the city's governor as heavy rain fell across north west Turkey's Black Sea coast.[37] Floods also hit houses areas in Igneada district of Kirklareli, Turkey on that day.[37] Heavy rainstorms triggered flash floods across northwest Turkey, killing at least 6 according to the state broadcaster, TRT Haber.[37]\n\nOther parts of Asia\n\n[edit]\n\nFebruary 2023 was recorded as the warmest February in India for 122 years.[38] Starting in April 2023, a record-breaking heat wave in Asia has affected multiple countries, including India, China, Laos and Thailand.[39][40] Turkmenistan recorded 42 °C (108 °F) temperatures in early April.[41] The European Union's Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service said on 26 April that fires started in May continued to burn from Russia's Chelyabinsk, Omsk and Novosibirsk Oblasts, Primorye Krai, Kazakhstan and Mongolia.[42] Temperatures over 40 °C (104 °F) were recorded in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and China on 31 May.[41]\n\nBeijing hit 40 °C (104 °F) on 6 June after ten days of temperatures above 35 °C (95 °F). The government ordered all employers to stop any outdoor work and for people to work from home if possible.[43] Parts of Mongolia recorded 30 °C (86 °F), especially in eastern steppe and southern Gobi provinces, with a prediction of 38 °C (100 °F) for 21 June, in the Khanbogd Soum.[44] Heatstroke claimed 22 lives in Mardan and Islamabad, Pakistan on 26 June.[45]\n\nOn 16 July, China recorded a record-breaking temperature of 52.2 °C (126.0 °F) at Aydang, Turpan, Xinjiang Province[46] as well as Sanbao, China.[36] Temperatures above 35 °C (95 °F) persisted for four weeks in Beijing.[36] The Japanese government and NHK issued health advice to the general public as heatstroke alerts for 20 of the country's 47 prefectures, mostly east and southwest on 16 July.[47] Temperatures nearing 40 °C (104 °F) were recorded in Kiryu city, Gunma Prefecture, Hachioji in western Tokyo, Hirono town in Fukushima Prefecture and Nasushiobara.[47]\n\nTorrential rain poured down in northern Japan, causing floods and a resultant landslide on 16 July.[47]\n\nThe Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) issued a heat wave warning on the 19th and warned people to expected temperatures of 33 °C for the foreseeable future, with southern Gangwon Province, North Chungcheong Province and some southern regions to see some rain which was expected to be about 5 to 20 millimetres in total depth on the 19th.[48]\n\nOn the 20th a heatwave is declared in Mongolia after temperatures of 38 °C (100 °F) continue in the Khanbogd soum.\n\nJapan's government and Fire and Disaster Management Agency responded to the ongoing excessive heat by issuing more health advisory notices to the public on 19 July. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency's official weekly statistics for 19 July showed 8,189 (4,484 were 65 or over) were hospitalized that week, up 200% compared to the previous week and the same week in 2022. Tokyo had the highest number with 1,066, up 460% compared to 2022. 3,215 got heatstroke at home 1,445 got it outside nationwide. 3 people had also died that week as the heat reached 39 °C in many parts of Japan on 19 July.[49]\n\nSouth Korea and China had reported deadly floods due to unusually heavy rains, leaving several dozen people dead on the 23rd.[50] The record heat continued in Japan and Korea on the 23rd.[50]\n\nThe remnants of Typhoon Doksuri hits Hebei province and Beijing, killing 21 people as it did so. 744.8 millimeters (29.3 inches) of rain fell on Beijing between July 26 and August 2 according to the Beijing Meteorological Bureau as Beijing and the province of Hebei had floods that destroyed roads, knocked out power and cut water pipes.
