        "text": "Extreme thermal conditions appear to occupy an important place among research subjects at a time of climate warming. This study investigates the frequency, duration and spatial extent of thermally anomalous winters in Europe during the 60 years between 1951 and 2010. Exceptionally cold winters (ECWs) and exceptionally mild winters (EMWs) were identified using the statistical criterion of plus/minus two standard deviations from the long-term winter temperature (January-December) recorded at 60 weather stations. It was demonstrated that ECWs have occurred more frequently and covered larger territories than EMWs and that they may occur anywhere in Europe, while EMWs were limited to its southern and western parts. ECWs are characterised by greater absolute temperature anomalies, as anomalies greater than |6.0 °C| account for 35 % of ECWs, but only for 8 % of EMWs. The greatest anomalies are found in the east of the continent. The largest territory affected by an ECW included 24 stations in 1962/1963, while the equivalent among the EMWs included 11 stations in 2006/2007. The study also confirmed an expected trend whereby ECWs diminished in frequency in favour of EMWs in the second half of the 60-year study period.\n\nThe paper reports on a study of extremely cool summers (ECS), a rare but significant phenomenon responsible for various adverse economic effects. These include, in particular, effects on agriculture and the tourist industry. The seasons, their spatial extent and individual characteristics were identified in Central and Eastern Europe. The research was based on average seasonal air temperatures (June to August) and the numbers of days with maximum temperatures >25, 30 and 35 °C and minimum temperatures >20 °C, as recorded at 59 weather stations during the period 1951–2010. An ECS was defined as having an average temperature at least 2 standard deviations (t ≤ tav. − 2σ) lower than the average at a given station during the study period. ECS occurred at only 34 of the 59 stations (58 % of all stations), one or two per station, mainly in the northern part of the study area. Six such seasons were recorded by at least 5 % of all stations in 1962, 1969, 1976, 1978, 1984 and 1994. The average temperature of an ECS was typically 2–3 °C lower than the long-term average. While some ECSs included an extremely cool month, most such seasons (58 %) were defined by low temperatures persisting for long periods in all summer months.\n\nEurope's climate is characterised by the occurrence of deep short-lasting drops in air temperature, which are reflected in anomalously low monthly average temperatures. This study has been undertaken in order to determine the frequency, timing and spatial extent of exceptionally cold winter months at 60 weather stations across Europe. The study was based on monthly average air temperatures recorded by 60 stations between the mid-20th century and 2010. Exceptionally cold winter months (ECMs) are considered to occur when the average air temperature at a given station differs from the respective multi-annual average (1951-2010) by at least 2 standard deviations. It was found that such ECMs are quite frequent in Europe: during the 180 winter months of the six decades of 1951-2010, 67 ECMs occurred at 387 stations, which means that each ECM covered an area with 6 stations on average. In the six decades under study, the highest frequency of ECMs was seen in the first 2 decades -16 and 17 ECMs respectively, and the lowest (7) in the last decade of the 20th century. The individual ECMs extended over areas of various sizes. Their frequency was the lowest in south-west Europe (one ECM), where, behind the barrier of the Alps and the Pyrenees, advection of cold air masses from the north is less frequent. ECMs were relatively rare in the area of the British Isles and the southern and eastern ends of Europe which saw 5 ECMs each in the 60-year period and where such months were not recorded by all the stations. The number of ECMs in the rest of Europe ranged between 7 and 9 with the highest frequency recorded by the area stretching from the Scandinavian Peninsula, across the centre of Europe, to the Balkans. ECMs were also relatively frequent in the easternmost parts of Europe, but none of them covered the entire area, only its bigger or smaller southern or northern parts. In the latter, the monthly average temperatures at many spots dropped below -25°C with temperature anomalies exceeding -10°C, and even -13°C. The ECM of February 1956 had the greatest extent of all comprising 36 out of the 60 stations. It covered the entire south of Europe and stretched across the central part of the continent from the Atlantic to the Ural Mountains. During that ECM, the largest temperature anomaly of -14°C was recorded in Astrakhan which was the largest in the entire period under study. Other exceptionally cold months with a large spatial extent, covering at least one third of the stations (over 20), were February 1954, January 1963 and January 1987.\n\nThe current climate warming phenomenon manifests itself with the occurrence of, among other characteristics, extremely hot months and seasons. Examples include the heat waves of April and May 2018 and of June 2019, which swept through large areas of Europe with considerable damage to nature and the economy. The study looks at thermal anomalies of this kind using average monthly air temperature records from 210 weather stations collected over the period 1951–2018. For the purpose of the study an anomaly was defined as a deviation of the average monthly temperature from the long-term average by at least two standard deviations. An anomaly was considered large-area if it occurred simultaneously at 20 or more stations, which corresponded to about one-tenth of the continent. The study found that positive large-area anomalies were increasingly frequent, some being recorded at 80 stations, and that no cool large-area anomalies were recorded after 2010. Large-area thermal anomalies of both types were the most frequent overall in Central Europe.\n\nThe paper explores exceptional thermal conditions, an area of research that has increased in significance in the context of the changes that are being observed in climate. Specifically, the study addressed the frequency, long-term change and spatial coverage of exceptionally hot summers, and exceptionally cool summers (EHS and ECS) in Europe. The statistical criterion of plus/minus two standard deviations from the long-term average was used to identify EHS and ECS at 60 weather stations over the period 1951-2010. The study has demonstrated that EHS are characterised by greater temperature anomalies than ECS and are approximately twice as frequent. They occurred virtually everywhere within the study area, whilst ECS are concentrated in its northern part. Five EHS (1972, 2002, 2003, 2007, and 2010) and three ECS (1956, 1962, and 1976) were large enough to be recorded by at least 10% of the stations"
