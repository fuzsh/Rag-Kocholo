        "text": "New York and the rest of the US Northeast are about to get seared by a record-breaking heat wave that will boost electricity demand, raise health risks and potentially be a headache for commuters.\n\nManhattanâ€™s Central Park is set to reach 98F (37C) by Friday, the National Weather Service said. The worst of the heat will spread through the Midwest, upstate New York and New England this week before descending on New York City and Washington. A heat advisory will likely be posted Thursday and temperatures may feel closer to 99 by then, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said at a press conference."
