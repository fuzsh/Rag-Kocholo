Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Yekaterinburg is essentially constant during December, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on July 20, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 4% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Yekaterinburg is essentially constant during December, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 7.9 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on April 3, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 8.1 miles per hour, while on July 21, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 5.6 miles per hour.\n\nThe highest daily average wind speed during December is 7.9 miles per hour on December 16.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Yekaterinburg throughout December is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 61% on December 14.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Yekaterinburg typically lasts for 3.6 months (112 days), from around May 24 to around September 13, rarely starting before May 5 or after June 12, and rarely ending before August 24 or after October 2.\n\nThe month of December in Yekaterinburg is reliably fully outside of the growing season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in December in Yekaterinburg\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Yekaterinburg are essentially constant during December, remaining around 1,470Â°F throughout.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Yekaterinburg is essentially constant during December, remaining within 0.1 kWh of 0.4 kWh throughout.\n\nThe lowest average daily incident shortwave solar energy during December is 0.4 kWh on December 23.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in December in Yekaterinburg\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in December in YekaterinburgDec11223344556677889910101111121213131414151516161717181819192020212122222323242425252626272728282929303031310.0 kWh0.0 kWh0.2 kWh0.2 kWh0.4 kWh0.4 kWh0.6 kWh0.6 kWh0.8 kWh0.8 kWh1.0 kWh1.0 kWh1.2 kWh1.2 kWh1.4 kWh1.4 kWh1.6 kWh1.6 kWhNovJanDec 230.4 kWhDec 230.4 kWhDec 10.5 kWhDec 10.5 kWhDec 110.4 kWhDec 110.4 kWh\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Yekaterinburg are 56.852 deg latitude, 60.612 deg longitude, and 837 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Yekaterinburg contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 233 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 872 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (669 feet). Within 50 miles contains significant variations in elevation (2,507 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Yekaterinburg is covered by artificial surfaces (100%), within 10 miles by trees (57%) and artificial surfaces (14%), and within 50 miles by trees (81%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Yekaterinburg, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere is only a single weather station, Ekaterinburg Koltsovo Airport, in our network suitable to be used as a proxy for the historical temperature and dew point records of Yekaterinburg.\n\nAt a distance of 17 kilometers from Yekaterinburg, closer than our threshold of 150 kilometers, this station is deemed sufficiently nearby to be relied upon as our primary source for temperature and dew point records.\n\nThe station records are corrected for the elevation difference between the station and Yekaterinburg according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nPlease note that the station records themselves may additionally have been back-filled using other nearby stations or the MERRA-2 reanalysis.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
