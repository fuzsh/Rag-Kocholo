Lowe*, I. Jennings, S. Kitchen, D. Kitchen, L. Brown, S. Munroe-peart, T. Woods, I. Walker\n\nNEQAS, Sheffield, United Kingdom\n\nIntroduction:\n\nElocta® is an Fc Fusion Protein classified as an extended half-life (EHL) drug for the management of patients with Haemophilia A. Several different laboratory assay methods can be used to monitor Elocta in patient plasma samples.\n\nMethods:\n\nIn a supplementary UK NEQAS BC exercise 4 lyophilised samples containing Elocta were distributed to 81 participating centres. Sample S19:02 was from a patient with severe Haemophilia A treated with Elocta, but prior to sample collection was at a treatment trough level. S19:03 was from a patient with severe Haemophilia A patient, treated with 2000 iu/kg Elocta 15 minutes prior to sample collection. Samples S19:04 and S19.05 were constructed by ‘spiking’ FVIII deficient plasma, from a severe haemophilia A donor, with Elocta—Sample S19.04 at a level similar to a patient trough level and Sample S19:05 at a level similar to a patient post treatment level. Participants were invited to perform a FVIII assay on each of the four samples using testing methods in regular routine use in their laboratory.\n\nResults:\n\nResult data was collected from 78 centres for a FVIII assay on all samples, with 56 centres performing a 1-stage FVIII assay and 22 centres performing a Chromogenic FVIII assay. 9 participating centres performed both a 1-stage and a Chromogenic FVIII assay.\n\n1-stage FVIII\n\n•S19:02 Median results IU/dL = 2.4; Range = 0.82-5 IU/dL CV = 31.1%•S19:03 Median results IU/dL = 56.9; Range = 41.5-77 IU/dL, CV = 15%•S19:04 Median results IU/dL = 5.3; Range = 3.16-7 IU/dL, CV = 19.2%•S19:05 Median results IU/dL = 55.7; Range = 40.2-78 IU/dL, CV = 14.2%\n\nChromogenic FVIII results\n\n•S19:02 Median results IU/dL = 2.0; Range = 0.5-5 IU/dL;CV = 58.7%•S19:03 Median results IU/dL = 66.9; Range = 53-103 IU/dL; CV = 14.5%•S19:04 Median results IU/dL = 5.0; Range = 1-11 IU/dL; CV = 36%•S19:05 Median results IU/dL = 71.0; Range = 55-107 IU/dL; CV = 14.8%\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nCareful interpretation of patient results is required. Result levels of ≤11 IU/dL for 1-stage FVIII assays were at most ~15% higher compared to chromogenic assays. At higher levels of Elocta, 55-70 IU/dL, Chromogenic assays were at most 20% higher compared to 1-stage FVIII assay results. There were no found differences between in-vitro spiked samples and patient samples, indicating spiked samples to be commutable.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nNone declared.\n\nP002 | Human chromogenic FVIII assay results are dependent on sample dilution when emicizumab is present: Additional analysis from the first UK NEQAS BC FVIII inhibitor/emicizumab supplementary exercise\n\nA. Lowe*, I. Jennings, S. Kitchen, D. Kitchen, L. Brown, S. Munroe-peart, T. Woods, I. Walker\n\nNEQAS, Sheffield, United Kingdom\n\nIntroduction:\n\nUK NEQAS BC data from a supplementary survey identified an inter-laboratory variability of results reported using the Hyphen Biomed™ chromogenic FVIII kit when measuring patient samples containing emicizumab.\n\nMethods:\n\nIn this supplementary exercise 9 of 29 participating centres performed FVIII Hyphen Biomed™ chromogenic assays with results showing higher than expected CVs (CVs >38%).\n\nMethodology details were requested from these 9 participating laboratories including; how testing was performed, calibrant source, analyser platform and assay dilutions used.\n\nUK NEQAS BC investigations were performed with the Hyphen assay to assess the use of different test sample dilutions using 2 lyophilised samples containing emicizumab, (S18:23 and S18:24). Sample S18:23 was obtained from a patient with severe haemophilia A who had a FVIII inhibitor treated with emicizumab for 7 weeks at the time of sample donation. Sample S18:24 was constructed by in-vitro addition of emicizumab from a patient with severe haemophilia A without an inhibitor.\n\nResults:\n\nCentres using Siemens SHP calibrator material collectively gave a range of IU/dL surrogate FVIII activity results between 18.4-34.3 IU/dL for sample S18:23 and 19.1-37 IU/dL for S18:24. One centre used product specific calibrators from r2 diagnostics so that results were in μg/mL emicizumab not IU/dL surrogate FVIII activity. This centre used a 1 in 20 dilution on a Sysmex CS series analyser. Their results on S18:23 and S18:24 were 25.2 and 27.1 μg/mL.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nConsiderable variability throughout the combinations of calibrant and analyser used was noted with no clear trend identified. Internal UK NEQAS BC laboratory investigations of the data indicated that results were higher at higher test sample dilutions when using the same type of analyser and brand of calibrant. These results suggest that, to reduce variability and increase inter-laboratory standardisation of results, the use of available product specific calibrators should be implemented.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nNone declared.\n\nP003 | Laboratory measurement of emicizumab first “real-life” experience from karolinska university laboratory\n\nA. Sjöström1,2,*, S. Långström3, S. Ranta4, M. Magnusson2,5, N. Soutari1, J. Entrei1, P. Huttunen3, Å. Truedsson1, J. Antovic1,2\n\n1Coagulation & Clinical Chemistry, Karolinska University Laboratory, Karolinska University Hospital; 2Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, Stockholm, Sweden; 3Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology & Stem cell transplantation, New Children′s Hospital, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland; 4Pediatric Coagulation Unit, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden; 5Coagulation Unit, Department of Hematology, Stockholm, Sweden\n\nIntroduction:\n\nEmicizumab (Hemlibra®) is a bispecific monoclonal antibody that by binding FIXa and FX restore function of activated FVIII in patients with FVIII deficiency. It is an approved treatment of patients with hemophilia A with or without inhibitors. According to manufacturer recommendations routine laboratory monitoring of Emicizumab is not necessary. However, there are some clinical situations (e.g., surgery, critical bleeding) when monitoring is desirable. It has recently been shown that both one stage (OSA) and chromogenic assay (CSAh) with human reagents may be used for determination of Emicizumab in spiked samples, however, data based on patient samples are limited.\n\nMethods:\n\nTwenty plasma samples collected for clinical purposes at different time points in Emicizumab treated patients at Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden and Helsinki University Hospital, Finland were analysed using Biophen FVIIIchr:h calibrated against Emicizumab concentration or FVIII activity on BCS-XP coagulation analyzer. Additionally, ten of those samples were tested using modified OSA (1:8 additional dilution with Emicizumab calibration) based on PTT-A, Actin FS and Actin FSL APTT reagents.\n\nResults:\n\nCorrelation between Emicizumab concentration (in μg/mL) and FVIII activity (in kIE/L) is excellent (r2 = 0.98) measuring FVIII activity on BCS-XP coagulation analyser and using Biophen FVIIIchr:h calibrated against Emicizumab concentration.\n\nCorrelations between Emicizumab concentration measured by Biophen CSAh and OSA PTT-A, Actin FS and Actin FSL are also very strong (r2 = 0.90-0.94). Average bias is lower than 15% for any combination of the assays.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nDifferent OSA with pre-dilution of the samples and calibrated against concentration of Emicizumab as well as CSA with human reagents and same calibration may be used for determination of Emicizumab concentration in patient samples within range 0-70 μg/mL.\n\nThis study indicates that standardization is not an issue for laboratory measurement of Emicizumab and different OSA as well as CSAh may be safely used in the routine coagulation laboratory when determination of Emicizumab activity is needed.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nNone declared.\n\nP004 | Turoctocog alfa pegol, the only FVIII stable for up to 40 degrees celsius with extended half-life\n\nA. A. Olsen*, H. Grage, K. Kryger, C. Rix Melchiorsen\n\nBiopharm FP Manufacturing Development, Novo Nordisk A/S, Gentofte, Denmark\n\nIntroduction:\n\nTuroctocog alfa pegol is an extended half-life, glycoPEGylated recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) product developed to prevent and treat bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia A. To support worldwide use, stability studies have been performed covering requirements in climate zones I-IV. The current approved storage and shelf life is 30 months at 5°C, where the product may be kept at room temperature (≤30°C) for ≤12 months. To extend support for turoctocog alfa pegol in countries with a hot/humid climate, the effect of these storage conditions on the product stability was evaluated.\n\nMethods:\n\nBatches of turoctocog alfa pegol (500, 2000 and 3000 IU) were assessed for stability at 40°C ± 2°C/75% ± 5% relative humidity/darkness for either up to 6 months or for 3 months following storage for 27 months at 5°C ± 2°C/75% ± 5% relative humidity/darkness. In-use stability was assessed at 40°C and ambient humidity/darkness for up to 4 hours following reconstitution. Stability-indicating test parameters included high molecular weight protein, potency, purity, oxidised forms and protein content. Other standard parameters were also tested to confirm expected chemical properties and to verify safety/efficacy.\n\nResults:\n\nAll stability test results for all batches stored at 40°C and 75% RH for 6 and 3 months following 27 months storage at 5°C and 75% relative humidity were within acceptance criteria limits. No changes were observed in the appearance of powder, reconstitution time/solubility, appearance of solution, pH, particulate matter, sterility, bacterial endotoxins and antioxidants. Changes in test results for protein content, oxidised forms, purity and potency (that were observed when turoctocog alfa pegol was stored at 40°C for 3 months following storage for 27 months at 5°C) were lower than the observed test results when stored at 30°C for 12 months with previous storage at 5°C for 18 months. Samples reconstituted at 40°C after storage for 27 months at 5°C, followed by 3 months storage at 40°C demonstrated stability of all parameters to 4 hours, except for high molecular weight protein, which increased after reconstitution.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nThese study results support turoctocog alfa pegol shelf life where the product may be stored at or below 40°C for a single period up to 3 months following 27 months storage at 5°C.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nA.

Misgav1,2, G. Kenet1,2\n\n1Sackler School of Medicine Hematology Dept, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv; 2Thrombosis Unit, National Hemophilia Center, SHEBA MEDICAL CENTER, Ramat Gan, Israel; 3Pathophysiology, Sechenov First Moscow State Med Univ, Moscow, Russian Federation\n\nIntroduction:\n\nHemlibra is currently approved as prophylaxis for Hemophilia A (HA) patients with and without inhibitors. However, real world data regarding its laboratory monitoring are scarce. We aimed to evaluate laboratory monitoring and any clinical correlations to hemostasis in patients with HA who initiate prophylactic treatment with Hemlibra, per standard protocol. Any severe HA patient followed by our National Hemophilia Center was eligible for the study.\n\nMethods:\n\nThe patients were instructed to consult the center about any trauma, bleeding or other events. Platelet-poor plasma samples were obtained before initiation of therapy, at week 2, following the initiation of maintenance therapy (week 5) and every 3 months, aPTT, FVIII activity and inhibitor Bethesda assay were performed. Hemlibra levels and Thrombin generation (TG) parameters (peak height and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) were measured and calculated.\n\nResults:\n\n50 patients with HA, median age 11 years (1 month-76 years) including 31 children and 19 adults, of whom 22 patients had FVIII inhibitors (median: 14, range 1-900 BU) were enrolled. Patients were clinically followed for a median of 8 months (2-21 months). Hemarthroses (mainly target joints) occurred in 11 patients, mostly following trauma or extensive physical effort. Two elderly patients reported mucocutaneous bleeds, related to concomitant use of anti-platelet therapy. Seven minor surgeries were safely performed in six children, yet one circumcision of a 3-months-old baby was complicated by major bleeding. Laboratory analyses, presented as median (IQ range), disclosed statistically significant increase of Hemlibra plasma levels from 18 (15-22) μg/mL to 49 (23-67) μg/mL between week 2 and week 5, respectively. The extended aPTT values measured before treatment normalized at week 2 with additional significant shortening at week 5. Both ETP and peak height significantly increased from baseline 44 (0-374) nM×min and 13(6-24) nM to 700 (202-1045) nM×min and 48 (12-78) nM (week 2) and further to 984 (465-1398) nM×min and 72 (33-102) nM after 5 weeks; however, TG did not reach the levels observed in normal controls.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nNo differences were found between adults and children or between inhibitor and non- inhibitor patients after the loading period, aPTT, Hemlibra levels and TG parameters correlated positively. Lower TG was observed in very young infants, thus interpretation of laboratory results in this age required caution.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nA. Barg Consultant for: Roche, T.

Neill*, G. Benson\n\nHaemophilia Comprehensive Care Centre, Belfast City Hospital, Belfast, United Kingdom\n\nIntroduction:\n\nApproximately 1.4 million British people are at risk of stroke due to non-valvular atrial fibrillation necessitating long-term anticoagulation with warfarin, or Direct Oral Anticoagulants. These medications can inconsistently alter the INR and aPTT, and causing a delay in diagnosing Acquired Haemophilia.\n\nMethods:\n\nCase series of delayed diagnosis of acquired haemophilia in 3 patients due to concurrent anticoagulant use.\n\nResults:\n\nCase 1—An 82 year old man on warfarin, was referred to the Emergency department and was admitted with bruising to both arms as well as extensive right-sided bruising to his thigh, flank and back. Initial laboratory investigations revealed a low haemoglobin level of 72 g/L, a prolonged aPTT of 91 sec, a prothrombin time of 37.8 sec and his INR was 4.6. Two weeks later the diagnosis was confirmed with a high titre inhibitor of 368 BU/mL with 1% factor VIII. Two months after his first admission, the patient's Factor VIII activity had risen to 23%.\n\nCase 2—An 82 year old man taking apixaban, presented with soft tissue bruising into his right thigh, buttock and right gluteus medius. A coagulation screen recorded a prolonged aPTT of 147.5 sec, his haemoglobin had dropped to 76 g/L. Four weeks from initial presentation factor VIII was less than 1% with a high titre inhibitor (1673 BU/mL). The patient's inhibitor became unrecordable 2 months after his last admission and his factor VIII level was 32% (0.32 IU/mL). Ten months on from his initial presentation he is well and has a Factor VIII level of 250%.\n\nCase 3—An 86 year old man, taking edoxaban, was referred with bruising and haematuria. Five months from initial presentation additional coagulation tests showed a prolonged APTT of 57.3 sec and a Factor VIII level of 2% and an inhibitor (128 BU/mL). The patient's inhibitor level decreased with steroid treatment to 16.23 BU/mL, Factor VIII level was 8%, 0.08 IU/mL but sadly died due to complications of comorbid conditions.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nBleeding is a common side effect of anticoagulants. Abnormal clotting test results in conjunction with unusually severe bleeding into soft tissues should arouse clinical suspicion of an acquired coagulopathy and should not automatically be attributed to an anticoagulant.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nNone declared.\n\nP007 | Methodological validation of the measurement of ultra-low levels of factor VIII activity by chronometric aptt—based assay\n\nC. Wahl*, E. Boissier, N. Le Coq, C. Ternisien, N. Drillaud, M. Fouassier, M. Sigaud, M. Trossaert\n\nCHU Hotel Dieu Nantes, Nantes, France\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe nomenclature defines the severity of hemophilia A according to factor VIII coagulant activity (FVIII:C) level. For FVIII:C < 1 IU/dL, hemophilia is classified as severe and for values between 1 and 5 IU/dL, it is classified as moderate. In practice, it is often difficult to conclude for values close to 1 IU/dL. This is important because the prophylactic treatment may vary depending on the biological severity of hemophilia. The aim of this study is to validate FVIII:C method that would allow reliable results for ultra-low values.\n\nMethods:\n\nSpiked plasma was made using a calibrator (Siemens) diluted in a FVIII deficient plasma (Cryopep) to get FVIII:C between 0 and 3 IU/dL. The intra-laboratory reproducibility was evaluated by performing FVIII:C on coagulometer (ACL-TOP, Werfen) using a chronometric method (FVIII deficient plasma (Cryopep), APTT reagent (SynthASil, Werfen) and a unique calibration (Werfen) on 10 consecutive days. The bias was assessed by inter-laboratory comparison of FVIII:C results of 4 spiked plasmas (0.0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 IU/dL) performed in 8 French hemostasis laboratories, each of them using its own method.\n\nResults:\n\nConcerning the reproducibility, for spiked plasmas (0.0; 0.3; 0.7; 1.0; 1.5 and 3.0 IU/dL), the results (mean [range], coefficient of variation) were respectively: 0.00 IU/dL [0.00-0.00], incalculable; 0.18 IU/dL [0.10-0.30], 43.82%; 0.60 IU/dL [0.40-0.80], 19.25%; 0.95 IU/dL [0.80-1.10], 10.23%, 1.33 IU/dL [1.10-1.70], 16.64%, 2.64 [2.00-3.70], 17.69%. Concerning bias determination (inter-laboratory comparison), the results (mean, bias) for each spiked plasma (0.0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 IU/dL) were respectively: 0.19 IU/dL, 5.3%; 1.01 IU/dL, 5.9%; 1.90 IU/dL, 8.9%; 2.60 IU/dL, 6.5%. According to FVIII:C level, the measurement uncertainty was: 0.6 ± 0.25 UI/dL; 1.33 ± 0.48 UI/dL; 2.64 ± 0.94 UI/dL.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nFor FVIII:C assay, the French guidelines recommend a CV < 9.5% and a bias <18.8%. In addition, for Westgard QC, the acceptable measurement uncertainty limit is 10.5%. Unfortunately, these recommendations only concern FVIII:C values within 35.0 and 99.0 IU/dL and cannot obviously be implemented to very low FVIII:C values. In this study, the very small overlap between values allowed us to specifically measure FVIII:C < 1 IU/dL and distinguish “extremely” or “modestly” severe hemophilia A.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nNone declared.\n\nP008 | Challenges in treatment monitoring of severe haemophilia patients with high titer inhibitors\n\nC.

Unfortunately, it is facing uncertainties and limits to overcome for the security of these persons with a high pathologic burden.\n\nMethods:\n\nThe aim of our study was to analyse in real life practice the informative value of some coagulometric, thromboelastographic (TEG) and thrombin generation assay (TGA) parameters investigated for tailoring therapy with bypassing agents (BPAs). We evaluated 7 patients, aged between 7-48 years, with severe haemophilia A and high titer inhibitors, 5 of them with major/intermediate surgical interventions. The following parameters were assessed: coagulometry-Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT), Prothrombin Time (PT) and Prothrombin Index (PI); thromboelastography (TEG)-reaction time (r), kinetics (k) and maximum amplitude (MA); thrombin generation assay (TGA)-lag time, endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), peak height, time to peak (ttpeak), start tail, and velocity index. All were evaluated pre, −1 hour and −4 hours post-administration of specific therapy.\n\nResults:\n\nBefore the initiation of BPAs treatment there was a significant prolongation of APTT, r, k, ttpeak and start tail. rFVII after 1- hour and 4—hours administration significantly (P ≤ 0.01) shortened PT, increased PI and improved r, k, MA, lag time, peak, ttpeak, start tail and velocity index. The APTT and ETP were not significantly changed. In APCC treatment, during the 1 and 4 hours monitoring, we observed the maintenance of corrected parameters ETP, peak, and ttpeak (P < 0.05), with no influence on routine coagulation tests. Unfortunately, in major orthopedic surgery it is well known the risk of severe bleeding, even in patients with normal hemostasis; in our two patients, despite improved TEG and relatively normalized TGA parameters, they continued to bleed, justifying the addition of a second alternative BPA.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nIn patients with inhibitors, especially in those undergoing surgery, it is indispensable to monitor the evolution by daily hemostatic investigations and rigorous clinical follow-up in order to choose the best therapeutic regimen. Coagulometric assays are unreliable recommending TEG and TGA explorations.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nNone declared.\n\nP010 | Acquired hemophilia and laboratory diagnostic issues: A case-report\n\nD. C. Gonçalves*, B. L. Pinto, C. Monteiro, L. R. Gonçalves, M. Carvalho, C. Koch\n\nCenter of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Reference Center of Congenital Coagulopathies, Centro Hospitalar Universitário São João, Porto, Portugal\n\nIntroduction:\n\nAcquired hemophilia (AH) is a rare bleeding condition, caused by autoantibodies against coagulation factors, most commonly factor (F) VIII. Its usual manifestation is muscle, subcutaneous or mucosal hemorrhage, with an isolated prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), in a patient with no personal or family history of coagulopathy. Up to 50% of AH cases are idiopathic, but it is also associated with other conditions, namely hematological malignancies.\n\nMethods:\n\nWe describe a report of an 89-year-old man with a high-intermediate risk IgG monoclonal gammopathy diagnosed in 2016, who came to the urgency department with a 3-day history of macroscopic hematuria. After admission in the urology department, hematuria persisted and severe anemia developed, needing 4 packed red blood cell transfusion. No clear urologic cause was identified, besides bladder thickening, and surgery was scheduled for investigation. Screening coagulation tests showed a prolonged aPTT—56.1″ (N 24.2-36.4), and a normal prothrombin time. Mixture test had a low Rosner index value (9%) and F levels were: FVIII 14%, FIX 95%, FXI 78%, even with plasma dilution, as paraprotein can act as a non-specific inhibitor of coagulation F activity, leading to prolonged aPTT. AH was suspected despite level of FVIII: FVIII inhibitor with 8BU confirmed diagnosis and surgery was cancelled.\n\nResults:\n\nA prolonged aPTT and <12% Rosner index pointed us to a F deficiency and FVIII level could have led us to a diagnosis of a mild hemophilia A which, in this context, was excluded by inhibitor titulation. To control bleeding, patient initiated activated prothrombin complex concentrate (FEIBA, 50 U/kg bid), and to eradicate inhibitor, prednisone (1 mg/kg od). Hematuria was controlled, without further transfusion support, and FEIBA was reduced to 50 U/Kg od. There was no progression of gammopathy and AH etiological investigation started.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nWe point out the relevance of a thorough approach to a prolonged aPTT, as this case combined a low level of FVIII with a high titer FVIII inhibitor, despite a low Rosner index. If AH had not been diagnosed, surgery could trigger life-threatening bleeding and misguided therapeutic strategies. Identifying the etiology of AH and treating underlying co-morbidities, as well as controlling bleeding and infections associated to immunosuppression, are the key to reduce morbidity and mortality in AH.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nNone declared.\n\nP011 | Development of a high-throughput transduction inhibition assay (TIA) to address the inherent discordance of seroprevalence between AAVS3 ELISA and TIA in patients with haemophilia B\n\nE. Shehu*, R. Alade, H. Ollerton, S. Kameshraj, J. Pandya, J. Foley, A. Dane, R. Corbau, A. Nathwani\n\nResearch and Development, Freeline Therapeutics, Stevenage, United Kingdom\n\nIntroduction:\n\nOwing to their non-pathogenic nature and outstanding safety record, adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have become the gene therapy vector of choice. However, up to 70% of people will be exposed to at least one strain of AAV during their lives and their anti-AAV antibodies can inhibit effective transduction. A suitable method of transduction inhibition analysis is paramount to ensure safe and beneficial inclusion of patients for gene therapy treatment.\n\nMethods:\n\nWe pre-screened patients using an ELISA specific for our proprietary capsid, AAVS3, and then used a FACS-based TIA to confirm clinical trial eligibility. When ELISA and FACS-TIA data were compared retrospectively, we found enough disagreement between the two methods to warrant the continued use of the TIA. However, its accuracy comes at the expense of drastically reduced throughput when compared to an ELISA format. We therefore developed a sensitive and robust TIA method which we then used to screen plasma from healthy donors as well as haemophilia B patients.\n\nResults:\n\nWe tested several AAVS3 reporter vectors before optimizing for cell number, multiplicity of infection (MOI) and sample dilution. Using AAVS3-bright luciferase (BL) in a 96-well format, a robust signal was obtained after 6 hours of transduction of 1.5 × 105 HEK293T cells using an MOI of 0.83. To improve the versatility of the assay, we also developed a protocol that could be run overnight. Both 6-hour and overnight AAVS3-BL TIA protocols have excellent signal-to-noise (Z’ > 0.7) and were sensitive to Nabs titre down to 5 μg/mL as measured by ELISA. The Nab titre of 35 healthy donor plasma samples showed an excellent correlation between our validated FACS-based TIA and the AAVS3-BL assay. To demonstrate the utility of the AAVS3-BL assay in a disease-relevant population, we measured the neutralising titre in 62 haemophilia B patient samples and found that an ELISA cut-off of 10 μg/mL produces false-negative and false-positive rates of 12 and 8% respectively.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nThe 6-hour protocol of the AAVS3-BL assay represents the shortest functional TIA described to date and enables the rapid and flexible screening of patients in AAV-based gene therapy clinical trials. This approach will solve the issue of discrepant ELISA and TIA seroprevalence results by making ELISA-based patient screening obsolete.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nE.

Coppola1, G. Quintavalle1,*, G. F. Rivolta1, F. Riccardi1, A. Matichecchia1, A. Benegiamo2, R. D. Ruenes2, R. Rossi2, A. Tagliaferri1\n\n1Regional Reference Centre for Inherited Bleeding Disorders—University Hospital of Parma; 2Laboratory of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology—University Hospital of Parma, Parma, Italy\n\nIntroduction:\n\nAddressing variability of individual pharmacokinetic (PK) responses to Factor VIII (FVIII) products is crucial to personalise prophylaxis in haemophilia A patients to improve outcomes and reduce the burden of i.v. injections. By using lower number of FVIII measurements, population PK may simplify performing individual PK assessments.\n\nMethods:\n\nIn 14 candidates to switch to efmoroctocog alfa (rFVIII-Fc) individual PK was studied injecting ~50 IU/Kg rFVIII-Fc and measuring FVIII activity (one-stage assay) before and 0.25, 1, 3, 6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hrs after infusion. At baseline Willebrand Factor Antigen (VWF:Ag) was measured. PK parameters, including terminal half-life (HL), area under the curve (AUC) and clearance (Cl), calculated through non-compartmental analysis by the Phoenix WinNonlin (WN) software package and the population-PK tool Web-Accessible Population Pharmacokinetic Service-Hemophilia (WAPPS), were compared and correlations with rFVIII-Fc dose regimens were evaluated. Means ± 1 standard deviation are reported.\n\nResults:\n\nCompared to WN, WAPPS provided different HL (20.5 ± 6.4 vs 17.5 ± 5.9 hrs, balanced estimate; P = 0.012) and Cl (2.17 vs 2.39 mL/h/Kg; P = 0.001) and comparable AUC (2343 ± 865 vs 2288 ± 941 U*h/dL). Significant correlations were found between all WN- and WAPPS-derived variables (≥0.79, Pearson; P ≤ 0.01). Both assessments of AUC (≥0.87, P ≤ 0.001) and Cl (≥−0.72, P ≤ 0.006) were significantly correlated with VWF:Ag, as well WAPPS-derived HL (0.83, P < 0.001), WN-calculated HL not reaching statistical significance (0.49, P = 0.09). Prolonging infusion intervals in 10/13 patients (no bleeding and FVIII trough ≥2%) over mean 18 ± 6 mo. prophylaxis with rFVIII-Fc, [AI1] led to significant reduction of weekly dose (96 ± 13 vs. 85 ± 19 IU/Kg, first vs. last prescribed). Inverse correlations of last weekly dose with VWF:Ag (−0.80, P = 0.001) and both AUC (≥−0.87, P ≤ 0.001) and HL (≥−0.85, P ≤ 0.001) assessments were found, coefficients being higher for WAPPS and increasing when compared to first prescribed dose, in all estimate pairs except WN-calculated HL\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nIndividual and WAPPS assessments provided different but correlated rFVIII-Fc PK profiles, both showing relevant relationships with prophylaxis weekly dose. WAPPS-derived variables are likely to better correlate with dose reduction over treatment.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nA.

Arslan, F. Şahin\n\nDepartment of Hematology, Ege University Faculty of Medicine, İZMİR, Turkey\n\nIntroduction:\n\nHaemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder; approximately half of male offspring of carrier females are expected to inherit the haemophilic defect. Haemostatic changes during pregnancy lead to a normalization of factor VIII (FVIII) in most carriers of haemophilia A. Factor VIII levels usually increase during pregnancy but the factor level should be assessed during pregnancy.\n\nMethods:\n\nWe aim to describe a patient with haemophilia A carrier whom had pregnant with a boy.\n\nResults:\n\nA 30-year-old woman whom had a pregnancy at 39 weeks of gestation with boy was referred to our haematology clinic. She was carrier of haemophilia A and was known to have a low baseline factor VIII activity level between 10 percent and 20 percent with prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). The patient had no history of surgery, bleeding and factor replacement therapy. In laboratory tests complete blood count and biochemical tests were normal. Coagulation test revealed that aPTT was in normal range (26.8 seconds). There was no laboratory data that shows the FVIII level during her pregnancy. FVIII level could not be assessed due to very little time to delivery, so the patient was planned to undergo cesarean delivery. However, factor concentrates were available if needed for managing both of mother and a potentially affected male child, preoperative prophylactic factor replacement therapy was not administered to mother. Healthy male child was born. At birth, cord blood was tested for FVIII activity level. Prophylactic factor replacement therapy was not administered to newborn. FVIII activity level was found as 80 percent and 116 percent in mother and newborn, respectively. After two weeks from delivery maternal FVIII activity level was retested and found as 20 percent. Prolonged bleeding during or after delivery was not observed in mother and newborn.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nFor a female haemophilia A carrier delivering a male child, the option of a planned cesarean delivery should always be kept in mind. In haemophilia A, the mother's factor VIII level generally decreases after delivery; the risk of postpartum bleeding is more of a concern for a carrier with a low baseline factor VIII level. Thus, maternal factor levels should be monitored postpartum. Also it is prudent in later infancy to retest those who appear to be unaffected when tested as a newborn. In conclusion, management of pregnancy in carrier of haemophilia A should involve multidisciplinary planning.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nNone declared.\n\nP014 | The influence of subchondral bone cysts on tissue pressures in the tibiotalar joint\n\nH. Talbott1,*, R. Wilkins2, A. Redmond2, C. Brockett1,2, M. Mengoni1\n\n1Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering, School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Leeds; 2Leeds Institute of Rheumatic & Musculoskeletal Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom\n\nIntroduction:\n\nSubchondral bone cysts are an indicator of late stage haemophilic joint disease (HJD); however, the implication of these cysts on joint health is little understood. The aim of this study was to assess, computationally, the influence of subchondral bone cysts on tissue pressures through their inclusion in patient-specific finite element (FE) models.\n\nMethods:\n\nChronologically sequential (minimum of 3 sequences over 2 years), non-weightbearing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences were acquired for three people with severe Haemophilia A. The main inclusion criteria for the study was the imaging presence of subchondral bone cysts (n = 15). Segmentations of subchondral bone cysts, bones, and cartilage were generated, and segmentation-specific FE meshes were created using Simpleware-ScanIP 2017.6 (Synopsis). FE models were developed to simulate the forces associated with neutral still standing—keeping the bone positions of the MR images—for each patient under two cyst conditions: with the cyst defined as intact bone, and as de-facto cystic tissue (Abaqus 2017, Dassault Systèmes). The tissue pressures were extracted from both the cartilage and bones, to investigate the influence of the cyst presence throughout the ankle.\n\nResults:\n\nFor each patient, the volume and location of the subchondral bone cysts varied over time, and the maximum pressures in the contact areas reflected this. 7 cases had cysts located in the tibia alone, in these the maximum pressure increased on average by 77% (st. dev. 48%) in the tibia, 16% (31%) in the talus, and 32% (35%) in the cartilage contact area upon the addition of cysts. 4 cases had cysts in the talus alone—the pressure increased on average by 3% (26%) in the tibia, 66% (107%) in the talus, and 14% (24%) in the cartilage. The greatest variations were seen in the 4 cases where cysts were present in both bones, with an average increase of 137% (37%) in the tibia, 97% (51%) in the talus, and 120% (145%) in the cartilage.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nThis computational work showed that cysts of all sizes appear to increase the pressures across all components of the joint, although there is no clear correlation between the volume of subchondral bone cysts and the change in maximum pressure value. The presence of any cystic tissue within the joint is therefore likely detrimental to joint health, as larger tissue pressures may be linked to an increased rate of HJD progression.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nH.

Pergantou1,*, Z. Kapsimali1, K. Spanou2, I. Varela2, A. Michalopoulou1, A. Dettoraki1, M. Economou3, N. Constantinidou2, M. Kanariou2, H. Platokouki1\n\n1Haemophilia Centre/Haemostasis and Thrombosis Unit; 2Department of Immunology-Histocompatibility, “Aghia Sophia” Children's Hospital, Athens; 31st Paediatric Department of Aristotle University, Ippokration Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece\n\nIntroduction:\n\nTo investigate the impact of FVIII gene mutations, HLA alleles and certain cytokine polymorphisms, on the risk for FVIII Inhibitor (FVIII Inh) development in a group of Greek children with severe Haemophilia A (HaemA).\n\nMethods:\n\nRetrospective study of clinical and laboratory data of children with severe HaemA, Greek origin, born from 1997 to 2017, treated exclusively with recombinant FVIII concentrates. The cut-off value of FVIII inh positivity was set at ≥0.6 BU. Intron-22 inversion (INV-22) was detected by LD-PCR. Sequencing of the coding region of the FVIII gene was performed. HLA alleles, DRB1, DQB1 and cytokine polymorphic variants (TNF-a, TGF-b1, IL-10 and IFN-gamma) were genotyped by PCR-SSOP/SSP. The data were analyzed by x2 and Fischer's exact test.\n\nResults:\n\nOf 88 patients, forty had developed FVIII inh (Group I), while 48 had not (Group II). INV-22 was more frequently detected in Group I in comparison to Group II (63.2% vs 33.3%, respectively, P = 0.028, OR = 3.4, 95% CI 1.2-9.2). On the contrary, the percentage of point mutations (PM) was significantly higher in Group II (33.3% vs 9.7%, P = 0.011, OR = 0.22, 95% CI 0.07-0.73). Large deletions (LG) were detected in 6.5% in Group I vs 3.3% in Group II, while small deletions (SD) and intron-1 inversion (INV-1) were detected in 13.3% and 6.5%, in Group II, respectively, in comparison to 6.5% and 0% in Group I, respectively. Compared to Group II, in Croup I increased frequencies of DRB1*01:01 (P = 0.073, OR = 4.9), and DQB1*05:01 (P = 0.009, OR = 5.7) were estimated, whereas HLA-DRB1*11:04 were estimated in lower frequency (P = 0.03, OR = 0.3). After further analysis, it was found that children with INV-22 or LD and at least one of HLA alleles DRB1*01:01 and DQB1*05:01 had all (100%) developed FVIII Inh. On the contrary, of children with other than INV-22 or LD mutations who had the HLA allele DRB1*11:04, 14.3% developed FVIII Inh. Cytokine genotyping did not confirm our previously shown predominance of FVIII inh development in homozygotes for the haplotypes ACC and ATA of IL-10 polymorphisms.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nKnowledge of the mutations responsible for Haem A and of the presence or absence of three HLA alleles (DRB1*01:01, DQB1*05:01, DRB1*11:04) in children with Haem A would provide prediction for FVIII Inh development in the future and contribute to therapeutic decisions.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nNone declared.\n\nP016 | Ultrasonography can accomplish a critical role, because it detects small amounts of blood, and early articular alterations, which allows for the follow up of musculoskeletal pathology in patients with haemophilia\n\nM.

Fernandez; 3fundacion de la hemofilia, Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\nIntroduction:\n\nRepetitive bleeding into the joint leads to synovial hyperplasia, neo angiogenesis and degeneration of articular cartilage. The aim of this work is to propose a mechanism of synovitis development than can be blocked by platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and prevent joint damage.\n\nMethods:\n\nThe hemosiderin into the synoviocyte, leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin IL-1b, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), as well as tissue destructive enzymes and an over expression of c-myc and mdm2 .\n\nNeo angiogenesis is produced by pro-angiogenic mediators vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), stromal cell—derived factor-1 (SDF-1), and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9). Cartilage apoptosis is mediated by IL-1b that stimulates hydrogen peroxide production by chondrocytes. IL-1b inhibition, stops apoptosis and together to TNFa, decrease proteoglycan turnover.\n\nResults:\n\nPRP inhibits inflammation by the effect on anti-inflammatory cytokines, and inhibits angiogenesis by the effect on VEGF, SDF-1, and MMP-9 and regulates the expression of c-myc and mdm2 genes. The inhibition of IL-1b and the turnover avoid cartilage apoptosis.\n\nThe main growth factor is TGF-ß which is secreted in two latent forms ways: in small complexes of immediate action, that promote the attraction of immune cells and that are degraded by enzymes furin-like released by platelets; large complexes of late release, degraded primarily by plasmin at the time of fibrinolysis and triggers the regenerative response. Alpha 2 antiplasmin may also have an inhibited effect of fibrinolysis.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nThese are the possible mechanisms of PRP inhibition for mediators of synovial hyperplasia, neo angiogenesis and cartilage degeneration.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nNone declared.\n\nP017 | Fix concentrates might increase procoagulant effect of emicizumab\n\nI.

Jiménez-Yuste\n\nThrombosis and Haemostasis, La Paz University Hospital-IdiPaz, Madrid, Spain\n\nIntroduction:\n\nMild-moderate bleeding phenotypes are seen in patients on prophylaxis with emicizumab thus treatment with factor concentrates will be required to control breakthrough/perioperative bleeds. Procoagulant activity of emicizumab might be increased by rising levels of factor (F) IX. Administration of FIX concentrates in patients with inhibitors may be better controlled than bypassing agents by conventional measurement of FIX levels. Therefore, we aimed to assess the procoagulant effect of increasing levels of FIX in patients with inhibitors on prophylaxis with emicizumab.\n\nMethods:\n\nFive patients with inhibitors on prophylaxis with emicizumab and 20 healthy controls consented to participate in the study. A modified Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) with low concentration of tissue factor, Total Thrombus-formation Analysis System (T-TAS®) (AR-chip shear rate 110 s−1) and thrombin generation test (Calibrated Automated Thrombogram; CAT) performed with platelet poor plasma and PPP-Reagent LOW (Stago, Spain) were assessed in samples drawn in CTI tubes (corn trypsin inhibitor, CellSystems, Germany). Therapeutic doses of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa, Novoseven®, Novo Nordisk) and activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCC, Feiba®, Takeda) were tested. Benefix® (Pfizer) was used as FIX source.\n\nResults:\n\nIncrements of 10 IU/dL of FIX normalized ROTEM® in all patients. Further increment up to 25 IU/dL FIX had a procoagulant effect similar to that would be obtained after one dose of 90 mcg/kg rFVIIa. Regarding aPCC in ROTEM, increments of FIX levels up to 200 IU/dL was necessary to achieve a procoagulant effect similar to that would be obtained with a dose of 2.5 IU/kg of aPCC. Thrombin generation was normalized in all patients with increments of 25 IU/dL of FIX. T-TAS® data supported the ROTEM® and CAT results indicating important increments of the procoagulant effect of emicizumab in response to low increments of FIX concentrations.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nThree global haemostasis assays indicate that low increments of FIX plasma activity produce an enhanced procoagulant effect of emicizumab in patients with inhibitors opening the idea of the use of FIX concentrates as an alternative treatment of bleedings in this type of patients. However, preclinical studies are necessary to test the in vivo clinical efficacy and thrombotic risk of the concomitant use of FIX and emicizumab.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nNone declared.\n\nP018 | Genetic diagnosis and molecular epidemiology description of a cohort of 109 hemophilic cubans\n\nN. Borras Agusti1,*, D. Castillo González2, N. Comes Fernández1, L. Martin-Fenandez1, C. Macías Abraham2, R. A. Rivero Jimémez2, A. Chang Monteagudo2, V. Ruiz Moleón; 2, H. Garrote Santana2, F. Vidal Perez1\n\n1Blood and Tissue Bank, Barcelona, Spain; 2Instituto de Hematología e Inmunología, La Habana, Cuba\n\nIntroduction:\n\nIn several countries, molecular diagnosis of Hemophilia A (HA) and Hemophilia B (HB) is hampered by the difficulties to have the resources and technology to analyze the DNA. This situation is being overcome thanks to the advent of NGS which allows to analyze genes at a reasonable cost. This study aimed to identify mutations in Cuban patients clinically diagnosed with HA or HB and investigate thoroughly the molecular epidemiology of this cohort.\n\nMethods:\n\nA total of 109 patients (98 families), clinically diagnosed with HA (96 patients) or HB (13 patients) at the Instituto de Hematología e Inmunología were enrolled. The molecular analysis was performed in Banc de Sang i Teixits. Inversions in F8 were assessed by well-established PCR procedures. Gene sequencing was performed by a NGS gene panel approach that includes 30 genes involved in inherited bleeding disorders and sequenced in a MiSeq system. Mutations were identified by DNA Amplicon software and VariantStudio and further validated by Sanger sequencing. Large deletions or duplications were detected by MLPA.\n\nResults:\n\nAt least one mutation was identified in 104 out of 109 patients (96.4%). Among them, 86 patients were clinically diagnosed with severe or moderate HA, of which 35 carried the intron 22 inversion (40%). Of note, in 6 patients (6.8%) was detected intron 1 inversion, indicating that the frequency of this rearrangement in Cuba is slightly higher than previously published for other populations (1-5% cases of severe HA), and 5 patient had large deletions or duplications in F8. In mild HA (10) and HB (13) patients, the most common variants were missense mutations. Moreover, in 12 patients, mutations in VWF were also identified. In total, 122 mutations (68 different), including both recurrent inversions, were identified in the Cuban cohort. Specifically, 91 mutations were scattered along F8, 16 were located in F9 and 15 in VWF. The 40.9% (34/83) of the identified mutations had not been previously recorded in databases.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nThe designed NGS gene panel is robust and cost-effective and allows to establish the molecular diagnosis of several pathologies using a single protocol. The genetic study will improve the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and therapeutic orientation. The mutations identified in index cases will facilitate the implementation of familial studies and prenatal diagnosis in Cuba using traditional sequencing.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nNone declared.\n\nP019 | Factor VIII levels in blood group o and non-o in non-severe haemophilia A\n\nJ.

Individuals with BG O have lower VWF and FVIII levels. We aimed to explore the influence of ABO BG on VWF and FVIII levels in non-severe haemophilia A (HA).\n\nMethods:\n\nWe recruited adults (age ≥18 years) with FVIII levels of 1-40%, platelet count > 105/μl, without FVIII inhibitors, impaired renal and hepatic function, active cancer, surgery in the last 6 weeks, overt infection in the last 2 weeks. Haemophilia was confirmed with FVIII gene analysis for all patients. All patients signed informed consent. We used the lowest FVIII level ever measured for assessment of severity. Healthy males with median age (48 years, IQR: 32-56) comparable to the patient group (51 years, IQR: 37-61) served as healthy controls (HC).\n\nWe determined following parameters: ABO BG, FVIII by one-stage assay (native FVIII-deficient plasma—Technoclone and Actin FS activator—Siemens), VWF activity (VWF:Act, BC von Willebrand Reagent or Innovance VWF Ac—Siemens), VWF antigen (VWF:Ag, STA LIATEST VWF, Diagnostica Stago).\n\nResults:\n\nIn all 89 persons with HA (47 with BG O, 41 with BG non-O), and 82 HCs (32 with BG O, 50 with BG non-O) were included.\n\nVWF levels were higher both in patients (P = 0.002 for both VWF:Ag and VWF:Act) and HCs (P < 0.001 for both VWF:Ag and VWF:Act) with BG non-O compared to individuals with BG O. FVIII levels were not different between BG non-O and O in HA patients (15% vs. 14.1%, P = 0.716) but higher in HCs with BG non-O versus O (150.0% vs. 109.5%, P < 0.001). Comparison of distributions was performed by Mann-Whitney-U test.\n\nIn HA there was no correlation between FVIII and VWF:Act (P = 0.095) or VWF:Ag (P = 0.795) by Spearman's correlation. In univariable linear regression there was no association between FVIII and vWF:Act (P = 0.789) or vWF:Ag (P = 0.588) in HA.\n\nIn HCs, there was a strong positive correlation between FVIII and VWF:Act (rho = 0.751, P < 0.001) or VWF:Ag (rho = 0.790, P < 0.001) by Spearman's correlation. In HCs 1% elevation in the VWF:Ag was associated with 0.73% elevation in the FVIII:Act (P < 0.001).\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nBG and VWF had no influence on FVIII levels in non-severe HA. We conclude that the impact of the genetic mutation of the FVIII gene by far outweighs the influence of VWF levels and BG. For the diagnosis of HA and determination of severity the BG does not need to be considered.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nNone declared.\n\nP020 | Assessment of platelet and fibrinogen function in severe haemophilia patients\n\nP.

Jiménez-Yuste\n\nThrombosis and Haemostasis, University Hospital La Paz-IdiPaz, Madrid, Spain\n\nIntroduction:\n\nPlatelet and fibrinogen are key players in haemostasis. Their function is not well characterized in patients with severe haemophilia (SH). We aimed to study platelet and fibrinogen function in a group of SH patients by evaluating both platelet fibrinogen receptor activation and platelet degranulation after stimulation as well as fibrinogen-dependent clot formation.\n\nMethods:\n\nPlatelet function was analyzed by flow cytometry (FC) and T-TAS® (PL chip with high and low shear rate). Platelet rich plasma (PRP) was incubated with either buffer or 100 μM TRAP or 20 μM ADP. Next, PAC1 (monoclonal antibody [mAb] that only recognizes activated conformation of fibrinogen receptor) or anti-P-selectin mAb were added. Surface expression of fibrinogen receptor was determined with anti-aIIb and anti-β3, and von Willebrand factor receptor with anti-CD42a and anti-CD42b mAbs. Finally, samples were analysed by FC. ROTEM® was performed on whole blood with exTEM and fibTEM tests. ROTEM® evaluated clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), maximum velocity of clot formation (MAXV), maximum clot firmness (MCF) and lysis at 60 minutes.\n\nResults:\n\nTwenty four patients with SH [21 SHA (3 with inhibitors); 3 SHB (1 with inhibitors)], mean age 37.9 ± 14.9 years old, and 38 healthy controls (44.5 ± 12.2 years old) were included. FC analysis indicated a high variability in the platelet function between patients. Platelets from 16.7% of the patients were activated under basal conditions considering PAC-1 binding and P-selectin exposure. Platelet from 4% and 25% of the patients had a very low binding to PAC-1 after stimulation with TRAP and ADP respectively. Exposure of P-selectin after stimulus with both TRAP and ADP was affected in 25% of the patients. Regarding strength and velocity of clot formation, ROTEM® exTEM showed a normal profile in all patients. However, 4% of the patients had a MCF of fibTEM test (normal range: 9-25 mm) lower than 9 mm while 12.5% of them had a MCF = 9 mm. No differences were found in T-TAS® parameters between patients and controls.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nPlatelet function in most of SH patients varied within normal range but in some patients, basal platelet activation and low response to stimulus were detected. The impaired fibrinogen function measured by ROTEM® might influence the strength and stability of the clot. Clinical importance of these findings should be analyzed in future studies.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nNone declared.\n\nP021 | Characterization of a new chromogenic factor VIII assay containing human fixa and bovine FX\n\nP. Rosén, P. Bryngelhed*\n\nROSSIX AB, Molndal, Sweden\n\nIntroduction:\n\nA new chromogenic substrate (CS) FVIII method (Rox Factor VIII), containing human FIXa and bovine FX, has been evaluated with respect to FX activation kinetics, accuracy and reagent stability as well as on its insensitivity towards a bispecific monoclonal antibody mimicking FVIII (Emicizumab).\n\nMethods:\n\nFXa generation was determined after repeated subsampling during 10 min. Accuracy was determined through investigation of dilutional linearity of a plasma sample after stepwise dilution in FVIII deficient plasma to obtain FVIII activities in the range 0.005-1.5 IU/mL and with value assignment vs a plasma calibrator diluted in kit buffer. Reagent stability was assessed from storage of reconstituted reagents at 2-8°C up to 72 hours and on-board ACL TOP 500 for 8 hours. Sensitivity to Emicizumab was investigated on analysis of plasma samples with 25, 50 and 100 mg/mL Emicizumab using four species combinations of FIXa and FX: Human FIXa and bovine FX (Rox Factor VIII), bovine FIXa and human FX, both human species and both bovine species.\n\nResults:\n\nApproximately 50% of maximal FXa generation was reached after 3 min activation, which corresponds to the selected activation time for the CS method. The dilutional linearity study resulted in mean recoveries of 92-106% for samples in the range 0.005-1.5 IU/mL. Control recovery vs baseline was within 90-110% for reconstituted reagents stored at 2-8°C for 72 hours or on-board ACL TOP 500 for 8 hours.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nThe Rox Factor VIII method provides a high accuracy as shown by dilutional linearity in the whole measuring range 0.005-1.5 IU/mL on analysis of plasma. The method uses an activation time of 3 min at which time about 50% of maximal FXa generation is reached and is thus in accordance with Ph Eur requirements. Reconstituted reagents are stable for 72 hours at 2-8°C and 8 hours on-board ACL TOP 500. The use of human FIXa and bovine FX offers reliable determination of inherent FVIII activity in patient plasma with Emicizumab at clinically relevant levels. Altogether, a robust performance was shown, making this new CS FVIII method suitable for determination of FVIII activity in plasma and for potency assessment of FVIII concentrates.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nP.

Kavakli3\n\n1Pediatric Genetics2Pediatrics; 3Pediatric Hematology, EGE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, Izmir, Turkey\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe development of neutralizing antibodies, which is called inhibitor, against factor VIII (FVIII) is a serious complication of the early stages of replacement therapy in hemophilia A (HA). Risk factors for inhibitor development that allow risk stratification are classified simply into two groups: modifiable and unmodifiable. The position and type of substitution of missense mutations may influence the risk of inhibitor development. In this study, we investigated the inhibitor risk of missense mutations and affecting factors including changing in the type of amino acid group.\n\nMethods:\n\nWe evaluated the F8 gene variant database (http://www.facto​rviiidb. org/) by EAHAD to collect mutation data and clinical findings including the severity of HA and inhibitor development in the patient. The data in the cases with missense mutations recorded in the database were then selected. Twenty amino acids are known to be classified according to their side chains into 2 major groups: nonpolar hydrophobic and polar. Otherwise, the polar group may subclassify into 3 subgroups: basic, acidic and polar uncharged (Table). Each mutation data were noted to be changed or unchanged according to whether substitution caused changes in the amino acid class using these two classifications.\n\nResults:\n\nAmong all data in the F8 gene variation database (http://www.facto​rviii​db.org/), 3248 different case data with 954 different missense mutations were excluded. The data with both clinical phenotype and inhibitor information were in 2207 cases. Of these 2207 cases, 153 (%6.9) had been reported to be positive. Evaluation according to whether substitution caused changes in the amino acid class or not using 4 groups classification showed that unchanged variants are more associated with inhibitor development in overall (P = 0.012). This result was more significant when the cases differed between clinical severity. While 9.8% of cases with unchanged variants (n = 44/451) have been reported to have inhibitor of FVIII, this value was 4.8% (n = 34/709) in the cases with changed variants in mild HA patients (P = 0.001).\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nIn mild HA cases with a missense mutation, amino acid substitution type (unchanged) might be a novel indicator for inhibitor development in hemophilia A.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nNone declared.\n\nP023 | Design of a proactive program for the rational use of plastic from clinical trials in La Paz University Hospital\n\nT. Cebanu1,*, S. García-Barcenilla1, E. Monzón-Manzano1, I. Fernández-Bello1, M. T. Alvarez-Román1, M. Martín-Salces1, I. Rivas-Pollmar1, P. Acuña-Butta1, N. Butta-Coll1, V. Jiménez-Yuste2\n\n1Unidad de Coagulopatías; 2Servicio de Hematología y Hemoterapia, Hospital Universitario La Paz-IdiPAZ, Madrid, Spain\n\nIntroduction:\n\nPlastic products and packaging ensure traceability and controlled use of drugs evaluated in clinical trials (CT) but most of them have a short life use with a high ecological impact. The excessive use of plastics increases its impact as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and can have potentially harmful implications for the environment. The Thrombosis and Coagulopathies Unit of La Paz University Hospital (HULP) participates in more than 50 interventional CT in bleeding disorders. The major part of plastic comes from central laboratories kits (CLK). The CT investigator team developed a program 6 months ago to manage CLK correctly searching for a rational use.\n\nObjective: To optimize the use of the resources provided by the sponsor by designing a program for an optimal use of CLK\n\nMethods:\n\nSeveral variables as number of patients included in the CT, kind and frequency of visits, kit expiration date, reagents and tube storage conditions were defined. A program to educate staff following the local recycling guidance available on the HULP web was also set.\n\nResults:\n\nWith the identification of the influencing variables on the kit request, one registry was created. This new registry helps to manage the plastic in CT in the most effective way. In six months of program application, it was observed that only standard delivery CLK was performed. Also, we reduced laboratory queries, improved the time spent in this task, kit duplications decreased and more storage space was obtained. Finally, more than 90% of requested CLK used throughout this system are used and not wasted as before\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nThe organizational program to manage the CLK in the CT resulted in an optimized performance for the internal coordinating procedure and a sustainable initiative for the environment protection. After program application, the team observed the managing process of the CLK for the 50 local CT was easier and this improved the work quality. Besides, this program attached to the Guidance for Recycling from HULP ensures an effective recycling process. We could be much closer to integrate in our daily working routines the crackdown on plastic pollution as WHO calls. This approach may be helpful to inspire a search for a better balance between human health and environment protection\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nT. Cebanu: None declared, S.

Szanto1, I. Vaide2, A. Jouppila3, M. Lemponen4, R. Lassila*,4\n\n1Research Program Unit of Systems Oncology, Helsinki University Hospital, Unit of Coagulation Disorders, Helsinki, Finland; 2Department of Hemato-Oncology, University of Tartu, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Tartu, Estonia; 3Clinical Research Institute HUCH; 4Research Program Unit of Systems Oncology, Helsinki University Hospital, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Hematology, Unit of Coagulation Disorders, Helsinki, Finland\n\nIntroduction:\n\nNew hemophilia non-factor therapy with emicizumab (emi), a monoclonal antibody, bridges FIXa with FX to trigger tenase action, but practical means to measure its effects are lacking. We aimed at assessing the role of intrinsic pathway in the action of emi by using specific (APTT-based coagulation factor assays) and global (prothrombin fragments (F1+2) and ROTEMR) tests in the presence or absence of intrinsic pathway influence (corn-trypsin inhibitor, CTI).\n\nMethods:\n\nFour patients were included: 3 inhibitor patients (STASEY study) and one switcher from EHL-.FVIII due to a short half-life. Repeated analyses covered once weekly the emi loading and 3-24 -month maintenance phases. Emi was also added in vitro to deficient plasmas to record the apparent factor activities.\n\nResults:\n\nIn patients, emi shortened APTT, and APTT-based one-stage assays overestimated FVIII > FXI > FXII. Chromogenic FVIII (bovine reagents) did not interfere with these emi effects. Emi improved clotting times, expressed as apparent factor activities, in the FVIII- and FXI-deficient plasma unlike in the other factor deficient plasmas. Finally, in citrated blood, in ROTEM InTEM emi only shortened clotting times, but in blood collected to CTI-citrate the procoagulant effects of emi could be followed. Also, the contact-activating NaTEM was informative both in the presence and absence of CTI. Upon follow-up, in vivo FXa generation capacity measured with circulating F1+2 did not increase, suggesting some balancing in vivo acts.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nFXI via contact activation is involved in the mechanisms of action of emi. In practice, CTI-treated citrated blood enables to display emi effects in InTEM and NaTEM.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nNone declared.\n\nP025 | Thromboelastometry in perioperative management in a patient with severe hemophilia a during orthopedic surgery\n\nT. Simurda1,*, I. Skornova1, M. Dobrotova1, I. Plamenova1, M. Brunclikova1, Z. Cibula2, L. Necas2, J. Stasko1, P. Kubisz1\n\n1National Centre of Hemostasis and Thrombosis, Department of Hematology and Transfusiology; 2Department of Orthopedics, Comenius University in Bratislava, Jessenius Faculty of Medicine in Martin, Martin, Slovakia\n\nIntroduction:\n\nHemophilia is an X-linked recessive inherited coagulation disorder. Hemophilic patients present spontaneous joint bleeding and repeated hemarthroses lead to hemophilic arthropathy. Standard coagulation tests can predict bleeding or guide hemostasis management, but it is difficult to identify what part of the intrinsic or extrinsic clotting process is disrupted. Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) analyses enable evaluation of global clotting function and the monitoring of hemostatic treatment in perioperative period.\n\nMethods:\n\nWe hereby report successful perioperative management of hemostasis in 22-year-old patient with severe hemophilia A during ankle arthrodesis. Standard laboratory tests and ROTEM were used to monitor hemostasis in the perioperative period.\n\nResults:\n\nPreoperatively was administered rFVIII 50 IU/kg (patient weight 102 kg). The surgery lasted 1.5 hours under general anesthesia without blood loss. Immediately after the surgery, the level FVIII was 78% and the level clotting time (CT) of INTEM was 255s (normal range: 100-240s). During the first 24 hours after the surgery, the patient was administered 30 IU/kg every 8 hours. The FVIII level was 89 ± 1% and CT of INTEM was 200 ± 5 s. On the 1st and 2nd postoperative day, the dose was administered to 35 IU/kg every 12 h. FVIII level was in ranged 76%-66% and CT of INTEM was 174-181 s. Bleeding symptoms were not observed. Therefore we are based on the CT of INTEM and FVIII level, the dose was reduced to 20 IU/kg every 12 hours from 3rd-7th postoperative day. During these days, FVIII level was 76%-52% and CT of INTEM was 174-82 s. On the 7th postoperative day, the patient was discharged home with a FVIII level 52% and a CT of INTEM was 82s. At home, the patient administered rFVIII dose of 20 IU/kg every 12 hours until 10th postoperative day. From 15th postoperative day was dose adjusted 30 IU/kg daily. The patient was monitored outpatiently in our center, where we adjusted dose of rFVIII.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nThese findings suggest that a combination of standard coagulation assays with ROTEM could lead to a better understanding of hemostasis in individual hemophilia patients, which in turn might be useful for the prediction of bleeding and the design of adequate perioperative management during and after surgery. Systematic monitoring using ROTEM offers a promising strategy for the use of concentrate FVIII in hemophilia A in the perioperative period.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nNone declared.\n\nP026 | Production of recombinant human blood coagulation factor VIII from pichia pastoris—A novel cost effective strategy for the treatment of haemophilia A\n\nV. E. Vijayakumar*, V. N. Janakiraman, B. C. Joseph, K. Venkataraman, M. A. Vijayalakshmi\n\nCentre for Bioseparation Technology, Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India\n\nIntroduction:\n\nFactor VIII (FVIII), a heterodimer molecule (A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2) is an essential blood coagulation factor; whose absence or loss of activity results in the clotting disorder Haemophilia A. Replacement therapy using exogenous FVIII (plasma derived/recombinant FVIII) is the most efficient strategy to treat or prevent bleeding in patients with Haemophilia A. In this work, we are addressing the efficient recovery of FVIII from 2 different recombinant sources: using mammalian sources (CHO cells) and yeast (Pichia pastoris) (a less expensive alternative).\n\nMethods:\n\nWe employed pseudobioaffinity chromatography and Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) systems which uses mild adsorption and desorption conditions unlike traditional affinity chromatography systems which uses harsh elution conditions. Histidine Ligand Affinity Chromatography (HLAC) with CIM technology was successfully employed to capture recombinant B-Domain Deleted (BDD)-FVIII in a single step from CHO cell culture supernatant, giving a functional protein. In case of yeast expression, we adopted a novel strategy to express the heavy and light chains of FVIII separately, purify them individually: heavy chain using CIM-IMAC and light chain using CIM-HLAC.\n\nResults:\n\nThese individual purified chains were successfully reconstituted in chromogenic assays to produce functional FVIII. Following the success of expression and purification of heavy and light chains, a full length B domain deleted FVIII cDNA was codon optimized, cloned into a Pichia expression vector and expression conditions are standardised.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, production of full length FVIII in Pichia pastoris may help in providing an important cost effective alternate strategy to provide much needed therapeutic FVIII for Hemophilia A treatment.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nNone declared.\n\nP027 | A von willebrand factor fragment increases the bioavailability of recombinant human FVIII (simoctocog alfa) after subcutaneous administration in pre-clinical models\n\nB. Solecka-Witulska1,*, D. Lillicrap2, A. Tiede3, L. Harpell2, A. Pender2, C. Kannicht1\n\n1Octapharma Biopharmaceuticals GmbH, Berlin, Germany; 2Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada; 3Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany\n\nIntroduction:\n\nSubcutaneous (SC) delivery could provide a convenient method of administration for factor VIII (FVIII) replacement therapy in haemophilia A (HA), but its development has been limited by poor bioavailability. von Willebrand factor (VWF) protects FVIII from proteolytic degradation and represents a promising candidate to increase bioavailability. SubQ-8 is a novel FVIII under clinical development for subcutaneous administration. It comprises the recombinant human FVIII simoctocog alfa and a dimeric recombinant human VWF fragment consisting of the FVIII-binding D'D3 domains.\n\nMethods:\n\nThe impact of the VWF fragment on FVIII and VWF activity was tested in vitro. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed in HA mice, HA dogs, and Aachener minipigs. Simoctocog alfa alone was administered intravenously (IV) or SC; SubQ-8 was administered SC. The bioavailability of simoctocog alfa after SC administration of SubQ-8 was determined as the area under the curve (AUC) relative to the AUC after IV administration of simoctocog alfa alone.\n\nResults:\n\nThe VWF fragment reduced binding of FVIII to the phospholipid monolayer in vitro, and did not interfere with binding of full-length VWF to GPIb, or VWF-mediated adhesion of platelets to collagen type III. In mice, FVIII levels and activity were significantly higher after SC administration of SubQ-8 compared with simoctocog alfa alone; the bioavailability was 18.5%. In HA dogs, the terminal half-life of simoctocog alfa after SC SubQ-8 administration was 15.5 h, a 3.3-fold prolongation compared with IV administration of simoctocog alfa alone; the SC bioavailability was 44.3%. In minipigs, the terminal half-life of simoctocog alfa after SC SubQ-8 administration was 25.3 h, a 3.6-fold prolongation compared with IV administration of simoctocog alfa alone; the bioavailability was 45.5%.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nAdministration of simoctocog alfa with a VWF fragment (SubQ-8) facilitates SC uptake of simoctocog alfa in animal models, with a bioavailability of over 40% in dogs and minipigs and a 3.5-fold prolongation of simoctocog alfa half-life compared with IV administration. These data support clinical development of SubQ-8 as a convenient FVIII treatment option for haemophilia A.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nB.

Reedtz Kjellev1\n\n1Biopharm TRU; 2Haemophilia Research; 3Research Purification, Novo Nordisk A/S, Maaloev; 4Biopharm Management, Novo Nordisk A/S, Soeborg, Denmark\n\nIntroduction:\n\nMim8 is in development for subcutaneous prophylactic treatment of people with haemophilia A (HA) & HA with inhibitors. Mim8 is a factor VIII mimicking antibody bridging FIXa and FX and is highly specific for the human components FIXa and FX to exert its action. Pharmacologic characterisation is possible in vitro & in vivo utilizing human components, and due to sequence homology in primates.\n\nAim: To evaluate Mim8 using pharmacodynamic in vitro & in vivo models in human, mouse, and cynomolgus.\n\nMethods:\n\nIn vitro Thrombin Generation Assay (TGA) dose/response was performed using human HA plasma, cynomolgus plasma with antibody-induced HA, or HA mouse plasma spiked with human FIX (hFIX) and human FX (hFX). In vivo dose/response studies under haemophilic conditions were performed in two bleeding models in mice supplemented with hFIX and hFX, and a single dose was evaluated in a novel venous tail bleeding model in cynomolgus monkeys. Animals were anaesthetized during bleeding and euthanized before awakening. Mim8 effect was compared to an emicizumab sequence-identical-analog (SIA).\n\nResults:\n\nIn vitro TGA potency of Mim8 was significantly greater benchmarked against emicizumab SIA in all tested species (14-, 9-, or 11-fold in human, mouse, or cynomolgus, respectively). In the most sensitive bleeding model in HA mice, Tail Vein Transection, bleeding was reduced dose-dependently with an ED50 of 0.05 mg/kg for Mim8 and 0.7 mg/kg for emicizumab SIA, approximately a 14-fold potency gain. Statistically significant reduction of bleeding relative to HA was observed at plasma concentrations above 10 nM for Mim8 and 300 nM for emicizumab SIA. In the more severe Tail Clip model, Mim8 treatment significantly reduced bleeding, while tested emicizumab SIA doses (up to 22 mg/kg) did not. In the single dose cynomolgus bleeding model, Mim8 as well as emicizumab SIA reduced bleeding to a level similar to normal animals.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nPharmacodynamics of Mim8 were consistent between in vitro human, in vitro & in vivo mouse with human components, and in vitro & in vivo cynomolgus monkeys. In dose/response studies, Mim8 potency relative to emicizumab-SIA was significantly elevated by 9-14 fold in tested species. Mim8 was also efficacious in the Tail Clip model (emicizumab SIA was not) and in the cynomolgus tail bleeding model.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nC. D.

Van der Meer1, on behalf of HemoNED Steering Committee\n\n1Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden; 2Van Creveldclinic, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht; 3Netherlands Hemophilia Patient Society, Nijkerk, Netherlands\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe annual bleed rate (ABR) is one of the most important treatment outcomes within the area of bleeding disorders, making validation of patient reported bleeds essential.\n\nMethods:\n\nFrom April 2018 and further, patients registered in the Dutch hemophilia patient registry started to use the mobile/web application ‘VastePrik’. They logged their infusions (date/time, reason, product, dose, batch number) and bleeds (date/time, cause, location, severity). The entries are summarized on a dashboard for both the patient and the hemophilia treatment team, supporting the evaluation of individual treatment plans. After anonymization the data can also be used for research and post marketing surveillance. Data from 1 August 2018 to 31 July 2019 were analyzed, using SPSS version 25, for patients using the app for ≥1 year.\n\nResults:\n\nBy August 2019 486 patients (or their parents) used the VastePrik app. Regular use was seen among 107 patients receiving prophylaxis. Mean age of the regular users was 35 (range 3-77) years; 84% had Hemophilia A and 9% Hemophilia B, with the vast majority having moderate or severe levels; 7% had another bleeding disorder. Within a 1-year period they logged 14.257 infusions: 90% prophylaxis, 2% precautionary (expected higher risk due to e.g. sport activities), 4% for a recent bleed, 4% follow-up treatment. In total, 515 bleeds were registered. We checked for ‘double bleeds’ defined as bleeds registered at the same or next day and at the same location of the body; 54 (10%) bleeds met these criteria. Median ABR (IQR) after removing the double bleeds was 3.0 (1.0-6.0), ranging from 0-27. Fifty-four percent of the bleeds were joint bleeds, resulting in a median (IQR) AJBR of 1.0 (0.0-4.0), ranging from 0-20. Twenty-one percent of the patients reported no bleeds, 44% reported no joint bleeds. Percent ‘double bleeds’ was the same for all versus joint bleeds.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nThe use of registry data, including patient reports, for post-authorization studies is encouraged by the European Medicines Agency. Validation of the VastePrik data revealed that approximately 10% of bleeds were registered twice by patients, affecting the ABR. It is therefore important that hemophilia treatment teams check and assure the quality of bleeds reported by patients through a digital infusion log. Furthermore, improved instructions for patients are needed explaining the importance of accurate registration of their bleeds and treatment.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nG.

E. Blouse1,*, K. Pekrun2, T. Knudsen1, J. Landau1, M. A. Kay2\n\n1Catalyst Biosciences, South San Francisco; 2Pediatrics & Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States\n\nIntroduction:\n\nCatalyst Biosciences has developed a next generation engineered coagulation Factor IX, dalcinonacog alfa (formerly CB 2679d/ISU304), which includes triplet substitutions (R318Y, T343R and R338E) to increase catalytic activity, provide resistance to antithrombin inhibition and improve affinity for activated FVIII. These enhancements resulted in a FIX variant with 22-fold enhanced potency. We previously presented the superiority of AAV delivered FIX CB 2679d-GT over the R338L Padua variant in a preclinical proof of concept study in hemophilia B mice using an AAV/DJ8 vector. Here we test the hypothesis that combination of a novel high transducing AAV chimeric capsid with the CB 2679d-GT transgene would provide significantly enhanced transgene expression and FIX activity over previously observed levels.\n\nMethods:\n\nCodon optimized wild-type (WT), CB 2679d-GT and R338L Padua FIX AAV constructs were prepared on the T148 background downstream of a robust hepatocyte-specific promoter in the ApoEHCR-hAAT-hFIX-GT hFIX minigene-bpA vector and packaged into a novel chimeric AAV capsid. The in vivo performance of the constructs was assessed in FIX-deficient hemophilia B mice injected with 2 × 1010 vg/mouse and followed over time. FIX antigen levels and FIX activity levels were assessed by ELISA and aPTT.\n\nResults:\n\nThe in vivo performance of the three FIX constructs was followed over time and demonstrated stabilizing antigen levels by week three that were ~10-fold higher than previously observed using the DJ/8 capsid. As expected, FIX activity levels were significantly increased for the CB 2679d-GT and Padua variants versus those observed with mice receiving the wild-type transgene at week three (109 IU/mL and 45 IU/mL versus 6 IU/mL for CB 2679d-GT, Padua, and wild-type respectively). Thus, in line with the antigen data, the observed FIX activity levels for CB 2679d-GT were more than 10-fold higher than those found in the previous study using the DJ/8 vector at comparable doses.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nThis study demonstrates that combining a next generation AAV vector with the potency enhanced FIX variant, CB 2679d-GT has the potential to improve transgene expression and effectively lower the viral dose needed to achieve relevant FIX activity levels.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nG.

It provides objective and dynamic information about articular status and has risen as an important tool for haemophilic joint evaluation and follow-up. Point-of-care Ultrasonography, being a dynamic, non-invasive, painless, not requiring anaesthesia or contrast, can be performed on patients of any age, gender, and allows for the study of multiple joints consecutively, on a daily basis if required and has a lower cost than the MRI. It is important to have sensible diagnostic methods that can reliably detect lesser changes in joints that otherwise seem healthy\n\nAim\n\nEarly detection by ultrasonography of subclinical bleedings in elbow, knee and ankle joints.\n\nMethods:\n\nCadaveric study was performed. Intra-articular blood injections were performed in each joint until achieving the visualization of the hemarthrosis in the ultrasound image.\n\nResults:\n\nUltrasound is sensible diagnostic method that can detect small changes in joints. Detection of small intra articular volumes of bleeding with ultrasonography is possible due to the echogenicity and haemodynamic properties of blood.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nultrasonography can accomplish a critical role, because it detects small amounts of blood, and early articular alterations, which allows for the follow up of musculoskeletal pathology in patients with haemophilia.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nNone declared.\n\nP032 | DNA and neutrophil extracellular traps release, novel potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets of joint damage in hemophilia\n\nH. Caviglia1,*, P. Oneto2, M. E. Landro1, C. Daffunchio1, A. L. Douglas Price1, M. Schattner2, J. Etulain2\n\n1Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology, Dr. Juan A. Fernández Hospital; 2Laboratory of Experimental Thrombosis, IMEX-CONICET/ANM, Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\nIntroduction:\n\nHemarthroses cause major morbidity in hemophilia resulting in chronic hemophilic synovitis (CHS), osteochondral degeneration and arthropathy. Although the initial events causing joint damage remain uncertain, iron and monocytes-induced inflammation are known players in this process. The role of neutrophils, major immune blood cells infiltrated in synovium after bleeding is unknown. Neutrophils release extracellular DNA traps (NETs), microbicides structures containing DNA fibers with bound granular enzymes as elastase. During chronic inflammation, a cytotoxic effect of NETs has been associated with tissue damage in lung, kidney, skin and joints. Our aim is to elucidate the role of neutrophils in CHS by studying the formation of synovial NETs and its correlation with joint damage.\n\nMethods:\n\nSynovial fluids (SF) and peripheral blood-derived plasma were obtained from 23 patients (28 ± 11 years old, 22 Haemophilia type A, 1 type B). Chronic synovitis was present in 1 ankle and 22 knee joints that were evaluated for Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS). NETs in SF and plasma were indirectly determined by quantification of DNA (fluorometry) and directly by measuring DNA-Elastase complexes (ELISA). Pearson or Spearman correlations with clinical parameters were calculated.\n\nResults:\n\nDNA (0.35 ± 0.07 μg/mL) and DNA-Elastase (0.27 ± 0.03Abs) were detected in SF of CHS patients and they were positively correlated with HJHS (r > 0.5, P < 0.05). Moreover, incubation of SF with fresh blood-isolated neutrophils resulted in the release of NETs in vitro indicating that pro-NETotic factors remain active in SF.\n\nWhile DNA or DNA-Elastase were not detected in plasma of healthy donors, they were found in the plasma of CHS patients (DNA = 0.15 ± 0.04 μg/mL; DNA-Elastase = 0.15 ± 0.05Abs) and showed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.7, P < 0.05) with the synovial levels of both parameters.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nOur data demonstrate that NETs are formed in synovium of CHS patients. The positive correlation of synovial DNA and DNA-Elastase levels with joint damage suggests that synovial NETs formation might be a potential therapeutic target for CHS. Moreover, the strong correlation of synovial and plasma levels of NETs suggests that circulating NETs represents a potential biomarker of CHS evolution.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nNone declared.\n\nP033 | Optimization of the method of obtaining highly active concentrate of FVIII\n\nN. Shurko*\n\nSI “Institute of Blood Pathology and Transfusion Medicine NAMS of Ukraine”, Lviv, Ukraine\n\nIntroduction:\n\nNowadays, concentrates medicines from the human plasma play a key role in the treatment of patients with bleeding disorders. The preparations of FVIII are used in the treatment of hemophilia A. The process of purification of FVIII from plasma is a difficult problem for three major reasons: the low concentration of FVIII protein in plasma; instability of the procoagulant activity and the difficulty in separating fibrinogen from FVIII.\n\nPurpose of the work\n\nOptimization of a process obtaining FVIII by the use different methods of purification.\n\nMethods:\n\nPrecipitation of proteins, ion-exchange chromatography and dye-ligands affinity chromatography, statistical analyses.\n\nResults:\n\nThe dye-ligands have been considered as one of the important alternative to natural counterparts for specific affinity chromatography. We investigated that the proteins of the prothrombin complex (thrombin, factors VII, IX, and X), albumin and fibrinogen bind to the dye-ligands (positive chromatography) unlike FVIII and von Willebrand's factor (vWF) (negative affinity chromatography).\n\nElimination of impurity proteins allows to isolate those that are in much lower concentrations (FVIII) and to improve the analytical characteristics of the investigated protein. Installed that the process of purification of the FVIII by the method dye-ligand chromatography with Diasorb-Procion Blue HB allowed to achieve a maximum purification rate of 10.36 times.\n\nThe combinations of the pre-fractionation method (0.08 M barium citrate, 3.0% aluminum hydroxide (III) and 3.5% PEG-4000) with the method of dye-ligand affinity chromatography on selected sorbent allows obtaining FVIII with a degree of purification of 92.75 times.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that the combination of ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose FAST FLOW and affinity chromatography allows obtaining FVIII with a degree of purification of 129.44 times.\n\nIt has been found that the use of all three methods (pre-fractionation, ion-exchange and affinity chromatography) stages provides a purification rate of FVIII 343.06 times.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nThe process purification FVIII from human plasma have been developed in combination of methods of pre-fractionation, ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and affinity sorption macrospores silica sorbents Diasorb-Procion Blue HB. The maximum degree of purification was 343.06 times.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nNone declared.\n\nP034 | Non-canonical MYD88/TIRAP-dependent anti-inflammatory function of pro-coagulant factor VIII\n\nS. Mignot1,*, S. Delignat2, S. Lacroix Desmazes2, C. Bole1, S. Tei1, A. Kiddinan1, O. Hermine1, L. Frenzel1\n\n1Institut Imagine; 2Laboratory of therapeutic immunopathology and immunointervention, Paris Descartes—Sorbonne Paris Cité University, CRC, INSERM UMRS 1138 team 16, Paris, France\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe patients with hemophilic arthropathy have an increased inflammatory pattern. Prophylactic treatment of hemophilia A patients with the FVIII protein efficiently prevents bleeding events and preserves joint function.\n\nRecently, evidence for novel functions for FVIII across multiple systems, including the cardiovascular system, angiogenesis and maintenance of bone health has emerged.\n\nHowever, no study has shown the involvement of FVIII in inflammation.\n\nHypothesis\n\nHere, we demonstrate that FVIII has an anti-inflammatory role and impacts the NF-κB pathway, independently from coagulation pathway .\n\nMethods:\n\nHuman fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) were isolated from synovial tissues from different HA patients. We also used commercial normal and rheumatoid arthritis FLS, as well as THP-1. In particular, THP1-Blue NK-κB cells allow monitoring the NF-κB signaling transduction pathway. Different commercial recombinant FVIII were tested following dialysis. FLS and THP1 were activated or not with LPS in the presence or absence of FVIII. Alternatively, THP1-Blue were activated or not with different PRR agonists for 24 hours: TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5.\n\nResults:\n\nAnti-inflammatory effect of FVIII\n\n- After LPS stimulation and incubation with FVIII, cells expressed a unique profile of cytokine secretion, with a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. This anti-inflammatory effect was not found when other coagulation factors.\n\nFVIII is involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway through MYD88/TIRAP interaction\n\n- Incubation of THP1 cells with the different TLR agonists resulted in an increase in the NF-KB signaling pathway. In the presence of FVIII, a decrease in NF-KB signaling was observed with TLR-2 and TLR-4 agonists but not with the TLR-5 agonist. NF-KB translocation in the nucleus, performed by AMNIS, was decreased when cells were incubated with FVIII after TLR-2/TLR-4 activation.\n\n- Analysis of differences between TLR-2/TLR-4 and TLR-5 pathways showed that TIRAP is required only in TLR-2/TLR-4 to interact with MyD88 while TLR-5 pathway is required only for MyD88 activation.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, our study suggests a new potential role for FVIII in the control of inflammation through the NF-kB pathway. Further investigations are ongoing with animal models to confirm these data and clinical study will be performed.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nNone declared.\n\nP035 | Preclinical characterisation of Mim8—A next-generation FVIII mimetic bispecific antibody\n\nS.

Hilden1\n\n1Novo Nordisk A/S, Maaloev, Denmark; 2enEvolv, Medford, MA, United States; 3Novo Nordisk A/S, Beijing, China; 4LEO Pharma A/S, Ballerup, Denmark\n\nIntroduction:\n\nMim8 is a novel, next-generation FVIII mimetic human bispecific antibody bridging FIXa and FX to stimulate FX activation. Mim8 is in development for subcutaneous treatment of people with Haemophilia A (HA) with or without FVIII inhibitors.\n\nMethods:\n\nMim8 was developed using the DuoBody® technology to identify the best anti-FIXa and anti-FX antibodies for further mutational optimisation. Key parameters for optimisation included efficient activation of FX by FIXa in the presence of procoagulant membrane, low target binding in blood circulation, low immunogenicity risk, and low viscosity. The activity of Mim8 was tested in thrombin generation assays (TGA) and by thromboelastography (TEG). The TGA was initiated with FXIa or with tissue factor (TF) using congenital HA plasma or normal human plasma spiked with anti-FVIII antibodies. The TEG was initiated with low level TF/recalcification only using human whole blood spiked with anti-FVIII antibodies. In vivo, the effect of Mim8 was assessed in two tail bleeding models using FVIII-deficient mice co-dosed with human FIX and FX to circumvent lack of Mim8 cross reactivity to murine FIX and FX. The PK of Mim8 was studied in cynomolgus monkeys.\n\nResults:\n\nMim8 efficiently assembled FIXa and FX on the phospholipid surface and stimulated FXa activation. The proteolytic activity of FIXa was stimulated ~15 × 103-fold by the monovalent anti-FIXa arm. The affinity (Kd) of Mim8 for FIXa and FX is in the micromolar range, minimising target binding in the blood. Mim8 efficiently stimulated thrombin generation in both TGA assays and enhanced clot formation in TEG. The potency of Mim8 in these assays was ~15 times greater than the potency of the FVIII mimetic antibody emicizumab. A similar potency improvement was demonstrated in a tail vein transection bleeding model in mice. The terminal half-life of Mim8 was ~14 days in cynomolgus monkeys.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion:\n\nMim8 is a novel, next-generation FVIII mimetic bispecific antibody which potently stimulates FX activation and thereby the haemostatic capacity as demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. The high potency of Mim8 is expected to enable administration of small volumes in a pen device. Further, minimal target binding in the blood, good PK and biophysical properties of Mim8 support clinical development of Mim8 as a potentially improved FVIII mimetic prophylactic treatment for persons with haemophilia A regardless of inhibitor status.\n\nDisclosure of Interest:\n\nS.
