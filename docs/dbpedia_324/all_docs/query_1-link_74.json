In our previous studies we showed the decreased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and its impaired integrity in varicose veins. There is an evidence of the link between mtDNA copy number, mitochondrial membrane potential, oxygen consumption, and ATP synthesis. Varicose veins are characterized by endothelial dysfunction and reduction of smooth muscle cells’ contractile function. We aimed at investigating possible alterations of mitochondria functions (in in terms of mitochondrial membrane potential of the vein wall constituents: endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of t. intima and t. media layers, correspondingly) in varicose veins.\n\nMethods: The study was conducted according to the principles written in the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by our institutional committee. Post-operation material of paired GSV samples (varicose (VV) and non-varicose (NV) vein segments left after surgery from a corresponding patient, C2-C4 CEAP classes) was placed in cell culture media and subjected to live-staining with mitochondrion-selective fluorescent probes: mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent TMRM and -independent MitoTracker Deep Red, as well as with nucleus-selective probe NucBlue. To visualize a particular vein wall layer, images were taken at different z-axis series using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Measurements of signal intensities were performed using ZEN 3.1 (blue edition) software (Zeiss, Germany). Relative levels of mitochondrial membrane potential were calculated as the [mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent/mitochondrial membrane potential-independent intensities] ratios within each cell/image field/sample. Statistical analysis was performed in Excel and STATISTICA packages, using Student's t-test (for comparison between multiple cells/image fields within a subgroup) and Wilcoxon-signed rank test (for comparison between paired NV and VV segments).\n\nResults: We found that that mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased in ECs and SMCs of VV compared to NV segments 2.98- and 5.08-fold, correspondingly (n=5, p<0.05). The representative images are shown in Figure 1. More thorough analysis will be performed in the nearest future.\n\nConclusion: Though preliminary, these findings provide a possible link between vascular ECs and SMCs functional activity and their mtDNA content in varicose veins. The work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (project No. 22-25-00832).\n\nKeywords: varicose veins, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, mitochondrial membrane potential\n\nMid-term and long-term results of various treatment strategies for patients with recurrent varicose veins of the lower extremities\n\nKonstantin Chernykh1\n\n1City Alexander Hospital\n\nBackground: The treatment of varicose veins of the lower extremities (VVLE) is an extremely urgent task. Comparison of different ways to eliminate this disease has always been the focus of attention of phlebologists.Target. Study of mid-term and long-term results of radiofrequency ablation (RFO) and endovasal laser ablation (EVLA) in patients with LVL.\n\nMethods: For the period from 2013 - 2017, 257 EVLA (group 1) and 151 RFO (group 2) were performed at the City Alexander Hospital, St. Petersburg. For RFO, the radio frequency device Closure RFG was used. For EVLA, the ALOD-01 laser device with a wavelength of 1470 nm was used.\n\nResults: All patients in 100% of cases came for examination after 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. After 1 month, according to the results of ultrasound examination (ultrasound), in 100% of cases, recanalization is not observed in both groups. In the first group, 85.6% (220) of patients had no pigmentation, 14.4% (37) still had pigmentation. In the second group, 23.2% (35) of patients did not have pigmentation, 76.8% (116) did. After 3 months, according to the results of ultrasound in 100% of cases, recanalization is not observed in both groups. In the first group in 100% of cases there is no pigmentation. In the second group, 72.2% (109) of patients did not have pigmentation, 27.8 (42) did. After 6 months, according to the results of ultrasound in patients of the first group, 100% of cases of recanalization are not observed, which is statistically significantly different from the structure of this symptom in patients of the second group (p<0.001): recanalization is observed in 29.8% (45) of patients, there is no recanalization only in 70.2% of patients. After 1 year, according to the results of ultrasound in patients of the first group, 100% of cases of recanalization are not observed, which is statistically significantly different from the structure of this symptom in patients of the second group (p<0.001): recanalization is observed in 29.8% (45) of patients, there is no recanalization only in 70.2% (106) of patients. After 2 years, according to the results of ultrasound in patients of the first group, 100% of cases of recanalization are not observed, which is statistically significantly different from the structure of this symptom in patients of the second group (p<0.001): recanalization is observed in 41.7 (63) patients, there is no recanalization only in 58.3% (88) of patients.\n\nConclusion: EVLA showed greater efficiency and low complication rate in the mid-term and long-term periods compared to RFO.\n\nKeywords: endovasal laser ablation, varicose veins of the lower extremities, radiofrequency ablation\n\nRadiation diagnosis of varicose veins of the pelvis of a man\n\nOleg Zhukov1\n\n1Medical Institute of RUDN University\n\nBackground: A significant contribution to the syndrome of chronic pelvic pain in men is made by varicose transformation of the veins of the pelvis.\n\nMethods: From September 2011 to September 2021, 568 patients with varicocele were examined. The age of patients ranged from 18 to 59 years and averaged 35.3±19.2 The examination included a survey, physical examination, ejaculate analysis, study of the level of sex hormones, Doppler ultrasound of the scrotum and TRUS of the prostate gland, MR phlebography of the inferior vena cava . Patients with varicocele and diagnosed infertility underwent surgical treatment - microsurgical varicocelectomy (Marmara) or endovascular sclerotherapy, with a relapse of the disease.\n\nResults: Varicocele was left-sided in 361 (63.6%), right-sided in 9 (1.5%) and bilateral in 198 (34.9%) patients. In all cases, there was an expansion of the veins of the paraprostatic plexus on the side of the identified varicocele according to transrectal ultrasound. Stage 1 maximum diameter of paraprostatic veins on the affected side of the varicocele is less than 5 mm, blood flow velocity in the veins is less than 5 cm / s, the diameter does not change during the Valsalva maneuver, Stage 2 maximum diameter is more than 5 mm, the speed is 5-10 cm / s, during the Valsalva maneuver the diameter increases to 50% of the original, stage 3 the maximum diameter is more than 10 mm, the speed is more than 10 cm / s, with the Valsalva test, the diameter increases by more than 50% of the initial.\n\nConclusion: Our data indicate the relationship between varicocele and pelvic varicose veins in men.The use of our classification will improve the results of treatment of patients with varicocele\n\nKeywords: varicose veins, male pelvis, TRUZI\n\nEndovenous Laser Ablation 1940 nm, First 1000 Cases\n\nDmitrii Slavin1, Alexander Chugunov1, Ilsear Shamsutdinova2, Matvey Parikov3\n\n1Kazan State Medical Academy, Russia\n\n2Fleboestetic Clinic, Kazan, Russia\n\n3Innovative vascular centre, Saint-Petersburg, Russia\n\nBackground: Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) of saphenous veins still has some controversies in optimal laser wavelength, treatment protocol and types of fibers. We have a ten years’ experience with 1470 and 1560 nm diode lasers for EVLA. In recent years we use a new wavelength 1940 nm and evaluate our results of the treatment.\n\nMethods: 1000 patients from 2020, CEAP C2-C6. GSV 71,4%, SSV 11,4%, AASV 5,9%, GSV+SSV 4,8%, GSV+AASV 6,5%. Treated veins with a diameter of more than 15 mm - 10,8%. EVLA was performed on an ambulatory basis with tumescent anesthesia and 1940 nm laser (IPG Photonics Corporation, Russia). In all cases we used «thin» radial fibers with outer diameter 1,24 mm or 1,6 mm (Lightguide, Biolitec) and peripheral intravenous 16G or 14G catheters for cannulation. We used standard treatment protocol: continuous mode with power range 4-8 Watts, automatic fiber pull-back speed 0,75-1 mm/sec and LEED 40-106 J/cm dependent from the vein diameter. Relatively straight varicose tributaries were also treated with EVLA. In others cases concomitant phlebectomy or sclerotherapy of varicose tributaries was performed. Post-procedure compression indicated for 1-2 weeks. In postoperative period we evaluated the occlusion rate, duration of analgesics, endothermal heat induced thrombosis (EHIT) and other complications. Ultrasound imaging was performed on the 1st and 7th day and 6 months after the EVLA.\n\nResults: Initial occlusion rate was 100%, only 1 recanalization (SSV) was observed 6 months after EVLA, taking into account that we reduced LEED to 40-106 J/cm compared with previous LEED of 67-160 J/cm with 1470/1560 nm lasers. We successfully treated veins with a diameter less than 0,8 cm with 1,2 mm radial fibers and veins more than 0.8 cm with 1,6 mm radial fibers, maximal diameter of the treated vein was 3 cm. Sometimes we also observed carbonization and sticking of the fiber tip. Analgesics were taken by only 6,7% of the patients on the first day after EVLA. Endothermal heat induced thrombosis was revealed in 0,8% of patients in the first two weeks: EHIT II – 0,6%, EHIT III – 0,2%. No burns, infections and pulmonary embolism occurred. We observed transient paresthesia in 3% of patients.\n\nConclusion: EVLA 1940 nm with radial fibers is highly effective, safe and painless procedure in the treatment of incompetent saphenous veins. According to our experience the postoperative period is the same compared with 1470/1560 nm lasers. But we can perform EVLA 1940 nm with a relatively low LEED and «thin» fibers without introdusers kits in all patients and in some cases we can also treated varicose tributaries.\n\nKeywords: EVLA, 1940 nm, \"thin\" radial fiber\n\nVenous disorders as an occupational disease: data, pathophysiology, and modification strategies\n\nTobias Hirsch1, Uwe Wahl2\n\n1Practice for Internal Medicine and Vascular Diseases, Vein Competency Center, Halle (Saale), Germany\n\n2BG Hospital Bergmannstrost Halle, Department of Internal Medicine, Halle (Saale), Germany\n\nBackground: Chronic Venous Disease (CVD) is closely linked to the modern working world. Tasks carried out in a standing or seated position play a role in the development of venous disorders. Though not commonly recognized as an occupational disease, venous disorders must be taken into account in the design of workspaces. This review aims to analyze the literature on the relationship between CVD and occupational exposure.\n\nGrowth of the tertiary economic sector and the prevalence of CVD\n\n(a) There are 3 economic sectors: the primary sector of raw material production (blue), the secondary manufacturing sector (orange) and the tertiary service sector (grey). While the primary economic sector is characterized by a high level of physical activity, standing and sitting activities dominate the secondary and tertiary sectors. (b) The dominant increase of the tertiary sector is connected to an increase of the prevalence of the CVD.\n\nMethods: A systematic review through Pubmed and the library of the clinics for occupational medicine identified 306 articles. Full text articles, available in English and German, reporting the point CVD in an occupational context were included.\n\nResults: Twenty three articles were identified. Various studies showed that women who spend an average of eight or more hours sitting or standing at work have a significantly higher risk of developing varicose veins than women who spend four or fewer hours in these positions. In contrast, no clear correlation between sedentary work and varicose veins can be established in men. However, there is a correlation between the number of years men worked in a standing position and the severity of CVD. A large observational study of >6000 randomly selected men and women concluded that the relative risk of hospitalization for varicose vein surgery increased 1.8-fold for those whose jobs consisted predominantly of standing or walking. The significance of sitting and standing as occupational cofactors in the development of varicose veins and venous symptoms was highlighted in a study of 2,000 randomly selected French volunteers. While height and a higher BMI had little correlation with the development of ankle edema, there was a significant link with activity (sitting and standing). Venous pressure varies depending on the position of the body: approx. 5mmHg when lying down, 80mmHg when standing, 45-60mmHg when seated, and 25-30mmHg when walking. Patients with CVD exhibit muscular changes including atrophy of the myofibrils, dilatation, proliferation of the interfascial veins and inflammatory changes, which further reduce the pumping function. Lack of muscle activity causes endothelial dysfunction, increases vascular permeability of the veins, and activates leukocytes and platelets. Studies show that compression therapy can lessen this effect.\n\nConclusion: Occupational stress impacts the venous system more than the risk factors of body weight, gender and predisposition. Hence preventive measures - especially in the workplace - have the potential to be highly effective. Optimal venous hemodynamics in the workplace can be achieved through interventional changes to the work environment, the individual, and the organization of work. The three intervention strategies are to be applied in an additive manner.\n\nKeywords: CVD, occupational disease, workplace, economic sector, varicose veins\n\nAdhesion molecules and their ligands in patients with varicose veins\n\nRoman Kalinin1, Igor Suchkov1, Natalya Korotkova1, Nina Mzhavanadze1\n\n1Ryazan State Medical Univeristy, Russia\n\nBackground: interactions between the cells as well as between the cells and extracellular matrix proteins are mediated by the adhesion molecules and are some of the key biochemical processes. Initial stages of leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium are mediated by non-specific non-covalent interactions between the selectins and their glycoprotein ligands, particularly, P-selectin and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1). This pilot study was aimed at assessing the expression of P-selectin and PSGL-1 in patients with varicose veins.\n\nMethods: the study included 24 patients (12 females, 12 males), aged 47.5 (44; 57), among which 12 subjects had symptomatic varicose veins, clinical class C2s according to the CEAP classification, and 12 subjects were used as control (healthy volunteers). The participants of the study were comparable in age and gender. Serum samples were isolated from peripheral venous whole blood samples. Quantitative measurement of P-selectin and its glycoprotein ligand PSGL-1 was performed using the Sandwich Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) with ELISA Kit for Selectin, Platelet (SELP) (catalogue № SEA569Hu), PSGL-1 ELISA kit (catalogue № SEA985Hu), and Stat Fax 2100 analyzer (microplate reader) (Awareness technology Inc. PalmCity, FL 34990, USA).\n\nResults: P-selectin levels in patients with varicose veins were 55% lower as compared to the healthy volunteers, 176179.2 pg/ml and 96944.5 pg/ml, respectively (p≤0,05). The level of high affinity P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) was 70.5% higher in patients with varicose veins as compared to control, 1.9 ng/ml and 6.45 ng/ml, respectively (p≤0,05). Endothelial cell damage is further caused by the leukocyte recruiting and leukocyte invasion. As a result, soluble fragments of PSGL-1 are detected in the blood.\n\nConclusion: initial stages of chronic venous disease, namely, varicose veins class C2 according to the CEAP classification, are characterized by a lower expression of P-selectin and increased expression of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1). Adhesion molecules and their ligands may play an important role in vein-specific inflammation.\n\nKeywords: venous inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, varicose veins, selectins, adhesion molecules\n\nRole and place negative pressure wound therapy in the management of large chronic venous leg ulcers\n\nRavshan Sunnatov1, Boboyor Keldiyorov1, Dilmurod Ganiev1\n\n1AkfaMedline Hospital, Tashkent, Uzbekistan\n\nBackground: Chronic venous insufficiency which may lead venous leg ulcers (VLU) are medical and social problems, associated with chronic disability, diminished quality of life and high health-care costs. Treatment is are often very slow, and high rate of recurrence even when achieving healing of ulcers\n\nMethods: Our study included 27 patients treated with chronic venous ulcers (CVU) larger than 50 cm2, in the AkfaMedline hospital (Tashkent, Uzbekistan) during 2018-2021 yy. In all cases complex treatments were included negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) with split skin grafting (SSG). All patients were done clinical examinations and ultrasound Doppler study, 8 patients (obese patients) additionally were done MRI or CT phlebography to define causes venous hypertensions. 11 (40.7%) patients’ causes venous hypertension and VLU was primary varicose disease in the system of GSV or SSV, 14 (51.9%) patients were postphlebitic syndrome and secondary varicose disease, and 2 (7.4%) cases local venous hypertension due to incompetence deep veins and communicant veins valves. To decrease hypertension in the superficial venous system all patients primary were treated by the endovenous laser ablation, ultrasound guided ligation communicant veins, laser ablation communicant veins, miniphlebectomy, and some cases used additionally Sclerotherapy. After primary debridement VLU all patients were applied NPWT 2 times each one during for 3 days in continued regime 100-125 mm Hg st. negative pressure. When achieved clean, adequate granulated tissue was done SSG venous ulcers and NPWT continued 2 times each one during for 4 days.\n\nResults: Most of our cases (96.3%) achieved full healing applied skin grafts and healing venous ulcers during 6-10 weeks period. In 1 (3.7%) patient was observed delayed VLU more than 2 months. 2 (7.4%) patients had recurrence of small venous ulcer in the follow-up period, were done additionally Sclerotherapy for decrease venous hypertension, which helped to heal recurrent venous ulcers with aseptic dressings and elastic compression therapy.\n\nLarge venous ulcer\n\nlarge venous ulcer before operation, patient's with venous hypertension and secondary varicose disease\n\nSSG VLU post operatin\n\nPatient post operation EVLA GSV and communicant veins, NPWT, SSG - 5th day post operation\n\nConclusion: Complex treatment of CVU with including NPWT and SSG helped total healing of VLU most of cases. NPWT after correction venous hypertension provides quick wound-bed preparation and high rate skin graft intake which help long term venous ulcer treatment.\n\nKeywords: Venous ulcer, Chronic venous insufficiency, NPWT, split skin grafting\n\nHow innocent is using the glue treatment for venous insufficiency? Complications\n\nErcan Keleş1, Şahin Bozok1\n\n1Bakırçay University Çigli Training and Research Hospital\n\nBackground: Cyanoacrylate ablation therapy is one of the most commonly chosen treatment options for venous insufficiency, and therefore complications may be more frequent and varied during treatment. This study investigated the complications of cyanoacrylate ablation therapy performed at our center.\n\nMethods: In our center, 116 patients who received cyanoacrylate therapy for venous insufficiency were retrospectively over a 16-month period. A Variclose ven ablation system was used in the treatment of these patients.\n\nResults: The mean age of the patients was 49.8 (±13.2; min-max 20-58) years. 54.3% (n=63) of the patients were male. Underlying medical conditions were evaluated: 25.9% (n=30) of patients had diabetes mellitus, 27.6% (n=32) had hypertension, and 11.2% (n=13) had hyperlipidemia. Complications occured in 11 (9.5%) patients, and eight patients (72.7%) were male (p=0.197). Phlebitis was observed in five patients (4.3%), cellulitis in four patients (3.4%), abscess in one patient (0.9%), deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in one patient (0.9%). The mean age of patients who devoloped complications was 43.2% (±9.8; min-max 27-58) years. When comparing the mean age of patients who developed and did not devolop complications, it was found that patients with devoloped complications were younger (43 vs 50; p=0.041). Only one patient who devoloped complications had a history of chronic disease (p=0.027).\n\nConclusion: Our study found that one in ten patients devoloped complications and that patients with complications were younger and less likely to have chronic disease. Knowing the potential complications of performing cyanoacrylate ablation treatment may enable us to develop the proper behavior.\n\nKeywords: Cyanoacrylate, venous insufficiency, ven ablation, glue\n\nComparative characteristics of surgical treatment methods in patients with complicated forms of chronic venous insufficiency\n\nTokan Sultanaliev1, Irlan Sagandykov1, Meruyert Akzhigitova1, Almas Kenessarov1\n\n1Department of vascular surgery, National research oncology center, Nur-Sultan city, Kazakhstan\n\nBackground: The problem of surgical treatment of complicated forms of CVI is relevant all over the world. Modern phlebology considers incompetent perforating veins as one of the main pathogenetic elements of the occurrence of trophic disorders in CVI.\n\nMethods: This study summarizes the data of a retrospective analysis of the results of surgical treatment of 32 patients with a complicated form of CVI, who developed against the background of varicose veins, who were treated at the vascular surgery center of the NROC for the period from 2018 to 2022. Among the observed patients, women predominated - 62,5%, men were 37,5%. The age of the patients ranged from 42 to 68 years. Trophic ulcers in these patients were located in the lower third of the medial surface of the lower leg. The largest linear size of a trophic ulcer was measured. Up to 1 cm. – 16,6%, from 1-5 cm. - 58,3%, more than 5 cm. - 25% of patients. All the studied patients were divided into 2 groups in accordance with the CEAP classification: I (main) group consisted of 19 patients (59,37%), II (control) group consisted of 13 patients (40,62%) with a complicated form of CVI. The VCSS scale was adopted as a scale for assessing the severity of CVI. The sum of points in the main group with an average value of 20. In the control with an average value of 21. The diagnosis of the lower leg veins was carried out by ultrasound duplex scanning. In the main group, endoscopic surgery technique was used. Hospital bed days averaged 4-5 days. In the control group, subfascial ligation of perforant veins from the traditional Linton access. Hospital bed days averaged 7-10 days.\n\nResults: Regression of trophic disorders of the lower leg in patients in the main group proceeded much faster. The early reduction of the trophic ulcer is due to the minimization of the surgical wound as a result of the use of endovideosurgical techniques, which creates favorable conditions for tissue repair.This effect allowed us to reduce the bed-day in patients in the main group by 2 times. Relative to bed days in the hospital period, it was possible to reduce the size of ulcers in 9 patients (61,2%) in the main group, and in 7 patients (63,3%) in the control group, as well as to reduce the risk of postoperative complications.\n\nConclusion: The use of endovideosurgical techniques in patients with complicated forms of CVI showed good hospital results for early healing processes of trophic ulcers, reduction of postoperative complications and the number of bed days.\n\nKeywords: Endoscopic vein dissection, Subfascial vein dissection, Linton\n\nAnalysis of rare events after foam sclerotherapy in a single center (2013-2021)\n\nEnric Roche1, Cristina Marqués1\n\n1Clinica Vascular Barcelona\n\nBackground: This is an audit of AEs over an 9-year-long period, in order to identify causes and/or potential risky practices.\n\nMethods: The study was conducted as a review of a prospective database of patients treated with foam sclerotherapy between the years of 2013 and 2021. Data were analysed globally, as well as separately in two periods: 2013-2016 and 2017-2021. An analysis with descriptive statistics was conducted. For the procedures, polidocanol foam was prepared with a magnetic stirrer and room air. AEs analysed included visual disturbances, neurologic symptoms, chest pain and anxiety and deep vein thrombosis. Aesthetic results were not included.\n\nResults: From January 2013 to December 2021, 3171 sessions were performed on 740 patients (611 women (82,5%) and 129 men (17,7%)). A total of 32 AEs were registered for 23 patients, 1 man and 22 women (average age: 50,3, Range: 30-74). Incidence of AEs:1,01% of sessions (3,1% of patients). 68,75% (22/32) of events were registered in aesthetic veins treatments and 31,35% in other type of varicose veins. Out of all AEs, patients reported 12 visual disturbances (0,38%), 9 neurological events (0,28%), 7 events of chest discomfort/anxiety (0,22%), 2 cases of DVT (0,06%), 1 case of cellulitis (0,03%) and 1 Tako-Tsubo (0,03%). Medical history of migraine was present in 30,4% (7/23). PFO 3 positive of 5 checked. Neurological events were diverse with immediate recovery. Incidence and type of AEs differed along the time so data was analysed in two periods. The 1st period (2013-2016) included 355 patients and 1162 treatments. The 2nd period (2017-2021) included 385 patients and 2009 treatments. During the 1st period, AEs were reported for 2,07% of sessions (4,2% of patients), compared to 0,4% of sessions (2,08% of patients) for the 2nd period (p<0.05). Comparative type of AE in 1st period vs 2nd period goes as follows: visual disturbances, 8 events (0,69%) vs 4 events (0,20%) (p<0,05); neurologic symptoms, 9 events (0,77%) vs 0 events (p<0,05); chest discomfort, 7 events (0,22%) vs 0 events (p< 0,05). The average volume in global series was 10,2cc with average % Pol 0,4%. For the 1st period, the volume was 11,6cc and Pol 0,26%; for the 2nd period it was 7,5cc and Pol 0,65% (p<0.05). Ten patients with previous AEs followed treatment using O2CO2 without any AE.\n\nConclusion: A self-audit of AEs is advisable to analyse own results. The total volume of foam injected was related to higher complications. Migraine history should be asked routinely to identify a risk group. Even though the global complications rate was low, foam sclerotherapy is not exempt of complications.\n\nKeywords: foam sclerotherapy, adverse events, migraine, visual disturbances, neurologic symptoms\n\nCryo Laser And Cryo Sclerotherapy (CLaCS) vs MicroSclerotherapy\n\nDmitrii Rosukhovskii1\n\n1Mentor Clinic, St Petersburg, Russia\n\nBackground: The novel method of Crio-Laser And Cryo-Sclerotherapy (CLACS) has gained popularity in recent years. CLACS has a synergistic effect of laser flashes after skin cooling and sclerosant injections on the reticular and telangiectatic veins. Micro Sclerotherapy (MS) is frequently used for the esthetic treatment of reticular veins and telangiectasia of the lower limbs. These treatments sometimes lead to low satisfaction with the immediate result in the first 2-3 weeks after the treatment due to ekhymosis and the appearance of hyperpigmentation and matting.The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of MS and CLACS results.\n\nMethods: After skin cooling all dilated veins were treated with Microsecond NdYAG 1064nm laser for CLAСS therapy with energy density range 90J/cm2; then MS of the same vessel was performed with a Sodium Tetradecyl Sulfate 3 mg/ml (STS3% ex tempora was mixed with a Glucose 40% in a 1:9 ratio to increase the viscosity of the solution). MS was performed according to a similar technique in the control group. Consecutive 188 adults patients dissatisfied with their appearance of dilated veins in the legs (C1 class according to the CEAP), were included in the study. Saphenous or deep vein reflux was the exclusion criteria. The effectiveness of the procedures was evaluated by an independent expert on a 5-point scale by comparing photos before, after 1-2 weeks and after 6-10 weeks. Immediate results after one week were traced in 147 (89.6%) after CLaCS and 41 (86.7%) after MS. Long-term results of CLaCS were assessed in 121 (74.2%), and after MS – in 22 patients (51.1%).\n\nResults: CLaCS and MS groups were comparable in age (p=0.584) and gender (p=0.69). Most of the applicants were between 31 and 40 (42%), 96% were women. The average effectiveness score on a five-point scale for evaluating 1-2 weeks after the CLaCS and MS were 3.9+-0.6 and 2.3+-0.8, respectively. In CLaCS group the reduction of reticular and teleangiectayic veins more than 50% after one session was found in 105 (71.4%) pts; less than 50% in 42 (28.6%) pts. The reduction of more than 50% veins in MS groupe was found in 4 (7.2%) pts; less than 50% in 37(92.8%) pts (Table). Severe matting was found in two patients (1.4%) after CLaCS and in 9 (22%) after MS (p<0.0001). The average score in the groups 6-10 weeks after the procedures was (4.5+-0.4) CLaCS and (3.8+-0.7) MS (p<0.0001).\n\nConclusion: Improvement of the appearance of the skin after CLaCS treatment occurred faster, with a decrease in the likelihood of hyperpigmentation and matting, compared with sclerotherapy. These differences remained significant after 6-10 weeks.\n\nKeywords: CLaCS, telangiectasia, matting, NdYAG laser, hyperpigmentation\n\nThe results of Endovenous laser ablation of varicose tributaries of the limbs with lasers with a wavelength of 1470 nm and 1940 nm\n\nShokhzod Zokirkhonov1, Surat Temirov1\n\n1Vein clinic \"Phlebolife\"\n\nBackground: Chronic diseases of the veins retain their relevance to this day. Despite the emergence of minimally invasive methods for the treatment of varicose veins (VV), the search for more gentle approaches to the treatment of this problem continues. In recent years, the so-called Total endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) has appeared, in which, in addition to obliteration of the trunk vein, varicose tributaries are also subjected to laser coagulation, thereby without resorting to miniphlebectomy. This method showed good results and, with good assimilation of the technique, reduced the operation time in comparison with miniphlebectomy. The purpose of this study was a comparative analysis of the results of Endovenous laser ablation of varicose tributaries (VT) with lasers with a wavelength of 1470 nm and 1940 nm.\n\nMethods: Over the past 6 months, in our clinic, 52 patients with VV on 65 limbs underwent EVLO of VT using Bare-tip laser fibers from the company IPG. The patients were divided into two groups, the first group of patients (12 limbs) for EVLA of VT used a laser with a wavelength of 1470 nm, in the energy supply mode at a power of 6 W, while the energy was 60 J / cm. In the second group of patients (53 limbs), a laser with a wavelength of 1940 nm was used for EVLA of VT, in the energy supply mode at a power of 4.5 W, while the energy was 45 J/cm. The technique was as follows, under the control of ultrasound, a phased catheterization of varicose tributaries of the thigh or lower leg was performed with 18G angiocatheters, about from 3 to 8 catheters were used, after the Bare-tip fiber an inserted into each angiocatater, tumescent anesthesia and subsequent laser coagulation of the veins were performed.\n\nEVLO of varicose vein tributaries\n\nResults: In the postoperative period, in all patients in the area of coagulated tributaries in both groups, solid veins were observed, in the first group in 4 cases (33%), in the second group in 21 cases (32%) there were signs of phlebitis, this is redness and pain on palpation along the course coagulated veins, in the first group two patients required analgesics, in the second group 11 patients took analgesics, and these patients were also recommended topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. During 3 months, coagulated tributaries veins were obliterated.\n\nConclusion: Thus, EVLO of VT also makes it possible to achieve good results without resorting to miniphlebectomy; the choice of laser wavelength did not show any advantages among themselves and did not affect the results.\n\nKeywords: Total EVLO, varicose veins, laser ablation\n\nRussian version of the patient-reported Caprini risk assessment tool\n\nKirill Lobastov1, Ekaterina Sautina1, Anna Kovalchuk1, Irina Gritskova1, Ilya Schastlivtsev1, Leonid Laberko1\n\n1Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University\n\nBackground: The previously developed English version of the patient-reported Caprini risk assessment tool demonstrated a strong agreement with a standard physician-reported score. This study aimed to assess the concurrent validity of the Russian version of the patient-reported Caprini risk assessment tool for postoperative venous thromboembolism in surgical patients.\n\nMethods: The previously designed English version of the questionnaire was translated into Russian. A cross-sectional study enrolled patients admitted to the hospital for elective surgery was conducted. The main objective was to assess the agreement between the patient-reported and physician-reported Caprini scores. The primary outcome was measured as inter-rater reliability by Cohen's kappa (κ) coefficient. Additionally, Pearson's coefficient assessed the strength of correlation between scores, and the distribution of scatters on the Blend-Altman diagram was evaluated.\n\nResults: The study enrolled 62 patients consecutively admitted to the hospital for elective surgery in May 2021. The median age was 46.3 ± 14.2 years, 61.3% were women, 69.4% had higher education. All participants completed the questionnaire with a mean score of 4.06 ± 2.39, which did not differ from the physician-reported score (4.10 ± 2.45). There was a strong agreement (κ = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76-0.91) and a strong significant correlation (r = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91- 0.97; p <0.01) between the patient-reported and physician-reported scores. Analysis of the Bland-Altman diagram confirmed the high agreement with a clinically acceptable confidence interval for the differences of -1.58 to 1.51.\n\nConclusion: The Russian version of the patient-reported Caprini risk assessment tool strongly agrees with the physician-reported Caprini 2005 score.\n\nKeywords: venous thromboembolism, caprini score, risk assessment\n\nFunctional vein anatomy of venous epifascial net: new acquisitions on microvalves\n\nPAOLO CASONI1, EMANUELE NANNI1, MATTEO PIZZAMIGLIO1\n\n1IPPOCRATE VEIN ACADEMY\n\nBackground: The venous circulation of the lower limbs has for too long been confined to three very simple anatomo-haemodynamic concepts, namely the saphenous vein system, the terminal valves in the saphenous femoral and saphenous popliteal junctions, and the system of perforating veins.Although people of the caliber of Franceschi, just to mention the most famous, who coined the CHIVA philosophy, have tried to instill different concepts, to try to delve into the maze of venous hemodynamics, we are in the vast majority of cases, still firm in primordial concepts . This brake is mainly due to the preponderant advent of technology in medicine and surgery in general, but a lot in phlebology. How not to be fascinated by a device that enters the saphenous vein and burns it, closes it, eliminates it without removing it!\n\nMethods: We have a photographic archive of 11500 mappings (since 2001). We have demonstrated the uselessness of crossectomy, especially in the incompetence, even massive, of the terminal valve, with a reduction of relapses from 37% to 11% at 8 years, (JVS-2013) and now we are working on the possibility of preserving a reflux saphenous axis a targeted and conservative way, making sure to bring the superficial venous system back to 20 years earlier out of the CHIVA method.\n\nvein viewer\n\nThe infrared light can help us on finding the exact direction of the micro-flow through the microvalves analysis.\n\nResults: The purpose of this anatomical and hemodynamic presentation to introduce anatomical variables concerning the epifascial venous system, the anatomical anomalies often present, the perforating and communicating veins, the lymphatic system and inguinal lymph nodes; in particular focusing on the microvalves of the N 4 system, always present and never studied, trying to insert simple hemodynamic concepts, which derive from the physiological attempt of the blood to go up towards the heart, always proceeding from the surface to the depth in a system that is not always valved at times protected by elastic and / or fibrotic extrinsic components (compartments) and at other times instead weak, without valves and due to facts of embryonic origin more susceptible to variations deriving from the inexorable daily action of the force of gravity.\n\nConclusion: To these non-modifiable elements, other variables of behavioral origin (lifestyle), hereditary, hormonal, alimentary, or sometimes iatrogenic origin are added, so much so as to make the system further complicated, stimulating and invitation to considerations for clinical and experimental studies and research that may in the future open doors to new hypotheses for the treatment of venous insufficiency.\n\nKeywords: saphenous sparing, microvalves, venous valves, venous reflux\n\nSurgical timing in symptomatic superficial venous insufficiency of lower extremity: our clinical experience\n\nHüseyin Sicim1, Ali Fedakar2\n\n1Kırklareli Training and Research Hospital, Kırklareli, Turkey\n\n2Hisar İntercontinental Hospital, İstanbul, Turkey\n\nBackground: There is no common consensus with clinical correlation between medical follow-up and surgical planning time in patients with lower extremity superficial venous insufficiency, which is common in the community. In our study, we aimed to present the most appropriate surgical time and results in symptomatic patients.\n\nMethods: Our patients who were admitted to the outpatient clinic and followed up due to symptomatic lower extremity superficial venous insufficiency between September 2018 and April 2022 were reviewed retrospectively. We used three parameters to decide on the operation in these symptomatic patients. In these patients, CEAP ≥ 2, reflux ≥ grade III, vein diameter >5mm were evaluated, and the decision to operate was made in patients who were found to be positive in these three parameters. The patients whose three parameters were not positive were followed up with variegated stockings and drug therapy. At the control examination performed three months later, pain scores and symptoms were compared and a significant difference was searched.\n\nResults: Thirty-eight of 156 patients with symptomatic venous insufficiency that we followed up were operated because these three parameters were positive. The remaining 118 patients were followed up with medical treatment and various stockings, since three parameters did not positivity. Pain scores and other symptoms were evaluated at the 3rd month follow-up of these patients. When the pain scores were compared, it was determined that there was a statistically significant difference between them compared to the pre-treatment (p<0.01). There was no significant difference between CEAP scores, insufficiency degrees and vessel diameters (p>0.05). Significant improvement was observed in the postoperative symptoms and pain scores of the operated patients (p<0.01). No complications were observed in any of the patients during the follow-up period.\n\nConclusion: There is still no consensus on the treatment of lower extremity venous insufficiency, which is very common. In our clinical experience, we performed surgery on patients with CEAP≥2, reflux ≥ grade III, and vein diameter >5mm.In patients who did not reach the level of the coexistence of these three parameters, a serious improvement in symptoms was observed with medical treatment and various stockings, and the operation was no longer needed or postponed. Therefore, we think that evaluating these three parameters together will be a guide in surgical planning.\n\nKeywords: venous insufficiency, lower extremity, surgical timig\n\nMay-Husni Procedure. A Case Report With 24-year Follow-up\n\nEduardo de Aguiar1\n\n1Spaço Vascular\n\n2Universidade de São Paulo\n\nBackground: Treatment of deep venous system obstruction of the lower limb is a challenge. There are few cases described in the literature even less with long-term follow-up which justifies this presentation. The objective is to report the case of a patient who underwent the May-Husni procedure for the treatment of femoral vein obstruction secondary to a stab wound with a 24-year follow-up.\n\nMethods: Case report.\n\nResults: A 37-year-old male was stabbed in the left groin causing major bleeding and was operated on immediately 8 years ago. Since then he complained of edema, pigmentation, dermatofibrosis and recurrent ulcers in the left lower limb. Phlebography revealed femoral vein occluded from Hunter's canal to the saphenofemoral junction, obstruction of femoral vein, insufficient leg perforators, collateral venous circulation; the great saphenous vein (GSV) and external iliac vein were patent. He was operated on in 1997 and the left GSV was anastomosed to the popliteal vein above the knee (May-Husni procedure). The ulcers healed after 3 months with the help of compression therapy. After 18 months ulcer recurred. Echo color-doppler (ECD) showed four dilated perforating veins and patent saphenopopliteal anastomosis. Endoscopic subfascial perforation surgery (SEPS) was performed: the ulcer healed after 15 days. In 2019, another ulcer recurrence. During these 20 years patient became obese, diabetic and hypertensive. The ECD showed the saphenopopliteal anastomosis patent and GSV dilatated (11.4 mm) and insufficient with an insufficient dilated tributary in the middle third of the thigh finding several leg varicose tributaries. Ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS) was performed under pharmacological prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) followed by compression therapy. The ulcer healed after one month. Patient was followed up until 2021 when he died of COVID-19.\n\nMay-Husni procedure\n\nConclusion: the ligation of veins in the deep venous system (DVS) can trigger severe manifestation and segmental obstructions should be restored; these restorations may have a high success rate and are durable; the patient must be accompanied throughout his life and treated as soon as the first signs of chronic venous disease appear.\n\nKeywords: venous insufficiency, post-thrombotic syndrome, vein ulcer.\n\nRemoval of Vena Cava Inferior Tumor Thrombüs. Our experience and a review of the literatüre\n\nİsmail Selçuk1, Nehir Selçuk2, Aykan Atambay2\n\n1Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Sultan Abdulhamid Han Teaching and Research Hospital\n\n2Siyami Ersek Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery Center Cardiovascular Surgery Clinic\n\nBackground: Tumors of the inferior vena cava (IVC) may be of primary venous origin or may develop with malignant tumor infiltration from the surrounding tissue. It may extend between the iliac vein and the right atrium. Due to the widespread involvement of the tumor, a multidisciplinary approach may be required in the surgery. In this study, we aimed to analyze data related to the patient evaluation, perioperative management, patient-specific surgical technique and also prognosis in malignant tumors involving IVC.\n\nMethods: Retrospective records of the patients who were operated for IVC tumor thrombosis between January 2012 and January 2022 were reviewed. The symptoms on admission, surgical approach, intraoperative bleeding, postoperative intensive care stay and hospital stay, early morbidity and mortality were recorded.\n\nResults: Twelve patients who were operated for IVC tumor-associated thrombosis between January 2012 and January 2022 were included in the study. Two of the patients had primary IVC tumors (one patient with leiomyoma, one with leiomyosarcoma), and 10 had secondary IVC tumor (4 patients had level 2 renal cell carcinoma, 3 patients had level 3 renal cell carcinoma, 3 patients had level 4 renal cell carcinoma). The mean age of the patients was 58 years. Seven of the patients were female and five were male. Five patients had flank pain, three had hematuria, three had swelling in the legs, and one had palpitations. IVC patch angioplasty was performed in three patients, and primary repair of the IVC was performed in nine patients. Mean blood loss was 2350 ±350 ml. The mean duration of the intensive care stay was 2 days, and the length of hospitalization was 7±2 days. Perioperative morbidity was 16% (n=2); hospital mortality was 8% (n=1). All follow-up documents were obtained for all of the patients.\n\nıvc patch plasty\n\nConclusion: Various surgical approaches were used for the removal of tumor thrombus of the inferior vena cava. Surgical approach and outcome differ according to the tumor size and location, the level of the thrombus, the extent of the local invasion of IVC, a concomitant hepato-renal dysfunction or any associated comorbidity. A meticulous preoperative planning and the adoption of a multidisciplinary approach are needed in the treatment of high-level IVC thrombosis for a successful surgical outcome.\n\nKeywords: venous thrombus, inferior vena cava, tumor thrombus, renal cell ca\n\nThrombectomy? sclero-aspiration? Simple aspiration-evacuation of trapped blood after foam sclerotherapy?\n\nGilles GACHET1, GACHET Gilles1\n\n1SOCIETE FRANCAISE DE PHLEBOLOGIE\n\n2SOCIETE FRANCAISE DE PHLEBOLOGIE\n\nBackground: Ultrasound-Guided Foam Sclerotherapy is widely used in the world to treat varicose veins. Sometime a painful fibrous cord occurs after foam injection, more rarely during the following months.\n\nPainful induration after foam sclerotherapy\n\nreaction after UGFS\n\nMethods: Biological and pathological of 8 samples of aspirated fluid from 8 differents patients feeling a painful post-foaming reaction were analysed.\n\nResults: This study revealed that it was normal hemo-concentrated blood without inflammation markers activation for the 8 patients.\n\nConclusion: This not serious advert event is due to blood trapped in the vein. It must be differentiated from a superficial venous thrombosis because its treatment is based on local aspiration but not general anticoagulation or othr local treatments. This aspiration-evacuation quickly relieves patients, thus proving a process of tissue hyperpressure instead of a local inflammation. We must not hesitate to use a syringe to aspirate blood inside the hardened painful vein that occurs sometime after foam sclerotherapy.\n\nKeywords: foam sclerotherapy, superficial thrombosis, blood aspiration\n\nEIGHT YEAR RESULTS OF PATIENTS WITH ENDOVENOUS ABLATION USING N-BUTYL CYANOACRYLATE (VARICLOSE)\n\nAlptekin YASIM1, Erdinc EROGLU1, Mehmet ACIPAYAM1\n\n1Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University Faculty of Medicine\n\nBackground: To present the 8-year results of 180 patients treated endovenous ablation using N-butyl cyanoacrylate (Variclose) in 2014.\n\nMethods: We previously published the 30-month results of 168 patients we could follow-up. Thirteen more patients out of follow-up in 8 years. The remaining 155 patients were clinically examinated and their VCSS were recorded. Doppler USG was performed and it was evaluated whether the saphenous veins were occluded, partially recanalized or fully recanalized.\n\nResults: The mean age of 155 patients was 47.4 ± 11.8 years. The fifty eight patients were male and 97 were female. While the mean VCSS was 10.2 before the procedure, it was 2.7 at 30 months and 2.6 at 8 years. Complete recanalization was observed in 7 patients and partial racanalization was observed in 6 patients in 8 years. While the occlusion rate was 94.1% at the 30th month, this rate was 91.7% at 8th year.\n\nConclusion: The use of N-butyl cyanoacrylate in the treatment of patients with varicose veins is quite satisfactory with its high ablation rate in term of long-term results.\n\nKeywords: superficial venous insufficiency, N-butyl cyanoacrilate, treatment\n\nRobot-Assisted Autovenous Bypass Surgery In Nutckracker Syndrome\n\nR.A. Vinogradov1, A.B. Zakeriaev1, S.R. Butaev1, P.V. Sukhoruchkin1, G.A Palaguta1, G.A. Khangereev1, T.E. Bakhishev1, E.R. Vinogradova1, V.L. Medvedev1, A.G. Baryshev1, V.A. Porkhanov1\n\n1Research Institute – Regional Clinical Hospital No. 1 named after Professor S.V.Ochapovsky\n\nBackground: Nutcracker syndrome (NCS) occurs as a result of compression of the left renal vein by the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery. For many years, surgical treatment of this syndrome has been carried out by switching blood flow from the left renal vein to the inferior vena cava or iliac vein by open or laparoscopic interventions. Endovascular technologies are also used, but their effectiveness and prospects are still controversial.\n\nMethods: In 2022 in the Department of Vascular Surgery of Krasnodar Regional Hospital, a technique of treating NCS using a Da Vinci Xi® robot was developed and implemented. Before the robotic stage, VSM ex situ explantation and preparation is performed. The robotic stage includes the isolation of the left renal vein, the isolation of the common iliac vein, the imposition of temporary clips on them (Figure 1). Further, holes corresponding to the diameter of the prepared VSM shunt are formed in the LRV and VIC. The VSM is delivered through the port into the abdominal cavity. The location of the VSM shunt with a preserved valve apparatus ensures unidirectional blood flow from the LRV to the VIC. Anastamoses LRV\\VSM and VIC\\VSM are performed using a Prolen 6\\0 (Ethicon) thread (Figure 2).\n\nResults: In 2022, two operations were performed using Da Vinci Xi® robot technology. The total operation time is 141±22 min. The time of temporary compression of the left renal vein is 20±4.5 minutes. The total time of robotic application of proximal and distal anastomosis is 30±8.5 minutes. The intraoperative blood loss did not exceed 50 ml. The postoperative period proceeded without peculiarities and complications. CT phlebography and selective venous shunt phlebography were performed to control the unidirectional patency of the structure. We can talk about a decrease in venous hypertension in the LRV basing on a decrease in its diameter by 20-30% 3-4 days after surgery.\n\nConclusion: LRV-VIC bypass surgery of the autovenous VSM using the Da Vinci Xi® robot is a highly effective surgical intervention for NCS. The creation of unidirectional autovenous flow through the shunt between the LRV and the VIC reduces hypertension in the LRV. Nevertheless, the venous outflow from the LRV into the pool of the inferior vena cava significantly increases, bypassing the area of stenosis. The diameter of the LRV decreases and clinical manifestations are reduced. Additional experience and long term observations are needed to assess the effectiveness of this operation in its new technological performance. The robotic bypass surgery is the method of choice for the NCS treatment, characterised by a low complication rate and optimistic early postoperative results.\n\nKeywords: Nutcracker syndrome, Robot-assisted bypass surgery, Left renal vein\n\nCOVID-19 ASSOCIATED THROMBOSES\n\nNurbek Karazhanov1, Azamat Abdullinov1, Edil Aitzhanov1\n\n1Astana Medical University\n\nBackground: COVID-19 is a disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Most of the sick patients develop symptoms of a respiratory infection and in some cases proceed with complications. The main types of venous thrombotic complications have been identified: acute deep vein thrombosis (ADVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), superficial vein thrombophlebitis (SVTP), the frequency of which is considered in this article\n\nMethods: The data of the case histories of 272 patients with objectively confirmed COVID-19 who received inpatient treatment in the department of vascular surgery of the Multidisciplinary City Hospital No. 1 in Nur-Sultan in the period from July 8 to September 27, 2021, as well as searched the PubMed, SPRINGER, ELSEVIER, EMBASE and Web of Science databases from July to September 2021 for relevant studies using the keywords (“COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”) and (“ thrombosis”). Also, relevant articles were selected in references to selected studies reporting the prevalence of thrombotic complications in patients with confirmed COVID-19.\n\nResults: almost 18% (52) of patients who received inpatient treatment in the vascular surgery department of the Multidisciplinary City Hospital # 1, Nur-Sultan, in the period from July to September 2021, signs of a WTO were detected, confirmed during an objective examination, laboratory and / or instrumental methods of research. The proportion of deaths due to WTO was 38.46% (20). - TELA.\n\nConclusion: The results of this study indicate that lethality in coronovirus infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a high incidence of arterial and venous thrombosis due to a cascade of hemorheological disorders associated with damage to the vascular endothelium and an excess of blood clotting factors. These circumstances prompt researchers to focus on early prevention and clinical treatment of thrombotic complications in patients with confirmed COVID-19, through active anticoagulant therapy in the complex treatment of coronovirus infection.\n\nKeywords: COVID19, thrombosis, TELA, deep vein thrombosis\n\nN-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate glue ablation for the treatment of small saphenous vein insufficiency: Good enough for being first choice?\n\nOrhan Eren Gunertem1, Ali Baran Budak2\n\n1Ankara Medicalpark Batıkent Hospital\n\n2Istanbul Ulus Liv Hospital\n\nBackground: Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) of the lower limbs is a common disorder and small saphenous vein (SSV) reflux is responsible for nearly 15% of all varicose vein disease. SSV insufficiency may be clinically as severe as GSV insufficieny. In literature, there are seldom reports about postprocedural outcomes of this innovative nonthermal technique. We aim to present our mid-term results of n-butyl-2 cyanoacrylate-based nontumescent endovenous ablation for the treatment of patients with SSV insufficiency.\n\nMethods: 52 patients with small saphenous vein insufficiency were treated during past two years in our clinic. Patients aged 22-67 years old with symptomatic small saphenous vein reflux lasting longer than 0.5 s with vein diameter > 5.5 mm assessed in the standing position were enrolled in the study. Duplex ultrasound imaging and clinical follow-up were performed on the first month, sixth month and twelfth month. Aberdeen varicose vein questionnaire scores and Venous clinical severity score were recorded.\n\nResults: Of 52 enrolled patients, 48 were available at first month and sixth monts follow-up. Complete occlusion of the treated small saphenous vein was confirmed by duplex ultrasound in all patients. Moreover, 44 of them were also evaluated at twelfth month. Two partial recanalizations observed at 12th month of follow-up, respectively. Complete occlusion rate was 91.6% at 12 months. Symptoms, Aberdeen varicose vein questionnaire scores and Venous clinical severity score quality of life improved in patients at 12th month. No clinically significant procedure-related late adverse events occurred.\n\nConclusion: The risk of neurological damage is a clinically important during surgical treatment and thermal ablation techniques for treatment of SSV insufficiency . Although there are not sufficient evidence for nonthermal techniques such as novel n-butyl-2 cyanoacrylate-based ablation in the treatment of SSV insufficiency, we think that this procedure seems to be feasible, safe, and efficient in treating the great majority of incompetent small saphenous vein. We also believe that this technique may be the first choice in the coming years.\n\nKeywords: small saphenous vein insufficiency, nonthermal ablation techniques, N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate\n\nFirst Latin American Consensus of Venous Mapping of Superficial and Perforating Veins: The process of reaching a consensus\n\nOscar Bottini1, Fanny Rodriguez Santos2, Chantal Aguero Wagner3, Lorena Grillo4, Mariuxi Morales8, Franco Arias5, Alejandro Boroda5, Daniela Calcina6, Fabricio Santiago7\n\n1Hospital Aleman, Argentina.

Uiversidade Federal de Goias, Brasil\n\n8Hospital Luis Vernaza, Ecuador\n\nBackground: Duplex ultrasound (DUS) is widely used to investigate Chronic Venous Disease (CVD). In recent years, there has been a better understanding of DUS imaging of superficial and perforating veins and how they relate to venous disease. Previous consensus have been made on Nomenclature, Anatomy and Techniques to perform a Venous DUS. In addition to the relevance of correctly performing and reporting a DUS, a supplementary tool is needed in order to facilitate the study execution and interpretation. This tool is the Venous Mapping (VM), a cartography composed of strokes, colors and geometric shapes that provides information on the characteristics of the venous system and allows sharing the same criteria, improving communication, unifying reports and standardizing venous treatment. The primary objective of this study is to reach a consensus on the use of a cartography called Superficial and Perforating Venous Mapping as a diagnostic tool that complements the descriptive report of the Venous DUS.\n\nMethods: A 3-phase modified Delphi method was carried out consisting of 2 sequential rounds of anonymous web-based questionnaires (phases I and II), and three consensus meetings: two virtual and one in-person (phase III). Latin American Societies of Phlebology and Vascular Surgery were invited and asked to assign Experts on their behalf. Finally, qualitative questions were analyzed narratively and quantitative questions were individually rated from 1 to 5 according to the Likert Scale. Consensus was determined when at least 70% of the experts had cast a vote, with 75% of positive responses on the Likert Scale (score 4 or 5).\n\nResults: 54 experts from 34 Latin American Societies of Phlebology and Vascular Surgery were consulted. Both questionnaires obtained 100% responses from the experts and consensus was achieved with minor revisions in the first round and unanimously in the second.\n\nConclusion: The modified Delphi method allowed an organized process to be carried out with a broad participation of experts from all over Latin America. Consensus on the use of Venous Mapping of Superficial and Perforating Veins was reached with 100% acceptance.\n\nKeywords: venous disease, venous mapping, dupplex ultrasound, consensus\n\nDoes the duration of systemic anticoagulation affect the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with superficial venous thrombosis? A systematic review and meta-analysis\n\nKirill Lobastov1, Ilya Schastlivtsev1, Astanda Bargandzhiya1, Leonid Laberko1\n\n1Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University\n\nBackground: Patients with superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Systemic anticoagulation therapy (ACT) was suggested as standard treatment by the current guidelines. However, the optimal duration of anticoagulation still is unknown. This study aimed to determine the association between the duration of ACT and the risk of further VTE in patients with SVT.\n\nMethods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed using searches Medline and Cochrane Library databases in September 2021 according to the previously developed protocol (CRD42021271486). Papers that provided VTE incidence within mid-term follow-up of ≥ 45 days in patients who received any systemic anticoagulation were included. Patients were categorized into subgroups according to the course of treatment: (1) no ACT (0 days), (2) ACT of ≤ 14 days, (3) ACT of 15–30 days, (4) ACT of 31–45 days, and (5) ACT of ≥ 45 days. Reported events were transformed to events per 100 patient-years, and a random-effects model was used to calculate pooled rates for proportions. The primary outcome (VTE) was a combination of SVT progression or recurrence and/or the occurrence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).\n\nResults: Twenty-one studies (ten randomized clinical trials and 11 cohort studies) of 12,272 patients were included in the quantitative synthesis. Minimum rates of VTE and SVT recurrence or progression were observed with the ACT duration of 31–45 days were 16.2 and 9.1 events per 100 patient-years, respectively. Minimum rates of DVT and PE that were observed with the treatment duration of 15–30 days were 6.0 and 0.9 events per 100 patient-years, respectively. Short-term treatment of ≤ 14 days was associated with the highest VTE rates even when compared with no ACT. The most common risk factors for VTE included male sex, malignancy, personal history of DVT, PE, or SVT, and thrombosis of non-varicose veins.\n\nConclusion: Prolonged systemic anticoagulation is associated with the tendency to cause a decrease in VTE rates in patients with lower limb SVT.\n\nKeywords: venous thromboembolism, superficial venous thrombosis, anticoagulation\n\nSurgical treatment of acute and chronic superficial varicothrombophlebitis on an outpatient basis\n\nLavrov R.N., Sukhorukov A.M., Maltseva M.G., Bogdashkin I.A.1\n\n1Department of Surgery with the course of urology, oncology, orthopedics and traumatology KhSU named after N.F. Katanov, Abakan, Republic of Khakassia, Russia LLC \" Doctor Lavrov's Clinic \" Krasnoyarsk, Krasnoyarsk Territory, Russia\n\nBackground: The tasks of modern medicine are the introduction of new minimally invasive technologies for the treatment of acute and chronic superficial varicothrombophlebitis of the lower extremities on an outpatient basis. This allows to quickly and efficiently formulate a clinical diagnosis, provide medical care in full and significantly reduce the cost of treating patients.\n\nMethods: From 2018 to 2021, 31 (n=31) patients with CEAP 4 VVLE complicated by superficial varicothrombophlebitis of the tributaries were treated at the Surgical Clinic \" Doctor Lavrov's Clinic \", Krasnoyarsk, Russia. To relieve hypertension in the saphenous veins system, the latter were coagulated with a BIOLITEC semiconductor laser: Ceralas E, by introducing a laser fiber into the saphenous veins through a conductor, with a wavelength of 1470 Nm and a power of 8 to 15 W. Laser treatment was performed under tuminiscent infiltration anesthesia, Klein's solution, using a NOUVAG DP30 pump. All patients (n=31) underwent thrombectomy from varicose-transformed tributaries. All patients (n=31) underwent ultrasound of the veins of the lower extremities, local control of the area of surgical intervention after thromboexcision was performed on days 1-3-14 after surgical treatment. The severity of the pain syndrome was assessed on the VAS scale on days 1-3-14.\n\nResults: After the combined surgical treatment of VVLE complicated by varicothrombophlebitis of the tributaries, according to duplex scanning on the 1st day of the postoperative period, all patients had thermal obliteration of the saphenous veins at the stage of occlusion. In the course of further follow-up, on the 3rd day of the postoperative period, thermal occlusion of the saphenous veins persisted in all patients. At the same time, the pain syndrome on the VAS scale decreased to 1 point (discomfort). On the 14th day of observation, thermal occlusion of the saphenous veins persisted in all patients. In the area of thrombexcision, the inflammatory infiltrate stopped, no hyperemia of the skin was observed. At the same time, the pain syndrome on the VAS scale was 0 points. As a result of the combined treatment of varicose disease CEAP 4,there is a rapid relief of signs of perivasal inflammation, periphlebitis, as well as a decrease in pain according to the VAS pain scale. Patients of this group satisfactorily tolerated this type of combined treatment with EVLA and thrombexcision.\n\nConclusion: Combined treatment of varicose disease CEAP 4, complicated by varicothrombophlebitis of the tributaries, with the use of EVLA technology and thromboexcision in outpatient practice significantly improves the quality of life of patients and excludes the hospital stage of the patient's stay in the hospital.\n\nKeywords: Combined treatment of varicose disease, varicothrombophlebitis, thromboexcision\n\nProphylactic antibiotics for combined endovenous ablation and phlebectomy, necessary or not?; A propensity score matching case-control study\n\nKilsoo Yie1, A-Rom Shin1, Eun Hee Jeong1\n\n1Jeju Soo CardioVascular Center (JSCVC), Republic of Korea\n\nBackground: Current guidelines recommend that prophylactic antibiotics should not use in endovenous surgery. However, it remains unclear whether prophylactic antibiotics are necessary for the combined endovenous procedure with concomitant phlebectomy.\n\nMethods: We conducted a propensity score matching case-control study for post-procedural infection rates based on the use or non-use of prophylactic antibiotics. Initially, the study included 587 patients (mean age of 55.8 ±14.2 and 296 (50.4%) female gender) undergoing combined endovenous surgery with concomitant phlebectomy from 2018 to 2022. All procedures were performed under local anesthesia without any level of sedation. The primary outcome was to compare the incidence of surgical site wound infection (SSWI) after the combined procedure between prophylactic antibiotic use (PA group) and the non-use group (nPA group). The secondary outcomes were to analyze the all-cause of antibiotic requirements as of post-operative three months and determine the incidence of thrombophlebitis that needed antibiotic treatment. After propensity score matching, 201 patients who received prophylactic antibiotics (PA group) and 201 who did not (nPA group) were selected, and the present study analyzed 402 study populations.\n\nResults: The mean number of concomitant phlebectomy was 3.54±2.3 in the nPA group and 3.68±2.40 in the PA group (p=ns). Types of endovenous treatment (p=0.794 for VenaSeal, p=0.421 for radiofrequency ablation, p=0.523 for endovenous laser ablation, and p=0.376 for ultrasonographic foam sclerotherapy) and the numbers of phlebectomy (3.61±2.3 in no SSWI group vs. 4.40±5.0 in SSWI group) was not associated with postoperative SSWI incidence. In the logistic regression test, the preoperative great saphenous vein size was a unique risk factor for postoperative SSWI (Odd Ratio 1.442, 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.80, p=0.004)\n\nConclusion: Both nPA and PA strategy has a very low and comparable incidence of SSWI after combined endovenous and concomitant phlebectomy for chronic venous disease treatment. nPA strategy did not increase post-procedural surgical site wound infection. We need an optimized and individualized protocol for the use of antibiotics appropriate for each of our environments.\n\nKeywords: Prophylactic, antibiotics\n\nRadiofrequency Ablation Associated with Foam Sclerotherapy for Varicosities In One-step Approach: A Prospective Cohort Study Comprising Large Diameters Saphenous Veins\n\nDouglas Poschinger-Figueiredo1, Cristiane Ferreira de Araujo Gomes1, Leonardo Silveira de Castro1, Eduardo de Oliveira Rodrigues Neto1, Yanna Cristhina Moreira Thomaz1, Eric Paiva Vilela1, Lívia Ramos Carvalho Marchon1, Carlos Eduardo Virgini-Magalhães1\n\n1Rio de Janeiro State University\n\nBackground: Both Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) and ultrasound guided foam sclerotherapy (USGFS) have been described as safe and successful treatment options for varicose vein treatment. However, there are limited data on the efficacy and safety of these two procedures combined, especially in patients with large great saphenous vein (GSV) diameters. This study assessed the outcomes and impact on the quality-of-life following one-step outpatient treatment with RFA for large GSV reflux associated to USGFS for the associated varicose veins.\n\nMethods: This was a retrospective, single-centre, analytical cohort, with ethical committee approval, conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Thirty symptomatic patients having reflux in the GSV and varicosities (CEAP C3 to C6) were treated with RFA and USGFS simultaneously, in a single-step procedure, from March 2016 to December 2016. They were followed up at 1 week, 6 months, 1 and 3 years. Clinical outcomes, changes in the Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaires SF-36, visual analog scale (VAS), VCSS and AVVQ, evolutive vein occlusion rates were assessed by duplex ultrasound, and ulcer closure was checked.\n\nResults: The sample was divided into two groups: Group 1 - GSV diameter ≥ 13.0 mm (median 19.0 [14–24]), with 17 subjects, and Group 2 - GSV diameter ≤ 12.9 mm (median 10.3 [10–12]), with 16 subjects. No major adverse event was observed, and the postoperative minor adverse event rates were similar between the two groups. A significant improvement was observed in VCSS and AVVQ from the preoperative levels to the sixth month and the third-year follow-up for both groups. Twelve of 13 ulcers had healed at 1 year and remained closed until 3 years. The entire sample had a significant increase in all short form 36 domains, except for mental health in the Group 2 (GSV ≥ 13.0 mm). The overall first week occlusion rate for the whole sample was 90.9% and 69.7% at the 3-year follow-up. No difference in the occlusion rate was observed between the two groups at any time.\n\nConclusion: In this study, the outpatient combined technique was safe and feasible in this population with no major adverse events, despite the large diameters of GSV and a considerable proportion of leg ulcers. Within the third year, the total sample and both saphenous vein diameter range subgroups showed equivalent improvement in VAS, VCSS, and AVVQ quality of life questionnaires, satisfactory axial occlusion, and maintained ulcer closure.\n\nKeywords: Saphenous Vein, Varicose Veins, Varicose Ulcer, Catheter Ablation, Ultrasound Guided Foam Sclerotherapy\n\nPatient Satisfaction Following Phlebectomy for Prominent Temporal, Periorbital and Facial Veins\n\nSimon D Muschamp1, Amanda G Nielsen1, Mark S Whiteley1\n\n1The Whiteley Clinic, Surrey Research Park, 1 Stirling House, Stirling Road, Guildford GU2 7RF UK\n\nBackground: Aesthetic phlebology is becoming an increasingly popular area of interest in the venous world. Most facial veins can be treated by transcutaneous laser, targeting the blood within the vein. However, a small proportion of prominent facial veins are too large for this non-invasive treatment. Since 2015, we have performed facial phlebectomy under local anaesthetic for these veins (Figure 1). The aim of this study is to report the patient satisfaction in the small cohort of patients we have treated to date.\n\nMethods: A retrospective review was made from the operating records to identify those patients undergoing facial phlebectomy in our institution. Patients were identified and then contacted by e-mail and, where necessary, by telephone. Patients were asked whether subjectively they thought the treatment had worked. Then using a five-point scale, they were asked to rate: the disappearance of the veins, their scars, their feeling about their treatment overall, and finally, whether they would recommend this treatment to friends and family.\n\nResults: 22 patients were contacted, and 13 replied (response rate 59%). Unfortunately, one of the e-mails was corrupted, and only 12 were available for analysis. Of these 12 patients, 10 were female and two male. The mean age was 45.4 years (range 28-64). The veins treated were 8 temporal veins, 14 periorbital veins, one vein on the cheek and one vein on the upper eyelid. The subjective comments range from \"my facial vein was fully removed with no pain or scarring\" to \"the treatment has not been that effective\". The results of the five-point grading system are tabulated in Table 1.\n\nRight facial phlebectomy\n\nBefore and after right facial phlebectomy\n\nConclusion: There have been an increasing number of meetings dedicated to aesthetic phlebology over the last few years, reflecting a growing interest in patients seeking aesthetic phlebology treatments and doctors starting to provide them. One of the main areas of aesthetic phlebology is the treatment of facial veins. Although traditionally this has been thought of as the treatment of thread veins around the nose and on the cheeks, as well as smaller green veins around the eyes and temples, larger veins have often been passed over as \"untreatable\". This study has shown that in a small group of patients selected as potentially treatable, phlebectomy under local anaesthetic can result in high patient satisfaction. However, even though most results are very good, the occasional poor result or unhappy patient mandates careful consenting as this is a cosmetic rather than medical procedure.\n\nKeywords: facial veins, aesthetic phlebology, phlebectomy, temporal, periorbital\n\nRisk factors for venous thrombosis in patients with endoprosthetics of hip joints\n\nSviatoslav Kostiv1, Ihor Venher1\n\n1Ternopil National Medical University\n\nBackground: Important part of orthopedic surgery is endoprosthetics of hip joints, which eliminates pain syndrome, restores the amplitude of movements and the support ability of the lower limb. But there is a number of complications; venous thromboembolism among them occupies a leading place.\n\nMethods: 219 patients with a mean age of 64.7 ± 3.8 years were operated. In 137 (62.1%) observations, total cement hip replacement for osteoarthritis was performed. 82 (37.4%) patients received total and unipolar cement hip replacement for cervical femoral neck fractures. Operative intervention was carried out under subdural anesthesia with the use of bupivacaine.Clinical manifestations of non-specific connective tissue dysplasia were detected in 83 (37.9%) patients, which were confirmed by the laboratory determination of the level of general, bound and free oxyproline.Monitoring of the thrombotic process in the venous system of the inferior vena cava was performed by duplex ultrasound scans of the vessels of the lower extremities by Sonoscape S8exp with a frequency of 5-12 MHz and 2.5-4 MHz from the first day of the postoperative period.\n\nResults: In the postoperative period, the thrombotic process in the venous system of IVC was diagnosed in 23 (10.5%) observations. Operative intervention on the hip joint in patients with NCTD in 11 (13.3%) cases was complicated by the development of venous thrombosis. In patients without NCTD, postoperative thrombosis in the venous system of IVC was diagnosed in 12 (8.8%) observations. In 21 patients, postoperative thrombosis was detected in the deep venous system of IVC and only in two observations in the superficial venous system. At the shear wave expansion speed of 2.5 - 2.6 m/s – there is a high risk of embologenity of the thromb, at the shear wave expansion speed of 2.7 - 2.9 m/s – there is a moderate risk of embologenity of the thromb, at the shear wave expansion speed of 3.0 m/s and more there is no threat of embolism.\n\nThromboelastography of thrombosis of the right popliteal vein\n\nThrombooelastography of the thrombosis of the right common femoral vein\n\nConclusion: Patients with osteoarthrosis of the hip joint and the femoral neck fracture accompanied by the non-specific dysplasia of the connective tissue are characterized by expressed levels of endothelial dysfunction and increased activity of the blood-coagulation system.\n\nKeywords: VTE, dysplasia, thrombi elastography\n\nThe treatment of hemorrhoids using sclerosing foam prepared with Medical Device: endoscopic versus anoscopic tecnique what is better?\n\nEdoardo Cervi1, Andrea Morri3, Giovanni Alongi2, Marika Delai1\n\n1University of Brescia\n\n2Angiocor, Messina/Palermo/Agrigento\n\n3Luganocare Medical Center\n\nBackground: Suffering from hemorrhoids is a common pathology in countries with a high standard of living. The endoscleromousse procedure of symptomatic hemorrhoids is very effective, painless and without complications.In this report we have analysed the results of the outpatient treatment of hemorroids using flexible endoscopy or anoscopy injection of sclerosing foam prepared with medical device\n\nMethods: We have treated 100 patients with variable degree ( from I to IV degree) of hemorroidal disease and proctorrhagia from August 2021 to March 2022 using Medical Device to standardize the foam.Endoscopic examination was carried out using a dedicated flexible endoscopic video with a diameter of 10 mm, only in particular cases we have used sedation. For the anoscopic procedure we didn’t use sedation Each treatment was executed cranially to the pectinate line, where the sensitive innervation is absent.The foam of Lauromacrogol 2% or 3% has been prepared with medical device, a machine that allows to obtain a standardized sclerosing foam.The quantity of injected medication per individual hemorroidal mass was never higher than 2 cc, with a maximum of 6 cc during each session.Each session has an average duration of 8 minutes (range 6-12 minutes) with endoscopic tecnique, 4 minutes with anoscopic tecnique At the end of the procedure patients returned to their usual daily activity.\n\nResults: We had organised a follow-up of three months, with controls and eventually repetition of procedures in the case of persistence of symptoms or incomplete sclerosis. Each procedure was carried on every 20 days, without complications.We carried out a total of 250 treatments on 100 patients.At the end of the follow-up all the patients had improved quality of life, with resolution of bleeding and of anemia.\n\nConclusion: We prefer use flexible endoscopic tecnique for the hemorrhoids of III or IV degree For the I and II degree use the anoscopy tecnique In case of hemorrhage urgency we use anoscopic or endoscopic tecnique depends on the degree or amount of bleeding\n\nKeywords: Sclerotherapy, Hemorrhoids, Sclerosing foam\n\nTotally Online Initiation of Comprehensive Decongestive Therapy (CDT) for Lymphedema\n\nArun Rekha Gogia1, Shashi Bhushan Gogia2\n\n1Society For Administration of telemedicine and Healthcare Informatics\n\n2Sanwari Bai Surgical Centre\n\nBackground: Lymphedema is estimated to effect between 100 – 300 million people worldwide, India has a higher proportion due to tropical problems like Filariasis and Podoconiosis over and above general causes like cancer, venous disease trauma, old age, obesity etc. Not only do the patients get a disfiguring swelling but they also get repeated infections in the limb called Adeno-Dermato-Lymphangitis Attacks (ADLA). These are mostly gram positive in origin and best managed through Penicillin. CDT (Comprehensive Decongestive Therapy) is considered the worldwide gold standard for management of Lymphoedema. CDT is labor intensive requiring physical interaction with a trained therapist who are expensive as well as hard to find. This is yet to become commonplace in India. It consists of two parts, Initiation Phase done in the hospital, and Maintenance phase, at home. MLD or Manual Lymphatic Drainage is a major component of Initiation phase, but lately its relevance has been discounted. We have been managing Lymphedema - largely without MLD at our clinic since 25 years, giving good outcomes. Training on self bandaging has been a major component of our processes. Recently due to COVID some patients from far, could not reach us for care initiation. So we decided to provide counselling and training totally online. A case report is presented.\n\nMethods: We get lymphedema patients come from across India. After diagnosis, we initiate CDT on an ambulatory basis along with long term Penicillin, counselling, training and motivation to continue self care at home. The duration of initiation phase has of late reduced great from the initial 7-10 days, as patients and care givers are taught how to self bandage. Patients are encouraged to make videos for later recall. An Electronic Medical Record system which has a special module for Lymphedema is used for care documentation. Penicillin was prescribed and patient sent appropriate bandage sets. Online training provided not only of self tying of bandage but also how to take measurements.\n\ntraining collage\n\nOnline training underway through Zoom platform\n\nResults: A total of 10 Video-Conferencing (VC) sessions were held over 2 weeks with the first two devoted to patient examination and taking measurements. The volume difference from the normal side reduced from 53% to 39% initially, later she became lax and got an ADLA attack after another 2 weeks, Penicillin had not been taken. the same was started and another counselling session done. After another two months the limb was stable at 35% volume difference from original.\n\nLimb circuferenence over time\n\nTable showing results with calculated volumes marked out\n\nConclusion: Totally online CDT provision saves hugely in costs of travel and stay away from home. The occurrence of ADLA showed that patients may not follow online instructions strictly.\n\nKeywords: Lymphedema, Tele-counselling, Complex Decongestive Therapy, Selfcare, Online training\n\nLong-term practical experience with canoacrylate\n\nNajib Jawadi Horst Peter Steffen1, Najib Jawadi1\n\n1Zentrum für Gefäßmedizin Düsseldorf\n\nBackground: The minimally invasive therapy of varicosis is increasingly finding its way into the clinical routine of vascular therapists. The apparent simplicity of the procedure also tempts doctors of other specialties to carry out endovenous therapies. While there is now manageable data on thermal-endovenous procedures, treatment with cyanoacrylate is largely unknown. A long-term practical experience with cyanoacrylate has therefore rarely been published so far.\n\nMethods: Between January 2014 and January 2022, a total of 687 patients were treated with the cyanoacrylate method (VenaSeal procedure) at the Center for Vascular Medicine Düsseldorf in Germany. During the same period, 1762 veins were treated by thermal methods such as radiofrequency or laser and respectively in 1380 by conventional open crossectomy and stripping. We tracked and followed up on our patients retrospectively in a follow-up of up to 36 months in terms of success rate and complications.\n\nResults: It was often treated single vein 87%, namely more SSV than GSV. Patients have always had Chronic venos diseas St. II and III (CEAP C2-C6). 63 x allergic reactions (9.1%), 35 x phlebitides (5%), 3 foreign body granulomas and a pulmonary artery embolism have been documented.The primary closure was 100%. Partial recentalisation (2.5%) was documented in 17 patients and complete recanalisation (0.3%) in a further 2 patients. After 12 months, 26 partial sewerage systems (3.8%) and 3 complete re-sewers (0.44%) were detected in total. The closure rate after 36 months was 95.7%.\n\nConclusion: In summary, the VenaSeal procedure of the trunk vein can represent a real alternative to conventional therapy and thermal procedures due to the very good results in our collective as well as in the comparative studies. This method can be trusted more in order to be able to generate even more experience and even more data. However, the practitioner should always choose the best possible form of therapy for his patients.The location of the target vein plays an important role here. Most of the re-sewerage systems were carried out in the GSV observed. Taking this fact into account, I believe that conventional therapy and thermal therapy should be avoided in the treatment of SSV.\n\nKeywords: Cyanoacrylate, VenaSeal, Varicosis, Endovenos Therapy\n\nPostCyanoacrylate Allergic Reaction(PoCAR) after cyanoacrylate closure operation for varicose vein\n\nJinwon Jeon1\n\n1Cheong-mac hospital\n\nBackground: Background : Cyanoacrylate closure(CAC), one of nonthermal and nontumescent, has been introduced. Sine 2017 CAC, commercial name is VenaSeal, has been widely used for varicose vein treatment in South Korea. It has many advantages – short operation time, easy to use, little postoperative pain, no compression stocking apply, etc. But it has also disadvantages – especially in postoperative allergic reaction. This study aimed to anlayze postoperative allergic reaction.\n\nMethods: Previously it has been called Phlebitis-Like Abnormal Reaction(PLAR). But actually all PLARs are not phlebitis but delayed allergic reaction. So we call it PostCyanoacrylate Allergic Reaction(PoCAR) to included every case of CAC induced allergic reaction. PoCAR is graded as location and duration time. The location was divided local and systemic.(recorded 1 and 2) The duration time was divided < 1 month, < 6 months, > 6 months.(recorded A, B, C)\n\nResults: A total 862 patients, 2564 incompetent GSV & SSV were treated with CAC procedure. There were 577 patients of PoCAR.(66.9%) The location was 1 and 2.(92.8% and 7.2%) The duration time was A, B, C(87.6%, 11.8%, 0.6%). PoCAR were 1A, 1B, 1C(87.3%, 5.2%, 0.3%). PoCAR were 2A, 2B, 2C(0.3%, 6.6%, 0.3%). Usually PoCAR is improved with short period anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory agents. But in some cases it is terribly severe and long lasting. We report 2 severe long lasting PoCAR(2C) cases, eventually had operation to remove it\n\nConclusion: One of the most frequent postoperative complication of CAC is PostCyanoacrylate Allergic Reaction(PoCAR). Protect and reduce the possibility of PoCAR, thorough history taking of allergic reaction and meticulous operation skill are essential. Unfortunately if PoCAR grade 2C occurs, early decision of removal operation and meticulous technique are essential to resolve this problem and improve patient’s quality of life.\n\nKeywords: PLAR, allergy, venaseal, cyanoacrylate, NTNT\n\nThe effectiveness of endovenous laser obliteration in the treatment of superficial venous malformations of the upper and lower extremities\n\nFARKHAD UMAROV1\n\n1Republican Specialized Center for Surgery named after Academician V. Vakhidov, Tashkent, Uzbekistan\n\nBackground: The effectiveness of endovenous laser obliteration in the treatment of superficial venous malformations of the upper and lower extremities.Bakhritdinov F.Sh., Suyumov A.S., Umarov F.R., Dosmukhamedova L.V.Republican Specialized Scientific and Practical Medical Surgery Center named after Academician V.Vakhidov, Tashkent, Uzbekistan [email protected] significance of the problem of treating superficial venous malformations is determined by the real danger of developing serious complications: thrombosis of the pathological venous bed, bleeding, progression of chronic venous insufficiency and the development of trophic ulcers. Venous malformations are characterized by significant functional and anatomical disorders, cosmetic defects, progressive course, which together can lead to disability and disability at a young age.\n\nMethods: For the study, the data of 102 patients with superficial low-velocity venous malformations aged 7 to 58 years for the period 2015 to 2022 were analyzed. In addition to general clinical examination of patients to exclude high-speed arteriovenous and lymphatic malformations, we used the following diagnostic methods: complex ultrasound examination of blood vessels, overview radiography of soft tissues and bones; tomographic research methods, including computed tomography with dynamic contrast enhancement of the image and magnetic resonance angiography, as well as arteriography and phlebography.Surgical treatment was performed in 98 patients. Traditional methods of surgical treatment in the form of excision and resection of abnormal veins on the arms and legs under general or spinal anesthesia were performed in 39 patients. In 15 patients, sclerobliteration of venous malformation was performed under ultrasound control. In 4 patients, we performed endovenous laser obliteration of stem venous malformations in combination with sclerobliteration and transdermal laser coagulation with a long-pulse neodymium laser.\n\nResults: Relapse and evolution of the disease in all groups amounted to 40-64%. However, in the group of patients who had traditional methods of treatment, there was a high percentage of surgical complications in the form of bleeding, suppuration of postoperative wounds, lymphorrhea, hematomas, neuropathy. Also, due to rough postoperative scars, significant deformation of the upper and lower extremities with disability was noted. The group of patients who underwent Endovenous laser obliteration of abnormal veins for 5 years had a recurrence of the disease in 46% of cases, but the above complications were not noted. All patients who had a relapse of the disease after EVLA underwent a course of sclerotherapy with a good effect, there was no disability.\n\nConclusion: In the treatment of superficial venous malformations, preference should be given to minimally invasive laser techniques due to the low traumatism, the absence of the need for hospitalization, the use of spinal and general anesthesia with fewer intraoperative complications and undesirable manifestations of treatment.\n\nKeywords: 555\n\nNeuropathy of venous source\n\nCUAUHTEMOC RAMIREZ2, ALICIA LUGO1, FERNANDO VEGA1\n\n1INSTITUTO MEXICANO DE FLEBOLOGIA Y LINFOLOGIA\n\n2ACADEMIA MEXICANA DE FLEBOLOGIA Y LINFOLOGIA\n\n3COLEGIO DE MEDICOS CIRUJANOS J.R. TOURNAY\n\nBackground: Neuropathy is a problem wich affects the quality of life of a large part of the population and is still a headache for health professionals by the diagnosis and it treatment. From 100% of cases, 60% are diagnosed as idiopathic and the remaining 40% are simply associated with diabetic neuropathy.In this work we intend to introduce a new concept on the origin of this pathology: neuropathy of venous source.A direct relationship has been found with alterations from the superficial venous system, even in apparently healthy veins with the clinical characteristic symptoms of small fiber neuropathy: (itching, changes in fine sensitivity, cramps, altered sensitivity to temperature, burning, pain, etc.).\n\nMethods: The origin of venous neuropathy may be the presence of unmyelinated nerve fibers in the venous wall, attract attention that these same symptoms are present in diabetic neuropathy, since these same type C unmyelinated nerve fibers are affected.\n\nResults: In our experience patients treated with sclerotherapy in pathological veins and apparently healthy veins which show the same clinical manifestations, the symptom improvement after sclerotherapy up to 100%. This situation has been observed not only in the lower limb but also in any part of the body, for example the upper limb, abdomen and chest.Regarding diabetic neuropathy, we observed a considerable improvement when treating the veins located at the site with symptoms, even if the veins did not have pathological characteristics.We have also observed an increase in sensitivity problems in the anterior third of the foot in the level of the toes, mainly the second, third and fourth, wich are related to the two most important intermetatarsals perforators, the, which are the most exposed to the gravitational effect of the blood pressure\n\nConclusion: It is important to emphasize the substantial importance of use of the transilluminator as a tool to be able to carry out the proper diagnosis and treatment.In conclusion, the discovery of the presence of type C nerve fibers founded in the venous wall, will allow us not only a more efficiently diagnose, but also, offering an effective treatment alternative for neuropathy, wich allows to improve the quality of life of patients\n\nKeywords: neuropathy, diabetic, type C, venous, transiluminator\n\nSHOULD ANTICOAGULANT DRUGS BE ADVISED IN EVERY FUTURE PANDEMIC GUIDELINE? OUR COVID-19 COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS\n\nVolkan Burak Taban1, Yüksel Dereli1, Celalettin Korkmaz2, Muhammet Talha Ceran1\n\n1Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Meram Medical Faculty, Necmettin Erbakan University, Konya, Turkey\n\n2Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Meram Medical Faculty, Necmettin Erbakan University, Konya, Turkey\n\nBackground: Covid-19 is a viral disease that has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.[1,2]. The most frequent complication has been reported to be sepsis[3]. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has been observed in majority of mortalities.[4,5].While “Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation” is widely used to describe sepsis associated coagulopathy, ISTH has recently started using “Sepsis Associated Coagulopathy” in its definition. SIC is actually considered the early stage of DIC, and research has found that anticoagulant treatment is effective in patients meeting SIC criteria.[6,7]. Anticoagulant treatment has been shown to be beneficial in patients who do not exhibit clinical DIC, but meet SIC criteria. (Figure 1). Contemporary guidelines recommend anticoagulant treatment.\n\nMethods: The patient groups, who were followed up with Covid-19 in Necmettin Erbakan University hospital, with and without anticoagulant treatment, will be analyzed retrospectively and comparative.\n\nResults: This study assessed the data of 2028 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and subsequently given (Group1 (n=1008)) or not given (Group2 (n=1020)) anticoagulant treatment. The demographic characteristics displayed on the table exhibited similarities; D-dimer, SOFA and SIC scores demonstrated significant changes. (Table 1).Patients who developed DVT, arterial embolism and pulmonary embolism were included in the “THROMBOSIS’’ study. While group 1 had a thrombosis development rate of 5.15% (n=52), this rate was 19.21% (n=196) in group2.“THROMBOSIS” patients in group1 and 2 demonstrated a mortality rate of 38.46%(n=20) and 65.5% (n=128), respectively (p<0.001).“THROMBOSIS” patients in group1 and 2 were divided into subgroups according to SIC scores and their mortality rates were analyzed with respect to SIC-DIC scores; significant results were observed (SIC>5 was accepted as DIC).Patients who receive anticoagulant treatment subsequent to COVID-19 diagnosis have reduced disposition to thrombosis. According to SIC-DIC scores obtained through SOFA scores and clinical parameters, patients who reach DIC levels (SIC>5) have an increased rate of mortality. (Table 2).However, in group 2 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and not given anticoagulant treatment due to no recommendation in prior guidelines, the mortality rate was high with every SIC score. Patients with a SIC score of 4 had a substantially high mortality rate; this is probably due to not receiving anticoagulants because DIC had not manifested.It was observed that compared to group 1, patients in group 2 who had not yet reached a DIC score, but had a SIC score of 4, had mortality rates reduced by 97% with anticoagulant treatment (p<0.001).\n\nAccording to SIC-DIC scores obtained through SOFA scores and clinical parameters, patients who reach DIC levels (SIC>5) have an increased rate of mortality (Tables 2 and 3).\n\nAccording to SIC-DIC scores obtained through SOFA scores and clinical parameters, patients who reach DIC levels (SIC>5) have an increased rate of mortality (Tables 2 and 3).\n\nConclusion: Through our findings, we wanted to describe when COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized should receive anticoagulant treatment. Patients should be monitored with respect to their SIC scores, and clinicians should consider anticoagulant administration as it can potentially decrease mortality rate, regardless of DIC development.\n\nKeywords: Covid-19, THROMBOSIS, Sepsis Associated Coagulopathy (SIC), International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH)\n\nEarly and Mid-Term Outcomes of Patients Treated with Catheter-directed Thrombolysis Combined with Percutaneous Rotational Mechanical Thrombectomy for Deep Vein Thrombosis\n\nCengiz Ovali1, Alper Selim Kocaoglu1\n\n1Eskisehir Osmangazi University Faculty of Medicine\n\nBackground: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is an important disease associated with serious mortality and morbidity. Although the first choice in the treatment of DVT is the medical approach, it has been started to use percutaneous interventional methods with the recent technological developments. This study aims to present the usability of this method and the results of 18-month Duplex ultrasound (DUP) and clinical follow-up in patients treated for DVT using a combination of mechanical thrombectomy and catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy.\n\nMethods: We performed mechanical thrombectomy and catheter-directed thrombolysis in patients who presented with the first diagnosis of acute and subacute DVT in the lower extremities. We placed a temporary inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in all patients before the procedure. Then, we applied mechanical thrombectomy and 24-hour tPa infusion with a catheter. Physical examination, DUP, and Villalta scoring were performed in the follow-ups at the 1st, 6th, 12th, and 18th months.\n\nResults: Of the 47 patients, 26 were male and 21 were female. The mean age was 59.9 years. In the one-month postoperative follow-up, the patency rates were 50% or higher in 43 patients. In 30 patients, the patency rate was 90% or above. During the procedure, respiratory distress and shortness of breath were observed in 2 patients, catheter-related complications were observed in 5 patients. Acute renal failure developed in 1 patient in the post-procedure period, but the patient did not require routine hemodialysis. One patient had gingival bleeding, and one had an intramuscular hematoma in the thigh region, no extravasation from the femoral vein was detected in the imaging. One patient had gastrointestinal system (GIS) bleeding, one had retroperitoneal bleeding, and one had alveolar bleeding. The patient with alveolar hemorrhage was in"
