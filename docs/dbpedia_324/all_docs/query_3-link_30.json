        "text": "July 2020 was among the three warmest months of July since record keeping began in 1880, NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, or NCEI, reported August 13. The month tied with July 2016 as the second-warmest on record, just 0.01 degrees Celsius behind the record set in July 2019 and just 0.01 degrees Celsius ahead of July 2017. NASA rated the month as the second-warmest July on record, and the Japan Meteorological Agency rated it as the fourth-warmest July on record.\n\nMinor differences in rankings often occur between various research groups, the result of the different techniques they use to handle data-sparse regions such as the Arctic.\n\nThe seven months of January through July was 1.05 degrees Celsius (1.89°F) above the 20th-century average, NCEI said. This ranks as the second-warmest such period on record, only 0.04 degrees Celsius (0.07°F) behind the record set in 2016. According to NCEI’s annual temperature outlook, the year 2020 has more than a 99.9% chance to rank among the five warmest years on record. If so, calendar years 2014 through 2020 would be the seven warmest years on record.\n\nThe outlook finds that 2020 has a 36.9% chance of displacing 2016 as the warmest year on record. These odds are based on statistical relationships rather than unfolding weather and climate events. With La Niña conditions now developing (see below), it will become more difficult for 2020 to break the 2016 record.\n\nGlobal temperature records are more likely to be set during the peak of the solar cycle and during strong El Niño events, given the extra heat from the tropical Pacific Ocean up to the atmosphere. The remarkable warmth of 2020 has come in the absence of a strong El Niño event and during the minimum of one of the weakest 11-year solar cycles in the past century, underscoring the dominant role of human-caused global warming in heating our planet.\n\nGlobal ocean temperatures during July 2020 were the third-warmest on record, and global land temperatures were also the third-warmest on record. Global satellite-measured temperatures in July 2020 for the lowest eight kilometers of the atmosphere were the third-warmest or second-warmest in the 42-year record, according to the University of Alabama Huntsville and Remote Sensing Systems, respectively.\n\nThree billion-dollar weather disasters in July 2020; 22 for the year\n\nThree billion-dollar weather-related disasters hit the Earth last month, according to the July 2020 Catastrophe Report from insurance broker Aon:\n\n– Torrential July downpours that inundated China’s Yangtze River Basin in July caused at least $15.7 billion in damage. The July flooding brings the total damage between June 1 and August 13 from China’s monsoon flooding to $26 billion, with 219 deaths. According to statistics from EM-DAT, the international disaster database, the $26 billion price tag of this year’s summer flooding in China would rank as the fourth most expensive non-U.S. weather disaster since accurate records began in 1990.\n\n– Heavy monsoon rains affected more than a dozen states in India throughout July. The hardest-hit states included West Bengal, Assam, Karnataka, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Gujrat, and Nagaland. Much of the damage happened along the Brahmaputra and Ganga Rivers and their tributaries. At least 742 people died in rain-related incidents, and 333 others died as a result of lightning strikes across 10,000 villages. The total death toll of 1,075 makes the India monsoon floods Earth’s deadliest weather disaster so far in 2020. Total economic losses were expected to exceed $1 billion.\n\n– Record-breaking rainfall triggered widespread flash flooding and landslides across southern Japan from July 3-10, killing at least 82 people and injuring 114. Flood damage was most severe on Kyushu Island. Total damage was estimated at $5 billion.\n\nThrough the end of July, Earth had 22 billion-dollar 2020 weather disasters, including 11 in the U.S., from severe storms. (The Australian wildfires span the boundary between 2019-2020 and may end up being classified as a 2019 disaster rather than a 2020 disaster).\n\nHere is the 2020 list of billion-dollar weather disasters through July, listed by dollars of damage, according to Aon:\n\n1. Flooding, China, Jun-Jul, $21.5 billion, 175 killed;\n\n2. Cyclone Amphan, India and Bangladesh, May 15-22, $13 billion, 118 killed;\n\n3. Flooding, Japan, Jul 3-10, $5 billion, 82 killed;\n\n4. Severe weather, Midwest, Plains, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic U.S., Apr 10-14, $3.45 billion, 38 killed;\n\n5. Severe weather, Midwest, Plains, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic U.S., Apr 6-9, $2.75 billion, zero killed;\n\n6. Windstorm Ciara, Western & Central Europe, Feb 9-10, $2.3 billion, 14 killed;\n\n7. Severe weather/Nashville tornado, Central and Eastern U.S., Mar 2-5, $2.4 billion, 25 killed;\n\n8. Severe weather, Central and Eastern U.S., Mar 27-30, $2.45 billion, zero killed;\n\n9. Wildfires and Heatwave, Australia, Nov-Jan, $2+ billion, 34 killed;\n\n10. Severe weather, Australia, Jan 18-20, $1.56 billion, zero killed;\n\n11. Severe weather, Central and Eastern U.S., Feb 3-8, $1. 5 billion, five killed;\n\n12. Severe weather, Plains, Southeast, and Midwest U.S., May 16-21, $1.5 billion, one killed;\n\n13. Severe weather, Rockies, Plains, and Midwest U.S., May 20-24, $1.3 billion, two killed;\n\n14. Severe weather, Texas, May 27-28, $1.3 billion, zero killed;\n\n15. Severe weather, Plains, Southeast, and Midwest U.S., May 4-5, $1.3 billion, zero killed;\n\n16. Severe weather, Central and Eastern U.S., Jan 10-12, $1.28 billion, 12 killed;\n\n17. Flooding, Iran, Feb 24–Apr 30, $1.2 billion, 23 killed;\n\n18. Severe weather, Plains, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic U.S., Apr 21-24, $1.55 billion, seven killed;\n\n19. Severe weather, Canada, Jun 13-14, $1.28 billion, zero killed; and\n\n20. Drought, northern and western China, Jan-Jul, $1.0 billion, zero killed.\n\n21. Flooding, India, Jun-Jul, $1.0 billion, 1075 killed\n\n22. Severe weather, Australia, Feb 2-11, $1.0 billion, zero killed\n\nA La Niña Watch continues\n\nNOAA issued the year’s first La Niña Watch in July, and its August 13 monthly discussion of the state of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, continued the La Niña Watch.\n\nOver the past month, sea surface temperatures in the benchmark Niño 3.4 region of the eastern tropical Pacific (5°N-5°S, 170°W-120°W) have dropped substantially. As of early August, they were hovering near to the 0.5 degrees Celsius below-average threshold for La Niña conditions.\n\nForecasters at NOAA and at Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society now favor La Niña conditions over the coming months. The odds of La Niña forming during the autumn have risen to around 60%, with a 55% chance of the event lasting through the winter.\n\nThe Tweet below by Steve Bowen of Aon shows U.S. landfalling hurricane activity by phase of ENSO:\n\nFor the August-September-October peak of the hurricane season, the odds of El Niño were put at just 1%, and the odds of a La Niña event at 57% (up from a 30% estimate issued three months ago). Atlantic hurricane seasons tend to be much more active during La Niña conditions than during El Niño conditions, because weaker upper-level winds create less wind shear. During La Niña events, the U.S. East Coast from Georgia to Maine experiences much higher landfall frequency than in ENSO-neutral years, according to a 2007 paper.\n\nArctic sea ice: lowest July extent on record\n\nArctic sea ice extent during July 2020 was the lowest in the 42-year satellite record, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. The record melting was due to an unusually intense area of high pressure that developed over the North Pole at the end of June, bringing clear skies and record melting of sea ice. By July 5, Arctic sea ice extent was the lowest on record for the date, and record low daily extents continued through the end of July. However, sea ice loss slowed down during the last week of July, when a large low-pressure system moved into the Arctic’s Beaufort Sea. Ice extent during the first week of August was the second-lowest on record, behind 2019.\n\nThe sea ice is particularly low along Russia’s Siberian coast, where the Northern Sea Route was open to ice-free navigation during the last half of July.\n\nIn the Canadian Arctic, the remarkable warmth of July contributed to the collapse of Canada’s last intact ice shelf, the Milne Ice Shelf, located on Ellesmere Island in the northern Canadian territory of Nunavut, according to the Canadian Ice Service. The collapse reduced the area of the Milne Ice Shelf by 43%, and created an “ice island” about 30 square miles in size—bigger than Manhattan Island (23 square miles).\n\nJuly heat was also pronounced over Greenland, where two significant melting events occurred in July.\n\nAntarctic sea ice extent in July 2020 was the ninth-lowest on record.\n\nNotable global heat and cold marks for July 2020\n\n– Hottest temperature in the Northern Hemisphere: 53.5°C (128.3°F) at Mehran, Iran, 27 July;\n\n– Coldest temperature in the Northern Hemisphere: -32.3°C (-26.1°F) at Summit, Greenland, July 31;\n\n– Hottest temperature in the Southern Hemisphere: 38.3°C (100.9°F) at Conceicao do Araguaia, Brazil, July 14;\n\n– Coldest temperature in the Southern Hemisphere: -78.3°C (-108.9°F) at Vostok, Antarctica, July 30;\n\n– Highest 2020 average temperature to date (Jan. 1-31 July) worldwide: 33.0°C (91.4°F) at Yelimane, Mali; and\n\n– Highest 2020 average temperature to date (Jan. 1-31 July) in the Southern Hemisphere: 29.8°C (85.6°F) at Surabaya Airport, Indonesia.\n\n(Courtesy of Maximiliano Herrera.)\n\nMajor weather stations’ new all-time heat or cold records in July 2020\n\nAmong global stations with a period of record of at least 40 years, 46 set (not just tied) a new all-time heat record in July, and one set an all-time cold record:\n\nBor (Russia) max. 36.4°C, July 3;\n\nAgadir Airport (Morocco) max. 49.5°C, July 6;\n\nNikolsk (Russia) max. 37.4°C, July 8;\n\nUhta (Russia) max. 35.6°C, July 9;\n\nVelikij Ustjug (Russia) max. 35.6°C, July 9;\n\nKotlas (Russia) max. 35.5°C, July 9;\n\nTroicko Pecherskoe (Russia) max. 35.4°C, July 9;\n\nIndiga (Russia) max. 31.6°C, July 9;\n\nPechora (Russia) max. 35.0°C, July 10;\n\nSaim (Russia) max. 36.9°C, 15 July; beaten again with 37.1°C, July 17;\n\nSorocinsk (Russia) max. 40.8°C, July 15;\n\nIvdel (Russia) max. 35.9°C, July 15;\n\nBiser (Russia) max. 35.2°C, July 16;\n\nVerhnij Ufalej (Russia) max. 36.7°C, July 16;\n\nYekaterinburg (Russia) max. 39.1°C, July 16;\n\nNizhnyj Tagil (Russia) max. 37.6°C, July 16;\n\nBirsk (Russia) max. 37.0°C, July 16;\n\nSamary (Russia) max. 37.1°C, July 16;\n\nGari (Russia) max. 37.4°C, 16 July\n\nKrasnoufimsk (Russia) max. 37.5°C, July 16;\n\nTaimali Research Center (Taiwan) max. 40.5°C, July 16: (New national record high for Taiwan)\n\nKing Island (Australia) min. -1.2°C, July 16;\n\nChokurdah (Russia) max. 32.0°C, July 23;\n\nYonagunijima (Japan) max. 35.5°C, July 23;\n\nTaipei (Taiwan) max. 39.7°C, July 24;\n\nLeting (China) max. 38.8°C, July 24;\n\nKarbala (Iraq) max. 52.4°C, July 24;\n\nNukhaib (Iraq) max. 50.1°C, July 24, beaten again with 50.4°C July 28;\n\nRafha (Saudi Arabia) max. 50.6°C, 24 July; beaten again with 51.1°C, July 30;\n\nDawu (Taiwan) max. 40.2°C, July 25;\n\nSvalbard Airport (Svalbard Islands, Norway) max. 21.7°C, July 25;\n\nHornsund (Svalbard Islands, Norway) max. 16.2°C, July 25;\n\nEureka (Canada) max. 21.9°C, July 25;\n\nKhoy (Iran) max. 42.8°C, July 26;\n\nAl Jouf (Saudi Arabia) max. 47.6°C, July 26; beaten again with 47.7°C on July 28\n\nHouche Al Oumara (Lebanon) max. 45.4°C, 27 July 27: (New national record high for Lebanon)\n\nBaghdad (Iraq) max. 51.8°C, July 28;\n\nAbadan (Iran) max. 52.5°C, July 20;\n\nAmarah (Iraq) max. 53.0°C, July 30;\n\nKuwait Int.
