        "text": "An unusual heatwave has hit the TRNC, with several temperature records broken across the country yesterday. The highest temperature was recorded in Güzelyurt and Geçitkale.\n\nAccording to the TRNC Meteorological Department, a record for the highest temperature in a 49-year period covering 1975-2024 was broken in the Güzelyurt area. Thermometers in this region soared to 45.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nAdditionally, meteorologists reported that the temperature in Geçitkale rose to 44.8 degrees Celsius, also setting a record. In Beyarmudu, the temperature warmed to 41.9 degrees Celsius, while in Çamlıbel, the heat reached 41.4°C.\n\nIt's worth noting that the abnormal heatwave has persisted in the TRNC throughout the week. The extreme temperature rise has led to several major forest fires. Since yesterday, there has been a ban on outdoor work in the TRNC. The restriction is in effect from June 6th to June 9th, from 12:00 PM to 4:00 PM."
