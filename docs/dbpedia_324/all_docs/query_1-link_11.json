The city boasts a population of nine million and encompasses an area of 1035 square kilometers (405 square miles). The Moscow River runs through the center of the city, and the Kremlin, the seat of the Russian government, lies in the direct center. Moscow is thought to have been founded in the 12th Century by Yury Dolgoruky, Prince of Suzdal, who hosted a big feast on the site. The city was shortly after established as a trading route along the Moscow River. Ivan III, who is largely credited with uniting all of Russia, built the Kremlin's cathedrals and declared Moscow the capital of his new kingdom in the 15th century. In the 17th century, Ivan the Great moved the capital to St. Petersburg, where it remained until the Bolsheviks brought the seat of government back to Moscow in 1918. Over the years the city has been sacked and burnt to the ground by the Tartars, the Poles, and the French. Thanks to the resilient spirit of the Russian people, the city remains as vital as ever. Now it is as capitalist in nature as London or New York, and everything from Big Macs to BMWs can be found on its streets. The blue-gray pixels in this false-color image are urban areas. The light green areas surrounding the city are farms and the brown regions are more sparsely vegetated areas. This image of Moscow was acquired by the Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+), flying aboard the Landsat 7 satellite. July 23, 2002, marks the 30th anniversary of the Landsat program. (Click to read the press release-Celebrating 30 Years of Imaging the Earth.) The Landsat program has been particularly instrumental in tracking land use and land cover changes-such as increased urban growth-over the last three decades.

It is argued, that bolshevicks contributed to progress of Russia, but this was reached by mean of purges and terror, during which many peoples were killed, especially representatives of the Russian Ortodox church. A list of scientists, which contributed more than other to the bolshevisation of the Russia and Moscow University, particularly, is given. The controverse between Hegel and Einstein from one part and Marx and bolshevicks from other part is examined also. The bolshevicks destroyed the Russian ortodox church, instead of its modernisation, is argued. The Calendar in the Russian Ortodox church is discussed, which is Julian, and it is argued, that a peaceful dialogue between the representatives of the Church and scientists is needed in order to make a transition to the Gregorian one.\n\nSpace Radar Image of Moscow, Russia\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n1999-05-01\n\nThis is a vertically polarized L-band image of the southern half of Moscow, an area which has been inhabited for 2,000 years. The image covers a diameter of approximately 50 kilometers (31 miles) and was taken on September 30, 1994 by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar aboard the space shuttle Endeavour. The city of Moscow was founded about 750 years ago and today is home to about 8 million residents. The southern half of the circular highway (a road that looks like a ring) can easily be identified as well as the roads and railways radiating out from the center of the city. The city was named after the Moskwa River and replaced Russia's former capital, St. Petersburg, after the Russian Revolution in 1917. The river winding through Moscow shows up in various gray shades. The circular structure of many city roads can easily be identified, although subway connections covering several hundred kilometers are not visible in this image. The white areas within the ring road and outside of it are buildings of the city itself and it suburban towns. Two of many airports are located in the west and southeast of Moscow, near the corners of the image. The Kremlin is located north just outside of the imaged city center. It was actually built in the 16th century, when Ivan III was czar, and is famous for its various churches. In the surrounding area, light gray indicates forests, while the dark patches are agricultural areas.

Little is studied about men who have sex with men (MSM) within these groups. Qualitative research methods were used to explore identities, practices, and factors affecting HIV prevention and risks among immigrant/migrant MSM in Moscow. Nine interviews and three focus group discussions were conducted between April-June 2010 with immigrant/migrant MSM, analyzed as a subset of a larger population of MSM who participated in qualitative research (n=121). Participants were purposively selected men who reported same sex practices (last 12 months). Migrants were men residing in Moscow but from other Russian regions and immigrants from countries outside of Russia. A socioecological framework was used to describe distal to proximal factors that influenced risks for HIV acquisition. MSM ranged from heterosexual to gay-identified. Stigma and violence related to homophobia in homelands and concerns about xenophobia and distrust of migrants in Moscow were emerged as key themes. Participants reported greater sexual freedom in Moscow but feared relatives in homelands would learn of behaviors in Moscow, often avoiding members of their own ethnicity in Moscow. Internalized homophobia was prevalent and linked to traditional sexual views. Sexual risks included sex work, high numbers of partners, and inconsistent condom use. Avoidance of HIV testing or purchasing false results was related to reporting requirements in Russia, which may bar entry or expel those testing positive. HIV prevention for MSM should consider immigrant/migrant populations, the range of sexual identities, and risk factors among these men. The willingness of some men to socialize with immigrants/migrants of other countries may provide opportunities for peer-based prevention approaches. Immigrants/migrants comprised important proportions of the MSM population, yet are rarely acknowledged in research. Understanding their\n\nMoscow meltdown: Can Russia survive\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nStern, J.E.\n\nWestern intelligence analysts and policy makers should pay closer attention to the centrifugal forces in Russia for two primary reasons: nuclear weapons are located in some of the most volatile regions, and central control of the armed forces is eroding. If Russia were to fragment, thousands of weapons and tons of fissile materials would be dispersed to new states with little safeguards infrastructure and little experience in controlling borders, a situation potentially far more dangerous than the breakup of the Soviet Union. Nuclear research, production, maintenance, and dismantlement facilities, plus uranium enrichment and plutonium separation facilities, could be inherited bymoreÂ Â» new, unstable states. Further devolution of political authority could loosen control over sensitive exports and increase the risk of terrorist acquisition of fissile materials. This article discusses the confusion over the legitimacy of the physical and political boundaries of the Russian Federation; then, the economic incentives for regionalism in Russia; next, the main ethnic groups in Russia and the roots of ethnic nationalism in the Russian Federation. It then discusses political disarray in the center and in the regions, and the lack of unity among order-enforcing entities; focuses in somewhat more detail on the Volga-Ural region, where there is a concentration of nuclear weapons and facilities, and which is especially volatile politically. These factors taken together call into question Russia's viability as a state. In post-communist Russia, chaos has replaced order; license has replaced terror. Order-enforcing entities are eviscerated or in conflict. Neither economic shock therapy nor Group of Seven funds can help with these problems; Russia will not be a state until new unifying institutions are created, whether they are democratic or authoritarian.Â«Â less\n\nThe Academic Profession in Russia's Two Capitals: The Impact of 20 Years of Transition\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSivak, Elizaveta; Yudkevich, Maria\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis paper studies the dynamics of key characteristics of the academic profession in Russia based on the analysis of university faculty in the two largest cities in Russia--Moscow and St. Petersburg.

On 20 January 2005 the first Russian University Satellite âUniversitetskiy-Tatyanaâ was launched into circular polar orbit (inclination 83 deg., altitude 940-980 km). The onboard scientific complex âTatyanaâ, as well as the mission control and information receiving centre, was designed and developed at Moscow State University. The scientific programme of the mission includes measurements of space radiation in different energy channels and Earth UV luminosity and lightning. The current education programme consists of basic multimedia lectures âLife of the Earth in the Solar Atmosphereâ and computerized practice exercises âSpace Practiceâ (based on the quasi-real-time data obtained from âUniversitetskiy-Tatyanaâ satellite and other Internet resources). A multimedia lectures LIFE OF EARTH IN THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE containing the basic information and demonstrations of heliophysics (including Sun structure and solar activity, heliosphere and geophysics, solar-terrestrial connections and solar influence on the Earthâs life) was created for upper high-school and junior university students. For the upper-university students there a dozen special computerized hands-on exercises were created based on the experimental quasi-real-time data obtained from our satellites. Students specializing in space physics from a few Russian universities are involved in scientific work. Educational materials focus on upper high school, middle university and special level for space physics students. Moscow State University is now extending its space science education programme by creating multimedia lectures on remote sensing, space factors and materials study, satellite design and development, etc. The space\n\nThe Biggest and the Best: Moscow State University.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHecht, Leo\n\n1978-01-01\n\nMoscow State University (MGU) is the central, most prestigious institution of higher learning in the USSR.

In 1801, when variolations were substituted by more safe cowpox vaccinations, in Russia the first vaccination using the method of Jenner was made exactly in in the Imperial Moscow foster house. From 1805, the smallpox vaccination received the status of force of law, the Imperial Moscow foster house began to produce and to distribute the smallpox vaccine all over the country and apply the smallpox vaccination not only to its foster children but to all turned to and, besides that, to train the smallpox vaccination. In 1857, the Imperial Moscow foster house became the first establishment in Russia where the revaccination was applied. In 1980, the WHO proclaimed that the implementation of the global program of smallpox irradiation resulted in the natural smallpox elimination on Earth. The smallpox became the first communicable disease defeated due to mass vaccination. One third of Earth population was vaccinated by the Soviet vaccine, which originated mainly because of the activities of physicians of the Imperial Moscow foster house.\n\n[The Russian consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of chronic pancreatitis: Enzyme replacement therapy].\n\nPubMed\n\nKhatkov, I E; Maev, I V; Bordin, D S; Kucheryavyi, Yu A; Abdulkhakov, S R; Alekseenko, S A; Alieva, E I; Alikhanov, R B; Bakulin, I G; Baranovsky, A Yu; Beloborodova, E V; Belousova, E A; Buriev, I M; Bystrovskaya, E V; Vertyankin, S V; Vinokurova, L V; Galperin, E I; Gorelov, A V; Grinevich, V B; Danilov, M V; Darvin, V V; Dubtsova, E A; Dyuzheva, T G; Egorov, V I; Efanov, M G; Zakharova, N V; Zagainov, V E; Ivashkin, V T; Izrailov, R E; Korochanskaya, N V; Kornienko, E A; Korobka, V L; Kokhanenko, N Yu; Livzan, M A; Loranskaya, I D; Nikolskaya, K A; Osipenko, M F; Okhlobystin, A V; Pasechnikov, V D; Plotnikova, E Yu; Polyakova, S I; Sablin, O A; Simanenkov, V I; Ursova, N I; Tsvirkun, V V; Tsukanov, V V; Shabunin, A V\n\nPancreatology Club Professional Medical Community, 1A.S.

Daily mortality in Moscow, Russia from all non-accidental, cardiovascular and respiratory causes between January 2000 and February 2006 was analysed. Mortality and displaced mortality during cold spells and heat waves were estimated using independent samples t tests. Cumulative excess non-accidental mortality during the 2001 heat wave was 33% (95% CI 20% to 46%), or approximately 1200 additional deaths, with short-term displaced mortality contributing about 10% of these. Mortality from coronary heart disease increased by 32% (95% CI 16% to 48%), cerebrovascular mortality by 51% (95% CI 29% to 73%) and respiratory mortality by 80% (95% CI 57% to 101%). In the 75+ age group, corresponding mortality increments were consistently higher except respiratory deaths. An estimated 560 extra deaths were observed during the three heat waves of 2002, when non-accidental mortality increased by 8.5%, 7.8% and 6.1%, respectively. About 40% of these deaths were brought forward by only a few days, bringing net mortality change down to 3.2% (95% CI 0.8% to 5.5%). The cumulative effects of the two cold spells in 2006 on mortality were significant only in the 75+ age group, for which average daily mortality from all non-accidental causes increased by 9.9% (95% CI 8.0% to 12%) and 8.9% (95% CI 6.7% to 11%), resulting in 370 extra deaths; there were also significant increases in coronary disease mortality and cerebrovascular mortality. This study confirms that daily mortality in Moscow increases during heat waves and cold spells. A considerable proportion of excess deaths during heat waves occur a short time earlier than they would otherwise have done. Harvesting, or short-term mortality displacement, may be less significant for longer periods of sustained heat stress.\n\nThe Potential of the Modernization of Higher Education in Russia: The Communications of Competences of College Professors and Students\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nOvsiannikov, A.

The ethnic backgrounds of the patients were reported as follows: 23.2% (58 cases) from Russia, 12.8% (32 cases) from Azerbaijan, 14.4% (36 cases) from Armenia, 8.8% (22 cases) from Chechnya, and 21.6% (55 cases) from Dagestan. The remaining 19.2% (48 cases) were from other regions or of unknown origin. More than half (57.6%) of the Behcet's disease patients originated from Central Asia, specifically Azerbaijan, Armenia, Chechnya, and Dagestan. The mean age at disease onset was 31.5âÂ±â9.38 (13-60)âyears old, and the most typical initial manifestations were oral aphthous ulcers. Patients aged 20-39 years old were more commonly affected and displayed a wide clinical spectrum of the disease, with varieties of severe internal organ involvement. The manifestations observed throughout the course of the disease included oral aphthous ulcers (100%), various cutaneous lesions (88.8%), genital ulcers (81.2%), and ocular lesions (54.0%). Besides these, many organs/systems were implicated in patient cases, namely joint (53.2%), vascular (25.2%), neurological (8.0%), gastrointestinal (25.2%), and cardiac (5.6%) systems. Involvements of ocular (pâ<â0.01) and skin (pâ<â0.01) lesions were more frequent in men than in women. HLA-B51 and HLA-A26 typing was performed in 127 patients and 508 healthy controls. HLA-B51 was found in 63.0% of BD patients compared to 20.7% of the healthy control subjects (pâ<â0.001), and HLA-A26 was present in 11.3% of BD patients and 18.9% of the control group. This study shows the presence of BD in Russia, and it is suggested that its prevalence in Central Asian people is much higher than that in White Russian.\n\nBiosensor Detection of Neuropathy Target Esterase in Whole Blood as a Biomarker of Exposure to Neuropathic Organophosphorus Compounds\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2002-10-15\n\nChernogolovka, Moscow Region, Russia Arkady V.

P.\n\n2016-04-01\n\nTeaching astronomy at the Imperial Moscow University in 1811-1826 is reviewed. Lectures in astronomy (as a dedicated course or a part of other courses) were ontinually taught at the Moscow University. During 12 scholar years from 1811-1812 to 1823-1824, except for 1812-1813 during the Patriotic War with France) astronomy was taught in four scholar years by Pankevich (1 year), Chumakov (2 years), Popov (1 year); during five years Chumakov taught optics. Since the 1824-1825 scholar year astronomy was taught on a regular basis by Perevoshchikov. At the same time the chair of the observing astronomer remained vacant for 15 years because of the War of 1812 and of the untimely death of the young, promising magister Alexander Bugrov.\n\nPervaya uchebnaya astronomicheskaya observatoriya Moskovskogo universiteta %t The first eductational astronomical observatory of the Moscow University\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPonomareva, G. A.; Shcheglov, P. V.\n\nUsing archive materials found in the Central Historical Archive of Moscow and early publications in Russian and German press, we follow the history of the struggle for the foundation of the University's astronomical observatory by M. N. Muravyov, the University Warden in 1803-1807. Though F. Goldbach, the astronomy professor in 1804-1811, prepared the observatory's plan and budget, it was not possible to begin construction works. Nevertheless, a wooden dome was built in 1804 on the roof of the University's main building, referred to as \"the astronomical bellevedere\" by Muravyov. This fist educational astronomical observatory was used for practical studies and for the students' observations. F. Goldbach himself observed from the window of a room in his apartment, so his colleagues called that room \"Goldbach's observatory\". Later this fact was a source of confusion for the University's historiographers. The educational observatory was destroyed, with the whole University, by the fire in September 1812. The existing archive documents claim that the Moscow University's Presnya observatory was built as a replacemnet of the one destroyed by the fire in 1812.\n\nGeographical education in Russia: state-of-the-art and new perspectives\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChalov, Sergey R.\n\n2010-05-01\n\nUp-today education systems of different countries face new perspectives in globalizing World. The Russian higher education framework was basically incompatible with the process of making academic degree standards and quality assurance standards more comparable throughout the World (so called Bologna process for Europe). So did Earth Sciences education framework. Today the key question in the further development of Earth sciences in Russia is the interaction with European education system. At the crossroads it is challenging to analyze the history and state-of-the-art. We considered the question on the example of one of the largest centers of the Earth Sciences education in Russia - Faculty of Geography of Lomonosov Moscow State University, which is moreover regarded to be one of the largest scientific and educational centers of geography in the World. There are 1200 students and 180 PhD students studying on the Faculty. The Faculty consists of 15 departments, 8 research laboratories and 4 field stations, where 850 employees work. Tuition of geography was established at Lomonosov Moscow State University since the day of its foundation. The significance of geographical studies at the University, which originally comprised the Faculty of Philosophy, the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Medicine, was already mentioned in the draft plan of its establishment (1755), which said that Â«anyone wishing to attend professors' lectures at the University has to learn foreign languages and first scientific basis beforehand\". For this purpose two Â«gymnasiumsÂ» consisting of four schools were es-tablished at the University. Geography was included into the curriculum of the Â«first scientific basis schoolÂ» and the Â«school of the distinguished European languagesÂ» - German and French. Today Geography in Russia is regarded to be one of the base sciences that are devoted to the problem of society and environment and their interactions. Geography was gone far from the descriptive\n\nThe Physics Department of Moscow University: In Its Ladies' Faces\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nElena, Ermolaeva\n\n2005-10-01\n\nIn commemoration of the 250th anniversary of Moscow University, the Women Council of MSU published a biographical dictionary dedicated to women who contributed significantly to the academic success of their institution and who distinguished themselves both in research and in teaching. The book contains brief biographies of some 619 women employed by MSU; 63 of these entries are for members of the Department of Physics and of its adjacent research institutes. They are doctors of sciences, full professors, recipients of government as well as university awards, and some are WWII veterans. Their lives in science have embodied all tendencies of the Soviet period of the country. The great majority graduated from Moscow State University and have been working at MSU for more than 25 years. At present, the Physics Department consists of 37 sectors with more than two hundred doctors of sciences, 15% of whom are women. The information supplied by the dictionary, combined with data on the younger staff of MSU with similar degrees in physics, lets us compare tendencies in women's professional development, their research and teaching careers, and their success in publishing. It also lets us see some of the key issues. Since 1933 (the year of establishment) more than 25,000 people have graduated from the Physics Department, a quarter of whom were girls. Of 90 students who have graduated with honors this year, one third were girls, and of 22 award-winning thesis this year, 10 were defended by them. About 400 persons are participating in the 3-year postgraduate program of the Physics Department; 30% of all students enrolled this year are girls. Half the winners of annual awards to students, postgraduate students, and ``young scientists'' in physics this year were girls. The percent of successful women in physics is growing.\n\nRussia is on brink of AIDS epidemic.\n\nPubMed\n\nIngram, M\n\n1996-08-03\n\nRussia, and in particular Moscow, is on the brink of an AIDS epidemic, the president of the Russian Medical Academy told doctors gathered in Moscow for a national AIDS seminar. Although Russia has officially registered only 1269 cases of HIV infection, a quarter of them in Moscow, and 193 deaths since the first case appeared in Russia in 1987, health officials are alarmed by the recent rise in the rate of infection. In 1995, 200 new cases were registered, but 205 cases had already been registered in the first 6 months of 1996. The rapid spread of intravenous drug use is the main factor contributing to the rise in HIV infection. According to the head of the Russian AIDS Center, the real number of people infected with HIV in Russia is 3-4 times higher than official numbers, while AIDS activists believe that the real figure is 10-20 times higher. Russia has traditionally blamed its AIDS problem on foreigners and introduced an obligatory HIV test as a visa requirement for long-term visitors. Now neighboring Ukraine and Belarus are being blamed for the latest crisis. Of 1000 known intravenous drug users tested in Svetlogorsk, Belarus, 158 are HIV positive, with 20 results still outstanding. Previously, only 130 people in Belarus were known to be infected with HIV. In the Ukraine, where HIV testing has shown that over 5000 people are HIV positive and where a further 20,000 are estimated to be infected, a special subtype of HIV-1 has been discovered. In 1995 there were 1021 new cases of HIV infection, but in the first 4 months of this year there were 1805 new cases. Although the chief AIDS specialist at Russia's health ministry agrees that health education is more important than scare tactics against foreigners, in 1995 the health ministry received only 49% of the funds allocated for national AIDS education.\n\nSpace Radar Image of Samara, Russia\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n1999-04-15\n\nThis three-frequency space radar image shows the city of Samara, Russia in pink and light green right of center.

Despite of the fact, that some biometeorological indices are already used in weather forecast, the assessment of these indices is especially important during the extreme weather conditions like continuous heat or cold waves. One of the very urgent issues in the applied climatology is the assessment of thermal comfort conditions in the urban areas, because nowadays more than half population of the planet lives there. Especially important is to study thermal comfort conditions in biggest and, thus, densely populated cities, because the effect of heat waves becomes stronger by the urban heat island effect. In July and August 2010 in the biggest city in Russia - Moscow, where more than 11 million people live, the longest and the strongest heat wave as well as the warmest day (29th of July 2010) were recorded since the meteorological observations in Russian capital were started. The main objective of this work is to evaluate the thermal comfort conditions of the warmest day in Moscow. For that purpose several biometeorological indices, particularly PET (physiological equivalent temperature), were analyzed and calculated for the warmest day in Russian capital. The calculations were done for the certain city canyon on the territory of the Moscow State University as well as for the places with natural vegetation. The results were compared with each other and, thus, the complex thermal comfort assessment was done. Also, the results of the calculations for the 29th of July 2010 were compared with the mean meteorological data for this period.\n\nCO2 Fluxes Monitoring at the Level of Field Agroecosystem in Moscow Region of Russia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMeshalkina, Joulia; Mazirov, Ilya; Samardzic, Miljan; Yaroslavtsev, Alexis; Valentini, Riccardo; Vasenev, Ivan\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe Central Russia is still one of the less GHG-investigated European areas especially in case of agroecosystem-level carbon dioxide fluxes monitoring by eddy covariance method. The eddy covariance technique is a statistical method to measure and calculate vertical turbulent fluxes within atmospheric boundary layers. The major assumption of the metod is that measurements at a point can represent an entire upwind area. Eddy covariance researches, which could be considered as repeated for the same area, are very rare. The research has been carried out on the Precision Farming Experimental Field of the Russian Timiryazev State Agricultural University (Moscow, Russia) in 2013 under the support of RF Government grant No. 11.G34.31.0079. Arable derno-podzoluvisls have around 1 The results have shown high daily and seasonal dynamic of agroecosystem CO2 emission. Sowing activates soil microbiological activity and the average soil CO2 emission and adsorption are rising at the same time. CO2 streams are intensified after crop emerging from values of 3 to 7 Î¼mol/s-m2 for emission, and from values of 5 to 20 Î¼mol/s-m2 for adsorption. Stabilization of the flow has come at achieving plants height of 10-12 cm. The vegetation period is characterized by high average soil CO2 emission and adsorption at the same time, but the adsorption is significantly higher. The resulted CO2 absorption during the day is approximately 2-5 times higher than emissions at night. For example, in mid-June, the absorption value was about 0.45 mol/m2 during the day-time, and the emission value was about 0.1 mol/m2 at night. After harvesting CO2 emission is becoming essentially higher than adsorption. Autumn and winter data are fluctuate around zero, but for some periods a small predominance of CO2 emissions over the absorption may be observed. The daily dynamics of CO2 emissions depends on the air temperature with the correlation coefficient changes between 0.4 and 0.8.

Kurchatov is the leading institute in the Former Soviet Union devoted to military and civilian nuclear programs. Founded in 1943 in the outskirts of Moscow, this 100 hectare site of nearly undeveloped, prime real estate is now surrounded by densely populated urban and business districts. Today there are growing concerns over the public safety and environmental security of the site resulting from increasingly obsolete nuclear facilities and a legacy of inadequate waste management practices that resulted in contaminant releases and challenging remediation problems. In addition, there is growing concern over the presence of nuclear facilities within urban areas creating potential targets for terrorist attacks.Â«Â less\n\nThe New Universities of Russia: Problems and Solutions\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKiroi, V.

As a result, it is shown that the relation is in general decreasing in conditions of cold Moscow region: energy consumption as a rule reduces with a rise of the temperature. However, in time of severe frosts the energy consumption increasing goes to nothing due to special measures for energy savings whereas during heat wave episodes of extremely hot weather (especially in summer of 2010) an opposite tendency appears to the energy consumption increase with the increase of the air temperature due to additional consumption for the air conditioning. This relation between E and T is statistically significant with extremely high confidence probability (more than 0.999). The optimum temperature for the energy saving is 18 ËC. The air temperature limit values in Moscow during last decades have been discussed. Daily-averaged T varied from -28.0 ËC in January of 2006 to +31.4 ËC in August of 2010 so a range of this parameter is almost 60 ËC. Catastrophic heat wave in 2010 appeared as a secondary summer maximum of the electric consumption annual course. The relation between E and T for separate years demonstrates strong weekly periodicity at the dynamics of E daily values. As a result statistical distribution of E daily values for separate years is bimodal. One its mode is connected with working-days and another one - with non-work days (Saturday, Sunday and holidays) when consumption is much less. In recent time weekly cycle at the electric consumption became weaker due to total fall of industry in Moscow. In recent years the dependence of energy consumption on the air temperature generally became stronger - probably due to changes of its structure (growth of non-industrial users\n\nUniversity Mergers in Russia: Four Waves of Educational Policy\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nRomanenko, K.

Total annual emissions of polluting substances into the atmosphere in Moscow is likely to be about 2,0 mln. t. More than 90% of pollutants are emitted by traffic. Problem of air quality assessment is very urgent for Moscow both to alarm population and to compare with other world megacities. To study contemporary structure of atmospheric pollution over Moscow megacity data on air composition (including CO, NO, NO2, O3, CH4, CO2, SO2, NMHC, aerosol) obtained since 2002 has been analyzed. The monitoring site is located at Moscow State University meteorological observatory on South-West of Moscow. All observations are provided by A.M. Obukhov Institute of Atmospheric Physics RAS. Due to these continuous measurements typical (basic) level of pollution as well as extreme cases have been studied. The relationship between O3, NOx and VOCs were analyzed as well. Due to weather conditions (cyclonic regime is dominated) concentrations of pollutants usually do not reach dangerous levels but sometimes they are high. The case of abnormal hot and dry weather in the summer of 2010 was investigated. Many Russians were suffering from the record-breaking heat and the worst drought in 40 years. The heat was caused by very intensive and stable blocking anticyclone that established in Moscow since June, 18 till August, 18. Anticyclone of such strength has been never observed before. During 33 days in succession surface air temperature exceeded 30Â°C. During these 2 months troposphere over ETR was almost closed for western winds. Hot weather led to numerous forest and peat fires (about 29,000 cases) with total covered area about 12,000 km2. One of aftermaths was significant change of atmospheric composition. Many cities and settlements were covered by dense haze from fires. Evident presence of high amount of aerosol in the ambient air caused anxiety and application of safeguards.

Russia experiences one of the world's highest levels of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, great mortality differences within the population, and a heavy burden of ill health. Psychological stress has been suggested as a likely explanation of health loss and premature death in Russia and Eastern Europe. However, physiological mechanisms connecting stress with health in Russia remain unclear since existing epidemiological data are scarce and limited to conventional risk factors. Method and Design The survey on Stress Aging and Health in Russia (SAHR) is addressing this knowledge gap by collecting an unusually rich database that includes a wide range of reported information, physical and cognitive health outcomes, and biomarkers in a sample of Muscovite men and women aged 55 and older. The total planned sample size is 2,000 individuals. The sample was randomly selected from epidemiological cohorts formed in Moscow between the mid-1970s and the 1990s and from medical population registers. The baseline data collection was carried out from December 2006 to June 2009. Interviews and medical tests were administered at hospital or at home according to standardized protocol. Questionnaire information includes health, socio-demographic characteristics, economic well-being, cognitive functioning, and batteries on stress and depression.

Moscow State University of Geodesy and Cartography (MIIGAiK) and invited scientist Prof. Dr. Jurgen Oberst were awarded a grant to establish a capable research facility concerned with Planetary Geodesy, Cartography and Space Exploration. Objectives: The goals of the project are to build laboratory infrastructure, and suitable capability for MIIGAiK to participate in the planning, execution and analyses of data from future Russian planetary mis-sions and also to integrate into the international science community. Other important tasks are to develop an attractive work place and job opportunities for planetary geodesy and cartography students. For this purposes new MIIGAiK Extraterrestrial Laboratory (MExLab) was organized. We involved professors, researchers, PhD students in to the projects of Moon and planets exploration at the new level of Russian Space Science development. Main results: MExLab team prepare data for upcom-ing Russian space missions, such as LUNA-GLOB and LUNA-RESOURSE. We established cooperation with Russian and international partners (IKI, ESA, DLR, and foreign Universities) and actively participated in international conferences and workshops. Future works: For the future science development we investigated the old Soviet Archives and received the access to the telemetry data of the Moon rovers Lunokhod-1 and Lunokhod-2. That data will be used in education purposes and could be the perfect base for the analysis, development and support in new Russian and international missions and especially Moon exploration projects. MExLab is open to cooperate and make the consortiums for science projects for the Moon and planets exploration.

The deep peat horizons are heated or burned during smoldering fires, causing the dramatic change in soil properties. But the most of available data are devoted to changes in organo-mineral soils. In addition, the alteration in hydrological regime, for instance drainage, makes landscapes and soils very vulnerable to wildfires. Drained peatlands are widespread in the European part of Russia and they are affected to extreme wildfires of 2010. So there is a need of post-fire peat soils investigations in this region. During current research the soils of drained peatlands of Moscow Region (Russia) subjected to wildfires of 2002 and 2010 were studied. A total of 14 profiles including background and post-pyrogenic histosols and histic podsols were investigated. Soil samples were taken from genetic horizons and from every 10 cm in cases of thick horizons. The morfological properties of soil profiles were studied and the samples were analysed on macroelements content and organic carbon. The total organic carbon contentrations were detected with spectrofotometric method and the concentrations of macroelements were analysed with X-ray fluorescence method. After wildfires on drained peatlands morfological and physico-chemical properties of soils were changed, the horizons of ash (up to 5 cm) and char (up to 3 cm) instead of organic layers were formed. In addition, the plots of post-pirogenic landscape were characterized by high variability of soil properties. For instance, the thickness of organic layer changed from 5 to 30 cm in a small plot of 5X5 m. The changes in element composition were detected. The peat horizons of background histosols had 80-90% of SiO2, 9-5,8% of Al2O3,1,5-5,6% of Fe2O3, 3,7-6,3% of CaO, 0,7-2,8 % of MnO. Background histic podsols contained 88-90% of SiO2, to 4,8% of Al2O3, and the proportion of Fe2O3 and MnO was about 2,3%.

NASA teamed with American and Russian aerospace industries for an extended period in a joint international research program featuring the Russian-built Tu-144LL supersonic aircraft. The object of the program was to develop technologies for a proposed future second-generation supersonic airliner to be developed in the 21st Century. The aircraft's initial flight phase began in June 1996 and concluded in February 1998 after 19 research flights. A shorter follow-on program involving seven flights began in September 1998 and concluded in April 1999. All flights were conducted in Russia from Tupolev's facility at the Zhukovsky Air Development Center near Moscow. The centerpiece of the research program was the Tu 144LL, a first-generation Russian supersonic jetliner that was modified by its developer/builder, Tupolev ANTK (aviatsionnyy nauchno-tekhnicheskiy kompleks-roughly, aviation technical complex), into a flying laboratory for supersonic research. Using the Tu-144LL to conduct flight research experiments, researchers compared full-scale supersonic aircraft flight data with results from models in wind tunnels, computer-aided techniques, and other flight tests. The experiments provided unique aerodynamic, structures, acoustics, and operating environment data on supersonic passenger aircraft. Data collected from the research program was being used to develop the technology base for a proposed future American-built supersonic jetliner. Although actual development of such an advanced supersonic transport (SST) is currently on hold, commercial aviation experts estimate that a market for up to 500 such aircraft could develop by the third decade of the 21st Century. The Tu-144LL used in the NASA-sponsored research program was a 'D' model with different engines than were used in production-model aircraft.

Data were collected from 1167 adults, permanent residents of Moscow, who were interviewed. A 10-item questionnaire was used addressing three major domains: familiarity with epilepsy (2 questions), understanding of epilepsy (5 questions), and attitude towards the PWE (3 questions). Results were standardized to the Moscow population. The study population was generally well informed about epilepsy. About 80% \"has heard\" of epilepsy; however, personal acquaintance with PWE was reported by less than half of the study participants. The level of understanding of the disease and its etiology was quite low. About 60% of the survey participants believed that epilepsy was a type of mental retardation. One-third (34%) of respondents were afraid to stay in the proximity of PWE. Only 38% of the survey participants considered epilepsy to be curable; men significantly less frequently than women. Overall, the level of understanding of epilepsy was proportional to the level of education of respondents. Negative attitudes towards PWE were demonstrated in a significant part of the population. Almost half of the respondents would object to their child playing or studying with a child who has epilepsy and more than half (57%) were against the marriage of their daughter or son to a person with epilepsy. Two-fifths of the respondents ranked epilepsy as the \"least preferred\" of the six chronic diseases for a colleague. This is the first study on awareness and attitudes to PWE in the adult population of Moscow. The study demonstrated that the general public is familiar with epilepsy, but has a rather low level of understanding of essential aspects of the disease. There is an overall high level of negative attitudes towards PWE in Russia, creating a need for targeted interventions. These results reinforced the importance of public education in reducing the stigma of epilepsy.

P.; Gornov, V. F.; Dmitriev, A. N.; Kolesova, M. V.; Yurchenko, V. A.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe paper is devoted to a problem of increasing the efficiency of low-potential geothermal heat in heat pump systems of residential buildings the Moscow oblast of Russia, including Moscow. Estimates of a natural geothermal potential in the Moscow oblast (based on climatological data for the period from 1982 to 2011) are presented and a \"Typical climatic year of natural soil temperature variations for the geoclimatic conditions of the Moscow oblast, including the city of Moscow\" is proposed. Numerical simulation of the influence of geothermal energy potential and the depth of heat wells on the efficiency of ground source heat pump systems for the heat supply of residential buildings is carried out. Analysis of the numerical simulation showed that the operation of a heat pump system in a house heating mode under the geoclimatic conditions of the Moscow oblast leads to a temperature drop of the heat-exchange medium circulating through heat wells to 5-6Â°C by the end of the first 10 years of operation, and the process stabilizes by the 15th year of operation, and further changes in the heat-exchange medium temperature do not any longer significantly affect the temperature of the heat-exchange medium in the heat well. In this case, the exact dependence of the heat-exchange medium temperature drop on the depth is not revealed. Data on the economically expedient heat well depth for the conditions of the Moscow oblast ensuring a net present value for the whole residential building life cycle are presented. It is found that the heat well depth of 60 m can be considered as an endpoint for the Moscow oblast, and a further heat well deepening is economically impractical.\n\nTowards a New Russia Policy\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2008-02-01\n\nFebruary 5, 2007; Fyodor Lukanov, âWhere to Focus If Your Are Expecting Change,â Moscow Times, February 7, 2007; Rodriguez. 114 59.

This study aimed to identify the aetiological agents of the diseases and to investigate the distribution of each Echinococcus species in Russia. A total of 75 Echinococcus specimens were collected from 14 host species from 2010 to 2012. Based on the mitochondrial DNA sequences, they were identified as Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto (s.s.), E. canadensis and E. multilocularis. E. granulosus s.s. was confirmed in the European Russia and the Altai region. Three genotypes, G6, G8 and G10 of E. canadensis were detected in Yakutia. G6 was also found in the Altai region. Four genotypes of E. multilocularis were confirmed; the Asian genotype in the western Siberia and the European Russia, the Mongolian genotype in an island of Baikal Lake and the Altai Republic, the European genotype from a captive monkey in Moscow Zoo and the North American genotype in Yakutia. The present distributional record will become a basis of public health to control echinococcoses in Russia. The rich genetic diversity demonstrates the importance of Russia in investigating the evolutionary history of the genus Echinococcus.\n\nMoscow’s ’Near Abroad’ Security Policy in Post-Soviet Europe\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1993-06-01\n\nexemplified by the More than 100,000 Ukrainian service experience of former Major General personnel in other republics have been Valeriy Kuznetsov .

Distinctive features of Moscow's development history are its greenbelt, which dates from 1935 and is becoming increasingly fragmented, proliferation of satellite cities at the urban fringe, conversion of seasonal dachas into full-time residences, the very exclusive Rublevo Uspenskoe Highway development, and today's crippling traffic congestion. The recent economic crisis has slowed development and actually increased the supply of âeconomy-classâ single-family homes, for which there is much pent-up desire but insufficient credit availability to meet the demand. A renewed commitment to sustainability's triple bottom lineâenvironmental quality, equity, and economic prosperityâwill require greater government transparency and fairness, stronger planning controls, and an expanded public transportation system.\n\n[A large-scale epidemic of diphtheria in Moscow in recent years: patterns of development].\n\nPubMed\n\nChistiakova, G G; Filatov, N N; Korzhenkova, M P; Solodovnikov, Iu P; Lytkina, I N; Maksimova, N M; Markina, S S\n\n2001-01-01\n\nData on the dynamics of diphtheria morbidity in Moscow in 1958-1999 are presented. The last epidemic which started at the end of the 1980s and reached its peak in 1994, giving a 59-fold rise in morbidity in comparison with the pre-epidemic period, is characterized in detail. During the epidemic 12,267 persons fell ill, 454 of them died (mortality rate was 4%). Having started in Moscow, the epidemic gradually spread not only over the territory of Russia, but also over some other republics of the former Soviet Union (Ukraine, Belarus, etc.). Possible causes of this epidemic emergency are considered. The ever increasing share of adult population among persons affected by the epidemic (75%) is noted. The infection adults is characterized by severity of clinical manifestations and increased morbidity among adults, is shown. Under complicated social and economic conditions (crisis situation) the increase of groups of high risk which included unemployed adults of working age, retirees as well as socially non-adapted persons, was registered. Mainly these groups determined tense epidemiological situation in diphtheria in Moscow.\n\nTemperature-induced excess mortality in Moscow, Russia.\n\nPubMed\n\nRevich, Boris; Shaposhnikov, Dmitri\n\n2008-05-01\n\nAfter considering the observed long-term trends in average monthly temperatures distribution in Moscow, the authors evaluated how acute mortality responded to changes in daily average, minimum and maximum temperatures throughout the year, and identified vulnerable population groups, by age and causes of death. A plot of the basic mortality-temperature relationship indicated that this relationship was V-shaped with the minimum around 18 degrees C. Each 1 degree C increment of average daily temperature above 18 degrees C resulted in an increase in deaths from all non-accidental causes by 2.8%, from coronary heart disease by 2.7%, from cerebrovascular diseases by 4.7%, and from respiratory diseases by 8.7%, with a lag of 0 or 1 day.

Therefore the vulnerability of the urban environment - the living space for millions of people - to the climate change has to be investigated. It is well known that urban features strongly influence the atmospheric boundary layer and determine the microclimatic features of the local environment, such as urban heat island (UHI). Available temperature observations in cities are, however, influenced by the natural climate variations, human-induced climate warming (IPCC, 2007) and in the same time by the growth and structural modification of the urban areas. The relationship between these three factors and their roles in climate changes in the cities are very important for the climatic forecast and requires better understanding. In this study, we made analysis of the air temperature change and urban heat island evolution within Moscow urban area during decades 1970-2010, while this urban area had undergone intensive growth and building modification allowing the population of Moscow to increase from 7 to 12 million people. Analysis was based on the data from several meteorological stations in Moscow region and Moscow city, including meteorological observatory of Lomonosov Moscow State University. Differences in climate change between urban and rural stations, changes of the power and shape of urban heat island and their relationships with changes of building height and density were investigated. Collected data and obtained results are currently to be used for the validation of the regional climate model COSMO-CLM with the purpose to use this model for further more detailed climate research and forecasts for Moscow metropolitan area.

Urban soils are subject to significant anthropogenic influences. Anthropogenic impact affects both the plants and the soil microbiota. So, soil CO2 efflux and soil profile CO2 concentration probably differ in urban and natural soils. Influence of abiotic factors on soil carbon dioxide production is explored insufficiently. The research of their impact on soil carbon dioxide production is necessary to predict soil response to anthropogenic climate change. The aim of this study was estimation of annual soil CO2 production and the impact of climatic factors on it. The research took place in Moscow State University Botanical Garden Arboretum (southern taiga). Investigations were carried out at two sites: the areas planted with Picea obovata and Carpinus betulus. The study was conducted with 1-2 weeks intervals between November 2014 and December 2015. Emission measurement were carried out by closed chamber technique, profile concentration were measured by soil air sampling tubes method. Annual carbon dioxide soil surface efflux of soil planted with Picea obovata was 1370 gCO2/(m2 * year), soil planted with Carpinus betulus - 1590 gCO2/(m2 * year). Soil CO2 concentration increased with depth in average of 3300 to 12000 ppm (at 80 cm depth). Maximum concentration values are confined to the end of vegetation period (high biological activity) and to beginning of spring (spring ice cover of soil prevents CO2 emission). Soil CO2 efflux depends on soil temperature at 10 cm depth (R = 0.89; p <0.05), in a less degree it correlate with soil surface temperature and with soil temperature at 20 cm depth (r=0.88; p<0.05). Soil moisture has a little effect on CO2 efflux in the annual cycle (r=-0.16; p<0.05). However in vegetation period efflux of carbon dioxide largely depends on soil moisture, due to the fact, that soil moisture is limiting factor for soil\n\nHandgrip strength and its prognostic value for mortality in Moscow, Denmark, and England\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDemakakos, Panayotes; Shkolnikova, Maria; Thinggaard, Mikael; Vaupel, James W.; Christensen, Kaare; Shkolnikov, Vladimir M.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground This study compares handgrip strength and its association with mortality across studies conducted in Moscow, Denmark, and England. Materials The data collected by the Study of Stress, Aging, and Health in Russia, the Study of Middle-Aged Danish Twins and the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins, and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing was utilized. Results Among the male participants, the age-standardized grip strength was 2 kg and 1 kg lower in Russia than in Denmark and in England, respectively. The age-standardized grip strength among the female participants was 1.9 kg and 1.6 kg lower in Russia than in Denmark and in England, respectively. In Moscow, a one-kilogram increase in grip strength was associated with a 4% (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.94, 0.99) reduction in mortality among men and a 10% (HR = 0.90, 95%CI: 0.86, 0.94) among women. Meanwhile, a one-kilogram increase in grip strength was associated with a 6% (HR = 0.94, 95%CI: 0.93, 0.95) and an 8% (HR = 0.92, 95%CI: 0.90, 0.94) decrease in mortality among Danish men and women, respectively, and with a 2% (HR = 0.98, 95%CI: 0.97, 0.99) and a 3% (HR = 0.97, 95%CI: 0.95, 0.98) reduction in mortality among the English men and women, respectively. Conclusion The study suggests that, although absolute grip strength values appear to vary across the Muscovite, Danish, and English samples, the degree to which grip strength is predictive of mortality is comparable across national populations with diverse socioeconomic and health profiles and life expectancy levels.
