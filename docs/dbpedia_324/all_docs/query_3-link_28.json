        "text": "April was a big one for weather watchers, thanks to rain, temperature and wind gust records, officials say.\n\nThings transpired quickly, with the third wettest April day on record occurring on April 1, bringing with it record cool high temperatures, according to Tucson’s National Weather Service.\n\nTucson’s average temperature in April was 67.3 degrees, just one degree below normal.\n\nThe month ranks as the 42nd warmest April on record. Temperature highs ranged from 95 degrees on April 22, to a low of 39 degrees on April 7.\n\nInterestingly, meteorologists noted that the monthly low temperature for April was in the 30s, while March’s monthly low temperature was in the 40s. This flip-flop has happened only one other time, meteorologists said, and that was in 2017. That year, the March monthly low was 40 degrees while April’s was 37 degrees.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nOnly one temperature record was set last month. That record was for cool high on April 1, when it reached 55 degrees, the weather service says. It broke the April 1949 record high of 56 degrees.\n\nMost of the rain that fell on Tucson in April fell across the metro area on April 1st, with showers lingering into April 2. On that day, .88 inches of rain fell at the Tucson International Airport., the official site of the city’s weather data collection. From 5:57 p.m. to 6:12 p.m. over a half inch of rain was recorded to have fallen at the airport.\n\nMeteorologists note that April 1, was the third wettest April day on record.\n\nNot only was April wet, it was also windy. This April saw its highest wind gust since April 2017 with a gust of 52 mph on April 5.\n\nAs this weekend approaches, and May kicks into high gear, temperatures are predicted to stay steadily in the low 90s during the day and upper 50s in the evening.\n\nClear skies and “sunny, warm and dry” conditions should make the upcoming weekend a pleasant one, the weather report indicates."
