        "text": "Предложена новая модель формирования суточного хода интенсивности городского острова тепла. Модель учитывает фазовые различия в суточном ходе температур в городе и сельской местности, обусловленные теплофизическими неоднородностями в слоях суточного теплооборота. В сельской местности верхний, обогащенный органикой слой грунта приводит к меньшему (по сравнению с городом) отставанию температурного хода от радиационного. В результате формируется типичная для большинства городов мира суточная кривая интенсивности городского острова тепла с ночным максимумом и дневным минимумом. Модель хорошо подтверждается данными, полученными на метеостанциях, расположенных в г. Екатеринбурге и в пригороде. We propose a new model for the formation of the diurnal variations in the intensity of an urban heat island. The model takes into account phase differences between daily urban and rural temperature variations resulting from heterogeneities in the thermal properties of soils. In rural areas influence of the upper layer of soil enriched with organic matter results in a smaller (compared with the city) lag of the temperature course from the radiation one. As a result, a diurnal pattern of the variations in an urban heat island intensity including a nighttime maximum and a daily minimum is formed. This pattern is typical for most cities in the world. The model is well confirmed by the data obtained at meteorological stations located in Yekaterinburg city and in the suburbs\n\nThe paper deals with the analysis of the subsurface urban thermal field using temperature logging in boreholes. The method for the separation and quantification of temperature anomalies in an urban subsurface induced by climate change and the building construction at the local area has been described. The differences in the penetration dynamics for climate and local anomalies afford to estimate their contributions separately. The study was carried out by the example of the borehole IGF-280 located in Yekaterinburg, Russia. It was found that the value of local temperature anomaly caused by the building construction is much higher than that induced by climate change (11 K versus 1.4 K). But the climate temperature anomaly penetrates deeper than the local one (140 m for the climate anomaly versus 90 m for the local one). We also assessed changes in heat content due to climatic changes and building operation. The heat content of the rocks increased by 15.6·107 J/m2 due to climate change over the past 150 years. The building input to the heat content increase is more than twice as higher – 38.6·107 J/m2. About 40% of the heat content gain caused by climate change is concentrated in the 20-meter layer of rocks, and 97% of that – in the upper 100 m. 74% of the heat content gain due to the building influence are concentrated in the upper 20 m.\n\nThe article deals with the analysis of temporal variability of the urban heat island (UHI) in the field of surface air temperatures in Yekaterinburg using the data on meteorological observations on weather stations “Yekaterinburg” and “Verkhnee Dubrovo”. The UHI intensity variations have been analyzed for the periods from annual/interannual to diurnal. The sustainable effect of the urban heat island is manifested in all seasons. Annual cycles of monthly averaged UHI values demonstrates “W”-shaped form with maxima of about 1.0 ºС in February/March and in three summer months. Summer maximum is generally determined by maximal diurnal (night) UHI values. The maximum in February/March is related to the increased minimum daily values. From the 50s of the 20th century “W”-shaped annual curve of the UHI intensity remained unchanged under the increase in mean annual UHI values while growing at a rate of 1.31 ºС/100 years to the beginning of the 80s. At the same time, summer maximum increased at a faster rate in comparison with the winter one. Since the beginning of the 80s, the mean annual UHI intensity has stabilized at the level of 0.8 ºС. In a diurnal cycle, the maximal UHI intensity (to 2.4 ºС) is observed in May-July after the sunset. Maximal daily UHI intensity values in summer months are associated with a slower cooling of the city in high-rise building area. The local afternoon maximum (up to 0.8 ºС) caused by the insolation maximum under low albedo value of the urban coverage occurs also from May to July. In the autumn-winter period and at the beginning of spring, the daily amplitude of the UHI intensity decreases due to a decrease in the maximum of UHI and a slight increase in the minimum one. The increase in the minimum UHI values is facilitated by cloudiness, snow cover, calm wind conditions, an increase in the concentration of aerosol and water vapor near the surface and anthropogenic heat emissions. The study results can be used in fundamental and applied climatology, in the development of urban policy.\n\nResearch subject. The relationships between heat fluxes and ground surface temperatures in a diurnal cycle. Methods . Experimental studies, including actinometric observations and monitoring of surface temperatures and surface heat fluxes for a soil and an artificial layer, were performed at the Verkhnee Dubrovo meteorological station in 2020. Results. The surface heat flux varies synchronously both with the total solar radiation near the earth’s surface and insolation at the upper boundary of the atmosphere. Maximal values of these heat fluxes are observed at the solar noon. The temperature response lags behind them by the time interval determined by the soil’s thermal heterogeneity. In this study, we extend our model of the ground surface temperature response to external radiative forcing, which was developed earlier, to the case of a thermal inhomogeneous half-space. An analytical expression for the simplest case of inhomogeneity (the presence of an upper layer with thermal properties different from those of the underlying rocks) is given and investigated. If the upper layer demonstrates a reduced thermal conductivity, the phase shift between the heat flux and the temperature response decreases in comparison with the value for a homogeneous half-space (45°). Conclusion. The soil studies conducted at the “Verkhnee Dubrovo” meteorological station allowed us to construct a thermophysical section and to verify the previously developed model using experimental data. The errors of theoretical estimates, in general, do not exceed those of the phase estimate at a 10-minute sampling rate. The obtained results can be applied when conducting climatic (including palaeoclimatic) and environmental studies, as well as when investigating heat exchange processes on artificial urban surfaces and their role in the formation of urban heat islands.\n\nSubsurface temperatures are substantially higher in urban areas than in surrounding rural environments; the result is a subsurface urban heat island (SUHI). SUHIs and their drivers have received attention in studies world-wide. In this study, a well-constrained data set of subsurface temperatures from Amsterdam, The Netherlands, is presented. The study demonstrates that, through modeling of centuries-long (from fourteenth to twenty-first century) urban development and climate change, along with the history of both the surface urban heat-island temperatures and ground surface temperatures, it is possible to simulate the development and present state of the Amsterdam SUHI. The results provide insight into the drivers of long-term SUHI development, which makes it possible to distinguish subterranean heat sources of more recent times that are localized drivers (such as geothermal energy systems, sewers, boiler basements, subway stations or district heating) from larger-scale drivers (mainly heat loss from buildings and raised ground-surface temperatures due to pavements). Because these findings have consequences for the assessment of the shallow geothermal potential of the SUHIs, it is proposed to distinguish between (1) a regional, long-term SUHI that has developed over centuries due to the larger-scale drivers, and (2) local anomalies caused by anthropogenic heat sources less than one century old."
