        "text": "Capital and largest city of Kyrgyzstan\n\nCapital city in Kyrgyzstan\n\nBishkek,[a] formerly known as Pishpek and Frunze, is the capital and largest city of Kyrgyzstan. Bishkek is also the administrative centre of the Chüy Region.[b] Bishkek is situated near the border with Kazakhstan and has a population of 1,074,075, as of 2021.[6] Bishkek is the primate city of Kyrgyzstan—it is the sole metropolis in the country,[citation needed] and about 17% of all inhabitants of the country live in Bishkek's metropolitan area.\n\nThe Khanate of Kokand established the fortress of Pishpek in 1825 to control local caravan routes and to collect tribute from Kyrgyz tribes. On 4 September 1860, with the approval of the Kyrgyz, Russian forces led by Colonel Apollon Zimmermann destroyed the fortress. In the present day, the fortress ruins can be found just north of Jibek jolu Street, near the new main mosque.[7] A Russian settlement was established in 1868 on the site of the fortress under its original name, Pishpek. It lay within the General Governorship of Russian Turkestan and its Semirechye Oblast.\n\nThe Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast was established in 1925 in Russian Turkestan, promoting Pishpek to its capital. In 1926, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union renamed the city Frunze, after Bolshevik military leader Mikhail Frunze (1885–1925), who was born there. Frunze became the capital of the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic in 1936, during the final stages of national delimitation in the Soviet Union. In 1991, the Kyrgyz parliament changed the capital's name to Bishkek.\n\nBishkek is situated at an altitude of about 800 metres (2,600 ft), just off the northern fringe of the Kyrgyz Ala-Too Range, an extension of the Tian Shan mountain range. These mountains rise to a height of 4,895 metres (16,060 ft). North of the city, a fertile and gently undulating steppe extends far north into neighboring Kazakhstan. The river Chüy drains most of the area. Bishkek is connected to the Turkestan–Siberia Railway by a spur line.\n\nBishkek is a city of wide boulevards and marble-faced public buildings combined with numerous Soviet-style apartment blocks surrounding interior courtyards. There are also thousands of smaller, privately built houses, mostly outside the city centre. Streets follow a grid pattern, with most flanked on both sides by narrow irrigation channels, which provide water to trees which provide shade during the hot summers.\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nBishkek is supposedly named after the paddle used to churn fermenting milk.[8][9][10]\n\nThe official website of the Bishkek's city hall provides the following etymological justification for the name of the city: the pregnant wife of a hero lost a paddle used to churn kumis. While looking for it, she suddenly gave birth to a boy, who she named Bishkek. Bishkek would grow up to be a noble figure and after his death, was buried on a mound near the banks of the Alamüdün. There, a tombstone was erected. The building was seen and described by travelers of the 17th and 18th centuries.[11]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Timeline of Bishkek\n\nBased on DNA evidence, the area near Bishkek is considered one of the possible origins of the Black Death between AD 1346 and 1353.[12]\n\nKokhand rule\n\n[edit]\n\nOriginally a caravan rest stop, possibly founded by the Sogdians, on one of the branches of the Silk Road through the Tian Shan range, the location was fortified in 1825 by the khan of Kokand with a mud fort. In the last years of Kokhand rule, the Pishpek fortress was led by Atabek, the Datka. In 1844, the forces of Ormon Khan, the leader of the Kara-Kyrgyz Khanate [ky], briefly captured the fortress.[13]\n\nTsarist era\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1860, Imperial Russia annexed the area, and the military forces of Colonel Apollon Zimmerman took and razed the fort. Colonel Zimmermann rebuilt the town over the destroyed fort and appointed field-Poruchik Titov as head of a new Russian garrison. The Imperial Russian government redeveloped the site from 1877 onward, encouraging the settlement of Russian peasants by giving them fertile land to develop.\n\nSoviet era\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1926, the city became the capital of the newly established Kirghiz ASSR and was renamed Frunze after Mikhail Frunze, Lenin's close associate who was born in Bishkek and played key roles during the revolutions of 1905 and 1917 and during the Russian Civil War of the early 1920s.\n\nIndependence era\n\n[edit]\n\nThe early 1990s were a tumultuous time for Bishkek. In June 1990, a state of emergency was declared following severe ethnic riots in southern Kyrgyzstan that threatened to spread to the capital. The city was renamed Bishkek on 5 February 1991, and Kyrgyzstan achieved independence later that year during the breakup of the Soviet Union. Before independence, the majority of Bishkek's population were ethnic Russians. In 2004, Russians made up approximately 20% of the city's population, and about 7–8% in 2011.[14]\n\nBishkek is Kyrgyzstan's financial centre, with all of the country's 21 commercial banks headquartered there. During the Soviet era, the city was home to many industrial plants, but most have been shut down since 1991 or now operate on a much-reduced scale. One of Bishkek's largest employment centres today is the Dordoy Bazaar open market, where many of the Chinese goods imported to CIS countries are sold.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nOrientation\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough Bishkek itself is relatively young, its surrounding area has some sites of interest dating to prehistoric times. There are also sites from the Greco-Buddhist period, the period of Nestorian influence, the era of the Central Asian khanates, and the Soviet period.[15][failed verification]\n\nThe central part of the city is laid out on a rectangular grid plan. The city's main street is the east-west Chüy Avenue (Chüy Prospekti), named after the region's main river. In the Soviet era, it was called Lenin Avenue. Along or near it are many important government buildings and universities. These include the Academy of Sciences compound. The westernmost section of the avenue is known as Deng Xiaoping Avenue.\n\nThe main north–south street is Yusup Abdrakhmanov Street, still commonly referred to by its old name, Sovietskaya Street. Its northern and southern sections are called, respectively, Yelebesov and Baityk Batyr Streets. Several major shopping centres are located along with it, and in the north, it provides access to Dordoy Bazaar.\n\nErkindik (\"Freedom\") Boulevard runs from north to south, from the main railroad station (Bishkek II) south of Chüy Avenue to the museum quarter and sculpture park just north of Chüy Avenue, and further north toward the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the past, it was called Dzerzhinsky Boulevard, named after a Communist revolutionary, Felix Dzerzhinsky, and its northern continuation is still called Dzerzhinsky Street.\n\nAn important east–west street is Jibek Jolu ('Silk Road'). It runs parallel to Chüy Avenue about 2 km (1.2 mi) north of it and is part of the main east–west road of Chüy Region. Both the eastern and western bus terminals are located along Jibek Jolu.\n\nThere is a Roman Catholic church located at ul. Vasiljeva 197 (near Rynok Bayat). It is the only Catholic cathedral in Kyrgyzstan.[16]\n\nA stadium named in honour of Dolon Omurzakov is located near the centre of Bishkek. This is the largest stadium in the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\nCity centre\n\n[edit]\n\nKyrgyz State Historical Museum, located in Ala-Too Square, the main city square.\n\nState Museum of Applied Arts, containing examples of traditional Kyrgyz handicrafts.\n\nFrunze House Museum.\n\nStatue of Ivan Panfilov in the park near the White House.\n\nAn equestrian statue of Mikhail Frunze stands in a large park (Boulevard Erkindik) across from the train station.\n\nThe train station was built in 1946 by German prisoners of war and has survived since then without further renovation or repairs; most of those who built it perished and were buried in unmarked pits near the station. [citation needed]\n\nThe main government building, the White House, is a large seven-story marble building and the former headquarters of the Communist Party of the Kirghiz SSR.\n\nAt Ala-Too Square there is an independence monument where the changing of the guards may be watched.\n\nOsh Bazaar, west of the city centre, is a large, picturesque produce market.\n\nKyrgyz National Philharmonic, concert hall.\n\nOuter neighbourhoods\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Dordoy Bazaar, just inside the bypass highway on the north-eastern edge of the city, is a major retail and wholesale market.\n\nOutside the city\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Kyrgyz Ala-Too mountain range, some 40 kilometres (25 mi) away, provides a spectacular backdrop to the city; the Ala Archa National Park is only a 30 to 45 minutes drive away.\n\nDistances\n\n[edit]\n\nBishkek is about 300 km away directly from the country's second largest city Osh. However, its nearest large city is Almaty of Kazakhstan, which is 190 km to the east. Furthermore, it is 470 km from Tashkent (Uzbekistan), 680 km from Dushanbe (Tajikistan), and about 1,000 km each from Astana (Kazakhstan), Ürümqi (China), Islamabad (Pakistan), and Kabul (Afghanistan).\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nBishkek has a Mediterranean-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dsa), as the average mean temperature in the winter is below 0 °C (32.0 °F).[17] Average precipitation is around 440 millimetres (17 in) per year. Average daily high temperatures range from 3 °C (37.4 °F) in January to about 31 °C (87.8 °F) during July.[18] The summer months are dominated by dry periods, punctuated by the occasional thunderstorm, which produces strong gusty winds and rare dust storms. The mountains to the south provide a natural boundary and protection from damaging weather, as does the smaller mountain chain that runs north-west to south-east. In the winter months, sparse snow storms and frequent heavy fog are the dominating features. There are sometimes temperature inversions, during which the fog can last for days at a time.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nBishkek is the most populated city in Kyrgyzstan. Its population, estimated in 2021, was 1,074,075.[6] From the foundation of the city to the mid-1990s, ethnic Russians and other peoples of European descent (Ukrainians, Germans) comprised the majority of the city's population. According to the 1970 census, the ethnic Kyrgyz were only 12.3%, while Europeans comprised more than 80% of the Frunze population. Now Bishkek is a predominantly Kyrgyz city, with 75% of its residents Kyrgyz, while European peoples make up around 15% of the population.[20] Despite this fact, Russian is the main language while Kyrgyz continues losing ground, especially among the younger generations.[21]\n\nHistorical populations in Bishkek\n\nYearPop.±% p.a.1876182— 18822,135+50.74%18934,857+7.76%18976,615+8.03%19029,656+7.86%190713,752+7.33%191320,102+6.53%192636,610+4.72%193992,783+7.42%1959223,831+4.50%\n\nYearPop.±% p.a.1970436,459+6.26%1979535,450+2.30%1989619,903+1.48%1999762,308+2.09%2009835,743+0.92%2010846,500+1.29%2011859,800+1.57%2012874,400+1.70%20211,074,075+2.31%\n\nSource:[22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][3][6]\n\nEcology and environment\n\n[edit]\n\nAir quality\n\n[edit]\n\nEmissions of air pollutants in Bishkek amounted to 14,400 tons in 2010.[30] Among all cities in Kyrgyzstan, the level of air pollution in Bishkek is the highest, occasionally exceeding maximum allowable concentrations by several times, especially in the city centre.[31] For example, concentrations of formaldehyde occasionally exceed maximum allowable limits by a factor of four. The hydrogeologist Zheenbek Kulbekov identifies coal-heating mainly in informal settlements (samozakhvat), the exhaust from private vehicles and the lack of air circulation as the three main factors for the grave air pollution in Kyrgyzstan’s capital.[32] The latter is mainly due to the haphazard construction of private multi-story buildings - in contradiction to former city plans developed up until the end of the USSR - which prompted discussion on a moratorium on the further construction of high-rise buildings.[33]\n\nResponsibility for ambient air quality monitoring in Bishkek lies with the Kyrgyz State Agency of Hydrometeorology. There are seven air-quality monitoring stations in Bishkek, measuring levels of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, formaldehyde, and ammonia.[30]\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nBishkek uses the Kyrgyzstan currency, the som. The som's value fluctuates regularly but averaged around 85 som per U.S. dollar as of March 2023. The economy in Bishkek is primarily agricultural, and agricultural products are sometimes bartered in the outlying regions. The streets of Bishkek are regularly lined with produce vendors in a market-style venue. In most of the downtown area there is a more urban cityscape with banks, stores, markets, and malls. Sought-after goods include hand-crafted artisan pieces, such as statues, carvings, paintings, and many nature-based sculptures.\n\nHousing\n\n[edit]\n\nAs with many cities in post-Soviet states, housing in Bishkek has undergone extensive changes since the collapse of the Soviet Union. While housing was formerly distributed to citizens in the Soviet era, housing in Bishkek has since become privatised.\n\nThough single-family houses are slowly becoming more popular, the majority of the residents live in Soviet-era apartments. Despite the Kyrgyz economy experiencing growth, increases in available housing have been slow with very little new construction and a doubling of prices from 2001 to 2002.[34] This changed by the 2010s when an unprecedented housing boom has transformed the city. By 2021, over 246 construction firms were active in Kyrgyzstan, primarily focusing on upscale residences, often marketed as 'business class' or 'premium class' accommodations.[32] The southern part of the city, where a significant portion of new constructions is concentrated, faces a critical concern due to its proximity to the Issyk-Ata fault line.[32] Compounded by the inadequately seismic-proof architecture of most of these buildings, this situation poses a serious threat to the safety of residents and has sparked criticism.[35] Limited land availability propels private developers to encroach into socialist-era residential zones, resulting in the loss of green spaces and vital social infrastructure, including sports fields and playgrounds.[36]\n\nThose unable to afford the high housing price within Bishkek, notably internal migrants from rural villages and small provincial towns, often have to resort to informal squatter settlements on the city's outskirts such as Ak Jar, Ak Jol, Ak Örgö, Altyn Kazyk, Archa Beshik, Kalys-Ordo, Kayndy-2, Kelechek, Muras-Ordo and TETS-2 Yntymak.[37] These urban settlements are estimated to house 400,000 people or about 30 percent of Bishkek's population. While many of the settlements have lacked basic necessities such as electricity and running water, recently, the local government has pushed to provide these services.[38]\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nLocal government is administered by the Bishkek Mayor's Office. Askarbek Salymbekov was mayor until his resignation in August 2005, after which his deputy, Arstanbek Nogoev, took over the mayorship. Nogoev was in turn removed from his position in October 2007 through a decree of President Kurmanbek Bakiyev and replaced by businessman and former first deputy prime minister Daniar Usenov.[39][40][41] In July 2008 former head of the Kyrgyz Railways Nariman Tuleyev was appointed mayor, who was dismissed by the interim government after 7 April 2010. From April 2010 to February 2011 Isa Omurkulov, also a former head of the Kyrgyz Railways, was an interim mayor,[42] and from 4 February 2011 to 14 December 2013 he was re-elected the mayor of Bishkek.[43][44] Kubanychbek Kulmatov was nominated for election by parliamentary group of Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan in city kenesh, and he was elected as a new mayor on 15 January 2014,[45] and stepped down on 9 February 2016.[46] The next mayor, Albek Sabirbekovich Ibraimov, was also nominated for election by parliamentary group of Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan in city kenesh, and Bishkek City Kenesh elected him on 27 February 2016.[47] The current mayor is Emil Abdykadyrov, who was elected on 24 February 2022.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\n[edit]\n\nBishkek city covers 169.6 square kilometres (65.5 square miles)[3] and is administered separately and not part of any region. Besides the city proper, one urban-type settlement and one village are administered by the city: Chong-Aryk and Orto-Say.[2] The city is divided into 4 districts: Birinchi May, Lenin, Oktyabr and Sverdlov. Chong-Aryk and Orto-Say are part of Lenin District.[2] Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been discussion of replacing the Soviet era district names with ones that reflect Kyrgyz identity and history. Other former Soviet republics have widely replaced Soviet era place names; despite renaming the capital in 1991, Kyrgyzstan is the only nation in Central Asia to retain Soviet era names for districts in its capital.[48]\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nBishkek is culturally the country's most important city. It is home to the National Library of the Kyrgyz Republic as well as a number of museums, e.g. the Kyrgyz State Historical Museum or the M. V. Frunze Museum. The national public broadcasting service KTRK or Kyrgyz Television is based in Bishkek. Newspapers in Bishkek include the English-language Bishkek Observer, the world's only dungan-language newspaper called Huimin bao and the Russian-language Vecherniy Bishkek newspaper.\n\nReligion\n\n[edit]\n\nThe largest religion is Sunni Islam, but since many Russians live in Kyrgyzstan, there is also a large Russian Orthodox community. The Bishkek Central Mosque is one of the largest in Central Asia. Bishkek is home to the Roman Catholic Apostolic Administration of Kyrgyzstan.\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nBishkek is home to Dolen Omurzakov Stadium, the largest football stadium in Kyrgyzstan and the only one eligible to host international matches.[49] Several Bishkek-based football teams play on this pitch, including six-time Kyrgyzstan League champions, Dordoi Bishkek. Others include Alga Bishkek, Ilbirs Bishkek, and RUOR-Guardia Bishkek.\n\nBishkek hosted the 2014 IIHF Challenge Cup of Asia – Division I.\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nEducational institutions in Bishkek include:\n\nAPAP KR\n\nAmerican University of Central Asia\n\nArabaev Kyrgyz State University[50]\n\nBishkek Humanities University\n\nInternational Atatürk-Alatoo University[51]\n\nInternational University of Kyrgyzstan[52]\n\nKyrgyz International University NRZ\n\nKyrgyz-Russian Slavic University[53]\n\nI.K. Akhunbaev Kyrgyz State Medical Academy\n\nKyrgyz State National University[54]\n\nKyrgyz Technical University\n\nKyrgyz-Russian State University\n\nKyrgyz-Turkish Manas University[55]\n\nKyrgyz Uzbek University\n\nPlato University of Management and Design[56]\n\nUniversity of Central Asia[57]\n\nIn addition, the following international schools serve the expatriate community in Bishkek:\n\nEuropean School in Central Asia[58]\n\nOxford International School Bishkek[59]\n\nHope Academy of Bishkek[60]\n\nQSI International School of Bishkek[61]\n\nSilk Road International School[62]\n\nTransportation\n\n[edit]\n\nMass public transport\n\n[edit]\n\nPublic transportation includes buses, electric trolleybuses, and public vans (known in Russian as marshrutka). The first bus and trolley bus services in Bishkek were introduced in 1934 and 1951, respectively.[63]\n\nTaxi cabs can be found throughout the city.\n\nThe city is considering designing and building a light rail system.\n\nCommuter and long-distance buses\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are two main bus stations in Bishkek. The smaller old Eastern Bus Station is primarily the terminal for minibusses to various destinations within or just beyond the eastern suburbs, such as Kant, Tokmok, Kemin, Issyk Ata, or the Korday border crossing.\n\nLong-distance regular bus and minibus services to all parts of the country, as well as to Almaty (the largest city in neighbouring Kazakhstan) and Kashgar, China, run mostly from the newer grand Western Bus Station; only a smaller number run from the Eastern Station.\n\nThe Dordoy Bazaar on the north-eastern outskirts of the city also contains makeshift terminals for frequent minibusses to suburban towns in all directions (from Sokuluk in the west to Tokmak in the east) and to some buses taking traders to Kazakhstan and Siberia.\n\nRail\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2007 , the Bishkek-2 railway station sees only a few trains a day. It offers a popular three-day train service from Bishkek to Moscow.\n\nThere are also long-distance trains that leave for Siberia (Novosibirsk and Novokuznetsk), via Almaty, over the TurkSib route, and to Yekaterinburg (Sverdlovsk) in the Urals, via Astana. These services are remarkably slow (over 48 hours to Yekaterinburg), due to long stops at the border and the indirect route (the trains first have to go west for more than a 100 kilometres (62 mi) before they enter the main TurkSib line and can continue to the east or north). For example, as of the fall of 2008, train No. 305 Bishkek-Yekaterinburg was scheduled to take 11 hours to reach the Shu junction—a distance of some 269 kilometres (167 mi) by rail, and less than half of that by road.[64]\n\nAir\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city is served by Manas International Airport (IATA code FRU), located approximately 25 kilometres (16 mi) north-west of the city centre.\n\nIn 2001, the United States obtained the right to use Manas International Airport as an air base for its military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.[65] Russia subsequently (2003) established an airbase of its own (Kant Air Base) near Kant, some 20 kilometres (12 mi) east of Bishkek. It is based at a facility that used to be home to a major Soviet military pilot training school; one of its students, Hosni Mubarak, later became president of Egypt.\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nTalant Dujshebaev (born 1968), handball coach and former handball player (voted 2nd IHF World Player of the Century)\n\nRoza Isakovna Otunbayeva (born 1950), third president of Kyrgyzstan\n\nChinghiz Aitmatov (1928-2008), writer\n\nTugelbay Sydykbekov (1912–1997), writer\n\nMikhail Frunze (1885–1925), after whom the city was named from 1926 to 1991\n\nNasirdin Isanov (1943–1991), first prime minister of Kyrgyzstan\n\nSergei B.
