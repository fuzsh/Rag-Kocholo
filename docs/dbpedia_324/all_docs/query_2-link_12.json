        "text": "Discussion\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first time that data on the presentation of SLE and on standard of care have been made available for these post-Soviet countries. The demographic characteristics of patients with SLE in the current study were generally similar to those reported in the other international studies,20–25 but it was noted that our patients were 4–10 years younger in the study and had 3–7 years shorter SLE duration than those from a recent European retrospective study, The LUpus erythematosus Cost of Illness in Europe study (LUCIE).11\n\nAcross the three countries, the majority of patients had severe disease, according to our study definitions. SELENA-SLEDAI and SDI scores were reconstructed based on retrospective medical records and/or investigator's judgement. In Russia and Ukraine, the mean total SELENA-SLEDAI score decreased between diagnosis and last study visit in 2010, although this change was less than three points. SLE activity, measured by classification of Nasonova, decreased across all countries from the time of diagnosis to the last visit in 2010. These results could reflect either a natural change in the disease pathophysiology over time with an actual reduction in inflammatory activity later in the disease course or they could be the result of successful disease management strategies that stabilised patients who presented in an acute disease state. The mean total SELENA-SLEDAI score correlated with Nasonova's scale assessment, suggesting that these two systems could be capturing similar information. SDI scores increased over time as expected,18 as patients accrued new organ damage over time. The country with the highest organ damage scores doses reported the highest glucocorticoid use.\n\nThe levels of disease activity observed in our study were higher than those detected in SLE cohort studies from Western Europe and North America.26 In the LUCIE study,11 the mean SELENA-SLEDAI score at the inclusion in the study was 11.2 (SD 7.7) in patients with severe disease (vs 5.3 (SD 3.9) in those without severe disease). The mean SDI score was 1.0 in those with severe disease vs 0.7 in those with non-severe disease. In the SLICC inception cohort, the mean SLEDAI-2K score (another variation of the SLEDAI score27) reported was 4.0 (SD 5.3).28 Levels of organ damage were also elevated relative to other international settings. Mean SDI scores were >1 at diagnosis across all study countries, indicating that most patients had suffered some organ damage prior to diagnosis. By comparison, the mean SDI score reported in the SLICC inception cohort was 0.32 (SD 0.76).28 One of the reasons for such difference may be the fact that in our study countries patients visit specialised clinics predominantly due to active disease. Therefore, the great majority of the patients seemed to be evaluated during an active stage of the disease. High-disease activity in our patients is confirmed by frequent hospitalisations and emergency room visits (in >90% of patients) and unplanned visits due to flare (in up to 75% of patients). In Ukraine and Kazakhstan, the proportion of patients with an unplanned visit was higher than that with planned visits. Probably, the high level of SLE activity compared with that in Europe could be a result of the singular type of healthcare system in our study countries where patients are treated mostly during flares rather than having regular follow-up. These points indicate the need for reassessing the healthcare system to be more preventive rather than treating patients who show a high level of activity/disease severity.\n\nThe SLEDAI and SDI scoring systems are not used widely in our study countries, and the scores created retrospectively must be interpreted with caution. However, the implication of our results is that patients in our study countries who present to secondary care for diagnosis and management are those with advanced and severe manifestations of SLE. It is likely, then, that a large number of patients may remain undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. This also may explain the low prevalence of (diagnosed) SLE that was reported in an earlier publication from this study.12\n\nThis study also highlighted some differences in the clinical characteristics of patients with SLE between the participating countries. For example, it was noted that in Kazakhstan SLE activity at diagnosis was higher than in Russia or Ukraine (mean SELENA-SLEDAI score 18.6 vs 16.6 in Russia and 9.4 in Ukraine and the highest proportion of patients with high grade activity of inflammation as per the Nasonova criteria). Further studies should explore the survival rate of patients in different countries. Similarly, in Kazakhstan there was a higher burden of organ damage at diagnosis (SDI score 2.0 vs 1.2 in Russia and 1.1 in Ukraine). These differences could reflect differences in healthcare access and referral patterns or could be related to a difference in biological risk associated with Asian race/ethnicity. Furthermore, in Kazakhstan, SLE activity measured by the SELENA-SLEDAI score slightly increased between diagnosis and last visit in 2010. However, as such increase was only 0.8 points, it cannot be clearly interpreted as worsening of SLE activity in this country.\n\nThe study illustrated SLE treatment standards. Biological therapy in SLE was prescribed quite rarely. Almost all patients received glucocorticoids and at an average daily dose that was high relative to the doses reported in Western European settings,3 29 30 but not dissimilar to the doses reported in the international SLICC inception cohort.31 Almost half of the patients received antimalarial drugs, immunosuppressants and/or cytotoxic drugs.\n\nMore than 90% of patients had at least one inpatient (including emergency room) hospitalisation during the study period. In Kazakhstan and Ukraine, >70% of patients made unscheduled rheumatologist visits due to flare in 2010; such unscheduled visits were less frequent in Russia. In the LUCIE study, 54% of patients with severe disease were admitted to hospital over the course of a 1-year period.11 Use of inpatient facilities in our study appears to be high relative to reports of use in other countries, again supporting the assumption that these are patients presenting with severe and acute disease manifestations that require more intensive treatment and supportive care, although a lower threshold for hospital admission cannot be ruled out.\n\nSome indicators of suboptimal SLE management were found in these post-Soviet countries. As mentioned above, antimalarial drugs (hydroxychloroquine), which are a part of standard SLE treatment, were administered in less than half of patients while high use of glucocorticoids (near 100% patients) was observed across these countries (a drug class with well-known long-term safety issues). NSAIDs were administered rarely in Russia. Another peculiarity was a large number of inpatient stays due to SLE while the rate of planned visits to specialists’ outpatient consultations was lower.\n\nThe ESSENCE study has some limitations. Patients’ clinical characteristics were assessed retrospectively based only on medical records. The SDI and SELENA/SLEDAI scores were applied retrospectively based on medical record information; given that these scoring systems are not widely used in routine practice in our study geography, some possibility of scoring system application error exists. Furthermore, an influence of missing or incomplete medical information on the total score cannot be excluded. The scores were only calculated when complete information was available in the chart and patients who had available information may not be representative of the entire study population.\n\nThe potential for disease progression during the 1-year follow-up period was not measured. In addition, the 1-year study duration did not allow for capture of damage accrual over time and the long-term effects of the disease and medications.\n\nIn conclusion, the ESSENCE study provides a reliable insight into the SLE clinical profiles in the three post-Soviet study countries. The study results add to the global clinical picture of SLE, highlighting the differences in patient presentation across regions. This study information could also help in planning for healthcare resource use in these countries, hopefully leading to an improvement in SLE management."
