Not an everyday occurrence: The Russian army band performing at a Chanukah celebration participated by 6,000 Jews, enduring temperatures of 30 degrees below zero, in a massive Chanukah celebration, probably the largest in the world.

For 27 years straight, the Chief Rabbi and Chabad emissaries in Yekaterinburg, Rabbi Zelig Ashkenazi and his wife Mrs. Chana, have been organizing a large Chanukah event with the participation of thousands of Jews. This year, they set a new record with 6,000 participants, likely earning the title of ‘the world’s largest Chanukah party.’

The guest of honor at the event was Russia’s Chief Rabbi, Rabbi Berel Lazar, who attended along with the CEO of the Federation of Jewish Communities (FJC) Rabbi David Mondshine. He delivered words of Torah and blessings and was honored with lighting the Chanukah menorah. The young emissary Moishy Ashkenazi, moved the audience with the song ‘Hanerot Halalu.’

The region’s governor, Mr. Yevgeny Kuyvashev, was honored with lighting the ‘Shamash’ and delivered words of blessing and gratitude to the Jewish community. Later, the mayor of Yekaterinburg, Mr. Alexei Orlov, also addressed the gathering.

Yekaterinburg has been experiencing severe cold for a week, reaching a peak of 44 degrees below zero. During the event, the temperature was close to 30 degrees below zero, yet 6,000 Jews participated in the Chanukah celebration.

Yekaterinburg is considered the third largest city in Russia after Moscow and Petersburg. It is the capital of the Ural region, situated in the center of Russia, on the border between the European and Asian continents.
