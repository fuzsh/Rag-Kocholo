H. P. Lovecraft's birthplace of 454 Angell Street (formerly numbered 194) stood here on the right behind the Stop sign and political banner until it was demolished in 1961.

Lovecraft lived here from his birth on 20-August-1890, until the family fortunes failed in 1904 after the death of his grandfather Whipple Phillips, and he and his mother had to move to rooms in 598 Angell Street.

The original home on this corner would have looked much like the first home on the left in this picture; which is at 453 Angell Street.

During Lovecraft's fourteen years at this location, he wrote his first fiction, poetry, and began writing "The Rhode Island Journal of Astronomy".
