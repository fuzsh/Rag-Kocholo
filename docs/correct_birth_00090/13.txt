Background

Howard Phillips Lovecraft, popularly known as H.P. Lovecraft, was born in Providence, Rhode Island. His mother, Susan Phillips, was not so much a good parental figure to him; she lacked affection and would call her son “hideous.” His father, Winfield Scott Lovecraft, was a traveling salesman who later passed away due to a mental disorder caused by untreated syphilis. Lovecraft was an only child and grew up under the influence and guidance of his grandfather, Whipple Van Buren Phillips, after the passing of his father.

Lovecraft started writing as a child and later attended Hope High School, where he eventually dropped out due to a nervous breakdown and financial issues. He published several articles and an amateur scientific journal. Lovecraft became a member of the United Amateur Press Association in 1914. Later in 1917, he became serious about writing stories after being influenced by the works of his favorite writers Edgar Allan Poe and Lord Dunsany. In 1921, his mother passed away, and Lovecraft suffered a nervous breakdown again but was able to come out of it and continued writing and attending amateur writing conventions. In 1928 he published the famously known story “The Call of Cthulhu,” which introduced readers to supernatural beings that would devastate humankind.

He met his wife, Siona Greene, in 1921, and they married in 1924. They later divorced in 1926, but the divorce wasn’t finalized on paper, so they remained legally married. Greene was an independent businesswoman and supported Lovecraft financially when they were together.
