        "text": "July 8, 2019\n\nThis is the history of one of the most notorious fictive books ever. I especially liked the reference to the Pickman family (you can read Lovecraft's story Pickman's Model) and the interesting rumours on Abdul Alhazred's death. Very creepy, very informative and with absolutely cult status. You have to check your local library for an edition. Absolutely recommended for every traveler in the Lovecraft universe!\n\nRead\n\nApril 3, 2019\n\nThis book was banned by Pope Gregory IX in 1232, shortly after its Latin translation, which called attention to it.\n\nI guess Gregory hadn't heard that all publicity is good publicity.\n\nIt was from rumors of this book (of which relatively few of the general public know) that R.W. Chambers is said to have derived the idea of his early novel The King in Yellow.\n\nHeh. I wonder if Chambers would have been amused this playful revisionism? I think he had passed away before this was published.\n\nLovecraft and friends really put a lot of detail into their made-up texts; one can see why many contemporary readers thought the Necronomicon was a real book.\n\nSeptember 6, 2015\n\nA complete history of the dreaded Necronomicon, its Greek and Latin translations. I can't ignore how important the book is for so many Lovecraft's stories so the rating reflects that fact.\n\nAugust 28, 2017\n\nPer the title it's short and sweet.\n\nOVERALL GRADE: B minus.\n\nAugust 3, 2018\n\nA concise history of Lovecraft's fictional book the Necronomicon. Made to exclusively suppliment the references of the text within the main stories.\n\nJanuary 25, 2019\n\nCool little fictional history of one of the most notorious imaginary books. I wish I could have a copy.\n\nMarch 6, 2022\n\nEste \"cuento\" en realidad es una nota de pie de pagina de los otros libros de Lovecraft que mencionan el necronomicon\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\nFascinating reading, and can see the importance of it in the grand scheme of cosmic horror.\n\nMarch 14, 2016\n\nRecommendable only to the most avid fans of Lovecraftian literature, and not anyone else. I am Lovecraft fan myself, but I did not enjoy reading this.\n\nJune 5, 2019\n\nThis is a cute little work of H.P. Lovecraft where he relates the origin and history of the fictional book which holds such a prominent position in the majority of his stories.\n\nJune 25, 2022\n\nRating 70\n\nIt's pretty cool that Lovecraft describes the history of a fictional book pretty realistically but being only two pages it's pretty short. Kinda hard rating this tbh.\n\nJune 11, 2024\n\nFULL REVIEW ON MY WEBSITE\n\nhttps://thebookcornerchronicles.com/2...\n\nBefore getting into this short story I thought that I wouldn’t like it because of the theme of this short story. But after reading it, I need to say that I loved it.\n\nThe writing style is so amazing in this one, and it screams that H.P Lovecraft wrote it and I love that. The writing style really had build the atmosphere in this one because it was so good.\n\nThe plot itself here isn’t really my type what I’ve enjoyed it enough to give it 4 stars. I wasn’t the biggest fan of the plot but I still appreciate it and found it interesting.\n\nFor the most part this short story is nothing more than just a cute little short story with an eerie vibe in it.\n\nDecember 29, 2022\n\nQuite remarkable that a work of fiction can ascend to the common mythos. As a younger man who didn't know much about H.P. Lovecraft I thought that the necronomicon was perhaps a real book. I'm sure there are many that have this perception as well. It may be his most successful creation in the zeitgeist, even more so than Cthulhu.\n\nThere are many historical references in this short work, giving it immersion.\n\nJune 15, 2022\n\nОдна из самых удачных литературных мистификаций без какого-либо желания автора запустить таковую. Лавкрафт запустил в народ идею книги-кторой-нет и она там здорово укоренилась, так что неизвестно сколько людей считает, что это реальная книга. Или даже, что Говард имел в руках настоящий \"Некрономикон\", но выдавал всё это за фантазию.\n\nAugust 11, 2022\n\nécouté ici en français : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHZVy...\n\nPure kiff pour les bibliophiles sur cette histoire technique précise mais fantasmée d'un livre maudit, soumis à la censure de l'ensemble des clergés, de ses rumeurs de circulation clandestine, qui entretient la richesse du mythe entier des Anciens et de leur culte persistant à travers les âges.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nDecember 10, 2023\n\nLa historia del Necronomicón es una historia corta escrita por H.P. Lovecraft.\n\nLa historia es interesante y realmente la puedes leer en 5 minutos. Si bien no es particularmente elaborada, diría que es lectura obligada tomando en cuenta que ha sido punto de partida para muchas otras historias y libros, tanto del mismo H. P. Lovecraft como de otros autores.\n\nFebruary 23, 2024\n\n\"He was only an indifferent Moslem, worshipping unknown entities whom he called Yog-Sothoth and Cthulhu.\"\n\nThis was a good little primer on the fictional history of Lovecraft's Necronomicon. There were some decent little details here and a few key references to his other works too.\n\nI look forward to seeing what this book within a book is capable of, for my sins.\n\nMay 24, 2021\n\nThe only part I didn't find satisfying in the story of the mad Arab who wrote the Necronomicon is how he was reportedly eaten alive by a creature in public. Thats really stupid and when I imagine that it just looks really dumb but everything else was cool.\n\nJanuary 11, 2021\n\nMostly just noting I read it... I enjoyed all 5 mintes of it.\n\nApril 4, 2021\n\nJust a very brief very simple piece of flash fiction. Has so good world building for Cthulhu Mythos. No characters or plot.\n\nOctober 6, 2021\n\nA brief history of the allegedly fictitious Necronomicon. Of most interest were the (unsurprising) links to Salem and The King and Yellow. Definitely a springboard for further research, just not particularly useful or interesting as it stands.\n\nDecember 31, 2021\n\nMêlant allègrement réalité et fiction, Lovecraft brouille les pistes et épaissit le mythe qu’il a lui-même créé, le Necronomicon apparaissant dans de nombreux textes de l’auteur, mais aussi d’autres"
