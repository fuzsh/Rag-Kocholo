        "text": "Last month, Gov. Gina Raimondo signed an executive order removing “Providence Plantations” from the official name of the state on government communications, documents and websites. Although “plantation” referred to a settlement or colony when Roger Williams established Providence in 1636, Americans today strongly associate the word with slavery.\n\nThat, however, may be the easiest call the state will make.\n\nA statue in Rhode Island raises the uncomfortable question of how we treat great artists who were racists. The immediate example is the state’s native son— horror writer H.P. Lovecraft.\n\nIn 2015, the Providence-based Lovecraft Arts & Sciences Council began fundraising to commission a Lovecraft statue, and Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza and the city government authorized a five-year installation. Local artist Gage Prentiss designed the monument and unveiled it at an art exhibit at the Providence Art Club in 2019. Presently, the statue sits in Prentiss’s yard, awaiting a permanent home.\n\nIn recent years, Lovecraft has enjoyed a renaissance which he never experienced during his own time. Born in 1890, Lovecraft resided in Providence during most of his life and he died in the city in 1937. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, he wrote for pulp magazines, fashioning a new sub-genre, a blend of horror, myth and sci-fi called weird fiction. Today, Lovecraft stands as the successor to Edgar Allan Poe in the American literary pantheon. His stamp can be seen throughout contemporary popular culture, including the Netflix hit “Stranger Things” and — no surprise — Jordan Peele’s forthcoming HBO production “Lovecraft Country.”\n\nThe problem is that Lovecraft was also an unreformed racist and bigot.\n\nAs Lovecraft’s posthumous reputation has grown, this ugly aspect of his character has become difficult to ignore or gloss over. A facile response might be to excuse Lovecraft as simply a product of his time. Anti-immigration sentiment was rife in America. Polite white society believed that Blacks and other minorities were inferior. Racial and ethnic stereotypes were prevalent in advertising and entertainment. Unfortunately, Lovecraft’s personal letters reveal that his beliefs were extreme even for interwar America.\n\nWriting to his aunt from New York City in 1925, Lovecraft complained about the city’s large Jewish population. He recalled fantasizing about murdering “a score or two jammed in a N.Y. subway train.” In the same letter, Lovecraft rattled off disparaging remarks about Italians, Portuguese, French-Canadians, Catholics, Poles, Mexicans, indigenous Americans and the Irish. This tirade was not unusual.\n\nKnowing all this, does Lovecraft still merit a public monument in Providence?\n\nNiels-Viggo Hobbs, the executive director of the Lovecraft Arts & Sciences Council, believes that “there is a place for a Lovecraft statue that more venerates his creations than it does him as a deeply flawed person.” Hobbs lists a small sample of creatives — “Jorge Luis Borges, Junji Ito, Guillermo del Toro, H.R. Giger, Stephen King” — shaped by Lovecraft as evidence of his artistic importance.\n\nPrentiss describes how Lovecraft’s fiction continues to create a far-flung and diverse network of fans. “His work has formed a positive and close community of people from all genders, races, ages, nationalities and creeds.” Both Hobbs and Prentiss emphasize Lovecraft’s central place in Providence’s cultural history. People visit Providence because of its association with Lovecraft, and tourists regularly contact Prentiss to see his statue.\n\nHowever, Lovecraft’s racism leaves deep reservations in both men, especially considering the 2016 election, Black Lives Matter, and the killing of George Floyd. Both believe that the Lovecraft monument should be displayed on private — not public — land. Hobbs does not predict even that happening without community dialogue and listening to “all parties and voices.”\n\nWe commemorate creative figures — our artists, writers, and musicians — for their work, not their deeds or belief systems. Likewise, creatives seldom carry power or influence over the events of their day. These are crucial differences between an H.P. Lovecraft and a Robert E. Lee. A monument to Lovecraft — with a well-thought contextual description — might provide Providence and other communities with one model for discussing their painful pasts and their own controversial cultural icons.\n\nDavid J. Goodwin is an author and the assistant director of the Fordham University Center on Religion and Culture. He is writing a book on H.P. Lovecraft."
