        "text": "Howard Phillips Lovecraft (August 20, 1890 â€“ March 15, 1937) was an American writer of fantasy, horror and science fiction.\n\nHe wrote many scary short stories. These often were about odd creatures that Lovecraft made up by himself or with his friends, including August Derleth, who wrote mysteries. The creatures did not really care about human people at all, so they were not out to hurt people, but if they did, they did not care. They looked at us like we would be ants. Their behaviour, attitude and look also tended to make people go crazy.\n\nOne of his most famous creations was Cthulhu, a giant and powerful alien being that some humans worship as a god. He also made up many other strange alien gods, like Yog-Sothoth, Nyarlathotep, and Azathoth. Together his works and ideas about these characters are called the Cthulhu Mythos.\n\nLovecraft's stories were inspiration for lots of other writers.The spirit of his works, presenting a world that does not care, is present in many works of fiction.\n\nLovecraft was born in Providence, Rhode Island on August 20, 1890. He was the only child in the family. He died of small intestine cancer there.\n\nWorks related to H. P. Lovecraft at Wikisource"
