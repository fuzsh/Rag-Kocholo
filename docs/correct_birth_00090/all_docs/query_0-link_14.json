        "text": "Halloween brings a wealth of travel stories about \"spooky\" destinations and haunted houses all over the world.\n\nBut for fans of the horror/science fiction giant, H. P. Lovecraft, there can be no scarier, cooler city than Providence, Rhode Island, home of Lovecraft for most of his life and his final resting place.\n\nLovecraft, who died in 1937, has experienced a major surge in popularity in the past ten years, helped by film giant Guillermo del Toro's avowed fascination with Lovecraft as well as by Providence hosting of the bi-ennial Necronomicon Convention--a celebration of all things Lovecraft-related.\n\nLovecraft minions first stop on a Providence pilgrimage must be Providence's Arcade, a beautiful covered shopping center built in mid-Victorian times and home to the Lovecraft Arts and Sciences Shop, a haven of books and novelties about Howard Phillips Lovecraft. The shop's owners and staff sponsor the Necronomicon Convention every other year and are a mine of information on any and all things Cthulhu--the name of a major deity of the pantheon of uber gods that Lovecraft inspired.\n\nIndeed the Cthulhu cult is so pervasive that you can find plush Cthulhu dolls (cute little demons with a mouth full of tentacles) as well as children's books on the topic.\n\nNext you must visit Providence's haunting and possibly haunted Providence Athen√¶um, the fourth oldest library in the country where Lovecraft hero, Edgar Allan Poe met and courted one of his unattainable idols, Sarah Helen Whitman (unsuccessfully). Poe as well as Lovecraft had a soft spot for this old world library. There are displays of both authors memorabilia that make the trip worthwhile for horror fans and books by both of the authors on the time-honored shelves.\n\nA visit to Providence's Swan Point Cemetery, where Lovecraft is buried is de rigeur for any and all who anticipate the return of The Old Ones, the god creatures Lovecraft brought to life in his short stories and novellas (or of H.P. himself). The 1846 640-acre cemetery is home to a simple grave that states, \"I am Providence.\" (Lovecraft had a lifelong love for his hometown--a love that lasted beyond the grave). The granite stone is often ornamented with offerings like little Cthulhu ornaments, the multi-tentacled entities that Lovecraft launched into the world and who have attained a viral life of their own.\n\nFinally, Lovecraft fans should visit the city's storefront NAZO LAB where the international performance group of visual artists, puppet performers, and masked musicians \"create bizarre and hilarious larger-than-life sized characters, environments, and spectacles,\" many of them with Lovecraftian creatures with multiple eyes and squid-like appendages.\n\nThese creatures are also on display every year during Providence's PVDFest--a days long festival of \"The Creative Capital's\" best and brightest design, performance and other creative arts."
