        "text": "Looking to change things up a bit with your Lovecraft reading? Think you have read everything Lovecraft has to offer? Just feel like reading some good poetry? The Ancient Track: The Complete Poetical Works of H.P. Lovecraft might just be what you are looking for. But don’t take it from me… Here is what Hippocampus Press has to say about it.\n\n“The publication in 2001 of The Ancient Track: The Complete Poetical Works of H. P. Lovecraft was a landmark. For the first time, all of Lovecraft’s 500 or more poems—including hundreds of Christmas greetings, untitled poems, fragments, and poems embedded in his published and unpublished letters—were gathered in accurate texts, with critical commentary and full bibliography.”\n\nI currently own the first edition of this work but plan to get the revised second edition very soon. You can order your copy from Hippocampus Press using the following link…\n\nwww.hippocampuspress.com\n\nWhat better place to celebrate the life and work of H.P. Lovecraft than in his home town of Providence? What better way to celebrate than with hundreds if not thousands of his fans all gathered together in one place for 3 days of cosmic horror. Be sure to visit the NecronomiCon website and sign up for the newsletter or follow them on social media… www.necronomicon-providence.com\n\nThe cloudless day is richer at its close;\n\nA golden glory settles on the lea;\n\nSoft, stealing shadows hint of cool repose\n\nTo mellowing landscape, and to calming sea.\n\nAnd in that nobler, gentler, lovelier light,\n\nThe soul to sweeter, loftier bliss inclines;\n\nFreed form the noonday glare, the favour’d sight\n\nIncreasing grace in earth and sky divines.\n\nBut ere the purest radiance crowns the green,\n\nOr fairest lustre fills th’ expectant grove,\n\nThe twilight thickens, and the fleeting scene\n\nLeaves but a hallow’d memory of love!\n\nHappy Birthday – Grandpa Howard\n\n124 years ago today, H.P. Lovecraft was born in Providence Rhode Island. (August 20th, 1890) During his lifetime H.P.L. knew only limited success as a writer. Today 124 years later he is considered one of the most important and influential horror writers of the 20th century.\n\nI can only guess at what HPL would think about having his name spoken in the same breath as his hero Poe. I imagine he would act like a gentleman and deny his importance or even make fun of his own fame. But part of me would like to believe that deep down inside it would give him some unspoken joy and satisfaction.\n\nHappy Birthday “Old Man” and thank you for everything!\n\n~ Clinthulhu"
