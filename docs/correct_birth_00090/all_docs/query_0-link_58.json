        "text": "This original Rhode Island design is a send up to HP LOVECRAFT. Lovecraft was an American writer of weird and horror fiction, born in Providence Rhode Island. He is best known for creating the CTHULU, a Kraken like creature that emerges from the ocean depths during an apocalyptic age. The design depicts the CTHULU coming out of the Providence river and enveloping the Providence Power Building. “Weird since 1636” refers to the date when Providence was founded. This is destined to be your favorite HP Lovecraft and Providence themed mug.\n\nWhite ceramic mug (15 oz. )\n\nOriginal design and dishwasher safe.\n\nProduced in Rhode Island"
