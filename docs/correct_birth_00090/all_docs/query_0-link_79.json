        "text": "Belated birthday to one of my favorite writers HP LOVECRAFT.\n\n(Definitely NOT one of my favorite people.)\n\nIf anyone's interested...\n\nMORE INFO HERE\n\n18”x24\" and printed with GLOW IN THE DARK ink!!!\n\nScreen Print Artist Edition of 50\n\nSigned & Numbered\n\nPrinted on Reich Metallic paper!\n\nHoward Phillips Lovecraft was born August 20, 1890 (died March 15, 1937) was an American writer of weird fiction and horror fiction, who is known for his creation of what became the #CthulhuMythos. Born in Providence, Rhode Island, Lovecraft spent most of his life in New England.\n\nHere’s an animation I made for the GID HP Lovecraft print I released last November.\n\nThe idea to do the Lovecraft portrait came about when I was commissioned to do the poster for Metallica’s show in Oslo, Norway. A week after getting the job I was at Metallica’s show in Cincinnati (back in January of 2019) and Kirk Hammett invited us backstage and asked what I was working on. I was so excited to tell him my idea. He approved. I probably peed myself a bit.\n\nI changed the METALLICA lyrics from one of the greatest songs by the band - The Thing That Should Not Be back to the original quote from Lovecraft’s story - The Nameless City for this art print!!\n\n\"That is not dead which can eternal lie. And with strange aeons even death may die.\"\n\nI hafta admit I like Call of Cthulu but I always go back to The Shadow Over Innsmouth as my favorite. If I ever get the time I would love to illustrate that story.\n\nSome of my other favorites of his are definitely\n\n• The Nameless City\n\n• The Whisperer in Darkness\n\n• The Shadow Out Of Time\n\nWhat are your favorites?\n\nHas anyone caught LOVECRAFT COUNTRY yet?!?!\n\nIt's AMAZING!!!"
