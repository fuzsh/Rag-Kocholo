        "text": "122 years ago today, one of the big three American horror writers was born. Howard Phillips Lovecraft was born in Providence, Rhode Island on August 20, 1890. He lived for 47 years producing his highly original and influential horror stories and sharing them with other writers via the American amateur author network that was so popular in the early 1900’s.\n\nThe “big three American horror writers” began with Edgar Allan Poe, followed by H.P. Lovecraft, and finally Stephen King. King has acknowledged that Lovecraft was responsible for his interest in writing horror and the macabre. If you’ve never read any Lovecraft, he has a completely unique and identifiable style that you’ll never see anywhere else.\n\nLovecraft became my favorite author about 25 years ago when I picked up his long-story/short-novel “At the Mountains of Madness.” He was a prolific letter writer, poet, and of course a pioneer of horror fiction. If your a fan of horror fiction and have never read Lovecraft, you owe it to yourself to check him out. You might get hooked for life like me :-)\n\nFor more info check out: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Lovecraft\n\nImage Attachments\n\nSorry my friend, I’m not a puppet nor am I Chas. So what is your purpose? Are you to take issue with me now as well? Have you nowhere else to cause trouble and betray your lack of accepted human behavior? Accusing me of being someone else? You succeeded in your mission for his removal. Job well done! Played him real well as any first year psych student could. Wasn’t too hard to set him off with that short fuse of his, was it? Funny how you didn’t have a problem with him posting when it interested you though. You had no problem replying then.\n\nYeah, I liked his posts as many did and some did not. Suggestion: don’t read them. Wow, who knew? The quality of a day in my life is not determined by what you, he, or anyone else posts here. Do you know him? His story? Why he posted how he did? Nope, nope, and nope. Ya never know. Kinda like when Phil was short with a dude who didn’t know the difference between a 0 and an O. Then Vikas pointed out he was blind working with a voice translator. Everybody’s got their thing and it’s abusive self-centered chumps like you that fail to take the time to realize that. I’m sure you’ve got a story too, but sadly I could care less to hear it. I feel sorry for you. Good Luck.\n\nStone or anybody else you think I may be.\n\nPatchChord - 20 August 2012 11:19 PM\n\nNo confusion. Any H.P. Lovecraft recommendations?\n\nDefinitely…\n\nNovellas: The Shadow Over Innsmouth, At the Mountains of Madness (these are probably my 2 favorites and either one is a great starting point)\n\nNovels: The Case of Charles Dexter Ward\n\nShort stories: The Festival, The Picture in the House, The Rats in the Walls, The Doom that Came to Sarnath, Nyarlathotep\n\nPoems: Nathicana\n\nOne of the coolest things about Lovecraft is he defines a collection of places (Miskatonic University, Arkham, Innsmouth) ancient books (The Necronomicon) evil beings (Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep, Yog-Sothoth) and uses them interchangeably in his stories. This is defined as the “Cthulhu Mythos.” The only types of stories that I would recommend you stay away from (at least while starting out) are his “Dream Mythos” works like “The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath” and “The Statement of Randolph Carter” as they can get a little tedious.\n\nI’ve used Lovecraft’s stories as the basis for several of my best musical compositions. He presents such a unique atmosphere that it naturally lends itself to musical interpretation.\n\nI’m happy to answer any other Lovecraft questions that arise! If I could turn someone else on to HPL, I’d have done my cosmic job :-)\n\nImage Attachments\n\nstoneb3 - 20 August 2012 11:05 PM\n\nWell Patch it seems as though you have confused Mutiny with someone else?\n\nExcellent reading Mutiny. Thanks, hope the birthday went well.\n\nThanks Stone, ya my BDay on the 16th and Lovecraft’s on the 20th were both great days :-)\n\nThere are actually a few famous deaths that happened on my BDay 8/16. Babe Ruth died 8/16/48, Bela Lugosi died 8/16/56, Elvis died 8/16/77. I wish two events that were close had happened on 8/16 too...of course Lovecraft’s BDay on the 20th and the death of Lorenzo Da Ponti on the 17th. For those who aren’t familiar with him, Da Ponti was the writer of the librettos for Mozart’s big three operas, Don Giovanni, The Marriage of Figaro, & Cosi fan tutte.\n\nstoneb3 - 21 August 2012 02:23 AM\n\nFor those not in the know Patchchord has accused myself and Mutiny of being surrogates for Redhotpoker who was removed from the the forum last week.\n\nI just noticed after reading this post of yours that Redhotpoker has actually been removed from Motifator. This is a really sad news.\n\nI do think he is a very good person and although I’ve not seen the posts due to which he was removed, I’m sure he must have reacted like that only under provocation. I think he should be given a fair chance perhaps with some warning not to post unacceptable content.\n\nThat said, I do know for sure that stoneb3 and Mutiny in Jonestown are genuine forum members different from Redhotpoker :-) .\n\nTake it easy, guys!"
