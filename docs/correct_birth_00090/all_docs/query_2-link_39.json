Lovecraft Birthplace - Providence, Rhode Island USA\n\nin Childhood Homes\n\nPosted by: 401Photos\n\nN 41° 49.798 W 071° 23.368\n\n19T E 301577 N 4633658\n\nA polished black granite post with an etched steel plaque marks the birthplace and childhood home of H.P. Lovecraft, father of Weird Fiction.\n\nWaymark Code: WM10181\n\nLocation: Rhode Island, United States\n\nPublished By: kaschper69\n\nViews: 4\n\nBorn on March 15, 1890 in Providence, Rhode Island, H.P. [Howard Phillips] Lovecraft, posthumously became known as the originator of Weird Fiction -- a unique blend of horror, science fiction, and fantasy. Today, H.P. Lovecraft is internationally celebrated and studied. This marker is the result of a Kickstarter campaign and was officially unveiled March 15, 2016, on the 78th anniversary of his death.\n\nHis childhood home at 454 Angell Street no longer exists, so this spot has only the marker to note the historical significance within the lively Wayland Square neighborhood. There is now an unremarkable, three-floor, red brick apartment building on the corner of Elmgrove Avenue by the marker.\n\nFrom Guide to Lovecraftian Sites in Rhode Island:\n\n\"I was born on the 20th of August, 1890, at No. 454 (then numbered 194) Angell Street, in the city of Providence. This was the home of my mother’s family; my parents’ actual residence at the time being in Dorchester, Mass....In the mid-seventies, my grandfather transferred all his interests to Providence (where his offices had always been) & erected one of the handsomest residences in the city—to me, the handsomest—my own beloved birthplace! This spacious house, raised on a high green terrace, looks down upon grounds which are almost a park, with winding walks, arbours, trees, & a delightful fountain. (Letter to Reinhardt Kleiner, 16 November 1916)\n\nThe Lovecrafts lived here from 1893 through 1904, when Howard’s grandfather, Whipple Phillips, died. Lovecraft loved this building and hoped to someday have enough personal wealth to acquire it. It was, unfortunately, torn down in 1961.\"\n\nSources:\n\nH.P.
