        "text": "Howard Phillips Lovecraft was a wildly famous author known for writing both horror and strange fiction. He also happens to be a born-and-raised Rhode Islander who spent the majority of his life in New England. Unfortunately, Lovecraft was virtually unknown while he was alive — it was only after his demise in 1937 at the age of 46 that the general public realized what a literary genius he was. He’s now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors of supernatural horror fiction.\n\nIf you’re one of the many people who have come to admire HP Lovecraft, you know Rhode Island is full of his prior homes and points of interest, especially Providence.
