Lovecraft, and Clark Ashton Smith\n\nPREFACE For two reasons, I never knew H. P. Lovecraft. First, I started seriously writing fiction only during the year following his death in 1937. Second, I seldom read Weird. Tales, almost his only professional outlet, until nearly a decade later. Alas! in the summer of 1932 I was in Boston, an hour from his home, taking graduate courses at M.I.T. Had I hut known. . . . During the period 1946-60, I learned about Lovecraft little by little. I also learned about other members of the LovecraftWeird Tales circle, especially Robert E. Howard. While I enjoyed Lovecraft’s fiction, Howard’s stories came closer to the kind of swashbuckling adventure-fantasy that I most enjoy reading and writing. Later, I became involved in completing, rewriting, and editing a number of Howard’s unpublished tales; but that is another story. A few years ago, I gathered material on Lovecraft and his colleagues for a series of magazine articles, “Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers.” In this project, I had help and encouragement from August W. Derleth of Sauk City, Wisconsin, who had more or less single-handedly kept Lovecraft’s name alive and his books in print since Lovecraft’s death. Knowing that Derleth intended to write a full-length biography of Lovecraft, I had no thought of attempting such a task. Derleth, however, died suddenly on July 4, 1971, his biography unwritten.\n\nxii\n\nPREFACE\n\nSince I had amassed many letters and publications by and about Lovecraft, it seemed logical for me to undertake the work. It appeared to me that, even if I had not known Lovecraft, I had one advantage over Lovecraft’s friend Derleth. Whereas Derleth admired Lovecraft to the point of idolatry, I felt that I could approach my subject more objectively. Whether I was right in so thinking is for the reader to judge. The more I delved into Lovecraft’s life, the more fascinating I found him. I saw in him certain of my own shortcomings, in what I hope is exaggerated form. To read of his many mistakes and misadventures gives me a “there-but-for-the-grace-of-God” feeling. I do not pretend completely to understand H. P. Lovecraft. It is hard for one who is future-oriented rather than past-oriented, is rather indifferent to physical surroundings, has never experienced homesickness, and has no special nostalgia for the scenes of his youth, to comprehend a man who suffered actute, lifelong home­ sickness for his grandfather’s house on Angell Street. In other ways, too, his nature and mine were far apart. In my judgment, the average author is not a very interesting subject for biography. Most writers pound away at their typewriters, year in and year out, save when their families drag them off for a few weeks of enforced vacation. That is not to say that authors find life dull. They are often enthusiastic about their trade. But their fascinating adventures and discoveries mostly take place inside their own heads and so are not available to the biographer. On the other hand, an author’s autobiography may be very interesting, since he can discuss his mental processes and emotional experiences. Although Lovecraft never wrote a real autobiography, he did the next best thing. He put his personal history and intimate thoughts into letters, of which he wrote an incredible number: 100,000 according to one estimate. While many of these have disap­ peared, thousands still exist in the archives of Brown University, in private collections, and in published form. For my sins, I have read thousands of these letters, the great majority in Lovecraft’s original scribbly longhand. If he had not spent so much time on letters, he might have achieved more\n\nPREFACE\n\nXili\n\nworldly success; but then I could not have written about him in such detail. In preparing this book, I have had the generous help of many colleagues and Lovecraft fans. I am particularly indebted to: Irving Binkin, for letting me use the Philip Jack Grill collection of Lovecraftiana and furnishing me with photocopies of hundreds of pages of letters and amateur publications, and the photograph of the Lovecraft family; The Brown University Library, for the use of copies of numerous letters, publications, and photographs by, of, and about II. P. Love­ craft; My wife, Catherine Crook de Camp, for taking time from her own professional writing to edit my manuscript; Frank Belknap Long, for reviewing a large part of the manu­ script and submitting to lengthy interviews about his reminiscences of Lovecraft; Ethel Phillips Monish (Mrs. Roy A. Morrish), Lovecraft’s cousin and heir, for giving permission to quote ad libitum from Love­ craft’s letters and for giving background information on the Phillips family; Sam Moskowitz, for letting me use his priceless collection of old pulp magazines, including Weird Tales and the Munsey maga­ zines; and Flenry L. P. Beckwith, Kenneth W. Faig, Jr., Donald M. Grant, and Barton Levy St. Armand, who showed me around Providence and Rhode Island, read and criticized part or all of the manu­ script, and answered many questions about Lovecraft and his milieu.

The third floor, whence gables and dormer windows faced in all directions, housed four servants. The house stood on spacious grounds with well-kept walks, arbors, trees, an orchard, and a fountain, and behind the house a barn sheltered the Phillips carriage and three horses. Besides the amenities of upper-class American life of the 1890s, the house at 454 Angell Street2 included a library of 2,000 books, some of them centuries old. Whipple Phillips and his wife Robie were both well-read. Robie Phillips, who had had for her\n\n2\n\nLOVECRAFT\n\ntime a good education, developed an interest in astronomy and collected books on the subject. To this house, in late spring or early summer of 1893, came the Phillipses’ middle daughter, Susie Phillips Lovecraft, with her two-year-old son Howard. Susie had been living with her husband, Winfield Scott Lovecraft, in the suburbs of Boston; but the husband had gone violently insane and had been placed in a mental institution. The shock of her husband’s breakdown, apparently, started Susie on a mental decline, which continued until she died eighteen years later. Between his indulgent grandparents and aunts and his neurotic mother, young Howard Lovecraft had a very odd upbringing indeed. In later years, H. P. Lovecraft liked to talk of his mother’s accomplishments: her singing and piano-playing, her painting, and her knowledge of French. People who knew her after her husband’s death, however, spoke differently. Albert A. Baker, the family lawyer, called her a “weak sister.” The psychiatrist at Butler Hospital, which she entered in 1919 for her final illness, termed her “a woman of narrow interests who received, with traumatic psychosis, an awareness of approaching bankruptcy.”3 Without her husband, Susie became obsessed by the idea that little Howard was all she had. Since her narrow interests were now concentrated on her son, she protected, coddled, pampered, and indulged the boy to a degree that even the staunchest advocate of permissive upbringing might deem excessive. From the Victorian rocking chair in which she used to rock him to sleep while singing airs from Pinafore and The Mikado, she had the ornamental knobs planed off lest he hurt himself on them. Furthermore: On their summer vacations at Dudley, Massachusetts . . . Mrs. Lovecraft refused to eat her dinner in the dining room, not to leave her sleeping son alone for an hour on the floor above. When a diminutive teacher friend, Miss Sweeney, took the rather rangy youngster for a walk, holding his hand, she was enjoined by Howard’s mother to stoop a little lest she pull the boy’s arm from its socket. When Howard pedaled his tricycle along Angell Street, his mother trooped beside him, a guarding hand upon his shoulder. This vigilance increased rather than relaxed, the older Howard grew. . . *\n\nSusie let her son eat what he pleased. As a result, he became an avid consumer of sweets and ice cream at the expense of\n\nCOLLEGE IIILL\n\n3 healthier foodstuffs, and he never did get over childish aversions to sea food and some common vegetables. She let him rise and go to bed when he liked, so that he became a noctural creature seldom seen in the daytime. When he was seven, she confiscated a copy of FI. G. Wells’s novel, The Island of Dr. Moreau, lest its gruesomeness harm his delicate nerves. Equally unfavorable to the boy’s development was the fact that Susie Lovecraft had ardently wished for a girl; she had started a hope chest for one. Hence, she persistently favored the character­ istics of her son considered feminine. She dressed him in a Lord Fauntleroy suit and deliberately tried to feminize him. As a result of his mother’s suggestions, the infant Lovecraft for a while insisted: “I’m a little girl.”5 He was a brown-eyed tot with long golden curls. When the Lovecrafts had boarded with a family named Guiney in Massachu­ setts, these curls had led Mrs. Guiney to call him “Little Sunshine.” Susie made him keep those curls for six years, although he began to complain about them at the age of three. For a while, Susie appeased him by showing him pictures from the eighteenth-cen­ tury Spectator, depicting grown men in long hair and short pants like his. This started his lifelong enthusiasm for the Baroque Era but did not reconcile him to the curls. At last, when he was six, she yielded to his plaints. Weeping bitterly, she had his hair cut.® At the same time, strangely enough, she avoided all physical contact with the small boy and told people that he was ugly. Long afterwards, Lovecraft confessed to his wife that his mother’s attitude towards him had been “devastating.” His Aunt Lillian told a friend of his \"that they had been very foolish in the super­ protection that they had thrown about the boy, even to his thirtieth year.”7 By then, however, it was too late to do much about it. Howard Lovecraft was, furthermore, a very precocious child with an amazing memory. He knew his letters at two, was reading at three, and was writing at four. lie soon began reading his way through the Phillips library. This combination of peculiar heredity, bizarre upbringing, and early bookishness combined to produce the mass of contradictions that was Lovecraft.\n\nHoward Phillips Lovecraft (1890-1937) commands attention from any lover of imaginative fiction, not only because of his highly\n\nLOVECRAFT 4 original stories, his wide influence, and his key position in the genre, but also because of the strange personality that resulted from his unusual background. He embodied more contradictions than one would think could be crammed into a single human being. When Lovecraft died, he was almost unknown outside a small circle of friends, correspondents, and connoisseurs of fantastic fiction. Not a single book of his stories had been professionally published, although friends had made abortive amateur efforts to print such books. The book Rhode Island, a Guide to the Smallest State, issued in the year of his death by the Federal Writers' Project, does not mention Lovecraft in its chapter on Rhode Island’s writers. Neither does the Providence Journal’s tourist brochure Seeing Provi­ dence. Lovecraft deemed himself an utter failure, a “total loss.” Yet, thirty-odd years later, Lovecraft’s works are selling by the hundreds of thousands. Collectors pay $30 to $100 for each of his letters. He had been the subject of a play and of at least five masters’ theses. Lovecraft has been translated into ten or more foreign languages and hailed, especially in the Latin countries, as the compeer of Edgar Allan Poe. A Spanish writer, José Luís García, has pronounced Lovecraft one of the ten greatest writers of all time. Michel de Ghelrode in Belgium ranks him as one of America’s four greatest writers, the others being Poe, Bierce, and Whitman. Stephen Vincent Benêt has joined Jean Cocteau and André Billy of France in praise of Lovecraft’s work.8 On Sunday, August 5, 1973, the newspaper La Opinion Buenos Aires devoted its entire cultural supplement to Lovecraft. Lovecraft lamented his own lack of accomplishment; yet all his life he threw up self-made barriers between himself and his goals. He condemned affectations and poses but was himself the very prince of poseurs. He liked to consider himself an aged recluse, writing his aunts as “My darling daughter” and “My dear grand­ child” and signing his letters “Grandpa.” He affected the language, attitudes, and even spelling (“antient,” “publick,” “ask’d”) of an eighteenth-century English Tory, or at least of a Colonial Loyalist. He laced his letters with exclamations of “God save the King!” When his friend Morton taxed him with being a poseur, he blandly replied: “But isn’t it an artistic pose?”9 Once he visited the monument to the first Colonials to fall in\n\nCOLLEGE HILL\n\n5\n\nthe Revolution, in Lexington, Massachusetts. Asked if lie had felt an emotional reaction, he replied: “I certainly did! I drew myself up and cried in a loud voice: ‘So perish all enemies and traitors to His lawful Majesty, King George the Third!’ ”10 A philosophical materialist, he had a sound knowledge of the sciences and a profound respect for the scientific method. Yet he was full of pseudo-scientific racial theories. He rhapsodized on “the infinite superiority of the Teutonic Aryan\" and “the lusty battle­ cry of a blue-eyed, blond-bearded warrior,\"11 although he himself was as unlike a stalwart Viking marauder as one can imagine. Despite his talk of being a bloodthirsty berserker and his stories of ghouls, cannibalism, and rotting corpses, he was so squeamish that, when he caught a mouse, he threw away trap and all rather than touch the tiny cadaver. Long a belligerent nationalist and militarist, he was so overcome with remorse when, as a youth, he shot a squirrel that he never hunted again. Most people whose political views change begin as liberals or radicals and grow conservative with age; Lovecraft started as an ultraconservative and became a Socialistic liberal and a fervent admirer of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Lovecraft wrote: “. . . my hatred of the human animal mounts by leaps and bounds the more I see of the damned vermin,\" and his wife said: “I think he hated humanity in the abstract.”12 Yet, for a self-proclaimed misanthrope, he gathered a marvelous lot of devoted friends. All his friends described him as one of the kindest, most generous, and most unselfish persons they had known. Until the last few years of his life, Lovecraft was ethnocentric to the point of mania. In the abstract, he hated all foreigners, im­ migrants, and ethnics, calling them “twisted ratlike vermin from the ghetto” and “rat-faced, beady-eyed oriental mongrels.”13 When he was rooming in Brooklyn and learned that his neighbor was a Syrian, he reacted like a man who finds a rattlesnake in his bathtub. Yet, when Lovecraft came to know members of these hated ethnoi, he always proved as kind, courteous, friendly, generous, and affectionate towards them as he did towards Anglo-Saxons. For all his oft-proclaimed antipathy to Jews, he married one and num­ bered another among his closest friends. In his last years, Lovecraft\n\n6\n\nLOVECRAFT\n\ndropped practically all his ethnic phobias and denounced the very opinions he had earlier flaunted. Lovecraft gave good advice on literary matters but failed to take it himself. He advised apprentice poets to avoid affectations, such as archaic words and spellings, while himself composing in the style of the days of good Queen Anne. He urged them to shun “Baroque excesses,” although critics found his own works crammed with such excesses. He warned one young friend against the delusion that the world owed him a living because of his literary talents and artistic tastes.14 But all his life, Lovecraft acted as if he were owed such a living. He played the impoverished aristocrat who would not compromise his gentlemanly principles for vulgar mer­ cenary reasons. He inveighed against “mawkish sentimentality”15 in fiction; but if anyone was mawkishly sentimental about his own childhood and the mementos of it, it was HPL. Lovecraft detested sexual irregularities and deviations. Yet his own approach to sex was so prissy and inhibited that, combined with his high voice and what even a close friend has called his “mincing manner,”16 some have wondered about his sexual orienta­ tion, too. While he undoubtedly loved Sonia, the wife of his short-lived marriage, the real love affair of his life was with the city of Providence; that is, with the material city—the houses and streets —not with the people, for whom he cared little and few of whom even knew he existed. This passion kept him fixed in Providence nearly all his life, although he suffered from a rare ailment that made him hypersensitive to the cold of Yankee winters. One critic called Lovecraft “a complex blend of neurasthenic invalid and Nordic superman; of arrogant poseur and lonely misfit; of cosmic fantaisiste and rigorous scientific materialist; of scholar, scoffer, and seeker; of life hater, and lover who never found object worthy of his love, or who never found himself worthy to offer love, save in the indirect guise of these torrential, compulsive letters which both clamor for and repel that affection which was . . . simply his due as a human being.”17 This picture is not wrong so far as it goes, but it errs in selection. It omits Lovecraft’s many positive qualities, such as his\n\nCOLLEGE HILL\n\n7\n\nkeen intelligence, vast knowledge, artistic sensitivity, strict personal probity, charm, courtesy, and kindness. Lovecraft’s peculiarities make him sound like an unattractive freak. Yet people who met him, prepared to dislike him, found themselves captivated. In 1920, a fellow amateur journalist, George Julian Houtain, called upon him at home and wrote:\n\nSomehow I had never been ambitious to meet Lovecraft—I had an impression that he was heavy and ponderous. . . . He is apparently all those things I detest—yet, from the minute I met him, I liked Howard P. Lovecraft immensely.18 So there we have him: a man of outstanding virtues and egregious faults; a man both lovable and hateable, depending upon which side of his complex nature one views; a man born out of his time; the writer of stories about which opinions differ to a fan­ tastic degree; a man whose powerful influence on his genre of literature contrasts utterly with the paltry recognition accorded him in his lifetime.\n\nThe city of Providence, for which Lovecraft had such a singular platonic passion, is an attractive place, especially for those who like Colonial architecture, old-fashioned Yankee atmosphere, and early hours. The local speech is typical eastern New England Ameri­ can. Rhode Island is the smallest of the fifty states in area, with a mere 1,248 square miles, 181 of them under water. It embraces the large, deeply indented Narragansett Bay, in which rise several islands. The colony eventually took its name from the largest of these islands.19 Banished from Massachusetts for heresy in 1636, Roger Williams and four companions settled on the site of Providence. Williams was one of the first men in Christendom fully to embrace the principle of religious freedom. He welcomed Quakers when Massachusetts was hanging them along with witches and pirates. He even invited “Papists, Infidels, Turkes, and I ewes”20 to settle in the colony with­ out fear. Although the Rhode Islanders cultivated a low religious temper­ ature, they clung to the Puritan virtues of thrift, commercial enter­ prise, and hard work. When in 1762 a company of actors set up a\n\n8\n\nLOVECRAFT\n\ntheater in Providence, a town meeting persuaded the Assembly to legislate them out of town, not because their plays were immoral but because: “So Expensive Amusements and idle Diversions, cannot be any good Tendancy among us, especially at this Time, when this Colony as well as others, is labouring under the grievous Calamity of an uncommon Drought, and a very great Scarcity of flay and Provisions.”21 At its northern end, Narragansett Bay forks. The eastern fork is the Taunton River; the western, the so-called Seekonk River— actually the estuary of the Blackstone River. Providence stands on the west side of the Seekonk. Besides being the capital of the state, it is a manufacturing town and a minor seaport. Its population has ranged, during this century, between a fifth and a quarter of a million. The little Providence River, now mostly bridged over, cuts through the city to empty into the Seekonk. Paralleling the Provi­ dence River, the tracks of the Penn Central Railroad and Interstate Route 95 run along low ground through the middle of the town. The Penn Central station faces a large central plaza, bedight with statues and other monuments. South and west of this plaza extends the main business district, where tall office buildings have begun to dwarf the relics of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. A little over a quarter mile north of the station stands the Rhode Island State House, built of marble and white granite in 1895-1901, with columns and central dome. The vale through which the river, the railroad, and the highway run is flanked by two hills, in addition to smaller heights elsewhere. To the west rises Federal Hill, large in area and gentle in slope. Its population has long been heavily Italo-American. To the east stands the smaller but steeper College Hill, where the houses form a living museum of Colonial and Federalist architecture. College Hill occu­ pies a blunt peninsula, about a mile across, formed by the junction of the Providence and Seekonk rivers. Above its steep western slope, Brown University crowns the hill. Benefit Street, stretching along the side of the hill west of the campus, is noted for its red-brick and wooden-frame Colonial houses. No. 88 is the Sarah Helen Whitman house, built in the 1780s and named for the irresistible widow who dwelt there in the 1830s and 40s. Hither in 1848, the last year of his life, came Edgar Allan Poe\n\nCOLLEGE HILL\n\n9\n\nfor a hectic courtship of Mrs. Whitman. She agreed to marry him if he gave up drinking; he promised but soon reneged and was given his congé. Crossing Benefit Street at right angles is Angell Street, on which Lovecraft lived for thirty-one of his forty-six years. It climbs up one side of College Hill, crosses through the Brown campus, and slopes down the other side. Except for some of the office buildings and the superhighway through the center of town, Providence looks much as it did in Lovecraft’s time. During Lovecraft’s boyhood (1890-1910) the people of Prov­ idence were divided along class lines much like those of nearby Boston. The crust of this society was made up of Old Americans: persons of long-settled Northwest European descent, mostly AngloSaxon Protestants. Among them, “more emphasis is placed on duty, probity, good manners, and quiet accomplishment than on money or show.”22 Thrift stood high in their scale of virtues. In a wealthy house­ hold, a moderate shabbiness of person and property was not only tolerated but even admired as showing the owner’s thrift. As a Bostonian in John P. Marquand’s novel The Late George Apley (1936) advises his son: Your Great-uncle William’s house has always seemed to me a part of him and, therefore, not subject to change. The plainness of the furnishings, the draughtiness of its halls, the worn tines of the forks on his dining table, and the darns in his table linen have been to me of his characteristics and an intimation of inherent worth. Your Great-uncle William, if he wished, could live with the ostentation of the nouveau riche; but he does not wish it. He has a dislike for external show, which is shared by others who are accustomed to money. He still goes to his place of business on the trolley cars. He buys perhaps one suit a year. ... In commenting on this you must not forget his generosity to others. . . . In economic matters, this ruling class adhered to an extreme pro-capitalist conservatism, of the sort that led Marquand’s fictional George Apley to inveigh against “such Socialistic nonsense as an income tax and old age pensions.”23 At the bottom of this heap was a mass of immigrants and ethnics, largely Italian, Irish, Portuguese, and Jews of various antecedents. There was animosity between the upper and lower groups, especially when the ethnics began clawing their way up into positions that the Old Americans viewed as theirs\n\nIO\n\nLOVECRAFT\n\nby right of descent. One critic has described the turn of the nine­ teenth and twentieth centuries in Boston thus:\n\nIt was a period that was very English Colonial in feeling, and where the concept of Society, in the English sense, was not only accepted but stressed. One talked seriously of who the people of Ouality were, who were the gentry and who were not. Both blood and breeding mattered. Anything English was admired. . . . Most important, there were Upper and there were Lower classes, and each class dressed and spoke and acted its part. Among Old Americans, the most highly regarded were those who had inherited wealth. While money was always good, inherited money was better than earned money. Tire belief was that by growing up with money instead of having to scrounge for it, one was more likely to learn the superior code of behavior that distin­ guished gentlefolk. Below this upper-upper class were the Old Americans who, starting from little or nothing, had made money, or those who had once had money but had it no longer. Lovecraft’s maternal ancestors, the Phillips family, fell into this lower-upper class. An acquaintance described them as “old fashioned gentlefolk which meant con­ siderable in the old aristocratic Providence East Side neighborhood prior to World War I.”24 Like the rest of the nation, New England has felt the mixing, leveling, homogenizing forces of the twentieth century. Hence, much of the former social stratification has been blurred and broken up. But old attitudes die hard. In New England, one still meets a quiet pride of class, caste, and Old American ancestry; a tradition of wealth artfully hidden behind a shabby-genteel façade; and a high regard for thrift, sobriety, industry, prudence, and probity.\n\nLike most upper-class New Englanders, the Phillipses were ancestor-conscious. Lovecraft, who sometimes hunted for ancestral tombstones in the graveyards of western Rhode Island, liked to claim that his mother’s family were derived from some of the more eminent Phillipses of Rhode Island and thence from titled British ancestors. A genealogist, however, reports that Lovecraft’s connections arc doubtful. Here are the main, well-established facts about Love­ craft’s forebears. West of Providence, the land rolls away in a series of low,\n\nCOLLEGE HILL\n\n11\n\nrounded hills. The land was once cleared of the forest primeval for farming; but, within the present century, most of the farms have been given up and the land has gone back to dense, scrubby second growth. Fifteen miles west of Providence, on the Connecticut border, lies the “town” (that is, township) of Foster. Here in the hamlet of Moosup Valley lived the Phillips farming family, and here, on November 22, 1833, was bom Whipple Van Buren Phillips. At fourteen, Whipple Phillips was orphaned when his father, Jeremiah Phillips, perished in a mill accident; he caught his coat­ tails in the machinery. Young Whipple Phillips ran a store in Moosup Valley; he invented a fringe-trimming machine and made money from it. In 1855, he and his younger brother James fell in love with two local girls, Robie Alzada Place and her cousin Jane Place. Said Whipple to James: “You take Jane and the farm, while I take Robie and go to Providence to seek my fortune.”25 Whipple Phillips was a hearty, energetic, enterprising, extro­ verted man who had a long and checkered but, on the whole, successful business career. He operated a sawmill and engaged in the coal and real-estate business in the village of Greene, which he named for the hero of the Revolutionary War. In 1874, having sold out his local interests, he settled in Providence. He served in several public offices and joined every organization in sight, becoming a prominent Mason. Whipple Phillips also picked up a fair degree of culture. He twice visited Italy and acquired a taste for Italian art. In late years he was a large, stout man with a big white walrus mustache. Whipple and Robie Phillips had five children, four girls and a boy. The three girls who survived childhood were Lillian Dolores (1856-1932); Sarah Susan (called “Susie,” 1857-1921); and Annie Emeline (1866-1941). Lillian, a plain woman whose short, hooked nose and eyeglasses gave her an owlish look, was quiet, shy, timid, calm, and cheerful. Susie, despite a prominent nose and a long chin, was considered the beauty of the family. She had vague artistic leanings but was foolish and unrealistic. Annie, a small, fairly good­ looking woman, had more spunk and common sense than either of her sisters. All three girls were well-educated at finishing school. Lillian\n\n12\n\nLOVECRAFT\n\nshowed a lively interest in literature and science. Susie could play the piano and sing, and both she and Lillian were competent pain ters. Whipple Phillips’s son Edwin E. Phillips (1864-1918) married in 1894 but left no children. He worked with his father but quarreled with him shortly before Whipple’s death and was therefore treated less generously in the will than his sisters, with whom lie later reestablished friendly relations. Of the three Phillips sisters, the first to marry was the middle one, the pretty but featherbrained Susie. On June 12, 1889, at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Boston, she wedded Winfield Scott Lovecraft, a traveling salesman for the Gorham Silver Company of Providence. She was thirty-one and he, thirty-five. This Lovecraft was a foppishly dressed, handsome man with a luxuriant mustache. Although born in Rochester, New York, he spoke with so audible a British accent that acquaintances remembered him as a “pompous Englishman.”20 Winfield Lovecraft’s grandfather, Joseph Lovecraft, had been a native of Devonshire, England, whose father had lost his property. In 1827, Joseph Lovecraft migrated to the United States with his wife and six children and settled in Rochester. One of the children, George Lovecraft (1815-95) married Helen Allgood, also of British parentage, and reared two girls and a boy. Born in 1853, the boy, like many boys of his time, was named for a popular hero—in this case, General Winfield Scott of the Mexican War. As Winfield Love­ craft grew up, his parents, conscious of their British background, insisted that he speak in the English manner. Winfield Scott Lovecraft’s parents moved to Mount Vernon, New York, and young Winfield Lovecraft went to work for Gorham. He seems to have been an able salesman, but little is known about him. Following the marriage, the not-so-young couple rented quarters in Dorchester, Massachusetts, south of Boston, since most of Win­ field Lovecraft’s business was at that time in Boston. Before the birth of their onlv child, fourteen months later, Susie Lovecraft returned to her father’s home in Providence. There, on August 20, 1890, Howard Phillips Lovecraft—in his time, the only American known to have borne the Lovecraft name—was born.\n\nBy a route obscure and lonely, Haunted by ill angels only, Where an Eidolon named Night, On a black throne reigns upright, I have reached these lands but newly From an ultimate dim Thule— From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime, Out of Space—out of Time.1 Poe\n\nSince Winfield Lovecraft’s principal business was in Boston, he set about buying a lot in that region and contracting for a house. In the spring of 1892, when Howard was a year and a half old, the family moved. Their movements for the next year are uncertain. According to Lovecraft, the family rented temporary' quarters in Dorchester and took a vacation in Dudley, Massachusetts. They also boarded for about seven weeks, in June and July, at the Guiney house in Auburndale, Massachusetts, a crossroads suburb near the Stony Brook Reservoir. The Guiney family consisted of the poetess Louise Imogen Guiney (1861-1920), a scholarly spin­ ster in her early thirties, and her mother, the widow of an Irish-born Civil War general. In 1892, the Guineys were hard-pressed. Louise\n\nLOVECRAFT 14 was scraping a living by writing poems and articles for local papers and by proofreading and other forms of casual editing. Forty years later, Lovecraft said that his mother had been a friend of Louise Guiney and that the Lovecrafts had stayed at the Guineys’ for six months, through the winter of 1892-93. Louise Guiney’s letters for 1892, however, show that Lovecraft’s memory had deceived him. They indicate that, so far from being Susie’s close friend, Louise disliked the Lovecrafts and resented their presence. She wrote: “Two confounded heathen are coming to BOARD this summer.” “There are two and a half of them, as I said all atrocious Philistines, whom I hate with enthusiasm.” “Our cussed inmates here, praise the Lord, go next month.” “The unmentionables are gone, and we are our own mistresses again.”I2 The reasons for Louise’s dislike of the older Lovecrafts are not hard to guess. She was a complete scholar and intellectual, well-read in the European literature of several preceding centuries, literate in French and Italian, and indifferent to the practical sides of life. By “Philistines” she meant prosaic, conventional, unintellectual, com­ mercial-minded persons. The Lovecrafts may have been a respectable bourgeois couple; but, being intellectual lightweights, they probably bored Louise stiff. Louise’s relations with the infant Howard Lovecraft, however, seem to have been more friendly. She taught him Mother Goose and Tennyson’s Maud. She coached him, when she asked him: “Whom do you love?” to reply: “Louise Imogen Guiney!” She also taught him to make rhymes. Since Louise had already published several books of poems and essays, eminent literary visitors came to the house. Lovecraft sat on the knee of Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes. In later years, Lovecraft’s earliest memories were of the vacation at Dudley and of his stay at the Guineys’:\n\nI recall the house with its frightful attic water-tank & my rocking-horses at the head of the stairs. I recall also the plank walks laid to facilitate walking in rainy weather—& a wooded ravine, & a boy with a small rifle who let me pull the trigger while my mother held me. . . . My first clear & connected memories centre in Au­ burndale—the shady streets, the bridge over the 4-tracked B. & A. R. R. with the business section beyond, the Guiney house in Vista Ave., the poetess’s great St. Bernard dogs, the verse-reciting session at which I was made to stand on a table & spout Mother Goose & other infantile classics. . . .\n\nBENT TWIG\n\n15 Because of Lovecraft’s extreme youth (he was not quite two) at the time he knew Louise Guiney and the shortness of the time he lived with her, it would be rash to credit any of his later attitudes to her. Still, one cannot help being struck by the similarities between the two. Moreover, Lovecraft was precociously aware and intelligent and had an amazing memory, reaching back into 1ns second year. Like Lovecraft in later life, Louise Guiney despised commer­ cialism and cared little about money. Like him, she was an ardent Anglophile. Like him, she rejected the modern world and professed allegiance to earlier times. Like his, her outlook was sexless. Although an able writer, she preferred, rather than earn a good living, to spend her time on scholarly monographs about forgotten seventeenth-century poets. She wrote much verse. (I regret to say that I find her poetry' dull and saccharine; to Lovecraft it was unin­ telligible.) During this period, Winfield Lovecraft seems to have played a normal husband-and-father rôle. H. P. Lovecraft recalled that he used to go up to his father when the latter was seated, resplendent in black coat and vest, striped trousers, wing collar, and Ascot tie. He would slap Winfield on the knee and cry: “Papa, you look just like a young man!”3 I do not know where the Lovecrafts lived during the fall and winter of 1892-93, but in any case this ménage did not long endure. In April, 1893, when Howard Lovecraft was two and a half, Win­ field Lovecraft went to Chicago on a business trip. “Alone in his hotel room, he suddenly began crying out that the chambermaid had insulted him and that his wife was being assaulted on the floor above.”4 He was put under restraint and returned to the East. Since his hallucinations came more and more often, he was declared legally incompetent, committed to the guardianship of the lawyer Albert A. Baker, and placed in a mental institution. This state of affairs continued for five years until, on April 25, 1898, Winfield Lovecraft was admitted (or readmitted) to Butler Hospital in Providence, in a condition of advanced cerebral disease or “general paralysis of the insane.” On July 19th aged forty-four, he died. The cause of death was listed on his death certificate as “general paresis.” Today, “paresis” implies the disorders resulting from an ad-\n\n16\n\nLOVECRAFT\n\nvanccd case of syphilis. Writers on H. P. Lovecraft have therefore assumed that Winfield Lovecraft died of syphilis, although in the 1890s “paresis\" was still used as a general synonym for “paralysis.\" In 1948, the psychiatrist and former Weird Tales writer Dr. David H. Keller wrote an article arguing that not only did Winfield Lovecraft die of syphilis but that he had also transmitted it to his wife, so that II. P. Lovecraft suffered all his life from congenital, hereditary syphilis. Another psychiatrist, Kenneth Sterling, who had known H. P. Lovecraft personally, vehemently disagreed. Keller’s medical ideas, he said, were obsolete. Winfield Lovecraft’s syphilis was not proved; paralysis like his could have causes other than syphilis. Even if Win­ field Lovecraft was syphilitic, H. P. Lovecraft would have had only an outside chance of incurring the disease. Physicians tell me that, from the meager data, they think that Winfield Lovecraft probably, but not certainly, had syphilis. He died before the development of the Wassermann test m 1907. While Winfield Lovecraft may not have been the roué he has sometimes been pictured, it is safe to say that for a handsome, dashing traveling salesman, marrying at thirty-five, to have had no previous sexual experience would be unusual. On the other hand, neither Susie nor her son, for all their oddities, ever showed syphilitic symptoms. The best conclusion we can reach is that, while Winfield Love­ craft probably died of syphilis, the likelihood of Howard Phillips Lovecraft’s having been syphilitic appears to be negligible. It is not known whether H. P. Lovecraft ever knew of the alleged cause of his father’s affliction. He never spoke or wrote of any such thing, calling the breakdown “a complete paralysis resulting from a brain overtaxed with study & business cares.\"5 Practically nothing is known of the personal relationship be­ tween Winfield and Susie Lovecraft. H. P. Lovecraft once spoke of his mother as a “touch-me-not.’’ He indicated that she had almost no physical contact with him after his early childhood.6 O11 this small foundation, Lovecraftians have reared an imposing structure of speculation. Susie, they say, must have been sexually frigid. (Why shouldn’t she be, growing up in an era when many young ladies first learned the facts of life on their wedding nights and suffered a dreadful shock?) So Winfield Lovecraft, finding his\n\nBENT TWIG\n\nly\n\nwife at best a grimly acquiescent sexual partner, sought his amuse­ ment elsewhere and thus picked up his syphilis. This is only guesswork. Still, HPL’s queasy attitude towards sex must have come from somewhere, and his mother is the likeliest source. Probably Susie, like many wives of her generation, deemed sex a bestial, disgusting business to which women were condemned by the mysterious decrees of God to submit for the purpose of breeding children. Such a view of sex was not strange in late nineteenth-century New England. As Henry Adams explained: “. . . any one brought up among Puritans knew that sex was sin. . . . American art, like the American language and American education, was as far as possible sexless. Society regarded this victory over sex as its greatest tri­ umph. . . .”7 So the projected Lovecraft house was never built. Shortly after the onset of Winfield Lovecraft’s madness, Susie and her son moved back to her father’s house in Providence. Here, Whipple Phillips overshadowed the rest of his family: his wife, a “serene, quiet lady of the old school”;8 his oldest daughter Lillian, learned but shy and timid; his middle daughter Susie, now sunk in sorrow; and his youngest daughter, Annie, lively and socially active. Phillips enjoyed the Italian paintings and mosaics he had bought in his European travels. He wore mosaic cuff links, one showing the Colosseum and the other the Forum. He was usually genial, save when harassed by one of his frequent headaches. His daughter Susie inherited his tendency to migraine and passed it on to her son. Phillips had formed a youthful taste for weird and macabre fiction. His favorites had been the Gothic writers of the late eight­ eenth and early nineteenth centuries: Mrs. Anne Radcliffe, Matthew Gregory Lewis, and Charles Maturin. Seeing that his grandson showed similar interests, Whipple Phillips amused the lad with ghost stories and weird tales that he made up. He told of “black woods, unfathomed caves, winged honors . . . old witches with sinister cauldrons, and ‘deep, low, moaning sounds.’ To cure the boy of fear of the dark, Phillips led him about the unlighted house at night. This indoctrination was so successful that,\n\n18\n\nLOVECRAFT\n\nfor the rest of his life, Lovecraft preferred night as the time to be lip and abroad. Whipple Phillips was one of the organizers of the Owyhee Land and Irrigation Company, which had ambitious plans for dam­ ming the Snake River in Idaho, near the Snake's junction with the Bruneau. Phillips often traveled to Idaho, whence he wrote his grandson from the town of Mountain Home. H. P. Lovecraft was strongly influenced, not only by his mother but also by the books he read. A born bookworm, he was affected more by the printed word than by his peers. In fact, for his first thirty years, his impressions and opinions of the world were mainly formed from books. When Lovecraft was a tot, Susie read him the usual fairy tales. Soon he was reading voraciously. One of the first books he read was Grimm’s Tales. At five, he followed this with a junior edition of The Arabian Nights. He at once fell in love with the glories of medieval Islam and spent hours playing Arab. He “made my mother fix up an Oriental corner with hangings and incense-vessels in my room.”10 He collected oriental pottery and proclaimed himself a Muslim. An older relative playfully suggested that he call himself by the pseudo-Arabic name of “Abdul Alhazred.” He did and, moreover, put the name to literary use later. “Alhazred” is probably derived from “Hazard,” the name of an old Rhode Island family connected with the Phillipses. One effect of dabbling in non-Christian traditions was to make Lovecraft skeptical of the faith of his fathers. Before he reached his fifth birthday anniversary, young Lovecraft announced that he no longer believed in Santa Claus. Further private thought convinced him that the arguments for the existence of God suffered the same weaknesses as those for Santa. At five, Lovecraft was placed in the infant class of the Sunday school of the venerable First Baptist Meeting House on College Hill. The results were not what his elders expected. When the feeding of Christian martyrs to the lions came up, Lovecraft shocked the class by gleefully taking the side of the lions. Fie wrote: The absurdity of the myths I was called upon to accept, and the sombre greyness of the whole faith compared with the Eastern\n\nBENT TWIG\n\n19 magnificence of Mahometanism, made me definitely an agnostic; and caused me to become so pestiferous a questioner that I was permitted to discontinue attendance. No statement of the kind hearted and motherly preceptress had seemed to me to answer in any way the doubts I honestly and explicably expressed, and I was fast becoming a marked “man” through searching iconoclasm.11\n\nHome again among his beloved books, the young heathen, now six, plunged into Classical mythology: Always avid for fairy lore, I had chanced upon Hawthorne’s “Won­ der Book” and “Tanglewood Tales”, and was enraptured by the Hellenic myths even in their Teutoniscd form. Then a tiny book in the private library of my elder aunt—the story of the Odyssey in “Harper’s Half-hour Series”—caught my attention. From the open­ ing chapter I was electrified, and by the time I reached the end I was for evermore a Graeco-Roman. My Bagdad name and af­ filiations disappeared at once, for the magics of silks and colours faded before that of fragrant templed groves, faun-peopled mead­ ows in the twilight, and the blue beckoning Mediterranean, that billowed mysteriously out from Hellas into the reaches of haunting wonder where dwelt Lotophagi and Laestrygonians, where Aeolus kept the winds and Circe her swine, and where in Thrinacian pas­ tures roamed the oxen of radiant Helios. As soon as possible I pro­ cured an illustrated edition of Bullfinch’s “Age of Fable”, and gave all my time to the reading of the text, in which the true spirit of Hellenism is delightfully preserved, and to the contemplation of the pictures, splendid designs and half-tones of the standard classi­ cal statues and paintings of classical subjects. Before long I was fairly familiar with the principal Grecian myths and had become a constant visitor at the classical art museums of Providence and Boston. I commenced a collection of small plaster casts of the Greek masterpieces, and learned the Greek alphabet and the rudi­ ments of the Latin tongue. I adopted the pseudonym of “Lucius Valerius Messala”—Roman and not Greek, since Rome had a charm all its own for me. My grandfather had travelled observingly through Italy, and delighted me with long, first-hand accounts of its beauties and memorials of ancient grandeur. I mention this aesthetic tendency in detail only to lead up to its philosophical result—my last flickering of religious belief. When about seven or eight I was a genuine pagan, so intoxicated with the beauty of Greece that I acquired a half-sincere belief in the old gods and nature spirits. I have in literal truth built altars to Pan, Apollo, and Athena, and have watched for dryads and satyrs in the woods and fields at dusk. Once I firmly thought I beheld some kind of sylvan creatures dancing under autumnal oaks; a kind of “religious experience” as true in its way as the subjective ecstasies of a Chris­\n\n20\n\nLOVECRAFT\n\ntian. If a Christian tell me he has felt the reality of his Jesus or Jahveh, I can reply that I have seen hoofed Pan and the sisters of the Hesperian Phaethusa.12\n\nFor a time, young Lovecraft imagined that his ears were growing points and that horns were sprouting from his forehead. He was sorry that wishing failed to turn his feet into hooves. When he first read about Rome, a sense of personal connection seized him, so that whenever he thought of the ancient world he pictured himself as a Roman. The Germans have a word, Wundersucht, for this mystical sense of the reality of magic and the supernatural, which is often evoked in childhood by sights and sounds. I suppose that many have this feeling in youth. With most, I daresay, it dwindles and dies beneath the stresses of daily life. Some, however, keep it or at least the memory of it. Some seek to recover it by going into mysticism and occultism. Some become writers of imaginative fiction. One who did both, the Welsh fantasist Arthur Machen (1863-1947) explained it: \"This, then, was my process: to invent a story which would recreate those vague im­ pressions of wonder and awe and mystery that I myself had received from the form and shape of the land of my boyhood and youth. . . ,”13 A growing person passes through stages when he is prepared to accept certain ideas, if they are forcefully presented just then. He may, as it were, snap shut on them, like a molested bivalve, and cling to them with a tenacity out of proportion to their merit. We all know of such sudden conversions, say, to Christianity or to Marxism; but the phenomenon may take many other forms. So it was with Lovecraft. His skeptical view of the supernatural —his nontheism—and his love of the Classical world were not the only lasting passions formed in his childhood. Another was Anglo­ philia—a passion for everything English. He took the Tory or Loyalist side in the American Revolution:\n\n. . . some inner force set me at once to singing \"God save the King” and taking the opposite side of everything I read in Ameri­ can-biased child books on the Revolution. My aunts remember that as early as the age of three I wanted a British officer’s red uniform, and paraded around the house in a nondescript “coat” of brilliant\n\nBENT TWIG\n\n21\n\ncrimson, originally part of a less masculine costume, and in pic­ turesque juxtaposition with the kilts which to me represented the twelfth Royal Highland Regiment. Rule, Britannia! Nor can I say that any major change has ever taken place in my emotions. . . . All inv deep emotional loyalties are with the race and the empire rather than with the American branch—and if anything, this Old Englandism is about to become intensified as America grows more and more mechanised, standardized, and vulgarised—farther and farther removed from the original Anglo-Saxon stream which I represent.14 Anglophilia persisted throughout Lovecraft’s life; hence his dem­ onstration in Lexington. He could, he said, have claimed British citizenship on the basis of his paternal grandfather’s birth. During the First World or Kaiserian War, Lovecraft bitterly hated President Wilson for not taking the United States into the war on the British side at once instead of clinging to neutrality for two and a half years. At various times, Lovecraft urged that the United States (or at least New England) rejoin the British Empire. When others sang America, he sang God Save the King; when they sang The Star-Spangled Banner, he sang the eighteenth-century English drinking song To Anacreon in Heaven, whose tune Francis Scott Key had appropriated. Connected with this sentiment was an obsession with the Brit­ ish Empire, as it was not in Lovecraft’s time but in the eighteenth century:\n\nAt home all the main bookcases in library, parlours, dining-room, and elsewhere were full of standard Victorian junk, most of the brown-leather old-timers . . . having been banished to a windowless third-story trunk-room which had sets of shelves. But what did I do? What, pray, but go with candles and kerosene lamp to that ob­ scure & nighted aerial crypt—leaving the sunny downstairs 19th century flat, and boring my way through the decades into the late 17th, 18th & early 19th century by means of innumerable crum­ bling & long-f’d tomes of every size & nature—Spectator, Ta tier, Guardian, Idler, Rambler, Dryden, Pope, Thomson, Young, Tichell, Cooke’s Hesiod, Ovid by Various Hands, Francis’s Horace & Phacdrus &c. &c. &c . . . golden treasures, & thank gawd I have ’em yet as the main items in my own modest collection.\n\nAs a small child, Lovecraft showed a precocious ability to memorize poetry and at six began composing rhymed jingles. These, he said later, were so bad that even he was aware of their faults and\n\n22\n\nLOVECRAFT\n\nset about improving himself. lie learned his rules of versification from Abner Alden’s Reader of 1797, which his great-grandfather had used as a schoolbook and which he found in the attic in 1897. Lovecraft\n\n. . . conceived the childish freak of transporting myself altogether into the past; so began to choose only such books as were very old— with the ‘long f’ . . . and to date all my writings 200 years back— 1697 *nstead of 1897 and so on. . . . Before I knew it the eighteenth century had captured me more utterly than ever the hero of ‘Berke­ ley Square’ was captured; so that I used to spend hours in the attic poring over the long-s’d books banished from the library down­ stairs and unconsciously absorbing the style of Pope and Dr. John­ son as a natural mode of expression.15 Lovecraft disliked Fielding’s bawdiness; while aware of that side of eighteenth-century life, he deplored it and as far as he could ignored it. On the other hand, he embraced eighteenth-century rationalism, which confirmed him in his atheistic materialism. Such a flight into the past is not unique. Louise Guiney and Arthur Machen idealized the seventeenth and earlier centuries. Henry Adams thought of himself as having been “born an eighteenth­ century child.” Few outside of mental institutions, however, have carried out the charade with Lovecraft’s rigor. When indulging his eighteenth-century pose, he used archaic pronunciations like me for “my” and sarvent for “servant.” He tried to purge his speech of post-Colonial words and expressions. As a result, he could say:\n\nI think I am probably the only living person to whom the ancient 18th century idiom is actually a prose & poetic mother-tongue. . . . the naturally accepted norm, & the basic language of reality to which I instinctively revert despite all objectively learned tricks. ... I would actually feel more at home in a silver button’d coat, velvet small-cloaths, three-corner’d hat, buckled shoes, Ramillies bob wig, Steenkirk cravat, & all that goes with such an outfit from sword to snuff-box, than in the plain modern garb that good sense bids me wear in this prosaick aera. I’ve always had subconscious feeling that everything since the 18th century is unreal or illusory —-a sort of grotesque nightmare or caricature. People seem to me more or less like ironic shadows or phantoms—as if I could make them (together with all their modern houses & inventions & per­ spectives) dissolve into thin aether by merely pinching myself awake & shouting at them, “Why, damn ye, you’re not even born, & won’t be for a century & a half! God save the King, & his Colony of Rhode-Island & Providence-Plantations!”\n\nBENT TWIG\n\n23 For the rest of Lovecraft’s life, eighteenth-century England and Republican Rome remained his favorite historical periods. Although he admired Gothic architecture, the Middle Ages gave him “a pain in the neck.” He loved the Baroque, he said, because it was the last pre-mechanical period—the last era before the Industrial Revolution— and so, to his way of thinking, the most truly “civilised” of all. In the grip of this Baroque obsession, Lovecraft began grinding out pseudo-Georgian couplets, in imitation of Addison, Dryden, Pope, and their colleagues. At eleven, he bound up a manuscript book with the erudite title of Poemata Minora and dedicated it “To the Gods, Heroes, and Ideals of the Ancients.” One poem, Ode to Selene or Diana, began:\n\nTake heed, Diana, of my humble plea; Convey me where my happiness shall last— Draw me against the tide of time’s rough sea. And let my spirit rest amidst the past.10 While this stanza certainly expresses Lovecraft’s outlook, the loss of most of these poems in a warehouse, years later, does not seem an unbearable tragedy. When his elder aunt married Franklin Chase Clark, Lovecraft found a fellow-enthusiast for such poetry. Doctor Clark was a schol­ arly physician who made unpublished verse translations of Homer, Virgil, Lucretius, and Statius and who corrected and encouraged young Lovecraft’s attempts at Georgian prose and poetry.\n\nLovecraft’s pagan gods had not yet finished equipping him with crotchets. The Phillipses were teetotalers. Lovecraft said: “In my own family, wine has been banished for three generations; and only about a quarter of the conservative homes of this section retain any use of it.” In January, 1896, Lovecraft’s grandmother, that “serene, quiet lady” Robie Place Phillips, died. Since mourning was taken seriously in those days, the Phillips girls donned black attire, which “terrified & repelled me [Lovecraft] to such an extent that I would surrepti­ tiously pin bits of bright cloth or paper to their skirts for sheer relief. They had to make a careful survey of their attire before receiving callers or going out!”17 During the ensuing period of gloom, the five-year-old Love­ craft got hold of a book called Sunlight and Shadow by John B.\n\n24\n\nLOVECRAFT\n\nGough, a temperance crusader. Tire book teemed with such forth­ right dicta as “There is no trade so damaging to the community, so dangerous to the people, and so hardening to the dealer, as the trade in intoxicating liquors. . . . but for the drink curse, the number of criminals would be so small that at least two thirds of the convict prisons would be empty. . . Beer “feeds the sensual and beastly nature. Beyond all other drinks it qualifies for deliberate and unprovoked crime.” Gough also stood for strict Sabbath observance and denounced the mounting of photographs in albums. Ilis Prohibitionist exhorta­ tions found a ready believer in young Lovecraft, who became an ardent, lifelong Dry. He boasted of having never tasted liquor and, thirty years after his conversion by Gough, assured his correspondents that “The existence of intoxicating drink is certainly an almost unrelieved evil from the point of view of an orderly and delicately cultivated civilisation; for I can’t see that it does much save coarsen, animalise, & degrade.” He also said: “I am nauseated by even the distant stink of any alcoholic liquor.”18 But since he attended, without visible distress, many parties where liquor was served, the statement was probably defensive rhetoric rather than fact.\n\nThree NIGHT-GAUNTS Out of what crypt they crawl, I cannot tell, But every night I see the rubbery things. Black, horned, and slender, with membraneous wings, And tails that bear the bifid barb of hell. They come in legions on the north wind’s swell With obscene clutch that titillates and stings, Snatching me off on monstrous vovagings To grey worlds hidden deep in nightmare’s well.1 Lovecraft\n\nRealizing that Howard Lovecraft was a somewhat odd child, Susie Lovecraft curtailed her mourning. The somber garb appeared to make the boy nervous. Young Lovecraft had little to do with the neighborhood chil­ dren, although some of them later remembered him as lurking be­ hind shrubbery and jumping out to scare them. He disliked games, because they seemed so purposeless. “Amongst my few playmates I was very unpopular, since I would insist on playing out events in history, or acting according to consistent plots. . . . The children I knew disliked me, & I disliked them. . . . Their romping & shouting puzzled me. I hated mere play & dancing about—in my relaxations I always desired plot.”\n\n26\n\nLOVECRAFT\n\nWhen he was seven, his mother tried to enter him in a danc­ ing class. He balked and, having already picked up a smattering of Latin, quoted Cicero in the original: “Nemo fere saltat sobrius, nisi forte insanit! [Almost nobody dances sober, unless he happens to be insane].”2 So Susie gave up the idea. One day a neighbor, Mrs. Winslow Church, saw with alarm a large grass fire in a nearby field. She went out and found that young Lovecraft had set it. When scolded for endangering others’ property, he replied: “I wasn’t setting a big fire. I wanted to make a fire one foot by one foot.” Thus was foreshadowed his adult passion for accuracy. Sometimes Lovecraft’s second cousin Ethel Phillips, two years his senior, was brought over from Foster to give him some compan­ ionship. She found him willing to play, in a vague sort of way, but surprisingly inept. There was a swing on the property, but Lovecraft did not even know how to swing on it until she showed him.3 During these pre-school years, Lovecraft dragged his mother on many long walks. Although walking was the nearest he ever came to any athletic sport, he had the normal boy’s enthusiasm for railroads and played train in the yard with express wagons, wheelbarrows, and packing cases. Indoors, he built model villages on table tops, with houses of wood or cardboard, trees, and hedges. Larger public buildings were made of blocks, and these model cities were peopled by toy soldiers. He enacted the entire history of such places, including their growth and decay or destruction. Often he tried, with the help of a synchronous historical chart, to reenact the story of a real place, either Roman, Baroque, or modern. After a week or so, he would tire of a model and replace it by another. Sometimes he built a toy railroad system, for which his indulgent elders furnished an abundance of trains, tracks, and ac­ cessories. At five or six, he wrote one of his first stories, “The Little Glass Bottle.” This juvenile trifle, less than two hundred words long, begins: “'Heave to, there’s something floating to the leeward’ the speaker was a short stockily built man whose name was William Jones. He was the captain of a small cat boat. . . .” The floating object turns out to be a bottle containing a note, which reads: ‘“I\n\nNIGHT-CAUNTS\n\n27\n\nam John Jones who writes this letter my ship is fast sinking with a treasure on board I am where it is marked* on the enclosed chart’” Tire captain and his crew sail to the place east of Australia shown on the chart. A diver fetches up another bottle, this time of iron. It holds another note: “ ‘Dear Searcher excuse me for the practical joke I have played on you but it serves you right . . .’ ” Captain Jones, understandably vexed, exclaims: “‘I’d like to kick his head off!’ ” No great work of art, the story shows, by its mere existence, that its youthful author was already apprenticing himself in the storytellers’ trade. Another early effort, which no longer exists, was “The Noble Eavesdropper,” about “a boy who overheard some horrible conclave of subterranean beings in a cave.”4 If Lovecraft was an odd child, his mother showed signs of becoming even odder. In fact, she gave evidence that Lovecraft’s peculiarities were largely her doing. She got the idea that, for all his genius, her boy was ugly. She even told neighbors that he “was so hideous that he hid from everyone and did not like to walk upon the streets where people could gaze at him. . . . because he could not bear to have people look upon his awful face.”5 In truth, young Lovecraft was a perfectly normal-looking child. As he matured, he showed in exaggerated form his mother’s promi­ nent nose and long chin. Despite his “lantern jaw,” he was rather personable in his bony way. The child was, however, aware of his mother’s opinion, and this knowledge doubtless encouraged his nocturnal habits. It also contributed to his shyness and timidity towards women. Before Sonia Greene became his fiancée, he said to her: “How can any woman love a face like mine?” Late in life, he wrote: “Nobody among my progenitors was as rotten-looking as I am. ... I am a sort of parody, or caricature, facially of my mother & maternal uncle.” According to Lovecraft, in childhood he suffered from a tendency to chorea (St. Vitus's dance), which manifested itself in uncon­ trollable facial tics and grimaces. As chorea minor usually does, this nervous disorder disappeared in time; but it may have laid the foundation for Susie’s obsession.® Furthermore, chorea minor is now held to be a result of rheumatic fever, which often recurs periodically.\n\n28\n\nLOVECRAFT\n\nIt is therefore highly likely that Lovecraft suffered one or more bouts of rheumatic fever.\n\nSusan did not neglect her son’s culture. She took him to his first play at six. He acquired a toy theater, to which he added cardboard scenery and characters of his own make. He penciled programs, like one headed: DRURY-LANE THEATRE Novr 1779 The Company prefents a Comedy by Mr. Sheridan, intitul’d THE CRITICK; OR, A TRAGEDY REHEARS’D During the Christmas season of 1897, when Lovecraft had just turned seven, he saw a Saturday matinée of Shakespeare’s Cymbeline at the Providence Opera House. Enraptured, he at once added Shakespearean plays to his repertory. He read lines and moved toy figures about his miniature stage. Susie also took her son to symphonic concerts. When he seemed to show interest in music, she hired a violin teacher, Mrs. Wilhelm Nauck. The results at first were promising; the pupil had an excellent sense of time and pitch. For two years, from 1897 to 1899, he dutifully sawed away on his junior-sized fiddle and became adept enough to play a solo by Mozart before an audience of friends and neighbors. Never one to submit easily to tedious discipline, Lovecraft came more and more to hate the drudgery of violin practice. Despite the classical exposure, he remained indifferent to Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms. The only music that he really liked consisted of cunent popular tunes, such as In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree, Sweet Adeline, and Bedelia, or the music of operettas like those of Gilbert and Sullivan. When, at nine, Lovecraft developed a nervous condition that led to withdrawal from school, the family physician recommended stopping the violin lessons. Lovecraft never played the violin again. Classical music, with a few exceptions like Wagner’s Ride of the Valkyries and Saint Saëns’s Danse Macabre, which he liked for their associations, remained a blind spot. He sometimes wished that he could appreciate such music. His indifference to it is curious in view\n\nNIGIIT-GAUNTS\n\n29\n\nof his eighteenth-century fixation, since during that century, of all the arts, music made the most striking advances. The boy was also taken to plays by Wilde and Pinero. Lovecraft was not taken to the circus, because the family thought that his nerves could not endure the crowds, the smells, and the loud noises.7 In later years, sinus troubles blunted his hypersensitivity to odors, and he gradually overcame his fear of loud noises. But he never got rid of his terror of crowds. In 1897, Lovecraft’s Aunt Annie married Edward Francis Gamwell (1869-1936), who had been an instructor in English at Brown and then managing editor of the Atlantic Medical Weekly of Providence. At the time of his marriage, Gamwell was city editor of the Chronicle of Cambridge, Massachusetts. He lived the rest of his life in Cambridge and in Boston, where he worked as editor, advertising agent, and free-lance writer. In 1898, Annie bore a son, Phillips Gamwell, and in 1900 a daughter who lived a few days only. In 1916 her son, an amiable, promising youth, died of tuberculosis. Meanwhile Edward Gamwell had become a heavy drinker. Annie left him to return to Providence, where she worked at several jobs including librarian. In the 1890s, Aunt Lillian (who at one time taught school) became engaged to Dr. Franklin Chase Clark (1847-1915), who had been a pupil of Oliver Wendell Holmes. Clark, however, could not marry while he had aged parents to support. He and Lillian Phillips were not united until 1902, when she was forty-five and he, fifty-four. Not surprisingly, they had no children.\n\nOn July 19, 1898, Winfield Scott Lovecraft, aged forty-four, died in Butler Hospital. After a private funeral, he was buried in Swan Point Cemetery, next to the Butler Hospital grounds. His death had little effect on Howard Lovecraft, to whom his father remained a shadowy figure. Winfield Lovecraft left an estate of $10,000—a respectable legacy for the time. He also left his son his fine raiment: his black coats and vests, striped trousers, Ascot tics, and silver-headed walk­ ing stick. H. P. Lovecraft not only kept these garments but also, when he grew into them, wore them, although by that time they were long out of date.\n\n3°\n\nLOVECRAFT\n\nIn the fall of 1898, Lovecraft, going on eight, entered the primary school on Slater Avenue, north of Angell Street.8 Being somewhat nearsighted, he began wearing eyeglasses and continued to do so off and on all his life. In 1925, finding the glasses irritating to his nose and ears, he took to going without them most of the time, donning them only when he wished a clear view of something distant, as at a play or a lecture. During the school year of 1899-1900, Susie Lovecraft withdrew her son from the Slater Avenue School, supposedly for illness. Speak­ ing of this withdrawal, Lovecraft’s friend Cook said: “I shall always believe that it was his mother and not he that was sick—sick with fear of losing her sole remaining link to life and happiness.” There does seem to have been more to it than Susie’s neurotic fear that her genius of a son was too nervous and sensitive to bear the rigors of public schooling. Perhaps this was the time of his rheumatic fever. A quarter-century later, Lovecraft wrote: . . . my hypersensitive nerves reacted on my bodily functions to such a degree as to give the appearance of many different physical illnesses. Thus I had a very irregular heart action—badly affected by physical exertion—and such acute kidney trouble that a local practitioner would have operated for stone in the bladder had not a Boston specialist given a sounder diagnosis & traced it to the nervous system. . . . Then, too, I had frightful digestive trouble— all, probably, caused by malfunctioning nerves—besides atrocious sick-headaches that kept me flat 3 or 4 days out of every week. I still have headaches now and then—of the unexplained sort known as migraine—though they don’t compare with what I used to have.\n\nHe was also subject to terrifying dreams, which he described, the brackets being Lovecraft’s: When I was 6 or 7 I used to be tormented constantly with a pecul­ iar type of recurrent nightmare in which a monstrous race of en­ tities (called by me “Night-Gaunts”—I don’t know where I got hold of the name) used to snatch me up by the stomach [bad di­ gestion?] & carry me off through infinite leagues of black air over the towers of dead & horrible cities. They would finally get me into a grey void where I could see the needle-like pinnacles of enormous mountains miles below. Then they would let me drop—& as I gained momentum in my Icarus-like plunge I would start awake in such a panic that I hated to think of sleeping again. The \"nightgaunts” were black, lean, rubbery things with horns, barbed tails, bat-wings, and no faces at all. Undoubtedly I derived the image\n\nNIGHT-GAUNTS\n\n31 from the jumbled memory of Doré drawings (largely the illustra­ tions to “Paradise Lost”) which fascinated me in waking hours. They had no voices & their only form of real torture was their habit of tickling my stomach [digestion again] before snatching me up & swooping away with me. I somehow had the vague notion that they lived in the black burrows honeycombing the pinnacle of some incredibly high mountain somewhere. They seemed to come in flocks of 25 or 50, & would sometimes fling me one to the other. Night after night I dreamed the same horror with only minor variants—but I never struck those hideous mountain peaks before waking.8 In most respects, young Lovecraft seemed physically normal, but he obviously suffered from what are now called psychosomatic ills, aggravated by his mother’s nervous fears and apprehensions. He shed oblique light on his boyhood conditions in a later story, wherein he told of a fictional character much like himself:\n\nHe was the most phenomenal child scholar I have ever known, and at seven was writing verse of a sombre, fantastic, almost morbid cast which astonished the tutors surrounding him. Perhaps his private education and coddled seclusion had something to do with his premature flowering. An only child, he had organic weaknesses which startled his doting parents and caused them to keep him closely chained to their side. He was never allowed out without his nurse, and seldom had a chance to play unconstrainedly with other children. All this doubtless fostered a strange secretive inner life, with imagination as bis one avenue of freedom.10\n\nWhatever the reason—neurotic illness, bullying, his mother’s frantic over-protectiveness, or some combination of these—he was taken out of school. At first he was taught at home by his mother, his grandfather, and his Aunt Lillian. Then tutors, including one A. P. May, were hired. Lovecraft was out of school for over two years. During this time, in addition to his tutorial lessons, he read voraciously. He read the boys’ adventure novels of authors like George A. Henty, Edward S. Ellis, and Kirk Munroe. He devoured the adventures of a pair of fictional detectives, Old King Brady and Young King Brady, in Secret Service and other dime novels. “Then,” he recollected, “I struck Edgar Allan Poe!! It was my downfall, and at the age of eight I saw the blue firmament of Argos and Sicily darkened by the miasmal exhalations of the tomb!”\n\nLOVECRAFT 32 Poe remained his lifelong enthusiasm and the strongest single in­ fluence upon him. He also learned about sex:\n\nIn the matter of the justly celebrated “facts of life” I didn’t wait for oral information, but exhausted the entire subject in the medi­ cal section of the family library . . . when I was 8 years old— through Quain’s Anatomy (fully illustrated and diagrammed), Dunglinson’s Physiology &c. &c. This was because of curiosity & perplexity concerning the strange reticences & embarrassments of adult speech, & oddly inexplicable allusions & situations in standard literature. Tire result was the very opposite of what parents gen­ erally fear—for instead of giving me an abnormal & precocious in­ terest in sex (as unsatisfied curiosity would have done), it virtually killed my interest in the subject. The whole matter was reduced to prosaic mechanism—a mechanism which I rather despised or at least thought non-glamourous because of its purely animal nature & separation from such things as intellect & beauty—& all the drama was taken out of it.11\n\nHe was still reading writers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and their translations of Graeco-Roman classics. These inspired him to attempt an epic in the same style. Called The Poem of Ulysses, or the New Odyssey, it began: The night was dark, O reader Ilark, and see Ulysses’ fleet; All homeward bound, with Vict'ry crowned, he hopes his spouse to greet; Long hath he fought, put Troy to naught, and levell'd down its walls, But Neptune’s wrath obstructs his path, while into snares he falls . . ,12 Lovecraft also resumed his experiments in prose. One such effort is “The Secret Cave or John Lees Adventure” (1898), beginning:\n\n“Now be good children,” said Mrs. Lee “While I am away & don’t get into mischief.” Mr. & Mrs. Lee were going off for the day & to leave the two children John 10 yrs old & Alice 2 yrs old “Yes” replied John. . . .\n\nTo make a short story shorter, John and Alice explore the cellar. A wall gives way, revealing a tunnel. They enter the tunnel and find a small box. When they try to dig into the end of the tunnel, water bursts in, drowning the sister. John escapes with the corpse and the box. When the latter is opened, “. . . they found it to be a solid gold chunk worth about $10,000 enough to pay for anything but the death of his sister. End.”13\n\nNIGHT-GAUNTS\n\n33\n\nIn 1898 or 1899 came \"Tire Mystery of the Grave-Yard or ‘A Dead Man’s Revenge.’ ” HPL’s narrative technique had developed to the point of dividing the story into twelve chapters—but these are only about fifty to a hundred words long. Still, the story, over five hundred words of it, shows more staying power on the author’s part:\n\nIt was noon in the little village of Mainville, and a sorrowful group of people were standing around the Bums’s Tomb. Joseph Bums was dead. (When dying, he had given the following strange order:— \"Before you put my body in the tomb, drop this ball onto the floor, at a spot marked “A’’.” He then handed a small golden ball to the rector.) . . .\n\nThe rector, Mr. Dobson, follows orders but disappears. Dobson’s daughter calls the police station and cries “ ‘Send King John’! King John was a famous western detective.” The kidnapper flees, but he and his minions are arrested as they are about to take ship for Africa. At the trial, Dobson reappears, telling of his imprisonment in a vault beneath the tomb. It was a plot on the part of the dead man and his brother against Dobson.14 Caves, crypts, cellars, and tunnels featured Lovecraft’s fiction all his life. One more story survives from this juvenile period: “The Mysterious Ship,” subtitled “The Royal Press 1902.” Lovecraft was beginning to think of the mechanics of publishing. This story, less than five hundred words, is divided into nine chapters. Some of these, however, are only a sentence or two long, so that the existing work is an outline rather than a story. It tells of the kidnapping of three men by a villainous Latin, who takes them to the Arctic in a submarine. “At the N. Pole there exists a vast continent composed of volcanic soil, a portion of which is open to explorers. It is called ‘No-Mans Land.’ ”15 Tire polar regions, like underground chambers and passages, held a lasting fascination for Lovecraft. The young author neatly printed these stories by hand and bound the pages together. He wrote other stories, too, but at eighteen looked them over and found them so repulsive that he destroyed all but a few rescued by his mother. They were, he said, written “in a Johnsonese that only a pedant of the 1810 period could equal.” The stories were actually no worse than most such\n\n34\n\nLOVECRAFT\n\npuerile efforts, but authors are wont to take a hypercritical view of their own juvenilia.\n\nBefore Lovecraft went further in his fictional apprenticeship, a new interest seized him. The Phillips library included a Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary of 1864. In those days, Webster’s Unabridged had a rear section wherein the illustrations appearing in the body of the text were repeated, grouped in categories. In 1898, Lovecraft pored over these pictures. The mythological section drew him first, and his interest in astronomy was first stimulated by the Classical myths attached to the constellations. Then he immersed himself in “antiquities, medi­ aeval dress & armour, birds, animals, reptiles, fishes, flags of all na­ tions, heraldry, &c. &c.” He became hypnotized by the section on “Philosophical and Scientific Instruments’’ and avidly studied the cuts of “retorts, alembics, aeolipiles, cryophori, quadrants, anemom­ eters, crucibles, telescopes, microscopes, & what not else.” To the boy, these instruments had magical meaning, for he had come upon pic­ tures of similar devices in fairy tales of alchemists and astrologers. The chemical instruments so beguiled him that he resolved to have his own laboratory. In March, 1899, a cellar room was put at his disposal. His Aunt Lillian bought him some simple apparatus and a copy of The Young Chemist by Prof. John Howard Appleton of Brown University, a friend of the family. Soon Lovecraft was happily puttering in his crypt, making smokes, stenches, and an occasional minor explosion and drawing alchemical symbols on the walls.16 By the fall of 1902, aged twelve, Lovecraft was thought well enough to go back to school. He entered the sixth grade at the Slater Avenue School. Here he continued for two years, with with­ drawals for “nerves” and the help of tutors to make up lost time. He now succeeded in being a more social being than at almost any time in his life. He apparently suffered some bullying and teasing, to combat which he assumed a “tough guy” pose. The boys nicknamed him “Lovey,” which he understandably hated. He re­ called : I had some fairly rough fights (from which I would not retreat, but in which I almost always got the worst except when I managed to frighten my foe through a dramatically murderous expression & voice) till I was 16 or 17 . . . the “by God, I’ll kill you!” stuff.\n\nNIGIIT-GAUNTS\n\n35 Still, he made some friends, notably the brothers Chester Pierce Munroe (1889-1943) and Harold Bateman Munroe (1891-1966); the three Banigan brothers, whose family gave him two tiny green statuettes of Irish antiquity; and several others. He persuaded his friends to help him to build a model village in a nearby vacant lot. The boys formed a “Slater Avenue Army,” “whose wars were waged in the neighbouring woods, & though my dramatic suggestions were not always accepted with perfect tolerance, I managed to get along with my ‘fellow-soldiers’ fairly well. . . .” He and Chester Munroe claimed the joint title of the worst boys in the Slater Avenue School, “not so actively destructive as merely antinomian in an arrogant & sardonic way—the protest of individuality against capricious, arbitrary & excessively detailed authority.”17 Having become an avid reader of Sherlock Holmes, Lovecraft joined his friends in a “Providence Detective Agency”: Our force had very rigid regulations, & carried in its pockets a standard marking equipment consisting of a police whistle, magni­ fying-glass, electric flashlight, hand cuffs, (sometimes plain twine, but “handcuffs” for all that!) tin badge, (I have mine still!!) tape measure, (for footprints) revolver, (mine was the real thing, but Inspector Munroe (aet 12) had a water squirt-pistol while Inspec­ tor Upham (aet 10) worried along with a cap-pistol) & copies of all newspaper accounts of desperate criminals at large—plus a paper called “The Detective”, which printed pictures & descrip­ tions of outstanding “wanted” malefactors. Did our pockets bulge & sag with this equipment? I’ll say they did!! We also had elabo­ rately prepared “credentials”—certificates attesting our good stand­ ing in the agency. Mere scandals we scorned. Nothing short of bank robbers and murderers were good enough for us. We shad­ owed many desperate-looking customers, & diligently compared their physiognomies with the “mugs” in The Detective. . . . Our headquarters were in a deserted house just out of the thickly set­ tled area, and there we enacted, and “solved”, many a gruesome tragedy. I still remember my labours in producing artificial “blood­ stains on the floor!!!”18\n\nLovecraft also formed the percussion section of another boyish group, the Blackstone Military Band. While he beat the drum with his hands, he worked the cymbals with one foot and the triangle­ beater with the other, at the same time blowing the zobo, a little brass horn held in the teeth. He engaged with his friends in secret orgies of smoking. Having thus proved his manhood, at fourteen he gave up tobacco for good.\n\n36\n\nLOVECRAFT\n\nIn later life, he claimed that lie found tobacco smoke nauseous; ‘To me the ultimate horror on earth is a smoking car.” In 1900, Lovecraft was given a bicycle, the first of three that he owned. In 1913, during a race with another boy, he took a bad spill and broke his nose. In later life he was sensitive about the damage to the member, although his photographs show no visible harm to it. lie also had a black cat, Nigger-Man, to whom he was devoted. Altogether, he remembered these years as the happiest time of his life. Amid these normal boyish activities, Lovecraft continued his intellectual progress. He read all the novels of Jules Verne that he could get his hands on. His interest in chemistry widened to include geography and astronomy. He was introduced to astronomy by his Aunt Lillian’s long-outdated textbooks on the subject. At twelve, he began adding his own up-to-date astronomical books to the collec­ tion. The library also included books inherited from several lines of forebears, going back to the eighteenth century, when printers still used the “long s”(f). In 1899, Lovecraft began a handwritten periodical, the Scien­ tific Gazette, of which he made one original and (usually) four carbon copies for family and friends. Soon he “discovered the myriad suns and worlds of infinite space.” Then the Scientific Gazette was joined by the Rhode Island Journal of Astronomy. Both were published intermittently to 1909. The Scieritific Gazette was devoted largely to chemistry, consisting for the most part of paraphrases of passages from Lovecraft’s chemical textbooks. The other publication contained facts about the positions of the heavenly bodies, notices of Lovecraft’s own astronomical observations, and summaries of newspaper stories of such events as the discovery of Jupiter’s eighth satellite in 1908. In February, 1903, Lovecraft got his first telescope. This was a 99-cent instrument with papier-mache tubes, from a mail-order house. The following July, his mother gave him a better 2.25-inch telescope, with 50- and 100-power eyepieces, costing $16.50. For $8.00 lie had a tripod mount made by a local craftsman. In 1906 he acquired his third telescope, a three-inch refractor, from Montgomery Ward, for $50. He still had this device, battered and corroded, more than thirty years later.\n\nNIGHT-GAUNTS\n\n37 From 1903 on, Lovecraft spent many nights stargazing. Another academic friend of the family, Prof. Winslow Upton of Brown University, gave him the run of the Ladd Observatory, located on one of the highest points of College Hill a mile from the Phillips home. Here he was allowed to look through the twelve-inch refractor. Lovecraft spent many hours peering into the eyepiece of a telescope; he claimed his later habit of cocking his head to the side resulted from this activity. He also got a microscope, two spectroscopes, and a spinthari­ scope for observing the effect of radioactivity. Had events not inter­ fered, Lovecraft might well have become an adult scientist or at least a teacher of science. From 1900 on, the Phillipses suffered mounting financial trou­ bles. The failure of the dam on the Snake River in Idaho put Whip­ ple Phillips’s Owyhee Land and Irrigation Company in peril. Under Phillips’s energetic direction, a second dam was begun. This, too, collapsed, bringing the Owyhee Company to the verge of ruin. Whipple Phillips, the president and treasurer of the company, res­ olutely instituted drastic economies at home. At first young Lovecraft, carefully sheltered from stress, hardly noticed. When the groom was dismissed and the horses and carriage were sold, he rejoiced in having the whole barn to himself, to use as a playroom and clubhouse:\n\nMy array of toys, books, and other youthful pleasures was virtually unlimited; and I doubt if I ever thought of such a thing as varying prosperity or the instability of fortune. The poor were simply curious animals about whom one spoke insincerely and to whom one gave money, food, and clothing . . . like the “heathen” about whom the church people were always talking. Money as a definite conception was wholly absent from my horizon.\n\nBut Lovecraft had liked the horses and later regretted that they had been sold before he had a chance to learn to ride. As more ser­ vants were let go, a hint of impending doom at last reached even HPL’s unworldly consciousness; “my spirits were dampened by a vague sensation of impending calamity.” Aunt Lillian had married Doctor Clark on April 10, 1902, leaving the big house to Whipple Phillips, his widowed daughter, and his grandson. Then, on the evening of Sunday, March 27, 1904, Whipple\n\n38\n\nLOVECRAFT\n\nPhillips was visiting a political crony, Alderman Gray. There be was seized by a “paralytic shock.”19 The following day, shortly before midnight, he died, aged seventy, at his home. He left $5,000 to each of his three daughters and $2,500 to each of his two grandsons, Howard Phillips Lovecraft and Phillips Gam­ well. FIPL also fell heir to his grandfather’s collection of guns. The rest of Whipple Phillips’s estate was to be distributed equally among his four children, but aside from some interests in Rhode Island quarries there was not much to distribute. Without Phillips’s driving force to keep it going, the Owyhee Land and Irrigation Company was soon liquidated, and the mansion at 454 Angell Street was sold. It became a rookery of physicians’ offices and, in 1961, was torn down to make way for an apartment­ house development.\n\nSPOILT GENIUS O’er the midnight moorlands crying, Through the cypress forests sighing, In the night-wind madly flying, Hellish forms with streaming hair; In the barren branches creaking, By the stagnant swamp-pools speaking, Past the shore-cliffs ever shrieking; Damn’d demons of despair.1 Lovecraft\n\nSusie Lovecraft and her adolescent son moved to a house three blocks east of the Phillips mansion: Number 598-600 Angell Street. They rented the ground floor, which bore the number 598. Although the new quarters had five rooms, besides the use of attic and base­ ment, the move gave young Lovecraft a staggering shock:\n\nFor the first time I knew what a congested, servantless house —with another family in the same house—was. There was a vacant lot next door (although even that was later built up—during my adulthood), which I promptly exploited as a landscape garden and adorned with a village of piano-box houses, but even that failed to assuage my nostalgia. I felt that I had lost my entire adjustment to the cosmos—for indeed what was HPL without the remembered rooms & hallways & hangings & staircases & statuary & paintings\n\nLOVECRAFT\n\n... & yards & walks & cherry-trees & fountain & ivy-grown arch & stable & gardens & all the rest? How could an old man of 14 (& I surely felt that way!) readjust his existence to a skimpy flat & new household programme & inferior outdoor setting in which almost nothing familiar remained? It seemed like a damned futile busi­ ness to keep on living. . . . My home had been my ideal of Para­ dise & my source of inspiration—but it was to be profaned by other hands. Life from that day has held for me but one ambition —to regain the old place & reestablish its glory—a thing I fear I can never accomplish.2 To crown Lovecraft’s sorrow, about this time his beloved cat, Nigger-Man, disappeared.\n\nWhat a boy he was! I watched him grow from a tiny black handful to one of the most fascinating & understanding creatures I’ve ever seen. He used to talk in a genuine language of varied intonations —a special tone for every different meaning. There was even a special “prrr’p” for the smell of roast chestnuts, on which he doted. He used to play ball with me—kicking a large rubber sphere back at me from half across the room with all four feet as he lay on the floor. And on summer evenings in the twilight he would prove his kinship to the elfin things of shadow by racing across the lawn on nameless errands, darting into the blackness of the shrubbery now & then, & occasionally leaping at me from ambush & then bounding away again into invisibility before I could catch him.3\n\nIn his intense territoriality, Lovecraft was rather catlike himself; he once said: “I have a veritably feline interest in & devotion to places.” Perhaps Nigger-Man disliked the move as much as his master did and simply refused to stay in the new quarters. In any case, Lovecraft never kept another pet. For most young people, adolescence is a time of stress, when thoughts of suicide are common. It hit the over-protected Lovecraft with devastating force: No more tutors—high-school next September which would probably be a devilish bore, since one couldn’t be as free & easy in high school as one had been during the brief snatches at the neighbourly Slater Ave. school. . . . oh, hell! Why not slough off consciousness altogether? The whole life of man & of the planet was a mere cos­ mic second—so I couldn’t be missing much. The method was the only trouble. I didn’t like messy exits, & dignified ones were hard to find. Really good poisons were hard to get—those in my chemi­ cal laboratory (I reestablished this institution in the basement of the new place) were crude & painful. Bullets were spattery and un-\n\nSPOILT GENIUS\n\n41 reliable. . . . Well—what tempted me most was the warm, shal­ low, reed-grown Barrington River down the east shore of the bay. I used to go there on my bicycle & look speculatively at it. (That summer [of 1904] I was always on my bicycle—wishing to be away from home as much as possible, since my abode reminded me of the home I had lost.) How easy it would be to wade out among the rushes & lie face down in the warm water till oblivion came. There would be a certain gurgling or choking unpleasantness at first—but it would soon be over. Then the long peaceful night of non-existence. . . . what I had enjoyed from the mythical start of eternity till the 20th of August 1890. What revoked this plan was not so much the normal urge of self-preservation as another strain in Lovecraft’s nature: intellectual curiosity. Where most people lust for the physical pleasures of food, drink, and sex, Lovecraft lusted for knowledge:\n\nAnd yet certain elements—notably scientific curiosity & a sense of world drama—held me back. Much in the universe baffled me, yet I knew I could pry the answers out of books if I lived & studied longer. Geology, for example. Just how did these ancient sediments & stratifications get crystallised & upheaved into granite peaks? Geography—just what would Scott & Shackleton & Borchgrevingk find in the great white antarctic on their next expeditions . . . which I could—if I wished—live to see described? And as to his­ tory—as I contemplated my exit without further knowledge I be­ came uncomfortably conscious of what I didn’t know. Tantalising gaps existed everywhere. When did people stop speaking Latin & begin to talk Italian & Spanish & French? What on earth ever hap­ pened in the black Middle Ages in those parts of the world other than Br"
