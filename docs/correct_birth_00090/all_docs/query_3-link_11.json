        "text": "As a fan and user of fountain pens this is a beautiful pen. It is a smooth flowing pen. This is a pen that I would wholeheartedly gift to any teacher, librarian, journalist, author, or anyone you know who does any volume of writing. While the barrel and cap are plastic, they do have metal fittings (same with the nib assembly), I have used fountain pens with a plastic barrel and nib assembly (the nib itself is metal) and these seem to be susceptible to having the threads easily stripped of you over tighten the nib assembly into the barrel, this pen with the metal I see this as being less likely to happen. I have yet to use the converter as I already have a bunch of ink cartridges that fit, I will admit this converter seems to be a nicer one then the ones I have used in the past.\n\nThis is a definite highly recommended item. I can see myself getting a couple more so that I can have different color ink in each one for creating prop documents for a Call of Cthulhu game.\n\nThis collection of maps checks off all the boxes for me as a collector of Maps and a Call of Cthulhu Keeper/Investivgator. All maps are of the expected high quality that has one had come to expect from the HPLHS for their prop documents. These look equally great framed on the wall or spread out on the gaming table during a CoC game. While I already had the Innsmouth map from the DART Shadow over Innsmouth show, it is nice to see they kept the scratch and sniff feature (a great trick to pull on the unexpected player, tell them that the map they are given or found has some perfume on it from a beautiful Innsmouth gal). Other maps whole at first glance might look like a regular map, upon closer inspection you will see Lovecraft related locations.\n\nWhile these patches were smaller them I was expecting (my fault as I didnt read the description for the size) this actually works out for the better as it will allow room for additional patches to be sewn/ironed on to that ever you attach these too. Myself I am planning on putting them on the sleeve of one of the MU Varsity Hoodies, with another set being ordered to go on a heavy duty canvas Messenger style bag that I use to carry my Call of Cthulhu Keepers Rule book, Keeper Screen and Investigators Handbook in for when I am going to a gaming session.\n\nBe it on a jacket. hoodie, or bag these will look great and hopefully will be a eye catcher to introduce the works of Lovecraft to potentially future cultists, err I mean Fans."
