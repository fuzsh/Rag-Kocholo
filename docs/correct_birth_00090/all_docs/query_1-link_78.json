        "text": "Rise and fall to Insanity of the man who revolutionized Horror.\n\nA name synonymous with horror and science fiction, the first person to come up with genres like cosmic horror and eldritch terror. Born in the late 19th century, Lovecraft’ works outlasted his time, introducing his readers to a universe that’s indifferent and hostile towards them.\n\nA Life Begins With Struggles\n\nLovecraft was born in 1890 in Providence, Rhode Island. His father died early in his life due to psychosis induced from syphilis, his mother later on suffered from psychosis too. This set a precedent for his future struggles. The impactful presence of his grandfather, a successful businessman and avid storyteller, inspired Lovecraft’s rich imagination. This fueled his interest in literature, inspiring him to create his unique style. Lovecraft was constantly sick and socially distant, leading him to self-tutor himself. Due to his unconventional education, he gained a passionate interest in learning about astronomy. This perspective impacted his writings. His early works, although starting with poetry, soon delved into genre’s of fantasy and horror. This will be the start of an inspiring and unfortunate literary career.\n\nThe Beginning of a Literary Career\n\nLovecraft found his true calling, going from poetry to fiction. He had a short period in journalism that helped him improve and learn how to connect with his contemporaries. Thus, this chapter of his life led to him becoming a pinnacle of horror literature.\n\nLovecraft’s Writing Style and Themes\n\nLovecraft’s style is easily recognizable. He uses a blend of dense description and an atmosphere of impending doom. He tends to explore themes of cosmic horror, humanity’s insignificant place in the universe, and the existence of ancient, malevolent entities incomprehensible to us. This set a new standard in horror writing, breaking all boundaries of the genre. Penning creatures beyond our grasp.\n\nCosmic Impact\n\nH.P Lovecraft’s influence on popular media through this century can be easily seen in multiple literature and media works. The Cthulhu Mythos, a collection of fictional mythology introduced through his work Call of Cthulhu depicts horrific beings far beyond human understanding making contact with humans. The stories are told from multiple accounts but the foreboding dread of these cosmic horrors are ever present and looming. The story builds upon the truth of human insignificance and breaks apart the characters psyche. In the face of these Eldritch horrors we inevitably are nothing.\n\nHis other work The Shadow over Innsmouth delves in the idea of an isolated community and corruption of the human form. A seaside town where, in secrecy, all the residents are half-human half-amphibian hybrids. It delves deeply into the degradation of human morality and psyche when closed off from society. A primal sense of claustrophobia, impending doom and paranoia is ever present.\n\nHis works truly peek deeply into the most primal yet incomprehensible fears of humanity. Rather using generic troupes of blood, gore and death, he depicts a fate worse than death, something maddening. While other more popular horror stories are lost to history, his works and influence are still timeless references of horror fiction, inspiring a plethora of authors like Stephen King. Works like The Call of Cthulhu and The Shadow over Innsmouth have not only garnered a cult following but have also significantly impacted the horror genre’s narrative style.\n\nA Broken Psyche\n\nWhile Lovecraft’s revolutionized horror and science fiction, we cannot discuss his legacy without addressing the controversies that plagued his life. His self-isolation and troubled upbringing led him to harbor horrendous views. In his works explicit racism and xenophobic ideologies are a constant sight. He feared the unknown to the point of fearing anyone different to him. Widespread criticism and debate started on whether he should be seen with respect.\n\nYet, we cannot disregard his impact on literature, he has shaped multiple genres to what it is now.\n\nA Dreadful End\n\nH.P. Lovecraft’s true genius lies in his ability to create universes filled with mystery and insanity. His stories, set in realms where the horrifying unknown creeps at every corner, captivate and terrify us. Despite his own inner darkness and madness, his impact remains unquestionable. At the end of Lovecraft’s life he died in isolation living in fear of the world. An unfortunate end to someone marred with brilliance and madness. He never became a rich and renowned writer during his lifetime, rather his works admirers continued his legacy. Thus, cementing him as one the first Existentialist writers in fiction.\n\nHis legacy can be summarized through Stephen King’s words:\n\nho“I think it is beyond doubt that H. P. Lovecraft has yet to be surpassed as the twentieth century’s greatest practitioner of the classic horror tale.”"
