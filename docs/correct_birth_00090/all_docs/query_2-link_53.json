        "text": "H.P. Lovecraft's influence on pop culture has exploded in recent years. But why? Erik Davis is a cultural critic and the author of the essay, \"Calling Cthulhu: H.P. Lovecraft's Magickal Realism.\" He fell under Lovecraft's spell as a teenager.\n\nH.P. Lovecraft may have been a great writer, but he was also, undeniably, a racist. This pretty much ruins him for a lof of readers, and writers. Gemma Files is a Canadian horror writer and one of the people who has a problem with Lovecraft because of his racism.\n\nThink that it's too soon to get your kids hooked on H.P. Lovecraft's cosmic horror? Think again. They might be enchanted by \"The Call of Cthulhu for Beginning Readers\" by Richard Ivankovic, alias Doctor Faustus AS.\n\nAlthough Jeff VanderMeer's work may seem to have a Lovecraftian influence, VanderMeer says that's not the case. He actually thinks weird fiction needs to move out from the shadow of Lovecraft's incredible influence. He introduces us to one writer who is doing that -- Thomas Ligotti, \"the best kept secret in contemporary horror fiction.\""
