Lovecraft birthplace (see 454 Angell Street, at the excellent H. P. Lovecraft Archive)\n\nLovecraft's home from 1904 to 1924 (see 598 Angell Street, at the excellent H. P. Lovecraft Archive)\n\n\"William Harris, at last thoroughly convinced of the radically unhealthful nature of his abode, now took steps toward quitting it and closing it forever. Securing temporary quarters for himself and wife at the newly opened Golden Ball Inn, he arranged for the building of a new and finer house in Westminster Street, in the growing part of the town across the Great Bridge. There, in 1785, his son Dutee was born; and there the family dwelt till the encroachments of commerce drove them back across the river and over the hill to Angell Street, in the newer East Side residence district, where the late Archer Harris built his sumptuous but hideous French-roofed mansion in 1876.\" -- The Shunned House"
