        "text": "Located in the gorgeous, historic Arcade building in downtown Providence, Lovecraft Arts and Sciences is a bookstore and visitor center featuring exclusive goods and ephemera, plus a selection of books, original art, artifacts and prints related to the weird fiction genre â€“ a unique blend of science fiction, horror and fantasy which was born here in Providence, Rhode Island. Weird fiction was first coined by local author H.P. Lovecraft in the early twentieth century but is now a growing phenomenon manifested in the writings, art, films and games of many creators around the world today. As a center for scholars, authors and fans of weird fiction, we foster a vibrant and diverse global weird fiction and art community, and to provide a home for this community. Our flagship biennial convention, NecronomiCon Providence, is attended by thousands of people from more than twenty countries. The draw of weird fiction daily brings visitors to Providence, the birthplace of Weird."
