        "text": "In the early years of the 20th century, unless you were a follower of pulp magazines that trafficked in fantasy, horror, and early sci-fi, Howard Phillips Lovecraft’s fiction was written and largely ignored. His work only gained steam after he died in 1937, as his disciples published and elaborated on work and ideas he began. Filmmakers followed, rarely adapting Lovecraft directly but liberally utilizing his themes in their work.\n\nLovecraft the person lived a tumultuous life under the thumb of a mentally ill mother, marrying once (unhappily) and moving from his native Providence to Brooklyn, New York, which he hated. Lovecraft had friends, writers with whom he shared great correspondences, but for the most part his life was one of grievance and pain; he was convinced of his work’s worth but never saw it appreciated as it would be in later years.\n\nA few words on Lovecraft’s work. It’s generally regarded as the earliest example of “cosmic” horror, tackling themes such as nature’s indifference to man and the unknowability of what lies beyond our world. In Lovecraft’s fiction, malevolent forces care little for our wellbeing, and mammoth, many-tentacled creatures from other worlds with names like Cthulhu, Yog-Soggoth, and Shub-Niggurath live below us on Earth. The very notion that our world contains monsters hellbent on the destruction of our species is often enough to drive Lovecraft’s protagonists insane. Those not driven mad by the concept are resigned to join the creatures in the conquest, forming cults around the beasts and carrying out sacrifices in order to keep them at bay.\n\nIt’s a bleak worldview, one that only becomes more malign when considering that Lovecraft, who died of intestinal cancer at the age of 46, was a notorious racist and xenophobe, qualities which emerge none-too-subtly in his writing. He wasn’t a Nazi, exactly, just a few steps down, and though apologists have made reference to the fact that he had Jewish friends (and married one), it’s clear Lovecraft had a low tolerance for the racial or ethnic other. Any appreciation of Lovecraft has to make peace with this, just as one must acknowledge Ian Fleming’s misogyny when reading James Bond novels. It was part and parcel of the times. It doesn’t diminish the brilliance of the writing. It’s just worth noting.\n\nI came to appreciate Lovecraft through film, thanks to my Scare U podcast co-host Bradford Louryk, who slowly broke me in through films like Richard Stanley’s Color Out of Space (2019), Sam Raimi’s Evil Dead 2 (1987), John Carpenter’s In the Mouth of Madness (1995), and Jeremy Gillespie and Steven Kostanski’s The Void (2017). My interest piqued, I borrowed The Dunwich Horror from the library, then devoured, in fairly quick succession, Dagon, The Call of Cthuhlu, The Shadow Over Innsmouth, The Shadow Out of Time, and The Haunter of the Dark. None are easy going: Lovecraft is given to great elaboration when it comes to settings, his plots don’t exactly hurtle forward, and his descriptions can be downright repetitive. Perhaps this is why there have been so few successful adaptations of his work on film, Color Out of Space excepted. The stories are more about mood, menace, dread, and existential terror than plot and character. If you can get on Lovecraft’s wavelength, you’re in for a ride. If it’s momentum you want, read the graphic novel adaptations of I.N.J. Culbard.\n\nThe fact that I’m even reading Lovecraft is, on its face, remarkable. For most of my life, I avoided horror fiction and films, preferring more sanguine fare. What little horror I caught was almost by accident — a screening of Poltergeist here, a group outing to The Fly there — but they were more the exception. I enjoyed mysteries, thrillers, action, musicals. For several years, my favorite film was Mary Poppins. I didn’t seek out opportunities to be scared or grossed out. Consider, also, my upbringing: I was raised in Marblehead, Massachusetts, a colonial-era fishing village of around 20,000 that remains, to this day, The Cutest Town in America. My life was normal, conventional, even happy. I had friends. I got good grades. I did theater in high school. I had girlfriends and went on dates and had my first kiss and went to proms. During college, I held summer jobs in town. After I graduated, I lived briefly in Washington, then settled in New York — which, for the record, I don’t hate (and where, for the record, my Brooklyn apartment is about a fifteen-minute walk from where H.P. and Sonia lived).\n\nTo say I feel tied to Marblehead would be an understatement. At heart, I’m a small-town guy. I can make my way through the subway system as well as anyone, but it’s accompanied by the nagging sense that I’m pretending. It’s not unlike what I feel when I watch a horror film. Is this really me, who grew up in a quaint seaside hamlet reading the Hardy Boys and Agatha Christie? Is this who I am, or is it some kind of Imposter Syndrome?\n\nEveryone changes. Everyone evolves. Tastes, opinions, lifestyles. Still — and I admit this is something I should be discussing with a therapist, not whinging about in an essay — the imposter thing is hard to shake. Why? Probably because in my gut I’m still sixteen, roaming the streets of Marblehead, hanging out on friends’ boats, attending the Arts Festival, going on dates at the late, great King’s Rook, and drinking cheap beer on docks. Probably because I was raised on family-friendly blockbusters like Star Wars and Indiana Jones at the local two-screen cinema. And yet here I am, a resident of this frightening, exhilarating, exhausting, fabulous, depressing city for almost thirty years. And yet I co-host a podcast about films I wouldn’t be caught dead seeing ten years ago.\n\nH.P. Lovecraft’s work takes place primarily in and around New England — though it’s largely a New England of his own devising. Existing cities and towns appear throughout, complemented by locations Lovecraft invented, with names like Dunwich, Innsmouth, Kingsport, and Arkham. Some are based on real places, others are amalgams of towns Lovecraft knew about. Lovecraft’s bigotry comes out most acutely in his descriptions of these places; even though they’re in an area he loved, it’s often peopled by “lowly” types Lovecraft would have avoided at all costs.\n\nTo wit: of Dunwich, Lovecraft’s narrator writes: Outsiders visit Dunwich as seldom as possible, and since a certain season of horror all the signboards pointing toward it have been taken down… Two centuries ago, when talk of witch-blood, Satan-worship, and strange forest presences was not laughed at, it was the custom to give reasons for avoiding the locality. In our sensible age — since the Dunwich horror of 1928 was hushed up by those who had the town’s and the world’s welfare at heart — people shun it without knowing exactly why. Perhaps one reason — though it cannot apply to uninformed strangers — is that the natives are now repellently decadent, having gone far along that path of retrogression so common in many New England backwaters. They have come to form a race by themselves, with the well-defined mental and physical stigmata of degeneracy and inbreeding. The average of their intelligence is woefully low, whilst their annals reek of overt viciousness and of half-hidden murders, incests, and deeds of almost unnamable violence and perversity. The old gentry, representing the two or three armigerous families which came from Salem in 1692, have kept somewhat above the general level of decay; though many branches are sunk into the sordid populace so deeply that only their names remain as a key to the origin they disgrace.\n\nOf Innsmouth, Lovecraft’s narrator writes: It was a town with a portentous dearth of visible life. From the tangle of chimney-pots scarcely a wisp of smoke came, and the three tall steeples loomed stark and unpainted against the seaward horizon. One of them was crumbling down at the top, and in that and another there were only black gaping holes where clock-dials should have been. The vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of wormy decay, and as we approached along the now descending road I could see that many roofs had wholly caved in… We met no one on the road, but presently began to pass deserted farms in varying stages of ruin. Then I noticed a few inhabited houses with rags stuffed in the broken windows and shells and dead fish lying about the littered yards. Once or twice I saw listless-looking people working in barren gardens or digging clams on the fishy-smelling beach below, and groups of dirty, simian-visaged children playing around weed-grown doorsteps.\n\nSo what made Lovecraft happy, one might ask? Well, Providence, for one. “Though Lovecraft was not widely appreciated during his prolific but brief writing career, his love for and connection to his Rhode Island hometown were near absolute,” wrote Noel Rubinton in a 2016 New York Times article. “When he wasn’t writing, Lovecraft was known for taking long walks. His fiction, full of high-styled descriptions based on many Providence places, shows that he must have been looking and thinking hard on those rambles.”\n\nAnd Lovecraft’s second favorite place in New England?\n\nI’ll let Lovecraft himself tell you, in a letter he wrote to a friend:\n\nI can’t picture anything more delightful in America than one of the quaint colonial seaports on the New England coast, which have been sleeping almost unchanged for a century or more. If I weren’t attached to Providence by nativity and lifelong residence, I’d like to live in ancient Marblehead, Mass. (SL II.78)\n\nAs an admirer of Lovecraft’s work, if not the man himself, this came as a delightful shock. And Lovecraft didn’t just say nice things here and there. He was positively gaga about the place. In another letter, he wrote:\n\nMarblehead is a garland of unending delights — one could live there rapturously forever, discovering new wonders each day… little corners where graceful vines creep, curious bits of sunken garden where vivid flowers bloom and where exotic stone images lurk amidst the grass, marvelous doorways carved two hundred years ago by beauty-loving sailors and having rough stone steps flanked by conch shells brought from the Far Hesperides… the past… the past… Verily, here alone survives the maritime New-England of yesterday, with the glamour of ships and salt winds of eighteenth-century voyages. On this occasion I stayed in Marblehead until nine-thirty p.m., when candles shone thro’ small pan’d windows, revealing old-world paneled interiors and ancient fireplaces and mantels… a trip I hardly remember, so full was it of antique dreams and pictures of narrow lanes and gables and chimneys in old and glamorous seaports. (SL. I. 237)\n\nBetween 1922 and 1936, Lovecraft visited Marblehead around twenty times, and the town was referenced (as Kingsport) in his 1923 story The Festival. Several locations in Lovecraft’s story map to points of interest in Marblehead*, such as St. Michael’s Episcopal Church, Old Burial Hill, Fort Sewall, the area around Abbot Hall, and the Jeremiah Lee Mansion, one of the town’s finest examples of colonial architecture. About the mansion, Lovecraft gushed, I came nigh to fainting at its sheer BRITANNICK magnificence. No fumbling provincial workmanship here, but sumptuous carvings, mantels, balustrades, and wainscoting, made by the finest artisans of OLD ENGLAND, and wrought in solid mahogany. You must see them! The luxuriously perfect artistry of every line of this classical abode leaves the spectator virtually breathless! (SL I.235)\n\nIt’s gobsmacking to think that this crank, this misanthrope who held humanity in such low regard, whose characters were driven mad upon recognizing their insignificance, who spent most of his life bemoaning his lack of success, derived such pleasure from a place that’s brought me happiness for over five decades. I don’t agree with Lovecraft’s worldview or philosophy, and God knows I don’t condone his attitudes. And yet the kinship is there. He turns the pretender in me into a recognizable being. Lovecraft — the man and the writer — makes me feel everyone has the capacity in them for change, for holding conflicting views on life, location, and personhood.\n\nAs I make my way through his work, wandering the streets of Innsmouth with its dilapidated architecture and haggard, fish-faced residents, I think of my hometown, and how Lovecraft, upon seeing it for the first, fourth, or eighteenth time, was struck dumb by its beauty. I read of Dunwich, its secretive, whispering residents and strange, unearthly rumblings, and I see Lovecraft goggling over the same harbor that’s held me in its thrall all these years. I think of these things and something inside me breaks free. I’m not an imposter anymore."
