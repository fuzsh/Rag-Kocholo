        "text": "Films of High Adventure: H.P. Lovecraft\n\nFilms of High Adventure: H. P. Lovecraft by Bob Brinkman The Films of High Adventure series examines the impact that the authors of Appendix N have had on the world at large. This time out, we’re upping the spookiness of Halloween with an article on all of Lovecraft’s works that have made their way to the big (or small) screen. The works of H. P. Lovecraft are among the most frequently adapted of any Appendix N author. To date, I’m aware of over 700 film and television offerings that either directly adapt or are heavily inspired by Lovecraft. As you can well imagine, that is a bit more than I can cover in a single column. As an Appendix N author, the weird darkness of Lovecraft’s work is profoundly inspirational and provides solid groundwork for both adventures and campaigns. While his dreamlike imagery can be difficult to bring to the screen, that hasn’t stopped filmmakers from creating 700+ attempts. Here then, are just a sampling of the more notable ones. The Haunted Palace (1963) Billed as being based upon the works of Edgar Allen Poe, this movie is, in fact, based on The Case of Charles Dexter Ward. Starring both Lon Chaney Jr. and Vincent Price (an actor capable of elevating anything he appeared in), one might think this the perfect movie. However, having been directed by Roger Corman, this gothic-style telling of Lovecraft’s story draws heavily from Corman’s Poe adaptations—which is its undoing. Charles Dexter Ward inherits an estate from an unknown ancestor with sinister designs. From there, the yawns begin! This movie simply doesn’t feel like a Lovecraft tale. It lacks horror, or even tension. While it is a nice-looking film, it is a flat telling of the story that leaves the viewer with a faint sense of ennui—if feeling anything at all. Utterly, and bitterly, disappointing. Now, compare this film to… The Resurrected (1991) Dan O’Bannon directs this adaptation of The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, starring Chis Sarandon in the dual role of Charles Dexter Ward and Joseph Curwen. On every facet upon which The Haunted Palace fell flat, this film succeeds—and even excels. Rather than technicolor dreaminess, The Resurrected opts for a more grimy, visceral approach. This time, the wife of Charles Dexter Ward hires a PI to investigate why her husband is behaving...\n\nAdventures in Fiction: H.P. Lovecraft\n\nOur Adventures in Fiction series is meant to take a look at the writers and creators behind the genre(s) that helped to forge not only our favorite hobby but our lives. We invite you to explore the entirety of the series on our Adventures In Fiction home page. Today we celebrate the birthday of HP Lovecraft, one of the most influential authors of the 20th Century. In honor of this day, we re-present the Adventures in Fiction about his influence on D&D and, of course, Dungeon Crawl Classics. Adventures in Fiction: H.P. Lovecraft by Jon Hook H. P. Lovecraft was born in his family home in Providence, Rhode Island. Lovecraft was an only child with few childhood friends. He lived a solitary life with his mother. His connection to the world was through books, pulp magazines, and the numerous correspondences he wrote to the authors and editors of those magazines. Lovecraft is recognized as one of the greatest letter writers of the twentieth century, and some of his regular correspondents were Robert Bloch, Robert E. Howard, and Clark Ashton Smith. Gary Gygax named H. P. Lovecraft as one of the immediate influences in the Dungeon Masters Guide’s Appendix N. Lovecraft is best known for the creation of the alien god, Cthulhu, from the short story “The Call of Cthulhu” published in Weird Tales in 1928 (and be sure to check out our collection of reprints featuring Lovecraft’s works). Cthulhu is but one of many alien creatures that are perceived as gods by men; some writers that followed in Lovecraft’s footsteps have even tried to organize the gods into a pantheon. The debate on whether it was Lovecraft’s intention for there to be a pantheon rages on to this day. After publishing the Players Handbook for Advanced D&D in 1978, Gary chose to relax by writing some adventure modules. The first was D-1: Descent into the Depths of the Earth. Along with drow, rust monsters, and molds, this module also featured two mind flyers, also known as illithids. These psionic creatures are cunning and manipulative. Gary said that his inspiration for the illithids came from the cover of Brian Lumley’s The Burrowers Beneath, a novel grounded in the Cthulhu Mythos. Illithids have the same tentacled octopoid head as Great Cthulhu himself. The following module, D-2: Shrine of the Kuo-Toa featured the first appearance..."
