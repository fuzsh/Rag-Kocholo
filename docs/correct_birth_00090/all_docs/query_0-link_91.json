        "meta_description": "1 review and 3 photos of H.P. LOVECRAFT MEMORIAL SQUARE \"I am a fortunate soul who has experienced lots of horror in this journey. Starting with \"The curse of the Mummy\", \"Dracula\" and other horror films as a child (no PG ratings, hello!), and actors like Peter Cushing, Vincent Price and Christopher Lee, I was catapulted into 80's horror like \"Poltergeist\" and \"Creepshow\" and still no puberty. Tough childhood, I tell you. I have also done a good deal of horror reading, E.A. Poe, H.G. Wells, and then more modern Stephen King and all the sci-fi horror, I don't know why but that is the case. Yet, of all these movies, actors and writers (I am leaving out a lot), H.P. Lovecraft is the man.\n\nI had no idea that he was a Providence resident. I saw some bookstores, but didn't connect the dots until his name kept popping up on the Goggle Maps. Even more funny, I was parked just a few feet away from this plaque, aka memorial square, looking at my phone. I did have to get out and snap a shot. And there really is not much satisfaction derived from this, but at the same time, to be in his hometown, driving past some of the places that inspired him to write his stories is pretty cool. \n\nThe plaque is located at the intersection of Prospect St. and Angell St. \n\nSupposedly he was born in a house in this corner, and that house is now gone. And also, he supposedly lived a few feet away in an apartment building nearby. I am not a researcher, just a fan, and the least I can do is lead others to this plaque, a memorial commissioned to sculptor Gage Prentiss and placed there in the year 2013.\"",
