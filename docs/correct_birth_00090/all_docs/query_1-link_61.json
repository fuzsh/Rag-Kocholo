        "text": "Howard Phillips Lovecraft was born on August 20, 1890, in Providence, Rhode Island. While not a particularly successful writer in his own lifetime, he is now considered one of the most influential American horror writers and a key figure in the development of “cosmic horror”.[1] Today, Lovecraft is often compared to Edgar Allan Poe[2] for their respective impacts on American fiction.[3] The fact that both of Lovecraft’s parents were institutionalized[4]certainly shaped his world view and may offer insights into his own mental stability.[5]\n\nLovecraft could read by the time he was three years old and began writing at the age of seven. He would later work as a journalist and editor before turning to fiction writing, publishing his first short story in 1915. Lovecraft was a popular writer within his genre, but never broke out to wider success and failed to earn enough from writing to support himself. His greatest literary output was as a letter-writer, having produced an estimated 100,000 letters over his lifetime, which was not all that long. Lovecraft died young at 47 on March 15, 1937, still in Providence.[6]\n\nAs with the Old Ones he often wrote about,[7] Lovecraft’s stories refused to die. The American publisher Arkham House[8] was established by Lovecraft’s close friends to help ensure that his works remained in print, starting in 1939 with the anthology The Outsider and Others. Over the years, Lovecraft’s work has had a far-reaching effect. According to The Atlantic, “people who’ve never read a page of his work will still know who Cthulhu is for years to come,[9] and his legacy lives on in the work of Stephen King, Guillermo del Toro, and Neil Gaiman,” along with John Carpenter, Roger Corman, and H.R. Giger (creature designer for Alien). There are now well over 300 features, shorts, television programs, podcasts, and games based on, or in some way inspired by, the writings of H.P. Lovecraft. There is even a “Lovecraftian” horror sub-genre. For comparison, IMDb lists 91 works attributed to the stories of Ernest Hemingway and only 73 for F. Scott Fitzgerald, including the movie scripts Fitzgerald wrote himself.[10] The majority of Lovecraft’s published writings are short stories, so it follows that many of the related audiovisual works are short films. In turn, many of those received their premiere at the H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival and CthulhuCon, established in 1995 and dedicated to “the works of H.P. Lovecraft, literary horror, and weird tales.”\n\nWith so many Lovecraft programs to choose from, it’s difficult to know where to start. For advice, we turned to the Internets where we found Paste magazine’s “10 Essential Movies Based on H.P. Lovecraft Works”[11] and “20 of the Best Lovecraftian Horror Movies,” Movieweb’s “The Best H.P. Lovecraft Movie Adaptations,” and Screenrant’s “10 Best H.P. Lovecraft Movie Adaptations.” Their collective recommendations appear in bold in the list of Lovecraft-inspired shows presented below along with their EIDR IDs.\n\n[1] Defined as, “The idea that the universe is an alien and dangerous place, incomprehensible to most sane people,” as demonstrated in Lovecraft’s stories filled with “protagonists who encounter horrible beings from outside our world, resulting in horror, insanity, and death.”\n\n[2] Both Lovecraft and Poe followed a similar path – they lived mostly in obscurity, died in poverty, and now enjoy considerable posthumous literary fame.\n\n[3] During his lifetime, Lovecraft was published mostly in pulp magazines, which limited his exposure to the literary community. Scholarly review of Lovecraft’s writing did not begin until the 1970s.\n\n[4] His father in 1893 and his mother in 1919. His father’s insanity may have been caused by late-stage syphilis.\n\n[5] Lovecraft suffered from numerous “near breakdowns” or “nervous collapse,” as he called them.\n\n[6] He spent a few years in New York City, but hated it. He hated many things. He was a rather ardent racist and antisemite.\n\n[7] Including Cthulhu (pronounced kuhTHOOloo).\n\n[8] Which took its name from Lovecraft’s fictional town of Arkham Massachusetts. The famed Arkham Asylum in Batman’s Gotham City also takes its name from Lovecraft.\n\n[9] And the Necronomicon, Lovecraft’s fictional grimoire (book of magic) that made its first appearance in the short story “The Hound” in 1922. According to Lovecraft’s “History of the Necronomicon” (published posthumously in 1938), the book was originally written c. 739 in Arabic by Abdul Alhazred of Damascus(when it was called Al Azif). In 950 it was translated into Greek by Theodorus Philetas of Constantinople (and retitled Necronomicon). In 1228, the Danish scholar Olaus Wormius translated the book into Latin. The Patriarch Michael of Constantinople (an historical figure of early Christianity) tried and failed to destroy all copies of the book in 1050. The original Arabic version is now lost. At least one failed attempt was made to translate it into English, while various fragments and several complete copies of the Greek and Latin versions surface from time to time in Lovecraft’s stories and in the works of numerous other authors since.\n\n[10] Poe beats them all with 439 IMDb writing credit citations to Lovecraft’s 242, though that does not count works inspired by (but not directly adapted from) Lovecraft’s stories and amateur productions that run a bit fast and loose with their credits citations.\n\n[11] Focused on works presented at the H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival and CthulhuCon.\n\nH.P. Lovecraft Filmography"
