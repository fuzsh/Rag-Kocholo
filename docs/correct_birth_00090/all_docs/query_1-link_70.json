        "text": "Transferred use of the surname of an English noble family. The surname has a large number of possible origins, but in the case of the noble family early forms often have the spelling Haward, and so it is probably from a Scandinavian personal name derived from hÄ âhighâ + varÃ°r âguardianâ. (The traditional derivation from the Old English name Hereweard âarmy guardianâ is untenable.) It is now a widespread given name."
