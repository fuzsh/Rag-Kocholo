        "text": "The following quotes come from Lovecraft’s fiction, poems, essays, and letters. Wikiquote has over 125 quotations and Andrew M. Kuchling’s web site has over 300 H.P. Lovecraft Quotes.\n\nMy name is Jervas Dudley, and from earliest childhood I have been a dreamer and a visionary.\n\n(“The Tomb”, June 1917)\n\nI will tell only of the lone tomb in the darkest of the hillside thickets; the deserted tomb of the Hydes, an old and exalted family whose last direct descendant had been laid within its black recesses many decades before my birth.\n\n(“The Tomb”, June 1917)\n\nI have seen beyond the bounds of infinity and drawn down daemons from the stars. . . . I have harnessed the shadows that stride from world to world to sow death and madness. . . .\n\n(“From Beyond”, 16 November 1920)\n\nSearchers after horror haunt strange, far places. For them are the catacombs of Ptolemais, and the carven mausolea of the nightmare countries. They climb to the moonlit towers of ruined Rhine castles, and falter down black cobwebbed steps beneath the scattered stones of forgotten cities in Asia. The haunted wood and the desolate mountain are their shrines, and they linger around the sinister monoliths on uninhabited islands. But the true epicure in the terrible, to whom a new thrill of unutterable ghastliness is the chief end and justification of existence, esteems most of all the ancient, lonely farmhouses of backwoods New England; for there the dark elements of strength, solitude, grotesqueness, and ignorance combine to form the perfection of the hideous.\n\n(“The Picture in the House”, 12 December 1920)\n\n“That is not dead which can eternal lie,\n\nAnd with strange aeons even death may die.”\n\n(“The Nameless City”, January 1921)\n\nBut I cannot help seeing beyond the tinsel of humour, and recognising the pitiful basis of jest—the world is indeed comic, but the joke is on mankind.\n\n(“[In Defence of Dagon]: The Defence Remains Open!”, April 1921)\n\nThat same night saw the beginning of the second Arkham horror—the horror that to me eclipsed the plague itself.\n\n(“Herbert West—Reanimator”, early October 1921 to mid-June 1922)\n\nMy coming to New York had been a mistake; for whereas I had looked for poignant wonder and inspiration in the teeming labyrinths of ancient streets that twist endlessly from forgotten courts and squares and waterfronts to courts and squares and waterfronts equally forgotten, and in the Cyclopean modern towers and pinnacles that rise blackly Babylonian under waning moons, I had found instead only a sense of horror and oppression which threatened to master, paralyse, and annihilate me.\n\n(“He”, 11 August 1925)\n\nThe oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.\n\n(“Supernatural Horror in Literature”, November 1925 to May 1927)\n\nThe one test of the really weird is simply this—whether or not there be excited in the reader a profound sense of dread, and of contact with unknown spheres and powers; a subtle attitude of awed listening, as if for the beating of black wings or the scratching of outside shapes and entities on the known universe’s utmost rim.\n\n(“Supernatural Horror in Literature”, November 1925 to May 1927)\n\nWell—the train sped on, & I experienced silent convulsions of joy in returning step by step to a waking & tri-dimensional life. New Haven—New London—& then quaint Mystic, with its colonial hillside & landlocked cove. Then at last a still subtler magick fill’d the air—nobler roofs & steeples, with the train rushing airily above them on its lofty viaduct—Westerly—in His Majesty’s Province of RHODE-ISLAND & PROVIDENCE-PLANTATIONS! GOD SAVE THE KING!! Intoxication follow’d—Kingston—East Greenwich with its steep Georgian alleys climbing up from the railway—Apponaug & its ancient roofs—Auburn—just outside the city limits—I fumble with bags & wraps in a desperate effort to appear calm—THEN—a delirious marble dome outside the window—a hissing of air brakes—a slackening of speed—surges of ecstasy & dropping of clouds from my eyes & mind—HOME—UNION STATION—PROVIDENCE!!!!\n\n(Letter to Frank Belknap Long, 1 May 1926)\n\nI am Providence, & Providence is myself—together, indissolubly as one, we stand thro’ the ages; a fixt monument set aeternally in the shadow of Durfee’s ice-clad peak!\n\n(Letter to James Ferdinand Morton, 16 May 1926)\n\nThe most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.\n\n(“The Call of Cthulhu”, August or September 1926)\n\nPh’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn.\n\n(In his house at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.)\n\n(“The Call of Cthulhu”, August or September 1926)\n\nWonder had gone away, and he had forgotten that all life is only a set of pictures in the brain, among which there is no difference betwixt those born of real things and those born of inward dreamings, and no cause to value the one above the other.\n\n(“The Silver Key”, early November 1926)\n\nWest of Arkham the hills rise wild, and there are valleys with deep woods that no axe has ever cut. There are dark narrow glens where the trees slope fantastically, and where thin brooklets trickle without ever having caught the glint of sunlight. On the gentler slopes there are farms, ancient and rocky, with squat, moss-coated cottages brooding eternally over old New England secrets in the lee of great ledges; but these are all vacant now, the wide chimneys crumbling and the shingled sides bulging perilously beneath low gambrel roofs.\n\nNow all my tales are based on the fundamental premise that common human laws and interests and emotions have no validity or significance in the vast cosmos-at-large. To me there is nothing but puerility in a tale in which the human form—and the local human passions and conditions and standards—are depicted as native to other worlds or other universes. To achieve the essence of real externality, whether of time or space or dimension, one must forget that such things as organic life, good and evil, love and hate, and all such local attributes of a negligible and temporary race called mankind, have any existence at all. Only the human scenes and characters must have human qualities. These must be handled with unsparing realism, (not catch-penny romanticism) but when we cross the line to the boundless and hideous unknown—the shadow-haunted Outside—we must remember to leave our humanity—and terrestrialism at the threshold.\n\n(Letter to Farnsworth Wright, 5 July 1927)\n\nThe Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be. Not in the spaces we know, but between them, They walk serene and primal, undimensioned and to us unseen. Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth.\n\n(“The Dunwich Horror”, August 1928)\n\nMan rules now where They ruled once; They shall soon rule where man rules now. After summer is winter, and after winter summer. They wait patient and potent, for here shall They reign again.\n\n(“The Dunwich Horror”, August 1928)\n\nIt moves me most when slanting sunbeams glow\n\nOn old farm buildings set against a hill,\n\nAnd paint with life the shapes which linger still\n\nFrom centuries less a dream than this we know.\n\nIn that strange light I feel I am not far\n\nFrom the fixt mass whose sides the ages are.\n\nI certainly do not disagree with you concerning the essential solitude of the individual, for it seems to me the plainest of all truths that no highly organised and freely developed mind can possibly envisage an external world having much in common with the external world invisaged by any other mind.\n\n(Letter to August W. Derleth, 19 or 26 December 1930)\n\nIt is absolutely necessary, for the peace and safety of mankind, that some of earth’s dark, dead corners and unplumbed depths be let alone; lest sleeping abnormalities wake to resurgent life, and blasphemously surviving nightmares squirm and splash out of their black lairs to newer and wider conquests.\n\n(At the Mountains of Madness, 24 February to 22 March 1931)\n\nThere was a kind of intoxication in being lord of a visible world (albeit a miniature one) and determining the flow of its events.\n\n(Letter to J. Vernon Shea, 8 November 1933)\n\nO Floridian More Fortunate than you can Realise...\n\n(Letter to Robert H. Barlow, 10? February 1934)"
