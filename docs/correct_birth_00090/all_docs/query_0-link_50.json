        "text": "On this day in horror history, legendary horror writer Howard Phillips Lovecraft was born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1890.\n\nBest known for creating the Cthulhu Mythos, his other tales include The Call of Cthulhu, The Dunwich Horror, and At the Mountains of Madness.\n\nLovecraft made efforts to support his ill wife through regular jobs but lacked marketable skills due to hardly ant previous work experience.\n\nNow regarded as one of the most significant horror authors ever, he was pretty much unknown during his lifetime. Never able to support himself from earnings as an author, Lovecraft died in poor at 46.\n\nFilms based on Lovecraft’s writings include Roger Corman’s The Haunted Palace, Daniel Haller’s The Dunwich Horror, David Keith’s The Curse, Dan O’Bannon’s The Resurrected, and Richard Stanley’s Color Out of Space.\n\nAnd let’s not forget Stuart Gordon’s contributions such as Stuart Gordon’s Dagon (based on The Shadow over Innsmouth) and Re-Animator, From Beyond, and Castle Freak with Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton.\n\nWhat’s your favorite Lovecraft yarn?
