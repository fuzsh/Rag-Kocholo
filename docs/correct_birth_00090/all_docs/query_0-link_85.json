        "text": "(1890–1937). American author H.P. Lovecraft wrote fantastic and macabre short novels and stories. He was one of the 20th-century masters of the Gothic tale of terror.\n\nHoward Phillips Lovecraft was born on August 20, 1890, in Providence, Rhode Island. He became interested in science when he was a child, but poor health prevented him from attending college. Lovecraft made his living as a ghostwriter and rewrite man and spent most of his life poor and alone. His fame as a writer increased after his death."
