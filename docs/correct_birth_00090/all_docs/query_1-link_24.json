        "text": "Howard Phillips Lovecraft, known as HP Lovecraft, is a major figure in horror literature and science fiction. Born in 1890 in Providence, Rhode Island, Lovecraft developed a unique and influential literary style that redefined the horror genre. Given his introverted personality and solitary life, Lovecraft created a dark and terrifying universe filled with supernatural horrors. His stories introduced a new type of terror based on the unknown and the unthinkable, rather than conventional monsters. Its cosmic creatures and gods have inspired numerous authors, artists and filmmakers across generations.\n\nDespite his lasting influence, Lovecraft lived in the obscurity of poverty and anonymity during his lifetime. It was only after his death in 1937 that his work was fully recognized and appreciated for its literary genius. His best-known work, “The Call of Cthulhu”, has become emblematic of the Cthulhu mythos, a fictional pantheon of alien beings, deities and monsters, incorporating themes of madness, cosmic horror and insignificance of humanity within the universe. Today, Lovecraft is considered one of the greatest authors in the horror genre and his legacy can be found in many aspects of popular culture, whether it be literature, cinema or video games. His talent for bringing to life the terror of the unknown and the impossible elevated horror to an art level and influenced generations of writers. Its spooky, sprawling world continues to fascinate and frighten readers around the world.\n\nHoward Phillips Lovecraft, famous American writer of the early 20th century, comes from a complex genealogy. Born in 1890 in Providence, Rhode Island, he came from a family of diverse origins. On his father’s side, Lovecraft is descended from the first English settlers who arrived in New England in the 17th century. Her father, Winfield Scott Lovecraft, was of English, Dutch, and Scottish ancestry, while her mother, Sarah Susan Phillips Lovecraft, was of English, Scottish, and French ancestry. Lovecraft also has an interesting maternal ancestry, his mother being the daughter of a couple whose father was of Scottish origin and the mother from a French family established in North America for several generations.\n\nLovecraft’s genealogy is often marked by unions between privileged Anglo-Saxon families in New England, who also had ties to other wealthy families in the region. We therefore find alliances with families with names such as Hazard, Phillips, Phillips-Smith, Angell, Burges, Lovecraft and many others. Overall, Lovecraft’s genealogy presents a complex tree, testifying to his deep-rooted roots in New England, where stories of pioneers, colonization, and folk superstitions certainly contributed to the development of his vivid imagination and his unique literary universe."
