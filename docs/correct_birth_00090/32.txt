In his final years, Lovecraft was barely able to support himself. He took editing and ghostwriting work to try to make ends meet.

EPISODES

Bobby visits a Lovecraft enthusiast, Judah. When he asks about the date that Moishe Campbell visited Lovecraft, Judah tells him about the dinner party Lovecraft held on that day attended by six friends who Judah describes as "co-worshippers in a black magic cult." They perform a ritual to open a door to an alternate dimension. They think it hasn't worked, but each of them die or disappear within a year. Unbeknownst to them, a creature has come through and possesses Lovecraft's maid Eleanor. Only her 9-year-old son Westborough realizes this, and he is not believed but committed to a psychiatric institution.
