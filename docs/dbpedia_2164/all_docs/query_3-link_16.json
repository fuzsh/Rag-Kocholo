        "text": "Planet Earth III is coming to our television screens soon and judging by the trailer below it looks like it's going to be a fabulous series. The trailer hints that the series will not only celebrate the creatures that call Earth home, but also highlight the challenges and crises they face.\n\nWho will be presenting Planet Earth III?\n\nAs with Planet Earth (2006) and Planet Earth II (2016), the new series will be presented by Sir David Attenborough.\n\nMike Gunton Executive Producer said, ‘Planet Earth wouldn’t be Planet Earth without David, so I’m delighted he is presenting the third series. As ever, he has brought his huge enthusiasm and wisdom, has been encouraging about our new perspective and has, I know, really enjoyed seeing the extraordinary new wonders brought to the screen.\n\n‘The opening of the series with David was filmed in the beautiful British countryside in exactly the location where Charles Darwin used to walk whilst thinking-over his Earth-shaking ideas about evolution. It seemed the perfect place for David to introduce Planet Earth III and remind us of both the wonders and the fragility of our planet. ….and for him, of course, the sun shined under blue skies one of the only days it did all summer!.’\n\nWill Planet Earth III rate among David Attenborough's best-ever documentaries? If it lives up to this trailer the answer has to be a resounding yes.\n\nSir David Attenborough – key moments in his career so far\n\nBest David Attenborough books\n\nWhen is Planet Earth III on television?\n\nPlanet Earth III starts on Sunday 22 October\n\nHow can I watch Planet Earth III?\n\nPlanet Earth III will shown on BBC One and BBC iPlayer in the UK\n\nHow many episodes of Planet Earth III are there?\n\nThere will be 8 episodes of Planet Earth III, each an hour long.
