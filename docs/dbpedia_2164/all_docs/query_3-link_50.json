Along with a unique cast of residents as colorful as their own whimsical world, the four friends play, explore, imagine and celebrate daily in their joyful town of Sagoville.

Frog is a frog. Toad is a toad. They have a lot in common … but they are also very different. Frog and Toad are best friends who know that the true secret to friendship is not only enjoying the things you have in common, but embracing the things that make you different. Since our differences are what makes us special, Frog and Toad celebrate what makes them unique!\n\nThe talented voice cast includes Academy Award winner Nat Faxon (\"Our Flag Means Death,\" \"The Connors\") and Emmy Award nominee Kevin Michael Richardson (\"The Simpsons,\" \"Family Guy\") as Frog and Toad, as well as appearances by Ron Funches (\"Trolls\"), Fortune Feimster (\"Good Fortune,\" “Kenan”), Cole Escola (\"At Home with Amy Sedaris\"), Aparna Nancherla (\"The Great North\"), John Hodgman (\"Up Here\"), Yvette Nicole Brown (\"Disenchanted,\" “Act Your Age”), Stephen Tobolowsky (\"The Goldbergs\"), Emmy Award nominee Tom Kenny (\"SpongeBob SquarePants\"), Selene Luna (\"Coco\"), Emmy Award nominee Margaret Cho (“Fire Island”) and Betsy Sodaro (\"Duncanville\").\n\nNow Streaming on Apple TV+\n\n“Earth At Night In Color”\n\nA landmark natural history series narrated by Tom Hiddleston, “Earth At Night In Color” uses next-generation cameras to reveal the nocturnal lives of animals, in color, for the first time ever. Filmed across six continents, from the Arctic Circle to the African grasslands, this pioneering series follows the moonlit dramas of animals at night, revealing new insights and never-before-seen behaviors. “Earth At Night In Color” is produced by Offspring Films. The series is executive produced by Alex Williamson and Isla Robertson, and produced by Sam Hodgson.\n\n“The Elephant Queen”\n\nEmbark on an epic journey of family, courage and coming home. “The Elephant Queen” is a genre-crossing wildlife documentary, uniquely crafted as a character-driven narrative. Its enduring themes are built upon a foundation of authenticity and integrity, brought from filmmakers Mark Deeble (“Voyage of Time”) and Victoria Stone’s (“The Queen of Trees”) 60 years of collective experience in the rich tradition of wildlife documentary filmmaking and production. Deeble and Stone, who are Emmy and Peabody Award winners, spent 25 years living in the East African bush, preparing them for the unforgettable odyssey of “The Elephant Queen.”\n\nThe Elephant Queen is Athena, a majestic elephant matriarch, who leads her family across an unforgiving, yet cinematic natural landscape made up of grasslands and woodlands, dotted with seasonal waterholes. The elephants share their home with a cast of supporting character species who provide texture and richness to the elephants’ ecosystem – from a toenail height perspective. Athena, as leader of her herd, anticipates the coming dry season and knows there are lean times ahead. As the waterholes dry up, she has no choice but to take her family on a treacherous journey across even more foreboding landscapes, as the majestic creatures seek refuge until the rains fall again.\n\n“Extrapolations”\n\n“Extrapolations,” from executive producer Scott Z. Burns, is a bracing limited series that introduces a near future where the chaotic effects of climate change have become embedded into our everyday lives. Eight interwoven stories about love, work, faith and family from across the globe will explore the intimate, life-altering choices that must be made when the planet is changing faster than the population. Every story is different, but the fight for our future is universal. Are we brave enough to become the solution to our own undoing before it’s too late?\n\nThe series features an all-star cast including Yara Shahidi, Kit Harington, Daveed Diggs, Matthew Rhys, Heather Graham, Sienna Miller, Tahar Rahim, Meryl Streep, David Schwimmer, Neska Rose, Judd Hirsch, Cherry Jones, Edward Norton, Michael Gandolfini, Indira Varma, Diane Lane, Adarsh Gourav, Gaz Choudhry, Keri Russell, Gemma Chan, Marion Cotillard, Forest Whitaker, Hari Nef, Eiza González, Tobey Maguire, Ben Harper, Murray Bartlett and MaameYaa Boafo.\n\n“Five Days at Memorial”\n\n“Five Days at Memorial” is a powerful limited series based on actual events and adapted from the book of the same name. From Academy Award winner John Ridley and Emmy Award winner Carlton Cuse, who both also serve as directors, and starring an award-winning ensemble cast that includes Vera Farmiga, Cornelius Smith Jr. and Emmy Award winner Cherry Jones, “Five Days at Memorial” chronicles the impact of Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath on a local hospital. When the floodwaters rose, power failed and heat soared, exhausted caregivers at a New Orleans hospital were forced to make decisions that would follow them for years to come.\n\n“Here We Are: Notes for Living on Planet Earth”\n\n“Here We Are: Notes for Living on Planet Earth” is a television event based on the New York Times bestselling book and TIME Best Book of the Year by Oliver Jeffers. The animated short film features a star-studded voice cast including Academy Award and Golden Globe-winning Meryl Streep, Emmy Award-winning and BAFTA-nominated Chris O'Dowd, SAG Award nominee and Critics’ Choice Award-winning Jacob Tremblay and Oscar nominee Ruth Negga.\n\nThe captivating, animated family film follows a precocious 7-year-old (voiced by Tremblay) who, over the course of Earth Day, learns about the wonders of the planet from his parents (voiced by O’Dowd and Negga) — and from a mysterious exhibit at the aptly titled Museum of Everything. Meryl Streep narrates.\n\nPeanuts Classics “It’s Arbor Day, Charlie Brown”\n\nCelebrate the environment with the Peanuts Classics special from Mendelson/Melendez Productions, “It’s Arbor Day, Charlie Brown.’’ To celebrate Arbor Day, Charlie Brown’s baseball team turns the field into a lush garden, throwing Peppermint Patty off her game.\n\n“Prehistoric Planet”\n\nFrom executive producers Jon Favreau and Tim Gunton, BBC Studios Natural History Unit (“Planet Earth”), and narrated by Sir David Attenborough, “Prehistoric Planet” transports viewers 66 million years in the past to discover our world — and the dinosaurs that roamed it — all in stunning detail and set to an original score by multiple Academy Award winner Hans Zimmer. The groundbreaking series combines award-winning wildlife filmmaking, the latest paleontological learning and state-of-the-art technology to unveil the spectacular habitats and inhabitants of prehistoric Earth for a one-of-a-kind immersive experience.\n\nSnoopy Presents “It’s the Small Things, Charlie Brown”\n\n“It’s the Small Things, Charlie Brown” follows Sally’s bond with a special little flower on the baseball field that may spell disaster for the big game. For Charlie Brown and the team, it’s just the inspiration they need to make a positive impact on their environment.\n\n“Stillwater” — Earth Day Special\n\nIn “One Drop Makes an Ocean,” Stillwater shows the kids his worm farm and other things he does to live green, which inspires them to come up with more ways to help Earth.\n\nPeabody and Daytime Emmy Award-winning series, “Stillwater,” centers on siblings Karl, Addy and Michael, who encounter everyday challenges — big and small — which sometimes feel insurmountable. Fortunately for these three, they have Stillwater, a wise panda, as their next-door neighbor. Through his example, stories and gentle humor, Stillwater gives the children a deeper understanding of their feelings as well as tools that help them face their own day-to-day challenges.\n\n“Stillwater” — New Shorts\n\nPrior to the May 19 launch of the third season of “Stillwater,” based on the award-winning and bestselling Scholastic book Zen Shorts by Jon J Muth, Apple TV+ premiered three all-new shorts on platform and made available for non-subscribers on Scholastic’s YouTube. Follow Jasper the cat in “Jasper’s Journey” on a mindful journey through Stillwater’s garden, join Stillwater in “Making Waves'' as he makes new patterns in his Zen garden, and watch Karl join Stillwater in “Breathing” to learn how breathing can help make him feel better when he has angry feelings.\n\n“Tiny World”\n\nNarrated by Paul Rudd, “Tiny World” takes a unique perspective on the natural world, exploring the ingenuity and resilience of the smallest animals on the planet. Brand new camera technology allows us, for the very first time, to see the world through the eyes of the tiniest creatures and witness the extraordinary things they do to survive.\n\n“The Year Earth Changed”\n\nShowcasing footage from around the world after an unprecedented year, “The Year Earth Changed” is a timely documentary special that takes a fresh new approach to the global lockdown and the uplifting stories that have come out of it. From hearing birdsong in deserted cities and seeing whales in Glacier Bay, to meeting capybara in suburbs across South America, people worldwide have had the chance to engage with nature like never before. In this documentary special, viewers will witness how the smallest changes in human behavior — reducing cruise ship traffic, closing beaches a few days a year, identifying more harmonious ways for humans and wildlife to coexist — can have a profound impact on nature. The documentary, narrated by David Attenborough, is a love letter to planet Earth, highlighting the ways nature’s resiliency and ability to bounce back can give us hope for the future.\n\nApple TV+ offers premium, compelling drama and comedy series, feature films, groundbreaking documentaries, and kids and family entertainment, and is available to watch across all your favorite screens.
