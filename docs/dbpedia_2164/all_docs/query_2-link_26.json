        "text": "The Science Learning Hub has lots of resources for primary teachers related to the night sky in the Planet Earth and Beyond strand of the New Zealand Curriculum.\n\nThe night sky is fascinating to talk about with children. It evokes a sense of wonder and mystery. Have a look through these resources for some ideas.\n\nSpace – viewing with our own eyes\n\nSpace – viewing with instruments\n\nVisiting space\n\nHow do we know what is out there?\n\nTātai arorangi\n\nGeneral information\n\nHeritage scientist – Beatrice Hill Tinsley\n\nCitizen science\n\nSpace – viewing with our own eyes\n\nBefore radio, television or GPS existed, people would look at the night sky as a means of entertainment, to tell stories or to determine direction. The following resources use objects students can see in the night sky without the aid of a telescope.\n\nNavigating without instruments\n\nWayfinding or navigating without instruments is about ocean voyaging using the stars, the Sun, the Moon, the ocean swells and other natural signs for clues to direction and location. See also the resources under Tātai arorangi.\n\nNavigating without instruments – introductory article with links to media, articles and student activities\n\nNavigating with Sun, Moon and planets – article\n\nThe celestial sphere – article\n\nThe star compass – kāpehu whetū – article\n\nConstellations in the night sky – activity\n\nNatural satellites\n\nA natural satellite is any celestial body in space that orbits around a larger body. Moons are called natural satellites because they orbit planets.\n\nNatural satellites – article\n\nOur solar system – revolutionary ideas – article\n\nObserving natural satellites – activity\n\nSpotting satellites – activity\n\nSpace – viewing with instruments\n\nSome times we need to rely on instruments to see things in space. Discover a few of these amazing objects in the Solar System and beyond.\n\nThe Sun and white dwarfs – article\n\nHow a solar system is formed – article\n\nSpace plasma – article\n\nRed giants in the night sky – article\n\nComets – article\n\nTo catch a comet the Rosetta Mission – article\n\nVisiting space\n\nThe official beginning of space is 100 km above the Earth’s surface. Rockets launched into space can be suborbital (brief visit to space) or orbital (staying in motion around the Earth) or can escape Earth’s gravity to travel deeper into space. The International Space Station orbits at a height of about 360 km.\n\nGetting rockets into space – article\n\nInvestigating rockets – introduction – introductory article with links to media, articles and student activities\n\nHow do we know what is out there?\n\nLook up into the sky at night. Just with your eyes, you can often see the Moon, planets, stars – even a couple of galaxies outside the Milky Way. With a telescope, you can see a lot more – fainter and more distant stars, dust clouds, galaxies. But there is a lot you can’t see, even with a powerful telescope, because not everything in space gives out light we can detect with our eyes. Find out how astronomers study space from a distance\n\nSpace revealed – introductory article with links to media, articles and student activities\n\nPlanet hunting – article\n\nExploring with telescopes – activity which uses an interactive and an online or paper-based quiz to learn about different types of telescopes and the types of space objects they are best suited to view.\n\nHunt the planet – activity\n\nIs anything out there? – activity\n\nThis is one of the great attractions of this subject; there is always something more to learn, a deeper insight to achieve. It’s rarely a matter of, oh well, I understand this, let’s move on.\n\nProfessor Denis Sullivan\n\nTātai arorangi\n\nMāori ancestors possessed a wealth of astronomical knowledge that they referred to as tātai arorangi. See also some of the resources under Navigating without instruments.\n\nRevitalising Māori astronomy – article\n\nTātai arorangi – video\n\nTe kāhui o Matariki – image\n\nThe Matariki star cluster – article\n\nNaming the whetū in te kāhui o Matariki – activity\n\nPicturebooks for Matariki – webinar\n\nGeneral information\n\nStars – image\n\nClose shave with Asteroid 2011 MD – article\n\nLonely planets wander galaxy – article\n\nInvestigating satellites – introduction – introductory article with links to media, articles and student activities\n\nSatellite fall to Earth over Pacific – article\n\nSolar flares hurl charged particles at Earth – article\n\nHeritage scientist – Beatrice Hill Tinsley\n\nNew Zealand cosmologist Beatrice Hill Tinsley was the first female professor of astronomy at Yale University. Her research added to the wide acceptance of the Big Bang theory.\n\nRead her biography: Beatrice Hill Tinsley\n\nUse the timeline to read about aspects of Beatrice's life and work, and how her findings changed scientific thinking.\n\nI used to read the encyclopedia as a kid and wish I could understand and contribute to cosmology.\n\nBeatrice Hill Tinsley\n\nCitizen science\n\nCitizen scientists are volunteers who contribute to scientific projects, usually by collecting or analysing data. The number of opportunities to be involved as citizen scientists continues to grow, and teachers are increasingly using them to make science education more relevant and engaging and to develop students’ science capabilities.
