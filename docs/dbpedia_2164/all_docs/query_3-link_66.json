What do the different colors on the map mean?\n\nWhere are the most species found? What about the least?\n\nIn the ocean closer to land, what do you notice?\n\nWe see clouds everyday — who hasn't looked up at the sky to admire their shapes and wondered what they feel like or how they formed? Tap into your students' curiosity while learning about all things clouds. Clouds are made up of water droplets (and sometimes ice crystals), and they form when water vapor condenses in the atmosphere. Importantly, the shape, texture, and position of clouds can be used to help predict weather conditions and changes. Different types of clouds form based on variables like temperature and humidity, which also drive changes in weather.\n\n>\n\n📚 Background information for educators\n\nWhat ingredients are needed for clouds to form? How does temperature play a role in cloud formation?
