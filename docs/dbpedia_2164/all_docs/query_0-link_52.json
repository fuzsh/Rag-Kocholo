        "text": "Team Planet is an active learning programme focused on the themes of environment and interdependence designed for use at individual class levels but also on a whole-school basis.\n\nCore to the programme is the notion of the connectedness and interdependence of all people, systems and cycles of life.\n\nWhile each level of the programme is self-contained and can be delivered on a stand alone basis, the full benefits of the programme will be realised if all levels are implemented throughout the school in a systematic and linked manner.\n\nThe programme is divided into four levels: Level 1: Naionain Shoisearacha & Naionain Shinsearacha; Level 2: Rang I & Rang II; Level 3: Rang III & Rang IV – with a specific focus at each level on one key concept.\n\nThe four key concepts, Nurturing, Webs of Dependence, Interconnections and Sustainable Development are explored and developed using cross-curricular themes.\n\nThe fragility of the planet’s ecosystem is one issue of greatest concern to human health and well-being in the 21st Century. The depletion of the ozone layer, atmospheric warming, rainforest destruction, desertification and the accelerating loss of animal and plant species together with the growing deprivation of the world’s poor represent an unprecedented threat to the very future of life on this planet.\n\nTranslating this concern into an educational response is the challenge which has inspired Team Planet.\n\nTeam Planet seeks to contribute to the ideal of sustainable development through the provision of structured materials and activities for pupils at all levels of the primary/elementary school. Highlighting that our own lives are directly connected to and supported by the systems which govern life on Planet Earth, this programme seeks to facilitate attitudinal awareness and behavioural change which foster harmonious co-existence with the Earth, all her people and systems. The programme also seeks to facilitate an understanding of social justice, peace and development as prerequisites for such co-existence.\n\nHence, Team Planet explores and develops four key concepts:\n\nNurturing\n\nDependence\n\nInterconnections\n\nSustainable Development.\n\nTeam Planet embraces the ideal of child-centred, activity-based learning by encouraging students to develop their awareness and understanding; to hold opinions and to take appropriate responsibility for the shape and direction of their own learning. The programme is designed to engage pupils’ hearts and minds in active processes of analysis, synthesis, debate and decision-making. It aims to promote an understanding of global environmental issues and develop a personal code of environmental ethics.\n\nTeam Planet offers teachers an avenue to addressing some of the vital issues we all face in the years ahead and helps pupils seek their own path towards a more harmonious relationship with the Earth and all her inhabitants.\n\nWe hope you enjoy using Team Planet as much as we have enjoyed developing it.\n\nKathleen Horgan\n\nLimerick, Ireland\n\nMay 2011\n\nNaíonáin Shóisearcha – Things I need, Things which need me\n\nThe theme is explored using a story that has two parts.\n\nThe first part of the story is based around the friendship of an owl and a tree that live in a forest together. They learn that through their friendship they can help each other. Oisín Oak provides a home for Uná Owl and other creatures that were in need of homes. Uná Owl and the other creatures become Oisín Oak’s friends, and he no longer feels lonely.\n\nThe second part of the story features Áodh and Aisling, two children from Baile Glas who enjoy spending time in the forest and especially with Oisín Oak. Áodh, Aisling and the forest trees and creatures are very upset when villagers from Baile Glas start cutting down trees in the forest. They call upon Labhraidh Leprechaun for help. Labhraidh Leprechaun puts a plan in action to make the villagers realise how important the forest is and how important it is that they care for it. Labhraidh’s plan is successful and the villagers of Baile Glas promise to take good care of the forest in future and live in harmony with the trees and animals there.\n\nEach episode of the story is explored through activities including: Storytime, Imagination/creative games, Amhranaoícht, Poetry, Art & Craft, Drama & mime, Nature Walks, Active/outdoor games, Matching games\n\nNaíonáin Shinsearacha – Caring for the Earth in Other Lands\n\nThis theme uses a photopack of 20 photographs of children from around the world. The images focus on family, school, work, caring and play. The activities aim to assist the children in exploring the similarities and differences between their life and the lives or others around the world. This theme hopes to develop greater openness and encourage the children to question stereotypical perceptions regarding people and life in other places.\n\nThe activities involve the use of the photopack and photographs selected by the teacher or the children themselves. The use of photographs encourages the children to think about, and question, the images that they are presented with.\n\nEach activity involves the use of photographs. The activities also incorporate: Memory games, Developing stories, Art & Craft, Drama, Cooking, Category games.\n\nKey ideas:\n\nRang 1: Habitats\n\nThe theme is based around a story which traces the journey down river of two children who live on a barge. During their journey they encounter many river creatures whose lives are endangered because of pollution and habitat destruction. The children feel compelled to act on behalf of their new found friends and set about enlightening the townspeople about the harmful consequences of their actions.\n\nEach episode of the story is explored through activities and worksheets which introduce concepts such as food chains, habitat, interdependence and pollution, while highlighting the dangers of irresponsible action towards the environment and motivating students to become more environmentally aware and ecologically concerned.\n\nRang 2: Our Food Web (2nd Class)\n\nThis theme uses a variety of group activities, stories, mapping exercises, posters and survey sheets to help pupils understand the vast network of people involved in providing us with food and thereby appreciate the nature of our dependence on the global community.\n\nThe activities which comprise this theme encourage the pupils to distinguish between needs and wants, identify different food types, explore a range of eating habits and customs throughout the world, trace the journey of foods from producer to distributor and recognise that much of the food which we eat is produced by people in distant lands.\n\nActivities include – ‘The Food We Eat’, ‘The People I Need’, ‘Breakfast Around the World’, ‘The Banana Story’, ‘Breakfast Trail’, ‘Supermarket Visit’ etc.\n\nKey ideas:\n\nRang 3: Nature, the Great Recycler\n\nThis theme seeks to promote an understanding of the delicate cycles of nature where energy and materials are continually exchanged and recycled. Through a range of group activities, role plays, stories, games and worksheets, the theme helps to foster an understanding of the word ‘environment’; introduce the concept of ‘food chains’; illustrate how energy is passed from one link in the chain to the next; promote and understanding of the interdependence between people and nature; and alert pupils to the “domino effect” which results when links in the food chains become polluted.\n\nThis theme forms an ideal springboard for the exploration of the concepts and issues which are addressed in the succeeding theme ‘Wasting Away’\n\nActivities include – ‘Essential Choices’, ‘Surrounded’, ‘What is Energy?’, ‘Sources of Energy’, ‘Pass it On’, ‘Ar Stailc’, ‘VIPs – Very Important Particles’, ‘Particles in Peril’ etc.\n\nRang 4: Wasting Away\n\nThe theme involves pupils in concrete activities where they observe, record and evaluate the amount of waste in their environment. The results of their waste surveys are compiled, displayed, and form the basis for awareness raising activities in the school and in the locality.\n\nIssues relating to the dangers of careless disposal of waste and the benefits of conservation and recycling are raised with reference to practices in other countries.\n\nFinally, the problem of waste as an integral part of modern living is highlighted when a Stone Age child reflects on the similarities and differences between past and present ways of living.\n\nActivities include – ‘What a Waste’, ‘Ag Faire ar an mBruscar’, ‘Me, a Litter Lout, Never!’, ‘Cén Aois Mé’, ‘Plastic is Forever’, ‘Nature’s Recyclers’, ‘The Green Scene’, ‘Equal Shares’, ‘Stone Crazy’ etc."
