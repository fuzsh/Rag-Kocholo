Earth School takes students on 30 quests, each focused on a different nature-related topic. The content was curated by an incredible team of collaborators and volunteers and was shaped to help students understand and celebrate our natural world. Now more than ever, we need to take care of this planet we call home. Earth School seeks to inspire such stewardship through its quests, each of which focuses on a different topic and allows us to understand, conceptualize and connect with nature in a different way.
