        "text": "The planet we live on is a lot like other planets. It is a round body that spins around in space and travels around the Sun. It has an atmosphere made up of different gases. It is a rocky planet, like Mercury, Venus, and Mars. But there is one big difference between Earth and all the other planets—Earth is the only planet in the solar system that can support life. Life on Earth exists because the planet has water on its surface and oxygen gas in its air. Earth also has the perfect range of temperatures for life. It is not too hot, like Venus, and not too cold, like Neptune. The average temperature on Earth is about 59 °F (15 °C).\n\nInteractive\n\nEvery planet in the solar system is named after a god or goddess from Greek or Roman mythology except for Earth. Earth means “the ground” in Old English and German.\n\nPhysical Features\n\nSize: 7,926 miles (12,756 kilometers) in diameter.\n\nSurface: Water and land. Water covers about 70 percent of Earth’s surface. This water is in the form of oceans, rivers, and lakes. Land covers about 30 percent of Earth’s surface. The land is divided into seven huge pieces called continents.\n\nStructure: Earth is made up of three layers: the core, the mantle, and the crust. The core is the center of the planet. The core is very hot. The mantle covers the core. The crust is Earth’s thin, rocky outer layer. Plants, animals, and people live on the crust.\n\nAtmosphere: Mostly water vapor and the gases nitrogen and oxygen. This is the air that living things breathe. Earth’s atmosphere goes up to a few hundred miles above the surface. The atmosphere gets thinner as it gets farther from the surface.\n\nMoons: One—the Moon.\n\nOrbit and Spin\n\nLike all planets, Earth has two types of motion: orbit and spin. The orbit is the path it takes as it travels around the Sun. Each planet also spins, or rotates about its center.\n\nOrbit: It takes Earth about 365 days to orbit around the Sun. (1 year on Earth = 365 days)\n\nSpin: It takes Earth about 24 hours to complete one rotation. (1 day on Earth = 24 hours)\n\nInteractive\n\nAs Earth moves around the Sun, different parts of the planet receive differing amounts of sunlight. This is because the planet is tilted on its axis, an imaginary line through its center. The two ends of the axis are the North Pole and the South Pole. The North Pole is tilted toward the Sun for about half the year. During this time the northern half of the planet, called the Northern Hemisphere, gets more sunlight than the southern half, or the Southern Hemisphere. During the other half of the year, the North Pole is tilted away from the Sun. Then the Southern Hemisphere gets more Sun than the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nThese differences in how sunlight hits different parts of Earth cause the seasons. For example, the Northern Hemisphere has its warmest season, summer, when it is tipped closer to the Sun. At the same time the Southern Hemisphere has winter, its coldest season.\n\nEarth Through Time\n\nInteractive\n\nScientists believe that Earth is about 4.6 billion years old. Earth’s surface has changed greatly since it was first formed. Some changes have taken place over millions of years as wind and water have eroded, or worn away, the land. Erosion has created features such as the Grand Canyon. The climate on Earth has also changed since it was first formed. These changes have affected the life-forms that have existed on Earth at different times. While the climate and life-forms can change very slowly, other changes to Earth can happen very quickly. The force of an erupting volcano or an earthquake can change the surrounding land in just hours.\n\nThe scientists who study changes to Earth are called geologists. They have divided Earth’s history into time periods called eons and eras. They use these periods to explain how and when changes on Earth took place. For instance, geologists have found that the Atlantic Ocean was formed during the Mesozoic Era, a division of the Phanerozoic Eon.\n\nLearn More\n\nplanets\n\nsolar system\n\nSun\n\nwater\n\nocean\n\nriver\n\nlake\n\ncontinent\n\nMoon\n\nseasons\n\nhemisphere\n\ngeology\n\nerosion\n\nclimate\n\nearthquake\n\nvolcano"
