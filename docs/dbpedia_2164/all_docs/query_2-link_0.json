It is not necessary to have watched the series to be able to use the following resources.\n\nOur Planet's Future Summit\n\nPut your students into the role of world leaders and environmental experts seeking to address biodiversity loss and define the future relationship between humans and nature.\n\nWith versatile options for delivering the summit over several lessons, or as an off-timetable experience, this summit is ideal for 14-18 yr olds, but can be simplified for younger ages.\n\nTeacher Guide\n\nBiome Binder (briefings for environmental experts)"
