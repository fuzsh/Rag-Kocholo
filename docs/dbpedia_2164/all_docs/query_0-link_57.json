In 2015 when it came out I remember being surprised and it was and still is a breath of fresh air. I can relate with the show and wanting to hold corrupt individuals and companies accountable and trying to make the world a better place. The show came out at just the right time during the rise of Bernie Sanders and the unfortunate rise of some other guy. I was really getting into politics and Bernie Sanders at the time. Be warned that this show isn't for the faint of heart and is really dark, but I think those that are adventurous will enjoy it. It's a show for the rebels. Each season has its own style so it never gets old and season 2 is especially interesting with the longer episodes. If you enjoyed Rami Malek as the villain in the new James Bond movie \"No Time to Die\", then you will definitely enjoy him playing the role as a hacker in this TV show. I really don't think anything can top this show just yet, it's just sooooo good and my current all time favorite.\n\nOne of my favorite scenes: (NSFW)\n\nHere is a playlist with the music from the TV show:\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/5veS4mOcZ7EypiudpO4o8w\n\nSomething cool that happened is that I was part of a small group of fans who solved a scavenger hunt the marketing team was doing in 2017 and they sent me a cool mask that looks like the one they use in the show:\n\nCheck out my Letterboxd profile to see what movies I've been watching lately and my IMDb watched list for both movies and shows\n\nOther all time favorite TV shows:\n\nCastle (2009–2016) IMDb link\n\nTouch (2012–2013) IMDb link\n\nBlack Mirror (2011) IMDb link\n\nRecent favorite TV shows:\n\nPanic (2021) IMDb link\n\nOuter Banks (2020) IMDb link\n\nLupin (2021) IMDb link\n\nHome Before Dark (2020) IMDb link\n\nThe Republic of Sarah (2021) IMDb link\n\nResident Alien (2021) IMDb link\n\nMattSudaSpotify Star\n\nHelp others find this answer and click \"Accept as Solution\".\n\nIf you appreciate my answer, maybe give me a Like.\n\nNote: I'm not a Spotify employee.\n\nEDIT TO ADD A FEW MORE FAVORITES:\n\nFawlty Towers: Greatest thing John Cleese has ever done. Basil Fawlty is one of the most hilarious characters ever filmed.\n\nHot Ones: If you've never checked out this YouTube series, it's well worth a look. It's an interview show where the host & guest each eat a series of increasingly incendiary chicken wings while the interview progresses. The guests are incredibly varied, from famous chefs/restarauntuers, musicians/singers, actors/directors. The relative tolerance for spicy food from the guests results in very interesting conversations.\n\nA recent favorite of mine is \"The Goes Wrong Show.\" The situation is a small British amateur theatre company presents a different play each week, and each week something goes horribly wrong. For instance, in one episode the setbuilders inadvertently built the set at a 90 degree angle and the entire scene has to be enacted with the cast hanging in mid air. This description doesn't communicate at all how hilarious this show is each episode, as the cast try in vain to deal with mounting problems.\n\nHere's a podcast on Spotify that reviews an episode:\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/108EXg7l3h8OIN9urIGzRR?si=tnpLyASeRc2n9NxtD3cK-A\n\nGreat question! My favorite TV show is Planet Earth, a 2006 series produced by the BBC Natural History Unit that was filmed over four years across 64 different countries. With the exception of the first episode (“From Pole to Pole”), each of the series’ episodes focuses on a global overview of a particular biome or habitat, including footage of the wildlife that inhabits these places on Earth – all while David Attenborough narrates, telling the viewer interesting facts about the natural world that relate to the particular environment featured in the episode.\n\nI can’t think of any other TV shows that I’ve liked more (or re-watched as often) as Planet Earth, which my family had on Blu-ray when I was a kid in high school. This was at the same time that I was learning about natural selection and evolution in my integrated science class, and reading E.O. Wilson’s The Diversity of Life for my environmental science class. I found Planet Earth to be just as engaging, as well as a nice complement to these classes; and though I’ve probably forgotten most of the information described in the episodes by now (as I haven’t watched it in several years), I have fond memories of the series. One of my friends during high school would sometimes come over to hang out, and on several occasions, we’d watch the “Fresh Water” episode (our favorite one); my friend would usually rewind the episode at the part where a nerpa seal swims by the camera in Lake Baikal, since we thought the seal looked like a blimp, and found that to be quite funny for some reason.

All the characters have such a complicated mind that it really needs to see it to be able to have a real idea of why this series became cult.\n\nIf like me you like creative extravagance, fuzzy mystery, aesthetic filming all that surrounded by a bit of crazyness, this series is undeniably for you.\n\nWhat about the music ?\n\nThe oppressive soundtrack for the two first seasons is mostly composed by Angelo Badalamenti, American composer born in Brooklyn, New York in 1938.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/7FO7BolIZsl1o8DDSjeOph?si=c44de270673848cd\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/6UaxyaWcV9Os9BcZet6Dem?si=5302534305f14ed6\n\nFor the third season, beside Badalamenti work, Lynch added original songs by new artists or bands. I have gathered them in the following playlist.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/0oyucPzVnqlryQI0VLMr0c?si=9ee7daeadb354017\n\nJust for fun\n\nInspired by TWIN PEAKS, I have recreated a playlist/soundtrack which could also match with the series.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/51sL7u3UvVt2GrHffMf6Dk?si=4bdda7972e144f11\n\ntwitter.com/soundofus\n\nwww.soundofus.com\n\nSoundofusSpotify Star\n\nHelp others find this answer and click \"Accept as Solution\".\n\nIf you appreciate my answer, maybe give me a Like.\n\nNote: I'm not a Spotify employee.\n\nWow, great picks everyone! I think I'll share my top three favorite TV series.\n\n#1 - Chicago Fire\n\nThis is my favorite series I have ever watched. Ever. Chicago Fire is an American drama series created by Derek Haas and Michael Brandt with executive producer Richard Wolf, and it is one of three installments of the Wolf Entertainment Chicago franchise. I've watched Chicago PD and I've just started to watch Chicago Med, but I think I can say already that neither compares to the greatness of Chicago Fire. The characters and their interactions are so well thought out, and though there are characters on every show that just aren't as likable as others, the characters of Chicago Fire are generally just so... lovable, especially for drama characters. The dynamic of the characters and the series in general is pretty much exactly suited to my tastes, and while I can't attach myself too much to any Med characters yet and really just didn't connect with any of the characters on Chicago PD, I have such an attachment to so many of the Chicago Fire characters. I love to see that they're truly a family. For example, when one of them is hurt and in the hospital, everyone shows up. I don't know if I'm too sentimental, but moments like that affect me deeply, and it's such a sweet thing to see. And of course, the plot lines are great too - but I won't spoil them in case anyone is interested in watching it now.\n\n#2 - The Office US\n\nThe Office is an American mockumentary sitcom television series that depicts the everyday work lives of office employees in Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. I think it's pretty much impossible not to love The Office once you've seen it. It's my second favorite television series and, in my opinion, one of the greatest series of all time.\n\n#3 - Kim's Convenience\n\nMy third favorite series of all time, Kim's Convenience is a Canadian television sitcom that premiered on CBC Television in October 2016. It depicts the Korean-Canadian Kim family that runs a convenience store in the Moss Park neighbourhood of Toronto. I love this series so much and I'm sad that it had to end so abruptly. I think it definitely deserves more recognition.\n\nI ought to watch something other than dramas and comedies...\n\nThose are my three favorite shows of all time."
