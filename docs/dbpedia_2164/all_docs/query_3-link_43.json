        "text": "Hey guys, it’s been a while since I’ve decided to rip any TV shows. Today I added Planet Earth to Plex, and all went well, however, inFuse is having issues setting it up as a TV show. The episodes are detected, but as individual files, with the file name, not the matched episode name.\n\nMy setup is as follows:\n\nBase folder TV Shows\n\nShow folder: Planet Earth (2006\n\nSeason folder: Season 01\n\nepisodes named as follows:\n\ns01e01 - From Pole to Pole.mkv\n\ns01e02 - Mountains.mkv\n\nand so on. I used to be able to name things once and have both Plex, and Infuse both identify them correctly, that doesn’t seem to be happening here though. Any help? Thanks\n\nThanks for the reply, I’ll keep that in mind if I have more issues, I was able to fix it by editing the metadata for one of the episodes and searching for Planet Earth, then Infuse reindexed, and identified the show correctly. So I guess one option could also be, if I’m going to have both Plex and Infuse access the same files, name for Plex, and then if Infuse doesn’t pick it up automatically manually match it. Do you happen to know if changing the naming would throw Plex off? because the way I named the files is by the instructions Plex provides.\n\nI’ll keep that in mind, thanks. My usage overall has changed too. I primarily use ROkU, and other non apple specific platforms / devices for streaming. I bought Infuse during a time, Plex wasn’t working reliably with the Roku when it came to transcoding, and other issues. That has been improved greatly since. What I like about Infuse is for movies it will it will do the Lossless audio on my compatible setup. On my other setup (4k), the Apple TV is a pain to use when it comes to audio, because it doesn’t play 5.1 audio automatically over optical, unless I set EVERYTHING to go as dolby digital 5.1. When Infuse was able to do passthrough, it worked much better on that setup. The reason behind this is: I have two setups 1 is 1080p only, and the other is 4k / HDR10, HLG. The sound bars I use are HDMI 1.4 only, so they can only pass 1080p. So the only device I can use on that setup to get HDMI quality audio is my blu-ray player as it has 2 HDMI ports. The streamers only have one, so they have to send audio through the TV, out optical. Which works because I still get all the standard codecs, except dolby plus, but DTS 5.1, dolby 5,1, PCM Stereo all work fine. So, that’s where I’m at, since Infuse is Apple only, it doesn’t get used like it used to.\n\nSo, I may just use Infuse for Movies, and let Plex handle both. The other thing is, I could just keep the spider-man series as a DVD only show, because it’s such a pint to del with when working with media streamers. Thanks for the help though, and Now, I have a better understanding how infuse deals with TV shows at this point.\n\nThought I would come back here, and let you all know I fixed the problem. I re-ripped the show, and then named it accordingly to the TVDB.com, and both Infuse, and Plex have agreed on identification and both are showing the show, and all episodes correctly. I’m still trying to get Serviio to identify it correctly, but I doubt anyone here has experience with it. it’s a dedicated DLNA server, and it’s written in Java. I primarily use it with the blu-ray players, even though I can also use Plex DLNA with those, without issues. Serviio simply has a dedicated profile to my specific line of players."
