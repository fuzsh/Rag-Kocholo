        "text": "Length: 25 min\n\nAppropriate for: Grades 3-12\n\nLanguages: Closed Captions available in over a dozen languages, including Spanish and Chinese\n\nA Fragile Island of Life in a Vast Universe of Possibility\n\nThe Earth has just the right conditions for life, unless we tip the balance. So it might be wise for us to expand our search for life. Fly through the solar system out into our galaxy and beyond. Explore the possibility of life on other planets. Discover why it's important we protect this fragile protector of life we call Earth.\n\nWe recommend using this film as an introduction to units on human impacts on Earth systems (Disciplinary Core Idea ESS3.C), as it sets the stage for why we should take care of our planet through conservation and sustainability efforts.\n\nIn need of a unit supporting ESS3.C, or want to revamp your existing curriculum? Check out Flipside Science, a media-rich series that tackles complex environmental topics and empowers youth to make a difference (grades 6-10)."
