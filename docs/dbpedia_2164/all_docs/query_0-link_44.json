        "text": "Written by Jamie C. Martin of Simple Homeschool and Introverted Moms\n\nI had NO idea when I researched and wrote this article originally that it would become one of the top search results that would lead readers to this site for years to come!\n\nI guess it makes sense, though. With the rise of streaming, parents are desperate for resources to sift through ALL that’s out there.\n\nThat’s why, years later, I decided to update this post to make it as helpful as possible for you again. My initial article featured approximately 60 shows; this updated one has 100!\n\nTo help you navigate the list that follows I’ve divided the TV shows into these categories: Amazon Prime, Disney Plus, Netflix, Peacock, and Other. Categories are accurate as of the date this post published, but keep in mind that network availability may fluctuate in the future.\n\nHere’s what motivated me to initially create the list, back in 2014:\n\n“After a decade of use and about a year of saving, Steve and I finally entered the 21st century when we purchased a new widescreen television and got rid of our old tube model–the one my Nana bought for us right after our first son (now grown!!) was born.\n\nOur kids, who generally choose one show each on Saturdays and Sundays, were clamoring at their newfound options. And I knew I needed to undertake a research project to sort it all out and make sure we use our new screen intentionally.”\n\nOn TV ratings\n\nI’ve found determining what is age appropriate for my children much easier since I discovered Common Sense Media. They give ratings and reviews on movies, television shows, music, websites, apps, video games, and more.\n\nFor the majority of the shows below, I’ve linked directly to Common Sense Media so you can read more detailed reviews. Personally I have found, however, that adding two years to CSM’s “recommended age” has generally been a better fit for our family!\n\nI rarely watch a movie or show now without going to CSM first.\n\nHere’s an overview of standard TV ratings (find more details here):\n\nTV-Y: children of all ages, including young ones 2-6\n\nTV-7: age seven and up\n\nTV-G: program may not have been made exclusively for children, but seems appropriate for most ages\n\nTV-PG: unsuitable for younger children\n\nTV-14: unsuitable for children under age 14\n\nTV-MA: not designed for children (equivalent to R movie rating)\n\nAnd you’ll also see these content descriptors:\n\nD – Sexual or suggestive dialogue\n\nL – Coarse or crude language\n\nS – Sexual situations\n\nV – Violence\n\nFV – Fantasy violence (exclusive to the TV-Y7 rating)\n\nI also want to mention that I have not viewed all the shows listed below, so use this as a resource to determine what is right for your own unique family.
