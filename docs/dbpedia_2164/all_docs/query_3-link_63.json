        "text": "As of May the 4th, 2024 (be with you), the satellite tracking website “Orbiting Now” lists 9,900 active satellites in various Earth orbits. A deeper dive into numbers of satellite that are in space reveals how small satellites have come to dominate low Earth orbit.\n\nWhere do these satellites orbit?\n\nIn the three main categories of Earth orbits, small satellites dominate LEO while large satellites dominate GEO.\n\nGEO 12%\n\nMEO 3%\n\nLEO 84%\n\nLow orbits are easier to reach and have certain advantages for small satellites. Radio signals take much less time to reach LEO than GEO. As a result, low-orbiting communications satellites can deliver higher-quality internet service. Being closer to Earth also lets satellites communicate with Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) devices despite these devicesâ low-power radios.\n\nWhat do these satellites do?\n\nSatellites can perform several missions depending on their payloads. The five most common primary missions include:\n\nExcept for navigation, these missions are increasingly performed by small satellites. For example, 80% of communications satellites and 79% of technology development satellites have launch masses below 300 kg.\n\nRead more about the latest NanoAvionics small satellite missions: https://nanoavionics.com/news/\n\nHow many countries have satellites in orbit?\n\nOperating satellites are registered in 105 countries or multinational organizations. The ten countries with the most operational satellites are:\n\nThis list is not so surprising as these countries have long been part of the Space Age and are home to many commercial satellite companies. Remarkable things, however, are happening at the other end of the list. At the turn of the 21st Century, only 14 nations operated satellites. Within the past two decades, satellites from 91 new space-faring countries reached orbit.\n\nHow many active satellites are small satellites?\n\nNearly three-fourths (72%) of active satellites fall into the small satellite category.\n\nThis domination of small satellites is relatively recent. Only 34% of the satellites launched in the 1990s fell into this category. By the 2020s, small satellites comprised 94% of all satellite launches.\n\nWhat drives this dramatic increase? Small satellites offer many benefits for innovative new space applications."
