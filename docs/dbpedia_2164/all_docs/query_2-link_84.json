        "text": "Even today, most Earth life is microbial. And microbes have been here for at least 3.5 billion yearsÂa very long time when you consider that the first rocks formed about 3.8 billion years ago. Given the number of potentially habitable planets within our home galaxy, chances are good that microbial life exists elsewhere.\n\nWhether more-complex life forms like plants and insects exist elsewhere is a bigger question. For 2.9 billion years or so, all life on Earth was microscopic. Multicellular, macroscopic algae and animals came onto the scene about 600 million years ago. That's about 17% of the total time that life has existed on Earth.\n\nIt's very hard to say how likely we are to find other intelligent life forms. The oldest fossils of our species, Homo sapiens, are less than 200,000 years old. That's a geological microsecond, just 0.000057% of the time microbes have been around. If, like on Earth, intelligent life takes much longer to evolve than microbial life, it might be rare. But some galaxies and solar systems are much older than ours, so maybe other intelligent life has formed; however, it may be long dead. Finding living intelligent beings is a matter of both space and time.\n\nJust as conditions on Earth have changed drastically over time, so have conditions on other planets. When astrobiologists evaluate a planet, they look not just at its current conditions, but for signs that it could have been habitable in the past.\n\nLiquid water leaves behind a kind of footprint. Mars, for example, has what looks like dry river and lake beds, making astrobiologists wonder if the cold, dry planet could have once been covered with life. If it was, there may be enough remaining liquid water to sustain microbial life deep underground or under the frozen ice caps.\n\nLiving things change their environment, leaving behind certain physical and chemical signatures. Even a planet that is lifeless today could have fossil evidence of ancient life forms. Fossils and chemical remnants can tell us a lot about what extinct life might have looked like."
