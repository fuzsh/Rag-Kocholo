        "text": "Attenborough began working at an educational publishing house in 1949. In 1952 he started training at the BBC and became a television producer. Two years later he and Jack Lester, curator of the Reptile House at the London Zoo, started a television series called Zoo Quest. The show was very popular because it featured live animals that were filmed in the wild and in zoos. Its popularity inspired the BBC to create more educational programming.\n\nIn 1965 Attenborough was given control of the BBC’s new second television channel, BBC-2. He helped produce several popular series that discussed art and science. Attenborough also aired the influential comedy series Monty Python’s Flying Circus. From 1968 to 1972 he served as director of television programming at the BBC.\n\nAttenborough then resigned from the BBC so he could write and produce his own television series. He wrote and narrated a number of award-winning television series on anthropology and natural history. These included Life on Earth (1979), The Living Planet (1984), The Private Life of Plants (1995), The Life of Birds (1998), The Life of Mammals (2002–03), and Life in Cold Blood (2008). Attenborough also worked on The Blue Planet (2001), an exploration of the world’s oceans. In the 2000s a number of shows that focused on environmental issues came out: State of the Planet (2000), Are We Changing Planet Earth? (2006), and Climate Change–The Facts (2019). Attenborough also wrote books that were often companions to his television series.\n\nAttenborough was knighted in 1985. He won Emmy Awards for his narration of Blue Planet II (2017) and Our Planet (2019). He has won many other awards for his work, including dozens of honorary degrees from universities.\n\nAnother honor for Attenborough has been in the naming of some extinct and living animal species. His name can be found in scientific names, including a sea animal that lived millions of years ago (Attenborosaurus) and a long-beaked echidna that lives in New Guinea (Zaglossus attenboroughi). Attenborough’s love of butterflies was honored with Euptychia attenboroughi, a rare butterfly from the tropical forests of Colombia and Brazil."
