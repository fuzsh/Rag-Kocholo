        "text": "Earth\n\nEarth is our home and the third planet from the Sun, with a mean distance of about 150 million kilometres. This distance is such that the average surface temperature is above the freezing point of water (0°C) and liquid water can exist freely. This has played a fundamental role in the development of life on our planet, unlike on Venus and Mars, whose surface temperatures are either much warmer or much colder. The shape of the Earth is very close to a sphere. Because of its slow rotation — once every 24 h — the distortions are small, the difference between the equatorial radius (6,378 km) and the polar radius (6,357 km) being only 21 km. Earth only has one natural satellite, the Moon, which is thought to have played a major role in stabilising the axis of rotation of the Earth. Once again, this may have been a favourable element in the emergence of life.\n\nTactile features (while you explore the tactile schematic image)\n\nLiquid water, continents and polar caps\n\nOn Earth, 71% of the surface is covered by liquid water (represented by plastic on the tactile image), so the area occupied by seas and oceans is more than twice that occupied by land. The distribution of lands and seas is unequal and peculiar: the majority of land masses are located in the Northern hemisphere as three major continents: Europe, Asia, and North America (continents are represented by the thick fabric on the tactile image). The poles of the Earth are also quite different: there is an ice-covered continent at the South Pole (Antarctica), but an ocean at the North Pole (the Arctic Ocean), which forms an ice cap in winter (both represented by the aluminium foil on the tactile image). On Earth, surface elevations are measured with respect to the mean sea level. They vary between a height of 8,848 m (Mount Everest) and a depth of 11,000 m (the Mariana Trench in the northwest part of the Pacific Ocean). The average depth of the oceans is 3,800 m, and the average altitude of land is 840 m.\n\nClouds and hurricanes\n\nEarth has a relatively thin atmosphere extending to less than 200 km altitude. Dry air is mainly composed of nitrogen (N2: 78.08%), oxygen (O2: 20.95%), and argon (Ar: 0.93%). The remaining 0.04% is a mixture of “trace” gases, mostly carbon dioxide (CO2), but also rare gases such as neon (Ne), helium (He), and krypton (Kr). On average, water vapour (H2O) accounts for 0.25% of the mass of the atmosphere, but its concentration varies a lot depending on the local temperature: it can be anywhere between 0.01% and 5%. When lifted to the upper parts of the atmosphere (above 3000 m on average), water vapour condenses to form clouds of very diverse densities and shapes (represented by clumps of cotton on the tactile image); some of these clouds can develop into powerful hurricanes over the oceans (represented by curled wire and cotton on the tactile image). Earth’s climate has recently begun undergoing an unprecedentedly fast warming phase due to the action of “greenhouse gases”, such as carbon dioxide and methane, that humans have been releasing in large quantities since the beginning of the industrial era. These gases tend to trap infrared radiation from the Earth's surface, causing the Earth's surface to heat up; we call this phenomenon the \"greenhouse effect.\"\n\nPrior to the activity:\n\nPrint both Earth mold and Earth features PDFs for each group, and prepare the materials listed above.\n\nAsk students what they know about the Earth, and how it looks from space. Tell students they will be making models of the Earth to investigate its different features.\n\nDuring the activity:\n\nPut the students in groups of 5 (ideally 3 non-visually impaired to 2 visually impaired).\n\nDistribute materials accordingly.\n\nClose supervision is important. Follow each group and explain each of the tactile elements and their correspondence to each object feature.\n\nUnderstand the different needs of each group of students to promote interaction between the students during the building of the tactile image – visually impaired students need to be familiarized with the different materials involved.\n\nGive enough time to follow instructions and build the tactile image.\n\nStep 1\n\nPrint two copies of the 'Earth Mold PDF.'\n\nStep 2\n\nCut the outer round shape of the Earth from one of the printed papers.\n\nStep 3\n\nPlace the paper cutout on top of the plastic and draw the outline.\n\nStep 4\n\nCut the plastic according to the drawn section.\n\nStep 5\n\nApply glue on the surface of the Earth on the other printed paper.\n\nStep 6\n\nPlace the circular plastic cutout on top of the glued area.\n\nStep 7\n\nCut the shape of the polar caps on the previously cut 'Earth Mold PDF.'\n\nStep 8\n\nPlace the polar caps on aluminum foil and draw the outline.\n\nStep 9\n\nCut the aluminum foil accordingly to the outline.\n\nStep 10\n\nGlue the aluminum foil (polar caps) on top of the plastic circle previously glued on the paper.\n\nStep 11\n\nPrint the 'Earth Features PDF' and cut the shapes of Earth’s continents.\n\nStep 12\n\nPlace the paper cutout (continents) on top of the thick fabric and draw the outline.\n\nStep 13\n\nCut the thick fabric according to the drawn section.\n\nStep 14\n\nApply glue on the cutout and paste it accordingly on the paper.\n\nStep 15\n\nCurl the cotton around the thin wire to produce the hurricane feature.\n\nStep 16\n\nCurl both textures alike in the size of the round shape of the hurricane.\n\nStep 17\n\nApply glue and paste it accordingly on the paper.\n\nStep 18\n\nApply glue on the region denoted by a curved line.\n\nStep 19\n\nPlace cotton on top of the glue to produce the clouds.\n\nWait for the image to dry. This may take a while.\n\nExploring the tactile image:\n\nThere are several ways in which you can explore the scientific content of the tactile schematic images.\n\nIf you’re presenting the final tactile image to the students, first let them explore and feel the different textures. Questions will arise as the students explore; encourage them to write their questions down and share them with the other groups. Read “Background Information” to understand the different features present in the Earth’s schematic tactile image, and share with the students as they ask about them, or (if you have more time), prompt each group to choose a feature to learn more about and then have them present to the other groups in the class.\n\nWater is represented by the plastic texture.\n\nThe continents are represented by the thick fabric.\n\nThe polar caps by aluminum foil.\n\nThe hurricanes are represented by cotton and wire curled up.\n\nThe clouds are represented by cotton.\n\nDiscuss the idea of models with the students. Suggested discussion points:\n\nWhat is a model? Why is it useful to build models?\n\nWhat are the strengths of this model?\n\nWhat are the limitations?\n\nHow could the model be improved?\n\nAsk students in their groups to write down two things they learned from the activity, and two things they want to learn more about.\n\nUse the below descriptions or ask students to volunteer their own description for a feature on Earth. Ask students to point at the feature on their diagram as soon as they know which one it is. First give a description and a couple of seconds to think about it. Then give the name and a couple more seconds to point it out. Encourage students to ask questions about different characteristics of Earth represented by the different textures. e.g. - The part of the world where nearly all humans live. (Land). - These cover nearly three quarters of the Earth’s surface and are very wet. (Seas and oceans). - These are very cold parts of the world, made of ice. (Polar caps). - These are in the sky and where rain comes from. (Clouds). - These are huge storms where the wind is really strong (Hurricane).\n\nAsk students to discuss the importance of building models, strengths and limitations of this model of the Earth, and how they might improve the model.\n\nAsk students in their groups to write down two things they learned from the activity, and two things they want to learn more about."
