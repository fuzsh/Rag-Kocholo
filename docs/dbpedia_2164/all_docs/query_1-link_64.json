        "text": "Planet Earth III has released a brand-new episode, but Sir David Attenborough isn't narrating it.\n\nThe legendary broadcaster and naturalist has stepped aside for this special instalment of the documentary series, with children stepping in to read his scripts.\n\nAvailable right now on BBC iPlayer from today (April 22) to celebrate Earth Day, the synopsis for the episode explains that: \"You don't have to be Sir David Attenborough to Become a Voice for Nature.\"\n\nRelated: The One Show's Matt Baker announces next TV role\n\nThe 49 children, aged between nine and 13, were selected due to their efforts fundraising for Children in Need over the years.\n\nThe episode is being screened in a virtual assembly in schools across the UK today. Meanwhile extra content, including the opportunity for kids to record their own commentaries, is available on the Children in Need website.\n\nWildlife biologist and presenter Lizzie Daly, who is involved in the virtual assembly, said: \"I'm thrilled to be presenting the Become a Voice for Nature live schools assembly on Earth Day!\n\nRelated: EastEnders to delay BBC iPlayer release for London Marathon episode\n\n\"I want to encourage schools across the UK to download a Become a Voice for Nature resource pack from the BBC Children in Need website and join us to hear more from the producers of Planet Earth III and learn more about the planet, how it impacts our lives and what we can do to protect it. I can't wait, see you all there.\"\n\nSince its premiere all the way back in 2006, Planet Earth has pushed the technical boundaries of nature documentaries, and has won numerous awards.\n\nThis special episode of Planet Earth III can be streamed on BBC iPlayer now, while it will air on BBC One on May 6. Planet Earth and Planet Earth II can also be streamed on the service."
