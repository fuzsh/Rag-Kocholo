Now, the British nature documentary series is back with Planet Earth III — airing on TV on BBC America and streaming online.\n\nNarrated by Sir David Attenborough, Planet Earth III will be available to stream on BBC America at the same time as it airs on the cable network. Don’t have cable? You can watch Planet Earth on BBC America via DirecTV Stream, the live TV streaming service, which has a free trial right now for new users.\n\nThe channel is also available on AMC+, as an add-on at Amazon Prime Video. Prime members can get a free seven-day trial to AMC+; after that, it auto-renews at $4.99 monthly.\n\nWhere to Watch Planet Earth III on TV\n\nPlanet Earth III will be broadcast on the cable network BBC America. You can watch the nature docuseries through your cable TV provider, or on BBCAmerica.com with your cable TV account login information.\n\nWhere to Watch Planet Earth III Without Cable\n\nThe eight-episode nature docuseries is available to stream on BBC America and AMC+ every Saturday starting on Nov. 4 at 8 p.m. ET/PT. And since Planet Earth III is being broadcast on BBC America, this means it’s also streaming on internet-based alternative cable services too. In fact, some services even offer free trials, so if you act fast and sign up now, you could actually watch for free.\n\nHow to Stream Planet Earth III Online Free\n\nWatch BBC America on DirecTV Stream\n\nYou can watch Planet Earth III on BBC America via DirecTV Stream. All of the cable alternative’s plans offer the network, while it also includes more than 75 channels — such as AMC, Bravo, CNBC, Disney Channel and much more. Meanwhile, the streamer has a free trial available, which only lasts for five days, but that’s more than enough to the first episode of the docuseries.\n\nIf you like DirecTV Stream, you can keep the service, with prices starting as low as $64.99 for the entertainment package.\n\nWatch BBC America on Prime Video\n\nIf you’re an Amazon Prime member, then you can simply add AMC+ — which includes programming from BBC America — to your streaming service for an additional $4.99 per month (in addition to base plan fees).\n\nNot a member? Sign up for a 30-day free trial to take advantage of all that Amazon Prime has to offer, including access to Prime Video; fast same-, next-, or two-day free shipping; discounts at Whole Foods Market, access to exclusive shopping events — like Prime Day and Black Friday — and more.\n\nAMC+ also has programming from AMC, IFC, Shudder and Sundance TV.\n\nWatch BBC America on Sling\n\nIf you’d like to watch Planet Earth III on BBC America, Sling might be a good fit for you. It’s the cheapest cable alternative, with prices starting as low as $20 per month for the first month ($40 per month afterwards) for Sling Orange — with the streamer’s current deals.\n\nThe entry-level Orange package also includes AMC, Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, ESPN, Freeform, TNT and much more. In addition, Sling Blue includes BBC America, but you can also get networks, like Bravo, MSNBC, Discovery Channel, Fox News, USA Network and many others. You can also get Sling Orange + Blue for both channel offerings for Sling.\n\nWatch BBC America on Philo\n\nFor $25 per month, Philo is a very wallet-friendly cable alternative that offers more than 70 entertainment-focused networks, including BBC America to watch Planet Earth III. It has the edge when it comes to inexpensive streamers because of its low price; wide range of channels, like A&E, Comedy Central, MTV, Discovery, HGTV and more; unlimited DVR and over 70,000 on-demand titles in their streaming library. Philo also has a seven-day free trial, which a number of cable alternatives don’t offer.\n\nWhere to Buy Planet Earth Online\n\nWatch Planet Earth III on Prime Video\n\nYou can watch episodes of Planet Earth III one day after it airs on Prime Video. When a new episode drops on BBC America, it will be available to purchase 24 hours later — episode by episode.\n\nThe original Planet Earth, meantime, is available on DVD for $20 (67% off) or on Blu-ray for $34, or 57% off, at Amazon (prices were accurate at time of this writing). The first Planet Earth series is available to stream on Max via Prime Video, or for purchase on Prime Video.\n\nMeanwhile, Planet Earth II is on DVD for $23; Blu-ray for $14, or 69% off and 4K Ultra HD for $19, or 68% off, at Amazon. You can also buy it digitally on Prime Video, or stream it on Max on Prime Video."
