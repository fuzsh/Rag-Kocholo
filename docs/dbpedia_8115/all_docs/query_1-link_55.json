I am grateful that Jerry encouraged me to watch “The Greatest Night in Pop” film last month and I highly recommend viewing this outstanding documentary.\n\nWhile I won’t be giving a review of “The Greatest Night in Pop” movie, I will be sharing about certain aspects of the film, the recording of “We Are the World”, and the songs significance in modern music history.\n\nI also will be communicating what I consider to be the best 1980s singles by 15 of the artists who had solo vocal lines within the 1985 charity song. Every song that I will be listing was a major pop hit during the 80s.\n\n“We Are the World” was written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie, with Quincy Jones and Michael Omartian producing the song which was recorded by a supergroup of pop artists called USA for Africa.\n\nAccording to “The Greatest Night in Pop” documentary, over 40 pop artists assembled at A&M Recording Studios in Hollywood, California, to record final vocal tracks for the “We Are the World” song.\n\nMichael Jackson arrived first for this historic musical event around 8:00 pm. Soon after scores of other artists came on the scene, with many coming directly from the American Music Awards happening that evening, including the host of the annual music ceremony Lionel Richie.\n\nAround 10:30 pm, Quincy Jones gathered the vocal artists and musicians together to start the recording process. This assembled multitude worked throughout the night during their marathon recording session completing the final audiotape at 8:00 am.\n\nSix weeks later on March 7, 1985, “We Are the World” was released as a single. The song was an immediate hit: Reaching number 1 on three Billboard charts: R&B Singles chart, Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks listing and the Hot 100 Pop singles survey, where it spent 4 weeks at the top spot.\n\nAfter “We Are the World” was released, it was honored by multiple music awards. In 1986, the song achieved 4 Grammy Awards. The single also received awards by MTV for its music video, a People’s Choice Award and an American Music Award.\n\nThe original inspiration for artists to come together and record a song for African famine relief came from Harry Bellafonte. He is quoted on the USA for Africa website about the lasting effect of the “We Are the World” single:\n\n“In 1985, the music industry and the world came together in an unprecedented outpouring of generosity in response to the tragic famine wreaking havoc in Africa at the time. The biggest names in music ‘checked their egos at the door’ to create what was and still is a worldwide phenomenon.”\n\nBellafonte continues: “The recording of the original We Are the World sold more than 7 million records worldwide. The worldwide sale of that record generated more than $60 million which has been used to assist Africa and Africans affected by the famine and other critical issues since 1985. The song became and remains the people’s anthem and continues to be revered and loved globally.”\n\nBelow are artists who sang solo parts on the “We Are the World” song:\n\nLionel Richie\n\nStevie Wonder\n\nPaul Simon,\n\nKenny Rogers,\n\nJames Ingram\n\nTina Turner\n\nBilly Joel\n\nMichael Jackson\n\nDiana Ross,\n\nDionne Warwick\n\nWillie Nelson\n\nAl Jarreau\n\nBruce Springsteen\n\nKenny Loggins\n\nSteve Perry\n\nDaryl Hall\n\nHuey Lewis\n\nCyndi Lauper\n\nKim Carnes\n\nBob Dylan\n\nRay Charles\n\nFor the remainder of this message, I will convey what I consider to be the best and most memorable 80s pop hits, by 15 of the artists who had solo parts on the “We Are the World” recording. The songs that I have selected were all major top 40 singles from 1980 through 1989.\n\nThe top 15 songs and artists that I have picked are entirely based on my opinions. My selections are singles that I deem to be culturally, historically, aesthetically significant, meaningful or relevant.\n\nIn researching historical musical data for this article, I used “The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits” by Joel Whitburn for documentation. The placement of singles on the countdown derives solely on my favorability of songs and not on how I rate each of the artists listed.\n\nNow without further ado, here is my countdown of 15 outstanding singles from “We Are the World” singers:\n\n15. That’s What Friends Are For—Dionne Warwick: 1985\n\nPositions on Billboard Charts: #1 Hot 100, The #1 biggest single of 1986\n\nThat’s What Friends Are For” was written by Burt Bacharach and Carole Bayer Sager and was recorded as a charity single for AIDS research and prevention.

The third of 7 top ten singles on the Billboard Hot 100 from legendary LP (1983-1985). The song is still a staple on classic rock radio stations here in 2024.\n\n4. We Didn’t Start the Fire—Billy Joel: 1989\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #1 Hot 100, 35th Biggest Song of 1989\n\nBilly Joel wrote the lyrics of “We Didn’t Start the Fire” which document historical, political, cultural and sports highlights between the years 1948 and 1989. The “Piano Man” sings in a rapid paced manner that calls for multiple listens to comprehend all of the historical events mentioned. Joel still performs this song as the first encore selection at every one of his 2024 concerts.\n\n3. The Power of Love—Huey Lewis: 1985\n\nPositions on Billboard Charts: #1 Hot 100, 15th Biggest Song of 1985\n\n“The Power of Love” was written by Huey Lewis, along with Lewis Hayes and Johnny Colla for the 1985 film “Back to the Future. The single is backed up by Lewis’ band the News and became that band’s first #1 chart topping song. It was one of the biggest singles from the summer of ’85.\n\n2. All Night Long (All Night)—Lionel Richie: 1983\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #1 Hot 100, 12th Biggest Song of 1984\n\nThe most successful solo single by the former lead singer of the Commodores. Written by Lionel Richie, “All Night Long” has a diversity of musical elements: pop, rock, and R&B, mixed with a Caribbean/African beat. This Richie signature song is still a favorite to play at wedding receptions this decade.\n\nMan in the Mirror—Michael Jackson: 1988\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #1 Hot 100, 21st Biggest Song of 1988\n\nMy number 1 song on the countdown is by the “King of Pop” Michael Jackson. “Man in the Mirror” was written by Glen Ballard and Siedah Garrett, produced by Quincy Jones and Jackson.\n\nThe Andraé Crouch Choir recorded background gospel vocals on the song and it became Jackson’s 4th consecutive single from the 1987 “Bad” album to peak at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe message of the lyrics offer encouragement: “I’m starting with the man in the mirror/I’m asking him to change his ways/And no message could have been any clearer/If you wanna make the world a better place/Take a look at yourself and then make a change.”\n\n“Man in the Mirror” is my favorite Michael Jackson solo song of all-time and I am glad to proclaim this excellent song to be my number 1 single of outstanding pop hit by artists who had solo vocals on “We Are the World.”\n\nThat wraps up my countdown on what I consider to be the 15 best singles from the “We Are the World” solo singers. I completely understand that my listing of 80s singles in this category was written from my point of view and is subjective.\n\nIf you were creating a similar register of excellent 80s pop hits by the same artists, your tabulation may be totally different. What do you consider to be the best singles by the “We Are the World” pop stars? I hope you will comment below.\n\nIn closing, I must ask this question: Is the recording in late January 1985 of “We Are the World” the greatest night in pop? Obviously, the answer to this query is debatable.\n\nI will say that the assembly of over 40 artists for “We Are the World” has to be considered the greatest gathering ever of pop music superstars with the recording of this historic session. It may never be duplicated again.\n\nWill there ever be another version of fundraising similar to what pop artists did with “We Are the World” in 1985? I am hoping that type of event will happen this century. Rock on!\n\nTo subscribe to my blog via email, please click the “Follow” button in the menu above."
