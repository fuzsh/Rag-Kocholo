        "text": "Soul and R&B crooner Lionel Richie is well-known for hits like “Hello” and “All Night Long (All Night),” as well as for being a judge on American Idol. Due to a fruitful career and long-standing industry relationships, Richie has cemented himself as a musical icon having been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. He’s also known for being the father of pop culture mainstays Nicole, Sofia, and Miles Richie.\n\nDuring his first marriage, Richie adopted daughter Nicole and would go on to have two more children with his second wife years later. As Richie’s children have gotten married and started families of their own, you might be surprised how many celebrities have ties to the Richie family. Here’s a brief guide to help you keep the Richie family tree in order.\n\nLionel Richie\n\nLionel Richie performs in concert on July 6, 2023.\n\nBorn on June 20, 1949, in Tuskegee, Alabama, Lionel Richie got his musical start in the 1960s and would eventually help form a musical group called the Commodores alongside five other classmates at the Tuskegee Institute (now known as Tuskegee University). The group was wildly popular, producing seven No. 1 hits and even opened for the Jackson 5 in 1971. By 1982, though, Richie was ready to venture out on his own in pursuit of a solo career and released a self-titled album via Motown Records.\n\nRichie married Brenda Harvey, his college sweetheart, in 1975, and the two took over guardianship of young Nicole Richie in the 1980s. The couple officially adopted Nicole when she was 9 years old, before divorcing in 1993. Two years later, Lionel married Diane Alexander with whom he had his other two children, Miles and Sofia. Lionel and Diane were together for close to a decade before divorcing.\n\nIn 2022, Richie was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and even performed in the ceremony alongside Dolly Parton, Pat Benatar, Duran Duran, and others. Currently, the 74-year-old is on an international tour that concludes with a final performance at the end of November.\n\nRead More about Lionel Richie\n\nBrenda Harvey Richie\n\nRelation to Lionel: Ex-wife\n\nBrenda Harvey Richie adopted Nicole Richie with ex-husband Lionel Richie.\n\nBrenda Harvey Richie, 70, was Lionel’s first wife and met the singer while they both attended the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) and as Lionel’s musical career was taking off. The couple was were married for nearly 20 years, during which time they adopted Nicole Richie, before divorcing in 1993. It was a messy break.\n\nBrenda made headlines after she discovered Lionel was cheating on her with dancer Diane Alexander. Harvey showed up at Alexander’s Beverly Hills apartment and got into an altercation with both Lionel and Alexander before being booked on several charges. According to her Twitter profile, Harvey has a music publishing company Brenda Richie Publishing.\n\nNicole Richie\n\nRelation to Lionel: Daughter\n\nNicole and Lionel Richie in April 2012\n\nNicole Richie, 41, was born September 21, 1981, and is Lionel’s adopted daughter. Her birth parents, Karen Moss and Peter Escovedo, were friends with Lionel and granted him and his then-wife Brenda Harvey Richie guardianship of Nicole as a young child due to financial hardship and their strained romantic relationship. Nicole is also the niece of famous drummer and singer Sheila E, who is her biological father’s sister.\n\nNicole became a household name when starring on reality TV show The Simple Life alongside pal Paris Hilton. Nicole’s famous circle extends past her dad and Hilton, however, as she is married to Joel Madden of the pop-punk band Good Charlotte and is the goddaughter of Michael Jackson.\n\nSince her Simple Life days, Nicole has dabbled in acting and writing in addition to creating the jewelry line House of Harlow 1960 and a clothing line called Winter Kate. Nicole has two children with Madden, Harlow and Sparrow.\n\nRead More about Nicole Richie\n\nJoel Madden\n\nRelation to Lionel: Son-in-law\n\nJoel Madden and Nicole Richie, seen here in 2019, have been married for nearly 13 years.\n\nJoel Madden, 44, is the lead singer of the band Good Charlotte, which he started with his twin brother, Benji, in 1996. The Madden brothers were born on March 11, 1979, and grew up in Maryland. Their band has produced hits that include “The Anthem,” “Lifestyles Of The Rich and Famous,” and “I Just Wanna Live.”\n\nMadden began dating Nicole Richie in 2006, and the pair got married in December 2010. They had their first child, a daughter named Harlow, in January 2008. Nearly two years later, the couple welcomed their second-born, a son named Sparrow, in September 2009. Nicole and Joel prefer to keep the kids out of the spotlight, rarely posting either kid on their social media accounts.\n\nDiane Alexander Richie\n\nRelation to Lionel: Ex-wife\n\nMiles Richie with his mother, Diane Alexander Richie, in April 2012\n\nDiane Alexander Richie, 56, is Lionel’s second wife, whom he married in 1995 and subsequently divorced in 2004. Diane and Lionel share two children: Miles and Sofia.\n\nDiane’s relationship with Lionel can be traced back to an appearance she made as a dancer in his 1986 hit “Dancing On The Ceiling.” Although specifics are murky, Diane and Lionel allegedly began seeing each other while the singer was still married to Brenda Harvey Richie. Their 2004 divorce was costly for Lionel, as Diane earned an estimated $20 million due, in part, to expenses that included a monthly clothing allowance of $15,000 and an annual plastic surgery budget of $20,000.\n\nMiles Richie\n\nRelation to Lionel: Son\n\nMiles Richie attends an event in February 2020\n\nMiles Richie is the son of Lionel and his second wife, Diane Alexander Richie. The 29-year-old model, who made his runway debut in Philipp Plein’s Fall/Winter 2018 show, was born on May 27, 1994, and is a self-professed “mama’s boy.”\n\nSpeculation of a rift between Miles and his younger sister, Sofia, arose after Miles was missing from Sofia’s April 2023 wedding photos. But really, a bout of COVID-19 kept Miles from being able to attend. Miles told Essence that he enjoys listening to alt-rock and hip-hop and that his favorite R&B song is none other than his dad’s “Three Times A Lady.”\n\nSofia Richie Grainge\n\nRelation to Lionel: Daughter\n\nSofia Richie Grainge in May 2023\n\nSofia Richie Grainge, 24, is Lionel’s youngest child and shares close relationships with her older brother, Miles, and older sister, Nicole. Born August 24, 1998, to Diane Alexander Richie and Lionel, Sofia is currently a model, having shot her first campaign at 16 years old for Madonna’s Material Girl juniors’ clothing line, and Chanel ambassador. She is also the beauty director of the cosmetics brand Nudestix."
