        "text": "How old is Lionel Richie and where is he from?\n\nLionel Richie was born on June 20, 1949. He celebrated his 73rd birthday in 2022.\n\nHe was born and raised in Tuskegee, Alabama, and was the son of Lionel Brockman Richie Sr and Alberta R Foster.\n\nQUIZ: How well do you know Lionel Richie's classic lyrics?\n\nHe was a star tennis player in his youth, and once considered studying divinity to become a priest in the Episcopal Church, but eventually chose a musical career.\n\nIs Lionel Richie married?\n\nIn 1975, Lionel married his college sweetheart, Brenda Harvey.\n\nThe Story of... 'All Night Long' by Lionel Richie\n\nIn 1986, while he was still married, Lionel began a relationship with Diane Alexander.\n\nHe later separated from Harvey, who in 1988 allegedly discovered her husband and Alexander together in a Beverly Hills hotel room by saying she was \"room service.\"\n\nLionel and Harvey divorced in 1993 after nearly 18 years of marriage.\n\nHe married Diane Alexander in 1995, but the marriage ended in 2003.\n\nRemembering that time Lionel Richie and Daniel Bedingfield recorded a duet together\n\nFor the past few years, he has been in a relationship with Lisa Parigi, who is 40 years younger than the music legend.\n\nHow many children does Lionel Richie have?\n\nIn 1983, Lionel and his first wife adopted Nicole Camille Escovedo, the two-year-old daughter of one of the members of his band, and niece of drummer Sheila E.\n\nLionel Richie walks daughter Sofia down the aisle at traditional Jewish wedding in France\n\nThey raised her as their daughter, Nicole Richie, and adopted her legally when she was nine. She has since become a reality TV star, most famous for her show The Simple Life alongside Paris Hilton.\n\nWith his second wife, he has a son, Miles Brockman (born 1994), and a daughter, Sofia Richie (born 1998). Both are now models.\n\nIn 2017, Sofia was said to be dating reality TV star and Kardashian family member Scott Disick, something Lionel wasn't too happy about at the time. She has also dated Lewis Hamilton, Brooklyn Beckham and Justin Bieber among others.\n\nIn 2018, Miles was arrested at Heathrow Airport after being refused on a flight and threatening that he had a bomb. He was later released.\n\nLionel Richie pays emotional tribute to late friend Kenny Rogers: ‘I lost one of my closest friends’\n\nLionel became a grandfather in 2008, when Nicole Richie gave birth to a baby girl with the lead singer of US band Good Charlotte, Joel Madden. Richie's second grandchild was born to the couple in 2009.\n\nHow did Lionel Richie get his start in music?\n\nAs a student, Lionel started a number of R&B groups in the mid-1960s.\n\nIn 1968, he became a singer and saxophonist with the Commodores. They signed a contract with Atlantic Records in 1968 for one record, before joining Motown Records as a support act to The Jackson 5.\n\nRead more: The Story of... 'Hello' by Lionel Richie\n\nThe Commodores then started finding success in their own right, scoring hits with songs like 'Brick House', 'Easy' and 'Three Times a Lady'.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Lionel was writing hit songs for other artists, particularly the number one 'Lady' by lifelong friend Kenny Rogers.\n\nSpurred on by this success, Lionel left the Commodores in the early 1980s and embarked on a solo career, which paid off, as he became one of the most successful solo artists of the decade.\n\nHe soon scored massive hits with songs like 'All Night Long', 'Hello', 'Dancing on the Ceiling' and 'Endless Love'."
