        "text": "Penny Lover\n\nLionel Richie - Penny Lover (Official Music Video)\n\nThis was Lionel's third consecutive #1 single on Billboard’s Adult Contemporary Chart, as well as featuring in the top ten of the Hot 100.\n\nWritten with his then-wife Brenda Harvey-Richie, it was the fifth and final single from his huge album Can't Slow Down.\n\nJust for You\n\nLionel Richie - Just For You\n\nThis was the title track for Lionel's underrated 2004 album, which also featured duets with Lenny Kravitz and Daniel Bedingfield.\n\nThe sweet song is about the growing disillusionment we can feel as we grow up.\n\nTruly\n\nLionel Richie - Truly [Live]\n\nThis was Richie’s first proper solo single and also one of his biggest ballads.\n\nReleased in 1982, the song helped Lionel become a bonafide solo star away from his group The Commodores.\n\nRunning with the Night\n\nLionel Richie - Running With The Night\n\nLionel co-wrote this rock anthem with legendary songwriter Cynthia Weil, for his album Can't Slow Down.\n\nThe song also featured Toto's Steve Lukather and... Richard Marx (that won't be the last we'll hear from him!).\n\nEndless Love (with Diana Ross)\n\nDiana Ross & Lionel Richie Endless Love 1981\n\nQuite possibly the greatest duet of all time? Certainly one of the most successful.\n\nDiana and Lionel recorded this song for Motown, and it was used as the theme for the film adaptation of Scott Spencer's novel Endless Love.\n\nRead more: Lionel Richie has been trying to get Diana Ross to sing 'Endless Love' for 37 years\n\nWhile the film was a modest box-office success, the song became the second biggest-selling single of the year.\n\nStuck on You\n\nLionel Richie - Stuck on You\n\nThis reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the Adult Contemporary Chart, and saw Lionel take on a totally new sound.\n\nA fan of country music since his days living in Tuskegee, Lionel took a risk on the country sound and it worked wonders.\n\nSay You, Say Me\n\nLIONEL RICHIE - SAY YOU SAY ME (1985 official video HD)\n\nTopping three Billboard charts in the States, this track also bagged an Academy Award and a Golden Globe.\n\nIt was used for the movie White Nights, which also featured the song 'Separate Lives' by Phil Collins and Marilyn Martin.\n\nDancing on the Ceiling\n\nLionel Richie - Dancing On The Ceiling\n\nTaken from the 1986 album of the same name, this party anthem was a top 10 hit around the world.\n\nAfter the success of the album, Lionel actually took a hiatus from the music industry for six years. And not because he was recovering from a ceiling-related injury.\n\nHello\n\nLionel Richie - Hello (Official Music Video)\n\nRead more: The Story of... 'Hello'\n\nOne of Lionel's biggest ever hits, this song went to number one in both the UK and US in 1984.\n\nLionel initially felt that the song was \"corny\" but \"by the time I finished the verse, I fell in love with the song again\". And you've got to love that music video!\n\nAll Night Long (All Night)\n\nLionel Richie - All Night Long (All Night)\n\nRead more: The Story of... 'All Night Long'\n\nIn this Caribbean-influence song, Richie admitted that ‘African’ lyrics, such as ‘Tom bo li de say de moi ya’ and ‘Jambo jumbo’, were in fact made-up gibberish. He described these portions as a “wonderful joke”, after he discovered that he lacked the time to hire a translator.\n\nLionel said: “What I try to write about are real events. There will always be an easy like Sunday morning. There will always be an endless love. There will always be an all night long.”\n\nBonus fact: A young Richard Marx recorded backing vocals for this song."
