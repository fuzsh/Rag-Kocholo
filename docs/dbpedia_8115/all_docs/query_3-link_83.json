        "text": "Upcoming tracks include Hello (Lionel Richie), Against All Odds (Phil Collins), Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper), I Can’t Dance (Genesis)\n\nCover performances by Josh Gray, Mali Koa, VC Pines, Fiona Bevan, Jacob Neverhill and Nora Bart\n\nCollaboration is part of Concord Music Publishing’s REimagined initiative\n\nRolling out weekly at YouTube.com/mahoganysessions and across streaming platforms http://mhgny.lnk.to/Covers\n\nAs one of the world’s leading music publishers, home to over 400,000 copyrighted songs, Concord Music Publishing is a treasure chest of some of the world’s most celebrated compositions.\n\nIn the latest evolution of the publisher’s REimagined series, Concord has partnered with Mahogany to showcase a selection of their evergreen and iconic 80s classics, performed by some of the most exciting new and emerging talent, under the platform’s COVERS brand.\n\nREimagined, a sync and exploitation led initiative by the publisher, has seen the showcasing of catalogues including Andrew Lloyd Webber and Apple, the publishing arm of the Beatles label. The results have led to placements including Lyra’s version of the 1969 Jackie Lomax classic New Day on ITV’s Love Island and for leading e-bike Vanmoof’s European ad campaign.\n\nFor their 80s REimagined series, Concord Music Publishing have included copyrights from Lionel Richie (Hello), Phil Collins (Against All Odds), Cyndi Lauper (Time After Time), John Farnham (You’re The Voice), Wilson Philips (Hold On) and Genesis (I Can’t Dance).\n\nFormed in 2018, the Mahogany COVERS brand has been bringing together the greatest songs ever written and placing them in the capable hands of some of the UK’s most promising artists. The Concord sync team worked with Mahogany on the creative direction of the new recordings from Mali Koa, Flownn, Jacob Neverhill, VC Pines and Fiona Bevan.\n\nSara Lord, SVP International Sync and Project Development at Concord Music Publishing comments, “For our 3rd annual live REimagined event of the 80s we had a great plan involving a chequered dance floor and blow up flamingos strewn about the place… sadly that was not to be, so we wanted a partner who knew how to make something virtual feel as close to being in the actual room as possible.\n\n“Mahogany were a dream to work with, and their COVERS channel a natural fit. They understood what we needed and ultimately together we’ve created some wonderful sync friendly covers from our 80s catalogue. Oh and still managed to all have a disgustingly sweet Blue Lagoon cocktail whilst sporting mirror ball encrusted sunglasses. Job done.”\n\nImogen Reay, Sync Associate at Concord Music Publishing comments, “REimagined has always been a highlight in the sync team, and I’m so thankful that 2020 got to be the year of the 80s – we needed that energy. After carefully selecting the tracks at the start of the year (not knowing just how literal Genesis’ I Can’t Dance was going to become!) we took the brief to Mahogany COVERS. James and the team brought some epic independent talent to the project, combined with our own Josh Gray with Goldfingers and Fiona Bevan. Hearing them all transform these tracks and watching it all filmed in the slick COVERS aesthetic was a real high point. I can’t wait for the results to be shared with the world!”\n\nMahogany Partnerships Director, James Gaster, adds, “Working with the Concord team has been an absolute pleasure. We’ve really felt the benefit of their forensic knowledge of their catalogue and writers. It was great to collaborate as we selected the artists, connected those artists to the right songs and ensured that the arrangement, instrumentation and performance of those songs captured not only the magic of the song, as it was first written, but also giving each an entirely original feel which we expect to bring new audiences and sync placements to the songs and these artists.”\n\nABOUT THE ARTISTS\n\nMALI-KOA\n\nSydney born vocalist and songwriter Mali-Koa holds in high esteem the power of a well-written song.\n\nFeatured on JP Cooper’s All This Love and H Block’s INK Numbers Game, she also received her first international writing cut with artist G-Eazy on his title track The Beautiful and Damned. All steadfast signs that the focus for the artist remains in the simplicity of good music and collaborative work. “At the end of the day, when a song speaks to you in volumes effortlessly. That’s the kind of music I want to make.”\n\nFLOWNN\n\nWith a musical career spanning ten years, Flownn is the debut solo offering from Sophie-Rose Harper. With a history of fronting bands since 2011 and touring with the likes of Michael Kiwanuka, Paolo Nutini, Laura Mvula, Mystery Jets and Bruce Springsteen, Flownn has been in development since 2019, working with producers like Model Man, Pablo Nouvelle and Pearse Macintyre, she has honed her sound of distinct, honeyed vocals and bold, refreshing electro-pop.\n\nJACOBNEVERHILL\n\nJacobNeverhill is carving a name for himself with his ability to craft ethereal vocal melodies and atmospheric pop. The singer-songwriter and producer is an artist that fully dedicates himself to creating intimate soundscapes that anyone can appreciate and find a deep connection with. Drawing upon influences such as The 1975 and Kevin Garret.\n\nVC PINES\n\nVC Pines aka Jack Mercer is totally immersed in a well of alternative soul, poetry and punk performance.\n\nAlongside a seven-piece band – The Violet Collective, VC Pines delivers deep organ drones and trills to provide the dark underbelly for this gritty alt-soul avenue, sugarcoated by seventies-esque trumpet and trombone.\n\nFiona Bevan\n\nFiona Bevan is a Canadian-British songwriter, singer and multi-instrumentalist from Suffolk, UK, with a sweet, fiery voice and soulful, cinematic folk sound creating “startling odysseys that suggest Erykah Badu, Joanna Newsom and Kate Bush spine-tinglingly joined” (The Guardian).\n\nHer latest EP, ‘Wild Angels Sweet Demons’ went to number 3 in the iTunes UK and France singer-songwriter charts.\n\nNora Bart\n\nNora Bart is a singer-songwriter from the Netherlands, now residing in the UK. Inspired by the works of Tory Kelly, John Mayer and Alessia Cara, Nora’s music carries the raw honesty of who she is in the songs that she writes and performs. Nora released her first record in April this year titled Speak Your Mind, which had already amassed several thousand streams and has been featured on a number of playlists. Nora is set to release some new music in the new year but after her success with artist JacobNeverhill on their duet record Lost, she is currently focussing on a covers EP project to be released through Mahogany Records."
