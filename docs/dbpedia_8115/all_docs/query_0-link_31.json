It's the biggest-selling new album of 2012, but a quick look at the charts shows there are plenty of other country songs made in his image.\n\nA Cover Album Is A Tiny Museum Of Songs\n\nLooking back over several new (and drastically different) albums of cover songs reveals that it's been a very good year for assertive, interpretive pop music.\n\nHello? Is This The Country Album You're Looking For?\n\nOn Tuskegee, country artists like Tim McGraw help re-imagine the ballads that made Lionel Richie famous.\n\nHello? Is This The Country Album You're Looking For?\n\nListen Â· 8:20 8:20"
