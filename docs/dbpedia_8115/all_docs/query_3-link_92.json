        "text": "Fans were disappointed “all night long.”\n\nLionel Richie was slammed by viewers of King Charles’ coronation concert over his lackluster performance for the newly minted monarch on Sunday.\n\nRichie, 73, took the stage in front of 20,000 people and belted his greatest hits, such as “All Night Long” — which skyrocketed the Alabama native to fame in 1983 — and “Easy,” which Richie sang with the Commodores in 1977.\n\nSeveral underwhelmed Twitter users likened Richie’s voice to the Muppet Kermit the Frog or that of a karaoke singer in a bar.\n\n“Hello, Met Police, I’d like to report a murderer. Yes, his name is Lionel Richie and the victim is his own song,” tweeted one angry viewer.\n\n“If anyone finds some lost keys in Windsor they belong to Lionel Richie,” teased another.\n\n“Lionel Richie sounds awful,” simply stated a third person.\n\n“OK, is it just me or has Lionel Richie lost the ability to sing?” tweeted a fourth person. “He doesn’t sound like himself at all.”\n\nOther Twitter users defended the singer and blamed the issues on the sound equipment.\n\n“The sound of the main microphone is awful for all who used it,” defended one user.\n\n“This is a cruise ship concert. It’s absolutely shocking,” tweeted a second person.\n\nThe Post reached out to Richie for comment.\n\nRichie was not the only high-profile celebrity to perform at the concert. His fellow “American Idol” judge Katy Perry also made an appearance on the stage after him, and she belted out a few of her own hits.\n\nPerry, 38, was cemented in coronation history after the “Roar” singer was spotted looking confused inside Westminster Abbey and then tripping and nearly falling to the ground following the ceremony.\n\nAlso appearing onstage was the British pop group Take That and former Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger, 44, who claimed to be having a real “Disney princess moment” while singing “Reflections” from the film “Mulan.”\n\nClassical stars such as pianist Lang Lang and opera singer Andrea Bocelli also appeared on the next day’s concert bill.\n\nThe musical celebration came just one day after the coronation ceremony, which took place on Saturday, May 6, at Westminster Abbey.\n\nIt marked the official transfer of power from the late Queen Elizabeth II, who died in September at the age of 96.\n\nPrince Harry was also in attendance for his father’s ascent to the throne, marking the royal’s first time back in the United Kingdom since releasing his bombshell memoir “Spare” in January.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex attended the ceremony without his wife, Meghan Markle, and was back on a plane to Los Angeles moments after the coronation ceremony had concluded.\n\nHe spent less than 24 hours in the UK."
