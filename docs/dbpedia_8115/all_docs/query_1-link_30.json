        "text": "He's had some amazing songs!\n\nPop icon Lionel Richie has sold over 90 million records worldwide, and bagged four Grammy Awards - making him one of the biggest-selling pop music artists of all time!\n\nAnd he's on his way to Belfast this weekend to kick off an epic month of music at Belsonic in Ormeau Park.\n\nRising to fame as a songwriter and co-lead singer of The Commodores, Lionel then led an incredibly successful solo career, even bringing shows to the UK in 2023, including a very special performance for the Coronation Concert on 7th May.\n\nHis impressive back catalogue includes 'Three Times a Lady' and 'Nightshift' as part of The Commodores, and 'Hello', 'Dancing on the Ceiling' and 'All Night Long (All Night)' as a solo artist.\n\nWho is Lionel Richie?\n\nLionel Richie was born in Tuskagee, Alabama on 20th June 1949 and he grew up on the campus of Tuskagee Institute. Music wasn’t his first love. Believe it or not, Lionel Richie accepted a tennis scholarship from the Tuskagee Institute before dropping out in his second year.\n\nHe also considered studying divinity with a view to becoming a priest in the Episcopal Church, but that idea was soon knocked on the head as his interest in music grew.\n\nWhat band was Lionel Richie in?\n\nLionel Richie joined The Commodores in 1968 as the group’s singer and saxophonist. Having released their debut album on Atlantic Records, the band moved to Motown where they became The Jackson 5’s support band.\n\nBy the end of the 70s, The Commodores were the label’s most popular act and had become a regular chart fixture on both sides of the Atlantic. Lionel’s songwriting prowess was going from strength to strength.\n\nIn addition to penning smash hits ‘Easy’, ‘Still’ and the UK Number 1 ‘Three Times A Lady’, Lionel Richie had started writing for other artists, most notably country star Kenny Rogers, for whom he wrote the UK Top 20 hit, ‘Lady’.\n\nIf that wasn’t enough to keep him busy, he also wrote the theme song for the Brooke Shields-starring movie Endless Love, which he recorded as a duet with former Supremes singer Diana Ross. A global hit in 1981, Lionel Richie decided to go solo.\n\nWATCH: The Commodores perform 'Three Times A Lady':\n\nLionel Richie: Solo career\n\nHaving quit The Commodores, Lionel Richie embarked on a highly successful solo career. His first solo single, ‘Truly’, went Top 10 in the UK but it was 1983’s ‘All Night Long (All Night)’ that saw Lionel Richie taken to the nation’s heart as it peaked at Number 2.\n\nBilly Joel's wildly popular ‘Uptown Girl’ kept it off the top slot. Interestingly, the video was produced by former Monkees guitarist Mike Nesmith and directed by Bob Rafelson, who’d created the 60s TV series.\n\nLionel topped the UK charts a year later with the ballad, ‘Hello’. Promoted by a now famous video, Lionel played the part of an acting teacher whose seemingly unrequited love for a blind student is returned when she sculpts a likeness of his head.\n\nDuring the filming of the video, he complained to director Bob Giraldi that the bust didn’t look much like him. The director turned to Lionel and said, “Lionel, she’s blind. End of subject.\"\n\nThe single’s parent album, ‘Can’t Slow Down’, won the GRAMMY for Album of the Year in 1984. In the same year, Lionel’s superstar status was cemented when he performed at the closing ceremony of the Olympic games in Los Angeles.\n\nMore UK hit singles followed in the shape of ‘Stuck On You’, ‘Penny Lover’, ‘Say You, Say Me’ and the ever-popular ‘Dancing On The Ceiling’.\n\nWATCH: Lionel Richie - Dancing On The Ceiling\n\nDid Lionel Richie retire?\n\nLionel Richie entered a state of semi-retirement and, apart from three new tracks in 1992, didn’t release an album until 1996’s ‘Louder Than Words’, which has been followed by a steady stream of modestly successful albums.\n\nIs Lionel Richie married?\n\nLionel Richie has been married twice. He married his first wife, Brenda Harvey, in 1975 and they adopted two-year-old Nicole Camille Escovedo in 1983. She was raised as Nicole Richie. The couple divorced in 1993.\n\nLionel then married Diane Alexander in 1995. Their son, Miles Brockman was born in 1994, and their daughter, Sofia Richie, was born in 1998. However, their marriage ended in 2003.\n\nWhere is Lionel Richie now?\n\nLionel Ritchie is still performing, appearing at the 2015 Glastonbury Festival and bringing shows to the UK and Europe in 2023!\n\nHe is also currently a judge on American Idol, which began its 21st season in February 2023.\n\nIn April 2023, Lionel was announced as a performer at the Coronation Concert to celebrate the Coronation of King Charles III. He will be joined by Take That, Katy Perry, Freya Ridings and more.\n\nIs Lionel Richie in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?\n\nLionel Richie was announced as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 2022 inductees on 4th May 2022. He was inducted with the other shortlisted artists on 5th November at a ceremony held in Los Angeles.\n\nLionel Richie receives Gershwin Prize\n\nLionel Richie has been honoured with the Library of Congress' Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, which is an award given to a living musician for their lifetime achievement in promoting a song genre.\n\nFellow artists and friends of Lionel - Gloria Estefan, Boyz II Men, Chris Stapleton, and Luke Bryan - along with host Anthony Anderson paid tribute to the music legend at a concert. They performed some of his and Commodores biggest hits at DAR Constitution Hall on 9th March.\n\nPast recipients of the award include Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder, Billy Joel and Carole King.\n\nTake a look through some of Lionel Richie's biggest career moments:\n\nDon't forget to tune into Downtown Radio to hear Lionel Richie's songs.\n\nNow Read:\n\nBelsonic 2023 Guide: Stage times & important info\n\nNew foodie spot opens in Belfast catering to all tastebuds\n\nNiall Horan adds second Belfast date on upcoming 'The Show' tour\n\nHow to listen to Downtown Radio:\n\nTune into Northern Ireland's Home of Great Music, Downtown Radio on FM, AM, DAB Digital Radio, online, on our Rayo app and by asking your smart speaker to 'Play Downtown Radio'.
