        "text": "If you're under the age of 30, you might know Lionel Richie best as the father of Simple Life reality television star and tabloid favorite Nicole Richie.\n\nBut if you're just a bit older, you might remember that Lionel Richie is an award-winning singer, songwriter and producer. As the lead singer of the popular 1970s soul/R&B group The Commodores, he topped the charts with songs such as \"Lady\" and \"Zoom.\"\n\nRichie left The Commodores in 1981 and went on to become a huge success as a solo artist, with ballads and love songs that became the soundtrack to a lot of romantic moments in the 1980s.\n\nRichie is still recording and performing, and his new CD, Coming Home, continues a tradition of pure pop craftsmanship that shows he's still at the top of his game.\n\nCopyright 2022 NPR.
