        "text": "Lionel Richie\n\nPop singer, songwriter\n\nFor the Record…\n\nSelected discography\n\nSources\n\nLionel Richie “now stands at the pinnacle of pop music, recognized around the world as the most successful singer/songwriter working today,” Charles Whitaker announced in a 1987 Ebony article. “His string of nine No. 1 hits,” Whitaker continued, “in nine consecutive years, is a music business record.” Richie began as a lead singer with the Commodores, a funk/pop group that came to the attention of music fans in the early 1970s, and started forging his distinguished solo career in 1982. Since that time he has garnered many awards, including three Grammys, several American Music Awards, and a 1986 Oscar for Best Original Song with his hit theme to the film White Knights, “Say You, Say Me.”\n\nRichie was born in Tuskegee, Alabama. His mother and father, a school principal and a systems analyst for the U.S. Army, respectively, lived on the campus of Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), where his grandfather had worked with the college’s founder, black leader Booker T. Washington. As a child, Richie was exposed to many different kinds of music, particularly by his maternal grandmother, Adlaide Foster, who taught him piano and preferred classical composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven. Even then, Richie showed signs of the talent he would later become, though his grandmother did not then appreciate this fact: “During my lessons,” Richie recalled for Todd Gold in People, “I kept trying to make up my own songs, and it annoyed her.” The fledgling artist was also influenced by the ballets and symphonies he attended at Tuskegee, but he preferred listening to gospel, rhythm and blues, and country.\n\nRichie eventually enrolled in Tuskegee Institute; his initial goal was to become an Episcopal priest. He brought with him a saxophone that an uncle had given him as a child, though he did not know how to play it—according to Gold, “he thought it would help him meet girls.” Regardless, it helped Richie to meet five other Tuskegee freshmen who were forming a musical group and sought him out because they heard he had a saxophone. Apparently, Richie’s lack of prowess on the instrument proved no obstacle—he told Robert E. Johnson in Ebony that the men who would later become the Commodores “took … two years to find out that I’d had no training on the sax.” While Richie and the group practiced, aspiring to, as he put it for interviewer Lynn Van Matre of the Chicago Tribune, “revolutionize the music business,” or “come out with a new sound, you know, and kill them,” he also gave up his clerical ambitions in favor of an economics major and an accounting minor, which helped both the Commodores and himself in later business dealings.\n\nFor the Record…\n\nFull name, Lionel B. Richie, Jr.; born c. 1949, in Tuskegee, Ala.; son of Lionel, Sr. (a systems analyst) and Alberta (a school principal) Richie; married Brenda Harvey (a musical production assistant), 1975. Education: Graduated from Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), 1974.\n\nJoined musical group the Commodores while in college; left group to become solo recording artist and concert performer, 1982. Has written songs and produced records for other performers, including Kenny Rogers.\n\nAwards: Winner of three Grammy Awards; six American Music Awards; two American Black Achievement Awards from Ebony magazine and one People’s Choice Award; Academy Award for best original song in a motion picture (White Knights), 1986, for “Say You, Say Me.”\n\nAddresses: Residence —Beverly Hills, Calif. ; and Tuskegee, Ala. Office-— 1112 N. Sherbourne Dr., Los Angeles, CA 90069.\n\nThe Commodores first began to gather a following when they won the opportunity to open for the Jackson Five’s concerts in the early 1970s. Around the same time, they signed a contract with Motown Records, and after a two-year period of searching for the right producer and arranger, began to put out albums. At first the Commodores gained a reputation for party and dance music with disco-oriented hits like the instrumental “Machine Gun,” and the song responsible for the dance craze of the same name, “Bump.” Another of their most popular singles was “Brickhouse.”\n\nBut by the mid-1970s, most of the Commodores, including Richie, started to feel that funky dance tunes were too ephemeral. They wanted to move towards writing and recording ballads, which they thought more likely to become timeless standards. In the same period, Richie worked more intensely on his songwriting skills than previously. The Commodores’ 1975 album Caught in the Act contained their first ballad hits, “Sweet Love,” and “Just to Be Close to You.” They followed these up with more slow songs, which gained popularity in large measure due to Richie’s romantic lyrics and smooth singing voice. “Easy,” “Three Times a Lady,” “Sail On,” and “Still” confirmed Richie and the Commodores’ change of style.\n\nRichie was already working on other projects in 1980, including producing an album and writing the song “Lady” for country artist Kenny Rogers. In 1982 Richie decided to leave the Commodores to pursue a solo career, though his decision was not due to conflicts within the group. His first album on his own, Lionel Richie, gained him a hit with “Truly,” which also won him his first Grammy, as Best Male Vocalist, in 1983. His string of hits, some of which helped Richie earn his music business record, includes 1983’s “All Night Long,” “Penny Lover,” and “Hello” ; and 1987’s “Dancing on the Ceiling.” Richie has also had great success with film themes such as “Endless Love” and the Oscar-winning “Say You, Say Me.” Perhaps his most far-reaching and influential musical project, however, was the song “We Are the World,” which Richie co-wrote with pop superstar Michael Jackson. The disc was recorded by U.S.A. for Africa, and its profits were donated to the cause of famine relief in Ethiopia.\n\nRichie believes his success as a songwriter comes from God, whom he told Johnson was his “co-composer.” He explained further: “I give credit to my co-writer because all I did was write down what He told me to write down.” Richie also revealed to Johnson that he prefers to collaborate during the night. “In other words,” he said, “from about eleven to about seven in the morning is a very wonderful time because… God ain’t worried with too many other folks… I know He is very busy during the day, so I wait for late night, and it works for me.”\n\nRegardless of the authorship of Richie’s songs, along with the phenomenal mainstream popularity that he enjoys come accusations from some critics that he has abandoned his black musical roots, especially after the hit he recorded with the country group Alabama, “Deep River Woman.” Richie responded to this issue for Whitaker in Ebony: “I’m trying through my music to break the stereotype that says to satisfy Black people you have to play something funky. I’m broadening the base, trying to show that Black artists are capable of playing all kinds of music.”\n\nSelected discography\n\nWith the Commodores; on Motown\n\nMachine Gun (includes “Machine Gun” and “Bump”), 1974.\n\nCaught in the Act (includes “Zoom,” “Sweet Love,” and “Just to Be Close to You”), 1975.\n\nCommodores (includes “Easy” and “Three Times a Lady”), 1977 .\n\nMidnight Magic (includes “Sail On” and “Still”), 1979.\n\nHeroes (includes “Jesus is Love,” “Got to Be Together,” and “An Old-Fashioned Love”), 1980.\n\nAlso recorded the song “Brickhouse.”\n\nSolo LPs; on Motown\n\nLionel Richie (includes “Truly,” “You Are,” and “My Love”), 1982.\n\nCan’t Slow Down (includes “All Night Long” and “Penny Lover”), 1983.\n\nSay You, Say Me (includes “Say You, Say Me”), 1986.

Richie achieved a string of successes matched by few other popular songwriters, with his compositions rising to the Number One position on the U.S. pop singles chart at least once in every year between 1977 and 1985. The most successful interpreter of Richie’s songs was Richie himself, and for a quarter century the quintessential romantic balladeer has touched Americans of all races and all walks of life.\n\nRichie’s musical personality was formed at one of African America’s crucial intellectual sites: Alabama’s Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University). He was born on June 20, 1949, and his childhood home was actually on the school’s campus, where his father, a U.S. Army systems analyst, lived with his mother, an educator who later became a school principal. Richie’s musical education drew on the diverse sonic streams that passed through Tuskegee. His maternal grandmother favored classical music and reacted coolly to her grandson’s first forays into pop songwriting. Northern black pop and southern soul found their ways to Tuskegee. Hoping at one point to become an Episcopal minister, Richie gravitated toward gospel music. He was also influenced by another tradition whose reach among African Americans is sometimes underestimated: “Because it was the South, it was hard not to hear country music,” he was quoted as saying in the Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock & Soul.\n\nJoined Group at Tuskegee\n\nEnrolling at Tuskegee himself, Richie joined forces with a group of other students he met at a talent show; the attraction for the others was that Richie owned a saxophone. Richie, for his own part, was successful in concealing the fact that he barely knew how to play it. A gifted musician who had taught himself to play the piano by ear, Richie made rapid strides as a performer and composer at Tuskegee. The group, first called the Mystics, became the Commodores after the word was picked at random out of a dictionary. Richie discarded his religious ambitions in favor of courses in economics and accounting that proved ideal training for a career in the financially cutthroat music business.\n\nThe Commodores struggled for a time, gaining fans across Alabama but losing all their equipment to van\n\nAt a Glance…\n\nBorn Lionel B. Richie Jr., on June 20, 1949, in Tuskegee, Alabama; son of Lionel Richie Sr., a systems analyst, and Alberta Richie, an educator; married Brenda Harvey, a musical production assistant, 1975 (divorced); one daughter, Nicole; married, Diane Alexander, a clothing designer, 1996; one son, Miles, and one daughter, Sofia. Education: Graduated from Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee, AL, 1974.\n\nCareer: Vocalist and songwriter. Joined group the Commodores while in college; group signed to Motown Records, early 1970s; released debut recording Machine Gun, 1974; recorded platinum-selling ballad “Three Times a Lady,” 1978; numerous other hits with Commodores, 1970s; began solo production work and composition for other artists, late 1970s; released solo debut album on Motown, Lionel Richie, 1982; four top-selling solo albums for Motown; co-composed and recorded “We Are the World” African famine relief recording, 1985; released Louder than Words album on Mercury label, 1996; released Time album, 1998.\n\nSelected awards Three platinum albums; four gold albums; 18 Grammy nominations and four awards; 12 American Music Awards; five People’s Choice Awards for Best Song; numerous other industry awards; Academy Award, “Say You, Say Me”, 1986; honorary doctorate, Tuskegee University, 1986.\n\nAddresses: Publicist —Rogers & Cowan, 475 Park Ave., 32nd floor, New York, NY 10016.\n\nthieves on a 1969 trip to New York. But they bounced back, landing a series of club appearances and signing on with a manager, Benny Ashburn, who would stay with them until his death during Richie’s years of solo stardom. Signing briefly to the Atlantic record label they went nowhere, but when they attracted the attention of Motown Records executive Suzanne de Passe in 1971, they gained wide exposure when she slated them as the opening act for many of the tours of that label’s family-act dynamo, the Jackson Five.\n\nGrouped Moved Toward Ballads\n\nThe heavy funk sound of the Commodores did not fit the polished, smoothed Motown mold, however, and the group’s first record for the label, Machine Gun, was not released until 1974. That album and successors performed solidly, and the group broke through to the pop Top Ten with the ballad “Sweet Love” in 1976. That song, a Richie composition, also marked a new direction musically for the group. Although earlier singles such as 1975’s “Slippery When Wet” had been primarily dance-oriented, the group came to believe that the secret to long-lasting success lay in the cultivation of romantic balladry. “Sweet Love” proved only the first of a series of romantic numbers from Richie’s pen: “Just to Be Close to You” and “Easy” rose into the pop Top Ten.\n\nMost successful of all was 1978’s “Three Times a Lady,” whose waltz tempo perhaps showed the influence of the country music Richie had heard as a young man. That song, a feature of weddings for years to come, achieved platinum status for sales of one million copies, as did the album, Natural High, from which it was taken. The song propelled the Commodores and the increasingly dominant Richie to national stardom. The Commodores enjoyed a string of hits between 1978 and 1981, and no ill will arose between the group members. But Richie found himself in demand for his own creative talents alone. He wrote and produced “Lady” for pop superstar Kenny Rogers in 1980, and followed it up with “Endless Love,” a duet he recorded with Diana Ross. These songs remained atop the U.S. pop charts for six and nine weeks respectively.\n\nWhether recorded with the Commodores, by other artists, or on his own, Richie’s ballads were instantly identifiable. Simple and seemingly inevitable in their gentle progressions, they noted Richie’s considerable craft as a songwriter. Richie played to his strengths on his debut solo album, Lionel Richie, which was released in 1982. Its hit singles “Truly” and “You Are” closely followed the style of the Commodores’ chart successes.\n\nComposed “We Are The World”\n\nRichie’s second and third solo albums, 1983’s Can’t Slow Down and 1986’s Dancing on the Ceiling, broadened his reach. “All Night Long,” the lead single from Can’t Slow Down, was an upbeat, tropical-flavored dance piece that resembled none of the leading R&B, disco, and funk dance styles of the time. These albums were among the biggest successes of the 1980s, and Can’t Slow Down was claimed to be the best-selling release in the history of the Motown label. Gaining Richie even more acclaim and publicity than any of his solo efforts, though, was the all-star recording “We Are the World,” which he co-composed with fellow pop superstar Michael Jackson and recorded with an all-star lineup of artists. Profits from sales and performances of the song went toward African famine relief.\n\nBy the late 1980s, Richie had few worlds left to conquer. He continued to enter into collaborative efforts, winning an Academy Award for Best Song and notching yet another Number One single for the song “Say You, Say Me” from the film White Nights. He tapped the country vein yet again in a recording he composed for and performed with the country group Alabama, “Deep River Woman.” In 1992 Richie released the Back to Front greatest-hits package; it included “Do It to Me,” a new song that once again topped the charts. Richie moved to the Mercury label in the 1990s, releasing the modestly successful Louder Than Words (1996) and Time (1998); these discs largely avoided any updating of Richie’s sound with contemporary hip-hop influences. In the year 2000 Richie raised his profile somewhat when he appeared as the opening act on the farewell tour of soul superstar Tina Turner, and planned a new release, Renaissance, that featured the teen-oriented Backstreet Boys.\n\nSelected discography\n\nLionel Richie, Motown, 1982.\n\nCan’t Slow Down, Motown, 1983.\n\nDancing on the Ceiling, Motown, 1986.\n\nBack to Front, Motown, 1992.\n\nLouder than Words, Mercury, 1996.\n\nTime, Mercury, 1998.\n\nRenaissance, 2000.\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nContemporary Musicians, volume 2, Gale, 1990.\n\nLarkin, Colin, ed., The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Muze UK, 1998.\n\nRomanowski, Patricia, and Holly George-Warren, The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll, Fireside, 1995.\n\nStambler, Irwin, The Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock & Soul, St. Martin’s, 1989.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nEntertainment Weekly, April 21, 2000, p. 75.\n\nJet, August 30, 1999, p. 32.\n\n—James M.

According to CNN, Diane was seeking financial support in keeping with the couple's previously extravagant lifestyle, which included spending as much as $300,000 per month. In official documents released to the court, Diane claimed that she spent as much as $15,000 per month on clothing and $20,000 per year on cosmetic surgery. Shortly after their divorce, Diane and her alleged lover, Daniel Serrano, were accused of using Diane's house to perform illegal plastic surgery procedures involving an injection that was purported to ease the signs of aging. Diane was arrested and charged with two counts of aiding and abetting.\n\nAfter 2003, Richie's adopted daughter from his first marriage, Nicole Richie, began gaining fame of her own largely owing to her association with Paris Hilton and appearance on the reality television series The Simple Life. Nicole's celebrity life was tumultuous, including a widely publicized arrest for possession of heroin in 2003 and a second arrest in 2006 for driving under the influence of alcohol. In addition, after 2006, a number of tabloid journalists speculated that she had developed an eating disorder. Nicole's various problems soon brought Richie's family life into question, and he appeared in numerous interviews defending his daughter's behavior and expressing his hope that she would find a solution to her problems. Richie expressed his regret at not having been a better father, owing to his busy work schedule, but affirmed his intention to help his daughter in whatever way he could.\n\nRichie's 2006 album, Coming Home, marked a turning point in his career, as the album was his most popular in more than a decade and debuted at number six in Billboard's top two hundred album rankings. Richie conducted an extensive publicity tour that was followed by a series of concerts in small venues across the United States. With an increasing base of fans and a number-one ranked single, \"I Call It Love,\" Richie was asked to perform at the 2007 Grammy Awards. Richie's 2007 concert series featured songs from the span of his solo career blended with new compositions and classics from his time with the Commodores.\n\nAs he neared sixty, Richie had cemented his place as one of the premier R&B artists of his generation. Though his recent life has been filled as much with family strife as with professional success, he continues to be a force in the music industry, by blending his R&B roots with the popular music of a new generation. In a 2006 interview with National Public Radio's Tony Cox, Richie reflected on his career, \"It's not where you've been, it's where you're going…. We start out with nothing, then the rest of it in-between is, who did you touch, how did you affect them, and what memories do they have of you?\"\n\nSelected discography\n\nAlbums\n\nLionel Richie, Motown, 1982.\n\nCan't Slow Down, Motown, 1983.\n\nDancing on the Ceiling, Motown, 1986.\n\nBack to Front, Motown, 1992.\n\nLouder than Words, Mercury, 1996.\n\nTime, Mercury, 1998.\n\nRenaissance, 2000.\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nContemporary Musicians, Volume 2, Gale, 1990.\n\nLarkin, Colin, ed., The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Muze UK, 1998.\n\nRomanowski, Patricia, and Holly George-Warren, The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll, Fireside, 1995.\n\nStambler, Irwin, The Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock, and Soul, St. Martin's, 1989.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nEntertainment Weekly, April 21, 2000, p. 75.\n\nJet, August 30, 1999, p. 32.\n\nOakland Tribune, November 28, 2006.\n\nPeople, July 20, 1998, p. 39.\n\nSan Diego Union Tribune, December 4, 2004.\n\nOnline\n\nCox, Tony, \"A Tuneful ‘Coming Home’ for Lionel Richie,\" National Public Radio,http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6057529 (accessed December 20, 2007).\n\n\"Lifestyle of the Richie and Famous,\" CNN Online,http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/03/03/offbeat.people.richie.reut/index.html (accessed December 20, 2007).\n\n\"Lionel Richie: Nicole Made Mistakes,\" ABC News Online,http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=3445473 (accessed December 20, 2007).\n\n—James M. Manheim and Micah L. Issit\n\nLionel Richie\n\nSinger, songwriter\n\nThe ballads written and sung by Lionel Richie, both as part of the group the Commodores and during an impressive solo career, have formed a soundtrack for countless American romances from the 1970s on. Richie achieved a string of successes matched by few other popular songwriters, with his compositions rising to the number one position on the American pop singles chart at least once in every year between 1977 and 1985. After a recording hiatus of ten years, Richie returned to the national spotlight in the late 1990s with Louder than Words, and was still going strong into the 2000s. The most successful interpreter of Richie's songs is Richie himself, and for a quarter century the quintessential romantic balladeer has touched Americans of all races and all walks of life.\n\nRichie's musical personality was formed at one of African America's crucial intellectual sites: Alabama's Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University). He was born on June 20, 1949, and his childhood home was actually on the school's campus, where his father, a U.S. Army systems analyst, lived with his mother, an educator who later became a school principal. Richie's musical education drew on the diverse sonic streams that passed through Tuskegee. His maternal grandmother favored classical music and reacted coolly to her grandson's first forays into pop songwriting. Northern black pop and southern soul found their ways to Tuskegee. Hoping at one point to become an Episcopal minister, Richie gravitated toward gospel music. He was also influenced by another tradition whose reach among African Americans is sometimes underestimated: \"Because it was the South, it was hard not to hear country music,\" he was quoted as saying in the Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock & Soul.\n\nJoined Group at Tuskegee\n\nEnrolling at Tuskegee himself, Richie joined forces with a group of other students he met at a talent show; the attraction for the others was that Richie owned a saxophone. Richie, for his own part, was successful in concealing the fact that he barely knew how to play it. A gifted musician who had taught himself to play the piano by ear, Richie made rapid strides as a performer and composer at Tuskegee. The group, first called the Mystics, became the Commodores after the word was picked at random out of a dictionary. Richie discarded his religious ambitions in favor of courses in economics and accounting that proved ideal training for a career in the financially cutthroat music business.\n\nThe Commodores struggled for a time, gaining fans across Alabama but losing all their equipment to van thieves on a 1969 trip to New York. But they bounced back, landing a series of club appearances and signing on with a manager, Benny Ashburn, who would stay with them until his death during Richie's years of solo stardom. Signing briefly to the Atlantic record label they went nowhere, but when they attracted the attention of Motown Records executive Suzanne de Passe in 1971, they gained wide exposure when she slated them as the opening act for many of the tours of that label's brother-act dynamo, the Jackson Five.\n\nGroup Moved Toward Ballad Releases\n\nThe heavy funk sound of the Commodores did not fit the polished, smoothed Motown mold, however, and the group's first record for the label, Machine Gun, was not released until 1974. That album and successors performed solidly, and the group broke through to the pop Top Ten with the ballad \"Sweet Love\" in 1976. That song, a Richie composition, also marked a new direction musically for the group. Although earlier singles such as 1975's \"Slippery When Wet\" had been primarily dance-oriented, the group came to believe that the secret to long-lasting success lay in the cultivation of romantic balladry. \"Sweet Love\" proved only the first of a series of romantic numbers from Richie's pen: \"Just to Be Close to You\" and \"Easy\" rose into the pop Top Ten.\n\nMost successful of all was 1978's \"Three Times a Lady,\" whose waltz tempo perhaps showed the influence of the country music Richie had heard as a young man. That song, a feature of weddings for years to come, achieved platinum status for sales of one million copies, as did the album, Natural High, from which it was taken. The song propelled the Commodores and the increasingly dominant Richie to national stardom. The Commodores enjoyed a string of hits between 1978 and 1981, and no ill will arose between the group members. But Richie found himself in demand for his own creative talents alone. He wrote and produced \"Lady\" for pop superstar Kenny Rogers in 1980, and followed it up with \"Endless Love,\" a duet he recorded with Diana Ross. These songs remained atop the American pop charts for six and nine weeks respectively.\n\nWhether recorded with the Commodores, by other artists, or on his own, Richie's ballads were instantly identifiable. Simple and seemingly inevitable in their gentle progressions, they deemphasize Richie's considerable craft as a songwriter. For his own part, Richie credited God as his \"co-composer\" in an interview with Ebony writer Robert E. Johnson quoted in Contemporary Musicians. Richie played to his strengths on his debut solo album, Lionel Richie, which was released in 1982. Its hit singles \"Truly\" and \"You Are\" closely followed the style of the Commodores' chart successes.\n\nFor the Record …\n\nBorn Lionel B. Richie, Jr., on June 20, 1949, in Tuskegee, AL; son of Lionel Richie Sr., a systems analyst, and Alberta Richie, an educator; married Brenda Harvey, a musical production assistant, 1975 (divorced); married Diane Alexander, a clothing designer, 1996 (divorced, 2003); children: Nicole, Miles, Sofia. Education: Graduated from Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee, AL, 1974.\n\nJoined group the Commodores while in college; group signed to Motown Records, early 1970s; released debut recording Machine Gun, 1974; recorded platinum-selling ballad \"Three Times a Lady,\" 1978; numerous other hits with Commodores, 1970s; began solo production work and composition for other artists, late 1970s; released solo debut album on Motown, Lionel Richie, 1982; four top-selling solo albums for Motown; co-composed and recorded \"We Are the World\" African famine relief recording, 1985; released Louder than Words album on Mercury label, 1996; released Time album, 1998; released Renaissance on the Island label, 2001; released Just for You on Island, 2004.\n\nAwards: Grammy Awards, Pop Male Vocal for \"Truly,\" 1992; Album of the Year for Can't Slow Down, 1984; Producer of the Year, Non-Classical, 1984; Song of the Year, for \"We Are the World,\" 1985; many American Music Awards and People's Choice Awards; Oscar Award, Best Original Song for \"Say You, Say Me,\" 1986; honorary doctorate, Tuskegee University, 1986.\n\nAddresses: Record company—Universal Music Group, 2220 Colorado Ave., Santa Monica, CA 90404. Website—Lionel Richie Official Website: http://www. lionelrichie.com/.\n\nComposed \"We Are the World\"\n\nRichie's second and third solo albums, 1983's Can't Slow Down and 1986's Dancing on the Ceiling, broadened his reach. \"All Night Long,\" the lead single from \"Can't Slow Down,\" was an upbeat, tropical-flavored dance piece that resembled none of the leading R&B, disco, and funk dance styles of the time. These albums were among the biggest successes of the 1980s, and Can't Slow Down was claimed to be the best-selling release in the history of the Motown label. Gaining Richie even more acclaim and publicity than any of his solo efforts, though, was the all-star recording \"We Are the World,\" which he co-composed with fellow pop superstar Michael Jackson and recorded with an all-star lineup of artists. Profits from sales and performances of the song went toward African famine relief. By the late 1980s, Richie had few worlds left to conquer. He continued to enter into collaborative efforts, winning an Academy Award for Best Song and notching yet another Number One single for the song \"Say You, Say Me\" from the film White Nights. He tapped the country vein yet again in a recording he composed for and performed with the country group Alabama, \"Deep River Woman.\"\n\nIn 1992, Richie released the Back to Front greatest-hits package; it included \"Do It to Me,\" a new song that once again topped the charts. Richie moved to the Mercury label in the 1990s, and after a long break from recording, released the modestly successful Louder Than Words (1996) and Time (1998); these discs largely avoided any updating of Richie's sound with contemporary hip-hop influences.\n\nIn the year 2000 Richie raised his profile somewhat when he appeared as the opening act on the farewell tour of soul superstar Tina Turner, and penned a new release, 2001's Renaissance, that featured the teen-oriented Backstreet Boys. Richie also found himself in the spotlight in 2003 and 2004 when his daughter, Nicole, starred in the reality television show Simple Life with hotel heiress Paris Hilton. Richie followed his 2001 album Renaissance with a great hits set, The Definitive Collection, in 2003, and in 2004 with Just for You. All Music Guide deemed Just for You one of his better albums of late, calling it \"assured and unassuming, relaxed and tuneful.\"\n\nSelected discography\n\nSolo albums\n\nLionel Richie, Motown, 1982.\n\nSlow Down, Motown, 1983.\n\nDancing on the Ceiling, Motown, 1986.\n\nBack to Front, Motown, 1992.\n\nLouder than Words, Mercury, 1996.\n\nTime, Mercury, 1998.\n\nRenaissance, Island, 2001.\n\nThe Definitive Collection, Universal, 2003.\n\nJust for You, Island, 2004.\n\nWith the Commodores\n\nMachine Gun, Motown, 1974.\n\nCaught in the Act, Motown, 1975.\n\nMovin' On, Motown, 1975.\n\nHot on the Tracks, Motown, 1976.\n\nCommodores, Motown, 1977.\n\nCommodores Live!, Polygram, 1977.\n\nNatural High, Motown, 1978.\n\nMidnight Magic, Motown, 1979.\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nLarkin, Colin, editor, The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Muze UK, 1998.\n\nRomanowski, Patricia, and Holly George-Warren, The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll, Fireside, 1995.\n\nStambler, Irwin, The Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock & Soul, St. Martin's, 1989.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nEntertainment Weekly, April 21, 2000, p. 75.\n\nJet, August 30, 1999, p. 32; June 21, 2004, p. 56.\n\nPeople, July 20, 1998, p. 39.\n\nOnline\n\n\"The Commodores,\" All Music Guide,http://www.allmusic.com (July 10, 2004).\n\n\"Lionel Richie,\" All Music Guide,http://www.allmusic.com (July 8, 2004).\n\n—James M. Manheim andMichael Belfiore\n\nLIONEL RICHIE\n\nBorn: Tuskegee, Alabama, 20 June 1949\n\nGenre: R&B, Pop\n\nBest-selling album since 1990: Louder Than Words (1996)\n\nHit songs since 1990: \"Do It to Me,\" \"Don't Wanna Lose You\"\n\nAgentle romantic crooner, Lionel Richie achieved stardom in the 1980s and early 1990s by applying his wistful vocals to a hit series of tender love songs. Best known for his ballads, Richie also excelled at up-tempo dance numbers that exuded a good-time party atmosphere. With his soft-spoken, conservative manner Richie came across as the romantic guy next door, an every-man who shunned sexual explicitness in favor of love, dedication, and unity. Due to a combination of personal problems and changing trends in popular music, Richie lost his popular foothold as the 1990s progressed, but took steps to regain it near the end of the decade.\n\nRichie was raised on the campus of Alabama's prestigious Tuskegee Institute, where his grandmother gave classes in classical piano and his mother taught elementary school. In the early 1970s, while attending college at Tuskegee, Richie joined the soul and funk group the Commodores, which went on to become one of the most commercially successful groups of the decade. By the end of the 1970s Richie was taking a larger role within the group, writing and singing lead on several of its most popular songs, including \"Three Times a Lady\" (1978) and \"Still\" (1979). In 1982 Richie left the Commodores for a solo career and made his career breakthrough with Can't Slow Down (1983), which sold over 10 million copies. On songs like the party anthem \"All Night Long (All Night)\" and the love ballads \"Hello,\" \"Penny Lover,\" and \"Stuck on You,\" Can't Slow Down perfectly captured the feel-good, upwardly mobile atmosphere of the early 1980s, before AIDS exerted its stranglehold on the nation's consciousness. \"Hello,\" one of the most popular singles of 1984, is a prime example of Richie's greeting-card lyrical approach: \"I long to see the sunlight in your hair / And tell you time and time again how much I care.\"\n\nAfter a follow-up album, Dancing on the Ceiling (1986), Richie virtually dropped from sight, embroiled in a prolonged divorce from his first wife, Brenda, the muse who inspired some of his most successful songs. Brenda's allegations, which included charges of spousal abuse, flew in the face of Richie's nice-guy image. After additional troubles—throat problems, losing a best friend to AIDS, the death of his father—Richie took a self-imposed hiatus from the music industry in 1987, a break that lasted nearly a decade. He managed to score a final number one rhythm and blues hit in 1992 with \"Do It to Me,\" an energetic midtempo song that recalled the sweet feel of his 1980s hits, but otherwise fell out of the public spotlight.\n\nBy the time Richie came back on the scene in 1996, a lot had changed within the music industry. The romantic courtliness informing his best work had fallen out of fashion, giving way to the frank sexual wordplay of artists such as D'Angelo. Seeking to keep his style fresh, Richie released a comeback album, Louder Than Words (1996), that enlisted the services of hot 1990s producers and writers Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. Although the years had frayed Richie's smooth baritone, Louder Than Words features several self-penned ballads, including \"Nothing Else Matters\" and \"Don't Wanna Lose You,\" that capture his former warmth and honesty. On the other hand, critics found the up-tempo \"I Wanna Take You Down\" to be an awkward attempt at contemporary raunchiness. Singing lines such as, \"Let's go deep undercover . . . you choose the style,\" Richie sounds forced and uncomfortable.\n\nIn 1998 Richie released a follow-up album, Time, featuring one of the best ballads of his comeback years, \"I Hear Your Voice.\" Against a lush backdrop of strings and female voices supplying breathy \"oohs\" and \"aahs,\" Richie emotes over the pain of a lost love: \"I thought I'd finally learned to get on with my life / Then it all comes back . . . I hear your voice.\" Echoing the tactic employed decades earlier on \"Still,\" Richie even speaks the final line, \"I hear your voice,\" in a hushed whisper, a potentially saccharine moment made memorable by Richie's sincerity. In 2001 Richie signed with a new label, Island, and released Renaissance, a collection of mostly up-tempo tracks designed to push him even further in a contemporary direction. Encore, a live album containing new performances of his biggest hits, followed in 2003.\n\nWith his heartfelt songs and simple, direct singing, Lionel Richie is a down-to-earth, likable pop star, with the talent to tap into the current of human feeling. Speaking to the Washington Post in 2001, he accurately summarized his appeal: \"I write about love. It's the only topic that does not go out of style. . . . I write songs that people can relate to in their everyday lives.\"\n\nSELECTIVE DISCOGRAPHY:\n\nLionel Richie (Motown, 1982); Can't Slow Down (Motown, 1983); Dancing on the Ceiling (Motown, 1986); Louder Than Words (Mercury, 1996); Time (Mercury, 1998); Renaissance (Island, 2001); Encore (Universal, 2003).\n\nWEBSITE:\n\nwww.lionelrichie.com.\n\ndavid freeland\n\nRichie, Lionel\n\nRichie, Lionel , composer and performer of romantic ballads; b. Tuskegee, Ala., June 20, 1949. The Commodores , popular soul band of the late 1970s. Membership : Lionel Richie, voc, kybd., sax.; Thomas McClary, gtr. (b. Oct. 6, 1950); Milan Williams, kybd. (b. March 28, 1949); William King, trpt. (b. Jan. 30, 1949); Ronald LaPread, bs. (b. Sept. 4, 1950); Walter “Clyde” Orange, drm. (b.Dec. 10, 1947). J. D. Nicholas (b. Watford, Hereford, England, April 12, 1952) replaced Lionel Richie in 1982.\n\nStarting out as a funk dance band, The Commodores evolved into a highly popular soul band of the late 1970s, based on Lionel Richie’s ingenuous romantic ballads. As Motown Records’ first successful selfcontained band, The Commodores rivaled the popularity of Stevie Wonder as a company act and Earth, Wind and Fire as a soul band. Beginning solo work in 1981 and leaving the band in 1982, Lionel Richie sustained his reputation as a consummate craftsman of mellow yet compelling love ballads, particularly with the 1983 album Can’t Slow Down.\n\nFormed in 1968 at Tuskegee Inst. (now Tuskegee Univ.) in Ala. by the merger of The Mystics and The Jays, the Commodores developed a regional reputation as a funk dance band before moving to N.Y. in 1969. Signed to Atlantic Records for one unsuccessful album, the band switched to Motown in 1971 and toured for the next three years as opening act to The Jackson Five. They scored their first major pop and near-smash R&B hit with Milan Williams’s instrumental “Machine Gun” in 1974.\n\nAfter Thomas McClary’s funky “Slippery When Wet” hit in 1975, The Commodores began featuring ballads written and sung by Richie, achieving smash pop hits with his “Sweet Love,” “Just to Be Close to You,” and “Easy.” Although their next hits were the funky band compositions “Brick House” and “Too Hot to Handle,” they quickly returned to the ballad format and scored the top pop hit “Three Times a Lady” and the smash pop hits “Sail On” and “Still.” In the Pocket yielded “Lady (You Bring Me Up)” and “Oh No” in 1981, the year Richie began solo work. He wrote the top hit “Lady” and produced Share Your Love for Kenny Rogers; he also wrote and sang in duet with Diana Ross the top hit “Endless Love.”\n\nLionel Richie left The Commodores in 1982, and was replaced by J. D. Nicholas. They eventually scored a smash hit with a tribute to Marvin Gaye and Jackie Wilson, “Nightshirt,” in 1985. Ron La Pread left after the hit, as had Thomas McClary in 1984. By 1986 the Commodores had switched to Polydor Records. In the 1990s, with William King, J. D. Nicholas, and Walter Orange as mainstays, The Commodores recorded for Commodores Records.\n\nIn the meantime, Lionel Richie’s debut album yielded the three smash hits “Truly,” “You Are,” and “My Love.” His second album, Can’t Slow Down, included the two top hits “All Night Long (All Night)” and “Hello,” plus the smash hits “Running with the Night,” “Stuck on You,” and “Penny Lover.” In early 1985 Richie cowrote with Michael Jackson the “We Are the World” single, recorded by scores of popular artists, which raised more than $50 million for famine relief in Africa. His next album produced six hits: the top “Say You, Say Me” (from the movie White Nights), the smashes “Dancing on the Ceiling,” “Love Will Conquer All,” and “Ballerina Girl,” plus the major “Deep River Woman” (with the country group Alabama) and “Se La.” Beset by personal problems, Richie withdrew from recording and performing in the late 1980s, eventually reemerging with Back to Front, the hit “Do It to Me,” and a world tour in 1992. However, he failed to produce a follow-up to this album as of 1995.\n\nDiscography\n\nTHE COMMODORES : Machine Gun (1974); Caught in the Act (1975); Movin’ On (1975); Hot on the Tracks (1976); The Commodores (1977); Live!
