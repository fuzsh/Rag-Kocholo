        "text": "International superstar Lionel Richie boasts a discography of albums and singles that is second to none. With more than 125 million albums sold worldwide, an Oscar®, Golden Globe®, and four Grammy Awards®*, Richie has been honored with distinctions including 2016 MusicCares Person of the Year, 2017 Kennedy Center Honors, and the 2022 Gershwin Prize for Popular Song by the Library of Congress. In 2022, he was both inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and received the 2022 American Music Awards Icon Award, his 18th AMA award. The legendary singer, songwriter, producer, and Tuskegee, Alabama native is a true music icon.\n\nRichie is known for his mega hits such as “Endless Love,” “Lady,” “Truly,” “All Night Long,” “Penny Lover,” “Stuck on You,” “Hello,” “Say You, Say Me,” and “Dancing on the Ceiling.” He co-wrote the 1985 song “We Are the World,” recorded by the history-making supergroup USA for Africa. Richie’s song catalog also includes his early work with The Commodores, where he developed a groundbreaking style that defied genre, penning smashes such as “Three Times a Lady,” “Still,” and “Easy.” Richie is one of only two solo songwriters who has written eight number one hits that made the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nA dedicated philanthropist, in 2019 Richie was named Global Ambassador and first Chairman of the Global Ambassador Group for The Prince’s Trust, a charity founded by King Charles III. In this role, Richie supports the charity as it sets to work on a new global remit, tackling issues such as youth education and unemployment, supporting indigenous youth and helping build sustainable communities. Richie was also honored at 2019’s Annual Power of Love Gala in Las Vegas for his support of Keep Memory Alive, the Cleveland Clinic’s center for improving the lives of those affected by brain disorders.\n\nNow completed his 6th season, Richie serves as a judge on ABC’s “American Idol.” His 7th season on the panel is set to debut in spring 2024. Also in 2024, Richie continues his longtime residency, now at the Wynn Encore Theater, in “Lionel Richie: King of Hearts.” In 2023, Richie concluded his acclaimed 20-city “Sing A Song All Night Long” arena tour featuring special guests—one of the best-selling bands of all time—Earth, Wind & Fire. The tour kicked off in St. Paul, with stops across North America in Chicago, Toronto, and New York, and finished with a showstopping performance at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles."
