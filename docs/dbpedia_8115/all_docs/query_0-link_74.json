        "text": "Are you ready to go back in time with some old-school jams? Because Lionel Richie and Earth, Wind & Fire are bringing their most memorable songs on the road with them this summer for the “Sing A Song All Night Long Tour.” Today (March 6), Richie made the video announcement on Instagram. The 73-year-old songwriter wore a black shirt and jacket as he shared the news while fans could watch glimpses of past performances of the Alabama native and the popular ’70s/’80s band.\n\n“Well, my friends, the time has come to announce a tour,” the “Easy” songwriter said. “Not just any tour, but the tour I’ve been trying to do for years. And now it’s going to actually happen. ‘Sing A Song All Night Long.’ Lionel Richie, Earth, Wind, & Fire, together on the same stage, and I’m inviting you to the party. So join us; this is the place you need to be.”\n\nRichie rose to fame in the 1970s as a songwriter and the co-lead singer of the Motown group Commodores. In 1981, he wrote and produced the single “Endless Love,” which he recorded as a duet with fellow icon Diana Ross. A year later, Richie launched his solo career with his debut album, Lionel Richie. It sold over 4 million copies.\n\nNow, the four-time Grammy Award-winning singer judges the singing competition show “American Idol.” He joined during its 16th season and has held onto his chair ever since. The show has launched several well-known artists’ careers, including EGOT recipient Jennifer Hudson, Fantasia, Jordan Sparks, and Ruben Studdard."
