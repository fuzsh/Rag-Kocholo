        "text": "Loeb & Loeb represented legendary recording artist and entrepreneur Lionel Richie in connection with his brand ambassador partnership with financial technology and insurance provider Acrisure.\n\nAccording to a company press release, as a brand ambassador, Lionel will engage with broadcast and social media to raise awareness and generate excitement as Acrisure expands its direct-to-consumer offerings. He will also be a source of inspiration as he participates in other marketing efforts to highlight Acrisure's transformation into a broad fintech services provider.\n\n\"Acrisure could have coasted on its reputation as a massive player in the insurance industry, but it hasn't. Instead, it avoided the complacency that comes with success and has embraced innovation in so many ways. As a result, Acrisure has emerged as a true leader in the Fintech space,\" Lionel said in a statement. \"From what I've seen, its culture really values empathy - a sign that you can be focused on growth without forgetting where you started. At the end of the day, that's the type of company I want to work with.\"\n\nThe Loeb & Loeb deal team that represented Lionel was led by Arash Khalili, co-chair of the firm’s Capital Markets & Corporate practice and Sports industry practice, Brand Protection partner and deputy chair Bess Morgan and Corporate partner Mike Grossman. The team also included partners Michael Gerald and Ryan Austin; and associates Camila Piedrahita Abello and Ryan Raccuia.\n\nFor more information, please see the company’s press release."
