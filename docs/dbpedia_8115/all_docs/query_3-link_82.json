        "text": "Sofia Richie and Nicole Richie showed support for their dad, Lionel Richie, at his final Sing A Song All Night Long tour stop, which included special guests Earth, Wind and Fire.\n\nThe sisters took to Instagram to post about the event. Sofia, 25, and Nicole, 41, stood to the right of the stage at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles on Friday, September 15, screaming their dad‚Äôs name as he sang to the crowd and periodically leaned over the side of the stage to wave at his two girls.\n\nLionel, 74, posted the adorable video of his daughters to his Instagram account, captioning it: ‚ÄúTake your Kids to Work Day turned out well‚Ä¶ üòÇ‚Äù\n\nDuring the concert, Lionel performed several of his greatest hits for fans, including ‚ÄúEndless Love,‚Äù ‚ÄúHello‚Äù and ‚ÄúStuck On You.‚Äù\n\nSofia wore a vintage Lionel T-shirt for the event, while Nicole opted for a simple black tank top which she accessorized with gold jewelry.\n\nJimmy Kimmel, Magic Johnson and former Major League Baseball player Dave Winfield were also in attendance. Lionel posted an Instagram photo of them backstage at the concert with the caption: ‚ÄúStarting a band‚Ä¶üòÇ‚Äù.\n\nIt‚Äôs no surprise that Nicole and Sofia were on hand to celebrate their dad as the two sisters have maintained a close relationship over the years. Nicole, who was adopted by Lionel and then-wife Brenda Harvey when she was 9 years old, served as the Maid of Honor at Sofia‚Äôs lavish April wedding to music executive Elliot Grainge in the South of France.\n\nTo commemorate the occasion, Nicole posted a photo of herself kneeling at Sofia‚Äôs feet in her wedding dress with the caption: ‚ÄúI love you more than anything,‚Äù followed by a white heart and bride emoji."
