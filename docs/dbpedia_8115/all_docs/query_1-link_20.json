        "text": "Background\n\nLionel Richie, the son of Lionel Brockman Richie, Sr., a U.S. Army system analyst, and Alberta R. Foster, a teacher, was born on June 20, 1949, in Tuskegee, Alabama. He started his musical journey by joining the Mystics, a campus band, as a saxophonist, songwriter, and singer in his first year at Tuskegee University. The Mystics later became the Commodores, a funk and rhythm-and-blues band, with Richie as the lead vocalist. In 1968, they signed a one-record deal with Atlantic Records and then moved on to Motown Records. Richie composed and sang numerous romantic, easy-listening ballads throughout his life. Richie’s first commercial hit as a songwriter came in 1974 when he co-wrote ‘Happy People’ with Jeffrey Bowen and Donald Baldwin. It was recorded by The Temptations, who achieved their second-to-last No. 1 R&B hit with the song, which was originally planned as a Commodores single. Richie also sang the title song for the film “Endless Love,” a duet with Diana Ross, in 1981. The song was released as a single and went on to become one of Motown’s biggest hits in Canada, Brazil, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the U.S.\n\nRichie’s solo career began in 1982 with the release of his album “Lionel Richie.” The following years were a blur, with multiple number-one hits and a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Richie and pop icon Michael Jackson penned ‘We Are the World’ in 1985 to raise money for African famine relief; the song raised $50 million in donations and won a Grammy for song of the year. Richie’s late-90s albums, including “Louder Than Words” and “Time,” failed to equal his earlier commercial success. He reissued compilation C.D. of his career both with Commodores and as a solo act which propelled him back to the top of the U.K. albums list. Richie was revealed as a judge for the reboot of American Idol by A.B.C. in September 2017. He has served as a judge on the relaunch for five seasons, including its most recent edition, which premiered on February 27, 2022. In 2019, Richie announced a 33-city summer tour across North America. His ‘Hello Tour’ began on May 10 at the KAABOO Festival in Arlington and continued through August.\n\nRichie married his college sweetheart, Brenda Harvey, in 1975. The couple, in 1983, adopted Nicole Camille Escovedo (now Nicole Richie). The singer and Harvey divorced in 1993, and he married Diane Alexander in 1995. They have a son, Miles Brockman (28), and a daughter, Sofia Richie (24). The marriage ended in 2004."
