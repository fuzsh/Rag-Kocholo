Originally intended as a side project at the suggestion of Motown, it was recorded and released while Richie was still a member of the Commodores; he left the group shortly after the album's release. The first single from the album, \"Truly\", topped the Billboard Hot 100. Follow-up single \"You Are\" reached number four, and \"My Love\" reached number five. The album reached number one on the Cashbox albums chart on December 11, 1982.[5]\n\nIn 2003, Lionel Richie was re-released as part of a remaster series that saw two additional tracks added: a solo version of \"Endless Love\" and an instrumental version of \"You Are\". Eagles member Joe Walsh provided the guitar solo for the song \"Wandering Stranger\".\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nMusicians\n\nLionel Richie – lead vocals, vocal arrangements, backing vocals (1, 2, 3, 5-8), acoustic piano (4, 6, 8), Fender Rhodes (7), rhythm arrangements (7)\n\nGreg Phillinganes – Fender Rhodes (1), Roland Jupiter 8 (1), Minimoog (1), arrangements (1)\n\nClarence McDonald – Fender Rhodes (2)\n\nMichael Lang – acoustic piano (2, 9), Fender Rhodes (9)\n\nDavid Cochrane – Prophet-5 (3), electric guitar (3, 7), synthesizer bass (3, 7), backing vocals (3, 7), arrangements (3, 5), acoustic piano (5), bass guitar (5), saxophone solo (5)\n\nMichael Boddicker – synthesizers (3, 5, 8), vocoder (3, 5, 8)\n\nBill Payne – Fender Rhodes (6)\n\nThomas Dolby [uncredited] – synthesizer programming (7), backing vocals (7)\n\nPaul Jackson Jr. – electric guitar (1, 2, 6)\n\nFred Tackett – acoustic guitar (2)\n\nJoe Walsh – guitar solo (2)\n\nRichie Zito – guitar solo (3)\n\nDarrell Jones – electric guitar (4, 5, 7), acoustic guitar (8)\n\nTim May – acoustic guitar (6)\n\nNathan Watts – bass guitar (1)\n\nJoe Chemay – bass guitar (2, 6, 8)\n\nNathan East – bass guitar (4)\n\nJohn Robinson – drums (1, 5, 7)\n\nLeon \"Ndugu\" Chancler – drums (2, 4)\n\nPaul Leim – drums (3, 6, 8)\n\nLenny Castro – percussion (1)\n\nPaulinho da Costa – percussion (2, 5, 7)\n\nRick Shlosser – percussion (5)\n\nGene Page – arrangements (2, 6, 9)\n\nHarry Bluestone – concertmaster (2-9)\n\nJames Anthony Carmichael – arrangements (3, 4, 5, 8), string arrangements (3, 7), horn arrangements (7), rhythm arrangements (7), celeste (8)\n\nHoward Kenney – backing vocals (1, 5, 7)\n\nRichard Marx – backing vocals (1, 2, 7, 8)\n\nDeborah Thomas – backing vocals (2, 3, 5, 7)\n\nJimmy Connors – backing vocals (3)\n\nKenny Rogers – backing vocals (4), BGV arrangement (4)\n\nKin Vassy – backing vocals (4)\n\nTerry Williams – backing vocals (4)\n\nHorns, strings and woodwinds\n\nLouise Di Tullo – flute (3, 6, 9)\n\nArt Maebe – French horn (3, 4, 6, 8, 9)\n\nRichard Perissi – French horn (3, 6, 9)\n\nHenry Sigismonti – French horn (3, 6, 9)\n\nJim Atkinson – French horn (4, 8)\n\nDavid Duke – French horn (4, 8)\n\nBrian O'Connor – French horn (4, 8)\n\nWilliam Green – saxophone (5, 7)\n\nErnie Watts – saxophone (5, 7)\n\nLew McCreary – trombone (4, 5, 7, 8)\n\nBill Reichenbach, Jr. – trombone (4, 5, 7, 8)\n\nGary Grant – trumpet (4, 5, 7, 8)\n\nJerry Hey – trumpet (4, 5, 7, 8)\n\nWalter Johnson – trumpet (4, 5, 7, 8)\n\nWarren Luening – trumpet (4, 5, 7, 8)\n\nBob Findley – trumpet (5, 7)\n\nDon Ashworth – woodwinds (4, 8)\n\nGene Cipriano – woodwinds (4, 8)\n\nGary Herbig – woodwinds (4, 8), saxophone (5, 7)\n\nLarry Williams – woodwinds (4, 8)\n\nJesse Ehrlich – cello (2, 3, 6, 9)\n\nArmand Kaproff – cello (2, 3, 6, 9)\n\nPaula Hochhalter – cello (2, 6, 9)\n\nDennis Karmazyn – cello (2, 6, 9)\n\nArni Egilsson – double bass (2, 6, 9)\n\nBuell Neidlinger – double bass (2, 6, 9)\n\nRay Brown – double bass (4, 5, 7, 8)\n\nMorty Corb – double bass (4, 5, 7, 8)\n\nGayle Levant – harp (2, 4-9)\n\nAlan DeVeritch – viola (2, 3, 6, 9)\n\nAllan Harshman – viola (2, 3, 6, 9)\n\nVirginia Majewski – viola (2, 3, 6, 9)\n\nGareth Nuttycombe – viola (2, 3, 6, 9)\n\nBonnie Douglas – violin (2, 3, 6, 9)\n\nAssa Drori – violin (2, 3, 6, 9)\n\nEndre Granat – violin (2, 3, 6, 9)\n\nJoy Lyle – violin (2, 3, 6, 9)\n\nDonald Palmer – violin (2, 3, 6, 9)\n\nHenry Roth – violin (2, 3, 6, 9)\n\nSheldon Sanov – violin (2, 3, 6, 9)\n\nJack Shulman – violin (2, 3, 6, 9)\n\nPaul Shure – violin (2, 3, 6, 9)\n\nMari Tsumura-Botnick – violin (2, 3, 6, 9), strings (4, 5, 7, 8)\n\nCharles Veal, Jr. – violin (2, 3, 6, 9)\n\nRollice Dale – strings (4, 5, 7, 8)\n\nHenry Ferber – strings (4, 5, 7, 8)\n\nRonald Folsom – strings (4, 5, 7, 8)\n\nWilliam Henderson – strings (4, 5, 7, 8)\n\nWilliam Kurasch – strings (4, 5, 7, 8)\n\nErno Neufeld – strings (4, 5, 7, 8)\n\nNathan Ross - strings (4, 5, 7, 8)\n\nMyron Sandler – strings (4, 5, 7, 8)\n\nDavid Schwartz – strings (4, 5, 7, 8)\n\nFred Seykora – strings (4, 5, 7, 8)\n\nDavid Speltz – strings (4, 5, 7, 8)\n\nTibor Zelig – strings (4, 5, 7, 8)\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nProducers – James Anthony Carmichael and Lionel Richie\n\nProduction Assistant – Brenda Harvey-Richie\n\nRecorded and Mixed by Calvin Harris\n\nSecond Recording Engineer – Jim Cassell\n\nSecond Mix Engineers – Michael Johnson, Fred Law and Stephan Smith.\n\nAdditional Mixing – Jane Clark\n\nMastered by Bernie Grundman at A&M Studios (Los Angeles, CA).\n\nCreative Assistant – Rita Leigh\n\nArt Direction – Johnny Lee\n\nPhotography – David Alexander\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications and sales\n\n[edit]"
