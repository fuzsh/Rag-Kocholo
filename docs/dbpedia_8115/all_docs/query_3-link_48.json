        "text": "In the booklet to his new posthumous release Life Is Like a Song, the late Kenny Rogers is quoted: \"Music is the greatest memory-maker you'll ever encounter. A song can lock you right into a memory for a lifetime.\" Rogers' own music, whether \"The Gambler,\" \"Through the Years,\" \"Lady,\" \"She Believes in Me,\" \"You Decorated My Life,\" or \"Islands in the Stream,\" certainly proves that adage. The Texas-born singer, who passed away in 2020 at the age of 81, blurred the lines between country and pop\n\nKenny Rogers released the 28th and final studio album of his lifetime with 2015's Once Again It's Christmas. On June 2, UMe will celebrate the late superstar's musical legacy with a posthumous release featuring eight previously unreleased tracks and two rarities. Life Is Like a Song, coming on CD, vinyl, and digital formats, has been curated and executive produced by his widow Wanda Rogers. It's also Rogers' first studio album to debut on vinyl in the U.S. since 1991. Life Is Like a Song\n\nWelcome to The Weekend Stream, a relaxing weekly review of notable digital-only catalogue titles.

We recently reviewed the U.S.' reissue of the definitive Motown: The Complete No. 1s box set. Now, the U.K. is getting into the act with a different 3-CD, 60-song anthology of its own.

That's the campaign slogan for Universal Japan's ongoing program celebrating the venerable label's 60th anniversary. And indeed, the influence of Motown - still the most successful African-American-founded record label of all time - can't be underestimated when considering the current music scene.

Universal's U.K. arm has issued a double disc set of 20 classic club mixes from the label, curated by noted remixer John Morales.
