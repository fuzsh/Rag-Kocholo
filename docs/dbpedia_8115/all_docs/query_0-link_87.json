        "text": "Megahits like “All Night Long,” “Hello” and “Three Times a Lady” helped make Lionel Richie one of the best-known artists of the 1980’s, but to the generation who was in diapers when he was dancing on the ceiling, he’s not an international superstar but something far less fabulous: a father.\n\n“Young people come up to me all the time and say, ‘Oh my God, you’re Nicole Richie’s dad; I just saw you on ‘The Simple Life,’ ” he said one recent morning in his sprawling Manhattan hotel suite. “They have no idea who I am or what I’ve done.”\n\nWhat he’s done in his three-decades-long career is sell nearly 100 million albums worldwide, win five Grammys and earn an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his hit “Say You, Say Me,” from the “White Nights” soundtrack. While he enjoyed success with the R&B band the Commodores, Mr. Richie became a household name with his solo debut, “Lionel Richie,” and its even more successful follow-up, “Can’t Slow Down,” which on the strength of ballads like “Stuck on You” and “Penny Lover” sold more than 10 million copies. He used his fame for good when he and Michael Jackson wrote “We Are the World,” a song that raised more than $50 million for African famine relief.\n\nIn recent years his once blazing hot career has cooled, but now Mr. Richie is hoping to regain relevance with a new album, “Coming Home,” which will be released today by Island/Def Jam. In an effort to ensure that his latest effort doesn’t end up being largely ignored like several of his recent albums, he has teamed up with young hit-making producers like Jermaine Dupri, Dallas Austin and Raphael Saadiq. “I asked them, ‘What does Lionel Richie sound like in 2006?’ ” Mr. Richie said, “And they said, ‘The same way he sounded like in 1976 — we’ll just bring you new beats.’ ”\n\nWhile the album’s feel and lyrics are vintage Richie, the beats are indeed updated. “I Call It Love,” for example, sounds like a track that could have easily appeared on the album by the young R&B singer Ne-Yo. “All Around the World,” with its aggressive horns and strings, could be dubbed “All Night Long 2006.” And Mr. Dupri said “What You Are” was his modern interpretation of “Hello.” Still, Mr. Dupri, who helped resurrect Mariah Carey’s floundering career, said he was not interested in turning Mr. Richie into the next Usher or Justin Timberlake.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
