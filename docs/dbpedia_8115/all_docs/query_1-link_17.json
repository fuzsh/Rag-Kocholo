        "text": "He's an icon!\n\nPop icon Lionel Richie has sold over 90 million records worldwide, and bagged four Grammy Awards - making him one of the biggest-selling pop music artists of all time! Rising to fame as a songwriter and co-lead singer of The Commodores, Lionel led an incredibly successful solo career, which is still ongoing!\n\nHis impressive back catalogue includes hits like 'Three Times a Lady' and 'Nightshift' as part of The Commodores, as well as 'Hello', 'Dancing on the Ceiling' and 'All Night Long (All Night)' as a solo artist. Read up on everything Lionel Richie right here on Greatest Hits Radio...\n\nWho is Lionel Richie?\n\nLionel Richie was born in Tuskagee, Alabama and grew up on the campus of Tuskagee Institute. Music wasn‚Äôt his first love - believe it or not, Lionel Richie accepted a tennis scholarship from the Tuskagee Institute before dropping out in his second year.\n\nHe also considered studying divinity with a view to becoming a priest in the Episcopal Church, but that idea was soon knocked on the head as his interest in music grew.\n\nHow old is he?\n\nLionel was born on 20th June 1949, making him currently 75-years-old.\n\nWhat band was Lionel Richie in?\n\nLionel Richie joined The Commodores in 1968 as the group‚Äôs singer and saxophonist. Having released their debut album on Atlantic Records, the band moved to Motown where they became The Jackson 5‚Äôs support band.\n\nBy the end of the 70s, The Commodores were the label‚Äôs most popular act and had become a regular chart fixture on both sides of the Atlantic. Lionel‚Äôs songwriting prowess was going from strength to strength.\n\nIn addition to penning smash hits ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô, ‚ÄòStill‚Äô and the UK Number 1 ‚ÄòThree Times A Lady‚Äô, Lionel Richie had started writing for other artists, most notably country star Kenny Rogers, for whom he wrote the UK Top 20 hit, ‚ÄòLady‚Äô.\n\nIf that wasn‚Äôt enough to keep him busy, he also wrote the theme song for the Brooke Shields-starring movie Endless Love, which he recorded as a duet with former Supremes singer Diana Ross. A global hit in 1981, Lionel Richie decided to go solo.\n\nWATCH: The Commodores perform 'Three Times A Lady':\n\nLionel Richie: Solo career\n\nHaving quit The Commodores, Lionel Richie embarked on a highly successful solo career. His first solo single, ‚ÄòTruly‚Äô, went Top 10 in the UK but it was 1983‚Äôs ‚ÄòAll Night Long (All Night)‚Äô that saw Lionel Richie taken to the nation‚Äôs heart as it peaked at Number 2.\n\nBilly Joel‚Äôs wildly popular ‚ÄòUptown Girl‚Äô kept it off the top slot. Interestingly, the video was produced by former Monkees guitarist Mike Nesmith and directed by Bob Rafelson, who‚Äôd created the 60s TV series.\n\nLionel topped the UK charts a year later with the ballad, ‚ÄòHello‚Äô. Promoted by a now famous video, Lionel played the part of an acting teacher whose seemingly unrequited love for a blind student is returned when she sculpts a likeness of his head.\n\nDuring the filming of the video, he complained to director Bob Giraldi that the bust didn‚Äôt look much like him. The director turned to Lionel and said: ‚ÄúLionel, she‚Äôs blind. End of subject.\"\n\nThe single‚Äôs parent album, ‚ÄòCan‚Äôt Slow Down‚Äô, won the GRAMMY for Album of the Year in 1984. In the same year, Lionel‚Äôs superstar status was cemented when he performed at the closing ceremony of the Olympic games in Los Angeles.\n\nMore UK hit singles followed in the shape of ‚ÄòStuck On You‚Äô, ‚ÄòPenny Lover‚Äô, ‚ÄòSay You, Say Me‚Äô and the ever-popular ‚ÄòDancing On The Ceiling‚Äô.\n\nWATCH: Lionel Richie - Dancing On The Ceiling\n\nDid Lionel Richie perform at USA For Africa?\n\nFollowing the success of Bob Geldof‚Äôs Band Aid campaign to raise money and awareness of the famine in Ethiopia, singer Harry Belafonte decided that an American version was called for. Emulating Geldof‚Äôs tactics, Belafonte called Lionel Richie, Michael Jackson and celebrated producer Quincy Jones to help him out.\n\nLionel Richie and Michael Jackson wrote the resulting song, ‚ÄòWe Are The World‚Äô, in just a couple of hours. Calling on their music biz pals, 45 singers including Richie, Jackson, Billy Joel, Cyndi Lauper, Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon and more congregated at the A & M Recording Studios in LA to record the song.\n\nIt topped the US charts in April 1985 and also went to Number 1 in the UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand among many other countries.\n\nDid Lionel Richie retire?\n\nLionel Richie entered a state of semi-retirement and, apart from three new tracks in 1992, didn‚Äôt release an album until 1996‚Äôs ‚ÄòLouder Than Words‚Äô, which has been followed by a steady stream of modestly successful albums.\n\nIs Lionel Richie married?\n\nLionel Richie has been married twice. He married his first wife, Brenda Harvey, in 1975 and they adopted two-year-old Nicole Camille Escovedo in 1983 who was raised as Nicole Richie. The couple divorced in 1993.\n\nLionel then married Diane Alexander in 1995. Their son, Miles Brockman was born in 1994, and their daughter, Sofia Richie, was born in 1998. However, their marriage ended in 2003.\n\nWhere is Lionel Richie now?\n\nLionel Ritchie is still performing, bringing shows to the UK and Europe in 2023! He is also currently a judge on American Idol, which wrapped its 22nd season in May 2024.\n\nIn May 2023, Lionel performed at the Coronation Concert to celebrate the Coronation of King Charles III. He was joined by Take That, Katy Perry and many more.\n\nWhen is he on tour?\n\nLionel performed shows in the UK and Europe throughout June and July 2023, after the singer was forced to cancel shows in 2022 due to COVID-19.\n\nLionel Richie's Las Vegas album\n\nIn August 2019, the singer released a new album recorded during his residency in Las Vegas. Lionel's album, 'Hello from Las Vegas', which featured many of his classic hits, including 'Running With The Night' and 'Say You, Say Me'.\n\nThe album was released just a few weeks after his former band The Commodores announced they were reuniting. On the 52nd anniversary of the formation of the group, William 'Wak' King, who was the co-founder says he'd been making new music.\n\nHe told Billboard: \"It's very exciting right now. Everybody's kinda pumped. It's taken a while to get everybody in the frame of mind to get back in the studio, but we've been cutting four tracks and we want to get them completed and figure out what to do with them.\"\n\nIs Lionel Richie in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?\n\nLionel Richie was announced as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 2022 inductees on 4th May 2022. He was inducted with the other shortlisted artists on 5th November at a ceremony held in Los Angeles.\n\nLionel Richie receives Gershwin Prize\n\nLionel Richie has been honoured with the Library of Congress' Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, which is an award given to a living musician for their lifetime achievement in promoting a song genre.\n\nFellow artists and friends of Lionel - Gloria Estefan, Boyz II Men, Chris Stapleton, and Luke Bryan - along with host Anthony Anderson paid tribute to the music legend at a concert. They performed some of his and Commodores biggest hits at DAR Constitution Hall on 9th March.\n\nPast recipients of the award include Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder, Billy Joel and Carole King.\n\nTake a look through some of Lionel Richie's biggest career moments:\n\nDon't forget to tune into Greatest Hits Radio to hear Lionel Richie's songs.\n\nNow Read:\n\nEverything you need to know about Eurythmics üé∂\n\nStevie Wonder's greatest songs of all time\n\nPaul Young: Where is the 80s heart‚Äìthrob and pop sensation now?\n\nHow to listen to Greatest Hits Radio:\n\nListen to Greatest Hits Radio on the free Rayo app, online or on your DAB digital radio.
