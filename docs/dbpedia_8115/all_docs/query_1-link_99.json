        "text": "One of singer Lionel Richie’s biggest hits was his 1981 duet with Diana Ross, Endless Love. Recently the artist has taken a cue from another vintage tune: Gloria Gaynor’s 1979 hit, I Will Survive. That disco-era anthem of reinvention says a lot about the career strategy of not just Richie but of the entire music industry, which for more than a decade has grappled with the toll digitization has taken on its once-platinum business model.\n\nA quarter century after Richie’s last No. 1 album, the 63-year-old singer-songwriter of such R&B staples as All Night Long (All Night) and Three Times a Lady again tops Billboard’s sales charts with Tuskegee, a collection of duets with country music’s Shania Twain, Tim McGraw, Blake Shelton, Kenny Chesney, and others. By reprising some of his biggest hits with country’s top stars, Richie is blurring the lines between genres and attracting a new audience that still spends on higher-margin CDs. He’s also providing a spark for the U.S. record industry, which registered its first annual sales growth in seven years in 2011 and is eager to get consumers to try—and buy—new music beyond their traditional faves. “These songs lend themselves to being done by country artists,” says Ken Robold, general manager of Universal Music Group Nashville, the Vivendi-owned label that produced the album. “Lionel could have been a country artist all along. He just happened to sign to Motown.”"
