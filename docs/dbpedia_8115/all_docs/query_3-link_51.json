        "text": "When he's not performing, Grammy-winning singer Lionel Richie is a supportive dad and grandfather.\n\nThe \"Endless Love\" singer, 74, is a father of three, including Nicole Richie.\n\nHe is also now a grandfather of three, after his youngest daughter, Sofia Richie Grainge and her husband Elliot Grainge, announced they had welcomed a daughter Eloise Samantha Grainge on May 20.\n\nLast September, Lionel Richie shared an Instagram video of his children cheering him on during a performance.\n\n\"Lionel!\" his youngest daughter Sofia Richie Grainge yells toward the stage in the brief clip. Sister Nicole Richie then chimes in with another exuberant \"Lionel!\" before the camera pans to show the superstar singer-songwriter waving at his daughters.\n\n\"Take your Kids to Work Day turned out well,\" the elder Richie wrote in the accompanying caption, along with a laughing emoji. Richie Grainge added three more laughing emojis in a reply to her dad's post.\n\nRead on for more about Lionel Richie and his three children.\n\nNicole Richie\n\nNicole Richie, 42, is Lionel Richie's eldest daughter and is the founder and creative director of the apparel and jewelry brand House of Harlow 1960.\n\nLionel Richie told People magazine in a 2022 interview that when he and his former wife Brenda Harvey adopted Nicole when she was 9, it \"was actually a godsend.\"\n\n\"She was a little girl who needed a shot,\" Lionel Richie said at the time. \"She was used to people coming and going. She looked at me and I'd say, 'I'm not going anywhere.'\"\n\nIn addition to being a father of three, Lionel Richie is also a grandfather to Nicole Richie's two children, daughter Harlow and son Sparrow.\n\nNicole Richie and her family, including her husband Joel Madden, her father Lionel Richie and his girlfriend Lisa Parigi and her mother Brenda Harvey Richie, all attended the red carpet premiere of the \"Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead\" remake in Los Angeles on April 2.\n\nMiles Richie\n\nAfter Richie and Harvey divorced in 1993, he went on to marry fashion designer Diane Alexander, with whom he shares son Miles Richie and daughter Sofia Richie Grainge. The elder Richie and Alexander divorced in 2004.\n\nMiles Richie, now 29, works as a model and signed with leading agency Wilhelmina Models in 2018. His runway debut came at Philipp Plein's Fall 2018 show in February 2018.\n\n\"It is interesting in this modeling field and the fashion field, you have to push yourself. My dad and my mom, they all just keep pushing me forward every single day and every day, I'm just determined to be better,\" Miles Richie told Essence in 2020.\n\nSofia Richie Grainge\n\nThe youngest Richie sibling, Sofia Richie Grainge, is also a model. The 25-year-old married music executive Elliot Grainge in 2023.\n\nRichie Grainge revealed in a Vogue interview published in January that she and her husband were expecting their first child. On May 24, Richie Grainge announced in an Instagram photo post they had welcomed a daughter named Eloise Samantha Grainge on May 20.\n\nLionel Richie told People in January that he's \"pumped up\" to be welcoming another grandchild into the Richie family.\n\n\"I am now going to spoil yet another child in the world,\" he said, before joking, \"I am not quite sure what the child will do to me, but I'm hoping that the child gives the parents a bit of a run, because every parent wants to get even as to what you did to me.\""
