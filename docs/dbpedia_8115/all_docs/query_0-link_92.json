        "text": "Lionel Richie thinks that his future granddaughter already has some personality. The 74-year-old musician spoke with ET's Denny Directo after Sunday's American Idol live show about awaiting the arrival of his daughter, Sofia Richie Grainge's baby girl.\n\nSofia recently posted a baby bump pic of herself, noting that she's now nine months pregnant. As for the little one not arriving in time for Mother's Day, Lionel joked with ET that the decision was intentional on the infant's part.\n\n\"Listen, the baby is a diva,\" he quipped. \"You can't come from Sofia and not have some form of defiance.\"\n\nLionel also joked that his youngest daughter is in for a rude awakening once her baby girl arrives.\n\n\"She is going to be in shock because it comes out this small, but it changes your life completely,\" Lionel joked. \"And I can't wait to sit there and laugh at her when she can't hand the baby back. Elliot and Sofia are going to have a reality [check].\"\n\nJokes aside, Lionel is excited to be a grandpa again, gushing, \"Of course, let me tell you something, we're all loving it. I'm over the moon and trying to stay calm. I'm just so excited. For them, I know this is going to be the adventure of a lifetime.\"\n\nSofia tied the knot with Elliot Grange in 2023 and announced her pregnancy in January 2024. Shortly after, proud dad Lionel spoke with ET about the news.\n\n\"My baby is having a baby,\" Lionel exclaimed, \"and I'm so thrilled for Elliot and Sofia. They are just over the moon.\"\n\nAt the time, Lionel also shared the name his grandchildren use for him.\n\n\"I'm Pop-pop,\" Lionel explained. \"We don't get the 'grandpa,' yeah, that's a little deep. Pop-pop is where we're going.\"\n\nAmerican Idol airs Sundays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC."
