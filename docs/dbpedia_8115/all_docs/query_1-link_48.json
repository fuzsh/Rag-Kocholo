The first single from the album, \"Truly\", topped the Billboard Hot 100. Follow-up single \"You Are\" reached number four, and \"My Love\" reached number five. The album was also a hit, reaching number one on the Cashbox albums chart on December 11, 1982.In 2003, Lionel Richie was re-released as part of a remaster series that saw two additional tracks added: a solo version of \"Endless Love\" and an instrumental version of \"You Are\". Eagles member Joe Walsh provided the guitar solo for the song \"Wandering Stranger\".

        "text": "Condition Guarantee\n\nAt Heavy Heads Records, we fully understand that when it comes to collecting vinyl records, condition is king! New vinyl records will arrive factory sealed, and in mint condition. Any used vinyl record that you order from us is guaranteed to be in VG+ condition or better, and will play all the way through without skipping! Every used vinyl record we bring in is cleaned, and thoroughly inspected, before it̢���s ever added to this site. Our used vinyl records are not specific to any pressing, and you may receive a vintage, or newer pressing of the title you order, depending on what we have in stock at the time of your order. The outer sleeve of your vinyl record is guaranteed to be in VG condition or better. If you̢���re unfamiliar with how vinyl records are graded, please take a moment to read through our condition guide.\n\nVG+ (Very Good Plus) - A Very Good Plus vinyl record will show some signs that it was played and otherwise handled by a previous owner who took good care of it. Defects should be more of a cosmetic nature, not affecting the actual playback as a whole. Vinyl record surfaces may show some signs of wear and may have slight scuffs or very light scratches that don't affect one's listening experiences. Slight warps that do not affect the sound are \"OK\". The label may have some ring wear or discoloration, but it should be barely noticeable. Spindle marks may be present.\n\nVG (Very Good) Outer Sleeve - May be marred by writing, or have tape or stickers (or their residue) attached. The same will be true of picture sleeves or LP covers. However, it will not have all of these problems at the same time. 99% of our outer sleeves are in VG+ condition, but occasionally will be VG, if that's all that is available at the time of the order.\n\nCD̢���s will arrive in VG+ condition or better, with clean cases, and all original artwork.\n\nCassette tapes will arrive with good pads, clean cases, original inserts, and legible writing on the cassette itself.\n\nAll of our media types are carefully packaged in thick, reinforced cardboard mailers, and each package is inspected for quality assurance, before they are mailed. Box sets are carefully wrapped in bubble wrap, with extra attention paid to the corners of the box."
