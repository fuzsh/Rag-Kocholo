        "text": "Colin Chapman’s previous attempts at producing a Formula 1 car had been a complete disappointment. Despite being technically advanced, extreme lightness led to numerous structural failures.\n\nIn 1960, Chapman decided to start with a clean sheet of paper, assessing the basic requirements for a contemporary Formula 1 car, and identifying how to achieve them in the most straightforward, uncomplicated way. The result was one of Chapman’s greatest creations – the Lotus 18 – a trendsetting, rear-engined car that was to set new performance standards from the outset.\n\nDriven by some of the top drivers of the era – including Innes Ireland, Jim Clark, and John Surtees – it was Stirling Moss who made the car’s name, winning four Grands Prix, including his sensational victories over Ferrari, against all odds, at Monaco and the Nürburgring in 1961.\n\nThis book describes the history of the Lotus 18 throughout its seven-year competition career, via season by season summaries, and provides detailed appendices charting the individual histories of all 28 chassis that were built. Full race results are also presented, along with driver achievements.\n\nThe book published by Veloce is available now, priced £50 or $85 written by Mark J P Whitlock.\n\nMark Whitelock’s enthusiasm for motor sport started in 1957, when his father took him to Goodwood. On Easter Monday 1960, he was at Goodwood again, cheering Innes Ireland and the Lotus 18 to victory over Stirling Moss, giving him a special affinity with both that car, and that driver.\n\nBy the early ’90s, disillusioned with contemporary Grand Prix racing, Mark turned his attention to historic racing and cars, and became an early supporter of the return of motor sport to the Goodwood circuit.\n\nMark retired from a career in banking in 1999, and took up writing for pleasure.\n\nPlace of birth: Dorking, Surrey • Hometown: Flimwell • Nearest city:"
