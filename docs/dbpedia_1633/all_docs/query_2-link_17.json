        "text": "British multinational manufacturer of sports cars and electric lifestyle vehicles.\n\nLotus Group (also known as Lotus Cars, and trading as Lotus NYO in China[3]) is a British multinational automotive manufacturer of luxury sports cars and electric vehicles.\n\nLotus Group is composed of three primary entities. Lotus Cars, a high-performance sports car company, is based in Hethel, Norfolk. Lotus Tech, an all-electric lifestyle vehicle company, headquartered in Wuhan, China, and operates regional facilities in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Germany.[4] Additionally, Lotus Engineering, an engineering consultancy firm, is headquartered at the Lotus Advanced Technology Centre (LATC) located at the University of Warwick's Wellesbourne Campus.[5]\n\nLotus was founded and owned for many years by Colin Chapman. After his death and a period of financial instability, it was bought by General Motors, then Romano Artioli and then DRB-HICOM through its subsidiary Proton, which owned Lotus from 1996 to 2017. Lotus is currently majority-owned by Chinese multinational Geely.[6]\n\nLotus was previously involved in Formula One racing, via Team Lotus, winning the Formula One World Championship seven times. Notable Lotus cars include the Lotus Seven, the Elan, the Esprit and the Elise.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly years\n\n[edit]\n\nThe company was formed in 1952 as Lotus Engineering Ltd. by Colin Chapman but had earlier origins in 1948 when Chapman built his first trials car in a garage.[7] The four letters in the middle of the logo represent Chapman's full name, Anthony Colin Bruce Chapman. When the logo was created, Chapman's original partners Michael and Nigel Allen were allegedly told that that the letters stood for Colin Chapman and the Allen Brothers.[citation needed][clarification needed]\n\nThe first factory was situated in old stables behind the Railway Hotel in Hornsey, North London. Team Lotus, which was split from Lotus Engineering in 1954, was active and competitive in Formula One racing from 1958 to 1994. The Lotus Group of Companies was formed in 1959. This was composed of Lotus Cars Limited and Lotus Components Limited, which focused on road cars and customer competition-car production, respectively. Lotus Components Limited became Lotus Racing Limited in 1971, but the newly renamed entity ceased operation that same year.[8]\n\nThe company moved to a purpose-built factory at Cheshunt in 1959,[9] and since 1966 it has occupied a modern factory and road test facility at Hethel, near Wymondham in Norfolk. The site is a former World War II airfield, RAF Hethel, and the test track uses sections of the old runway.\n\nIn its early days, Lotus sold cars aimed at private racers and trialists. Its early road cars could be bought as kits in order to save on purchase tax. The kit car era ended in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the Lotus Elan Plus Two as the first Lotus road car not offered in kit form, and the Lotus Eclat and Lotus Elite of the mid-1970s were offered only in factory-built versions.\n\nAfter the Lotus Elite of the 1950s, which featured a complete fibreglass monocoque fitted with built-in steel pickup points for mounting major components, Lotus found critical and sales success in the 1960s with the Lotus Elan. This two-seater was later developed to two-plus-two form (Elan +2S). Lotus was notable for its use of fibreglass bodies, backbone chassis and overhead camshaft engines, initially supplied by Coventry Climax but later replaced by Lotus-Ford units (Ford block, Lotus head and twin-cam valve gear). Lotus also worked with Ford on the Lotus Cortina, a successful sports saloon.\n\nAnother Lotus of the late 1960s and early 1970s was the two-seater Lotus Europa, initially intended only for the European market, which paired a backbone chassis and lightweight body with a mid-mounted Renault engine, later upgraded to the Lotus-Ford twin-cam unit as used in the Elan.\n\nThe Lotus Seven, originating in the 1950s as a simple, lightweight open two-seater. continued in production into the early 1970s. Lotus sold the rights to produce the Seven to Caterham, which has continued to produce the car since then.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Lotus sought to move upmarket with the launch of the Elite and Eclat models, four-seaters aimed at prosperous buyers, with features such as optional air conditioning and automatic transmissions. The mid-engine line continued with the Lotus Esprit, which became one of the company's longest-lived and most iconic models. Lotus developed its own series of four-cylinder DOHC engines, the Lotus 900 series, and later a V8, and turbocharged versions of the engines appeared in the Esprit.\n\nVariants of the 900-series engine were supplied for the Jensen Healey sports car and the Sunbeam Lotus \"hot hatchback\". In the 1980s, Lotus collaborated with Vauxhall Motors to produce the Lotus Carlton, the fastest roadgoing Vauxhall car.\n\nFinancial troubles, death of Chapman\n\n[edit]\n\nBy 1980, Group Lotus was in serious financial trouble. Production had dropped from 1,200 units per year to a mere 383. This situation resulted from the worldwide economic recession combined with the virtual collapse of sales in the American market and limited development of the model range.[10]\n\nIn early 1982, Chapman forged an agreement with Toyota to exchange intellectual property and applied expertise. As a result, Lotus Engineering helped develop the Mk2 Toyota Supra, also known as the Toyota Celica XX. The partnership also allowed Lotus to launch the new Lotus Excel to replace the ageing Lotus Eclat. Using drivetrain and other components build by Toyota enabled Lotus to sell the Excel for £1,109 less than the outgoing Eclat.[10]\n\nLooking to reenter the North American market, Chapman was approached by young law professor and investment banking consultant Joe Bianco, who proposed a new and separate American sales company for Lotus.[11] By creating an unprecedented tax-incentivised mechanism by which each investor received a personalised Lotus Turbo Esprit, the new American company, Lotus Performance Cars Inc. (LPCI), was able to provide fresh capital to Group Lotus in the United Kingdom. Former Ferrari North America general manager John Spiech was recruited to run LPCI, which imported the remarkable Giugiaro-designed Turbo Esprit for the first time. American sales began to quickly jump into six figures annually.[12]\n\nChapman died of a heart attack on 16 December 1982 at the age of 54. At the time, both Chapman and Lotus were linked to the DeLorean Motor Company scandal regarding the use of UK Government subsidies for the production of the DMC DeLorean, for which Lotus had designed the chassis. Chasing large sums of money that had disappeared from the DeLorean company, Lotus was besieged by Inland Revenue inspectors, who imposed an £84 million legal \"protective assessment\" on the company.[13] At the trial of Lotus accountant Fred Bushell, the judge insisted that had Chapman lived, he would have received a sentence \"of at least 10 years.\"[14]\n\nWith Group Lotus near bankruptcy in 1983, David Wickins, the founder of British Car Auctions, agreed to become the new company chairman through an introduction by his friend Mark Thatcher.[13] Taking a combined 29% BCA/personal stake in Group Lotus,[15] Wickins negotiated with Inland Revenue and recruited new investors: merchant bank Schroeder-Wagg (14%),[15] Michael Ashcroft's Bermudian operating company Benor (14%)[16] and Sir Anthony Bamford of JCB (12%).[15] Wickins oversaw a complete turnaround in the company's fortunes, for which he was dubbed \"the saviour of Lotus.\"[13][17]\n\nInternational ownership\n\n[edit]\n\nDespite having employed designer Peter Stevens to revamp the range and design two new concept cars,[18] by 1985 the British investors recognised that they lacked the capital to fund production and sought to find a buyer.[15] In January 1986, Wickins oversaw the majority sale of the Group Lotus companies and 100% of North American–based LPCI to General Motors.[15] After four months, Toyota sold GM its stake. By October 1986, GM had acquired a 91% stake in Group Lotus for £22.7 million, which allowed GM to legally force the company buyout.[15]\n\nOn 27 August 1993, GM sold the company for £30 million, to A.C.B.N. Holdings S.A. of Luxembourg, a company controlled by Italian businessman Romano Artioli, who also owned Bugatti Automobili SpA. In 1996, a majority share in Lotus was sold to Malaysian car company Proton.\n\nLotus Cars was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise for contribution to international trade, one of 85 companies receiving the recognition in that category in 2002. Lotus cars wore the badge of the award for several years.[19]\n\nOn 24 May 2017, Chinese multinational Geely announced that it was taking a 51% controlling stake in Lotus.[20][21] The remaining 49% was acquired by Etika Automotive, a holding company of Proton's major shareholder Syed Mokhtar Albukhary.[22]\n\nIn January 2021, Geely announced a joint venture with Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance and its Alpine division to develop a range of electric performance cars sharing some of their future platforms.[23] In April 2021, Lotus announced plans to produce only electric cars by 2028 and increase production numbers from around 1,500 per annum to tens of thousands. Geely and Etika Automotive provided two billion pounds (US$2.8 billion) to fund the changes.[24]\n\nLotus Technology, the electric-vehicle division of Lotus. which has a different ownership structure (30% by Etika and the rest by Geely and Nio Capital), was listed on Nasdaq through a SPAC acquisition. After the listing, 10.3% of shares will be held by the public.[25]\n\nOperations\n\n[edit]\n\nCurrently organised as Group Lotus Limited, the business is divided into Lotus Cars and Lotus Engineering.\n\nIn addition to manufacturing sportscars, the company also acts as an engineering consultancy, providing engineering development—particularly of suspensions—for other car manufacturers. Lotus's powertrain department is responsible for the design and development of the four-cylinder Ecotec engine found in many of GM's Vauxhall, Opel, Saab, Chevrolet and Saturn cars. The American Elise and Exige models used the 1.8L VVTL-i I4 from Toyota's late Celica GT-S and the Matrix XRS.\n\nMichael Kimberley, who had been a guiding figure at Lotus in the 1970s, returned as acting chief executive officer in May 2006. He chaired the executive committee of Lotus Group International Limited (LGIL), established in February 2006 with Syed Zainal Abidin (managing director of Proton Holdings Berhad) and Badrul Feisal (non-executive director of Proton Holdings Berhad). LGIL is the holding company of Lotus Group Plc.\n\nKimberley retired as CEO on 17 July 2009,[26] replaced on 1 October 2009 by former Ferrari executive Dany Bahar. Bahar intended to drive the brand into the expanding global luxury-goods sector and away from the company's traditional lightweight simplicity and pure driving-experience focus. Bahar was suspended on 25 May 2012 while an investigation into his conduct was undertaken.[27] On 7 June 2012, Lotus announced the termination of Bahar and the appointment of Aslam Farikullah as the new chief operating officer.[28] The ambitious plans for several new models were cancelled following Bahar's departure. Jean Marc Gales became CEO in 2014, and in 2017, he enabled the company to achieve its first profit in decades. Gales left the company in June 2018 for personal reasons and was replaced by Feng Qingfeng from Lotus Group's parent company, Geely.\n\nOctober 2018 saw further senior personnel changes as Phil Popham was named CEO of Lotus Cars, with Qingfeng remaining in charge of Group Lotus.[29]\n\nIn January 2021, Matt Windle was appointed managing director of Lotus Cars after Phil Popham resigned.[30][31]\n\nFormula One and motorsport\n\n[edit]\n\nIn its early days, the company encouraged its customers to race its cars, and it first entered Formula One through its sister company Team Lotus in 1958. A Lotus Formula One car driven by Stirling Moss won the marque's first Grand Prix in 1960 at Monaco. Moss drove a Lotus 18 entered by privateer Rob Walker. Major success came in 1963 with the Lotus 25, which, with Jim Clark driving, won Team Lotus its first F1 World Constructors' Championship. Clark was killed in April 1968 when the rear tyre of his Formula Two Lotus 48 failed while making a turn at a race in Hockenheim. His death was a severe blow to the team and to Formula One, as he had been the dominant driver of Lotus's early years. That year's championship was won by Clark's teammate Graham Hill.\n\nTeam Lotus is credited with making the mid-engine layout popular for IndyCars, developing the first monocoque Formula One chassis and integrating the engine and transaxle as chassis components. Team Lotus was among the pioneers in Formula One in adding wings and shaping the undersurface of the car to create downforce. It invented active suspension and was the first to move radiators to the sides of the car to improve aerodynamic performance.\n\nFormula One Drivers' Championship winners for Lotus were Jim Clark in 1963 and 1965, Graham Hill in 1968, Jochen Rindt in 1970, Emerson Fittipaldi in 1972 and Mario Andretti in 1978. In 1973, Lotus won the constructors' championship only; the drivers' title went to Jackie Stewart of Tyrrell. Chapman saw Lotus beat Ferrari as the first marque to achieve 50 Grand Prix victories, even though Ferrari had won its first nine years sooner.\n\nUntil the late 1980s, Team Lotus continued to be a major player in Formula One. Ayrton Senna drove for the team from 1985 to 1987, winning twice in each year and achieving 17 pole positions.\n\nTeam Lotus established Classic Team Lotus in 1992, which continues to maintain Lotus F1 cars and run them in the FIA Historic Formula One Championship. It also preserves the Team Lotus archive and Works Collection of cars, under the management of Colin Chapman's son Clive.\n\nTeam Lotus's participation in Formula One ended after the 1994 season, when the team's cars were no longer competitive. Cars constructed by the team won a total of 79 Grand Prix races.\n\nFormer racing driver David Hunt (brother of F1 world champion James Hunt) purchased the name Team Lotus and licensed it to the Formula One team Pacific Racing, which was rebranded Pacific Team Lotus.[32] The Pacific Team folded at the end of the 1995 season.\n\nThe Lotus name returned to Formula One for the 2010 season, when a new Malaysian team called Lotus Racing was awarded an entry. The new team used the Lotus name under licence from Group Lotus and was unrelated to the original Team Lotus. In September 2010 Group Lotus, with agreement from its parent company Proton, terminated the licence for future seasons as a result of what it called \"flagrant and persistent breaches of the licence by the team.\" Lotus Racing then announced that it had acquired Team Lotus Ventures Ltd, the company led by David Hunt, and with it full ownership of the rights to the Team Lotus brand and heritage. The team confirmed that it would be known as Team Lotus from 2011 onward.\n\nIn December 2010, Group Lotus announced the creation of Lotus Renault GP, the successor to the Renault F1 team. This team contested the 2011 season having purchased a title sponsorship deal with the team, with the option to buy shares in the future. The team's car for that season, the R31, was badged as a Renault, while Team Lotus's car, the T128, was badged as a Lotus. In May 2011, the British High Court of Justice ruled that Team Lotus could continue to use the Team Lotus name, but Group Lotus had sole right to use the Lotus name. As a consequence, for 2012 Lotus Renault GP was rebranded as Lotus F1 Team and its entries were badged as Lotus cars, while Team Lotus was renamed Caterham F1 Team (after the sportscar manufacturer owned by team principal Tony Fernandes) and its cars were badged as Caterhams.\n\nGroup Lotus was also involved in several other categories of motorsport. It sponsored the KV team in the IndyCar Series and the ART team in the GP2 and GP3 Series in 2011 and 2012. After fielding underpowered and uncompetitive engines in the 2012 Indianapolis 500, in which drivers Jean Alesi and Simona de Silvestro were black-flagged after ten laps for failing to maintain a competitive pace, Lotus was released from its contract and did not participate in future seasons.\n\nLotus car models\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: List of Lotus vehicles\n\nCurrent\n\n[edit]\n\nCurrent Lotus models include:\n\nLotus Evija: The Lotus Evija is a limited production electric sports car; it is the first electric vehicle to be introduced and manufactured by the company. Codenamed \"Type 130\", production of the Evija will be limited to 130 units. Production is set to begin early-mid 2021 with delivery in early 2023. The Evija is powered by a 70 kWh battery pack developed in conjunction with Williams Advanced Engineering, with electric motors supplied by Integral Powertrain. The four individual motors are placed at the wheels and each is rated at 375 kW (510 PS; 503 hp), for a combined total output of 1,500 kW (2,039 PS; 2,011 hp) and 1,704 N⋅m (1,257 lb⋅ft) of torque. Lotus claims that the Evija will be able to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in under 3 seconds, from 0 to 300 km/h (186 mph) in 9.1 seconds, and achieve a limited top speed of 350 km/h (217 mph).[33]\n\nLotus Emira: This model was unveiled in July 2021, and production began in March 2022. The Emira will be Lotus’ final vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine.[24]\n\nLotus Eletre: The first electric SUV by Lotus, the Eletre is powered by a 112 kWh battery pack and an 800V high voltage system, achieving a maximum range of 600 km and 400 km of range after 20 minutes of charging. The 2024 model offers 603 horsepower for the base and S models, and 905 horsepower the R model and a top speed of 260 km/h. It is the first Lotus to offer features such as lidar.[34][35] Delivery began on 29 March 2023 and was expected to launch in Europe in the summer or fall of 2023 and in the United States in 2024.[36][37][38]\n\nLotus Emeya\n\nPrevious\n\n[edit]\n\nLotus Mark I (1948): Austin 7–based sports car\n\nLotus Mark II (1949–1950): Ford-powered trials car\n\nLotus Mark III (1951): 750 cc formula car\n\nLotus Mark IV (1952): Trials car\n\nLotus Mark V (1952): 750 cc formula car, never built\n\nLotus Mark VI (1953–1955): The first \"production\" racer, about 100 built\n\nLotus Seven (1957–1972): A minimalist open sports car designed to manoeuvre a racing circuit.[39]\n\nLotus Mark VIII (1954): sports racer, MG 1.5 L\n\nLotus Mark IX (1955): sports racer, shorter and improved Eight\n\nLotus Mark X (1955): sports racer for larger displacement, Bristol/BMW 2 L\n\nLotus Eleven (1956–1957): small displacement sports racer (750 – 1500 cc)\n\nLotus 12 (1956–1957): Formula Two and Formula One racecar\n\nLotus 13: Designation not used\n\nLotus 14 (1957–1963): Lotus Elite, the first production street car\n\nLotus 15 (1958–1960): Sports racer, update of the Mk.X, Climax 1.5 – 2.5 L\n\nLotus 16 (1958–1959): F1/F2 car, \"Miniature Vanwall\"\n\nLotus 17 (1959): Lighter sports racer update of the 11 in response to Lola Mk.I\n\nLotus 18 (1960–1961): First mid-engined Lotus single seater—Formula Junior/F2/F1\n\nLotus 19 (1960–1962): Mid-engined larger displacement sports racer, \"Monte Carlo\"\n\nLotus 20 (1961): Formula Junior\n\nLotus 21 (1961): Formula One\n\nLotus 22 (1962–1965): Formula Junior/F3\n\nLotus 23 (1962–1966): Small displacement mid-engined sports racer\n\nLotus 24 (1962): Formula One\n\nLotus 25 (1962–1964): Formula One World Champion\n\nLotus 26 (1962–1971): Lotus Elan, production street sports car\n\nLotus 26R (1962–1966): Racing version of Elan\n\nLotus 27 (1963): Formula Junior\n\nLotus 28 (1963–1966): Lotus version of the Ford Cortina street/racer\n\nLotus 29 (1963): Indy car, Ford all-aluminium OHV small block V8\n\nLotus 30 (1964): Large displacement sports racer (Ford small block V8)\n\nLotus 31 (1964–1966): Formula Three space frame racer\n\nLotus 32 (1964–1965): Monocoque F2 and Tasman Cup racer\n\nLotus 33 (1964–1965): Formula One World Champion\n\nLotus 34 (1964): Indy car, DOHC Ford V8\n\nLotus 35 (1965): F2/F3/FB\n\nLotus 36 (1965–1968): Elan Fixed Head Coupe (Type 26 could be fitted with a removable hard top)\n\nLotus 38 (1965): Indy winning mid-engined car\n\nLotus 39 (1965–1966): Tasman Cup formula car\n\nLotus 40 (1965): Sports racer, a development of the 30\n\nLotus 41 (1965–1968): Formula Three, Formula Two, Formula B\n\nLotus 42 (1967): Indy car, Ford V8\n\nLotus 43 (1966): Formula One\n\nLotus 44 (1967): Formula Two\n\nLotus 45 (1966–1974): Convertible (Drop Head Coupe) Elan with permanent side window frames.\n\nLotus 46 (1966–1968): Original Renault-engined Europa\n\nLotus 47 (1966–1970): Racing version of Europa\n\nLotus 48 (1967): Formula Two\n\nLotus 49 (1967–1969): Formula One World Champion\n\nLotus 50 (1967–1974): Lotus Elan +2, four-seat production car\n\nLotus 51 (1967–1969): Formula Ford\n\nLotus 52 (1968): Prototype Europa Twin Cam\n\nLotus 53 (1968): Small displacement sports racer, never built\n\nLotus 54 (1968–1970): Series 2 'Europa' production car.\n\nLotus 55 (1968): F3\n\nLotus 56 (1968–1969): Indy turbine wedge\n\nLotus 56B (1971): F1 turbine wedge\n\nLotus 57 (1968): F2 design study\n\nLotus 58 (1968): F1 design study\n\nLotus 59 (1969–1970): F2/F3/Formula Ford\n\nLotus LX (1960): Lotus Elite built to win at Le Mans with a 2.0 L FPF engine.\n\nLotus 60 (1970–1973): Lotus Seven S4, Greatly modified version of the Seven\n\nLotus 61 (1969): Formula Ford, \"the wedge\"\n\nLotus 62 (1969): prototype Europa racer\n\nLotus 63 (1969): 4-wheel drive F1\n\nLotus 64 (1969): 4-wheel drive Indy car, did not compete\n\nLotus 65 (1969–1971): Federalized Europa S2\n\nLotus 66 (2024): track day car based on a 1969 Can-Am study\n\nLotus 67 (1970): Proposed Tasman Cup car, never built\n\nLotus 68 (1969): F5000 prototype\n\nLotus 69 (1970): F2/F3/Formula Ford\n\nLotus 70 (1970): F5000/Formula A\n\nLotus 71: Undisclosed design study\n\nLotus 72 (1970–1972): Formula One World Champion\n\nLotus 73 (1972–1973): F3\n\nLotus 74 -

In July 2021, Lotus revealed that this new model is called Emira.\n\nIn November 2021, Lotus teased the future introduction of the future Type 132 SUV, later named as Eletre.[51]\n\nIn September 2023, Lotus announced the Emeya, the company's first electric GT car.[52]\n\nLotus engines\n\n[edit]\n\nLotus-Ford Twin Cam\n\nLotus 900 series\n\nLotus 907\n\nLotus 910\n\nLotus 911\n\nLotus 912\n\nLotus 920\n\nLotus 918\n\nRange Extender Engine. This all-aluminium, monoblock, 1200 cc, three-cylinder, 47 horsepower, four-stroke engine is specifically designed to directly drive an alternator for electricity generation for series-hybrid cars. The engine is small and light at 56 kg (123 lb), having three cylinders and no detachable cylinder head. The cylinder head and engine block are all one casting to reduce size, weight and production costs. As the engine does not turn belt driven ancillaries such as alternator, power-steering pump or an air conditioning compressor, the block requires no strong points to accommodate such ancillaries, resulting in a simple and light block. The engine has a reduced parts count for lightness and cheaper production.[53][54]\n\nOn 18 August 2011 Lotus developed an all new in-house designed V8 destined for the new era range of cars. At 170 kg (375 lb) and just 612 mm (24.1 in) long, the unit is dry sump lubricated to save depth and will feature a 180° flat plane crank. The engine is being utilised as a stressed component, a technique pioneered by Colin Chapman in F1, specifically with the 1967 Type 49. It was expected to be used in the Le Mans LMP2 car in 2012. Expected performance is likely to be in excess of 590 PS (434 kW; 582 hp) and with a 9,200 rpm redline.[55]\n\nLotus Omnivore, research engine and prototype.\n\nLotus Engineering\n\n[edit]\n\nLotus Engineering Limited is an offshoot of Lotus Cars, which provides engineering consultancy to third-party companies primarily in the automotive industry. As well as Hethel in the United Kingdom Lotus has engineering centres in Ann Arbor, USA, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and Shanghai, China. In 2000, Lotus Engineering, Inc. was established with an office in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[56]\n\nEngineering demonstrators\n\n[edit]\n\nLotus Eco Elise is an engineering demonstrator of its classic sports car that incorporates solar panels into a roof made from hemp, while also employing natural materials in the body and interior of the car.\n\nLotus Exige 265E Bio-fuel\n\nLotus Exige 270E Tri-fuel\n\nLotus Evora 414E Hybrid.

The engine was designed and developed to be available in a 2.2-litre naturally aspirated and 3.0-litre supercharged variations. An electric version was also shown in the 2007 NADA show.\n\nVersatile Vehicle Architecture (VVA) is an effort by the Lotus car manufacturing company to reduce the investment needed for producing unique, niche-market cars by sharing a number of common components.\n\nCars produced using VVA:\n\nLotus APX\n\nProjects undertaken by Lotus Engineering\n\n[edit]\n\nExamples of work undertaken by Lotus Engineering include:\n\nLotus Talbot Sunbeam—Talbot's hot hatch rally car of the early 1980s\n\nDMC DeLorean.
