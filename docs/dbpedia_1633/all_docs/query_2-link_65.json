Our last feature is on the Lotus Flower Tiara–\n\nThe Princess of Wales’ Tiaras | The Jewels of the Princess of Wales\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nIn 1923, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon received a pearl and diamond necklace from the Duke of York upon their marriage, which she soon transformed into this delicate piece, featuring lotus flowers topped with diamond arches and pearls. The Tiara was most notably worn by the Duchess for a series of portraits in the 1920s, which were widely circulated around the time of her husband’a 1936 accession to the Throne.\n\nThe following year, the then Queen Elizabeth loaned the Lotus Flower Tiara to her elder sister, Lady Elphinstone, for the Coronation of King George VI at Westminster Abbey. Lady Elphinstone was the mother of the Queen’s famous niece, the Hon. Margaret Rhodes.\n\nEmbed from Getty ImagesEmbed from Getty ImagesEmbed from Getty Images\n\nIn 1959, the then Queen Mother gave the Lotus Flower Tiara to her younger daughter, Princess Margaret, ahead of her wedding the following year. Though not as famous as her Poltimore Tiara, she wore this piece quite regularly for the rest of her life.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nIn 1993, Princess Margaret loaned the Lotus Flower Tiara to the Hon. Serena Stanhope when she married her only son, then Viscount Linley, at St Margaret’s, Westminster.\n\nThe Lotus Flower Tiara was also ‘worn’ by Reginald Wilcock, the Queen Mother’s Page who served in her Household for 40 years, on the wedding day of Viscount Linley.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nAfter Princess Margaret’s death, the Lotus Flower Tiara came into the Queen’s collection, who loaned the piece to the Duchess of Cambridge for the Diplomatic Reception in 2013 and the Chinese State Banquet in 2015. Since then, the Duchess has solely worn Queen Mary’s Lover’s Knot Tiara, and thus the Lotus Flower Tiara would be the perfect starter piece for Meghan Markle.\n\nThe now Princess of Wales wore the Lotus Flower Tiara for the Diplomatic Reception at Buckingham Palace in 2022.\n\nThe Duchess of Edinburgh wore the Lotus Flower Tiara at the State Banquet in honour of Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako of Japan at Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe Princess of Wales’ Tiaras | The Jewels of the Princess of Wales\n\nWhich heirloom tiara would you like to see Meghan Markle wear tomorrow?\n\nShare this:"
