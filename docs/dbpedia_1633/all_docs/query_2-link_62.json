        "text": "Description:\n\nLotus Type 20 Formula Junior - a lightweight becomes a race winner\n\nWith its sleek lines, the Lotus 20 was slimmer and more aerodynamic than its angular predecessor, the Lotus 18. The lightweight spaceframe chassis and the fiberglass body built by Williams & Pritchard kept the weight to a minimum. The front section in particular could be kept narrow, as the fuel tank was fitted behind the driver's seat. The front tires were narrower than on the Lotus 18 and the driver sat in a semi-reclined position, which was already the later (and still today) common almost reclining position of the driver. The exceptionally effective chassis, the gearbox modified by Hewland and the Cosworth four-cylinder engine proved to be an unbeatable combination wherever the Lotus 20 was used.\n\nFrom the introduction of Formula Junior as an international formula in 1959 until its demise in 1964, Lotus was the dominant force, winning the British Championship every year from 1960 to 1963. The Lotus 20, first shown at the 1961 London Racing Car Show, proved to be an instant winner and was by far the most successful car of the season. The Lotus 20 was so successful that it was even driven by some private teams in Formula 1. Today, the car is used in the FIA Lurani Trophy, among others.\n\nThe Lotus 20 was another example of the genius of Colin Chapman, who made his mark on racing car design like no other. In Formula 1, monocoque, wing cars and double chassis were his greatest inventions.\n\nLotus 20\n\nFormula Junior\n\nYear of construction 1961\n\nChassis 20J888\n\nFIA Class FJ/D2\n\nCosworth dry sumped engine, 1,098.59 cc, 2 Weber 40 DCOE\n\nRenault gearbox with all new and custom made Hewland gears and CWP\n\nBrake Girling drum brake, 230 mm front / 197 mm rear\n\nWheels 4.5\" x 13\" front & 5\" x 13\" rear\n\nFIA homologation weight 400 kg\n\nCurrent weight: 400kg including additional weights\n\nComplete restored and professional maintained from MEC Auto, Belgium.\n\nEngine with just five hours runtime after Richardson rebuilt\n\nKnown history (Belge team car, driven by Henry Grandsire, with period race wins and Monaco participation)\n\nRegular Starter in the FIA Lurani Trophy.\n\nMonaco Historique GP elegliable\n\nLast race in 2019, Oldtimer Grand Prix Nuerburgring\n\nSince then the Lotus has been stored in a dry and heated hall.\n\n2-3 times a year short trips until the operating temperature is reached\n\nGenuine very nice and raceready car\n\nReady to race in Lurani Trophy and diverse Formula Junior and oldtimer events\n\nFIA HTP (FIA no. 41260, valid to 31.12.2026)\n\nAsking price; 47.000 GBP\n\nContact: Biehl Racing, Marcel Biehl +49 (0) 2166 99 777 04 / Marcel@Biehl-racing.de\n\nKeyword Search Terms:\n\nFormula Junior"
