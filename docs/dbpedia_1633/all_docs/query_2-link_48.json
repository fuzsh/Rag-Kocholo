        "text": "Just sliding into the driver’s seat and placing his hands on the steering wheel of his 1955 Lotus 18 race car is a thrill for Dr. Joseph DeLucia — a visceral connection similarly shared by fellow members of the Vintage Sports Car Club of America.\n\nFounded in 1958, the VSCCA is comprised of sports car enthusiasts — both men and women — dedicated to the “acquisition, preservation, restoration and operation of vintage sports cars” &mldr; and promoting the ideals of camaraderie and sportsmanship on the road and the racetrack.\n\n“It’s exhilarating to be in an open-air car like the Lotus 18. You literally become excited and feel so alive,” says DeLucia, a doctor of veterinary medicine and a resident of Clifton. “But we really have a tendency to respect each other on the track &mldr; it’s not about trophies and prizes. We are indifferent to wins. The cars are the stars.”\n\n&mldr; And stars they are. At all of the events staged by the VSCCA from early May through late September, the most renowned names and marques in sports car and road racing lore are tuned and turned loose on sanctioned tracks and hill climbs throughout the Northeast. Spectators can expect to see exquisite pre- and post-war Alpha Romeo, Ferrari, Jaguar, Lotus, MG, Porsche and other classic-built performance cars attacking the straightaway and taking the turns at Lime Rock Park in Connecticut or climbing nearly 3,200 feet in elevation through the turns and hairpins of Mount Equinox in Vermont.\n\n“I’ve never missed a year,” says DeLucia about taking on Mount Equinox. “The turns, the twists, the gearing &mldr; it’s like a roller coaster. If you do it under five minutes, that’s a great time.” His car of choice — a rare 1935 British-built, right-hand-drive Riley Imp. “They only built 55 of them,” he says. “This one survived World War II when it supposedly was strafed by a German Messerschmitt.”\n\nFrom England and then France, the Riley Imp found its way into a U.S. collection in Maryland from which DeLucia purchased the roadster at auction three years ago. “I won’t say how much I paid, but it was expensive,” he says.\n\nCost is one of the common denominators about owning and operating a vintage sports car, in addition to the initial purchase price.\n\n“It’s an expensive hobby,” says DeLucia. “I have an annual (self-imposed) budget of $40,000 just to run the cars, including travel and trailering them to events &mldr; some as far as a thousand miles away. But it doesn’t cover maintenance and repairs — that’s separate. Some owners have budgets of $200,000 or more.”\n\nMost of the 750 members of the Vintage Sports Car Club of America live on the East Coast, from Florida to Maine, where the club is centralized. Ages range from 25 to 85 and women represent about 3 percent of the membership. Approximately 75 members live in northern New Jersey and a few reside on the West Coast and in the Midwest.\n\nOne West Coast transplant is Mitch McCullough, formerly of Los Angeles and now living in Pompton Plains.\n\nNot unlike many of his fellow club members, McCullough, too, has a passion for vintage sports cars — owning and preserving them, knowing their history, and driving them as they were built to be driven. He shares his enthusiasm for all things automotive with his wife Kim, and it is ever-present in their everyday lives — both personally and professionally. Mitch is an automotive editor and writer, who has contributed to national publications and digital sites for more than 20 years, and Kim is the vice president of Marketing for Jaguar Land Rover North America. Together, they enjoy a collection of unique classic cars, several of them vintage sports and race cars.\n\n“Different cars are like keys that open different doors,” says Mitch, “like different kinds of events — Concours cars, rallye cars &mldr; certain period cars to participate in certain classes of cars. It’s a fascinating hobby. We think of ourselves as enthusiasts, not collectors.”\n\nThe McCulloughs participate in multiple VSCCA events throughout the year. “She drives, as well,” says Mitch about Kim. “Put a bunch of guys and girls in old race cars and put helmets on their heads, wave a green flag &mldr; and they’re racing!”\n\nSeveral of the McCulloughs’ vintage sports and race cars have been recognized for their rarity, historical correctness and preservation. In 2017, at the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance in Monterey, California, their 1954 Jaguar XK 120 roadster was awarded Second Place in the Post War Preservation Class. In March, the McCulloughs’ 1964 Alpine M64, an early Le Mans prototype race car, was awarded First Place in its class — Race Cars from 1962 to ’66 — at the Amelia Island Concours d’Elegance in Florida.\n\nBoth of the McCullough cars were detailed and meticulously prepared for the Concours events by Graham Long, owner of Graham Engineering & Motorsport, which specializes in restoration, preservation and fabrication of vintage European sports and race cars. On a routine basis, Long’s Clifton, NJ shop is filled with a diverse collection of rare and exotic cars, many of them owned by members of the Vintage Sports Car Club of America, which he is a member of, as well.\n\n“I love the early stuff &mldr; the mechanical pure essence of them,” says Long about the cars his shop works on, many of which are shipped in from out of state. “They are bare-bones cars &mldr; no computers, minimal electronics &mldr; hand-made, one-off stuff. We like that.”\n\nOftentimes, the preservation projects Long undertakes require one to two years to complete. “There are a lot of different challenges with these rare cars,” he says. “Sometimes we have to search globally for parts and if we can’t find them, we have to make them.”\n\nWhen not preserving or restoring clients’ cars, Long rebuilds his own — Formula One Grand Prix race cars. “They are phenomenal on the track &mldr; the best,” says the NJIT mechanical engineering graduate. “All these cars are so special. Our customers not only love them, they love their history and the history of the marques. We really do enjoy working on them.”\n\nVSCCA Membership\n\nThe following are among the necessary requirements for membership in the Vintage Sports Car Club of America:\n\n1.) Ownership of a pre- or post-war sports or race car up to model year 1959\n\n2.) Select cars up to 1965 will be considered. The selection is determined by the VSCCA Board of Directors, based on performance criteria.\n\n3.) Two letters of recommendation from two VSCCA members\n\n4.) Completion of a VSCCA-approved driving school\n\n5.) Participation in a Qualifying Race and receiving steward approval on performance\n\n6.) Passing an annual medical exam\n\nFor more information, visit the VSCCA website at www.vscca.org."
