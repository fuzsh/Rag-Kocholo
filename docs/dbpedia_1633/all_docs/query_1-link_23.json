        "text": "Only one copy remaining\n\nThe story of the Lotus 18 in which Stirling Moss achieved two of his most famous Grand Prix victories.\n\nTenth Book in the Great Cars Series\n\nThe first World Championship race of the 1½-litre Formula 1 era introduced for 1961 was the Monaco Grand Prix and Ferrari’s powerful new ‘shark-nose’ cars were expected to dominate it, but Moss used all his craft and guile to take a celebrated win in his Lotus 18. Although Ferrari did prove to be the dominant force that season, Moss scored a second success in this same car, chassis number 912, at the Nürburgring, a race that turned out to be the last World Championship Formula 1 victory of his career. The car’s entire 1961 season, and its subsequent life, is covered in fascinating detail in this ‘Great Cars’ book, supported by a fine collection of period photographs.\n\nAn in-depth account of the dramatic 1961 Monaco Grand Prix includes Stirling Moss’s recollections of his win in his Rob Walker-entered Lotus 18, which famously raced with its side panels removed.\n\n• The car’s seven other World Championship Formula 1 races of the 1961 season covered in full, with special focus on Moss’s victory in the German Grand Prix.\n\n• A third race success came in 1961 when Moss won the non-championship Modena Grand Prix.\n\n• Insights into Rob Walker Racing, the most successful ‘privateer’ team in Formula 1 history, including the recollections of mechanic Tony Cleverly.\n\n• For the 1962 season, the car passed to Count Volpi’s Scuderia SSS Repubblica di Venezia team and took part in five non-championship races, achieving a best result of sixth place for Nino Vaccarella in the Pau Grand Prix.\n\n• Later life, including a spell in Tom Wheatcroft’s Donington Collection.\n\n• Nearly 300 period images, many previously unpublished, supported by a portfolio of studio photography.\n\nClassic Edition signed by author Ian Wagstaff.\n\nISBN 978-1-907085-03-1"
