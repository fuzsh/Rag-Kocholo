        "text": "Like all Lotus cars throughout the brand’s storied 71-year history, the Evija has been precision-engineered to deliver an outstanding driving experience both on the road and track. It is the most dynamically accomplished model ever built by the company, setting new standards for Lotus driving performance. Above all else, it is ‘For The Drivers’.\n\nAs a name, Evija (pronounced ‘E-vi-ya’) means ‘the first in existence’ or ‘the living one’. It is highly appropriate; Lotus has an unquestionable reputation for its pioneering approach in both automotive and motorsport.\n\nThe Evija marks the start of an exciting new chapter in the history of an iconic and much-loved British sports car brand. It is the first hypercar from Lotus, and the company’s first model with an electrified powertrain. As the first completely new car to be launched under the stewardship of Geely – the world’s fastest growing automotive group – its significance cannot be overstated.\n\nExclusivity and desirability go hand in hand in the world of hypercars, and the Evija is blessed with an abundance of both. Production is limited to not more than 130 examples, making it among the most exclusive cars ever launched. It’s a figure set in tribute to the car’s project code, Type 130. Lotus road and race cars throughout the brand’s seven decades of success have been assigned a Type number, and the Evija is no exception.\n\nHethel, close to the historic city of Norwich in the east of England, UK, has been the home of Lotus since 1966, and the company has confirmed production of the Evija will begin there.\n\nAs well as tempting the world’s hypercar buyers, the car acts as a halo for the rest of the Lotus range – the petrol-powered Emira sports car and the all-electric Eletre hyper-SUV.\n\nA stunning piece of contemporary automotive design, the Evija features a dramatic Venturi tunnel through each rear quarter, giving it a truly breath-taking presence.\n\nThe Evija signals the start of a contemporary new design language for Lotus, which will evolve and reappear on future high-performance cars.\n\nIllustrative of the innovative thinking and ingenuity which has always been part of the Lotus DNA, the Evija is a technical tour de force. It continues the legendary Lotus bloodline that’s rich in firsts and technical game-changers, both in the automotive and motorsport sectors. While it is a glimpse of the future from Lotus, it remains true to the company’s DNA and the guiding principles of founder Colin Chapman, who built the first Lotus in 1948.\n\nThe Evija is the first Lotus road car to feature a one-piece carbon fibre monocoque chassis. The cabin, from the fully adjustable race-style seats to the multi-function steering wheel, is the very pinnacle of motorsport-inspired road car design and technology.\n\nAt the heart of the Evija is an ultra-advanced all-electric powertrain. It has been developed by technical partner Williams Advanced Engineering, famed for success in motorsport, from Formula One to electrifying the first four seasons of Formula E. The battery pack is mid-mounted immediately behind the two seats and supplies energy directly to four powerful e-motors. This highly efficient system is the lightest, most energy dense, electric power package ever fitted to a road car. With a target weight of just 1,680 kg, it will be the lightest pure electric hypercar ever to go into series production.\n\nEngineered for precise and sustained performance, the Evija has five driving modes – Range, City, Tour, Sport and Track. It can race from 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) in under three seconds and accelerate to a top speed of more than 200 mph (0-320 km/h).\n\nOrder books are now open through www.lotuscars.com.\n\nTrue to Lotus founder Colin Chapman’s core belief that every component should serve multiple purposes, the exterior design is also exceptionally efficient on every level. The most obvious example of this – and unquestionably the most dramatic element of the exterior – is the Venturi tunnel which pierces each rear quarter. Inspired by Le Mans race cars, they optimise air flow by directing it through the bodyshell.\n\nAside from creating a breath-taking presence, this design concept – known as ‘porosity’ – aids the delivery of high-energy air flow to the rear of the car. This in turn counteracts the low pressure behind the car to reduce drag. Furthermore, the Venturi effect inside the tunnels pulls air through the rear wheel arch louvres, maintaining air quality in the diffuser.\n\nWhen viewed from the rear of the car, each tunnel is edged with a red LED to create a striking ribbon-style light signature. The result is a stunning visual effect that’s akin to the afterburners on a fighter jet, especially when seen at night. As an extra detail, an LED hidden within each tunnel illuminates its interior.\n\nThe directional indicators are incorporated into the corners of the ribbon, while the reversing light is provided by the illuminated ‘T’ of the ‘LOTUS’ wordmark above the integrated charging flap.\n\nAnother key feature of the Evija’s sophisticated aerodynamic system is the bi-plane front splitter. It’s another illustration of form and function working perfectly in tandem. Designed in three sections, the larger central area provides air to cool the battery pack – mid-mounted behind the two seats – while the air channelled through the two smaller outer sections cools the front e-axle. Lotus aficionados may notice a respectful nod to the iconic Type 72 Formula 1 car, with its square front central section and two side wings.\n\nPower is fed from the battery pack to four independently controlled high-power density e-motors. These feature integrated silicon carbide inverters and an epicyclic transmission on each axle of the four-wheel drive powertrain. The motors and inverters are supplied by Integral Powertrain Ltd.\n\nFour exceptionally compact, extremely light and highly efficient single-speed, helical gear ground planetary gearboxes transfer power to each driveshaft. Measuring a mere 100mm in depth, each gearbox comes packaged with the e-motor and inverter as a single cylindrical Electrical Drive Unit (EDU). With a target power of 500 PS per e-motor, this is the most efficient and elegant engineering solution to deploying so much power with precision.\n\nTorque-vectoring, enabled by the four e-motors, provides exceptional dynamic response and agility on the road. This fully automatic, self-adjusting system can instantly distribute power to any combination of two, three or four wheels within a fraction of a second. In Track mode the ability to add more power to individual wheels enables the radius of corners to be tightened, potentially reducing lap times.\n\nThe Lotus Evija is equipped with ESP stability control to ensure safety in all road conditions, with further grip provided by the four-wheel drive system. A pure steering feel – a vital ingredient of every Lotus – is assured via an electro-hydraulic system.\n\nThe car is built on a one-piece motorsport-inspired carbon fibre monocoque chassis. It is supplied by CPC, the Modena, Italy-based world-leader in composite technology. Constructed from multiple carbon plies, the manufacturing process is identical to that of an F1 chassis, and ensures the lightest, stiffest, safest and most technically advanced Lotus road car platform ever built. The total weight of the monocoque tub is a mere 129kg.\n\nThis chassis, coupled with innovative engineering and clever packaging throughout every element of the Evija’s powertrain, has contributed to a target weight of 1,887kg.\n\nThe interior of the Lotus Evija is as dramatic as the exterior. Inspired by the technical precision of race car engineering, the dominant characteristic of the cabin is the ‘floating wing’ dashboard which can be glimpsed from outside through the windscreen. The design also echoes the porosity of the exterior.\n\nAccess to the cabin is through the two dihedral doors. Handle-free to preserve the sculpted exterior, they’re operated via the key fob. It’s the first time Lotus has used such doors, and while they make for a moment of dramatic theatre they also provide maximum space for getting in and out.\n\nAn exceptional attention to detail – as people would expect from Lotus – is at the heart of the interior. For example, visible carbon fibre surfaces enhance the sense of light weight, while a thin metal band – engraved with the words ‘For The Drivers’ – runs centrally through the squab of both seats.\n\nOnce in the car, a switch in the roof console closes the doors. The location aids the minimalist layout of the main control panel and prevents them being activated accidentally.\n\nInside, the cabin strikes the perfect balance between the precise functionality of a track car and the comfort of a road car. The driving position is fully adjustable to accommodate the greatest range of occupants. The elegant carbon fibre shell seats are hand-trimmed with thick Alcantara-finished pads, and feature manual fore / aft adjustment plus electric back operation. The steering column is manually adjustable for both rake and reach. Three-point seatbelts are fitted as standard, with four-point harnesses an option. Built into the bodyshell, close to the occupants’ hip point, are two bespoke storage areas.\n\nThe design of the steering wheel, similar to that found in an LMP or F1 car, further reinforces the Evija’s sporting intentions. The outer ring is finished in Alcantara as standard with leather available as an option. Buttons are grouped in an intuitive manner and govern functions including phone use, cruise control and DRS deployment.\n\nMounted centrally at the base of the wheel’s hub is the mode controller. There are five modes – Range, City, Tour, Sport and Track – with various of the car’s performance features activated or deactivated depending on which is selected.\n\nAhead of the steering wheel is a state-of-the-art digital display, providing the driver with key information such as mode, battery charge and remaining range. It is the car’s only screen, putting all necessary information in one place. The screen displays essential functions only, with information appearing as required when the appropriate button is pushed, then fading when no longer needed.\n\nFurther controls are located on the floating ‘ski slope-style’ centre console, which features touch-sensitive haptic feedback buttons. Each is integrated in hexagonal recesses to help guide the driver’s fingers. As the light plays over the surface it creates an almost organic visual effect. The driver can also interact intuitively with the car’s technology via a control wheel. The honeycomb design of the buttons is replicated on indicator stalks and on the surface of the aluminium foot pedals.\n\nThe Evija’s cabin has been deliberately designed so that the occupants feel they are at one with the vehicle. Climate control and a premium infotainment system are fitted as standard. Customers can seamlessly integrate their smartphones via Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, accessing their own music and navigation."
