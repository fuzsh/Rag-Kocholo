        "text": "Lotus Cars By Model Number\n\nA list of all model numbers used by Lotus\n\nAlso available as a .doc file here. Thanks to Torsten Hook.\n\nLotus is a unique car company that grew from the fertile genius of Colin Chapman. The early creations were a blend of sport, competition and street use cars. As the company grew the cars became purpose built race cars and production road cars that were thinly disguised race cars that spent the weekdays going to and from work and on the weekends circulating around the local race tracks. MARK 1 1948 The first, based upon a 1930 Austin 7 saloon. Trials Special The chassis was constructed in a manner that Chapman had learned from his engineering schooling. Every body panel was stressed such that it would add to overall strength of the car without adding unnecessary weight, an engineering philosophy which was to carry on for the rest of Lotus history. MARK 2 1949 A much improved specials for Trials, circuit Trials and racing special and track use. First fitted with a Ford 8 motor Ford 1172 cc side valve and later upgraded to a 1172cc Ford 10. 4 speed Significant were the steering headlamps enclosed by the grill. MARK 3 1951 to 1952 The first Lotus built for closed circuit 750 Formula Car racing. Chapman designed to win the 750cc Chassis weighed 65 lbs Championship. Chapman and his then girl friend, Hazel, drove the car to the race, promptly won and then drove home. Chapman cleverly developed an intake manifold to \"de-siameze\" the usual two port Austin engine, subsequently the rules were changed to ban such manifolds. The first Lotus sold to customers. MARK 4 1952 With his shop behind his father's hosterly Trials Car in Hornsey, Chapman begat Lotus Engineering. The Mark 4 was a upgraded Mark 2 with a 1172cc Ford engine. MARK 5 xxxx This car was never built. It was to be the first 100mph 750cc formula car. MARK 6 1952 to 1955 The Mark Six was the first production sports Tubular chassis, 55 lbs car for Lotus. The Mark Six used independent Ford 1099cc, 40 bhp front suspension, and a tubular steel space 3 Speed Ford frame covered by stressed panels of aluminum. Number built: 110 The Mark Six was extremely successful both on the track and on the road. MARK 7 1952 The Mark Seven was a Formula 2 racer. Sports Racing Car That became the Chairmontes special. Mark 7 Productions Sports Car An upgraded Mark 6. Its introduction was Series 1: Seven F, Seven 7, put off until time was found in the busy Super Seven, Seven A, racing circuit. The chassis is a simplified Seven A America version of the Eleven with stressed aluminum Series 2: Seven F, Seven A, panels in the undertray and sides. Numerous Seven A America, Seven, engines (Ford, BMC, and Coventry Climax) Super Seven, SCCA Cosworth, and upgrades were made over the 16 years Super Seven 1500, of production. Still in production today Cosworth Super Seven 1500 in variant of the Caterham Seven.1957 to 1973 Series 3: Economy, Standard, Seven SS, Seven S Series 4 (see Type 60) MARK 8 1954 Chapman brought aerodynamics to racing with Sports Racing Car Frank Costin, aeronautical aerodynamics MG 1467cc engineer with De Havilland Aircraft Company. Tubular space frame The Mark 8 could exceed 125mph with only Independent Front Suspension 85 horsepower. The Mark 8 had a fully paneled deDion rear suspension undertray illustrating that Costin was fully aware that the air flow beneath the car was as important as that above the car a lesson that Chapman was to later take to the extreme. MARK 9 1955 With Mike Costin in full time employment Lotus Sports Racing Car developed a smaller lighter more aerodynamic Coventry Climax FWA car than the Mk 8. The Mark 9 was raced at Top Speed: 127 mph Sebring and led at Le Mans in the 1100cc class. 0-60: 7.8 sec MARK 10 1955 Customer Mike Anthony wanted a Mk8 capable Sports Racing Car of running a 2 liter six cylinder Bristol Bristol 1971cc engine engine. The Mk 10 used Dunlop disc brakes Bristol 4 speed front and rear with an aerodynamic low drag body. MARK 11 1956 to 1958 The \"Eleven\" was a class winning car at Sports Racing Car Le Mans. It set the world speed record for Coventry Climax: an 1100cc (67 CID) car at 143mph! The Eleven FWA 1098cc won in class at the LeMans 24 hours of FWB 1460cc Endurance in the 1500cc and 1100cc classes Tubular space frame and took the overall win for the Index oF Performance. Revised in 1956 to Series 2 specifications. TYPE 12 1957 The Type 12 was first raced in 1957. Formula 2 and Formula 1 This was the first non-road going Lotus. Coventry Climax FPF A single seat race car tubular space framed Lotus 5 speed Formula 2 racer. The car showed promise and Weight: 660 lbs was Lotus' beginning in what was to become the most successful modern racing team. TYPE 13 Was not allocated, but is considered 11 Series 2. TYPE 14 - Elite 1957 to 1963 The Lotus Elite was introduced at the 1957 Earls Production GT Car Court Motor Show. Years ahead of its time the Coventry Climax FWE Elite body and chassis were of a fiberglass Monocoque GRP Chassis/Body monocoque design with suspension pieces bolted Independent Suspension to the fiberglass structure at reinforced points. 4 wheel disc brakes The entire structure was extremely light and Drag Coeficient: 0.30 Cd rigid. The 1960 LeMans race had four Elites Weight: 1485 lbs running, one of which won the 1300cc class and was 14th overall and another won the Index of Thermal Efficiency. TYPE 15 1958 to 1960 Aimed at LeMans the sports racing Lotus 15 Sport Racing Car was based upon the F2 Type 12. Wishbone front Tubular space frame suspension, fitted with 1.5, 2.0 and 2.2 Climax engines. TYPE 16 1958 to 1959 The car was a formula car fashioned after the Formula 1 and Formula 2 Vanwall. Uprated engined cars were the first Coventry Climax FPF Lotus cars to compete in Formula 1. The cars Tubular space Frame broke continually and failed to score Lotus' first F1 win. TYPE 17 1959 This was the last front engined Sports Racing Sports Racing Car Lotus. A large car designed by Len Terry, Conventry Climax FWA used strut suspension at all four corners. TYPE 18 1960 The Lotus revolution begins; the Lotus 18 was Formula 1, 2 and Junior one of the first race cars with mid-engine Tubular Space Frame design. Although under powered when compared Double Wishbone suspension to the competition of the then dominant Ferraris, the Lotus 18 was capable of out handling the Ferraris. Thus in the hands of Sterling Moss Lotus scored its first Formula One victory at the 1960 Grand Prix of Monaco. TYPE 19 1960 to 1962 The Type 18 was widened and formed into Lotus' Sports Racing Car first mid-engined sports racer. Very quick, Tubular Space Frame powered by 2.0 and 2.5 Climax FPF engines. The 19B was built for Dan Gurney and powered by a Ford V8. TYPE 20 1961 Formula Junior replacement for the Type 18. Formula Junior Still used the half shafts as the upper Cosworth Ford 105E suspension link in the rear. Used fiberglass Renault 4 speed panels for the bodywork. Dominated the class Weight: 805 lbs powered by a Ford 105E tuned by Cosworth. Sent to the U.S. powered by a Ford 1500cc derivative. TYPE 21 1961 Driven by Jim Clark in both the F1 series Formula 1 and Tasman series. The first car to use Coventry Climax FPF rocker arm front suspension with inboard ZF 5 speed front springs and double wishbone rear suspension. TYPE 22 1962 Dominated the F2 class is an Formula Junior understatement. At only 880 lbs and Cosworth Ford 105E powered with a Cosworth Ford 1098cc Girling Disc Brakes engine with 100 hp and slanted 30Â° made the Lotus 22 a winner. TYPE 23 1962 to 1964 One of the most popular sports racers in Sports Racing Lotus history. Powered by the Ford based Lotus Twin Cam 1498cc, engines, 1100cc and later the Lotus Twin Cam. Tubular Space Frame Used Type 19 suspension, with larger tanks. TYPE 24 1962 The last space frame (tube) Lotus, this Formula 1 car was basically a Type 21 developed to Coventry Climax FWMV fit a Climax or BRM V8 engine. The cars ZF 5 speed were sold to customers who did not suspect the advent of the Lotus Type 25. TYPE 25 1962 to 1965 The most successful car of the 1500cc Formula 1 Formula 1 era. It was the first Formula 1 Coventry Climax FWMV race car to use a chassis based upon ZF 5 speed monocoque construction. The success Bath Tub Monocoque of the Lotus 25 allowed Jimmy Clark Weight: 995 lbs to win 14 Formula One Grand Prix Races and the World's Driver's Championship and Lotus to win the World's Constructor's Championship in 1963. TYPE 26 - Elan 1962 to 1971 The Elan was the first Lotus use the now Productions Sports Car famous backbone chassis. The backbone Lotus Twin Cam 1558cc chassis used the principles of monocoque 26R: Racing Version construction and was easy to build, yet Series 1: 1962 - 1964 light and very rigid. This structure was Series 2: 1964 - 1965 suspended independently and had disc brakes Series 3: See 36 & 45 at each wheel. The body was fiberglass. Series 4: See Type 45 The Elan continued in production through 1974 and became the most produced Lotus ever. TYPE 27 1963 A monocoque Formula Jr. front rocker arm suspension with lower wishbones and rear twin radius arms with lower wishbones and upper links. Initially fiberglass was used for the tub paneling that was later replaced by alloy panels. Formula Junior Cosworth Ford 1097cc Weight: 880 lbs TYPE 28 - The Lotus Cortina 1963 to 1966 Ford of England came to Lotus to build 1000 Production Sedan special Cortina GT's with a twin cam engine Lotus Twin Cam 1558cc to compete in Group 2. The Lotus Cortina Ford 4 speed sported a completely different rear suspension, light alloy body panels and Lotus Twin Cam engine. Top speed was 105 mph, 0-60 in 9.9 sec. So potent was the performance of the Lotus Cortina that they dominated the Sedan classes. TYPE 29 1963 The Lotus 29 was based upon the Lotus 25, Indianapolis but was built with its suspension offset Ford V8 4260cc - 370 bhp to the left specifically to handle the left Monocoque chassis turns at the Indianapolis 500. Jim Clark finished second at Indy, 1st at Milwaukee and dominated at Trenton. TYPE 30 1964 to 1965 A powerful Ford V8 pushed this sports racer Group 7 Sports with backbone chassis. Front suspension was Ford V8 4727cc - 350 bhp double wishbone and rear was upper wishbone and reversed lower wishbone.

Hewland Mk 4, 5 speed Driven by Jim Clark with a 2.5 Liter FPF in the Tasman series. TYPE 33 1964 to 1965 The Lotus 33 evolved from the Lotus 25. The 33 Formula 1; Single Seater nearly took Jim Clark and Lotus to back to back Coventry Climax FWMV Driver's and Constructor's Championships in 1964. ZF 5DS10, 5 speed It was only a split oil line on the last lap Aluminum Monocoque of the last race that robbed them of their Weight: 985 lbs victories. But, in 1965 the Lotus 33 did its job, taking Clark and Lotus to their second Championship. TYPE 34 1964 Lotus assaulted Indy with a modified version Indianapolis of the Lotus 29, powered by a Ford four-cam V8. Ford 4200cc V8, 4 cam Extremely quick set lap records but was Monocoque chassis hampered by inadequate Dunlop tires. Won at Weight: 1250 lbs Milwaukee with Parnelli Jones, Foyt second. Parnelli won again at Trenton. Foyt 2nd in the 1965 Indy. TYPE 35 1965 A formula car for F2 and F3 developed from Formula 2, 3 and Formula B the Type 27 and 32.

TYPE 38 1965 Again a full monocoque single seat race car Indianapolis built for one race, the Indy 500. Powered Ford four cam V8 4200cc, 500 bhp by a quad cam V8 Ford, the Lotus 38 used an ZF 2 speed offset chassis similar in design to that of Full monocoque the Lotus 29. Jim Clark dominated the 1965 Weight: 1250 lbs Indy 500 winning it handily. The Lotus 38 was the first mid-engine car and first British car to win at Indy. The Lotus 38 returned in 1966 to finish second at Indy. TYPE 39 1966 This was a Type 33 modified by Maurice Phillippe. Tasman Formula The 39 used a space frame subframe to carry a Coventry Climax FPF 2.5 liter Climax FPF bolted to the main monocoque Hewland 5 speed chassis to win a Tasman Championship for Jim Clark TYPE 40 1965 The Lotus 30 was strengthened with a stronger Sports Racing chassis and suspension. The bodywork was Ford 5.3 liter V8, 410 bhp distinctive with two angled stack exhausts Hewland LG500 5 speed emerging from the rear deck. The last Lotus Backbone chassis sports racer to be built. Only 3 built. TYPE 41, 41B, 41C 1966 to 1968 A Formula 3 car used a wide track and spaceframe Formula 2, 3 and B chassis based upon the Lotus 22 and 31. Cosworth MAE - 100 bhp The 41 chassis was stiffer due to added Hewland Mk4 4 speed sheet steel paneling around the pedal box and undertray. The 41B was the Formula B version for America. TYPE 42 1967 The 1966 Indy car intended for a BRM H16 Indianapolis 4.2 liter engine, but the engine was not Ford four cam V8 4200cc ready and the car was fitted with a ZF 2 speed Ford V8 for 1967. A tubular space frame Monocoque & space frame was added to carry the Ford V8. The monocoque ended behind the driver and the original BRM engine was to carry the rear suspension. TYPE 43 1966 - 1967 Chapman truncated the monocoque chassis, ending Formula 1 it abruptly behind the driver. The engine was BRM H16 2996cc mounted to the rear bulkhead and the entire BRM 6 speed rear suspension was mounted to the engine and Stressed Monocoque transaxle. Other teams declared that the car Weight: 1105 lbs would fold in half at the first corner. Today EVERY Formula One, Indy Car and World Endurance Cup car has a truncated monocoque chassis with its engine and transaxle carrying the rear suspension, it is now accepted as the \"only\" way to build a fast race car. TYPE 44 1966 A Formula 2 monocoque car based upon the 35 Formula 2 with 41 wide-track suspension. Powered by a Cosworth SCA 997cc engine with 140 bhp and fitted with a Hewland 5 speed gear box. TYPE 45 1967 The Series 3 Elan. Replaced the Type 26 Production Sports Car with detail changes to the body and interior. A SE (Special Equipment version with 115 bhp was introduced. TYPE 46 - Europa 1966 to 1967\n\nThe first roadable mid-priced mid-engined Production Sports Car street car produced. The Europa were powered Series 1 by a Lotus modified Renault engine producing Series 2: See 54 & 65 some 85 horsepower. Fitted in a backbone Twin Cam: See 74 chassis with a fiberglass body Thus seemingly meager 85 HP moved the Europa down the road with 0 to 60 times under 10 seconds. As usual the handling was often described by motor journalist as being the nearest thing to a Formula car for the street. TYPE 47 - Europa 1967\n\nPowered by a 165 hp 1594cc Lotus Ford Twin Cam Competition Sports Car engine this was the racing version of the Type 46. Lotus Cosworth 1594cc Light weight alloy components were used in the Hewland FT200 5 speed suspension. The 47 was successful in the 2 liter class. TYPE 48 1968 A 1600cc Formula 2 car with a monocoque Formula 2 chassis and a tubular space frame engine Cosworth 1599c bay. Suspension was similar to the Lotus 44.

TYPE 49, 1967 1967 to 1970 The Lotus 49 was an uprated Lotus 43 designed Formula 1 for Formula 1 using a truncated monocoque Cosworth Ford DFV V8 chassis. In its inaugural race it not only ZF 5DS12, 5 speed took pole position in the hands of Graham Hill Monocoque but was victorious in the hands of Jim Clark. Stressed engine It was the car which introduced to racing to Weight: 1100 lbs the winningest Formula 1 engine, the Ford DFV. Later derivatives of the Lotus 47 introduced aerofoils, high mounted wings, wedge shaped body panels, and the use of air management to create downforce. The Lotus 49 took Graham Hill to his third World Championship and Lotus to the Constructor's Championship in 1968. TYPE 50 - The Elan Plus 2 1967 to 1974 An enlarged Elan chassis allowing for a Production Sports Coupe roomy interior and two small extra seats. Plus 2S - 1968 Backbone chassis, with Lotus twin cam Plus 2S 130 - 1971 engine. Upgrade versions were later offered. Plus 2S 130/5 - 1972 Top speed was over 120 mph, 0-60 in 8.2 seconds and fuel consumption 28 mpg. TYPE 51, 51A, 51C 1967 to 1968 Based upon the space frame of the Type 22 Formula Ford and 31 and powered by a Ford Cortina GT Ford Cortina GT 1599cc push rod engine with narrow road type tires. TYPE 52 - Europa 1968 This was the prototype of what was to be- Proposed Production GT come the Europa Twin Cam, but the car was shelved until 1971 TYPE 53 1968 Another shelved project, a sports racer Sports Racing Car derived from the Type 23. TYPE 54 - Europa 1968\n\nThe Series 2 Europa, a separate chassis and Production GT body and improved equipment and interior. TYPE 55 1968 A Formula 3 car based upon the Type 41, the Formula 3 first Lotus to show a truly wedged shaped body. Used Gold Leaf Team Lotus Colors. TYPE 56 1968 The Lotus 56 was sponsored by STP and Indianapolis Andy Granatelli. It was Granatelli's second Pratt & Whitney turbine year at the 1968 Indy 500 with a turbine Ferguson 4 wheel drive powered car. The car's body was shaped as Full Monocoque chassis closely to a outright wedge as possible, thus Weight: 1350 lbs the body of the car was capable of developing extreme downforce. This design coupled with the Pratt & Whitney turbine allowed the Lotus 56 to dominate not only in qualifying, but Joe Leonard and Art Pollard ran away and hid from the field only to be sidelined in the waning laps while leading by a 10 cent O-ring. TYPE 56B 1968 After the success of the 56 a Formula 1 gas Formula 1 turbine equivalent of the 56 with four wheel Pratt & Whitney turbine drive was developed. However the engine was Ferguson 4 wheel drive not ready until 1970 and the 56B was not raced until 1971. TYPE 57 1968 A design study for a Formula 1 car with deDion Formula 1 rear suspension that did not get beyond the design stage. TYPE 58 1968 A Formula 2 car with de Dion rear suspension. Formula 2 Built and tested with both a Cosworth FVA 1600cc for Formula 2 and a Cosworth DFV V8 for Formula 1.

Chapman had seen the benefit Ford V8 2605 cc 4 wheel drive and with Mario Andretti Lotus Hewland at the helm set record times during the 4 wheel drive practice sessions. However the car never raced due to poorly heat-treated rear hubs. TYPE 65 - Europa 1969 to 1970\n\nU.S. Federal equipped Europa Series 2. Production GT Used larger capacity Renault engines of 1565cc and were raised to meet headlight height requirements. TYPE 66 Only Lotus and Chapman know. TYPE 67 1970 Proposed Tasman car, but car was never built. TYPE 68 1969 Prototype Formula A/5000. Wedge bodywork Formula A and 5000 and Ford 4945cc 480 bhp V8 powered. Had Ford Boss 302 V8 a wedge shaped monocoque chassis. Originally Hewland LG600, 4 speed used tail radiators but were later moved to the nose. TYPE 69 1970 to 1971 Formula 2 and 3 car developed from the Formula 2, 3 and Ford Type 59 to meet the uprated Formula 2 requirements. Radiator was mounted lower and was covered by a lower more wedge-like nose. TYPE 70 1970 A much modified Lotus 68 designed to be Formula 5000 and Formula A powered by an Chevrolet 5 liter V8. Later a second car was built for a Ford Boss 302 engine. Only 7 cars were built with limited racing success. TYPE 71 The number was never used. TYPE 72 1970 to 1975 The winningest Formula One race car ever Formula 1 raced. The Lotus 72 used variable rate Cosworth Ford DFV torsion bar springs at both front and V8, 2993cc rear, front inboard disc brakes, the Hewland FG, 5 speed continuation of the wedge aerodynamic Monocoque chassis bodywork, multiple element rear wing Weight: 1170 lbs and side radiators. Today nearly every formula car uses these elements introduced by the Lotus 72. The Lotus 72 won 3 World's Constructor's Championships and 2 Driver's Championships and is the only Formula One race car to have won 20 Grand Prix races. TYPE 73 1972 The last commercially available race car Formula 3 from Lotus. Much of the development for Novamotor Ford twin cam the 72 was incorporated into the 73.
