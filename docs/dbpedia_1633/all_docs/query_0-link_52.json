        "text": "A lower, slimmer and better packaged version of the Cooper T51, the \"lowline\" Cooper T53 dominated the 1960 season with works drivers Jack Brabham and Bruce McLaren finishing first and second in the World Championship.\n\nThe factory had a pair of T53s ready for the BRDC International Trophy in May 1960. Every aspect of the car had been reassessed in search of the greatest possible simplicity, strength, weight and efficiency. The ERSA gearbox was replaced with a new five-speed C5S transaxle designed by Cooper designer Owen Maddock and built by Jack Knight Engineering in London, and the leaf-spring rear suspension that was preferred by Charles Cooper was replaced with the coil-spring strut type suspension that Stirling Moss had used on Rob Walker's T51 in 1959. The 4-cylinder Coventry Climax FPF engine was mounted an inch lower and the driving position was more reclined, earning the car its 'Lowline' nickname. Three successive victories in the Netherlands, Belgium and France gave Brabham a huge championship lead, and despite Moss's best efforts in his Lotus, McLaren scored enough points to finish second in the championship. For 1961, Cooper built a series of production replicas for customers to use in the new 1.5-litre Formula 1. Even Rob Walker bought one for Stirling Moss to use in Intercontinental Formula races. These cars are given the same type number in Cooper records but many historians refer to them as Cooper T53P to distinguish them from the 1960 factory cars.\n\nAny other contributions to this massive jigsaw puzzle would be greatly appreciated. Please email Allen if you can add anything.\n\nCooper T53 1960 production\n\nThe Cooper factory built two new 'lowlines' for the 1960 F1 season, adding a third car as a spare later in the season, and then building a fourth for Jack Brabham to use as a private car.\n\nThe Production Cooper T53s\n\nCooper put the championship-winning Cooper 'T53' into production for 1961. One last car was built in 1963.\n\nUnidentified Cooper T53s in 1961\n\nGenerations of Cooper scholars - this writer included - have had difficulty identifying how the the two 1960 works cars, F2-5-60 and F2-8-60, were used in 1961. One difficulty in this was that Jack Brabham's private car, F2-17-60, had been conflated with his works car, F2-8-60 in some early histories. The existence of F2-17-60 was known by 2010, but it was only in 2018 that a detailed study of photographs clarified precisely when Brabham drove F2-8-60 and when he drove F2-17-60. By 2019, we knew that F2-8-60 had been raced by Ron Flockhart at Silverstone in May 1961, but not where it went after that. It was only in early 2024, with the emergence of John Coyle's photographs, that it became clear that F2-8-60 was sold to America during September 1962.\n\nBy May 1961, when F2-8-60 last raced in F1, the CT 'Tommy' Atkins team was already running a Cooper T53 in Intercontinental and minor F1 races for Bruce McLaren. That car could either be F2-5-60 or could be an all-new new car built at the Atkins workshop. Then later in the season, Arthur Owen used a Cooper T53 in British hillclimbs that initially appeared in works colours and was said in Autosport's 1962 end-of-season review to be an \"ex-Tommy Atkins ICF Cooper Climax\". We can now be sure neither was F2-8-60, but as the Atkins and Owen cars existed at the same time as each other, there has to be an extra car here. If Autosport was correct, the inference is that the Atkins team used F2-5-60 at the start of the 1961 season, then built a new car to replace it prior to the 1961/62 'Down Under' season, at which point F2-5-60 was sold to Owen. Unfortunately, only a very small number of photographs of Owen's car have been found, so this part of the puzzle remains unsolved.\n\nThe extra Parnell F1 Coopers in 1961\n\nMany of the problems with identification of the Lowline 'T53' Coopers are due to the actions of Reg Parnell's Yeoman Credit team. In 1961, Parnell's team bought three Cooper T53s off the production line, chassis F1-1-61, F1-2-61 and F1-4-61, that appears to have built three more cars during the year. One of these was a T53 chassis with streamlined bodywork and was known as \"VR\", and a second was built using a Cooper T56 Formula Junior chassis. When the T56-based car appeared at Monza, Denis Jenkinson noted that this brought their team strength to six, two F1s, two ICs and now two specials. His comment proves that there were four standard T53s in the team, so an extra standard car must have been built.\n\nThe name 'P2' is given here to that fourth standard T53 used by Yeoman Credit Parnell in 1961. The Formula 1 Register developed the notation 'P1', 'P2', to denote extra cars built by the Parnell team and their notation is used here for \"VR\" ['P1'] and the extra standard car ['P2'].\n\nUnidentified Cooper T53s in 1962\n\nDuring the first week of January 1962, Parnell's team had two cars at the South Africa Grand Prix: one T53 for Maggs plus the T56 Special for Bruce Johnstone; while another two Parnell team Lowlines were already in New Zealand for the Grand Prix at Ardmore just four days later. But also in that Ardmore paddock were two ex-Parnell Lowlines, one for Lex Davison and a second for Angus Hyslop, the history of whose car was obfuscated due to the need for it to come into the country wearing the same chassis plate as Hyslop's earlier Cooper T45. So that adds up to five Parnell Cooper Lowlines in addition to the T56 Special, while the distinctively rebodied \"VR\" had presumably stayed in Europe, meaning something does not add up. Could Parnell really have built three extra Cooper lowlines?\n\nMeanwhile there is a problem to be solved with the Cooper T53s in the US as well. Hap Sharp had bought F2-12-60 from Cooper after the 1961 Indy 500 but Cooper records also show him buying a new car, F1-15-61, in time for the US GP. One T53 went to Alan Connell, and it has always been assumed that it was one of Sharp's cars. But which one? Connell and later owners were under the impression his car was the Indy 500 spare car, so F2-12-60, but when Jim Hall donated the other car to the Indy Museum, that one was believed to have been the Indy car. They can't both be right. One possibility is that Sharp never owned F1-15-61 at all, and just bought it on behalf of Connell. In which case, Sharp's car in the 1961 GP was actually F2-12-60, and Connell was mistaken about his car having Indy history. Will we ever get to the bottom of this?\n\nThe Centro Sud Cooper T53\n\nAs well as Reg Parnell's Yeoman Credit team and, quite probably, the Tommy Atkins team, a third team constructed a new Cooper T53 outside the factory: the Centro Sud team in Italy. This car was built for a Maserati engine, and was fabricated slightly wider in the centre, to accommodate the slightly larger engine.\n\nUnidentified Cooper T53s from 1963 to 1969\n\nA considerable number of T53s ran in minor racing later in the 1960s and it has not been possible to work out which was which in all cases. Some, on closer inspection, may turn out to be T51s or earlier cars. The following are those to have been identified as T53s from photographic evidence or are widely believed to be T53s. The late David McKinney maintained a list of ten probable T53s from the 1960s so more will be added to this list as the photographic evidence becomes available.\n\nUnidentified Cooper T53s from 1970 onwards\n\nBy the end of the 1960s, almost all the original T53s had faded from sight. Historic racing was growing by this stage, led by the Vintage Sports Car Club in the UK which arranged races from the mid-1960s onwards for front-engined cars from the Maserati 250F era. By the middle of the 1970s, attention was turning to newer cars, with the Historic Sports Car Club (HSCC) catering for rear-engined F1 cars. An HSCC series sponsored by Lloyds & Scottish in 1979 gave a higher profile to these races, and Cooper T53s started to increase in value.\n\nThe difficulty was finding these old cars, as many had not been seen since the late 1960s and quite a few had their careers terminated by accidents. John Coetzer had \"wiped out\" F1-1-61 in South Africa, Roy Salvadori had wrecked F1-4-61 in Australia, Stan Starcevich had wrecked F1-5-61 in Australia, somebody had reportedly wrecked F1-6-61 in Switzerland, Shane Summers had destroyed F1-8-61, and Bernard Collomb had wrecked F1-9-61. With nobody in the 1960s having any reason to believe car values would escalate so sharply in the 1980s, many of these cars were parted out and only a few components survived. John Harper was very active tracking down those remains, and through his efforts a number of cars were reconstructed, often with replacement chassis frames. However, there are still gaps in many of the cars' lives.\n\nThe list below is a mixture of cars where we do not have enough evidence to reliably connect them to an original entity. In some cases they comprise new chassis frames and new bodies, plus an indeterminate number of components in them that are said to have come from original cars. Unfortunately, in some cases the provenance of the components has not been determined with sufficient confidence. In other cases, the cars appear genuine, but it is unclear which car they are.\n\nAny new evidence about these cars would be most welcome.\n\nOther cars of relevance\n\nThere are other cars that have a relevance to the Cooper T53 story, either because they were thought to be T53s at some point, or because they were very similar cars. These include:\n\nThe Cooper T54 Indy car. The Cooper T54 was very similar in appearance to the T53. After its final Indy 500 appearance in 1963, it was sold off the SCCA Formula A and was owned by Don Radbruch (Palo Alto, CA), Dick Terrell (San Bruno, CA), Bob McLease (Seattle, WA) and Tony Soleski (Tacoma, WA) over the next ten years. For the full story, see the Cooper T54 page.\n\nGeorge Alderman (Wilmington, Delaware) raced a Cooper with a 1500cc Alfa Romeo engine in SCCA events from July 1962 up to early 1965. As photographs showed a Lowline of some sort, it was unclear whether he had a T53 or a T56. Thanks to local press articles made available on newspapers.com, it is now possible to be certain that this was a Formula Junior car, converted from Ford to Alfa power in mid-1962.\n\nGraham Eden appeared at a few libre races in England in 1963 with a Cooper with 1475cc AJB Arden engine. This car was thought to be a Cooper T53, but a photograph shows that it had the narrower bodywork and smaller fuel tanks of a Formula Junior Cooper T56. Cooper T53 owner Flavio Puccinelli spotted the key detail: on a T53, the frame has curved tubes under the gearbox for clearance of the larger C5S gearbox, whereas Eden's car has straight tubes.\n\nFrank Dochnal (actually Frank J. Dochnal) drove a Cooper T51 at the 1963 Mexican GP meeting but crashed in practice and did not start. For a long time, this car was a complete unknown and was listed in some sources as a T53. However, an interview conducted with Dochnal by the now defunct F1 Rejects website in 2003 clarified that his car was a T51. An advert on Motorsports Market (retrieved 20 May 2008) gives the identity F2-23-59 as Dochnal's car. From Dochnal, it went to Ed Mackay (Camarillo, CA) 1964 - Ivan Zaremba (Berkeley, CA) Dec 1966 - Ron Fink (Crockett, CA) early 1970. Acquired from Fink by Steve Froines (Dublin, CA) early 1970s, restored, raced extensively and retained until 2005. In 2007, this car was raced at Monterey by Murray Smith.\n\nFrank Ballard (Weisburg, Indiana) raced a 2.7-litre Cooper-Maserati in 1964 which was thought at one stage to have been the Cooper T54, but photographs have shown that it was a T51. This car went to Jerry RuLon (Cedar Falls, Iowa) for Formula A racing in Iowa and Wisconsin in 1965, and it was then described as ex-Salvadori. Al Brase remembers first seeing RuLon with the car at the opening day at the NEITA Raceway drag course when it opened in July 1965. He then worked for RuLon as a 16-year-old in 1966, and recalls that RuLon had wrecked the car and had been badly hurt in the accident. Some engine parts were still at RuLon Automotive Imports and RuLon had an intention to build a two-seater chassis, but it appears that the Cooper had effectively ceased to exist. Gretchen Harris Suiter also recalls that the car was crashed at a SCCA road course event and was \"totally demolished\".\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis research was originally the result of the collaborative efforts of Allen Brown in England, Eric Perrin in Switzerland and the late John Blanden in Australia.
