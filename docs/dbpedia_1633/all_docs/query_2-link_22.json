Import restrictions are to be\n\nexpected and must be considered\n\n# The lot price is exclusive of VAT. VAT, at the current rate of 20%,\n\nis added to the auction price to obtain a price including VAT on\n\nwhich the sales commission is calculated. This VAT is recoverable\n\nfor the French professional. It is refundable for a buyer outside\n\nthe EU on presentation of proof of export from the EU or for a\n\nprofessional buyer who can prove an intra-Community VAT number\n\nand a document proving delivery in the Member State.\n\nThe legislator imposes strict rules for the commercial use of inert\n\nanimal species. The international regulations of March 3, 1973 (CITES)\n\nrequires for different annexes a correlation between the specimen and\n\nthe documentation proving the origins to be lawful. This regulation\n\ntranscribed in European Community law (Annexes A / B / C) in Rule\n\n338 / 97 of 9 / 12 / 1996 permits commercial use of regulated specimens\n\n(CITES) upon presentation of documentation proving lawful origin; these\n\ndocuments for this variation are as follows :\n\nGUARANTEES\n\nIn accordance with the law, the information given in the catalog is the\n\nresponsibility of SAS Claude Aguttes and its expert, taking into account\n\nthe corrections announced at the time of the presentation of the object\n\nand recorded in the sale report. The attributions have been established\n\ntaking into account the scientific and artistic knowledge at the date of\n\nthe sale. The order of the catalog will be followed. Potential buyers are\n\ninvited to examine the items that may interest them before the auction.\n\nA prior exhibition allows them to see the condition of the items for sale.\n\nThe state of conservation of the works is not specified in the catalog.\n\nPotential buyers, if they do not wish to come to the auction, may request\n\nadditional photos, videos and/or condition reports. Requests must be\n\nmade 24 hours prior to the sale. The reproductions of the works in the\n\ncatalog are as accurate as possible, although differences in color or\n\ntone may occur. Dimensions are given as an indication only. No claims\n\nwill be accepted after the auction. The French text is the official text\n\nwhich will be used in case of dispute. Descriptions in other languages\n\nand dimensions in inches are given as an indication only and cannot\n\nbe the basis for a claim. No claims will be accepted for any restorations\n\nor accidents after the auction. The condition reports requested from\n\nSAS Claude Aguttes and the expert before the sale are given as an\n\nindication. They do not engage their responsibilities and cannot be the\n\ncause of a legal claim. They are expressed to facilitate the inspection\n\nof the lot by the potential buyer and remain subject to his personal\n\nappreciation. The absence of any indication in the catalog, written\n\nor verbal condition reports, does not imply that an item is free of any\n\npresent, past or repaired defects. Conversely, the mention of some\n\ndefects does not imply the absence of all other defects.\n\nBIDS\n\nThe highest and last bidder will be the successful bidder. In the event\n\nof a double bid recognized by the auctioneer, the lot will be put up for\n\nsale again and all the amateurs present will be able to bid for the second\n\nauction. By bidding, the bidders assume the personal responsibility\n\nto pay the auction price, increased by the expenses to be paid by\n\nthe buyer and by any tax or duty due. Except in the case of a written\n\nagreement with SAS Claude Aguttes, prior to the sale, mentioning that\n\nthe bidder is acting as an agent of a third party identified and approved\n\nby SAS Claude Aguttes, the bidder is deemed to be acting in his own\n\nname. We remind our sellers that it is forbidden to bid directly on the\n\nlots belonging to them.\n\nImportant : The normal way to bid is to be present in the auction room.\n\nPHONE BIDDING: We accept telephone bids from potential buyers\n\nwho have made themselves known before the sale. We cannot be\n\nheld responsible if the telephone connection is not established, is\n\nestablished late, or in case of error or omission relating to the reception\n\nof bids by telephone.\n\nPURCHASE ORDER: We accept the bidding orders that have been\n\ntransmitted.\n\nWe are not responsible for any error or omission in the written order.\n\nBIDS THROUGH DROUOT DIGITAL OR OTHER LIVE PLATFORM\n\nOnline auctions are available.

A bidding ceiling may\n\nbe announced depending on the sales, it is advisable to deposit a\n\ndeposit beforehand in order to bid freely during the sale.

The interruption of a Live auction\n\nservice during the course of a sale does not necessarily justify the\n\nauctioneer's stopping the auction.\n\nSTORAGE AND DELIVERY AFTER THE SALE\n\nFor all CARS\n\nAn email will be sent the day after the sale to each buyer to indicate\n\nthe contact, the place and the amount to be paid to collect the vehicle.\n\nThe vehicles are stored on the evening of the sale in a closed and\n\nsecured room near Paris.
