        "text": "TEAM LOTUS, RACING LEGEND\n\nDriven initially by his passion for motor racing, Colin Chapman would have had no idea of the enormous impact that he and the brand he created, would have on the automotive world.\n\nStarting out as a ‘David’ in the automotive world, Lotus would defy the ‘Goliaths’ and become highly influential in both the international racing scene and the design and production of road cars; well beyond what could have been imagined by the young Chapman.\n\nOver more than 60 years in the making, Lotus has become both a class-leading manufacturer of sports cars and a globally respected automotive engineering consultancy, working with many of the world’s most prestigious car manufacturers.\n\nFrom humble beginnings, when Chapman built his first trials car in a lock-up in 1948, motorsport was the driving force; indeed it was Chapman’s desire to create competitive race cars that drove him to produce road cars in order to finance his racing ambitions! The motorsport influence has continued throughout the company’s evolution and led to a continuous thread of innovation and pioneering firsts. The link between Lotus race cars and road cars is a critical and powerful one.\n\nIt was obviously a winning tactic, because the racing team Chapman formed, Team Lotus, went on to win seven Formula One Constructors’ Championships and six Drivers’ Championship titles, and a string of other titles and conquests.\n\nThe motorsport heritage remains at the heart of Lotus today and the strategic link to developing cars which offer superlative handling and performance for driving on the race track or on the road.\n\nTeam Lotus – some key milestones\n\n– 7 F1 Constructors Championships\n\n– 6 F1 Driver’s Championships\n\n– 1 Indianapolis 500 win\n\n– 3 Class wins at Le Mans\n\n– 1 World Rally Championship\n\nDriven by some of the world’s most famous drivers including: Stirling Moss, John Surtees, Ronnie Peterson, Nigel Mansell, Ayrton Senna, Jochen Rindt, Nelson Piquet, Graham Hill, Emerson Fittipaldi, Jim Clark, Mario Andretti to name but a few…\n\nTHE 50’S\n\nTHE 80’S\n\n1980 Party Time\n\nThe awesome Esprit Turbo was launched in tremendous style at London’s Royal Albert Hall. The party also celebrated Team Lotus’ new sponsor, Essex Petroleum; the first 100 Esprit Turbos were to be built in Team Essex Lotus racing livery.\n\nLooking even more outrageous than the normally aspirated version, the (Type 82) Esprit Turbo boasted a new galvanised chassis, new suspension, and a 210bhp 16-valve turbocharged 2.2-litre engine. Its performance took it straight into the supercar league – 150mph+ and 0-60mph in 5.5 seconds.\n\nFollowing the Esprit Turbo’s introduction, the other models were updated with the latest 2.2-litre Lotus engine and a galvanised chassis, with the Elite and Eclat also benefiting from new interiors, instrumentation and switchgear. The Lotus line-up is now: Elite S2, Eclat S2, Esprit S2.2 (an interim model developed from the S2), and the Turbo.\n\nOn the racing front, the skirts on ‘ground effect’ F1 cars pioneered by Team Lotus (introduced on the Type 78) were banned by the sport’s governing body; Chapman and the Team Lotus engineers once more had to apply some lateral thinking. Setting up a race car’s suspension for the best aerodynamic effect meant that the driver wasn’t sufficiently protected from road shocks, but a softer suspension compromised the aerodynamics.\n\nTo resolve this, the Lotus Type 86 began development, with two separate chassis and two separate suspension systems. The car was a prototype and technology demonstrator and was tested extensively during the 1980 season.\n\nDuring this season Lotus competed in the Type 81 Formula One race car.\n\n1981 For Your Eyes Only\n\nBy incorporating the chassis and suspension of the Turbo into the non-turbo Esprit S3, Lotus was able to save costs on both models and passed this saving on to the customer.\n\nIn July the Esprit Turbo shot to stardom, featuring strongly in the new Bond movie ‘For Your Eyes Only,’ which received another Royal Premier.\n\n1st The Lotus Type 88 Twin Chassis Formula One car was developed for the season, the FIRST car designed with a carbon fibre monocoque, and two chassis – one in which the driver sat which was softly sprung, and the other (where the skirts etc.,) sat was stiffly sprung. This was far less punishing on the driver, but was eventually outlawed from competition by the governing body.\n\nThe Type 87 replaced it, and Nigel Mansell, who had recently joined Team Lotus, raced it alongside Elio de Angelis.\n\n1982 Tragedy strikes\n\nThe 2+2 (Type 89) Excel was launched in October, replacing the Eclat. It was neatly styled, powered by a 160bhp 2.2-litre Lotus twin-cam engine, and handled superbly.\n\nWith Elio de Angelis at the wheel, the Lotus Type 91 won its first Grand Prix Formula One race at the Austrian Grand Prix; this was to be the last win for Lotus in the Cosworth DFV engine.\n\nTragedy: The year ends in tragedy. On Thursday December 16, Anthony Colin Bruce Chapman, founder and chairman, died suddenly from a heart attack at only 54 years of age.\n\n1983 The show must go on\n\nChapman was greatly missed, but the spirit he imparted to his team and his colleagues lived on.\n\nIn May the Lotus Active Suspension System was announced. It used a pioneering system of computers to control the hydraulic suspension, to maintain the car’s balance throughout cornering, accelerating, braking, or traversing a bumpy surface. An early experimental version of the Active Suspension system was tested on the Type 92 Formula One car, driven by Mansell.\n\nAt the request of Lotus, Toyota acquired a 16.5% stake in Lotus. The two companies had been in a mutual collaboration relationship with respect to technology since 1980. Over the following few years, Toyota would increase its shareholding in Lotus to 21.5%.\n\nAn updated Excel and Esprit Turbo made their debut at the London Motorfair later in the year.\n\n1984 Strength to strength\n\nIn a bold step to demonstrate its commitment to becoming a major automotive engineering consultancy, Lotus invested £500,000 and opened two of the most sophisticated computer-controlled engine test cells in Europe.\n\nThe Hethel factory reached another milestone – 30,000 cars had been produced at the Norfolk factory since 1966.\n\nThe V8-powered Etna concept car, designed by Giugiaro, was shown at the British International Motor Show in Birmingham. The engine was Lotus’ own design, a 4.0-litre V8 developing 320bhp. Projected performance for the Etna was 0-60mph in 4.3secs, with a top speed of 180mph.\n\n1985 Talent\n\n1st As proof that Team Lotus had become a breeding ground for young talent, Ayrton Senna replaced the departing Nigel Mansell. In this first season, driving the Type 97T, the FIRST car to have aerodynamic barge boards, Senna won in Portugal (despite fearsomely wet conditions), and again at Spa.\n\nChrysler Corporation USA contracted with Lotus Engineering to develop a family of high performance 16-valve engines for its future range of passenger cars.\n\nThere was a massive leap in work-in-hand, from £3 million in June 1984 to £31 million in June 1985, thanks mainly to growth of contract work for clients worldwide. Floor space at the Hethel site was increased by 45 per cent to cope with the extra work and staff numbers rose to more than 600.\n\nTo round off the year nicely the Excel SE is announced at the London Motor Show. Among a package of all-round refinements is a new 180bhp high compression version of the Lotus 2.2-litre 16-valve engine.\n\n1986 Change of ownership\n\nLotus marked 20 years at the Hethel site.General Motors acquired 100% shareholding of Group Lotus plc.\n\nAt the Motor show Lotus launches a new high compression version of the Esprit Turbo and an automatic version of the Excel.\n\n1987 Camel colours\n\nCamel became Team Lotus’ new major sponsor, and Honda the new engine supplier.\n\n1st Ayrton Senna remained the team’s number one driver, and notched up wins at Monaco and Detroit in the Type 99T. This was the FIRST Lotus to adopt the computer controlled ‘active’ suspension, which had been under development at Lotus for some years; Senna proved its worth not just through his victories, but through 25,000 miles of rigorous testing and racing.\n\nAt the London Motorfair the new Esprit Turbo made it’s debut; restyled by designer, Peter Stevens, both inside and out. Stevens managed to give the car a more aggressive appearance, but retain its iconic stance. A normally aspirated model joined the line-up.\n\n1988 40th Anniversary\n\nIn celebration of the company’s 40th anniversary, a limited edition Esprit Turbo was produced; available only in fashionable pearlescent white with blue leather and suede interior.\n\nFormula One World Champion, Nelson Piquet joined Lotus, following Ayrton Senna’s departure. The 1988 Lotus Type 100T proudly wore the Number One of the reigning world champion.\n\n1989 Launch of Elan\n\nThis year saw the launch of the most powerful Lotus to date; the 264bhp, 164mph Esprit Turbo SE, with a 0- 60mph speed from standstill of 4.7secs.\n\nIn the October Lotus launched the (Type 100) Elan roadster at the London Motorfair. Designed in-house (with Peter Stevens in charge), the Elan broke with Lotus tradition by being front-wheel drive. This was the FIRST car to use the patented ‘Interactive Wishbone’ front suspension set-up, it handled superbly and had exceptional levels of road holding.\n\nThe Lotus Type 101 introduced the normally aspirated 3.5 litre Judd V8 engine, the car being driven by Nelson Piquet and Satoru Nakajima during the ’89 season.\n\nTHE 90’S\n\n1990 The Lotus Carlton\n\nThe legendary Lotus Carlton (Lotus Omega outside the UK) was launched; essentially a Carlton/Omega GSi completely stripped and rebuilt by Lotus, to become one of the quickest saloon cars in the world.\n\nIts specification was simply awesome. Power was from a 3.6-litre straight-six with 24 valves, two turbochargers, producing 377bhp and 419lb ft of torque. In magazine tests the Lotus Carlton pulled around 174mph; and would also run to 60mph in 5.2secs and 100mph in just 11.5secs.\n\nIn the USA, a works-supported team of three Esprit Turbo SEs entered the ‘Showroom Stock’ race series. In just nine races the team achieved four victories, six pole positions, six fastest laps, and second place in the Manufacturers’ Championship.On the engineering side of the business, the Rt. Hon. Cecil Parkinson, Secretary of State for Transport, opened a new £2 million semi-anechoic chamber and the Hethel factory.\n\n1991 Elan wins award\n\nThe Elan received the British Design Council award.\n\nTeam Lotus became privately owned by a new management consortium led by Peter Wright and Peter Collins, the latter having been a former team manager with both Benetton and Williams. Team drivers were Julian Bailey and Mika Hakkinen, with Johnny Herbert retained as official test driver.\n\nThe actor Paul Newman drove one of the three new ’91-spec race Esprit’s for the Showroom Stock series in the States.\n\nThe M200, a futuristic concept car based on the Elan caused a stir at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September, and the following month a revised Esprit range was unveiled.\n\n1992 Go for Gold\n\nChris Boardman won the 4000m Pursuit Gold Medal at the Barcelona Olympics; he was riding the revolutionary lightweight and aerodynamic carbon-composite monocoque bicycle developed by Lotus. Later he rode the Lotus ‘superbike’ to smash the World 5000m Pursuit record by more than 8.0secs.\n\nOther sporting achievements included Doc Bundy, driving the Sport Esprit X180R, taking the Drivers’ title in the Sports Car Club of America World Challenge for ‘street-legal’ cars. The X180R was produced as a strictly limited edition in the US to make it eligible for competition – later that year it formed the basis of the Esprit Sport 300, the quickest Lotus to date. The car became available in UK and EU only.\n\nLotus Engineering remained busy with the extraordinary ‘SID’ (Structure Isolation Dynamics) research vehicle, used to demonstrate some of the company’s experimental technology. Some of that technology, ‘Lotus Active’ suspension, was fitted to an Alvis Scorpion tank – coupled with a track-tensioning device, this allows the Scorpion to travel at high speed while keeping its gun steady and not shaking its crew to pieces.\n\n1993 Bugatti ownership\n\nBugatti International of Italy, a relatively new company that had been formed in 1990, bought Group Lotus from General Motors. This company had only the name in common with the original Bugatti company formed by Ettore Bugatti in 1924. Romano Artioli held a 20% share in Bugatti International with the remainder of shares held by a Luxembourg holding company, ACBN Holdings S.A. Artioli became acting CEO of Group Lotus.\n\nThe Esprit S4 had a minor facelift and a range of mechanical refinements including power-steering as standard. In May, the Esprit Sport 300 went into production, and the following month a pair of them competed in the Le Mans 24-hour race – it was the first works-supported entry for more than 30 years.\n\nA contract to design a new family of car engines for the Taiwanese government gave Lotus Engineering cause for celebration.\n\nThe new Lotus Sport 110 road bike made its debut with Team ONCE on the grueling Tour de France.\n\n1994 Elan S2\n\nThe Elan S2 was launched at the Geneva Motor Show. Featuring a new 16inch wheel and tyre package and some further suspension enhancements. The Elan S2 was to be built in a limited run of just 800 units.\n\nThere was a fresh Esprit derivative, too, the S4S, complete with 300bhp (224 kW; 304 PS) , new wheels and tyres, and revised suspension settings.\n\nAn Esprit S4 ‘Police Car’ was produced, demonstrating that there was no point running from the law.\n\nThe first Lotus Sport 110 production carbon-composite bicycle was auctioned at Sotheby’s to raise funds for the UK’s Transport Trust. And it was a busy year for the bike. In June, Boardman rode a Lotus Sport 110 to win a 30km stage of the Tour de Suisse, then in July set a new record average speed on the Prologue of the Tour de France.To nicely round off his season, Boardman won the 4km Pursuit and the 30km Road Race at the World Championships in Sicily.\n\nOut on the race track, an Esprit Sport 300, driven by Thorkild Thyrring, won the British National GT series.\n\n1995 Team Lotus disbanded\n\nSpiraling costs led to the disbanding of Team Lotus at the start of the F1 season, closing an important chapter in Lotus history.\n\nIn February, the Lotus GT race programme was brought in-house in preparation for an all-out assault on UK sports car endurance racing. Drivers Alessandro Zanardi and Alex Portman had a mixed season in the highly competitive GT2 category, but the Esprit proved a worthy contender. In wet conditions at the Silverstone British Empire Trophy four-hour race, the team managed to take class honours and crossed the finish line fourth overall.Lotus produced its 50,000th car in the March, and in celebration donated the car, an Elan S2, to Prince Charles’ Princes Trust charity; with the help of former Lotus driver and film star, Britt Ekland, and an English newspaper. The Elan S2 raised £65,000. Production of the limited edition S2 ceased in August 1995.Lotus was the featured marque at the Monterey Historic Automobile Races in California, USA. Lotus enthusiasts from around the world attended the famous event, to see a glittering display of Lotus F1, Indy, sports and road cars.\n\nThe most significant event of the year was the unveiling of the Elise, (named after the granddaughter of Chairman, Romano Artioli), at the Frankfurt Auto Show. To the obvious delight of the press and public the Elise was not only pretty, it was technically advanced and super-light. Its composite and energy absorbing chassis was made from epoxy-bonded aluminium extrusions, a world FIRST, as were its extruded aluminium suspension uprights and aluminium metal-matrix brake discs. It promised breathtaking performance (0-60mph in 5.8secs) for a price of less than £20,000.\n\n1996 Proton majority shareholder\n\nPerusahaan Otomobil Nasional Bhd (Proton) announced it had acquired an 80% majority shareholding in Group Lotus plc from ACBN Holdings S.A. (the holding company of Bugatti International). The acquisition was regarded by Proton as providing mutual benefits, with Lotus’expertise in product development and engineering, and its exclusive patents, and Proton’s manufacturing capability.\n\nThe all-new Esprit GT1 racer was unveiled at the Paul Ricard circuit in France on 1 March, the still-secret Lotus V8 lurking under its engine cover. Four days later the secret was out, when the 175mph Esprit V8 road car made its debut at the Geneva Motor Show.\n\nThe all-new Lotus-designed and extremely compact 3.5-litre V8 had twin turbos; not only did it develop an impressive 350bhp, it had a whopping 400Nm of peak torque and a very flat torque curve. As well as this new power plant, the Esprit benefited from upgraded brakes, featuring a new ABS controller and a new vacuum servo system.\n\nAt the Geneva Motorshow the Esprit S4 GT3 was well received by both public and press. It was propelled by a turbocharged and charge-cooled 2.0-litre unit pumping out 240bhp. The lightweight GT3 could do 0-60mph in 5.1secs and reached 164mph.\n\nThe Elise became the darling of the world’s motoring press, picking up countless awards and trophies for the brilliance of its handling and design. It was also a finalist in the 1996 Prince of Wales Award for Innovation – fitting recognition for the talented team who designed the car.\n\nLotus Engineering continued to expand with HRH Prince of Wales officially opening a new £3.5 million engine test cell block in late November.\n\nLotus staff create the ‘Living logo’ in the grounds of Ketteringham Hall, owned by Chapman and used by Team Lotus as a base for the development of racing cars.\n\n1997 1000th Elise\n\nThe Elise proved more of a hit than even Lotus expected – the 1000th Elise rolled off the production line in the middle of May. This forced a rethink on production volumes, which were raised to 2500 units a year from the 800 originally planned.\n\nTwo intriguing Elise versions were also unveiled. The first was a research project, powered by two Zytec electric motors, the second was the awesome Sport 190, designed as a track day powerhouse.\n\nLotus announced that it was investing £7.5 million in 19 new state-of-the-art test cells (raising the total at the Hethel site to 42), to accommodate major new engine build and development programmes. A further £1.5 million was spent on a new paintshop facility, opened in the July by the King and Queen of Malaysia.\n\nAt the London Motorshow, the Esprit V8 was treated to a new interior, and gearbox and clutch improvements. A pared-down version of the Esprit was launched, the V8 GT.\n\n1998 50th Celebrations\n\nThe Elise was chosen by the Design Council as a prestigious ‘Millennium Product’, and Group Lotus was among the first companies in Europe to achieve QS9000 certification, one of the most stringent quality management systems in the world.\n\nIn September Lotus hosted its 50th anniversary celebrations with a party at Hethel. More than 12,000 staff, dealers, club members and Lotus owners from all over the world enjoyed a superb day out, and over 2,000 Lotus cars were parked on the test track.\n\nThere’s more cause for celebration at the Birmingham Motor Show in October, as Lotus revealed the stunning 340R as a concept car.\n\nThe lightweight and big-braked Esprit Sport 350 was released as a dramatic limited edition model, and the Elise Sport 135 also took a bow – although just 50 examples were built by the factory, all its components could be bought through the company’s aftermarket outlets.\n\nIn an important collaborative venture, Lotus joined the ELEVATE consortium – the title stood for European Low Emission V4 Automotive Two-stroke Engine. Funded by the EU, the ELEVATE consortium was a research project to develop a small, compact, light weight and efficient two-stroke engine – with the potential for super-low fuel economy and emissions, unrivalled in its class.\n\nReduced fuel economy and low emissions are also the goal of the Dual-Fuel Elise, shown at the Powershift Conference at the end of October. The car has both a conventional petrol tank and a separate tank for CNG (Compressed Natural Gas). Clever packaging ensures that the CNG tank steals neither cabin nor boot space, and the system switched between fuel sources without the driver being aware. Performance and range mirror that of a standard 1.8-litre Elise.\n\nTo round off this special year Lotus launched a 50th Anniversary edition of the Elise in November.\n\n1999 Back into motorsport\n\nLotus launched the Elise 111S at Geneva Motor Show in March. Powered by a 145PS version of the 1.8-litre K series VVC engine, this sporty new derivative had a close-ratio gearbox and enhanced handling. The Opel Speedster/ VX220 concept was shown, and the car went on to be built at the Lotus factory in Hethel.\n\nLotus also revealed that the 340R was to become a production model (with a run of just 340).\n\nThe news that Lotus was to return to motorsport was widely welcomed, with its own innovative one-make race series based on the Motorsport-developed Sport Elise.\n\nTo coincide with a comprehensive redesign of the test track at Lotus’ Hethel headquarters, the Lotus Driver Training Experience wais launched in August. This was also the month that Proton unveiled its impressive Satria GTi hot hatch – Lotus had played a significant role in making this one of the best-handling cars in its class.\n\n1999 also saw the company reveal an all-new mini-supercar concept that fits into the range between the Elise and Esprit. Called Project M250, the car had a 250hp, 3 litre V6 engine.\n\nThe London show was used as the platform to announce that the Opel Speedster/Vauxhall VX220 would be built on behalf of General Motors by Lotus, at Hethel. Manufacturing was to take place in a new facility, which would give Lotus the capacity to produce 10,000 cars annually.\n\nTHE 00’S\n\n2000 Exige is here\n\nLotus Engineering continued to rapidly expand, acquiring testing and development facilities in the USA, and Lotus Engineering Inc. in Ann Arbor, Michigan was established. This represented a crucial in-road to the important American market for the automotive consultancy business.\n\nOn the eve of the inaugural round of the Autobytel Lotus Championship race series at Brands Hatch, Lotus thrilled the crowds by unveiling the new Exige. Styled on the Sport Elise racer, the Exige was an exhilarating yet well mannered road car, with the soul of a track car.\n\nIn response to enthusiasts demand for even more performance Lotus responded with the introduction of the Sport 160. An awesome performer that makes a big impression with the track day crowd.\n\nHowever, by far the most significant event of the year was the launch of the new generation Elise with improved performance, styling, handling and quality.\n\nThe car was immediately labeled by the press ‘The best just got better’, and enforced Lotus’ position at the forefront of vehicle design technology.\n\nThe new bespoke Research and Development Centre at Hethel opened in July, and Lotus Design was the first department to move in.\n\nThe first 340R’s are delivered to customers.\n\nLotus, famous for taking things to extremes, provided support to Coventry University design student, Ted Mannerfelt. Ted’s Extreme concept design study complemented the Lotus design ethos – it was light, quick, innovative, agile, and was influenced by the worlds of aerospace, motorbikes and powerboats. The Extreme had two powerplants – a 100bhp 700cc motorbike engine running on natural gas, and a 20bhp electric motor – producing 0-60mph in 5.0secs, and yet returned 110mpg.\n\n2001 Engineering operations in Malaysia\n\nThe first year of the new millennium saw Lotus building more cars than ever before in its 53 year history and soon after being voted ‘Britain’s Best Driver’s Car’ by Autocar Magazine.\n\nLotus announced its new Engineering Operations Centre in Technology Park Malaysia (TPM) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The favourable and fast moving ASEAN economy had prompted Lotus to develop a greater presence in this region and in particular in Malaysia.
