Cool car and I am actually going to stop by today and check it out (never seen a classic GP car in person).My question is about the name of the car. Why 18/21?

If you mean the formula 1 REcord Book by John Thompson, it says they have Laystall gearboxes. I hadn't thought to look there. I wonder how reliable their information is and what their source was.\n\nThompson's book is excellent - the F1 Register were incredibly meticulous in those days. The pity is that when the Black Books caught up to the same period they actually managed to introduce errors by correcting things like the LDS and the Cooper T53 \"VR\".\n\nOriginally posted by Doug Nye\n\nLotus 18/21s ranged in spec according to the owner's ambitions and budget. Basically we adopted that classification for what had been originally the coffin-bodied 1960 Type 18s uprated to wear Lotus 21-type more sleek and curvaceous body panels and with the rear suspension converted to feature lateral top link location of taller hub carriers, while the half-shafts were given plunge capability so they could alter their length as they moved through the arc between bump and rebound, unlike the Type 18 half-shaft which was fixed-length and doubled-up as the hub carrier's top lateral locator. All clear??? Nice to hear of another Phoenix rising from the ashes...by the way.... ....oh dearie me...\n\nDCN\n\nAnd then in post 11 Peter Morley added\n\nBasically there were two types of 18/21\n\nFirst were 18s that were converted to 18/21 spec - this involved modifying the corners of the bulkheads, and adding the top link for the rear suspension and fitting the 21 style body.\n\nThen there were 18/21s that were built as such from the start (all by Parnell I believe), that was the case with 918 for example.\n\nThe engine cover on 918 does look like an 18/21 one since it is an 18/21 engine cover, Alan took moulds from the original body and they are what are used on all the 18/21s that are running.\n\nAll the 18/21 bodywork was made by UDT Laystall, when Team Lotus ran 18/21s they even used UDT bodywork, as did Rob Walker's one.\n\nNot an official designation but a convenient shorthand.\n\nGrant-Braham has the story that Innes' intended car had been \"destroyed in the Nurburgring fire and as Moss had a chance of taking the championship for Lotus he was chivalrously offered the newer Team Lotus 21 as a replacement. In effect the drivers swapped steeds...\"\n\nOriginally posted by Macca\n\nDid the 900-series chassis numbers and the 370-series chassis numbers (plus the Parnell-built 'P' cars) encompass all the 18s that were built for F1 and F2 in 1960-61?\n\nWhat was the chassis number series for the FJ cars? Was there a difference between the number series of the 'Team' cars as used by Clark/Taylor and the production cars that were presumably made by Arch Motors?\n\nPaul M"
