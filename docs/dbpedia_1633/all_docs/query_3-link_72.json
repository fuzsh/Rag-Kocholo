        "text": "The Exige Sport 390 Final Edition has been launched to celebrate the Exige’s final year of production. First launched in 2000, the Exige has become the genre-defining definition of a race car for the road.\n\nAs standard, it features the most extensive list of interior and exterior features ever. The biggest upgrade is the all-new TFT digital dashboard with the choice of two screens, one with a conventional set of dials and the other a race car-style with digital speed read-out and an engine speed bar.\n\nThe steering wheel is of a new design and clad in leather and alcantara. It features a flat base to create better leg clearance for taller drivers and to aid ingress and egress. Every car comes with a Final Edition build plaque, plus new seat trim and stitch patterns.\n\nA new selection of colours has been introduced for the Exige Sport 390, harking back to some of the iconic colour schemes from Lotus’ past. They are split into two; Select, which includes Daytona Blue, Fire Red, Metallic Orange and Motorsport Black; and Hertitage, which includes Racing Green, Nightfall Blue, Essex Blue and Calypso Red.\n\nIt is powered by a 3.5-litre supercharged V6, with a baffled sump, mounted in a lightweight and rigid chassis that provides thrilling acceleration and instant response. Pure unassisted steering offers exquisite feedback and vivid communication at all speeds. The car benefits from its own, bespoke version of Lotus’ pioneering, bonded aluminium chassis, a unique rear subframe and forged aluminium double wishbone suspension at the rear.\n\nThe new Exige Sport 390 replaces the outgoing Exige Sport 350. The power increase of 47bhp comes from a revised calibration linked to the Edelbrock supercharger with chargecooling, to produce 397bhp and 420Nm. It accelerates to 60mph in just 3.7 seconds before reaching a top speed of 172mph.\n\nThe advanced aerodynamics are carefully balanced, generating 70kg of downforce at the rear and 45kg up front for a total of 115kg at top speed. To put this power on to the road, the Exige Sport 390 has 10-spoke silver lightweight forged alloy wheels (7.5J x 17” front and 10J x 18” rear) and Michelin PS4 tyres (205/45 ZR17 front and 265/35 ZR18 rear)."
