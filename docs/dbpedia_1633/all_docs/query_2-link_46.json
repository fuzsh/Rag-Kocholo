        "text": "Description:\n\nGiuseppe Faranda owned Squadra Trinacria and built the Faranda FJ in 1959. The car raced in Italy the following year until Faranda sadly was killed when competing in a De Sanctis. After his death the family locked the Squadraâ€™s cars away until 1974 when a family friend purchased and sold the collection, including this stunning car.\n\nThe Faranda has a superleggera type chassis which is independently sprung. At the front a transverse tube is fitted to the lower part of the chassis. It contains internal coil springs operated by push rods on the bottom wishbones. At the rear the suspension uses a transverse leaf spring and twin radius rods. The aluminium body is by Filacchione of Rome and the car is powered by a Fiat 1100cc wet sump engine.\n\nSince acquiring the car the owner has spent a considerable time on development with specially valved shock absorbers and properly set up suspension. In 2021 the car was fitted with a new Setford Racing Engine, the gearbox was fully rebuilt with close ratios and a new inlet and exhaust system with open pipe and silenced configurations fitted.\n\nThe engine has recently been fully rebuilt by Setford Racing and has only run at Goodwood following rolling road testing immediately prior to the Members Meeting. Over last winter the car was completely rewired and fitted with a new fuel pump, coil, rev counter, oil pressure gauge and fire extinguisher. Seat belts are in date and the Borrani wheels have just been fully refurbished at considerable expense. The car was fitted with new Dunlop Tyres for the Goodwood Members Meeting, and has not been used since.\n\nThe Faranda won class A (5th overall) in the 2022 Lurani Championship and has current FIA Papers which expire at the end of December 2026. It is offered for sale with a large spares package including the original engine and gearbox, the original exhaust system and inlet manifolds, drive shafts and output shafts, and original mechanical rev counter, cable and gearbox. Also a large file incorporating period and recent history and invoices for work carried out since purchase.\n\nPreviously invited to many prestigious events including Monaco, Vernasca Silver Flag, Goodwood Revival and Members Meetings and the Solitude Revival. A rare and very attractive front-engined Junior.\n\nWebsite:\n\nhttps://adamsykes.co.uk/cars-for-sale/competition-cars/1959-faranda-formula-junior/\n\nVideo:\n\nKeyword Search Terms:\n\nFormula Junior, front-engined, Goodwood, Setford"
