        "text": "KEE@FSWMAG.COM\n\nAMY MASTURA, 40, IS ONE OF MALAYSIA'S MOST FAMOUS AND RESPECTED FACES AND HER MUSIC CUTS ACROSS ALL LEVELS OF SOCIETY AND RACIAL BARRIERS. LITTLE WONDER THEN THIS ADORABLE SONGBIRD AND ACTRESS WAS CHOSEN BY KOSE, ONE OF JAPAN'S TOP COSMETICS AND SKINCARE BRANDS, TO BE ITS AMBASSADOR LAST MARCH 2011.\n\nAmy Mastura at the launch of Kose's Infinity collection. Both are 40 years old!\n\nKose's Infinity series is taking the world by storm!\n\nAfter participating in Asia Bagus song contest in Japan in 1993, she released her debut album in the same year and there was no turning back!\n\nFame and fortune came fast as a mere two years later, she won Most Popular Female Actress award! Her albums 'Amy Mastura' and 'Pujaanku' went Double Platinum while 'Puteri' went Platinum. She was also chosen to duet with American pop idol Tommy Page. Her acting career also went great guns, with 'Kuala Lumpur Universiti' in 1995 and 'Trajedi Oktober' two years later which was a big hit and established her as a Sweet Young Thing any guy would love to bring home to see mother.\n\nIn 1998 she starred in 'Puteri Impian' which reinforced her image as lovable girl next door the same way some Indian stars are literally idolised after acting as gods in Hindu movies!\n\nIn March last year, Kose picked her to be its ambassador, the first time a Malay woman was selected as Kose is popular among Chinese. But Amy Mastura looks a bit chinky sometimes! Anyway, she looks gorgeous for her age and she will be 41 this May 2012 and her complexion is still dewy soft and radiant, doubtless from daily usage of Kose.\n\nAmy Mastura launched the 'Forever Radiant, Forever Young' campaign to celebrate Kose's 40th anniversary which was perfect as both ambassador and brand are the same age! How cool and auspicious is that? Of course I am younger but I won't hold that against Amy Mastura and I promise never to call her an old bag but she doesn't look it so she has nothing to fear.\n\nThe star of the show (apart from Amy herself) is the Infinity range which uses alpine plants like edelweiss and kokeiten which grow in severe conditions with high winds, drastic temperature changes, intense ultra violet rays and low oxygen---exactly the climate that will dehydrate, diminish and destroy my complexion! These plants not only survive but thrive! Hence they must possess certain qualities stored in their flowers, leaves and stems! All these goodies plus a Chinese plant cnidium officinale combine to release protective enzymes to insulate skin exposed to violent conditions found at 5,000 metres in the Swiss Alps and Himalayan plateaus!\n\nAmy Mastura looking good at 40\n\nAmy Mastura being quizzed by handsome emcee\n\nThe party venue at MidValley\n\nTakanobu Shimbo, Managing Director of Kose Malaysia and Amy Mastura signing the deal\n\nA floral bouquet to seal the deal\n\nHolding court\n\n\"These are the secrets to my youthful skin\"\n\nAmy with Infinity\n\nTakanobu Shimbo knew his Infinity is in good hands\n\nBoth concurred\n\nJust so you know how Kose counters look like\n\nThe Infinity range works wonders!\n\nFabulous at forty\n\nOne for the road\n\nInterview with the media\n\nHERE ARE THE DETAILS; INFINITY CLEAR FORCE 200mL\n\nRetail : RM160\n\nA mild alkaline wipe off beauty serum to wipe off old cornified layer that causes skin dullness and roughness.

It grows in a severe environment where the altitude is 3,500 to 5,000 meters so that air is extremely dry and oxygen is thin and where UV-ray is intense and temperature difference is extreme. In order to adapt to such environment, Kokeiten stores various active components within itself.\n\noAntioxidant action\n\noCellular activator action\n\noEffect to prompt fibroblast cells and renew dermal base\n\noEffect to prevent degeneration of protein which would cause changes in skin colors\n\noEffect to prevent degeneration of oxytalan fiber which would cause loss of skin resilience\n\n\"Edelweiss extract\",\n\na rare and unique component which inhibits carbonylation of cornified layer\n\nEdelweiss is an alpine plant that grows naturally in chalk grass fields of Swiss Alps at 1,500 to 3,400 altitudes. It possesses a system to withstand intense UV-ray, extreme difference in temperatures and humidity.\n\nIt prevents dryness which causes various skin troubles and \"carbonylation (oxydation) of cornified layer\" which is an underlying cause of dryness, and conditions bare skin to become moisture-rich with the feel of newly-born cells in cornified layer.\n\nIt also enhances ability of cornified layer to embrace moisture, which gives additional softness and resilience to the skin. It further maintains normal barrier functions and keeps skin at the best condition for a long time.\n\n\"Cnidium Officinale Water\"\n\nwhich enhances skin circulation\n\nCnidium Officinale is an apiaceous-family plant listed in the \"Materia Medica of Deity of Agriculture\", and has been used through the ages as a traditional Chinese medicine with high medicinal effects.

It was a popular success for its creamy texture that was not sticky, and a reputation that a simple massage would result a beautiful skin made it a big hit.

It was discovered by the Japanese in 1907. After that, its whitening effects were researched, and in 1988, it was recognized as an active whitening ingredient. Kojic acid that is extensively purified with the use of biotechnology is said to have permeability that excels in comparison to other whitening ingredients.\n\nKokeiten (kokeiten root) extract [moisturizer]\n\nEdelweiss extracts [moisturizer]\n\nCnidium Officinale water [moisturizer]\n\nCLARIFY\n\nREPLENISH\n\nNURTURE\n\nREVITALIZE\n\nDaily Basic Care\n\nSupport Basic Care\n\nSpecial Care\n\nCleansing・Wash -->\n\nLotion --> Emulsion\n\nCream\n\n■ Mask\n\n■ Serum\n\n■ Eye Cream\n\nOil Cleansing Cream N Tone Up Wash\n\n■ Lotion Concentrate 14 I/ II\n\n■ Serum Completion I/ II\n\nCream Excellent\n\n■ Vital Comfort Mask\n\n■ Realizing White XX\n\n■ Eye Cream\n\nCLARIFY\n\nREPLENISH\n\nNURTURE\n\nREVITALIZE\n\nDaily Basic Care\n\nSupport Basic Care\n\nSpecial Care\n\nWash -->\n\nLotion --> Emulsion\n\nCream\n\n■ Serum\n\n■ Eye Cream\n\nTone Up Wash\n\n■ Lotion Concentrate 14 I/ II\n\n■ Serum Completion I/ II\n\nCream Excellent\n\n■ Realizing White XX\n\n■ Eye Cream"
