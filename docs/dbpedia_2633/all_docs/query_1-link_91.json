        "text": "There’s something about Tommy Page’s music, that never leaves anybody unmoved. Would it be his virtuoso pianist abilities? His tender slightly broken voice, as soft as silk sheets ? Or his musical arrangements, epitome of the early 90s, which like wine, has become better with the years. Probably a little of each, with mainly words full of emotions.\n\nHe was born in 1970 in a sweet little residential borough of New Jersey. There was nothing about this black-haired guy who predestined him to become an international popstar. Nothing except his talent and powerful ambition. A strong willingness that gave him at a young age, the bravery to give his demo to influential productors.\n\nA Zillion Kisses\n\nSeduced by his gifted voice and his charisma, Tommy quickly signed in a music label, allowing the release of his eponym first album in 1988. Lead by “A Zillion Kisses” , a freestyle dance-pop, first single, with a strong bass line, a significant use of the synth specific of this era. Even though the song received a huge radio airplay and clubs, unfortunately the song failed in the HOT 100 charts, but the music video remained iconic due its strong sexual appeal, showing a very sexy Tommy. In 1988, except Madonna, there were no explicitly sexualised teen idols especially among male singers.\n\nA shoulder to cry on\n\nThe other single of his debut album was “Turning Me On”. The true revelation was “A Shoulder to Cry On” who charted 29 in the Billboard Hot 100, and became number 1 in the majority of Asian countries. A runaway success for a quintessential song of Tommy’s musical universe, introducing, a fineness of piano execution, a absolute musical phrasing expressing by a perfect rhythm management. In sum, a maven pianist with a wonderful voice, and most of all with class since he wore a suit and tie, unlike the others slovenly idols. Tommy’s songs wasn’t just only pretty tunes, it was a true lifestyle concept. A real ode to European romanticism, a sense of play influenced by Berlioz, Chopin and Schumann. Beautiful lyrics carrying the essence of eastern European poets as Sergei Yesenin and Krzysztof Kamil Baczyński. It was like if Franz Liszt was making pop music, and it’s probably the reason of Tommy’s success among the asian well-known classical music audience.\n\nI’ll be your everything\n\nIn 1990, Tommy was a superstar in Asia, but not A-list singer in America. Jordan Knight gave him a nice gift, after having wrote “I’ll be your Everything“, he offered him to record it, with the New Kids On the Block as choristers. A helping hand considering the fact, at that time NKOTB were the best selling artists of the music industry. A powerful ballad, lying between smooth jazz and traditional pop and doo-wop influenced, a reminiscence of the Platters classics. The arrangements are perfects, with background saxophone and cello. The album climbed up to the top of the American charts, becoming a number 1 hit. This made Tommy a national phenomenon that appeared on magazine covers, TV special and even as guest star in the hit show “Full House”.\n\nWhen I dream of You\n\nIn view of the success he gained, the expectations were high for his new single. Tommy shot the video of “When I dream of You” in Paris (France) the European city of jazz and of the lovers. If the song was a moderate hit, it’s notable for his first mix between smooth jazz, teen pop and freestyle.\n\n“I’ll be your everything” and “When I dream of you” were the most remembered songs of his third album. However “Painting in my Minds“, “I Break Down“, “Just Before (I was gonna Say I love you)” became with time huge classics among his fans, surpassing “I’ll be your everything”.\n\nUnder the rainbow\n\nIn early 90s, American musical landscape was in transformation. Freestyle music began to disappear, swept by grunge music and the beginnings of Britpop. Nirvana was at its apogee with “Smells like teen spirit” with the complicity of MTV. For some teenagers Tommy was too much sanitized, and didn’t have the spirit of the early 90’s youth. Sadly, his fourth album “From the heart” unfairly flopped in the American charts. Even so some songs deserve all our respect: “Under the rainbow“, “Whenever you close your eyes“, two testimonies of freestyle beats, as well as the loveliest ballad “Madly in love“, “I still believe you and me“.\n\nThe Best Part\n\nIn the mid 90s. Tommy did three wonderful duets. The first one “Close our eyes” with the American 80s popstar Tiffany, who featured in a Japanese edition of her best of. The second with the Malaysian singer Amy Mastura, called “The Best Part“. And the third one,”I’m always dreaming of you“, was with the lovely Sally Yeh a singer from Honk Kong showing that his talent has no boundaries.\n\nHeaven in Your Eyes\n\nWe will always remember Tommy’s music, because he was unique in the musical landscape of the late 80s. The guy has recorded a beautiful classic “Heaven in your eyes“, and dusts off some songs like “Wouldn’t it be good” of Nik Kershaw and “Missing You” of John Waite.\n\nItunes"
