Her career began at a young age when she made her acting debut in a Playtex commercial at just three months old, marking the start of a lifelong journey in show business. Applegate's breakthrough came in 1987 when she landed the role of Kelly Bundy on Married with Children, a character she portrayed for ten seasons until the show's end in 1997. This role garnered her widespread recognition and acclaim, establishing her as a household name in the television industry. Her success on the small screen led to opportunities in film, where she excelled in both comedic and dramatic roles. Some of her notable film performances include The Sweetest Thing, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, and its sequel Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues. Away from the screen, Applegate faced a personal battle with breast cancer, which she publicly announced in 2008. After undergoing a double mastectomy, she became an outspoken advocate for cancer awareness and early detection. She also founded the Right Action for Women foundation, aimed at assisting at-risk women who may not have the means to cover the cost of advanced screenings for breast cancer. Christina Applegate's journey, both professionally and personally, has left an indelible mark on Hollywood, showcasing her resilience and talent in equal measure.\n\nBrooke Burke Charvet, an icon in the entertainment industry, has fashioned an impressive career spanning over three decades.

She's also an entrepreneur who co-founded ModernMom.com, a go-to resource for mothers seeking advice on various topics.

Born on September 16, 1971, in Newton, Massachusetts, Poehler's journey towards stardom began at Boston College where she developed her comedic skills as a member of the improv troupe My Mother's Fleabag. Following this early spark of talent, she moved to Chicago to join the illustrious Second City Theatre, known for its production of top-notch comedians. Poehler's career took a significant leap when she co-founded the Upright Citizens Brigade, an improvisational and sketch comedy group that started in Chicago but later found fame in New York City. The group's success led to a self-titled show on Comedy Central, catapulting Poehler into the limelight. However, it was her stint on NBC's iconic late-night comedy show, Saturday Night Live (SNL), from 2001 to 2008, that truly solidified her place in the comedy world.

His breakout role came in Steven Spielberg's iconic film Gremlins (1984), where he played Pete Fountaine. However, it was his performances in quintessential 80s films such as The Goonies (1985) and Stand By Me (1986) that catapulted him into stardom and established him as a talented child actor.
