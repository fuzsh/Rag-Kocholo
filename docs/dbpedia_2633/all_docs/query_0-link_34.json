        "text": "Tracing the origin of Geodynamics: The Alfred Wegener Memorial Expedition 2014\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStÃ¼we, Kurt\n\n2015-04-01\n\n2012 marked the 100st anniversary of the seminal publications on Continental Drift Theory by Alfred Wegener. These publications (and Wegener's book \"On the origin of the continents\", published three years later) are widely accepted to be the fundamental breakthrough that opened the path to the Theory of Plate Tectoncis and ultimately the path to modern Geodynamics some 50 years later. In the same historic year of the 1912 publications, Alfred Wegener set off for what was to become the most dramatic of his three Greenland expeditions. On this expedition Wegener and Koch crossed the entire northern icecap of Greenland. In honour of the hundreds anniversary of Wegener's publications, the Austrian Academy of Sciences funded an expedition to trace the footsteps of the 1912 expedition in the spirit of Alfred Wegener, while also conducting modern Earth Science. This expedition that was conducted in summer 2014. For the expedition, a 1952 Cessna180 was acquired in Alaska, adapted with bush wheels, wing extensions and extra tanks and was flown by the author and one of the worlds most renown bush pilots from Alaska in a 10 day effort to Greenland. There, the entire NE Greenland Caledonides were covered and photographed. Field work for a masters projects was conducted and samples were collected from a series of some of the most remote locations in the Caledonides ever visited. Most spectacularly, the original sled of Wegeners 1912 expedition was found some 30 kilometers from its expected location in the Dove Bugt Region of northeastern Greenland.\n\nStrawberry gums: a clinicopathological manifestation diagnostic of Wegener's granulomatosis?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNapier, S S; Allen, J A; Irwin, C R; McCluskey, D R\n\n1993-01-01\n\nAIMS--To highlight an uncommon but characteristic gingival lesion associated with Wegener's granulomatosis, emphasising the presence of pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, microabscesses, and multinucleate giant cells; and the paucity of the currently accepted histopathological criteria of Wegener's granulomatosis--namely necrosis, vasculitis, and granulomata. METHODS--The histopathological features of a gingival biopsy specimen from a case of Wegener's granulomatosis limited to the upper aerodigestive tract in a 36 year old woman were compared with those of 14 similar reported cases. RESULTS--Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, microabscesses, and multinucleate giant cells were recorded as present in almost all cases of gingival Wegener's granulomatosis. Necrosis, vasculitis, and granuloma formation were present in only a few cases. CONCLUSIONS--The combination of pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, microabscesses, and multinucleate giant cells in a gingival biopsy specimen from erythematous, swollen gums, clinically resembling over-ripe strawberries, in a patient with a severe systemic upset, is so typical of Wegener's granulomatosis as to be virtually diagnostic. Recognition of this characteristic lesion may aid early diagnosis and treatment in cases where other diagnostic variables are absent.

WegenerNet includes 153 ground level weather stations in an area of about 15 km Ã 20 km in the Feldbach region in southeast Austria. Rainfall has been measured by tipping bucket gauges at 150 stations of the network since the beginning of 2007. Since rain gauge measurements are considered close to true rainfall, there are increasing needs for WegenerNet data for the validation of rainfall data products such as remote sensing based estimates or model outputs. Serving these needs, this paper aims at providing a clearer interpretation on WegenerNet rainfall data for users in hydro-meteorological communities. Five clusters - a cluster consists of one national weather station and its four closest WegenerNet stations - allowed us close comparison of datasets between the stations. Linear regression analysis and error estimation with statistical indices were conducted to quantitatively evaluate the WegenerNet daily rainfall data. It was found that rainfall data between the stations show good linear relationships with an average correlation coefficient (r) of 0.97 , while WegenerNet sensors tend to underestimate rainfall according to the regression slope (0.87). For the five clusters investigated, the bias and relative bias were - 0.97 mm d-1 and - 11.5 % on average (except data from new sensors). The average of bias and relative bias, however, could be reduced by about 80 % through a simple linear regression-slope correction, with the assumption that the underestimation in WegenerNet data was caused by systematic errors. The results from the study have been employed to improve WegenerNet data for user applications so that a new version of the data (v5) is now available at the WegenerNet data portal (www.wegenernet.org).\n\nAlfred of Wessex at a Cross-Roads in the History of Education\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nNelson, Janet L.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis paper first situates King Alfred in Winchester, in Wessex, in Anglo-Saxon England, and in the Christendom of the ninth century.

Alfred Benzon].\n\nPubMed\n\nGrevsen, JÃ¸rgen V; Kirkegaard, Hanne; Kruse, Edith; Kruse, Poul R\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe article series provides a written and pictorial account of the Danish pharmaceutical industry's products from their introduction until about 1950. Part 3 deals with products from the company founded by Alfred Benzon in 1849. Alfred Nicolai Benzon owned the Swan Pharmacy in Copenhagen. In 1863 he started an independent company manufacturing branded pharmaceuticals, thus combining the pharmacy's activities with the wholesale business. The family owned the company until 1952, when it was converted into a foundation. After several restructuring rounds, the medicine production business continued as Benzon Pharma A/S until 1990, when Nycomed Pharma A/S bought up all the branded pharmaceuticals. As the first pharmaceutical company in Denmark, Alfred Benzon was an industrial frontrunner in the country at the time, supplying not only the domestic market but foreign markets as well. Alfred Benzon was the first Danish company to produce ether for anesthesia, and malt extract, a dietetic preparation. The high quality of both products made them valuable export articles. In the early 1890s, Alfred Benzon became the first Danish company to start the research-based production of extract of thyroid glands from slaughtered cattle. This was the beginning of a long-standing specialization in producing organotherapeutic substances from animal organs originating from Danish animal husbandry. In 1932 the company had 26 preparations of this type in its range, many of them on the market for several years. These medicine substances included iron preparations and effervescent salts followed by sulfonamides, synthetic hormones and a substance to counteract motion sickness.\n\nAlfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913): evolution and medicine.\n\nPubMed\n\nO'Connell, Henry P\n\n2009-11-01\n\nThe theory we now know simply as 'evolution' was first presented to the scientific world one and a half centuries ago, on 1 July 1858, when the work of two men, Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Robert Darwin (1809-82), was jointly read at the Linnean Society. While Charles Darwin has rightly taken his place in history as one of the greatest scientists of all time, Alfred Russel Wallace has been largely forgotten outside of the scientific community. However, Wallace was a prolific researcher and writer with interests in a wide range of topics, from medicine to economics.\n\n[Subglottic stenosis as the initial manifestation of Wegener's granulomatosis in a teenager. Case report].\n\nPubMed\n\nCuestas, Giselle; RodrÃ­guez, VerÃ³nica; Doormann, Flavia; Pringe, Alejandra; Bellia MunzÃ³n, Patricio; Bellia MunzÃ³n, GastÃ³n; Ortega, Carlos; Ãlvarez, RubÃ©n\n\n2017-04-01\n\nWegener's granulomatosis is a necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis of autoimmune origin that primarily affects the upper and lower airways and kidneys. It is very rare in children and adolescents. When started at a young age it is often associated with subglottic stenosis. Subglottic stenosis is a potentially fatal manifestation of Wegener's granulomatosis. Its diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion since it might develop in the absence of other signs of activity. Occasionally, subglottic stenosis may present as the initial manifestation of the disease. Diagnosis is confirmed by endoscopic visualization of the lesion. The treatment is complex, and it often requires repeated interventions due to restenosis. We present a 13-year-old patient with subglottic stenosis secondary to Wegener's granulomatosis. We describe the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of this rare cause of respiratory distress in the pediatric population.

The institution was funded initially by Matthew Gregson (1800-76) and later by public subscription. Opened in 1851, it was the second Children's Hospital in England. Alfred Stephens was a general practitioner without higher qualifications. In due course he perceived that the free treatment of children at the Infirmary affected his income and he redirected patients to his practice. This led to confrontation with his colleagues and the Board of the Infirmary, and good relations were never restored. His name has not been commemorated nor his charitable work remembered.\n\nPrince Alfred College 1993 Study Tour to China.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKennedy, Marten; Lake, Simon\n\n1994-01-01\n\nDiscusses a trip to China by students of Mandarin Chinese at Prince Alfred College, Australia, in order to learn about the language and culture of the host country.

The WegenerNet network comprises 151 ground level weather stations in an area of 15 km Ã 20 km in south-eastern Austria (Feldbach region, Ë46.93Â° N, Ë15.90Â° E) designed to serve as a long-term monitoring and validation facility for weather and climate research and applications. While the IMERG provides rainfall estimations every half hour at 0.1Â° resolution, the WegenerNet network measures rainfall every 5 minutes at around 2 km2 resolution and produces 200 m Ã 200 m gridded datasets. The study was conducted on the domain of the WegenerNet network; eight IMERG grids are overlapped with the network, two of which are entirely covered by the WegenerNet (40 and 39 stations in each grid). We investigated data from April to September of the years 2014 to 2015; the date of first two years after the launch of the GPM Core Observatory. Since the network has a flexibility to work with various spatial and temporal scales, the comparison could be conducted on average-points to pixel basis at both sub-daily and daily timescales. This presentation will summarize the first results of the comparison and future plans to explore the characteristics of errors in the IMERG datasets.\n\nAlfred nobel.\n\nPubMed\n\nHolmin, L R\n\n1996-10-01\n\nAlfred Nobel never spoke publicly about his problems of ill health, but a detailed, subjective record has recently been published in the form of 216 letters written to his mistress during an 18-year period. His descriptions of constant pain, debilitating migraine, and \"paralyzing\" fatigue permit a hypothesis that he might have had a long struggle with fibromyalgia. This does not preclude his having suffered other illnesses as well. He thought he had heart disease, which his physicians denied until his final years, when he was diagnosed with angina pectoris. He died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1896 at the age of 63. His letters describe a 30-year search for diagnosis from the best physicians in Europe. He was ridiculed by many people as a hypochondriac, and he never received a diagnosis for \"the pain that will not go away.\" This may well have contributed to the bitterness and depression of his final years. Increasing worldwide interest and research in this elusive syndrome will hopefully prevent a repetition of the Nobel story of a century ago.\n\nEarthquakes and plate tectonics\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSpall, H.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nAn explanation is to be found in plate tectonics, a concept which has revolutionized thinking in the Earth sciences in the last 10 years. The theory of plate tectonics combines many of the ideas about continental drift (originally proposed in 1912 by Alfred Wegener in Germany) and sea-floor spreading (suggested originally by Harry Hess of Princeton University).Â\n\nThe expression of R genes in genetic and induced resistance to potato cyst nematode Globodera rostochiensis (Wollenweber, 1923) Behrens, 1975.\n\nPubMed\n\nLavrova, V V; Matveeva, E M; Zinovieva, S V\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe characteristics of expression of two genes, H1 and Gro1-4, which determine the resistance to the sedentary parasitic nematode Globodera rostochiensis (Wollenweber, 1923) Behrens, 1975, in the resistant (Krepysh) and susceptible (Nevskii) potato cultivars was studied under a short-term exposure to low temperatures. Such treatment of susceptible plants at the early stages of ontogeny led to the activation of expression of H1 and Gro1-4 genes in roots and the H1 gene in leaves. The transcriptional activity of R genes was detected not only in roots but also in leaves (i.e., in tissue remote from the site of direct injury by the nematode) in the case of both genetic and induced resistance, indicating the development of a systemic defense response of plants to infection.\n\n[The case of Wegener's granulomatosis of the nose, larynx and ear].\n\nPubMed\n\nWojciechowski, I; Piotrowski, S; Zaniewska-Kulesza, I; Komorowska, E\n\n2001-01-01\n\nWe have described a rare case of Wegener's granulomatosis in our 41-year old patient, located in the nose, larynx and ear. The disease usually presents as a triad of respiratory, vascular and kidney location. It may occur as a rapid or indolent progress. We have shown in our paper diagnostic difficulties connected with this disease. The biopsies of involved organs and blood tests are the best steps of establish proper diagnosis. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are typical markers of Wegeners's granulomatosis. The conservative therapy including immunosuppression and surgical treatment (laserotherapy) are main methods of management. Our patient was given antibiotic therapy, and immunosuppressive therapy. Her condition improved during the first hospitalisation. Remission lasted very short, and she was admitted to the hospital again and underwent intensive investigations and therapy. We observed dyspnea caused by subglottic stenosis. The histologic examination of the tracheal mucosa showed granulomatous inflammation. After intensive therapy our patient felt better. She has been in our records till now, we observe no progress of disease. Finally, we would like to pay attention to the fact, that early diagnosis is important to prevent complications such subglottic stenosis which can lead to death.\n\n[Spontaneous hemothorax revealing Wegener's vasculitis in a pregnant woman].\n\nPubMed\n\nSerhane, Hind; Yassine, Msougar; Amro, Lamyae\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSpontaneous hemothorax is a rare condition. Its causes are multiple but sometimes they remain unknown. In some patients, thoracotomy may be the only means to determine hemothorax origin. Vasculitis have not been reported as a common cause of spontaneous hemothorax. Pregnancy does not appear to have causal or aggravating effect on spontaneous hemothorax or on vasculitis. We here report the peculiar case of a young patient presenting during pregnancy with spontaneous hemothorax secondary to Wegener's vasculitis. The latter was diagnosed by pleural biopsy performed during exploratory thoracotomy and confirmed by ANCA assays.\n\nAmerican Pestalozzianism Revisited: Alfred Holbrook and the Origins of Object-Based Pedagogy in 19th Century America\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMyers, Nathan R.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study is to explore the significance of 19th century American educator Alfred Holbrook through his writings and administration of the Lebanon, Ohio based National Normal University.

With its stations about every 2 km2, each with 5-min time sampling, the network provides regular measurements since January 2007. Detailed information is available in the recent description by Kirchengast et al. (2014) and via www.wegcenter.at/wegenernet. As a smaller \"sister network\" of the WegenerNet Feldbach region, the WegenerNet Johnsbachtal consists of eleven meteorological stations (complemented by one hydrographic station at the Johnsbach creek), measuring temperature, humidity, precipitation, radiation, wind, and other parameters in an alpine setting at altitudes ranging from below 700 m to over 2100 m. Data are available partly since 2007, partly since more recent dates and have a temporal resolution of 10 minutes. The networks are set to serve as a long-term monitoring and validation facility for weather and climate research and applications. Uses include validation of nonhydrostatic models operated at 1-km-scale resolution and of statistical downscaling techniques (in particular for precipitation), validation of radar and satellite data, study of orography-climate relationships, and many others. Quality-controlled station time series and gridded field data (spacing 200 m Ã 200 m) are available in near-real time (data latency less than 1-2 h) for visualization and download via a data portal (www.wegenernet.org). This data portal has been undergoing a complete renewal over the last year, and now serves as a modern gateway to the WegenerNet's more than 10 years of high\n\n[Science and the scientist: opposing vues on Alfred Granadidier's explorations].\n\nPubMed\n\nMonnier, Jehanne-Emmanuelle\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis article embraces the different ways a scientist traveller and his fieldworks can be perceived through the case of Alfred Grandidier in South America, in India and in Madagascar (1857-1870). Our aim is to deal with various aspects of historical scientific exploration and to draw a picture of the erudite traveller by crossing various and complementary points of view. Scientific works can be received very differently, depending on the place and the nature of the addresses, whether they are authorities wishing to take advantage of it, native people fearing for their safety or disciples glorifying their idol. The concept of science itself and the status of the scientist raise the question of mutual understanding between the explorer and his contemporaries, in Paris or in a remote place. Alfred Grandidier's example is particularly relevant to reveal different visions of scientist traveller as promoted in the 19th century, as well as the various perceptions that a scientific work can have depending on the public it impacts.\n\n[The first clinical description of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (known before as Wegener's granulomatosis)].\n\nPubMed\n\nMercado, Ulises\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBefore 1950, cases of necrotizing vasculitis were commonly published in journals of pathology. Most of these cases were designated as polyarteritis nodosa. In 1952, the pathologist Pearl Zeek critically reviewed and summarized the literature dealing with polyarteritis nodosa and first grouped the different types of necrotizing vasculitis. But she omitted some types of not well-characterized vasculitis, among them granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis).\n\nWegener's granulomatosis occurring de novo during pregnancy.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlfhaily, F; Watts, R; Leather, A\n\n2009-01-01\n\nWegener's granulomatosis (WG) is rarely diagnosed during the reproductive years and uncommonly manifests for the first time during pregnancy. We report a case of de novo WG presenting at 30 weeks gestation with classical symptoms of WG (ENT, pulmonary). The diagnosis was confirmed by radiological, laboratory, and histological investigations. With a multidisciplinary approach, she had a successful vaginal delivery of a healthy baby. She was treated successfully by a combination of steroids, azathioprine and intravenous immunoglobulin in the active phase of disease for induction of remission and by azathioprine and steroids for maintenance of remission. The significant improvement in her symptoms allowed us to continue her pregnancy to 37 weeks when delivery was electively induced. Transplacental transmission of PR3-ANCA occurred but the neonate remained well. This case of de novo WG during pregnancy highlights the seriousness of this disease and the challenge in management of such patients.\n\nAn appreciation of Alfred Bauder\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMerkt, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Quack, Martin\n\n2001-12-01\n\nAlfred Bauder (or Fredi as his friends and family call him) was born on 10 May 1934 in Zurich, where he went to school. After obtaining his high school diploma in 1953, he studied chemistry and physics at the ETH Zurich department of natural sciences, which encouraged such interdisciplinary studies. He received his diploma in natural sciences with the highest distinction in 1957. Under the tutelage of Professor Hans H. GÃ¼nthard at the laboratory of Physical Chemistry at ETH ZÃ¼rich, he obtained his doctoral degree in 1961 with a thesis on the microwave spectrum, dipole moment and structure of cyclobutanone. This work was to set the tone for his future scientific career. After his habilitation in the field of microwave spectroscopy at ETH in 1966, he obtained the venia legendi as Private Docent for Physical Chemistry.\n\nThe color of complexes and UV-vis spectroscopy as an analytical tool of Alfred Werner's group at the University of Zurich.\n\nPubMed\n\nFox, Thomas; Berke, Heinz\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTwo PhD theses (Alexander Gordienko, 1912; Johannes Angerstein, 1914) and a dissertation in partial fulfillment of a PhD thesis (H. S. French, Zurich, 1914) are reviewed that deal with hitherto unpublished UV-vis spectroscopy work of coordination compounds in the group of Alfred Werner. The method of measurement of UV-vis spectra at Alfred Werner's time is described in detail. Examples of spectra of complexes are given, which were partly interpreted in terms of structure (cis â trans configuration, counting number of bands for structural relationships, and shift of general spectral features by consecutive replacement of ligands). A more complete interpretation of spectra was hampered at Alfred Werner's time by the lack of a light absorption theory and a correct theory of electron excitation, and the lack of a ligand field theory for coordination compounds. The experimentally difficult data acquisitions and the difficult spectral interpretations might have been reasons why this method did not experience a breakthrough in Alfred Werner's group to play a more prominent role as an important analytical method. Nevertheless the application of UV-vis spectroscopy on coordination compounds was unique and novel, and witnesses Alfred Werner's great aptitude and keenness to always try and go beyond conventional practice.\n\nConfessions of a serial entrepreneur: a conversation with Alfred E.

They must also have an understanding of the principles of research and are encouraged to participate in research projects. However, the constraints of time, a lack of formal training and rotation between different training posts create barriers to audit cycle completion and pursuing research. This leads to trainees being reluctant to undertake research, facilitates poor quality research and risks incomplete audit. The Welsh Geriatricians Network (WeGeN) has been created with the aims of facilitating collaborative, trainee-led research within Geriatric Medicine in Wales, promoting research engagement and improving the research evidence base for older patients. By coordinating collaborative research projects across different sites within Wales, trainees continue existing projects at new sites, allowing completion of projects and establishing the long-term infrastructure and experienced personnel needed for high-quality research data to be gathered. WeGeN has facilitated 4 national audits, all of which are intended for peer review publication. The first project considers the service provision for the older person in the emergency department, the second Parkinson's disease, the third reviews delirium management and the fourth project considers epidemiology of surgical disease in older people. The objective of this project is to further establish and develop WeGeN as a group which facilitates high-quality research and provides the opportunity for geriatric trainees to engage in research activity. It is anticipated that the establishment of this research platform will provide a blueprint for the development of other such networks in the UK and beyond.

Here, Wallace's appreciation of the role of final causes in evolution is linked to some of its probable origins, with an emphasis on the influence of Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859). The question is then asked whether a final causes-based scientific agenda might be possible, and answered by drawing attention to two current efforts in that direction by Adrian Bejan, and by the author. A sketch of the latter approach, adapted from Spinozian thinking, is given, with an empirical example involving drainage basin morphology that suggests structural influences of a final causes sort.\n\nThe Alfred Nobel rocket camera. An early aerial photography attempt\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIngemar Skoog, A.\n\n2010-02-01\n\nAlfred Nobel (1833-1896), mainly known for his invention of dynamite and the creation of the Nobel Prices, was an engineer and inventor active in many fields of science and engineering, e.g. chemistry, medicine, mechanics, metallurgy, optics, armoury and rocketry. Amongst his inventions in rocketry was the smokeless solid propellant ballistite (i.e. cordite) patented for the first time in 1887. As a very wealthy person he actively supported many Swedish inventors in their work. One of them was W.T. Unge, who was devoted to the development of rockets and their applications. Nobel and Unge had several rocket patents together and also jointly worked on various rocket applications. In mid-1896 Nobel applied for patents in England and France for \"An Improved Mode of Obtaining Photographic Maps and Earth or Ground Measurements\" using a photographic camera carried by a \"â¦balloon, rocket or missileâ¦\". During the remaining of 1896 the mechanical design of the camera mechanism was pursued and cameras manufactured. In April 1897 (after the death of Alfred Nobel) the first aerial photos were taken by these cameras. These photos might be the first documented aerial photos taken by a rocket borne camera. Cameras and photos from 1897 have been preserved. Nobel did not only develop the rocket borne camera but also proposed methods on how to use the photographs taken for ground measurements and preparing maps.\n\nWegenerNet climate station network region Feldbach/Austria: From local measurements to weather and climate data products at 1 km-scale resolution\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKabas, T.; Leuprecht, A.; Bichler, C.; Kirchengast, G.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nSouth-eastern Austria is characteristic for experiencing a rich variety of weather and climate patterns. For this reason, the county of Feldbach was selected by the Wegener Center as a focus area for a pioneering observation experiment at very high resolution: The WegenerNet climate station network (in brief WegenerNet) comprises 151 meteorological stations within an area of about 20 km Ã 15 km (~ 1.4 km Ã 1.4 km station grid). All stations measure the main parameters temperature, humidity and precipitation with 5 minute sampling. Selected further stations include measurements of wind speed and direction completed by soil parameters as well as air pressure and net radiation. The collected data is integrated in an automatic processing system including data transfer, quality control, product generation, and visualization. Each station is equipped with an internet-attached data logger and the measurements are transferred as binary files via GPRS to the WegenerNet server in 1 hour intervals. The incoming raw data files of measured parameters as well as several operating values of the data logger are stored in a relational database (PostgreSQL). Next, the raw data pass the Quality Control System (QCS) in which the data are checked for its technical and physical plausibility (e.g., sensor specifications, temporal and spatial variability). In consideration of the data quality (quality flag), the Data Product Generator (DPG) results in weather and climate data products on various temporal scales (from 5 min to annual) for single stations and regular grids. Gridded data are derived by vertical scaling and squared inverse distance interpolation (1 km Ã 1 km and 0.01Â° Ã 0.01Â° grids). Both subsystems (QCS and DPG) are realized by the programming language Python. For application purposes the resulting data products are available via the bi-lingual (dt, en) WegenerNet data portal (www.wegenernet.org). At this time, the main interface is still online in a system in which\n\nPreface to The Diary of Vaslav Nijinsky by Alfred Adler, MD.\n\nPubMed\n\nAnsbacher, H L\n\n1981-07-01\n\nThis is a previously unpublished work by Alfred Adler that was written in 1936 as a preface to The Diary of Vaslav Nijinsky.

Hertz died of Wegener's granulomatosis, 45 years before this disease had been explored. WEGENER'S GRANULOMATOSIS: The symptoms of the granulomatosis, that was first described by Friedrich Wegener in 1936 and 1939 are presented in short with literal quotations of the author: It begins with a refractory cold that will last until the end, then follow involvement of the paranasal sinuses, ears, mucous lining of mouth and pharynx, slight fever, weakness, in the final phase dissemination with nephritis, septic fever, arthritis, myalgia, paralyses leading to total immobility, exitus. The etiology is not fully understood but probably based on immunoreaction. H.

At that time, the renowned CLIMAP group used the stratigraphy available to reconstruct the glacial world by averaging paleothermometric data over a wide time window, ranging between at least 14,000 and 24,000 yr BP, over which period climate was assumed to be rather stable. Even if northern European pollen records showed several phases of vegetation shift, the exact duration and spatial coverage of these shifts was unknown and their climatic significance was not well-enough understood to be separated from other biological effects, such as plant migration following ice-sheet demise. Significant progress came from mass spectrometry developments applied to isotope geochronology in the mid- and late- 1980s. This allowed the precise analysis of radiocarbon on small samples such as foraminifera in marine sediments and enabled the measurement of U-Th ages for accurate dating of corals and speleothems. These technological improvements permitted meaningful comparisons between proxy records from the various archives originating from all latitudes and longitudes. Today, it is clear that the old LGM time window corresponds to a period of more than ten millennia during which there was significant climate variability, including a prominent cooling event at the beginning of the deglaciation. This cooling event is known as the 'Oldest Dryas' by palynologists, as 'Heinrich Event #1' (H1) by paleoceanographers, and has even been dubbed the 'Mystery Interval' by prominent authors as they puzzled while attempting to synthesize and interpret its records. The H1 drastic cooling, attributed to a pulse-like injection of ice and meltwater into the North Atlantic, was first evidenced in 1987 in sediments from the Iberian Margin. Three years later, significant improvements of the radiocarbon calibration demonstrated that about three millennia were missing from the deglaciation record. Accordingly, the LGM mean age was pushed from 18,000 to 21,000 yr BP, the midpoint of H1 was shifted from 13,500 to 16,000 yr BP, and the beginning of the Holocene was repositioned at about 11,500 yr BP. This new climate chronology was subsequently confirmed by counting 'cryovarves' within the GRIP and GISP2 Greenland ice cores. These studies have since been complemented by many other records from polar ice, marine and lacustrine sediments and cave speleothems. In addition to extending the chronology by three additional millennia, improvement also arose from the quality of the new geological archives. These archives have allowed studies at much higher resolution than was previously achieved in the framework of CLIMAP, which included many records based on deep-sea cores characterized by low sedimentation rate, and thus very susceptible to smoothing processes such as bioturbation. In addition, analytical geochemistry has only recently provided techniques adapted to the production of high-resolution time series of various proxies based on elemental ratios, on organic compounds or on stable and radiogenic isotopes. More than a dozen years after the H1 discovery, the same Iberian Margin sediments were used to show that H1 comprised at least two phases, H1a and H1b, based on ice rafted debris (IRD) and other proxies. It is now recognized that the entire H1 event (H1 sensu lato) is a three millennia-long period (ca. 17,500 to 14,500 yr BP). To illustrate the progress in this research field, I will review the key records that can be used to document the complex nature of this episode. The H1 (s.l.) included several phases of intense cooling, of precipitation changes - notably at low latitudes and in the Asian monsoon area, of retreat and decay of glacial ice-sheets - as evidenced in sediments collected in river mouths, and of sea-level rise as recorded in corals from Tahiti and Barbados. Various isotopic proxies of deep-sea ventilation have been used to identify variations during the H1 sub-phases of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC), indicating that ocean heat transport was involved in the observed climate fluctuations. The various records documenting different climate parameters at many locations over the Earth can also be used in meaningful comparison with numerical model simulations performed in a transient mode. Collectively, these works allow to estimate the phase relationships between the causes (insolation and the greenhouse effect) and the often abrupt responses of the various components of the climate system, such as the atmosphere, oceans and ice sheets. Although these studies concern a naturally-occurring global warming that took place over a long time period, useful parallels will be drawn with the evolution of modern climate. In fact, the phase relationships between forcings (such as greenhouse gases and solar input) and changes in regional and global temperatures are also at the heart of modern global climate change. As for early deglaciation, the ocean can modulate warming regionally, thereby delaying, or even temporarily masking, long-term changes. Climate changes over the last century have been smaller in magnitude than those of the last deglaciation. Fortunately for us, there has been no recent collapse of gigantic ice masses such as the Laurentian and Fennoscandian ice sheets. However, most climate models show a 20 to 40% reduction of the MOC during the 21st century. Even if this change exerts only a minor influence on the projected magnitude of global warming, such a slowdown in ocean circulation change is generally sufficient to reduce the simulated warming over the North Atlantic with a resulting impact on adjacent continents, including Europe.\n\nArctic biomass burning aerosol event-microphysical property retrieval\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBÃ¶ckmann, Christine; Ritter, Christoph; Ortiz-Amezcua, Pablo\n\n2018-04-01\n\nAn intense biomass-burning (BB) event from North America in July 2015 was observed over Ny-Ã lesund (Spitsbergen, European Arctic).

Inflammation of the nasal or oral mucosa, and lung and kidney involvements are typical in the course of the disease. In rare cases, pituitary involvement may occur and cause panhypopituitarism. Pituitary involvement is very rare, and only two pediatric case reports have been published to date out of a total of 24 cases. This is a case report of an adolescent patient who presented with panhypopituitarism symptoms and was later diagnosed with WG. A 16-year-old female patient complained of fever, headache, purulent nasal discharge and severe muscle and joint pain. Additionally, she had polyuria and polydipsia. Investigations revealed a pituitary mass and panhypopituitarism.

Since more than five years graduate and postgraduate education in the field of Earth System and Environmental Science has been established in Bremen and Bremerhaven, north-western Germany. Using the network and collaboration of experts and specialists on observational and paleoclimate data as well as on statistical data analysis and climate modelling from two Universities and the Helmholtz research institute on Polar and Marine Research, master and PhD students are trained to understand, decipher and cope with the challenges of recent climate change on an highly interdisciplinary and inter-institutional level. The existing research infrastructure at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven (AWI), University of Bremen, and Jacobs University Bremen offers a unique research environment to study past, present and future changes of the climate system, with special focus on high latitudinal processes. It covers all kind of disciplines, climate science, geosciences and biosciences, and provides a consistent framework for education and qualification of a new generation of expertly trained, internationally competitive master and PhD students. On postgraduate level, the Postgraduate Programme Environmental Physics (PEP) at the University of Bremen (www.pep.uni-bremen.de) educates the participants on the complex relationship between atmosphere, hydrosphere (ocean), cryosphere (ice region) and solid earth (land). Here, the learning of experimental methods in environmental physics at the most advanced level, numerical data analysis using supercomputers, and data interpretation via sophisticated methods prepare students for a scientific career. Within cooperation with the Ocean University of China (OUC) students are participating one year in the PEP programme during their master studies since 2006, to get finally a double degree of both universities.

Pulmonary hemorrhage is recognized as a severe respiratory complication. Untreated, the mortality rate approaches 90% at 2 years. We describe a case of Wegener granulomatosis with coexistent severe lung hemorrhage and pulmonary and deep vein thromboses. A 31-year-old man presented with features of vasculitis, including epistaxis, fever, and acute kidney injury with an increased serum creatinine level (3.27 mg/dL). Kidney biopsy confirmed pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody showing a cytoplasmic staining pattern was strongly positive. Standard immunosuppression therapy (prednisolone and cyclophosphamide) was started. Eleven days later, the patient developed sudden dyspnea. A computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram showed pulmonary emboli, and ultrasound of the limbs showed ileofemoral thrombi bilaterally. Subcutaneous enoxaparin and warfarin therapy was started, but 8 days later, the patient had a massive pulmonary hemorrhage. Anticoagulation therapy was stopped, and plasma exchange was started to prevent further life-threatening hemorrhage. An inferior vena cava filter was inserted to prevent further pulmonary emboli during the period when anticoagulation was withheld. Kidney function improved, and pulmonary hemorrhage resolved after 5 plasma exchanges. Reintroduction of intravenous heparin and subsequently warfarin caused no further bleeding. We discuss the difficult management dilemma this combination of disease manifestations presents and review the current literature.\n\n[Alfred Adler and the psychology of aesthetic surgery in the United States].\n\nPubMed\n\nGilman, S L\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThe quest for a psychological theory to explain the effects of aesthetic surgery reached its high point in the 1920s with the adoption of Alfred Adler's theory of the inferiority complex. The basis for this theory was Adler's early work in the psychological response of the body to disease and \"degeneration\". Aesthetic surgeons sought out the Adlerian model rather than a Freudian one as purely psychological while its roots, and their own theories, were clearly somatic in origin.\n\nAlfred Russel Wallace and the antivaccination movement in Victorian England.\n\nPubMed\n\nWeber, Thomas P\n\n2010-04-01\n\nAlfred Russel Wallace, eminent naturalist and codiscoverer of the principle of natural selection, was a major participant in the antivaccination campaigns in late 19th-century England.

Like Darwin, he was a truly remarkable nineteenth century intellect and polymath and, according to a recent book by Roy Davies (The Darwin conspiracy: origins of a scientific crime), he has a stronger claim to the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection than has Darwin. Here we present a critical comparison between the contributions of the two scientists. Sometimes referred to as 'The other beetle-hunter' and largely neglected for many decades, Wallace had a far greater experience of collecting and investigating animals and plants from their native habitats than had Darwin. He was furthermore much more than a pioneer biogeographer and evolutionary theorist, and also made contributions to anthropology, ethnography, geology, land reform and social issues. However, being a more modest, self-deprecating man than Darwin, and lacking the latter's establishment connections, Wallace's contribution to the theory of evolution was not given the recognition it deserved and he was undoubtedly shabbily treated at the time. It is time that Wallace's relationship with Darwin is reconsidered in preparation for 2013, the centenary of Wallace's death, and he should be recognized as at least an equal in the Wallace-Darwin theory of evolution.\n\nNuclear Planetology: Constraining the Driving Force in Wegener's Continental Drift Theory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRoller, G.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nNuclear planetology [1] is a new research field, which aims at deciphering the nuclear physics processes responsible for the evolution of ultra-substellar objects and the driving force in Wegener's continental drift theory by means of Re-Os nuclear geochronometry [2]. Terrestrial Re/Os ratios observed within diamond sulphide inclusions [3], compatible with lunar r-process production ratios of Th/Uâ1âAu/Ir [4], drop from â0.8 to 0.2-0.05 for nucleogeochronometric ages between 2.3 Ga and 1.4 Ga [5]. It has therefore been argued [5,6] that the Re/Os fractionation is related to a change in oxygen fugacity due to the physics/chemistry of Earth's core after a possibly Fermi-pressure controlled core collapse [4]. Here, Pd/Ru, Pd/Pt, Pd/Ir, Pd/Os, Ru/Ir, Ru/Os, Pt/Ir or Pt/Os ratios from 24 published H chondrite components [7] are connected to their respective nucleogeochronometric ages to constrain an extended fossil fractionation record over 800 Ma. The following ranges are obtained: 0.06-1.04 (Pd/Ru), 0.06-0.79 (Pd/Pt), 0.06-1.76 (Pd/Os), 0.07-1.94 (Pd/Ir), 1.08-1.99 (Ru/Ir), 0.83-2.41 (Pt/Os), 0.82-2.64 (Pt/Ir). Comparing the Re/Os fractionation pattern of the diamond sulphide inclusions with these results and considering that Re is readily oxidized even at ultra-low oxygen fugacity, it may be concluded that (i) extremely reducing conditions within Earth's core basically preserve any unfractionated r-process element ratio until today; and (ii) nuclear/quantum physics processes leading to the observed ratios and fractionation pattern are ultimately the driving force in Wegener's continental drift theory.

Here we focus on how the three anniversaries to celebrate the origin of the Darwin-Wallace theory in Germany in 1909, in 1959 in the divided country, as well as in 2009, have represented Charles Robert Darwin's and Alfred Russell Wallace's contributions. We have analyzed books and proceedings volumes related to these anniversaries, and the main result is that Wallace was almost always ignored, or only mentioned in passing. In 1909, Ernst Haeckel gave a talk in Jena, later published under the title The worldview of Darwin and Lamarck (Das Weltbild von Darwin und Lamarck), but not as the Darwin-Wallace concept. Haeckel mentions Wallace only once. In two important proceedings volumes from the 1959 anniversaries, Wallace was ignored. The only fair treatment of Wallace is given in another book, a collection of documents edited by Gerhard Heberer, for which the author selected nine key documents and reprinted excerpts (1959). Three of them were articles by Wallace, including the Sarawak- and Ternate-papers of 1855 and 1858, respectively. An analysis of the dominant themes during the celebrations of 2009 shows that none of the six topics had much to do with Wallace and his work. Thus, the tendency to exclude Alfred Russell Wallace is an international phenomenon, and largely attributable to the \"Darwin industry\".\n\nWegener's granulomatosis presenting as multiple bilateral renal masses: case report and literature review.\n\nPubMed\n\nFrigui, Makram; Ben Hmida, Mohamed; Kechaou, Manel; Jlidi, Rachid; Bahloul, Zouhir\n\n2009-04-01\n\nWegener's granulomatosis (WG) is a disease of unknown etiology characterized by necrotizing granulomatous vascularitis. The upper and lower respiratory tract and kidney involvements are very common; however, its presentation as bilateral renal masses is unusual. We report a case of a 59-year-old female patient who presented with multiple bilateral renal masses. The patient presented with sinusal and ocular symptoms suggestive of WG, and positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (c-ANCA) with an anti-PR3 pattern. Histopathologic examination of the renal biopsy specimen revealed granulomatous inflammation with vasculitis and fibrinoid necrosis. The patient management, including prednisone and cyclophosphamid, induced a marked improvement of the renal masses. This case illustrates that WG should be considered in the differential diagnosis of renal masses.\n\nA Paradoxical Partnership in Higher Education: The Alliance between Alfred C.

He returned to Australia in 1905 and continued doing research while establishing a neurological practice. His research over the next 17 years focused on four topics: (a) localisation in the cerebellum, (b) the neuroses and psychoses in war, (c) localisation in the cerebral cortex of the gorilla, and (d) the causes and pathology of the mysterious Australian \"X\" Disease (later known as Murray Valley encephalitis). In this article, I elaborate on his research in these areas, which provided evidence (a) against Louis Bolk's thesis that variation in the size of the cerebellar cortex reflected variation in the amount of cortex controlling various groups of muscle, (b) against the view that the neuroses and psychoses in war were different from those in civilian life, (c) for a parcelation of the cortex of the gorilla brain that supported his earlier findings in the higher apes, and (d) on the cause and pathophysiology of Australian \"X\" disease. Much of this research was overlooked, but it remains of considerable value and historical significance.\n\nCitation for presentation of the 2016 Alfred E. Treibs Award to Patrick G.

I have known Pat for almost twenty years, over which time we have shared an interest in biomacromolecules, biodegradation, and the development of analytical methods. Pat is a true chemist at heart and we have all benefited greatly from his insights on the examination of complex macromolecular materials through state-of-the art spectroscopic analyses.\n\nStroke, music, and creative output: Alfred Schnittke and other composers.\n\nPubMed\n\nZagvazdin, Yuri\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAlfred Schnittke (1934-1998), a celebrated Russian composer of the twentieth century, suffered from several strokes which affected his left cerebral hemisphere. The disease, however, did not diminish his musical talent. Moreover, he stated that his illness in a way facilitated his work. The composer showed amazingly high productivity after his first and second injuries of the central nervous system. The main topic of this chapter is the effect of strokes on Schnittke's output, creativity, and style of music. A brief biography of the composer with the chronology of his brain hemorrhages is included. In addition, the influence of cerebrovascular lesions on creative potential of other prominent composers such as Benjamin Britten, Jean Langlais, Vissarion Shebalin, Igor Stravinsky, and Ira Randall Thompson is discussed.

However, they viewed the working of selection differently. For Darwin, selection was always focused on the benefit for the individual. For Wallace, selection was as much something of benefit for the group as for the individual. This difference is traced to their different background political-economic views, with Darwin in favor of Adam Smith's view of society and Wallace following Robert Owen in being a socialist.\n\nAssessment of the Item Selection and Weighting in the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener's Granulomatosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMAHR, ALFRED D.; NEOGI, TUHINA; LAVALLEY, MICHAEL P.; DAVIS, JOHN C.; HOFFMAN, GARY S.; MCCUNE, W. JOSEPH; SPECKS, ULRICH; SPIERA, ROBERT F.; ST.CLAIR, E. WILLIAM; STONE, JOHN H.; MERKEL, PETER A.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nObjective To assess the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener's Granulomatosis (BVAS/WG) with respect to its selection and weighting of items. Methods This study used the BVAS/WG data from the Wegener's Granulomatosis Etanercept Trial. The scoring frequencies of the 34 predefined items and any âotherâ items added by clinicians were calculated. Using linear regression with generalized estimating equations in which the physician global assessment (PGA) of disease activity was the dependent variable, we computed weights for all predefined items. We also created variables for clinical manifestations frequently added as other items, and computed weights for these as well. We searched for the model that included the items and their generated weights yielding an activity score with the highest R2 to predict the PGA. Results We analyzed 2,044 BVAS/WG assessments from 180 patients; 734 assessments were scored during active disease. The highest R2 with the PGA was obtained by scoring WG activity based on the following items: the 25 predefined items rated on â¥5 visits, the 2 newly created fatigue and weight loss variables, the remaining minor other and major other items, and a variable that signified whether new or worse items were present at a specific visit. The weights assigned to the items ranged from 1 to 21. Compared with the original BVAS/WG, this modified score correlated significantly more strongly with the PGA. Conclusion This study suggests possibilities to enhance the item selection and weighting of the BVAS/WG. These changes may increase this instrument's ability to capture the continuum of disease activity in WG.

His major works were translated into Russian and his general ideas were read and discussed by both insiders and outsiders of scientific evolutionism. At the same time, Wallace played a controversial role in the growth of Darwinism in Russia, and Charles Robert Darwin (1809-1882) has eclipsed Wallace in his influence on Russian evolutionary thinking. In this paper we briefly outline Wallaceâs impact on Russian pre-Synthetic scientific evolutionism and its general intellectual climate. We demonstrate that both Russian pro-Darwinian evolutionists and anti-Darwinians (scientific anti-Darwinians as well as creationists) were fully aware of Wallaceâs contributions to the development of evolutionary theory. Yet, Wallaceâs radical selectionism, as well as his controversial arguments for âdesign in natureâ, predetermined his special place within the Russian intellectual landscape.\n\nDiscussion of Alfred Alder's preface to The Diary of Vaslav Nijinsky.\n\nPubMed\n\nAnsbacher, H L\n\n1981-07-01\n\nIn his preface to The Diary of Vaslav Nijinsky, Alfred Adler (1) found his theory of the dynamics of schizophrenia supported in the Diary, (2) alluded to Nijinsky's prepsychotic personality, and (3) briefly touched on the possibility and conditions of recovery. To add to the understanding of Adler's \"Preface,\" this discussion (1) expands his theory of schizophrenia, (2) gives some concrete data of Nijinsky's prepsychotic personality, (3) describes two episodes of recovery subsequent to the \"Preface,\" and (4) introduces an important aspect of Adler's theory, which he had to omit out of consideration for Nijinsky's wife, Romola-namely, her role in her husband's disorder. With the larger theoretical and historical context established. Adler's \"Preface\" can be appreciated for its predictive validity.\n\n[C-ANCA positive necrotising scleritis and multiple sclerosis compatible with ocular Wegener: treatment with rituximab].\n\nPubMed\n\nAldasoro-CÃ¡ceres, V; Aldasoro-CÃ¡ceres, I; PÃ©rez-Moreiras, J V; MuriÃ©-FernÃ¡ndez, M; IbÃ¡Ã±ez-Bosch, R\n\n2014-01-01\n\nA patient diagnosed with necrotizing scleritis, c-ANCA+ an orbital pseudotumour, and possible multiple sclerosis in 2003 was treated with oral cyclophosphamide and steroids with partial response. Between 2005-2010 she suffered self-limited episodes. In 2010 a first scleral transplant was performed with poor outcome. She was treated with rituximab, and a second graft was performed with good results. At 12 months there was no change in magnetic resonance and the second graft healed. Wegener's disease with limited involvement of the orbit and/or the eye is a rare condition. The histopathology, blood analysis, symptoms and good response to treatment are the key to its diagnosis.

Cranial involvement can result in cranial nerve palsies and, rarely, pituitary infiltration. We describe the case of a 32Â year-old woman with limited but severe GPA manifesting as progressive cranial nerve palsies and pituitary dysfunction. Our patient initially presented with localised ENT involvement, but despite treatment with methotrexate, she deteriorated. Granulomatous inflammatory tissue around the skull base resulted in cavernous sinus syndrome, facial nerve palsy, palsies of cranial nerves IX-XII (Collet-Sicard syndrome), and the rare complication of cranial diabetes insipidus due to pituitary infiltration. The glossopharyngeal, vagus and accessory nerve palsies resulted in severe dysphagia and she required nasogastric tube feeding. Her neurological deficits substantially improved with treatment including high dose corticosteroid, cyclophosphamide and rituximab. This case emphasises that serious morbidity can arise from localised cranial Wegener's granulomatosis in the absence of systemic disease. In such cases intensive induction immunosuppression is required.Â Analysis of previously reported cases of pituitary involvement in GPA reveals that this rare complication predominantly affects female patients.\n\nAlfred Adler, pioneer in prevention of mental disorders.\n\nPubMed\n\nAnsbacher, H L\n\n1990-09-01\n\nAlfred Adler (1870-1937) one of the four original members of what was to become the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, was the first to accept a humanistic-educational model of man in contrast to Freud's medical model of man. This was in line with his deep involvement with prevention; in fact his original interest was in medical prevention. The present paper describes how his work touched on all the points of the contemporary field of psychological prevention. He developed a personality theory most suitable for application in prevention, education and brief psychotherapy. He identified various categories of children at risk. He advocated the right to abortion partly to prevent the birth of a child severely at risk by being unwanted. He considered the then existing dominance of the male sex to be damaging to both sexes. He engaged in practical prevention work by addressing general audiences and especially teachers and by the establishment of and participation in Educational Counseling Centers. He felt that the honest psychologist for reasons of prevention is bound to social advocacy, and that a true psychology of mental health merges into a corresponding world philosophy. These points are fully documented with quotations and references.\n\nModeling of the Wegener Bergeron Findeisen processâimplications for aerosol indirect effects\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStorelvmo, T.; KristjÃ¡nsson, J. E.; Lohmann, U.; Iversen, T.; KirkevÃ¥g, A.; Seland, Ã.\n\n2008-10-01\n\nA new parameterization of the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen (WBF) process has been developed, and implemented in the general circulation model CAM-Oslo. The new parameterization scheme has important implications for the process of phase transition in mixed-phase clouds. The new treatment of the WBF process replaces a previous formulation, in which the onset of the WBF effect depended on a threshold value of the mixing ratio of cloud ice. As no observational guidance for such a threshold value exists, the previous treatment added uncertainty to estimates of aerosol effects on mixed-phase clouds. The new scheme takes subgrid variability into account when simulating the WBF process, allowing for smoother phase transitions in mixed-phase clouds compared to the previous approach. The new parameterization yields a model state which gives reasonable agreement with observed quantities, allowing for calculations of aerosol effects on mixed-phase clouds involving a reduced number of tunable parameters. Furthermore, we find a significant sensitivity to perturbations in ice nuclei concentrations with the new parameterization, which leads to a reversal of the traditional cloud lifetime effect.\n\nA portrait of prefrontal lobotomy performed at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney by Dr Rex Money.\n\nPubMed\n\nWhite, Richard T; McGee-Collett, Martin\n\n2016-10-01\n\nThe objective of this article is to provide a portrait of prefrontal lobotomy performed at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney by the Head of Neurosurgery Dr Rex Money and to describe Dr Money's role in the promotion of psychosurgery in Sydney. We draw attention to an oral presentation by Dr Rex Money in 1951, a journal article written by Money, archival information held at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, including Dr Money's accounts of his travels and his reports regarding neurosurgery - both internationally and in Australia. Dr Rex Money performed a series of 13 prefrontal lobotomies between 1945 and 1951, and presented the theoretical basis for his series, his operative procedures and the outcomes at the annual meeting of its medical officers' association. Notwithstanding various deficiencies in his clinical research, Money's descriptions give a relatively comprehensive account of one of the first series of prefrontal lobotomies performed in Australia. The current article also describes Dr Money's contributions to the promotion of psychosurgery in Sydney, and illustrates the participation of a senior neurosurgeon and of a major Sydney teaching hospital during the psychosurgery saga.

Despite Alfred Werner's groundbreaking studies of coordination chemistry in the early 20th century, that inferior status remained in place - particularly in the US - until the 1950s, when the beginnings of a resurgence that eventually restored its parity with the other subfields can be clearly observed. This paper explores the extent to which Werner's heritage - both direct, in the form of academic descendants, and indirect - contributed to those advances.\n\nEminent Victorian dentistry. 1. John Ruskin and the patient experience of Victorian dentistry. Ruskin's dentist, Alfred James Woodhouse.\n\nPubMed\n\nBishop, M G H\n\n2011-02-26\n\nThis paper describes the relationship between John Ruskin [1819-1900] the Victorian artist, writer, and critic, and Alfred James Woodhouse [1824-1906], the dentist who cared for him from 1866 to 1883. Although Ruskin was perhaps not quite as eccentric as a recent television series has portrayed him, he was certainly not conventional, and the relationship with his dentist was also not entirely conventional.\n\nContinental drift under the Third Reich.\n\nPubMed\n\nBuffetaut, Eric\n\n2003-12-01\n\nContrary to what happened in many other countries in the 1930s and 1940s, Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift was not generally rejected in Nazi Germany, although several leading German geologists of the time did not accept it. It was actually presented as the modern view of Earth history in books and magazine articles aimed at the general public. Although outlandish geological theories such as HÃ¶rbiger's Welteislehre were favoured by some Nazi dignitaries, they were not widely accepted in scientific circles. On the other hand, continental drift received official support under the Third Reich, at a time when it was ignored or ridiculed by most earth scientists outside Germany.\n\nAlfred Russel Wallace and the road to natural selection, 1844-1858.\n\nPubMed\n\nSmith, Charles H\n\n2015-01-01\n\nConventional wisdom has had it that the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace and his colleague Henry Walter Bates journeyed to the Amazon in 1848 with two intentions in mind: to collect natural history specimens, and to consider evidential materials that might reveal the causal basis of organic evolution. This understanding has been questioned recently by the historian John van Wyhe, who points out that with regard to the second matter, at least, there appears to be no evidence of a \"smoking gun\" variety proving it so. In the present essay the circumstances of Wallace's interest in the matter are reviewed, and van Wyhe is taken to task with alternate explanations for the facts he introduces in his argument. The conclusion is that Wallace almost certainly did have the second objective in mind when he left for both the Amazon, and the Far East.\n\nShort-term changes in mobile dunes at Port Alfred, South Africa\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLubke, Roy A.; Sugden, Jean\n\n1990-03-01\n\nDevelopment along the western beachfront of Port Alfred, which is situated along a sandy shoreline, increased markedly in the 1960s as the coastal town became a popular holiday resort. This development included the removal of coastal vegetation, which resulted in the destabilization of dunes and migration of sand westerly onto the road, West Beach parking lot, and lawns of the cabanas. Sand traps were constructed to collect sand blowing across the dunes over set periods, and the net sand movement along the mobile dune belt was calculated using Hunter's equation. The dunes show an easterly movement of sand at a rate of 3.5 m/yr, which is comparable with figures recorded along other areas of this coastline. Considering the wind regime and amount of sand movement along this coast, it is inappropriate to clear vegetation and develop within the dune region.\n\nAlfred P. Southwick, MDS, DDS: dental practitioner, educator and originator of electrical executions.\n\nPubMed\n\nChristen, A G; Christen, J A\n\n2000-11-01\n\nThe search for a modern, humane method of criminal execution was triggered by a freak accident which occurred in Buffalo, New York in 1881. Dr. Alfred P. Southwick (a former steam-boat engineer, noted dentist and dental educator) happened to witness an intoxicated man die after he inadvertently touched a live generator terminal. Southwick's initial reaction was shock. Later, as he pondered this tragic event, he concluded that electrocution was, at least, a quick and seemingly painless way to depart from this earth. As his thoughts turned to common methods of capital punishment, Alfred concluded that death by electrocution could become a more humane alternative, as compared with the more grisly methods (e.g., hanging, beheading by guillotine, garroting, suffocation and flaying). Working through the governor of New York and the state legislature, Southwick originated and successfully promoted the passage of laws which mandated electrical executions in New York and in approximately 20 other states. During 1888-1889, Southwick served on the state's three-person Electrical Death Commission, a group who reported that electrical execution was superior to all other methods. On January 1, 1889, the world's first electrical execution law went into effect. On August 6, 1890, William Francis Kemmler, who had murdered his mistress, was the first person to die in the electric chair. However, this public event became an amateurish spectacle: the initial surge of current did not cause Kemmler's immediate death and a second jolt was needed. Those who witnessed this bungled execution were stunned. Graphic and detailed criticism from both the press and the general public ran high. However, Dr. Southwick vigorously continued to support and finally achieve his goal--to humanize capital punishment through the legal use of electrical execution.\n\nSymbiogenesis, natural selection, and the dynamic Earth.\n\nPubMed\n\nKutschera, U\n\n2009-08-01\n\nOne century ago, Constantin S. Mereschkowsky introduced the symbiogenesis theory for the origin of chloroplasts from ancient cyanobacteria which was later supplemented by Ivan E. Wallin's proposal that mitochondria evolved from once free-living bacteria. Today, this Mereschkowsky-Wallin principle of symbiogenesis, which is also known as the serial primary endosymbiosis theory, explains the evolutionary origin of eukaryotic cells and hence the emergence of all eukaryotes (protists, fungi, animals and plants). In 1858, the concept of natural selection was described independently by Charles Darwin and Alfred R. Wallace. In the same year, Antonio Snider-Pellegrini proposed the idea of shifting continents, which was later expanded by Alfred Wegener, who published his theory of continental drift eight decades ago. Today, directional selection is accepted as the major cause of adaptive evolution within natural populations of micro- and macro-organisms and the theory of the dynamic Earth (plate tectonics) is well supported. In this article, I combine the processes and principles of symbiogenesis, natural selection and the dynamic Earth and propose an integrative 'synade-model' of macroevolution which takes into account organisms from all five Kingdoms of life.\n\nRare presentation of Wegener's granulomatosis in the pituitary gland: Case report and literature review.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaird, Samantha M; Pratap, Upasna; McLean, Catriona; Law, Candice P; Maartens, Nicholas\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWegener's granulomatosis (WG) is a systemic vasculitis that can affect a variety of organs including ear, nose and throat, lungs and kidneys. However WG is unusual in the pituitary and rare in the central nervous system. A 56-year-old male with likely WG presented with polyuria and polydipsia despite six months of conservative medical management. MRI scanning revealed an enlarging heterogeneously enhancing pituitary gland. Following endoscopic transsphenoidal pituitary biopsy and debulking, final tissue pathology was diagnostic for WG in the pituitary gland. Diagnosis remains difficult but most patients present with central diabetes insipidus (CDI) as well as varying degrees of hypopituitarism on a background of disease activity in other organs. Clinical judgment needs to balance the need for invasive surgical tissue diagnosis with increasing immunosuppressive therapy. It is important to consider this rare complication of WG to ensure timely diagnosis and management. Crown Copyright Â© 2017. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this report, a female patient who presented with vasculitis-like and asthmatic symptoms was diagnosed as having polyangiitis overlap syndrome of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis) and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA; formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome). The patient fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for GPA and EGPA. She was successfully treated with immunosuppressants and steroids and has been in remission for 20 months. It is important to establish a proper diagnosis and introduce an appropriate treatment modality in patients with this rare and serious pathology to prevent irreversible organ damage.\n\nAccelerating medical innovation at USC: realizing the dream of Alfred E.

Mann's vision is to create organizations that will help medical innovations born in academic environments evolve into commercially fit solutions, without the risk of being abandoned under the financial pressures early stage start-ups often experience. In 1998, Mann worked with Stephen Sample, president of USC, to create the first AMI for Biomedical Engineering, an organization fueled by an endowment valued at approximately US$160 million today. Technology-acceleration centers come in different flavors. AMI USC's recipe has evolved since its creation, with edits that incorporate lessons learned and improvements brought by its expanding network of talented resource people. Its 15-member staff, consisting of three-fourths industry professionals, includes seasoned generalists and specialists in medical technology commercialization. Although the support varies with each invention, some recurring ingredients weave into the AMI approach to accelerating medical innovation.\n\nAlfred Pischinger (1899-1983): An Austrian career in anatomy continuing through National Socialism to postwar leadership.\n\nPubMed\n\nHildebrandt, Sabine; Czarnowski, Gabriele\n\n2017-05-01\n\nDespite intensified research efforts on the history of anatomy during National Socialism (NS), many aspects of this story still need further investigation. This study explores the life, work and politics of Alfred Pischinger, Chairman of the Institute for Embryology and Histology in Graz from 1936 to 1945, and in Vienna from 1958 to 1970, and is an addition to previous reports on careers in anatomy continuing through the Third Reich to the postwar period. Pischinger was an illegal NSDAP member in Austria, joined the SA in 1938, served as expert in racial hygiene, and as judge on the Genetic Health High Court of Graz. His research focus was histochemistry, but he became part of a scientific network at the University of Graz, which from 1939 on experimented on the bodies of pregnant women and their fetuses under the leadership of gynecologist Karl Ehrhardt. The researchers were among the many who took actively part in the complete exploitation and physical destruction of those considered to be \"the enemy\" by the NS regime. After the war, Pischinger received publicity for his work on the \"scientific basis\" of alternative and holistic approaches of medicine. His NS past and fetal experiments seem to have vanished from public knowledge. As systematic studies of the influence of the NS period on postwar medical education and the science of anatomy itself are still missing, this critical investigation of Alfred Pischinger's life within the relevant historic background aims to contribute to this body of knowledge.

The famed directorâs portrayal of a psychologically damaged young man connected with a much larger discussion over political and sexual deviance in the early Cold War, a discussion that cantered on the image of the psychopath as the dominant threat to national security and that played upon normative assumptions about adolescent development and mother-son relations.\n\nAlfred Binet and the Concept of Heterogeneous Ordersâ\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMichell, Joel\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIn a comment, hitherto unremarked upon, Alfred Binet, well known for constructing the first intelligence scale, claimed that his scale did not measure intelligence, but only enabled classification with respect to a hierarchy of intellectual qualities. Attempting to understand the reasoning behind this comment leads to an historical excursion, beginning with the ancient mathematician, Euclid and ending with the modern French philosopher, Henri Bergson. As Euclid explained (Heath, 1908), magnitudes constituting a given quantitative attribute are all of the same kind (i.e., homogeneous), but his criterion covered only extensive magnitudes. Duns Scotus (Cross, 1998) included intensive magnitudes by considering differences, which raised the possibility (later considered by Sutherland, 2004) of ordered attributes with heterogeneous differences between degrees (âheterogeneous ordersâ). Of necessity, such attributes are non-measurable. Subsequently, this became a basis for the âquantity objectionâ to psychological measurement, as developed first by Tannery (1875a,b) and then by Bergson (1889). It follows that for attributes investigated in science, there are three structural possibilities: (1) classificatory attributes (with heterogeneous differences between categories); (2) heterogeneous orders (with heterogeneous differences between degrees); and (3) quantitative attributes (with thoroughly homogeneous differences between magnitudes). Measurement is possible only with attributes of kind (3) and, as far as we know, psychological attributes are exclusively of kinds (1) or (2). However, contrary to the known facts, psychometricians, for their own special reasons insist that test scores provide measurements.

Besides Balzac's \"La fille aux yeux d'or\" (1834/35) it is in particular Alfred v.

Further 19 positive results were found in a group of 251 patients with other diseases: 1 of 4 pts with Churg-Strauss syndrome, 1 of 2 with pulmonary renal syndrome, 5 of 28 with connective tissue diseases, 1 of 21 with tuberculosis, 1 of 23 with sarcoidosis, 1 of 6 with histiocytosis, 3 of 11 with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, 1 (lymphoma) of 34 with neoplasms, 1 of 20 with pulmonary fibrosis, 1 of 8 with cardiac failure, 1 of 5 with pleural fluid, 1 of 10 pneumoconiosis and toxic reactions (after furagin), 1 of 6 with BOOP. Sensitivity of ANCA test in our material is 87%, specificity = 95%, and positive prevalence accuracy is 68%. It means that 32% of the patients with positive results could be inappropriate treated as WG. ANCA test could be not used as a screening test. Results of ANCA test alone cannot be used as basis for treatment. ANCA test is a helpful tool in diagnosing of WG.\n\n[Alfred Kohn, professor of histology at German University in Prague].\n\nPubMed\n\nNanka, O; Grim, M\n\n2008-01-01\n\nProf. Kohn (1867-1959) was the head of the Institute of Histology at the Medical Faculty of German University in Prague for 26 years. In 2007 we commemorated his 140th birthday, and 2009 we will remember the 50th anniversary of his death. He entered the history of medicine by discovery of nature and origin of parathyroid glands and by pioneer research into chromaffin cells and sympathetic paraganglia. K"
