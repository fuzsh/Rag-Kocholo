        "text": "Biography:\n\nOriginally known for her abilities as a pop singer, Malaysian born Amy Mastura would go on to fame as an actress, appearing in a number of romantic comedy films. Born May 10, 1971, Mastura first caught attention at the 1993 Asia Bagus show in Japan. In 1995, Mastura won the Penyanyi Wanita Popular Award for her debut album, Amy Mastura. That year also marked her debut as an actress, starring in the film Kuala Lumpur Universiti. Many more films would follow, and her popularity was boosted by a number of hit albums -- nearly ten over a ten-year period. Originally part of the Pony Canyon stable of artists, Mastura's rising popularity in film and music allowed her the freedom to sign with the big boys -- Sony -- for her fourth album, Bintang Hati. In addition to brisk sales, Mastura has enjoyed her fair share of awards, for both her recording work and her film appearances. ~ Chris True, Rovi"
