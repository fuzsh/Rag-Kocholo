        "text": "Norman Abdul Halim was born on the 5th February 1972,in London,England.Norman was the first child of Mr.Halim and Mrs.Zarina a.w Fenner.When Norman was borned ,his father was furthering his studies in London.The whole family stayed in the university hostel.In the hostel,there was this German girl who always enjoyed playing with Norman.Then,one day,the German took Norman out for a walk .Being young (16) and naive at the time ,Zarina gave permisson to take the baby outdoors.When she didn't return with the Norman,Mr Halim and Mrs Zarina lodged a police report for kidnapping.Luckly,the German did return Norman at the end of the day,saying she couldn't stand with Norman's non-stop crying. When Norman was 1 year and 4 months,he got a new baby brother,given the name Yusry.His small difference of age with his little brother,Norman didn't really have the oppurtunity to get cuddled up and be spoilt by his mother because she was much to busy with the new baby(yusry was much more adorable,hehehe).Having a new baby brother,he grew up with responsibilty to look after his brother and often played with him.After 3 years ,he got another little baby brother,Edry.And two years after, he got a baby sister ,Halina. Norman grew fond of his younger siblings,loving and looking after each one of them,be it Yusry,Edry or Halina. Norman's first school was Sek Rendah Sri Petaling.He proceded to Sek Men Setapak.In school,he was a very active student, being the president in clubs and society's.He was also a prefect in school .He described himself as being a very popular person(perasan!) and a teachers pet at the same time.He was quite a gangster and funky person among his cliques and with his teachers,he was a total responsible and inteligent student.Norman was 16,when he had to follow his family to move to UK.Norman continued his studies there . In UK,Norman took the chance to gain more experience for his own good.That is why ,during his school break ,he took the oppurtunity to work at a petrol station.After returning to Malaysia ,a few years later ,Norman furthered his studies in a local private college in Selangor.Norman and his bros' liked to compose ,write and sing the songs afterward.They made demo tapes just for fun,and Norman passed the demo' around.For some reason,the demo tape ended in EMI,where afterwards Calvin,the head of International (EMI).Calvin, then contacted Norman and to shorten the story,KRU signed a contract with EMI. Norman was the leader of the group ,not to mention ,the manager at the same time.\n\nHe was the main spokesperson for KRU for interviews ,photoshoots and the press.\n\nHe was also the one who wrote the lyrics and supervised the quality of the songs penned down by Yusry and Edry.Their first album,Canggih ,was a hit among fans who craved for a new kind of music. Norman is known as a very dedicated and hardworking person.He is also a talented good bussinesman .He is also a very moody person,and according to the close people around him ,he should be totally undisturbed when he is in a bad mood.Eventhough,he's quite a strict and moody (not to mention ,bossy!)person,he's also very funny ,nice ,responsible and and one cool dude."
