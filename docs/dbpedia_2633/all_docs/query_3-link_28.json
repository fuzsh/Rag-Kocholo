An extensive literature survey was carried out until 10 April 2024. A total of 415 participants from six eligible studies were included. The overall results from the random-effects model indicated that cornelian cherry supplementation significantly reduced body weight (standardised mean difference [SMD] = −0.27, confidence interval [CI]: −0.52, −0.02, p = 0.03), body mass index (SMD = −0.42, CI: −0.73, −0.12, p = 0.007), fasting blood glucose (SMD = −0.46, CI: −0.74, −0.18, p = 0.001), glycated haemoglobin (SMD = −0.70, CI: −1.19, −0.22, p = 0.005), and HOMA-IR (SMD = −0.89, CI: −1.62, −0.16, p = 0.02), while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly increased (SMD = 0.38, CI: 0.10, 0.65, p = 0.007). A sensitivity analysis showed that cornelian cherry supplementation significantly reduced total plasma triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and insulin levels. Cornelian cherry supplementation did not significantly affect waist circumference and liver parameters among the participants. Considering these findings, this meta-analysis indicates that supplementation with cornelian cherry may impact diverse cardiometabolic risk factors among individuals considered to be at a high risk.

We categorized feeding modes at 6 months into exclusive breastfeeding, mixed feeding, and exclusive formula feeding. Participants were analyzed in two groups based on their PPWR assessment at 6 and 12 months postpartum, with complete datasets available for each assessment. We calculated PPWR by subtracting pre-pregnancy weight from self-reported weight at 6 and 12 months postpartum, defining substantial PPWR as ≥5 kg retention. Modified Poisson regression models adjusted for potential confounders were performed. At 6 and 12 months, 35% (n = 132/379) and 31% (n = 109/347) of women experienced substantial PPWR, respectively. Compared to exclusive breastfeeding, mixed feeding (risk ratio 1.85; 95% confidence interval 1.15, 2.99) and exclusive formula feeding (2.11; 1.32, 3.28) were associated with a higher risk of substantial PPWR at 6 months. These associations were slightly attenuated at 12 months and appeared stronger in women with pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity. This study suggests that breastfeeding by 6 months postpartum may help mitigate PPWR, particularly with exclusive breastfeeding. It also draws attention to targeted interventions to promote breastfeeding among women with overweight or obesity.

In vitro experiments utilizing 3T3-L1 preadipocytes revealed that CME potently inhibited adipocyte differentiation, as evidenced by a dose-dependent reduction in lipid droplet formation. Remarkably, CME also attenuated glucose uptake and intracellular triglyceride accumulation in fully differentiated adipocytes, suggesting its ability to modulate metabolic pathways in mature adipose cells. Translating these findings to an in vivo setting, we evaluated the effects of CME in C57BL/6N mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks. CME administration, concomitantly with the HFD, resulted in a significant attenuation of body weight gain compared to the HFD control group. Furthermore, CME treatment led to substantial reductions in liver weight, total fat mass, and deposits of visceral and retroperitoneal adipose tissue, underscoring its targeted impact on adipose expansion. Histological analyses revealed the remarkable effects of CME on hepatic steatosis. While the HFD group exhibited severe lipid accumulation within liver lobules, CME dose-dependently mitigated this pathology, with the highest dose virtually abolishing hepatic fat deposition. An examination of adipose tissue revealed a progressive reduction in adipocyte hypertrophy upon CME treatment, culminating in a near-normalization of adipocyte morphology at the highest dose. Notably, CME exhibited potent anti-inflammatory properties, significantly attenuating the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines’ mRNA levels (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) in the livers of HFD-fed mice. This suggests a potential mechanism through which CME may exert protective effects against inflammation associated with obesity and fatty liver disease.

Paediatric patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) may be more susceptible to lockdown effects due to their increased cardiovascular risk. However, data are lacking. We investigated the effect of lockdowns on the metabolic profile of paediatric patients with FH. Blood lipids and anthropometry measured in September 2021–April 2022 were retrospectively compared with pre-pandemic values. Thirty participants were included (1–16 years; 57% female). From baseline to post-pandemic, median [P25, P75] blood LDL-C concentration was 125 [112, 150] mg/dL vs. 125 [100, 147] mg/dL (p = 0.894); HDL-C was 58 [52, 65] mg/dL vs. 56 [51, 61] mg/dL (p = 0.107); triglycerides were 64 [44, 86] mg/dL vs. 59 [42, 86] mg/dL (p = 0.178). The BMI z-score did not change significantly (0.19 [−0.58, 0.89] vs. 0.30 [−0.48, 1.10], p = 0.524). The lack of deterioration in metabolic profiles during lockdowns is positive, as some deterioration was expected. We speculate that patients and caregivers were successfully educated about healthy lifestyle and dietary habits. Our results should be interpreted with caution since the study sample was small and heterogeneous. Multicentre research is needed to better understand the impact of lockdowns on this population.

The Mediterranean diet (MD) has shown clear benefits in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, as well as in sleep patterns. Here, our objective was to identify the impact of adherence to the MD and other lifestyle factors on the clinical burden of migraine. For this purpose, we enrolled 170 migraine patients and 100 controls, assessing the clinical disability of headache using standardized clinical scales (HIT-6 and MIDAS) in the migraineur cohort and lifestyle patterns in both groups through the PREDIMED score for MD adherence, the IPAQ scale for physical activity, and BMI. Subjects were also screened for sleep–wake disturbances based on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). We found that migraine patients had lower adherence to the MD compared to the controls and that the HIT-6 scale had a significant negative relationship with MD adherence in patients with high-frequency episodic and chronic migraine. Additionally, in the same migraine patients, the presence of sleep–wake disturbances was correlated with greater migraine disability as assessed by the MIDAS score. In conclusion, this study found that among different lifestyle factors, poor adherence to the MD and the presence of sleep–wake disturbances were closely associated with migraine disability and chronification.

Methods: This study was based on the Shanghai sub-cohort of the International Birth Cohort of China. A total of 4051 woman–infant pairs with singleton pregnancies were recruited. Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were defined as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of 25 and 50 nmol/L, respectively. AD in infants was assessed during the first six months using a standardized questionnaire based on the British Working Party criteria. Modified Poisson regression estimated the association between maternal vitamin D status and infant AD. Results: The risk of AD in infants was higher in women with deficient 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in the first trimester (RR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.41–2.23). This increased risk was seen in naturally conceived pregnancies, but not in those conceived using assisted reproductive technology (ART). The incidence of AD decreased in infants of mothers who took multi-vitamin (RR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.67–1.98) and vitamin D supplements (RR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.37–0.71) compared to those whose mothers did not take any supplements. Maternal vitamin D deficiency had varying effects on AD risk based on passive smoking exposure and breastfeeding patterns. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring and supplementing vitamin D during pregnancy, especially in specific maternal populations, to reduce the risk of AD in offspring.

Existing research mainly examines the relationship between sugar-sweetened carbonated beverage (SSB) consumption and uric acid levels. This study explored the association between the quantity and frequency of SSB consumption and elevated uric acid levels in Korean adults. Data from 2881 participants aged 19–64 years (1066 men and 1815 women) in the 2016 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed. Serum uric acid levels were categorized into quartiles, with the highest defined as high uric acid (men, ≥6.7 mg/dL; women, ≥4.8 mg/dL). SSB consumption was classified into quartiles (almost never, <1 cup (<200 mL), 1–3 cups (200–600 mL), ≥3 cups (≥600 mL)) and frequency into tertiles (almost never, ≤1/week, ≥2/week). Multivariate logistic regression assessed the association, with separate analyses for men and women. Increased daily SSB consumption and frequency were significantly associated with high uric acid levels in men but not in women. After adjusting for sociodemographic and health characteristics, consuming ≥3 cups (≥600 mL) of SSBs per day and SSBs ≥ 2/week were significantly associated with high serum uric acid levels in men, but this association was not observed in women. The study concludes that increased SSB intake is linked to elevated uric acid levels in Korean men, but not in women.

We defined abnormal body water balance as overhydration, with an extracellular fluid/total body water ratio > 0.390. A geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) < 98 was considered low GNRI. Sarcopenia was defined according to the 2019 Asian Working Group for sarcopenia criteria. Poor outcome was defined as a modified Rankin scale (mRS) score ≥ 3 at discharge. Among 111 eligible patients (40 females, median age: 77 years), 43 had a poor prognosis, 31 exhibited overhydration, 25 had low GNRI, and 44 experienced sarcopenia. Patients with poor outcomes had significantly higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, which were significantly more common with overhydration, low GNRI, and sarcopenia (p < 0.001 for all). Concomitant overhydration, low GNRI, and sarcopenia were associated with poorer outcomes. In multivariate analysis, overhydration [odds ratio (OR) 5.504, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.717–17.648; p = 0.004], age (OR 1.062, 95%CI 1.010–1.117; p = 0.020), and NIHSS score (OR 1.790, 95%CI 1.307–2.451; p < 0.001) were independent prognostic factors for poor outcome. The results indicated that the combination of overhydration, low GNRI, and sarcopenia predict poor outcomes following AIS. Overhydration was particularly associated with poor outcomes.

Silkworms have demonstrated estrogenic properties, offering promising alternatives. We assessed the therapeutic effects of freeze-dried silkworm powder (SWP) on menopausal symptoms using an ovariectomized (OVX) mouse model. The experimental design comprised a sham surgery group (Sham), an OVX control group, a low-dose SWP group post-OVX (80 mg/kg, OVX-SWP-L), a high-dose SWP group post-OVX (160 mg/kg, OVX-SWP-H), and an estradiol treatment group post-OVX (OVX-E2). Treatments were administered orally thrice weekly over eight weeks; body weight was monitored weekly. The SWP-treated groups (SWP-L and SWP-H) exhibited less weight gain and increased uterine thickness than the OVX control. Molecular analyses demonstrated that SWP significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), ERK, and AKT. Furthermore, biochemical assays revealed reduced serum neutral lipids across all SWP treatment groups. Notably, HDL-cholesterol levels were significantly increased in the SWP-L group compared to the OVX group. Serum estradiol concentrations were elevated in all the SWP groups, with significant increases in the high-dose group. These findings indicate that SWP may promote the activation of estrogen receptor signaling and improve symptoms associated with estrogen deficiency during menopause.

Their roles in physiological mechanisms are essential for maintaining life quality. This study aimed to evaluate hawthorn vinegar’s metabolic effects, and describe its possible mechanism. We also pointed out several vinegar production methods to clarify the antioxidant features. (2) Methods: In the study, three vinegar techniques were applied to vinegar: traditional production of hawthorn vinegar (N), thermal pasteurization (P), and ultrasound method (U). Thirty-two female adult Wistar albino rats were randomly separated into four groups: Control, N1 (regular vinegar; 1 mL/kg bw), P1 (pasteurized vinegar; 1 mL/kg bw), and U1(ultrasound treated vinegar; 1 mL/kg bw). Vinegar was administered by oral gavage daily for 45 days. Initial and final weights, the percentage changes of body weight gains, and Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) values of plasma and liver were measured. The total protein, globulin, and albumin values of plasma, liver, and intestinal tissue were determined. In addition, plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose concentrations were evaluated. (3) Results: There was a statistical increase in total intestinal protein value and an increasing tendency in total protein in plasma and liver in group U1 compared to group Control. However, the GGT concentrations in plasma and liver were slightly lower in group U1 than in group Control. In addition, there were significant increases in plasma GLP-1 values in all experimental groups compared to the Control group (p: 0.015; 576.80 ± 56.06, 773.10 ± 28.92, 700.70 ± 17.05 and 735.00 ± 40.70; respectively groups control, N1, P1, and U1). Also, liver GLP-1 concentrations in groups P1 and U1 were higher than in group Control (p: 0.005; 968.00 ± 25.54, 1176 ± 17.54 and 1174.00 ± 44.06, respectively groups control, P1 and U1). On the other hand, significant decreases were found in plasma glucose concentrations in groups N1 and U1 as to the Control group (p: 0.02; Control: 189.90 ± 15.22, N1: 133.10 ± 7.32 and U1: 142.30 ± 4.14). Besides, liver glucose levels were lower in all experimental groups than in group Control statistically (p: 0.010; 53.47 ± 0.97, 37.99 ± 1.46, 44.52 ± 4.05 and 44.57 ± 2.39, respectively groups control, N1, P1, and U1). (4) Conclusions: The findings suggest that hawthorn vinegar can balance normal physiological conditions via intestinal health, protein profiles, and glycemic control. Additionally, ultrasound application of vinegar may improve the ability of hawthorn vinegar, and have positive effects on general health.

This text explores these impacts through the lens of developmental psychopathology, which integrates clinical psychology and developmental science to examine the emergence and evolution of psychological disorders across a lifespan. This paper highlights how pandemic-related disruptions have exacerbated conditions such as anxiety and depression and, notably, increased childhood obesity due to changes in lifestyle and reductions in physical activity. The analysis includes a discussion of how isolation has not only restricted access to educational and psychological resources but also increased the risk of parental mental illness and related familial stress, thereby intensifying issues of neglect and their consequent impact on child health. By employing a developmental psychopathology framework, this paper argues for the necessity of targeted interventions that address these complex interplays of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Such interventions aim to support children through structured educational and health-oriented strategies, ensuring their well-being amidst the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic. This approach underscores the importance of early, multifaceted strategies involving parents, educators, and healthcare providers to foster healthier developmental outcomes for children facing unprecedented global health crises.

If uncontrolled, the imbalance between energy intake and expenditure results in obesity development and increased morbidity and mortality risk. Although measures of energy requirements for accurate nutrition assessment are vital, the evidence appears sparse and heterogeneous; hence, the aim of this review was to examine the available literature on energy expenditure predicted or measured using various methods in individuals with PWS. Studies were sought that presented methods and results on resting energy expenditure or basal metabolic rate. A narrative synthesis was completed to present the study characteristics and results. Methods of determining energy requirements included predictive equations and indirect calorimetry. Differences amongst ages, growth hormone therapy, fasting status, and measures in which results were presented were limitations to appropriately summarising and identifying trends in energy expenditure. Indirect calorimetry was identified as the most accurate method; however, it is not widely available in all settings. Further research is encouraged to support the development of valid and reliable predictive equations that will better inform and improve the efficiency of clinical practice in supporting people with PWS.

MAFLD is associated with obesity and can be evaluated by validated formulas to assess MAFLD risk using different parameters such as the body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). However, these parameters do not accurately measure body fat. As MAFLD is strongly associated with obesity, we hypothesize that measuring body and visceral fat by electrical bioimpedance is an efficient method to predict the risk of MAFLD. The objective of our work was to demonstrate that electrical bioimpedance is a more efficient method than the BMI or WC to predict an elevated risk of MAFLD. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive study involving 8590 Spanish workers in the Balearic Islands was carried out. The study’s sample of employees was drawn from those who underwent occupational medicine examinations between January 2019 and December 2020. Five MAFLD risk scales were determined for evaluating very high levels of body fat and visceral fat. The determination of body and visceral fat was performed using bioimpedanciometry. Student’s t-test was employed to ascertain the mean and standard deviation of quantitative data. The chi-square test was used to find prevalences for qualitative variables, while ROC curves were used to define the cut-off points for body and visceral fat. The calculations included the area under the curve (AUC), the cut-off points along with their Youden index, sensitivity, and specificity. Correlation and concordance between the various scales were determined using Pearson’s correlation index and Cohen’s kappa, respectively. Results: As both total body fat and visceral fat increase, the risk of MAFLD increases with a statistically significant result (p < 0.001), presenting a higher risk in men. The areas under the curve (AUC) of the five scales that assess overweight and obesity to determine the occurrence of high values of the different MAFLD risk scales were very high, most of them exceeding 0.9. These AUC values were higher for visceral and body fat than for the BMI or waist circumference. FLD-high presented the best results in men and women with the AUC at around 0.97, both for visceral fat and total body fat, with a high Youden index in all cases (women body fat = 0.830, visceral fat = 0.892; men body fat = 0.780, visceral fat = 0.881). Conclusions: In our study, all the overweight and obesity scales show a very good association with the scales assessing the risk of MAFLD. These values are higher for visceral and body fat than for waist circumference and the BMI. Both visceral fat and body fat are better associated than the BMI and waist circumference with MAFLD risk scales.

However, in China, the prevalence of obesity is 14.1%, and it remains challenging to achieve weight loss or resolve this issue through clinical interventions. Sanghuangpours vaninii (SPV) is a nutritional fungus with multiple pharmacological activities and serves as an ideal dietary intervention for combating obesity. In this study, a long-term high-fat diet (HFD) was administered to induce obesity in mice. Different doses of SPV and the positive drug simvastatin (SV) were administered to mice to explore their potential anti-obesity effects. SPV regulated weight, serum lipids, and adipocyte size while inhibiting inflammation and hepatic steatosis. Compared with the vehicle-treated HFD-fed mice, the lowest decreases in total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were 9.72%, 9.29%, and 12.29%, respectively, and the lowest increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was 5.88% after treatment with different doses of SPV. With SPV treatment, the analysis of gut microbiota and serum lipids revealed a significant association between lipids and inflammation-related factors, specifically sphingomyelin. Moreover, Western blotting results showed that SPV regulated the toll-like receptor (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway in HFD-diet mice, which is related to inflammation and lipid metabolism. This research presents empirical proof of the impact of SPV therapy on obesity conditions.

However, evidence for subclinical markers of cardiovascular disease, such as arterial stiffness, is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the associations between adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD), as assessed by the MEDAS-14 questionnaire, and arterial stiffness, as assessed by aortic pulse wave velocity, in healthy adults and according to sex. (2) A cross-sectional study including 386 healthy participants was performed in the EVasCu study. Adjusted and unadjusted differences in adherence to the MD and arterial stiffness were determined using Student’s t test and ANCOVA for the total sample and according to sex. (3) Results: Our results showed that individuals with a high adherence to the MD had a greater arterial stiffness, both in the total sample and in females, although this difference was not significant after adjusting for possible confounding variables, such as age. (4) Conclusions: Our findings indicated that, in the unadjusted analyses, healthy subjects with a high adherence to the MD showed a greater arterial stiffness. When these analyses were adjusted, no significant differences were shown in a-PWv according to the categories of MD adherence.

This study investigates the water consumption patterns and estimated water balance among women, practicing exclusive, mixed, and no breastfeeding methods. Methods: 529 healthy women completed the Nursing Water Balanced Questionnaire (N-WBQ). Participants were distributed across breastfeeding groups as follows: exclusive (39.7%), mixed (31.9%), and no breastfeeding (28.4%). Results: Significant differences were noted in water consumption patterns among breastfeeding groups regarding intake from beverages (p < 0.001), juices (p = 0.019), coffee (p < 0.001), and milk (p = 0.015). Water intake from liquids, except for drinking water (p < 0.001), juices (p = 0.024) and coffee (p < 0.001) differed significantly among groups in women with adequate total water intake based on recommendation, with exclusive breastfeeding mothers prioritizing plain water over other beverages. Total water loss (p < 0.001) and estimated water balance (p < 0.001) significantly varied among breastfeeding groups, with exclusive breastfeeding mothers to exhibit the lowest water balance (−475.36 mL/day), indicating potential dehydration risk. Apart from plain water, water from foods, coffee and milk significantly contributed to positive water balance. Conclusions: Our findings highlight a risk of dehydration in this population, while water consumption patterns are influenced by breastfeeding method, likely affected by varying lactational demands and lifestyle factors. Further research to develop more accurate and individualized methods for assessing water balance in breastfeeding women is needed.

The processes of lipoprotein assembly, secretion, transportation, modification, and clearance are crucial components of maintaining a healthy lipid metabolism. Disruption in any of these steps results in pathophysiological abnormalities such as dyslipidemia, obesity, insulin resistance, inflammation, atherosclerosis, peripheral artery disease, and cardiovascular diseases. By studying these genetic mutations, researchers can gain valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms that govern the relationship between protein structure and its physiological role. These lipoproteins, including HDL, LDL, lipoprotein(a), and VLDL, mainly serve the purpose of transporting lipids between tissues and organs. However, studies have provided evidence that apo(a) also possesses protective properties against pathogens. In the future, the field of study will be significantly influenced by the integration of recombinant DNA technology and human site-specific mutagenesis for treating hereditary disorders. Several medications are available for the treatment of dyslipoproteinemia. These include statins, fibrates, ezetimibe, niacin, PCSK9 inhibitors, evinacumab, DPP 4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists GLP1RAs, GLP-1, and GIP dual receptor agonists, in addition to SGLT2 inhibitors.

Recently, there has been considerable interest in the beneficial properties of wholegrains due to their content of phytochemicals, particularly polyphenols. Despite this, the existing data on polyphenolic composition of cereal-based foods reported in the most comprehensive databases are still not updated. Many cereal-based foods and phenolic compounds are missing, including pigmented ones. Observational epidemiological studies reporting the intake of polyphenols from cereals are limited and inconsistent, although experimental studies suggest a protective role for dietary polyphenols against cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Estimating polyphenol intake is complex because of the large number of compounds present in foods and the many factors that affect their levels, such as plant variety, harvest season, food processing and cooking, making it difficult matching consumption data with data on food composition. Further, it should be taken into account that food composition tables and consumed foods are categorized in different ways. The present work provides an overview of the available data on polyphenols content reported in several existing databases, in terms of presence, missing and no data, and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of methods for assessing cereal polyphenol consumption. Furthermore, this review suggests a greater need for the inclusion of most up-to-date cereal food composition data and for the harmonization of standardized procedures in collecting cereal-based food data and adequate assessment tools for dietary intake.

Based on the China birth cohort study (CBCS), we aimed to explore maternal weight gain in different groups. Methods: Singleton pregnancies of 6 + 0~13 + 6 weeks of gestation from the CBCS were considered, not including missing data or outliers, those lost at follow-up, or those with non-typical conditions of the offspring. Maternal first-trimester weight and body mass index (BMI) gain was considered as the early pregnancy weight minus the pre-pregnancy weight. Using Pearson’s or Spearman’s correlation and linear regression models to explore the relationship between maternal weight and BMI gain and gestational age (GA), stratified and sensitivity analyses were carried out to identify the study’s robustness. Results: There were 25,292 singleton pregnancies with healthy live offspring who were ultimately enrolled, and there was a linear correlation between GA and maternal weight gain (=0.55 + 0.05 × GA (weeks), p < 0.001, r2 = 0.002) and BMI change (=0.21 + 0.02 × GA (weeks), p < 0.001, r2 = 0.002). The association remained robust in the stratified and sensitivity analyses of the subgroups. Conclusions: Although the association between GA and maternal pre-pregnancy weight and BMI gain is weak, a slight correlation was shown, especially in pregnant women with a typical or low pre-pregnancy BMI, Han ethnicity, moderate levels of physical activity, natural conception, and folic acid (FA) and/or multivitamin supplementation.

Three-day 24 h dietary recall and household weighing were used, complemented by “Chinese Food Composition” data. Household water and salt samples were collected from 5890 residents and analyzed. Differences in iodized salt consumption rates were observed across the following regions: inland (84.20%), subcoastal (67.80%), and coastal (37.00%) areas. The median (P25, P75) iodine concentration in water and diet were 2.2 (0.9, 4.0) μg/L and 142.05 (58.94, 237.11) μg/d, respectively, with significant regional differences in dietary concentration (inland [185.61 μg/d], subcoastal [153.42 μg/d], and coastal [75.66 μg/d]). Males (149.99 μg/d) and iodized salt consumers (191.98 μg/d) had a significantly higher dietary iodine intake than their counterparts. Regions were ranked as follows based on the proportions of individuals meeting the recommended dietary iodine intake: inland (69.40%), subcoastal (56.50%), and coastal (34.10%) areas. Dietary sources included salt (48.54%), other foods (32.06%), drinking water (8.84%), laver (4.82%), kelp (3.02%), and other seafood (2.32%). The qualified iodized salt consumption rate was significantly lower than the national standard. Zhejiang Province should continue implementing measures to control iodine deficiency through salt iodization, education efforts, and increasing the qualified iodized salt consumption rate.

Chios mastic gum (CMG), derived from Pistacia lentiscus var. Chia, shows potential as a phytotherapeutic agent, due to its multifaceted beneficial effects. However, its anti-hypertensive effects and vascular, circulatory, and renal-related dysfunction, have not been thoroughly investigated. Herein, we aimed to explore the antihypertensive potential of CMG, focusing on vascular and renal endothelium, in vivo. Methods: Two models of hypertension in male rats, induced by Angiotensin II and Deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)–high-salt administration, were utilized. CMG was administered at 220 mg/kg daily for four weeks after hypertension onset and blood pressure was measured non-invasively. Whole blood RNA sequencing, metabolomics, real-time PCR, and Western blot analyses of kidney and aorta tissues were additionally performed. Results: CMG significantly lowered systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure in both models. RNA sequencing revealed that CMG modulated immunity in the Angiotensin II model and metabolism in the DOCA–HS model. CMG downregulated genes related to oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction and upregulated endothelial markers such as Vegfa. Metabolomic analysis indicated improved endothelial homeostasis via lysophosphatidylinositol upregulation. Conclusions: CMG emerges as a potent natural antihypertensive therapy, demonstrating beneficial effects on blood pressure and renal endothelial function.

The polysaccharide fraction 30 is purified from the rhizome of A. officinarum Hance (AOP30) and shows excellent immunoregulatory ability when administered to regulate immunity. However, the effect of AOP30 on the intestinal epithelial barrier is not well understood. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the protective effect of AOP30 on the intestinal epithelial barrier using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction model and further explore its underlying mechanisms. Cytotoxicity, transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) values, and Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–dextran flux are measured. Simultaneously, the protein and mRNA levels of tight junction (TJ) proteins, including zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), Occludin, and Claudin-1, are determined using Western blotting and reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction methods, respectively. The results indicate that AOP30 restores the LPS-induced decrease in the TEER value and cell viability. Furthermore, it increases the mRNA and protein expression of ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1. Notably, ZO-1 is the primary tight junction protein altered in response to LPS-induced intestinal epithelial dysfunction. Additionally, AOP30 downregulates the production of TNFα via the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/NF-κB signaling pathway. Collectively, the findings of this study indicate that AOP30 can be developed as a functional food ingredient or natural therapeutic agent for addressing intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction. It sheds light on the role of AOP30 in improving intestinal epithelial function.

Insufficient levels can lead to complications and can affect foetal development. This study investigated omega-3 status and its relation to dietary intake in pregnant Latvian women, along with its impact on gestational duration and newborn birth weight. Methods: The study comprised 250 pregnant and postpartum women with a mean age of 31.6 ± 4.8 years. Nutrition and omega-3 supplementation data were collected through a questionnaire covering 199 food items and 12 supplements. Fatty acids in erythrocyte membrane phospholipids were analysed via gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. Results: The median omega-3 fatty acid intake, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and DHA from diet and supplements, was 0.370 g/day, which is deemed sufficient. However, the median weekly fish intake (126.0 g) and daily nut/seed intake (7.4 g) were insufficient. The median omega-3 supplement intake was 1.0 g/day. No correlation between omega-3 supplement intake and the omega-3 index was observed. There was a weak correlation between the DHA intake from fish and the omega-3 index (r = 0.126, p = 0.047), while a significant correlation between the total EPA and DHA intake from various sources and the omega-3 index was noted (r = 0.163, p = 0.01). Most women (61.6%) had an omega-3 index < 4%, while 34.8% had an index between 4 and 8%, and only 3.6% had an index > 8%. Notably, significant differences in EPA levels and the omega-3 index were found among respondents with differing infant birth weights (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The omega-3 intake during pregnancy adheres to the established guidelines, although fish consumption remains insufficient. A preconception evaluation of the omega-3 index is advocated to optimize prenatal intake. The indications suggest potential correlations between EPA levels, the omega-3 index, and infant birth weight.

This study assessed the effectiveness of nutritional supplementation in reducing stunting among children under five years old in two rural districts in Sindh, Pakistan. This was a mixed-method quasi-experimental study comprising intervention and control populations, with 3397 and 3277 children under five years old participating in the baseline and end-line surveys, respectively. The study areas were similar in terms of demographic and economic circumstances. In the intervention group, pregnant and lactating women (first six months post-partum) received wheat soy blend, children 6–23 months old received Wawamum (lipid-based supplement), and children 24–59 months old received micronutrient powders, all through lady health workers. This was underpinned by nutrition behaviour change communication for appropriate complementary feeding practices and hygiene promotion targeted at primary caregivers. The control group received no intervention. The impact was assessed using the difference-in-difference analysis with kernel propensity score matching to adjust the differences among the control and intervention populations. The overall DID analysis indicated that the intervention did not significantly reduce the prevalence of stunting (under 5 years) [DID = −5.1, p = 0.079]. The adjusted DID indicated a significant decrease of 13% [DID = −13.0, p = 0.001] in the number of stunted children 24–59 months of age at the endline survey. A significant reduction in underweight among children 24–59 months old was also observed (DID = −9.4%, p = 0.014). In conclusion, this evidence further establishes that nutrient uptake through an intervention for a short duration cannot effectively reduce stunting. It requires continuous nutritional supplementation for mothers during the pregnancy and an initial six months of lactation and then nutritional supplementation for children 6–59 months of age underpinned by effective behaviour change communication targeting mothers and other caregivers for improving complementary feeding practices and hygiene promotion.

Alleviating gastric disorders attributed to alcohol-induced thinning of the mucus layer has centered on enhancing mucin secretion as a pivotal approach. In this study, foxtail millet bran polyphenol BPIS was divided into two components with MW < 200 D and MW > 200 D by molecular interception technology. Combined with MTT, cell morphology observation, and trypan blue staining, isoferulic acid (IFA) within the MW < 200 D fraction was determined as the effective constituent to mitigate ethanol-induced damage of gastric epithelial cells. Furthermore, a Wistar rat model with similar clinical features to alcohol-induced gastric mucosal injury was established. Then, gastric morphological observation, H&E staining, and assessments of changes in gastric hexosamine content and gastric wall binding mucus levels were carried out, and the results revealed that IFA (10 mg/Kg) significantly ameliorated alcohol-induced gastric mucosal damage. Finally, we applied techniques including Co-IP, molecular docking, and fluorescence spectroscopy and found that IFA inhibited the alcohol-induced downregulation of N-acetylgalactosamintransferase 2 (GALNT2) activity related to mucus synthesis through direct interaction with GALNT2 in gastric epithelial cells, thus promoting mucin synthesis. Our study lays a foundation for whole grain dietary intervention tailored to individuals suffering from alcoholic gastric mucosal injury.

However, other factors, such as adipokines and inflammation markers, may also be associated with GWG. The aim of the study was to determine the association of leptin, adiponectin, irisin, and C-reactive protein, with GWG in adolescents. A longitudinal study was conducted from 2018 to 2023 in adolescents with a clinically healthy pregnancy. The assessments included sociodemographic and clinical data, pBMI, percent of body fat, serum concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, irisin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and total GWG adequacy. Cox regression models were performed, the outcome variables were inadequate and excessive GWG. In 198 participants, being overweight/obesity was marginally associated with a protective effect against inadequate GWG (HR = 0.44, 95%CI = 0.18–1.06), regardless of maternal characteristics and adipokines. Leptin (HR = 1.014, 95%CI = 1.008–1.021), and body fat percent (HR = 1.11, 95%CI = 1.05–1.17) were associated with a higher risk of excessive GWG, independent of other maternal variables such as pBMI, while adiponectin was associated with a lower risk. These findings suggest that, in Mexican adolescents, adipose tissue and its adipokines during pregnancy may play a more significant role in the final GWG than body weight.

Most participants advise about the choking risk associated with baby-led weaning (BLW) and more than 60% consider that infants can receive an insufficient variety and quantity of nutrients with this practice. The general opinion is that there is a lack of evidence for delaying the introduction of gluten and other allergenic foods in the complementary feeding of healthy infants. Most participants agree/strongly agree that two servings of dairy products are the adequate daily amount in a diversified diet and 93.4% disagree/strongly disagree with the use of vegetal beverages under 1 year of life. There is a general agreement to avoid added salt and sugar before 12 months of life, the consideration that organic foods do not have a better nutritional profile than non-organic ones, and the limitations of vegetarian diets especially for adequate provision of micronutrients. Overall, there is an adequate knowledge of the new trends by paediatricians and younger ones seemed more in favor of them and interested in receiving more information on most topics.

High-dose vitD supplementation is suggested to improve pregnancy health, but there is limited knowledge about the effects on placental vitD transport and metabolism and the vitD status of newborns. Comparing the current standard maternal supplementation, 10 µg/day to a 90 µg vitD supplement, we investigated placental gene expression, maternal vitD transport and neonatal vitD status. Biological material was obtained from pregnant women randomized to 10 µg or 90 µg vitD supplements from week 11–16 onwards. Possible associations between maternal exposure, neonatal vitD status and placental expression of the vitD receptor (VDR), the transporters (Cubilin, CUBN and Megalin, LRP2) and the vitD-activating and -degrading enzymes (CYP24A1, CYP27B1) were investigated. Maternal vitD-binding protein (VDBP) was determined before and after supplementation. Overall, 51% of neonates in the 10 µg vitD group were vitD-deficient in contrast to 11% in the 90 µg group. High-dose vitD supplementation did not significantly affect VDBP or placental gene expression. However, the descriptive analyses indicate that maternal obesity may lead to the differential expression of CUBN, CYP24A1 and CYP27B1 and a changed VDBP response. High-dose vitD improves neonatal vitD status without affecting placental vitD regulation.
