Haddad syndrome is CCHS with Hirschsprung's disease. We report a newborn with Haddad syndrome that had a family history of spinal muscular atrophy and discuss aspects of CCHS and important considerations in the evaluation of apnea in the term newborn.\n\nSyndromic Hirschsprung's disease and associated congenital heart disease: a systematic review.\n\nPubMed\n\nDuess, Johannes W; Puri, Prem\n\n2015-08-01\n\nHirschsprung's disease (HD) occurs as an isolated phenotype in 70% of infants and is associated with additional congenital anomalies or syndromes in approximately 30% of patients. The cardiac development depends on neural crest cell proliferation and is closely related to the formation of the enteric nervous system. HD associated with congenital heart disease (CHD) has been reported in 5-8% of cases, with septation defects being the most frequently recorded abnormalities. However, the prevalence of HD associated with CHD in infants with syndromic disorders is not well documented. This systematic review was designed to determine the prevalence of CHD in syndromic HD. A systematic review of the literature using the keywords \"Hirschsprung's disease\", \"aganglionosis\", \"congenital megacolon\", \"congenital heart disease\" and \"congenital heart defect\" was performed. Resulting publications were reviewed for epidemiology and morbidity. Reference lists were screened for additional relevant studies. A total of fifty-two publications from 1963 to 2014 reported data on infants with HD associated with CHD. The overall reported prevalence of HD associated with CHD in infants without chromosomal disorders was 3%. In infants with syndromic disorders, the overall prevalence of HD associated with CHD ranged from 20 to 80 % (overall prevalence 51%). Septation defects were recorded in 57% (atrial septal defects in 29%, ventricular septal defects in 32%), a patent ductus arteriosus in 39%, vascular abnormalities in 16%, valvular heart defects in 4% and Tetralogy of Fallot in 7%. The prevalence of HD associated with CHD is much higher in infants with chromosomal disorders compared to infants without associated syndromes. A routine echocardiogram should be performed in all infants with syndromic HD to exclude cardiac abnormalities.\n\nHirschsprung disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaricharan, Ramanath N; Georgeson, Keith E\n\n2008-11-01\n\nHirschsprung disease is a relatively common condition managed by pediatric surgeons. Significant advances have been made in understanding its etiologies in the last decade, especially with the explosion of molecular genetic techniques and early diagnosis. The surgical management has progressed from a two- or three-stage procedure to a primary operation. More recently, definitive surgery for Hirschsprung disease through minimally invasive techniques has gained popularity. In neonates, the advancement of treatment strategies for Hirschsprung disease continues with reduced patient morbidity and improved outcomes.\n\nA family with unusual Waardenburg syndrome type I (WSI), cleft lip (palate), and Hirschsprung disease is not linked to PAX 3.\n\nPubMed\n\nPierpont, J W; St Jacques, D; Seaver, L H; Erickson, R P\n\n1995-03-01\n\nAn unusual family with Waardenburg syndrome type 1 (WSI), cleft lip (palate), and Hirschsprung disease is not linked to the PAX 3 gene since there is an obligate crossover which has occurred between PAX 3 DNA markers and the disorder in this family. This family may also have anticipation of the WSI traits as the proband's grandmother is nonpenetrant, his mother has dystopia canthorum, and severe cleft lip (palate), while the proband has dystopia canthorum, severe cleft lip (palate), and Hirschsprung disease. Thus, a locus other than PAX 3 is implicated in this Waardenburg-like syndrome with Hirschsprung disease and cleft lip (palate).\n\nHirschsprung disease and hepatoblastoma: case report of a rare association.\n\nPubMed\n\nPinto, Raquel Borges; Ramos, Ana Regina Lima; Backes, Ariane Nadia; Santos, Beatriz John Dos; Provenzi, Valentina Oliveira; Carbonera, MÃ¡rio Rafael; Roenick, Maria LÃºcia; Santos, Pedro Paulo Albino Dos; Falhauber, Fabrizia; Souza, Meriene Viquetti de; Bassols, JoÃ£o Vicente; ArtigalÃ¡s, Osvaldo\n\n2016-04-01\n\nHirschsprung disease is a developmental disorder of the enteric nervous system that is characterized by absence of ganglion cells in the distal intestine, and it occurs in approximately 1 in every 500,000 live births. Hepatoblastoma is a malignant liver neoplasm that usually occurs in children aged 6 months to 3 years, with a prevalence of 0.54 cases per 100,000. A boy diagnosed with intestinal atresia in the first week of life progressed to a diagnosis of comorbid Hirschsprung disease. Congenital cataracts and sensorineural deafness were diagnosed. A liver mass developed and was subsequently confirmed to be a hepatoblastoma, which was treated by means of surgical resection of 70% of the liver volume and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (ifosfamide, cisplatin and doxorubicin). It is known that Hirschsprung disease may be associated with syndromes predisposing towards cancer, and that hepatoblastoma may also be associated with certain congenital syndromes. However, co-occurrence of hepatoblastoma and Hirschsprung disease has not been previously described. We have reported a case of a male patient born with ileal atresia, Hirschsprung disease and bilateral congenital cataract who was later diagnosed with hepatoblastoma.\n\nA de novo SOX10 mutation causing severe type 4 Waardenburg syndrome without Hirschsprung disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nSznajer, Yves; ColdÃ©a, Cristina; Meire, FranÃ§oise; Delpierre, Isabelle; Sekhara, Tayeb; Touraine, Renaud L\n\n2008-04-15\n\nType 4 Waardenburg syndrome represents a well define entity caused by neural crest derivatives anomalies (melanocytes, intrinsic ganglion cells, central, autonomous and peripheral nervous systems) leading, with variable expressivity, to pigmentary anomalies, deafness, mental retardation, peripheral neuropathy, and Hirschsprung disease. Autosomal dominant mode of inheritance is prevalent when Sox10 gene mutation is identified. We report the natural history of a child who presented with synophrys, vivid blue eye, deafness, bilateral complete semicircular canals agenesis with mental retardation, subtle signs for peripheral neuropathy and lack of Hirschsprung disease. SOX10 gene sequencing identified \"de novo\" splice site mutation (c.698-2A > C). The present phenotype and the genotype findings underline the wide spectrum of SOX10 gene implication in unusual type 4 Waardenburg syndrome patient.

Third child born at full-term to a non-consanguineous couple through normal delivery without complications, with appropriate weight and length for gestational age. Soon after birth he started to show bradypnea, bradycardia and cyanosis, being submitted to tracheal intubation and started empiric antibiotic therapy for suspected early neonatal sepsis. During hospitalization in the NICU, he showed difficulty to undergo extubation due to episodes of desaturation during sleep and wakefulness. He had recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, abdominal distension, leukocytosis, increase in C-reactive protein levels, with negative blood cultures and suspected inborn error of metabolism. At 2 months of age he was diagnosed with long-segment Hirschsprung's disease and was submitted to segment resection and colostomy through Hartmann's procedure. A genetic research was performed by polymerase chain reaction for CCHS screening, which showed the mutated allele of PHOX2B gene, confirming the diagnosis. This is a rare genetic, autosomal dominant disease, caused by mutation in PHOX2B gene, located in chromosome band 4p12, which results in autonomic nervous system dysfunction. CCHS can also occur with Hirschsprung's disease and tumors derived from the neural crest. There is a correlation between phenotype and genotype, as well as high intrafamilial phenotypic variability. In the neonatal period it can simulate cases of sepsis and inborn errors of metabolism. Copyright Â© 2015 Sociedade de Pediatria de SÃ£o Paulo. Publicado por Elsevier Editora Ltda.

In one patient there was a classic presentation with constipation, in another Hirschsprung's disease coexisted, and in the third the initial inadequate suction rectal biopsy specimen was suggestive of Hirschsprung's disease on acetylcholinesterase staining. Evidence of hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the intermuscular and submucosal plexuses on a full thickness bowel biopsy specimen was used to confirm the diagnosis of hyperganglionosis, suggested by the characteristic demonstration of moderate increase in the number of acetylcholinesterase stained nerve fibres in the lamina propria mucosae on rectal biopsy. Surgical management was guided by clinical signs. Two patients had colonic resections; the third had temporary stomal diversion. Hyperganglionosis is rarer than Hirschsprung's disease but is known to mimic it. We suggest full thickness bowel specimens are needed to confirm the diagnosis and that inadequate rectal suction biopsies must be interpreted with caution.

The rectal ampulla is empty and the abdomen is filled with fecal masses. Pain is not prominent. Flatus is passed in large amounts. Encopresis does not occur. Barium enema shows the characteristic narrowed distal rectal segment and biopsy of the rectum shows absence of the ganglion cells of the myenteric plexus. Treatment is operative resection of the distal narrow segment and a primary anastomosis. Hirschsprung's disease may be mimicked in children with: 1. Psychogenic constipationâpseudo-Hirschsprung's disease. Unlike Hirschsprung's disease, symptoms do not appear at birth, encopresis is common, and the barium enema shows no narrow distal segment. 2. Mental retardation and cerebral defect. 3. Corrected imperforate anusâon the basis of stenosis, imperfect innervation or poor habit training. 4. Cretinismâwith severe constipation and intestinal dilatation perhaps the presenting symptoms. Treatment of these four groups of children with severe constipation not due to Hirschsprung's disease is: For Group 1, open discussion with parent and child. Assumption by the physician of full control of the details of treatment, and relegation of parent to the role of the physician's agent in following the prescribed regimen. For Group 2, an enema regimen. Whereas fairly rapid restoration (and then persistence) of normal bowel habit can be expected in Group 1, the basic defects in Group 2 may require indefinite continuation of treatment. For Group 3, regular enema regimen, in the less severe casesâone identical with that used in Group 1, and dilatation of strictures or anoplasty. In Group 4, thyroid hormone therapy relieves the constipation of hypothyroidism and causes reversion of radiographic changes in the colon and rectum.

In donor infants with TTTS and symptoms of intestinal obstruction, small-bowel lesions have been reported in most cases. We report on a 33(+6) gestational wk donor infant with TTTS who had intermittent obstructive episodes, including delayed meconium passage and colonic dilatation on abdominal X-ray. The diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease was based on a lateral pelvic film with a reversed rectosigmoid ratio. A subsequent barium colon study and rectal suction biopsy indicated a short segment aganglionosis of the colon.\n\nHirschsprung disease\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

We present the first family with CS-HD. Case 1: A 28-year-old woman was admitted with severe abdominal distension and dyspnea. She was diagnosed with anal stenosis, hemisacrum, anterior sacral meningocele (ASM), tethered cord (TC), and short-segment aganglionosis. She underwent the modified Duhamel operation after meningocele repair and cord detethering. A bicornuate uterus, bilateral ovarian dermoid cysts, and small rectal duplication were also noted intraoperatively. Case 2: The daughter of case 1 was admitted for abdominal distension and anal stenosis at the age of 17 days. Studies revealed a hemisacrum, ASM, TC, presacral mass, atrial septal defect, polyp in the right nasal cavity, right vesicoureteral reflux, and short-segment aganglionosis. She underwent the modified Soave operation at the age of 1 year and 4 months after meningocele repair, cord detethering, and resection of the presacral mass (epidermoid cyst). In both cases, the aganglionic segments were confirmed by preoperative rectal suction biopsy and postoperative pathological examination on full-thickness rectal specimens. Some causal genes for Currarino syndrome (CS) and Hirschsprung disease (HD) are currently investigated. Thus far, 10 CS-HD cases have been reported, including 6 cases of familial CS. However, all the patients had sporadic HD. Recent reports suggest that anomalies of the enteric nerve system contribute to postoperative constipation in CS cases. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, this procedure is limited with only hematoxylin and eosin staining, especially in biopsies of premature babies or when non-expert pathologists make the evaluation. The immunohistochemistry from ganglia cell calretinin has been used to reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Our objective was to show the benefits of this antibody in diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease in biopsy specimens. Methods: we evaluated patients with histopathological diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease made by hematoxylin and eosin staining. We determined if there was enough paraffin block for immunohistochemistry with two markers: calretinin and neurofilaments. Three controls of autopsy of children under 3 years of age with other diagnosis were included. Results: of a total of 48 cases with histopathological diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease only 13 had adequate tissue for immunohistochemistry. The immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis in nine cases. In the other four cases there were initial misdiagnosis due to evidence of calretinin (ganglion cells) and, thus, Hirschsprung's disease was discarded. Conclusions: the use of immunohistochemistry allows confirming the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease and reduce the risk of a false-positive result with only hematoxylin and eosin staining.\n\nHirschsprung's disease: A bridge for science and surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nTam, Paul K H\n\n2016-01-01\n\nUnderstanding the true nature of the disease provided the basis for appropriate surgery for Hirschsprung's disease some 60 years ago. Nevertheless, surgical outcome remains unsatisfactory. Advances in diagnosis and treatment will depend on the elucidation of the pathogenesis and disease heterogeneity. This lecture outlines the author's attempt in the past 30 years to bridge some of the gaps of knowledge in Hirschsprung's disease. Studies of human fetal gut and aganglionic gut gave insight into the complexity of the human enteric nervous system, but the more fruitful studies came from genetic studies in which disease-causing genes were discovered, and the importance of noncoding mutations conferring disease susceptibility was unraveled. Animal models and pluripotent stem cell studies allowed elucidation of the interacting gene-cell-microenvironment signaling pathways for neural crest proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Hirschsprung's disease has been a bridge for science and surgery. An integrative approach could provide breakthroughs in the diagnosis and treatment strategies of this complex condition, leading to improved outcome. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Eleven additional relatives had signs of WS2 without HSCR. Since HSCR and WS2 each represent perturbations of neural crest migration/differentiation, this large pedigree with apparent cosegregation of HSCR and WS2 offered an opportunity to search for linkage between these loci, candidate genes, and random DNA markers, particularly in view of recent discoveries of genes for Waardenburg syndrome type I (WS1) and Hirschsprung disease (c-ret). We have examined themoreÂ Â» following possible linked markers in 69 relatives in this family: the c-ret gene (HSCR); the human PAX3 gene (HuP2) on chromosome 2q (WS1) and placental alkaline phosphatase (ALPP) on chromosome 2q (linked to WS1); argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) on chromosome 9q, close to ABO blood groups which have shown weak linkage to WS; and the {beta}1 GABA receptor gene (GABARB1) on chromosome 4q13-11, close to c-kit, deletions of which cause piebaldism. Linkage between any of these loci and HSCR/WS in this kindred was excluded, demonstrating that there is at least one further locus for HSCR other than c-ret. 45 refs., 1 fig., 3 tabs.Â«Â less\n\nUrinary Outcomes in Patients with Down's Syndrome and Hirschsprung's Disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nDingemans, Alexander Johannes Martinus; Reck-Burneo, Carlos Albert; Fuchs, Molly; Sanchez, Alejandra Vilanova; Lane, Victoria Alison; Hoover, Erin; Maloof, Tassiana; Weaver, Laura; Levitt, Marc A; Wood, Richard J\n\n2018-06-17\n\nâPrevious research in children with Hirschsprung's disease (HD) and Down's syndrome (DS) has focused on colorectal outcomes. We set out to review urinary outcomes in this patient group. âThe medical records of all patients aged five years and older with HD were reviewed, and patients and caregivers filled out the Vancouver Symptom Score at intake, which is designed and validated to diagnose dysfunctional elimination syndrome. âA total of 104 patients with HD were included in this study. Of these, 16 (15%) patients had DS. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of enterocolitis or colorectal symptoms between patients with or without DS. Five of 88 (6%) patients without DS and 7 of 16 (44%) ( p â=â0.00001) with DS reported having urinary accidents. Patients with HD and DS scored higher on the Vancouver score (9 vs. 17.5; p â=â0.007), indicating more severe urinary symptoms. Patients who also reported fecal accidents scored significantly higher on the Vancouver (12 vs. 9; n â=â61; p â=â0.016), indicating more problems. âPatients with DS appear to be a unique subset of HD patients who have a higher prevalence of urinary symptoms after surgery. In the postoperative care of patients with HD and DS, a strong focus should be placed on postoperative urinary care in addition to their bowel care. This could significantly ease care and contribute to the quality of life of the parents and the patient.

However, some children experience long-term postoperative complications comprising stooling disorders, such as intermittent enterocolitis, severe stool retention, intestinal obstruction, as well as incontinence. Reoperative Hirschsprung Disease surgery is complex. This begins with the workup after the initial presentation following primary pullthrough, continues with the definitive surgical correction with redo pullthrough, and ends with long-term follow-up of individuals. The decision tree can be varied with each patient. The operating pediatric surgeon must be able to utilize different operations and treatment options available. While lesser procedures may provide relief in a select population, those with residual aganglionosis or transition zone pathology or mechanical problems will likely require a redo pullthrough. Thus, the diagnostic workup, treatment plan, and definitive surgical care should be coordinated, and executed by an experienced, specialized team at a pediatric referral center.\n\nThe pathogenesis of Hirschsprung's disease-associated enterocolitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nAustin, Kelly Miller\n\n2012-11-01\n\nHirschsprung's disease-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) remains the most life-threatening complication in Hirschsprung disease (HD) patients. The pathogenesis of HAEC has not been determined and many hypotheses regarding the etiology of HAEC have been proposed. These include a possible causal relationship between the abnormal enteric nervous system development in HD and the development of enterocolitis. Based on the complex genetic causes of HD that have been discovered and the resultant heterogeneous group of patients that exists, the causes of HAEC are likely multiple. New insights regarding the relationship of the role of the enteric nervous system and its interaction between intestinal barrier function, innate host immunity, and commensal microflora have been discovered, which may shed light on this perplexing problem. This review presents current known risk factors of HAEC and the proposed theories and supporting evidence for the potential etiologies of HAEC. Copyright Â© 2012.

No direct association between Hirschsprung's disease and rectal cancer was found in our review of the literature. However, several case reports of rectal cancers following pull-through procedures exist.

Four types of WS have been classified to date; in WS type IV (WS4), patients additionally have colonic aganglionosis (Hirschsprung disease, HSCR). Mutations in the endothelin-3 (EDN3), endothelin-B receptor (EDNRB), and Sox10 genes have been identified as causative for WS type IV. We screened a family with a combined WS-HSCR phenotype for mutations in the EDNRB locus using standard DNA mutation analysis and sequencing techniques. We have identified a novel nonsense mutation at codon 253 (CGA-->TGA, Arg-->STOP). This mutation leads to a premature end of the translation of EDNRB at exon 3, and it is predicted to produce a truncated and nonfunctional endothelin-B receptor. All affected relatives were heterozygous for the Arg(253)-->STOP mutation, whereas it was not observed in over 50 unrelated individuals used as controls. These data confirm the role of EDNRB in the cause of the Waardenburg-Hirschsprung syndrome and demonstrate that in WS-HSCR there is a lack of correlation between phenotype and genotype and a variable expression of disease even within the same family.

We investigated a case of WS4 together with all members of her nuclear family for the alteration of the EDNRB gene by using PCR-SSCP and direct sequencing technique. The index patient, who was born to a family with no history of Hirschsprung disease, presented total colonic aganglionosis with small bowel extension, sensorineural hearing loss and generalized cutaneous pigmentary defects. Interestingly, both irides were normally black. The study detected a homozygous missense mutation at codon 196 in exon 2 (Ser196Asn), which has not been reported. Both parents and four in six siblings harbored heterozygous mutation without any clinical manifestation. Our findings were consistent with previous observations that full spectrum of WS4 occurred to the mutate homozygotes. Moreover, the non-penetrance of heterozygotes in our pedigree, which differs from other reports, demonstrates the high pleiotropic effect of EDNRB mutations in human.\n\nAn embryological point of view on associated congenital anomalies of children with Hirschsprung disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nSlavikova, T; Zabojnikova, L; Babala, J; Varga, I\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe most common congenital gut motility disorder is the Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). This anomaly is characterized by absence of neural crest-derived enteric neuronal ganglia. The aim of our study was to analyze the relationship between HSCR and other congenital anomalies or malfunctions. We examined 130 patients with Hirschsprung disease from Slovakia for last 10 years. During patients examination we focused not only on morphological abnormalities, but also functional anomalies. The incidence of associated congenital anomalies in our patients with HSCR was 26.1 %. But if we add functional defects (hypothyroidism, malfunction in cellular immunity, neurological deficit) to the morphological congenital abnormalities, the rate of the patients with HSCR with additional defects achieves 50.1 %. Nine of our patients (6.9 %) had syndromic HSCR. The most frequent disorder (13.6 % of patients) was primary deficiency in cellular immunity. More than 12.3 % of patients with HSCR had genitourinary abnormalities, in 10.0 % of patients variable degree of psychomotor retardation was observed, and skeletal, muscle and limb anomalies involved 7.7 % of patients. In 7.6 % cases of patients we found congenital hypothyroidism (including 2 cases of agenesis of thyroid gland). More than 6.1 % of patients presented with an associated anomaly in gastrointestinal tract (mostly anorectal malformations). Up to 5.5 % patients had congenital anomaly of heart, 3.8 % had ophthalmic and 3.1 % had craniofacial anomalies. Down syndrome was the main diagnosis in 3.8 % patients. We discussedÂ the relationship between HSCR and other anomalies, which are probably caused by abnormal migration, proliferation, or differentiation, of neural crest cells during embryogenesis (Tab. 1, Fig. 2, Ref. 75).\n\nHirschsprung's disease in twins: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nHenderson, D; Zimmer, J; Nakamura, H; Puri, Prem\n\n2017-08-01\n\nHirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is known to occur in families. The reported overall incidence of familial cases is 7.6%, with a higher incidence of 15-21% in total colonic aganglionosis and 50% in the rare total intestinal aganglionosis. HSCR is extremely rare in twins. The aim of this study was to systematically analyse the patterns of HSCR in twins published in the literature. Electronic databases Pubmed and Medline were screened for relevant articles using the keywords \"Hirschsprung's disease\", \"aganglionosis\", \"twins\", \"monozygotic\", and \"dizygotic\". Examining reference lists identified further relevant papers. Twelve studies with a total of 18 twin pairs were included in this analysis. 67% twins were discordant. HSCR was found in 24 out of 36 twin subjects (67%), of which 83% affected were male. Rectosigmoid type was reported in 71% of patients, long-segment disease in 21, and 8% presented with a total aganglionosis. Three twin pairs had at least one family member affected with HSCR. HSCR was found in two-thirds of twin subjects with a male predominance. Rectosigmoid aganglionosis was the most common variant. Disease discordance was identified, where environmental insults were postulated to be predisposing factors to disease expression. Future studies investigating the disease-associated mutations in the already identified HSCR genes should provide insights into the genetic basis of HSCR in twins.\n\nIdentification of GLI Mutations in Patients With Hirschsprung Disease That Disrupt Enteric Nervous System Development in Mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Jessica Ai-Jia; Lai, Frank Pui-Ling; Gui, Hong-Sheng; Sham, Mai-Har; Tam, Paul Kwong-Hang; Garcia-Barcelo, Maria-Mercedes; Hui, Chi-Chung; Ngan, Elly Sau-Wai\n\n2015-12-01\n\nHirschsprung disease is characterized by a deficit in enteric neurons, which are derived from neural crest cells (NCCs). Aberrant hedgehog signaling disrupts NCC differentiation and might cause Hirschsprung disease. We performed genetic analyses to determine whether hedgehog signaling is involved in pathogenesis. We performed deep-target sequencing of DNA from 20 patients with Hirschsprung disease (16 men, 4 women), and 20 individuals without (controls), and searched for mutation(s) in GLI1, GLI2, GLI3, SUFU, and SOX10. Biological effects of GLI mutations were tested in luciferase reporter assays using HeLa or neuroblastoma cell lines. Development of the enteric nervous system was studied in Sufu(f/f), Gli3(Î699), Wnt1-Cre, and Sox10(NGFP) mice using immunohistochemical and whole-mount staining procedures to quantify enteric neurons and glia and analyze axon fasciculation, respectively. NCC migration was studied using time-lapse imaging. We identified 3 mutations in GLI in 5 patients with Hirschsprung disease but no controls; all lead to increased transcription of SOX10 in cell lines. SUFU, GLI, and SOX10 form a regulatory loop that controls the neuronal vs glial lineages and migration of NCCs. Sufu mutants mice had high Gli activity, due to loss of Sufu, disrupting the regulatory loop and migration of enteric NCCs, leading to defective axonal fasciculation, delayed gut colonization, or intestinal hypoganglionosis. The ratio of enteric neurons to glia correlated inversely with Gli activity. We identified mutations that increase GLI activity in patients with Hirschsprung disease. Disruption of the SUFU-GLI-SOX10 regulatory loop disrupts migration of NCCs and development of the enteric nervous system in mice. Copyright Â© 2015 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Our objective is to identify the risk factors related to the development of HAEC in the cohort of patients with Hirschsprung's disease (HD) treated in our center. We reviewed the patients treated for HD between 2000 and 2016. Ninety four patients were included, and the clinical details related to the disease were evaluated. Our primary outcome measure was the development of HAEC. Relative risks are presented with 95% confidence intervals. Twenty seven patients out of the ninety four (28.7%) suffered HAEC. None of them died from this complication. The extended aganglionosis, the need of a preoperative stoma, a transabdominal surgery and the diagnosis before the age of 7.2 months were related to a higher risk of suffering HAEC. HAEC remains a common complication in patients suffering from HD, especially those with complex forms. The identification of the risk factors could result in a better control of the HAEC, which lead to a faster diagnosis and treatment, reducing the morbi-mortality related to HAEC.\n\nHirschsprung disease and congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT): a novel syndromic association.\n\nPubMed\n\nPini Prato, Alessio; Musso, Marco; Ceccherini, Isabella; Mattioli, Girolamo; Giunta, Camilla; Ghiggeri, Gian Marco; Jasonni, Vincenzo\n\n2009-03-01\n\nCongenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) can be associated with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). Based on the common genetic background of enteric nervous system and kidney development, the reported association of CAKUT and HSCR seems underestimated. Therefore, we designed a prospective study aimed at determining the prevalence of CAKUT in HSCR patients and at identifying RET, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and GDNF family receptor alpha1 (GFRalpha1) mutations or haplotypes associated with this subset of HSCR patients. Eighty-four HSCR patients consecutively admitted to our department between July 2006 and July 2007 underwent interviews, notes review, ultrasound screening (further investigation according to detected anomaly), urinalysis, and DNA extraction for molecular genetics study. Another 27 patients with isolated CAKUT were included as a control group for the molecular genetics study. Twenty-one patients (25%) with HSCR had associated CAKUT, with hydronephrosis and hypoplasia being the most frequent diagnoses. Nine of 21 CAKUT were symptomatic. Six additional patients had other non-CAKUT anomalies (for example, stones, Barter syndrome) that were excluded from association and molecular genetics analysis to avoid bias of inclusion criteria. RET mutations were found in 5 patients (4 HSCR, 1 HSCR + CAKUT, 0 CAKUT) and GDNF mutations in 3 (2 HSCR, 1 CAKUT, 0 HSCR + CAKUT). No GFRalpha1 mutations were found. Finally, the HSCR-predisposing T haplotype of RET proto-oncogene was found in 64% of HSCR, 50% of HSCR + CAKUT, and in 24% of CAKUT patients. The incidence of CAKUT in HSCR patients is 4- to 6-fold higher than expected. Therefore, a patient with HSCR has a 3- to 18-fold higher risk of developing a CAKUT, particularly hydronephrosis or hypoplasia. If we consider that the proportion of predisposing haplotype in HSCR + CAKUT patients resembles that of other syndromic HSCR, we can conclude that HSCR + CAKUT has to be considered\n\nDIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY OF BARIUM ENEMA FINDINGS IN HIRSCHSPRUNG'S DISEASE.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeyvasteh, Mehran; Askarpour, Shahnam; Ostadian, Nasrollah; Moghimi, Mohammad-Reza; Javaherizadeh, Hazhir\n\n2016-01-01\n\nHirschsprung's disease is the most common cause of pediatric intestinal obstruction. Contrast enema is used for evaluation of the patients with its diagnosis. To evaluate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of radiologic findings for diagnosis of Hirschsprung in patients underwent barium enema. This cross sectional study was carried out in Imam Khomeini Hospital for one year starting from 2012, April. Sixty patients were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were: neonates with failure to pass meconium, abdominal distention, and refractory constipation who failed to respond with medical treatment. Transitional zone, delay in barium evacuation after 24 h, rectosigmoid index (maximum with of the rectum divided by maximum with of the sigmoid; abnormal if <1), and irregularity of mucosa (jejunization) were evaluated in barium enema. Biopsy was obtained at three locations apart above dentate line. PPV, NPV, specificity , and sensitivity was calculated for each finding. Mean age of the cases with Hirschsprung's disease and without was 17.90Â±18.29 months and 17.8Â±18.34 months respectively (p=0.983). It was confirmed in 30 (M=20, F=10) of cases. Failure to pass meconium was found in 21(70%) cases. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 90%, 80%, 81.8% and 88.8% respectively for transitional zone in barium enema. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 76.7%, 83.3%, 78.1% and 82.1% respectively for rectosigmoid index .Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 46.7%, 100%, 100% and 65.2% respectively for irregular contraction detected in barium enema. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 23.3%, 100%, 100% and 56.6% respectively for mucosal irregularity in barium enema. The most sensitive finding was transitional zone. The most specific findings were irregular contraction, mucosal irregularity, and followed by cobblestone appearance.

METHODS: Trisomy 16 mouse breeding; cytogenetic analysis of trisomy 16 mice; and PGP 9.5 immunohistochemistry of colons of trisomy 16 mice and HD were carried out. RESULTS: Compared with their normal littermates, the nervous system of colon in trisomy 16 mice was abnormally developed. There existed developmental delay of muscular plexuses of colon, no submucosal plexus was found in the colon, and there was 5 mm aganglionic bowel aparting from the anus in trisomy 16 mice. The mesentery nerve fibers were as well developed as shown in their normal littermates. Abundant proliferation of PGP 9.5 positive nerve fibers was evealed in the stenosed segment of HD colon. CONCLUSION: Trisomy 16 mice could serve as an animal model for Hirschsprungâs disease for aganglionic bowel in the distal part of colon. Abundant proliferation of PGP 9.5 positive fibers resulted from extrinsic nerve compensation, since no ganglionic cells were observed in the stenosed segment of the colon in HD. HD has a genetic tendency.

It is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol Î7-reductase (DHCR7), which catalyzes the final step in cholesterol biosynthesis, usually resulting in cholesterol deficiency. We report a 3.5-year-old girl who has cognition in the low average range and normal behavior, but in whom molecular studies identified two missense mutations in DHCR7: V326L and F284L. She was born at term following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery, and presented at 12 days of age with poor feeding, abdominal distention, and jaundice. Colonic biopsy was consistent with Hirschsprung disease. On physical examination she had mild ptosis, a long philtrum, mild micrognathia, a short, upturned nose, and subtle 2,3 syndactyly. Her 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) level was markedly elevated at 8.7 mg/dl (normal 0.10 Â± 0.05), and her cholesterol level was normal at 61 mg/dl (normal for newborn period 50â80 mg/dl). Karyotype analysis was normal, 46,XX. Breast milk feeding was initiated and continued for 18 months. Cholesterol supplementation was implemented at 100 mg/kg/day at 3 months, which resulted in increased cholesterol levels and reduced dehydrocholesterol levels. Neuropsychological testing has shown functioning in the low average range, between the 14th and 18th centiles when compared to peers. This is markedly higher than most children with SLOS. She has no behavioral problems. MRI and MRS testing of the brain revealed no structural abnormalities. This is in contrast to a recently reported case by Prasad et al. [2002: Am J Med Genet 108:64â68] with a mild phenotype, behavioral problems, and abnormal MRI, who is compound heterozygote for both a null and missense mutation. Our case suggests that patients with severe feeding disorders with or without Hirschprung disease and postnatal onset microcephaly may warrant screening for SLOS.

The aim of this paper was to evaluate the role of transanal pull-through in the management of recto-sigmoid HD in our institution. A retrospective analysis (between January 2003 and December 2009) was carried out on all cases of Hirschsprung's reporting to unity of pediatric surgery of Tunis Children's Hospital that were managed by transanal pull-through as a definitive treatment. All selected patients including neonates had an aganglionic segment confined to the rectosigmoid area, confirmed by preoperative barium enema and postoperative histology. Twenty-six children (86%) had their operation done without construction of prior colostomy. Transanal pull-through was performed in 31 children. Mean operating time was 150 minutes (range 64 to 300 minutes). No patients required laparotomy because all patients including neonates had an aganglionic segment confined to the rectosigmoid area. Blood loss ranged between 20 to 56 ml without blood replacement. Since all children were given an epidural caudal block, the requirement of analgesia in these cases was minimal. Postoperative complications included perianal excoriation in 7 out of 31 patients lasting from 3 weeks to 6 months. Complete anorectal continence was noted in 21 of 31 (67%) children in follow up of 3-5 years. Transanal endorectal pull-through procedure for the management of rectosigmoid HD is now a well-established and preferred approach. Parental satisfaction is immense due to the lack of scars on the abdomen. As regards the continence, a long-term follow-up is necessary to appreciate better the functional results of this surgery.\n\n[Rectosigmoidectomy and end to end coloanal anastomosis with mechanical stapler for treatement of Hirschsprung disease].\n\nPubMed\n\nGaztambide Casellas, J; SÃ¡nchez DÃ­az, F; GarcÃ­a Soldevilla, N; Argos RodrÃ­guez, M D; PÃ©rez RodrÃ­guez, J\n\n2004-04-01\n\nThe experience of the Pediatric Surgical Service of the Materno Infantil University Hospital from MÃ¡laga on surgical treatment of the Hirschsprung disease by means of a modified technique of Swenson and Rehbein operations is presented. Between 1992 and 2001 25 patients were operated of a rectosigmoidectomy. Of them, 23 were diagnosed of Hirschsprung's disease, one suffered a rectal angiodisplasia and the other one presented with a rectal stenosis secondary to a previous rectosigmoidectomy. In all of them a transabdominal rectosigmoidectomy with coloanal end to end anastomosis by means of a circular intraluminal stapler was performed. In 10 of them (group A), a modified Rehbein operation with intraabdominal anastomosis was performed. In the remaining 15 patients (group B), a modified Swenson operation with exteriorization of the aganglionic colon through the anus and extrabdominal anastomosis was performed. The postoperative course was evaluated by measuring the postoperative fasting time and the first spontaneous deposition. The medium hospital stay was of 9 days, nevertheless in 16 patients (64%) was lower than 7 days. The postoperative complications are presented. It consists in 1 anastomotic leakage (4%), postoperative enterocolitis 1 case (4%) and transient anastomotic stenosis in 4 patients (16%). All of them were treated with conservative treatment except one case of stenosis which needed a sphincterotomy. The rectosigmoidectomy and coloanal end to end anastomosis with endoluminal stapler is a safe and easy to do technique to treat the Hirschsprung's disease allowing a deep rectal resection which is very difficult to achieve by manual suture. The anastomosis is located in and extraperitoneal position, with a minimum risk of peritoneal involvement in case of anastomotic leakage. The patients presented a fast recovery, a minimum of complications and good functional result.\n\nPhenotypeâgenotype correlation in Hirschsprung disease is illuminated by comparative analysis of the RET protein sequence\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKashuk, Carl S.; Stone, Eric A.; Grice, Elizabeth A.; Portnoy, Matthew E.; Green, Eric D.; Sidow, Arend; Chakravarti, Aravinda; McCallion, Andrew S.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe ability to discriminate between deleterious and neutral amino acid substitutions in the genes of patients remains a significant challenge in human genetics. The increasing availability of genomic sequence data from multiple vertebrate species allows inclusion of sequence conservation and physicochemical properties of residues to be used for functional prediction. In this study, the RET receptor tyrosine kinase serves as a model disease gene in which a broad spectrum (â¥116) of disease-associated mutations has been identified among patients with Hirschsprung disease and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. We report the alignment of the human RET protein sequence with the orthologous sequences of 12 non-human vertebrates (eight mammalian, one avian, and three teleost species), their comparative analysis, the evolutionary topology of the RET protein, and predicted tolerance for all published missense mutations. We show that, although evolutionary conservation alone provides significant information to predict the effect of a RET mutation, a model that combines comparative sequence data with analysis of physiochemical properties in a quantitative framework provides far greater accuracy. Although the ability to discern the impact of a mutation is imperfect, our analyses permit substantial discrimination between predicted functional classes of RET mutations and disease severity even for a multigenic disease such as Hirschsprung disease.

A systematic review of current literature\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSzylberg, Åukasz\n\n2014-01-01\n\nHirschsprung's disease (HD) is a disorder that involves several medical specialties such as paediatric gastroenterology, paediatric surgery, and pathology. Hirschsprung's disease is a congenital bowel innervation disorder characterised by the absence of ganglion cells in myenteric (Auerbach) and submucosal (Meissner) plexus in the distal colon in its classical form. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of HD is a key element in further treatment patterns. The efficiency of different diagnostic methods used in HD patients may vary. Using one limited diagnostic procedure can lead to as much as a few per cent of overlooked cases. In recent years, rectal biopsy was recognised as an important diagnostic tool that allows for a definitive HD diagnosis with an accuracy of 95% of cases. A correct diagnosis depends on the localisation of the biopsied sample, its representativeness, the number of specimens, and proper interpretation of microscopic studies supported by histochemical and immunohistochemical methods. When several methods are used and all diagnostic criteria are used, the diagnostic sensitivity can almost eliminate cases of undiagnosed patients.

The technique is safe and, according to previous reports, it has a good clinical outcome. In this study our experience with TEPT in the early postoperative period is evaluated. The clinical course of 34 children (28 boys and 6 girls) who underwent one-stage pull-through operation according to De la Torre for Hirschsprung's disease from January 2003 to December 2007 was reviewed. Their ages ranged from 2 months to 4 years. Complications occurring within the first four weeks after operation were analyzed. Eight of 34 children (24 %) had early complications in the form of dehiscences of the anastomosis. Two children (6 %) had symptomatic anastomotic dehiscences. One child had an almost full retraction of the colon that had to be pulled down and resutured. One child developed a retrorectal abscess three weeks postoperatively due to anastomotic leakage. The dehiscences of 6 children (18 %) were asymptomatic. These dehiscences were detected only with standardized routine examination. The dehiscences healed uneventfully after resuturing. Two other patients (6 %) developed an anastomotic stricture that could be treated with rectal dilatations. Four children (12 %) showed a single episode of postoperative enterocolitis. The rate of early clinical and particularly subclinical complications such as anastomotic dehiscences after TEPT is higher than previously estimated. Patients should be monitored carefully during the early postoperative period. Severe complications can only be avoided with a thorough examination. Early resuturing of dehiscences might be helpful to prevent hazardous sequelae.\n\nAB053. NRG1 rare variant effects in Hirschsprung disease patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGunadi; Budi, Nova; Iskandar, Kristy; Adrianto, Indra\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a heterogeneous genetic disorder characterized by absence of ganglion cells along intestines resulting in functional bowel obstruction. NRG1 gene has been implicated in the intestinal ganglionosis. This study aimed to investigate the contribution of NRG1 gene into the HSCR development in Indonesian population. Methods We performed Sanger sequencing to find NRG1 variants in 54 HSCR patients. Results All patients were sporadic non-syndromic HSCR with 53/54 (98%) and 1/54 (2%) were short-segment and long-segment patients, respectively. NRG1 analysis showed one rare variant, c.397G > C (p.V133L), and three common variants, rs7834206, rs3735774, and rs75155858. The p.V133L was predicted to reside within in a region of high mammalian conservation, overlap with the promoter and enhancer histone marks of relevant tissues such as digestive and smooth muscle tissues and alter AP-4_2, BDP1_disc3, Egr-1_known1, Egr-1_known4, HEN1_2 transcription factor binding motifs. Furthermore, this variant was absent in 92 controls. Conclusions This study is the first report of NRG1 rare variant associated with HSCR patients in South-East Asian ancestry and adds insights into the NRG1 effect in the molecular pathogenesis of HSCR.\n\nA morphological study of the pacemaker cells of the aganglionic intestine in Hirschsprung's disease utilizing ls/ls model mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nTaniguchi, Kan; Matsuura, Kimio; Matsuoka, Takanori; Nakatani, Hajime; Nakano, Takumi; Furuya, Yasuo; Sugimoto, Takeki; Kobayashi, Michiya; Araki, Keijiro\n\n2005-06-01\n\nHirschsprung's disease is a congenital aganglionic neural disorder of the segmental distal intestine characterized by unsettled pathogenesis. The relationship between Hirschsprung's disease and pacemaker cells (PMC), which almost corresponds to that of the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), was morphologically observed at the level of the intermuscular layer corresponding to Auerbach's plexus using ls/ls mice. These mice are an ideal model because of their large intestinal aganglionosis and gene abnormalities, which are similar to the human form of the disease. Immunostaining using anti-c-kit receptor antibody (ACK2), a marker of PMC, applied to whole-mount muscle-layer specimens, revealed the presence of c-kit immunopositive multipolar cells with many cytoplasmic processes in normal mice. For ls/ls mice, however, there were significantly fewer processes. The average number of processes per positive cell of 2.5 for the aganglionic large intestine was fewer than 3.5 for the large and small intestine of normal mice, indicating the inability to form connections between nerves and PMC in the aganglionic intestine. For normal mice with an Auerbach's plexus, the process attachment of ICC to the Auerbach's plexus was observed by scanning electron microscopy. However, for ls/ls mice no attachment to the intermuscular nerve without Auerbach's plexus was found, although transmission electron microscopy showed no difference in the cell structure and organelles of the c-kit immunopositive cells between the normal and ls/ls mice. These findings suggest that in the aganglionic intestine of Hirschsprung's disease, aplasia of enteric ganglia induces secondary disturbances during the normal development of intestinal PMC.\n\nDamaged anal canal as a cause of fecal incontinence after surgical repair for Hirschsprung disease - a preventable and under-reported complication.\n\nPubMed\n\nBischoff, Andrea; Frischer, Jason; Knod, Jennifer Leslie; Dickie, Belinda; Levitt, Marc A; Holder, Monica; Jackson, Lyndsey; PeÃ±a, Alberto\n\n2017-04-01\n\nFecal incontinence after the surgical repair of Hirschsprung disease is a potentially preventable complication that carries a negative impact on patient's quality of life. Patients that were previously operated for Hirschsprung disease and presented to our bowel management clinic with the complaint of fecal incontinence were retrospectively reviewed. All patients underwent a rectal examination under anesthesia looking for anatomic explanations for their incontinence. One hundred three patients were identified. 54 patients had a damaged anal canal. 22 patients also had a patulous anus. The operative reports mentioned the pectinate line in 32 patients, in 12 it was not mentioned, and in 10 patients the operative report was not available. All patients with a damaged anal canal suffered from true fecal incontinence; 45 of them are on daily enemas (41 are clean and 4 are still having \"accidents\"), 7 are not doing bowel management due to noncompliance and 2 patients have a permanent ileostomy. 49 patients did not have a damaged anal canal, 25 of those responded to changes in diet and medication and are having voluntary bowel movements. Fecal incontinence may occur after an operation for Hirschsprung disease. When the anal canal is damaged, incontinence is always present, severe, and probably permanent. The preservation of the anal canal may avoid this complication. Copyright Â© 2017.

We present two cases of adult patients with HD. The first case is a 46-year-old male patient suffering from chronic constipation since childhood and diagnosed with megacolon at the age of 16; however, no further detailed diagnosis was done. At the age of 41, he developed a sigmoid perforation due to fecaloma and underwent urgent rectosigmoid resection and colostomy. 5 months later, Swensons coloanal anastomosis with diverting ileostomy was performed. Postoperative course was uneventful. He has two bowel movements a day. 7 years after the Swensons procedure, he also underwent adhesiolysis for acute bowel obstruction. His daughter was operated on due to HD at 16 days of age. The second case is a 57-year-old male patient. He suffered from chronic constipation and megacolon since 2 years of age and was diagnosed with congenital megacolon at the age of 19. However, no detailed diagnostics followed. He had a long interval between stools of up to 14 days. He underwent colonoscopy and, with a diagnosis of resistant Crohns disease, was referred to a surgical department where he was diagnosed with HD. Left hemicolectomy was first performed, followed by Swensons procedure with diverting ileostomy. All postoperative courses were uneventful. Currently he passes one or two soft stools a day. Adult HD is extremely rare. However, adult surgeons should consider it in case of refractory constipation since childhood associated with megacolon. Diagnosis is based on contrast radiography and rectal biopsy. Both Swensons and Duhamels procedures are suitable for surgical management. Left hemicolectomy with colonic rotation and coloanal anastomosis and/or proctocolectomy with J-pouch anastomosis are indicated in advanced forms of non-functional megacolon.Key words: adult Hirschsprungs disease - megacolon surgical therapy.\n\nShah-Waardenburg Syndrome\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMahmoudi, Abdelhalim; Rami, Mohamed; Khattala, Khalid; Elmadi, Aziz; Afifi, My Abderrahmane; Youssef, Bouabdallah\n\n2013-01-01\n\nShah-Waardenburg syndrome (SWS) is a neurocristopathy and is characterized by Hirschsprung's disease (HD), deafness, and depigmentation of hairs, skin, and iris.

Mutations in the EDN, EDNRB and SOX10 genes can be found in patients with this syndrome. SOX10 mutations are specifically associated with a more severe phenotype called PCWH: peripheral demyelinating neuropathy, central dysmyelinating leukodystrophy, Waardenburg syndrome, and Hirschsprung disease. Neuronal expression of SOX10 occurs in neural crest cells during early embryonic development and in glial cells of the peripheral and central nervous systems during late embryonic development and in adults. We present a 4-year-old girl with the PCWH phenotype associated with a de novo nonsense mutation (S384X) in SOX10. Main clinical features were mental retardation, peripheral neuropathy, deafness, Hirschsprung disease, distal arthrogryposis, white hairlock, and growth retardation. She presented with hypotonia, developmental delay, reduced peripheral nerve conduction velocities, and radiologically assessed central hypomyelination. Subsequently, the formation of abnormal myelin within the central and peripheral nervous system was functionally and radiologically assessed. Children presenting with features of Waardenburg syndrome and neurological dysfunction should be tested for mutations in the SOX10 gene to enable diagnosis and counselling.\n\nContrast enema findings in patients presenting with poor functional outcome after primary repair for Hirschsprung disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarrett, Kevin M; Levitt, Marc A; PeÃ±a, Alberto; Kraus, Steven J\n\n2012-09-01\n\nThe radiologic evaluation of Hirschsprung disease is well described in the literature. However, there is a paucity of literature describing the appearance of the neo-rectum and colon after repair, specifically describing findings in patients with poor functional outcome, which would suggest the need for reoperation. We describe findings on contrast enema and correlate them with surgical findings at reoperation in children with poor functional outcome after primary repair for Hirschsprung disease who suffer from bowel dysfunction that can manifest with either soiling or obstructive symptoms such as enterocolitis. Children were identified from our colorectal surgery database. At the time of abstract submission, 35 children had contrast enemas prior to reoperation. Additional children continue to present for evaluation. The majority of children included in the study had their primary repair performed elsewhere. The initial procedures included: Duhamel (nâ=â11), Soave (nâ=â20) or Swenson (nâ=â3). One child had undergone a primary Soave repair and subsequently had a Swenson-type reoperation but continued to have a poor outcome. One child's initial surgical repair could not be determined. Images were reviewed by a staff pediatric radiologist and a pediatric radiology fellow. Findings encountered on contrast enema in these children include a distal narrowed segment due to stricture or aganglionic/transitional zone segment (8), dilated/hypomotile distal segment (7), thickened presacral space due to compressing Soave cuff (11), dilated Duhamel pouch (8), active enterocolitis (3) and partially obstructing twist of the pull-through segment (1). Multiple anatomical and pathological complications exist that can lead to bowel dysfunction in children after repair of Hirschsprung disease. Little recent literature exists regarding the radiographic findings in children. We had the opportunity to review a substantial series of these children, describe the contrast enema\n\nOlder age at diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease decreases risk of postoperative enterocolitis, but resection of additional ganglionated bowel does not.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaricharan, Ramanath N; Seo, Jeong-Meen; Kelly, David R; Mroczek-Musulman, Elizabeth C; Aprahamian, Charles J; Morgan, Traci L; Georgeson, Keith E; Harmon, Carroll M; Saito, Jacqueline M; Barnhart, Douglas C\n\n2008-06-01\n\nThis study was conducted to determine the effect of age at diagnosis and length of ganglionated bowel resected on postoperative Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC). Children who underwent endorectal pull-through (ERPT) between January 1993 and December 2004 were retrospectively reviewed. t Test, analysis of variance, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox's proportional hazards analyses were performed. Fifty-two children with Hirschsprung disease (median age, 25 days; range, 2 days-16 years) were included. Nineteen (37%) had admissions for HAEC. Proportional hazards regression showed that HAEC admissions decreased by 30% with each doubling of age at diagnosis (P = .03) and increased 9-fold when postoperative stricture was present (P < .01), after controlling for type of ERPT, trisomy 21, transition zone level, and preoperative enterocolitis. Thirty-six children, with age at initial operation less than 6 months, were grouped based on length of ganglionated bowel excised (A [5 cm] and B [>5 cm]). No significant difference in the number of HAEC admissions during initial 2 years post-ERPT was seen between groups A (n = 18) and B (n = 18). The study had a power of 0.8 to detect a difference of 1 admission over 2 years. Children diagnosed with Hirschsprung disease at younger ages are at a greater risk for postoperative enterocolitis. Excising a longer margin of ganglionated bowel (>5 cm) does not seem to be beneficial in decreasing HAEC admissions.\n\nWaardenburg syndrome presenting with constipation since birth.\n\nPubMed\n\nGupta, R; Sharma, S B; Mathur, P; Agrawal, L D\n\n2014-12-01\n\nShah-Waardenburg syndrome is Waardenburg syndrome associated with Hirschsprung's disease.

The method proved at least as reliable as experienced assessment of paraffin haematoxylin-eosin sections, and appeared to offer the advantages of reduced scanning fatigue and superior demonstration of the increased cholinesterase-positive nerves in Hirschprung's disease. Contrary to the findings of Meier-Ruge (1971) it was not possible to base a diagnosis on mucosal cholinesterase activity.

Although it was described more than one century ago, the effective treatment was established only half a century later. The initially treatment consisted of preoperative diverting colostomy, followed by definite pull-through and closure of colostomy on later date. A variety of procedures like Swenson, Duhamel, Rehbein and Soave were evolved with time. With the better understanding of pathogenesis and improvement on surgical technique, now the operation has become less extensive. In recent days, the classical 3 staged procedure is replaced by single staged procedure. All the procedure can be completed transanally. Since De la Torre in 1998, first reported total transanal endorectal pull-through, it became the most popular technique for the treatment of HD.\n\n[Transanal endorectal pull-through alone as treatment of Hirschsprung's disease].\n\nPubMed\n\nJuliÃ¡, V; CastaÃ±Ã³n, M; Tarrado, X; PinzÃ³n, J C; Morales, L\n\n2004-04-01\n\nThe aim of this work is to present our experience in the treatment of Hirschsprung's disease (HD) with the technique described by De la Torre. Seven children diagnosed with recto-sigmoid aganglionism have been treated with this surgical technique, to which a few modifications have been done. There were no intra- nor early postoperative complications. Surgical time ranged 150 to 240 minutes (average 198). All children began oral feedings 2 or 3 days postoperatively (average 2.4). Hospital stay averaged 5.2 days. Follow-up ranges from 6 months to 3 years (average 16 months). Two late complications were seen--one anastomotic stricture and one constipation--and successfully treated as out patients. The transanal only approach carries a rapid recovery. Family satisfaction is high because of the lack of scars. We believe this is the treatment of choice when confronting rectosigmoid aganglionism.\n\nTGF-Î²1, Ghrelin, Neurexin, and Neuroligin are predictive biomarkers for postoperative prognosis of laparoscopic surgery in children with Hirschsprung disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nShangjie, Xiao; Xiaochun, Zhu; Wenyi, Yang; Wuping, Ge; Ying, Zhang; Qiuming, He; Huimin, Xia\n\n2015-03-01\n\nThe study was set to analyze the predictive values of transforming growth factor Î²1 (TGF-Î²1), Ghrelin, Neurexin, and Neuroligin protein expression on postoperative prognosis of laparoscopic surgery in children with Hirschsprung disease. 281 cases of children with Hirschsprung disease, admitted into Guangdong Women and Children Hospital and Guangzhou women and children's medical center from March 2009 to March 2014, were treated with laparoscopic radical surgery for Hirschsprung disease. They were divided into the good and the poor prognosis groups according to their recuperation and complications. Protein expressions of TGF-Î²1, Ghrelin, Neurexin, and Neuroligin were prospectively analyzed. The correlations between the expressions of these proteins and the prognosis were analyzed. There were 129 cases of children with poor prognosis, accounting for 45.9 %. There were no significant differences in the expressions of TGF-Î²1 mRNA and proteins within the group in both the groups (p > 0.05). TGF-Î²1 mRNA and protein expressions of the poor prognosis group were significantly higher than those of the good prognosis group in each segment of intestine (p < 0.05). Protein detection results manifested that Ghrelin protein expression gradually increased along narrow segment, transitional segment, and expansion segment in both groups. Ghrelin protein expression of the poor prognosis group was significantly lower than that of the good prognosis group in each segment of intestine (p < 0.05). There were significant differences in the protein expressions of Neurexin and Neuroligin within the group. The protein expressions of Neurexin and Neuroligin in expansion segment were the highest. Neurexin and Neuroligin protein expressions of the poor prognosis group were significantly lower than those of the good prognosis group in each segment of intestine (p < 0.05).

Most often, the aganglionic segment includes the rectosigmoid, but it may extend proximally to variable length. In late years, significant improvements regarding the surgical treatment of Hirschsprung's disease were made, by the introduction of both one-stage transanalendorectal pull-through a laparoscopically assisted or not - and mechanical suture devices. The purpose of this paper is to analyse our results with modified Duhamel procedure by using mechanical sutures for construction of a side-to-side colo-rectal anastomosis. We analysed 17 congenital megacolon cases operated in our department between 2007 - 2011 by the same pediatric surgical team, using the modified Duhamel technique performed with mechanical suture. It is the first series operated in our country using this procedure. 2 patients had a long colonic aganglionosis, 2 patients had a short aganglionotic segment and 13 patients had the common form of the disease. Mainly, we focused on technical details,hospitalization period, and immediate and late complications. The mean hospitalization period was of 9 days.Mortality in our series was 0. Postoperative complications consisted in minor bleeding (5 cases), adhesions and mechanical occlusion (1 case), and subocclusive symptoms due to remnant septum with subsequent fecaloma formation in the rectal ampula (4 cases). All of our operated cases had consequently a very good fecal continence. We think that usage of mechanical suture devices in a single stage Duhamel procedure is extremely beneficial regarding both complication rate and hospitalisation time.This technique is safe, simple and efficient.

WS4 is characterized by pigmentary abnormalities of the skin, eyes and/or hair, sensorineural deafness and HSCR. None of the members had sensorineural deafness. The family was screened for copy number variations (CNVs) using Illumina-HumanOmni2.5-Beadchip and for coding sequence mutations in WS4 genes (EDN3, EDNRB, or SOX10) and in the main HSCR gene (RET). Confocal microscopy and immunoblotting were used to assess the functional impact of the mutations. A heterozygous A/G transition in EDNRB was identified in 4 affected and 3 unaffected individuals. While in EDNRB isoforms 1 and 2 (cellular receptor) the transition results in the abolishment of translation initiation (M1V), in isoform 3 (only in the cytosol) the replacement occurs at Met91 (M91V) and is predicted benign. Another heterozygous transition (c.-248G/A; -predicted to affect translation efficiency-) in the 5â²-untranslated region of EDN3 (EDNRB ligand) was detected in all affected individuals but not in healthy carriers of the EDNRB mutation. Also, a de novo CNVs encompassing DACH1 was identified in the patient with heterochromia iridum and HSCR Since the EDNRB and EDN3 variants only coexist in affected individuals, HSCR could be due to the joint effect of mutations in genes of the same pathway. Iris heterochromia could be due to an independent genetic event and would account for the additional phenotype within the family.

The patients were compared with a group of 48 children with Hirschsprung's disease, operated on between 1978 and 1988, also according to Rehbein, but with a hand-sutured anastomosis. Postoperatively, the anastomosis performed by a stapling instrument that was larger and more elastic than the one sutured by hand. Early and later complications were less frequent in stapler anastomosis. Postoperatively, children with an autosuture anastomosis need a bouginage for 4 weeks (mean) whereas children with a hand sutured anastomosis had to be dilated for 12 weeks. Electromanometric studies in 10 children with a sutured and 8 with an autosutured anastomosis showed no physiological difference. Problems by performing autosuture-anastomosis in newborn with Hirschsprung's disease are discussed.\n\nA homozygous mutation in the endothelin-3 gene associated with a combined Waardenburg type 2 and Hirschsprung phenotype (Shah-Waardenburg syndrome).\n\nPubMed\n\nHofstra, R M; Osinga, J; Tan-Sindhunata, G; Wu, Y; Kamsteeg, E J; Stulp, R P; van Ravenswaaij-Arts, C; Majoor-Krakauer, D; Angrist, M; Chakravarti, A; Meijers, C; Buys, C H\n\n1996-04-01\n\nHirschsprung disease (HSCR) or colonic aganglionosis is a congenital disorder characterized by an absence of intramural ganglia along variable lengths of the colon resulting in intestinal obstruction. The incidence of HSCR is 1 in 5,000 live births. Mutations in the RET gene, which codes for a receptor tyrosine kinase, and in EDNRB which codes for the endothelin-B receptor, have been shown to be associated with HSCR in humans. The lethal-spotted mouse which has pigment abnormalities, but also colonic aganglionosis, carries a mutation in the gene coding for endothelin 3 (Edn3), the ligand for the receptor protein encoded by EDNRB. Here, we describe a mutation of the human gene for endothelin 3 (EDN3), homozygously present in a patient with a combined Waardenburg syndrome type 2 (WS2) and HSCR phenotype (Shah-Waardenburg syndrome). The mutation, Cys159Phe, in exon 3 in the ET-3 like domain of EDN3, presumably affects the proteolytic processing of the preproendothelin to the mature peptide EDN3. The patient's parents were first cousins. A previous child in this family had been diagnosed with a similar combination of HSCR, depigmentation and deafness. Depigmentation and deafness were present in other relatives. Moreover, we present a further indication for the involvement of EDNRB in HSCR by reporting a novel mutation detected in one of 40 unselected HSCR patients.\n\nOphthalmologic abnormalities in Mowat-Wilson syndrome and a mutation in ZEB2.\n\nPubMed\n\nAriss, Michelle; Natan, Kristina; Friedman, Neil; Traboulsi, Elias I\n\n2012-09-01\n\nMowat-Wilson syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by a distinct facial appearance, moderate-to-severe mental retardation, microcephaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum, Hirschsprung disease, congenital heart disease, and genital anomalies.

Although the surgical correction of HD is mostly successful, challenges remain in the management of children with repeated episodes of enterocolitis. The authors describe a novel modification of transanal rectal mucosectomy and partial internal anal sphincterectomy (TRM-PIAS) for HD. One hundred twenty-seven HD children aged from 8 days to 16 years who successfully underwent TRM-PIAS were reviewed. TRM-PIAS was carried out circumferentially along the anorectal line. Anterior dissection was conducted between the rectal submuscosal layer and the rectal muscular sleeve. The posterior dissection was performed along the plane between internal and external anal sphincters. Normal colon was pulled through and anastomosed to anal mucosa. Aganglionic segment, rectal mucosa, part of internal anal sphincter and posterior rectal muscular cuff were removed. Twenty-five age-matched children without defecation dysfunction were used as the control group in the study of anal resting pressure. Patients were followed up for 6-12 years (median: 8.2 years). The median age at last follow-up was 12.2 years (7.2-20.1 years). The incidence of enterocolitis decreased from 33.9% (43/127) preoperatively to 1.6% (2/127) postoperatively (P<0.01). The incidence of constipation decreased from 100% (127/127) preoperatively to 2.4% (3/127) postoperatively (P<0.01). Soiling rate on postoperative 1 month was 32.3%. It gradually decreased to 1.6% 6 months later. Anorectal manometries showed that mean anal resting pressure was significantly reduced from 37.9Â±12.5 mm Hg preoperatively to 20.2Â±6.4 mm Hg on postoperative 1 month and 24.8Â±9.9 mm Hg on postoperative 6 months, which were similar to age-matched normal controls (27.9Â±9.6 mm Hg, P>0.05).

It is usually caused by truncating frameshift/nonsense and splicing mutations in the middle third of GLI3. The clinical course ranges from mild to lethal in the neonatal period. We present the first patient with Pallister-Hall syndrome reported with total colonic aganglionosis, a rare form of Hirschsprung disease with poor long-term outcome. The patient also had an imperforate anus, which is the third individual with Pallister-Hall syndrome reported with both Hirschsprung disease and an imperforate anus. Molecular testing via amniocentesis showed an apparently de novo novel nonsense mutation c.2641 C>T (p.Gln881*). His overall medical course was difficult and was complicated by respiratory failure and pan-hypopituitarism. Invasive care was ultimately withdrawn, and the patient expired at three months of age. This patient's phenotype was complex with unusual gastrointestinal features ultimately leading to a unfavorable prognosis and outcome, highlighting the range of clinical severity in patients with Pallister-Hall syndrome.

There are non-severe forms treated conservatively until surgery and severe forms that require an early stoma and prolonged hospitalization. Our objective was to establish a clinical scoring system to predict the severity of HSCR and to evaluate the possible existence of a clinical-genetic correlation. We carried out a retrospective observational study including all HSCR cases treated in our hospital. The sample was divided into severe and non-severe disease according to the number of surgical procedures, hospitalization time and episodes of enterocolitis. The proposed score was applied at diagnosis, and the sensitivity, specificity and optimal cut-point were determined. We conducted a prospective molecular study of RET, EDNRB and EDN3 on all patients, as well as SOX10 in Waardenburg Syndrome type 4 forms. Among the 42 patients treated between 1983 and 2013, 15 met the severe disease criteria. This group had a higher mean score (13.15Â±2.36) than the non-severe group (8.15Â±2.13; p<0.001). A score {greater than or equal to}11 had a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 81% in detecting the severe cases. Causative mutations were identified in 12 patients, 8 of them in the severe group (p=0.015). Most of these mutations (75%) were located in the RET proto-oncogene. The proposed scoring system enables the early selection of patients with severe behaviour of HSCR. A value {greater than or equal to}11 showed good sensitivity and specificity for this purpose.

Summary Background Data During the past decade, the authors have advanced the use of a primary pull-through for Hirschsprung disease in the newborn, and preliminary results have suggested excellent outcomes. Methods From May 1989 through September 1999, 78 infants underwent a primary endorectal pull-through (ERPT) procedure at four pediatric surgical sites. Data were collected from medical records and a parental telephone interview (if the child was older than 3 years) to assess stooling patterns. A similar group of patients treated in a two-stage fashion served as a historical control. Results Mean age at the time of ERPT was 17.8 days of life. Comparing primary ERPT with a two-stage approach showed a trend toward a higher incidence of enterocolitis in the primary ERPT group compared with those with a two-stage approach (42.0% vs. 22.0%). Other complications were either lower in the primary ERPT group or similar, including rate of soiling and development of a bowel obstruction. Median number of stools per day was two at a mean follow-up of 4.1 Â± 2.5 years, with 83% having three or fewer stools per day. Conclusions Performance of a primary ERPT for Hirschsprung disease in the newborn is an excellent option. Results were comparable to those of the two-stage procedure. The greater incidence of enterocolitis appears to be due to a lower threshold in diagnosing enterocolitis in more recent years.

This syndrome is likely to be autosomal recessive and resembles Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO) syndrome. However, the lethality, the common occurrence of polydactyly, and the sexual ambiguity distinguishes this condition from SLO syndrome. A review of published reports supports the separate classification of this syndrome for which we propose the name lethal acrodysgenital dwarfism.

Twenty-five records of patients with TCH treated between 1974 and 2002 were reviewed. Follow-up data were collected using a standardized questionnaire. Objective functional outcome was assessed using a scoring system. Twenty patients had aganglionosis of the colon and distal ileum, 5 of whom had a more extensive condition. One of these 5 patients underwent an endorectal pull-through (ERPT), 1 underwent intestinal transplantation, and 3 died. Four of the remaining 20 patients underwent a primary ERPT, 16 received a stoma as neonates followed by ERPT in 12, and a Martin-Duhamel procedure or Swenson's operation in 3 (median age, 10.5 months); 1 remains with an ostomy. Postoperative complications included enterocolitis (55%), anal stricture (25%), and perineal excoriation (20%). Mean follow-up were 17.5 years (+/-11.1 years). Eighty-nine percent were free of recurrent enterocolitis. Frequency of bowel movements is 1 to 5 per day in 82% of the patients, 18% have 6 or more bowel movements per day. Occasional soiling is noted in 40% (one third of those requiring nighttime diapers). Overall functional outcome was good in 83%. Those patients with the longest follow-up periods had the best stooling scores (P = .04). Surgical treatment of TCH is associated with a number of complications including recurrent enterocolitis and anal strictures. Long-term outcome is quite favorable.\n\nAssociation analysis of the SOX10 polymorphism with Hirschsprung disease in the Han Chinese population.\n\nPubMed\n\nPan, Zhi-Wen; Lou, Jintu; Luo, Chunfen; Yu, Linjun; Li, Ji-Cheng\n\n2011-10-01\n\nHirschsprung disease (HSCR, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man 142623) is a typical developmental disorder of the enteric nervous system in which ganglion cells fail to innervate the lower gastrointestinal tract during embryonic development. SOX10 gene is involved in the normal development of the enteric nervous system. Heterozygous SOX10 mutations have been identified in patients with syndromic HSCR. However, no mutations have been reported to date to be associated to isolated HSCR patient. We thus sought to investigate whether mutations in the SOX10 are associated with isolated HSCR in the Chinese population. Polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing were used to screen 4 exons of the SOX10 gene for mutations and polymorphisms in 104 patients with sporadic HSCR and 96 ethnically matched controls in Han Chinese populations. In this study, 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified: SNP1: c.18C>T (GACâGAT) in exon 2; SNP2: c.122G>T (GGCâGTC) in exon 2; SNP3: IVS2+10 (CâG) in intron 2; and SNP4: c.927T>C (CATâCAC) in exon 4. SNP1 and SNP2 were novel described polymorphisms in the Chinese population. No SOX10 mutations were found in Han Chinese with isolated HSCR. Our results revealed that there was no association between the 4 SNPs of the SOX10 gene and HSCR. This study showed that the SOX10 gene is unlikely to be a major HSCR gene in the Chinese Han population. Copyright Â© 2011.

The PHOX2B gene acts as a transcriptional activator in the promotion of pan-neuronal differentiation in the autonomic nervous system during early embryologic development, with a primary role in the sympathetic noradrenergic phenotype in vertebrates. Because sympathetic innervation has been hypothesized to affect the development of dermatoglyphic pattern types, we hypothesized that individuals with PHOX2B-confirmed congenital central hypoventilation syndrome would have characteristic dermatoglyphic patterning and that the dermatoglyphic phenotype would be related to the disease-defining PHOX2B genotype. Dermatoglyphic pattern type frequency, left/right symmetry, and genotype/phenotype correlation were assessed for 33 individuals with PHOX2B-confirmed congenital central hypoventilation syndrome and compared with published control data. Dermatoglyphic pattern type frequencies were altered in congenital central hypoventilation syndrome cases versus controls. In particular, there was an increase of arches in females and ulnar loops in males, with the largest differences for the left hand and for individuals with both congenital central hypoventilation syndrome and Hirschsprung disease. Dissimilarity scores between the congenital central hypoventilation syndrome and congenital central hypoventilation syndrome + Hirschsprung disease cases were not significantly different, nor were dissimilarity scores between all of the female and all of the male cases. No significant association was found between the number of polyalanine repeats in the PHOX2B genotypic category and dermatoglyphic pattern frequencies in the congenital central hypoventilation syndrome study groups. These results represent the first report describing specific dermatoglyphic patterning in congenital central hypoventilation syndrome and suggest a\n\nWaardenburg syndrome: a rare cause of inherited neuropathy due to SOX10 mutation.\n\nPubMed\n\nBogdanova-Mihaylova, Petya; Alexander, Michael D; Murphy, Raymond P J; Murphy, SinÃ©ad M\n\n2017-09-01\n\nWaardenburg syndrome (WS) is a rare disorder comprising sensorineural deafness and pigmentation abnormalities. Four distinct subtypes are defined based on the presence or absence of additional symptoms. Mutations in six genes have been described in WS. SOX10 mutations are usually associated with a more severe phenotype of WS with peripher"
