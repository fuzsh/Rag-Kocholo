He succumbed to the complications arising from diabetes. His contribution to the understanding of the basic properties of relativistic plasmas remains a cornerstone when studying radiation processes in many astrophysical contexts. Roland was born on 6 May 1950 in Karlshamn, Sweden. At a young age he moved with his family to SkÃ¥ne, the southernmost part of Sweden. This is where he received his early education including a BS in Physics at the University of Lund in 1973. For the rest of his life, this region was home for Roland. His mother and father are Linnea Martinsson (d. 1984) and Sune Svensson. The two younger brothers are Lennart and Peter. Lennart works as a machine engineer in Sweden while Peter has settled in California as a biology professor. Roland started graduate studies in theoretical physics in Lund before receiving a Fulbright Scholarship in 1976. He then moved to the University of California in Santa Cruz and enrolled in the astronomy and astrophysics graduate program. Although his interest in astronomy had been raised during the time in Lund, it was the stimulating environment in Santa Cruz that convinced Roland to concentrate on research in astronomy. With Roland's attitude of never accepting anything unless he understood its roots, his extended background in physics served him well throughout his astronomy career; in particular, it influenced his choice of a thesis topic. At the time, the importance of relativistic temperatures attained by accreting matter in the immediate vicinity of neutron stars and black holes was becoming clear. Roland set out to make a detailed description of the physical effects electron-positron pair production and annihilation would have on such plasmas. In 1981 Roland defended his thesis titled ``Physical Properties in Relativistic Plasmas\" and completed his PhD under the supervision of Bill Mathews. Roland extended the results of his thesis during two post-docs, first at\n\nRoland Barthes and the family album\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPriscila Pesce Lopes Oliveira\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This communication examines photographs at the beginning of the book Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes, which work as a family album of sorts, and the photo of the Mother absent from Camera Lucida, and which is declaredly the bookâs source.

Obtained scores revealed a decline in estimated Full Scale IQ from the patient's expected premorbid level. Consistent with her initial onset of neuropathology in the left temporal lobe, the WASI-II yielded a difference of 53 standard score points between the Perceptual Reasoning and Verbal Comprehension composites, reflecting the patient's intact capabilities in visuospatial perception and construction in conjunction with marked disturbances of language. The similarities subtest was particularly sensitive to the patient's neurocognitive deficits. WASI-II scores corresponded well with the results obtained from other administered measures, in particular those from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Findings provide support for use of the WASI-II in the clinical evaluation of semantic dementia and offer preliminary evidence that the test may be helpful in both lateralization and localization of brain lesions.\n\nReading comprehension difficulties in children with rolandic epilepsy.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCurrie, Nicola K; Lew, Adina R; Palmer, Tom M; Basu, Helen; De Goede, Christian; Iyer, Anand; Cain, Kate\n\n2018-03-01\n\nDifficulties in reading comprehension can arise from either word reading or listening comprehension difficulties, or a combination of the two. We sought to determine whether children with rolandic epilepsy had poor reading comprehension relative to typically developing comparison children, and whether such difficulties were associated with word reading and/or general language comprehension difficulties. In this cross-sectional study, children with rolandic epilepsy (n=25; 16 males, 9 females; mean age 9y 1mo, SD 1y 7mo) and a comparison group (n=39; 25 males, 14 females; mean age 9y 1mo, SD 1y 3mo) completed assessments of reading comprehension, listening comprehension, word/non-word reading, speech articulation, and Non-verbal IQ. Reading comprehension and word reading were worse in children with rolandic epilepsy (F 1,61 =6.89, p=0.011, Î·p2=0.10 and F 1,61 =6.84, p=0.011, Î·p2=0.10 respectively), with listening comprehension being marginal (F 1,61 =3.81, p=0.055, Î·p2=0.06). Word reading and listening comprehension made large and independent contributions to reading comprehension, explaining 70% of the variance. Children with rolandic epilepsy may be at risk of reading comprehension difficulties. Thorough assessment of individual children is required to ascertain whether the difficulties lie with decoding text, or with general comprehension skills, or both. Children with rolandic epilepsy may be at risk of poor reading comprehension. This was related to poor word reading, poor listening comprehension, or both. Reading comprehension interventions should be tailored to the profile of difficulties.

It is considered that around 20%-30% of patients of all ages and in all continents have wrong epilepsy diagnoses. Diagnostic and consequential therapeutic errors appear, most often, when an adequate diagnostics is not applied. Benign focal epilepsy of childhoods with centrotemporal spikes-rolandic epilepsy, brings very often to diagnostic and therapeutic problems because of persistence of epilepticforms changes in an electroencephalography (EEG recording, several years after establishment of good control over seizures. Case report. We presented 8.5 years-old girl, with the first and the only epileptic seizure at the age of 5, during her sleep. With a clear correlation of EEG record, benign rolandic epilepsy was diagnosed, so the therapy with valproate was introduced. There were no seizures after three years of its implementation. Because of epileptic-forms changes that still persisted in EEG record during her sleep, it was suggested to further use valproate. However, after reconsidering all circumstances it was concluded that the AED should bee slowly reduced up to its exclusion. After a complete stoppage of the therapy, the patient did not have any epileptic seizure for nine months, although EEG still remained pathologically changed during her sleep. Conclusion. A changed EEG record in a patient with rolandic epilepsy must not be a predictor of continuation of antiepileptic drugs therapy, after 2-3 years of successful seizures remission.\n\nWavelet entropy of BOLD time series: An application to Rolandic epilepsy.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGupta, Lalit; Jansen, Jacobus F A; Hofman, Paul A M; Besseling, RenÃ© M H; de Louw, Anton J A; Aldenkamp, Albert P; Backes, Walter H\n\n2017-12-01\n\nTo assess the wavelet entropy for the characterization of intrinsic aberrant temporal irregularities in the time series of resting-state blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations. Further, to evaluate the temporal irregularities (disorder/order) on a voxel-by-voxel basis in the brains of children with Rolandic epilepsy. The BOLD time series was decomposed using the discrete wavelet transform and the wavelet entropy was calculated. Using a model time series consisting of multiple harmonics and nonstationary components, the wavelet entropy was compared with Shannon and spectral (Fourier-based) entropy. As an application, the wavelet entropy in 22 children with Rolandic epilepsy was compared to 22 age-matched healthy controls. The images were obtained by performing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using a 3T system, an 8-element receive-only head coil, and an echo planar imaging pulse sequence ( T2*-weighted). The wavelet entropy was also compared to spectral entropy, regional homogeneity, and Shannon entropy. Wavelet entropy was found to identify the nonstationary components of the model time series. In Rolandic epilepsy patients, a significantly elevated wavelet entropy was observed relative to controls for the whole cerebrum (Pâ=â0.03). Spectral entropy (Pâ=â0.41), regional homogeneity (Pâ=â0.52), and Shannon entropy (Pâ=â0.32) did not reveal significant differences. The wavelet entropy measure appeared more sensitive to detect abnormalities in cerebral fluctuations represented by nonstationary effects in the BOLD time series than more conventional measures. This effect was observed in the model time series as well as in Rolandic epilepsy. These observations suggest that the brains of children with Rolandic epilepsy exhibit stronger nonstationary temporal signal fluctuations than controls. 2 Technical Efficacy: Stage 3 J. Magn. Reson.

However, difficulties in verbal and visual memory and aspects of phonological awareness were found compared to normative data. To address the methodological limitations related to the use of normative data, we compared the same cohort of children with Benign Rolandic Epilepsy to a matched control group. Controls (n=40) matched on age and gender to the Benign Rolandic Epilepsy cohort underwent neuropsychological assessment. The life functioning of the control group was assessed using a modified version of the Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy Questionnaire (QOLCE). The study confirmed the previous findings of memory and phonological awareness difficulties. In addition, the children with Benign Rolandic Epilepsy had significantly lower IQ scores than the matched control group. Paired sample t-tests showed that on 8 of 11 QOLCE scales, children with Benign Rolandic Epilepsy were rated by parents as having poorer life functioning compared to matched controls, including lower parental ratings on the subscales of memory and language. Benign Rolandic Epilepsy has an excellent seizure prognosis, but this study further emphasizes potential cognitive difficulties. Using an age and gender matched control group, the previous findings of memory and phonological awareness difficulties were validated. These problems in cognition were also identified by parents of children with Benign Rolandic Epilepsy as problematic and impacting upon the child's quality of life.\n\nStorytelling Permutations in the Performance of Life Narrative Betty Roland's Caviar for Breakfast.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaureen Clark\n\n2013-11-01\n\nFull Text Available Throughout her life, Australian storyteller and playwright Betty Roland (1903-1996 was haunted by the lure of travel. Roland's extensive body of work reflects experiences in Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union in the 1930s, the UK in the 1950s and Greece in the 1960s and charts the evolution of a personal and political philosophy marked by world-wide social upheaval. Caviar for Breakfast (1979 revised 1989, the second volume of Roland's autobiographical trilogy, is the subject of this paper. When taken together, the three books provide a fascinating insight into the values and ideas of the mushrooming modern cultures in which Roland travelled, worked and lived. Caviar for Breakfast retraces Roland's adventures in Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union where she spent fifteen months during 1933-34 with her then lover, Guido Baracchi, a wealthy Marxist scholar. The narrative takes its life from the contents of a diary maintained by Roland during that time and her introductory remarks convey the notion that, what follows, is not a literary enterprise of the imagination. The author insists that Caviar for Breakfast is a first-hand account of past realities and not only does her diary hold the ordering of events together, but is the purveyor of truth. The truth status of the diary as a mode of representation is widely accepted in Western culture. This paper argues, however, that it is impossible for any transcription of a life to enjoy a one-to-one ratio with 'what actually happened' as it is for a ghost to re-enter a world which fully resembles the one it left. It is well within the capacity of any imaginative storyteller to construct a counterfeit, or simulated, sense of reality whether or not s/he works with the diary mode of representation.\n\nAcademic Performance in Children with Rolandic Epilepsy\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPiccinelli, P.; Borgatti, R.; Aldini, A.; Bindelli, D.; Ferri, M.; Perna, S.; Pitillo, G.; Termine, C.; Zambonin, F.; Balottin, U.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of reading, writing, and calculation disabilities in children with typical rolandic epilepsy (RE) and healthy control children.

In this study, we tested for a white matter (connectivity correlate, employing diffusion weighted MRI and language testing.Twenty-three children with RE and 23 matched controls (age: 8-14 years underwent structural (T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI (bâ=â1200 s/mm(2, 66 gradient directions at 3T, as well as neuropsychological language testing. Combining tractography and a cortical segmentation derived from the T1-scan, the rolandic tract were reconstructed (pre- and postcentral gyri, and tract fractional anisotropy (FA values were compared between patients and controls. Aberrant tracts were tested for correlations with language performance.Several reductions of tract FA were found in patients compared to controls, mostly in the left hemisphere; the most significant effects involved the left inferior frontal (pâ=â0.005 and supramarginal (pâ=â0.004 gyrus. In the patient group, lower tract FA values were correlated with lower language performance, among others for the connection between the left postcentral and inferior frontal gyrus (pâ=â0.043, Râ=â0.43.In RE, structural connectivity is reduced for several connections involving the rolandic regions, from which the epileptiform activity originates. Most of these aberrant tracts involve the left (typically language mediating hemisphere, notably the pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area and the supramarginal gyrus (Wernicke's area. For the former, reduced language performance for lower tract FA was found in the patients. These findings provide a first microstructural white matter correlate for language impairment in RE.\n\nThe Roland De Witte 1991 Experiment (to the Memory of Roland De Witte\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCahill R.

Hal ini mengakibatkan tema-tema tentang SARA menjadi sensitif ketika dibahas atau pun difilmkan. Hal ini mengakibatkan jarang ditemui film yang mengangkat tentang SARA. Lain halnya dengan Walt Disney. Walt Disney baru-baru ini merilis film kartun 3D yang mengangkat tema anti diskriminasi SARA yang berjudul Zootopia. Film ini menjadi menarik karena isu diskriminasi SARA yang diangkat dibalut dengan konsep yang kreatif hingga sensivitas isu SARA tersebut menjadi berkurang. Representasi anti diskriminasi SARA pada film Zootopia ini selanjutnya dikaji dengan metode semiotika Roland Barthes dengan pendekatan deskriptif kualitatif. Berdasarkan dari analisis, dapat disimpulkan bahwa film Zootopia memuat pesan ideologi tentang anti diskriminasi SARA bahwa kedudukan manusia dimata manusia yang lain pada hakikatnya adalah sama. Setiap manusia berhak dan wajib memperlakukan dan diperlakukan secara bijak tanpa memperdulikan background asal manusia itu sendiri. Penghargaan pada setiap individu tidak didasarkan pada faktor keturunan, ras, suku ataupun agama, namun didasarkan pada prestasi dari individu itu sendiri.

What is proposed here is to offer subsidies to elucidate this important work, which, thirty years after its formation, it hasnât been so much studied, and its huge contribution to science communication got lost, and especially the reflections on the role of photographic image in the contemporary world.

In this study, we explored if structural microdeletions and exonic sequence variations in RBFOX1, RBFOX2, RBFOX3 confer susceptibility to rolandic epilepsy (RE), a common idiopathic focal childhood epilepsy. By high-density SNP array screening...... that exon deletions and truncating mutations of RBFOX1 and RBFOX3 contribute to the genetic variance of partial and generalized idiopathic epilepsy syndromes....\n\nANALISIS SEMIOTIKA ROLAND BARTHES TENTANG FENOMENA JILBOOBS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHamidah Hamidah\n\n2016-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Hijab/jilbab is a cloth to cover all of womenâs body except face and two palms. Now, there is one controversial Hijab trend, which is Jilboobs phenomenon. Basically, jilboobs means have deviation meaning from the nature of veil. Jilboobs is a critic to Muslim women who wear hijab, but they still wear tight dress or blouse. It causes their indentation body looked very clear, especially in her chest. Then, the jilboobs phenomenon is a sign in fashion culture which very interference how Muslim teenagers to dress up now. The function of jibab is not to cover women genitals anymore, but it becomes a mode that break out the religion rules. The jilboobs phenomenon is a negative connotation from the real jilbab function. The writers used Semiotics theory from Roland Barthes to discuss this jilboobs phenomenon. It tried to reveal about abusing the real jilbab function as covering Muslim womenâs genitals and a religion symbol.\n\n16p11.2 600 kb Duplications confer risk for typical and atypical Rolandic epilepsy\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nReinthaler, Eva M; Lal, Dennis; Lebon, Sebastien\n\n2014-01-01\n\nRolandic epilepsy (RE) is the most common idiopathic focal childhood epilepsy.

Translation of two functional status questionnaires and a cross-sectional study of measurement properties. The questionnaires were translated and back-translated following the Guillemin criteria. The Norwegian versions were tested for 55 patients with acute low back pain and 50 patients with chronic low back pain. Test-retest with a 2-day interval was performed in a subsample of 28 patients from the chronic sample. Reliability was assessed by repeatability according to Bland and Altman, intraclass coefficient and coefficient of variation. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach's alpha. Concurrent construct validity was assessed with correlations between the questionnaires and the SF-36, Disability Rating Index and pain intensity. Repeatability of the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire was 4 points, coefficient of variation 15% and intraclass correlation coefficient 0.89, and of the modified Oswestry Disability Index 11, 12% and 0.88, respectively. Internal consistency was 0.94 for both questionnaires. The questionnaires correlated highly with the physical functioning scale of SF-36, moderately with pain, and low with mental scales of the SF-36. The reliability and construct validity of the Norwegian versions of the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire and the modified Oswestry Disability Index are acceptable for assessing functional status of Norwegian-speaking patients with low back pain.\n\nRoland Barthes na revista LÃ­ngua e Literatura (USP\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLaura Taddei Brandini\n\n2015-06-01\n\nFull Text Available This article aims to describe and analyze the reception to the works of Roland Barthes in SÃ£o Pauloâs academic criticism. To achieve this goal, we study articles published in University of SÃ£o Pauloâs magazine LÃ­ngua e Literatura, established in 1972 and still in circulation. The selection of Barthesâ concepts in articles from the magazine highlights the dynamics that governs the perception of the image of the French writer in every Brazilian historical moment: from leader of structuralism, in the 70s, to the post-modern libertarian in the 2000s, we can not only see a difference in the appreciation of his writings, but also a change of the profile of academic critics.\n\nAberrant functional connectivity between motor and language networks in rolandic epilepsy.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBesseling, RenÃ© M H; Overvliet, Geke M; Jansen, Jacobus F A; van der Kruijs, Sylvie J M; Vles, Johannes S H; Ebus, Saskia C M; Hofman, Paul A M; de Louw, Anton J A; Aldenkamp, Albert P; Backes, Walter H\n\n2013-12-01\n\nRolandic epilepsy (RE) is an idiopathic focal childhood epilepsy with a well-established neuropsychological profile of language impairment. The aim of this study is to provide a functional correlate that links rolandic (sensorimotor) pathology to language problems using functional MRI. Twenty-three children with RE (8-14 years old) and 21 matched controls underwent extensive language assessment (Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals). fMRI was performed at rest and using word generation, reading, and finger tapping paradigms. Since no activation group differences were found, regions of interest (ROIs) were defined at pooled (patients and controls combined) activation maxima and in contralateral homotopic cortex, and used to assess language lateralization as well as for a resting-state connectivity analysis. Furthermore, the association between connection strength and language performance was investigated. Reduced language performance was found in the children with RE. Bilateral activation was found for both language tasks with some predominance of the left hemisphere in both groups. Compared to controls, patient connectivity was decreased between the left sensorimotor area and right inferior frontal gyrus (planguage scores in the patient group (r=0.49, p=0.02), but not in the controls. Language laterality analysis revealed bilateral language representation in the age range under study (8-14 years). As a consequence, the connection of reduced functional connectivity we found represents an impaired interplay between motor and language networks, and aberrant functional connectivity associated with poorer language performance. These findings provide a first neuronal correlate in terms of aberrant resting-state functional connectivity for language impairment in RE. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Note sur la derniÃ¨re vie de Roland Barthes\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaÃ¯tÃ© Snauwaert\n\n2013-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Les remarques sur la tenue de la maison et du corps dans le quotidien domestique, conÃ§ue comme une Ã©thique de la fidÃ©litÃ© Ã la mÃ¨re rÃ©cemment disparue, apparaissent dans lâÃ©crit privÃ© du Journal de deuil de Roland Barthes comme un Ã©cho des observations faites dans le cours sur La prÃ©paration du roman. Participant dâune physique du vivre et de lâhabiter qui met lâaccent sur lâentretien quotidien du lieu, le silence et la difficultÃ© de tout voyage, les Â«Â notationsÂ Â» du journal rendent compte de la condensation dans le corps de lâÃ©preuve du deuil, et de la prise de conscience dâun dernier Ã¢ge de la vie.In the personal writings of Journal de deuil, Roland Barthesâ remarks regarding the maintenance of the home and body are conceived of as an ethic of faithfulness to his recently deceased mother. They are considered in this article as an echo to the observations he makes during his lectures in the course La prÃ©paration du roman. Both emphasize the physicality of everyday life and the role played by oneâs relationship to the home. By stressing the necessity of silence and the difficulties of leaving âthe apartmentâ, the brief ânotationsâ in the diary translate the physical concentration of the mourning experience, as well as the emergent understanding of a final stage of life.\n\nRasch scaling of the Oswestry Disability Index and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nLauridsen, Henrik Hein; Hartvigsen, Jan\n\nQuestionnaire (RMQ) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), however, only few studies have tested these questionnaires using Rasch analysis.

Phys , 2006, v. 2(3, 60â65, R.T. Cahill gives us a briefing on his view that interferometer measurements and one-way RF coaxial cable propagation-time measure- ments amount to a detection of the anisotropy in the speed of light. However, while I obtain first order propagation delays in calculations for on e-way transit which would show geometric modulation by Earthâs rotation, I do not agree with Cahillâs simplistic equation that relates the modulation solely to the projection of the absolute velocity vector v on the coaxial cable, called v P by Cahill (ibid., p. 61â62. The reader should be warned that Cahillâs equation for â t (ibid., p.63 is crude compared with a full Special Relativistic derivation.\n\nRoland Barthes and the Great Proletarian Revolution China: An Approach to Autobiographical Writing in Diary of My Trip to China\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCecilia Lerena Mcmillan\n\n2015-02-01\n\nFull Text Available The present paper propose to investigate how the autobiographical subject is constructed in the text Carnets du voyage en Chine wich was written in 1974 by Roland Barthes. Another objective of this work will be indicate that Carnets can be understand as a space of problematization of the literary theory about the french autobiographical genre. The text of study will have as a distinctive mark the immediacy of living events in China and the time of his writing, where, the artifice of writing will allow the author construct themselves as a french man with a bourgeois formation in the context of the Great Chinese Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This context and details of the experience itself will set the tone of the story of Roland Barthes. We propose then, search the expression of the need to write as an organic need, and also as an imperative need of the bourgeois formation, who, at the same time rejects the subject but cannot ignored it.\n\nArte, imagem e fotografia: um diÃ¡logo possÃ­vel entre Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin e Jacques RanciÃ¨re = Art, image and photography: a possible dialogue between Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin and Jacques RanciÃ¨re\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nVoigt, AndrÃ© Fabiano\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available O presente artigo objetiva estabelecer um diÃ¡logo entre trÃªs autores que escreveram trabalhos importantes sobre a relaÃ§Ã£o da arte com as imagens e a fotografia.

The mandate will be revealed by Roland Barthes' semiotic theory in the book S/Z. Literature has its own allure and text have accrued but not due to independence because of the difference in quality. Texts merge into a unity, or restore any text not as an individual but as a form of plurality. Literature as part of a social system is an expression of the author's sense of the outpouring of public life. Literary works can express themselves in the author's view the social and cultural changes in society because of the development of information technology and rapid. Technological developments and socio-cultural information can change in society so as to affect the psychology of the people.

Cross-cultural adaptation, test-retest, and cross-sectional psychometric testing. Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire was forward and back translated by clinical/non-clinical translators. An expert committee appraised the translations. Twelve participants with chronic low back pain pre-tested the measure in a rural Nigerian community. Internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha; test-retest reliability using intra-class correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman plot; and minimal detectable change were investigated in a convenient sample of 50 people with chronic low back pain in rural and urban Nigeria. Pearson's correlation analyses using the eleven-point box scale and back performance scale, and exploratory factor analysis were used to examine construct validity in a random sample of 200 adults with chronic low back pain in rural Nigeria. Ceiling and floor effects were investigated in the two samples. Modifications gave the option of interviewer-administration and reflected Nigerian social context. The measure had excellent internal consistency (Î±â=â0.91) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC =0.84), moderately high correlations (râ>â0.6) with performance-based disability and pain intensity, and a predominant uni-dimensional structure, with no ceiling or floor effects. Igbo Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire is a valid and reliable measure of pain-related disability. Implications for rehabilitation Low back pain is the leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide, and is particularly prevalent in rural Nigeria, but there are no self-report measures to assess its impact due to low literacy rates. This study describes the cross-cultural adaptation and validation of a core self-report back pain specific disability measure in a low-literate Nigerian population.

Coetzee, Roland Barthes and Edward Said\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSandra Lila Maya Rota\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The present study investigates the different approaches to autobiography of three writers â John M. Coetzee, Edward Said and Roland Barthes â who are divided by background and historical circumstances but share the terrain of postcolonial and postmodern theory. In particular, the focus is on the use they make of photographs â real or evoked â that accompany their personal accounts. Using photography as a counterpoint and a parallel to autobiography, they all try and come to terms with issues of subjectivity, representation and authenticity. As a result, their life-long convictions will be challenged by the power of memory, leaving way to a renewed sense of self.\n\nAuthor in cyberspace: comparison of the current position of the author and authorship anonymity with theories of Michel Foucault and Roland Barthes\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nBobÃ¡k, Alexander\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis thesis analyzes the position of the author in the environment of internet.

In addition, a comparison of game characteristics in an individual set between winners and losers has been made. It was ascertained that there are statistically characteristic differences in most variables between the winners and loser in the category of men as well as in the category of women. In the category of men, there are statistically characteristic differences in all variables except in the break point conversions. In women however, there are statistically characteristic differences in all variables except in the number of won aces. Based on these findings it can be concluded that statistically characteristic differences in the majority of variables, which define game characteristics, indicate that there are certain measurable indicators of tennis statistics, which distinguish\n\nEvaluation of the effectiveness of short-term rehabilitation of women with chronic low back pain using the Oswestry and Roland-Morris Disability Scales.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTopolska, Marta; SapuÅa, RafaÅ; Topolski, Adam; Marczewski, Krzysztof\n\n2011-01-01\n\n60-80% of the population experience chronic low back pain at some point in their lives [1], with women suffering more frequently [2]. Low back pain-related ailments lead to long-term or recurrent disability [3, 4]. Rehabilitation based on physiotherapy provides a viable alternative and is rightly regarded as safer for patients. However, finding an effective method of rehabilitation is a difficult task [5, 6]. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of rehabilitation in women with chronic low back pain using the Oswestry and Roland-Morris Disability Scales and to identify factors influencing the degree of functional disability in patients with chronic low back pain. The study involved 319 women aged 18-75 years (mean age = 45 years, SD Â± 16. 3). The participants were undergoing treatment at the Rehabilitation Centre of ZamoÅÄ University of Management and Administration on account of chronic low back pain, following two or more episodes lasting longer than three months. The outcomes of rehabilitation were assessed with ODI and RMDQ. We obtained comparable results with the ODI and RMDQ and found statistically significant improvement in functional status after rehabilitation (ODI: p disability and age (ODI: p disability vs. place of residence (ODI: p disability, as demonstrated both by the Oswestry Disability Index and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. 2. The relationship between the degree of functional disability and age, BMI, WHR, and hypertension was also confirmed by both questionnaires.\n\nA destruiÃ§Ã£o da imaginaÃ§Ã£o e a permanÃªncia da utopia: Desenvolvimento, Tecnologia e Cultura em Roland Corbisier\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nQueluz, Gilson Leandro; Merkle, Luiz Ernesto\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAbordamos neste texto algumas das reflexÃµes desenvolvidas por Roland Corbisier sobre as tÃ©cnicas em suas relaÃ§Ãµes com as sociedades.

The objective was to evaluate the chemical, physical-chemical and antioxidant activity of eight varieties of acerola tree. The acerolas used in the research were the harvest 2015, 8 varieties: BRS 235 - Apodi, MirandÃ³polis, Waldy - CATI 30, BRS 238 - Frutacor, Okinawa, BRS 236 - Cereja, Olivier and BRS 237 - Roxinha, from the Active Bank Germplasm APTA Regional Alta Paulista in Adamantina - SP. Avaluated the following attributes: pH, titratable acidity, soluble solids, reducing sugar, instrumental color, ascorbic acid, total phenolics, flavonoids and antioxidant activity. The design was completely randomized, 8 varieties and 3 replications of 20 fruits each. Acerola fruit of the analyzed varieties prove to be good sources of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity, ensuring its excellent nutritional quality relative to combat free radicals. The variety BRS 236 - Cereja presents higher ascorbic acid content, antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds, and the lowest value for flavonoid, which was higher than the other cultivars, especially Olivier and Waldy CATI-30.\n\nDelayed convergence between brain network structure and function in rolandic epilepsy\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRene MH Besseling\n\n2014-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Introduction Rolandic epilepsy (RE manifests during a critical phase of brain development, and has been associated with language impairments. Concordant abnormalities in structural and functional connectivity (SC and FC have been described before. As SC and FC are under mutual influence, the current study investigates abnormalities in the SC-FC synergy in RE. Methods Twenty-two children with RE (age, meanÂ±SD: 11.3Â±2.0 y and 22 healthy controls (age 10.5Â±1.6 y underwent structural, diffusion weighted, and functional MRI at 3T. The probabilistic anatomical landmarks atlas was used to parcellate the (subcortical gray matter. Constrained spherical deconvolution tractography and correlation of time series were used to assess SC and FC, respectively. The SC-FC correlation was assessed as a function of age for the non-zero structural connections over a range of sparsity values (0.01-0.75. A modularity analysis was performed on the mean SC network of the controls to localize potential global effects to subnetworks. SC and FC were also assessed separately using graph analysis.Results The SC-FC correlation was significantly reduced in children with RE compared to healthy controls, especially for the youngest participants. This effect was most pronounced in a left and a right centro-temporal network, as well as in a medial parietal network. Graph analysis revealed no prominent abnormalities in SC or FC network organization.Conclusion Since SC and FC converge during normal maturation, our finding of reduced SC-FC correlation illustrates impaired synergy between brain structure and function. More specifically, since this effect was most pronounced in the youngest participants, RE may represent a developmental disorder of delayed brain network maturation. The observed effects seem especially attributable to medial parietal connections, which forms an intermediate between bilateral centro-temporal modules of epileptiform activity, and bear relevance for\n\nTantrums, Emotion Reactions and Their EEG Correlates in Childhood Benign Rolandic Epilepsy vs. Complex Partial Seizures: Exploratory Observations.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPotegal, Michael; Drewel, Elena H; MacDonald, John T\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe explored associations between EEG pathophysiology and emotional/behavioral (E/B) problems of children with two types of epilepsy using standard parent questionnaires and two new indicators: tantrums recorded by parents at home and brief, emotion-eliciting situations in the laboratory. Children with Benign Rolandic epilepsy (BRE, N = 6) reportedly had shorter, more angry tantrums from which they recovered quickly. Children with Complex Partial Seizures (CPS, N = 13) had longer, sadder tantrums often followed by bad moods. More generally, BRE correlated with anger and aggression; CPS with sadness and withdrawal. Scores of a composite group of siblings ( N = 11) were generally intermediate between the BRE and CPS groups. Across all children, high voltage theta and/or interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) correlated with negative emotional reactions. Such EEG abnormalities in left hemisphere correlated with greater social fear, right hemisphere EEG abnormalities with greater anger. Right hemisphere localization in CPS was also associated with parent-reported problems at home. If epilepsy alters neural circuitry thereby increasing negative emotions, additional assessment of anti-epileptic drug treatment of epilepsy-related E/B problems would be warranted.\n\nReconsidering the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire: time for a multidimensional framework?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMagnussen, Liv Heide; Lygren, Hildegunn; Strand, Liv Inger; Hagen, Eli Molde; Breivik, Kyrre\n\n2015-02-15\n\nCross-sectional design. To explore (1) the factor structure of the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), (2) whether there is a dominant factor, and (3) whether the potential factors are unique predictors of other aspects related to back pain. The RMDQ is one of the most recommended back-specific questionnaires assessing disability. The RMDQ is scored as a unidimensional scale summarizing answers to all 24 questions (Yes/No) regarding daily life functioning. However, there are indications that the scale is multidimensional. Patients (n = 457; age, 18-60 yr) with 8 to 12 weeks of back pain filled in questionnaires assessing subjective health complaints, emotional distress, instrumental and emotion-focused coping, and fear voidance behavior at baseline. A total of 371 patients (81.7%) filled in the RMDQ. Exploratory factor analysis was used to examine the factor structure of RMDQ items. Multiple regression analyses were used to assess whether the derived factors predicted relevant problems in back pain differently. Exploratory factor analysis showed indices of model fit for a 3-factor solution after removing 2 items because of low prevalence (19 and 24). Two items were removed because of cross-loadings and low loadings (2 and 22). No support for a dominant factor was found as the 3 factors were only moderately correlated (r = 0.34-0.40), and the ratio between the first and second eigenvalue was 2.6, not supporting essential unidimensionality. \"Symptoms\" were the factor that most strongly predicted subjective health complaints, whereas \"avoidance of activity and participation\" predicted fear avoidance behavior, instrumental and emotional coping. \"Limitation in daily activities\" did not predict any of these variables. The main findings of our study are that the RMDQ consists of 3 independent factors, and not 1 dominant factor as suggested previously. We think the time is now ripe to start treating and scoring the RMDQ as a multidimensional scale.

Wagner-Lawlor\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The theorizing of utopia is a persistent theme throughout several generations of the French continental tradition, and alongside the process theory of Alfred North Whitehead to a large degree recuperates the concept of utopia from its supposed dismissal by Marx and his intellectual descendants. Most recently, attention to the notion of plasticity, popularized (relatively speaking by Catherine Malabou, extends speculation on utopian possibility. Â Compelled to answer to Marxâs denigration of utopia as fantasy, the tendency was (still is, for many to compensate for the absence of a programmatic politics by stressing what is âusefulâ about utopian dreaming, and therefore where or how exactly a utopian text reveals or creates political drive, or motivates political action. In this essay, I argue that theorists have overlooked the use of utopia as not only the reproduction of difference, or what Malabou calls positive plasticity, but also as, therefore, a disruption; Malabou might prefer the term accident here. Tracing the concept of plasticity from Roland Barthes to Malabou, with a nod at Miguel Abensour, this essay teases out the links between a contemporary notion of plasticity to argue, simply put, that utopia is plastic. This plasticity of the concept ensures its political force. These links, obscured in the essay âPlastic,â Barthes makes only later in his writing. But for Malabou, plasticity underlies a principle of futurity and/as generativity, such that new forms, new meanings, new concepts emerge through difference. Utopiaâs horizons of potentiality depend on difference, and on non-achievement. Finally, I argue that the persistence of utopia (Abensour as a form of thinking is the most important, and political, effect of utopian plasticity.\n\nLâArioste et lâEmpire.

Buchanan\n\n2007-01-01\n\nused in South Africa to facilitate clinical decision-making or document treatment outcomes for patients with low back pain (LBP. This study investigated the internal consistency and clinical utility of a back-specific functional status measure, the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ, and determined its ability to confirm the need for spinal fusion surgery. Method: Aretrospective, descriptive design was used with 42 patients with chronic mechanical low back pain who consulted a private Orthopaedic surgeon in Cape Town over a one yearÂ period. All patients completed the RMDQ prior to their consultation. On completion of the medical examination, a rating for surgery was determined for each patient. The completed questionnaires were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS. Results: The mean RMDQ score was 8.6 (N=42; median=9.0; range=2-21. Cronbachâs alpha showed a high internal consistency between items (.92. A categorical principal component analysis (CATPCA identified two distinct dimensions in the RMDQ. Item reduction improved the internal consistency and thus the construct validity of the RMDQ. There was a low correlation between the surgeonâs rating for surgery and RMDQ scores (r=.40; P<.01. Conclusion: The RMDQ shows some good psychometric properties but some adjustments could improve it. The RMDQ cannot be used to predict the need for spinal fusion surgery.\n\nCross-cultural Adaptation of Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire Needs to Assess the Measurement Properties: A Systematic Review.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYao, Min; Zhu, Sen; Tian, Zi-Rui; Song, Yong-Jia; Yang, Long; Wang, Yong-Jun; Cui, Xue-Jun\n\n2018-03-26\n\nTo assess the cross cultural-adaptations of the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). English and Chinese databases were searched through December 2017. Cross-cultural adaptation and measurement properties were evaluated using the Guidelines for the Process of Cross-Cultural Adaptation of Self-Report Measures and the Quality Criteria for Psychometric Properties of Health Status Questionnaire. Among 34 studies, there were 31 RMDQ adaptations for 26 different languages/cultures. In the cross-cultural adaptation process, few studies reported expert committees completely constituted (3/31), and only ten studies complete the test of the pre-final version (10/31) due to insufficient sample sizes. As for the measurement properties, content validity (31/31) and construct validity (24/31) were assessed in most of the adaptations, whereas internal consistency (0/31), agreement (5/31), responsiveness (3/31), interpretability (6/31), and floor and ceiling effects (6/31) were not. The Hungarian and Moon's Korean adaptations were the highest quality translations. Where there were multiple adaptations for a language/culture, the Moon's Korean and Fan's simplified Chinese-Chinese Mainland adaptations are recommended over the other Korean or simplified Chinese-Chinese Mainland adaptations. Further studies are required to fully assess the measurement properties of the Arabic-Moroccan, Arabic-Tunisian, German- Austrian, Greek, Guajarati, Kim's Korean, Persian-Iranian, Polish, He's simplified Chinese-Chinese Mainland, Spanish, Spanish-Chilean, Thai, traditional Chinese-Taiwan, and Turkish adaptations of the RMDQ.

An Introduction\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMarÃ­a Lourdes GasillÃ³n\n\n2016-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The production of Roland Barthes (1915-1980 is abundant and varied to the point where critical studies about his writing âand even, according to the own semiologistâ have established different âphasesâ in the development of his thought. In this paper, we intend to observe two of those moments in BarthesÂ´ theorizing, which coincide with the prevailing theoretical currents in France between the Â´60s and Â´70s: the structuralism and the post-structuralism. With this goal, we will analize two central texts in the semiotics of Barthes: âIntroduction to the structural analysis of narrativesâ (1966 and âFrom work to textâ (1971. The comparison of both works will allow us to observe the epistemological point of view and the model which the author adopted in each moment. It includes a change of perspective on the language, setting the concept of âstoryâ (and others related as âlevels of consciousnessâ, âthe story grammarâ, distortion and expansion operations, etc. aside and using âtextâ as a methodological field held in language and his associated notions: game, practice, production, death of the author, among others.\n\nCross-cultural Adaptation, Reliability, and Validity of the Yoruba Version of the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMbada, Chidozie Emmanuel; Idowu, Opeyemi Ayodiipo; Ogunjimi, Olawale Richard; Ayanniyi, Olusola; Orimolade, Elkanah Ayodele; Oladiran, Ajibola Babatunde; Johnson, Olubusola Esther; Akinsulore, Adesanmi; Oni, Temitope Olawale\n\n2017-04-01\n\nA translation, cross-cultural adaptation, and psychometric analysis. The aim of this study was to translate, cross-culturally adapt, and validate the Yoruba version of the RMDQ. The Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) is a valid outcome tool for low back pain (LBP) in clinical and research settings. There seems to be no valid and reliable version of the RMDQ in the Nigerian languages. Following the Guillemin criteria, the English version of the RMDQ was forward and back translated. Two Yoruba translated versions of the RMDQ were assessed for clarity, common language usage, and conceptual equivalence. Consequently, a harmonized Yoruba version was produced and was pilot-tested among 20 patients with nonspecific long-term LBP (NSLBP) for cognitive debriefing. The final version of the Yoruba RMDQ was tested for its construct validity and re-retest reliability among 120 and 87 patients with NSLBP, respectively. Pearson product moment correlation coefficient (r) of 0.82 was obtained for reliability of the Yoruba version of the RMDQ. The test-retest reliability of the Yoruba RMDQ yielded Cronbach alpha 0.932, while the intraclass correlation (ICC) ranged between 0.896 and 0.956. The analysis of the global scores of both the English and Yoruba versions of the RMDQ yielded ICC value of between 0.995 (95% confidence interval 0.996-0.997), with the item-by-item Kappa agreement ranging between 0.824 and 1.000. The external validity of RMDQ using Quadruple Visual Analogue Scale was râ=â-0.596 (Pâ=â0.001). The Yoruba version of the RMDQ had no floor/ceiling effects, as no patient achieved either of the maximum or the minimum possible scores. The Yoruba version of the RMDQ has excellent reliability and validity and may be an appropriate outcome tool for clinical and research purposes among Yoruba-speaking patients with LBP. 3.\n\nA Comparison of Back Pain Functional Scale with Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, Oswestry Disability Index and Short Form 36-Health Survey.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKoÃ§, Meltem; Bayar, Banu; Bayar, KÄ±lÄ±Ã§han\n\n2017-10-03\n\nA comparison study of Back Pain Functional Scale (BPFS) with Roland Morris Questionnaire (RMQ), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Short Form 36-Health Survey (SF-36). The aim of this study is to investigate the correlation of BPFS with RMQ, ODI and SF-36. The primary goal in the treatment of patients with low back pain is to improve the patients' levels of activities and participation. Many questionnaires focusing on function have been developed in patients with low back pain. BPFS is one of these questionnaires. No studies have investigated the correlation of BPFS with ODI and SF-36. This study was conducted with 120 patients receiving outpatient and inpatient treatment in physiotherapy and rehabilitation units of a state hospital. BPFS, RMQ, ODI, SF-36 questionnaires were used to assess the disability in low back pain. Spearman and Pearson Correlation were used to compare the data obtained in the study. There was a good correlation among the five functional outcome measures (correlation râ=â-0.693 for BPFS/RMQ, râ=â-0.794 for BPFS/ODI, râ=â0.697 for BPFS/SF-36 Physical function and râ=â0.540 for BPFS/SF-36 Pain). BPFS demonstrated good correlation with RMQ, ODI, SF-36 physical function and SF-36 pain. 2.\n\nO QUE Ã O ESPORTE?

Braga\n\n2002-09-01\n\nFull Text Available PURPOSE:This study compared some morphological features of individual rolandic epileptiform discharges, used to obtain an averaged estimate, with those of the resulting estimate. METHOD: Twenty-four averaged discharges from EEGs of 24 children showing rolandic spikes were compared with 480 individual discharges used in the averaging. The analysis was based on the occurrence of tangential dipole and \"double spike\" patterns. RESULTS: In 15 averaged discharges the tangential dipole pattern was found. Individual spikes used in the averaging process displayed the same pattern in 35-100% of them; in the remaining 9 averaged discharges, up to 20% of the individual spikes showed the same pattern, although this was not found in the averaged waveforms. \"Double spike\" pattern was found in 11 of the averaged waveforms and was recognized in 50-100% of its individual discharges, whereas up to 45% of individual spikes showed this pattern without expression in the averaged waveform. CONCLUSION: When visually analyzing an EEG with rolandic spikes, caution should be exercised in characterizing these patterns, since a few discharges showing them may not be expressed in the averaged waveform and the clinical correlations proposed for these patterns may not apply.OBJETIVO: Comparar as caracterÃ­sticas morfolÃ³gicas das descargas epileptiformes rolÃ¢ndicas individuais usadas para se obter uma descarga promediada com a resultante promediada.

Brief screening evaluations may reduce test duration and allow more efficient use of time by permitting greater attention toward neuropsychological domains showing probable deficits. The Design Organization Test (DOT) was initially developed as a 2-min paper-and-pencil alternative for the Block Design (BD) subtest of the Wechsler scales. Although initially validated for clinical neurologic patients, we sought to further establish the reliability and validity of this test in a healthy, more diverse population. Two alternate versions of the DOT and the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) were administered to 61 healthy adult participants. The DOT showed high alternate forms reliability (rÂ =Â .90-.92), and the two versions yielded equivalent levels of performance. The DOT was highly correlated with BD (rÂ =Â .76-.79) and was significantly correlated with all subscales of the WASI. The DOT proved useful when used in lieu of BD in the calculation of WASI IQ scores. Findings support the reliability and validity of the DOT as a measure of visuospatial ability and suggest its potential worth as an efficient estimate of intellectual functioning in situations where lengthier tests may be inappropriate or unfeasible.\n\nCognitive and behavioral comorbidities in Rolandic epilepsy and their relation with default mode network's functional connectivity and organization.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nOfer, Isabell; Jacobs, Julia; Jaiser, Nathalie; Akin, Burak; Hennig, JÃ¼rgen; Schulze-Bonhage, Andreas; LeVan, Pierre\n\n2018-01-01\n\nRolandic epilepsy (RE) is characterized by typical interictal-electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns mainly localized in centrotemporal and parietooccipital areas. An aberrant intrinsic organization of the default mode network (DMN) due to repeated disturbances from spike-generating areas may be able to account for specific cognitive deficits and behavioral problems in RE. The aim of the present study was to investigate cognitive development (CD) and socioemotional development (SED) in patients with RE during active disease in relation to DMN connectivity and network topology. In 10 children with RE and active EEG, CD was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (WISC-IV); SED was assessed using the FÃ¼nf-Faktoren-Fragebogen fÃ¼r Kinder (FFFK), a Big-Five inventory for the assessment of personality traits in children. Functional connectivity (FC) in the DMN was determined from a 15-minute resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and network properties were calculated using standard graph-theoretical measures. More severe deficits of verbal abilities tended to be associated with an earlier age at epilepsy onset, but were not directly related to the number of seizures and disease duration. Nonetheless, at the network level, disease duration was associated with alterations of the efficiency and centrality of parietal network nodes and midline structures. Particularly, centrality of the left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) was found to be linked with CD. Reduced centrality of the left IPL and alterations supporting a rather segregated processing within DMN's subsystems was associated with a more favorable CD. A more complicated SED was associated with high seizure frequency and long disease duration, and revealed links with a less favorable CD. An impaired CD and - because of their interrelation - SED might be mediated by a common pathomechanism reflected in an aberrant organization, and thus, a potential functional deficit of the DMN\n\nResponsiveness of the Oswestry Disability Index and the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire in Italian subjects with sub-acute and chronic low back pain.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMonticone, Marco; Baiardi, Paola; Vanti, Carla; Ferrari, Silvano; Pillastrini, Paolo; Mugnai, Raffaele; Foti, Calogero\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAn ability to assess longitudinal changes in health status is crucial for the outcome measures used in treatment efficacy trials. The aim of this study was to verify the responsiveness of the Italian versions of the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) in subjects with subacute or chronic low back pain (LBP). At the beginning and end of an 8Â week rehabilitation programme, 179 patients completed a booklet containing the ODI, the RMDQ, a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS), and the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). A global perception of change scale was also completed at the end of the programme, and collapsed to produce a dichotomous outcome (i.e. improved vs. not improved). Responsiveness was assessed by means of distribution methods [minimum detectable change (MDC); effect size (ES); standardised response mean (SRM)] and anchor-based methods (ROC curves). The MDC for the ODI and RMDQ was, respectively, 13.67 and 4.87; the ES was 0.53 and 0.68; and the SRM was 0.80 and 0.81. ROC analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.71 for the ODI and 0.64 for the RMDQ, thus indicating discriminating capacity; the best cut-off point for the dichotomous outcome was 9.5 for the ODI (sensitivity 76% and specificity 63%) and 2.5 for the RMDQ (sensitivity 62% and specificity 55%). These estimates were comparable between the subacute and chronic subjects. Both the ODI and the RMDQ moderately correlated with the SF-36 and NRS (Spearman's and Pearson's correlation coefficients of >0.30). The Italian ODI and RMDQ proved to be sensitive in detecting clinical changes after conservative treatment for subacute and chronic LBP. Our findings are consistent with those published in the literature, thus allowing cross-cultural comparisons and stimulating cross-national studies.\n\nPre-Assessment and Peer Tutoring as Measures to Improve Performance in Gateway General Chemistry Classes\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAllenbaugh, R.

To cross-culturally translate the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ), and Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale (QDS) into Persian, and then investigate the psychometric properties of the Persian versions produced. To the authors' knowledge, there is no validated instrument to measure functional status in Persian-speaking patients with low back pain (LBP) in Iran. To our knowledge, the widely used back-specific measures, the ODI, RDQ, and QDS, have not been translated and validated for Persian-speaking patients with LBP. The translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the original questionnaires were performed in accordance with published guidelines. A total of 100 patients with chronic LBP were asked to complete a questionnaire booklet (the Persian versions of the ODI, RDQ, QDS, Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), and visual analog scale measure of pain). There were 31 randomly select patients with chronic LBP asked to complete the second questionnaire booklet 24 hours later. The Cronbach-alpha for the ODI, RDQ, and QDS was 0.75, 0.83, and 0.92, respectively. The ODI, RDQ, and QDS showed excellent test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.91, 0.86, and 0.86, respectively) (P < 0.01). The correlation among the ODI, RDQ, QDS and physical functioning scales of the SF-36 was -0.66, -0.62, and -0.69, respectively (P < 0.001). The correlation among the ODI, RDQ, and QDS and visual analog scale was 0.54, 0.36, and 0.46, respectively (P < 0.001). The Persian versions of the ODI, RDQ, and QDS are reliable and valid instruments to measure functional status in Persian-speaking patients with LBP. They are simple and fast scales, and the use of them can be recommended in a clinical setting and future outcome studies in Iran.\n\nPlaadid / Immo Mihkelson\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nMihkelson, Immo, 1959-\n\n2002-01-01\n\nUutest plaatidest Robert Plant \"Dreamfield\", Roland Gift \"Roland Gift\", Joe Cocker \"Respect Yourself\", Piano Circus \"Transmission\", Tricky \"A Ruff Guide\", Jack Johnson \"Brushfire Fairytales\", Yann Tiersen \"Amelie from Montmartre\", Hall & Oates \"The Essential Collection\"\n\n76 FR 31943 - Global Positioning System Directorate (Gpsd); Notice of Meeting\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2011-06-02\n\n...); Notice of Meeting ACTION: Notice of Meeting--Public Interface Control Working Group (ICWG) for Signals-in... that the Global Positioning Systems (GPS) Directorate will be hosting a Public Interface Control... the Was/Is Matrix, current versions of the documents, and the official meeting notice will be posted...\n\nRoland Barthes' \"Text\" and aleatoric music: Is \"The birth of the reader\" the birth of the listener?\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJeongwon Joe\n\n2002-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The history of Western classical music and the development of its notational system show that composers have tried to control more and more aspects of their compositions as precisely as possible. Total serialism represents the culmination of compositional control. Given this progressively increasing compositional control, the emergence of chance music, or aleatoric music, in the mid-twentieth century is a significantly interesting phenomenon. In aleatoric music, the composer deliberately incorporates elements of chance in the process of composition and/or in performance. Consequently, aleatoric works challenge the traditional notion of an art work as a closed entity fixed by its author. The philosophical root of aleatoric music can be traced to post structuralism, specifically its critique of t"
