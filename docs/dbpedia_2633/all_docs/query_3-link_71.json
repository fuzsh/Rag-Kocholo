Edited by Dr Mastura Monif, Dr Loretta Piccenna, Ms Sarah Griffith, Ms Tiffany Rushen, Ms Amanda Wells (consumer representative) and Ms Sasha Ermichina (consumer representative).\n\nA message from IAES Blog Staff:\n\nIt is our honor and pleasure to present to all of you an overview of typical psychiatric manifestations of autoimmune encephalitis This overview is by the esteemed team at Monash University in Australia & lead by Dr. Mastura Monif, who is a member of IAES’ Medical Advisory Board.\n\nWe are proud to be in collaboration with Dr. Monif and her team in the Australian Autoimmune Encephalitis Consortium Project as we work closely with them to best support AE patients, caregivers, and their families.\n\nYou can find out more about the Australian Autoimmune Encephalitis Consortium and its efforts to help those with AE and their families via the following link:\n\nhttps://www.monash.edu/medicine/autoimmune-encephalitis\n\n—-\n\nPsychiatric Manifestations of Autoimmune Encephalitis\n\nWHY WE DID THIS WORK\n\nAutoimmune encephalitis is a disorder in which antibodies accidentally created by the immune system attack parts of the brain. This can lead to inflammation and nerve damage.\n\nPsychiatric problems are common in autoimmune encephalitis and can imitate mental health conditions, for example psychotic illnesses like schizophrenia. It is important to separate patients with AE from those with mental illness as treatments are very different.\n\nThere are different subtypes of AE. Some cases are due to the presence of detectable auto antibodies (a protein targeting the person’s own nerve endings) which is known as ‘sero positive’ AE. In ‘sero negative’ AE, there is no detectable antibody when using currently available techniques for detection.\n\nWithin the ‘sero positive’ group are different AE categories depending on the type of antibody. We discuss this further in the next section.\n\nAnti-NMDAR encephalitis\n\nThe most common type of AE and typically occurs in young women. Psychiatric problems are the presenting feature in most patients and many are seen first by a psychiatrist. Symptoms start abruptly and progress rapidly over days to weeks.\n\nCommon features include psychosis (disruption of person’s thoughts and perceptions that can make it difficult for them to understand what is real versus what is not real). They can present with hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not there) and paranoia (false beliefs; for example, believing that people are out there to get you, or having unfounded mistrust of others), agitation, and elevated mood. Occasionally, anti NMDAR encephalitis patients can present with catatonia (complete lack of movement or lack of communication). Almost 90% of patients develop other related neurologic features (including seizures, abnormal movements and speech, and drowsiness) within a month, however some may have only psychiatric problems without neurologic signs.\n\nAnti-LGI1 encephalitis\n\nThe second most common AE and typically affects older males. Seizures are usually the first symptom and often occur before patients develop psychiatric and/or memory problems. These seizures can be very brief, i.e. seconds long, and subtle (face and arm twitching known as “faciobrachial dystonic seizures”), but can be very frequent (up to 100s of times per day).\n\nMemory difficulties develop slowly over months and may be accompanied by disinhibition (actions or words that might seem inappropriate or rude or inconsiderate).\n\nThey can also present with compulsive behaviors (performing an action persistently repetitively), including excessive eating, cleaning and hoarding.\n\nPsychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and paranoia can occur but are less common, and usually are not an early or major feature.\n\nAnti-CASPR encephalitis\n\nInvolves confusion, memory difficulties and ‘slow’ thinking which may be associated with depressed mood. Memory problems can slowly worsen over 12 months or longer in a proportion of patients. These individuals may appear like they have dementia.\n\nPsychotic symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions and paranoia can occur as inflammation of the brain worsens, and usually develop with other neurologic symptoms including seizures, unsteadiness and abnormal jerking and twitching movements.\n\nAnti-AMPAR encephalitis\n\nTypically presents with short-term memory problems, confusion and behavioral changes which get worse over weeks to months.\n\nPsychotic symptoms are variable (20-90% of patients) and may be associated with manic (abnormally elevated or extreme in mood, emotions, energy or activity levels) and aggressive behavior.\n\nSeizures are rare. This type of encephalitis is frequently associated with cancer.\n\nAnti-GABA-A encephalitis\n\nMost commonly presents with seizures.\n\nMemory loss and confusion develop slowly over weeks to months and are associated with personality and behavioral changes in approximately half of patients.\n\nFeatures of psychosis with hallucinations and paranoia are uncommon but can occur later in severe cases.\n\nAnti-GABA-B encephalitis\n\nAlso commonly presents with seizures.\n\nMemory difficulties, confusion and abnormal behavior develop with or after seizures start.\n\nPatients often become depressed and/or anxious at a later stage, usually 1 to 2 years after other symptoms have started.\n\nMemory difficulties are slow to improve and may remain even after treatment.\n\nPsychosis is not a feature.\n\nAnti-DPPX encephalitis\n\nPreceded by diarrhea and weight loss for several months, followed by mild, slowly worsening memory and cognitive difficulties associated with depression and anxiety.\n\nMonths or even years later patients develop psychotic features including hallucinations, delusions and aggression with neurologic symptoms such as seizures, limb shaking and jerking.\n\nAnti-mGluR5 encephalitis\n\nA rare type of AE with three major features – psychosis, memory problems and drowsiness.\n\nPatients experience headaches, fevers, weight loss and nausea followed by rapid onset of memory problems, slowed thinking and severe psychiatric symptoms including hallucinations, depression, anxiety and major mood swings.\n\nMany different neurologic symptoms can occur, including seizures, abnormal movements and difficulty using the eyes and face.\n\nAnti-Neurexin-3a encephalitis\n\nThe disorder develops quickly over several days with headaches, fevers and nausea, followed by confusion and agitation.\n\nPatients then experience severe neurologic symptoms of drowsiness, abnormal movements, seizures and breathing problems.\n\nDiagnosis and treatment\n\nFeatures (“red flags”) that may indicate AE as a cause of psychiatric presentation are shown in table 1.\n\nDiagnosis of AE is challenging, and is confirmed by identifying the antibody in the blood or fluid from around the brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid), however these tests are not always available and may take a long time to return. Other test results that indicate AE may be the cause of psychiatric symptoms include high white cells or inflammation in cerebrospinal fluid, abnormal brain imaging on MRI and abnormal brain electrical activity on EEG (electroencephalogram; refer to our previous summary on EEG here: https://autoimmune-encephalitis.org/using-eeg-nmda\n\nEarly treatment of AE can lead to partial or full recovery.\n\nTable 1.\n\nWhat do the findings mean?\n\nEach subtype of AE presents with different psychiatric features. Our research can help clinicians identify patients with psychiatric symptoms due to AE rather than a mental illness.\n\nEarly consideration of AE as a differential for psychiatric presentations is important as patients respond well to appropriate treatment (immunotherapy), particularly if given early.\n\nFurther studies are needed to continue describing the syndromes associated with each subtype. Fast and accurate testing for the diagnosis of AE is an important area for future research.\n\n—-\n\nFor more information and resources from Dr. Monif and her group at the Australian Autoimmune Encephalitis Consortium Project, visit this link here.

And to make it even more confusing, doctors often don’t just give patients a diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis, but rather anti-NMDAR or anti-Hu or anti-GABAA encephalitis. There are many different types and subtypes of autoimmune encephalitis that can have distinct symptoms, underlying causes, and responses to treatment.1However, the terminology that doctors use to refer to these different subtypes is complex and can sometimes feel like wading into a bowl of alphabet soup! Here, we will try to break down some of the ways that doctors distinguish types of autoimmune encephalitis to help patients and their families make sense of this complicated and rapidly evolving field.\n\nWhat is autoimmune encephalitis?\n\nBefore we break down the different types of autoimmune encephalitis, it is important to understand what autoimmune encephalitis is. What do doctors mean when they use the term autoimmune encephalitis? The suffix -itis can be applied to any part of the body to describe an inflammatory state. So, when -itis is added to the end of the word encephalon (which is the ancient Greek word for inside the head), it means inflammation of the brain. Therefore, encephalitis is a word that describes any sort of inflammation in the brain.\n\nBut what exactly is inflammation? What does it mean when a part of the body is inflamed? Inflammation occurs when the body’s immune system is activated.2 Typically, the immune system is activated when there are invaders in the body, such as bacteria or viruses. Once the immune system is alerted to the presence of this invader, it tries to eliminate the invader using a variety of different weapons. Some of the weapons that the immune system uses are called antibodies.3Antibodies act as signals for the immune system so that it knows where to direct its attack. One battalion of the immune system’s cell soldiers makes antibodies that specifically stick to the target. Then, the immune system sends another battalion of cell soldiers to eliminate the target that has been flagged by the antibody.\n\nEven though the immune system’s main job is to mount attacks against invaders like bacteria and viruses, things can go wrong in the fog of biological warfare. Sometimes the immune system accidentally mounts an attack against healthy proteins in a person’s body. When the body’s immune system targets itself, it can result in what is called an autoimmune process (from combining auto-, meaning self, and -immune, as in the immune system).\n\nNow we can put all of these terms together! When the body’s immune system accidentally targets healthy proteins in a person’s brain, resulting in inflammation in the brain, it is called autoimmune encephalitis.4\n\nIt is important to note that when the body mounts an autoimmune attack against the brain, it isn’t trying to target everyhealthy protein in the brain. Rather, it’s generally trying to target specific proteins that are found in the brain. When the immune system attacks these proteins, it can damage the proteins and the cells in which they are found. As a result, the type of autoimmune encephalitis and the symptoms associated with that autoimmune encephalitis are based on the type of protein that is targeted for attack by the immune system.5\n\nWhat part of the brain is affected by autoimmune encephalitis?\n\nThough we are still relatively early in our understanding of how the brain works, we do know that different regions of the brain control different brain functions. For example, some areas of the brain are dedicated to controlling movement, whereas others are dedicated to processing sensory stimuli. One way in which these different regions of the brain are distinct is that their brain cells can contain different proteins. This means that when the immune system mounts an attack against a protein in the brain, this attack is targeted to the regions in the brain where that protein is found. Therefore, the distinct types of autoimmune encephalitis target different regions in the brain and may affect different brain functions.1\n\nDoctors will sometimes describe a patient’s encephalitis based on which part of the brain they suspect is being attacked. Some common terms that you may hear a doctor use to describe autoimmune encephalitis include:\n\nLimbic encephalitis: inflammation of the limbic system. The limbic system includes brain regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus that are involved in emotional regulation. People with limbic encephalitis most commonly have changes in their mood and memory, along with seizures starting in the limbic system.6\n\nBrainstem encephalitis: inflammation of the brainstem which is the long stalk at the base of the brain that connects the brain to the spinal cord. The brainstem is the center of many important functions necessary for survival, so people with brainstem encephalitis can have problems ranging from abnormal eye movements to trouble swallowing or breathing.7\n\nEncephalomyelitis: inflammation of the brain plus inflammation of the spinal cord. Sometimes patients with autoimmune encephalitis can also mount an autoimmune attack on their spinal cord. Inflammation in the spinal cord interferes with the sensory and movement signals that are sent between the brain and the rest of the body, which can result in symptoms like weakness, paralysis, numbness, or tingling.8\n\nIs autoimmune encephalitis caused by a tumor?\n\nAnother way that doctors distinguish between the types of autoimmune encephalitis is by using the terms paraneoplastic vs. non-paraneoplastic encephalitis. In paraneoplastic autoimmune encephalitides, the reason that the patient’s immune system is attacking their brain is because they have a tumor somewhere in their body.13 A tumor, which is a growth of abnormal cells, can be one of the most common causes of autoimmune encephalitis. This is because the abnormal cells in a tumor can sometimes do strange things to proteins normally found in the brain. For example, tumor cells can place a protein that is normally supposed to be inside of the cell on the outside of the cell, or they can begin to make a brain protein in a different part of the body where it is not normally supposed to be made. This can confuse the immune system, which causes it to attack a normal brain protein that it would otherwise leave alone.9\n\nIn contrast to these cases of paraneoplastic encephalitis, non-paraneoplastic autoimmune encephalitis occurs when there is an autoimmune encephalitis but doctors can’t find a tumor anywhere in the person’s body.1 In these cases, what is causing the immune system to all of a sudden decide to attack a healthy protein in the brain is less clear. The cause of cases of non-paraneoplastic autoimmune encephalitis is the subject of ongoing and future research by many doctors and scientists.\n\nWhich protein in the brain is the immune system trying to attack?\n\nPerhaps the most specific way in which doctors can distinguish between different types of autoimmune encephalitis is by determining exactly which protein in the brain is being targeted. As discussed above, when the immune system mounts an attack against its target, it makes antibodies to specifically flag this target. These antibodies circulate in the blood and/or the fluid that bathes the brain. Therefore, if doctors can collect these antibodies, they can provide a clue about which protein the immune system is targeting.\n\nAs doctors and scientists have identified more antibodies involved in autoimmune encephalitis, they have started to name these types of autoimmune encephalitis after the antibody that is present. For example, one of the most common forms of autoimmune encephalitis is caused by the body mounting an attack against the NMDA receptor, which is a protein found on the surface of many cells in the brain.10 These antibodies against the NMDA receptor are called “anti-NMDA receptor antibodies” so these patients are said to have “anti-NMDA receptor autoimmune encephalitis.” Some of the most common types of autoimmune encephalitis that are named based on the antibody found against their protein target are listed in the table below.\n\nTable Caption: Different antibodies that are found in patients with autoimmune encephalitis are associated with distinct symptoms and the likelihood that the disease is a result of having a tumor somehwere in the body. Adapted from Davis & Dalmau – Autoimmunity, seizures & status epilepticus (2013).11\n\nIn some patients doctors are unable to find an antibody that is known to be associated with autoimmune encephalitis, even if the doctor is pretty sure that the patient’s symptoms are caused by an autoimmune encephalitis. This might be because either the patient’s immune system is not making an antibody, or that doctors don’t yet have a laboratory test that is capable of identifying an antibody associated with that patient’s disease. These cases of autoimmune encephalitis are said to be seronegative.12 Doctors and scientists are still looking to identify new proteins and antibodies that are associated with autoimmune encephalitis in hopes of providing a more specific diagnosis for patients who would have previously been thought to have seronegative autoimmune encephalitis.\n\nIt is important to remember that autoimmune encephalitis can look different in every patient. For example, one patient may be diagnosed with anti-NMDA encephalitis after she has multiple seizures and is found to have an ovarian tumor. Whereas another patient may be diagnosed with anti-NMDA encephalitis after he has dramatic changes in his personality and memory, but doctors are not able to find a tumor. Nevertheless, breaking down a disease into distinct boxes can help guide doctors in their diagnostic and treatment decisions for an individual patient. And a greater understanding of the subtypes and causes of autoimmune encephalitis may be crucial for developing more targeted and effective treatments for this uniquely challenging disease.\n\nReferences:\n\nDalmau, J. & Rosenfeld, M.

Illustration by Jeannie Phan. Republished with permission from Brain & Life Magazine\n\nA message from IAES Blog staff:\n\nThe holidays are a busy time for everyone. For those of us with neurological issues and for those that care for us, this busyness may seem overwhelming at times. In 2021 Brain & Life magazine published an article that may make one part of the holiday season a small bit easier and much more fun. They published an article that provides a fun and useful list of gifts for those with neurological issues. It is our sincere hope you find this as helpful as we have!\n\n——-\n\nThoughtful Holiday Gifts for People with Neurologic Conditions\n\nOur guide makes gift-giving a cinch—and fun.\n\nIf you ask John Andrejack, a 53-year-old college professor from New York City, what he wants for the holidays, a massage is at the top of his list. It’s the kind of gift that’s personal, he says, but also practical: It helps with the muscle aches that are a symptom of his Parkinson’s disease.\n\nDiagnosed at the age of 47, Andrejack has had several holiday seasons when friends and family wanted to give him something both meaningful to his personality and appropriate for his condition, but it’s not easy. This is mainly, Andrejack says, because Parkinson’s disease and other neurologic conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, tremor, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS) vary so much from person to person.\n\n“What might be really useful for someone might not necessarily be wanted by someone else,” says Erin Cecchi, MSW, LCSW, senior program coordinator and clinical social worker at Northwestern University’s Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders Center in Chicago.\n\nBut the possibilities are expanding. As the number of Americans living with a neurologic disease increases (that number is now 25 million, according to a report in Annals of Neurology), companies are responding with suitable products and services.\n\nHere are some gift ideas from people who know: neurologists on the editorial board of Brain & Life, physical and occupational therapists, and patients like Andrejack.\n\nGifts for the Home\n\nSatin sheets.\n\nSoft, slippery sheets make it easier to move around in and get out of bed. (amazon.com, bedbathandbeyond.com, sheex.com, target.com, thecompanystore.com, walmart.com)\n\nWeighted blankets.\n\nThese can deflect anxiety and stress. “The heavy feeling of a weighted blanket can be calming and help a person feel safe and comfortable,” says Cecchi. (amazon.com, gravityblankets.com, sensacalm.com, sleepnumber.com, walmart.com, yaasa.com)\n\nHeated blankets or vests.\n\n“Many patients with neurologic conditions have trouble regulating their temperature,” says JoEllyn Fox, DPT, lead therapist at the Dan Aaron Parkinson’s Rehabilitation Center at the Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia. This is especially true for people with MS, ALS, and Parkinson’s disease. Blankets and vests help stabilize body temperature. (amazon.com, ororowear.com, walmart.com)\n\nSupport wedges.\n\n“Typically, people with Parkinson’s disease have a stooped or forward-flex posture that puts strain on their muscles,” says Chelsea Richardson, PT, DPT, a board-certified neurologic clinical specialist and clinical director at Re+active PT in Los Angeles. Support wedges, roller pillows, and foam leg supports can relieve the aches and pains. “I definitely recommend them for my patients with lower back pain.” (amazon.com, helixsleep.com)\n\nBlue light glasses.\n\n“Light sensitivity is common after a concussion or stroke,” says Richardson. This is true for many types of light and frequencies, including sunlight and computer screens. By blocking out blue light, the specialized glasses can alleviate sensitivity and headaches. (eyebuydirect.com, felixgray.com, warbyparker.com)\n\nRocking knives.\n\n“Specialized equipment for the kitchen is always a welcome gift for people with neurologic conditions who love to cook and bake,” says Fox. The rocking knife is designed to cut food with a back-and-forth motion and is perfect for those who can’t use a knife and fork because of tremor or muscle fatigue. A pizza cutter is another option. (amazon.com)\n\nImmersion blenders.\n\nThey’re lighter than traditional blenders and require only one hand to operate, so they’re good for those with impaired dexterity. (kohls.com, target.com, walmart.com)\n\nWeighted utensils and adaptive gadgets.\n\nMany kitchen utensils are available in heavier-than-normal models for people with dexterity problems. They can help offset tremors associated with Parkinson’s, Richardson says. Adaptive versions of gadgets like electric can openers, vegetable choppers, and apple slicers get the job done with just one hand, which could be useful for a person with a fine motor deficit. (amazon.com, rehabmart.com, rehab-store.com, specialsupplies.com, thewrightstuff.com)\n\nAdaptive dishes.\n\nBowls and plates with feet that grip the surface and shapes that make it easier to scoop food are helpful for stroke survivors and others who may have weakness on one side. (amazon.com, ncmedical.com)\n\nSilicone place mats and stabilized cutting boards.\n\nPlace mats prevent plates from slipping, and stable cutting boards make chopping vegetables safer and easier. (amazon.com)\n\nThe Staybowlizer.\n\nA brightly colored ring-shaped accessory made of silicone, the Staybowlizer holds bowls firmly in place so there’s less tipping or spillage while preparing meals. “From an occupational therapy standpoint, these compensate for extra movement like tremor,” Fox says. (amazon.com, staybowlizer.com)\n\nGifts For Daily Living\n\nElectric Toothbrushes Or Shavers.\n\nSince these devices do most of the work, they can be helpful for people with tremor or impaired dexterity. An electric shaver can prevent cuts. (amazon.com)\n\nSquatty Potty.\n\nConstipation is often one of the earliest nonmotor symptoms for people with Parkinson’s disease, says Richardson. The Squatty Potty footstool positions the body optimally, and it comes in newer styles made of Lucite or bamboo. (squattypotty.com)\n\nRaised toilet seats.\n\n“If you have muscle weakness, it may be difficult to stand up from lower surfaces, such as toilets,” Richardson says. “A raised toilet seat promotes independence by allowing people to get on and off the toilet more easily.” (walgreens.com)\n\nSlip-on shoes and accessories.\n\nBrands like Kizik, Zeba, and Billy Footwear offer shoes that are easy to put on—and stylish. A long shoehorn can help with lace-up shoes, and a sock assist makes putting on socks a lot easier. (billyfootwear.com, kizik.com, zebashoes.com)\n\nCompression socks.\n\nThese snug yet stretchy items can ease neuropathy, reduce temperature sensitivity, and prevent muscle cramping, says Cecchi. (affordablecompressionsocks.com, bombas.com)\n\nAdaptive clothing.\n\nTommy Hilfiger, MagnaReady, and Silverts are some brands that make clothing with Velcro closures instead of buttons. “And it really looks good now,” Fox says. (magnaready.com, silverts.com, usa.tommy.com)\n\nSignature stamps.\n\nSigning important documents can be time-consuming and frustrating for people with impaired fine motor skills. Signature stamps can solve the problem. (simplystamps.com, vistaprint.com)\n\nWriting tablets.\n\nDigital notepads are made just for writing (or drawing), not internet and app use, and they easily erase messages. That makes them ideal for people who have trouble speaking but can still write, says Cecchi, who uses one in her clinic. (mobiscribe.com, myboogieboard.com, target.com, walmart.com)\n\nPicture dictionaries.\n\nMany stroke survivors experience aphasia, which impairs all aspects of language—speaking, listening, reading, and writing—and renders communication almost impossible. Picture dictionaries such as This, Please!: The Tourist Picture Dictionary and Point It: Traveller’s Language Kit are invaluable resources, allowing people to point to what they’re trying to say rather than verbalize it. (amazon.com)\n\nDictation software.\n\nFor those who can speak but have difficulty writing, consider this electronic solution. (livevox.com, dolbeyspeech.com, talkatoo.com)\n\nWriting implements.\n\nWeighted pens make writing easier for those with tremors. Writing grips, lined sticky notes, and wrist braces also improve the ability to write. (rehab-store.com, walmart.com)\n\nVoice-controlled devices.\n\nAn electronic “virtual assistant” that responds to spoken instructions to play music or turn on and off lights may help with communication and voice modulation, Fox says. (amazon.com)\n\nGifts for Getting Around\n\nCanes.\n\nFor people with mild walking impairments, a personalized or attention-grabbing cane might be a fun gift, especially if the recipient associates it with more independence or a higher quality of life, says Fox. “It’s important to connect the cane with an added benefit such as getting out to visit a friend.” Some canes even have a built-in GPS navigation system, which can be very handy, says Andrejack. (walmart.com, amazon.com, myrmsstore.com)\n\nLift chairs and transport chairs and boards.\n\nThese are vital but expensive, so consider offering to share some of the cost. But first check with the recipient to see if these items are covered by insurance through durable medical equipment benefits. If recipients already have these devices, make them more personal and fun with light-up wheels, stickers, or monograms for chairs. (amazon.com, sitnstand.com, walmart.com)\n\nReachers and grabbers.\n\nThese devices help access items in hard-to-reach areas, especially for people in wheelchairs or at risk for falling. (amazon.com, carewell.com, myrmsstore.com, walmart.com)\n\nCar-assist handles.\n\nThese small, portable levers wedge into the latches of car door frames, making it easier to get in and out of vehicles. (amazon.com, mdmaxx.com, medicalsupplydepot.com)\n\nCar handlebars and car caddies.\n\nThese are additional devices that help people get into and out of cars with less effort. (amazon.com, braunability.com, homedepot.com, mdmaxx.com, medmart.com, mobilityworks.com)\n\nSeat lifts.\n\nCombine the gift of a meal at the recipient’s favorite restaurant with a seat lift for the person’s car, says Fox. “Recipients may enjoy the prospect of a dinner more, knowing they can transfer from car to restaurant easily,” she says. (braunability.com, lifewaymobility.com, sitnstand.com)\n\nGifts for Fitness\n\nPersonal trainers.\n\nIf going to the gym is not feasible, book a session with a personal trainer who has experience working with clients who have the same condition as the person to whom you’re giving this gift. Reach out to the recipient’s doctor or physical therapist, if possible, for trainer recommendations.\n\nGym memberships.\n\nExercise is crucial for people with neurologic disorders, says Richardson, since it increases dopamine, a neurochemical that affects movement, mood, and coordination. (A loss of dopamine can make exercise difficult due to apathy, muscle weakness, fatigue, or poor coordination.) A gym membership can be motivating, especially when the gift giver commits to going too!\n\nTrekking poles.\n\n“Walking sticks improve stability and posture,” says Richardson. They also can increase arm swing and stride length in people with Parkinson’s disease. (kuiu.com, llbean.com, rei.com)\n\nFitness trackers.\n\nBeing stuck at home during the pandemic worsened symptoms for many of Fox’s patients. A fitness tracker can motivate people to move, indoors and out. Fox suggests including a homemade coupon with the tracker that can be redeemed for setting up the tracker. (apple.com, bestbuy.com, koretrakpro.io, target.com, walmart.com)\n\nWeights.\n\nA set of dumbbells or a floor or hand cycle allows people to exercise at home, which is important for immunocompromised and other vulnerable patients who still may be avoiding the gym, says Fox. Just be sure the recipient doesn’t have a condition that precludes using the equipment, she says. (amazon.com, dickssportinggoods.com, walmart.com)\n\nGifts Outside the Box\n\nElectronic or audiobooks.\n\nE-books are lighter and more portable than traditional books, and audiobooks are ideal for people with vision problems. (audible.com, ebooks.com)\n\nDigital music services.\n\n“Music is so important, for everything from movement to mood,” says Fox. Creating personalized playlists or giving a gift subscription to a monthly music streaming service like Spotify encourages exercise, boosts mood, and triggers memories. (amazon.com, apple.com, idagio.com, pandora.com, spotify.com)\n\nPhotographs.\n\n“Framed pictures are thoughtful, but for people whose fine motor skills have declined, they can be breaking hazards,” says Cecchi. “Photo albums work much better, or even individual prints of special photos that evoke fond memories.” Creative gift givers could design a digital or printed scrapbook. (mixbook.com, shutterfly.com, snapfish.com)\n\nHomemade coupons.\n\nCreate fun coupons with promises to clean out closets, take out the trash, mow the lawn, or cook a meal.\n\nDays of beauty.\n\nA certificate for a haircut and style may be a welcome gift, especially if you help make the appointment and drive the person to the salon.\n\nMeals.\n\nBring over takeout or homemade food for two to save your gift recipient the stress of cooking, and to provide company. Cecchi says, “This can be as simple as just bringing someone a milkshake,” which is both delicious and easy to swallow.\n\nMindfulness aids.\n\nMeditation and mindfulness can ease anxiety and depression, says Fox. To get friends and loved ones started, consider app subscriptions, adult coloring books, or mindfulness workbooks.\n\nBiofeedback tools.\n\nFor Richardson’s patients who have autonomic dysfunction—the body can’t regulate body functions like blood pressure, heart rate, and digestion—she uses a wearable biofeedback device called Lief that makes patients aware of erratic nervous system responses and teaches them corrective breathing exercises. It requires a monthly subscription, and users can return it when they’re done. (getlief.com)\n\nThink Twice\n\nYou don’t want to give a gift that’s impractical or inappropriate, no matter who the recipient is. If it’s a person with a neurologic condition, certain gifts may be awkward, best shared privately, or better to be coordinated with the recipient’s physician.\n\nFood treats.\n\nA fruit basket or a box of candy is lovely—unless the recipient has problems with swallowing, as can happen with Parkinson’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\nMedication organizers.\n\nItems like dispensers, organizers, or pill caddies might feel impersonal or too condition-focused, says John Andrejack, a professor in New York City who has Parkinson’s disease.\n\nOutings.\n\nWithout fully understanding the recipient’s abilities and limitations, you might choose an event or excursion that could be stressful. Talk with the person and make plans together if a trip or a concert seems like a good gift idea, says JoEllyn Fox, DPT, lead therapist at the Dan Aaron Parkinson’s Rehabilitation Center in Philadelphia.\n\nPortable urinals.\n\n“These can be so useful for people with Parkinson’s, but I wouldn’t want to get one for Christmas,” says Andrejack. That would make me extremely uncomfortable.”\n\nWalkers or rollators.\n\n“These gifts can be a bit like giving your mom a vacuum for Christmas,” says Fox. They can be practical, but not personal or exciting. And even though retailers like Amazon and Walmart stock them, many of these devices are better purchased through a doctor’s or physical therapist’s office, where they can be fitted properly.\n\nClick here or the image below to subscribe to our mailing list:\n\nYour generous Donations allow IAES to continue our important work and save lives!\n\nBecome an Advocate by sharing your story.

The talented PNK team continues to keep us up-to-date and help clarify the complexities we face each day along our AE journey, and we are eternally grateful! You can find out much more about this stellar group at: https://pennneuroknow.com/\n\n——\n\nThe holy grail! The million-dollar question! How long will it take to get rid of AE, to heal from AE…when will we feel and act ‘normal’ again? Why do we not understand more of the healing process’ from a diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis?\n\nKara McGaughey and the team at PennNeuroKnow help us further understand just how complex and individual our brains are!\n\n——\n\nIntroduction\n\nIf you break a bone, your expectations about the healing process and how long it might last will vary depending on the nature and severity of the fracture. For example, a small fracture will come with a completely different timeline for recovery than a compound fracture (where the force of the break causes the bone to pierce through the skin).\n\nJust like broken bones, no two cases of brain injury are exactly the same and the timeline of the healing process depends on the nature and severity of the injury. As such, when we consider healing from brain injuries, like autoimmune encephalitis (AE), the diversity of diagnoses and symptoms leads to a diversity of recovery trajectories, which can make navigating the healing process a confusing and isolating experience. Here, we dive into this diversity, exploring what healing from AE looks like, why the process takes so long, and why it varies so much.\n\nHow does the brain heal from autoimmune encephalitis?\n\n“I felt like a robot controlling my body for the first time – speech, thought and movement all under shaky manual control. I felt like my brain was being reacquainted with my body.”\n\n— Alexandrine Lawrie on AE recovery1\n\nAutoimmune encephalitis (AE) is a collection of related conditions in which the body’s immune system produces antibodies that mistakenly attack the brain, causing inflammation. In order to begin the healing process, treatment is needed to shut down the overactive immune system, remove the antibodies mounting the attack, and reduce brain swelling.2-3 To accomplish this, doctors typically rely on a handful of treatments options:\n\nCorticosteroids to reduce brain inflammation/swelling and immune system activity.\n\nBlood plasma exchange to remove and replace the harmful antibodies circulating in the blood (which can find their way into the brain).\n\nIntravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which includes helpful antibodies isolated from the blood plasma of thousands of healthy donors.\n\nImmunosuppressant medications (like Cyclophosphamide and Rituximab) to directly suppress the immune system, if necessary.2-4\n\nSteroids, blood plasma exchange, intravenous immunoglobulin, or a combination of the three represent the most common defense against AE.2,4 These first-line treatments can be helpful for stopping the immune system’s attack on brain tissue and reducing inflammation. Corticosteroids, for example, reduce brain swelling by preventing the production of inflammatory proteins by immune cells. These steroids also help to restore the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, a protective lining that shields the brain from inflammatory cells and harmful antibodies that may be circulating in the bloodstream.5 In AE the blood-brain barrier can spring leaks, which allows antibodies from the bloodstream to penetrate the brain and wreak havoc.6 Closing up any leaks in the barrier that formed as a result of AE disease progression is a critical first step in the healing process.\n\nHowever, recovery from AE can take time and is often not an abrupt rise and fall of symptoms (Figure 1, left). Instead, while many people do respond to available treatment options, the initial period of healing usually falls short of complete, giving way to a longer and more complicated recovery trajectory (Figure 1, center). For example, first-line therapies fail to resolve symptoms in about 50% of patients with AE, which means that additional and prolonged treatments are often required to suppress the immune system and give the brain an opportunity to repair and recover.4 In these cases, doctors turn to second-line therapies, like immunosuppressants. While having steroids on board promotes brain healing by stopping the leakage of antibodies from the bloodstream into the brain, immunosuppressants, like Rituximab, go after the cells that make the antibodies in the first place.5 When given long-term, Rituximab can be effective at reducing symptoms and keeping AE in remission.2,4\n\nWhile therapies, like Rituximab, can be incredibly effective, outcomes are still highly variable. Because no two cases of AE are exactly the same, no two recovery trajectories are either (Figure 1, right). Both treatment options and outcomes often depend on details of the AE diagnosis, such as the type of antibody involved. For example, a recent study of 358 patients with AE demonstrated that people with anti-NMDAR antibodies, LGI1 antibodies, and CASPR2 antibodies respond differently to Rituximab immunotherapy.7 These groups of patients with AE caused by different antibodies not only reported differences in symptom relief, but they ultimately reached different levels of day-to-day independence. Nevertheless, regardless of treatment approach and AE diagnosis, early and aggressive therapy is consistently associated with better outcomes. This means that as diagnostic tools and treatments improve, more people with AE have the opportunity to heal.2\n\nHow long does the process of healing from autoimmune encephalitis take?\n\n“Good, bad, up, down, round and round;\n\nI feel as though I’m on a merry-go-round.\n\nFull of uncertainty if it will ever stop spinning;\n\nFull of frustration as I remain on my couch sitting.\n\nIt’s going to be alright; it’s going to be okay; I will continue the fight day to day.\n\nI will keep the hope and learn to cope;\n\nI will continue my way up this slippery slope with hopes of support and love of some sort.”\n\n— Anonymous on living with AE8\n\nSince people tend to differ in their response to AE treatments, they tend to recover at different paces. For some, AE symptoms decline steadily with continued immunotherapy, leading to recovery within a couple months. Others experience persistent relapses, leading to a recovery timeline on the order of years (Figure 1, right). Research studies show that most patients continue to improve 18 months to 2 years after starting treatment, but there are some people with AE who experience ongoing and life-changing symptoms.9\n\nSimilar to how some types of AE respond better or worse to particular treatments, AE diagnosis also affects the timeline of recovery and the risk of recurrence. A recent study followed up with AE patients 3, 6, and 12 months after starting treatment, assessing and comparing their symptoms using a measure of the degree of disability or dependence. Researchers and clinicians found that after three months, two thirds of patients with anti-LGI1 or CASPR2 antibodies recovered to “slight disability” compared to only 30% of patients with anti-NMDAR or other antibody-based AE.10\n\nThis persistence of symptoms among patients with anti-NMDAR vs. anti-LGI1 or CASPR2 AE may come from the fact that different AE antibodies carry different risks for relapse. For example, the risk of relapse within two years for anti-NMDAR AE is 12%.9 There are other AE diagnoses, like anti-AMPAR AE, where the relapse rate is even higher, pushing 50-60%.11 This increased risk of relapse is thought to stem from the fact that patients with anti-AMPAR AE often have psychiatric and memory dysfunction that make them less likely to keep up with medications. However, while it may be more prevalent for some types of AE than others, relapse is not a given. These same studies show that patients who receive (and continue) with first-line treatments have a lower risk of recurrence relative to untreated patients.11 Risk of relapse is further decreased in patients who have been given both first- and second-line therapies.5,9 This clear payoff of continued treatment suggests that as we continue to make improvements to AE therapies, there is potential for the percentage of patients reaching recovery to continue to increase.\n\nAll in all, vast differences in AE diagnoses and symptoms lead to lots of variability in treatment options, the healing process, and recovery timelines. This diversity of AE trajectories makes setting expectations for the healing process especially difficult. It also highlights the resilience of AE patients, their families, and their support systems who tirelessly endure and advocate despite prolonged uncertainty.\n\n“A dear lady friend of mine (with the same illness) said this great quote that I reflect on frequently:\n\n‘Not every day is good, but there is good in every day.’\n\nAnd that has been absolutely true.\n\nEach day presents itself with its own challenges and even though I don’t know what the future holds,\n\nI am most calm when I focus on the good one day at a time.\n\n–Amy on her AE journey12\n\nWork Cited:\n\nLawrie, A.

Sanchez, PennNeuroKnow\n\nIntroduction\n\nImagine you just pulled out a load of laundry from the dryer, and as you begin to get into the groove of folding clothes, out of nowhere, you have a profound loss of energy (1). What you are experiencing is called fatigue. Fatigue is different from drowsiness or sleepiness. For example, drowsiness is the need for sleep whereas sleepiness is the likelihood of being able to fall asleep (1, 3). To clarify, fatigue is the overwhelming feeling of tiredness, weakness, and a complete lack of energy (3).\n\nFatigue impacts millions of Americans every day. In fact, about 5 to 10% of visits to primary care doctors in the United States are due to patients reporting fatigue (3). Despite its pervasiveness, fatigue can be experienced differently across individuals. For example, males describe fatigue as feeling tired while females more often describe their fatigue as feeling anxious or depressed (2).\n\nFatigue is a common symptom of autoimmune encephalitis\n\nPatients with autoimmune encephalitis (AE) describe fatigue as one of their main persistent symptoms, even after recovery (5). It can become so disabling that patients may drop out of school or work, thus negatively impacting their quality of life (6). Dr. Anusha K Yeshokumar, an autoimmune neurologist, conducted two studies to determine the outcomes of survivors of AE in order to find ways to improve patients’ quality of life (5). In both studies, she found that over 60% of patients reported experiencing fatigue (5). Of these patients, she also found that over 80% of them reported feeling both physical (feeling weak, the need to rest, etc.) and cognitive fatigue (less alert, cannot think clearly, etc.) (5).\n\nA notable finding in Dr. Yeshokumar’s study was that anti-NMDAR AE seems to act differently when it comes to fatigue, such that adults experience it much less than children (5). Another factor that influenced whether patients with AE experienced fatigue was the time of diagnosis and treatment. Anti-NMDAR AE is one of the most well-characterized AEs, so doctors tend to diagnose and treat patients faster than other types of AE. Other types of AE aren’t as well-characterized, which can interfere with a doctor’s ability to properly diagnose and treat patients quickly. Because of this interference, patients who do not get diagnosed as quickly are more likely to experience fatigue. For example, patients with other AEs reported the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and to treatment took almost 300 days while it only took 30 days for patients with anti-NMDAR AE! (5). As doctors and researchers learn more about other AEs, it can hopefully aid in earlier diagnosis and treatment to prevent chronic (≥6 months) fatigue.\n\nIs your brain making you feel fatigued?\n\nFatigue is often associated with the sickness behavioral response, which occurs when the body tries to cope or fight off an infection (14). Scientists believe that the brain is responsible for this sickness behavioral response (7). In a recent study, scientists explored whether there are certain types of neurons that become activated when an infection occurs and may be responsible for sickness behaviors (7,8). To do so, scientists injected healthy mice with a molecule to induce a bacterial infection and make them sick (7,8). Afterwards, scientists performed a special technique called single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on the brains of mice who did or did not receive the bacterial injection (7,8). scRNA-seq is a widely used tool used to study the identity of different types of cells (To learn more and read about scRNA-seq, check out this Penn Neuro Know article!). By using this sequencing technique, scientists discovered two specific populations of neurons that reside in the brainstem, the part of our brain connected to the spinal cord (7,8). Scientists found that these populations in the brainstem are responsible for several sickness symptoms, like appetite, movement, and body temperature (7,8). Changes in mouse behavior like a reduction in physical activity and/or weight loss are how scientists can make inferences that mice are experiencing fatigue (17). This is because fatigue is often associated with a decline in physical and daily activities.\n\nIn another complementary study, a team of scientists found another specialized population of neurons in a brain region called the hypothalamus that are responsible for sickness behaviors like fever and nausea (7,9). These key findings are now pointing scientists in the right direction toward fully understanding these neuronal populations in order to mitigate or prevent sickness behaviors, including fatigue.\n\nAre there other explanations for fatigue?\n\nAnother reason why patients experience fatigue is because they may have chronic or relapsing neuroinflammation (5). Neuroinflammation occurs when the body’s immune system is triggered following an infection, or in the case of AE, to attack healthy cells in the brain. The brain has a protective sheath called the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which prevents most infections and foreign invaders from getting to the brain. In the case that infection or inflammation does occur, the body’s immune cells will release a special signal that can pass through the BBB to let neurons and microglia know danger is near. These signals alert a special population of immune cells in the brain, called microglia, that they should begin to defend against infection. Once microglia are alerted, they will activate neighboring neurons. When neurons receive this signal, they become strongly active and communicate with nearby neurons and brain regions (14). Scientists have proposed that this increased neuronal activity is what also contributes to fatigue (14). In the case of AE or chronic neuroinflammation, scientists postulate that because microglia and other immune cells are constantly activated and releasing that special signal, neurons also remain persistently active, and so do feelings of fatigue (14).\n\nTreatments for chronic fatigue\n\nDoctors can prescribe some medications or over-the-counter drugs that can ease symptoms of chronic fatigue (13). Some doctors might suggest lifestyle changes to help manage and alleviate fatigue, such as practicing good sleep hygiene (i.e., getting a full 8 hours of sleep and keeping a sleep diary) and lifestyle changes (i.e., eating, drinking, exercising, etc.) (15, 16). Despite working for some patients, sometimes medications and lifestyle changes are not enough to alleviate chronic fatigue. In those cases, holistic interventions, like yoga or mindfulness, can also sometimes improve overall quality of life. For example, patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) – another type of autoimmune disease – who practiced yoga for 2 or 4 months reported lower levels of fatigue (11). Other studies have found that MS patients who practiced trait mindfulness (the ability to practice living in the present moment) also reported being able to maintain a higher health-related quality of life (10, 12).\n\nResearch studies such as the one by Dr. Yeshokumar are huge steps towards understanding how fatigue impacts survivors of AE and being able to better treat patients. Both scientists and doctors are getting closer to understanding the exact biological mechanisms of fatigue in AE, which will hopefully aid in the development of treatments that target these mechanisms to improve patients’ quality of life.\n\nReferences:\n\n1-Medline.

Each AE Warrior is here today because of those that care for and love us. We are thankful beyond words. We hope you find this story as inspirational as we have, and we truly hope you all have a wonderful Thanksgiving!\n\nTo read more of Zoe’s story and her family please enjoy the first blog in this AE journey: https://autoimmune-encephalitis.org/never-give-up-miracles-happen-every-day/\n\n—–\n\nMy name Janine Samuela-Carasus. I am 29 years old and from the Philippines.\n\nFive years ago, in the middle of August 2017, our toddler that was almost two years old was diagnosed with anti-NMDA receptor Encephalitis.\n\nWe were stuck in a pediatric ICU unit for three weeks with Zoe and then, literally, lived in the hospital for the longest two months of our lives. As you can imagine, hundreds of tests and procedures were done every single day to try and figure out what was happening to our precious little girl. Our hearts were broken by every single negative result. No one knew what was happening to our girl. She seemed to be getting sicker and sicker each day.\n\nBills began piling up. All we understood was that her condition continued to worsen each day until she was not responding anymore. But with all this negativity, there was never a moment, a day, or a week that I thought of giving in and giving up. Never did a second go by that we lost hope that things would get better. With constant prayer, the help of the Lord, and the vigilance of our brilliant doctors, we kept hope alive.\n\nEventually, we were able to bring Zoe home although she was in a non-responsive vegetative state. We had no idea or any medical assurance that she would recover and regain her strength again and be the precious girl we knew and loved.\n\nFor me, it was a mix of emotions. I was happy we were finally home and terrified of what the future would bring all at the same time. I worried if I would be strong enough for Zoe and if I would be able to help her. I did know one thing for certain, even if it took her forever to recover, I would be there. I knew even if it meant sacrificing my own life and personal dreams, I would be there. And I did. Never did I leave her side, nor did I sleep away from her even for a night. I, religiously, made her blended food and fed her via a feeding tube for months. I took her to doctor’s appointments, therapy sessions, and every appointment that was necessary. I made sure Zoe was and felt loved every minute of every day and spoke to her all the time as if nothing was wrong.\n\nAll our prayers were answered. Zoe’s recovery was a long slow two-year road that we all traveled together. We watched her slowly improve, we cried with her when the therapy was hard until she got to the point to be able to face the world again!\n\nTo date, our daughter is back to being her best self. Her gross motor and cognitive skills are significantly improved. She has been able to overcome her stranger anxiety and started attending formal school. We are very excited for her to spread her wings and begin to fly. She will be bringing with her the scars of a well-fought past showing how strong and resilient she is. Our family will be right by her side!\n\nOur fight and Zoe’s fight do not end here. AE could happen anytime in her life again. It can happen to anyone. I will always be proud of our story of faith, strength, and love. We plan to always fight for AE awareness so everyone can get diagnosed quicker and not have to go thru all the pain we had as a result of this terrible disease.\n\nZoe turns seven years old this month. I want Zoe to read and understand our story, her story. Zoe may not be able to remember all aspects of her AE journey but thru this story, I hope she understands, in her heart, that we, as a family, are one. And we will conquer everything that comes our way!! ❤\n\nClick here or the image below to subscribe to our mailing list :\n\nYour generous Donations allow IAES to continue our important work and save lives!\n\nOn June 16 th, 2022, Tabitha Orth, President and Founder of International Autoimmune Encephalitis Society officially became the 7,315 th “point of light”.

And we have much to be thankful for. For those within the AE community, we cannot thank all those that care for us, in any capacity, enough! As we round out Caregiver Awareness month and head into a holiday season of joy, peace, and grace, may we all continue to be aware and be thankful for all we have been given.\n\nMichelle Seitzer founder of Caregiving Advice has graciously offered to let us share her article regarding ways to help those that care for us the most. We hope you find this as informative as we have!\n\nShe offers wonderful tips, and many ways caregivers can be cared for!!!\n\n——-\n\nWant to help a caregiver whose life is busy, busy, busy? Here’s how!\n\nDuring this week’s Coffee Chat—our brand new virtual support group that takes place Mondays at 11ET on Instagram Live—we talked about what kind of help is actually helpful for caregivers, and why it’s so hard to get it.\n\nWe first posted this article in February 2020, right before the world shut down. How times have changed since then! But the advice we shared here? It hasn’t changed at all. Caregivers still need help. Caregivers still want help. But caregivers get a little triggered by kind offers from well-meaning people—and here’s the main reason why.\n\nBecause it feels like more work.\n\nWhen caregivers hear these age-old phrases—“How can I help?” or “Let me know if I can do anything!”—our initial internal reaction is STRESS. Because the thought of coming up with helpful tasks feels like extra work, and extra work is something no caregiver wants. We want someone to lighten our load, not add to it!\n\nNow don’t misunderstand: We are generally thankful for the offers. We appreciate that you see our need for help and want to provide it. But we need you to make it a little easier for us. And sometimes, we just need a little more time to think about it! As caregivers, we need to say that. “Thanks for your offer, can I get back to you with some ideas? And can you check in with me in a week if I forget?”\n\nSo caregivers, next time someone asks you *THE QUESTION,* refer to these 5 simple suggestions. And if you’re reading this as a person who wants to help a caregiver, thank you for your willingness; we hope you find these ideas helpful!\n\n#1: Bring us a meal.\n\nAn oldie but a goodie: make us a meal! Or make a couple of meals for me to stack in my freezer, or send gift cards for GrubHub, UberEATS, or our favorite local pizzeria. Planning meals is often the last thing we want to squeeze into our busy day, which leads to lots of unhealthy dinners like frozen pizzas—or even worse, skipping meals altogether.\n\n#2: Come visit us.\n\nOffer to sit with our caree for a few hours while I run errands. Don’t feel comfortable with that? Just stop by for a visit when I’m there (if we’re all up for visitors that day)! Caregiving can be extremely lonely, so it’s a huge help to see friendly faces and welcome visitors! It’s equally as refreshing to have someone take over so I can get a few items checked off my to-do list.\n\n#3: Fill our (gas) tanks.\n\nIf you really want to do something of monetary value for us, a gas gift card is always appreciated! There’s a lot of driving involved in caregiving, and it adds up. And financial pressures add to our already heavy caregiving load.\n\n#4: Bring us groceries (treats included).\n\nWith online shopping now available in almost all areas—and with a variety of pick-up, drive-up or delivery options—this is an easy way to help that makes a HUGE difference!\n\nThink of how much work it is to grocery shop…\n\nIt starts with planning: thinking about meals and snacks, then assessing what you need, taking note of what you’ve run out of, and jotting it down.\n\nThen you have to figure out when to go, and depending on your caregiving situation, this can be a logistical challenge. Who can stay with your caree, if they need supervision? Or do you bring the person along, which comes with its own challenges? Some caregivers opt to shop at night when a spouse, partner, or child can stay home with the person you care for—but that often means shopping on tired legs and with a weary mind.\n\nNow that you’ve figured out when to go, you have to drive there, go inside, fill your cart, empty your cart on the belt, load the bags in your cart, bring them out to your car, load them in your car, drive home, bring the bags into the house, then put the groceries away.\n\nAnd then, of course, make a list of the things you forgot, because that inevitably happens, right?!\n\nWhen you break down all the steps, you realize how much work is involved—and why it would be SUCH a help for someone to step in on this necessary life activity. (It also makes the case for paying the nominal delivery fee for those services, if you ask me!)\n\n#5: Update others for us.\n\nOffer to update others when something big happens. This one is a little tricky in terms of privacy, but it can still be super helpful.\n\nThe key word here is “offer.” Never give updates on my caregiving life without checking with me first. But if you know something big just happened (new diagnosis, a fall, change of living situation or school depending on age, a death or similar big loss/change in the family, etc.), ask me if I could help with letting others know.\n\nWho are those “others?” Those are the people who would love to hear the latest on my caree but don’t necessarily need to hear it from me directly—i.e. my pastor, neighbors, boss/coworkers, friends I haven’t talked to in a while, to name a few.\n\nIt’s emotionally exhausting to repeat the same information — especially bad news — over and over again, so having someone offer to take on that task provides a huge sense of relief.\n\nAnd there you have it! Five simple ways to help a caregiver whose life is busy, busy, busy. Pass this on to others who are looking for ways they can help, and let us know if you’d add anything to this list by commenting below.\n\nClick here or the image below to subscribe to our mailing list:\n\nYour generous Donations allow IAES to continue our important work and save lives!\n\nBecome an Advocate by sharing your story.

We rely on these amazing people for everything from giving words of encouragement, to a ride to doctor’s appointments, to help us relearn how to walk and talk, and simply be there by our side. We are honored and proud to add another one of these amazing sentinels to our list of Honorable Caregivers.\n\n—–\n\nI, Mari Davis, would love to nominate my husband, Geoff Davis.\n\nGeoff has been my rock throughout the ups, downs and all the shenanigans called Autoimmune Encephalitis. I was at work when suddenly I had seizures. No warning, no nothing. I was admitted to the intensive care unit and was intubated. Geoff was there. He had no idea what was happening, but he never wavered and was there. He had to call our college-age children and my parents to let them know that I was sick. I was sick, and he had to tell them he had no idea what was happening. He was at my side each night during my admission. He has been my cheerleader and a driving force in my efforts to become as functional as possible. In the last 5 years he has cried with me, laughed with me, and danced with me.\n\nWhen it became apparent that I wouldn’t be able to return to a job I loved he cried with me. He has laughed with me while I’ve creatively tried to find elusive words. He has danced with me each morning before day rehab just to bring a smile to my face. Even when I know he was nervous about how I would do, he never let me know and he was there.\n\nWhen I drove to Houston with our daughter and flew back on my own, I know he was scared, but he never let me know. Geoff simply offered support and was there. I know with Geoff, I can ask any question, no matter how crazy and he will answer it truthfully, even if the truth is difficult. He will be there. He has the patience of a saint. At times I have needed as much saintliness as possible. He had no idea how I would do long-term. He had no idea if the person I was before would be that person going forward. He was just glad I was here. And he was there.\n\nI would also like to nominate his mother Rubye Neely for raising such a great man. Thank you, Rubye, for raising Geoff to be the person he is and the person that I know will always be there.\n\nMari Davis, RN, ACM\n\nSupport Services Coordinator\n\nInternational Autoimmune Encephalitis Society\n\nClick here or the image below to subscribe to our mailing list :\n\nYour generous Donations allow IAES to continue our important work and save lives!\n\nOn June 16 th, 2022, Tabitha Orth, President and Founder of International Autoimmune Encephalitis Society officially became the 7,315 th “point of light”.

Edited by Dr Mastura Monif, Ms Tiffany Rushen, Dr Loretta Piccenna, Ms Amanda Wells (consumer representative) and Ms Sasha Ermichina (consumer representative).\n\nA message from IAES Blog Staff:\n\nIt is our honor and pleasure to present to all of you an overview of how autoimmune encephalitis can affect cognitive abilities. This overview is by the esteemed team at Monash University in Australia & lead by Dr. Mastura Monif, who is a member of IAES’ Medical Advisory Board.\n\nWe are proud to be in collaboration with Dr. Monif and her team in the Australian Autoimmune Encephalitis Consortium Project as we work closely with them to best support AE patients, caregivers and their families. This blog has been facilitated by IAES Support Services coordinator Mari Wagner Davis, with input from IAES volunteers Sasha Ermichina (impacted by GFAP AE) and Amanda Wells (caregiver for her daughter with AE). These IAES representatives provide input from their unique perspectives, helping to educate researchers in the difficulties that patients and families face.\n\nYou can find out more about the Australian Autoimmune Encephalitis Consortium and their efforts to help those with AE and their families via the following link:\n\nhttps://www.monash.edu/medicine/autoimmune-encephalitis\n\n—-\n\nRare and Seronegative Autoimmune Encephalitis\n\nSource: Seery N, Butzkueven H, O’Brien TJ, Monif. M. Rare Antibody-Mediated and Seronegative Autoimmune Encephalitis: an Update. Autoimmunity Rev. 2022 May 18;21(7);103118. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autrev.2022.103118\n\nWHY WE DID THIS WORK\n\n■ Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is a form of autoimmune disease whereby immune cells in the body inappropriately target components of the nervous system. This causes dysfunction of nerve cells, and in some cases death of these cells, and further produces different clinical symptoms that are reversible. Such symptoms include (but are not limited to) cognitive symptoms, such as difficulties with memory and language, seizures, movement disorders, and psychiatric symptoms.\n\n■ Antibodies are central to the diagnosis of many subtypes of autoimmune encephalitis. Generally, antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system to fight infections. In a proportion of patients with autoimmune encephalitis there can be an abnormal expression of antibodies, where, rather than targeting foreign molecules (e.g. viruses, bacteria), they mistakenly target self-proteins on nerve endings or self-proteins inside the nerve cell or neuron. In up to half of cases, an antibody is not detectable using current available tests or assays. This group of cases is called “seronegative” autoimmune encephalitis, i.e. denoting a lack of antibodies in the serum (a component of a patient’s blood) or cerebrospinal fluid (a clear fluid the surrounds the brain and spinal cord, obtained via a lumbar puncture, a procedure involving a fine needle being inserted in the lower back). ‘Seronegative’ autoimmune encephalitis most likely represents a broader collection of disorders.\n\n■ Over the last two decades, antibody-mediated subtypes of autoimmune encephalitis continue to be discovered, with over ten such forms now recognised. Further, following the respective discovery of such new forms of autoimmune encephalitis, disease mechanisms and clinical features have been revealed. However, seronegative autoimmune encephalitis remains less well characterised, possibly in part to because of its heterogeneous nature – meaning that a variety of diseases forms may be included by the definition.\n\n■ The purpose of our review was to explore advances regarding five rare antibody-mediated forms of autoimmune encephalitis, namely, anti-g-aminobutyric acid B (GABAB) receptor-, anti-a-amino-3hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropinoic receptor- (AMPAR), anti-GABAA receptor-and anti-dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein-6 (DPPX) encephalitis and IgLON5 disease.\n\n■ We also summarise current research and challenges in relation to ‘seronegative’ autoimmune encephalitis. For a detailed discussion of anti- NMDA autoimmune encephalitis, anti-LGI1 and anti-CASPR2 autoimmune encephalitis refer to (Contemporary advances in anti-NMDAR antibody (Ab)-mediated encephalitis -PubMed (nih.gov) (1) and Contemporary advances in antibody-mediated encephalitis: anti-LGI1 and anti-Caspr2 antibody (Ab)-mediated encephalitides -PubMed (nih.gov)) (2).\n\nWHAT WE FOUND\n\n■ GABAB, AMPAR and GABAA autoimmune encephalitis have common and distinguishing clinical features. These three forms of autoimmune encephalitis are diagnosed by the presence of antibodies found in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid of suspected patients. All three are relatively rare, compared to some other antibody-mediated forms of autoimmune encephalitis such as anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and anti-leucine-rich gliomainactivated 1 (LGI1) Ab-mediated encephalitis. GABAA encephalitis in particular is exceedingly rare, with approximately fifty cases reported overall as at a few years ago.\n\n■In these diseases, antibodies target the GABAB, AMPAR and GABAA receptors (proteins present on nerve cell endings), causing neuronal dysfunction. GABAB and GABAA receptors both attract an inhibitory neurotransmitter called GABA. A neurotransmitter is a signalling molecule that helps with communication and transmission of impulses between neurons, and inhibitory neurotransmitters reduce the likelihood a given neuron will generate an electrical signal called an action potential.\n\n■ Seizures in these diseases are a main feature, and may be particularly non-responsive to conventional anti-seizure treatment. Furthermore, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms are common in all three of these subtypes of autoimmune encephalitis. GABAB and AMPAR subtypes may have similar findings identified on MRI imaging of the brain, with inflammation and swelling seen in part of the brain called the mesial temporal lobe. The mesial temporal lobe is an area of the brain important for memory, emotion and behaviour.\n\n■ The diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis invariably necessitates that clinicians investigate for the possibility of a tumour (e.g. lung cancer, thyroid cancer, breast cancer) that may have triggered the disease. Treating the tumour or cancer where feasible and as promptly as possible has been linked to improvements in autoimmune encephalitis symptoms. Similarly, the presence of neurological symptoms, if preceding a cancer diagnosis, may allow for this to be facilitated more quickly than might have been the case otherwise, which may help afford a better chance of more effectively treating the underlying cancer.\n\n■ In approximately half of patients diagnosed with GABAB encephalitis, an underlying tumour is found, most often small-cell lung cancer. In AMPAR encephalitis, almost two-thirds of patients have an underlying tumour, with thymus tumours and lung cancer most common. In GABAA encephalitis, approximately one third of patients have also been shown to have an underlying tumour.\n\n■ DPPX encephalitis and IgLON5 disease are two rare and somewhat clinically unique forms of autoimmune encephalitis. In DPPX encephalitis, patients commonly present with profound weight loss or diarrhoea and have features of central-nervous system hyperexcitability. This is a state where the brain has increased responsiveness to a variety of external stimuli. In DPPX encephalitis, features attributed to CNS hyperexcitability include myoclonus, or rapid, involuntary muscle jerks, and tremor. IgLON5 disease on the other hand also has unique clinical features, such as a variety of sleep disturbances.\n\n■ Seronegative autoimmune encephalitis overall requires further study and description to identify potential antibodies which may be the cause. Seronegative limbic encephalitis is a form of seronegative autoimmune encephalitis, where the limbic structures in the brain are affected. In this subset of the disease inflammation is observed in the mesial temporal lobes using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Seronegative limbic encephalitis is typically seen in older patients, with conventional antibody testing not revealing an antibody. Patients typically have memory impairment, with or without psychiatric symptoms and seizures, and are treated with medications that lower effects of the immune system, as in other forms of autoimmune encephalitis.\n\nHOW CAN WE USE THIS RESEARCH\n\n■ These findings are intended to help researchers and clinicians better understand seronegative and rare forms of autoimmune encephalitis. By bringing this information together, it can assist with improving diagnosis and assisting with early treatment by clinicians.\n\n■ It should be noted that antibody-related forms of autoimmune encephalitis are usually diagnosed as “possible autoimmune encephalitis” prior to the availability of antibody results, which can take up to a period of weeks. A diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis is based on broad criteria involving consideration of a patient’s symptoms and test results, including MRI, electroencephalogram (EEG – a measure of the electrical activity of the brain) and cerebrospinal fluid biopsy results, combined with the exclusion other diseases, for example, viruses that could mimic the observed symptoms.\n\n■ Prompt diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis, and prompt exclusion of other causes such as viral encephalitis is very important, as there is a growing body of evidence indicating that earlier initiation of immune-lowering treatment for autoimmune encephalitis may be able to facilitate better recovery.\n\n■ The seronegative form of autoimmune encephalitis can represent a large proportion of autoimmune encephalitis patients overall so its understanding is crucial for improvements in clinical care.\n\n■ Regarding very rare subtypes of autoimmune encephalitis, an understanding of the characteristic features of these rare entities is crucial in forming a diagnostic workup plan. Further, awareness of the features of some of these rarer subtypes can ensure prompt and accurate investigation of underlying tumours. Knowledge of rarer subtypes may also be able to inform clinicians and patients about the possible outcomes of these conditions to inform day to day discussions with patients and their caregivers.\n\n—-\n\nFor more information and resources from Dr. Monif and her group at the Australian Autoimmune Encephalitis Consortium Project, visit this link here.
