        "text": "It was on the initiative of Félix Labisse that Henri Storck was charged with this commission.\n\nThe idea was to make a film of stock shots on the theme of energy and stage this argument through the life of a family carrying on their normal lives: shaving, ironing, hoovering, using a hammer-drill, etc. In Turin, on four screens in the form of a cross, there was five minutes of synchronous montage of these images that played on shape, movement and aesthetic effects.\n\nDirector : Henri Storck\n\nIdea : Henri Storck, Félix Labisse, Philippe Arthuys\n\nMusic, sound effects, editing : Philippe Arthuys\n\nCamera : Jean Rabier\n\nInserts of films by Bert Haanstra, Herman Van der Horst (the Netherlands), Emile Degelin (Belgium), Roger Leenhardt (France)\n\nProduction : CEP\n\nCommissioned film : European Economic Community, for the International Exhibition on Work in Turin, projection on four screens in the shape of a cross."
