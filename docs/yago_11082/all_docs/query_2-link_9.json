        "meta_description": "A perfect, fast and hilarious montage. Using images from Artis (Amsterdam Zoo), Bert Haanstra shows that a couple of similarities can be discovered between human and animal. Particularly the manner in which human and ape are confronted with each other, is significant. The images speak for themselves, human voices or commentary is absent. The ironic music of Pim Jacobs does add an extra dimension to the whole. With regards to human and animal Haanstra limits himself for the time being to this short film, recorded with a hidden camera. Later on, in several big films, he would return to this subject.",

        "text": "Haha! \"Who is watching who\" is the correct question. Haanstra does wonders with a hidden camera. The score is so important that it actually determines the editing and the order of the sequences; it never ceases to transmit irony.\n\nI don't know if I am getting this right, but the entire short worked comedically entirely against people. More than showing just \"similarities\", I perceive it as a mockery of people that look down on other animal species. We are all God's creatures, after all, but some sequences were extraordinarily assembled, from the staring contest to the yawning sequence.\n\nThis is a wonderful proof of what good editing can do with any footage. The ending is amazing too.\n\n97/100\n\nMasterful look at the animal kingdom - as Haanstra points his camera in all directions at a zoo. The humans are put on an equal plane with the animals they're watching and the results are tender and funny.\n\nThis is a concept that gets attempted in many ways but rarely succeeds (that of turning the tables to view the observers). It's Haanstra's gift for capturing the right emotions and putting them in a meaningful order that elevates this piece.\n\nAt it's heart, this is a marvelous achievement in editing and its syncopating jazz score really brings that to the front.\n\nAdded to: Bert Haanstra Ranked\n\nHaanstra's first foray into candid-camera documentaries is a beautiful example of not only the joys of a being in a zoo, but also a test of the medium. With the many images Haanstra collected of both the creatures in and out of the cages, he creates a weird, unspoken dialogue between the displayed ones and the beholders in a test of pure editing.\n\nHaanstra himself famously told once about the anecdote that started this whole film. One of the colleagues that helped him film had such a big and distorting pare of glasses that each time they went and filmed a little monkey, it would get so scared that it would twitch up and down, cover his face and ears. Haanstra immediately thought of things to edit against that image and thus Zoo was born.\n\nWatch online here.\n\nThis is an unbelievably humorous yet subtly caustic take on the concept of zoo. Who are the ones actually getting watched? The lens acts as merely a witness as shots after shots are presented and somehow it all gels together to form a realization that puts the egotism of humans into a very dubious perspective. For once, the angles are reversed, and we are actually presented a zoo through the eyes of the animals. Surprising, delightful and smart.\n\neh, not that interesting. glass (1958) by the same director is a much more engaging and artistic short than this. this montage of hidden camera candid footage of random dutch people in a zoo set to a saxy jazz track doesn't offer too much. there's the idea of \"who is watching who\" and..... that's about it. solid editing with a few particularly fun cuts synced to the music, but otherwise basically nothing to write home about. parts of it are mildly amusing but this is very forgetful."
