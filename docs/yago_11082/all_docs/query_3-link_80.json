Have an account? .\n\n\"The Sound of Music\" is a beloved movie musical, but even longtime fans might not know these facts.\n\nThe story was based on a real family, but there are historical inaccuracies woven into the plot.\n\nJulie Andrews was knocked over by helicopter-induced winds while filming the opening scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe story is largely historically inaccurate.\n\n\"The Sound of Music\" centers on the von Trapps, a real Austrian family.\n\nThe Broadway musical — which later inspired the 1965 film — was based on the memoir \"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers\" by Maria von Trapp (née Kutschera). But the plot didn't always stay true to the source material.\n\nFor example, there were 10 von Trapp children not seven, Maria came as a tutor for one of the children not as a governess for all of them, and Maria and Captain von Trapp were married 11 years before the family left Austria.\n\nPerhaps the largest historical inaccuracy was the climactic ending of the film, where the family escapes to Switzerland over the Alps as the Nazis invade Austria.\n\nAccording to History.com, the real family pretended they were going on vacation in Italy (by train) the day before the Austrian borders were closed. Once they arrived, they set up a plan to travel to the US.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Villa Trapp is a historical landmark in Austria, but they couldn't film the movie there.\n\nFans from across the globe travel to Salzburg, Austria, to tour the sets and real-life historical landmarks from the film, including the Villa Trapp, the von Trapp family's home.\n\nBut the villa couldn't actually be used as a filming site for the movie because it was occupied by the Missionaries of the Precious Blood at the time.\n\nToday, the home has been converted into a hotel, where fans can visit and learn the story of the real-life von Trapp family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFilming the opening scene was not as blissful as it appeared on the screen.\n\nTom Santopietro, the author of \"The Sound of Music Story,\" told Inside Edition in 2015 that filming the iconic opening scene, where Julie Andrews is joyfully singing in the mountains, wasn't easy.\n\n\"When the helicopter zoomed in on Julie Andrews, the downdraft from the helicopter was so strong that Julie Andrews kept getting knocked down into the mud,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharmian Carr also had a behind-the-scenes mishap during a musical number.\n\nAccording to the Independent Ireland, Charmian Carr, who played Leisl, injured herself while filming \"16 Going on 17.\"\n\nDuring the dance break, the character leaps across the benches lining the inside of a gazebo, but the costume department forgot to put rubber soles on the bottom of her shoes, so on her first jump, she slipped, broke one of the gazebo's glass panes, and sprained her ankle.\n\nDespite the injury, Carr finished filming the dance number — which garnered a standing ovation from the crew.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAndrews had to rescue the youngest von Trapp actor from drowning.\n\nAnthea \"Kym\" Karath, who played young Gretl von Trapp, also found herself in a precarious situation on set.\n\nAndrews recalled the filming of the scene where Maria and the kids fall out of the boat during a 2019 appearance on \"The Graham Norton Show.\"\n\n\"... Just before we rolled, this assistant director waded into the water and said, 'Can I ask you something Julie? The little one doesn't swim,'\" she said.\n\nHe then asked her to fall forward and try to get to Karath as quickly as possible once they landed in the water.\n\n\"... I went over the back rather than over the front. Never swum the breaststroke so fast in my life to get to her, \"Andrews continued. \"And that poor, lovely kid went under a couple of times, but she came up and threw up and then was fine.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe real Maria von Trapp made a cameo in the film.\n\nAccording to Express, the real Maria von Trapp made a brief cameo in the film.\n\nShe can be seen walking past an archway while Andrews is singing \"I Have Confidence.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristopher Plummer said Captain von Trapp was his most difficult role — largely because he didn't like the film.\n\nAs a trained Shakespearean actor, the late Christopher Plummer had plenty of starring roles under his belt before he joined the cast of \"The Sound of Music.\"\n\nBut during a Hollywood Reporter roundtable in 2011, the actor said it was the toughest role he ever played.\n\n\"Because it was so awful and sentimental and gooey,\" he said. \"You had to work terribly hard to try and infuse some miniscule bit of humor into it.\"\n\nPlummer later told The Daily Beast in 2017 that he wasn't particularly fond of the movie.\n\n\"It's not my cup of tea, that's all, and somebody had to be cynical,\" he said. \"Of course I don't loathe it. It's a really good movie of its kind. I think it's Julie's best picture.\"\n\nPlummer reportedly said he was drunk during his second \"Edelweiss\" performance\n\nPer the Irish Times, Plummer shared on the DVD commentary for the 35th anniversary edition of the film that he was drunk while filming the music festival scene — where he sings \"Edelweiss\" for the second time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Edelweiss\" has been mistaken for the Austrian national anthem by fans of the film.\n\nAfter \"The Sound of Music\" premiered, many fans seemed to assume that \"Edelweiss\" was Austria's national anthem.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, in 1984, Ronald Reagan reportedly even quoted \"Edelweiss\" in his toast to Austrian President Rudolf Kirchschläger during a state dinner at the White House.\n\nThe song was written specifically for the Broadway musical and later used in the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe real von Trapp family inadvertently sold their rights to the film.\n\nThe real Maria originally sold the rights to her memoir to German producers.\n\nThe two films they made, \"The Trapp Family\" (1956) and its sequel \"The Trapp Family in America\" (1958), were fairly successful in post-World War II West Germany.\n\nThe American playwrights then purchased the rights to the story from the German producers, so the real von Trapp family didn't have much of a say in \"The Sound of Music.\"\n\nBut the family does make some money from royalties, according to Vanity Fair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce the real von Trapps landed in America, they opened a family lodge.\n\nAfter the von Trapp family fled to America, they traveled around the country in a van for years performing concerts.\n\nThey eventually landed in Stowe, Vermont, where they purchased a lodge on a farm.\n\nThe Trapp Family Lodge is still operated by members of the von Trapp family today, and guests can stay at the resort and learn about their story.\n\nThe film was on a list of broadcast programs to be aired in the event of a nuclear strike during the Cold War.\n\nAccording to BBC, during the height of the Cold War, \"The Sound of Music\" was part of a series of recorded programs the network had on hand to play on a loop in the instance of a nuclear strike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo original songs were written for the movie.\n\nFamous duo Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II wrote and composed the music for the Broadway musical, most of which was included in the movie.\n\nLike many movie adaptations of musicals, original songs were also added to \"The Sound of Music.\" But Hammerstein died in 1960, five years before its premiere, so Rodgers wrote \"I Have Confidence\" and \"Something Good\" on his own.\n\nRead More:\n\nRead next\n\nMovie Movies\n\nAdvertisement"
