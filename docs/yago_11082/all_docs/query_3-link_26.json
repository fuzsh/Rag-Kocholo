        "text": "Since MTV launched in 1981, music videos have become a respected and distinctive form of artistic expression as well as an essential marketing tool for popular music. At the head of every music video is a director: the experienced professional who supervises the production team, oversees filming and editing, and, in some cases, provides a guiding creative vision. Although over the last two decades music videos have shifted away from their television origins, finding a larger audience on websites like YouTube, the music video production process has remained mostly the same—and it all begins with finding a director.\n\nMusic video directors walk a fine line between expressing their artistic vision and satisfying clients, which requires a nuanced blend of conviction and adaptability.\n\nThe process begins when a record company, manager, or artist sends a song—often a single from a forthcoming album—to an assortment of production companies and freelance directors. Each one competes for the position by submitting a \"treatment,\" i.e. a written concept pitch describing the director's vision for the video. If chosen, the director begins to assemble a production team, which may include storyboard artists, location scouts, camera operators, lighting crew, costumers, makeup artists, and casting agents."
