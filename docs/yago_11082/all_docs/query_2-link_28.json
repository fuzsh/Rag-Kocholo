By focusing his camera on life's small moments -- a child going to school, a couple kissing in a park -- Haanstra reveals the deep emotional connections and community-minded manners that are singularly Dutch. He follows the quietly bustling lives of shopkeepers, housewives and everyday Dutch citizens to paint a portrait of a shy but very proud people.",
