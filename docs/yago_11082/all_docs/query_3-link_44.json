        "text": "The Music Man, American musical film, released in 1962, that was based on a hit 1957 Broadway show written by Meredith Willson.\n\nHarold Hill (played by Robert Preston) is a charismatic con man who arrives in River City, Iowa, in the summer of 1912. Posing as a music professor seeking to prevent moral turpitude, he affably persuades the townspeople to invest money toward a marching band for local boys. Hill’s intention is to abscond with the funds, but his scheme is complicated when he falls in love with the town librarian, Marian Paroo (Shirley Jones), and cannot bring himself to leave. Eventually the citizens of River City discover the scam and take Hill to the town hall, where meanwhile a group of boys have convened with musical instruments. Hill manages to direct the boys in an impromptu performance, which puts him in the town’s favour once again.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia"
