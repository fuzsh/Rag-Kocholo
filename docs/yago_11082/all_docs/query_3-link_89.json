        "text": "On the face of it, The Mission would seem like a surprising choice for Australia’s favourite piece of film music in 2013.\n\nAs far as the film world goes, Roland Joffé’s colonial drama about a Jesuit mission on 18th century Guaraní land has today been largely forgotten. Music aside, The Mission rarely appears on retrospective lists or tops critical favourites. At the time of writing, the film is surprisingly unavailable to watch in Australia on any digital service, whether that’s streaming or for purchase, and readers wanting to see the film will have to turn to DVD. And that’s if indeed they do want to see it at all: a quick internet search for the film and its director turns up 112,000 results. By contrast, the same search for the number two entry in the 2013 list (Star Wars and Lucas) returns roughly 52 million. On the cinephile social network Letterboxd, The Mission languishes as the 36th most-watched film from the year 1986 — just behind Howard the Duck (oof)and Friday the 13th: Part VI (yikes).\n\nRe-vote for the Classic 100: Music in the Movies\n\nHowever, the triumph of The Mission in the Classic 100 is not so surprising once you listen to its music. Ennio Morricone is a composer of prodigious output — some 400 scores so far, from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly to Cinema Paradiso — and for many, The Mission sits atop that formidable list.\n\nThe answer to The Mission’s popularity in part lies in “Gabriel’s Oboe”, a soaring main theme for the film written in a post-Renaissance style, full of ornamentation and intricacy. It is not an insult to The Mission but a compliment to Morricone to say that a great many more people have heard this piece of music than seen the film it was written for. “Gabriel’s Oboe” has lived a long and graceful life beyond The Mission, from the concert hall to formal gatherings and the everyday background of people’s lives.\n\nA great soundtrack, undoubtedly. A film in its twilight, possibly. But there’s more to The Mission, Morricone’s score, and its complex legacy.\n\nThe Mission — the movie\n\nIn 1986, British director Roland Joffé seemed on the cusp of becoming Hollywood royalty. His first film, The Killing Fields, a biographical drama about two journalists in Pol Pot’s Cambodia, had received seven Oscar nominations including Best Director. Then came The Mission, which won the coveted Palme d’Or at Cannes.\n\nYet his following two films (Fat Man and Little Boy from 1989 and City of Joy from 1992) both flopped critically and commercially. Uncharacteristically, Joffé then produced and partially directed (uncredited) the appalling Super Mario Bros. movie from 1993, and has not troubled Hollywood since.\n\nYet back in 1986, things were looking good for Joffé, and that most certainly included The Mission. With a script by Robert Bolt (who also penned Doctor Zhivago and Lawrence of Arabia, entries five and six on the Classic 100), The Mission tells the story of Father Gabriel, a Jesuit missionary, and Rodrigo Mendoza, a brutal man who captures Indigenous peoples as slaves for a living, in what today would be Argentinean and Paraguayan jungle. The film has quite a cast: Jeremy Irons plays Gabriel, while Robert De Niro plays Mendoza. Aidan Quinn, Cherie Lunghi, and a young Liam Neeson play supporting roles. The film is spectacularly shot by cinematographer Chris Menges, who rightfully won the film’s only Oscar that year.\n\nAfter a tense encounter with the Guaraní, Gabriel successfully sets up a mission in the jungle, and is joined by a repentant Mendoza, who becomes a Jesuit after murdering his brother early in the film. The Mission’s fundamental conflict comes from these two characters’ responses to Portuguese government threats of invasion and slavery for the Guaraní. Gabriel seeks non-violence, while Mendoza argues for armed resistance.\n\nThe Mission is a film with a lot of sympathy for its colonising missionaries, but little time for developing any of its indigenous characters. Not one is named anything more specific than “Indian Chief”, “Witch Doctor”, “Indian Boy” and so on, and certainly none become active participants in the story. Colonisation happens to them: that is the sum of the Guaraní’s existence in the film. Despite The Mission’s obvious criticism of the violence of colonisers (the ideological violence of the Jesuits is largely uncommented on), De Niro’s slaver Mendoza is forgiven for his murders and his contemptable trade in a short matter of minutes.\n\nThere are other films in a similar vein to The Mission — Martin Scorsese’s Silence (2016, also starring Neeson), and Werner Herzog’s Aguirre, the Wrath of God (1972) and Fitzcarraldo (1982), for example — many of which have more to say than The Mission. Then there is Even the Rain, Icíar Bollaín’s 2010 meta-film about an ambitious director and rich producer travelling to Bolivia to use poor locals to play their murdered ancestors in a cinematic retelling of Columbus’ bloody arrival in the Americas. That film features the stark image of a huge conquistador cross being lifted by helicopter into the jungle to be part of a film set. One wonders how many crosses the crew of The Mission brought to their jungle, too.\n\nThe score in the film\n\nFor all that, The Mission is very much a film with music on its mind, too.\n\n“Gabriel’s Oboe,” the film’s most famous theme, appears early in the film as Father Gabriel ascends the beautifully-shot Iguazu Falls to set up his mission. His predecessor was tied to a cross by the Guaraní and thrown over the falls, and to avoid this same grisly fate, Gabriel plays Morricone’s theme on an oboe he has brought with him on the perilous journey. Despite the Guaraní leader breaking the oboe in half, Gabriel’s performance seems to convince the Guaraní to leave him unharmed, and he goes about his missionary work. “With an orchestra, the Jesuits could have subdued the whole continent,” remarks a papal emissary in a horrifying moment of candour.\n\nMusic is used in The Mission as a symbol of humanity. Midway through the film, an uncaring collection of colonisers are given an angelic singing performance from a Guaraní boy. This is an (unsuccessful) attempt by the Jesuits to convince the government of the Guaraní’s humanity. Morricone uses choirs throughout his score for The Mission, sometimes drawing ironic parallels between the religious idealism presented and the dispassionate violence it is confronted with.\n\nIndeed, Morricone’s score contains more than just the great “Gabriel’s Oboe.” “On Earth As It Is In Heaven” is a liturgical piece for choir that appears several times throughout the film and, like “Gabriel’s Oboe,” has lead a life beyond it as a favourite of choirs.\n\nEqually, Morricone’s theme titled “Falls” is a simple, undulating melody evoking the Guaraní land that is so beautifully shot for The Mission. Morricone later incorporated this theme into Voci dal silenzio, his concert work to commemorate the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nLife beyond the film\n\nNone of this, however, quite accounts for the lasting popularity of Morricone’s score. Possibly, it makes it even more mystifying.\n\nMorricone’s score for The Mission is a rare cinematic beast. Yes, it certainly serves the film well, and elevates it to a place in popular culture it may not otherwise hold. For those who have seen and enjoyed The Mission, the memory of its music will expand the score’s resonance.\n\nYet there is this curious afterlife for Morricone’s music here. Beyond the film, “Gabriel’s Oboe” has been performed and recorded by countless musicians, from Yo-Yo Ma to André Rieu. In 1998, singer Sarah Brightman convinced Morricone to allow lyrics to be put to the melody, and it became, in Italian, “Nella Fantasia”, sung by everyone from Il Divo to Russell Watson. New Zealand soprano Hayley Westenra, meanwhile, wrote her own English lyrics to the tune in 2010 and it became “Whispers in a Dream.” “Gabriel’s Oboe” is also popular for weddings and sporting events, and is still a common selection for orchestral concerts of popular and film music.\n\nIn his 2017 memoir Memory of Music, Andrew Ford writes about encountering an ill young woman. “When ‘Gabriel’s Oboe’ played, she felt somehow safe, and when she remembered the sound — for instance, when she described it to me — she felt safe again.” Any internet search will reveal dozens of similar comments about how much this piece of music means to people — some even say it saved their lives.\n\nBut the fact that these pieces from The Mission — “Gabriel’s Oboe,” “On Earth As It Is In Heaven,” “The Falls” — have led such rich lives, adored by so many beyond the context of the film itself indicate something unique about Morricone’s score. Some who love Morricone’s music will have seen the film. Many, however, will not. That’s unlikely to be the case for Star Wars, or for most other films in the ABC Classic top ten. One is unlikely to adore the music for Lord of the Rings without ever having taken a journey to Middle-earth.\n\nThe Mission — the film — does not anchor its painfully beautiful music in popular culture in the same way. Is it this that, somewhat perversely, allows The Mission’s music to have such widespread appeal? For many, there is simply no association to dwell on while listening. Certainly, there is far less of an association than for the music for any of Morricone’s gunslinging westerns, or the childhood nostalgia of his Cinema Paradiso. Pop culture has declined to grip The Mission in its domineering embrace.\n\nCounterintuitively, perhaps this is why The Mission is loved by so many and is worthy of the number one spot. These pieces float freely in the concert hall, in the wedding chapel, on the radio, free to be taken for what they are, free to simply be heard.\n\nFor The Mission, there is only music, only “Gabriel’s Oboe.” Only Ennio Morricone."
