        "text": "Over the past few years, Music Meets Film (MMF) has become a recognizable platform and a highly anticipated series of events. In 2023 MMF returned in a new format and will continue to provide the possibility of a meeting place for extending the film and film music professionalsâ network but our focus will be on young new talent.\n\nThe program brings together composers and directors; from music and sound creatives to producers, agents, and the wider music and film industry. It aims to build bridges between creatives, grow as an interdisciplinary meeting place, and encourage new international collaborations between students and professionals.\n\nMusic Meets Film 2024\n\nSubmissions for Music Meets Film 2024 participation are open. Learn about the submissions here\n\nThe program will be announced at the beginning of autumn, but we already have some bits and pieces we can share. Check here the first highlights of the 2024 program\n\nMusic Meets Film 2023\n\nMusic Meets Film (MMF) returns with its 11th edition and is welcoming a new focus on young talent while continuing to provide the possibility of a meeting place for extending the film and film music professionalsâ network.\n\nThe aim is to offer a highly practical program of lectures and masterclasses to young composers to provide realistic tools for their careers. These will encourage them and help them to navigate the industry in the filmmaking process with the whole team, knowing oneâs intellectual and financial rights as well as how the creative process of composing for a film comes together.\n\nThe participants will be able to attend MMF's panels and masterclasses led by award-winning professionals and industry-leading companies and partners. From each session, the participants could gain precise practical knowledge and possible new connections to advance their careers. We will dive into the following:\n\nThe communication between the director and the composer\n\nWill get answers to the burning questions about intellectual rights and fees\n\nDo a case study of an award-winning film\n\nCreate and analyze film scores\n\nEven more, the participants can also join other Discovery Campusâ open lectures and take part in speed meetings to connect with new friends and colleagues.\n\nDiscovery Campusâ leading idea this year is collaboration. With collaboration, we can expand our network, spark new ideas and get inspired, find new projects for the future and gain knowledge from othersâ experiences.\n\nThis is all possible in November in Tallinn, where almost every film area representatives from all over the world come together. This is the place and chance to make your next step.\n\nCHECK THE PROGRAMME OF MUSIC MEETS FILM\n\nHighlights of the 2023 Music Meets Film programme\n\nMasterclass by John Altman\n\nWhat are the practicalities of film scoring, and how much creative freedom does a film composer have? Which creative languages are used in the filmmaking process, and which language are the characters responding in? Acclaimed composer, arranger and songwriter John Altman will lead the journey through these questions to address their answers in the case study of the Emmy-winning score of the film RKO 281 score (1999, dir. Benjamin Ross).\n\nJohn Altman has composed, arranged, conducted, produced and directed countless music for television and film including Titanic, Little Voice, Goldeneye, Leon, Peake Practice and RKO 281 for which he won an Emmy. As an arranger and conductor heâs worked on hit records for artists including Rod Stewart, Diana Ross, Tina Turner, Roy Orbison, Simple Minds, George Michael. He has written, arranged and produced the music for over 4,000 commercials worldwide. He is an incredible saxophonist and has played or recorded with the likes of Little Richard, Prince, David Bowie, The Damned, Eric Clapton, Sting, Jimi Hendrix, Chet Baker, Bob Marley, Amy Winehouse, Muddy Waters, Phil Collins. The list is endless.\n\nScoring masterclass with Orchestral Tools\n\nWithin this masterclass, the participants will have a chance to create scores for a preselected film clip with Orchestral Toolsâ virtual instruments. The scores will be created beforehand and during the masterclass they will be listened to and analyzed with the filmâs director and composer. In this method young composers can get direct feedback to their music as well as see how the film can change through the hands of different composers and visions.\n\nPanel discussion. The Art of Translation: Communication Between the Director and the Composer\n\nIn teamwork and in filmmaking, communication is the essence of collaboration and progress. This topic arises especially with situations where people who speak different languages come together. In our case it is so with directors and composers. How to understand each other and translate your craft to a language to explain your approach and ideas so that you still respect oneâs professional boundaries and also maintain flexibility within the process of making a film? The art of translation is explaining your ideas and approach as a composer to a director who does not have a musical background. Similarly, it is the other way around: how do you understand the directorâs vision and also trust them with the big picture and your creation within it?\n\nHow to explain your musical choices? What to do if the director crosses the line of their area of expertise? What is the role of a supervisor and how can it help understanding each other? Where does the line of flexibility and trust run between standing your ground? How to co-create the film in such an organic way that when the audience walks out of the screening, they wonât remember the score, but if they were to hear it again, it will take them back to the film?\n\nThe panelists include Nis BÃ¸gvad, music supervisor, director Tanel Toom and a acknowledged composer (TBA)\n\nMusic Meets Film programme takes place 14-17 November 2023.\n\nLearn more about MMFâs past panels from here\n\nIf you have any related questions regarding MMF, feel free to contact the project manager Hanna-Greth Peetson hannagreth.peetson@poff.ee\n\nMusic Meets Film is proud to be sponsored by Orchestral Tools, a German-based sample library company, and Tallinn UNESCO City of Music..
