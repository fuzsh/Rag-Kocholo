        "text": "A recently popularized field, music supervision is the art of selecting and licensing preexisting songs or recordings for use in visual media like film, television, video games, and advertising. A skilled music supervisor might choose the perfect song to enhance a dramatic television moment, help an advertising producer make smart, inspired music choices, or find a cost-effective workaround when a film's plot requires a particularly expensive, hard-to-license recording. Music might be selected based around a central guiding aesthetic, a sense of how the music would complement a specific scene, or knowledge that a certain new track is well positioned to succeed.\n\nMusic supervisors must possess a natural sense of the emotional and narrative nuance of music, lots of experience with music synchronization and licensing, and strong verbal communication skills.\n\nIn order to use a piece of pre-existing music—a song or recording—music supervisors must negotiate the rights and costs with licensing representatives employed by record labels, music publishers, and the original artists or songwriters themselves. Sometimes these negotiations are purely about cost, whereas others it's about convincing the artist—who may not like the project or the music's context within it—to license the song at all. When music placements are successful, the results typically benefit both camps: the songwriters, artists, and record label receive exposure and royalties, while the movie, television, or video game producers piggyback on the value of the artist's brand, or simply use the emotional depth and poignancy of the music to tell their stories."
