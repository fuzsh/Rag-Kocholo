        "text": "by Nathaniel R\n\nThe Netherlands have submitted the magical realist drama Buladó for the upcoming Oscars. It's the third feature-length film from 42 year-old biracial director Eché Janga. It's a rarity for a Dutch submission in that it doesn't take place in The Netherlands but in one of the former Dutch colonies. It's set in the Caribbean Island of Curaçao (Janga's father is Curaçaoan) and is largely in the language of Papiamento rather than Dutch.\n\nThe Netherlands have an interesting Oscar history because they've won nearly half the time when nominated but the nominations are not super common. They're currently in their longest Oscar drought ever as they haven't been nominated since 2003 (despite three finalists since then)...\n\nGenerally when countries do well with the Oscars over a long period it has a lot to do with homegrown auteurs. Part of the problem with The Netherlands is that the films of their most famous living director (Paul Verhoeven) and even some of their less famous directors are too extreme for the sensibilities of Academy voters, even when they're well received by critics and other awards bodies (think Elle, Soldier of Orange, and Black Book) develop cult classic status (The Fourth Man, Showgirls, Starship Troopers) or are box office smashes in the English language (Basic Instinct, Total Recall).\n\nLet's look at the country's Oscar history...\n\nTHE NETHERLAND'S OSCAR STATS\n\nSubmitting since 1959 (the fourth year of the competition)\n\n53 Total Submissions\n\n7 Nominations (and 3 Additional Finalists)\n\n3 Wins\n\nKEY SUBMISSIONS\n\nThe Village on the River (1959) Nominee Director Fons Rademakers (1920-2007) was behind the first Dutch film nominated AND the first to win, nearly three decades later.\n\nTurkish Delight (1973) Nominee\n\nSoldier of Orange (1977) Paul Verhoeven's film is considered one of the greatest Dutch films of all time but it failed to make Oscar's list despite a Golden Globe nomination\n\nA Woman Like Eve (1979) The first time The Netherlands sent a female director was this drama from feminist Nouchka van Brakel about a woman leaving her husband for another woman. They've sent several female filmmakers since then.\n\nThe Fourth Man (1983) One of the raciest films we can recall being submitted to Oscar -- homosex, heterosex, extreme violence (it's Verhoeven, what do you expect?), and sometimes combinations of those things -- and supposedly the biggest Dutch hit ever within US arthouses... but Oscar passed as you would easily expect. (I rented it on VHS in the late 80s when I was too young for it and was absolutely scandalized.)\n\nThe Assault (1986) Winner\n\nThe Vanishing (1988) This morbid thriller and international hit was disqualified for some reason (and then remade in English with Jeff Bridges as the villain to diminishing returns, qualitatively speaking)\n\nAntonia's Line (1995) Winner\n\nCharacter (1997) Winner\n\nZus & Zo (2002) Nominee\n\nTwin Sisters (2003) Nominee\n\nBlack Book (2006) Finalist but this one sadly missed the nomination though it was widely regarded as a strong return to form for Verhoeven after his Hollywood years. Plus that spectacular leading performance from Carice van Houten\n\nWinter in Wartime (2009) Finalist\n\nAccused (2014) Finalist\n\nMost Frequently Submitted Dutch Directors\n\nFons Rademaker (5 submissions, 2 nominated films, 1 of which won)\n\nPaul Verhoeven (4 submissions - 1 nominated film, 1 finalist... he also had a submission from France recently with Elle which Oscar also passed on outside of Best Actress. Grrrr)\n\nPaula van der Oest (3 submissions - 1 nominated film, 1 finalist)\n\nPieter Verhoeff (3 submissions, none of them nominated)\n\n[TIE] 2 submissions each, neither of them nominated: Mijke de Jong, Alex van Warmerdam, Nouchka van Brakl, Maria Petters, Rudolf van den Berg and Bert Haanstra\n\nVillage on the River is a real sleeper. It should have won, as well as Turkish Delight - beats the hell out of the winner, Truffaut's narcissistic valentine to himself, Day for Night\n\nThe Fourth Man is so excellent, it also made a star out of Jeroen Krabbe, and probably the most controversial scene is Krabbe feeling up Jesus on the cross in a church.\n\nZus and Zo is one of the most putrid films ever to get an Oscar nomination. A dopey comedy about some sisters trying to prevent their gay brother from marrying, in order to preserve an inheritance (or something like that, I've tried to flush it out of my mind). And to think they chose this stinker over The Son, Oasis, Mondays in the Sun, Lilja 4-Ever, 8 Women, and, wait for it, City of God!\n\nThe Twin Sisters is excellent, it's a shame it never got much of a distribution in the USA.\n\nThe Vanishing was disqualified under a rule that's now been discarded that the film had to be primarily in the language of the submitting country. It's almost entirely in French. I'll just mention here that this may be the scariest movie ever for me. I saw it 30 years ago and it STILL gives me nightmares now and then. That ending!"
