        "text": "Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot was based on a 1951 German film. But that film was a remake of an earlier 1935 French comedy. This is the original about two down-on-their-luck musicians dressing up as women to play in an all-girl band - the Tulips of Holland. It doesn't have Wilder's script or Marilyn. But it's still quite delightful, and the musical numbers aren't bad either.\n\nJean (Fernand Gravey) and Pierre (Julien Carette) are a funny duo - with mismatched height like Mutt and Jeff.

Jean and Pierre disguise themselves as women to audition, ultimately landing the job and joining the group as they travel, rehearse, and perform together, facing unexpected twists and turns along the way.\n\nThe film was restored in 4K from the original 35mm nitrate fine grain and a vintage 35mm print, which is the…"
