JIMMY\n\nFriday June 28th 4:00pm\n\nCLICK HERE FOR TICKETS AND TRAILER\n\nAkio Sakurai has dedicated his life to honoring Jimmy Page. For 30 years, he recreated vintage Zeppelin concerts note-for-note in small Tokyo clubs, until the real Jimmy Page stopped by one night, and Akio’s life changed forever.

An auditory delight for music fans everywhere, this enthralling film received Led Zeppelin’s blessing to feature music from more than twenty-five of their songs as performed by Mr. Jimmy.

Standing strong with her singular confidence, Dane emanated the people-powered connectivity of folk, the defiance of blues and the elemental cool of jazz, while propelling major historic events with boldness and subversion that cut through commercial artifice and earned her a 5” FBI file.\n\nTHE 9 LIVES OF BARBARA DANE is an underground history of a singer-agitator overlooked by many storytellers of American history. Overlooked, that is, until now. Dane’s unbending principles guide her through notoriety, obscurity, and finally, music legend.\n\nThrough the lens of a recent concert tour, we examine an outspoken and tireless artist whose devotion to music and social justice showcases the vigor and spirit at the heart of American dissent.\n\nMaureen Gosling has been a documentary filmmaker for 50 years. She has worked as director, producer, editor, sound recordist and distributor. Producer/Director credits include the feature doc THIS AIN’T NO MOUSE MUSIC! (premiered SXSW), with Chris Simon, on the legacy of American roots music record producer, Chris Strachwitz; and the feature doc BLOSSOMS OF FIRE, on the Isthmus Zapotecs of Oaxaca, Mexico (HBO Latino). Gosling edited PLEISTOCENE PARK (VICE); THE LONG SHADOW (PBS); A NEW COLOR (PBS) and many other docs. She is best known for her 20-year collaboration (as co-filmmaker, editor, sound recordist) with the late Les Blank on more than 20 films, including BURDEN OF DREAMS (BAFTA for Best Documentary 1982). For the last 20 years, she has worked with Producer Jed Riffe on nine films, including CALIFORNIA’S “LOST” TRIBES, of the PBS series CALIFORNIA AND THE AMERICAN DREAM. Gosling is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture, Arts and Sciences.\n\nWHERE DOES THE MUSIC COME FROM?\n\nSaturday June 29th 4:00pm\n\nCLICK HERE FOR TICKETS AND TRAILER\n\nSpecial Live Presentation – Book signing beforehand with complimentary glass of wine!\n\nA Behind-the-Scenes Look at Creating Film Scores\n\nWith film clips from\n\nStar Trek, National Geographic, and Stephen King’s Silver Bullet\n\nPresented by\n\nEmmy Award-Winning Composer, Jay Chattaway\n\n&\n\nProducer and Author, Terri Potts-Chattaway\n\nPlease join us for a very special afternoon, including a (wine & cheese) reception starting at 3:15PM, and book launch by Edgartown Books of Ms. Chattaway’s book.\n\nJoin Jay Chattaway and learn about the world of film scoring and the creative choices and other factors involved in bringing motion pictures to life through musical scoring.

Tornatore’s documentary portrait examines the breadth of the maestro’s career, from his early Italian pop songs to the fistful of unforgettable film scores that he wrote, including The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly, The Thing, Days of Heaven, and hundreds of others. Packed with insightful commentary from Morricone’s collaborators and contemporaries, Ennio affords the master one last chance to recount his career and deconstruct his artistic process.\n\nFeaturing interviews with Clint Eastwood Quentin Tarantino John Williams Hans Zimmer Quincy Jones Dario Argento Bruce Springsteen Joan Baez Wong Kar-Wai and many more!\n\n“… Ennio is another cinephilic paean …. There’s much to see and to hear, most of it delightful …. Morricone turns out to be a total charmer, a low-key showman with a demure gaze that he works like a vamp and an impish smile that routinely punctuates one of his anecdotes.” – Manohla Dargis, New York Times Critic’s Pick\n\nArtist Reception: Harriet Bernstein\n\nSunday June 30th 1:00-3:00pm\n\nJoin us for an artist reception featuring the work of Harriet Bernstein, in the Feldman Family Artspace, located in the lobby of the Martha’s Vineyard Film Center. The show is available to view June 10-July 7\n\nHarriet\n\nAbout Harriet Bernstein:\n\nIn the 1980’s, I lived in SoHo, NY. It was the big art boom that launched David Salle, Julian Schnable and others into fame and fortune. It was a heady time and though I had moved to New York for improvisational dance, I saturated my eyes with art. Somewhere around then, my artist boyfriend took me to see Agnes Martin’s large, meditative canvases in subdued pastels. Those canvases stole my heart with their soft, feminine expression like the ocean itself. And with that, a seed was planted to someday paint.\n\nHarriet\n\nIt was The Vineyard, with some help from a pandemic, that got me painting. I sat down to paint my homages to Agnes Martin, but these wild colorful works came out instead.\n\nHarriet\n\nWhat started on a dining room table now takes over my living room. As my work continues to grow, I am in search of studio space —barn, shed, storefront — where I can make larger, more meditative work still inspired by Agnes Martin, who said the attractiveness of art work is that it is “adventurous, strenuous and joyful”. I concur.\n\nLUTHER: NEVER TOO MUCH\n\nSunday June 30th 4:00pm\n\nCLICK HERE FOR TICKETS AND TRAILER\n\nFollowed by a discussion with the director, Dawn Porter\n\nWe’d like to thank our sponsors for their support & generosity"
