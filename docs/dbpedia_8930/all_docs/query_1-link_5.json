Presentation by Mary Barile and Christine Montgomery on their new book, \"Merit, Not Sympathy, Wins: The Life and Times of Blind Boone.\"\n\nIn post-Reconstruction America, Boone, an illiterate musician, overcame obstacles created by disability, exploitative managers and racial prejudice to become one of the country's most beloved concert performers. The story of Blind Boone is revitalized in Barile and Montgomery's annotated edition of Melissa Fuell-Cuther's original, out-of-print 1915 biography, Blind Boone: His Life and Achievements. Accompanied by essays describing Boone's environment and achievements as well as his present-day place in American music, the work recounts Boone' s harrowing journey and testifies to the struggles of African-Americans during the Jim Crow era.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe Office of the Missouri Secretary of State and Missouri Archives make NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, regarding the accuracy, reliability, completeness, timeliness or applicability for a particular purpose of the information contained in this video and make no endorsement of the opinions of the presenter offered therein.
