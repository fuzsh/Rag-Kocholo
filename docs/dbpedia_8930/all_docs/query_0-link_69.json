        "text": "This section of our Web Site covers the earliest generations of Daniel Boone's family to arrive and live in America, starting with Daniel Boone's grandfather George Boone, Sr. The material herein is considered by most Boone family scholars to be the most reliable Boone family genealogy information available. That does not mean that the information is error free, even though it is considered the best.\n\nThe Boone Genealogy will be presented in four parts as follows:\n\nPart 1 - The Boone Family Genealogy (1788) as written by James Boone (1744-1795)\n\n(Lyman Copeland Draper Manuscript Collection)\n\nPart 2 - The Boone Family Genealogy (1922) as compiled by Hazel Atterbury Spraker (1883-1963)\n\n(The Boone Family: A Genealogical History of the Descendants of George and Mary Boone Who Came to America in 1717)\n\nPart 3 - Yet To Come - The Boone Family Genealogy (1964) as compiled by Lilian Hays Oliver (1898-1984)\n\n(Some Boone descendants and kindred of the St. Charles District)\n\nPart 4 - Yet To Come - The Boone Family Genealogy (1987) as compiled by Sarah Ridge Rockenfield (1917-1991)\n\n(Our Boone Families, Daniel Boones Kinfolks)\n\nPART 1 - THE BOONE FAMILY GENEALOGY\n\nWRITTEN BY JAMES BOONE IN 1788\n\nThe earliest known record of the Boone family Genealogy was originally brought from England and preserved by Daniel Boone's uncle John Boone, who was considered the scholar of the family. John passed the information on to his nephew James, who was also a scholar and family historian, and who recorded the data both accurately and beautifully. He made at least two copies, both of which are mentioned below, and one of which, the first one mentioned, became a part of the Draper Collection of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin. James gave one copy to Jonathan Boone, the son of Daniel Boone's brother Squire. It is rather certain that Daniel and Squire and the others who saw this copy, accepted the information as a true version of their ancestry.\n\nA note found in the Draper Manuscripts (Draper Mss. Appendix N-iii.) offers the following additional information:\n\n\"It is proper that some notice of the authenticity of this curious document, and some account of the writer, should precede the narrative itself. Jonathan, eldest son of Squire Boone, the brother of Col. Daniel Boone, was sent, in or about the year 1787, to Berks county, Pennsylvania, to attend school; and there residing among his relatives, received the instructions of his father's cousin, James Boone; and returning home to Kentucky the next year, brought with him this Genealogical Narrative, written by the said James Boone, as is endorsed on the instrument, March 21st, 1788. (1) It is a beautiful specimen of chirography, as hundreds can attest who have seen it: \"I can truly say,\" declares Mr. Charles Cist, the well‑known statistician of Cincinnati, \"I never examined a more remarkable manuscript document.\" This genealogical account has been preserved in Jonathan Boone's family, and from his grandson, Col. Wm. P. Boone, a prominent attorney at law of Louisville, Ky., the original has been obtained. This document is fully corroborated by another though briefer sketch, in precisely the same hand‑writing, preserved by the late aged Miss Susannah Boone, raised in Berks county, Pa., and obtained from her half brother, James W. Biddle, Esqr., editor of the Pittsburg Daily American. The dates are precisely the same, so far as they go, in both papers. The same general dates also appear in a similar record preserved by a nephew of said James Boone, Mr. John Boone, of Berks county, Pa.

(that is the first that we have heard of) was born in England.\n\nGEORGE BOONE, II. (Son of George Boone, the First) was born in or near the City of Exeter in Devonshire; being a Blacksmith; his Wife's Maiden Name was Sarah Uppey. He died aged 60; and she died aged 80 years, and never had an aching Bone, or decay'd Tooth.\n\nGEORGE BOONE, III. (son of George & Sarah Boone) was born at Stoak (a Village near the City of Exeter) in A. D. 1666, being a Weaver; his Wife's Maiden Name was Mary Maugridge, who was born in BRADNINCH (eight Miles from the City of Exeter) in the Year 1669, being a Daughter of John Maugridge & Mary his Wife whose maiden Name was Milton They (the said George & Mary Boone) had nine Children that lived to be Men and Women: namely, George, Sarah, Squire, Mary, John, Joseph, Benjamin, James & Samuel, having each of them several Children, excepting John who was never married. The said George and Mary Boone with their Family, came from the Town of Bradninch in Devonshire, Old‑England (which is a Town at 8 miles Distance from the City of Exeter, and 177 measured Miles Westward from London); they left Bradninch the 17 Aug. 1717, and went to Bristol where they took Shipping, and arrived at Philadelphia in 1717 September 29, Old‑Stile, or October 10th New‑Stile; three of their Children, to wit, George, Sarah & Squire they sent in a few Years before. From Philadelphia they went to Abington, and staid a few Months there; thence to North‑Wales, and liv'd about 2 Years there; thence to Oley in the same County of Philadelphia, where Sarah (being married) had moved to some Time before. This last Place of their Residence (since the Divisions made in the Township of Oley & County of Philadelphia) is called the Township of Exeter in the County of Berks: It was called Exeter, because they came from a Place near the City of Exeter. And,\n\nHe the said George Boone the Third, died on the Sixth Day of the Week, near 8 o'clock in the Morning, on the 27th of July 1744, aged 78 Years; and Mary his Wife died on the 2d Day of the Week, on the 2d of February 1740‑1, aged 72 years; and were decently interred in Friends Burying‑Ground, in the said Township of Exeter. When he died, he left 8 Children, 52 Grand‑Children, and 10 Great‑Grand­-Children, Living; in all 70, being as many Persons as the House of Jacob which came into Egypt.\n\nGEORGE BOONE, IV. (the eldest Son of George & Mary Boone) was born in the Town of Bradninch aforesaid, on the 13th of July 1690, about 2 H. past 5 in the Afternoon; and died in Exeter Township aforesaid, on the 20 November 1753; in the 64th Year of his Age. He taught School for several Years near Philadelphia; was a good Mathematician, and taught the Several Branches of English Learning; aid was a Magistrate for several Years. His wife's maiden Name was Deborah Howell. ‑‑She died in 1759 January 26.­--\n\nGEORGE BOONE V.

D. 1699: She was the Wife of John Webb, and departed this Life the 16th of January 1774, in the 75th Year of her Age; her Husband died in the same Year, October 18th, in the 80th Year of his Age.--\n\nJOSEPH BOONE (Son of George & Mary Boone) was born between 4 & 5 in the Afternoon, on the 5th of April 1704; and be departed this Life on the 30 January, 1776, in the 72d Year of his Age.

Susanna Boone (his Widow) died on the 5 Nov. 1784, in the 76th Year of her Age.\n\nSAMUEL BOONE (the youngest Son of George & Mary Boone) departed this Life on the 6th of August 1745, and was buried at Exeter the next Day; aged about 34 Years.--­\n\nJAMES BOONE, Senr, (the Sixth Son of George & Mary Boone) was born in the Town of Bradninch, in Devonshire, in Old‑England, about ½ Hour past 2 in the Morning, on the 7th of July (Old‑Stile), or the 18th of July (New‑Stile), Anno Domini 1709. And in 1735 May 15, (0. S.) he married Mary Foulke by whom he had fourteen Children, and Nine of them lived to be Men & Women, namely, Anne, Mary, Martha, James, John, Judah, Joshua, Rachel, & Moses.

And in 1757 October 20, he married Anne Griffith, being just 20 Months after the Decease of his former Wife.‑And here, for the Satisfaction of the Curious, I shall insert a few Chronological Remarks, viz.--­\n\nThe said Mary Boone deceased in 1756 Feb. 20, at 20 Minutes past one in the Afternoon, which wanted but two Minutes & Sixteen Seconds of 20 o'Clock according to the Italian Manner of Reckoning (for the Italians, Jews, & some others, always begin their Day at Sun‑Set); which was the 20th Day of the Zenith Month ADAR, when the Moon was 20 Days old, and 4 Weeks before the Vernal Equinox.‑-The Said James Boone, Senior, married Anne Griffith in 1757 October 20, at 20 Minutes past one in the Afternoon; that is, he was married to his Second (or last) Wife exactly 20 Months after the Decease of his first, and 4 Weeks after the Autumnal Equinox.--\n\nJAMES BOONE, Senior, departed this Life on the 1st Day of September, A. D. 1785, on the Fifth Day of the Week, at ten Minutes after nine o'Clock at Night, in the 77th Year of his Age; and was decently interred in Friends Burying‑Ground at Exeter on the Seventh Day of the Same Week. He (with his Parents, etc.) left Great‑Britain in the 9th Year of his Age, and lived ALMOST 68 Years in Pennsylvania.--\n\nN. B.

He lived only 5 Weeks and 4 Days after the Decease of his Brother James.‑N.B. All of our Relations of the Name of Boone, who were living after 1785 October 10, are American born, as far as we know.\n\nNow, I shall conclude this Paper, after I have set down the Time & Place of my own Nativity, viz.--­\n\nI James Boone (the eldest Son of James Boone, Senior, & Mary his Wife) was born in the Township of Exeter aforesaid, on the Fifth Day of the Week, about five o'clock in the Morning, on the 26th Day of January 1743‑4, Old‑Stile, or A.
