The photo above used to be the home of John W. “Blind” Boone. The home built in 1890 is now owned by the City of Columbia, Missouri. At one time, it was also the Stuart P. Parker Funeral Home. In 1980, the home became listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nJohn W. “Blind” Boone\n\nJohn Boone (also called “Willy”) used to be a famous ragtime musician who was marketed as “Blind Boone.”\n\nBoone was the son of a slave. Despite the fact he was blinded as an infant, he grew into a popular pianist. He lived in Columbia where he was loved.\n\nBoone was born in 1864 near Miami, Missouri, and grew up in Warrensburg. He had a surgical procedure performed when he was six months old to remove his eyes due to brain fever (cerebral meningitis) causing swelling in his brain. Interestingly, today, the condition would be treated with antibiotics."
