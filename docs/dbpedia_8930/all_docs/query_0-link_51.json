        "text": "Hello S. Sherman….”Our Boone Families-Daniel Boone’s Kinfolks” was compiled\n\nand published by Sarah Ridge Rockenfield in 1987. Since then she and her husband have\n\npassed away and the publisher, Whipporwill Publications of Evansville, IN requires a large\n\nminimun pre-paid order before they will re-print the book. The book is about 1,000 pages,\n\nso it’s not likely to be re-printed anytime soon.Both Rockenfield and Spraker’s books have her listed as Sarah Boone, and doesn’t mention\n\nthe middle name Cassandra. Has that been documented and can you cite it?\n\nThanks, Dell Boone Ariola\n\nVP-The Boone Society\n\nMore Boone cousins surface in Texas !I recently found out, following my father, Joe Edd Gillespie’s, death in March 2004, that\n\nwe are connected.\n\nThis line goes from\n\nDaniel and Rebecca (Bryan) Boone, through Nathan And Olive (Van Bibber) Boone, to Jemima\n\n(Boone) and Henry Zumwalt, through Melcena (Zumwalt) and James H. Loyd, to Nancy Ann\n\nElizabeth (Loyd) and William Alexander Chowning, to James William and Louise Clementine\n\n(Nichols) Chowning, to Essie Marie (Chownng) and Herbert Porterfield Gillespie, to Joe Edd\n\nand Hallie (White) Gillespie, to me, Danny J. Gillespie, and brothers, Kenney L., Perry\n\nD., Tony J., to my son Bo Garner Gillespie, his cousins and their children.\n\nWill be joining the Society soon and would love to hear from others in the line.\n\nA ‘new’ Boone,\n\nDanny Gillespie\n\nI am interested in information on the James Boone massacre in South West Virginia. One\n\nof James’ companions was a boy named Samuel Drake.I have scanned images of newspaper articles from the time and two depositions from the\n\nThomas Gage collection. Those can be seen at:\n\nhttp://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~drakerobinson\n\nFrom the main menu, follow Family History then Other Related Articles and Documents.\n\nI believe there was a newspaper article from Wilmington NC I would love to see. I have\n\nalso heard that Daniel Boone wrote a narrative concerning his son’s death. Does anyone\n\nknow where I can find that.\n\nThanks\n\nDon Drake\n\nI am a descendant of Daniel Boone. His brother, Israel (who married a Seneca woman) had\n\na son named Allen who married Ann Hardy and had a daughter, Martha, who married Thomas\n\nKemble Edgemon of Athens, TN. Thomas and Martha were my great-grandparents. Their daughter\n\nNancy Anne (my grandmother) married Zacariah Watson (of England) in Athens, TN. and one of\n\ntheir daughters, Nona Watson Bradfield, was my mother. My mother was a member of the Boone\n\nHistorical Society which is at Daniel’s childhood home here in PA.There is a plethora of Boone genaology facts to be found at the annual Edgemon reunion in\n\nAthens,TN on the third weekend of August. If you’re interested, let me know. Also, will be\n\nhappy to join the Boone Society.\n\nNancy Bradfield Aigeldinger\n\nSorry to post again, but I just traced the lineage back to Daniel Boone and I am his\n\n9th great grandaughter by way of:Daniel Boone (10/22/1734) married Rebecca Bryan August 1756\n\nchild: Levina Boone (3/23/1766) married Joseph Scholl 1785\n\nchild: Joseph Scholl Jr. (6/15/1800) married Eliza Ann Broughton\n\nchild: Levina Boone Scholl (1/24/1841) married James T. Hults\n\nchild: Minnie W. Hults (9/2/1869) married Hiram A. Frank\n\nchild: Howard Boone Frank (1/10/1896) married Myrel McCune\n\nchild: Betty Lou Frank (12/22/1920) married Clifford W. Barrett\n\nchild: Kathy Lyn Barrett (7/16/1947) married David A. Lee\n\nchild: Aspen Lee (1/11/1972)\n\nI am very happy to have found this website so that I can learn more about my family\n\nhistory.\n\nSearching for roots would be a lot easier for the decendents of George & Mary if\n\ntheir ancestors had fewer children and had been more creative in naming them instead of\n\nrepeating the names of George & Mary’s children for the next umpteen generations !!In my case, the search took about 15 minutes to take it back to George & Mary. My\n\nGrandfather was in the Hazel Spraker book and it was all traced back from him. I am\n\ndecended from George & Mary’s youngest son, Samuel. Samuel I – Samuel II – George\n\nWashington Boone – Robert G. Boone – Robert M. Boone – Robert M. Boone II – John Boone\n\n(me). While our branch are not direct descendents of Daniel, there is a close connection\n\nbecause Daniel’s brother Squire was apprenticed to his cousin, Samuel II who was a\n\nmunitions manufacturer during the revolutionary war. After the war Samuel’s family\n\ntraveled with Daniel and Squire to Kentuckey and Indiana.\n\nI would like to hear from any other decendents of Samuel I.\n\nGreetings.My name is H. Danie Boone. I was born in Greene County Pa.9-20-53. I Descend from the\n\nfollowing, all residents of Greensboro, Pa. William Boone, born in Greensboro Pa. approx\n\n1799, married Sarah Rumble born approx 1825. They had 11 chlidren including – Joseph\n\nBoone, born 1855 he married Susan Longstreth in 1876. Their children were, William Lloyd,\n\n1877, George Fleming Boone 1879, Frankilin Lemoin Boone,1881, Daniel Garrison, 1883, and\n\nothers ending with Lawrence Crawford Boone born in 1901. Lawrence fathered Herman L. Boone\n\nmy father. I cannot find anything about my lineage before William 1799.Greensboro was an\n\nimportant town in the early 1800’s, is well documented in history and was visited by\n\nDaniel Boone himself. I am searching for any connection, which I belive there is, to the\n\npioneer Daniel Boone. I’ve been told by the elders of my family that one of Daniel’s\n\nbrothers is is my many great great ect.ect. grandfather, but speculation just isnt enough\n\nanymore. Any help you can give me would be appreciated. I would also be willing to supply\n\nother names of people that fall in line with this lineage.\n\nThank you,\n\nHerman Daniel Boone\n\nStrongsville, Oh. 44136\n\ne mail flifsher@aol.com\n\nHi, I’ll try to respond to a few of the latest posts all at once…..Edmon: We would love to have your wife’s lineage back to Joe J. Boone, born in 1874 NC, if\n\npossible. I don’t have anything in my database for him with only that information, but\n\nwith a few more facts, I may be able to find something. We can also put a query in the\n\nnext issue of The Compass Newsletter, if you wish.\n\nSherry: Hopefully, someone will have some information on your line and we would be more\n\nthan happy to put your query in the next issue of The Compass, too.\n\nEarle: If you can send me as many Boone ancestors as you have documented, I’ll check into\n\nmy source books and database to see if I have any of them listed.\n\nAlso, we have a Boone DNA Testing Project that is on-going. If you’d like to check out the\n\nwebsite at http://members.tripod.com/dellariola you’ll see what great progress we’re\n\nmaking. We already have several different Boone lines ‘established’, and it’s possible\n\nthat your Y-DNA might match up with one of those. The Boone DNA project tests the\n\nY-chromosome of the males. Since only males have the y-chromosome, this project is open\n\nonly to males with the surname Boon/e, Bohun, de Boon, LaBoone, Bohn and variant\n\nspellings.\n\nThanks, Dell"
