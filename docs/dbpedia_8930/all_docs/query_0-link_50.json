        "text": "Please join the library and the Missouri State Museum to learn about some of Missouri’s most significant trailblazers in this monthly series of programs in honor of Missouri's bicentennial. What is a trailblazer, you might ask? A trailblazer is someone who has impacted our culture through major events, leadership, innovation and more! Today's program will highlight John William “Blind” Boone and Carl Schurz: same trail, different blazers.\n\nJ.W. Blind Boone was a popular and successful Black musician and composer in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The German-born Carl Christian Schurz was a Union general in the Civil War, a reporter and a politician. Both struggled with oppression but were spirit-filled and challenged all people to live their lives to the fullest. In this program, we'll explore their lives with pictures, songs and stories.\n\nAll ages. Please register to receive a Zoom link.\n\nIf you miss the live event, you can watch the recorded event later; check www.dbrl.org/events for the link."
