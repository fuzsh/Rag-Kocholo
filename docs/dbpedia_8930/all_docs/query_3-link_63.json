        "text": "William and Susanna (Parks) Boone\n\nWilliam Boone was born in Pennsylvania, a son of William Boone and Sarah Lincoln. He and his brother George Boone were among the early settlers of Western Maryland. They received a grant of land and founded the town of Boonsboro, where William and his wife Susanna lived and raised their family. William died in 1798 without leaving a will, but two court documents about the estate have been found and published.\n\nSpraker shows that William and Susanna had five children. But these two court documents indicate that there was a sixth child, Joseph, not mentioned in Spraker. These documents strongly indicate that Joseph was their son, so I've included him in the family group sheet below.\n\nThe group sheet contains footnotes showing the source of the information about this family. I've also included some other data from Quaker meetings, local histories, the 1790 Census, and land transactions.\n\n7-Jan-2001 Family Group Sheet Husband: William Boone died at age: 43 Born: Abt 1755 in: 1 Died: 1798 in: Boonsboro, Washington County, Maryland 2 Buried: in: Boonsboro, Washington County, Maryland 3 Father: William Boone Mother: Sarah Lincoln Wife: Susanna H.

The documents contain the printed heading Land Records II 30, with page numbers 468 and 469 written in by hand.\n\nHistories\n\nThe most important town in the Boonsboro District is Boonsboro, which is situated near the west base of the South Mountains, on the Frederick and Hagerstown or old National pike, eight miles from Hagerstown and sixteen miles from Frederick. The site of the town was originally owned by William and George Boone, who are supposed to have been members of Daniel Boone's family. A tradition of the section has it that Daniel Boone, the Kentucky pioneer, was originally from this portion of the State, and emigrated to Kentucky, as did the Shelbys, one of whom was the first Governor of that State; the Hart family, into which Henry Clay married; and hundreds of other hardy Western Maryland people who opened up the wilds of the Blue Grass State during the latter part of the eighteenth century. Boonsboro was originally a part of two tracts called Beall's Chance and Fellowship, and was first called Margaretsville, in honor of the wife of George Boone.\n\nWm. Boone resided here during his lifetime. He died in 1798 and was buried in the Salem, afterwards Trinity, Reformed Church graveyard. George Boone died in Reading, where he lived for many years. His house stood until the year 1800 in the rear of Salem church. Susannah Boone, wife of Wm. Boone, died in 1844, at the age of eighty-eight years.\n\n--from History of Western Maryland by John Thomas Scharf, p 1261.\n\nIt is somewhat remarkable that Boonsboro was not settled earlier than it was, for it is a beautiful and attractive situation, and it is likely that most of the settlers from the eastern part of the State came to the valley through the gap, where the National road now passes. Here, at the foot of the mountain, Boonsboro lies. The land upon which the town is situated and that all around it, was granted to George and William Boone in about 1774. These men lived in Berks County, Pa. The latter came to his property in Maryland and resided there until his death in 1798. He and his wife are both buried in the Reformed Churchyard in the village. His wife, Susanna, survived him forty-six years, dying in 1844 at the age of eighty- eight years. The daughter of this couple, Sarah Boone, died at Keedysville in September 1874. The town did not grow rapidly. In 1796 there were only five houses and in 1829, Henry Nyman and Betebanner bought the Boone property, and laid out the town in lots. At that time there were only twenty-nine houses in the place.\n\n--from A History of Washington County, Maryland by Thomas J. C. Williams, p 26.\n\nSee also: Isaiah Boone of Montgomery County, MD &nbsp My Boone Page&nbsp Contents: Boone\n\nThis file was last updated on 7/15/2004."
