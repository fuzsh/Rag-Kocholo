John Boone was born in 1599 in London, , Greater London, England, was christened on 10 Jun 1599 in St. Margaret Pattens Parish, London, , Greater London, England, and died before 1660 in Charles City County, Virginia.\n\nNoted events in his life were:\n\n• Information: 1599, London, , Greater London, England. John was the son of mariner John Boone of London, and his is the lone record proving the surname Boone recorded therein. John was orphaned when aged 12, and apparently he was the only surviving child of his parents. We could not prove his mother, and have no idea whatsoever about the origin of his parents or ancestors; however, it is likely his father was of Bedfordshire or Yorkshire. The DNA of this Boone family line does not match the South Carolina or Pennsylvania Boone immigrant families. John was apprenticed and certified as Mate, Master and Ship Captain. His certification as Master was signed off by Capt. William Barker of London. He hired out to William Barker and Associates of Charles City County Virginia, London, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Brugge and Brussels. He was certified as Mate when he married Anna Curtis in London, and obtained his Master and Ship Captain certification May 1625. You will not prove any land records for this John Boone for he lived in the Barker and Associates mariner compound in Charles City County.\n\nJohn married Anna Curtis on 25 Apr 1622 in St. Margaret Pattens Parish, London, , Greater London, England. Anna was born in 1604 in London, , Greater London, England, was christened on 10 Mar 1604 in St. Andrew Parish, Enfield, , Greater London, England, and died in 1663 in Charles City County, Virginia at age 59.\n\nNoted events in her life were:\n\n• Information: 1604, London, , Greater London, England. Anna was the daughter of mariner Robert Curtis of London, Rotterdam and Amsterdam, Brugge and Brussels. Her father gave consent to her marriage. We could not prove her mother.\n\nChildren from this marriage were:\n\nSecond Generation (Children)\n\n2. Capt. George Boone (John (Capt.) 1) was born in 1623 in Rotterdam, , Zuid-Holland, Netherlands, was christened on 22 Apr 1623 in Old Flemish Parish Lion Street, Rotterdam, , Zuid-Holland, Netherlands, and died in 1658 at Sea at age 35.\n\nNoted events in his life were:\n\n• He immigrated in 1652 to Virginia. Thomas Todd claimed the head right of George Boone used to obtain a patent of 150 acres in Gloucester County Virginia October 27, 1652.\n\nCavaliers & Pioneers, Vol., I, pg 174\n\n3. Capt. Christopher Boone (John (Capt.) 1) was born in 1624 in Rotterdam, , Zuid-Holland, Netherlands, was christened on 3 May 1624 in Old Flemish Parish Lion Street, Rotterdam, , Zuid-Holland, Netherlands, and died before 1668 in Charles City County, Virginia.\n\nNoted events in his life were:\n\n• He immigrated in 1653 to Virginia. William Debnam claimed the head right of Christopher Boone used to obtain a patent of 1500 acres in Gloucester County Virginia December 26, 1653.\n\nCavaliers & Pioneers, Vol., I, pg 250\n\n------------------\n\nResearch Note:\n\n------------------\n\nThe land patent obtained by William Debnam was located on Mobjack Bay, which was used by many mariner families beginning very early in Virginia History - The area where the patent was issued later become Mathews County, which was the favored place for mariner families to live throughout the 1800s.\n\nChristopher married Mary Ratcliffe on 18 Feb 1646 in Dutch Reformed Church, Amsterdam, , Noord-Holland, Netherlands. Mary was born in 1627 in Exeter, , Devonshire, England, was christened on 30 Sep 1627 in St. Petrock Parish, Exeter, , Devonshire, England, and died in 1670 in Charles City County, Virginia at age 43.\n\nNoted events in their marriage were:\n\n• Marriage: 18 Feb 1646, Amsterdam, , Noord-Holland, Netherlands. zeeman Christohper gehuwde Boone van leeftijd 23 van Rotterdam, 18 Februari, leeftijd 19 van 1646 meisje Mary Radcliffe van de dochter van Engeland van schip kapitein Jaspis Ratcliffe die zijn toestemming bij Nederlandse Opnieuw gevormde Kerk, Amsterdam, Noord-Holland, Nederland gaf\n\nNoted events in her life were:\n\n• Information: 1627, Exeter, , Devonshire, England. Mary was the daughter of mariner Jasper Ratcliffe, we could not prove her mother, or her father’s christening record. There is good reason to believe this paricular Ratcliffe family originated in Yorkshire or Lancashire before 1500, as those are the two conventional seats of the English Ratcliffe family.\n\n• She immigrated in 1653 to Virginia. William Thomas claimed the head right of Mary Boone used to obtain a patent of 400 acres in Northumberland County Virginia October 19, 1653. William Thomas was a mariner....\n\nChildren from this marriage were:\n\n4. Capt. William Boone (John (Capt.) 1) was born in 1626 in Rotterdam, , Zuid-Holland, Netherlands, was christened on 29 Sep 1626 in Old Flemish Parish Lion Street, Rotterdam, , Zuid-Holland, Netherlands, and died in 1691 in Rotterdam, , Zuid-Holland, Netherlands at age 65.\n\nNoted events in his life were:\n\n• Information: 1626, Rotterdam, , Zuid-Holland, Netherlands. William was apprenticed to mariner Capt. John Smith and was certified as Mate, Master and Ship Captain. Captain Henry Barker of Charles City Virginia of Barker and Associates signed his Masters Certification in June 1652. His apprentice master was Capt. John Smith who signed the first part of his certificate in 1651 - After William married he removed to Rotterdam where he was affiliated with the Washington brothers, George and Thomas.\n\n• He immigrated in 1642 to Virginia. Capt. John Smith claimed the head right of William Boone used for a land patent in Gloucester County Virginia June 16, 1642 - At the time the patent was issued mariner Capt. John Smith was apprentice master of William Boone then age 18 years. Gloucester County Virginia was always a favored place for mariner families to settle, especially on Mobjack Bay.\n\nCavaliers & Pioneers Vol., I, pg 134\n\nWilliam married Susan Cooke on 5 Jul 1652 in Widecombe in the Moor, , Devonshire, England. Susan was born in 1628 in Widecombe in the Moor, , Devonshire, England and died after 1700 in Rotterdam, , Zuid-Holland, Netherlands.\n\nNoted events in her life were:\n\n• Information: 1628, Widecombe in the Moor, , Devonshire, England. We could not prove Susan’s parents. She was a spinster aged 22 when she married William Boone.\n\n5. Capt. James Boone (John (Capt.) l) was born in 1631 in Leiden,, Zuid-Holland, Netherlands and died after 1700 in Leiden, , Zuid-Holland, Netherlands.\n\nNoted events in his life were:\n\n• Information: 1631, Leiden, , Zuid-Holland, Netherlands. James was not born in Rotterdam or Amsterdam, or he was not christened; however, his mariner certification proved him born in the Netherlands, and his age. His Mate, Master and Ship Captain certification was signed Mobjack Bay (Gloucester County) in Virginia June 1657 age 26 years by mariner Capt. Mathew Morgan. James was hired out to Barker & Associates of Charles City County Virginia, and managed shipping and warehousing on the Eastern Shore of Accomack County Virginia. It is known that he and Elizabeth left several descendants in Virginia, but we have no records to prove their names, how many there were, or what happened to them.\n\n• He immigrated in 1666 to Virginia. John Prettyman claimed James’ head right used for a land patent in Accomack County Virginia dated April 5, 1666.\n\nCavaliers & Pioneers Vol., I, pg 552\n\n• Proof: 17 Jul 1671-31 Jul 1671, Accomack County, Virginia.

The following apprenticed in Bristol: John Andrews to Peter Perkes, 7 years Virginia by Society; John Norrish to James Boone, 4 years Virginia by Trial. (BR).\n\n----------------\n\nResearch Note:\n\nThe above two indentured persons landed in Virginia aboard the Trial in late August 1671. They signed up for Virginia indenture at Bristol in Gloucestershire.\n\nJames married Elizabeth Driver on 16 Jan 1658 in St. Dunstan Parish, Stepney, , Middlesex, England. Elizabeth was born in 1637 in Stepney, , Middlesex, England, was christened on 22 Mar 1637 in St. Mary Whitechapel, Stepney, , Middlesex, England, and died in 1704 in Leiden, , Zuid-Holland, Netherlands at age 67.\n\nNoted events in her life were:\n\n• Information: 1637, Stepney, , Middlesex, England. Elizabeth was the daughter of Scottish mariner Alexander Driver and his wife, Alice - We could not prove her mother’s maiden name or her parents marriage.

Thomas was apprenticed and certified as Mate by Capt. Henry Barker of Charles City County Virginia in April 1668.
