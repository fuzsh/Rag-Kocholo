        "text": "Information\n\nJohn “Will” Vawter was born in Boone County, Virginia, and came with his family to Greenfield, in Hancock County, Indiana, at age 6. He started his career as a cartoonist and illustrator; later he painted landscapes as well. He completed many illustrations for his friend, the Hoosier poet James Whitcomb Riley. Vawter’s sketches appeared often in the weekly issues of Life Magazine.\n\nAccording to the Indianapolis Star, “From the time his hands were able to hold a pencil, he showed a marked talent for drawing; his mother encouraged his artistic tendencies, and neighbors of the Vawters in the old days have innumerable anecdotes to tell both of the rapidly developing artistic talents of young Will, such as the numerous times when, setting up his easel in the Vawter parlor, he absentmindedly wiped his paint brushes on the parlor curtains and the plush upholstery of the furniture. His first paints were the leftover colors he begged from the local house painters.”\n\nVawter moved to Nashville in 1904 and joined Steele and others in the Brown County Art Colony.\n\nScene of an Alley, n.d.\n\n30 1/2″ x 36 1/2″\n\nArt Museum of Greater Lafayette\n\nKeywords: paintings, urban landscapes, oil on canvas\n\nSubjects: outdoors, streets, houses, fences, trees\n\nThis painterly composition presents a winter day. Notice how the sky colors enhance the feeling of the season. The application of the paint embellishes the straight lines of the frame constructions. The car tracks indicate that there has been movement in the area, although the present scene is quite still.\n\nSome Points to Consider"
