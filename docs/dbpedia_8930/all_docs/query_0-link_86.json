Susan Jane was born in Dec. 1863 after her father was killed by Union soldiers.\n\nThere is a family story that he was killed on the front porch of their home, The Union soldiers rode down the dirt road, jumped the split rail fence and shot him where he stood.[Lived on what is now the Bob Payne Place].\n\nAnother family story,[ from a Tate cousin] is: Richard Calvin Tate was at/ on the banks of a small stream, near his home, when a boat with union soldiers came along, shot him and then asked questions. It turns ouit that the Union soldier that shot him was a relative from Virginia who had joined the union army. This relative went to the house, told them that he was shot, the family went after him and he lived for another day or two.\n\nHe was supposede to have fught in Civil War, and lost a hand to any injury.\n\nNo documentation to any of this, except that he was killed in 1863.\n\nHe evidently was buried at Mt. Horeb Cemetary although a letter from Maude Tate Boone indicated that her brother, Leslie Tae said their father, Charley Tate thought he was buried in the Tate Graveyard on the Jesse Northern Tate farm. HE told her that their father said that was where the Tates were buried before they opened the graveyard at Mt. Horeb Church. The farm is south of Williamsburg about three miles and grown over. Mt.

She was united in marriage to James E. Kettle Feb. 20, 1873. To this union were born seven children, as follows: Eugene, Edward, Elmer C., who preceded her to the great beyond several years ago, Mrs. Lottie E. SAilor, Miss Anna Belle Kettle, Mrs. Delia Onie Ward, and John Ernest. Her husband died fifteen years ago last December. At the age of fifteen she professed in Christ and united with Mt. Horeb Church Baptist Church, since that time she has lived a consistant and devoted Chritian. She ever maintained profund faith in her Lord and Savior. Her affliction was that malignant disease cancer, which was on the nose several years ago. She has suffered untold misery, especially for the last two years or more. She prayed the Lord to come remove her from her suffering, yet she was submissive to His will. She was of a cheerful spirit during all her days of affiction. She bore it all with meekness and fortitude. Her faith in God was unusually strong. While she will be sadly missed in the home, it is a consolation to have the evidence that her suffering is ended and she is happy with her Savior and the redemmed, She is not dead, but has just entered the happiness of the real or spiritual life. Her son Eugene, and her daughter, Miss Anna Belle, have been with her in the home since the death of her husband. They were faithful and loving hands could do in administering to her wants and sufferings, and her other children did what they could. She is also survived by three brotyhers and one sister. After services, conducted by the writer, at New Providence Church, near the home, the remains were laid to rest by that of her husband, where they will remain till by the power of Christ they shall rise to assume his glorified body and dwell with him forever.\n\nR.W.

Kettle was born in Rising Sun, Indiana June 29, 1848 and died at his home seven miles west of Montgomery after a long and painful illness of stomach trouble, Dec. 27, 1913, qged sixty five years and six months. At the age of nine years Mr. Kettle came with his parents to this country, settling southwest of Mineola, in Callaway County where he grew to manhood. On Feb. 20th, 1873, he was married to Miss Susan Boone with whom he lived happily until the close of his life. To this union were born, four boys and three daughters, all of whom are still living.\n\nA number of years ago, Brother Kettle made a public confession of religion, united with Mt. Horeb Church and was baptised by Rev. R. E. McQuie, ever after living a consistent, upright Christian life. He was truly a kind, good citizen, a very loving, devoted husband and father. He dearly loved his home and family. He meekly bore his intense suffering and when the end came sweetly fell asleep in Jesus.\n\nHis funeral, in accordance with his request was preached by Rev. R.E. McQuie at New Providence Church Tuesday afternoon, Dec. 30th, at 2 o'clock in the presence of a number of neighbors, friends and relatives, after which his remains were laid to rest in the adjoining cemetary. He leaves a lonely companion, seven children, three brothers, two sisters, and many friends and relatives who will sadly miss his gentle voice and smiling face.
