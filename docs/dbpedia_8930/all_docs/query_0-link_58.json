        "text": "Among the prominent and widely known representatives of the Presbyterian ministry in Idaho is Rev. William J. Boone, of Caldwell, who though not filling a pastorate at the present time, has done most active and efficient work in the promotion of the church and in the upholding of all those agencies which make for intellectual and moral progress. Dr. Boone was born at Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. November 5, 1860, and is a descendant from the same ancestral stock that produced Daniel Boone, the famous American explorer. His father, James Boone, a native of Washington county, Pennsylvania, was born in 1833, and died March 21, 1919, in his eighty-sixth year on the old homestead in Cecil township, that county, where for many years he served as squire. He married Nancy Craighead, who was a daughter of George Craighead and was of Scotch lineage. She passed away in 1868, at the comparatively early age of thirty-three years, leaving two sons: Dr. Boone, of this review; and George Boone, who occupies the old home place with his father. The Craighead family in America was founded by Colonel George Craighead, of Revolutionary war fame, who settled in Delaware, whence his descendants removed to Pennsylvania.\n\nDr. Boone pursued his early education in the schools of Charters and Cecil townships in Washington county, Pennsylvania, and afterward took an academic course in Indiana county, Pennsylvania, being graduated from the Eldersridge Academy with the class of 1880. He afterward entered the University of Wooster at Wooster, Ohio, and completed a four years' course in 1884, at which time the Bachelor of Arts degree was conferred upon him. In 1887 his alma mater conferred upon him the Master's degree and in the same year he was graduated from the Western Theological Seminary at Pittsburgh. In 1903 the University of Wooster conferred upon him the degree of Doctor of Divinity.\n\nIn the fall of 1887 Dr. Boone came to Idaho and entered upon his first charge as a Presbyterian minister, filling that pastorate for four years. He then assumed his duties in connection with the College of Idaho at Caldwell and, although no longer active in the ministry, he has by no means ceased his efficient efforts for the church and the noble ends which it seeks to accomplish. He became one of the founders and organizers of the College of Idaho and for years has been its president. He gave up the ministry after realizing the need in the young commonwealth for more and better educational facilities. His administration of college affairs has been most efficient, resulting in a substantial growth of the institution. The present buildings and campus are valued at one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars and in the year 1919 the college property was further increased by the erection of a gymnasium and a science building and the campus was also improved. The school has an endowment fund of three hundred thousand dollars, which has been secured through a gift of fifty thousand dollars from John D. Rockefeller, twenty-five thousand dollars from Andrew Carnegie and the remainder from the people of the state of Idaho and from eastern contributors. The major portion of this fund is invested in Idaho and in southern Oregon. As president Dr. Boone keeps a watchful eye over every interest and activity of the school. That he possesses executive ability is manifest in his administrative direction. That his standards of instruction are most high is indicated in the improvements which he is continually introducing; and he has made the College of Idaho at Caldwell one of the valuable institutions of higher learning in the state.\n\nOn the 1st of November, 1887, Dr. Boone was married to Miss Annie E. Janison, a daughter of Thomas Janison of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and they have become the parents of four children: Marie, who was born at Caldwell, January 31, 1889, and died June 30, 1911; James L., who was born December 11, 1891, and is now engaged in the practice of law; Sarah; and Margaret. Dr. Boone belongs to the Phi Delta Theta, a college fraternity, and also to the Masonic order, proving a most worthy follower of the craft. He likewise has connection with the Caldwell Commercial Club and is interested in every project put forth by that organization for the benefit and upbuilding of the city. Throughout his life ^e has turned his advantages to excellent account, not only for the benefit of his own interests but for the welfare and progress of his fellowmen. The universality of his friendships interprets for us his intellectual hospitality and the breadth of his sympathy, for nothing is foreign to him that concerns his fellows. His work is indeed constituting a most valuable contribution to Idaho and one is reminded of the words of a modern statesman: \"Not the good that comes to us, but the good that comes to the world through us, is the measure of our success.\""
