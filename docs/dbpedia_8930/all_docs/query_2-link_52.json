        "text": "Unbound. Small broadsheet handbill. 6.75\" x 4\". Illustrated text, printed on both sides with ornamental border. Lightly foxed, small tears in the margins, very good. Rare documentation of a Missouri-born ragtime music pioneer. The front is a steel engraving of Boone's visage followed by a list of fifteen concert selections, including six compositions or arrangements by Boone. The verso has what may be the earliest printed biographical information on Boone, and a list of the all-African-American company members. Boone was born in 1863 in a Federal Camp where his contraband mother cooked for Union soldiers. He was recognized as a musical prodigy and started touring in 1880 (from whence this handbill almost certainly dates â€“ some of the company members listed on this handbill left soon afterwards). He engaged in musical competitions, including with the celebrated Blind Tom, published his own compositions, and left behind a number of piano rolls that display in early form the eccentric and ragged rhythms that later became the hallmark of ragtime. Boone died in 1927, largely forgotten and eclipsed by the more fully developed ragtime music of Joplin, Lamb, and Scott. His musical career was largely limited to the Midwest, and contemporary material relating to it is rare.\n\nItem #340973"
