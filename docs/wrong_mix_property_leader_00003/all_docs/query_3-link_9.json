        "text": "July, known as one of the hottest months of the year, offers us both enjoyment and a stark reminder of the prominence of climate change. The long-term alteration of Earth’s climate system, primarily driven by human activities, has led to rising temperatures and a host of detrimental effects, including extreme weather events, biodiversity loss, and social inequalities. Recognizing the importance of discussing climate change is vital, as it serves as a catalyst for protecting the environment, safeguarding public health, unlocking economic opportunities, and fulfilling our moral responsibility to future generations.\n\nIn the spirit of acknowledging the work that lies ahead, we are writing about Gro Harlem Brundtland, the first woman Prime Minister of Norway and former Director-General of the World Health Organization. As a medical doctor, Brundtland champions health as a human right and has emerged as a leading advocate for global pandemic preparedness. Her contributions have placed sustainable development firmly on the international agenda, earning her the well-deserved title of “mother of sustainable development”.\n\nFrom an early age, Brundtland’s upbringing was influenced by her parents, both of whom were a physician and a politician. Following her passion for medicine, she obtained her medical degree from the University of Oslo in 1963, and two years later, she earned a master’s degree in public health from Harvard. Subsequently, she served as a medical officer at the Norwegian Directorate of Health from 1966 to 1968 and as an assistant medical director to Oslo’s Board of Health from 1968 to 1974. During this period, she focused on public health initiatives for Oslo and educational institutions in the city. Despite her medical pursuits, Brundtland was also involved in politics from an early age and actively participated in the Norwegian Labour Movement since the age of seven. Her contributions to the movement proved instrumental, and she played a significant role in leading the Labour Party to electoral victories on multiple occasions.\n\nIn 1974, Brundtland was elected as Minister of the Environment under Prime Minister Trygve Brattelishe. She then secured a seat in the Norwegian parliament, the Storting, in 1977, and held this position until 1979. Shortly after assuming the role of Minister of the Environment, she became the deputy leader of the Labour Party and eventually led the party in 1981 following the resignation of the Labour prime minister.\n\nBrundtland made history when she became Norway’s youngest and first female prime minister. Her first term lasted nine months, and she went on to serve two more terms: from 1986 to 1989 and from 1990 to 1996. As the first female prime minister, Brundtland emphasized the importance of women’s voices and rights, advocating for their education and increased economic opportunities. Notably, she ensured that her cabinet included no fewer than eight women out of a total of 18 members.\n\n“Next time a woman becomes Party Leader or Prime Minister of Norway — maybe many years from now — she will not meet the same problems that I had. I have to tolerate, have to live with this uncomfortable atmosphere, because I am the first. It’s my duty to just tolerate it. Next time will be easier for another woman.”\n\n— Gro Harlem Brundtland in an interview for The Elders, taking place in Dublin, Ireland, in May 2013.\n\nIn 1983, Brundtland assumed the position of chair of the UN World Commission on Environment and Development. Her significant contributions included leading the creation of the influential 1987 report titled “Our Common Future,” which introduced the concept of “sustainable development” and laid the foundation for the first Earth Summit, also known as the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED).\n\nThis summit, held in 1992, brought together the largest gathering of world leaders at the time, aiming to facilitate international treaties and encourage nations to pursue economic development that prioritizes environmental protection. Brundtland’s commitment to global health led her to serve as the director-general of the World Health Organization from 1998 to 2003, where she played a vital role in combating global pandemics such as SARS and AIDS. In 2007, she joined “The Elders,” a group of world leaders and advocates for peace and human rights, actively engaging in efforts to address human rights challenges. From 2007 to 2010, Brundtland served as a special envoy on climate change, collaborating with the former foreign affairs minister of South Korea and the former president of Chile.\n\nTragically, Brundtland was the intended target of an assassination attempt on July 22, 2011. After delivering a speech to a youth camp organized by the Labour Party, she left the camp only hours before a gunman attacked, resulting in the loss of numerous lives and many injuries. The perpetrator confessed that his original plan was to assassinate Brundtland.\n\nBrundtland’s exceptional leadership and political background led to her being awarded the prestigious 1994 Charlemagne Prize in recognition of her outstanding contributions and service towards fostering European unification. Ultimately, Brundtland’s unwavering dedication has established her as a significant and inspirational figure in the fields of public health, sustainable development, and environmental progress as a whole.\n\n“There can be no real growth without healthy populations. No sustainable development without tackling disease and malnutrition. No international security without assisting crisis-ridden countries. And no hope for the spread of freedom, democracy, and human dignity unless we treat health as a basic human right.\n\n— Gro Harlem Brundtland at the 7th Conference of European Health Ministers, 2003\n\nGro Harlem Brundtland’s unwavering dedication to environmental sustainability, public health, and sustainable development has left an indelible mark on the global stage; her visionary leadership and advocacy have contributed to the acknowledgment of climate change as a pressing issue that demands urgent action. Brundtland’s legacy serves as a reminder that through passion, determination, and a commitment to the greater good, we can make significant strides toward a world that is both environmentally sound and socially just. As we draw inspiration from Brundtland’s work, let us each play our part in the collective effort to address climate change and foster a brighter, more sustainable future for all.\n\nSources:"
