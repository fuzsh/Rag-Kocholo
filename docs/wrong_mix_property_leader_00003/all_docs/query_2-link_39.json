        "text": "Published 03-25-09\n\nSubmitted by Aspen Institute\n\nAspen, CO. - March 25, 2009 - Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Special Envoy on Climate Change to the United Nations Secretary General and former Norwegian Prime Minister, has accepted an invitation to serve as a commissioner on the Aspen Institute's Dialogue and Commission on Arctic Climate Change. Announced today at the Aspen Environment Forum, Dr. Brundtland will join HSH Prince Albert II of Monaco, James Leape, Director General, WWF International, Marvin Odum, President, Shell Oil Company, and Inuit advocate Sheila Watt-Cloutier, as well as a number of other notable scientists, policy experts, and representatives from Arctic native peoples and environmental organizations. Until her recent appointment as Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Dr. Jane Lubchenco, who will speak at the Aspen Environment Forum on Thursday in her official capacity, was also a member of the Aspen Commission on Arctic Climate Change.\n\n\"The Arctic is among the world's first regions to experience dramatic ecological impacts due to climate change. Dr. Brundtland's stature and influence will help focus the world's attention on the Arctic at this critical stage in its history, and we are honored she will join us,\" said David Monsma, executive director of the Aspen Institute's Energy and Environment Program and the Commission.\n\nRecognizing that the circumpolar Arctic region is experiencing unprecedented change, the Aspen Institute in partnership with the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation convened a civil society Dialogue and Commission. The Commission is assessing the adequacy of current institutional arrangements and international governance policies to effectively and sustainably manage new levels of commercial and economic activities in the region. The Commission and its work groups will pay particular attention to the need for greater international cooperation in promoting conservation, sustainable development, and shared responsibility for the Arctic. The Commission will recommend governance principles and actions that can assist the region's inhabitants in meeting the challenges of climate change and help governments and organizations work cooperatively toward a sustainable future.\n\nDetailed information is available at: http://www.aspeninstitute.org/policy-work/energy-environment/our-policy-work/dialogue-commission-arctic-climate-change\n\nThe Aspen Institute mission is twofold: to foster values-based leadership, encouraging individuals to reflect on the ideals and ideas that define a good society, and to provide a neutral and balanced venue for discussing and acting on critical issues. The Aspen Institute does this primarily in four ways: seminars, young-leader fellowships around the globe, policy programs, and public conferences and events. The Institute is based in Washington, DC, Aspen, CO, and on the Wye River on Maryland's Eastern Shore and has an international network of partners.
