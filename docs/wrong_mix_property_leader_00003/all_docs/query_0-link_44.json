        "text": "Norway’s insistence on killing whales has finally unleashed the full\n\nforce of international disapproval – in the shape of threatened trade sanctions\n\nby the US. Ron Brown, the US Secretary of Commerce, has told President Bill\n\nClinton that Norway’s decision to resume commercial whaling this year undermines\n\nthe International Whaling Commission’s attempts to conserve whales. Under\n\nthe Pelly amendment, a provision of US fishing law, Clinton can impose sanctions\n\nagainst Norway for defying the terms of the IWC moratorium on whaling. He\n\nhas until early October to make a decision.\n\nArthur Knutsen of the Norwegian foreign ministry says the US has never\n\nfollowed through its previous threats to invoke the Pelly amendment. The\n\nfirst threat was made during the 1980s, when Norway decided to take whales\n\n‘for research’, also in defiance of the IWC. Last December, after Norway\n\ntook another 95 minke whales for scientific purposes, Clinton declined to\n\nact.\n\nBut this time the Pelly amendment is being invoked for a catch which\n\nNorway admits is commercial. The US was among the member countries of the\n\nIWC which signed a resolution in Kyoto earlier this year ‘regretting’ Norway’s\n\nannouncement that it would resume commercial whaling (This Week, 22 May).\n\nKnutsen says: ‘We are breaking no international law. The hunt is legal\n\neven within the IWC.’ Because Norway ‘reserved’ its position on the whaling\n\nban when it was voted on by the IWC in 1983, strictly speaking it does have\n\nthe right to ignore the ban. It set a commercial quota of 160 whales this\n\nyear, of which 158 have been taken. ‘We will catch the other two,’ says\n\nKnutsen. Norway plans to set a new quota for next year.\n\nNorway’s right to kill whales makes no difference to the US position.\n\nThe Pelly amendment targets any country that ‘diminishes the effectiveness\n\nof an inter-national conservation agreement’, even when it is acting within\n\nthe letter if not the spirit of the law. The sanctions can be applied to\n\nany product, but in whaling disputes they have been restricted to fish.\n\nIn the 1980s, the US banned imports of fish from Japan after Japan defied\n\nthe IWC moratorium.\n\nBut if the US limits its ban to fish imports, sanctions may have little\n\neffect. The US has already cut its imports of Norwegian fish because of\n\na dispute over Norway’s subsidies to the salmon industry – which the US\n\nsays contravene the terms of GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and\n\nTrade. In 1992 the US imported fish worth 378 million kroner ( $51.5 million),\n\na mere 2.6 per cent of Norway’s fish exports.\n\nSome Norwegian companies would be hurt by an American boycott, however.\n\nNorwegian Foods of Stavanger exports 60 per cent of its products – mostly\n\ncanned fish – to the US. It says its US subsidiary, King Oscar, has already\n\nlost business worth $7 million because of pressure from anti-whaling groups.\n\nThe company plans to sue the Norwegian Prime Minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland,\n\nin the American courts for damages caused by her pro-whaling policy.\n\nFish products account for 14 per cent of Norway’s exports, excluding\n\noil, says Knutsen, so threats of sanctions are ‘receiving attention’ in\n\nOslo. Most exports go to other European countries. John Frizell of Greenpeace\n\nsays British com-panies, which together buy nearly half of Norway’s exported\n\nprawns, have cancelled contracts worth $3.75 million, while German importers\n\nand retailers have cancelled contracts worth more than $30 million.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia announced last week that Norway cannot take whales\n\nfor ‘scientific’ purposes in its waters. Norway planned to catch 27 minke\n\nwhales off its own coast this autumn, plus 10 more off the Kola Peninsula,\n\nwhich juts out between the Barents and the White Seas."
