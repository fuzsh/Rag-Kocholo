        "text": "Values, Ethics and Sustainability\n\nIn 1983 the United Nations General Assembly, concerned at the deterioration of the human environment and natural resources established a World Commission on Environment and Development. The Commission was chaired by Gro Harlem Brundtland, the former Prime Minister of Norway, who was chosen for her strong background in the Sciences and Public Health. The Brundtland Commission officially dissolved in December 1987 after releasing its report “Our Common Future”, (also known as the Brundtland Report), which defined the meaning of \"Sustainable Development\" as being \"Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\".\n\nVixcroft applies this principal to its activities, seeking to develop and support urban environments that are successful in meeting the needs of the communities that they serve, minimising the need to travel by agglomerating commercial uses in locations supported by existing infrastructure and creating vibrant environments that people enjoy using.\n\nReal estate developments consume large amounts of energy and materials in their construction. It is therefore important that they are designed and implemented in such a way as to stand the test of time to communities, particularly in terms of public enjoyment.\n\nFollowing the collapse in world markets of 2008, many urban locations have been stressed and need incremental development, sensitively conceived to optimise both their economic potential and the social potential of the communities that they serve. Vixcroft is committed to delivering improvements that meet these sustainability objectives, and which support thriving local communities."
