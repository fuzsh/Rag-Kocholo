Mishti Sharma is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Scarlet Vas. She made her first appearance during the episode broadcast on 18 April 2017. The character was introduced alongside an extended branch of the show's long-standing Rebecchi family, who consist of Indian-Australians. The show's producer Jason Herbison thought their inclusion was important to better reflect Australian society. Actress Sharon Johal, who plays Mishti's sister Dipi Rebecchi, originally auditioned for the role of Mishti. When writers changed the character's age they hired Vas to play her instead. Vas made her final appearance as Mishti on 19 October 2018.

Mishti is characterised as having a strong passion for physical fitness and is family oriented. She often plays the role of peacemaker in her family when they argue. Vas has described Mishti as a "harsh" character who is "righteous about staying within the law." When Mishti arrives in Erinsborough she is keen to start a new life, suggesting she has a troubled past. She forms a business partnership with Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson) and opens a gym called The Shed. But viewers soon learn that Mishti is an ex-police officer who left the force following the death of her boyfriend Zander. Mishti's storylines have mainly focused on her relationship with Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano) and their many dramas. She also features in a pregnancy and miscarriage story. The character returns to the police force and begins investigating her neighbours who she believes are embroiled in the murder of Hamish Roche (Sean Taylor). Reaction to Mishti has been positive and Claire Crick from Soaplife branded her and Leo a "power couple".
