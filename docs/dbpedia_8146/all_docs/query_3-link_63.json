        "text": "Mishti Mukherjee’s untimely demise has shaken us all. The Hindi and Bengali film actress succumbed to renal failure, and health experts suggest that a particular diet followed by the late celebrity has contributed to her kidney damage.\n\nMishti started her acting career with Bengali movies and moved to work in the Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam film industry before making her Bollywood debut with Main Krishna Hoon in 2013. She also appeared in popular dance numbers and for her supporting role in the movie Life Ki Toh Lag Gayi. She passed away on Friday due to kidney failure and her extreme Keto diet is said to be the main reason for the dysfunction.\n\n“Actress Mishti Mukherjee who marked her brilliance in many films and music videos with her ace acting is no more. Due to the keto diet, her kidney failed in Bangalore and she breathed her last on Friday night, the actress suffered a lot of pain. Unforgettable and unfortunate loss. May her soul rest in peace. She is survived by her parents and brother,” read her official statement.\n\nWhat is keto diet\n\nKetogenic or keto diet, is a high-fat, adequate-protein and low-carbohydrate diet that is commonly known for promoting quick weight loss. The reduced consumption of carbs puts the body into a state of ‘Ketosis’ metabolic which makes the body more efficient in burning fats. However, extremely low intake of carbs for a prolonged period has long-term health risks and this is exactly what happened to Mishti.\n\nWhy keto diet is harmful for you\n\nDieticians and health experts suggest that Keto diet should not be followed for more than six months and should be broken down in intervals. When one follows this diet, the body starts adapting to the low-carb state and burns ketones for energy instead of glucose. This can cause headaches, weakness, irritability, constipation, and nausea and is often referred to as the ‘keto flu’.\n\nAccording to a report published in IANS, Salil Jain, Director-HOD, Nephrology and Renal Transplant, Fortis Memorial Research Institute in Gurugram has commented, \"It may also worsen the kidney functioning of those who already have kidney diseases. The theory is that higher intake of animal food products can make your urine more acidic i.e. increase level of excretion of calcium from your urine.\"\n\nContributing to the same report by IANS, Priya Bharma, a Senior Dietician, Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute in New Delhi has said, \"Keto diet is one of the hardest diet schedules to follow which primarily focuses on weight loss. It surely has the potential risk of other health problems as the user is on high proteins and fats intake.\"\n\n\"A person with ideal or lesser body weight is generally not suggested to go for it. It is not suggested to continue for more than 45 days in one go as the body starves for other nutrients as well as high protein puts pressure on the kidney without other related precautions,\" she noted.\n\n‘Health’ comes before ‘fitness’\n\nUnrealistic standards of beauty and physical fitness have adversely affected all of us. Not only are these extreme diet forms unhealthy for our body’s natural functioning, they can also prove to be fatal for us. Every individual has different needs and people with pre-existing chronic conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes, among others, should consult a physician before taking such drastic dietary measures.\n\nLead, social, and thumbnail images credit: Times Of India and Unsplash\n\nVertical image credit: Times Of India\n\nRead iDiva for the latest in Bollywood, fashion looks, beauty and lifestyle news."
