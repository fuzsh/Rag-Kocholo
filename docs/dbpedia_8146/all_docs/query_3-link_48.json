        "text": "Mishti and Monique come face-to-face in a tense meeting, but Monique realises it's a set-up. She tries to flee, but is apprehended by Mishti and Mark, who's been waiting in the wings.\n\nDespite the arrest, Sgt Lake reprimands Mishti for going rogue. She explains the corruption team was closing in on Monique and her gang – Mishti almost blew their whole case. Mishti is remorseful, but Lake is having none of it and suspends her pending further investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, following a seizure brought on by study pressure, Xanthe reaches for her painkillers but realises they're gone from her bag. She asks David for a new prescription and is surprised when he reveals that he has her pills, claiming they fell out when she was at The Shed and he forgot to return them to her.\n\nSeeing Xanthe is not convinced, but determined to cover for Aaron, a weary David distracts Xanthe by offering help with her biology study. Xanthe accepts, but notices David is having trouble focusing and then she finds the unused prescription he filled out for painkillers last week. Adding up the evidence, troubled Xanthe accuses David – does he have an addiction to painkillers?\n\nElsewhere, Chloe is approached by a mother who wants her to deflower her son for his 21st birthday. Needing the money, Chloe agrees. She has no intention of doing the deflowering, but believes she can still achieve the goal by setting up the woman's son with someone else. The night is a success and Chloe is handsomely paid for efforts."
