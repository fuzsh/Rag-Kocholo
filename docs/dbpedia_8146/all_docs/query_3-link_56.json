        "text": "A former star of the Australian soap Neighbours has revealed her astonishing earning figures from posting adult content. Scarlet Vas's high earnings are all the more extraordinary as she shares the screen with her partner, who is also her step-brother.\n\nVas captured audiences hearts as policewoman Mishti Sharma on the show back in 2017 before leaving the following year. Now, she had drawn back the curtains on her post-soap life through her work on the adult content site, OnlyFans, reports the Mirror.\n\nOn her profile, Vas tempts subscribers by promising that they \"will get all the special treatment\" for the equivalent of a Â£19.80 subscription fee. It's quite the change in career for the former soap star.\n\nREAD MORE: For the Love of Dogs fans spot Alison Hammond's 'bad habit'\n\nIn an intriguing revelation made on the Uncensored podcast with Mario Adrion last year, she opened up about the lucrative shift in her career. She said: \"Well to start, I wasn't making a lot.\"\n\nHowever, it was when she chanced upon the perfect method which motivated her to set up her own OnlyFans page, resulting in a substantial increase in her revenue. She said: \"I'm in the 0.01 per cent, like the lowest you can go on OF. But every month's been getting better. Like last month was my best month. I hit almost $200k and then this month I'm going to do well over $200k.\"\n\nThe twist to Scarlet's posting is that she's been receiving help from her 'stepbrother', Tayo Ricci, who is not only an OnlyFans celebrity himself but also became her husband last year. Their unconventional relationship grabbed headlines when it was first revealed.\n\nTayo is keen on producing racy content for his 'stepsister's' adult platform. During a podcast interview, Scarlet said: \"I mean the fans love us as like a thing or not a thing. He's my stepbrother and Australian and we've known each other for a very long time.\"\n\nThe unusual pairing means some viewers might expect some step-sibling themed content, but Tayo said this is not the case. He said: \"To be honest, to the standard that people expect, honestly no. Like close family friends would assume we're doing porn because we're making that much money but we're not.\"\n\nScarlet said: \"There's some cheeky stuff though.\"\n\nAsked on the podcast whether their dad would approve, Scarlet's answer was simple. She said: \"I mean he wouldn't want to watch anything on there.\""
