        "text": "Originally posted by: FruitToasty\n\nI am trying to understand Mishti as a character but somehow his relationship with veer is very underdeveloped for me to understand why exactly is she marrying him?\n\nShe wants a happy family and she wants stability but if she is not happy with Veer, why she thinks that Veer can give her this stability? Is marriage really so important if you are so afraid of getting into it?\n\nKunal's wrongdoings have definitely affected her but what is the need to marry Veer?\n\nMishti is Mauli's daughter, Mauli is a woman who went to her work 2-3 days after she got to know about her husband cheating on her, even if Mishti thinks that Kunal cheated on Mauli because she couldn't give him time, isn't Mauli's life a living proof of Kunal not being THE ONE for her? More over didn't she witness happy marriage of Ishaan and Mauli? Mauli worked when she was married to Ishaan.\n\nIn the end of S1, Mauli did get her happy ending, I really am not able to fathom how Kunal's EMA is affecting Mishti so much.\n\nI am not criticizing her and I do understand that she is afraid of being cheated on, but why is she sacrificing all this for Veer?\n\nThe thing she should understand is that if Veer is important to her then she has to communicate her feelings to him, she is hiding so many things from him, how is she thinking that her relationship will work if she puts up this charade of Mishti in front of Veer? Didn't Veer say that he won't stop Mishti from doing anything?\n\nAs a woman, it's completely Mishti's choice not to work after marriage but she shouldn't stop working if she doesn't want to.\n\nOriginally posted by: Nandy141\n\nMy takeaway from today's episode was that Mishti has overlooked all the good things that happened in Mauli's life. Though Mauli happily moved on with no regrets and chose the right one for her,Mishti is not ready to take any chances .\n\nNot everyone are lucky enough like Mauli to get a second chance in life so Mishti wants to utilize the first chance perfectly.\n\nShe is ready to get married to Veer because she loves the way he loves her but he is not able to give her the emotional stability she is in search of. Her fear of going through a heart break is not letting her trust Veer completely.\n\nEven Kunal was supportive of Mauli's career .. We have so many incidents where he asked her to attend the patients breaking the romatic situations they were in. If loneliness was Kunal's reason for drifting away from Mauli and falling for Nandini. I guess Mishti's decisionto stay at home after marriage is justified ðŸ˜ƒ"
