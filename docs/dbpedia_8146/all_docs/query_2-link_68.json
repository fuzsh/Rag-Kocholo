        "text": "Student Organization SPADE is one of the most successful and fully growing organizations, now spreading its branches to various other parts of the country and conducting events beyond the University. One of the most consistent events conducted by it is ‘SPADE KI PATHSHALA’ every Saturday. Before the closure of the University due to COVID-19, it regularly conducted sessions by various speakers and seniors of the SPADE family discussing various informational topics ranging from improving soft skills, communication skills, and interpersonal skills to confidence and personality boost up providing suggestions to tackle difficult situations with courage.\n\nThis lockdown also hasn’t ‘locked-down’ SPADE from conducting online events including SPADE KI PATHSHALA! So like every Saturday, it is back with another session by another personality, this time a DJ and a dentist in one!\n\nSharmistha Saha aka DJ Mishti is both a DJ and a dentist by profession. She works as a dentist in Amravati Dental Clinic, Lucknow and has completed her medical studies from Sardar Patel PG Institute of Dental and Medical Science with her hometown being in Agartala, Tripura. She has been possessing interests in music, rhythms and beats since 9th standard when ultimately she decided to pursue DJ i.e. Disc Jockey as a career along with her studies. She began learning Sound Specialization on her own and took lessons from Facebook. Then, she studied the course for DJ for 8 months consistently and became proficient in it and finally accepted it as one of her careers. She now has tie-ups with many Companies organizing events where she works with rhythms. Also, she owns a Hub in Lucknow and travels throughout the country and abroad for various events. During these phases, she had struggled a lot to continue pursuing this side career without the support of parents who didn’t appreciate her for running after this job; her friends being her strongest walls. She conducted her latest events in Amritsar, Delhi, Kanpur, Raipur, Varanasi, Bhilai and Nepal and the next cities targeted are Mumbai, Colombia, Hyderabad and Mysore.\n\nShe believes in Women Empowerment and expressed her strong views on it, “I would just like to say one thing, don’t have the fear of anything. If a woman can stand on her own feet, you all never know how strong it is and how strong it looks. Most importantly the feel, the feel of being strong is the most important thing. The society is here which will always speak and speak for pulling you back. We need to cut all the strings. Set an example for them that what we are capable of doing in this world and the fear that has to go, we need to break the bubble and get out and do things which we love to, And one thing is, DON’T STOP DREAMING.”"
