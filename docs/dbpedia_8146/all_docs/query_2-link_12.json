        "text": "Mishti Verma condusts women-specific workshops with the help of theatre\n\nWe got talking to Mishti Verma about experiential learning, how to strike a balance at work and home and her tips for working women.\n\nWhen and how did you decide to take up theatre?\n\nI started theatre in 1995 with Nadira Babbar. I was just 16 then, and so my first love was the stage. While I was pursuing my education, theatre never left me and I continued on a professional level in Mumbai and Delhi. After completing my post-graduation in marketing management and gaining work experience, I decided to start a theatre company that combined marketing and theatre. We have used theatre for niche events and promotions.\n\nWhat is Inner Katha? What made you start it?\n\nInner Katha Interventions is an alternative approach to classroom learning. It brings in theatre, applied psychodrama and other powerful experiential learning methods in corporate and soft skills training. Workshops are for three communities - women, students and people from the corporate field. We started Inner Katha as a corporate training vertical of my theatre company, LAllegro Productions. I strongly believe that the power of theatre is much beyond the four walls of an auditorium. With this, we wanted to break the monotony of classroom learning and make learning fun, engaging and transformational. Inner Katha also means “the story within” and so this kind of learning facilitates deeper self-awareness. Theatre not only engages and captures attention, it has the power to transform and transcend barriers and limitations.\n\nWe have done innovative workshops and repeat programmes for leading multinationals such as Genpact, Schneider Electric, Sony, Hexaware, Mahindra & Mahindra, Philips, Electrolux among others. We have done extensive work on women-specific programs for self-identity and finding balance.\n\nTell us how theatre changed your perspective as far as Inner Katha is concerned.\n\nDeep within us there is a suppressed world of inner conflicts and feelings. Inner Katha supports the spirit of expression versus suppression. Theatre and techniques of applied psychodrama provide a supportive environment, where one can freely express their thoughts and learning. We help participants in sensitising them to play out inner feelings and experience a physical “encounter” with the self, and what one carries within the mind and body. This facilitates objective observation, self-reflection and brings about transformation and creative resolutions. We also propagate “Seeing is Believing”.\n\nCorporate training has become a huge thing today with several big companies opting for it. Tell us how do they help the employees?\n\nIn order to retain, engage and manage the talent within an organisation, training and development are vital. An organisation and its employees both benefit largely from corporate training. It is a two-way stream wherein it increases employee engagement, effectiveness and development along leadership pipelines.\n\nMy experience is that corporate training is greatly effective in building teams. Teams are able to build stronger connect outside their office routine. They understand strengths, competencies and gaps through a process of socialisation and learning.\n\nHow can working women benefit from these workshops? Briefly explain the kind of activities you have implemented in these kind of workshops.\n\nA recent AC Nielsen Survey stated that 87% of Indian women feel stressed most of time. Women gain self-worth from social identity rather than self-identity. Their self-worth is measured through the socially defined roles they play like supermoms, wives, daughter-in laws et al. They are constantly juggling roles and managing expectations and feel at a loss of self and balance. Using therapeutic theatre, applied psychodrama, dance, movement and meditation, we help women to surface suppressed stressors and create effective resolutions. We also introduce them to practical methods and tools to maintain effective work-life balance. One main objective of these workshops is to help women strengthen their self-identity and self-expression.\n\nCan you give us a few tips for working women, especially mothers who juggle multiple responsibilities at work and home?\n\nOnce every hour, do a mental pack up of what is happening around especially your stress areas and to-do lists. Also, focus on your breath for a few seconds. Taking a few deep breaths quietly connect with the space of silence within. This space can be expressed as 'shant ras'. We need different emotional spaces like 'rowdra', 'hasya' and 'sringar rasa' to express ourselves. But the 'shant ras' or the space of silence helps us connect within. Our breath is the best vehicle to connect with this space.\n\nShare your experiences working with theatre stalwarts like Tom Alter and Nadira Babbar among others.\n\nBaji (Nadira Babbar) had given me a book on theatre while I was working with her group, Ekjute. The book said ‘’spreading smiles is real theatre” and that is something I have followed ever since. It has been an absolute pleasure to have worked with Tom saheb too. He is so gracious to have supported us and worked with my theatre production when I had just started my company. There is so much one can learn from him not only about theatre, but also on human values and life. Keep doing, keep walking is the spirit I wish to imbibe from him.\n\nOn a personal level, how do you juggle multiple responsibilities amidst a busy schedule?\n\nHonestly, I struggle too, but for me, the morning is the key. I was never a morning person, till I realised that mornings can work as a brilliant energiser for the rest of the day. Kick-starting the morning with breathing exercises, Buddhist chanting, healthy breakfast and preparing a healthy checklist for the day are a few things I try and follow.\n\nYou are a playwright, soft skills trainer and also a lecturer at several institutes. What do you enjoy doing the most and why?\n\nI enjoy corporate training and also women-specific workshops. I get a platform to connect with people and help them share, express and tap their unique potential. This gives me immense joy and satisfaction. My training environment is never without the magic of theatre. Therefore I get the opportunity to combine all my passions.\n\nWhat are your interests or hobbies if any?\n\nI can dance like nobody is watching! Also, meditation and chanting like somebody is watching over you."
