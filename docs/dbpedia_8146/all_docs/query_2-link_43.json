        "text": "Career workshops are our flagship method for providing you with the practical tools you need to begin your career journey. The workshops are offered repeatedly throughout the autumn and spring semesters, and cover the following five topics:\n\nCV and cover letter: The two essential documents of nearly every application. We dive into the nitty-gritty details of how to write, format and, most importantly, tailor your CV and cover letter.\n\nNetworking: One of the most important but also least-used tactics in job hunting. Whether you are an introvert, extrovert, or somewhere in between, we offer practical advice on how to grow your network and how to use your existing and future connections to land a job.\n\nInterview preparation: An upcoming interview for a dream job can trigger excitement, stress, and even sleepless nights. We walk you through everything from how to prepare yourself beforehand to how to handle tricky questions during the interview.\n\nLinkedIn: It may be the least cool of all the social networks, but it can be a powerful career tool if used correctly. We teach you how to put your best foot forward on the internet's largest professional network.\n\nCareer Planning: We believe that career is an exploratory journey. If you're still unsure about what type of work is right for you, we help you reflect on your potential professional path and assist in drafting an action plan to discover more about yourself."
