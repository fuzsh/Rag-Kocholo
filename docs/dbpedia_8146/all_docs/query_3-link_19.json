        "text": "Synopsis\n\n. I was part of the team that created the Polo Mint campaign (The Mint with the Hole). This campaign was launched 20 years back.\n\nQuintessentially Lifestyle CEO Mishti Bose describes her first year at work. The brief I was given and what I did in the first 100 days.\n\n- My first job was in advertising. I was an account executive with HTA Kolkata (now JWT) and my brief was to shadow my account supervisor for the first three months and learn the ropes of the business.\n\n- My biggest innovation. I was part of the team that created the Polo Mint campaign (The Mint with the Hole). This campaign was launched 20 years back and was one of the most innovative campaigns of it's time. We managed to capture the imagination of the youth very successfully, with very limited media budgets.\n\n- How I managed my work-life balance some of my closest friends are from my early years at work. We were a bunch of account executives who loved advertising and had common interests outside work. So I never had to work towards \"managing a work-life balance\". Work was a fun place to be at.\n\n- What did fun at work mean to you we brainstormed, debated, created great work that all passionately sold to the client. Work was fun.\n\n- The best leadership lesson I learnt \"before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. when you become a leader, success is all about growing others.\" — Jack Welch\n\nSpotted a flying saucer? Don’t fret, it’s just doing an e-com delivery.\n\nWhy Akasa’s losses are mounting when IndiGo is posting record profits\n\nMirae Asset's Surana sees overvaluation in select defence stocks, but feels market is fairly valued\n\nRemember the July 19 global computer outage? Turns out Microsoft made just one error. And it wasn’t something technical.\n\nThree reasons why Mumbai, NCR beat Bengaluru in the IPO treasure hunt\n\nIgnoring mid-caps is not an option, and being selective is a necessity: 6 stocks from different sectors with an upside potential of up to 38 %\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
