        "text": "The quality of products is completely unmatched to the décor of the shop!\n\nThe small, not so sprawling and swanky Adi Sri Hari Mistanna Bhandar at Kalighat is still crowded since the wee hours of the day. The shop opens at 6:30 am and the craze for their ‘Gutke Kachuri’ engulfs well before the clock strikes 7. And then the trail of “mishtimukh” continues beyond afternoon, evening, till 10 pm.\n\nWhat Sri Laxmi Narayan Guin started more than 100 years ago with one establishment at Bhowanipur, has literally built up an enigma with another one at 25A, Kalighat Temple Road since last 27 years. And believe it, or not, even today in 21st century, in a bustling metro city like Kolkata, quality has the last smile over flamboyance.\n\nOnce Laxi Narayan breathed his last, his elder son Pinaki Guin started looking after their Kalighat branch. But as Pinaki is getting old and the need of the hour demands lot of innovation and experimentation skill, his son Rohan, a BTech Engineer with an experience to serve IBM for two years, decides to quit his job to concentrate fulltime in his family business. “I’m enjoying my stint and looking forward to embrace a new career here,” smiles Rohan. He is here to innovate new items which can cater to health-conscious young crowd. “Not innovation actually,” Rohan retaliates instantly, “I’m trying to remodel the old ones.” For example, he has brought in ‘Mini Pantua,’ ‘Kesar Phirni,’ and ‘Liquid Sandesh’ remodeling Gulab Jamun, Payesh and Makha Sandesh. And that’s a massive hit to the young people visiting his shop.\n\nIf you really have a sweet tooth, forget not to taste their ‘Two-in-one Chamcham,’ ‘Gurer Chamcham (during winter),’ ‘Rabri Sarer Roll,’ ‘Jumbo Size Lyangcha,’ and ‘Mango Bati.’ Lyangcha is exceptional to say the least. It is big, less sweet and smooth. The quality of casein is so great, that it melts within your mouth.\n\nPost Pandemic, Rohan aims to improve on three things – more product options, better quality, and interesting presentation. And all these, he wants to do without increasing the price tag. The prolonged ‘adda’ gradually gets into the evening and in comes the tea with their signature snacks item, vegetable chop and singara (samosa) paired with immaculate chutney. Believe me, one single first bite to each one of them, and I felt, I’m enjoying the same old (much bigger here though) taste of Baghbazar in North Kolkata with which I’m acquainted since my childhood. The eyes sparkle and Rohan sweetly smiles reading the pleasure in my countenance."
