        "text": "Kabori was a stalwart of the silver screen for decades. Her smile would earn her the moniker of \"Mishti Meye\" of Bangladeshi cinema. On this day in 2021, she departed from this life, after a hard-fought battle with Covid.\n\nAt the age of 13, the young Mina Pal would become Kabori, debuting on the silver screen along with Subhash Dutta in \"Sutorang\" (1964). \"Neel Akasher Nichey\" (1969) was also a hit among the Bangladeshi audience. Who can forget \"Ektai Gaan Hoye Ele\", where the actress paired up with Razzak? Another landmark in the actress's career is \"Moynamoti\" (1969). When \"Onek Sadher Moyna Amar\"was played during the movie, it was reported that most people in theatres started bawling their eyes out.\n\n\"Sareng Bou\" (1978) still holds a place in the hearts of the people living in the coastal areas of Bangladesh. \"Ore Nil Doriya\", composed by Alom Khan, from this film is still regarded as one of the best Bangla songs to ever be made. Kabori also worked with the great Indian director, Ritwick Ghatak, on his film, \"Titas Ekti Nadir Naam\" (1973). Based on a novel by Adwaita Mallabarman, the movie explores the life of the fishermen on the bank of the Titas river.\n\nIn Chashi Nazrul Islam's \"Devdas\", Kabori played the role of Parvati, to Bulbul Ahmed's Devdas. Kabori brought people to tears with her performance as Parvati—who had to witness the love of her life die in front of her. Kabori became a director with her debut movie \"Ayna\", which was critically appreciated. Her last project \"Ei Tumi, Shey Tumi\", remains unfinished, as she passed away before completing it.\n\nSome of Kabori's iconic folk films include \"Saat Bhai Champa\", \"Arun Barun O Kiranmala\". \"Parul er Shongshar\", among others. Kabori was the epitome of beauty and grace. Her presence is forever embedded in our mind, so is her celestial smile, which made her the \"Mishti Meye\" in the first place."
