I don’t know about you, but director John McTiernan’s action-comedy Last Action Hero starring Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of the movies that made me love movies. And so you can imagine my excitement today when I read that in a recent interview with Screen Rant, Schwarzenegger said he’s definitely open to more “legacy sequels” – mainly Last Action Hero and True Lies.

Schwarzenegger said: “It’s always up to the fans; if they demand to see another movie like that. If a script is great, I do it.“

Which would you rather see Last Action Hero 2 or True Lies 2? Let us know in the comments below or on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram! I think my choice is pretty apparent…

Last Action Hero follows young Danny Madigan (Austin O’Brien) who, following the death of his father, takes comfort in watching action movies featuring the indestructible Los Angeles cop Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger). After being given a magic ticket by theater manager Nick (Robert Prosky), Danny is sucked into the screen and bonds with Slater. When evil fictional villain Benedict (Charles Dance) gets his hands on the ticket and enters the real world, Danny and Jack must follow and stop him.

John McTiernan directed Last Action Hero from a screenplay written by Shane Black and David Arnott based on a story by Zak Penn and Adam Leff. McTiernan also produced along with Steve Roth. Schwarzenegger’s co-stars included F. Murray Abraham, Art Carney, Charles Dance, Frank McRae, Tom Noonan, Robert Prosky, Anthony Quinn, Mercedes Ruehl, Austin O’Brien, and Ian McKellen. Sony unleashed it into theaters back on June 18, 1993.
