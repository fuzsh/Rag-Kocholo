        "text": "American actor (1930–2008)\n\nRobert Prosky (born Robert Joseph Porzuczek, December 13, 1930 – December 8, 2008) was an American actor. He became a well-known supporting actor in the 1980s with his roles in Thief (1981), Christine (1983), The Natural (1984), and Broadcast News (1987).\n\nProsky's other notable movies include Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990), Hoffa (1992), Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), Last Action Hero (1993), Rudy (1993), Miracle on 34th Street (1994), Dead Man Walking (1995), and Mad City (1997). His most notable television role was of Sgt. Stan Jablonski on the TV police drama Hill Street Blues.\n\nProsky, a Polish American,[1] was born in the Manayunk neighborhood of Philadelphia,[2] Pennsylvania, to Helen (Kuhn) and Joseph Porzuczek.[3] His father was a grocer and butcher.[4][5][6] He was raised in a working-class neighborhood and studied at the American Theatre Wing, later graduating from Temple University. He performed at Old Academy Players, a small theater in the East Falls section of Philadelphia, adjacent to Manayunk. He also served in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War, but got a hardship discharge to help with the family store when his father died suddenly.[7]\n\nProsky appeared in Thief, Hanky Panky, The Natural, Hoffa, Broadcast News, Things Change, The Great Outdoors, Loose Cannons, Rudy, Mrs. Doubtfire, Green Card, and Dead Man Walking. He also appeared as Will Darnell, the man who owned the auto repair shop where Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) rebuilds the possessed car \"Christine\" in the film John Carpenter's Christine based on Stephen King's novel.\n\nIn addition to appearing in films, he appeared in many television shows, as a regular on Hill Street Blues, Danny, and Veronica's Closet. Prosky also portrayed Jake \"the Snake\" Connolly on a two-part 1991 episode of Coach. He was considered for the role of Martin Crane in Frasier and later made a guest appearance in the series as a reclusive writer who befriended the character. He was offered the role of Coach Ernie Pantusso on Cheers, but turned it down; he later portrayed Rebecca Howe's father on the same show.[8] His role in Veronica's Closet was likely a nod to this, as in both shows he would play the father of a character portrayed by Kirstie Alley.\n\nIn addition to his film and television career, he appeared in numerous productions at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., most notably as Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman. Prosky often performed at Arena Stage with over 100 stage credits to his name at that theatre alone. He played Shelly Levene in the 1984 Chicago and Broadway production of David Mamet's Pulitzer Prize-winning play Glengarry Glen Ross. He was also a board member of the Cape May Stage in Cape May, New Jersey.\n\nProsky appeared in two films, Dead Man Walking and The Chamber, with actor Raymond J. Barry. He received or was nominated for two Tony awards, two Helen Hayes awards, an Emmy, the Drama Desk award, and the American Express Tribute To An American Actor. He continued to perform on stage and present lectures on his long career at universities, film festivals, for theater benefits, business groups and on cruises.\n\nIn 1960, he married Ida Hove with whom he had three sons, Stefan, John and Andrew Prosky, the latter two being actors as well.[7]\n\nProsky died on December 8, 2008, at age 77 while living in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington, D.C.[8][9] His son John said that the cause was complications of heart surgery at the Washington Hospital Center.[7] The New York Times described him: \"a craggy-faced, heavyset character actor who, after 23 years in regional theater, became a familiar face on Broadway, in movies and on television, notably as a gruff desk sergeant in the later years of Hill Street Blues.\"[7]\n\nPlaybill described him: \"He was best suited to playing salt-of-the-earth characters, sometimes with a mischievous or slightly sinister edge.\"[8]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1978 The Brink's Job Cop in Police Lineup Uncredited 1981 Thief Leo 1982 Hanky Panky Hiram Calder 1982 Monsignor Bishop Walkman 1983 The Lords of Discipline LTC Thomas \"The Bear\" Berrineau 1983 Christine Will Darnell 1983 The Keep Father Fonescu 1984 The Natural The Judge (team owner) 1985 Into Thin Air Jim Conway 1987 Outrageous Fortune Stanislav Korzenowski 1987 Big Shots Keegan 1987 Broadcast News Ernie Merriman 1988 The Great Outdoors Wally 1988 Things Change Joseph 'Don Giuseppe' Vincent 1989 The Heist Dancer 1990 Loose Cannons Von Metz 1990 Gremlins 2: The New Batch Grandpa Fred 1990 Funny About Love Emil Thomas \"E.T.\" Bergman 1990 Green Card Brontë's Lawyer 1991 Age Isn't Everything Grandpa Irving 1992 Far and Away Daniel Christie 1992 Hoffa Billy Flynn 1993 Last Action Hero Nick 1993 Rudy Father John Cavanaugh 1993 Mrs. Doubtfire Jonathan Lundy 1994 Miracle on 34th Street Judge Henry Harper 1995 The Scarlet Letter Horace Stonehall 1995 Dead Man Walking Hilton Barber 1996 The Chamber E.
