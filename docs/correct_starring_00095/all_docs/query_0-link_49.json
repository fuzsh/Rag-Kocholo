He came to prominence as the endearing Sgt. Jablonski who replaced Michael Conrad's Sgt. Esterhaus (\"Let's be careful out there!\") at the opening of each episode of TV's \"Hill Street Blues.\" Prosky also became a familiar TV face in a succession of TV movies, pilots, and guest spots.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n98% Broadcast News\n\n95% Dead Man Walking\n\n85% Things Change\n\n83% The Natural\n\n80% Thief\n\n77% Rudy 72% Christine\n\n71% Gremlins 2: The New Batch\n\nPhotos\n\nLORDS OF DISCIPLINE, Robert Prosky, 1983, (c)Paramount CHRISTINE, Keith Gordon, John Stockwell, Robert Prosky, 1983, (c)Columbia Pictures LORDS OF DISCIPLINE, L-R David keith, John Lavachielli, Robert Prosky, Rick Rossovich, Mitchell Lichtenstein, 1983 LORDS OF DISCIPLINE, David Keith, Robert Prosky, 1983 EYE SEE YOU (aka D-TOX), from left: Sylvester Stallone, Christopher Fulford, Robert Patrick, Courtney B.
