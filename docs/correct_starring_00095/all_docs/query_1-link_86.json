        "text": "Mrs Doubtfire | DVD | (30/07/2001) from £5.99 | Saving you £7.00 (116.86%) | RRP £12.99\n\nThis huge 1993 hit for Robin Williams and director Chris Columbus (Home Alone), based on a novel called Alias Madame Doubtfire by Anne Fine, stars Williams as a loving but flaky father estranged from his frustrated wife (Sally Field). Devastated by a court order limiting his time with the children, Williams's character disguises himself as a warm, old British nanny who becomes the kids' best friend. As with Dustin Hoffman's performance in Tootsie, Williams's drag act--buried under layers of latex and padding--is the show, and everything and everyone else on screen serves his sometimes frantic role. Since that's the case, it's fortunate that Williams is Williams, and his performance is terribly funny at times and exceptionally believable in those scenes where his character misses his children. Playing Williams's brother, a professional makeup artist, Harvey Fierstein has a good support role in a bright sequence where he tries a number of feminine looks on Williams before settling on Mrs Doubtfire's visage. --Tom Keogh\n\nThe Great Outdoors | DVD | (10/11/2003) from £4.99 | Saving you £5.00 (100.20%) | RRP £9.99\n\nWhen an unannounced uninvited and unwelcome family of fun-loving misfits converge upon a lakeside resort to join their relatives for a summer of relaxation the result is anything but restful. It's a vacationer's worst nightmare as wheeler-dealer Aykroyd his sexually repressed wife and eerie twin daughters 'join' the easygoing Candy and his straight-laced clan for a season of 'fun' in the sun. Unfortunately the only thing these two in-laws have in common is their intense dislike for each other. Soon it's brother-in-law against brother-in-law in an uproarious and hilarious fight to the finish to see which one really knows how to enjoy 'The Great Outdoors'.\n\nLast Action Hero (2 Discs - UHD & BD) | Blu Ray | (17/05/2021) from £19.99 | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £N/A\n\nYoung Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) is a lonely 11-year-old boy who escapes from his bleak reality by watching the action adventure movies of his favorite film character, Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger). When his best friend, Nick the projectionist, gives him a special ticket to the new Slater film, Danny is magically transported into Jack's world, where the good guys always win. Danny becomes his helper as Jack battles a trio of nefarious bad guys, Benedict (Charles Dance), Vivaldi (Anthony Quinn) and The Ripper (Tom Noonan). But things get out of hand when Benedict steals Danny's magic ticket stub and transports himself into the real world, where crime can, and often does, pay. Jack and Danny must leave fictional Los Angeles for real-life New York and battle the villains without the aid of movie magic or stuntmen.\n\nOutrageous Fortune | DVD | (19/07/2004) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £14.99\n\nSometimes a movie works despite all its faults. Outrageous Fortune has a flimsy, formulaic script, so-so production values and an odd combination of stars, but somehow it's engaging and fun. Shelley Long and Bette Midler play two struggling actresses--one a hoity-toity priss and the other a brassy slob--who learn they've been sleeping with the same guy (Peter Coyote) when he gets blown up in a terrorist assault and they confront each other in the morgue. When they discover that he's still alive, the bickering pair track him down, traipsing across the US in high heels, pursued all the way by government agents, using their dubious acting talents to get them out of tough situations. The absurd plot keeps things moving and director Arthur Hiller (Silver Streak, The Out of Towners) gets cheerful performances out of everyone, particularly the strong supporting cast--including Robert Prosky (Broadcast News, Mrs. Doubtfire) as a pompous acting teacher, comedian George Carlin as a burnt-out would-be Indian and the underused John Schuck (M*A*S*H, McCabe & Mrs. Miller) as a long-suffering agent. Although contrived and cliché-ridden, the film is just absurd enough to entertain. --Bret Fetzer\n\nGreen Card | DVD | (20/05/2002) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £14.99\n\nIn the delightful romantic comedy Green Card, Georges (Gérard Depardieu), a composer and one-time petty thief who grew up in poverty, attempts to escape his life in Paris and begin anew in America by illegally marrying Bronte (Andie MacDowell), a prim and repressed young lady from a privileged life in Connecticut. Bronte, who has agreed to the scheme for her own self-serving reasons, is exasperated when the Immigration & Naturalisation Service investigates their case, and she and Georges, whom she detests, must spend time together studying each other's lives to avoid disaster. The fallout is infinitely better handled than any run-of-the-mill Hollywood romantic comedy, and the very ending itself stops deliciously short of where Hollywood would feel compelled to drag the story. Fine performances are given by MacDowell, Depardieu--who is fiercely charming pounding the keyboard of a Steinway at an upper class Manhattan dinner party--and Bebe Neuwirth, who is perfect as an upper-class child turned artist who revels in her irresponsibility. --James McGrath, Amazon.com\n\nMiracle On 34th Street | DVD | (07/11/2005) from £5.99 | Saving you £4.00 (66.78%) | RRP £9.99\n\nThis remake of the popular heartwarming Christmas classic captures all the joy of the original version. A little girl who has been raised not to believe in fantasy fairy tales and Santa Claus meets a department-store Santa who claims he's the real Kris Kringle. Her mother insists that it can't be true--that Kris is only a nice old man who isn't all too sane. But soon things start happening that may make both of them change their minds... and have faith in magic once again.\n\nDead Man Walking | DVD | (17/09/2001) from £5.99 | Saving you £10.00 (166.94%) | RRP £15.99\n\nA serious film on a serious subject, Dead Man Walking (1995) is enriched by two excellent performances: Sean Penn as a murderer and rapist facing execution on Death Row, and Susan Sarandon as a nun who visits and befriends him. Tim Robbins, the writer and director of the film (and Sarandon's husband), based the film on a true story, and there's not much narrative tension since it's obvious Penn will not escape his fate. But the film is a clear-eyed look at the realities of capital punishment and its grisly rituals, which at the same time never sentimentalises the people or the issues. There is no shying away from the evil of the murderer's acts and their effects on the victims' families, but this is balanced against the heartlessness and cynicism of those in the prison system and their political masters. It's hard to say whether the film is ultimately against capital punishment; it certainly encourages you to think for yourself. On the DVD: The image and sound quality is excellent, in widescreen ratio 16:9. There's a theatrical trailer and a TV commercial for the film, which also has language tracks in English, French and Spanish and subtitles in English, French, Spanish, Dutch and Hungarian. There's also an audio commentary on the film by director Tim Robbins which gives valuable insights into the political background of the film and the shooting process. --Ed Buscombe\n\nLords Of Discipline | DVD | (20/06/2005) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £15.99\n\nWill (David Keith) arrives for his last year at a Military Academy in the Deep South USA in the 1960's where a black student has been accepted for the first time. Will is forced to help the new student from the attentions of racists but is he prepared to risk his own career to do so? Based on the novel by Pat Conroy.\n\nDead Man Walking | Blu Ray | (28/01/2013) from £14.83 | Saving you £-1.84 (N/A%) | RRP £12.99\n\nInspired by a true story, this provocative tale of crime and redemption earned Susan Sarandon a 1995 Oscar for Best Actress and Sean Penn an Oscar Nomination for Best Actor. Sister Helen Prejean (Sarandon) becomes the spiritual advisor to Matthew Poncelet (Penn), a vicious and complex killer awaiting execution. As she attempts to save Matthew's dark soul, she uncovers shocking truths that will rock the very foundation of her faith.\n\nMrs Doubtfire / Dunston Checks In / Baby's Day Out | DVD | (15/09/2003) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £12.99\n\nMrs Doubtfire: How far would an ordinary father go to spend more time with his children? Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is no ordinary father so when he learns his ex-wife (Sally Field) needs a housekeeper he applies for the job. With the perfect wig a little makeup and a dress for all occasions he becomes Mrs Doubtfire a devoted British housekeeper who is hired on the spot. Free to be the 'woman' he never knew he could be the disguised Daniel creates a whole new life with his entire family! Dunston Checks In: An orangutan called Dunston checks into a hotel which he proceeds to turn upside down. The manager's son Kyle is determined to help Dunston escape to a new life... Baby's Day Out: The Cotwell family arrange a family portrait only to discover that the photographers are kidnappers!\n\nThings Change (Standard Edition) | Blu Ray | (26/06/2023) from £9.99 | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £N/A\n\nWritten and directed by David Mamet (Oleanna), the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright known for his intense dramas, Things Change is a charming, expertly crafted 'mistaken identity' comedy. The Mob force unassuming shoe-shine man Gino (Don Ameche, Trading Places) into taking the hit for a murder he didn't commit. The pay-off? A fishing boat in Sicily when he gets out. Small-time crook Jerry (Joe Mantegna, House of Games) takes Gino on one last jaunt to Lake Tahoe before his term begins, but, when Gino is mistaken for a major league gangster, the duo soon fall prey to local hoodlums... An unexpected change of pace for Mamet, Things Change benefits from an intelligent, witty script and superb central performances from Ameche and Mantegna, who received Best Actor awards at the Venice Film Festival for their efforts. Product Features High Definition remaster Original mono audio Engineering Things (2021, 21 mins): acclaimed writer-director David Mamet reminisces about his career and the making of Things Change Things Happen (2021, 30 mins): actor Joe Mantegna on working with Mamet and Don Ameche Melodies for Mamet (2021, 17 mins): composer Alaric Rokko Jans describes the process of scoring Things Change, and his other collaborations with Mamet Life As It Could Be (2021, 10 mins): appreciation by comedian, musician and writer Rob Deering Original theatrical trailer Image gallery: promotional and publicity materials New and improved English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing\n\nHoffa | DVD | (04/10/2004) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £12.99\n\nDirector and co-star Danny DeVito spins David Mamet's literate screenplay into an unforgettable biopic starring Jack Nicholson as Jimmy Hoffa the legendary Teamster boss whose mysterious disappearance has never been explained. The film traces Hoffa's passionate struggle to shape the nation's most influential labor union his relationship with the mob and his subsequent conviction and prison term at the hand of Robert Kennedy...\n\nLast Action Hero | DVD | (16/02/2004) from £9.99 | Saving you £-4.00 (N/A%) | RRP £5.99\n\nJohn McTiernan (The Hunt for Red October) imaginatively directs this action comedy, which is an interesting failure with some fascinating ironies that make it well worth seeing. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays both a character named Jack Slater--a fictional cop hero who exists only in the movies (ie, the movies seen by the characters in this movie) and the actor who plays Jack Slater in the real world (ie, in the movie we're actually watching). McTiernan's hall-of-mirrors effect is fun, though Last Action Hero never quite identifies itself as a pure action movie, science fiction, a kid's movie, or anything else. (The expensive film suffered at the box office as a result and was roundly criticised for this ambivalence.) What lingers in the memory, however, is Schwarzenegger, playing himself, being confronted by Slater for having created an alter ego for film in the first place. It's a provocative moment: how often have we seen a major star blatantly wrestle with his actor's legacy in this way? --Tom Keogh\n\nChristine | DVD | (03/10/2005) from £22.98 | Saving you £-16.99 (N/A%) | RRP £5.99\n\nShe can't (and won't) drive 55.... Stephen King's novel about the twisted love affair between a boy and his car gets transferred to the screen, courtesy of suspense master John Carpenter. Although lacking some of the more outré supernatural elements of the source material, this high-octane cinematic tune-up more than delivers the goods, horror-wise (Christine's midnight rampages will never be forgotten)--as well as being a sly exposé of the random cruelties within the high-school pecking order. Keith Gordon (who has gone on to become a stellar director in his own right, with films such as A Midnight Clear and Mother Night to his credit) gives a wonderfully controlled central performance. Carpenter's atmospheric original score is backed up by a well-chosen collection of rock classics, including George Thorogood's \"Bad to the Bone\" (the titular character's all-too-apt theme song). --Andrew Wright, Amazon.com\n\nFar And Away | DVD | (08/09/2003) from £5.49 | Saving you £0.50 (9.11%) | RRP £5.99\n\nFilmed in the widescreen splendour of \"Panavision Super 70\" and blessed with the finest production values that Hollywood clout can buy, this tale of spunky Irish immigrants forgot one crucial ingredient: a decent screenplay. The film is entertaining enough, and director Ron Howard brings his technical proficiency to the simple plot, culminating in a dynamic, breathtaking depiction of the Oklahoma land rush of 1893. But the movie is really just a vacuous vehicle for married stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as (respectively) the poor tenant farmer and rich landlord's daughter who flee Ireland to be American pioneers. The scenery and the stars are never less than stunning, but Howard falls short of the mark in his attempt to match the epic sweep of films by David Lean. On the other hand, this movie is certainly never boring even if it rarely makes sense, and Lean's own Irish epic, Ryan's Daughter, is a snoozer by comparison. --Jeff Shannon, Amazon.com\n\nThe Chamber | DVD | (06/06/2005) from £7.14 | Saving you £-1.15 (N/A%) | RRP £5.99\n\nWith just 28 days until before his impending execution young attorney Adam Hall sets out to trace the events of a grisly event in an effort to prevent his grandfather from going to the gas chamber for a racist murder... Chris O'Donnell and Gene Hackman star in this electrifying thriller based on the novel by John Grisham with a screenplay from Oscar winner William Goldman.\n\nThe 6th Day/Last Action Hero | DVD | (01/12/2003) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £24.99\n\nThe 6th Day: Arnold Schwarzenegger is Adam an ace pilot in the very near future who is having a serious identity crisis. An illegal corporation illegally cloned him and now they're trying to kill him to hide the evidence. Torn from his beloved family and faced with a shocking exact duplicate of himself Adam races against time to reclaim his life and save the world from the underground cloning movement. Last Action Hero: Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) a young cinem\n\nBroadcast News | DVD | (19/04/2004) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £12.99\n\nHolly Hunter plays a network news producer who, much to her chagrin, finds herself falling for pretty-boy anchorman William Hurt. He is all glamour without substance and represents a hated shift from hard news toward packaged \"infotainment\", which Hunter despises. Completing the triangle is Albert Brooks, who provides contrast as the gifted reporter with almost no presence on camera. He carries a torch for Hunter; she sees merely a friend. Written and directed by James L. Brooks, Broadcast News shows remarkable insight into the people who make television. On the surface the film is about that love triangle. If you look a little deeper, however, you will see that this behind-the-scenes comedy is a very revealing look at obsessive behaviour and the heightened emotions that accompany adrenaline addiction. It is for good reason this was nominated for seven Academy Awards (though it did not win any). There are scenes in this movie you cannot shake, such as Hunter's scheduled mini-breakdowns, or Brooks' furious \"flop sweat\" during his tryout as a national anchor. Watch for an uncredited Jack Nicholson as a senior newscaster. --Rochelle O'Gorman\n\nIce Age / Chicken Run / Home Alone / Mrs Doubtfire / James And The Giant Peach | DVD | (16/08/2004) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £39.99\n\nIce Age Seemingly anti-social Manny a woolly mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano) acts as if he just wants to be left alone. When he meets Sid (voiced by John Leguizamo) a sloth the two become unlikely traveling companions. The plot thickens when the duo finds a human infant and decides to try to return the child to its herd. Manny slowly but surely reveals his heart of gold while Sid continues to provide comic relief. Diego (voiced by Denis Leary) a saber-tooth tiger with ulterior motives soon joins them in their search for the humans. Ultimately this group of misfits becomes its own herd learning about friendship and loyalty as they brave snow ice freezing temperatures predators hail and even boiling lava pits. All the while a saber-tooth squirrel Scrat provides comic relief as he valiantly struggles with an acorn. Chicken Run Trouble is brewing down on Mrs Tweedy's poultry farm: the chickens are revolting (yes that old chestnut) and clucky hen Ginger (voiced by Julia Sawalha) is planning her latest coop um coup. Getting one or two birds out of the farm is no problem whatsoever. Unfortunately Ginger plans to get everyone out at the same time and when one of the would-be escapees happens to be kind-hearted but bird-brained Babs (Jane Horrocks) Ginger is fighting a losing battle. Home Alone Eight-year-old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) has become the man of the house overnight! Accidentally left behind when his family rushes off on a Christmas vacation Kevin gets busy decorating the house for the holidays. But he's not decking the halls with tinsel and holly. Two bumbling burglars are trying to break in and Kevin's rigging a bewildering battery of booby traps to welcome them! Mrs Doubtfire How far would an ordinary father go to spend more time with his children? Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is no ordinary father so when he learns his ex-wife (Sally Field) needs a housekeeper he applies for the job.

Caan plays Frank, a jewel thief and former convict who is looking to settle down with his girlfriend (Tuesday Weld, Once Upon a Time in America) and begin a family. But when his fence' is thrown from a window and the Chicago mafia begin to flex their muscles, his hopes of a quiet life become anything but With a sterling supporting cast in the shape of James Belushi, Robert Prosky, Willie Nelson and Dennis Farina, lush electronic score by Tangerine Dream and the assured direction of Mann, Thief is a standout eighties crime flick that paved the way for the his later urban thrillers such as Heat and Collateral as well as Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive.
