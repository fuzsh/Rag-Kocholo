        "meta_description": "A magic ticket used in the production of the fourth wall-breaking Last Action Hero. When young cinema lover Danny Madigan (Austin OBrien) is given a magical cinema ticket by old projectionist Nick (Robert Prosky), he is transported into the world of his favourite action movie hero, Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger).pThree styles of ticket were used for the film, with this style of ticket seen in use at the start of the film as Nick presents Danny with it shortly before tearing it in half, unleashing its magical powers. Made of gold card, the ticket is in two halves and features the All-Seeing-Eye at its centre, with the text Admit One in red running along the bottom and admittance prices around the edge. The rear of the ticket shows the seating plan for the Pandora Theatre. Torn for use on the production, the two halves are from two separate tickets and do not form a matching pair.ppIn a good production-used condition, the ticket comes presented in a bespoke framed display featuring a laser-cut mount board with the films title and poster artwork and an opening front panel allowing direct access to the piece.p",
