        "text": "Introduction\n\nEach legislative session, dozens of bills are introduced that impact the disability community. Some bills aim to help, while others could have negative consequences for Minnesotans with disabilities. Here you will find a list of disability-related bills introduced during the legislative session.\n\nNote: This list is simply meant to inform the public on disability-related legislation and does not imply support or opposition to the bills. To learn more about the legislative priorities that the Minnesota Council on Disability (MCD) does support, please view our Public Policy Agenda.\n\nOur bill tracking page is updated weekly. To view the most recent bill introductions, visit the following pages:\n\nHouse Bill Introductions\n\nSenate Bill Introductions\n\n2023 Bill Deadlines\n\nYou can now view which bills have met first or second deadline.\n\nIf a bill has met first deadline (March 10), it has been heard in committee in either the house or the senate. If a bill has met second deadline (March 24), it has been heard in committees in both the house and the senate. This legislative session has been historic for disability-related bills. Of the approximately 250 bills (and counting) introduced in 2023, 128 of them have met first or second deadline. In other years, we usually only see about one hundred disability-related bills introduced and about half will meet deadlines.\n\nIf a bill does not meet first and second deadline, it likely will not pass the 2023 legislative session; however, the deadline may be waived for some high-priority bills.\n\nFor the full status of a bill, follow the linked bill number to its Revisor page.\n\nBill Tracking Survey\n\nWhat do you think of our bill tracking efforts? MCD wants to know. We would appreciate it if you took the time to fill out this bill tracking survey.\n\n2023 Disability-related Bills\n\nTopics:\n\nOmnibus Bills\n\nCouncil on Disability Priorities\n\nDisabled Veterans\n\nEducation, Higher\n\nEducation, K-12\n\nHealth\n\nHousing and Independent Living\n\nHuman Rights\n\nHuman Services\n\nMental Health\n\nPublic Safety\n\nState and Local Government\n\nTransportation\n\nNote: This list is not meant to be comprehensive and additional topics will be added as bills are introduced.\n\nOmnibus Bills\n\nAn omnibus bill covers a broad range of related topics or issues and combines multiple provisions into a single piece of legislation.
