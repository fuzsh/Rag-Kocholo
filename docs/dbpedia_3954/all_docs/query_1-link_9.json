Clay County was organized in 1806 and Robert Hicks (Sr.) and wife Winifred Combs (Summers) were listed as already married and living in Kentucky Territory at that time. The 1820 census listed only heads of families -number of children - sex - approximate age - of each one. A California correspondent has dates for Robert Sr. (1738-1845). He has reason to believe that Mr. Hicks was born in North Carolina.\n\nWinifred (Nancy) Combs was a daughter of Henry Harrison Combs, a proven descendant of John Combs and wife Margaret Archedale Combs, married in London, England, December 11, 1587. Margaret was the daughter of Thomas Archdale, a London merchant. Thomas was the son of John Archdale, whose genealogy is given on page 160, Genealogical Gleanings of England.\n\nJohn and Margaret Combs came to the American colonies and to Virginia, on the ship, Marygold, 1619. (See Purse and Pursons, First Families of Virginia.)\n\nHenry Harrison Combs was one of the eight sons of John Combs, who came from Virginia to Clay (Perry Co.) Kentucky before 1800. Henry Harrison Combs was a Patriot in the Revolutionary War. His brother Nicholas Combs was a Tory, and named his sons for English generals.\n\nDescendants of this Combs family still live in Perry Co. Many distinguished people have descended from this family - governors, generals, admirals, etc. They own and operate a newspaper today, and welcome any geneology on the Combs family sent them. They have a family reunion each year. Many years ago, this group set up a scholarship for others, also they have many funds for worthy causes.\n\nRobert Hicks, Sr. Married Winifred Combs (widow Summers) in Va., and came to that part of Ky. then Clay County, now Perry County, Ky. Winifred (Nancy) Combs (Summers) had that we find, by her first husband Summers, Mary Summers, who married George Stacy. Elizabeth Summers, who married John Cody. The Codys and Stacys came with the Robert Hicks Jrs. to Md., to Mo. The Stacys and Codys settled in Wright County, where some of their descendants still live.\n\nRobert Hicks Sr. and Winifred Combs Hicks had children that I have proof:\n\nJames Hicks - married Hester Cox.\n\nMary Hicks - married Mr. Ingram. The Ingrains came with Robert Hicks Jr. They settled in Taney Co., Mo.\n\nSarah Hicks, married also in Clay Co., Ky.-Joshua Rippee.\n\nRobert Hicks Jr. born Clay Co., Ky., 28 May 1804 - married Elizabeth Polley.\n\nFrances Hicks, born Clay Co., Ky., -married George Rogers.\n\nAll the above came to Indiana and to Missouri. Robert Hicks, Sr. died October 8, 1845, in Ky. His wife, Winifred, preceeded him in death as when he sold property in Perry Co., Ky, no wife signed the deed.\n\nRobert Hicks, Jr. and Elizabeth Polley Hicks children were:\n\nNancy Hicks, born 17 May, 1824, Ky., -married James McIntosh.\n\nFrances Hicks, born 12 Feb, 1828, Ky., -married John Riley.\n\nJane W. Hicks, born 6 June, 1831, Indiana -married Dr. Charles R. Wilson.\n\nArthur Hicks, born 7 Dec., 1834 - Indiana.\n\nElizabeth Ellen Hicks - born 3 April, 1836, married Mr. Coats.\n\nWilliam Hicks, born 2 May, 1837, married Hester Cox.\n\nJohn Harrison Hicks, born 7 May, 1838, Ozark Co., Mo. - married Anna Riley.\n\nIsaac Hicks, born 14 Sept. 1841, Mo. His mother died at his birth.\n\nRobert Hicks married second wife, Catherine Sweeton. She was a widow and had one son named John, who also went by the name of Hicks. Children of Robert and Catherine Hicks were: Julina, Mary, Mehalia, Winifred, Robert, Ledia.\n\nWinifreds father, Mr. Combs, was listed as an English sympathizer during the Revolutionary War and War of 1812. It seemed he was actually not against the American cause but - as a well to do person - he felt the cost of taxation on imports was not enough to fight a war over.\n\n[9]\n\nBecause he didnt actually go to war himself, the English decided he was for England and listed him thus. After the war, he was taken to court and there he proved that he hadnt homesteaded a foot of land - either by squatters rights or otherwise. Since he was able to prove that he paid English money for all his land - he did not lose it.\n\n1812 - During the war of 1812 - with the British, Robert Hicks, Sr. and a group of neighboring men decided to investigate governmental land that was being opened up for homesteading in Indiana. On their way they met with a company of American soldiers who stopped to talk with Robert and his friends. Robert was asked by the top ranking officer to write his name. At that time - so few of the settlers could read or write.\n\nThis time he should have played ignorant because when the officer found he was educated - he was immediately drafted into the service - was made an officer for the duration of the war.\n\n1812 War - After the close of the war the entire Hicks family - composed of himself and wife Winifred - three of their children and their families - James - wife Rebecca Riley -Robert Junior - wife Elizabeth Polly - daughter Sarah - husband Josiah Rippee - joined a group of friends and moved to Indiana - Monroe County - about 1836-1838.\n\nSarah and Josiah had been married by a justice of the peace in Kentucky, but Robert, Sr. was not satisfied with this ceremony so-he being a minister - remarried them when they reached Indiana.\n\nIt was in the early 1840s when James and Robert Hicks Jr. and families moved to the Missouri Ozarks. Ozark County was first organized in 1841 - a vast area composed of what is now Ozark and Douglas Counties and a large part of western Howell County.\n\nIn 1857 - Douglas County was organized and a strip off the eastern side of Ozark County put with what is now Howell County. When the area was divided the Hicks families holdings and interests happened to be in the eastern part of Douglas County. Robert Hicks, Jr. served several terms in the Missouri Legislature - first before reorganization and also in Douglas County after reorganization. He died of pneumonia in Jefferson City while attending a session there on February 22, 1863, and due to the fierce fighting in most of the border states - in the Civil War between the north and the south - it was weeks before a messenger could safely get thru to deliver the news of his death and his horse and personal belongings to his family in Douglas County.\n\nHistory tells of the battles in most of the border states on either side of the \"Mason-Dixon\" line - in fact, most of the border states were actually battlegrounds - as anyone who lived near at that time could tell us. We do not know if Robert Hicks. Sr. ever came to Missouri - he died in 1845, probably in Indiana. A later census (Indiana) mentioned his wife Winifreds name.\n\nJames and Rebecca are buried in the\n\nYates cemetery in eastern Douglas county. A list of their children follows: Richard Riley - Elmie - Franky - Dorcas - Leander - Mediar - Isaac - Robert (a girl, Ellen in the list is believed to be wife of the last named Robert). A story of an interesting happening about *Thomas Robert Hicks - a grandson of *Robert Hicks, Jr. I think it really belongs here.\n\nOn a hot summer day in 1951, I went with my husbands folks - Father Thomas - Mother Laura - brother Vernie and sister Hattie - to Columbia, Missouri, taking the elder Hicks to the Ellis Fischer Hospital there for a check-up. (cancer suspected)\n\nLate in the afternoon - returning home we drove thru Jefferson City. Father Hicks asked Vernie if he knew how to find the c6metery where his grandfather was buried. Vernie said he could find it. Father Hicks replied - in a muffled voice - \"Here I am - 85 years old and I have never been able to visit my grandfathers grave.\"\n\nWhen we arrived near the cemetery it was on the opposite side of the street - with two lanes of hurrying traffic - people rushing homeward from their places of work - it was that time of day when everyone concerned was tired and in a hurry. The elder Hicks couple also were tired. Vernie attracted the attention of the traffic cop on duty and told him our worry. The cop said \"Well, we'll remedy that.\" He held the traffic - explained to them that an 85 year old man wanted across the street so he could visit his grandfathers grave for the first time. They waved to him as we reached the other side of the street and up the lane to the cemetery. When we reached the grave, Father Thomas knelt down to better see what was written on the slab of concrete that\n\n[10]\n\ncompletely covered the entire grave. He felt with his fingers the letters as follows:\n\n\"Sacred to the memory of Robert Hicks - late representative of Douglas and Ozark Counties. Died February 22, 1863. Age 58 years.\"\n\nHICKSCOLSTON FAMILIES\n\nArthur Monroe Hicks, born 1833, died 1872, married Hester Coiston of Florida - her people originally came from Denmark. Arthur was a son of *Robert Hicks, Jr. and wife Elizabeth Polly. Arthur and Hester had two children - a daughter Catherine Florida - born 1861 - died 1951 - and a son John - who died at about the age of 6 years. Florida married George Hutchinson June 25, 1884. They had two daughters, Molly (1887-1965), whose husband was Andrew Proctor. They had a family but I have no list. Minnie - husband Thomas Lakey - they had a daughter Vivian Lorene - born December 26, 1928, and a son George Vernon - born June 21, 1931. They both have families but no list here. Mr. Hutchinson died November 1, 1936. Mr. Lakeys life years -born January 17, 1895 - died November 19, 1951. Hester died when young. John was two weeks old. Some time later Arthur married a widow who had a family of children by her first husband - Nathan Herndon - who was killed during the Civil War. To Arthur and Mary Jane Todd Herndon were born two sons -Thomas Robert and Arthur Franklin. A. F. never married, but served in the Spanish American War. Thomas Roberts lists will be given later. A. F.s life years: 1869-1915.\n\nTHE TIE THAT BINDS\n\n[Blood Kin]\n\nThis is a narrative in the lives of two very dear people. They are listed in this history -and touched our lives in a wonderful way.\n\nThomas Robert Hicks and Florida Hicks Hutchinson were half brother and sister - each born in a separate family but they had the same father.\n\nFloridas mother died and after a time her father - Arthur Monroe Hicks - married Mary Jane Todd Herndon - widow with several children. They became the parents of two boys - Thomas Robert and Arthur Franklin Hicks. Years rolled by - both Thomas and Florida grew to maturity - married and had families of their own. In fact they were both grandparents several times before they found and got re-acquainted with each other.\n\nNow - the odd part of this story is that down thru the years they lived in adjoining counties - Ozark and Douglas - but then folks didnt travel very far by horseback or wagon -chores at home anyway!\n\nIt wasnt that Thomas didnt wonder and worry about his sister - in fact they did have news by letter a few times through the years.\n\nOne day Thomas mentioned to one of his sons that he would like to visit Florida some day. The son said \"Dad - why dont we just go over into East Douglas County and look her up?\"\n\nResults of that visit? Florida (against protests by her two daughters that she was too old to move and live alone among strangers) decided to take a few personal things for light housekeeping - moved to Ozark County. She lived a year in a small one-room house in our yard at the Y Store - Wasola, Mo. She didnt want to bother anyone and didnt want anyone to worry about her. She just wanted to be near where she could visit with \"Tom and his family\" before time ran out for one of them.\n\nNeedless to say - all our families grew very fond of Aunt Florida during that year. She was about 5 years older then Father Thomas -they both were in the 80s - also Mother Laura was elderly too.\n\nAll are gone now, but the memory of their belated kinship association is a very pleasant one, indeed.\n\nVBH\n\nHERNDONTODD ANCESTORS AND DESCENDANTS\n\n*Mary Jane Todd was born March 11, 1832, in Kentucky - she died in Missouri - March 19, 1914, and is buried in the Herndon Cemetery near Almartha, Ozark County, Missouri.\n\nShe was married to Nathan Herndon, son of George and Hannah Cox Herndon.\n\n*Nathans life years were 1828-1864. He was killed during the Civil War by a group of \"bushwhackers\" - outlaws who belonged to neither side - north or south. Nathan served in Captain Martaindales company of Ozark County Home Guard.\n\nSeven children were born to them -Hannah Mary - 1849-1939; Sarah Jane, born\n\n[11]\n\n1851; Milton - 1853-1863; Synthia - 1858-1863; F. M. (Marion) - 1855- 1932; A. L. (Abner) 1869-1884; Choley - 1863-1885. A list of the childrens families (those who grew to maturity and had families) will be listed elsewhere in this history.\n\nMary Janes second husband and family are listed with the Hicks ancestors. Late in life, Mary Jane Todd Herndon Hicks married a third husband, Richard Thompson. We know very little about his life or family. She outlived him several years. The Hicks children always referred to him as \"Uncle Dick\". Later information: Richard N. Thompson (listed under John Wesley Thompsons family.)\n\nTHE MARY JANE AND NATHAN HERNDON FAMILY BY FAMILY GROUPS\n\nHeads of the following families are half brothers and sisters (with their marriage companions) to Thomas Robert Hicks and Arthur Franklin Hicks.

Plenty of work there, believe you me! Those were the years between World War I, World War II, and after. Just to make things harder - we had several dry seasons all in a row - dried up crops and pastures. Most of us had children to feed, clothe, and educate. Whew! Those were busy but precious years!\n\nDELPHAS FAMILY  BEASLEY\n\nFather - Robert Wiley Beasley - 1871-1961 -and Mother - Etta Ann Harris - 1877-1958. A brother Doin - married but no other record here. A sister Dosha - husband Clair Cropper. No children. Doshas life years 1902-1967. Clair later married Irene Beach Mason, daughter of Frank and Daralee Beach of Souder. No children in either marriage.\n\nVBH - Just a memory here. I remember a time Clarence and I visited Clyde and Delpha in their home. Their son Basil and our daughter Elsie were just babies - it was a bitter cold night and their home was just a shack they lived in while he taught the rural school there. Elsie Lee took the croup and none of us slept very much that night. By the morning we (C. E. and I) were on our way back to his parents home. Two small wood stoves just would not - could not - beat back the cold.\n\nResults - Elsie Lee bordered pneumonia. After we made her more comfortable at the elder Hicks home - she fell asleep. She slept so long that Mother Laura - Clarence and I (Viola) started worrying. Father Thomas said \"Let me hold that baby.\" He checked her breathing, her pulse, and looked in her mouth - saw the tongue cleaved to the roof of her mouth. He said \"When I get to sleeping that sound, just leave me alone.\"\n\nHICKS  BYERLEY FAMILIES\n\n*Clarence Earl Hicks - born January 28, 1896 - died August 28, 1969. Viola Byerley -born January 20, 1892. They were married July 3, 1915 by Reverend Samuel H. Daniel of Wasola, Missouri. (a bit of humor here.) According to plans - on the morning of July 3, 1915, we met Brother Sam and his small daughter Mellie with his wagon and team on his way to the mill at Rockbridge, Missouri. Rockbridge was 12 miles away - quite a trip for a team - considering the waiting time at the mill for them to get the bread stuffs ground. It was about 6:00 a.m. (We didnt have DST at\n\n[15]\n\nthat time.) Clarence, his sister Lettie, my sister Hallie, and I were on our way to an area picnic at Squires, Mo. - not that we were in such a hurry, but the preacher was.\n\nBoth rigs were driven to the side of the road and there - the ceremony took place -among beautiful trees and birds singing. It was a gorgeous setting - the sun peeking over the hillside - a country road, stretching thru the valley - no bouquets - no finery - just simple exchange of vows and an earnest prayer by our friend the minister. Each party went their way.\n\nC. E. and I each had a rural school to teach that fall, but of course contracts were seldom signed until the first day of school. I had overheard one member of my board say he did not want to hire a married woman as teacher. (How times do change.) So - knowing this - we decided to keep our marriage a secret for a few weeks at least. Now, you guessed it, the secret didnt keep very long - about three weeks - but the fellows signed without protest. Ha.\n\nSix children were born to this union:\n\nCharles Byron - born December 16, 1916, died December 19, 1916. Born on a homestead in Custer County, Montana. World War I was in its early stages - C. E. had to register and we were pretty sure he would have to go into service so we went back to Missouri. We buried our first born (who lived only 3 days) in a cemetery near Miles City, Montana.\n\nElsie Lee was born November 29, 1917, in her Hicks grandparents home, on Thanksgiving day in the Ozarks. Their address was Silverton, Missouri, but this post office has been discontinued and the address is now Wasola, Missouri, Ozark County.\n\nRobert Earl Hicks was born November 19, 1919, in his parents home in Springfield, Missouri, Greene County. C. E. was a freight car carpenter for the Frisco at that time and when the rail strike came on in 1923 most of the workers went on strike. After several months, many of them had to move on to get jobs to feed their families. A group of C. E.s buddies and he went to Gary, Indiana, where new work was needed, so we moved there. We lived near Hammond, Indiana.\n\nOn June 18, 1924, Marian Joy was born. We called her our little \"Hoosier gal\". We\n\ncame back to the Ozarks in September, 1924, and bought my parents old homestead farm where we lived until 1928. (Alinartha, Missouri]\n\nRuth Aleen was born there on April 10, 1926. The summer of 1928 was discouraged by drought, etc. We bought a 40 acre tract fronting on the then new #5 highway, where we raised chickens and in September, 1928, moved into our first general merchandise store.\n\nOn January 19, 1935, Norman Frank was born - address being Wasola, Missouri, where we stayed until July, 1969.\n\nHICKS CUDWORTH FAMILIES\n\nElsie Lee Hicks and Paul Cudworth were married May 21, 1939, in her parents home -Wasola, Missouri. The minister was Reverend Samuel H. Daniel, of Wasola, Missouri.\n\nThis was the first special occasion -wedding or otherwise - performed in our new \"Y Store\" - store and home combined. The building was made of native stone. After our first store and home burned on December 21, 1938, we built again on the same spot. On May 1, 1939, we moved into the building.\n\nDuring the building process, it became the in\" thing for each worker or visiting neighbor to bring a special rock (their choice) to be fitted into the building. Father Thomas Robert Hicks brought a large basin-shaped rock from their homestead farm. He explained that his mother used to salt the cattle in this basin when he was a boy.\n\nPauls birth date - May 4, 1913. Three daughters - Ava Lynn - born April 24, 1943, Paula Jean - born July 21, 1947, Myra Lee - born April 9, 1951, and a son, Arthur Frank - born April 29, 1946. He didnt live - he was the only boy born in the Cudworth family groups, with the Cudworth name to carry on the name.\n\nOn May 30, 1965, Ava Lynn Cudworth and Merl Dean Hinegardner were married in Stone Chapel at Drury College. Ava graduated from Drury about 2:30 p.m. and the wedding ceremony took place at 6:30 p.m. - Dr. Allan Eikner, head of Religious Education at Drury, performed the ceremony. The couples friend -John Mizell - Dean of Music at The School of the Ozarks and Avas roommate, Miss Sharon\n\n[16]\n\nAlexander, were in charge of the music. The reception was held in the home of Amos and Joy Ledbetter, Avas uncle and aunt. A son, Eric Cudworth, was born on December 29, 1969. Eric C. is Paul and Elsies first grandchild.

The minister? Yes - he\n\nwas \"Marryin Sam\" of Wasola, Missouri. VBH - note here - Brother Sam married C. E. and Viola in 1915 - married Paul and Elsie in 1939, and now Robert and Eva in 1941. Sam married so many couples (they came from far and near) that he acquired the name \"Marryin Sam\". He delighted in this fact -often remarked that he tied the knot so tight that few ever broke it. This proved true in our family thus far - three weddings and today -1972 - only one knot untied and that by the death of C. E. on August 28, 1969.\n\nRobert Earl served in the U.S. Navy about two years - came out with a medical discharge\n\n- World War II.

He and Treena were married on Monday, March 29, 1965. Their daughter, Amber Elaine, (christened Panayota) was born February 7, 1966, in Houston, Texas.\n\nWhen Treena told me about her wedding, she added, - \"We drove to Richmond and were married - then returned to Houston - stopped in a restaurant for a piece of white wedding cake (we called it that), bought our rings - then drove off for a one-day honeymoon. We both had jobs - no more time off.\"\n\nTreenas second husband is Vernon Eblin, born February 12, 1947. They were married October 19, 1973. Vernon has a daughter, Christine, by a previous marriage. Vernons father is from Ohio, and was born in January,________ . His mother is Mary Eblin, born March 19, 1930. Her second husbands name was Roy McCormick (5-10-1917 - 11-14-1973).\n\n*Terry Robert was born in Springfield, Missouri - Baptist Hospital - March 15, 1946. On August 29, 1967, Terry Robert and Sherry Wood were married in a little church in her hometown - Uniontown, Kansas. It was a lovely\n\n[17]\n\nformal affair - a mountain of gifts of about every imaginable use - looked like half of the town population was there. Sherrys birthdate is September 24, 1947. On August 9, 1972, a daughter Kristin Michelle was born to them.\n\nPlease note here - thus far in this project - Hicks lineage - we have seven generations of Hicks males and Terry Robert is the seventh.
