Allen was first elected to the court in 1974. He won re-election in 1982 and 1990. Probably the most significant legal case to come before him was Tennessee Small School Systems v. State of Tennessee. The Small Schools lawsuit, filed in 1988, claimed that Tennessee's funding system for public education violated students' constitutional rights because those in rural schools did not have equal access to the educational amenities and opportunities available to urban students. Allen ruled in favor of the rural school systems in 1991. Although the court of appeals overturned his ruling, the Tennessee Supreme Court later reinstated it, prompting legislators to enact funding reforms sought by the smaller schools. In a 1985 case, Allen's ruling in favor of the executors of Elvis Presley's estate helped establish that celebrities enjoy what has been called a \"posthumous right of publicity,\" preventing others from trading on their names.

He was a co-founder of the Harry Phillips American Inn of Court, a Middle Tennessee legal society. He also helped form the Tennessee Trial Lawyers Association and served as its president in 1970. The impression Allen left on attorneys who practiced before him was evident in the outpouring of reaction to news of his passing. \"Before Allen went on the bench, he was a very effective civil lawyer. Because of his extensive trial experience, it was a pleasure to try cases to a jury in his Chancery Court. Allen was always very polite to lawyers and allowed the lawsuit to be tried without undue interference from the bench. He was admired by all Nashville lawyers,” said Ed Yarbrough, '72, U.S. Attorney for Middle Tennessee. \"He was a people's judge, with a very good judicial temperament. His down-to-earth approach to trials was unique, especially his willingness to let anyone be heard in his court, despite objections from lawyers. He has been missed by the bench and bar since his retirement, and now will be missed by the community he so loved and served,” said George Barrett, '57, Barrett, Johnston & Parsley. Allen was a Nashville native, and the day after he graduated from Hillsboro High School in 1943, his draft notice arrived. He enlisted in the army and joined the 82nd Airborne as a paratrooper. Allen made several combat jumps during the war, including some in Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge. He was awarded the Bronze Star. Nashville attorney Robert Brandt, '66, who served as a chancellor alongside Allen, recalled that he was full of tales about his time in the service. \"Hardly a week went by that he did not tell some great story,\" Brandt remembered. \"One I recall was his capture of a German field marshal when he was 18 or 19 years old. At least that was what he and his buddies thought, the man had on such a fancy uniform. Turned out he was the village police chief.\" After the war, Allen earned degrees from Peabody College and Vanderbilt University Law School. He practiced with the firm of Denney, Leftwich & Osborn in Nashville. In 1958, he was elected as a delegate to the Tennessee Constitutional Convention and in 1967, he was elected to the state legislature, serving a two-year term. Allen retired from the bench in 1995. He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Mary Frances High; their two sons, Nashville attorneys Charles Allen High Jr. and David E. High, and four grandchildren.\n\nColonel George B.

Between his service in WWII and the Korean War, he married his childhood sweetheart, Dorothy Dean Davis, and started a family in Lewisburg. After the war, George returned to Tennessee, earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Tennessee and his law degree from Vanderbilt. After spending a short period in Lewisburg as a judge, George went back to his passion of flying, this time as group commander of the 105 Squadron at Berry Field in Nashville.
