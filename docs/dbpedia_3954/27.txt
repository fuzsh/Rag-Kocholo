Colley Township House

March 2009

This structure was formally designated as a Historical Resource by the Pennsylvania Historical & Museum Commission in March 2009. It was likely constructed in the 1890s by or at least for the interests of James McFarlane, the "father" of the local tanning industry and a prominent local landowner and businessman. In 1903, McFarlane and his wife Augsuta (Lovell) McFarlane sold the building to several prominent local politicans and business leaders for use as a townhouse.

Colley township was not settled as early as many other districts of the county. The first improvements were probably made at the Long Pond about the time the Turnpike was built but it does not appear that these were permanently occupied.

The first attempt to make a permanent settlement in what is now within the limits of Colley township was made by Hugh Bellas of Sunbury. By deed of July 16, 1813, George Lahmer and wife transferred to Mr. Bellas a 1/8 interest in 50 tracts of land on the headwaters of the Loyalsock Creek. In Oct. 3. 1817, he secured the second 1/8 interest in the same lands, and on March 17, 1824, the third 1/8 interest in the same lands, Nov.30, 1830, he purchased a 1/4 interest, thereby holding a 5/8 interest in these lands. July 2, 1832, Mr. Bellas, Joseph B. Anthony and George A. Fick, purchased the remaining 3/8 interest in the 50 tracts of land.

Mr. Bellas was determined to settle his lands and offered liberal inducements to settlers to locate there. The first improvements of a permanent character were made at Shady Nook, three and one-half miles up the Loyalsock from Lopez. Valentine Housewart and brothers, James and John, settled there in 1823 or 1824. The following year, Jesse, Nathan and Absalom Lee settled at Shady Nook. From them the settlement of the head waters of the Loyalsock received the name Lee Settlement, and the road built from the settlement to Long Pond was called the Lee Road.

After remaining one year, James and John Housewart returned to Northumberland county. Henry Rough, a German, received 100 acres of land in payment for work done on the Turnpike and settled near Roughs Pond or Grants Lake on the lands now owned by his son-in-law, John Housewart.

The Hunsingers were among the early settlers in the eastern section of the county, three brothers, George, John and Jacob being among the pioneers. Tradition differs as to the origin of the family. It is claimed by some of the families that they are of French descent and came to America early in the eighteenth century in a French colony that landed at Plymouth Rock, and that, during the Revolutionary War, the colony was broken up, many of the colonists coming to Pennsylvania. In evidence of this theory, Alfred Hunsinger of Colley has in his possession a violin made near Paris, which it is stated was brought from France with the colony and has been handed down through several generations, being finally purchased by Mr. Hunsinger. A few years ago a member of the Hunsinger family of Philadelphia, who was writing a history of the Hunsinger families, wrote to P.W. Hunsinger of Cherry inquiring of the families of that name in this section, and stated that they came originally from France.

The descendants of George Hunsinger claim that he was born in the state of New York, and that he moved from there to Berwick and came to Sullivan county from that place about the time the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike was built as far as the Loyalsock. This would indicate that they came from the New England states with others who composed a large portion of the early settlers of the North Branch valley of the Susquehanna River.

Another theory is that the Hunsingers originally came from the valley of the River Rhine, Germany. It is also stated that John Hunsinger was born in Germantown, near Philadelphia. In evidence of this story is the fact that all of the older members of the Hunsinger families spoke the German tongue, some being unable to speak any other language. It is possible that they are of both French and German origin, and they may have come form that part of the Rhine valley formerly bordering on both countries.

John Hunsinger came from Luzerne county to the Lee Settlement in 1828, purchasing 100 acres of land to the north of Shady Nook. He was a blacksmith and did blacksmithing for those working on the Turnpike when it was being built. In 1848 he moved to the Colley settlement. His children were:

William, died when a young man

Katherine, married Wilson Potter of Colley;

Jerry, of Lee Settlement;

Daniel, settled in Colley;

Taper, settled in Colley;

Hettie, married Rev. Carl Erle;

Alfred, settled in Colley;

Margaret, married Ira Steel of Wilmot township.

Jerry Hunsinger married Hettie Derick of Schuylkill county, PA., and settled on the headwaters of the Loyalsock in the Lee Settlement where he built a sawmill in 1839. To Mr. and Mrs. Hunsinger have been born, Malinda, Maria, Louisa and Almond.

Daniel Hunsinger married Mary Miller of Cherry and settled in Colley township where he died about ten years ago. Their children were Mary Katherine, Wellington, Lawson, Reuben, Solon and Clinton.

Taper Hunsinger settled in Colley on the farm now owned by his son Thomas. He was married twice, his first wife being Mahal Henry, and his second wife Gusta Steel. His children were, C.F., Hannah, Theresa, Jonathan, Thomas, Hettie, Rush and Lizzie.

Alfred Hunsinger married Hannah Reeser, a daughter of John Reeser, one of the early settlers of Cherry township. He is a carpenter by trade and a veteran of the civil war, and was in the service nearly three years. To Mr. and Mrs. Hunsinger were born Addison, Louis, Oliver and Malissa.

Jacob Hunsinger, a brother of John Hunsinger, came from Luzerne county and settled first in Cherry. He later settled at the Long Pond, now called Ganoga Lake, and afterwards moved to Wyominng county. He had one son who lived near Harveys Lake. It is said that he built a section of the Turnpike near Ganoga Lake.

John Santee came from Northumberland county to Lee Settlement in 1838. There is a popular tradition that the Santees were French Huguenots, moving to Holland in 1685 and coming to American in 1690. John Santee was a soldier in the war of 1812. His son, I.S. Santee of Colley, is the only survivor of the family at present living in the county.

Jacob Train settled on the farm later owned by the McCarrolls, probably about 1834. Elias Girvin was also an early settler in that section. About 1840, a German settlement was started just across the county line from the Lee Settlement in Wyoming county.

What is known as the Colley settlement was made along the North Branch of Mehoopany creek in the north section of the township. John Bates was one of the first settlers in this section. John Persun and D.H. Goodwin built a sawmill on the Mehoopany creek soon after 1840, This mill was erected to cut the pine timber of which there was an abundance in the vicinity. Previous to this, a settlement had been made in South Wilmot and a large number came to this fertile and beautiful valley to secure homes between 1840 and 1850.

The Messersmith families have been as prominently identified with the history of Colley township since its organization as any family in the county. Jacob Messersmith, a soldier under Napoleon Bonaparte, came from Germany to America in 1833, landing at Philadelphia. Soon after, he came to Cherry with his four sons, Thomas, Adam, Jacob and George, and settled in the Fuller school district. In 1844, Adam settled in Colley, being followed soon by his brothers, Thomas and George. John Santee and John Hunsinger came from the Lee settlement. Samuel Bahr, Jonathan Colley, after whom the township was named, William W. Potter, Joel Potter and others settled in the valley.

Sciota Run forms a beautiful valley in the extreme northeastern corner of Colley township. This valley was occupied in the latter part of the eighteen-forties by William, Daniel, Dudley and Albert Vaughn. In 1851, Amos Hunsinger bought the J.H. Potter farm and Sylvester Steel and William Shields came to the Colley settlement. In 1852, David N. Oliver, Daniel Mossier and Henry Dieffenbach came to the settlement. In 1854, Christian Mosier settled there and John Dieffenbach of Cherry and his brother Henry of Colley built a gristmill on Mehoopany creek near C.F. Hunsinger's hotel. Henry Dieffenbach sold his interest in the mill and later, in 1863, re-purchased the plant.

The census of 1850 gives the population of Colley township as 175, that of 1860 places it at 388. For the next 20 years, the population of Colley township declined, being 366 in 1870 and 373 in 1880. In 1890, the population had increased again to 1662.

LOPEZ

This busy town takes its name from Lopez Creek which at this point unites with the Loyalsock, Lopez Creek having been named in honor of John R. Lopez, a contractor, who built a section of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike. The place was originally called Tar Bridge from the fact that the bridge crossing Lopez Creek at this place was painted with coal tar to preserve the timber.

The first improvement was made May, 1886, when J.S. Hoffa of Dushore built a sawmill. The same year the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company extended its line from Bernice to Lopez.

D.W. Osler, of Forksville, realizing that a booming town would soon be located at this point, erected a hotel in the winter of 1886-1887. In the year of 1888, Jennings Bros., who were operating a sawmill on Taylor creek near Seamans hotel, moved their plant to Lopez. They enlarged their mill, built a large store and a number of dwelling houses and the town began to boom.

J.S. Hoffa sold his mill to C.W. Wilhelm, who operated it for a number of years. In 1888, Trexler & Turrell purchased a large tract of timber on the Lopez and Panther Den creeks and built a large mill south-east of Lopez. They built large dams and floated the logs to their mill. In 1897, they sold their mill to Jennings Bros, who are using it to cut hardwood lumber. The timber near Lopez was soon cut and Jennings Bros. built and equipped a narrow gauge railroad which has been extended 15 miles into the forests of Wyoming and Sullivan counties with numerous branches to reach the timber of Lee settlement. Later the firm added electric lights to their plant and now furnish light for their mills, store, residences and many other business places in the town.

The first kindling wood factory was erected in 1888 by McCartney & Hall. It was burned down in 1890 and rebuilt the same year by McCartney & Higgins and was operated by them until 1894 when it was sold to the Standard Kindling Wood Co. It has since been destroyed by a fire. In 1895, the Fisher kindling wood factory was built and six months later was destroyed by fire. It was rebuilt in 1896 and again burned down during the same year. Sixty days afterward, the factory was rebuilt and in operation. It was again visited by fire in 1897 and the packing room burned. The damage was soon repaired and the factory is now one of the important industries of Lopez.

The clothespin factory was built in 1894 by J.W. McCartney. It was destroyed by fire in 1896 and was rebuilt the same year. It is at present operated by Jennings Bros.

The North American Coal company leased the Jackson coal lands near Lopez and in 1901 commenced erecting a large coal breaker about a half-mile west of Lopez. The breaker was completed in 1902, having a capacity of 1200 tons per day. The company also built a number of dwelling houses and a large store and expected in a short time to do a very large business.

The growth of Lopez has been marvelous. A switching crew is kept constantly busy doing the local switching, the shipments of lumber, bark, coal, clothespins and kindling wood being very heavy.

The town of Lopez has at present four hotels, the Lopez House with James P. McGee proprietor, the McKibbins House, H.W. McKibbins proprietor, the McDermott House, Henry McDermott proprietor and the Loyalsock Hotel, Julia Jackson proprietor; three restaurants conducted by John H Yonkin, William E. Steafather and Reed G. Frutchey, respectively.

Jennings Bros. conduct a very large general store and employ a number of clerks. C.A. Johnson and H.J. Castle each conducts a store and are doing a prosperous business. Jacob Per, of Hughesville, has a branch clothing store at this place. H.M. Kellogg is the proprietor of a well-stocked jewelry store and he and Dr. Christian run in connection with it a drug store. A.L. Dyer conducts a meat market and livery. D.W. Pealer a shoe and harness shop. W.L. Johnson, Lawrence Dunn and L.R. Carrington each have a fine barbering business. J.P. Gorgg runs a wholesale liquor store. Dr. J.L. Christian looks after the health of the town.

The people of Lopez take great pride in their schools and in the few years of the towns existence have equipped a school of six grades, and since 1899 have each year graduated a class from the high school. A school was established at the Murray mines in 1902.

There are four churches that conduct regular religious services in the town. The United Evangelical under the pastorate of Rev. T.J. Hower and the Protestant Methodists presided over by Rev. Josia Smith have each erected a handsome edifice in which to worship. The Lutherans hold services in the M.P. Church, Rev. J.M. Smeltzer, of Ricketts, being the pastor. Rev. J.A. Enright of Mildred holds regular services here for the Roman Catholics in this section.

The population of Lopez is nearly 1,000.

RICKETTS

The Bowmans Creek Branch of the Lehigh Valley railroad was extended to the county line in 1891, and through to Wilkes-Barre in 1892. In 1891 the present town of Ricketts was started. In 1891 the Albert Lewis Lumber company built a sawmill and lumbered about one year. The same year Trexler & Turrell commenced erecting a very large mill equipped with the most modern machinery. They have built many miles of railroad to haul the logs and bark from the woods. The firm has also a large store, and a stave and excelsior factory. About 150 men are employed in manufacturing lumber. In 1891 a large hotel was erected.

The town is on the county line. The greater portion consisting of the hotel, depot, store and a large number of dwellings, is located in Wyoming county. The sawmill and a number of mill houses are in Sullivan county. The Lutherans have a fine church, Rev. Smeltzer being the pastor. The United Evangelicals have also a congregation and hold services in the Lutheran church. There is a school of two grades in Sullivan county and a school of one grade in Wyoming county.

GANOGA LAKE

This summer resort has been very popular for many years. Improvements were made at the point when the Turnpike was built and buildings were erected for the accommodation of travelers. There is no record that the place was kept up. In 1852 the present stone house or hotel was built and in 1870 it was started as a summer resort. A large wooden building has since been erected to accommodate the large number who come to the resort each summer. The lake is a beautiful sheet of pure water and all the land surrounding is owned by R.B. Ricketts of Wilkes-Barre. No buildings have been erected except the depot and those used in connection with the hotel business as a summer resort.

COLLEY

For a number of years the town of Colley, if such it may be called, has been doing considerable business. But the business places are scattered so that it can scarcely be called a town. At Colley Corners there is located the store of G.D. Dieffenbach, who also conducts the post office. The Evangelical church is east of the store, and west a short distance is the hotel of C.F. Hunsinger. There are also a number of dwellings houses here. G.S. Landback has a store and sawmill about one mile west of the Corners. Arthur White conducts a blacksmith shop. The farmers of Colley have erected a large Grange hall and have had a prosperous lodge for many years.

** Editor's Note: In June 2007, Dale Berger, the author of the Mackes-Meckes Genealogy Page, provided additional information and corrections on the Johnson-Hawk lineage as follows:

The family of Diana (Hawk) Johnson is listed on page 435 of "Genealogy of Conrad and Elizabeth (Borger) Hawk" by Atwood James Shupp (Gateway Press, Inc., Baltimore, 1990). This Hawk genealogy shows that Diana's father was Timothy Hawk, b. 9 Jul 1840 and d. 16 Oct 1869. Timothy is buried in Salem Church cemetery at Gilbert in Monroe Co., PA. The dates on his tombstone agree with the dates in the Hawk genealogy.

For Diana Hawk, the Hawk genealogy shows a date and place of birth of 12 Oct 1866 in Gilbert, Monroe Co., PA. No sources are given for this information.

Bob Mackes, the former genealogist for the Meckes/Mackes family, found that Diana was born in Oct of 1865 in Carbon Co. I believe that information probably came from the marriage license of Diana to Clarence A. Johnson (Sullivan County marriage license #1685, vol. 1, pg. 422). Since Albrightsville is in Carbon Co., she could have been born there.

The mother of Diana Hawk was Catharine Meckes (1845-19 May 1892). About 1871, after the death of Timothy Hawk, Catharine married Anthony Schuch (22 Dec 1847-28 Feb 1901). Anthony was also from Carbon Co., PA. Catharine and Anthony are both buried at Bahr Hill (aka. Fairview) Cemetery at Dushore, Sullivan Co.

Based on the information presented in the Hawk genealogy, I have changed the name of Diana's father from "Unknown" to "Timothy Hawk" in the Meckes genealogy. I have also removed the statement about whether or not Timothy Hawk and Catharine Meckes were ever legally married. Since Catharine did not marry Anthony Schuch until 1871, two years after Timothy's death, I think they were probably married. These changes will be on RootsWeb and Ancestry. com with the next update I post to those sites.

The "Mrs. Robert Hawk", mentioned in The Sullivan Review of 13 May 1897, was Sallie Ann (Burger) Hawk (27 Dec 1839-7 May 1897), wife of Robert Hawk (14 Mar 1839-31 Mar 1913), who was a brother of Timothy Hawk, father of Diana (Hawk) Johnson. Diana would have been Sallie Ann's niece, not her daughter. The obit is in error on that point. Robert and Sallie Ann (Burger) Hawk are also buried at Dushore.

At Fairview, the note with the transcription for "Sally" Ann Hawk (1839-1897)is that she was the wife of "Robinson Hawk"; this is a transcription error. Robert Hawk, her actual husband, is shown in the Federal Census for Lopez in 1900 as widowed and living with his daughter Stella Hawk, age 18. Another family headed by Liander Hawk is also shown in Lopez in this census report; we are not certain if they are related families.

BURTON L. KEENEY

Was born in Braintrim township, Wyoming county, in 1840, a son of Ezra Keeney. Richard Keeney, an ancestor, came from Connecticut with the early settlers of Wyoming Valley. Mr. Keeney lives on a farm in Sciota Vale where he has lived the past six years. He enlisted in Co. I. 6th Pa. Reserves and was in the service four years during the Civil War.
