Go To Minor League Statcast Search

Baseball Savant’s search page allows you to query MLB’s Statcast database on a per-pitch, per-game, per-player, per-team, and per-season basis. Definitions for each Statcast metric may be found in the MLB Glossary.

Some of these queries are very complicated and take time to run. If the page doesn't fully load, refresh the page and try again.

Pitch velocities from 2008-16 are via Pitch F/X, and adjusted to roughly out-of-hand release point. All velocities from 2017 and beyond are Statcast, which are reported out-of-hand.

For the limited subset of batted balls not tracked directly, estimates are included based on the process described here.
