        "text": "yerf\n\nKelly Peters (Terzy, Sabine) —2/3 >\n\nSort by: name - date (newest)\n\nQuick doodle I did as a gift for Chris Goodwin (aka my hero). I just realized that his eye is confusing . . . it's not a big goofy eye with a little black pupil, it's a little pupil-less eye with a white patch above it. My fault. Abe is © Chris Goodwin\n\nabe.jpg - 2003-09-23\n\nFanart for Chris Goodwin. I worship Goodwin, yes I does. Edited for Yerfability.\n\nabelinedottyclean.jpg - 2004-01-09\n\nOnce I begin an image, I need to finish it SOON. If I don't, I will lose interest and never touch it again. That's what happened with this image, which is an illustration from the Aesop's fable, \"The Owl and the Grasshopper.\" Besides, I really hate how the owl came out, so blah.\n\naesopgrasshopper.jpg - 2003-09-22\n\nI uploaded this sketch into photoshop with every intend of just playing around with the color scheme before going to work on the real thing with watercolor. It quickly progressed into something more. This is for October's Secret Santa, for Territhyme. I still may do this in watercolor, but I thinnnk I may have gotten it out of my system. We'll see.\n\namani.jpg - 2004-10-26\n\nfirst page of my new sketchbook. I took some liberties with the coloration, but I like it better this way. Reef fish RULE. Marker, colored pencil and goo-gone on sketchbook paper, woot.\n\nangelfish.jpg - 2004-11-18\n\nFor Anna the Snail Lady, queen of coolness. Really, her stuff is just incredible. And I am REALLY happy with how this came out. Except the paper got kinda warped. India ink, watercolors on Bristol board. Image © Kelly Peters, Snail Lady © Anna Peirucinni.\n\nannacolorclean.jpg - 2003-11-20\n\nA'ceops and his ladyfriend, Balnamaris, for this week's trading post. This was so fun to do!\n\nauncolordone.jpg - 2003-11-13\n\nThe first and best real media piece I've done in a while. Started out with just a gradated wash, then threw in a lotus, decided a betta would look kind of spiffy. ALl very stream of conciousness kind of thing. I love my aquarelle/arches 140 lb hot press brilliant white acid free watercolor paper!\n\nbettalotusflat.jpg - 2004-04-19\n\nAnother airbrushed t-shirt. Woo. This was entirely freehanded. No sketch, no preliminary thumbnails, nottink. Shows, don't it?\n\nblackcat.jpg - 2003-09-26\n\nI know, I know . . . he's not black. Well, I wanted to do a grumpy persian, and he ended up coming out greyish-pink. Deal with it ^_^\n\nblackcatfat.jpg - 2003-10-17\n\nGuess what, ladies and germs? Time for more t-shirts! I like the colors in this one. I like them ALOT.\n\nblackcatpink.jpg - 2003-10-17\n\nAnother variation of Bud. This was the first shirt, and the best as far as looking like the actual dog.\n\nbudbrew.jpg - 2003-10-17\n\nSee, the deal with these shirts is that I am selling them to a local coffeehouse, which then sells them and gives me 60% of the sales. There are alot of different coffees, and I am doing shirts for most of them. This, as you can see, is Bud's Brew. Bud is a dog who belongs to one of the owners. The top sellers right now are Black Cat Blends, Bud's Brews, and Old Louisville Blends. I will try to only put my best ones up here. This here is one of my favorite B.B.s I may make one for myself.\n\nbudsbrew3.jpg - 2003-10-17\n\nI try not to upload many oekakis, but I am just really proud of this image. I like doing funky things with lighting, and I really like how the background came out as well. It's Sadie at the carnival! Yay!\n\ncarnysadie.jpg - 2003-11-05\n\nI recently did a series of Alice in Wonderland themed images in watercolor and india ink. Hope this is OK to upload, seeing as how it has a human in it ^_^\n\ncheshiresmall.jpg - 2003-09-22\n\nAn image of Chespi Cheeta for Erin Middendorf, when she was the Trading Post Mistress. I always have fun with styles like this, whee! Chespi is © Erin Middendorf\n\nchespi.jpg - 2003-09-23\n\nThe 17 year cicadas are coming out here in Louisville. I sat at a bus stop that was covered in them! I love cicadas, even if they are noisy little things, so I did a picture of one. I need to figure out a good background image or something. Painter 8\n\ncicadabg.jpg - 2004-05-20\n\nPlayed around in OC with Bastek last night . . . this image works best if you picture it to the left of her picture, which outta be below this one somewhere (the space dog with the galactic hackeysac).\n\ncoondrunk.jpg - 2004-03-18\n\nI did this for my buddy walker, who is the undisputed king of drawing women with guns. Her legs are WAY TOO LONG, but I still am pretty fond of this image. That is the best gun I have ever drawn.\n\ncoongun.jpg - 2003-09-28\n\nFor Ursula. NOW look what you've started! Teh cute is overwhelming!\n\ncuteness.jpg - 2003-10-15\n\nUrsula Vernon's recent upload of an absolutely precious hedgehog made me remember this little fella. I love him. The writing may now be considered meaningless, though, since Ursula's hedgy far surpasses him in terms of cuteness.\n\ncutestdillo.jpg - 2003-10-15\n\nWhnever I find the finished original of this, I'll take this one down. For now, here is the dodo from Alice in Wonderland. I did this back in late 2002! Watercolor and india ink, here . .\n\ndodosmall.jpg - 2004-08-20\n\nDid this without ever easing or using the undo function. Think it came out kind of nicely, so here is a strange little dragon scribble.\n\ndragondoodle.jpg - 2004-02-09\n\nAn image of a dragon I am working on in my sketchbook. Whenever I finish it, I'll take this down and put up the final version. I guess I just wanted to show ohw spontaneous all these patterns are . . . I don't plan any of them out, I just take a sharpie and some microns and go to town. Colored with Trias.\n\ndragondots.jpg - 2004-07-12\n\nIt is impossible to scan a t-shirt without having it look warped. In reality, this image is a perfect rectangle. Oh well. Airbrushed Dragon T-Shirty Goodness, yes.\n\ndragonwell.jpg - 2003-09-26\n\nA looooooong overdue commission for a very patient, friendly, and understanding customer. This is the edited version of the original. I love how this came out! Eira the ring-tailed cat does a drunken jig on top of the bar, while the other patrons look on.\n\neiraclean.jpg - 2004-10-17\n\nOld pic, finished sometime last year . . . some pretty bad anatomical errors, but I still am rather fond of it. I love fall ^_^\n\nfalldog.jpg - 2003-09-24\n\nJust something I doodled last night. I love dragons. And having alot of styles.\n\nfatdragon.jpg - 2003-09-26\n\nThis started out as a design for a linoleum print. And then I colored it.\n\nfoxtheifcolor2.jpg - 2003-12-08\n\nExperimenting with Linedots in other mediums.\n\nfrogjester.jpg - 2004-11-09"
