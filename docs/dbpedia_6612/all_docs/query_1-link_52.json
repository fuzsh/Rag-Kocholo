        "text": "The trailer for Pia Marais’ “Transamazonia” has debuted ahead of the film’s world premiere in competition at Locarno Film Festival. “Transamazonia,” which will have its North American premiere at New York Film Festival, is being sold in international territories by The Party Film Sales. WME Independent is handling North American rights.\n\nThe film centers on Rebecca, the daughter of missionary Lawrence Byrne. Rebecca was declared a “miracle” after she survived a plane crash as a child, deep in the Amazon Forest. Years later, she has become a miracle healer, sustaining their mission thanks to her growing fame. But when illegal loggers invade the land belonging to the indigenous people they’re evangelizing, Rebecca’s father manoeuvers them into the epicentre of this escalating conflict.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nAislinn Clarke's 'Smart Horror' 'Fréwaka' Scares Japan and Spain Ahead of Locarno Premiere While Being 'Unapologetically Irish': 'Emotion Is Universal' (EXCLUSIVE)\n\nCannes Camera d'Or Winner César Diaz Heads to Locarno with Bold Bérénice Béjo-Starring Title 'Mexico 86'\n\nTarsem Singh Unveils 4K Restoration of 'The Fall,' Discusses Creative Process and Plans for 'The Cell'\n\nIn a statement, Marais said: “In this feverish setting, I wanted to work loosely with elements of suspense and genre. In moments to create an uncanny dream atmosphere. Somehow drawing inspiration from films like Brian De Palma’s ‘Carrie,’ or Hitchcock’s ‘Marnie,’ we follow a central character, Rebecca, who has yet to fully grasp who she is.\n\n“I have always been fascinated by female characters who in order to function in their world, have to repress a part of themselves. Even keeping it hidden from themselves. It was therefore important that Rebecca maintain something unreal, like a facade. A child healer, who functions as a projection, and who finds herself growing up and coming of age. She arrives at a conclusion herself. In a gently resolute way, she turns the tables on her father and re-purposes herself.”\n\nThe film stars Helena Zengel, Jeremy Xido, Joao Vitor Xavante, Pira Assurini, Hama Luciano and Sabine Timoteo. The screenplay is by Marais, Willem Droste and Martin Rosefeldt.\n\nThe film was produced by Cinema Defacto, Gaïjin and Aldabra Films, in co-production with Pandora Film Produktion and Point Productions; in co-production with Volos Films, Vitamine C, O’Par and Cabocla Filmes; in association with Cinema Inutile, Tigresa Filmes, Matizar Filmes, Moonduckling Films and Jazzy Pictures; and in co-production with Arte-WDR and RTS Radio – Television Suisse, in association with ARTE/Cofinova.\n\n“Transamazonia” is Marais’ fourth feature film. Her feature debut, “The Unpolished,” won the Tiger Award at the Rotterdam Film Festival in 2007. “At Ellen’s Age” screened in competition in Locarno in 2010, and at more than 30 festivals, including Toronto. “Layla Fourie” premiered in competition at the 2013 Berlinale, receiving a Special Jury Mention. In 2018, she made her first documentary, “Cari Compagni,” for Arte.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney+ in August 2024\n\nWhat's Coming to Netflix in August 2024"
