        "text": "Another Piere Strydom masterclass. That’s the only way of describing the ride by our evergreen multiple champion on Joey Soma’s Dual Prophecy in the third at Turffontein on Saturday.\n\nThe year younger full-brother to KZN champion See It Again did everything to get out of shedding his maiden ticket.\n\n“I owe him one. If Striker doesn’t ride him, he doesn’t win. That’s the simple fact of it. And it just goes to show there’s nothing wrong with being a senior citizen. He’s still hungry,” mused veteran trainer Joey Soma with a broad smile as he reflected on a ride that oozed class and experience and was a rare display of Striker using the crop, and to good effect.\n\n“He showed no acceleration previously. So we thought let’s go further and the blinkers went on. He won the race in the last 20m. He could just as well have run nowhere – that’s the way he felt even late in the race,” Piere Strydom told the Sporting Post afterwards.\n\nPart owner Allan Preddy, who responded to a pre-race question as to whether they fancied Dual Prophecy, with a, “yes, but the only problem is that our father is riding the horse!” was quite apologetic afterwards, and said that he’d never doubt his trainer and jockey again!\n\nRacing in a partnership of ANOA (Pty) Ltd (Nom: Andria Dannhauser), Allan Preddy, Joe Soma and Sandy Wilson, Dual Prophecy, who shed his maiden here at his fifth start, is clearly going to have to lift his game somewhat to even walk in the shadow of his illustrious brother See It Again.\n\n“He was hanging in over the final 200m. It helped that the front horses were stopping, and I was focused on straightening him in the final stages as we already had the leader,” explained Piere.\n\nWith 2 winners in 3 days, the 58 year old Pierre Strydom’s new season strike-rate is currently 50%, and he’s relishing the opportunities.\n\n“With all the top younger guys riding overseas, there is definitely an opportunity here. I just have to ride sufficient horses to maintain my fitness. My weight is good, and I’m still enjoying it,” he added.\n\nPiere is currently contracted to ride for Arun Chadha and Warne Rippon’s ASSM Syndicate until end September.\n\n“Riding the ASSM horses is a big plus as it also gives me ongoing access to the top stables. I am meeting with them later this week, and will then see where we go from there,” he added.\n\nTrainer Michael Roberts said over the weekend that Dual Prophecy’s illustrious brother See It Again is likely to be aimed at the Betway Summer Cup at end of November.\n\n“I have no doubt he will relish the long Turffontein straight, as he does the Hollywoodbets Kenilworth summer course. Things just didn’t pan out in the HKJC Champions Cup. We couldn’t let Dave The King get too much of a lead, but I couldn’t have See It Again too close to the pace either, as he doesn’t run like that. So it didn’t work out. He could be a serious prospect at Turffontein, though,” suggested Piere.\n\nThe third race at Turffontein on Saturday enjoyed its fair share of drama, beyond the Striker genius.\n\nOn arrival at the start, Gavin Lerena expressed concerns regarding the soundness of the Azzie’s Storm Ahead, and despite the Vet giving him the all-clear, Lerena chose not to ride the gelding.\n\nJason Gates replaced Lerena and landed up running third. During the loading process, Splashlanding kicked the back gates and was withdrawn by the Vet."
