        "text": "The rave horse is coming to Paris.\n\nThe internet's favorite dressage sensation, five-time US Olympian Steffen Peters and his party-loving horse, Suppenkasper ('Mopsie'), are back to bust some moves at the Olympic Games Paris 2024.\n\nIn Tokyo 2020, the internet lost its collective mind over Mopsie's dance skills, and the pair went viral for their equestrian EDM routine. Their biggest fan? None other than the D-O-double-G himself, Snoop Dogg.\n\nSnoop Dogg on Mopsie, the \"Crip-Walking\" horse: “I gotta go meet him.”\n\nSnoop, who has signed on to commentate at the Paris Olympics, has one event circled in red on his calendar: equestrian dressage.\n\nIn a recent interview with Jimmy Fallon, Snoop said he most looks forward to watching the equestrian events. And, despite having the best Olympians in the world present, who is Snoop most excited to meet? Mopsie — the horse that can \"crip-walk\" better than most humans.\n\n\"I gotta go meet him, you know what I'm saying?\" Snoop said, with his signature cool. \"And let him know I'm a big fan. You know, the way you do when you meet your favorite person.\"\n\nThe impending meeting between Snoop and Mopsie promises to be an Olympic highlight, and it might just break the internet all over again.\n\nAnd with breaking making its Olympic debut in Paris, maybe Mopsie can join the breakers for a crip-walk on the dance floor, showing off his hoofwork alongside the best in the world.\n\nMopsie, the floor is yours.\n\nTeam USA dressage at Paris 2024\n\nPeters and Mopsie earned a score of 80.968 and a 10th-place finish in the individual event in Tokyo, just one day after the pair rode to a team Olympic silver. Peters, who will celebrate his 60th birthday on 18 September, has been selected for his sixth US Olympic dressage team. This makes him the oldest American competitor since some 1936 art competitors and the oldest non-art competitor since Stockholm 1912's double Olympic champion shooter, Walter Winans.\n\nUSA Equestrian announced the full dressage team on 25 June. Joining Steffens in Paris are Adrienne Lyle, Marcus Orlob, and Endel Ots.\n\nThese elite dressage athletes will take the historic Château de Versailles starting on 30 July. Who knows what routines these riders will bring to this royal venue?\n\nWith a team full of talent and flair, the stage is set for an unforgettable display of equine ballet, elegance, and perhaps a touch of Mopsie's signature dance moves.\n\nDiscover the full Paris 2024 equestrian schedule here\n\nRead the Team USA announcement here\n\nAs National Olympic Committees have the exclusive authority for the representation of their respective countries at the Olympic Games, athletes' participation at the Paris Games depends on their NOC selecting them to represent their delegation at Paris 2024.
