Had apprentice claims on that day but now in-form jockey Bruno Queiroz hops aboard and could improve once again. Drawn out.\n\n2nd Pick: SANTINO (3)\n\nGood run behind Legend Of Niagara last start when in a competitive class 5 filled with horses dropping back in grade. Now finds a suitable race and should look to find cover from the outside gate.\n\n3rd Pick: SMART ONE (4)\n\nLead them up last start over 1600m and now drops back to a more preferred distance. Curatolo sticks aboard and he is proven on the all-weather Poly track. Watch the market.\n\n4th Pick: VGOR (6)\n\nStormed home for a strong win last start in this grade. Krisan stays onboard and draws out wide. Should look to get back and power home. Could see betting support again.\n\nRACE 2\n\n1st Pick: SMOKE AND MIRRORS (5)\n\nA proven 1400m horse with plenty of upside in this grade. He should look to get back and flash home. He comes into this race off a light break and will see support in the market.\n\n2nd Pick: SUMMER WIND (2)\n\nBeen racing so well over 1400m most recently and could spice up this field. Last start he was very keen in the run. Stable is in great form, and they have two leading chances here.\n\n3rd Pick: ACE SOVEREIGN (1)\n\nHe finished third to Lim’s zoom last start in a busy finish and now steps up to 1400m where he has recorded a win and multiple placings. Could go close again.\n\n4th Pick: FORTUNE WHEEL (3)\n\nHe won well two stats back in this grade and was only fair most recently, should look to sit more forward and come into the race earlier. He was one-paced last start but could bounce back here.\n\nRACE 3\n\n1st Pick: NIMBUS CLOUD (3)\n\nComes here with a nice draw and some good form to his recent starts including a recent trial win. Looks well weighted and can be there at the finish.\n\n2nd Pick: LIM’S PUNCAK JAYA (1)\n\nCC Wong takes the steer on this four-time winner who is yet to win at the 1700m but has great stats on the Polytrack over a mile. Expect late support in the market.\n\n3rd Pick: ROCKY (5)\n\nGets a plum draw in one where he can position up nicely in the early running. He is back to the same rating of 51 that saw him win just over a year ago. Looks good value here.\n\n4th Pick: GREEN STAR (4)\n\nStill showing some ability the now eleven-year-old and finished second behind Nimbus Cloud in a recent trial. Could be a quartet filler.\n\nRACE 4\n\n1st Pick: PACIFIC SONIC (1)\n\nHas one of the stronger form lines leading into this race after winning last start defeating Lucky Hero. Now will find it harder drawing out in barrier twelve and will carry top weight.\n\n2nd Pick: WIND OF DUBAI (2)\n\nHe was only fair last start behind Pacific Sonic and got caught too far back in the run. CC Wong retains the ride and will need to try and sit closer in transit. He’s had excuses in the past. Okay.\n\n3rd Pick: THUNDER STAR (6)\n\nThings didn’t go to plan last start in the same race behind Pacific Sonic, jumped slow and mustered up to sit on speed, couldn’t hold the gallop and faded in the straight. Could bounce back.\n\n4th Pick: THE WILD PRINCE (9)\n\nHuge run last start, sat up on speed and stuck it out to the finish getting into second behind Delilah. Watch for any betting support.\n\nRACE 5\n\n1st Pick: THE WILD FIRE (3)\n\nStrong win last time out, looping the field and storming down the outside, won with plenty of merit and could back it up in the same grad here. Should be well supported.\n\n2nd Pick: MY DETERMINATION (4)\n\nHe’s been a great horse for connections but always finds one better on the day. Only a one-time winner with multiple placings but should be right in this. Market is the best guide.\n\n3rd Pick: APRIL (1)\n\nNot a bad return from this guy last start, sat just behind the speed and stuck on a placing behind Pacific Star. Should trip fitter from the run and take natural improvement out of that. Still lightly raced.\n\n4th Pick: KHAO MANEE (8)\n\nOkay behind Shihab last time out, didn’t handle the corner well and balanced up a long way off the leader. Race didn’t go to suit and stays at 1600m. Okay.\n\nRACE 6\n\n1st Pick: STRIKE GOLD (2)\n\nAfter some promising runs on the turf, he stepped out and beat a highly rated class four field at the start of last month. He looks a much sharper sprinter on this surface and deserves respect.\n\n2nd Pick: NIMBUS STAR (4)\n\nStill a maiden in Singapore after twelve starts but gets plenty of advantages in this race including a gun draw in four and recent placings behind some promising types.\n\n3rd Pick: FILIAL DRAGON (3)\n\nBeaten a neck to the speedster Last Samurai a few weeks ago and was hitting the line better than anything in that field. Probably should have had a few more wins to his name and looks well placed here.\n\n4th Pick: SURREY HILLS (1)\n\nWas heavily supported in betting last weekend where he found the line well and gave the stable five winners for the day. The quick seven-day turnaround is the big query.\n\nRACE 7\n\n1st Pick: SUPER BOWL (2)\n\nHe’s been a solid competitor in class 4 and hasn’t been beaten far in his last couple of runs over long distances. He is going to be backing up once again but now comes into class 5 and should find this easier.\n\n2nd Pick: SACRED COMMAND (1)\n\nWas in the same race as Super Bowl when behind Red Dragon and drops down to a more reasonable grade. He is proven at 1700m on the Poly track. Watch betting.\n\n3rd Pick: THE WILD CHIEF (3)\n\nHuge win two weeks ago, he stays in the same grade and on the Poly track but will meet tougher opposition this time around. Could surprise. Key player.\n\n4th Pick: NAVY SEALS (6)\n\nLead the field up over 2000m last time out and stuck on nicely for minor placing. Now switches onto the Poly track for a first time in a while.\n\nRACE 8\n\n1st Pick: PACIFIC PADRINO (1)\n\nLooks prime this weekend to turn those recent minor placings into a win with CC Wong booked to steer and will get a lovely run from barrier three. Should be short in the market and rightly so.\n\n2nd Pick: OCTOBER (3)\n\nThis gelding has had a real turnaround in form and both recent wins with a combined winning margin have been 7.5 lengths have been in sharp style. Will need a touch of luck from barrier ten this Sunday.\n\n3rd Pick: ARYA PAKUAN (6)\n\nHe is a two-time winner from his last four starts including a strong victory upstaging Pacific Padrino who looks a key player in this event. Can surprise down in the weights again.\n\n4th Pick: AMAZING BREEZE (5)\n\nLooking for his first win since May 2022 but has a string of minor placings. Some of his best career runs have come at this course and distance so give him a look in this.\n\nRACE 9\n\n1st Pick: BIG UNION (4)\n\nOne of Singapore’s best performers over the last few months that have accumulated four wins and going from Maiden grade to class three in quick succession. Not many here do that.\n\n2nd Pick: ANIKI (1)\n\nReturned to the Polytrack with a nice second placing after a stint in group company against his own age group. He showed good early speed in that last run and should do the same from the wide draw.\n\n3rd Pick: LORD’S COMMAND (9)\n\nHas caught the eye during the week with some strong trackwork and gets our leading jockey Bruno Queiroz and an unbeaten course and distance record. Big watch.\n\n4th Pick: DANCING LIGHT (8)\n\nReturned to class four with a great win over Surrey Hills back in June. Even though he has placed at class three level he does look better suited to class four when he gets back to that grade.\n\nRACE 10\n\n1st Pick: PACIFIC COMMANDER (3)\n\nGets the inside draw with CC Wong booked to ride. Didn’t begin all that well last start and never looked comfortable in the run. Senior rider goes on and has great stats in these conditions.\n\n2nd Pick: LAST SAMURAI (1)\n\nThe speedster got back to winning ways last start with Queiroz who retains the ride. Goes up five rating points from that win and has never won carrying more than 58kgs before.\n\n3rd Pick: LIM’S BIGHORN (2)\n\nHas a great career record that sees four wins including a Group three victory and two minors from eight starts. His last two starts have been sharp and the Polytrack suits him here. Must respect the Meagher/Lerner combination.\n\n4th Pick: PER INCROWN (7)\n\nCould be the value player in this race with some nice eye-catching runs at his last couple behind Ravalli and War Star. He has six wins and ten minor placings to his name over this course and distance. From our leading stable watch for betting.\n\nSource: https://www.goldcircle.co.za/singapore-race-analysis-1-sep-24/\n\nDavid Thiselton\n\nThe Vaal straight course meeting today should see high draws being favoured in all races except for the fourth race over 2000m, which is the only race around the turn.\n\nThere are two interesting runners first-timers in the first race. The Mike de Kock-trained Wilgerbosdrift and Mauritzfontein-bred Fire Away filly Fireburst, who is by Fire Away out of De Kock’s Gr 1 Allan Robertson and Gr 1 SA Fillies Sprint winner Rat Burana. That makes this filly a half-sister to the Gr 2 SA Fillies Nursery winner Maharanee and to the Gr 3 Poinsettia Stakes winner Marigold Hotel. A further boost is that she has a high draw of eight in the 1200m race and in form Gavin Lerena is up. The Lucky Houdalakis-trained Lancaster Bomber filly Shadow Of The Moon is a half-sister to the Gr 1 Cape Flying Championship winner Dyce. The horse to beat on form is Hey Hey Julia , who has some fair form over 1000m and now tries a step up to 1200m. She is by Canford Cliffs out of a Querari maiden who only once ran beyond 1000m, but she is a half-sister to the Vercingetorix filly Lady Luck, who won over 1400m this week.\n\nIn the second race over 1200m One And All enjoyed the step back down to 1160m last time and could be in the shake up here with a repeat of that second place finish. In his earlier sprint he faced Cosmic Speed and was not disgraced with an eight length fifth. He is drawn on the right side. Pursuit Of Fame has become hard knocking since blinkers were fitted and gets a fair opportunity here from a high draw with Gavin Lerena up. Captain Clever was well beaten on debut but finished third to a horse who was subsequently disqualified and is not without a chance if low draws turn out to be not too disadvantageous. Takeyourbestshot ran a fair third last time but has a tough number one draw by trends. Solar Sail returns from a layoff and has the standside draw and looks capable of improvement.\n\nIn the third race over 1600m Captain Jim has been ultra consistent since headgear has been applied and is distance suited and has a draw towards the right side of six out of ten, so with Lerena up for the Fabian Habib yard he should have a fine chance in this line up. Red Legend has some useful form and is distance suited but the draw of four out of ten might be a bit tricky. Roll Of The Dice is moderate but from a high draw is not without a chance in this line up if producing his best.\n\nIn the fourth over 2000m Millahue has talent over middle distances and so was most disappointing on Saturday on the Turffontein Inside track when a 7,65 length eighth of ninth over 1800m. However, he will appreciate the extra 200m and will relish being on a course with a long straight so can do well from pole position, being just 0,5kg under sufferance with the best weighted. Strewn Sky has run well in all three post maiden runs and is distance suited and has a fair draw of five out of nine with in form Khumalo up, but he is 1,5kg under sufferance with the best weighted. Thunee Player is proven over this trip and is in good form, but does have to overcome draw eight and is 1,5kg under sufferance with the best weighted. Imperial Master is officially the best weighted runner and has been in fine form since blinkers were applied and has a shout from draw three, despite now being a seven-year-old. Flying Bull has his second run after a layoff and if he produces his best he could be a player from a good draw under Gavin Lerena.\n\nIn the fifth over 1500m Cartanega is improving and caught the eye with her maiden win when running on well. She has caught the eye before that too and starts off handicapping off an attractive mark of 61 and is drawn on the standside. Calida improved without blinkers last time and could be involved. Risky Business goes for a hattrick but does have to overcome a five point raise. Zoombomber has the form and ability to be a contender. Perini Palace won her maiden well and is drawn on the right side.\n\nIn the sixth over 1500m Boom Boom is on the up and off a four point higher mark for her last win is drawn on the right side and has in form S’Manga Khumalo up. Deception Pass is progressive and won easily on the KZN poly last time and from a high draw off a reasonable 78 merit rating can go close. Shinto Shrine should narrowly beat Deception Pass based on their last clash and he has a fair draw of nine. Rock Of Bismantova is in fine form and can’t be ignored. Nordic Rebel is eleven years old but still going strong and should go well for Gavin Lerena again from a high draw.\n\nIn the seventh over 1100m Secret Chord is in fine form and should enjoy this trip and has a nice high draw. Nkandla Gold has plenty of speed and ability and should be in the shake up if able to overcome a potentially tricky low draw. Vegas Hi Rise is in good form and is distance suited and has a fair draw. Kashkaval returns from a layoff but is in fine form and over this trip could do well fresh but a low draw is a concern. The Navy Lark has a lot of speed and will be setting the fractions from a high draw, but can she hold on over 100m further than her optimum 1000m trip.\n\nIn the eighth over 1100m Written In Stone has always had a lot of ability and showed it last time despite being a nine-year-old so he could follow up under the same rider from a plum high draw. Twice As Wild, Red Carpet Girl and Ashanti Sword have to be considered. For wider Jet Cat from a standside draw could be worth including despite also now being a nine year old.\n\nSource: https://www.goldcircle.co.za/fireburst-to-give-punters-a-boost/\n\nDavid Thiselton\n\nThe Listed Betway Spring Spree Stakes, to be run over 1200m on Turffontein Inside on Saturday, welcomes in the Highveld Spring feature season and is usually a rewarding race for those who do their homework.\n\nBack In Business could be the one to side with in this year’s 1200m event on Turffontein Standside. Joe Soma has always held this William Longsword gelding in high esteem. He lost his confidence due to a starting stalls incident when ‘bolting’ with the jockey still on under dubious circumstances. That saw him having to be rested from September to December last year when he should have been progressing into a feature candidate.\n\nNevertheless, he proved his class last time when cruising in by 2,25 lengths at this course over 1450m. Before that he had audaciously been entered in the Gr 1 Wilgerbosdrift HF Oppenheimer Horse Chestnut Staks over 1600m, which showed just how high he is rated. He was beaten out of sight, but that probably just proved he did not stay the trip, so he will enjoy this step down to 1200m just over six weeks after that last win.\n\nBack In Business showed an exceptional turn of foot in that 1450m win to come from off the pace and slice through the field like a hot knife through butter, and that was despite being a little bit keen early, which suggests he will enjoy the step down to 1200m. A draw of six will be just about perfect and Muzi Yeni stays aboard. He was raised six points for that last win, but only has to carry 53kg and can progress beyond that merit rating.\n\nQuantum Theory won this race last year and although he is five points higher in the merit ratings, he was drawn nine last year and this year is drawn three. He comes off a good win over 1160m, where he showed a lot of resolve to get up, and his odds of 20/1 in that race signalled that it was a return to form.\n\nReady To Charge won well over 1160m in March before being slow away from the unfavourable number one draw in the Gr 1 Jonsson Workwear Computaform Sprint. A line can be drawn through that race and as those last two runs were preceded by a trip to Cape Town so he deserved a break. Over this trip he could get away with running fresh from a fair draw of five and he should come into his own this season, being by Gimmethegreenlight out of the classy Australian-bred speedster San Fermin (Charge Forward).\n\nChyavana is consistent and reliable over this category of trip. He is only two points higher for his last win and the only concern is his draw of nine out of eleven.\n\nZinovi has a lot of speed and class and was only hampered early in his career by breathing issues. However, he had two good wins after a ‘wind op’ and his only run since was in the Gr 1 Golden Horse Sprint where he was under sufferance. He has to carry topweight but is drawn well in four and has the class as well as the help of Piere Strydom, although this is his first run for three months.\n\nSilent War could be dangerous from pole position as he has a good turn of foot and the ability to find extra when necessary. However, he looks held by Quantum Theory on their last meeting over 1160m, although that was probably a below par run and he can do better.\n\nHalberdier is 2,5kg under sufferance and has a tricky draw of eight and also looks held by Quantum Theory on their last meeting. However, he showed what he is capable of in his penultimate start over 1100m when beating Quantum Theory by 2,25 lengths on terms that were actually 1kg worse than what he faces him on here.\n\nGuy Gibson has class and a good turn of foot. He has not been seen out for six months but is drawn well in two and has inform Gavin Lerena up. Running fresh over a trip too sharp he should be finishing strongly.\n\nCliff Hanger has pace and a kick and should come into his own this season so is interesting, but it is his first run for three months and he has a wide draw of ten.\n\nFire ‘N Flames can’t be ignored because in his last win three runs ago he put up a devastating display over this trip down the straight. However, he is unreliable as is shown by his next two starts when last in both of them.\n\nThunderstone is 1kg under sufferance and is up against it from the widest draw of all having not run since finishing 5,30 lengths back in tenth in this race last year.\n\nThey are selected in the order mentioned.\n\nSource: https://www.goldcircle.co.za/back-in-business-in-spring-spree/\n\nDavid Thiselton\n\nSouth African graduates of the South African Jockey Academy often make the news overseas but the man currently making waves in the U. K. is former Summerveld trainer Dylan Cunha.\n\nOn the jockey front noteworthy overseas news in the return to the winner’s enclosure of Australia-based Donovan Dillon.\n\nLast week Cunha had a good third in a big handicap at York his Brocklesby-winning two-year-old Sensorium and the horse earned a cheque of £61,000.\n\nOn Monday Cunha scored an exacta in a seven furlong maiden for two-year-olds at Chepstow with two cheap buys, one of whom was making his debut.\n\nThe Make Believe colt Louie The Legend was bought at the Tattersalls September Sale for £8,000 and went off at 7/2 today in a 16 horse field on the turf, having finished fourth and second respectively in two previous seven furlong events on the Newcastle and Chelmsford All Weather tracks.\n\nThe Ardad colt Dapper Gee Gee was bought at the Tattersalls December foal Sale for £15,000 in 2022 and then for £16,000 at the Tattersalls December Yearling Sale last year. However, he was unsold at the Tattersalls Guineas Breeze Up Sale this year, before apparently being purchased into the Cunha yard for a mere £3,000.\n\nLouie The Legend was backed in from an opening call of 5/1.\n\nHe was prominent early and led narrowly three furlongs out. He was then pushed along and hung left under pressure two furlongs out. However, he kept on well to win by three-qarters of a length under Ray Dawson.\n\nDapper Gee Gee opened at 28/1 before touching 20/1 and starting at 22/1.\n\nHe was midfield in the running before making headway over two furlongs out. He pressed the leaders a furlong out and went second in the final 110 yards and then ran on under George Wood. He should be in the winner’s enclosure soon.Cunha has now had 39 wins in all in the U.K., having started out with just two horses about two years ago, so he has made a meteoric rise in the toughest of environments.\n\nDonovan Dillon has made a welcome return to the winner’s enclosure in Australia after being out for a long time due to a serious injury.\n\nHe said in February this year that his absence from race-riding since October 2023 had been due to a horse kicking him in the thigh and tearing the muscle off the bone.\n\nHe added at the time, “It has been a crazy ride since we’ve been here. I’m not racing as much as I used to, small yard but massive name that we are behind (Arrowfield Stud). We have a couple of months left before we can apply for permanent residency and once that happens I think things open up a lot more and we will have a lot more freedom. I will obviously still work for Arrowfield in the mornings, but I will be looking to ride in races seven times a week. I’m trying to get my weight right down to a natural 54 to 55kg so I can freelance and race all day everyday. I have put it in my sights that I want to go for the title in 2024/2025. I do think I can accomplish that with the racing I’ve had here already.”\n\nHe made his comeback on July 29.\n\nHowever, he is still awaiting his permanent reisdency and has only had five rides in all this year, including winning on the Paul Messara & Leah Gavranich-trained Mikki Isle filly Brok Cafe in a 1300m event at Scone last week on Monday.Donovan extracted a strong finish from Brok Cafe from last place in a small five horse field to get up in the final couple of strides. He is now three from three on Brok Cafe.\n\nIn Donovan’s first season in Australia (2022/2023) he had 9 wins at a strike rate of 33.3% and he had a place strike rate of 70.4%.\n\nThe talented former KZN Champion Apprentice and South African Jockey Academy headboy will be a rider to follow once he gets that long awaited permanent residency.\n\nHis wife Tayla has been doing very well working for a neighbouring stud farm to Arrowfield called Ridgmont, which is not related in anyway to the South African Ridgemont.\n\nSource: https://www.goldcircle.co.za/sa-expats-making-the-news-overseas/\n\nDavid TIhiselton\n\nThe Asian Racing Conference commences today (Tuesday) in Japan and runs until Sunday and four South Africans are scheduled to speak, NHA CEO Vee Moodley, MD of SOUTH African Equine Health and Protocols (SAEHP) Adrian Todd, Executive Chairman Of Cape Racing Greg Bortz and CEO of 4Racing Fundi Sithebe.\n\nMoodley, Todd and Bortz are all talking in the session Developments: Big Changes Across The Asian Racing Federation (ARF) Footprint.\n\nThe NHA’s biggest change recently has been the attempt to tackle the abuse of TCO2. This was generally welcomed by trainers but soon led to controversy with some race favourites scratched, leading to unhappiness among punters to the extent that on one occasion it caused the abandonment of a big race meeting. It has also led to confusion as horses who have definitely not been “milkshaked” were often shown to be over the limit. However, recently the number of scratchings due to elevated TCO2 levels has dropped dramatically, with not a single case happening last week. This suggests the NHA are winning the battle against those trying to seek an advantage, while trainers are also playing ball by researching possible reasons for isolated elevated level cases. Moodley will certainly have a lot to speak about on the subject.\n\nAdrian Todd will welcome the opportunity to at last speak about what has happened rather than what he hopes will happen. Direct flights for Equine exports from South Africa to Europe are now a reality with the first one in 14 Years, carrying 32 horses including three racehorses, having landed last weekend in Belgium. Another one is set to follow in September. This has opened great opportunities for SA racehorses to be tested against the best around the world. It is also a great boon for SA breeders, as there will likely be increased support from overseas buyers at our sales, and with owners now also having the potential for lucrative overseas prize money the prices at sales could continue to increase too. It is also good news for overseas breeders as SA buyers will return to some of their sales. Todd will have a lot to divulge on this topic, particularly as the announcement of direct flights led to a wave of optimism across the board in the SA racing industry.\n\nGreg Bortz gets a first opportunity to speak at the Asian Racing Conference since forming a partnership with Hollywoodbets and reviving Cape Racing from down and out to thriving in the space of a few months in 2022. This was the single biggest injection of positivity into SA racing in recent times and the industry has been on an upward trend ever since. Bortz and Hollywoodbets are now close to being in control of KZN racing which includes a rescue package that saves it from pending bankruptcy. Bortz’s input is not just about endless money keeping a failing entity going. It incorporates a plan towards self sustainment. In the Cape this includes developing a 365-day-a-year, 24/7 lifestyle and entertainment complex at Kenilworth racecourse, where the sport and stakeholders will benefit, as well as the local community. This development was already well under way last year. The innovative ideas and energy of the partnership, whose unofficial motto is to do rather than talk about doing, should continue in similar vein in KZN. Bortz will no doubt reveal the latest progress and plans in a session that will be much looked forward to at the Asian Racing Conference.\n\n4Racing is also on an innovative streak, including the Betway Summer Cup becoming the richest race in the land with a recently announced R6 million stake. 4Racing’s CEO Fundi Sithebe will be talking in a session entitled “Achieving Wellbeing & Inclusivity From The Track To The Boardroom.”\n\nThe feedback the SA speakers bring back from the conference is also looked forward to by industrymen and the racing public.\n\nSource: https://www.goldcircle.co.za/sa-speakers-at-the-asian-racing-conference/"
