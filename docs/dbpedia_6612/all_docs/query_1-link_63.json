        "text": "Are teenagers really missing part of their brain?\n\nSabine Peters has investigated how the development of cognitive and affective brain regions relates to learning and risk-taking behavior. Brain regions for cognitive control can be recruited by children and adolescents.\n\nAlternative medicine and the placebo effect\n\nA lot of money is spent on alternative medicine, even though there is no scientific evidence that its benefits are anything more than a placebo effect. But if it makes patients feel better, is there actually anything wrong with these treatments?\n\nNeuroscience in the classroom?\n\nNeuroscientific results are increasingly popular amongst teachers. But what does it mean if children with learning disabilities show less activity in a certain brain area, and can we really use this information in the classroom?\n\nCan thinking of a professor really make you smarter?\n\nDiederik Stapel's fraudulent practice has highlighted the importance of replication in psychology. Does the famous study of Ap Dijksterhuis, which shows that thinking of professors improves test scores, survive a replication attempt?\n\nWhy we eat cows (and sometimes horses), but not dogs\n\nMost people in Western culture have no problem with eating cows, pigs and chickens. However, the idea of eating dogs tends to disgust us. Why do we make such mental distinctions between ‘animals for eating’ and ‘animals not for eating’?"
