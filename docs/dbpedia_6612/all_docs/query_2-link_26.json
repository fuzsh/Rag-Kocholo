        "text": "Björn thank you for the link to the Key which is awesome. But I disagree a little with it about Xema. Leach did not call the bird Sabine's Xeme. He made a Latin genus name out of a bird John Ross gave the common/English name of Xeme. ...\n\nMark, I'm not sure I understand what you're looking for, and \"disagree a little with\" ... ?\n\nToday's (as well as yesterday's) Key [my blue]:\n\nXEMA\n\n(Laridae; Ϯ Sabine's Gull X. sabini) Coined from substantive name “Sabine’s Xeme” given to Sabine’s Gull by Leach 1819. Brookes 1828, has ...\n\n[...]\n\n\"Genus XEMA. Leach (Xeme). THIS genus approaches to the GULL in the form of its beak, and to the TERN in having a furcate tail as well as in the general form and proportion of its legs; the only species hitherto discovered is the following: — Species XEMA SABINI, (Sabine's Xeme, non-descript) LARUS SABINI (Sabine).\" (Leach 1819); \"Xema Leach, in Ross' Voy. Disc., 1819, app. 2, p. lvii. Type, by monotypy, Larus sabini J. Sabine.\" (Peters, 1934, II, p. 326).\n\n[...]\n\nIsn't Appendix, No. II (Zoological Memoranda), in Ross's A Voyage of Discovery, (vol II, 1819) simply written by Dr Leach... ?\n\nPlease enlighten me (us) ...\n\n/B\n\nIsn't Appendix, No. II (Zoological Memoranda), in Ross's A Voyage of Discovery, (vol II, 1819) simply written by Dr Leach... ?\n\nI understand the introduction of this Appendix (pp. [xxxix] - xl; obviously written by John Ross himself) as telling us that it was written by John Edwards and Charles James Beverley (\"For the following Article I am indebted to\" etc.).\n\nIn the same text, Ross goes on explaining that he expected a report on natural history to be written by Edward Sabine, which Sabine did not do.\n\nHe then declares himself \"incapable of filling up [this] blank\" -- hence he can presumably not be assumed to have actively taken part in the writing of the text.\n\nLast, he thanks Leach \"for the kindness with which he revised and corrected the report\".\n\nIf Edwards, Beverley & Leach are made joint-authors of the Appendix, the new names attributed to Leach alone in it have Leach alone as their author (which is conform to current usage). Beyond the names that are explicitly attributed, it may not be possible to determine who added this or that word to the text."
