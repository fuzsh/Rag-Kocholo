        "text": "If you are looking for songs similar to Echoes:\n\nPink Floyd (Indeed one of the greatest bands of all time; certainly a favorite of mine after The Beatles)\n\nShine On You Crazy Diamond [Parts I-IX] from Wish You Were Here (More than 25 minutes of pure, absolute genius)\n\nSheep from Animals is not as haunting and calm as Echoes, but it is certainly a thrill. (10 more minutes of greatness)\n\nUs and Them from The Dark Side of the Moon (A very calm song if that is what you are looking for)\n\nKing Crimson\n\nEpitaph from In the Court of the Crimson King (Amazing song from an extraordinary album. King Crimson pioneered progressive rock in '69 when Pink Floyd were more psychedelic)\n\nSimilar bands to Pink Floyd:\n\nYes: They have a different approach to progressive rock, but they are great as well with amazing albums such as Fragile and Close to the Edge.\n\nEmerson, Lake, and Palmer: A superb progressive rock trio, check out their Trilogy album.\n\n*Keep in mind that most progressive rock band members changed constantly, so some albums are slightly different. This is mostly the case of King Crimson, whick rocked its first album, but almost everybody except the lead guitar left afterwards, and they did not have a commmercial hit until their fourth album, Red, with another shift in personnel.*\n\nWhat you have discovered is love for golden age progressive rock, when songs were not just calm and mesmerizing, but the lyrics were also deep, meaningful and they were complemented by extraordinary music!\n\nNot many people appreciate such beautiful music nowadays, so good to see such love for one of my favourite bands.\n\nSome similar bands/artists and their songs you may like are:\n\nPorcupine Tree - Russia on Ice, Trains, Arriving somewhere but not here. A good progressive band from the relatively recent times (the 90s).\n\nThe Doors - When the music's over, Hello I love you, Riders on the storm, Light my fire, L.A. woman, The Ghost Song. Psychedelic music at it's best.\n\nThe Who - Won't get fooled again, Baba O' Riley, Who are you, Behind blue eyes.\n\nOasis - Champagne supernova, Wonderwall, Don't look back in anger.\n\nDire Straits - Brothers in arms.\n\nOther long, deep progressive songs you might like:\n\nDogs, Shine on you crazy diamond (all parts, don't listen to them separately, it's a 26 minute masterpiece), by Pink Floyd.\n\nIn the court of the Crimson King, Starless, by King Crimson.\n\nFirth of Fifth, by Genesis.\n\nListen to any Pink Floyd songs from the Syd Barret era (their earlier works were more psychedelic owing to Syd's contributions), you might like them. If you like listening to guitar (you just might), try something from Steve Vai or Joe Satriani. Keep discovering great music, cheers.\n\nA lot of people will say, \"Oh. Pink Floyd. OK, here's a bunch of Prog Rock bands.\" And they're kinda wrong. Pink Floyd was not like Yes or Genesis or ELP, because Pink Floyd were really more (much more) of a Blues-based band. And as much as I love the genre and the bands in it, there really wasn't another band similar to Pink Floyd in that genre. Not too many Prog bands really grooved like Floyd.\n\nEchoes, in particular, was probably more similar to the live versions of Stairway To Heaven (Feb 14, 1975 comes to mind), especially the solo section.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJxpOZ6XIZ4\n\nIf you're going to compare it to Yes, I'd say maybe Ritual is somewhat similar; although the frenetic sections are much more frenetic, the mellower sections have somewhat of a bluesy feel to them. But, again, Yes couldn't swing if they were sitting in a hammock. The music is there, the groove is not.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJzzBUKTFQQ\n\nDirect Answer To Your Question:--\n\nPorcupine Tree, Riverside, and Anathema are relatively mainstream bands that are very similar to Pink Floyd.\n\n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3lsqUqGTzM)\n\nDon't underestimate David Gilmour's solo career.\n\n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtsG5eAZj0c)\n\nNotable but Forgotten Bands:--\n\nMore obscure bands or artists that deal with in psychedelia are: maudlin of the Well and Leigh Stephens' solo career. The band, mauldin of the Well, is notable for having songs inspired by lucid dreaming and similar practices.\n\n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cBXtwvsYo)\n\nThe 13th Floor Elevators is another obscure band that is important in the development of psychedelic rock.\n\nOther References:--\n\n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rock)\n\n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_rock)\n\nDefinitely check out Porcupine Tree. Especially their earlier stuff such as the albums the sky moves sideways or signify. Basically anything by them from the 90's but especially those two from that time period. The few albums that are a bit later are good too but at some point they started to get a bit more metal(starting with In Absentia which is still great but leaning towards a heavier sound on some tracks).\n\nI also recommend these bands for the Floyd sound. Eloy(their mid to late 70's albums in particular such as silent cries and might echoes have a very Floyd vibe and were obviously influenced by WYWH. Some long tracks on those albums. Also, the bands Nektar, RPWL, Camel and Airbag.\n\nThere are plenty more. Go to progarchives and do a search for bands similar to Pink Floyd. As was mentioned you will mostly find what you are looking for in the progressive rock genre but there are some newer indie and post rock bands who are influenced by PF also."
