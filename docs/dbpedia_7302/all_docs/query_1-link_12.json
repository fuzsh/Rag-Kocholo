        "text": "I searched for any Pink Floyd topics in this forum, but searching yielded no immediate results, so I will start this one. This is the discussion topic for Pink Floyd and related musicians, like Syd, David and Roger's solo careers as well.\n\nPink Floyd are, in my opinion, the best English band ever and an amalgamation of some of the best musicians who ever lived. Their musical maturation is fascinating to observe from album to album. Syd Barrett was a genius and even The Madcap Laughs is a fantastic and quirky work. Roger Waters is a kickass bassist and the band went to crap without his songwriting. Richard Wright is responsible for the amazing atmosphere generated by some of their greatest albums and was a fucking fantastic keyboardist, RIP. David Gilmour has a great singing voice and the emotion oozes out of his guitar, he is the archetype of what many guitarists strive to be. Nick Mason's drumming was never quite the main focus of the music, but his work on Piper and Ummagumma is perfection.\n\nSo, anyone want to talk Floyd? I'm listening to The Wall right now actually.\n\nI love Pink Floyd!\n\nSyd Barrett: creator of the basic Pink Floyd sound, and mightbe a even greater genius if he hadn't fallen apart. R.I.P.\n\nRoger Waters: great bassist, not to mention excellent songwriter. Developed the sound of the band. The one from whom came the band's best efforts.\n\nDavid Gilmour: one of the best guitarists ever! Not to mention a great singer. His solos are some of the best out there.\n\nRick Wright: what can I say? Great keyboardist! R.I.P.\n\nNick Mason: great drummer. Very underrated.\n\n,\n\nJo\n\nHow's it going \"MisterMcLov1n?\" I LOVE PINK FLOYD! I own all of their albums and I have seen them live 5 times.\n\nDo you own any PINK FLOYD albums on CD by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (MFSL)? I own all four PINK FLOYD albums by MFSL and are as follows:\n\nThe Dark Side Of The Moon\n\nMeddle\n\nAtom Heart Mother\n\nThe Wall\n\nAll of these albums are in the ORIGINAL MASTER RECORDING, ULTRADISC series on 24 KT. Gold CD's. If you want the ultimate best sound quality ever by PINK FLOYD, buy these albums on e-bay, you won't be sorry. These Gold CD's might be very expensive, but once you hear them, you will know exactly where your extra money is going. This is the very best sound quality that you are ever going to hear on the great PINK FLOYD. Take care and ROCK ON FOREVER my friend.\n\nHis voice hasn't changed much in 40 years. He sings a little lower on the scale now than before, but it doesn't change the complexity of the songs at all. In fact, it makes them sound better. I saw him in Chicago on his On An Island tour and in between hoping I wouldn't pass out and trying not to hyperventilate, I was able to actually hear him sing and it was heavenly."
