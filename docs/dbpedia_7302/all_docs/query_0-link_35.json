        "text": "Pink Floyd is the brightest and most memorable band of the 60s. It is on this musical group that all British rock rests.\n\nThe album \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" sold 45 million copies. And if you think that sales are over, then you are deeply mistaken.\n\nPink Floyd: We Shaped the Music of the 60s\n\nRoger Waters, Syd Barrett and David Gilmour were part of the main line-up of the British group. And the most interesting thing is that the guys have known each other since childhood, because they studied at neighboring schools.\n\nThe idea to create a rock band came a little later. It took several decades before the whole world heard the first compositions of ambitious guys.\n\nA little about early work Pink Floyd\n\nThe musical group included:\n\nS. Barrett;\n\nR. Waters;\n\nR. Wright;\n\nN. Mason;\n\nD. Gilmour.\n\nFew people know that the musicians Pink Anderson and Floyd Council became the \"fathers\" of the legendary band. It was they who pushed the then young Barrett to create the Pink Floyd group. And they acted as a powerful \"motivator\" for novice musicians.\n\nIn 1967, an example of the best psychedelic music of the late 1960s was released. The first album is called Trumpeter at the Gates of Dawn. The released disc in the literal sense of the word blew up the world of rock. For a long time, the compositions of the album occupied a leading position in the British chart. And we have to admit that it is well deserved. Prior to this, listeners were not familiar with such \"juicy\" psychedelic compositions.\n\nA year after the release of the legendary album, Barrett was forced to retire. His place at that time was taken by the talented and ambitious David Gilmour.\n\nThe history of the early Pink Floyd is divided into two parts: with and without Barrett. The reasons for Barrett's departure from the group are still unknown. Most music experts and critics agree that he had an exacerbation of schizophrenia. But, one way or another, it is this man who stands at the origins of Pink Floyd, releasing the legendary album Trumpeter at the Gates of Dawn.\n\nPeak of fame Pink Floyd\n\nIn 1973, an album was released that turned the idea of ​​​​British rock upside down. The Dark Side of the Moon took the British rock band to the next level. This album includes not just conceptual compositions, but a work that examines the problem of the pressure of modern society on the human psyche.\n\nThis album contains compositions that \"make\" not only enjoy the beautiful rock music, but also think a little about the meaning of human life. The compositions \"On the Run\", \"Time\", \"Death Series\" - it is easier to find those people who do not know the words of musical works.\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon album remained on the chart for over 2 years. It was he who became the best-selling album of all time. Such popularity could only be dreamed of by young musicians.\n\n\"It's a pity that you're not here\" - the second album, which brought unheard of popularity to the guys. The songs that were collected in the album revealed the acute problem of alienation. This also included the most talked about composition called “Shine on, crazy diamond”, which was dedicated to Barrett and his mental disorder. \"It's a pity that you're not here\" for a long time remained the best-selling album in the UK and America.\n\nIn 1977, the album \"Animals\" was released, which immediately came under fire from critics. The songs that were collected on the album reflected the appearance of the members of modern society by using metaphors in the form of pigs, cows, sheep and dogs.\n\nAfter some time, the world got acquainted with the rock opera \"The Wall\". In this album, the musicians tried to reveal the problems of pedagogy and education. They have succeeded in it. To verify this, we recommend listening to the song \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\".\n\nWhy and when did the band break up?\n\nOn August 14, 2015, the legendary British band announced the termination of their musical activities. David Gilmour himself announced the dissolution of the team. According to David, the group has become obsolete, modern compositions were not so juicy.\n\nFor 48 years, Gilmour spent as part of the group. And, in his opinion, it was the most “golden time”. “But now this time is over, and the activity of our group is completed,” the musician said. David Gilmour willingly gives interviews and shares his advice with young musicians.\n\nPink Floyd was and remains the most successful and influential rock band. The music of the performers influenced the rock movement. For example, David Bowie claims that it is the music of British artists that is his personal source of inspiration. Rock fans are still crazy about Pink Floyd songs. The works of rock musicians can be heard at various rock parties."
