        "text": "Roger Waters is a British musician, singer, songwriter, and composer, best known as the co-founder and bassist of the legendary rock band Pink Floyd. Born in 1943 in Surrey, England, Waters grew up in Cambridgeshire, where he met his future Pink Floyd bandmates.\n\nIn 1965, Waters, along with Syd Barrett, Nick Mason, and Richard Wright, formed Pink Floyd, one of the most influential bands in the history of rock music. Waters played a vital role in the band’s success, writing some of their most iconic songs such as ‘Another Brick in the Wall,’ ‘Money,’ and ‘Comfortably Numb.’\n\nWaters’ songwriting style often deals with social and political issues such as war, poverty, and corruption. He is known for his poignant and thought-provoking lyrics that resonated with audiences around the world.\n\nWaters’ solo career began in 1985 with the release of his debut album ‘The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking.’ The musician has since released several successful albums, including ‘Amused to Death’ and ‘Is This the Life We Really Want?’ He has also toured the Pink Floyd classic album ‘The Wall’ as a solo artist.\n\nAside from his music career, Waters has been a political activist for many decades. He has been a notable advocate for Palestinian rights, speaking out against the war in Iraq, and was a vocal critic of the Trump administration.\n\nWaters is also known for his immersive live performances, often featuring stunning visuals and elaborate stage productions. His highly successful ‘The Wall’ tour, which began in 2010, was once the highest-grossing tour by a solo artist.\n\nIn recognition of his contributions to music, Waters has received several prestigious awards, including induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Pink Floyd."
