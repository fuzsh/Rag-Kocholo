With their unique, psychedelic soundscapes and thought-provoking concept albums, they left an indelible mark on the music industry.\n\nWith a career that has lasted over 50 years, it comes as no surprise that they have had a strong influence over many bands that followed them, and many people love their work.\n\nSo if you love Pink Floyd and want to find some similar bands for your playlist, look no further. Our list of 13 bands like Pink Floyd, will help you find the perfect one. Read on!\n\nRelated: Check out our list of famous prog rock bands here\n\n1. Tame Impala\n\nLed by multi-talented musician Kevin Parker, Australian band Tame Impala has carved out a distinct musical identity since its inception in 2007. Their psychedelic pop music is similar to Pink Floyd’s early work but with their own contemporary pop and electronic influences.\n\nThe band has released four studio albums. However, as a testament to their amazing work, all have landed in the top five of Australia’s chart, while the last two—Currents and The Slow Rush—also peaked in the top ranks of Billboard 200.\n\nSingles such as “The Less I Know the Better,” “Borderline,” and “Lost in Yesterday” showcase their innovative songwriting, with the latter song receiving a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Song.\n\n2. Porcupine Tree\n\nAn English band like Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree seamlessly flows between psychedelic rock and progressive metal across its ten full-length studio albums, making them an excellent choice for fans of Pink Floyd.\n\nPorcupine Tree was formed in 1987 by Steven Wilson as a solo project initially intended to be an elaborate joke about the history of a fictional band. It eventually evolved into an open group with members Richard Barbieri (keyboards), Colin Edwin (bass), and Gavin Harrison (drums) joining later on.\n\nThe band gained critical acclaim for their blend of experimental music styles, drawing inspiration from various genres like progressive rock, ambient music, alternative rock, and even heavy metal.\n\nOver the years, they’ve released 11 studio albums, with the latest being Closure/Continuation, which landed at the second spot of the UK Albums chart.\n\n3. Yes\n\nNext up is another English rock band called Yes. Formed just three years after Pink Floyd, they originally released pop-rock-oriented albums. Later, their sound changed to showcase a more progressive rock edge, much like Pink Floyd’s.\n\nYes gained widespread acclaim with albums like Fragile, Close to the Edge, and 90125—all three reaching the top five of the Billboard 200 chart. Their notable hits include “Roundabout” and “Owner of a Lonely Heart.”\n\nOver the years, Yes have undergone several lineup changes but continued to release albums and tour extensively. To this day, they remain a revered and influential force in progressive rock.\n\n4. King Crimson\n\nOriginating from London in 1968, King Crimson is a pioneering progressive rock band that shares similarities with Pink Floyd in their experimental soundscapes and intricate compositions.\n\nLed by guitarist Robert Fripp, the band’s ever-changing lineup has contributed to their diverse and influential discography. Their debut album, In the Court of the Crimson King, is a psychedelic rock masterpiece featuring classics like “21st Century Schizoid Man” and “Epitaph.”\n\nBoth Pink Floyd and King Crimson have a penchant for blending rock with avant-garde and jazz elements, creating immersive sonic journeys for their listeners.\n\n5. Gong\n\nEstablished in Paris in 1967, the Gong is an avant-garde progressive rock band with solid psychedelic elements, founded by Australian musician Daevid Allen.\n\nGong’s most well-known and acclaimed period came with the Radio Gnome Invisible trilogy from 1973 to 1974, which consisted of the albums Flying Teapot, Angel’s Egg, and You.\n\nThese albums introduced the fictional mythology of “The Pot Head Pixies” and explored themes of spiritual awakening, intergalactic travel, and social commentary.\n\nThe band’s sound during this period incorporated complex musical arrangements, improvisation, and a blend of rock, jazz, and psychedelic elements. Fans of Pink Floyd’s psychedelic rock era will appreciate Gong’s unconventional approach to music.\n\n6. The Moody Blues\n\nFormed in 1964, British rock band The Moody Blues rose to fame alongside Pink Floyd, who formed in 1965. And like Pink Floyd, they were also known for their progressive rock and psychedelic sound.\n\nThe same year the band was created, The Moody Blues released a cover of “Go Now” by Bessie Banks. The song was an immediate success, becoming #1 on the UK Singles chart and #10 on Billboard Hot 100. Since then, they’ve continued to release charting tracks and studio albums, gaining fans all over the world.\n\nUnlike Pink Floyd, The Moody Blues’ career lasted until 2018, but their legacy has stayed strong. That same year, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n7. Emerson, Lake & Palmer\n\nThough the English supergroup Emerson, Lake & Palmer (ELP) did not have as psychedelic a sound as Pink Floyd, they were renowned for their progressive rock style.\n\nFormed in 1970, the group consisted of keyboardist Keith Emerson, bassist, and vocalist Greg Lake, and drummer Carl Palmer. They gained significant popularity during that decade with albums like Tarkus, Trilogy, and Brain Salad Surgery.\n\nELP went on hiatus in the late 1970s, came back together in the early 1990s, and disbanded in 2010. Still, the band left a lasting impact on the progressive rock genre, and their music continues to be celebrated for its technical prowess and ambitious arrangements.\n\n8. Hawkwind\n\nFounded in London in 1969, Hawkwind is a space rock band with a strong psychedelic influence. Fans of Pink Floyd’s expansive, atmospheric sound will appreciate Hawkwind’s cosmic approach to rock.\n\nThe band was formed by singer-songwriter and guitarist Dave Brock. Over the years, the lineup has included notable musicians such as Lemmy Kilmister (later of Motörhead), Nik Turner, and Robert Calvert. Brock remains the only constant member throughout the band’s history.\n\nIn their five-decade career, Hawkwind has released 35 albums and 22 singles. Notable hits fans of Pink Floyd might be interested in are “Silver Machine,” which landed the third spot on UK’s Singles chart, “Urban Guerrilla,” and “Shot Down in the Night.”\n\n9. Caravan\n\nIn 1968, British rock band from Canterbury, England, Caravan, broke onto the progressive and psychedelic rock scene. They share similarities with Pink Floyd in terms of their lush melodies and intricate arrangements.\n\nCaravan’s music is often referred to as part of the Canterbury scene, a subgenre of progressive rock that emphasizes melodic, complex compositions and a playful, often eccentric, approach to songwriting.\n\nTheir 1971 album In the Land of Grey and Pink includes standout tracks like “Golf Girl” and “Nine Feet Underground,” helping to push the band to fame throughout the decade and well into the 1980s.\n\n10. Amon Düül II\n\nHailing from Munich, Germany, Amon Düül II was formed in 1968 and is considered a leading force in the Krautrock movement.\n\nTheir debut album, Phallus Dei, was released in 1969 and showcased their innovative and eclectic sound. It was followed by a series of well-received albums—Yeti in 1970, Tanz der Lemminge in 1971, and Wolf City in 1972.\n\nAmon Düül II gained a cult following in Germany and other parts of Europe but had limited commercial success outside of their homeland. However, their influence paved the way for subsequent bands in the krautrock and progressive rock genres.\n\nTheir music continues to be admired by fans of experimental and psychedelic rock. Fans of Pink Floyd might resonate with their style.\n\n11. Genesis\n\nNext up is English prog rock band Genesis. Formed in 1967, the band was founded by singer Peter Gabriel, guitarist Anthony Phillips, bass guitarist Mike Rutherford, keyboardist Tony Banks, and drummer Chris Stewart.\n\nOver time, the lineup saw several changes, with Phil Collins joining as drummer in 1970 and later taking over as lead vocalist after Gabriel’s departure in 1975.\n\nIn the 1980s, Genesis shifted to a more pop-oriented sound. Their eponymous 1983 album perfectly captures the change, as the music features a blend of prog rock and pop. During this decade, too, Genesis achieved great success, with their albums landing in the top spot of the UK Albums chart.\n\nLike Pink Floyd, Genesis has had a lasting influence on music, blending various styles and creating memorable songs, cementing their status as one of Britain’s most influential bands.\n\n12. Soft Machine\n\nPenultimate on this list is Soft Machine, a pioneer of British progressive rock. Formed in 1966, the band’s music featured experimental rock and psychedelic influences.\n\nOver the years, the band went through various breaks, lineup changes, and even name changes. Their sound also evolved, edging closer to jazz and progressive rock that fans of Pink Floyd can appreciate.\n\nNotable albums from Soft Machine that Pink Floyd fans might want to explore are their eponymous debut album and Third, released in 1970, which contains the standout track “Moon in June.”\n\n13. Spiritualized\n\nFormed in 1990 in Rugby, England, Spiritualized is a space rock band led by singer-songwriter Jason Pierce. With their unique blend of psychedelic rock, gospel, and ambient music, Spiritualized creates lush, hypnotic soundscapes that evoke a sense of transcendence.\n\nPierce formed Spiritualized after the dissolution of his previous band, Spacemen 3. As the primary songwriter, vocalist, and guitarist, he has been the band’s central figure throughout its history.\n\nTheir critically acclaimed 1997 album Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space features the memorable songs “I Think I’m in Love” and “Come Together.” Fans of Pink Floyd’s atmospheric and immersive sound will find a similar sonic experience with Spiritualized.\n\nSumming Up Our List Of Bands Like Pink Floyd\n\nExploring bands like Pink Floyd can be a journey into the depths of psychedelic rock, progressive metal, and concept albums.\n\nTame Impala offers a modern take on this genre with their dreamy soundscapes, and Porcupine Tree takes listeners on an introspective journey through their music, while Yes is another pioneer in the prog-rock genre that has stood the test of time.\n\nIf you want to expand your musical horizons beyond Pink Floyd, these 13 bands are a great place to start.
