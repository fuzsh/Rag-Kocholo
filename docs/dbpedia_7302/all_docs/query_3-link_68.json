        "text": "Formed in the mid-1960s in London, Pink Floyd became Britain’s first psychedelic rock band and one of the earliest bands to use a light show onstage. Known for playing lengthy sets and for having fantastic special effects, Pink Floyd achieved great success with Dark Side of the Moon (1973), which stayed on Billboard’s album chart longer than any previous album in history.\n\nPink Floyd’s original members were founder and guitarist-vocalist Syd Barrett (born Roger Keith Barrett; Jan. 6, 1946–July 7, 2006), keyboardist-vocalist Rick Wright (July 28, 1945–Sept. 15, 2008), bass player-vocalist Roger Waters (born Sept. 6, 1943), and drummer Nick Mason (born Jan. 27, 1945). The four musicians met as students in London. Barrett coined the name Pink Floyd in honor of two of his favorite blues musicians, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council. The band began by playing rhythm and blues music in local clubs. As they expanded into hard rock, country, folk, electronic, and quasi-classical music, their sets became longer and louder. With the addition of a slide and light show, Pink Floyd emerged as a sensation on London’s underground rock circuit and were soon signed to a record contract. By 1967 the band had two hit singles—“Arnold Layne” and “See Emily Play”—and a debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). In the following year guitarist-vocalist David Gilmour (born March 6, 1944) joined the band after Barrett, who had been experimenting with psychedelic drugs and exhibiting strange behavior, suddenly left the group.\n\nDuring the next four years Pink Floyd released over a half dozen albums, including A Saucerful of Secrets (1968) and Ummagumma (1969), and recorded the soundtracks for films such as More, Let’s All Make Love in London, The Committee, Zabriskie Point, and Le Vallee. Even without Barrett, the band continued to explore psychedelic mysticism. To retain their elusive aura, Pink Floyd band members rarely granted interviews and kept low personal profiles.\n\nWith the release of Dark Side of the Moon (1973), an album about alienation and the psychological effects of social pressure, Pink Floyd finally had their first American hit single, “Money.” Their tour promoting the album featured a spectacular slide and light show and included animated films and giant inflatable props. The group’s subsequent albums included Wish You Were Here (1975), a hit single from which, “Shine On You Crazy Diamond,” was dedicated to former member Barrett, and the platinum Animals (1977), which portrayed society as being divided into categories of dogs, pigs, and sheep. These albums laid the groundwork for their smash hit The Wall (1979). That album’s hit single, “Another Brick in the Wall,” which dealt with topics ranging from suicide and betrayal to self-pity and revolution, was banned by some radio stations. Because of expensive, extravagant sets, the concert tour for the album was limited to four cities. Filmmaker Alan Parker directed a popular film, The Wall (1982), that illustrated music from the album.\n\nAfter The Wall, Wright left the group because of conflict with Waters. Meanwhile, Waters and Gilmour continued to pursue the solo careers that they had begun in the late 1970s. By the mid-1980s Gilmour and Mason became entangled with Waters in a legal battle over the use of the Pink Floyd name; they eventually won temporary rights to the name. Wright came back on board and Pink Floyd released A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and a performance album, Delicate Sound of Thunder (1989).\n\nIn 1990 Waters staged a complete performance of The Wall at the site of the Berlin Wall in Germany. Meanwhile, Pink Floyd continued recording, releasing Shine On (1992) and The Division Bell (1994), the latter containing their Grammy award–winning song ‘Marooned’. The band embarked on a major North American tour in 1994, followed by a European tour that featured a performance in front of a capacity crowd of 120,000 in Prague, Czech Republic. After releasing the multiplatinum Pulse (1995), Pink Floyd was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996."
