Don't say I didn't warn you!!\n\nIntroduction\n\nJohn McFerrin <stoo@imsa.edu> (21.05.99)\n\nA few things. First off, on a light note, I agreee with your assessment of much of Floyd's music as soundtrackish. I don't think there's any coincidence that virtually every Pink Floyd album has been linked with some film in a 'synchronicity'. Yes, DSOTM is infamous for its ties with The Wizard of Oz, but in my travails on the net, I have found links for almost every other Floyd film. Ummagumma links with Gigi (possibly cos there's an advertisement for it on the studio album cover), AHM links with Dr. Zhivago, Meddle links with Fantasia, WYWH links with It's a Wonderful Life, Animals links with Casablanca. And even if these are all just coincidences, the movie theme overtones of the albums can't be denied. Stanley Kubrick wanted to use parts of the AHM suite as the theme to Clockwork Orange, but Waters changed his mind at the last minute. Plus, Waters has stated in an interview that his biggest regret was that he was unable to write the musical score for 2001: A Space Odyssey (although there are reports on the net which say that Echoes matches up well with the final chunk of 2001, which is also supported that Echoes was orginally a _space_ theme, not an underwater theme, with lyrics starting \"planets meeting face to face...\"). So yeah, Floyd was a good soundtrack band, which explains why More and OBC are as good as they are; it was their forte.\n\nNow, on to my rant. I do believe that Floyd should be regarded as one of the greatest bands in history, (though not in front of the Beatles, that's for sure). I do NOT, however, agree with the reasons that Floyd is as idolized as they are. There are SO MANY people who claim to be \"hard-core Pink Floyd fans\" who are only familiar with DSOTM, The Wall, and maybe WYWH. I mean, yeah, these are good albums, but if you were to listen to the radio, you would think these are the only things they ever did. And no band is worthy of this much praise based on only three albums. Heck, read the Rolling Stone album guide, look at the ratings they give each album, and you'll see that DSOTM and WYWH get 5 stars, The Wall and Piper each get 4, and everything else gets 2, 2.5, maybe 3. And yet, despite the fact that when you think about it, Floyd got toasted, RS still elected them to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and even devoted an entire wing to them. And I don't disagree with that necessarily, but I sure as heck disagree with the _reasons_ they give Floyd all this praise. I mean, just once, I'd like to hear 'One Of These Days' or 'Cymbaline' or even 'Astronomy Domine' on the radio, rather than 'Money', over and over and over agin. That being said, they wrote some good melodies, and when they didn't, they did everything in their power to cover it up. And by golly, they pulled it off! Whether it was the production, or calling on others to make great vocal performances, or even more production, they made the stuff really friggin interesting. Most of the time.\n\nRichard C. Dickison <randomkill@earthlink.net> (23.05.99)\n\nI can see where you guys are going with the SoundTrack idea, but I don't think it really states Pink Floyd's main greatness and weakness.\n\nI think George hit it on the head with the phrase \"mathematically precise, counted out and adjusted\" in my mind I identify this with symphonic music. Thats what I like and dislike about this group, not one note, not one effect was out of place on any (Roger Waters) Pink Floyd album. It all had some weird or strategic reason, either to hide some fault or mostly to manipulate the listeners mood. They practised the fine art of making seamless rock symphonies in a studio with all the sonic help they could muster and people, even I, hate that excess at some point.\n\nI think the worst critique you can launch at these dudes is that they really did not go beyond the album as concept and produce simply good songs, every song on their albums was to support every other song, ad nuseum, sometimes at the sacrifice of quality and indiviuality, we knew they could have though which makes me angry with them god damn it. I see it start on Meddle and proceed endlessly on till of course Roger leaves on The Final Cut.\n\nOn the flip side, the early outings with Syd were a dress rehearsal or is that character rehearsal for the Roger era and as with every one who has taste I refuse to even acknowledge the Gilmour led (remember when we had actual song writers and cared about our music) thingy group. I have no problem liking the Roger era albums for what they were, and as with every other prog band I hate the excesses too.\n\nI will always enjoy them for being completly unique and off the wall on any of their albums (up to Final Cut that is) and I really believe that is what counts.\n\nValentin Katz <Valka324@home.com> (14.08.99)\n\nFirst off, I'd like to congratulate you on job well done on a huge website. I run my own and I don't know how you could do all this work.\n\nThat being said, I can now engage in my criticism of the absolute rock heresy written in it. How can anyone in their right mind call Pink Floyd \"fluff rock?!?!\" Name one band that had more complexities in their overall point of music. I totally disagree with EVERYTHING you said about Pink Floyd, but I can understand that people have different tastes and some don't. But all those criticisms were unfounded. How can you say that they were average musicians, you're statements are so outrageous that I don't even have any words to combat them. They were the sentiment of anti-commercialism!\n\nThe Pink Floyd travesty is a almost-forgivable sin, but..what I cannot forgive is rating Led Zeppelin a 3!??! Along with Frank Zappa, what in the hell has Frank Zappa ever done? Why don't you stop taking these methodical, mathematical approaches to music and actually listen to something? Because, in the end it doesn't matter if you think its fluff rock or some other derogatory term, just sit down and listen to the music and hear how amazing it is. Think of adrenaline rush it gives you and how you just feel absolutely in awe afte listening.\n\nYou can't judge music like you desipher morse code, with no feeling and absolutely sturdy. When are you going to realize its only about the music?? If you can ever un-tighten your rear-end, you might realize that you are desecrately what is holy. So, instead of listening to music to critique it, I suggest you listen to it for its intention, enjoyment and entertainment. When you do that maybe you might be able to open your ears and even eyes and believe in the power of classic rock.\n\n[Special author note: I already wrote a long answer to Valentin, so I won't bother putting another one on this site. I hope that all my constant readers will be easily able to see the flaws of this message and the primary ideological differencies between its author and me. For more information, see guidelines on comment posting]\n\nSimon Hearn <simon@leehearn.freeserve.co.uk> (07.09.99)\n\nI love pink floyd - sorry! Between 71 - 80 they were a class act. Later floyd is terrible though.\n\nI cannot understand why some people do not think dark side of the moon is not the best floyd album. IT IS, no question. Their best \"compiled\" album is this one - it all works so well and 'the great gig in the sky' is pure bliss - clare torry is a goddess. 'Great gigg' does for floyd what 'gimme shelter' did for stones - augmenting their sound with female vocal arrangements. WYWH is cool as is animals, but I do not like the wall - too many fillers. Floyd should not have tried to do a white album, no one should imitate the fab 4 - oasis prove that!\n\nAshley <WishUwereHere3@aol.com> (24.10.99)\n\ndear whoever said they suck~\n\nPink Floyd is SO talented! If anything they are under-rated. Roger Waters is the best song writter there ever was, same with Syd Barrett. Their music is much more then a catchie tune that say The Beatles would put out. They are totally in the music for the music. wow their lyrics are pure talent I bow down to ALL the Floyd\n\nBen Greenstein <bgreenstein@nctimes.net> (23.11.99)\n\nWell, I'm glad to see that there's somebody else besides me who feels that Floyd is really overrated, but I just don't understand how you can give them a four and badns like Jethro Tull and Genesis (who you seem to like more) a three. If you don't like them, why do they get such a high grade? Makes no sense to me.\n\nBut we do agree about most. As a songwriter, Waters is really pretty weak, and Barrett is not that much better. In terms of musicianship, the guitar solos just bore me to tears, and nothing else really catches my attention at all. The melodies are next to nonexistent - actually I think the only song that I can remember really liking is that \"Pigs\" song. The rest of the band's stuff is REALLY unappealing. I couldn't give any of their albums a higher score than seven (and the ones I've heard are The Wall, Pulse, Animals, Dark Side, and Wish You..., all of which were borrowed from a friend), and for this band a seven would be generous. The only album I'd rate any higher is that first Barrett one, the only one I own, which gets an eight. I couldn't care less if I hear any of the other ones again - I'd rather listen to REM or Elvis Costello anyday.\n\nMaybe they're good if you're on drugs, but if you HAVE to be stoned to enjoy it, it ain't good music. Valentin Katz makes me crack up - he honestly thinks that Floyd are more complex musically than Zappa - or even Led Zep? Waters knew, like, five chord progressions, tops! He's not sophisticated in the least! As a composer myself, I find it incredibly obvious that the guy never even bothered to try and expand his horizons beyond the average \"Floyd\" sound. No weird time signatures, very few eerie sound effects, NORMAL chord progressions - this stuff ain't prog! It's CRAP, made by a CRAPPY band who couldn't write a DECENT song to save their life.\n\nSorry to be so blatant, but that's the way I feel. I don't like Pink Floyd. And I've certainly tried.\n\nBob Josef <Trfesok@aol.com> (12.02.2000)\n\nThere are a couple of overlooked reasons why Floyd caught on and became huge, aside from their increasingly theatrical live shows. One, with Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here and The Wall, they discovered how to consistently write good melodies, even on instrumental works. And two, Waters' lyrics, unlike most prog bands, tapped into the anxieties and frustrations of male adolescents and post-adolescents in an intelligent, but yet accessible manner. But they eventually lost both of those strengths -- the split-up of Waters and Gilmour only proves the adage that a great group is made up of more than the sum of their parts.\n\nGreg Nordeng <floyd@chorus.net> (20.02.2000)\n\nWhen I was reading your review with all due respect I felt like throwing up. You brought up some interesting points about the methodical mathematical style of Pink Floyd. I personally completely disagree with you. I would say the albums Piper at the Gates of Dawn, Saucerful of Secrets, Ummagumma, Atom Heart Mother, Meddle, The Wall, and The Final Cut kill that idea. Especially the first few I mentioned there. I would have to say that Pink Floyd is the exact opposite, do you really think Syd Barret even knew his times tables? To call Syd Barrets music \"mathematical\" is a complete contradiction to what the music stood for. The album was a complete demonstration of \"psychedelia\" and the \"free spirit\". I am pretty sure that had nothing to do with a scale, a metronome, a ruler, a calculator, or whatever... I do see where you can see that on some of there later material it was like that. That was a totally new feel for the band, David Gilmours guitarwork I will admit may not be complicated, but the amount of passion he incorporates in every solo surpasses ANY guitarist I have ever heard. I am sorry you won't allow yourself to appreciate his solos, every one is a masterpiece. I also find it interesting that you don't LOVE at least early Pink Floyd, this may come as a shocker to you... The Beetles used material that Pink Floyd originally wrote. There is NO question in my mind that Pink Floyd was a big inspiration to the Beetles, I wish I had a quote or something saying that. All I have is the direct use of Pink Floyd lyrics and a very similar sound to Pink Floyd's early music before the beetles really revolutionized there music.\n\nAnother thing about your mathematical aspect of what you say... How about Mozart? The fact that his music was so mathematical was the GENIUS behind his music. I sincerely hope you have the utmost respect for Mozart. So if what you say is true about Pink Floyd's music being that way, jeez, what a nice compliment!\n\nWell Thanks for allowing me to post this, I hope that people listen to both what you have to say, and what I have to say, and take it into consideration. Pink Floyd to me will always be the SOURCE and epitome of originality in music.\n\n[Special author note: well, Piper is not such a 'calculated' affair, of course, being dominated by Syd the Whacko. But every other Pink Floyd album in the catalog is - are you going to tell me that 'A Saucerful Of Secrets' (the track) is not meticulously calculated and planned? It is. Are you going to tell me that the mounting of tension on the live version of 'Careful With That Axe' in Ummagumma is spontaneous and not just the result of an immaculate technical craftmanship? Don't make me laugh.\n\nNot that it's necessarily a bad thing, of course - like you pointed out, Mozart's music was also mathematical. But that's the main schtick of classical music: classical music is counted out and smoothed out par excellence, almost by genre definition. Rock music was initially opposed to it as basing more on spontaneity and improvisation. And, of course, I'm not saying that all rock music should be spontaneous and improvised, but there's gotta be a golden middle between the 'automatic' and the 'vivacious'. Pink Floyd don't have no 'vivacious' beginnings in them at all, and that's the band's main flaw (apart from the fact that Waters couldn't tell a good melody even when it hit him whack on the head, but that's another story).\n\nAs for the Beatles 'using material that Pink Floyd originally wrote' - I'm interested in that, but so far I haven't been able to find anything like that. Or maybe... no wait... shiver me timbers... don't you mean 'Revolution # 9'????!!!!]\n\nKathleen Keplar <rkeplar@norcom2000.com> (28.05.2000)\n\nWhat is with everybody wanting to bash the Floyd these days? My appreciation of music started with the Beatles. It moved slowly from there for the simple reason that the Beatles were a helluva yardstick to measure the next phase by. At the time, the early 70s, I wasn't playing music yet, and I pretty well ignored the Floyd. They were just too weird. Pete Townsend referred to Pink Floyd as 'scary' in an interview once. When I started picking at guitar and bass I kept remembering that comment. I had to look a little deeper into the Floyd. I'm glad, as a musician, and an artist in general, that I did.\n\nFirst off, I agree with most these days that they weren't first rate musicians. Very tech, and even then, very limited. Writing was very simple, often to the point of mundane. Gilmore was apparently a strict believer in the 'less is more' school of guitar. Water's bass playing...well...I'm not a 'professional'bassist and I could play rings around him. And the other two? Sidemen, in my opinion. And what can I say about Syd?Poor chap. Wanted to be an artist but decided that going bonkers was better suited to his abilities. What a bummer.\n\nSo how in the Hell did Pink Floyd get so huge?\n\nI think I figured it out some time ago. Musically speaking, the 60s was an optimistic period in time. The world was going to hell in a hand basket (as it usually is anyway, at any given time.) and the art of the time was hope for the better things to come. The decade that followed was the backlash. The 70s were a dark period for serious music. I now understand why disco flourished, it was opium for the moronic masses. The Floyd startedwith the sixties but that weird off-the-wallishness of theirs had no place in that back to innocence and beauty mood of the time. When the hippie counter culture movement died (the novelty of it just wore out) all these people who thought they had had something to say at one time now found themselves speechless. The world was still going to Hell in a hand basket and now, what made things even worse, no one was paying any attention to them anymore. All that was left was a dark, empty hole. I know because I was there myself. Pink Floyd flourished in that dark hole.\n\nThe music was simple. The lyrics were vague. The mood was dark. The atmosphere was brooding. The history of the band was eerie. The titles and album covers were strange and highly abstract. We had to love these guys!\n\nThe only album I'll mention by name is Dark Side of the Moon, of course. I have the sheet music andover the years I wore out the original album, the 8-track tape, and cassette tape. Now I'm busy trying to wear out the CD and I'll bet anyone that I'll probably do it somehow. Like the Beatles, the Floyd were at the right place at the right time. There's no way to compare the two groups to each other, that's a given, but the one thing they did have in common was timing. What the Floyd was saying was what the youth culture of the 70s wanted to hear. And they were saying it the way we felt about it. Simplistic terms underlyingan overwhelming sense of desperation and near hopelessness. We could smile at titles like 'Careful With That Axe Eugene' because we understood the joke right away and could relate to it instantly. Getting stoned to the Floyd was the unwinding experience to the max. The cryptic lyric 'See you on the Dark Side Of The Moon' was sheer genius. Intentional genius or just a lucky shot? Who cares...that one line alone stands out to place Pink Floyd towards the top of the pile.\n\nOverrated? Hell yes. But what highly successful band isn't at one point or another? Even the Beatles produced some pure shit that most of us, myself included, chose to ignore for a long time. The Roger Waters era of the Floyd can be compared with any other monster band that had its day in the sun, and hold its own quite well. I just turned 40 and when I sit around with myRickenbackerand play around with the DSOTM CDI have to grin at how dark and cynical my outlook was when I was a kid. I'm so surprised that I didn't take more careful notice of Pink Floyd when they were alive and kicking in their heyday. When my 18 year old daughter asks about the texture and mood of my younger days...(yes, she asks such questions, she's a born artist too) I have the advantage ofplaying DSOTM and telling her, \"Listen closely to the words, and let the music float you around aimlessly.\" I believe the Floyd will hold their own for some time to come. They'll always be back there in that dark and empty hole that we all have in us somewhere. And that is where Pink Floyd will always flourish.\n\n[Special author note: this review certainly has a point. Pink Floyd were one of the darkest bands of their time. But they were not unique in that style - bands like the ultra-progressive Van Der Graaf Generator, on one side, or the robotic Krautrock Can, on the other side, painted a far bleaker view of the world than Floyd ever did. The problem with these bands, and the advantage of Floyd, was in that Floyd were far more accessible - one cannot deny the 'commercial' value of all of their Seventies' megahit albums ('commercial' here used in the bad sense of the word, which is 'popularisation for dorks'). And while they were certainly masters of both form and substance, I cannot see the sheer genial subtleties in their music that distinguish so highly the music of the Beatles. Believe it or not, Floyd used a far more straightforward approach.\n\nAnd one more remark. What is with everybody thinking that everybody wants to bash Floyd these days? They still have innumerable legions of fans, don't they? For every critic, there's at least a couple hundred religious worshippers of the band. That's why a little salt on the wound is never harmful, especially since Pink do have such a lot of weak spots.]\n\nGreg Pringle <pengrui@163bj.com> (13.09.2000)\n\nPink Floyd is one of four groups/artists that I rush out to buy when a new album comes out. (The others are David Bowie, Kate Bush, and Zelda, the last being an obscure all-girl Japanese rock group that lasted from 1980 to 1996). I did start to collect a number of other artists, but somewhere along the line my commitment would inevitably flag.\n\nThe four 'must-buys' followed a pattern. I would hear their music a few times and perhaps record one of their albums, without, however, being struck with a desire to follow them religiously. A few years later, I would come across some other work, become completely hooked, and go out and get all their albums. In the case of Pink Floyd, I heard one early song - it may have been 'Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun' - on the radio in about 1972, listened to Dark Side of the Moon a lot in 1974, heard 'Furry Animals grooving with a Pict' in about 1977, and generally felt Pink Floyd were an OK group. I think I also recorded Meddle in 1976. It wasn't until 1979 when I rented another Pink Floyd album (I don't remember which) that I developed a passion for the group. From then on I collected every single album, going back to Piper at the Gates of Dawn. When The Wall, The Final Cut, A Momentary Lapse of Reason, and The Division Bell came out I bought them all without hesitation.\n\nThrough all this, I would be happy to call myself a Pink Floyd fan. However, I don't 'adulate' the group. I like their music but I certainly don't consider them gods. Perhaps this is what has saved me from erring in the opposite direction. If Pink Floyd had not been such a phenomenon over the past quarter of a century, I suspect that George might have put them down as a very polished group that produces excellent music, but lack a little in spontaneity. He might even have boosted their score a few points for being 'generally underestimated'. But the problem is that Pink Floyd were not underestimated. They were huge, which makes them an easy target for picking flaws.\n\nWhat is it that I like about Pink Floyd? In the final analysis, it is their music and nothing else. So maybe they are overplanned, overproduced, and overstaged. Perhaps they tend to be repetitive and don't always have strong melodies. They may be commercially driven. Perhaps Roger Waters' lyrics tend to misanthropy. Despite their faults, which are legion, their music is, quite simply, extraordinarily listenable. Their lyrics are thought-provoking and their sound carries you into another world. You let Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here wash over you as you ponder the lyrics, and it is always a surprise how quickly the experience ends. Even if the 'Pink Floyd sound' becomes predictable (as it does in the post Roger Waters albums), it is a curiously satisfying sound. The 'organ' sound in songs like 'Cirrus Minor' and 'Absolutely Curtains' is simple but wonderfully moving. The guitar work in pieces like 'Fat Old Sun' and 'The Turning Away' soars without building up to a cheap climax - they manage to wring every ounce of emotion out of every note. The bells, insects, cornflakes, and helicopters are all part of the sound and don't annoy me like they do some people. In the end, their music may be totally planned and calculated, but it is amazingly effective in its appeal to the listener.\n\nPink Floyd also has the indispensible virtue of bearing repeated listening. Even a Roger Waters album like The Final Cut, tuneless as it tends to be, grows on you over time. This is why I continue to buy Pink Floyd albums. True, David Gilmour hasn't come up with anything new recently and some of the old magic is being lost. I admit that I probably buy them 'for old time's sake'. Despite this, they still make good music; I have yet to find a Pink Floyd album so abysmal that I would swear off buying one again.\n\nIf being 'addicted' to Pink Floyd has a downside I would suggest that it is the same downside as being addicted to anything: it prevents you from going on to experience better things. There are better groups than Pink Floyd in the world and there are probably better ways to spend your precious time than to listen to Dark Side of the Moon 400 times. But that is the price of going back to any cherished experience, whether it be rereading a book, rewatching a movie, revisiting a scenic spot, or coming back to the same web site again and again. The richness comes from the repitition of the experience.\n\nMarius Popescu <mariusp@electricaph.interplus.ro> (15.09.2000)\n\nI think the problem with the great bands is that they don't now when to stop. And Pink Floyd is a great band. But if they 'd stopped after The Wall, they would've been even greater. It was a great Frenchman who once said: \"What is exaggerated becomes insignificant\".\n\nThe same thing happened with Deep Purple even if their last 2 albums are not as bad as some people say. I saw them in 99 live in Bucharest and I must say I was very disappointed by Gillan's voiceas I was disappointed by Robert Plant's voice 2 years ago.\n\nBut back to Pink Floyd.First, I think almost half of their fans are not sincere fans but snobs, because you know it's always been trendy or chic to pretend that you like Pink Floyd.\n\nSomebody said they were the symbol of anti-commercialism. They were not. Maybe they tried to, but that's what's made them more commercial. A proof of that is that DSOTM spent like 10 years in Billboard Top 200 (it's a record) and those fake occasional fans were amongst the ones who made that possible. I'm not trying to say that DSOTM is a bad album, because it's not, it's oneof my favorites too. But I think that the \"psychedelic band\" label didn't make them any good even though it helped them to get more money.\n\nAbout the \"mathematical music\" issue. I saw a short passage from a Bob Dylan early interview and he was saying:\"I'm a kinda mathematical singer, I use words like other people use numbers\".\n\nMaybe it has nothing to do with David Gilmour playing his solos with a mathematical precision but I liked it. I can't judge their instrumental virtuosity because I'm not a musician or something, but I don't think that the value of a song is given by it's complexity or the guitarist's speed.\n\nAnyway, thanx for listening, pardon my English and forgive the errors from the 2 quotes but they were from my memory.\n\nSergey Zhilkin <sergey_jilkin@mail.ru> (02.10.2000)\n\nYou know I hate Floyd, too. Not because they were the symbol of Seventies instead of any ex-Beatle. To me their music seems to be boring. Well, I wanted to say that some tunes are wonderful and I don't even know how they managed to write them but these mini-gems are hidden under thick layer of electric guitars and strange noises (I mean such songs like 'Time', 'Shine on your crazy diamond', 'Money' and etc.). You just listen whole 6-minute song for these gems that last for seconds! And some songs don't have these gems at all! I must admit that maybe I'm missing point here because I don't have all their albums but I've got two compilations and four albums (Wish you were here, A momentary lapse of reason, Atom Heart Mother and The wall). I can't say I hate these albums but I really can't find any drive there. Ther's too much filler for me. I won't buy any other album of Floyd because it's a waste of money. Once I even bought their film (was I drunk?) The wall. That's the thing I really HATE! In my opinion they deserve 3 stars and ONLY because they influenced great number of people.\n\nAndrei <sill@redconnect.com> (05.10.2000)\n\nI highly enjoyed your reviews site and in particular PF/Syd reviews.\n\nI agree with most of what you say, with one notable exception of ranking PF below Bob Dylan, Beatles, and Rolling Stones.\n\nI am a rabid fan of PF - in the sense that I rank any of their average songs, like, say, 'green is the color', or I could name 30 or 40 others, as far more important than all the songs I've heard from those 3 bands I mentioned.\n\nQuick note: I'm not on crack at the moment!\n\nThe reason probably is that I just haven't heard much by those bands. I got one best hits of bob dylan collection that i think is unlistenable, but it's probably a lousy collection cause I have 'hurricane' mp3 and I think it's very good. Lyrics are very impressive, story telling is even more so, music is good even considering that I *hate* country and it has slight traces of that.. I only have white album by beatles and I heard an assortment of other songs like michelle, eleanor rigby, yesterday, and a bunch of others, mostly love songs. White album leaves me unimpressed, with one exception of 'my guitar gently weeps' or whatever it's called, which is a quite good song, and reminds me of more songs by PF alot. I've heard even less of Rolling Stones - one nice song 'love is strong' and that's all I can name at the moment, but chances are I heard at least 3-4 others.\n\nSo, anyway, while I do agree with all the criticism of PF you give, not to mention the criticism that you don't give but I could easily add, I still rank them as the best band ever, with closest competition follow- ing a few light years behind in a tight formation. I'm really picky.\n\nTo put this into a more scientific notation, I'd give PF a 5 or 4.5 and I'd give other bands I like from 2.8 to 3.2 at most. These would include bowie, waters, barrett, bryan ferry, dubtribe sound system (mostly under- ground band in style of 'DUB' which is vaguely related to house), alan parsons (some of his stuff is *really* cheesy, though..), Delerium (ambient/techno/pop but far better than this would normally imply), Euphoria (totally unknown band which is something like a cross between PF and Delerium).\n\nAnyway, here's a nice little theory why you may not give PF all they deserve (kindly speaking): your sound system is not all that great! After all, PF is very atmospheric, ambient, with all the surreal sounds and special effects. I haven't found any description of your sound system on your site, and I think it's of utmost importance when reviewing music. My assessment of music, and of PF in particular changed immensely when I got an entry-level midfi system (paradigm monitor 3's and NAD cd player/integrated amp). I mean, beatles and dylan can sound pretty nice but PF takes you into another world all- together!\n\nOn the other hand, I don't want to sound too sure - maybe you do have a fairly good system and I simply overrate PF, due to general lack of music-listening experience. I never even heard of 8/10th of the bands you review, not even counting the 'misc' section at the bottom. I did change my tastes alot in last 5 years, going through pet shop boys, depeche mode, bunch of eurodance (what was I thinking), rap (now this one I'll stand by - there's pop being played on the radio that everybody with any taste hates, but there's also quite a few gems nobody ever heard), pink floyd, and finally techno/ambient. But I did not stop respecting PF even after the short period of obsession! That sets it apart.\n\nI also doubt I am just another deluded fan who can't stand criticism of his idol - PF has *tons* of flaws. It's just that beside the flaws, they have grandiose and majesty nobody else could approach.\n\nOkay, </deluded rabid fan rant>.\n\nglennryder <glennryder@satyam.net.in> (14.11.2000)\n\nGilmour sold out ! .... Waters rules !\n\nyeh yeh\n\nJeff Blehar <jdb3@jhu.edu> (20.11.2000)\n\nI HATE PINK FLOYD! Okay, I don't, but I'm less and less enamored of these guys than I used to be. I will admit that, for better or for worse, I'm now turned off by the fawning mobs of uneducated fans who slobber all over Floyd as \"the greatest band ever\" but haven't even heard of Syd Barrett, much anything by art-rockers who I think were much better (Roxy Music, Eno, Bowie, etc.).\n\nBut holding the Floyd responsible for its fanbase or the monolithic popularity of Dark Side (yeah, yeah, it's GOOD. Really GOOD. But that's IT.) is unfair. No, the reason I don't like them is because the sound effects don't do it for me the way they did when I was younger.It's not their actual MUSIC or their melodies (i.e. lack thereof) that necessarily bother me, and sound effects and production are always key to boosting a piece's presentation. No, it's (what I perceive to be) the unrelieved SAMENESS of their basic sound. The sound effects are only there to distract you from that. You got yer mellotron/synth, your mediocre and largely superfluous bass, your utterly pedestrian drumming, and then there's the Guitars. I like Barrett a lot, and his era ranks highly with me, but chalk me up as another music-lover (and musician) who is put off by Gilmour's \"dentistry\" (what a perfect coinage). Sometimes he gets it really right - \"Comfortably Numb\" would be one such time, and \"Dogs\" would perhaps be the best moment he's ever had - but by and large I find him grating. His voice irks me too - the epitome of pleasant professionalism, and the unfortunate archetype for a thousand heavyish lead singers to come. Frankly I prefer Waters' tuneless but distinctive bleating to Gilmour. He DOES write good melodies, however, which often (esp. in later years) ended up being Floyd's saving grace.\n\nI'm sure I sound really tough on the Floyd, but I'm uncharitable only because they're so obnoxiously overrated. They're STILL a \"great\" band (read: deserving of that 4), and there's something on almost all of their LPs which appeals to me, but I find them unexciting these days. All the enthusiasm of my youth for these guys has faded away.\n\nOh yeah, and will people please STOP comparing Radiohead to Pink Floyd? That's such an infuriatingly superficial and inaccurate comparison! Radiohead will never be as influential as these guys, by simple fact of having come later, but I think that if they maintain their quality control they'll end up being BETTER by a significant margin.\n\nJohn Trenor <jtrenor@goosenet.net> (02.12.2000)\n\nHello\n\nI hate them as well,and i'm 45.I had to work in a shop where the owner played nothing but the pretentious gits.One day I will eat his liver,(just kidding) his spleen would be better.\n\nemail <sybilr@denveronline.com> (03.12.2000)\n\nFirst off all I would like to say that Pink Floyd is the best band today and in their time. You are completely wrong to say that Pink Floyd is sold out. Bands like the Beatles whick many people think is the supposed \"best band ever\" is bullshit to me. So any way all I am saying is Fuck You! Pink Floyd is the shit and everybody who disagrees has no idea what Floyd is really about. And not a good Trip!\n\n<Sabbath246@aol.com> (12.12.2000)\n\nWhy does everyone insist on bad-mouthing Floyd? Sure, they were over-rated, but for Chrissake look at the Stones, AC/DC, Zeppelin, and of course the Beatles! All these bands are given way more credit than they deserve in my opinion. In the words of Alice Cooper: \"There was no one like Pink Floyd. They were the ultimate psychadelic band\". And I fully agree. Well, maybe not. That title would maybe have to go to the Doors, but Floyd were still great. Roger Waters was of course a Greek god on the four-string, and a top-notch songwriter as well. Nick Mason was an average drummer who was talented, but incomparable to the greats (Paice, Bonham, Baker, Ward, etc.), Rick Wright was one of the best and most creative keyboardists ever. And of course, there's Mr. Gilmour. I sincerely believe Dave to be the 2nd greatest guitarist of all time (second only to Santana), regardless of what anyone says. I just don't see how you can call his playing \"soulless and generic\", but to each his own I guess. When I listen to Gilmour's playing, I'm always stunned. For he was the first guitarist that proved that you don't have to play 100 miles a minute to be impressive (are you listening Van Halen, Blackmore, Iommi?), and I know his solos never last too long, but the amount of passion he incorporates into every note more than makes up for it. The best examples are songs like \"Time\", \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond pt. 1\", \"Hey You\", and of course \"Comfortably Numb\". He just flows from one heart-felt note into another, letting the emotion do the talking, instead of freaking out and playing lightning-quick licks, which countless guitarists have done over the years. I do agree with you that ANIMALS is their greatest album, however. 'Dark Side and other albums like that are great, but ANIMALS is the pinnacle of pink if you ask me. Later.\n\n[Special author note: Excuse me. Gilmour was the first guitarist who 'proved that you don't have to play 100 miles a minute to be impressive'? Practically none of the fabulous guitarists in the Sixties played at 100 miles a minute - bar Hendrix, perhaps, but that wasn't Jimi's main specialty anyway. It's nearly the same as to say that 'the Clash were the first band that proved you don't have to write long-winded songs to sound serious'. And while Gilmour's solos usually don't run for too long, I reiterate that he completely lacks improvisation, which is so vital for a truly impressive guitarist. His live solos just sound like they're copied and pasted from the studio records, with a couple minor variations. I certainly do not dislike all of his solos or anything (the soloing on stuff like 'Time' or 'Dogs' is really great), but this inability to stick to anything outside a predefined pattern automatically excludes him from garnering my utmost respect.]\n\nDavid Lyons <d.t.lyons@btinternet.com> (14.12.2000)\n\nGood heavens. Is sybilr a real person? How did someone that disturbed manage to operate a computer for long enough to get the email to you? You know, I started reading the Pink Floyd section convinced I was a huge fan with all the albums and many emotional connections to the songs, but soon after reading *that* message, I began to realise I didn't like them half as much as I'd thought. Then I rallied somewhat, and contemplated putting forth the reasoned, eloquent defence that the sensible level-headed critique cried out for. Then I read that message again, and decided nothing is worth siding with someone like that over. I'm selling all my Pink Floyd albums and moving to Greenland.\n\n<Swansdead@aol.com> (24.12.2000)\n\nYou want to talk unpredictable?What do you think of german bands like Can or Faust?Have you heard them?I hear them being referred to as being humorless alot but Faust easily had more of a sense of humor than Floyd as well as more fun.Yeah,fun experimental music and oh so mad! Can were also stronger and maybe more confident in their playing,it sounds like it to me.Not as clumsy.Floyd had some humorous stuff in the early years but after Barret left well.......Floyd introduced me to experimental music and I have them to thank for opening my mind to other sounds.I like experimental,avant-whatever, alot more than punk or standard MOR rock.They weren't the only ones though,just an example.\n\nLyolya Svidrigajlova <vsvitov@diamin.msk.ru> (31.12.2000)\n\n[Oh-oh... there seem to be more people who don't like Pink Floyd than their fans on this page. That's interesting already... Or maybe fans' comments were way too offensive to post them... I don't know. I don't know either why the comment by 'sybilr' was posted. Really, this might turn somebody off Pink Floyd completely, as it did with David Lyons... As far as I understood from your guidelines, George, you don't often post the messages like this one...]\n\n[I DON'T LIKE PINK FLOYD... I don't either like to agree with the reviewer and the majority of commentators but this time I don't have another choice... Or they are too complicated for me. But that doesn't mean THEY are bad. That might be because I'm nothing but a dumb suburbian. Yes I am. And I don't want to show myself wizer by loving Pink Floyd... This would be a hypocrisy...]\n\nAh, anyway...\n\n1. The dislike for Pink Floyd, it seems to me, might lay on the basis of the fact that some people compete them with the Beatles. [I don't like this competition either. Those are just different things. But Kathleen Keplar has already said it. I join.] That's understandable. [BUT! I also hate it when somebody says that Beatles are overrated just because he/she is offended by other people's dislike for Pink Floyd. Brothers&sisters, we'd better been more respective to each other! There is no use in the war...]\n\n2. Another reason for the dislike for Pink Floyd, it seems to me, lays on the basis that there are many Pinkfans who say that \"if you don't think that Pink Floyd are great, you're just dumb and you can't understand the real music\". Yes, it is repugnant to hear from somebody that you're dumb just because you have the other opinion. Yes, Pink Floyd is \"en vogue\", yes, some people listen to them just to show themselves more wize than they actually are. BUT! Not all Pink Floyd fans are so. Some of them really fell in love with this music. Chacun son gout.\n\n3. Yes, they are pretentious. But... I can't say that it is so bad. [The other point is that personally, I don't like it, but does it really matter? Especially if so many people do like it...]\n\nAre they underrated or overrated? I'll stay neutral. Time will show. Alot of time, exactly, will show. It could take a hundred years. Or even more. I don't want to be rushed.\n\n[I don't like Pink Floyd. I can't even say I hate them. They just don't give me shivers. In other words, I could have said (2 years ago) that I hated the Beatles 'cuz they did give me shivers. Unlike Pink Floyd. But it's only my attitude.]\n\nRobert Grazer <xeernoflax@jack-the-ripper.com> (06.01.2000)\n\n\"What I honestly feel is that the Floyders are probably the most overrated rock band in man's history.\"\n\nGeorge do you really feel that you have the right to make this statement? Have you looked at some of your favorite bands lately? The Who, The Beatles, Bob Dylan. I personally believe that the title of most overrated belongs to The Rolling Stones. Just a quick thought...\n\n[Special author note: I have encountered TONS of people foaming about how the Rolling Stones are complete shit, but I can't say the same for Pink Floyd. When I say \"overrated\", I don't mean overrated by the likes of Spin or Rolling Stone magazines; I mean overrated by people like you and me and other commentators and people who I speak with and write to. If you're interested to know, every young dumb jerk in Russia has heard about how great Dark Side Of The Moon is, but very few people have actually heard about the Rolling Stones. I do not suppose there is a big difference in the rest of the world.]\n\nMorten Felgenhauer <Morten.Felgenhauer@kvaerner.com> (09.01.2001)\n\nI can't believe that your page hasn't been flooded with hate mails from obsessive Floydsters after your introduction to the band. You had some good points, though. I think Pink Floyd deserves their place amongst the Great Ones because of their willingness to experiment in the early years and their classic later albums. They tried everything, and although not everything worked they deserve credit for doing it. A laugh at people who moan about their lack of instrumental abilities. The only thing that matters is what the completed work sounds like, not how Roger Waters plays his bass (which he does quite well). Their music can be described as worthless or brilliant, but only in their later years would I find it appropriate to use the term boring.\n\n<PINKFLOYDthecut@aol.com> (25.01.2001)\n\nI believe that Pink Floyd is the greatest band to exist. Nobody comes close to making anything like the Floyd. They have their own style and nobody else comes close to them. Therefore, I totally disagree with your review\n\nMatthew Jarvie <MJarvie@excite.com> (02.02.2001)\n\nI totally disagree with your opinions on Pink Floyd, which happens to be the best group of the 70's. Who cares if Floyd wern't fucking virtuosos? Most groups with virtuoso musicians like Yes, cared only about showing off rather then creating a feel. Not to mention how cheesy some of these other prog bands sounded- all totally overridden with cheesy keyboard effects. People don't listen to Pink Floyd because they want to hear virtuoso playing, but because their music creats atmosphere, unlike most other groups were capable of doing. Pink Floyd is one group that didn't sound like every other band out there. If anything, Floyd was the least pretentious of all the Progressive Rock groups of that time. Floyd should really be in a category by themselves. To even mention them is the same paragraph as ELP or Yes just isn't right. You refer to most of Floyds albums as pretentious, then you go and give albums like Tarkus and Brain Salad Surgery 8's and 10's. Give me a fucking break! Don't get me wrong, I love ELP and they are also one of my favorite prog rock bands, but they were pretentious as all hell. Brain Salad Surgery is one of the most pretentious, chessy and overrated albums of the Progressive Rock movement (its also ELP's worst early period album in my opinion), yet you give that and 8, whereas WYWH gets a 7? Roger Waters is one of the best song writers EVER! No one can capture the feeling of human suffering like Roger can, NOBODY! To call him a \"so-so\" song writer baffles me. You also consider Dave's guitar playing to be \"Generic\", yet you praise the guitarwork of Steve Howe and Steve Hackett. That makes a lot of sense. Can you name any prog rock guitarists that didn't sound somewhat generic? It's Progressive rock for fucks sake, its not the blues! And why should it really matter if the groups music is structured or not. Does every group have to make \"structured\" music in order for it to meet your standards?\n\nPerhaps some of Floyds music from their later albums was overplayed, but is that really the groups fault? Roger wasn't looking to make albums that would sell in mass quantitites, but they just sold well because its good music. I mean,jesus, Like the Beatles arn't overrated and overplayed to some extent?\n\nWithout a dobut, the most overrated band of the 70's and of ALL TIME is Led Zeppelin. Led Zeppelin was probably the most unoriginal group from the 70's, yet they got way more attention then they deserved. In my opinion, any person with real musical taste would simply dismiss Zeppelins music as \"cock rock\", just like Van Halen was in the 80's. Pink Floyd made intelligent, cerebral, unpretentious (in their cult years) music, not \"cock-rock\". Floyd were innovators and they deserve more credit then any of the other prog bands like Yes ( now THEY are overrated). In my opinion, Floyd is one of the most underrated groups of the 70's. So many people look at this music as being nothing but aimless \"stoner\" music, but that is quite the contrary. Pink Floyd is thinking mans music and is a fuck of a lot deeper then anything Zeppelin, Yes or any of those other self-indulgent bands were making. Pink Floyd, along with CAN were without a doubt the most grounbreaking bands of the 70's! I wouldn't expect a person who reviews ABBA albums with '10' ratings to necessarilly agree with me.\n\n[Special author note: I have to point out the fact that anybody who says 'I totally disagree with your opinions on Pink Floyd' and really means it would, in fact, have to DESPISE Pink Floyd to a very large degree. What's all that hyperbolization about? Also, it's very interesting to find a person who considers prog rock guitar playing 'generic' and blues rock guitar playing 'non-generic'. And anybody who calls Steve Hackett's playing \"generic\" has to reconsider the meaning of that term. And YES! There's an ABBA argument in here! I should have expected that final note.]\n\nAlexandre Santos <ancsantos@hotmail.com> (09.02.2001)\n\nLet me begin by praising you on a magnificent review site. I think you're on the ball with most of your reviews, but I would like to say a bit about your criticisms on Pink Floyd.\n\nIt seems that you and those who agree with you believe Pink Floyd is overrated. That may be the case but it is unfortunate. Pink Floyd are misunderstood. Their legions of fans, unlike those of the Grateful Dead and Phish, cannot be stereo-typed into the druggie vagabond category, but they do share a certain view of aesthetics, a view which admittedly isn't the most sober.\n\nWere they pretentious? Self-indulgent? I think not. The poets (you probably wouldn't call them that, eh?) that were PF wanted nothing more than to \"trip out\" their fans and themselves. Lots of their stuff must've been done in good humour. You use the term \"atmospheric\" like it's a bad thing, and chastise PF for their lack of good melodies. Melodies weren't their cup of tea. Maybe it's just my take on what it means to be an artist, but I don't think there is any real need for a band like PF to cater to the masses anyway, especially if a few best-selling albums has made them financially secure. I use the term \"masses\" in a derogatory way but not as to suggest that PF is meant for the intelligent. God knows there are many thousands of stoner Floyd-heads whom I would classify as being anything but intelligent. The soundtrack style of PF is what they perfected and it's what I like about them. It takes a certain type of person to appreciate this soundtrack style, a certain state of mind (heh), a certain perfect time and mood.\n\nOriginality? The Doors and Led Zeppelin had a rich mythos behind their music and PF chose to do the same. Again, this was done so as to \"trip out\" their fans, to make the PF experience as different as possible, as opposed to the act of listening to a melody. I hope you agree that PF ought not to be compared to the Beatles or the Stones who built a different kind of mythos around themselves, and especially not to the true \"originators\" and precursors of psychedelic rock (whoever they may be) because they didn't have the fame and popularity to create a mythos or legend. Did PF and LedZep \"rip-off\" other musicians? No, they were \"inspired\" by them. Heh.\n\nI'm not a musician myself, but I think I have a pretty keen ear and I must say that not a single member of PF deserves a seat on the Mt.Olympus of musical heroes. As professional musicians they pale in comparison to the better of their contemporaries, especially when it came to live performances. Again, I wouldn't hold this against PF, because their live performances are misunderstood for the same reasons I mentioned above. The crazy visual effects that PF's shows were known for were amazing and central to the whole event. For the sober individual these shows may have seemed chaotic and irrational, but they were works of art, and there were many popular studio tunes whose live renditions were quite memorable and well-crafted on their own. Take for example \"Careful With That Axe, Eugene\". All the many versions of the song, live and not, were entirely unique in a way that perhaps only a true PF or soundtrack/atmosperic/ambient music fan can enjoy. I recommend comparing the studio version of \"Careful With That Axe, Eugene\" with their Zabriskie Point soundtrack version \"Come in Number 51, Your Time is Up\".\n\nFor the record, everything after and including The Final Cut, in my opinion, sucks. The atmospheric style (at least the good soundtrack stuff) of Pink Floyd died with the dismissal of Rick Wright from the band during The Wall. In conclusion, let me comment on your decision to rank PF a \"4\". I think you made a good choice, considering theres only five others ranked higher. I find it somewhat suspect that you do so because PF are \"groovy\". If I'm understanding your choice of \"groovy\" correctly, you are attributing the rank of \"4\" to very thing I've been preaching about this whole time- their mastery of the soundtrack, and I've been arguing that PF are the best, or at least the most important, example of such a style. Of course, judging them merely by the standard I laid out above, wouldn't Pink Floyd be worthy of a \"5\"?\n\nJeffrey O'Brien <jeff_obrien@worldnet.att.net> (05.03.2001)\n\nFirst off George,I can't tell you that you have bad taste(OH BOY)because everybody has their own likes and dislikes.Not everybody has to like PINK FLOYD.However you are wrong on every point.PINK FLOYD is a group that is willing to step out and take chances with their audience.They succeed every time and at the same time overwhelming the audience to the point that the listener is exploding with emotions that they can't control.To say that PINK FLOYD is over-rated is not only heresy,it sounds like it comes from somebody that has never experienced FLOYD.[FOLLOW MY TYPING CLOSELY]YOU...DOOO...NOT...LISTEN....TO....PINK FLOYD!!!....YOU.... EXPERIENCE....PINK FLOYD!!!!!Do you get my message load and clear.They are not like other bands.Let me give you my personal experience...\n\nI grew up in the 70s.yes I listened to WISH YOU WERE HERE,DARK SIDE OF THE MOON,AND THEN THE WALLbut they were my brother's albums.I remember getting high and listening(\"hey man(taking a toke from a joint)...check out these sounds\").\n\nYears latter PINK FLOYD released THE DIVISION BELL and that is when I heard HIGH HOPES.That song tugged on every emotion inside of me.Every time I hear that song,it brings tears into my eyes(thats how good it is).On that day I became ahugh PINK FLOYD fan.\n\nI look back on the earlier albums and realized a depth that I never saw before.A DEPTH GREATER THEN ALL THE ALBUMS EVERPRODUCED IN HUMAN HISTORY.\n\nGilmour is brilliant too.I guess the reason that people complain about a gilmour led FLOYD is because they feel if they complain enough,then WATERS will come back to the fold(I'am right aren't I)THIS WILL NOT WORK SO FORGET IT!!!\n\nTo put it bluntly,PINK FLOYD IS THE GREATEST ROCK BAND IN HISTORY and deserve every single praise they get!!In fact they desirve more then what they HAVE BEEN GETTING.\n\nPlease George EXPERIENCE a PINK FLOYD album today and read the lyrics this time for god's sake!!\n\n<ElDarkHorse@aol.com> (07.03.2001)\n\nFirst I'd like to say that your page is incredible. I know that many don't like to do this and it seems like a waste of time, but Pink Floyd does need to be experienced. Originally I thought it was crap and would have entirely agreed on your reviews; however in time as I read lyric sheets and analyzed the works, things changed. I began to understand the music and have a thirst for more. The songs evoke so much emotion after you take the time to know them by heart. What I do agree with you however is how disappointing they can be when it comes to improvisation. Many great musical interludes could be easily expanded upon, yet they are left unchanged. I know that you dont have the time to sit and analyse every album by every band, but the floyd can not be judged by critics. It just wont tell the whole story.\n\nJanet Carr <carrm@cadvision.com> (13.03.2001)\n\nI just can't believe what you are saying.Pink Floyd is about the greatest band on this here planet.Do you even know who you are talking about.'These guys are very average musicians, and so-so song writers'. ARE YOU MAD?Roger Waters, along with Mcartney & Lennon, Jim Morrison, Elton John, Fredie Mercury, and others, is/was one of the greatest lyricists and music writers of all time.Richard Wright has been haled as one of the greatest living pianists. Of course there is David Gilmour.ARE YOU MAD? Yes, his work is meticulous and perfect, but it is perfect.Dave is one the best axe-men around.His tone is unmatched.Nobody can touch this guy in asolo. David Gilmour took Pink Floyds stage show to another level.Copper lasers and huge video screens, not mention millions of blazing colours all around.Have you ever noticed the sound on a Floyd album? It sounds better than most music out today.Dark Side of the Moon is nearly thrity years old and I would match it up against any album that just came out. The recording is perfect.Once again, thanks to Gilmour. How could you not love this band?Every song on every album is great.Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall are two of rocks greatest albums.As for the other albums, they don't get the credit they deserve. Wish You Were Here, Animals, and Meddle are musical masterpieces.From the opening slow, bluesy, solo on 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond', to the Acustic masterwork of 'Wish You Were Here', this album is genius.How about Meddle?'One of These Days' is just a good old chill you to the bone symphony.What about using a hound dog to sing harmony on 'Seamus'? Now, thats creative!'Echoes' is a twenty-four minute masterpiece.This is Floyd at there best. My friend you are a fool.\n\n[Special author note: okay, maybe I'm a fool, but at least I'm not a generic Floyd-obstinated fool. Which makes me feel glad.]\n\nVedran Dinter <vedran.dinter@vz.hinet.hr> (24.04.2001)\n\nhello.. i've read almost all of your reviews... well, i don't agree with mostly all of them, but one things bothers me... it's a \"special author note\" below the review of p.u.l.s.e. where you state that you are a \"neutral reviewer\" and the guy that wrote the note is a \"rabid fan\". i just don't see things that way. every single one of us has its own opinion. you, i think, can't claim that you are a neutral reviewer, nor can anybody else. to me, for example,it seemsthat you dislike floyd more than you like them, although it might or might not be true. i'm not saying that the things you wrote aren't true or that they are rubbish, but it doesn't mean that is \"neutral reviewing\". for example, you wrote that, for you of course, the best song on \"the division bell\" is \"take it back\". it's a radio single, for god sake! to most floyd fans \"what do you want from me\" and \"high hopes\" are much better that \"take it back\". it just shows that we don't look at things from the same point of view. some people i know claim that the best floyd album is piper, others that it's the division bell, i can't decide between the 70's albums... i like to heargood lyric rather than great music with weaker lyrics... that's why i prefer waters over gilmour.of course, there arepeople that don't (they like \"momentary lapse\" :)) there are no neutral reviewers out there. i would probably rate pros and cons and the final cut much higher along with other solo projects from roger waters (except k.a.o.s. of course...) but it doesn't mean that they arebrilliant.on the other side, you can bring down every floyd album if you want to, even animals.\n\nthen, the whole idea of rating the albums and picking the best song is somehow silly to me. i don't think that you can rate the album with an '8'. why didn't you rate it with a '7' or '9'? what makes the difference? you could then rate the songs also... make it into a eurosong contest... and the winner is 'time' with 108 points... silly. when i first read this: \"Put it on when your girlfriend leaves you, and you'll see what I mean.\" about \"Don't leave me now\" i nearly started laughing... it's just that people don't have the same associations about those songs. one of their great values isthat people can have their own explanations of their meaning. don't get me wrong, i'm not claiming that i am absolutely right about the things i just wrote. discussion is a good thing, that's why i respect your point of view, but not the parts where you claim that you are the only one who islooking at things from the right angle...\n\nGianni Martinelli <gmartyn9@hotmail.com> (25.04.2001)\n\nHello George! First of all: sorry for my English, I'll try to make you understand what I mean to tell you!\n\nI've just read your introduction about Pink Floyd. They are my favourite band after Beatles but I agree with you on most part of you write about them. But I'd like to spend two words in David Gilmour's favour: you said his guitar is soulless, slow and calculated.\n\nJeff Beck said: \"He's the number one of this century with Hendrix, Santana, Page and Blackmore. Gilmour is the man who taught us all the physical and technological experimentation of the sound... our RACE made with the fingers what the others make with the distortion.\"\n\nAnd he's also a good riff-inventor: listen to 'Wish you were here', 'Sheep', 'Run like hell', 'Young lust'... and listen to the introducing solo of 'Shine on'... it really sends shiver down my spine!\n\nMy favourite guitar-player is EC (just like you), and he's often as slow as Gilmour, but you know far better than me that he's slow just because he prefers to give prominence to the emotions. Why should a musician play instrumental passages, without words, if he doesn't give preminence to the emotions?\n\nDavid isn't a great composer, but he's an eminent player. Even Roger Waters after his quitting from Pink Floyd, admitted it (and if you know Mr. Waters you know what does it mean)!!!\n\nVedran Dinter <vedran.dinter@vz.hinet.hr> (25.04.2001)\n\nhi...it's me again... hell... i didn't realize before now that there was another document (pink.htm) and not just pink1.htm which i had for some time on my computer for offline reading. well, to be honest, i also didn't realize that you have that mammoth site of yours. amazing, i must say... still don't understand how do you manage it though. after i read the first document some things became clearer. the sentence \"I HATE PINK FLOYD\" managed to shed some light on the subject... :) ... i read all about why do you 'hate' them and what is wrong with them etc. etc. and i must say that i (of course) disagree with almost everything... i think there is nothing wrong with gilmour as long as he sticks to his guitar (although 'sorrow' is a good lyric) and there is nothing wrong with waters lyrics at all. he is the no.1 songwriter for me... better than lennon, dylan and the others. it is not because i think he is god. it is because i can identify with them, because i agree with his look on the world, i agree with his political opinions... and i can't put beatles or (especially) stones in front of them. maybe dylan. maybe. i can't help it... i like lyrics like waters writes them... i find them intelligent and pesimistic (which i find good) and i don't care much for music as for the story, the concept... then, the floyd never had any love songs. i adore that fact. they never preached violence in their songs. i adore that too. they are all politicaly left-wingers, as i am. anyway, there is nobody coming close to them on my charts. although i like many others, like waits, dylan, zappa, bowie, townshend...\n\nwhat i don't like about the 'concept' of your pages is the \"let's trash the floyd\" idea because there are so much good things written about them. why couldn't you find some balance between the two? you write a whole lot of bad things about their music and then give them a '4'. it must sound verystrange to someone who just read your review. not to mention that the reader who hasn't heard the floyd before won't even bother to do so because they're so 'calculated' and overrated and gilmour-sucks-and-waters-also... ;)\n\nwell, i wanted to say a lot more but i can't really express myself very well in english:( and it's late so i'll just say goodbye and (despite the floyd issue :)) thank you for taking the time to write and assemble the best music pages i have seen so far (although \"amg all music guide\" isn't bad for a quick reference, but this is something different... more personal, for sure)...\n\nGeorge Starostin (25.04.2001)\n\nThere's my answer to Vedran which I actually mailed him but decided to post here anyway. Not that anybody's interested...\n\nHello Vedran,\n\nI think maybe my attitude towards Floyd would become a little more clear to you if you'd read my \"credentials\" - some of the stuff displayed in the introductory pages (the proper introduction and the guidelines to comment posting), as well as some of the essays, essentially essay # 3 where I have tried to define the differences between objective and subjective approaches.\n\nI do consider myself a neutral reviewer when it comes to Floyd, or, in fact, most of the bands I review here, apart from some of the five-star rated ones, maybe. I do not of course hate Pink Floyd - people who do not sense the irony in that opening line are like people who'd accuse Mick Jagger of Satanism or dub John Lennon as Antichrist.\n\nYou said something about 'balance' in one of your letters, and this is exactly what I'm trying to do. I seriously feel that for many people, Floyd have overshadowed a whole world of different and equally good, or even better music, and that is why the tone on my Floyd page is often bitter whereas, say, on the Kinks' page it is rarely bitter. Same goes for Led Zeppelin.\n\nOn the other hand, I say a lot of good things about Floyd as well, don't I? And I have my arguments. Having opinions is one thing - being able to defend them is another, and I'm always ready to defend my opinions because otherwise - as far as I see it - opinions aren't worth anything, at least not if you're willing to offer them to public view.\n\nI understand you when you say you adore Floyd for the reason that they never wrote love songs or never \"preached violence\" (although far too many bands have been accused of \"preaching violence\" when in reality they were just ironising on the subject), but it's hard to understand why writing a love song or an aggressive song is a crime against good taste in music. On the other hand, everything exists in comparison. I don't think that the lyrics of Roger Waters are particularly bad, but compared to his colleague lyricists like Lou Reed, Ian Anderson, Keith Reid, and, of course, Dylan, they are way too straightforward - often sounding like something you'd read in an old philosophy manual. Certainly, many people find it easy to identify with these lyrics because they're easy to understand - but to me, this reeks of an intentionally commercial approach. I'd take Peter Gabriel and Genesis' Selling England By The Pound over Dark Side Of The Moon any time of day partially due to that very reason: Gabriel carries through a lyrical message often similar to Roger's messages, but dressed up in a more complex, original and exciting way, allowing for different interpretations and connotations. Not so with Roger, who doesn't leave much choice for his listeners. Because, unfortunately, there are way too many listeners among Pink Floyd fans who don't want to think about their own interpretations, ready to literally accept anything that's shoved down their throats. And, by the way, I also agree with the lyrics of Roger. And I share his political views - I can easily put my signature under just about anything he wrote on The Final Cut. But you see, I also agree with lots of stuff people write in newspapers and say on talk shows. The God is not in the contents, the God is in the way you put it. And Roger doesn't put it the way that a serious, respectable XXth century artist should. He grew better in later years - Amused To Death, for instance, shows a certain maturity - but of course, it was already too late.\n\nLikewise, I don't like the general \"calculated\" style of Gilmour not because it IS calculated - but because it is intentionally calculated, drawing on \"emotional guitar cliches\", never really changing with the years, always predictable and never fresh.\n\nAs for the ratings themselves - I have discussed this problem many times, so I'll be quick about that one. On one hand, the ratings are relative - when I say \"eight\", it could mean \"nine on a particularly good day, seven on a particularly bad day\" or so. On the other hand, the ratings are objective - for instance, my review of DSOTM might show that I hate the album, or my introduction on PF might show that I hate the band, but the ratings show that the bitter tone is mostly due to my trying to strike a balance between the overrated nature of a band/album and the somewhat more cold-headed approach.\n\nSteve Hall <riseandshine99@hotmail.com> (01.05.2001)\n\nI was interested by your response to Vedran.I think i can see why you feel the way you do about Pink Floyd particularly when you have an appreciation for so much other music which lives in the shadow of them(Selling england by the pound seems your biggest grievance).I would certainly accept that there is a lack of virtuoso musicianship in Pink and most of there work does have an almost clinical sheen about it but i respect them nonetheless.\n\nI think they had some excellent strengths though,in particular the diversity in their music.Pink Floyd's catalogue is just SO diverse.I would not begin to try and compare Pink Floyd as songwriters or virtuoso musicians to Led Zep for example but how anyone can possibly believe there is any comparison when it comes to diversity in material is beyond me.Diversity in a groups output doesn't look that important when you view a band on it's own,but when you take music as a whole it is just so important.For example where would music be if everyone had the same approach as Led Zep,basically milking the same process over their entire career with just a few variations on the same proven formula.Not to say that formula wasn't original,fantastic and widely regarded but nevertheless no Zep Head can honestly say that the group went out on a limb musically or made any great and serious attempt to diversify or experiment on what went before.Pink Floyd certainly did,and not just early in their career.The Final Cut (love it or hate it)is such a removal from anything done before by the group.(or i should say Roger really,when referring to this album in particular).\n\nI would like to take issue on the remarks you make about pink (Roger)lyrically.I agree with your facts about the lyrics being more straightforward than Lou Reed or Dylan,just as The Wall is more straightforward than Tommy,but then to hint that this is commercialism is downright scandalous.I don't see how just because a concept or lyric is confused,allegorical or wrapped up in an enigma makes it less commercial.Just because someone expresses their view or emotion clearly and concisely doesn't mean it's contrived or insincere or by extension that it's listeners are ignorant sycophants suffering from some mass delusion.\"Animals\" proves that Roger could express himself lyrically under the surface as well as above it. (There's nothing scandalous here unless somebody wants to think that \"commercial\" and \"sincere\" exclude one another. They don't. There's simply this little matter of inadequacy, when Mr Waters wants to pass for a 'serious' artist, but eventually relies on cliches and tritenessese that had been stated a thousand times before him in the same way - G.S.)\n\nPink Floyd's weaknesses are well documented in your reviews and most are justified but IMHO no other group scaled such heights of creativity or success with as many inadequacies amongst the individual members.This should give inspiration to musicians and songwriters everywhere who realize they aren't Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page on the guitar or Dylan and Lennon with the notebook.\n\nferchos10 <ferchos10@cable.net.co> (14.07.2001)\n\nWell, heres what I think about Floyd.\n\nPink Floyd is my favorite \"music band\". I place those words in \"\" because I dont consider them as other standard music bands. I believe they go further. I mean, I believe \"Music\" shouldnt be just the sounds, but what they mean. If youre in for people that are experts with instruments I recommend the philarmonics, where men and women have been training like slaves all their lives. But Floyd went beyond...they chosed to forget about the classical \"girlie\" songs and moved to other issues...thats what i really like about them. I despise that most musicians have opted to do songs about girls\"\" Just girls.girlsgirlsgirlsgreoigrl.\n\nSure, Floyd had a few songs about girls, but, i repeat, they dealt with other more \"dep\" issues. And besides, the sound is pretty different as well..i mean...they are just fantastic.\n\nAnd another thing about your review, George,...i strongly disagree with you saying that The Wall (movie) sucked.. thing is.. that thing is not a movie.. its just a pretty darned long Music Video..and a pretty cool one too. Ask around (with acerage people) and most of them wont even know that this movie exists, thus proving that it was not intended to \"make money\". (OK, it may prove it didnt made money, but do you really think that a 100 minute music video was aimed just to make money??).\n\nSo, thats it : Pink Floyd is just more than average \"music\"..and thats why everybody knows the name, but very few have listened to much more than just \"another brick 2\".\n\nA.E. <tpm@online.ru> (25.11.2001)\n\nIf the God has created the universe, PF has created Music. Everything before PF was humble attempts at being Music anything after PF - poor takeoffs. PF is grander than PF self.\n\nNoam Sugarman <n_sugarman@hotmail.com> (15.12.2001)\n\nhey man, i don't have too much to say, but i think it has to be said. There seems to be a misconception over Floyd's improv skills. Sure, his live solos post-dark side bear striking resemblance to the studio version, but this is by no fault of his own. By this period in Floydian history, their shows had little to do with music and more to do with visuals, and so their playing had to be very consistent. they couldn't go for crazy improv jams a la phish (by the way, you should review those geniuses). It annoys me that from say '74 and onwards, there was absolutely no spontanaeity to floyd's live performances, and that includes the filler jams from the live wall album. they got caught up with flying pigs and animated films in the background. However, listen to the live stuff pre-dark side, which you'll have to resort to bootlegs for, and you'll hear floyd at their improvisational best. I especially mean Wright and Gilmour. the live portion of Ummagumma is somewhat of an exception because they knew in advance it was going on the album, so they couldn't go too far out there. However, they would expand songs like cymbaline, fat old sun and green is the colour, just to name a few, into long, funky and bluesy jams that were fantastic. There is a particular version of 'Fat Old Sun' in which Wright mesmerizes me on the Hammond. They also often did Blues jams in which Gilmour does an absolutely fantastic job. He just pours the emotion into that guitar of his. And furthermore, I wouldn't necesarily say that his studio solos are so 'calculated', and even if they are, most of Clapton's studio solos sound just as calculated and sometimes his live versions don't differ that greatly. as for Gilmour's tone, it ain't my favourite, but it's really nice nonetheless. not that i would condemn anyone for not liking it, it's a totally subjective issue. Just thought i would stick up for Floyd's musicianship, since so many people seem to be knocking it.\n\nOh yes, you wanted to know about those who contribute. well, I'm an 18 year old from Toronto. I obviously love Floyd, along with the Beatles, Clapton, Phish, the Doors, etc. I would say that it's the beatles and floyd that I listen to the most, and i also love Syd Barrett's first solo album ( i haven't heard his second), it brings me quite close to tears. As far as other interests goes, i like reading, writing poetry, being with close friends and travelling. I'm dying to travel. I wouldn't say i have a favourite guitarist, it really depends on my mood. sometimes I'll be buried in Clapton's unplugged album, other times i'll be restricting myself to Floyd for Gilmour's sound. The most important thing that music has to have is emotion, which is why i enjoy floyd and the Beatles so much, not that i would ever touch early beatles pop-garbage. My favourite Keyboard player is Page McConnel from phish, and i don't have a favourite bassist. Oh, and another reason i love floyd is because of roger waters' socialist rantings, like on Animals, which i consider to be the most brilliant album ever made. That's it for me.\n\n<AlexJericho@aol.com> (23.12.2001)\n\nI have never really heard much about them being very overrated.\n\nBig radio hits? The only songs I have ever heard from them on radio are 'Money' and 'ABITWp.2'.\n\nSelling out shows? That mostly had to do with the theatrical atmosphere they (the shows) had, something I don't consider as part of the music. And hey, all that means was that they were pretty damn popular, not overrated. People don't pay 50 bucks to see a show because they heard a band was great, but because they see talent there.\n\nAnd the melodies? Well, I think it's good that they didn't always have great melodies (assuming your opinion is correct). That way, people can be more appreciative of a clever riff or good drum track.\n\nBen Kramer <bkramer2000@hotmail.com> (25.12.2001)\n\nWow, Floyd fans are harsh on you George. You gave them a 4, an outstanding grade only surpassed by the 4 artists who started rock and influenced it to go in the direction it went. Pink Floyd has an indescribable sound at most times. They weren't great musicians, and they weren't great song writers. However, something that they had enabled them to have an excellent sound on the majority of their albums. Why? I don't know. I don't want to get into everything because I want to talk about their albums individually. I used to be obsessed, mainly with the Wall and Wish You Were Here and I'd flame you for not giving them 15/15's a few months ago. Now, my collection has grown and my tastes have matured so no I prefer Quadrophenia over The Wall and Animals over Wish You Were Here (this used to be my favorite album after the Wall was). Now, my favorites are Animals, Meddle (we can't always agree George), Piper, Dark Side, and Ummagumma (especially the live disc). Some of my favorite Floyd songs are 'Bike', 'Set the Controls...', 'Cymbaline', 'A Saucerful Of Secrets', 'Echoes', 'Summer 68', 'Arnold Lane', 'Wot's.. uh the Deal', 'Time', 'Us and Them', 'One of These Days', 'Shine on... 1-5', 'Wish You Were Here', 'Dogs', 'Sheep', 'Pigs (Three Different Ones)', 'Mother', 'Comfortably Numb', 'The Final Cut' and 'Southampton Dock'. There are others but I won't get into too much detail. What I like most about them is the way they experimented with sounds. Zappa was great in all, but Pink Floyd must have come up with some mathematical or scientifical experimentation system to create original music. Unfortunately they lost this quality after Dark Side, but they did it for 7 albums, not bad. So they are overrated, underrated, loved hated, ... but whatever anyone says, they are a great band with a lot of ideas and interesting gimmicks. I agree with your rating of a 4, it's a very solid rating.\n\nListenability - 4/5 - some crap but mostly good-great songs\n\nResonance - 4/5 - This is their high point later on, they were pretty resonant early on as well, but the Final Cut clinches a 4/5\n\nOriginality - 4/5 - They were original for 7 years and they had a lot of great ideas. That went down as time went on but they did what they had to do early on\n\nAdequacy - 4/5 - Only on a couple occasions (Atom Heart Mother ring a bell?) when they couldn't be considered adequate\n\nDiversity - 3/5 - 5/5 for the early days but none later on so a 1/5, averaging to a 3/5\n\nOverall=3.8=**** on the rating scale\n\nI don't own any Gilmour lead Floyd, maybe that's why you gave a 3.6 rather than a 3.8, and I might lower the 3.8 if I heard it.\n\nMattias Lundberg <lundbergmattias@hotmail.com> (30.01.2002)\n\nAfter reading the crude mixture of intelligent arguments and disturbingly unintelligent generalizations above, I feel exasperated. How one could call Pink Floyd UNDERRATED (M.Jarvie, above) is beyond me, I mean it's like calling the Beatles underrated. You cannot get more recognition from a wider spectrum of individuals than these two bands do. Without comparing the two, it is interesting to note one similarity between them; their lack of distinguished instrumentalists was their strength. They HAD to rely on craftsmanship and meticulous editing of their music, which is what makes those magically undated and carefully moderated details interesting. And you can't really call Pink Floyd a progressive band, their music was not particularly groundbreaking or complicated (although their echo effects and studio techniques might have been), neither could they readily be compared to prog bands proper, since they tried to do something altogether different (atmospheric effects per se has got nothing to do with prog). The only thing they share with these bands is the aspect of over-blown pretentiousness (bless them....). I do conceive Gilmour's playing as truly inspired, and it has got a stunning vocal quality to it. His tactful restraint is a rarity in popular music altogether; lack of instrumental skill has - in most cases - never stopped a guitarist from making a fool of himself. The question whether his solos were improvised or results of endless editing of studio takes is immaterial; Pink Floyd were recording artists (thus they relied even more heavily on effects when they had to enter a stage).\n\n\"The 70s were a dark period for serious music...\"(K.Keplar, above) Is this a bad joke or just a typographic error ? Please correct it, or spare us from this kind of cheeky humour.\n\nMichael Egan <termite@chartermi.net> (07.06.2002)\n\nAbout Pink Floyd - I was one of the few people in America who got into them before Dark Side of the Moon. I agree that Obscured by Clouds is very underrated. Even though I liked DSOTM a lot, the later albums seemed as if they had a lot of instrumental padding. 'Crazy Diamond' just didn't do it for me; I thought Animals was more consistent, and although the Wall had great songs, it was also fragmented - I kept hoping they'd just forget all the Waters inspired concept artsy stuff and just do another album of good songs like Obscured By Clouds. But they never did ...\n\nBenjamin Massey <b_massey@bigfoot.com> (15.07.2002)\n\nHaving already commented on Genesis, I feel morally obliged to comment on Pink Floyd, which is my favorite band of all time (I can just hear the sound of a million fingers hitting 'Page Down' after reading that sentence. :)\n\nBut wait! I'm a fan, not a fanatic. I'll be objective, and start off by hitting some Floyd negatives just to prove it. Their Big Three (Wish You Were Here, The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon) are all hideously overrated. Most of their work after The Wall was total tripe, and I'm not overly fond of anything pre-DSotM. Nick Mason simply cannot operate a drum set, and everyone in that band not named 'Roger' is an unspectacular-at-best musician.\n\nBut (oh, here it is...) they're a very good band. I'll steer clear of oozing over their Big Three (as I so cliched-ly put it), but A Momentarily Lapse of Reason is the polar opposite of DSotM - far and away their most underrated album. 'On The Turning Away' is, in my opinion, quite possibly the best song they ever did and their only _really_ good one after The Wall. I still like 'The Dogs of War' and 'Signs of Life', even if all that 'New Machine' tripe is...er, tripe. :)\n\nI am also (like you, it seems) _extremely_ fond of the Animals album. I'd call it their Most Underrated, except that such a big deal has been made of it being so underrated that it is, quite simply, not underrated anymore. 'Pigs on the Wing' (I and II) is simply beautiful, and there is nothing else on that album which I would call less-than-brilliant. I love that album...it is eternally within my CD disc- changer. I bow at its altar.\n\nOh, and that Dark Side of your Mooning, and that The Mall one, they're pretty good too. Whatever they're called. :)\n\nJon <gray0187@tc.umn.edu> (25.07.2002)\n\nLike anyone who \"hates\" the Beatles, there are no reasons, just excuses. Everything you mention as justification for your hate is to be found in bands you profess to like(in some incarnation). The fact is, to hate Floyd, or at least later Floyd, is quite hip, and definitely so for those who like to like the Beatles. There is nothing really to hate about the band, but indifference or disinterest regarding them is certainly possible. That's where I stand with the Beatles, and I believe that's where you stand with Floyd. Don't call it hate, unless it's just to stir up indignant and defensive responses from all us rabid, neanderthal fans who champion our bands like a crowd of lemmings. :)\n\nBruno Müller <muller@ccard.com.br> (23.08.2002)\n\nHi, George\n\nYou see, if you, who claim to hate Pink Floyd, intend to make an objective evaluation of the band, than I, that LOVE Pink Floyd, believe that I have the right to try to do the same thing and try to expose why I believe the band deserves a general rate of 5 in your scale.\n\nThey were all very professional musicians, that played quite well (I refer especially to the post-Barret era), although they were not virtuoses. Of course, professionalism alone means nothing. And, on the other hand, who said that only virtuoses can make great music? The fact is: they managed to create beautiful melodies in a great variety of styles with their instruments.\n\nFrom this moment, I proclaim Dave Gilmour the most underrated guitar player of rock history. Yeah, I know, hes neither Clapton, nor Howe. Yet, its a long way from not-being a guitar God and being mediocre. Hes got enough skill and a unique style. Actually, Id say hes the Miles Davis of rock, in the way that both handled their instruments  soft, minimalistic, and yet intense. Hes solos are definitely not soulless, like you say. They bring along a lot of emotion. Hes solos are never self-indulgent and have never a single note beyond necessary. And, if you care to compare hes solos from live and studio recordings, you might realise that this guy never played a solo twice. In the very Miles tradition, he makes use of the general riffs and hooks associated to those solos and then improvises whole new melodies over the same base. That makes him quite a good improviser and not exactly the soulless mathematician that you say he is. He can improvise, hes not self-indulgent and hes extremely melodic. What else should I ask for?\n\nRoger Waters  there are only three men in rock that might be comparable to him (and maybe surpass him) when we talk about lyrics: Pete Townshend, Bob Dylan and John Lennon. I wouldnt try to pick which of these men is the best. But the four of them are the best. You see, Roger brought MEANING to prog rock. Forget about fairy tales, stupid medieval heroes and pretentious adaptations of literature. Roger lyrics MEANT something, produced very good metaphors and induced you to THINK. Hes not an simple lyricist. Hes a poet.\n\nPink Floyd, the band, never followed fashions. They either expanded styles or created landmarks. They were a daring and original band, and not only about incorporating sound effects. The Piper expanded psychedelic rock. A Saucerful of Secrets made an effective bridge from psychedelic to progressive rock, in 68. In 1969 they were already experimenting with Ummagumma  like it or not, we must accept their originality. The Dark Side of the Moon expanded and brought meaning to prog rock  at last, a prog band that REALLY had something to say (along with Jethro Tull  and maybe, the early Genesis  I admit, but yet a point above). The peak of their revolutionary creation was The Wall, that pointed to another landmark, a new horizon to prog-rock. Why? This is regarded as a response to the punk movement, gave the exhausted prog scene a breathe of fresh air and gave life, in stage, to the concept of rock-opera. Unfortunatelly, that moment wasnt captured by anyone  even Roger Waters. The band ran out of gas. But why complain about that when they had more than a decade of good services to rocknroll?\n\nTalking more about their originality  that costed the band the respect of diehard proggers, who urged for instrument heroes and complex melodies and labeled them as unpure, sold out and other stupidities. Elitists like some proggers are, many of them cant recognize artistic value in anything that reaches the masses, like Floyd managed to do. Floyd didnt simply stick to the prog tradition and made series of albums that had hardly anything to do with each other, musically  displaying their diversity and ecleticism. More, for instance, is an impressive minimalistic album, except for a few rocknroll songs. Atom Heart Mother is the only symphonic piece in the tradition followed by Yes and ELP. Wish You Were Here, despite any other consideration, is a true masterpiece. And I tell you why: it is an extremely well written concept album, in which Roger Waters managed to make almost a social study, combining the critic of the whole society (Welcome to the Machine) to the impact of it in a common man (Wish You Were Here) by the means of the musical industry (Have a Cigar). I made a raw division, because each song, indeed, deals with all these scales, only changing the enphasis. Yeah, but what about the music? Here are presented some of the most beautiful guitar and keyboards solos in rock history, I see no aimless jams  its simply beauty. And its symphonic piece (Shine on ) relies completely on rock instruments  its not classic instruments making classic rock, or rock instruments emulating classic sounds. Its the true meaning of classic rock  a classic piece played by rock musicians. And let me tell you that all Pink Floyd music is rather catchy, or at least listenable, to the average rock listener, except for the punks or the popsters. You rarely hear from a rock fan any accusation of boredom laying upon Pink Floyd, and the guys really knew how to rock.\n\nThat said, let me borrow your categories of rating, I mean, if I understood them well:\n\nListenability  Except for excerts of Ummagumma and Piper , they were always into making music, and this music is very melodic and effective  they could do anything well. At least 4, Id give 5.\n\nResonance  They settled new standards and landmarks. Once you get to Rogers lyrics and Daves solos, they stick to your head forever. Besides, one might not like Pink Floyd, but simply could never ignore them. The whole punk movement intended to dismiss the band, only managing to better display their importance (whod care if I wore a shirt saying I Hate Jefferson Airplane?). This has to be a 5.\n\nAdequacy  Like I said, music is their business. And Roger always had something to say. Embarassment was never a created, at least in the golden age. 5.\n\nDiversity  They never kept under the boundaries of ordinary prog rock. In Floyd catalogue, youll find simple rocknroll, blues, jazz, psychedelia, moody prog, space prog, symphonic prog, plus many crossing-overs of different stlyles in the same song (the blues-prog of Money, for instance). Besides, their records never sounded the same. Ummagumma is entirely different from More that is entirely different from Dark Side that is entirely different from Wish You Were Here (I see this as a couterpoint to Dark Side, indeed), that is entirely different from The Wall, and so it goes. 5.\n\nPS: By the way, Im not a fan of Pink Floyd just to create an alternative to the Beatles. I love them both and I believe that, in a certain way, Pink Floyd was a follower of the Beatles tradition, experimenting, expanding sounds, pushing the boundaries. Actually, Roger is a huge fan of John Lennon and Dave, a close friend to Paul McCartney, but you must already know that.\n\nFederico Fernández <fedefer@fibertel.com.ar> (08.10.2002)\n\nOK, after all you don't seem to hate the Floyd THAT much. Otherwise you wouldn't rate them with a 4. That was sort of a relief. Here are some considerations I'd like to point about your group's review.\n\nFirst of all: Yes, I can't argue about Gilmour's solos being generic and soulless, but I guess that that applies to their later albums, you know, those nausea-inducing solos of The Division Bell. BUT his solos on songs like \"Echoes\", \"One Of These Days\", \"Dogs\", \"Sheep\", \"Pigs\" and \"Breathe\" are really distinct, powerful and almost emotional... there is no real reason to deslike them (The ones in \"Money\" and \"Time\" though, no matter how much I love that songs, aren't so amazing and, yes, they are generic) Plus his job on some songs in The Wall is really nice (Another Brick In The Wall 1 & 2 being the obvious highlights). Ok, most of the times THEY ARE coldly calculated, counted out and mathematicaly precise but that ain't necessary a bad thing is it? You know, classical music is ALL calculated and precise and that doesn't prevent it from being great. Plus, George Harrison's playing is even more calculated and you like it. Plus, YOU KNOW what happens when the \"improvisation instinct\" goes too far away (ahem, Layla, ahem). When the effect is right, I don't mind if its all about improvisation or calculation, and the guitar solos in the jam of \"Echoes\" hits me right in the soul.\n\nAbout the melodies. You're right; they weren't the Beatles, they weren't Queen, they weren't McCartney, but Pink Floyd isn't about the melodies, is about atmosphere. And what powerful, intimidating, GREAT atmospheres they did!!! They penned some pretty good melodies though, not terribly hook-filled and catchy but pleasant enough: \"Breathe\", \"Time\", \"Echoes\", \"San Tropez\", OK, they are few. You got me.\n\nI love Pink Floyd... but you're right in many things you said. They were primitive players, so they were quite simpler than other progressive groups as Yes & Genesis, but, because of that, far more efficient, entertaining, rocking, wise and hard hitting than those overcomplicated (boring) ramblings from Anderson, Gabriel and Co. Not that I deslike those grops, mind you. Genesis is great!!! but not as great as old Floyd.\n\nSean <tsimpson@hcis.net> (13.02.2003)\n\nHello...I found your site interesting. But one thing concerns me so far regarding your view of Floyd...\n\nFirst, you say, \"As for Gilmour, well, I just don't like the guy's guitar - I consider it generic and soulless. All of his 'classic' solos are so mathematically precise,\"\n\nThen you say, \" 'Careful With That Axe, Eugene' is nothing short of a perfect composition, and I do mean perfect: in the sense that not a note is wasted, the song and its structure are almost mathematically calculated.\"\n\nIn the first example, you use the notion of mathematical precision of note placement as a bad thing, in the second example, you cite it as one of the reasons you consider the song perfect.\n\nWhich is it?\n\nIf I may ask.\n\n[Special author note: Both! I have nothing against \"mathematically calculated\" music in general - but Gilmour's solos still bug me in the wrong way because they're played sort of in a \"spontaneous-oriented\" setting. In other words, take a guy like Eric Clapton and he could tear your soul out in the exact same spots as Dave does without having to resort to careful calculation. In these spots, I treasure improvisation and spontaneous feeling much more than anything \"pre-written\". That's not to say every 'heavenly' solo ever played by E.C. is a priori better than any 'heavenly' solo ever played by Dave, I'm making a very approximate generalization here, prone to exceptions of all kind.]\n\n<KwameTure@aol.com> (06.03.2003)\n\nGeorge, I agree with your assesment of Floyd as musicians; they weren't very technically gifted. What I hate the most about Floyd is that they are so corporate. Everything that came out after the Wall is absolute garbage that the band put out to make a lousy buck, hence I dont buy pink floyd music in any form. But I disagree with you George about everything else. Dave Gilmore is a guitar God. And I know that he is mathematical in his solos and that he is a money grubbing scumbag (as is Roger Waters), but he has so many amazing solos. It might be dentristy but it makes me cry. I think its really that simple. I don't analyse music, I just let it flow through me; I don't listen to it I try to experience and listening to floyd is a crazy experience. The reason Pink Floyd is loved by so many millions of fans is that people can identify with the music. They don't care that Roger was so-so on bass and wrote straight forward lyrics or that Rick Wright and Nick Mason were just like any run of the mill session men. The only thing they know is that Floyd music is the type of music that can save your life and that it hits them in the heart. Thats the difference between critics and fans. When youre a critic you have to break down the music and analyse it as music. I dont care about the melodies, the bass parts individually as pieces of the song but thier composite effect;I just care for something that I can listen to and that is deep. So what if Roger wrote banal lyrics or if they were preachy; I identify with them and thats all that matters to me. I think thats what matters to most people. See George Im from the hood, inner city type shit and when I play floyd to my friends that have never heard them they dont say \"Dave thats a crappy melody\" or \" Yo, Roger is shit on bass\" they just bop their head and listen to the lyrics and say \"That shit is crazy\" or \"that shit is deep\" because thats what they feel.\n\nI only found out about Floyd last year when they were running all those commercials for \"Echoes\" (even though you cant do a PF greatest hits because it would have to be their classic 70s albums in entirety, just another infamous cash in) I just liked the music and I thought it was cool so I burned DSOM and was blown away for 43 minutes. Of course Obscured by Clouds is musically better than DSOM, but nobody identifies with it. Then of course I got into all their other albums from the 1970s because Im not a big fan of Syd's crazy shit. Thier best album is of course Animals. \"Dogs\" and \"Echoes\" are probably Pink Floyd's greatest songs ever, but the first time I heard \"Dogs\" I was astounded. The lyrics are straight forward and desperate; that means that you dont need to have a BA to understand them. The guitar solos are amazing and the ending of that song is probably the best lyrical ending to a Pink Floyd song. \"Pigs\" has excellent bass work. I don't care that anyone can play it. And the ending makes me cry with that bass riff that goes up and down and that ripping guitar solo by dave wow!!! I also don't understand how you can say that the reprise of \"Shine On\" sucks. That is such an amazing jam!! The synths the guitars everything and then it slows down and Roger sings \"Nobody knows where you are, how near or how far.\" Jesus Christ!!! The music of Pink Floyd hits me in the heart and the lyrics hit me in the brain and the heart. Roger Waters is a lyrical genious, not by some abstract standard, but because millions and millions of people feel that shit. Just like the Stones said \"Its only Rock and Roll\" thats what it is. We can't over analyse the shit because it is what it is to the person thats listening to it. Also I partly disagree with your review of the Wall Live. Of course it was a cash in and they don't even play the first couple of numbers, but you can't see that on the CD. They should release the video if they have it (bastards). That live version rocks so hard and Roger sounds so menacing. Of course the album is better and it also sucks that they edited out the crowd noise, but Pink Floyd is a highly commercial and corporate band. I don't care that Roger Waters hates fans because I have more important stuff in my life to worry about (actually fuck Roger as a person). All I know is I love everything from Meddle until the Wall and that PF is my favorite rock band because they speak to me.\n\n<Risingstar1110@aol.com> (25.03.2003)\n\nFirst off Pink Floyd is the greatest \"band\" to date.
