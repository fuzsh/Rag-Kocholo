        "text": "Pink Floyd is a British progressive rock band that was formed in London in 1965. Over the years, the band has been known for its distinctive sound and experimental approach to music. Despite achieving great success and critical acclaim, there has been some debate over whether Pink Floyd should be considered “pop music.”\n\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, pop music is defined as “commercially-oriented music intended for a wide audience and characterized by a catchy melody and simple, rhythmic structure.” By this definition, it could be argued that Pink Floyd does not fit the criteria of pop music. Their music often features complex arrangements, lengthy instrumental sections, and abstract lyrics that are not necessarily geared towards mainstream appeal.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that Pink Floyd did achieve significant commercial success in their career. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), Pink Floyd has sold over 75 million certified units in the United States alone. This includes 19 gold, 14 platinum, and 8 multi-platinum albums. Additionally, some of their most well-known songs, such as “Another Brick in the Wall” and “Money,” have become radio staples and are recognizable to many people outside of the rock music community.\n\nDespite this success, it is still a matter of debate whether Pink Floyd can truly be classified as pop music. The band’s complex song structures and experimental approach to music often defy the conventions of mainstream pop music. However, their commercial success and recognizable hits do suggest that their music has had broad appeal beyond just fans of progressive rock."
