        "text": "Emerging from the burgeoning underground music scene in late 1960s London, Pink Floyd was one of the first bands to bring psychedelia to British audiences. Formed at what is now the University of Westminster, the original incarnation of the band featured architecture students Roger Waters, Nick Mason, and Richard Wright. Waters soon brought in his childhood friend, Roger ‘Syd’ Barrett, as the band’s singer, guitarist, and principal songwriter.\n\nWith Barrett at the creative helm, Pink Floyd became a pioneering act in the emerging genre of psychedelic rock. Barrett guided the group through their 1967 debut, ‘The Piper at the Gates of Dawn’. However, Barrett’s use of hallucinogenic drugs began to affect his mental health, and his erratic behaviour eventually caused his bandmates to bring in one of Barrett’s friends, David Gilmour, as a substitute guitarist and singer.\n\nAfter a brief period as a quintet, Barrett was officially removed from the band after 1968’s ‘A Saucerful of Secrets’, although he remained a focal point for the band’s lyrical obsessions with madness. For the next three years, the lineup of Gilmour, Mason, Waters, and Wright released experimental albums like 1969’s ‘Ummagumma’ and 1970’s ‘Atom Heart Mother’ while attempting to find their creative direction without Barrett. The breakthrough came with 1971’s ‘Meddle’, where Pink Floyd embraced the complexities of progressive rock.\n\nThe combination of Waters’ philosophical lyrics and Gilmour’s bluesy musical style became the band’s signature. In 1973, Pink Floyd released ‘The Dark Side of the Moon’, which quickly became one of the most popular and frequently cited rock albums in history. Over the next half-decade, Pink Floyd continued to be one of the most popular band’s in the world with albums like 1975’s ‘Wish You Were Here’ and 1977’s ‘Animals’. All the while, their ever-evolving stage show made them one of the biggest concert draws in the world.\n\nPersonal relations within the band reached a breaking point by 1979’s ‘The Wall’. Waters exerted near-total creative control, causing friction with the rest of the members. Wright was fired by Waters before the album’s scheduled tour but was retained as a live performer. The tension carried over to 1983’s ‘The Final Cut’, with Waters electing to leave the band in 1985 and expecting the group to break up.\n\nHowever, Gilmour and Mason eventually retained the rights to the Pink Floyd name and released 1987’s ‘A Momentary Lapse in Reason’ as a duo. Wright officially rejoined the lineup for 1994’s ‘The Divison Bell’, with the band going on hiatus after the accompanying tour. The classic lineup of Gilmour, Mason, Waters, and Wright reunited for a performance at Live 8 in 2005. Barrett died in 2006, while Wright died in 2008.\n\nPink Floyd remains one of the most influential and successful rock bands of all time. Their album sales have topped out at an estimated 250 million units, making them one of the best-selling artists of all time. As the preeminent progressive rock band of the 1970s, Pink Floyd continue to influence new generations of musicians, from their psychedelic origins to their grand concept albums and beyond."
