        "text": "Attending a Floyd Nation concert is so much more than listening to live music and watching a light show. This group delivers an authentic experience connecting them to their fans on a deep and soulful level. Some call it theater, others call it brilliant, and most say if you close your eyes you'll swear you're listening to Pink Floyd themselves.\n\nComposed of a group of US-based musicians who are true fans of the music, Floyd Nation strives to carefully re-create the music, and more importantly the \"feel\" of Pink Floyd. They then deliver it with an impactful and highly personal experience.\n\nTheir concerts span a vast collection of albums such as The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon, Animals, Wish You Were Here, Meddle and The Division Bell.\n\nFloyd Nation embodies the art, legacy and spirit of Pink Floyd that conveys a deep respect for the music created by one of the most awe-inspiring bands to ever take the world stage.\n\nWhen you attend one of Floyd Nation's live performances you'll be immersed in sound, lights, and lasers. You'll quickly develop an emotional connection to the group as they take you on an epic journey, bringing back your best memories of the greatest music ever created."
