And after the 1968 exit of original mastermind Syd Barrett, as they moved from small clubs to stadiums, the band organically inched toward the flash and muscle of hard rock.

        "text": "Classic Rock and their entire franchise of figleaf fortunes seem to have been consistently dedicated to the task of assuming and conjuring up a charicature of rock-cultural history for marketing and merchandising ideas beyond their \"organic\" lifespan. With the complete collapse in music journalism and accountable reference in discourse, any which way goes as far as angle and perspective on a subject is concerned. Thus they keep on flogging corpse-horses, and the faintest scent of friction as to challenges of stereotype in telling \"rock stories\" is shunned for what it used to be - dialogue - as opposed to what it's now apparently supposed to be - confirmation.\n\nPink Floyd were known for not being very \"heavy\" by the standards of 70s hard rock and later punk and post-punk, so why not prove all adversaries wrong by applying those adversaries' own limitations of the term \"heaviness\"? Make it into something confirming Mick Wall's definition or what else; \"heavy\" is when you have a thin sting of flingy-ding to your distorted guitar and act tough'enough with it, hopefully also visually and physically. Preferably by high-hair factor effect. But the Crazy World of Arthur Brown's first album was recorded in early winter of 1968 and contained no stuffy electric guitar, rather it had an infinitely more resourceful instrumental base in Hammond versus drums and voice and still comes off as far louder than ensuing hard rock convulsions.\n\nEveryone who was ever in a rock group himself and stood up against other musicians on stage, knows that the guitar is the least naturally powerful app in a band, and that this is the embarrassing reason why the amps still need to be adjusted for '11'. But if you're doing \"Interstellar Overdrive\" and turning frequencies on an audio-generator for soundpaint, you don't have to pretend meanness by jugging off a faint distortion from your guitar. Heaviness can emanate from pure idea of tone or selection.\n\nThere are those who won't approve of the first three minutes' part in \"Larks' Tongues\" because it disturbs the assumed logic of heavy metal intention in the song, usually rationalized by retroactive points of acclamation. And the ones who'd rather have the lengthy passages of dreamlike improvisation in \"Moonchild\" removed to see the song being redefined as something else. And then you have those who'd wish for some bands to actually be completely other bands and make either more or less of either this and that, and consequently reimagine ideas for themselves. As for Pink Floyd, this one works or doesn't, but it wasn't intended to stand on its own:"
