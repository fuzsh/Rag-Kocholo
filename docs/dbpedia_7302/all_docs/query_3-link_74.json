        "text": "I think the Best Answer to the question by the OP is the First 3 Albums(Identity, All Rights Removed & The Greatest Show on Earth) with those 2nd 3rd Albums being their Best Albums-IMO. Airbag also have released 2 more Albums, since that time, including one a Few Years Ago.\n\nTheir Guitarist, Bjorn Riis, has a Guitar Sound, that I thought he was the Son of David Gilmour, even though he and his Band are from Norway. Riis also has released a few Solo Albums, which are similar to the Airbag Albums musically. If one misses Pink Floyd from the Wish You Weâ€™re Here & Animals Era, then Airbag and Riis seems like you can own more Pink Floyd Albums, which are not actually Pink Floyd. Anyways, I would first recommend that you stream All Rights Removed & The Greatest Show on Earth, if interested to explore their Music, then you can stream their other Albums for further exploration.\n\nA few people here have mentioned Porcupine Tree, but their 1990s Delerium Years Albums were more related to the the Space-Rock Era of Pink Floyd, so not similar to their Animals Album. The Post 2000 Porcupine Tree Albums are mostly Hard Rock and even Metal, so outside of the Song, Time Flies from The Incident, not really the type of Music, which sounds like the Songs on Animals. Those Post 2000 Porcupine Tree Albums sound like Music, which fans of Riverside might enjoy, or vice versa.\n\nA few people mentioned Tangerine Dream. I have yet explored their Entire Discography, although Electronic Meditation might appeal to people, who like the Pink Floyd Album, A Saucerful of Secrets. Possibly also some of the Songs on those other Early Tangerine Dream Albums(included in the Pink Years Box Set), as the Music is Experimental."
