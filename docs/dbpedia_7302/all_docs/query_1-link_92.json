        "text": "Pink Floyd was an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining a following as a psychedelic band, they were distinguished for their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics, and elaborate live shows. They became a leading band of the progressive rock genre. They are one of popular music's most commercially successful and influential groups.\n\nMembers\n\nRoger Waters – bass, vocals, rhythm guitar (1965–1985, 2005)\n\nDavid Gilmour – lead and rhythm guitars, vocals, bass, keyboards (1967–1995, 2005, 2012–2014)\n\nNick Mason – drums, percussion, vocals (1965–1995, 2005, 2012–2014)\n\nRichard Wright – keyboards, piano, organ, vocals (1965–1979, 1987–1995, 2005)\n\nSyd Barrett – lead and rhythm guitars, vocals (1965–1968)\n\nWhy They Were On the Dark Side of the Moon (In a Good Way)\n\nRoger Waters, David Gilmour, and Richard Wright were great vocalists.\n\nTheir music is usually simple in its structures; other progressive rock acts would play a thousand notes and switch tempos and time keys every few bars. Pink Floyd could play twenty minutes on two chords.\n\nThe sense of progression in their songs usually comes from changes in intensity. It was all about aligning with breath, feelings, and mood when they performed.\n\nThey have great to amazing production, most notably thanks to their guitars and drums; for example, their song \"Comfortably Numb\" has guitar solos with great audio effects.\n\nThey're mixing is amazing because their instruments do not overshadow each other, and their vocals can be heard along with said instruments, such as their drums and guitars.\n\nThe lyrics in their songs often bordered on absolute genius and dealt with serious topics.\n\nThey're one of the most experimental bands ever, playing things like psychedelic, acid, jazz, etc.\n\nThey made high-quality albums like (and especially) The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall.\n\nSpeaking of The Dark Side of the Moon, that album is famously known for its classic cover art that depicts a prism dispersing white light into colours, which is beautiful. Not only this, it's also known as one of the most iconic (album) cover arts of all time, besides the famous cover in which the members of the Beatles walk across the street from their album Abbey Road.\n\nThe Only Bad Quality\n\nTheir albums like Ummagumma, A Momentary Lapse of Reason, and The Endless River received mixed to negative reviews.\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums"
