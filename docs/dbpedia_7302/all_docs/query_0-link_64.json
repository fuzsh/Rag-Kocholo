        "text": "There are distinct eras of Pink Floyd's sound. (1) The Syd Barrett era (1966-'67): Barrett was responsible for most of the writing, which was very psychedelic, lyrics often being a recollection of LSD trips and weird imagery. (2) The \"post-Syd\" era (1968-'69): After Syd's departure, the band searched for a new direction, becoming more experimental with their equipment while trying to retain melody, eventually perfecting \"their sound\" with 1973's \"Dark Side of the Moon\". (3) The \"Waters\" era (1973-1985): From 1976 to 1979, Roger Waters gradually became the sole creator of Pink Floyd's music and lyrics, leaving in 1985 certain that the band couldn't continue without him. (4) The \"Gilmour\" era (1986-2008): David Gilmour proved that Pink Floyd could continue without Waters until the death of co-founder Richard Wright in 2008.\n\nWhen Roger Waters and David Gilmour struggled to find the right 'voice' during the making of their album \"Wish You Were Here\" (1975), singer-songwriter friend Roy Harper was invited in to provide vocals on the \"Have a Cigar\" track.\n\nHonored by a set of 10 British commemorative postage stamps released 7 July 2016. One of the group's album covers is featured on each of six stamps (The Piper At The Gates of Dawn; Atom Heart Mother; The Dark Side Of The Moon; Wish You Were Here; Animals; The Endless River). The remaining four stamps, issued in a souvenir sheet, reproduce photographs of the band in concert.\n\nThey are widely considered to have recorded some of the greatest concept albums of all time. Their 1973 album \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" topped Classic Rock Magazine's list of the 30 greatest concept albums of all time. Their 1979 album \"The Wall\" came tenth and their 1983 album \"The Final Cut\" came 21st on the list. [March 2003].\n\nAt the end of the band's \"Money\" (from \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" (1973)), the voice mumbling the words, \"I was out of my mind, yes absolutely drunk . . . I certainly wasn't right . . . I don't know, I was really drunk at the time . . . \" belongs to \"Wings\" guitarist Henry McCullough. Pink Floyd recorded Dark Side at Abbey Road Studios where Paul McCartney and Wings were recording \"Red Rose Speedway\" (1973), and the band members mingled frequently during the sessions."
