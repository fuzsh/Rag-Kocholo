        "text": "With their unwavering dedication to delivering authentic and awe-inspiring performances, Pinky and the Floyd (hailing from Bozeman, MT) have earned a revered reputation as one of the most dynamic & exciting bands to pay tribute to the music of Pink Floyd. The band is also recognized as one of the “Top 10 Pink Floyd Tribute Bands” according to protributebands.com.\n\n“Pinky and the Floyd is the Northwest’s Hottest Pink Floyd Tribute Band!”\n\nThe band is known for curating some unforgettable setlists and stage productions, setting the standard for how the music of Pink Floyd is preserved and presented. Often performing albums in their entirety, Pinky has 7 full albums, and nearly 100 Pink Floyd songs in their repertoire.\n\n“Pinky and the Floyd is Montana’s Most Electrifying Live Experience.”\n\nIn an effort to stand out, Pinky and the Floyd strive to evoke the essence of Pink Floyd’s groundbreaking music while infusing their own unique energy into each performance. Whether it’s an intimate theater or a roaring festival stage, Pinky is an unforgettable spectacle that captivates audiences (of all ages) while reigniting the eternal flame of Pink Floyd’s legacy.\n\nLuke Flansburg – Guitar / Vocals:\n\nLuke was one of the founding members of Pinky in 2007. He says he’s tickled pink getting to emulate one of his guitar heroes [David Gilmour], while recreating his most beloved album of all time, Darkside of the Moon. As co-owner of Jereco Studios and Peach Street Studios, Luke’s life revolves around the Bozeman music scene, as either a performer or a sound engineer. You can currently catch Luke performing with M.O.T.H., Tsunami Funk, or as a solo act. When not on stage or behind a sound board, he enjoys teaching guitar, bass, and vocals.\n\nFavorite Pinky song: “Time”\n\nDustin Tucker – Guitar / Vocals:\n\nAlso a founding member, Dustin is the son of the late Bozeman icon Tex Tucker, and has committed to the same love of music that made his father so inspirational. His vocals are soaked in passion and it’s apparent that he’s carrying the torch. He was once told he had his eyes closed for 45 minutes straight on stage. When not on stage with Pinky, you can find Dustin releasing his own original music, spending time with family, or hanging around Music Villa where he does Graphic Design, Social Media, and Marketing… which he conveniently does for Pinky too.\n\nFavorite Pinky song: “Welcome to the Machine”\n\nJoe Kirchner – Keyboards:\n\nJoe is in charge of the synthesizer, piano, and “keytar” realm. Way back in 1988 he saw a keytar being rocked in a music video and decided it was the instrument for him. Joe began studying classical piano at 7 thanks to some stern guidance from his mother, who is also responsible for gifting him the legendary pink beehive wig. A die hard Pink Floyd fan since he was 13, the enthusiasm you see in Joe’s performances is always genuine, stating: “I always try to put myself in the shoes of the listener.” Other musical endeavours include The Knowshows, M.O.T.H., Nordberg, and Fluorescent Brown. Joe also manages an all-terrain rental company and is a PASSIONATE certified mechanic… he also enjoys long walks on the beach and playing love songs on his keytar.\n\nFavorite Pinky song: “Pigs”\n\nDrew Fleming – Drums / Samples:\n\nIt all started in the basement on his Dad’s old Ludwig kit and the Beatles on vinyl… Drew has been playing the drums for over 25 years, 15 of those have been spent gigging and recording with acts both locally and nationally. Drew’s approch to drumming is to “lay out the red carpet” to allow the other musicians to be totally comfortable, “it’s all about the groove”. Normally found behind the drum-set, Drew was excited to take on percussion and over 40 samples in Pinky. Drew also plays with Eightrack Mind, The Doors Legacy Band, 231 East Quartet, Milton Menasco, and Jason Lytle. (of Grandaddy), and more.\n\nFavorite Pinky song: “Wish You Were Here”\n\nJake Fleming – Sax / Percussion / Guitar:\n\nJake is a songwriter, performer & teacher, a graduate of MSU, and Co-founder of Hand Me Down Some Silver, Inc. (501c3). He is committed to the education of young musicians, and believes that preserving the legacy of art in any community starts and ends with the younger generation. As a saxophonist and guitarist Jake performs with several bands including JENI FLEMING where he has performed at some of the country’s top music festivals. With friend and colleague Chris Cundy, Jake created The Shed, where in addition to teaching and rehearsing bands, he has engineered a handful of critically acclaimed recording projects.\n\nFavorite Pinky song: “On The Turning Away”\n\nTyler Schultz – Organ:\n\nHailing from Chicago, Illinois, Tyler is the youngest member of Pinky, providing organ and supplemental keyboards. He made his debut with the band at the massive Music on Main concert in June of 2014, and couldn’t have imagined a better show to get him in the door. As a self-taught musician, Tyler first began playing drums in many high school bands, even including a Pink Floyd cover band, so he feels right at home with Pinky. After a few years playing percussion, he couldn’t help but play any instrument he could get his hands on, and since his move to Bozeman, MT, he has been able to take advantage of the incredible music scene and play out all that he can. Tyler has been seen in a variety of projects, playing anything from a fiddle in a fast-pickin’ bluegrass band, to piano in a jazz quartet, and there is no stopping him. Pink Floyd has been a huge influence in Tyler’s music and he feels like a ‘kid in a candy store’ to be able to play their music once again, but now with Bozeman’s finest.\n\nFavorite Pinky Song: “Comfortably Numb”\n\nKali Armstrong – Vocals:\n\nWhen Kali first saw Pinky and the Floyd perform, she made her way to the front and center of the stage, mesmerized. “That concert changed my life” and that night, she went home with a guitar pick that had been tossed to her from one of the bandmates. Music and protecting the environment are her biggest passions, and many of Pink Floyd’s songs echo with awareness and hope for a healthier planet. Driven by her own desire to make positive change through music, Kali sings anywhere she is able, and has performed everywhere from national park campgrounds to Carnegie Hall. Being part of Pinky and the Floyd’s magical, musical realm is a portal into meaningful friendships and a blossoming music career.\n\nFavorite Pinky Song: “Take It Back”\n\nKrista Barnett – Vocals:\n\nWhen Krista won a young composer’s contest in her hometown of Akron, Ohio at the age of five, she knew she was destined for a life in music and performing. She got a voice degree at Indiana University and co-founded the original band, Guest House, who extensively toured the Midwest and East coast in addition to recording three studio albums. Her Montana musical endeavors include The String Jumpers, The Tiny Band, Krista Barnett Quartet, The Tyler James Brigade, Lester Rocks, and The Dave Walker Band among other side projects and guest appearances. Krista can be heard singing on several of the “Get Lost” (in Montana) commercials. In addition to performing and teaching music, Krista is also the Upper Elementary teacher at Middle Creek Montessori School.\n\nFavorite Pinky Song: “Have a Cigar”"
