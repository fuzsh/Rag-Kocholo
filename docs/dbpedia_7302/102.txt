Pink Floyd are a British rock band that started in the year 1965 and was active until 1996, also the year in which the group was finally included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. This English band is known for their contemporary psychedelic rock style, laced with progressive rock, philosophical songwriting, acoustic experimentation, highly entertaining concerts, and interesting live shows.

The group originally had four university student members namely Roger Waters, Nick Mason, Richard Wright, and Syd Barret. They began playing in the late sixties in the music underground in London. In 1967, David Gilmour joined the group as their lead guitarist and vocals. He officially replaced Barret a year later as Barret's mental condition worsened. It was at this time when the band finally began its journey to fame and commercial success. Their best selling albums include The Dark Side of the Moon (released in 1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), The Wall (1979), Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987), and The Division Bell (1994).

Wright decided to leave the group in 1979, Waters following in 1985, but both eventually came back to continue their recordings and tours all throughout the year 1994. Despite the groupâ€™s uncertainties for the past 20 years, Pink Floyd finally reunited in 2005 as they performed in a global awareness event called Live 8. Three years later, Wright died due to cancer. In 2011, the group continued their Wall Tour performances at the O2 Arena in London.
