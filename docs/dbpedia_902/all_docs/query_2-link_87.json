        "text": "From a press release:\n\n“As part of a six month nationwide design competition, the 11th Street Bridge Park is excited to receive design concepts from four nationally recognized design teams. Landscape architects, architects and structural engineers have spent the summer envisioning Washington D.C.’s first elevated public park on the foundations of an old freeway bridge spanning the Anacostia River. The design proposals will be on exhibition and the public is invited to share feedback.\n\nInformed by hundreds of community meetings with 11th Street Bridge Park staff, four design teams were tasked with creating an iconic new civic space supporting the community’s environmental, economic, cultural and physical health. These four teams were selected by the Bridge Park’s Jury of national experts for their creativity, energy and vision from more than 80 firms who responded to an open call for submissions launched in March, 2014.\n\nThe teams are:\n\nOLIN : OMA\n\nBalmori Associates : Cooper, Robertson & Partners\n\nStoss Landscape Urbanism : Höweler + Yoon Architecture\n\nWallace Roberts & Todd (WRT) : NEXT Architects : Magnusson Klemencic Associates\n\nOver the next month, the public is invited to review the design renderings and share feedback. Participants can take a short survey that will be shared with the Competition Jury as they select the final winning design. The four design concepts will be exhibited at the following venues across the city and available online with the goal of reaching the widest possible audience:\n\nOn View From September 14 – October 11, 2014\n\nTHEARC Gallery – 1901 Mississippi Ave. SE, Washington, D.C. 20020\n\nOn View From September 24 – October 11, 2014\n\nSmithsonian Anacostia Community Museum – 1901 Fort Place SE, Washington D.C. 20020\n\nDistrict Architecture Center – 421 7th Street NW, Washington D.C. 20004\n\nThe public is invited to observe the design team presentations to the Jury on Monday, September 29 and Tuesday, September 30, 2014. Representatives from each team will describe their concepts and engage in wide-ranging discussions with the Jury at this FREE event held at theater of THEARC, located at 1901 Mississippi Ave. SE, Washington, D.C.\n\nMonday September 29th\n\n1:00 – 2:30 pm Balmori Associates / Cooper Robertson & Partners\n\n3:00 – 4:30 pm Stoss Landscape Urbanism / Höweler+Yoon Architecture\n\nTuesday, September 30th\n\n8:30 – 10:00 am Wallace Roberts Todd (WRT) / NEXT Architects\n\n10:30 am – 12:00 pm OMA / OLIN\n\nThe Bridge Park’s Jury is made up of noted experts in the fields of landscape architecture, architecture, urban design, community engagement and public health, and includes:\n\n• Howard Frumkin, M.D., Dr.P.H. Dean, School of Public Health, University of Washington\n\n• Toni L. Griffin, Founding Director of the J. Max Bond Center for the Just City, Spitzer School of Architecture, City College of New York\n\n• Carol Mayer-Reed, FASLA, Partner in Charge of Landscape Architecture and Urban Design, Mayer/Reed (Portland, OR)\n\n• Michaele Pride, AIA, NOMA, Associate Dean for Public Outreach and Engagement, School of Architecture and Planning, University of New Mexico\n\n• Harry Robinson III, FAIA, AICP, NOMA, Dean Emeritus and Professor of Urban Design, School of Architecture and Design, Howard University\n\n• Patricia Zingsheim, AIA, CPM, Associate Director of Revitalization and Design, D.C. Office of Planning (Alternate Juror)\n\n• Donald J. Stastny FAIA, FCIP, Design Competition Advisor\n\nAdditionally, a Design Oversight Committee of experts from across the region representing the arts, environmental, design, recreation and health communities are providing pivotal feedback to the Jury during the nine-month process.\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION: Visit www.bridgepark.org\n\nCompetition Fact Sheet\n\n• Stage 1 – March, 2014. Call for entries open to United States-based designers. Over eighty design firms representing forty-one teams submitted qualifications and essays describing their design methodology. Jury selected six landscape architect / architect teams to assemble larger interdisciplinary teams including structural engineers, lighting designers and other experts for in-person interviews.\n\n• Stage 2 – May, 2014. Jury selects four design teams to advance to the final stage. Each team is provided a $27,500 stipend to create full design renderings that will be juried and evaluated for cost and constructability.\n\n• Stage 3 – September 29th and 30th, 2014. Jury meets to hear team presentations and select the final concept for the 11th Street Bridge Park which will be announced at press conference scheduled for the morning of October 16, 2014.\n\nAbout the 11th Street Bridge Park\n\nAs the old 11th Street river bridges that connect Washington, D.C.’s Capitol Hill and historic Anacostia neighborhoods are being replaced, the District government and a local nonprofit organization, Building Bridges Across the River at THEARC, will transform the aged infrastructure into the city’s first elevated park: a new venue for healthy recreation, environmental education and the arts.\n\nThe 11th Street Bridge Park will be a place unlike any other in Washington, D.C. – one that supports the community’s physical, environmental, cultural and economic health. Funding for the Bridge Park is provided by a $1 million pre-capital campaign from public and private donors. The DC City Government recently committed an additional $14.5 million toward the project, representing half of the expected construction cost."
