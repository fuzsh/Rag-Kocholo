Submitted by Pat Hodge<PandDPirates61@aol.com>\n\nI have some Trivia for you. There were three brothers name David, Alvin, Elam Hodge. They were descendants of the Perrymans, were from anther prominent Creek Indian family who were landholders in the area when Tulsa was new and they also made notable contributions to the development of early Tulsa. At of allotments of the Indian's land. The Hodges and Perrymans acquired most of the land adjoining Tulsa on the South and east.\n\nBut not all of the Indians of early Tulsa who were large landowners lived out their lives in wealth and comfort. One of the Hodge Brothers ( Elam) My husband grandfather is an example of a sad fate that can change a prince into a pauper. He owned the city of Tulsa-- now buried as a pauper\" was the headline of the following article in a 1933 Tulsa Daily World,\n\n\"in a pauper's grave here which cost the county $35 lies the body of a man who could have been worth $100,000,000.\n\n\"East First Street originally was name Hodge Street name after the brother's\n\nAlvin Twitworth Hodge ( MY husbands uncle) was appointed by Principal Chief L.C. Perryman's District Inspector for the Coweta District on December 9, 1887. In 1900 Alvin served on two committees in Tulsa, Streets & Alleys, and Public Improvements. In 1903 he developed the \"Hodge Addition\" a residential area in Tulsa. During that time, he gave to the city of Tulsa. land for \"Cemetery purposes only\" which is today called Oaklawn Cemetery. In 1905 Alvin sold land to the Methodist Church for the relocation and construction of Kendall College, now know as the University of Tulsa.\n\nAlvin had a reputation of being a quiet. law-abiding citizen. He was Tulsa's first tax collector. At that time, every white man living in Indian Territory was required to pay a tax of one dollar a month for the privilege of working in the Creek Nation. There was also a monthly school tax of one dollar and fifty cents.\n\nDavid Hodge was a one of the leading citizens of the Creek Nation in the early days. He was a natural orator and had the advantage over many creek political leaders in that he also spoke English. He was a leader in the Council house at Okmulgee and represented his people many times in Washington D.C. As the consensus in Indian Territory grew stronger for statehood. David became immersed in committees and subcommittees focused on such a goal. Most had agreed that \"Sequoyah\" should be the name of the new state, and David was appointed as a delegate at Sequoyah Convention in Muskogee I.T. in 1905. In December of that year, the delegation traveled by train to Washington D.C. to present their plan before President and Congress. It had been a lengthy process just getting there the committee meetings, paperwork. The compromises and politics. David, being a Republican, was confident that President Teddy Roosevelt would approve the new proposed state of Sequoyah. The delegates submitted the plan to the President at the white house AMD was dismayed to hear him declare that he would not support the proposed state. Very Pound of my husband grandfather and his two uncles.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome More Trivia & Information found about TULSA\n\nPre-1830\n\nInscriptions on rocks at Turkey Mountain in Tulsa on the western side of the Arkansas River have been suggested by some as possible runestones and evidence of Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact to the region by Vikings or Celts. Barry Fell interpreted the Turkey Mountain rocks as Celtic Ogham. Initially Fell accepted the logical interpretation that the inscription on one stone - appearing to be the letters \"PIA\" from the modern Roman alphabet - were initials carved by a fairly modern visitor. However he claimed the inscription could be translated in Punic writing to mean \"white\" and a nearby straight line marking on another stone he translated in Ogham to \"GUIN\", also meaning white in Punic-Celtic, causing Fell to assert that it was a bilingual inscription. However, within the academic community, Fell's claims on epigraphy are almost overwhelmingly dismissed.\n\nIndian Territory: 1830-1882 What was to ultimately become Tulsa was part of Indian Territory, which was created as part of the relocation of the Five Civilized Tribes - the Choctaw, Cherokee, Muscogee (Creek), Chickasaw, and Seminole peoples. These Native American tribes moved into the region after the passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, when they were forced to surrender their lands east of the Mississippi River to the federal government in exchange for land in Indian Territory. Each of the larger tribes was given extensive land holdings, individual governments were formed, and tribal members began new lives as farmers, trappers, and ranchers. The majority of the American Indians (including the numerous Creek and Cherokee settlers) came from the Southern states. During the Civil War, they largely favored the Confederacy, in part because of institution of slavery being common within the Five Civilized Tribes. Most of modern Tulsa is located in the Creek Nation, with parts located in the Cherokee Nation and Osage Nation.\n\nThe city now known as Tulsa was first settled by the Lochapoka (Turtle Clan) Muscogee (Creek) between 1828 and 1836. Driven from their native Alabama, the Lochapokas established a new home at a site near present-day Cheyenne Avenue and 18th Street. Under a large burr oak, now called the Creek Council Oak Tree, they rekindled their ceremonial fire. The Lochapoka named their new settlement \"Tulasi,\" meaning \"old town\" in their native language. Not coincidentally, 'tulasi' is the same word from which Tallahassee, Florida takes its name. Florida is part of the original home of the Muscogee people.\n\nAn 1832 visit to the area by the famous American writer Washington Irving is described in his book A Tour on the Prairiess (1835). Irving accompanied a U.S. Army exploration party on an excursion from Ft. Gibson west onto the prairie and the lands occupied by the Osage and Pawnee tribes. In it, he relates camping in a grove of large trees on the banks of the Arkansas River a few miles south of the present day Tulsa city-limits (now in the suburb of Bixby). Washington Irving Park sits near the location.\n\nIn 1846, Lewis Perryman built a log cabin trading post near what is now 33rd Street and South Rockford Avenue. Perryman, who was part Creek, established a business foothold in the rugged frontier until the Civil War. The reconstruction period after the war contributed to the growth of the area; in 1879 the first post office opened, followed by the arrival of the railroad. By this time the area was known as 'Tulsey Town' and had grown to be a trading post and cattle town.\n\nRailroads: 1882-1901\n\nBy August 1882 the population of Tulsa had reached 200 and in August of that year, the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway, later known as the Frisco, completed the extension of its line to Tulsa to serve the cattle business, the city's first industry.\n\nThe Hall brothers, James M. and Harry C., chose the point at which the railroad stopped. James M. Hall, who would later be referred to as the 'Father of Tulsa,' marked off Tulsa's first street, built its first permanent store, organized its first church, school, and government, and served as Tulsa's first interim Postmaster. The town was now referred to as 'Tulsey Town.'\n\nThroughout the 19th century, the Native American tribes were made to accept a number of treaties that further reduced the size of their lands and introduced new tribes into Indian Territory. White settlers continued to push forward, and in 1892 the land was officially opened and all tribal members were forced to accept individual allocations of land. By 1898, the city had a population of 1,100.\n\nOil boom: 1901-1907\n\nTulsa changed from a small frontier town to a boomtown with the discovery of oil in 1901 at Red Fork, a small community southwest of Tulsa. Wildcatters and investors flooded into the city and the town began to take shape. Neighborhoods were established in Tulsa on the north side of the Arkansas River, away from the drilling sites, and began to spread out from downtown Tulsa in all directions. In 1904, Tulsans constructed a bridge across the river, allowing oil field workers, supplies, food and equipmenp to cross the river, reaffirming Tulsa's position as the center of the oil field.\n\nIn 1905, the Glenn Pool oil field was discovered. This strike created such a large supply of crude oil that it forced Tulsans to develop storage tanks for the excess oil and gas and, later, pipelines. It also laid the foundation for Tulsa to become a leader in many businesses related to oil and gas, in addition to being the physical center of the growing petroleum industry. Eventually, Glenn Pool established Oklahoma as one of the leading petroleum producing regions in the United States. Many early oil companies chose Tulsa for their home base.\n\nStatehood: 1907-1915\n\nBy the time Oklahoma achieved statehood in 1907, Tulsa had a population of 7,298.\n\nSecond oil boom: 1915-1930\n\nBy 1920 the population boomed to 72,000. Many of these new residents came from Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York. The second surge of oil discoveries occurred between 1915 and 1930, and firmly established Tulsa as the \"Oil Capital of the World.\" Wealthy oilmen such as Waite Phillips, William Skelly and J. Paul Getty built stately mansions and beautiful modern headquarters. The prevalence of the Art Deco style of architecture during this period resulted in a treasure trove of beautiful structures. Cultural institutions such as a Symphony and professional Ballet and Opera Companies were founded, as well as Theatre Tulsa, the oldest surviving community theatre west of the Mississippi River. In 1932 Waite Phillips donated his exquisite Italianate mansion \"Philbrook\" to the city of Tulsa for use as an art museum.\n\nAnother community that flourished in Tulsa during the early oil booms was Greenwood. It was the largest and wealthiest of Oklahoma's African American communities and was known nationally as \"Black Wall Street\". The neighborhood was a hotbed of jazz and blues in the 1920s. The scene in Greenwood was so hot that story has it that in 1927 while on tour, Count Basie heard a dance band in a club in Greenwood and decided to focus on jazz.\n\nRace riot: 1921\n\nIn 1921, the Tulsa Race Riot occurred. Known as the 1921 Race Riot, the Tulsa Race War, or the Greenwood Riot, The Tulsa Race Riot was one of the nation's worst acts of racial violence and large-scale civil disorder. From May 31 to June 1, 1921 during 16 hours of rioting, 39 people were officially reported killed, over 800 people were admitted to local hospitals with injuries, an estimated 10,000 were left homeless, 35 city blocks composed of 1,256 residences were destroyed by fire, and $1.8 million (nearly $17 million after adjustment for inflation) in property damage. Confined mainly to the segregated Greenwood neighborhood of Tulsa, the riot was responsible for wiping out nearly all of the prosperity and success that Black Wall Street had achieved.\n\n\"America's Most Beautiful City\": Mid-20th Century\n\nFor the majority of Tulsan's, the mid 20th Century proved a time of continuing prosperity. The wealth generated by the early oil industry also helped Tulsa become a leader in the aviation industry. During WWII Spartan Aviation was a training site for hundreds of allied pilots. In 1942 Douglas Aircraft built its mile-long Air Force Plant No. 3 to build bombers. Following the war, Tulsa become an important maintenance center for American Airlines and numerous other aviation related businesses developed alongside.\n\nA master plan for the city that resulted in the creation of numerous parks, along with such attractions as its oil mansions, beautiful churches, museums and rose gardens, led to Tulsa being dubbed \"America's Most Beautiful City\" in the 1950's.\n\nOil bust and recovery: 1982-Present\n\nFollowing the \"Oil Bust\" of 1982-84 the title of \"Oil Capital of the World\" was relinquished to Houston. City leaders worked to diversify the city away from a largely petroleum-based economy, bringing blue collar factory jobs as well as Internet and telecommunications firms to Tulsa during the 1990s, and enhancing the already important aviation industry. During this time, customer-service and reservations call centers became an important part of the local economy. Showing that petroleum is still an important player, an abundant supply of natural gas also helped with recovery.\n\nThe early 21st century saw Tulsa's economy, along with the national economy, facing another economic down-turn and a loss of jobs. However, recovery was reported beginning as early as 2004 and by 2006 the total number of jobs in Tulsa had increased to levels exceeding those prior to the downturn. Helped by relatively low housing prices, Tulsa continued to be an attractive market for business expansion.\n\nEfforts by city leaders led to the passage of the \"Vision 2025\" program in 2003 with the purpose of enhancing and revitalizing Tulsa's infrastructure. The keystone project of Vision 2025 was the construction of the BOK Center in downtown Tulsa. The multi-purpose arena, designed by famed architect Cesar Pelli, is intended to be a home for the city's minor league hockey and arena football teams, as well as a venue for major concerts and conventions. Goundbreaking on the structure occurred in 2005 and completion is expected in 2008. Much recent attention has been paid to ideas for \"destination development\" along the banks of the Arkansas River.\n\nMany key families and people played important roles in the history of Tulsa including the Perryman Family, the Phillips family (Frank Phillips, who founded Phillips Petroleum Company, and his brother Waite Phillips), J. Paul Getty, William G. Skelly, the Warren family, the Murphy family, the LaFortune Family, the Gardner family, the Bartlett family, Thomas Gilcrease, and Charles Page.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom: Fore, David Date: 10/31/2007 11:55:55 AM\n\nYes, the theater at 11th & Sandusky was the Will Rogers. How about the one at 15th and Lewis, one of the last truly in Theater style? Oh, and the drive-in at Apache and Harvard was called, appropriately enough, the Apache Drive-in. Admiral Twin is still standing, and functional, but really looking ratty. All the drive-ins used to have a 'kiddy' place with swings, slides, etc. to keep the kids occupied before the show. How about the in-car heaters (propane) that hung in the window of the car? You rented them at the concession stand, they lit it with a blow torch, then you tried to find where it wouldn't roast the people on one side of the car, while the others froze. (Admiral Twin, only one open in winter, I think). There was also a drive-in at 11th and Mingo as late as the 60's, but I have forgotten the name.\n\nMainly grew up on the East side, Sheridan Village at Admiral and Sheridan, was a busy shopping center. Eastgate at Admiral and Memorial was really modern (I knew the man who built the neon sign with the big neon gates for the center). Whittier Square at Admiral and Delaware was a small, but neat shopping area. The best times were the bus ride downtown with Mom to a real living downtown, with stores, theaters, Bishops Resturaunt, little cafes here and there. Or going down to catch an actual passenger train to OKC, steam engine, WOW! Mom and Dad, before I came along, used to walk from central Tulsa to Sand Springs on Sunday, then splurge and ride the trolley back. That was their entertainment.\n\nThe original Pennington's at Admiral and Harvard was always busy, so was Cotton's at Admiral and \"the traffic circle\", but it was for the 'rebel' crowd mainly. Just East of Pennington's there was still a small brick gas station, with two pumps, and a glass topped hand operated pump for \"White Gas\" (Kerosene). Instead of a hydraulic rack, it had a concrete pit on the side of the building, with a ramp you pulled your car up on, the mechanic walked down into the pit to work (unless it had rained hard!).\n\nThere were Mom & Pop stores in every neighborhood, our big 'commercial' area at Yale and Pine consisted of a small grocery store on one corner, and a gas station on the other side of Yale. One block South on Yale was a drug store, with a small soda fountain where you could still get Coke like it should be! And if your register receipt had a red star on it, your drink was free the next time. There was still a Feed Store, with three story grainery, wooden docks, by the railroad track at Dawson and Pine. The meat packing house just North of there was 'fragrant' when the wind was from the North! Right in the middle of all this was a large 'coal strip pit' that was out of service, but had left behind huge hills of rubble, and deep pits with green water.\n\nOut at the airport, Tulsa only, not International, at Apache and Sheridan, the terminal was a neat Art Deco building. The planes pulled up to the terminal, and you walked down the steps of the plane onto the tarmac. There was also the Spartan Cafeteria across the street, a really busy place on Sunday when the special was roast beef. Must have been a hangar at one point, huge with high ceilings and windows.\n\nOut at 11th and Yale was the Golden Drumstick. Beat KFC all to pieces. Great onion rings. At Admiral and Memorial, on the NE corner, there used to be a drive-in Steak House. Could enjoy your steak and fixings in your car. Don't think it did too well. Crossing over Admiral just East of Memorial, there was a pipeline of some sort, supported on trestles that spanned Admiral. Really high, now the hill is even gone, or most of it. Real Ice House about half way between Memorial and Mingo, wooden dock where you pulled up with your car. They would drag a block of ice out onto the dock, and chip off what you needed. Crushed? Well, they would chip it to smaller pieces for your Coleman Cooler, or, like my Dad, bring your own ice pick.\n\nMohawk Park was still a nice, and safe, place to go for picnics, or to the Zoo which consisted of two rows of cages. Big cats on one side, monkeys and birds on the other. Good fishing in some of the creeks, and a lot of fishers (and boats) on the Reservoir Lake. (Please don't 'whizz' in the water, no swimming, Tulsa drinks from this!) There was a pretty good sized amusement park on the hill above Mohawk Drive and Harvard, and a roller skating rink across the street from the reservoir. Speaking of amusement parks, also used to be one way out in Jenks, actually SE of Jenks, with a lake (where you could swim) and a roller coaster that followed the hills for a long run around the park.\n\nAdmiral was a 4-lane, modern street .out to Sheridan, then it went to two lane. But it did have the \"Traffic Circle\" at Mingo, an adaptation of european ideas for traffic control that never went over well with Okies. But it was the landmark for the area go to the traffic circle, go North 2 miles and you were at McDonald-Douglas, one of the big employers in Tulsa. The truss bridge over the Arkansas at Sand Springs was long, and for most intents and purposes, one lane .especially if a truck was in the oncoming lane! And the \"Bee-Line\" (Hwy 75) to Okmulgee didn't start to be a highway, two-lane at that, until you were South of 71st St. Hwy 75 to Bartlesville was modern up to 86th St North or so, when you had to jog over a half mile, and head North on a narrow two lane. 11th street (Hwy 66) was THE street, lined with nicer motels,many with Art Deco fixtures, businesses and resturaunts from about Sheridan into downtown. You had to zig and zag through downtown to pick up 3rd St (Charles Page Blvd) if you wanted to drive to Sand Springs. Or cross the river at 11th St. over the concrete bridge to head for OKC. Big ice plant on the North end of the bridge then, refineries on both sides of the South end. Driving to Broken Arrow was what felt like an all-day trip on country roads.\n\nSchool, for me, started at Owen Elementary, a 'new' modern 'ranch style' instituion. Then Ross Elementary, when it was still in an old two story brick building just North of Admiral and Memorial. The City condemned the school for structure failure (big cracks you could see through, some say due to low flying military jets going to McDonald-Douglas) and we moved down the hill into pre-fabs, just a half mile walk from home. For Junior High School it was Alexander Graham Bell behind the Sheridan shopping center (nice 1-1/2 mile walk, unless it rained). Finally a brand new High School, Nathan Hale on 21st between Sheridan and Memorial. First time for school bus travel for me, until I got a car. Had my heart set on East Central High School, then at Admiral and Garnett, but the school district had other ideas.\n\nThen I-244 wiped out most of anything of interest along Admiral, and it has never really recovered.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSubmitted by: Harrison Thomas LaTour\n\nBOK Financial Corporation traces its history back 98 years.
