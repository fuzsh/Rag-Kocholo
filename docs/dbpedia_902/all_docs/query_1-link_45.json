        "text": "\"Why should we focus on playing catch-up to other cities when we should focus on leapfrogging other cities?\" said John-Kelly Warren, a member of Tulsa Stakeholders. \"Today will mark the start of Tulsa's tomorrow.\"\n\nWarren said \"The Channels” is needed to attract and retain young professionals to move the city in the right direction.\n\nThe group is asking for private donations of $100 million and said energy sources from the project's hydrodam and other renewable energies would create an additional $88 million.\n\nWarren said a tax increase is not unthinkable, but the group will work to keep the bill away from residents. Residents could be asked to vote on the proposal and it could open within four years of approval.\n\nA dam at the 23rd Street bridge will create a lake extending to Sand Springs. A manmade island proposed between the 11th and 23rd street bridges featuring low- and high-rise residences would be connected by bridges to the east bank.\n\nThe units, mostly apartments, will house about 3,000 residents.\n\nA stone-paved plaza will sit at the heart of the island. The plaza is lined in trees with hopes for cafes and pubs.\n\nThere also will be a floating stage for performances.\n\nThe plaza will be shaded by a canopy. The solar-paneled covered canopy will collect sunshine for power conversion, while cooling by up to 13 degrees the open market.\n\nAlso planned is a beach, pool and a marina.\n\n\"It's time to get back to being Tulsans,” Warren said to applause. \"This plan is achievable. It's now up to greater Tulsa to embrace.”\n\nNot all of the 500 people at the Doubletree Hotel embraced the proposal.\n\nDan Weber, a 19-year-old University of Tulsa student, expressed concern about the river's health with such massive development.\n\n\"This is a pile of concrete in the middle of the river,” he said.\n\nDanielle Matheny, a 19-year-old TU student, called the project \"ridiculous.\n\n\"Making a small little oasis in a big sprawling dead city is not going to make people want to live here anymore than they want to now,” she said.\n\nClaire McGowan, 27 of Tulsa, said she agrees with the group's spirit but thinks energy should be spent on developing downtown and other areas where infrastructure is already present.\n\n\"I think it's a waste of money,” she said. \"Why can't we build on what we already have.”\n\nWarren encouraged those with concerns to contact the group so they can take them under advisement. He said The Channels is not meant to compete with Bricktown in Oklahoma City but to energize the entire state.\n\nChristine Lambert, a stakeholder, said it's time Tulsans get back to the innovative thinking that once made the city the world's oil capitol.\n\n\"It is time to awaken the sleeping giant,” she said. \"Help Tulsa get its swagger back.\"\n\nStakeholder Tom Cooper said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has already looked at the proposal. He said dozens of state and federal permits may be needed.\n\nThe project won't cause flooding, he said.\n\n\"We are in a global battle of cities,” he said. \"The city with the best vision wins.”"
