        "text": "Delon Hampton & Associates (DHA), as subconsultant, is providing civil and structural engineering support for the 11th Street Bridge Park project. The project goal is to erect a public gathering space atop existing piers that held up the old 11th Street Bridge over the Anacostia River in Washington, DC. The elevated park structure will parallel the new 11th Street local Bridge and feature a 1,200 foot-long, pedestrian-only expanse that will connect two city neighborhoods.\n\nâ\n\nDHAâs civil engineering support will establish a horizontal and vertical alignment for the east and west approaches; develop a composite existing condition base map; coordinate utilities with the proposed design; design stormwater management; and assist in developing a concept level cost estimate. DHA's structural engineering support will be limited to the east and west abutment and all retaining walls."
