        "text": "(This is a reposting of a piece that was published long ago, losing its images along the way)\n\nOver the last few weeks, I have written of a number of bridges that cross the Anacostia River. Today, we will look at the bridge that crossed at 11th Street from 1908 until the 1960s.\n\nAlmost 30 years after the previous 11th Street bridge had been built, it was (according to the Washington Post) “in the class of that ‘which have seen better days.’” This set off the request for an appropriation from Congress to complete this. 1903, however, came to an end without action, and thus, in January of 1904, Engineer Commissioner John Biddle made a “personal inspection” of the old bridge. This, finally, loosened an appropriation for a new bridge.\n\nAfter some discussion, it was determined that the new structure would be built about 150 feet north of the old one, which meant that a whole new set of contracts had to be drawn up to pay off the owners of the land needed. In the meantime, repairs were made to the old bridge. This meant that in late 1904, there was an accident that could have ended tragically. A carpenter was crossing the bridge on horseback when they both fell through a hole that had been left by men repairing the bridge. Edgar Arnold, the carpenter, managed to grab onto an iron bar and kept himself from falling into the river. His horse was not as lucky, though it survived the fall, and managed to swim to shore, where it stuck in the mud. Fortunately, a passing tugboat saw the horse, and dropped a hawser around its neck, and so was able to free the horse from the mud, and rescue it from the river."
