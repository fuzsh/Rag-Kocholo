As the committee’s work continues, lawmakers should examine a previous public-private effort (“Oklahoma Futures”) and learn why it failed to live up to expectations and was later repealed. [Steve Lewis / OK Policy]\n\nOklahoma News\n\nOklahoma Legislature reaches deal on school funding, teacher pay and tax credits: Negotiations on public school funding and private education tax credits that have consumed the Oklahoma Legislature for months have finally ended in a deal. Lawmakers agreed to pour $625 million into public education. The package funnels an extra $500 million into the education funding formula, the state’s chief driver of public school support, and $125 million for Redbud grants, which aid school facilities.

House Bill 2259 aims to address the financial struggles faced by many individuals who are forced to choose between basic necessities and paying court-related expenses. The legislation is part of a broader effort by advocates to reform the state’s criminal justice system and reduce the number of individuals incarcerated for nonpayment of fines, Katie Arata reports for FOX 25. [Crime Report]\n\nBill looking to reduce criminal court fines, fees, & incarceration rates heads to Governor [KTUL]\n\nGovernor gets $218.6 million incentive package for solar panel manufacturing facility bid: The Oklahoma House and Senate passed and sent to the governor on Monday a three-piece, $218.6 million incentive package believed to be for a solar panel manufacturing facility at the Tulsa Port of Inola. Also sent to the governor was a $10.8 million supplemental appropriation to continue work on a new veterans home at Sallisaw. [Tulsa World]\n\nTransgender Oklahomans speak out against new law: ‘Only the beginning’: Transgender Oklahomans and their allies visited the state Capitol on Monday to find a sense of community and share their feelings after Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a ban on gender-affirming care for minors. Because public testimony is not allowed in legislative hearings, two LGBTQ-rights groups held a “People’s Hearing” to give a voice to residents who had limited opportunities to speak out against the new law as it advanced through the Oklahoma Legislature. [Tulsa World]\n\nColumn: ‘Choice and competition’ threaten state’s low-cost energy relied upon by Oklahomans: Even as the current legislative session winds down, a small interest group continues to misinform Oklahomans, lobbying for deregulating the retail energy market. As a former chair of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, I was charged with regulating utility providers, and I implore our state leaders to critically review such misleading proposals for “choice and competition,” which inherently threaten the state’s low-cost energy relied upon by Oklahoma families and businesses alike.

She expected to do the same when hired at Dr. Eddie Warrior Correctional Facility, a women’s minimum security prison in Taft, Oklahoma. Instead, she was thrown into the middle of what she alleges were sexual assault coverups. [Oklahoma Watch]\n\nCommissioner: New jail to be ‘night and day’ improvement from current jail’s problems: Brian Maughan, District 2 commissioner for Oklahoma County, had a message Monday for those seeking answers to the mounting deaths at the Oklahoma County jail. [The Oklahoman]\n\nOpinion: Facts matter. The Glossip case shows us why: Finality is an important principle in our criminal justice system. Elevating finality above all else, though, can prove dangerous and undermine justice in rare cases ― cases like Richard Glossip’s, where it is revealed years later that evidence was withheld by the state. [Andrew M. Coats Guest Column / The Oklahoman]\n\nEconomy & Business News\n\nStudy ranks Oklahoma region worst for employee benefits: A new study on employee benefits suggests that businesses in Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas may have some catching up to do if they want to be as attractive to potential employees as counterparts in other parts of the country.

According to recent reporting by the Fed’s regional bank headquarters in Kansas City, despite the slowdown, driven in part by a softening of activity in the energy sector, labor markets remained tight overall. The district’s unemployment rate through the quarter hovered at about 2.8%, as compared to a 3.5% rate reported nationwide during the period. [Journal Record]\n\nOklahoma pipeline company ONEOK will acquire Magellan Midstream Partners in $18.8 billion deal: Two major energy infrastructure companies in Tulsa are about to become one.

Carri Hicks, D-OKC, on private school tax vouchers that have been tied to investments in schools and teachers in spite of concerns about transparency, misuse of taxpayer funds and administration of the program.

One state to study is Wisconsin, the first state to pass modern taxpayer-supported subsidies for private and religious schools. One of the startling consequences of privatizing education that sometimes gets lost: Local property taxpayers in Wisconsin have essentially made up a $211.5 million loss of state funding by raising property taxes to keep their public schools operating.
