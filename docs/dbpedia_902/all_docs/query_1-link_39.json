A big part of that is simply taking care of the things we already own: our streets, the emergency vehicles our first responders use to keep us safe, the parks our kids play in, and more. We have a plan for that.\n\nOn August 8, we will vote on Improve Our Tulsa, a capital improvements package. It will provide $814 million for much-needed improvements to streets, bridges, public safety equipment, parks, ADA improvements, resources to reduce homelessness and more – all without increasing our tax rate.\n\nPlease vote yes on all four propositions on August 8."
