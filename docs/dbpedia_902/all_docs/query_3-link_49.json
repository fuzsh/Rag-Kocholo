        "text": "Featuring plenty of space for healthy recreation, environmental education and arts, this infrastructure project aims to utilize abandoned infrastructure to create a pedestrian link between the east and west Anacostia River with a series of programmed spaces, landscapes and active zones.\n\nBound by the Washington Navy Yard on one side and the National Park Service’s Anacostia Park on the other, this Bridge Park serves as a destination for some, a pedestrian or bicycle route for others and an iconic architectural symbol across the Anacostia River for the city.\n\nThe park comprises of a multipurpose performance space that can be used as required varying from theatre to concerts and from weekend lunch spot to a catalyst for bringing people together. The park also features an environmental education center, where school children can learn about the region’s river systems and the flora and fauna.\n\nThe Bridge Park serves as a platform for public art varying from temporary to permanent artworks. It also offers interactive art to showcase the rich history of the river, region and residents.\n\nThe park also includes cafés, restaurants and support facilities such as restrooms, drinking water, storage and maintenance.\n\nSETTY in association with Delon Hampton & Associates provided MEP/FP engineering design and construction administration for this one-of-a kind infrastructure project."
