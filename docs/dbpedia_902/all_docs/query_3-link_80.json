        "text": "The other day, I was interviewed by a graduate student about this project, which aims to create the 11th Street Bridge Park, somewhat modeled after the High Line, and similar projects, connecting both sides of the Anacostia River, to Capitol Hill and Historic Anacostia.\n\n-- \"A Look At The Final Designs For DC's 11th Street Bridge Park,\" 2024\n\nI was involved in the Design Oversight Committee on this project in 2014. But even before that I went back and forth on it.\n\nWas it merely DC trying to copy other unusual creative infrastructure endeavors (at the same time there was an attempt to create a similar bridge in London, under then Mayor Boris Johnson, \"An absurd vanity project for our age – Boris Johnson’s garden bridge,\" Guardian).\n\nI'd say yes. And lots of times when people try to do this, they don't understand why the original project was successful and subsequently they fail. A good example is Bilbao.\n\n-- \"Why can't the \"Bilbao Effect\" be reproduced? | Bilbao as an example of Transformational Projects Action Planning,\" 2017\n\nBut I have to say that the student \"inspired me\" to rethink of the bridge park as an opportunity to reshape revitalization planning and practice in Anacostia. I wrote a bunch of articles at the time about such opportunities.\n\n-- \"DC's 11th Street Bridge Park project,\" 2022\n\n-- \"The Anacostia River and considering the bridges as a unit and as a premier element of public art and civic architecture,\" 2014\n\n-- \"DC has a big \"Garden Festival\" opportunity in the Anacostia River,\" 2014\n\n-- \"A world class water/environmental education center at Poplar Point as another opportunity for Anacostia River programming (+ move the Anacostia Community Museum next door),\" 2014\n\n-- \"Saving the South Capitol Bridge as an exclusive pedestrian and and bicycle bridge,\" 2014\n\n-- \"Wanted: A comprehensive plan for the \"Anacostia River East\" corridor,\" 2012\n\nBut after the design selection process was over, I was no longer involved\n\n-- \"11th Street Bridge Park finalists,\" 2014\n\nBut DC is so weak when it comes to creative planning that such opportunities--it's been 10 years!--I forgot the opportunity and just became negative, failing to realize that much of my writing is about seizing opportunity and trying to maximize the greatest potential benefit from even half-baked infrastructure initiatives.\n\nLike the point that I make in transit writings, that new infrastructure should be leveraged to drive complementary simultaneous improvements across the transit network, the same goes for the Bridge Park.\n\n-- \"Revisiting the Purple Line article series after one year: Part 1 | a couple of baby steps,\" 2018\n\n-- \"Using the Silver Line as the priming event, what would a transit network improvement program look like for NoVA?,\" 2017\n\nHow to seize the opportunity despite the city's planning ineptitude\n\nThis mostly focuses on \"East of the River\" opportunities, with a touch at the end on \"West of the River\" opportunities centered on the RFK campus\n\nDisconnected and uncongenial location. For me, the biggest problem with the bridge concept is it isn't centrally and integrated locationally.\n\nSure it will cross the river, but it will be far from Capitol Hill, and from Anacostia. People will have to make a special trip to get there, and it won't be convenient. No parking.\n\nThat's what people don't get about the High Line. (I need to write out a typology, including other efforts like Promenade Plantee, Bentway, 606 Trail in Chicago, Indianapolis Cultural Trail, etc.)\n\nPlus I'm not sure the design is all that friendly, welcoming, congenial. Pretty post modern. Much different from Promenade Plantée, High Line, Brooklyn Bridge Park, Millennium Park, etc.\n\nThe High Line is embedded in an already successful neighborhood, and even though it is seemingly disconnected from the urban fabric in reality it abuts it very closely in ways that promote new building construction and business development (\"The High Line's transformative real estate boom, mapped\" Curbed NY, THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE PRESERVATION AND ADAPTIVE REUSE OF RAIL TRACKS, THE HIGH LINE IN NEW YORK CITY: REGIONAL IMPACT ANALYSIS AND PROPERTY VALUE CHANGE ANALYSIS Cornell thesis).\n\nSo it's generated billions in new development (\"The High Line effect: Placemaking as an economic development engine,\" Building Design and Construction) in a manner that can't happen with the Bridge Park, which is bracketed by the walled off Washington Navy Yard, excepting the riverfront trail alongside and a freeway bridge.\n\nFreeways generate lots of particulate matter that is unhealthy (\"Highway Air Pollution and Your Health: Six Things You Need To Know,\" American Lung Association) and they are f* noisy (\"Residential Exposure to Traffic Noise and Health-Related Quality of Life—A Population-Based Study\"). Who wants to hang out by a freeway?\n\nEquitable development plan. A big concern about the park concept is that it will spur displacement and gentrification.\n\nWhile I am hugely in favor of inward investment of all types (\"Yes, public and nonprofit investments in the city spur further reinvestment and change: is this a bad thing or a complicated thing?,\" 2019, \"Rethinking community planning around maintaining neighborhood civic assets and anchors,\" 2011), this is an issue, except for poor placement of the facility makes living by the bridge not so attractive.\n\nThe student asked me about the equitable development plan, which I wasn't involved in developing\n\nIt has a bunch of points. First is workforce development. I talked about this during the design process, and now that I am on the board of a park, I am proved right. There just aren't that many jobs. And my park is 110.5 acres.\n\nThe third is preserving housing. Good goal. Should have been addressed for decades. Plus the real problem in Anacostia is a broken micro-economy. They need a lot more residents (in multiunit buildings) to support revitalization of the local business district. To its credit the Bridge Park has helped develop a land trust, but I don't see it doing that much (\"Scattered site buying of houses in high cost neighborhoods doesn't seem to be a good way to develop scale for a community land trust,\" 2023).\n\n-- Douglass Community Land Trust\n\n-- \"Will ‘all that glitters’ turn L.A.’s last solidly Black city white?,\" Los Angeles Times\n\n-- \"Puerto Rico Town, Other Chicago Cultural Districts Can Get Millions For Preservation Efforts: Organizations from Rogers Park to South Chicago and Humboldt Park now can apply for $3 million in state funds to protect cultural communities,\" Block Club Chicago\n\nThe fourth is using the bridge to leverage arts and culture. YES!!!!!! A lot more about that below.\n\nEconomic multiplier effect: there won't be much. The second element of the plan is promoting business development on the bridge through kiosks and popups, and entrepreneurship development in the adjoining Anacostia commercial district, which by the way has had a Main Street commercial district revitalization program for 20 years. I laughed.\n\nOf course, I would recommend a commercial district revitalization framework plan, and all kinds of initiatives. Even my old plan for Cambridge, Maryland is relevant as it's a river community too.\n\nThe reality is that \"local parks\" as opposed to botanical gardens and arboreta and destination parks like National and State Parks don't have a big economic effect. \"Garden tourism\" is different.\n\nBut here there won't be a charge to enter the park.\n\nAnd if there is a lot of kid visitation, well kids don't spend money. They often bring their own food, etc. (The Economic Impact of Local Parks: An Examination of the Economic Impacts of Operations and Capital Spending on the United States Economy, National Recreation and Parks Association). Mostly the economic benefit from local parks comes in neighborhood stabilization and property value increases.\n\nThere are parks with food service and concessionaires, restaurants, but they aren't huge money makers. The chain Shake Shack started as a kiosk in Madison Square Park in Manhattan, but it's an outlier (\"The Story Behind Shake Shack's Success - Investopedia,\" Investopedia).\n\nShake Shack began as a small hot dog stand operating out of Madison Square Park in New York City in 2001 and grew into a gourmet fast-casual restaurant with more than 377 locations both domestically and internationally.\n\nAlthough maybe Marriott would be willing to license a revival of Hot Shoppes as a retro business venture.\n\nNational Park Service visitor economic impact studies. An important distinction they make is between in region and out of region visitation. (This extends to other public lands.)\n\nOut of region visitors spend on lodging, food, and transportation. But spending by in-region visitors, spending per party--not per person--is $42 per day. That's not a lot of money.\n\nThe paper \"Evaluating the economics of park-tourism from the ground-up: Leakage, multiplier effects, and the enabling environment at South Luangwa National Park, Zambia\" Ecological Economics, 2021, argues that simple surveys can collect this type of information. But again, the effect of visitors on parks that are destinations is completely different.\n\nAmericans for the Arts economic impact analyses of arts patrons (\"Americans for the Arts releases new findings about the arts’ impact on U.S. economy\" Broadway News)./\n\nNationwide, attendees spent an average of $38.46 at arts and culture organizations; attendees at institutions specifically serving a community of color spent an average of $38.29. This shows that spending by locals is nearly identical across the board.\n\nIn short, there will be some spending generated but not all that much. And now that I think about it I don't think we were ever presented with visitor projections.\n\nLeveraging the Bridge Park to create a new revitalization agenda for Anacostia\n\nOnce again, the integrated public realm framework (David Barth, AECOM) is relevant to the concept of investing in a network of civic assets.\n\nMobility improvements\n\nFirst, address the crappy location:Urban design and transit connections. One of the elements in the equitable development plan is better connections between the two sides of the river and the physical location of the Bridge Park.\n\nDuring the design process we did discuss better transit connections. But I guess they've been too busy over the past 10 years to do anything.\n\nAs mentioned the site will be hard to get to. It's more than a mile from either the Anacostia or Eastern Market transit stations."
