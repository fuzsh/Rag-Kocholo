        "text": "In 2009, we began work on this project and prepared a feasibility study, retrofit strategy report, and type selection report prior to proceeding with the final design. We designed a shorter highly skewed structure in combination with retaining walls and embankment fill at the approaches to span the Union Pacific Railroad mainline tracks.\n\nLocated approximately one-half-mile east from Tracy High School, the new 11th Street Bridge features a 291-foot-long highly skewed structure, including mechanically stabilized earth retaining walls and embankment fill at the approaches. The superstructure of the replacement bridge consists of a cast-in-place, post-tensioned concrete box girder. The girders are skewed relative to the centerline of the roadway such that the actual span length of the girders is approximately 200 feet.\n\nThe unique skewed bridge girder configuration allowed the superstructure depth to be minimized so that the amount that the residential driveways and adjacent roadway intersections needed to be raised up also could be minimized. The triangular shaped overlook areas that resulted from skewing the bridge girders not only provide aesthetic benefits, but also accommodate a planned aerial intersection for a future extension of MacArthur Drive shown in the cityâ€™s general plan without needing to widen the 11th Street Bridge over the railroad tracks. An onsite detour utilizing a prefabricated steel truss bridge was used to minimize the overall construction schedule and reduce safety concerns associated with trying to construct the replacement bridge adjacent to live traffic. The project stimulates sustainable growth and development on the east side of the tracks as it promotes the use of alternative modes of transportation to access downtown Tracy."
