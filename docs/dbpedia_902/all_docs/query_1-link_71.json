        "text": "One of the most challenging issues to navigate during my time as mayor has been that of reparations for the victims of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre and their families. In 1921, our fellow Tulsans were murdered, their homes and businesses torched, their bodies buried in unmarked graves so their loved ones couldn’t find them - and to this day no one has ever been held to account for it. To call this an outrage does not do it justice. At the same time, there is disagreement about the role of the city in that tragedy. The vast majority of this generation of Tulsans wasn’t even alive when it happened. And our city would be so much better today if it had been the home of Black Wall Street for the last century - we have not benefited from the Massacre. I know my fellow Tulsans want to do what we can for the families of victims - not as a punishment, but because the most fundamental part of our city’s DNA is that we help each other in hard times. This is what has made the issue of reparations so difficult. The preconceived notions around that one word - reparations - have prevented us from doing what I am confident most Tulsans would agree we should do. So when the term “reparations” is used, we jump to the end of the conversation without hearing our neighbors out. If you’re for reparations, people opposed think you’re just looking for a handout. And if you’re opposed to reparations, people in favor of them think you’re heartless. And when that disagreement occurs and tempers flare, we retreat back to those who feel like we do and think the worst of those who don’t. We will never advance as a city if we stop there. In my experience, progress only occurs when we are willing to come back together after we’ve had those disagreements and keep the conversation going. Only through that dialogue can we be reminded of the humanity in those who think differently and try to find common ground. Today, we are announcing the establishment of a commission to develop a plan for reparations in Tulsa. I will establish the Beyond Apology Commission by executive order and we will work together to identify commissioners who will advance this work. If you are interested in serving on the Beyond Apology Commission, you can find more information at https://lnkd.in/ghY_NtJR. Applications will be open through the month of August. My heartfelt request of my fellow Tulsans is that before you make any assumptions about this issue, let your fellow Tulsans on the Commission do their work and hear what they have to propose. Keep an open mind. I know there is more that unites Tulsans than divides us, and as a city of faith I believe our greatest trait is compassion for one another. My hope is that we will allow that compassion, reason, and dialogue to help heal a hurt that has plagued our city for over a century."
