        "text": "About the Project\n\nThe City is demolishing the viaduct portion of the East 11th Street Bridge from the west side of Stewart Street to the landing east of Milwaukee Way. As part of the project, a catchment device will be installed above the tribal boat launch.\n\nThe structure is approximately 2,080 feet long and consists of 63 individual spans. The project was declared an emergency by the City of Tacoma in February 2022. The City began receiving notification of debris falling from the underside of the structure to areas below. Almost all of the areas below the structure are utilized by the Port terminal operator, SSA Marine.\n\nWhat Has Been Done and Next Steps\n\nThe landing section to the west side of Milwaukee Way has been removed. Work began on March 30 and was completed on April 22, 2022.\n\nThe short term parking area (from the west side of Milwaukee Way to the east end of the long term vessel operator parking) began on April 27 and was completed on May 6, 2022.\n\nThe remaining section of bridge over the long term parking will begin on May 11, and is anticipated to be completed on May 20.\n\nThe last section from long term parking to the west side of Stewart Road is anticipated to begin in late May and be completed mid-June.\n\nThe catchment over the tribal boat launch will begin once permit exemptions are received.\n\nScope and Schedule\n\nThis project will only remove the viaduct portion of the 11th Street Bridge. The truss over the Puyallup River will remain in place until the City appropriates funding for its removal or the new corridor is installed. There is no anticipated funding in place for either option at this time.\n\nProject Updates\n\nSee infographics of work in progress.\n\nProject Funding\n\nFunding Source\n\nAmount\n\nCity of Tacoma\n\n$3,500,000\n\nPort of Tacoma\n\n$3,500,000\n\nTotal Budget\n\n$7,000,000\n\nContact Information"
