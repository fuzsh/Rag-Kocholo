        "text": "In the early 1880s, when the railroads came to the village of Sioux Falls, it quickly became apparent that the area would be a major nexus of activity in the state. By 1883, the population had boomed enough to graduate Sioux Falls from a village to a city. Much of the city’s rail lines were located on the east bank of the Big Sioux River, leaving residents with difficulty getting from the east side of the river to the west and back again.\n\nThere was a bridge built in 1876 for this purpose, but carts, wagons, pedestrians, and other conveyances often had to wait for train cars to pass by. The solution suggested was a viaduct, essentially a bridge over the Big Sioux and the collection of tracks that lay beyond.\n\nA great portion of the interest in building the 10th Street viaduct came from three businessmen: J. W. Jones, Mayor Porter Pascal Peck, and J. Schaetzel, Jr. All three owned land on 10th Street and thought it a fine and lucrative idea to open a passage between the banks to further their interests. As a result, the 10th Street viaduct was built in 1890 at no expense to the city. The men gathered as many interested parties as they could find, each contributing a portion of the proceeds. Over half of the money needed for the construction was provided by the South Dakota Rapid Transit System, an electric trolley system that hoped to ferry passengers to East Sioux Falls quarries and the Deaf Mute School.\n\nLooking Back: Center fought segregation, served Black community for 20 years in Sioux Falls\n\nThe original bridge was constructed of steel and wood. The wood would have to be freshened up from time to time, and could, and did, occasionally catch fire. On August 18, 1914, it burned enough to necessitate either replacement or a complete rebuild. The city had to decide between keeping the bridge over the river and putting a street over the railroad tracks, or rebuilding the viaduct. Public opinion was strongly weighted in favor of rebuilding. On October 31, 1914, the city made a deal with the railroads to share the expense of repairing the viaduct, and proceeded with repairing the original structure.\n\nIn 1923, the city started paving over the dirt streets downtown and officials began to consider replacing the wooden viaduct. On June 3, 1930, they announced their intent to replace it with a more resilient concrete structure. The city would have to suffer through the absence of the viaduct until the new structure was complete, which took until the end of 1930. It was a bridge the city could be proud of.\n\nOver the years, Sioux Falls grew, both east and west of the river. Downtown traffic started bottlenecking at the three-lane 10th Street viaduct. When the interstate was finally connected to east 10th Street, the congestion was expected to increase. Plans to remove the sidewalks on either side of the viaduct began to take shape, to allow for four lanes. These plans, which completely overlooked the safety of pedestrians, became a priority for the city. Another plan began to brew that year: A crossing at 11th Street.\n\nLooking Back: Team Electronics provided TVs, stereo equipment and video games into the 1980s\n\nThe city began working with the railroads, trying to manage a bridge over the Big Sioux at 11th Street, with an at-grade crossing of the tracks thereafter. For years, the two parties failed to come up with a solution. By 1966, the new post office at Second Avenue and 11th Street had been completed, drawing still more traffic to the area. By 1968, the 10th Street viaduct was in need of resurfacing, and the 11th Street crossing had yet to come to fruition. The city finally established a plan to make the 11th Street conduit a viaduct that would meet up alongside the 10th Street viaduct’s eastern approach. It was a much bigger project, but in the end would relieve traffic congestion tremendously.\n\nThe 11th Street viaduct opened on November 23, 1971. Eastbound traffic would use the 11th Street passage, and westbound, the 10th Street.\n\nOn the rare occasion that one viaduct is closed for repairs, we can imagine what it was like in the days before both routes existed, but for the most part, traffic flows nicely from east to west across the Big Sioux River and the railroad tracks still in use today."
