        "text": "by Nena Perry-Brown\n\n✉️ Want to forward this article? Click here.\n\nWhile maintaining its community programming and equity initiatives, the 11th Street Bridge Park project is also progressing through the approval process — and could deliver in 2024.\n\nThe development will reuse the structural pillars of the former 11th Street Bridge (map) spanning the Anacostia River to form the base of what will be DC's first elevated park. A recent update indicates that the development is at 30% design and should be at 100% design by next spring.\n\nOnce 100% design is complete, the development team will seek a general contractor in hopes of breaking ground in late 2022 or early 2023. This puts the likely completion date in 2024.\n\nSince the progress made last year, the project team, helmed by Building Bridges Across the River, is currently completing an environmental assessment with the National Park Service. Permit applications have also been submitted to the Coast Guard and the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nThe seesaw-shaped structure will have multiple pedestrian and bicyclist access points along the stretch and in the communities on either side, and will offer activity areas to include an amphitheater, an environmental education center, a play area, a café, a boat launch, a community farm, and a hammock grove.\n\nAll renderings courtesy of OMA and Luxigon.\n\nloading..."
