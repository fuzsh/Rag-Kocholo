        "text": "by UrbanTurf Staff\n\n✉️ Want to forward this article? Click here.\n\nOn Thursday morning, the design jury for the highly-anticipated DC park will announce that the winning proposal comes from the team of OLIN, OMA and Arup.\n\nPlans have been in the works for over a year to turn three concrete piers into one elevated park connecting Anacostia and Navy Yard. The goal of the project is to create a connecting design with an appeal similar to that of the Providence River Bridge park in Rhode Island, although many compare the planned park to the High Line in New York City.\n\nThe design from OLIN, OMA and Arup, called Anacostia Crossing, consists of two ramps, projecting from each shore, that intersect and elevate to create “a series of outdoor programmed spaces and active zones that will provide an engaging place hovering above, yet anchored in, the Anacostia River.” Among those programmed spaces are an amphitheater, an environmental education center, a sculpture garden and a boat launch.\n\nFrom the team’s design statement:\n\nThe intersection point of the two paths shapes the central meeting point of the bridge—an open plaza that provides a flexible venue for markets, festivals, and theatrical performances held throughout the year. The paths that frame this plaza further enhance the bridge as a hub of activity, providing a sequence of zones designated for play, relaxation, learning and gathering.\n\nA total of 41 design proposals came in for the park, and a committee narrowed those down to six back in April. In May, those six were narrowed down to a final four, which were announced in September.\n\nWhile a team has now been chosen to design the park, the big question that remains is whether or not the necessary funds will materialize to make the massive project a reality. Approximately $40 million needs to be raised in order to construct and operate the park. Scott Kratz, the director of the 11th Street Bridge Park, says that the DC government has already committed just shy of $15 million for construction costs.\n\nloading..."
