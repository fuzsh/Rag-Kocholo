        "text": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (Dakota News Now) - Several street construction projects begin this week in Sioux Falls, including intersection and lane closures.\n\nSeveral projects began last week and on Monday with more starting on Tuesday and the following days.\n\n10th Street & Interstate 229 Intersection Closures and Ramp Closure\n\nBeginning on Tuesday, July 30, 2024, between 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM, there will be short-term intersection closures on 10th Street at Cleveland Avenue, Thompson Avenue, Sneve Avenue, and Bahnson Avenue for asphalt paving. Beginning on Wednesday, July 31, 2024, there will be short-term closures for the Interstate 229 northbound off-ramp at 10th Street between 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM. Weather permitting, this work is expected to be completed within a few days. Drivers are urged to use caution and reduced speeds while traveling near the construction area and may want to consider alternate routes.\n\nFourth Avenue Lane Closure\n\nBeginning on Wednesday, July 31, 2024, the two southbound lanes on Fourth Avenue will be closed between East Amidon Street and East Maple Street to allow crews to perform concrete repairs. Southbound traffic will be shifted to allow for one lane of traffic in each direction. All work is expected to be completed within one week, weather depending. Drivers are urged to use caution and reduced speeds while traveling near the construction area and may want to consider alternate routes.\n\nRussell Street Lane Closure\n\nBeginning on Wednesday, July 31, 2024, the eastbound and westbound inside lanes of the Russell Street bridges over the Big Sioux River will be closed to allow crews to perform bridge maintenance work. Traffic will be maintained in the two outside lanes in both the eastbound and westbound directions. In the upcoming weeks, the location of the lane closures on the bridges will vary. At a minimum, one lane of traffic in each direction will remain open at all times. This work is anticipated to be completed by mid-October. Drivers are urged to use caution and reduced speeds while traveling near the construction area and may want to consider alternate routes.\n\n10th & 11th Street Lane Closure\n\nBeginning on Monday, August 5, 2024, the northernmost lane on West 10th Street and West 11th Street will be closed at South Prairie Avenue to allow crews to perform concrete removals for curb repairs and accessible curb ramp improvements. Two lanes of traffic will be maintained at all times on 10th Street and 11th Street. This work is Phase One of the Traffic Signal, Pedestrian & Bicycle Improvements project, which is part of the 15th Street Bicycle Boulevard. Phase One of the project is expected to take two weeks, at which time traffic control will be switched and Phase Two will begin. Phase Two of the project will close the southern portion of each intersection. Two lanes of traffic will be maintained at all times on 10th Street and 11th Street."
