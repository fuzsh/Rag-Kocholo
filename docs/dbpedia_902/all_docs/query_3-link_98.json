        "text": "Converting abandoned infrastructure into thoughtful, pedestrian park space has been all the rage since the High Line opened to visitors in 2009. It only makes sense that Washington DC would do the same with a bridge that had hit its safety expiration date, and last week the judging committee for the 11th Street Bridge Park announced that OMA + OLIN would be the chosen architects for the city's project. Their proposal for an angular, multi-use park (complete with waterfalls on both ends) beat out ideas from three other firms.\n\nLike other elevated parks, the 11th Street Bridge Park project will be built on out-of-use infrastructure; in this case it’s an aging freeway that stretches over the Anacostia River. The bridge was built to last 50 years, and now that it’s expiration date is up the city can flip it into its first elevated public park. But, as OMA partner-in-charge Jason Long points out, the High Line and other elevated parks are “basically a path you walk down. You’re generally always in motion.”\n\nThe 11th Street Bridge needs to be a destination rather than a thoroughfare. The bridge connects two very different neighborhoods---the more affluent, developed Navy Yards on one side, and the more neglected Anacostia on the other---that have historically had very little interaction or shared space. If this new design can create that for the first time, it could help revitalize the Anacostia neighborhood’s economy and local amenities.\n\nTo make it clear to visitors that the 11th Street Bridge Park is a place to linger, not power walk through, OMA + OLIN designed what Long calls “spaces that are really hardwired into the bridge.” Permanent spaces are possible because the two teams fashioned an X-shaped structure that’s cantilevered up in the center to allow boats passage: “We designed this X form, and there’s several things that fall out of that form,” Long says. “It creates multiple layers so there’s multiple levels you can occupy, and they form roofs over buildings, which creates spaces for programs.” This contrasts heavily with the landscape language of the High Line, which uses long floorboards in their walkway to create something like a visual current going downstream. As of now these structures in the 11th Street Bridge will include cafes, performance spaces, and environmental education centers, as well as a rotating program of local artists and artists who work with water.\n\nWater, in general, plays a hefty role in the new design. The Anacostia River that flows beneath the bridge catches a ton of industrial, storm runoff, and sewage pollution, making it generally unusable for any of Washington’s DC’s citizens. “The goal is to have a river you can swim and fish in by 2025,” says OLIN partner Hallie Boyce, who led this project. To do that, the 11th Street Bridge Park will have to be part education center, part water treatment center. The latter will happen at the waterfalls, which act like large scale visualizations displaying how plants clean water, and in a series of floating wetlands near the shore.\n\nBoyce also says the environmental education center could include features like digital displays that map in real time the progress of the river’s health. Kayak and canoe rentals offshore, while not exactly educational tools, will be set up to give residents more access to the river. The idea, Boyce says, is to encourage a new generation of stewardship over the local environment.\n\nProject 2025 Wants to Propel America Into Environmental Catastrophe\n\nTracking emissions, managing pollutants, responding to natural disasters—even accurately predicting the weather—would all be trampled in a wave of privatization, deregulation, and unfettered fossil-fuel exploitation.\n\nA New Plan to Break the Cycle of Destructive Critical Infrastructure Hacks\n\nAs digital threats against US water, food, health care, and other vital sectors loom large, a new project called UnDisruptable27 aims to help fix cybersecurity weaknesses where other efforts have failed.\n\nElon Musk Has Turned X Into His Personal Political Playground\n\nElon Musk accused Twitter’s leadership of tipping the scales politically. But now he’s doing just that with X.\n\nThe Olympics' Hostile Architecture Is a Preview of What's to Come\n\nUnder a bridge in Paris, a homeless encampment has been replaced with dozens of giant Lego-like bricks. Campaigners say things will likely get worse at the 2028 Games in LA.\n\nThe 51 Best Movies on Netflix Right Now\n\nWicked Little Letters, Lumberjack the Monster, and Godzilla Minus One are just a few of the movies you should watch on Netflix this month.\n\nDonald Trump Backs ‘Strategic Bitcoin Stockpile’ in Speech to Crypto Faithful\n\nAppearing onstage at the Bitcoin 2024 conference, Trump also promised to “fire” SEC chair Gary Gensler, set up a crypto advisory council, and make the United States the “crypto capital of the world.”\n\nTo Lead in AI, the US Needs a Silicon Revolution\n\nUS Commerce Department undersecretary Laurie E. Locascio says America needs to invent new chip manufacturing techniques.\n\nGoogle Search Is an Illegal Monopoly, US Judge Rules\n\nNearly a year after the US government took Google to trial, a judge has found that the tech giant violated antitrust laws. A new trial will determine how Google should be penalized."
