        "text": "Featured Event\n\nCommunity Conversation to Stop Human Trafficking\n\nFebruary 9, 2023 - 10 a.m.\n\nUniversity of Science & Arts of Oklahoma\n\nStudent Center Ballroom\n\nThe Oklahoma Commission on the Status of Women (OCSW) is partnering with the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma (USAO) and Dr. Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher Center for Social Justice and Racial Healing to host a Community Conversation to Stop Human Trafficking. The event is scheduled for Friday, Feb. 9, at 10 a.m. in the ballroom on the second floor of the Student Union, located at 1727 W. Alabama in Chickasha. The event is free and open to the public.\n\nEach year, an estimated 4,000 Oklahomans seek help from human trafficking situations. OCSW recently launched two educational initiatives to stop-human trafficking — a series of Community Conversations to Stop Human Trafficking at schools and a Not Me, Not My Community initiative.\n\n“Human trafficking is modern-day slavery,” said Commission State Chair Brenda Jones Barwick. “It’s a $150 billion a year industry, and Oklahoma is not immune to it. Most human trafficking in Oklahoma is not happening by people passing through on highways, but by members in their circle of trust, such as family members, friends, or acquaintances, who entrap them into involuntary servitude through labor, sex, or drugs.”\n\nThe series of Community Conversations to Stop Human Trafficking are held at high schools, colleges, and universities statewide to educate Oklahoma teens, young adults, teachers, and parents on how to recognize early signs of a person being targeted for human trafficking servitude.\n\nA panel of Oklahoma professionals and experts provide the full spectrum of human trafficking occurring in Oklahoma. Panelists include non-profit organizations that are providing healing and recovery services and resources to people entrapped into human trafficking. The discussion will highlight tribal and ethnic groups whose populations have experienced a high level of people forced into involuntary slavery; and law enforcement and drug interdiction officers who have been trained to recognize the signs of a bondage situation.\n\nFor the first time, the Commission is focusing on prevention of human trafficking, whereas in the past, the focus has been on dealing with human trafficking after the crime has occurred, Barwick stated.\n\nShe added, “Many are unaware they are being trafficked because it is typically a slow, methodical recruitment process by a trusted relationship. The Commission is educating Oklahomans to recognize the first, second and third phase by traffickers and empowering Oklahomans to stand strong and say, ‘Not Me, Not My Community’ to the trafficker.”\n\nThe Commission began its work on human trafficking in 2014 when it partnered with the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics to host Solutions, Initiatives, Strategies on Human Trafficking Summit. For the last two years, First Lady Sarah Stitt has hosted an annual summit on this topic at the Governor’s Mansion with a panel of experts. In 2022, the Commission formed a Stop Human Trafficking subcommittee led by Commissioner Dr. Nyla Khan to plan and implement the educational events.\n\nAdditional information about the Commission’s work on human trafficking, including a White Paper published in 2021, can be found at https://oklahoma.gov/ocsw/human-trafficking.html.\n\nFor more information to schedule a Community Conversation or obtain Not Me Not My Community materials, contact the Commission at ocswadmin@omes.ok.gov or call 405-401-6970.\n\nGIVE TO THE CENTER\n\nYour gift in support of the Center make it possible for us to bring events like this to campus.\n\nGIVE NOW\n\nPast EVENTS"
