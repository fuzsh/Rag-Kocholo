        "text": "Project Purpose\n\nThe City seeks to promote, manage, and maintain a safe, efficient, and integrated multi-modal transportation system to support a healthy and vibrant community. This project aims to create an interconnected multimodal network, completing a link in the Bridge-to-Bridge trail between Manette Bridge and Evergreen Park, while also improving safety for all users.\n\nThe Cityâ€™s downtown growth center is poised to experience substantial growth in the very near future given the developments both under construction and currently being permitted. Traffic studies completed by the City show that the evening peak hour traffic through the existing signalized intersection at the west end of the Manette Bridge backs up over 1/3 mile south on Washington Avenue, affecting all side streets and create gridlock in the downtown area. A roundabout is both an immediate and long-term solution to the congestion and delay.\n\nNorth of this intersection, the existing corridor along 11th Street up to Pacific Avenue has limited pedestrian facilities. The existing sidewalks are discontinuous and in a state of disrepair, with obstructions reducing the available Pedestrian Access route (PAR) width and ADA accessibility. Bike users have to share the lane with vehicles as there are also no existing bike lanes within this section of roadway. In addition, sidewalk and street pavement on the local (lower) Washington Avenue will be reconstructed to improve paving, parking, and ADA accessibility to 11th Street Place.\n\nWith the roundabout, traffic capacity will be improved with a reduction in delays. The pavement will be reconstructed, and dedicated bike lanes will be added. Pedestrians will benefit from wider sidewalks and improvements to curb ramps. The project will include improved lighting for pedestrians and vehicles that use the corridor as well as waterline and storm drainage improvements. The project will greatly enhance safety and will have a profound impact on increasing pedestrian and bicycle activity."
