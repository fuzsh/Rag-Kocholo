        "text": "Project timeline has been updated in response to continued coordination with key stakeholders including railroads, utility companies, adjacent property owners, and Metro Transit's Gold Line Bus Rapid Transit project. Road closures and traffic detours will go into effect when bridge replacement work begins in early 2023. Kellogg Boulevard is expected to be re-opened to traffic in late 2025.\n\nNumerous local, state, and privately-led projects will happen concurrently with bridge work. To best manage the bridge contract and mitigate local traffic impacts, City staff will continue to review the project timeline and make adjustments as needed.\n\nA series of layouts showing final design features will be posted to the project webpage in Summer 2022. Construction updates will also be provided.\n\nThanks for viewing the videos about the Kellogg/3rd Street Bridge project and providing your feedback. (See March 3 update for videos)\n\nRead a summary of the feedback received\n\nTo stay informed about the Kellogg/3rd Street Bridge project, sign up for project updates in the blue bar at the bottom of the webpage.\n\nPlease watch the series of four videos on the Kellogg/3rd Street Bridge reconstruction project. The videos share information about the history of the Kellogg/3rd Street Bridge, proposed layout for the new bridge, proposed layout for Kellogg Boulevard between Broadway Street and Lafayette Street and the aesthetic enhancement opportunities.\n\nVideo Presentations\n\nPart 1 - What is this project and when is it happening?\n\nPart 2 - Road and Bridge Layout\n\nPart 3 - Roadway Details and Intersection Safety\n\nPart 4 - Aesthetic Enhancements\n\nPowerPoint Slides\n\nPart 1 - What is this project and when is it happening?\n\nPart 2 - Road and Bridge Layout\n\nPart 3 - Roadway Details and Intersection Safety\n\nPart 4 - Aesthetic Enhancements\n\nPublic Feedback Form - this survey closed on April 15, 2021\n\nIn April 2020, the City gathered initial feedback about the Kellogg/3rd Street Bridge reconstruction project from residents through a survey. Input gathered through the survey as well as the City's responses are available here.\n\nIn 2014, a structural analysis of the bridge supports found that traffic cannot be supported on the outer portions of the bridge deck. Traffic was immediately removed from those portions of the bridge. The resulting bridge does not meet the needs of the community and future multi-modal plans (including bus rapid transit between Union Depot and Woodbury).\n\nThe new bridge will have four lanes of traffic (two in each direction) and a barrier separated trail on both sides of the roadway. The trails will each be 12 feet wide, shared by bicycles and pedestrians, and separated from vehicle traffic by a concrete barrier. Intersections near Union Depot and at Mounds Boulevard will be reconstructed to improve safety and accessibility for pedestrians and vehicles, including bus rapid transit.\n\nBridge replacement is one of the Cityâ€™s priorities. The bridge carries around 14,000 vehicles each day, and traffic is not just from local neighborhoods.\n\nThe City secured project funding in 2023. The City is coordinating with partners and utilities to determine the specific construction timeline.\n\nConstruction is anticipated to start in summer 2024 and take approximately 3 years."
