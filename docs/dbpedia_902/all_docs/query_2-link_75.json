        "text": "Building Bridges Across the River was incorporated as a (501-c-3) nonprofit organization in 1997. The idea of building a community center in Southeast DC was first conceived by Chris Smith, CEO of the DC-based developer WC Smith. Smith envisioned a nonprofit that would lead a state-of-the-art campus that would later become the Town Hall Education Arts & Recreation Campus (THEARC). With the support of community stakeholders, elected officials and an engaged board of directors, BBAR raised capital funds and oversaw construction of the now 203,000 square-foot facility. In 2005, THEARC opened its doors as BBAR’s first facility serving families east of the Anacostia River.\n\nAs THEARC’s managing partner, BBAR is the engine behind all of the facility’s services and programs. The organization oversees and maintains the campus grounds, fosters collaboration between THEARC’s resident partners.\n\nToday, BBAR is expanding its footprint, leading programming and partnerships at THEARC, THEARC Theater, THEARC Farms, Skyland Workforce Center and the 11th Street Bridge Park. Through these collaborations, BBAR provides access to high quality educational, health, cultural, recreation, and social service programs which contribute to the revitalization of the community in southeast Washington.\n\nOver the past 13 years, BBAR has taken on several additional projects. In 2012, we welcomed the 11th Street Bridge Park project, which is now one of our core programs. In 2014, we partnered with The WorkPlace DC to open Skyland Workforce Center, which serves as a hub for workforce-oriented organizations who collaborate to offer a cohesive set of services and opportunities for residents seeking employment or career advancement. In 2018, we opened THEARC West, which adds a black box theater, expanded children’s clinic space, and four new resident partners. This year, we will have completed buildout of an institutional teaching kitchen and café, to be operated by DC Central Kitchen."
