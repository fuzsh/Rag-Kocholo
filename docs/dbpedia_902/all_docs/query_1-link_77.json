        "text": "May 18, 2022\n\nCommunity First Toolkit\n\nFor the past two years, 15 park organizations—led by the High Line Network—partnered with researchers from the Harvard Graduate School of Design and the Urban Institute to explore the potential of public space to bring benefits to our cities and towns. They did so with a commitment to equity in their work, delving into history, experimenting with ways to share power, and building systems to center community in their values and actions. This work resulted in the Community First Toolkit, a process and tools codifying a path to embed equity in public spaces for park practitioners.\n\nHigh Line Blog / May 10, 2020\n\nReimagining Public Space: Getting to Know the High Line Network\n\nAs the tagline says, the High Line Network is a group of infrastructure projects — and the people who are helping them come to life. One of these people is the High Line Network’s own vice president, Asima Jansveld. We may not be able to enjoy our public spaces as fully as we’d like to at the moment, but we will again soon—Asima spoke to us about what she does at the Network, why equitable public space matters, and the power of collective thinking.\n\nTrinity Park Conservancy / January 17, 2020\n\nTrinity Park Conservancy announced its Equitable Development Toolkit\n\nThe Harold Simmons Park Equitable Development Toolkit merges from the Trinity Park Conservancy’s mission to transform the Trinity River to become the heart of Dallas, fostering community development that brings the city together. Implicit in the Conservancy’s mission is a commitment to equity and equitable development.\n\nBuilding Bridges Across the River / May 17, 2019\n\n11th Street Bridge Park releases a short film about their equity work\n\nIn an effort to document the importance of community-driven investments and share lessons learned with the broader field, 11th Street Bridge Park has created a short film about their approach to equitable development.\n\nThe New York Times / August 10, 2018\n\nTransforming Tulsa, starting with a park\n\nGathering Place is a much-anticipated park that opens Sept. 8 as one of the most ambitious public parks ever created with private funds. The park’s founders and community leaders hope it can bring families together and help mend a city with a legacy of segregation.\n\nHuffPost / April 2, 2018\n\nMore cities are banishing highways underground—and building parks on top\n\nCities looking to revitalize their downtowns are creating “highway cap parks” on decks constructed over freeways that cut through the urban center, reconnecting neighborhoods sliced apart by expressways built in the 1960s and ’70s.\n\nKCET / February 20, 2018\n\nThe bigger picture: the many visions of the Los Angeles River's future\n\nRevitalizing the Los Angeles River is a complex process that will ultimately impact a wide range of people, plants, and animals. This is a guide to the multitude of stakeholders advocating for their vision of the L.A. River.\n\nUrban Toronto / January 8, 2018\n\nUnveiling The Bentway Skate Trail\n\nThe first section of the project—the Skate Trail—officially opened to the public on January 5. The track is just one small part of the 1.75 km stretch under the Gardiner that is being transformed into public space.\n\nThe Washington Post / September 25, 2017\n\nPhilanthropists flock to D.C.’s Bridge Park\n\nThe proposed 11th Street Bridge Park continues to inspire big-name philanthropists—JPMorgan Chase will donate $10 million in Wards 7 and 8 of the District, including $5 million to preserve affordable housing for low-income residents."
