        "text": "Washington, D.C.\n\nOMA\n\n2014–ongoing\n\nAs with many urban freeways across the United States, Interstate 295 in Washington, D.C. was built right through an historically Black neighborhood, limiting residents in Anacostia from interaction with the rest of the city. After years of neglect, the 11th Street Bridge—a now defunct vehicular bridge off the highway—fell into disrepair. City leaders advocated turning the old bridge span into a park, one that would connect long-divided neighborhoods and serve as an anchor for equitable and inclusive economic growth. OMA was hired to realize this idea and adapt the existing urban infrastructure into the city’s first elevated public park, perched above the Anacostia River.\n\nThe design’s seesaw-shaped structure aims to create a pedestrian link between the east and west sides of the river, bridging the historically entrenched divisions that dominate—disparities of income and investment that all too often align with race and are reinforced by geography. With multiple pedestrian and bicyclist access points along the stretch and in the communities on either side, the park will offer spaces for healthy recreation, environ-mental education, and the arts. As part of its planning efforts, the 11th Street Bridge Park launched an Equitable Development Plan that aspires to avoid the worst impacts of gentrification and ensure that those living there are the real beneficiaries of development."
