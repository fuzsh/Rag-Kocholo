        "text": "I know the last movie bombed, i was the ONLY person in the theater when i saw it.\n\nBut BR has been a legend for a long time, and i'd kinda like to see an expanded universe version of it.\n\nThey had offworld travel and colonies, we never saw those. We saw little but LA and las vegas in the two canon films. It might be interesting to see the rest of the BR universe.\n\nThere was some sort of battle out in the colonies. \"I've seen attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I've seen C-beams glitter in the darkness near the Tannhauser gate.\" Who or what were they fighting? Intercine human wars? Something else?\n\nI kinda wish they could open bladerunner up an an alternate timeline and expand the setting.\n\nSoldier was actually part of the BR universe.\n\nSoldier\n\nLeft for dead on a remote planet for obsolete machines and people, a fallen hero has one last battle to fight. Soldier is a 1998 American science fiction action film directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, written by David Peoples and starring Kurt Russell, Jason Scott Lee, Jason Isaacs, Connie...\n\nSoldier is in the same universe in the same way that ALIEN is in the same universe.\n\nHeck, we see links between Weyland Yutani and Tyrell. We see a Sulaco (Conestoga-class) starship hanging in the sky. It's in the same universe as Escape from New York too.....\n\n\"There's an LAPD spinner in a scene of Soldier (1998), as well as Todd-3465's service record. Which also references fighting on the Shoulder of Orion, as well as qualified w/USCM Smart-gun and earning a Plissken Patch\"\n\nWhen you put the best bits of the movies, books, and comics in the Blade Runner and Alien/Aliens universe together, along with the original novella \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" and the movie \"Soldier,\" you get a pretty nice expanded universe to work with. There are some nice combined timelines out there that would be useful in running a game of that nature. One of these days I would love to do a campaign like that, if I can ever round up enough interested players.\n\nThere is also an official sequel novel Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human. I haven't read that one, but K.W. Jeter is a good writer and was a close friend of Dick's. I believe that while it is a sequel to the movie, he brings in setting elements from the original novel that weren't in Blade Runner.\n\nThere is also an official sequel novel Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human.
