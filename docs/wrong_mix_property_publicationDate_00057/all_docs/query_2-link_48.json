        "text": "I’m so torn on “Blade Runner 2049.” As a pure movie-going experience, the sequel to the sci-fi cult classic from 1982 is not what it’s advertised. The action is only sprinkled in from time to time and the pace is, at times, plodding. But as a slow-burning, introspective look at what makes humans human with the occasional edge-of-your-seat gunfight, director Denis Villeneuve knocks it out of the park.\n\n“Blade Runner 2049” is not “John Wick” and that’s a good thing. Villeneuve stays true to the universe, themes and feel that now producer Ridley Scott created decades ago with the first.\n\nIt’s nearly three hours long and it definitely feels that way. This is both a critique and a compliment. Scenes are long, teetering on being drawn-out, and they carry so many bits and pieces of information that they are sometimes hard to take in with all the eye-poppingly beautiful visuals about, distracting the audience and begging to be appreciated. This worked for me. It won’t for others.\n\nThe acting, dialogue and attention to detail is what made the slow-moving pace of each scene palatable, if not surprisingly satisfying. Ryan Gosling (“La La Land,” “The Big Short”) is as good as he’s ever been in a lead role and Harrison Ford (“Star Wars,” “Indiana Jones”) is solid, although he’s not on the screen all that much. Dave Bautista (“Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Spectre”), Robin Wright (“The Princess Bride,” “House of Cards”), Ana de Armas (“Hands of Stone,” “War Dogs”) and Sylvia Hoeks (“The Best Offer”) also impress in their time on screen but this is very much Gosling’s movie and he carries it wonderfully.\n\nAt it’s core, “Blade Runner 2049” is a detective movie and a damn good one at that. As he did in last year’s “Arrival,” Villeneuve manages to never give too much info away as Gosling follows the breadcrumbs in an investigation of a case that could change the course of the eerie dystopian future. The final payoff and message is great. Although if you’re paying attention, it becomes very clear what it will be near the middle of the second act.\n\nSince its release, “Blade Runner 2049” has been called everything from an Oscar-worthy film to a failure because of its muted box office results compared to its $150,000,000 budget. I don’t think that it falls in to either one of those drastically different spectrums — director of photography Roger Deakins, however, might garner award recognition down the road. It’s a solid foray into a deep world that takes its time and doesn’t try to be something else. That’s commendable and, for me, enjoyable.\n\n8/10\n\n•••\n\nBOX OFFICE REVIEW\n\n1. “Happy Death Day”: $26,039,025 (Week 1); Universal.\n\n2. “Blade Runner 2049”: $15,429,244 (Week 2); Warner Bros.
