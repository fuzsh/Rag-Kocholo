        "text": "So much has already been said about Blade Runner 2049 that it’s hard to know where to begin. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the film is a belated follow up to Ridley Scott’s 1982 cult sci-fi classic, itself inspired by Philip K. Dick’s novel Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep. Sequels released decades after the original tend to disappoint, however, Blade Runner 2049 has enjoyed near universal acclaim from critics – many of whom have proclaimed it a masterpiece.\n\nBut amid reports of underwhelming box office returns, casual moviegoers might be wondering if Blade Runner 2049 lives up to the hype. The honest answer is not really, no. That said, if Villeneuve’s film isn’t quite as spectacular as its critical reception suggests, it’s always good and often brilliant. More importantly, it’s a worthy yet flawed continuation of the Blade Runner story that should please newbies and diehards alike.\n\nSet 30 years after the original film, Blade Runner 2049 introduces us to K (Ryan Gosling), an enhanced artificial human, or replicant. K works as a Blade Runner: a police detective charged with “retiring” (read: killing) unsanctioned, older model replicants. During a routine investigation, K unearths a mystery that threatens to tip the perilously balanced human/replicant society over the edge and into a full-blown revolution.\n\nDriven to learn more, K begins to dig deeper. This brings him to the attention of sinister replicant manufacturer Niander Wallace (Jared Leto), who will do anything to get his hands on the knowledge K has uncovered. Wallace sends his replicant enforcer Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) after K, as K – accompanied by his AI girlfriend Joi (Ana de Armas) – goes off-grid in his search for the truth. This leads him to legendary former Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who may hold the answers K and Wallace are both desperate to find.\n\nVilleneuve and Blade Runner 2049 co-writers Hampton Fancher and Michael Green deserve kudos for delivering a story that’s both accessible to newcomers and appealing to long-time fans. The pair shows admirable restraint when it comes to referencing the first Blade Runner, and the few callbacks we get to the 1982 original mostly feel organic. This isn’t a “greatest hits” outing, either. Rather than simply recycling the best bits of its predecessor, Fancher and Green tell a new story set in a familiar, albeit far more sprawling, world.\n\nYet what Blade Runner 2049 gains in scope, it loses in lyricism. Like the original film, the sequel’s script – especially the dialogue – is peppered with religious and philosophical undertones, however, these are less deftly handled. Viewers who come in expecting poetic sensibilities on par with Roy Batty’s dying soliloquy will leave disappointed. The film also suffers from a thinly drawn villain in Wallace, who wanders in and out of the narrative without ever properly clarifying his goals (he wants to expand his reach throughout the universe…or something?). This storytelling looseness extends to the pacing, and the plot-hole-riddled narrative slows to a crawl at times.\n\nStill, the plodding pace evokes the original Blade Runner‘s more meditative spin on the sci-fi blockbuster formula, and Villeneuve and the writers deserve credit for embracing the franchise’s intellectual roots. They even widen the thematic focus of the first film, probing not just what it means to be human, but the reality of what humans – artificial or otherwise – feel. Blade Runner 2049 repeatedly forces its characters to examine the authenticity of their relationships, memories, and identities, knowing that, deep down, they’ll never be certain of anything.\n\nIt’s heady stuff, yet unlike the original film, Blade Runner 2049 is less about questions than answers. That’s not a problem per se, however, it does mean that by the end, we’re not left with much to reflect on. Villeneuve at least stops short of definitively clearing up the biggest ambiguity in the first Blade Runner, presumably understanding – unlike even Ridley Scott himself – that the question is more important than the answer. But otherwise, by the time the credits roll, there’s nothing to really mull over, which is a slight disappointment.\n\nIf the Blade Runner 2049 screenplay is a bit uneven, the cast is decidedly more consistent. Gosling is a good fit for brooding detective K, while de Armas turns in a heartfelt, soulful performance as Joi. Mackenzie Davis – who garnered well-deserved acclaim for her work in the most recent season of Black Mirror – is also outstanding, imbuing Doctor Ana Stelline with just the right blend of intelligence and warmth. Then there’s Ford, who is a revelation in his second outing as Deckard. The veteran actor only has a small role (it’s practically a cameo), but it’s some of his finest work – not just in recent years, but maybe ever.\n\nFaring less well by comparison are Leto as Wallace and Robin Wright as K’s boss, Lieutenant Joshi. In fairness, it’s not really their fault. Both suffer from thinly-sketched roles that give them little to work with, and their efforts are still more than serviceable. Hoeks finds herself in a similar boat. While she’s effective as secondary antagonist, Luv, her underwritten part ensures lands somewhere between “intriguing cipher” and “stock psychotic henchwoman”.\n\nFortunately, there’s one area in which Blade Runner 2049 is an unqualified success: the visuals. As you’d expect, the marriage of legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins’ talents and the Blade Runner “neo-noir” aesthetic established by Syd Mead yields stunning results. Along with production designer Dennis Gassner, Deakins pushes this bleakly beautiful look even further, and the addition of stark, vivid desert landscapes lends the film a unique identity separate from (but in keeping with) its predecessor.\n\nIndeed, in many ways, Blade Runner 2049 is everything modern cinema needs. It’s ambitious, intelligent, and – despite being based on an existing property – largely avoids trading on nostalgia. But while Denis Villeneuve deserves praise for delivering an enthralling sequel to the original Blade Runner, his movie isn’t quite as flawless as the critical consensus suggests, so bear that in mind going in."
