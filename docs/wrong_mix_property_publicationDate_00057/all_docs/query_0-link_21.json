        "text": "Quirky, Ominous, Immersive\n\nFirst, rest assured this is a recording of Phillip K. Dick's book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and not a novelization of the film. However, this is one instance in which the book compliments the film. Phillip K. Dick, who didn't live to see the film completed but did see production stills and read the script, also felt the film complimented his work: one can add to the appreciation of the other. Having seen the film before reading (or listening) to the book, I feel like I have a better understanding of both and can appreciate each on its own merits.\n\nOn a near-future earth ravaged by the radioactive fallout of the last World War, the remnants of humanity who have stubbornly decided to stay (instead of emigrating to the off-world colonies) occasionally have to contend with androids--escapees from their lives as servants on the off-world colonies. Much of humanity has reached a state of relative peace thanks to a religion based on empathy (sympathizing and then identifying with another), but the androids lack empathy and are thus dangerous to other humans, so its up to bounty hunters like Rick Deckard to find out who is human and who is machine and \"retire\" the androids.\n\nPhillip K. Dick's books often have wacky premises, but the reason readers and film producers keep coming back to his work is that he creates a compelling internal logic and structure of feeling for his characters to act within. Deckard comes to question how he defines his humanity and the perils/limits of empathy, for example. This book isn't action-based (although there is some of that), but really based around tense moments (and to Dick's credit, they are tense moments) where Deckard is having crisis of conscience or is questioning who is a real person, who is artificial, and what that distinction means. This led to several moments that put me on the edge of my seat. The ominous atmosphere of post-nuclear earth, the inhuman threat of the androids, and the other strange elements of the story come together to form a quirky but immersive atmosphere for Deckard's inner struggles with himself and outer struggle with the androids.\n\nI would summarize Scott Bricks typical narrative style in two words: broody and languid. He draws out words and creates an almost hypnotic rolling effect with his voice that is enjoyable if you are in the mood for that. Brick doesn't read, he performs, but that performance may not be to everyone's taste (so do listen to the sample clip). Still, it fits well with this book: his almost melancholy narration highlights the gloom of post-nuclear Earth and the broodiness of the characters themselves.\n\nLove the book, disliked the read\n\nIn looking at other reviews I find I am not alone in not caring for the reading of this classic. One reviewer stated that Scott Brick is one of his favorites so I'll give him another chance. It seems to me the sentences were divided into phrases for drama but the effect was lost when every sentence seemed to have this effect.\n\nThe conversational flow was lost and it was choppy.\n\nI only wish Harrison Ford read this one. The version of the movie where he narrated was the best one (to me anyway)\n\nDispite my dislike of the read I enjoyed the book very much. I read the hard cover version years ago and it was a nice refresher.\n\nOne of the very best\n\nI read this book many years ago, the first PKD novel I read actually. Since then I have read/listened to all the 32 PKD sci fi novels published during his lifetime and the zelazny collaboration, his non sci fi (confessions of a crap artist and the post humorously published radio free albemuth. Now I revisited this one to end my PKD obsession. It is definitely great and very much better than the quite good film Bladerunner from the 80s. What is empathy and can you be empathetic towards things lacking empathy? Can you not be? Philosophical questions in this novel that after Ubik and Valis may be PKDs best and most complex. Finally it is striking how Hollywood changes not only the story but also the whole meaning of PKDs works when adapting them for the screen, this one not an exception."
