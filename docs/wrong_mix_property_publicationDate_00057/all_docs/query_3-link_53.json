        "text": "deckard24 said:\n\nWhat's up with all the board members here who haven't seen Blade Runner? Rick Deckard is by far one of Ford's best roles, along with Det. John Book in Witness, and Dr. Richard Kimble in The Fugitive! In a way I kind of envy you, because you get to experience it for the first time! If and when you do see it, make sure it's on a great screen and as close to HD as you can get, because the new remastered DVD looks amazing! Even better would be to see it in the theater, as it's been popping up in smaller art house theaters a lot as of late.\n\nYou think that's bad. I still haven't seen The Empire Strikes Back.\n\nSaw 3lade Runner last night really good!\n\nBut they wold have to get Ridley scott again to pull it off or James Cameron and possibly Guillermo del Toro for possible directors.\n\nBut you would really need a good replacement for Deckard.\n\nI'm thinking Viggo Mortensen or Liam Nesson. They would both be good.\n\nI'm interested in another but as long there isn't an android army like Terminator, I Robot, Star Wars or any other Sci-Fi films.\n\nKeep it real minimum CGI and maximum drama!\n\nI don't think it'll ever happen.\n\nBut for all those who haven't seen Blade Runner, well, you should! It's one of Harrison's best roles, and the BR world is so different than anything before. It practically started the whole cyberpunk look. If you think about it, Harrison was on a great roll there of genre movies. Star Wars in '77, Empire in '80, Raiders in '81, Blade Runner in '82, Return of the Jedi in '83, and Temple of Doom in '84.\n\nInsomniac said:\n\nAre you talking about the no voice over ending or with them driving thou the country side (I heard that one sucks)?\n\nThe first version I saw ended as soon as Rick joined Rachael and closed the doors. Bang--credits. Best version in my opinion, as it leaves the most uncertainty.\n\nI checked out the voice-over version on YouTube and it leaves a less-than-pleasant taste in the mouth. My mouth, anyway. Too family-friendly, pandering to those who always want a happy ending. That wasn't the film's message--it was nearly the opposite! Loosely quoting from what I remember in the ending voice-over: \"Rachael was a special kind of replicant, and they said she would never die.\"\n\nAlivePoet said:\n\nThe first version I saw ended as soon as Rick joined Rachael and closed the doors.

But then again, who does?\"\n\nIt's also funny how Edward James Olmos, one of the greatest actors ever, did Blade Runner and went on to do Battlestar Galactica 20 years later. Both of which deal with robots who are identical to humans and whether or not they should be treated as such.\n\nResidentAlien said:\n\nThat's the quote from the Director's Cut. AlivePoet was referring to the (inferior) theatrical version in which the line is as he stated.\n\nThere are so many versions, I can't keep them straight. I thought that was in all of them.\n\nA new Blade Runner project?\n\nAintitcool has an interesting article, or blurb I should say about a possible new Blade Runner project:\n\nhttp://www.aintitcool.com/node/44418\n\nHmmm, not sure what to think. But I thought the accompanying commets were hilarious. And of course someone had to mention Shia as a new Rick Deckard.\n\nK W Jeter has already written sequels to Blade Runner (2: The Edge of Human and 3: Replicant Man). I've had the books on my bedside table for months, but have been too busy reading Star Wars novels to get around to them (currently reading the final part of Jeter's 'Bounty Hunter Wars' trilogy).\n\nThere's already been so many versions of Blade Runner, that I'd rather see a sequel than a reboot.\n\nIs it ever really established beyond doubt that Deckard was an android?\n\nI've had the Final Cut DVD for some months, and haven't gotten around to watching it yet, so I don't know if Ridley ever came to a definitive answer. There are three commentaries on the discs, so there might be some light shed amongst them.\n\nBlade Runner definitely doesn't need a reboot. Right from the original it had a special haunting quality, through the imagery, music and pensive tone.\n\nI'm not sure if a prequel would be a good thing, if it answered questions that were best left open."
