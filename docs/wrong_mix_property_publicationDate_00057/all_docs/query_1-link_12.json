        "text": "Well, you did ask us to look at Cityspeak, the invented pidgin that appears in Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner (1982). It seemed like it might be an interesting thing to try to get to the bottom of. As it transpired, that was certainly the case.\n\nThe iconic movie is a loose adaptation of Philip K. Dick’s 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, and features Harrison Ford as the titular Blade Runner Rick Deckard, a cop who is coerced into hunting down some escaped replicants, or androids who can pass for human.\n\nIn a futuristic Los Angeles (or to be precise a hauntological one as the film is set in 2019, a year which is now firmly in our past), Ridley Scott evokes a proto-cyberpunky Asian aesthetic to suggest a complicated multicultural milieu. (In the Eighties, and this is also the backdrop to much of the literary SF of the era, including cyberpunk fiction like William Gibson’s 1984 debut Neuromancer, the growing influence of Japanese multinationals investing in California was seen as a potentially dystopian development.)\n\nOne sometimes overlooked way in which this techno-orientalism is evoked in Blade Runner is via the film’s use of language. Japanese and Chinese (and briefly Korean) can be heard in the background, or spoken by minor characters. German also features in the linguistic melting pot of Scott’s future LA. But most intriguing is the existence of ‘Cityspeak’, a kind of creole which, it is suggested, is the lingua franca of the mean streets.\n\nCityspeak is primarily depicted in a single scene, that in which Gaff, played by Edward James Olmos, coerces Ford’s Rick Deckard into coming with him to meet Captain Bryant. Gaff encounters Deckard at the White Dragon noodle bar and addresses him in Cityspeak. The scene is below, but it is important to note that Blade Runner exists in at least seven different cuts, so there are of course variants of this scene extant.\n\nThe text, or I should say a variant of the text, for this interaction may be read here. Immediately you may see a problem. The Deckard voiceover text that explains Cityspeak in the script does not occur in the clip above. They relate to separate cuts of the movie. We can at this point take a minimalist or maximalist approach to Cityspeak. A maximalist approach is perhaps more conducive to getting useful information. After all, do we wish to tack faithfully to the director’s cut only and miss out on Deckard’s useful gloss of Cityspeak from the original cut? Obviously not. Thankfully, Blade Runner has some very enthusiastic fans and some of these have collaborated on a kind of syncretic version of this scene, working from multiple scripts and extracting information from books about the film and interviews with cast and crew.\n\nBefore we get to that however, some background information is useful. Detective Gaff as a character does not appear in Philip K. Dick’s original novel. Nor, for that matter, does Cityspeak. In fact, nor does Los Angeles. Dick’s novel is significantly different from the movie(s) Ridley Scott made, and both Gaff and his macaronic slang are movie additions without any source material from PKD.\n\nGaff was played, as stated, by Edward James Olmos, who is perhaps best known for his roles in television, especially as Lieutenant Castillo in Miami Vice (1984-90), and Admiral Adama in the rebooted Battlestar Galactica series (2004-9). Before Olmos was cast, one of the scriptwriters David Peoples had the idea that Gaff would speak in “some funny language” called Cityspeak. According to Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner by Paul M. Sammon, which is the definitive book on the movie, Peoples said “All I’d done was indicate that Gaff was speaking some funny language in the script and then translated that into English.”\n\nAccording to Olmos in Sammon’s book, “Cityspeak was already a word being tossed around when I came onto the picture. I’m not sure who came up with the actual word — I think it was David Peoples. But I guess I’m the guy who literalized it.” For Olmos, creating the language that Gaff speaks was part of the process of developing a backstory for the character. Olmos worked to flesh out the character as depicted in the script, adding ethnic dimensions, and decided to develop the Cityspeak which was referred to in relation to Gaff:\n\n“My first idea was to put a mixture of genuine Spanish, French, Chinese, German, Hungarian, and Japanese into Cityspeak,” Olmos said in Sammon’s text. “Then I went to the Berlitz School of Languages in Los Angeles, translated all these different bits and pieces of Gaff’s original dialogue into fragments of foreign tongues, and learned to properly pronounce them. I also added some translated dialogue I’d made up myself. All that was a bitch and a half, but it really added to Gaff’s character.”\n\nUnfortunately, Cityspeak does not feature in the sequel movie, Blade Runner 2049 (2017), despite the presence of Olmos’s character Gaff, who in that film speaks standard English only, as he does to Deckard at the end of the original film. However, Cityspeak is referenced in the sequel novel, Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human (1995) by K.W. Jeter, which commences with Gaff’s funeral, and his boss Bryant criticising the use of Cityspeak on Gaff’s tombstone. There were failed attempts to adapt this novel for cinema, and in the end the actual sequel followed a different plot, in which Gaff is alive in a retirement home.\n\nThere is a problem with this concept, however, in that from the limited exposure the audience are granted to Cityspeak, it appears to be a form of code-switching moreso than a formalised, or even semi-formalised, creole. Gaff mixes languages in the same sentence, then uses one language for an entire sentence. He introduces slang terms and locutions from multiple languages, to the extent that there remains a certain amount of debate over exactly what he might mean in a couple of instances.\n\nCode-switching as practiced by multilingual people lacks a formal arrangement for when or in what context a speaker might switch languages. It’s something they just do, dependent upon which language most easily or quickly expresses the concept they wish to convey, and also upon whether they need to move between registers of formality or not. The former could potentially apply to Gaff at the noodle stand, assuming he is approximately similarly fluent in Japanese, Hungarian, French, and so on. Given his generally offensive and informal tone, however, the latter clearly does not.\n\nPerhaps we might also consider Cityspeak to be a form of macaronics, a more formal multilingual mélange in which bilingual punning, giving word endings from one language to terms from another, and especially the mixing of ‘vulgar’ (ie vernacular) terms with Latin feature heavily. But Macaronics generally manifest in the form of verse, though there are prose examples including the quintessential macaronic text, James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake, and, arguably, Burgess’s A Clockwork Orange, which at the very least draws upon the Macaronic literary tradition, and especially Joyce’s Wake, to generate Nadsat.\n\nJudging from some of the script variants, and in particular from Deckard’s voiceover gloss that he understood the ‘lingo’, it seems that what Cityspeak was intended to be was a lingua franca, or Creole of multiple languages inhabiting the hauntological future LA in which Blade Runner takes place. However, neither Peoples, who simply wrote English lines for Gaff in the script, and noted that those were the translated meanings of “some funny language” called Cityspeak, nor Olmos, who dutifully and enthusiastically obtained translations and pronunciations and even added additional material, were linguists. As a result, what they collectively have created in Cityspeak is little more than an implausible arrangement of code-switching across an equally unlikely array of languages.\n\nInvented languages in cinema and television developed a lot between 1982 and 2017, when the Blade Runner sequel emerged finally, and perhaps this is a component of the original movie that could have been revisited with some more linguistic coherence, not unlike how the director and producers of Star Trek took some sounds created by the actor who played Scotty (James Doohan) during the first Star Trek movie in 1979, and fleshed them out into a rudimentary Klingon language by the time of the third movie in 1984.\n\nIn the end, Denis Villeneuve and his team decided instead to jettison Olmos’s Cityspeak in Blade Runner: 2049, even in the single scene featuring Gaff. Perhaps this was for the best. Nevertheless, despite its implausibility, there’s something wonderful about the tiny fragments of Cityspeak which have come to us. Structurally incoherent it may be, but it has nuance and intrigue about it. Little wonder, then, that fans have pored over the noodle bar scene for decades now, parsing and reparsing Olmos’s handful of phrases. (This link, incidentally, will take you to the fan-created syncretic text for the scene mentioned above.)\n\nCityspeak therefore exists in a hinterland between fully created art-languages (like Klingon or Tolkien’s Elvish) and simple in-group cant, in a sort of Finnegans Wakesque multilingual paranomasia. Unfortunately, it lacks, despite the best intentions of David Peoples and especially Edward James Olmos, the kind of linguistic coherence in its invention that marks Anthony Burgess’s Nadsat.\n\nMost of all, it suggests a hauntological future which never happened, one in which a techno-Orientalist Los Angeles operated linguistically at street level across a range of East Asian and European languages. Today, of course, it primarily operates across a single albeit broad isogloss – the class and ethnic barrier between American English (and its sub-variants) and different versions of Latin American Spanish."
