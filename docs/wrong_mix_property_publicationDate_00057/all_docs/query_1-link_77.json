Universe.\n\nThe truth is none of those things.\n\nThe truth is all of those things.\n\nThe truth is some of those things.\n\nBiographical Notes For Philip K. Dick\n\nPhilip Kendred Dick and Jane Kendred Dick were born in Chicagoon December 16 th , 1928. Dick's fraternal twin, Jane, died 41 days later. At age 1 his family moved to Berkeley, California. His parents divorced when Philip was five and his father moved to Reno, Nevada. At age six, 1934 he and his mother moved to Washington, DC. By age 7, he was placed into a \"special school\", in part because he refused to eat. It was during this time that a psychiatrist diagnosed him as a potential schizophrenic, a diagnosis that would haunt him for the rest of his life. In 1939, he and his mother family moved back to Berkeley. It was here that he first encountered the Oz series of L. Frank Baum , which he cited as highly influential. He briefly attended the University of California at Berkeley, but dropped out before completing any classes. He worked variously as an advertising copywriter, a DJ on a classical music radio station (KSMO, Berkeley), and in a record store.\n\nHe sold his first story at age 22, in 1951. In June of 1953, he had 7 stories being published simultaneously in a variety of science fiction magazines, including Analog, Galaxyand F+SF. His first novel, The Solar Lottery , was published in 1954.\n\nBy 1968, the year that Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep was published, he had written 28 books. It is said that it was in this period that he began using methamphetaminesin order to write enough to support himself and his family. He also began using LSD , which he wrote about, in veiled form in novels such as A Scanner Darkly and wrote about it openly in essays that are reprinted in The Shifting Realities of Philip K. Dick . Methamphetamine use would plague Philip K. Dick for the remainder of his life, and probably was a leading factor in his death.\n\nThere is much anecdotal evidence to suggest that he did not sleep for a period of three years, and suffered from \"cocaine psychosis\" on at least one occasion. However, by the end of his life, he had published over 50 novels and short story collections, and was even able to see a rough cut of Blade Runner , the Ridley Scott film based on Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep , which was released shortly after his death.\n\nHowever, Philip K. Dick's legacy has endured:\n\nVALIS Opera:\n\nThis science fiction opera, composed by Tod Machover in 1987 for the 10th anniversary of the Pompidou Center in Paris , was the first time that Hyperinstrumentswere used. Based on a novel by Philip K. Dick, the story follows the life of Dick's alter-ego, Horselover Fat, who has a strange VALIS \"pink light\" experience, which might be a real spiritual revelation, but looks an awful lot like a technological experiment gone awry or maybe even a nervous breakdown. The entire \"orchestra\" for VALIS was made up of two instruments, hyperkeyboard and hyperpercussion. A CD recording of the work is available. Machover, a professor at the MIT media lab has a segment of the opera, with both video collage and music:\n\nwww.media.mit.edu/hyperins/quicktime/valis56k.mov\n\nIt requires Quicktime, and 56 KbPS or better net connection.\n\nIn 1985, the Mabou Mines Theater performed a stage play based on Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said in Boston and New York.\n\nRadio Free Albemuth , adapted by Lisa Morton, was produced at Theatre of N.O.T.E. in Los Angelesin 1991.\n\nA Philip K. Dick Society has existed and flourished for more than 15 years.\n\nThe designer Philippe Starck has claimed that Philip K. Dick is an influence on his designs. He has often named pieces of furniture after characters from Philip K. Dick's writings. Below is \"Francesca Spanish\", a chair designed by Starck, named after a character from the novel Ubik .\n\nHis novels have been required reading for modern literature courses .\n\nIn 1997, Virgin Interactive Entertainment released a video game for Blade Runner , using the voices of many of the original cast 15 years after the film's theatrical release, a testament to its enduring legacy.\n\nPhilip K. Dick went through a series of unsuccessful marriages throughout his life. All in all, he was married five times and had three children\n\n(2 daughters, 1 son) . The influence of these marriages can be seen in a great deal of his writing. In fact, it was under such circumstances, that The Man In the High Castle was written.\n\n\"My marriage of eight years broke up; I moved out into the country, met an artistically inclined woman who had just lost her husband. We met in October [1958] and the next April we had gotten married in Ensenada, Mexico. I had her and three girls to take care of, and for two years I was unable to produce anything except hack work. At last I gave up and went to work for my wife, in her jewelry business. I was miserable.... With Anne I could not fulfill myself because her own creative drive was so strong that she often declared that my creative work \"got in her way.\" Even in the jewelry making I merely polished pieces she designed. My sense of self-worth began to flag, so I hitched myself to the priest of our times, the psychologist-psychiatrist, and asked his advice. \"Go home,\" he said, \"and forget the jewelry business... Go home... and simply write a good book, a book you believe in. You can stop fixing breakfast for the kids and assisting you wife in her welding. Write a book.\" I did so, without preamble; I simply sat down and wrote. And what I wrote was The Man In the High Castle .\"\n\n(excerpt quoted from The Shifting Realities of Philip K. Dick[pp. 15-16])\n\nThose familiar with the plot of The Man In the High Castle will recognize Dick's real life circumstances, i.e., the jewelry making, as inspiration for one of the central themes of the novel. In 1963, Philip K. Dick received the Hugo Award for The Man In the High Castle .\n\nOn March 22, 1974, the day after the vernal equinox, Philip K. Dick had a transcendental mystical experience, which he described as \"an invasion of my mind by a transcendentally rational mind.\" This experience caused Philip K. Dick to begin recording his thoughts and experiences into a journal, which he referred to as the Exegesis. The Exegesis contained a phenomenal amount of Gnostic religious thought and philosophy. The majority of his experiences and philosophies formed during this period can be found in the VALIS trilogy\", which includes VALIS , The Divine Invasion , and The Transmigration of Timothy Archer . An alternate accounting of the events of Philip K. Dick's VALIS encounter can be found in more accessible form in the novel Radio Free Albemuth , which was discovered among Dick's notes after his death.\n\nPhilip K. Dickwas an incredibly imaginative writer, with the ability to twist every day circumstances around to such a degree that even the most mundane of situations could become outrageous and alien. He often felt that it was his role, as an author to write stories that would \"wake up\" his readers to the ills and perils of society. Nearly every story he ever wrote probed the nature of truth and reality, repeatedly asking \"What is actually real?\" in one form or another.\n\nPhilip K. Dick died of heart failure following a stroke on March 2nd, 1982 in Santa Ana, California.\n\nBibliography:\n\n(arranged chronologically, according to year of publication)\n\nThe Solar Lottery [1954]\n\n(aka World of Chance)\n\nThe World Jones Made[1956]\n\nMan Who Japed [1956]\n\nThe Eye in the Sky[1956]\n\nVariable Man [1957]\n\nThe Cosmic Puppets[1957]\n\nTime Out of Joint[1959]\n\nDr. Futurity [1960]\n\nVulcan's Hammer [1960]\n\nThe Man In the High Castle[1962]\n\nThe Game Players of Titan[1963]\n\nMartian Timeslip[1964]\n\nDr. Bloodmoney, Or How We Got Along After the Bomb[1964]\n\nPenultimate Truth [1964]\n\nThe Simulacra[1964]\n\nClans of the Alphane Moon[1964]\n\nThree Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch[1965]\n\nThe Crack In Space [1966]\n\nNow Wait For Last Year[1966]\n\nThe Unteleported Man (Later published as Lies, Inc.in the UK) [1966]\n\nThe Zap Gun[1967]\n\nThe Ganymede Takeover [1967] (with Ray Nelson)\n\nCounter-Clock World [1967]\n\nDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep[1968]\n\nThe Galactic Pot-Healer[1969]\n\nThe Preserving Machine [1969] (short story anthology)\n\nUbik[1969]\n\nMaze of Death[1970]\n\nOur Friends From Frolix 8[1970]\n\nWe Can Build You[1972]\n\nConfessions of a Crap-Artist[1975]\n\nFlow My Tears, the Policeman Said[1974]\n\nDeus Irae[1976] (with Roger Zelazny)\n\nA Scanner Darkly[1977]\n\nVALIS[1981]\n\nThe Divine Invasion[1981]\n\nThe Transmigration of Timothy Archer[1982]\n\nBlade Runner[1982] ( AKA Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep)\n\nThe Man Whose Teeth Were All Exactly Alike [1984?]\n\nPuttering About In This Small Land[1985]\n\nRadio Free Albemuth[1985]\n\nUbik: The Screenplay [1985]\n\nIn Milton Lumky Territory [1985]\n\nHumpty Dumpty In Oakland [1986]\n\nMary and the Giant [1987]\n\nThe Broken Bubble [1988?]\n\nNick and the Glimmung [1988?]\n\nThe Dark-Haired Girl[1988] (collection of fiction and non-fiction)\n\nVoices from the Street [unpublished]\n\nGather Yourself Together [unpublished]\n\nCollections and Posthumous Releases:\n\nIn Pursuit of VALIS: Selections From the Exegesis[1991]\n\nSelected Letters of Philip K.

The novel Time Out of Jointis about a man that has had an entire idyllic town built up around him in order to use his unique ability to predict where an alien attack will strike. He eventually begins to notice some peculiarities in his world, and entire fake reality construct crumbles away, whereas The Truman Show is about a man who has spent his entire life in an idyllic town, which in actuality is a movie set. Though never realizing this, he eventually begins to notice some peculiarities in his world, and eventually his entire fake reality construct crumbles away. Similar? You be the judge, but if I were an heir to the Philip K.
