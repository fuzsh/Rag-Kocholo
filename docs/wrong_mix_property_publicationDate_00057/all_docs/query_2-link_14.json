        "text": "When Blade Runner 2049 opens in UK cinemas this Friday, many fans will be expecting an answer to the tantalising question posed by the original 1982 film: is the LAPD's finest android hunter Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) secretly a robotic replicant himself?\n\nIt's a question that divided not only fans, but even the original film's creators. Ford has repeatedly insisted that Deckard is a regular human being; Blade Runner director Ridley Scott is adamant he's an android; screenwriter Hampton Fancher would prefer to leave viewers guessing.\n\nSo, is he a robot or isn't he? The answer depends on which Blade Runner you watch. Each cut of the film appears to tell a different story – and Blade Runner has been through no fewer than seven different versions. Meanwhile, Fancher's script was heavily rewritten by another writer, David Peoples – and neither of them wrote the voice-over dialogue that was used for the original release.\n\nAmongst all the in-fighting and endless edits, there are a few hints that seem to swing the balance one way or another. Here's the most compelling evidence on both sides:\n\nThe unicorn\n\nIt has been interpreted as a nod to one of the most memorable scenes, a day-dream sequence in which Deckard sees a unicorn running through a forest. If Deckard is a replicant, Gaff would have been able to access his dreams and memories, and the origami figure could be his way of hinting that he knows about Deckard's true nature.\n\nTo anyone who only saw Blade Runner on its original cinema release, this might come as a shock. The dream sequence was only shown as part of the film from 1992 onwards, appearing briefly in that year's Director's Cut, and in a longer version for 2007's The Final Cut. (Scott has since said he wanted it in the original theatrical release, but was overruled.)\n\nIt's not the only hint from Gaff, either. In the 1992 version – but, oddly, not in the 2007 cut – Gaff asks Deckard in a taunting tone of voice, \"Are you sure you are a man?\"\n\nThe four-year life-expectancy\n\nThe presence of an older, grizzled Ford on the sequel's poster might be enough to prove his humanity – it was a cast-iron rule of the original film that the even the latest model of replicant (the Nexus 6) could only last for four years. Blade Runner was set in 21019; if Deckard is still around and kicking 30 years on, he surely must be human.\n\nThe scene shows Deckard and Rachael driving through a beautiful landscape – far from the film's overcrowded vision of LA – while a saxophone purrs smooth jazz on the soundtrack.\n\nIn a voiceover, Deckard says: \"Four years, he figured – he was wrong. Tyrell had told me Rachel was special: no termination date. I didn't know how long we'd have together. Who does?\"\n\nThere's something eerily off about the whole sequence (and not just those aerial shots, which were actually unused footage from The Shining). But it raises an interesting question: if Tyrell could create one robot with \"no termination date\", why not create more?\n\nThe sixth replicant\n\nPolice captain Harry Bryant (M Emmet Walsh) tells Deckard that six replicants escaped their off-world colony. We see Deckard hunt down four of them, and in the original version of the film he explains that one of them was \"fried\" while trying to break into the Tyrell lab. So who's the sixth? Could it be Deckard himself?\n\nDisappointingly, this was a case of poor arithmetic rather than fiendishly clever plotting. Fanchard's original script was meant to include another replicant, a maternal character called Mary, but she was written out of the movie in pre-production – and none of the editors noticed the numbers no longer added up. In his Final Cut, Scott overdubbed Bryant's line (\"Two of them got fried...\").\n\nDick vs Ford vs Scott vs Fancher: who said what?\n\nIn Philip K Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, on which the film is based, Deckard successfully passes the Voight-Kampf test (which uses a series of questions designed to catch out androids). For Dick, it was an open-and-shut case. But in the film, when Deckard's replicant lover Rachael (M Sean Young) asks if he had taken the test, he does not reply.\n\nFord wasn't happy about the ambiguity. \"That was the main area of contention between Ridley and myself at the time,\" he said in a 2001 interview with BBC One's Hollywood Greats. \"I thought the audience deserved one human being on the screen that they could establish an emotional relationship with. I thought I had won Ridley's agreement to that, but in fact I think he had a little reservation about that. I think he really wanted to have it both ways.\"\n\nFord might have mixed feelings about it, but that's only one man's opinion. Speaking at Comic Con this July, the actor said his interpretation didn't count for much: \"It doesn't matter what I think.\"\n\nIn a Channel 4 documentary called On the Edge of Blade Runner (2000), Scott didn't beat about the bush. \"He's a replicant,\" he said. For some fans, that's a clear-cut answer, straight from the unicorn's mouth. Others might wonder whether Scott really had that in mind back in 1982, or whether it's an interpretation he only came up with years later. Speaking to Wired magazine in 2007, the director claimed it was decided from the beginning. When his interviewer suggested it \"was never on paper that Deckard is a replicant\", Scott disagreed.\n\n\"It was, actually,\" Scott said. \"That's the whole point of Gaff [...] He doesn't like Deckard, and we don't really know why. If you take for granted for a moment that, let's say, Deckard is a Nexus 7, he probably has an unknown life span and therefore is starting to get awfully human.\"\n\nBut should we take it for granted? In a 1999 interview, Fancher was asked directly whether Deckard was meant to be an android. \"No,\" he replied, before adding that had toyed with the idea in a later draft – and revealing the details of a never-filmed ending which would have confirmed it.\n\n\"It wasn't like I had a tricky idea about Deckard that way. Until the last draft,\" he said. \"It kept ending in different ways. We were already in pre-production when I wrote the last draft. In the last draft, which wasn't in the movie, I finally came to the last and best conclusion about the ending of the movie which was that Rachel is going to die.\n\n\"And they're in love, and he's become kind of human through this. He was less human than the people he was after, because they were machines. He was more of a machine. And he becomes less of a machine through the ordeal of falling in love with her. She's smarter than he is and she's better than he is, and at the end, he kills her. And it's not an outright execution. It's elliptical. But you hear the shot, and you see where it took place, and you saw her face, and she wanted it, and it was an act of love.\"\n\nFancher continued: \"He's sitting at the piano again, like she sat at the piano, surrounded by his photographs, his memories. And he starts to say something about 'she understood', or something, that he didn't get. And he starts to play [...] and it freeze-frames on his hand. And his hand doesn't quite hit the keys, but the music does begin, and we see his hand over the end credits, and it looks like Batty's hand because it froze in that clawlike thing,\" he continued, referring to a scene in which the leader of the replicant rebels Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) drives a nail into his own hand, breaking it. \"So you say, 'Wait a minute, is he a Nexus Six?'\""
