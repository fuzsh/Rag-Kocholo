        "text": "Rachel is dying, subject to the same four-year lifespan as her replicant brethren. Deckard keeps her in a stasis capsule, waking her up only one day a year (her birthday, IIRC). By the end of the novel, Rachel is dead - her capsule had been shut down while Deckard was away, killing her. The novel ends with Deckard and Sarah Tyrell - heiress to Tyrell Corp and the human template for Rachel - assuming new identities and leaving earth for the off-world colonies. Tyrell HQ is bombed to the ground by the UN in an attempt to kill Sarah and wipe the corporation out.\n\nThe second sequel novel deals with Deckard on an orbital city making a film about his adventures - in effect, an in-universe version of the Blade Runner film; Sarah Tyrell has her own adventures as she spirals into insanity. The third novel features neither Deckard nor Sarah prominently; it's about a bounty hunter hired to find Tyrell's owl."
