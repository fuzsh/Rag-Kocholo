        "text": "Denis Villeneuve’s “Blade Runner 2049” is an extreme technical achievement. With stunning cinematography provided by Roger Deakins, we revisit the world Ridley Scott built with 1982’s “Blade Runner.” Beyond the visual elements, Villeneuve brings audiences back to the central theme of Scott’s film: humanity or what it means to be human. The nucleus of each film’s moving, neon enshrined cell, ‘2049’ pushes the conceptual idea of soul searching to a very literal level. With an ensemble of characters representing different modes of humanity, Villeneuve has created a sequel that has its own identity while imbuing a familiarity with the first “Blade Runner” in its thematic exploration.\n\nREAD MORE: The 100 Most Anticipated Films Of 2018\n\nIn a video essay by Jack’s Movie Reviews, the evolution of humanity from “Blade Runner” to “Blade Runner 2049,” is explored through the dissection of main characters. From the very first scene of the film, the central questions of what does it mean to be human, and later, what does it mean to have humanity, are investigated in K’s interaction with Sapper. Upon witnessing a miracle (a Replicant give birth), Sapper changes his programming to living a simpler life. It is the humble nature of his life which he continues to live out, understanding there are more to Replicants than the programming they are given.\n\nThis leads K through his journey of piecing together his manufactured memories to understand his own humanity. The characters surrounding K (Joi, Luv, Wallis, and Deckard) each bear their connection to the broader theme, representing different means of humanity, their human nature, or their soul. The video essay skillfully breaks down each character, detailing Joi’s relationship with K pushing him further to a certain truth, Wallis’s inability to recognize the importance of detail, Luv’s fear of being less than special, and Deckard’s humanity by way of sacrifice, add to the overarching commentary. K is created and conceived to be programmed for retiring Replicants. He is made with no appreciation for life, with life having little appreciation for him. Like its predecessor, “Blade Runner 2049” is not just a technical achievement. The film offers deep, insightful reflection on our own humanity."
