        "text": "The news that Ridley Scott was making a sequel to Blade Runner, his landmark 1982 science fiction noir, drew a mixed response when it was announced in 2011. Aficionados were, however, mollified by the appointment of original writer Hampton Fancher to take on script duties for the follow-up: they may now be less excited by the news that the latter's screenplay is set to get a rejig from Michael Green, the writer of critically-panned comic book movies Fantastic Four and The Green Lantern.\n\nGreen has also worked on a screenplay for a film based on superhero The Flash, as well as scripts for Steven Spielberg's Robopocalypse and Moses projects, all of which have yet to see the light of day. Fancher's screenplay was set several years after the events of the original, which starred Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer. Producers denied last year that Ford, who recently suggested he would return to the Star Wars series, was in talks to reprise his role as android hunter Rick Deckard."
