        "text": "A trail of Reese’s Pieces. The decapitation of a giant snake. The noble face of Mr. Spock, his skin peeling off like bark from a tree. Police cars that hover above the streets. Skeletons in a swimming pool. Blood in a petri dish, which squeaks and leaps if you touch it with a hot wire. One guy who is sent into virtual existence by the zap of a laser. Another guy who eats dog food from a can. These foolish things remind me of 1982.\n\nOther people, with higher minds, will recall the hefty happenings of that year. Israel invaded Lebanon. Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands. Yuri Andropov succeeded Leonid Brezhnev as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. One barrel of laughs after another. Unaccountably, events of such magnitude hold no appeal for the author Chris Nashawaty, despite the fact that his new book, “The Future Was Now” (Flatiron), is devoted to 1982. He doesn’t even mention that the Man of the Year, as decreed by Time, was “The Computer,” although that shift of emphasis is germane to his task. His focus is on movies—specifically, on eight movies that came out in the summer of 1982, and the stuff of which they were made. And what stuff it was! The “five-gallon buckets of K-Y jelly” that were, Nashawaty informs us, required to lubricate the special effects in John Carpenter’s “The Thing.” Or the pink silk pants that were sported by the actor Rutger Hauer, together with “a fox fur draped over his shoulder,” when he went to meet Ridley Scott, the director of “Blade Runner.” History isn’t all power grabs. It can be a bundle of details that you stroke.\n\n“Blade Runner” and “The Thing,” both of which came out on June 25, 1982, tripped and stumbled at the box office, yet they are two of the more enduring films in Nashawaty’s octet. The others are “Conan the Barbarian,” directed by John Milius, co-written by Milius and Oliver Stone, and bestridden by Arnold Schwarzenegger; Steven Lisberger’s “Tron,” which laid down a glowing path for Disney; George Miller’s “The Road Warrior,” otherwise known as “Mad Max 2”; Nicholas Meyer’s “Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,” the mission of which was to redeem the low-energy impact of the first “Star Trek” movie; “Poltergeist,” notionally directed by Tobe Hooper, although the hand of Steven Spielberg, credited as a producer and a co-writer, was firmly discernible on the tiller; and a nice little flick called “E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,” which raked in almost eight hundred million dollars around the planet. That was directed by Spielberg, in a big way.\n\nWhat We’re Reading\n\nDiscover notable new fiction and nonfiction.\n\nSo, what is it with this fateful eight? Well, Nashawaty has a solemn case to make. He writes:\n\nDuring the eight weeks spanning between May 16 and July 9, Hollywood’s major studios would release eight sci-fi/fantasy films that would not only go on to become cornerstones in the pop culture canon four-plus decades on, they would also radically transform the way that the movie industry did—and continues to do—business, paving the way for our current all-blockbusters-all-the-time era.\n\nThat is quite a claim. Nashawaty is by no means sure that he likes the result—“what should have been a new golden age of sci-fi and fantasy cinema became a pop-culture beast that would devour itself to death and infantilize its audience”—but he proposes that, for most of us, going to the cinema is now “one endless summer,” which is much less sunny than it sounds. Like it or not, we live in a Conanistic world.\n\nWhether or not you buy into this notion of 1982 as a red-letter year, it’s worth asking when the redness first began to dawn. Does Nashawaty, in his soothsaying capacity, even have the right decade? Note the elaborate tribute that he pays not only to Spielberg’s “Jaws” and George Lucas’s “Star Wars”—the first released in May, 1975, the second in June, 1977—but also to another summer hit, Scott’s “Alien,” from 1979, which seemed like a suppurating antidote to the antisepsis of “Star Wars.” (I still don’t comprehend how you can love both of those movies equally. You make your choice, and you stick to it.) Clamp the three together, top them with “Raiders of the Lost Ark” (1981), which bore the imprint of Lucas and Spielberg, and there, I suggest, you have the precursor of 1982, and a more compelling template for so much that has blazed and crawled across our screens ever since.\n\nViewed from that perspective, what the filmmakers were doing, when they created the eight works that are covered in “The Future Was Now,” was not crunching through barriers or setting fresh trends. They were cashing in. This is not a lowly skill, or an easy one; indeed, in some respects, it is the raison d’être of the movie trade. But let’s not pretend that Hooper, Lisberger, Meyer, and the rest of the guys were a movement, conjoined by a common iconoclastic purpose. The club of 1982 has nothing on the gang of a decade earlier, or more: Martin Scorsese, Paul Schrader, Warren Beatty, Bob Rafelson, Peter Bogdanovich, and the others cited by Peter Biskind in his headlong study of the period, “Easy Riders, Raging Bulls.” Similarly, I doubt that the director of “Tron” reached out to the director of “The Wrath of Khan” in the way that, say, Monet reached out to Pissarro in April, 1873, explaining that “everyone finds this good, only Manet is against.” By “everyone,” he meant Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Degas, and Morisot, and by “this” he meant the inaugural show of what would come to be known, initially with disdain, as Impressionism. The future really was now, for those painters, and they could spy it and catch it, en plein air.\n\nMuch of “The Future Was Now” is strewn with nuts and bolts—with the amusing practical agonies of arriving at a workable screenplay, and the no less arduous grind of bringing the damn thing to life. The evolution of movie titles, for example, is an object lesson in near-misses. Scott went through “Android,” “Mechanismo,” and the blunted dullness of “Dangerous Days” before landing on the lethal edge of “Blade Runner.” I knew that “E.T.” was known as “E.T. and Me,” and before that as “Night Skies,” and before that as “Watch the Skies,” which had also been mooted as a title for “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” (1977). What I didn’t realize, until I read “The Future Was Now,” is that the earliest script for “E.T.,” written by John Sayles, featured five alien visitors, one of whom, Scar, mutilated cattle. According to Nashawaty, Scar “could kill animals with one touch of his long, bony finger.” Guided by Spielberg, the same digit would reach out, light up, and touch the brow of Elliott, the young human hero, in a climactic blessing.\n\nLikewise, the rigmarole of casting, recounted in hindsight, becomes a fusillade of dodged bullets. As often as not, the right actor hits the right role through a mixture of availability, affordability, and luck, but we can still be aghast at what might have gone wrong. Take Deckard (Harrison Ford), the protagonist of “Blade Runner,” whose job is to hunt down replicants: synthetic people, barely distinguishable from the rest of us. Nashawaty reports that not only were Tommy Lee Jones, Nick Nolte, Martin Sheen, and Peter Falk—all of whom might, I guess, have rivalled Ford in the requisite dogged gruffness—considered for the part but so were Al Pacino, Burt Reynolds, and, wait for it, Dustin Hoffman. For more than forty years, a debate has rumbled over whether Deckard himself is a replicant; with Hoffman, there would have been no doubt. (Imagine the audition: “I make the best replicant. Nobody does humanoid like I do.”) To be fair, it’s hard to picture Ford in a full-length sequinned scarlet dress, as worn by Hoffman in “Tootsie,” released in time for Christmas that same year.\n\n“Tootsie” matters because it feels like a farewell—Hollywood saying goodbye, with a satisfying snap, to a finely tooled comic style that had flourished, pretty much, from the maturing of the talkies to the early nineteen-sixties. Today’s audiences are offered no such treats, and we suffer from that gloomy deficit. Even though “Tootsie” wound up earning almost a hundred and eighty million dollars, more than any other 1982 movie aside from “E.T.,” it warrants only two fleeting nods in “The Future Was Now,” because of the fondness with which the film glances back to the past. It therefore has no place in the thesis that sustains the book. One could, studying the financial returns for the year, point out that “Porky’s” (infinitely coarser fare than “Tootsie,” but nonetheless built for laughs) made more money than both “The Wrath of Khan” and “Poltergeist,” but Nashawaty ignores the farcical for the sake of the fantastical. This is not because he lacks a sense of humor—he previously wrote a whole book, if you please, on “Caddyshack,” the goofball golfing film, from 1980—but because his antennas are tuned to the prophetic.\n\nThat is why he concentrates on Spielberg, who comes across as Hollywood’s prime fortune-teller, and also as the one person who could arrange those fortunes to his liking. He dreamed up what we wanted to watch. It’s amazing to observe the wit and the sheer industry with which one project was hurled onto the heels of another. In Nashawaty’s account, much of “E.T.” was hatched by Spielberg “on his downtime on the set of ‘Raiders.’ ” (What downtime?) It was there that he handed over writing duties on “E.T.” to Melissa Mathison. For his next trick, he doubled up. “Even though Spielberg was also working on ‘E.T.’ at the time,” Nashawaty writes, “he would be present on the set of ‘Poltergeist’ all but three days of the film’s twelve-week shoot.” The blend of the two movies would answer to his emotional constitution. “ ‘Poltergeist’ is what I fear and ‘E.T.’ is what I love,” Spielberg said. “One is about suburban evil, and the other is about suburban good.”\n\nBut which is which? The answer seems obvious, but look closely at the early scenes of both films and you find that “E.T.” smarts with the misery of divorce, whereas “Poltergeist” is about a happy family. There’s a relaxing scene in the bedroom of the main couple, where the mother rolls a joint, giggling, and the father reads a copy of “Reagan the Man, the President.” Is there a more precise snapshot of the nineteen-eighties? Like “E.T.,” in short, “Poltergeist” is formidably well rooted in the grounds of the ordinary; unseen spirits enter the property via a TV screen (the umbilical cord of America) and, in puckish jest, stack chairs atop the kitchen table. A haunted book flies around and flaps its covers like a butterfly’s wings. Does all of this count as sci-fi and fantasy, the genres to which Nashawaty attends? “Poltergeist” lurches into horror, whereas “E.T.” blooms into a fairy tale; neither shares more than an inch of territory with “The Wrath of Khan” or “Tron.” Spielberg is a terrestrial, through and through, nowhere more so than in his fantasies. Think of Elliott, introducing his friends to the alien, who needs to go home. “Can’t he just beam up?” one of them asks. Elliott’s reply is not correct, in any empirical sense, but it’s true to the pulsing heart of the story: “This is reality, Greg.”\n\nBeaming up, needless to say, is the prerogative of “Star Trek,” and Elliott’s words belong to the perennial battle between opposing schools of sci-fi: on one side, spotless warriors armed with phasers, lasers, and lightsabres; on the other, mortals who are mired in the grunge of the everyday, even when, as in “Alien,” they are afloat in space. (Maybe that’s why Vincent Canby, in the Times, referred to “Alien” as “an extremely small, rather decent movie of its modest kind.” He sounds like a real-estate agent talking up a cramped apartment in Queens.) In 1982, “The Wrath of Khan” was hailed as a glorious vote of confidence in the “Star Trek” saga. These days, it looks silly and shrunken, enlivened largely by the unblushing performance of Ricardo Montalbán as the villain. He leads a band of renegades that had long been thought lost. “It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that allowed us to survive,” he explains, keeping a majestically straight face under the wig of a superannuated rock god. My favorite passage in “The Future Was Now” concerns Barry Diller, the head of Paramount, who inveighs against the movie’s title. “Nobody knows what the word wrath is,” he cries, wrathfully. Try telling that to John Steinbeck. If Diller had his way, we’d all be reading “The Grapes of Being Totally Pissed.”\n\nFor anyone who delights in the perpetration of human error, be it of judgment, taste, or commercial savvy, Nashawaty offers a wealth of historical evidence. I was particularly impressed by the marketing department at Columbia Pictures, which asserted, on reflection, that “E.T.” would have “limited audience appeal.” (Spielberg took the film to Universal.) As for the style in which “The Future Was Now” is couched, I would describe it as Most-Impressionist. Only with reluctance is anything permitted to be moderate or middling; whenever possible, every aspect of the narrative must be inflated to the max. On the first page, musing on “Blade Runner” and “The Thing,” Nashawaty writes, “One had been adapted from an intellectually dense novel written by one of the most prolific and celebrated minds the genre ever produced; the other a reinterpretation of one of the most chillingly metaphorical movies of the black-and-white era.” He adds that “Conan the Barbarian” is “the most Milius film Milius had ever made.” It doesn’t get moster than that.\n\nSuch is Nashawaty’s command of superlatives that he merits a sci-fi yarn of his own. “The Optimizer,” perhaps. Or “The Hyphenator.” Thus, “Star Wars” is lauded as “a true once-in-a-generation pop-culture juggernaut,” while the triumph of “The Wrath of Khan” was to turn “a cash-grab sequel into a franchise-resuscitating classic.” Far from scorning this excitable tic, I find it both judicious and contagious; the book’s parsing of “Halloween” as “a babysitter-in-peril slashterpiece” is hard to quibble with, and I wonder what other paragons of the medium would profit from so crisp a paraphrase. Ingmar Bergman’s “Cries and Whispers”? A crimson-tinged, don’t-hold-back Scandi cancerthon. Carl Theodor Dreyer’s “The Passion of Joan of Arc”? A chat-free high-stakes teen roast. Once you slip into the habit, you can’t stop.\n\nMind you, Nashawaty has neither the time nor the inclination to trespass into the art house. Not for him the lapping lure of the Venice Film Festival, where, in 1982, the Golden Lion was awarded to Wim Wenders’s “The State of Things”—the sorry chronicle of a film crew marooned in Portugal and running low on funds. And what are they meant to be making? A science-fiction movie. Funny, that. Maybe there was something in the air, or in the wider cultural skies, that drifted almost imperceptibly into the popular arts. If any book deserves to be read in tandem with “The Future Was Now,” it is “Way Out There in the Blue: Reagan, Star Wars and the End of the Cold War,” by Frances FitzGerald, published in 2000. FitzGerald is as densely comprehensive as Nashawaty is breezy, and her opening chapter examines the heavenward outlook that encouraged Ronald Reagan to back the Strategic Defense Initiative, a system that had no hope of succeeding and could therefore never fail. Interestingly, the President was unimpressed by the proposal’s “Star Wars” tag, though Richard Perle, his Assistant Secretary of Defense, was all for it. “Why not?” Perle asked. “It’s a good movie. Besides, the good guys win.”\n\nThere is no disgrace in veering away from politics, however, and, to Nashawaty’s credit, his book is more privately provocative, obliging its readers to be honest with themselves. It bids them recall their youthful moviegoing—in 1962, 1982, 2022, or whenever—and ask, “How did I consume films back then? Did they wash over me in a wave, one Saturday night after another, or was I suckered into a deep dive, watching a single film over and over? And if there was some generic rush, for fantasy or comedy, did I even notice it? Isn’t that sort of stuff best left to accountants and reviewers and other dopes?” By its nature, movie criticism pays too little heed to the sensory conditions (the snack, the blues, the balcony smooch) under which we see a motion picture, although these are guaranteed to skew our vision at the time and to seep into our memory, too. In our salad days, we are ripe for a particular movie that will linger, deathlessly, long after the greenness has gone. When a friend turned to me after the first twenty minutes of “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” in 1986, and calmly declared, “This is the best film ever made,” I had no cause to disagree.\n\nMany people, I suspect, will associate 1982 with Amy Heckerling’s “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” especially if they were of the same age as the characters and under attack from the same cavalry charge of hormones. I was more drawn to Barry Levinson’s “Diner,” which was so well written that you barely noticed it was written at all. (And that cast! Who didn’t lean toward the screen, like a secret conspirator, to catch what Mickey Rourke was saying?) Another movie to which I kept circling back was “48 Hrs.,” tautly directed by Walter Hill. Eddie Murphy, making his dramatic début, as a convict on temporary release, was paired with Nick Nolte as a detective. What a duo: joker and curmudgeon, greyhound and mastiff, Black and white. It set a pattern that would be copied, though never bettered, by other buddy-cop spiels, like the “Lethal Weapon” series, and the sight of Murphy, in an expensive suit, vaulting over a barrier in a subway chase conveyed a physical whippiness to go with the lash of his quick tongue. Around the corner lay “Beverly Hills Cop,” “Coming to America,” and the enthronement of a star.\n\nIn the realms of sci-fi, “Tron” left me chilled and bored, though it was delicious to behold David Warner, who had once played Hamlet for the Royal Shakespeare Company, now being sucked into a computer game, wearing a Day-Glo helmet and armor and grimly announcing, “I do the thinking around here.” I was too stupid to peer ahead—or, as Nashawaty splendidly puts it, “to read the tea leaves of the zeitgeist”—and thus to conceive where such digital chicanery might go next, and how it might, against all odds, lead not to dead ends but to the accommodation of living sentiment. In the opinion of John Lasseter, formerly the chief creative officer at Pixar, “Without ‘Tron,’ there would be no ‘Toy Story.’ ” Blessed are the children whose eyes were opened by “Toy Story.” It may be indebted to “Tron,” yet it radiates a thousand times the warmth.\n\nTo an extent, what “The Future Was Now” delivers is a basic boost to the auteur theory. Of the eight films that Nashawaty inspects, the ones that hold up most robustly are those which bear the mark of Spielberg, Carpenter, Miller, and Scott. By some strange and unteachable paradox, their handling of action, however kinetic, leaves a residue of rumination. To my lasting regret, I couldn’t catch a double bill of “Blade Runner” and “The Thing” on June 25, 1982, but I saw them soon enough, and, entwined in my mind, they presented a bewildering case of osmosis: the inhuman leaching into the human, and vice versa. Scott gave us replicants, none more daunting than Rutger Hauer’s Roy Batty, the Übermensch who earns our compassionate awe as his powers expire. His celebrated speech at the finale, redrafted by Hauer himself—“I’ve seen things you people wouldn’t believe”—is the most trenchant argument ever mounted against the potency of the image. Sometimes don’t show. Just tell.\n\nCarpenter swung in the other direction. In “The Thing,” bickering scientists in the Arctic are menaced by an alien, which has no essential form of its own; like the ultimate Method actor, it borrows the shape of whomever, or whatever, it infests. At the time, the monster’s deeds were derided as disgusting, and that condemnation may have sealed the movie’s fate. From a distance, Carpenter’s rabid exercise in metamorphosis (a ginger-bearded fellow with huge red claws; legs that sprout from the maw of a sundered head, allowing it to scuttle off like a spider) stretches not forward but backward, to the age of Hieronymus Bosch. There were rumors of actors quizzing one another, off set, about the implications of such morphing: Do you know that you’re the Thing, once it resembles you to the last pore? Or does its furtive genius equip it to convince you that you are, in fact, still you?\n\nPuzzles of this type are exactly what we seek from science fiction—and have sought since the robot-to-woman transmutation of Fritz Lang’s “Metropolis,” in 1927. In what sense, then, did “The Thing,” and the other members of Nashawaty’s lineup, “completely shift an outdated Hollywood paradigm,” as he contends? The solution, I guess, lies not in the philosophy of identity but in the mysteries of P.R., and in the addictive properties of sequels. “The Wrath of Khan” and “The Road Warrior” were sequels to start with, and the dystopian verve of the latter—which, with its rusty clutch of improvised vehicles, felt like a trip into the unconscious of a demented blacksmith—has grown wilder with every subsequent installment. The most recent, “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” came out in May. We have also had follow-ups to “Blade Runner” and “Tron,” whether we desired them or not. Someone, maybe Nashawaty, should write a history of sequels, delving into our fundamental thirst for more of the same. It is a craving that runs deeper than capitalist gratification. (All the way back to the baby at the breast, a Freudian might say.) As we flock to “Deadpool & Wolverine,” this summer, we will be propelled by our weakness for violent tutorials in cocky self-awareness, plus an absurdly unadventurous taste for further adventure. What could be more conservative than to demand repetition of the radical?\n\nThere is one figure who looms larger than any other (outdoing even Spielberg) in “The Future Was Now,” and whose domination is portended without a quiver of doubt. Not once, we are assured, did Arnold Schwarzenegger make trouble on the set of “Conan the Barbarian,” despite the indignities that were heaped upon him. He was crucified athwart something called the Tree of Woe, where he had to bite into the neck of a vulture—a prop, but, as Nashawaty says, “still stuffed with real vulture guts.” Yummy. According to Schwarzenegger, the dogs that harried him across a rocky scrubland, avid for the raw meat that had been placed inside his clothing, “had some wolf in them.” Er, how much wolf? None of this perturbed Schwarzenegger, who was a famously quick study, almost lupine in his famished eagerness to learn, trading weight-lifting tips with his distinguished co-star James Earl Jones in return for actorly advice.\n\nIt worked. Did Schwarzenegger, as I like to think, survey the sequences in “Conan the Barbarian” during which he runs along at a sensible jog, and grasp how ordinary and unsinister he seems at that pace? Could that be why he switched to the slow tread that we witness, only two years later, in “The Terminator”—the most implacable gait since that of Boris Karloff? No need to run when you are secure in the bringing of doom. Better yet, though briefer, is the moment at which Conan’s gaze, in closeup, slides questingly from side to side, scouting his terrain and planning his next move. As though by instinct, he is already Terminating. A lot of money was made and lost at the movies in 1982, and lagoons of tears were shed for E.T., but it was also a year that demonstrated, in case we needed reminding, that actors, too, can be auteurs. For Schwarzenegger, the future was his. He’d be back. ♦"
