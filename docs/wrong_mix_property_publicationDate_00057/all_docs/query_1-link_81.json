        "text": "Welcome to KippleZone\n\n~ a \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" & \"Blade Runner\" fanfiction e-zine. ~\n\nBlade Runner is one of the most popular and influential science-fiction films of all time, and it has become an enduring cult classic favorite. It was directed by Ridley Scott and stars Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, and Sean Young. The screenplay, written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, is loosely based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? [DADoES] by Philip K. Dick.\n\nThis 1982 film depicts a dystopian Los Angeles in the year 2019–-a dark, polluted and overcrowded city dominated by cloud-piercing buildings, looming neon billboards, and air dense with acid rain and flying traffic. And the city has another problem; rogue Replicants.\n\nReplicants are human androids that are created to perform hazardous or menial tasks on the Off-world Colonies. Their use is prohibited here on Earth. If anyone is suspected of being a Replicant, a special police force, known as the Blade Runner Unit, are notified. The blade runners have orders to shoot to kill, upon detection, any trespassing Replicant.\n\nThe plot focuses on the trials and tribulations of retired Rep-detect, Rick Deckard. He is forced back into active duty to help L.A.P.D.’s Blade Runner Unit out of a jam. He has to track down four rogue Replicants and retire them–a euphemism for destroying them.\n\nBlade Runner debuted on June 25, 1982, in over 1200 theatres, throughout the United States. However, it had not lived up to box office expectations. It could be said that Blade Runner was the most influential box-office-flop-turned-cult-classic film of all time.\n\nBlade Runner is more than a movie. Not only does Blade Runner overwhelm the senses, but it also preys on our morals. It reveals fundamental truths and insight into human nature.\n\nBlade Runner opens up a multiverse of perspectives for those who seek them. The further we journey through its sectors, the more there is to marvel at and amaze us. From the book, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick; the various screenplays; the different versions of the movie Blade Runner; to the many offspring this work has spawned, we continue to keep alive this story. It has been analyzed, replicated, expanded upon, and been paid tribute to by all means known to humankind.\n\nWe can see its influence in other books and movies. It has been rendered in the visual arts; in painting, sculpting, computer animation, architectural designs and even in fashion design. We can experience Blade Runner virtually with video games. We can listen to Blade Runner inspired music. This paradigm has been presented in live theatre productions, in dance recitals, and on home video productions. Writers across the web have kept the story of Rick Deckard and company alive in fan-fiction. In a sense, Blade Runner has been mythologicalized. This website is for the Blade Runner enthusiast, the writer, the artist, the dreamer, and the mythmaker.\n\nHere you will find poems, scripts, stories, and art related to and inspired by Blade Runner and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?."
