        "text": "http://movies.ign.com/articles/118/1188867p1.html\n\nAnnounced today, to be directed by Ridley Scott. I was excited enough already for Prometheus, the upcoming Alien prequel starring Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender, a new Blade Runner heralds in a new era of excitement in the sci-fi genre. The original is, at the moment, my favorite film and I know I've seen at least one other Blade Runner related signature on the forum. Although I believe it is very possible that this could go horribly wrong, I'd love to see a neon-coated dystopic LA aided by the huge leaps in technology we've made since the original film's release. It's supposedly going to be all fresh faces, leaving Ford out of the equation. I have faith in Scott, and am looking forward to the assembly of a colorful and virtuosic cast. Of course, I'd love to hear your thoughts as well.\n\nOh god......I am so conflicted right now. With the exception of Ghostbusters 2(which was just ok) every sequel/prequel to something I have loved has fucked me in the ass.\n\nAlso, I was watching the making of documentary of Blade Runner 'Dangerous Days' only the other week. Ridley Scott was saying about how the sets were made from plastic tubing and hardboard and shit. They showed pictures of it in daylight, and frankly it did look pretty terrible, but shot at night with the rain and steam everywhere it looked amazing, and still does after all these years.\n\nAlso by all accounts the making of Blade Runner was a pretty painful process, lots of fallings out and infighting, countless script rewrites, an actors strike. Ridley Scott pushing everyone to the point of psychosis with his perfectionism.\n\nAnd even then, it got fucked about with the studio imposing a Happy Ending and that awful voice over they made Harrison Ford do.\n\nSo I suppose what I am saying is, even though it was a troublesome birth everything was in alignment and eventually a masterpiece was created. I just can't see justice being done here.\n\nEven if it isnt revisiting the same characters, how will they maintain the same feel as the original? If they use CGI its only going to look shit in a few years anyway, films these days like to treat the future like a fucking car advert where everything is clean and shiny. LA in 2019 is dirty and humid and seedy.\n\nIts like the difference between the slums in FFVII (unique and richly detailed even though they were only pre rendered backdrops) and the slums in CC (generic piles of grey rubble despite more advanced graphics being available)\n\nIm also excited about Prometheus, Noomi Rapace sounds ideal because shes not some typical Hollywood bimbo, the original Alien had ordinary looking people doing an ordinary job (for 2122!) and it made everything feel so much more realistic and therefore scarier. Charlize Theron has been confirmed too and while she can look 'hollywood' beautiful she has also proved that she has the acting chops (Monster) so hopefully she wont spend the entire time coated in lipgloss.\n\nI swear if Angelina Jolie had been cast I would have started posting turds.\n\nAnyway I am less concerned about Prometheus because they have said that its set way before Alien and isn't really a prequel prequel as there wont be any Xenomorphs in it, although my fingers are crossed for the Space Jockey\n\n/fever induced rambling\n\nI've committed a crime against humanity by not having seen the original Blade Runner yet (or whatever of its many versions is the best to see). Its the one movie I should see out of all movies in existence. I can't think of any other movie I haven't seen that seems to have that 'must see' aura about it, due to its position as some sort of cult movie classic that all sci-fis of its kind are judged by.\n\nHaving said that, if the original isn't over-rated, and is as good as I imagine it in my head, then if this movie isn't better, it instantly fails. Therefore it instantly fails. I suspect its a movie that doesn't need a continuation or remake. Am I right?\n\nI've committed a crime against humanity by not having seen the original Blade Runner yet (or whatever of its many versions is the best to see).\n\nFor shame!\n\nThe best version by most peoples standards is the directors cut....I'm not even sure if you can get the old theatrical cut any more, at least not easily.\n\nI suspect its a movie that doesn't need a continuation or remake. Am I right?\n\nIt certainly doesnt need a remake, and a continuation would only work if it was following the theatrical cut, which would suck balls.\n\nAnyway you should enjoy it, as you don't seem to be the kind of person to complain about the omissions of car chases or a pumping techno soundtrack or gratuitous nudity. Just remember it was made in 1982 (like me )\n\nhttp://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/11/04/ridley-scott-says-he’ll-direct-‘blade-runner’-sequel/\n\nFilm director Ridley Scott plans to film a follow-up to his groundbreaking 1982 film, &#8220;Blade Runner.&#8221;\n\nIn an interview, Scott said he is on board to direct a &#8220;Blade Runner&#8221; follow-up and has been interviewing writers who can help him with the screenplay. Scott says the new project is &#8220;liable to be a sequel.&#8221;\n\nScott, 74 years old, recently finished shooting the sci-fi movie &#8220;Prometheus&#8221; and is an executive producer of a new TV series on Discovery Communications Inc.&#8217;s Science Channel, &#8220;Prophets of Science Fiction.&#8221;\n\nEarlier this year, production company Alcon Entertainment said it was planning a new &#8220;Blade Runner&#8221; project with Scott at the helm, but it didn&#8217;t reveal whether it would be a prequel or sequel to the original film.\n\n&#8220;Blade Runner&#8221; devotees may not have to wait long for the new movie. &#8220;I think I&#8217;m close to finding a writer that might be able to help me deliver,&#8221; Scott says, &#8220;we&#8217;re quite a long way in, actually.&#8221;\n\nThe original film was inspired by sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick&#8217;s novel, &#8220;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&#8221; and told the grim story of Rick Deckard, a &#8220;blade runner&#8221; who hunts down &#8220;replicants&#8221; &#8212; androids who long to live free lives. Scott says Dick, who he says was &#8220;stressed&#8221; when he met him, found a romanticism in his pessimism. And similarly, &#8220;Blade Runner&#8221; didn&#8217;t offer a romantic view of the future.\n\n&#8220;That&#8217;s why I think I was so unpopular&#8221; when the film was released, Scott says, because at the core of the film is a story about mortality. &#8220;Even though people think it&#8217;s a cool Philip Marlowe film with Deckard played by Harrison Ford,&#8221; he says, &#8220;the film is very much about humanity.&#8221;\n\nScott says the new &#8220;Blade Runner&#8221; project is moving ahead &#8220;not with the past cast, of course.&#8221; No Deckard? &#8220;No, not really,&#8221; he says.\n\nX"
