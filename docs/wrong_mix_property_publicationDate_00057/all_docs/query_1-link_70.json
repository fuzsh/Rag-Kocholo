        "text": "The US release date for the much anticipated Blade Runner: The Final Cut DVD has been set at 18 December 2007 (I hope the same date will be true for Australia, but I canâ€™t find anything to confirm that yet). There are sets from 2 to 5 discs in size, including the package pictured, which comes in briefcase in the style of one holding the the Voight-Kampff test in the film. It all looks very exciting, and, unlike, say, George Lucasâ€™ Star Wars Special Editions, the Blade Runner sets will contain all the versions of the film, from the 1982 release, the first Directorâ€™s Cut, the new Final Cut and, for those getting the 5-disc pack, a work-print (which Iâ€™ve never seen) which has all sorts of changes that never made it to any cinema screens at any time.\n\nOne of the best parts of this collection will have to be the new â€˜Dangerous Daysâ€™ documentary which seeks to be a â€˜definitiveâ€™ look at the film, but really will just add more to the filmâ€™s ongoing mythology. Yahoo! has a few preview clips up, which include footage showing new interviews with most of the cast and crew, including James Edward Olmos and Harrison Ford. I thought the previous Blade Runner documentary put together by Mark Kermode was pretty good, so Iâ€™m hoping to be dazzled by â€˜Dangerous Daysâ€™ if it has even more to show about the film and its cultural impact.\n\nIâ€™m quite pleased this set is on its way â€“ when I was lecturing earlier this year on Blade Runner I was really starting to think it would be the last time this film would seem relevant to students, but I think this re-release will spark further interest in the film, its peppered production history and the importance of the questions it provokes. Yes, I think Deckard is a replicant in every cut, but Iâ€™d be pleased to hear why you disagree â€¦ or agree! ðŸ™‚ [Via AICN]\n\nFor Harrison Ford fans, you can also check out the Comicon report from Ford, Spielberg and others from the set of Indiana Jones 4!"
