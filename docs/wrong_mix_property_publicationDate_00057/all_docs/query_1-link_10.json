        "text": "Early in the 21st Century, THE TYRELL CORPORATION advanced Robot evolution into the NEXUS phase - a being virtually identical to a human - Known as a Replicant\n\nThe NEXUS 6 Replicants were superior in strength and agility, and at least equal in intelligence, to the genetic engineers who created them.\n\nReplicants were used Off-world as slave labor, in the hazardous exploration and colonization of the other planets.\n\nAfter a bloody mutiny by a NEXUS 6 combat team in an Off-world colony, Replicants were declared illegal on earth - under penalty of death.\n\nSpecial police squads - BLADE RUNNER UNITS - had orders to shoot to kill, upon detection, any trespassing Replicant.\n\nThis was not called execution. It was called retirement.\n\nWhat is \"Blade Runner\"?\n\nBlade Runner is a 1982 movie by Ridley Scott loosely based upon the 1968 book: Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick\n\nAlmost no one uses this phrase when discussing the book on the internet. Instead, they use the acronym DADOES\n\nI am not aware of any book matching the movie story line, so if you want to read the subsequent novels listed below, then you must first watch the movie. That said, all true Blade Runner fans will want to read Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep? just for the context\n\nI need to mention a marketing scam that played out in 1982. Book publishers sold a product titled \"Blade Runner\" with a cover containing pictures from the 1982 movie of the same name, but the material within was \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\". And just in case you are wondering, yes, many of Deckard's neighbors own mechanical animals with one being an electric sheep. Read the book to learn more about the Deckard (a human policeman) and his human wife and how they lived in their apartment\n\ncomment: I \"think\" something has happened to \"my brain\" in the past 30 years. I first read this book at age of 29 but I got way more out of it at age of 59. For some reason I do not understand, portions of this book seem a lot closer to the movie Blade Runner than I previously thought. It is apparent to me now that this book could not be translated directly into a movie because the emphasis on human defectives (chicken-heads and ant-heads), which Dick included to be a literary foil for andys (replicants), would hurt the feelings of too many human movie goers.\n\nLink: DADOES vs. Blade Runner (from a recent re-read in 2011 and again in 2020)\n\nWhat is a \"Blade Runner\"?\n\nIn the 1982 movie of the same name, a Blade Runner is the name of a special cop (bounty hunter) used to locate, then retire, replicants, which are forbidden on Earth.\n\n*** mini-spoiler section ***\n\nThe following excerpts are found on page 186 of:\n\n\"Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human\" by K. W. Jeter\n\npublished by Bantam (c) 1995 by the Philip K. Dick Trust\n\n\"But the truth of the matter is that all the blade runners have always been replicants, from day one. Even before there were any replicants being manufactured in the U.S., back when the industry was located in Stuttgart, and the original developers of the technology — people like Paul Derain, and Sudermann and Grozzi, the ones that Eldon Tyrell eventually ripped off — knew they were dealing with dangerous stuff and they put the first safeguards in place\"\n\n\"From the start,\" Batty went on, \"Those (German) companies had replicants on-line whose sole purpose was to keep other replicants from escaping and trying to pass themselves off as human. That's where the name \"blade runner\" comes from; those enforcement replicants were originally called Bleibruhigers. Bleib ruhig is German for \"stay quiet\" (or stay calm). And that's what they did, they kept everything nice and quiet; most people around the turn of the century weren't even aware that the replicant technology had been developed. Then when Tyrell and the U.N. brought everything over to the States, and the catching of escaped replicants became a police function, that's when Bleibruhiger got Anglicized to blade runner. The term doesn't make sense, otherwise.\"\n\nPlease note that some Blade Runner FAQ's have different explanations for the \"Blade Runner\". Personally, I prefer the explanation given by Jeter since most B.R. fans know that Philip Dick got the idea for Voight-Kampff empathy test after reading the diaries of Nazi guards stored in the special documents library at UCLA.\n\n(a few) Sound Clips\n\nPoliceman: Hey, idi-wa. [Cityspeak-Korean for: \"Come here.\"]\n\nGaff: Monsieur, ada-na kobishin angum bi-te. [Cityspeak-German for: \"Sir. You will be required to accompany me please\"]\n\nSushi Man: He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.\n\nDeckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.\n\nGaff: Lo fa, ne-ko shi-ma de va-ja blade... Blade Runner. [Cityspeak-Hungarian for: \"Horse Dick! So you say. You are the Blade Runner\"]\n\nSushi Master: He say you brade runna.\n\nDeckard: Tell him I'm eating.\n\nThe red text above was taken from P.116 of the book \"Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner\" by Paul M. Simon\n\nRoy Batty: Quite an experience to live in fear isn't it? That's what it is to be a slave.\n\nRoy Batty: I've seen things that you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I've watched C-beams glitter in the dark near Tan Hauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in the rain.\n\nBlade Runner Major Chronology:\n\n1928\n\nPhilip Kindred Dick is born in Chicago, Illinois\n\n1962\n\nPhilip K. Dick's novel The Man in the High Castle is published.\n\nWhile doing research for this book (reading the personal diaries of NAZI SS soldiers stored in the archives of the U. C.

Read: Genes as Technology?\n\nBlade Runner Movie Trivia\n\nDeckard's badge is B26354\n\nDeckard is never seen flying the spinner (except at the end of the 1982 movie release where he is with Rachael). When ever he is behind the wheel, he is always in a ground car.\n\nWhen the spinner is seen leaving the Tyrell building early in the movie, it looks like the ground is covered with trees. Los Angeles isn't the total waste land that we've been lead to believe.\n\nWhen Deckard takes a second glance at the photo of Rachael and her mother, for at least one second it looks like we are watching a movie clip rather than a still. Is this something that Deckard is imagining? Check out some BR FAQ's for more info on this.\n\nTheater Release vs. Director's Cut (only major differences are listed; check some of the FAQ's for minor differences and special sneak preview differences)\n\nTheater Release\n\nHarrison Ford (Deckard) does a narrative throughout the whole thing\n\nthe VHS version is full screen on the TV (the sides have be cropped)\n\nDirector's Cut\n\nno Harrison Ford (Deckard) narrative\n\nmore spinners are seen flying (and passing) when Deckard and Gaff fly to the police station\n\na 12 second dream of a unicorn happens while Deckard sits at the piano\n\nno happy ending flying off with Rachael\n\nthe VHS version is wide screen (letter box) on the TV, therefore dark bars appear at the top and bottom\n\nThe Blade Runner \"police spinner\" sound can be heard in the first Highlander movie when Nash is arrested leaving Madison Square Gardens.\n\nThe following CRT displays are seen before liftoff of Gaff's spinner. The lower CRT display is also seen 2 years earlier in Ridley Scott's \"Alien\".\n\nThis screen is shown first in a blue background with the numbers rolling down one line every second\n\nENVORON CTR ............................. - ................... - - ................... - - ................... - - ................... - - 92886599 | 95654085 - - ................... - - ................... - - ................... - ............................. 24556 DR5\n\nThen this is shown in red...\n\nENVORON CTR PURGE 24556 DR5\n\nBlade Runner Movie Observations and Anomalies\n\nNote: There are many more anomalies than those listed here (check the FAQs in the news groups)\n\nAnomaly Area 1:\n\nReplicant (M) Des: LEON V.K. NEXUS 6 N6MAC41717 96/W/9-3H Incept Date: 10 APRIL., 2017 Func: Combat/Loader (Nuc. Fiss.) Phys: LEV.A Ment: LEV.C ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Replicant (M) Des: BATTY (Roy) NEXUS 6 N6MAA10816 Incept Date: 8 JAN., 2016 Func: Combat, Colonization Defense Prog. Phys: LEV.A Ment: LEV.A ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Replicant (F) Des: ZOHRA NEXUS 6 N6FAB61216 Incept Date: 12 JUNE., 2016 Func: Retrained (9 Feb,2018) Polit.Homicide Phys: LEV.A Ment: LEV.B ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Replicant (F) Des: PRIS NEXUS 6 N6FAB21416 Incept Date: 14 FEB., 2016 Func: Military / Leisure Phys: LEV.A Ment: LEV.B ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotes / Observations:\n\nBATTY is the only replicant designated using his last name (first name was Roy)\n\nLEON's model number is:\n\nN6MAC41717 (as seen in the movie) N6MAC41017 (correction from dialog with Deckard) ||||||||++- Incept Year : 2017 ||||||++--- Incept Day : 10 |||||+----- Incept Month: 4 (April) ||||+------ Mental : C (low) |||+------- Physical : A (high) ||+-------- Sex : Male ++--------- Model Series: Nexus 6\n\nOnly LEON has a V. K. (Voight-Kampff) designation since he was the only one of the off world replicants that received a V. K. test\n\nIf \"96/W/9-3H\" represents the date of the test then we've found another error because the movie starts in November 2019\n\nPerhaps \"96\" is part of Holden's badge number (Deckard's badge number is B26354 so perhaps his entries would be prefixed with \"54\". Better double check Deckard's display the next time I watch the movie). On the other hand, \"96\" could represent a case number in Holden's computer\n\nThe \"W\" could represent \"Waste Disposal\" which is where Leon worked at Tyrell.\n\nSince the off-world mutiny occurred \"two weeks ago\" (possibly October?) then the \"9\" couldn't represent the month in which Leon was hired.\n\nI assume that the \"H\" in the V. K. designation stands for Holden (the Blade Runner who ran this particular V. K. test). This could be the third interview of the visit.\n\nZOHRA has been marked \"retrained\". This is more evidence that replicants are biological beings rather than electro-mechanical robots as described in DADOES\n\nFact #1: The movie starts in November 2019.\n\nFact #2: NEXUS 6 Replicants only have a 4 year life span.\n\nObservations:\n\nBATTY is the oldest (Incept: 8-JAN-2016 makes him at least 46 months old) but already seems to be having some arthritis-like problems.\n\nWe don't know if Batty dies in November, December or January.\n\nIf replicants live exactly 4 years (48 months) then Roy dies in January.\n\nPRIS is only one month younger than BATTY, but seems to be deteriorating in a different way. This may be evidence that the 48-month time limit is not exact.\n\nSince no visible problems can be seen with ZOHRA, we can probably assume \"replicant age related problems\" only begin after 41 months of life.\n\nOn the other hand, all four replicants just mentioned are at Physical Level A.\n\nPRIS's incept date was St. Valentine's Day and is referred to as a basic pleasure model (were Tyrell designers just clowning around that day?). Bryant refers to her as \"the fourth skin job\" but many movie-watchers heard the phrase \"the foreskin job\"\n\nIf any incept dates would have been after September, would the sixth character of the model number be anything from \"A\" to \"C\"?\n\nOtherwise we would need to assume that no models were ever created between October and December (highly unlikely in a capitalist economy)\n\nObviously the Tyrell corporation didn't care about their dates being Y2K compliant.\n\nWith 4-year life spans these non-Y2K-compliant incept dates are not much of a problem. However Rachael's longer life could pose a problem. Perhaps she was not Nexus-6\n\nLeon is the dumbest (Mental=C), so why was he sent to infiltrate the Tyrell Corporation?\n\nAnomaly Area 2:\n\nWhen the Asian woman on Animoid Row looks into the electron microscope, she says \"9906947XB71\" but we can clearly see a segment of the serial number that reads \"07XB\".\n\nAnomaly Area 3:\n\nStatement #1 in Bryant's office:\n\nBryant: I've got four skin jobs walking around.\n\nStatement #2 in Bryant's office:\n\nBryant: There was an escape in the off world colony 2 weeks ago. Six replicants. Three male and three female. They slaughtered twenty three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the ship off the coast. No crew. No sight of them. Three nights ago they tried to break into the Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running through an electrical field.\n\nStatement #3 in street after Zohra's death:\n\nBryant: Four more to go. Come on Gaff.\n\nDeckard: Three. There's three to go.\n\nBryant: There's four. There's that skin job you V.K.'d at the Tyrell Corporation. Rachael. Disappeared! Vanished. Didn't even know that she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.\n\nNotes:\n\nStatement #1 is probably right. Especially if you listen to the tone of Bryant's voice change from the previous sentence. This is probably something that got fixed up in editing. Also, only four replicants are listed in the NEXUS specs sheet above.\n\nStatement #2 has got to be wrong. If you start out with six and one gets killed, then you are left with five. Since Rachael can't be counted because she was already on Earth, one replicant is missing. Only four are listed in the replicant specs sheet above. However, the book \"Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human\" does have possible explanations for this apparent fubar.\n\nStatement #3 seems to corroborate Statement #1\n\nSome Blade Runner FAQ's put a different spin on this\n\nGame Info + Links\n\nWestwood Studios is the maker of a neat 4-CD Blade Runner game for Windows 95 and Windows NT.

Could it be police slang for a machine with ESP-like capabilities? Perhaps it is an acronym meaning \"Electronic Scanning Photo Enhancing and Reporting\".\n\nIn the world of \"organic chemistry\" specialists toss around an acronym which spells VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) but is pronounced \"vesper\". It is entirely possible that Ridley Scott, or one of his collaborators, asked some organic chemists for a few buzz words and they heard \"vesper\" but wrote down \"esper\". At least, that's my theory and I'm sticking with it until I hear something better or official.\n\nBlade Runner 2049 (2017)\n\ncolloquially known as Blade Runner 2 but officially titled Blade Runner 2049\n\nNorth American release: 2017-10-06 (Oct 6)\n\nRunning time: 163 minutes (2 hours, 43 minutes)\n\ncomment: some web sites claim that 1 hour had been cut from the movie during editing. Other web sites claim 100 minutes (which reminds me about that old April Fool's joke about \"the metric hour\"). Whatever the actual amount of time, it was sufficient that the producers felt they needed to explain some things ahead of the release by publishing three promotional videos.\n\nThree promotional videos (laying the foundations for 2049)\n\nBlade Runner Black Out 2020\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner_Black_Out_2022\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rrZk9sSgRyQ (Anime - 15:44)\n\nnotes:\n\nlook for the two Replicant spec sheets (one male, one female, both purposely blurred on the right-hand side (location 1:31)\n\n8-character designations begin with \"MK\" for the male and \"JR\" for the female\n\nthis is a different format from the Nexus 6 model format seen above (e.g. N6AAA99999)\n\nIn BR:2049 we observe that Rachel's model number is N7FAA52318 (Nexus-7, Sex: Female, Physical: A, Mental: A, Incept Date: 2018-05-23) and that this format is similar to the Nexus-6 format. This means that replicants created by the Wallace corporation are using a different format that the Tyrell corporation.\n\ncomment: I think this is one spot where all screen writers of all movies and shorts really messed up: they confuse model numbers with serial numbers. Assuming that more than one replicant was made per day, then you cannot use a model number in your replicant retirement report. There must also be a serial number.\n\nlook for a second view from the bottom; here we see more of the female designation which is \"JR00...\" (location 1:41)\n\nlook for an ESPER replicant spec display for \"Trixie\" (location 2:27)\n\ndesignation \"WDV71673\" (nothing to do with the incept date)\n\ncomment: troublesome because she appears to be \"an under-the-age-of-consent human\"\n\nlook for a Replicant spec sheet for one male named Iggy (location 3:51)\n\nthis Nexus-8 was made 30-Sep-2019\n\nI wonder want \"Mental Level S\" means; smart or stupid?\n\nlook for a Replicant spec sheet for one male named Morton (location: 4:09)\n\nthis Nexus-8 was made 22-Mar-2019\n\nserial number NX-82176 (or 7.6) can be seen on the white of a Replicant eyeball (location: 8:14 )\n\nrolling text:\n\nLOS ANGELES\n\nMAY, 2020\n\nWhile the Replicant NEXUS 6 expired in inventory,\n\nTYREL CORP. pushed the series 8 into the local and Off-world market.\n\nThe NEXUS series 8 were purpose-built with a natural lifespan.\n\nSoon the human supremacy movements began.\n\nThese angry masses used the Replicant Registration\n\ndatabase to identify and kill Replicants.\n\nThe blackout, which led to the prohibition of Replicant\n\nproduction sealed the fate of the TYRELL CORPORATION.\n\nIt took over a decade for THE WALLACE CORP.\n\nto win approval to manufacture a new breed of Replicants.\n\n2036: Nexus Dawn\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2036:_Nexus_Dawn\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UgsS3nhRRzQ (Video - 6:30)\n\n2048: Nowhere to Run\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048:_Nowhere_to_Run\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ9Os8cP_gg (Video - 5:47 )\n\nAdditional Promotional Resources\n\nhttp://bladerunnermovie.com/ Official BR:2049 Movie Site\n\nhttp://bladerunnermovie.warnerbroscanada.com/trailer/ Official Trailers\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner_2049\n\nhttp://www.scified.com/blog/bladerunner2\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/BladeRunnerMovie/\n\nThe Cast and Crew of 'Blade Runner 2049' on the Original Film | Created with Blade Runner 2049\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va4dJI0Cyyw\n\nInside the Making of 'Blade Runner 2049' | Created with Blade Runner 2049\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0kobbjpdUg\n\nActor Harrison Ford talks about his new movie, \"Blade Runner 2049\"\n\nhttps://charlierose.com/videos/31027\n\nparaphrased quote:\n\n\"it doesn't matter if Deckard is a replicant who thinks he's human or just human.

All assets were acquired by the Wallace Corporation\n\nAny more information about nexus model numbers?\n\nanswer: Sapper was the tail-end of the Nexus-8 line; That makes Luv and Officer K \"Nexus-9\"\n\nWhy was there a bounty on Nexus-8 replicants?\n\nanswer: They have free will -AND- they die of old age meaning they will live a really long time\n\nwhat happened to Gaff?\n\nanswer: Living in an old-age home\n\nWhat happened to Rachael?\n\nanswer: She died during child-birth. Apparently Nexus-7 replicants were able to reproduce\n\nWhat was Rachael's official Nexus serial number?\n\nanswer: N7FAA52318 (Nexus-7, Sex: Female, Physical: A, Mental: A, Incept Date: 2018-05-23). This Nexus-7 number can be seen in two differnet DNA displays\n\nIs Deckard a replicant?\n\nanswer: We still don't know; He's either Nexus-7 (able to reproduce) or human. Since he has aged then this means that all Nexus-7 replicants age -or- he is Nexus-8 but with free will. But this means that male Nexus-8 replicants are also able to reproduce (the plot thickens)\n\nIs Officer K related to Deckard?\n\nanswer: No. He was implanted with memories from Deckard's daughter making him the perfect decoy\n\nWhere was Deckard hiding all these years?\n\nanswer: In a Las Vegas casino\n\nWhy were Luv and Wallace searching for the child?\n\nanswer: Tyrell Corp engineered Nexus-7's to be able to sexually reproduce (probably to increase production numbers). This information was lost during the great blackout so Walace Corp needed the child so they could reverse-engineer the lost knowledge\n\nBlade Runner 2099\n\ncoming to Amazon Prime Video in 2024\n\ntrailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=752U3yG83_8\n\nproduction companies:\n\nAlcon Entertainment (Blade Runner 2049, The Expanse, etc.)\n\nAmazon Studios\n\nScott Free Productions (home of Ridley Scott)\n\nOther Related Stuff\n\nAmazon Prime production: The Man in the High Castle\n\nproduced by Ridley Scott (of Blade Runner fame)\n\ndeveloped by Frank Spotnitz (of X-Files fame)\n\noriginal story by Philip K. Dick (of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? fame)\n\nNotes (from my humble childhood)\n\np.s. names have been omitted for privacy reasons\n\nI was born in the year 1952 at Kitchener, Ontario, Canada and my parents were always banging on about us being German (they never used the phrase German-Canadian). In hindsight, I can see that this was ridiculous because my father's family came to Canada in 1873 (to escape the economic hardship after the Franco-German war ended in 1871) while the roots of my mother's family are Pennsylvania Dutch. Although I might have heard some German spoken at Kitchener's Farmer's Market on Saturday mornings, adults only spoke German when they wanted to communicate privately in front of the kids. Unlike some other families, my parents did not send us to German language school on Saturday mornings, and yet, they maintained that we were German. (???)\n\nThe following event happened sometime in the middle 1950s: Mister H was an insurance salesman who lived across the street from my parents. Every summer, his family would host a neighborhood backyard BBQ and that's where I first noticed that one of the men from the neighborhood, Mr. K, had numbers on his forearm. I asked my father about this and he replied \"I tell you when we get home\". Later that evening I asked again about Mr. K's numbers and my father replied \"the Germans did that\". Thinking we were German, I responded \"we did that?\". Then he corrected himself by saying \"Mr. K was Jewish and the NAZIs did that to people they put into the concentration camps. And most did not survive\". What a horrifying thought.\n\nLater on, T, the son of Mr. K was in my grade 1 and 2 classes a Courtland Public School and I soon learned that he, and his older brother, were much nicer people than most of my other friends. On top of that, Mr. K and his wife seemed nicer parents than my own in that \"they had conversations with their kids\" while this seemed impossible with my own parents who were more fond of yelling at us. Mr. K also owned a huge collection of books (seemed to rival the public library) while nothing more than Life magazine could be found at out house. Since that time, I have become fiercely opposed to anti-Semitism. In fact, I am also against war and the death penalty. I now call myself a deist/humanist. \"Live and let live\" is my motto.\n\nNow let me comment about what I have posted on this web page: although I love sci-fi and liked the book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? as well as the Blade Runner books and movies, I find the German stuff \"very creepy\". If you didn't know about the NAZI subtext, Blade Runner would still be just a variation of the Frankenstein Story: man creates monster - man abuses monster - monster kills man.\n\nBut with the NAZI stuff in there, clearly we can see the true meaning of the preamble to the book \"Blade Runner 2\": the Germans did not learn any lessons from their actions up to the end of WW2 so went on to create Replicants: \"a race of slaves to use and abuse\". But there is a deeper lesson here which is this: Like the NAZI's, it is the police (Blade Runners) that have little-to-no empathy. It is the corporate billionaire, Eldon Tyrell, who seems to have none.\n\nAnd before the rest of us congratulate ourselves for not being NAZIs, we must all remember that white Americans were enslaving Africans at a time when most European countries were getting out of that horrific activity. What is worse is this: during and after the American civil war, many so-called \"slave states\" claimed they needed to retain slavery in order to prevent an economic collapse. They were putting money ahead of the rights of people (and how is this different from what the Tyrell Corporation was doing when they created, then sold, Replicants?)\n\nSo let all of this be a warning for all of humanity to live by the Golden Rule: Treat others the way you wish to be treated."
