        "text": "May 17, 2023\n\nI was a little disappointed. I am about 4 episodes into the Black Lotus animate series (I bought Season 1) and I love that series. I very much get the Blade Runner mood and settings from the original movie. But I just do not get a Blade Runner feel from this volume. Not at all.\n\nCould it be the mediocre art? The change of setting from dark dismal LA to the bleak desert? Whatever, it felt more of a Mad Max type story. Read this via a library loan and saved me some money.\n\nI loved reading Blade Runner 2019, 2029, Origins, and 2039. All excellent. The art is top notch, the stories give us readers a very Blade Runner type atmosphere. You can almost feel the bleak rain coming down as you read.\n\nI will finish up with the final episodes of the animated Black Lotus series and will be caught up in the 2039 series in a couple of days (4 issues out of a possible 12). Would love to see a Replicant/Blade Runner story set in the off-world colonies. Replicants in combat?\n\nMarch 6, 2024\n\nThis is an example of the lasting impact of the original Blade Runner film - yes that was taken from the PK Dick story but the film really gave it an identity all of its own which the first explored further by K W Jeter and then again in Blade 2049 and the it seemed there was an explosion of new material.\n\nSo here we have the spin off a spin off(?) First you had the animated series that then ran in to this story. Set in 2032 you fall between the second movie and the events of the Blade Runner 2029 / 2039 graphic novel series.\n\nYes it appears there is a grown series which I am sure will converge and cross over before it is finished but for now we have a standalone story which I feel is going to grown (lets hope we do not have to wait too long). Its great fun and just as actioned packed as the shows - love it\n\nNovember 22, 2023\n\nNot really bad. Just unimaginative cyberpunk for kids.\n\nArt’s more of the same: not bad per se but lacking a spark of something more than serviceable. The slightly cartoony aspect highlights the aforementioned \"for kids\" aspect .\n\nApril 5, 2023\n\nI had to give this book 5 stars simply as this is what I always wanted the Blade Runner series to be like. A replicant with not only fighting skills but a willingness to fight back.\n\nElle does not know what she is searching for but in the middle of the desert, she finds a community. However when the community comes under attack will she fight back or walk away?\n\nA great addition to the Blade Runner universe. I really hope to see Elle in the main storyline possible in 2039? The book finishes with a cover gallery and sketchbook with notes on the page designs.\n\nFebruary 23, 2023\n\nI rather liked the Blade Runner miniseries I watched last year called \"Blade Runner: Black Lotus\". This graphic novel here is a continuation of that series (which, in itself, probably limits the audience for this work).\n\nInteresting enough story, and I probably would have liked it better if they hadn't been weird about how they drew the main character, Elle. Elle looked, on the tv series, roughly like how she looks on the over of this work. But inside? Inside she looks like a 12 year old girl. It was confusing. She is/was a small thin woman on the tv show, but didn't look like a 12 year old.\n\nThis was published by Titan comics, the same publisher that publishes the Hard Case graphic novels. So, since it's the same company, I figure I should note: no nudity occurs in this work. Unlike every other Titan graphic novel I've read (all of which have been connected to the Hard Case imprint). Massive amounts of violence, death, and bones sticking through skin, so this isn't a G rated comic. The R(estricted)/A(dult) rating here would be for the violence and gore, as opposed to the other Titan works I've read. Which would be R/A for sex and nudity (and, depending on the specific work, on violence and blood-shed).\n\nRating: 3.15\n\nFeb 23 2023\n\nJune 28, 2023\n\nMore post-apocalyptic Western than sci-fi noir but enjoyable enough for a summer’s afternoon.\n\nJuly 6, 2023\n\nBefore reading the 'Blade Runner: Black Lotus' graphic novel. I tracked down the anime series that precedes it (not easy to find these days as it's no longer available on any streaming service) and watched all 13 episodes. And while the series was a bit of a mixed bag in its own right, I'm glad I went to the trouble.\n\nThe graphic novel, titled 'Leaving L.A.', picks up right where the anime left off. They do include a one-page recap of the show, but as you might imagine it's a bit lacking in detail. The final shot of the show shows Elle, a Replicant who's just been through a lot, speeding away into the desert on a hover bike. And the first frame of the graphic novel shows her speeding into the desert on a hover bike.\n\nUnfortunately, that's where the similarities end.\n\nI'm honestly not sure why this is a continuation of the show at all. The story it tells has only passing reference to what came before and the evolution Elle experienced as a character doesn't really come into play. The story is fine on its own - a desert commune of sharecroppers pitted against a corrupt mining boss and his thugs. When the conflict reaches its apex, luckily Elle is here to help sort things out. And that's about it.\n\nSet in a desert and featuring a lot of people scraping by, 'Leaving L.A.' reminded me more of Mad Max than Blade Runner. While there are some references to Replicants, other than Elle herself those are mostly replaceable with \"slaves\" or \"victims\" and it would be the same.\n\nWhere is Blade Runner here? This doesn't look or feel like a noir story. It doesn't ask interesting questions about the nature of humanity and artificial life. Elle being a Replicant doesn't even really seem to matter much in the end. It's just a story of a mysterious hero in the near-future world, and there are an awful lot of those these days.\n\nSo I'm glad I watched the anime first. Because it was mostly pretty good, and even where it missed the mark, I appreciated that it presented a different kind of Blade Runner story. When it was over and Elle raced off into the distance, I was left wondering what happened next.\n\nOn the last page of this graphic novel, it says \"Black Lotus will return.\" I'm not sure I'm still interested enough to see what happens if she does.\n\nMay 2, 2023\n\nI was looking forward to this novel, having truly enjoyed the animated series.\n\nAnd man was I disappointed. It seems that main comic Blade Runner series will remain the flagship for a long time to come.\n\nArt is interesting, slightly on a cartoonish side of things, but OK. Most important it is consistent throughout the volume. Coloring is also beautifully done. So graphically very well done work.\n\nProblem is in the story. Story must be the most bland story I read in a while (including comics and prose fiction, even poetry I might add). It is just that story goes from A to B to C to D, even after first issue I knew exactly where this story will go. There is no dramatic element, no place where you wonder if our heroes will survive, will they manage to overcome the next hurdle. There is nothing because from the start it is visible there is no danger to our heroes. Yes, people will die but this happens in the background, almost noiseless because these characters are there just to show how bad things are but we could just as well be without these characters. They add no ..... weight?..... to the story, they are just part of the set, basically nothing.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this is comic, I do not expect some high level of story presentation. But let us look at the stories like Conan, various crime stories (pulp fiction) and even let us go to the main story line of Blade Runner comics - we all know our heroes will survive, but these comics kept me interested to see what is going on, what is lurking behind the next corner, how will our heroes handle it, I mean some kind of progress of both characters and the story, some hint of challenge. This is what makes good story. Otherwise we could all read phone books or political pamphlets for entertainment.\n\nAll of this is missing from this volume. Everything is just straight forward, everyone is highly knowledgeable, highly capable that basically there is no ..... story. Two panels could have made the whole volume - Elle coming into the town outside LA on one panel and Elle leaving the city with all dead bad guys in the background on another panel.\n\nHopefully author's will improve in follow up stories about the Elle. Animated series was great, I truly enjoyed it, I just wish they build up the equivalent story-wise in graphical format.\n\nAnd one thing that is so cringy and you cannot miss it on pages of this comic, is political messaging. I understand that this is now trendy and everything but it just makes the entire story blah - Russian mafia leading the fracking company that looks like Sauron's lair with all the smoke and towers, good guys living in, for all means and purposes, Eden with enough propellers on all the wind turbines to be able to elevate few miles above ground. Living in such a clean condition and in harmony with nature that I was ..... huh? I mean, what, in else completely polluted world few miles outside LA you basically have equivalent of zero pollution area, clean beautiful blue sky (as opposed to dark, ridiculous smoke area of fracking company) where you can grow food without any problems to feed hundreds o people (in bloody desert)? Not to mention that hover bikes that noone saw for decades, oh yeah they can be fixed in couple of days by only changing the circuit board in mechanic shop in the middle of nowhere (whaaat?). And this Eden of course is built and led by the best and brightest from all over - scientists, engineers, medical personnel etc. I mean in any apocalyptic, dystopian story this would be the Holy Grail for all people to find and live there and it exists just outside of LA, few days ride away. I mean, what? I could just see common sense (and I mean it in terms of fiction story) going out the window.\n\nAs I said, this political element and preachiness just kills of the story.\n\nIn summary, interesting. But nowhere near the quality of the main Blade Runner series.\n\nJune 24, 2023\n\nToo little action. Too much nothing-dialogue: not funny, not important, not deep, irrevelant, unmemorable.\n\nThe action was really cliché:\n\n- dropping the child, but diving down to grab them\n\n- not killing the villain, given the chance, too many ridiculous kicks, too much repetition with katana handle head-butts.\n\nNot reading anymore from this series.\n\nDiscouraged from future Blade Runner comics.\n\nJuly 11, 2024\n\nPOPKULTUROWY KOCIOŁEK:\n\nCzęść osób (zwłaszcza fanów anime) mogło się już zetknąć z tytułem Blade Runner: Czarny Lotos. W 2021 zadebiutował bowiem na rynku serial animowany pod tym samym tytułem (którego recenzja jest do znalezienia na blogu). Zbieżność tytułów nie jest przypadkowa, mamy tu bowiem do czynienia z dziełem w którym obserwujemy dalsze losy replikanta Elle. Po komiks można jednak sięgnąć bez znajomości wspomnianej animacji.\n\nAkcja przenosi nas tu do Los Angeles roku 2032. Replikant Elle (zwana jako Czarny lotos) po wymknięciu się z rąk swojego twórcy, wyrusza na pustynię w poszukiwaniu odkupienia i nowego życia, wolnego od rozlewu krwi i śmierci. Miejsce to nie należy jednak do najbezpieczniejszych, a i sama jej przeszłość nie da tak łatwo o sobie zapomnieć.\n\nNancy A. Collins w pierwszym tomie serii kreśli historię, której estetyka znacząco odbiega od klasycznego Blade Runnera. Miejsce, w którym znalazła się Elle, przypomina bowiem lokacje żywcem wyjęte z Mad Maxa. Fani BR mogą więc być mocno rozczarowani klimatem komiksu, który z kolejnymi przeczytanymi kadrami coraz bardziej przypomina western postapo z dodatkiem cyberpunkowych elementów.\n\nNa pewno nie brakuje tu wartkiej i widowiskowej akcji. Komiks w dynamiczny sposób prowadzi nas przez kolejne wątki. Sam świat przedstawiony jest zaś pełen brudu, pyłu i przemocy.\n\nNiestety ten element komiksu również ma swoje pewne zauważalne niedociągnięcia. Scenarzystka po ciekawym początku dosyć szybko stawia tu bowiem na dużą schematyczność i przewidywalność, przez co trudno jest jej zaskoczyć czytelnika. Na dodatek niektóre postacie są niedopracowane i jednowymiarowe. Brakuje tu też bardziej szczegółowego rozwinięcia niektórych wątków pobocznych, co pozostawia pewien niedosyt....\n\nhttps://popkulturowykociolek.pl/blade...\n\nJuly 9, 2023\n\nAnother pre-existing universe given a stereotypical American West plot treatment. Big bad industry vs small do-good village, badass stranger coming in to save the day, a desert setting--heck, there's even a saloon. And that would've been totally fine if done well. As it stands, though, none of the characters are especially vivid, and the protagonist Elle is about third down on the list of characters with actual depth. And considering how much misogynistic violence and language there is in this story, I was surprised to see that a woman wrote it. Violence against women can obviously be rampant within a story and still work; but in this case it came off as unwieldy at best and generally pandering to a misogynistic reader at worst. Yes, Elle, the mother Nyoko, and the co-op won in the end, but it was a very small win on a vast scale of a violent patriarchy. Also did not love how the co-op was going to invite all the remaining factory workers--who participated in the sexual slavery of the replicants and would've assaulted any non-replicant captives--to join them in their nice li'l colony. All kinds of nonsense in here.\n\nI'll try the next one because the world of Blade Runner is amazing and I do love a ronin saga, but boy, it'll need to show improvements real quick.\n\nMarch 18, 2023\n\nFull disclosure: I did not enjoy the Black Lotus series. Elle's story had its moments, but she was ultimately a pretty bland protagonist.\n\nThis series doesn't change that a whole lot, although she does seem to have a bit more humanity in her here, as she basically lives out a post-apocalyptic version of a western. A company town, the commune nearby, and Wallace Corporation all come together to cause a lot of death and destruction in a story that will feel very familiar, but still be relatable due to a number of interestingly developed characters. Elle basically walks through the story doing everything you would expect, trying to help the good guys, but causing a lot of disaster in her wake. Not that she doesn't clean up her own messes, but there's nothing here that felt particularly novel - it didn't even really need to be in the Blade Runner universe. If you're a fan of the series, it's a nice follow-up, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but the most dedicated Blade Runner fans.\n\nDecember 4, 2022\n\nThis self-contained story takes place immediately after the events of the Black Lotus anime series. So, if you want to avoid spoilers for the series, don't read this first (and you really should watch the series--it's an excellent addition to the Blade Runner universe). The story starts with Elle leaving Los Angeles, but she soon finds trouble in the California desert when she gets involved in a feud between a fracking operation and a green energy commune. Collins deftly paces the story, alternating good action sequences with interesting character development, smoothly building information for maximum impact. I look forward to reading or watching more about Elle as she learns more about herself on her journey of discovery.\n\nSeptember 15, 2023\n\nI’ve been really having a blast lately with the comic book series of Blade Runner. However this is the first time where I didn’t enjoy this book as much as the others. Being a continuation of the Black Lotus anime series (which I loved by the way), I simply didn’t get the feel of the unique world of Blade Runner. It came closer to a spaghetti western combined with Mad Max. The art also wasn’t something that attracted me, especially main character Elle who just looked radically different from the way she looked in the anime. The story also wasn’t as clever as the ones in the other 3 series I’ve read so far. It was all just pretty mediocre. It was nice to at least see Elle back in action again, but I’m hoping she will get a better treatment if they decide to bring her back.\n\nFebruary 22, 2023\n\nReleased in 2021, Blade Runner: Black Lotus was an anime series co-produced by Crunchyroll and Adult Swim set in-between the two feature films. The story followed replicant Elle’s journey to discover her identity, and her story continues in this graphic novel from writer Nancy A. Collins. After being used as an unwitting assassin for Niander Wallace Jr’s machinations, the replicant escapes Los Angeles while trying to leave behind her violent past.\n\nMy review can be read at Bloody Good Screen.\n\nJune 16, 2023\n\nI take it Black Lotus extends a Blade Runner anime series - having never seen the series, I didn't have a lot invested in the main character here. She shows up in a filthy energy mining town and quickly gets in a fight. The neighboring green energy town needs a hero, and she serves ably. It's all over quite quickly with almost no surprises. The desert landscape lacks the moodiness of other Blade Runner efforts. Black Lotus is fully skippable.\n\nSeptember 23, 2023\n\nGreat story about Blade Runner Universe. I had fun reading it and like a lot the art, settings, characters, and the few last pages about the behind the scenes of how they make the comics and other ideas for the story.\n\nI hope the make more stories about this characters and spin-offs, and novels too.\n\nFebruary 25, 2023\n\nThe animated series looked great but was slow and not very interesting. This isn't slow but too action orientated and worse Elle doesn't look like how she did in the series - which was the best thing.\n\nSeptember 16, 2023\n\nIt’s decently good. A worthy continuation from the show but definitely isn’t the most philosophical when it comes to Blade Runner content.\n\nIt’s different but it’s a cool enough story. Definitely recommend to Blade Runner completionists.\n\nMarch 18, 2023\n\nI enjoyed it. Good story, good artwork. I'm a big fan of the Blade Runner world."
