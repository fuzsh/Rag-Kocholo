K. W. Jeter is among the leading writers of Steampunk sf.

His books include the H.G. Wells pastiche Morlock Night (1979), the controversial proto-cyberpunk Dr. Adder (1984) and Infernal Devices (1987).

He also wrote three literary sequels to Ridley Scott‘s film Blade Runner (1982), which, in turn, was based on Philip K Dick‘s novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968).

Steampunk

Jeter is is one of the leading exponents of the is ”Steampunk” literary subgenre: in fact he coined the term in a letter to the sf magazine Locus:

”Dear Locus,

”Enclosed is a copy of my 1979 novel Morlock Night; I’d appreciate your being so good as to route it Faren Miller, as it’s a prime piece of evidence in the great debate as to who in “the Powers/Blaylock/Jeter fantasy triumvirate” was writing in the “gonzo-historical manner” first. Though of course, I did find her review in the March Locus to be quite flattering.

”Personally, I think Victorian fantasies are going to be the next big thing, as long as we can come up with a fitting collective term for Powers, Blaylock and myself. Something based on the appropriate technology of the era; like “steampunks”, perhaps…”

– K.W Jeter
