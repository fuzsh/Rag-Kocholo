        "text": "Toni Morrison\n\nAmerican author\n\nTop Questions\n\nWhat did Toni Morrison write?\n\nAmong Toni Morrison’s best-known works are the novels The Bluest Eye (1970), Sula (1973), Song of Solomon (1977), and Beloved (1987) and the nonfiction volumes Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination (1992) and Remember (2004).\n\nWhy is Toni Morrison important?\n\nMorrison was noted for her examination of the experiences of Black Americans, particularly Black women. In an unjust society, her characters struggle to find themselves and their cultural identity. Her use of fantasy, her sinuous poetic style, and her rich interweaving of the mythic gave her stories great strength and texture.\n\nWhat awards did Toni Morrison win?\n\nMorrison won a Pulitzer Prize for fiction for the critically acclaimed novel Beloved (1987). She received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993. In 2010 Morrison was made an officer of the French Legion of Honour. Two years later she was awarded the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nToni Morrison (born February 18, 1931, Lorain, Ohio, U.S.—died August 5, 2019, Bronx, New York) was an American writer noted for her examination of Black experience (particularly Black female experience) within the Black community and for her poetic, luminous prose. Considered one of the greatest contemporary American novelists, she received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993, becoming the first Black female writer in history to be honored with the prize.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nWofford grew up in the Midwest in a family that possessed an intense love of and appreciation for Black culture. Storytelling, songs, and folktales were a deeply formative part of her childhood. When Wofford was 12 years old she converted to Roman Catholicism and took “Anthony” as her baptismal name in honor of St. Anthony of Padua. After graduating from high school, she attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., where she began going by the nickname “Toni.” She graduated from Howard in 1953 with a bachelor’s degree in English and then began her graduate studies at Cornell University, receiving her master’s degree in 1955. After teaching at Texas Southern University for two years, she taught at Howard from 1957 to 1964. In 1958 she married Harold Morrison, a Jamaican architect. They were married six years before divorcing and had two sons together.\n\nEditing and teaching career\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nClassic Children’s Books Quiz\n\nIn 1965 Morrison began working as a textbook editor for a subsidiary of Random House in Syracuse, New York. Two years later she was recruited as an editor at Random House in New York City, where she worked for more than 15 years. She was the first female African American editor in the company’s history.\n\nAs an editor, Morrison published works by many African American writers and public figures, such as Toni Cade Bambara, Henry Dumas, Angela Davis, Huey P. Newton, Muhammad Ali, and Gayl Jones. Of her work as an editor, she once stated, “I look very hard for Black fiction because I want to participate in developing a canon of Black work…where Black people are talking to Black people.” In 1974 she worked with editor Middleton A. Harris to compile a vast collection of newspaper writings, photographs, letters, handbills, and other items documenting the Black experience for an encyclopedic work titled The Black Book. While working on this project, she discovered the story of Margaret Garner that would inspire her novel Beloved.\n\nIn 1983 Morrison left her job at Random House, and the following year she began teaching writing at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Albany. In 1989 she left SUNY to join the faculty of Princeton University; she retired in 2006.\n\n(Read W.E.B. Du Bois’s 1926 Britannica essay on African American literature.)\n\nThe Bluest Eye\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nMorrison began writing fiction during her editing and teaching career. Eventually, she began crafting one of her early short stories, about a Black girl who longs to have blue eyes, into a longer work. That story became Morrison’s first book, The Bluest Eye (1970), a novel of initiation concerning a victimized adolescent Black girl who is obsessed by white standards of beauty. The New York Times praised the book for “a prose so precise, so faithful to speech and so charged with pain and wonder that the novel becomes poetry.”\n\nSula, Song of Solomon, and Tar Baby\n\nIn 1973 Morrison published her second novel, Sula, which examines (among other issues) the dynamics of female friendship and the expectations for conformity within the Black community. In 1975 it was a finalist for a National Book Award. Her next novel, Song of Solomon (1977), featured a male narrator in search of his identity and incorporated elements of magical realism; its publication brought Morrison to national attention, and it won that year’s National Book Critics Circle Award. It was followed by Tar Baby (1981), which is set on a Caribbean island and explores conflicts of race, class, and gender.\n\nBeloved\n\nIn 1987 Morrison published the critically acclaimed Beloved, which won a Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Set in the 19th century and based on a true story, the novel tells of a young enslaved woman named Sethe who runs away from her enslavers and, at the point of recapture, kills her infant daughter in order to spare her a life of slavery. Eighteen years later, the daughter returns to haunt Sethe and other family members, a plot development that many readers and critics interpreted as a metaphor for America’s haunting legacy of slavery. The novel was praised for its compelling storytelling and evocative prose, a mix of African American dialect and stream of consciousness:\n\nI am Beloved and she is mine.…Three times I lost her: once with the flowers because of the noisy clouds of smoke; once when she went into the sea instead of smiling at me; once under the bridge when I went in to join her and she came toward me but did not smile.…Now I have found her in this house. She smiles at me and it is my own face smiling. I will not lose her again. She is mine.\n\nMichiko Kakutani of The New York Times likened its plot and characters to “those in opera or Greek drama,” while in The New Republic, critic Stanley Crouch wrote that the novel “reads largely like a melodrama lashed to the structural conceits of the [TV] miniseries.” But Crouch’s opinion was an outlier; Beloved came to be regarded as a masterpiece of American literature. A film adaptation of the novel was released in 1998, directed by Jonathan Demme and starring Oprah Winfrey and Danny Glover. Morrison revisited the story that had inspired Beloved to write the libretto for Margaret Garner (2005), an opera named for the real-life woman at the novel’s center.\n\n(Read Henry Louis Gates, Jr.’s Britannica essay on “Monuments of Hope.”)\n\nNobel Prize\n\nIn 1992 Morrison released Jazz, a story of violence and passion set in New York City’s Harlem during the 1920s. The following year she received the Nobel Prize for Literature. In her Nobel lecture, Morrison spoke of the power of language and its capability to bring meaning to the human experience:\n\nWord-work is sublime…because it is generative; it makes meaning that secures our difference, our human difference—the way in which we are like no other life. We die. That may be the meaning of life. But we do language. That may be the measure of our lives.\n\nLater novels\n\nMorrison’s subsequent novels were Paradise (1998), a richly detailed portrait of a Black utopian community in Oklahoma, and Love (2003), an intricate family story that reveals the myriad facets of love and its ostensible opposite. A Mercy (2008) deals with slavery and social class in 17th-century America. In the redemptive Home (2012), a traumatized Korean War veteran encounters racism after returning home and later overcomes apathy to rescue his sister. In God Help the Child (2015), Morrison chronicled the ramifications of child abuse and neglect through the tale of Bride, a Black girl with dark skin who is born to light-skinned parents.\n\nNonfiction works and children’s books\n\nMorrison also wrote and edited nonfiction. In 1992 she published a work of criticism, Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination. Many of her essays and speeches were collected in What Moves at the Margin: Selected Nonfiction (2008; edited by Carolyn C. Denard) and The Source of Self-Regard: Selected Essays, Speeches, and Meditations (2019). She and her son Slade Morrison cowrote a number of children’s books, including the Who’s Got Game? series, The Book of Mean People (2002), and Please, Louise (2014).\n\nShe also penned Remember: The Journey to School Integration (2004), which chronicles the hardships of Black students during the racial integration of the American public school system. The book’s publication was timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education (1954), the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that declared school segregation to be unconstitutional. Aimed at children, the book uses archival photographs juxtaposed with captions speculating on the thoughts of their subjects. For that work, Morrison won the Coretta Scott King Award in 2005.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe central theme of Morrison’s novels is the Black American experience; in an unjust society, her characters struggle to find themselves and their cultural identity. Her use of fantasy, her sinuous poetic style, and her rich interweaving of the mythic gave her stories great strength and texture. In 2010 Morrison was made an officer of the French Legion of Honor. Two years later she was awarded the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom. Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am (2019) is a documentary about her life and career.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
