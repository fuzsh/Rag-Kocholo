        "text": "Each year, Nobel Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, Peace and Economics are awarded to “those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.”\n\nIn 2023, eleven laureates were awarded this distinctive prize. Their work and discoveries range from the groundbreaking findings behind the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 to the courageous fight for human rights, freedom, and democracy. During Nobel Week, December 6-12th, celebrations and events take place in Stockholm, Sweden and Oslo, Norway as well as digitally. Each year’s laureates give lectures describing the history and background of their discoveries, literature, or globally impactful work, and the annual Nobel Prize Concert is held to honor them all. An award ceremony on December 10th takes place, celebrating the laureates on the anniversary of the prize founder Alfred Nobel’s death.\n\nThe Nobel prizes were conceived of in 1895 by Alfred Nobel, a Swedish engineer, inventor, businessman, and philanthropist, when he signed his last will and testament, committing his vast fortune to establishing awards in an original five categories. It wasn’t until 1901 that these prizes were awarded to the first Nobel Laureates — a term inspired by Ancient Greece, where laurel wreaths, or crowns made of branches and leaves, were bestowed on athletic and poetic victors as a sign of honor. In 1968, Sweden’s central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, established a sixth prize: The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.\n\nBring the achievements of past Nobel Prize laureates to life with a selection of PBS LearningMedia videos, activities and lesson plans below. Ready-to-use Nobel Prize Lessons and animated games are also available for educators courtesy of the Nobel Prize’s Education Network.\n\nJump to article sections:\n\nNobel Prize Laureates in Physics\n\nNobel Prize Laureates in Chemistry\n\nNobel Prize Laureates in Physiology or Medicine\n\nNobel Prize Laureates in Literature\n\nNobel Peace Prize Laureates\n\nNobel Prize Laureates in Economic Sciences"
