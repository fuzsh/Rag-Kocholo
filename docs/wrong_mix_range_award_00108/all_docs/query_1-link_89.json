        "text": "Toni Morrison: Biography and Quotes\n\nBorn Chloe Anthony Wofford in Ohio on February 18, 1931, Toni Morrison was one of four children born to George and Ramah Wofford. Her father was a welder who also held down several other jobs to support his family. Her mother, Ramah, was a domestic worker. Morrison credits her parents with introducing her to reading, folklore and music, all of which have informed her works.\n\nMorrison grew up in a relatively integrated neighbourhood and attended a local school where she mentions that:\n\nWhen I was in first grade, nobody thought I was inferior. I was the only Black in the class and the only child who could read.” - Toni Morrison1\n\nAt age 12, she converted to Catholicism and took the name Anthony after Saint Anthony of Padua. This name, which was given at her baptism, became shortened to Toni, which she became most well known for. A multi-talented student, Morrison studied Latin, was part of the debate team and worked as a secretary for the head librarian of the Lorain Public Library. She graduated with honours from Lorain High School in 1949.\n\nMorrison elected to study Literature and Classics at a historically Black university, Howard University in Washington DC. At Howard, she toured extensively with the Howard University Players. This experience lead her to more fully experience the variety of racial divisions that existed in America. It was also at Howard that Morrison met many of the writers and academics that would influence her future works and style.\n\nAfter graduating in 1953, Morrison went on to do her Master's at Cornell University. She completed her thesis titled Virginia Woolf’s and William Faulkner’s Treatment of the Alienated in 1955. Themes of the various forms of alienation continued to be found in most of her future works, most prominently in A Mercy (2008).\n\nAfter graduating, Morrison taught English at Texas Southern University, before returning to Howard University as a lecturer in 1957. It was at Howard that she met her husband, Harold Morrison, an architect originally from Jamacia. After marrying in 1958, they had two children, Harold (1961) and Slade (1964). Morrison left her husband in 1964, moving with her children to Syracuse, New York to work as an editor for Random House.\n\nHer first book, The Bluest Eye was published in 1970 and was not well-received critically or commercially. Undeterred, Morrison continued to explore the female African American experience in Sula (1973) which became her breakthrough novel and was nominated for an American Book Award. Song of Solomon (1977), which won the National Book Critics Circle Award, solidified her reputation as a popular literary author.\n\nAfter being elected to the National Council of the Arts in 1980, Morrison won the Pulitzer Prize for Beloved (1987). Continuing her success, she became a professor at Princeton in 1989 and earned an honorary doctorate from Oxford University. She then went on to be the first Black woman to win the Nobel Prize in 1993 and also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama in 2012.\n\nAn ongoing champion of the arts, Morrison founded the Princeton Atelier to promote and amplify student work. Having seen many of her works banned at various times, Morrison was also a strong opponent of censorship. As the editor of Burn This Book, she has criticised censorship for erasing important works from being accessed by general audiences.\n\nAs though a whole universe is being described in invisible ink”. - Toni Morrison2\n\nAfter a long career as a distinguished professor and a prolific author, Toni Morrison died on August 5, 2019, in New York.\n\nSong of Solomon (1977)\n\nOriginally published in 1977, Song of Solomon is the story of Milkman Dead, the son of an upper-middle-class Black family. The novel is set between the North and South, in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia. With interwoven elements of mythology, oral tradition3, Magical Realism and Bildungsroman, the novel turned Morrison into a household name in America.\n\nBildungsroman loosely translates from German into a 'novel of education'. It is a coming of age novel that follows the psychological or spiritual transformation of a protagonist.\n\nMagical Realism is a sub-genre of Literary Realism that combines elements of reality with the magical or supernatural. Famous authors in this genre include Salman Rushdie, Ben Okri and Isabel Allende.\n\nOral tradition is the type of lore or knowledge that is verbally passed down from generation to generation. This can take the form of songs, plays, verse or prose.\n\nAs an ancient type of story sharing and learning, the oral tradition is considered to predate all written works. Examples can be found across many different cultures, some of which still make use of the method today.\n\nIn Africa, oral tradition is the oldest form of history sharing and folklore still in use. The sharing of stories is an aesthetic experience for the audience and storyteller and is as much about the performance as it is about the content.\n\nThe protagonist is generally considered to be Macon Dead Ⅲ aka Milkman, so named because he was nursed well past infancy. He is Morrison’s first male protagonist. The novel follows him and various related characters, as he tries to establish himself as a man who is independent of his family.\n\nWhile the non-linear journey or adventure element of the novel would appear to be Milkman’s quest for treasure in the literal form of gold, it is also about personal transformation and the quest for identity through the discovery of family history. Milkman overcomes his self-absorbed start to become more aware of his context and ability to contribute to his community.\n\nThere are a variety of themes in Song of Solomon, with key themes including the alienation of racism as well as the various meanings of flight and personal transcendence. Interestingly, Morrison leaves the ending of Song of Solomon open, with the reader unsure of Milkman’s fate.\n\nWhy do you think Morrison's Song of Solomon was so popular? What about the story made it appeal to a wide and general audience?"
