        "text": "The Nobel Prize-winning US author Toni Morrison has died at the age of 88.\n\nThe Morrison family confirmed “with profound sadness” that Morrison had died “following a short illness”.\n\nThe author of 11 novels, she won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993, having published her first novel, The Bluest Eye, in 1970.\n\nHer book Beloved told the story of a female African-American slave and was made into a film starring Oprah Winfrey in 1998.\n\nMorrison once said: “We die. That may be the meaning of life. But we do language. That may be the measure of our lives.”\n\nThe Morrison family statement said the “extremely devoted mother, grandmother, and aunt” had “passed away peacefully last night [5 August] surrounded by family and friends”.\n\n“The consummate writer who treasured the written word, whether her own, her students or others, she read voraciously and was most at home when writing,” it continued.\n\n“Although her passing represents a tremendous loss, we are grateful she had a long, well lived life.”\n\nThe family added: “While we would like to thank everyone who knew and loved her, personally or through her work, for their support at this difficult time, we ask for privacy as we mourn this loss to our family.\n\n“We will share information in the near future about how we will celebrate Toni’s incredible life.”\n\nHighlights of reaction\n\nto her death:\n\n“Toni Morrison was a national treasure. Her writing was not just beautiful but meaningful_a challenge to our conscience and a call to greater empathy. She was as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page. And so even as Michelle and I mourn her loss and send our warmest sympathies to her family and friends, we know that her stories_that our stories_will always be with us, and with those who come after, and on and on, for all time.” — former President Barack Obama, via Twitter.\n\n“In the beginning was the Word. Toni Morrison took the word and turned it into a Song.of Solomon, of Sula, Beloved, Mercy, Paradise Love, and more. She was our conscience. Our seer. Our truth-teller. She was a magician with language, who understood the Power of words. She used them to roil us, to wake us, to educate us and help us grapple with our deepest wounds and try to comprehend them. It is exhilarating and life-enhancing every time I read and share her work.” — Oprah Winfrey, concluding on Instagram with: “She was Empress-Supreme among writers. Long may her WORDS reign!”\n\n“I’ve been privileged to know Toni Morrison for nearly 40 years. During that time, she won many awards and accolades — the Nobel, a Pulitzer, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.But for me, Toni has been a treasured collaborator, a monumental inspiration and, most importantly, a cherished friend. We will all miss her, but the gifts she left us — her written works that have transformed so many lives around the world — live on…to educate, empower and nourish us. For this and all she shared with us, I say thank you Toni. My deepest sympathies go out to her family and friends.” — Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, director of this year’s documentary “Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am.”\n\n″‘If you surrender to the air, you can ride it.’ Rest in paradise.” — Beyonce, on her website.\n\n″‘If there is a book that you want to read but it hasn’t been written yet, you must be the one to write it,’ Toni Morrison said.
