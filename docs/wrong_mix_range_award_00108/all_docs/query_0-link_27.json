        "text": "The winners of this year's Nobel Peace Prize are recognized, the Nobel Committee said, for years of promoted the right to criticize power and protect the fundamental rights of citizens.\n\nThis year's Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine has been awarded to Swedish scientist Svante Pääbo for his discoveries on human evolution.\n\nThe U.S.-based economists shared this year's Nobel in economics for their work with \"natural experiments,\" such as studying how changes to the minimum wage impact the labor market.\n\nThe 2021 Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to journalists Maria Ressa of the Philippines and Dmitry Muratov of Russia.\n\nThe scientists' work led to a test to protect blood transfusion recipients from hepatitis C and drugs to treat the infection that have saved millions of lives, according to the Nobel Assembly.\n\nLess than two weeks after drawing international praise, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is struggling with unrest at home as his tenuous ally, Jawar Mohammed, alleges a plot against him.\n\nThe Swedish Academy made the unusual move Thursday of recognizing both Handke, an Austrian writer, and Tokarczuk, who is Polish, after scandal prevented the committee from awarding a prize last year.\n\nMorrison was the author of Beloved, Song of Solomon and The Bluest Eye. She was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the Presidential Medal of Freedom."
