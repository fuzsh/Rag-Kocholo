Today in History:

March 8, 1979

Philips, the Dutch multinational conglomerate corporation, unveiled a revolutionary product to the world at a press conference held in Eindhoven, Netherlands. The Compact Disc (CD), a digital optical disc data storage format that would transform the way we consume music and eventually how we play video games.

This event was the result of a collaboration between Sony and Philips. The two tech giants joined forces to standardize the specifications of the CD. They agreed upon a disc with a diameter of 12 cm, a decision driven by a rather musical rationale. This size was chosen specifically because it could hold enough audio data to accommodate Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, which runs for 74 minutes. This decision ensured that the CD would have sufficient capacity to contain a full-length musical performance, setting a new standard for audio storage.

The introduction of the CD marked a leap forward in audio technology, offering superior sound quality and greater storage capacity compared to vinyl records and cassette tapes. It paved the way for the digital revolution in music, changing the industry and how we listen to music forever.
