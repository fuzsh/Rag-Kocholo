        "text": "B\n\nBabylon 5 , TV series (1993 - 1998): set on a space station in the future in which Earth and humans exist and where warring factions from different planets and species often meet. Telekinetics were known as \"teeks\" in the series. There were also made-for-TV movies and spin-off series after the original series ended. See Babylon 5 media franchise.\n\n\"Mind War\" (Mar 2, 1994), the sixth episode of the first season introduced the Psi Cop character Bester (Walter Koenig, best known previously as Chekov on Star Trek), who along with fellow Psi Cop Kelsey (British model-turned-actress Felicity Waterman) arrives on the station in pursuit of a rogue former Psi Cop instructor named Jason Ironheart (William Allen Young). The latter is on the run after uncovering a joint program by Earthforce and Psi Corps to create super telepaths with telekinetic abilities to be used as human weapons. Evolving as a result of being a test subject himself, Ironhart develops uncontrollable \"mindquakes\" so powerful they shake the space station. The last scene shows the station's resident Psi Corps-licensed commercial telepath Talia Winters (Andrea Thompson) alone in her quarters moving an old Abraham Lincoln U.S. penny across a tabletop mentally as a test to see if she has any telekinetic ability, as only one in 10,000 telepaths do. However, the episode implies that in this instance her TK power was a gift from Ironhart before he evolved into a being of light and left the station.\n\n\"Secrets of the Soul\" (Mar 4, 1998), a season 5, episode 7 story that introduces the telepathic and telekinetic character Peter (Jack Hannibal), who is a stutterer with a gentle personality.\n\n\"Phoenix Rising\" (Apr 1, 1998), the character Peter returns and meets his demise with other telepaths in an explosion caused by Psi Cop Bester in this season 5, episode 11 story.\n\nBeautiful Creatures , Movie (2013): a teenage witch learns on her sixteenth birhday whether she will be a good witch or evil witch, a fate not of her choosing.

While fighting with her brother outside, she falls backward, hits her head, and develops TK powers after regaining consciousness, which she uses in comical ways to get revenge against him. This short was a black-and-white student film by young director-writer Robert Rodriguez and stars several of his family members.\n\nBelieve , TV series (2013 - 2014): a 10-year-old orphan girl named Bo, played by Johnny Sequoyah (yes, a girl with a boy's name in real life) has the powers of TK and levitation and is evolving other abilities.

She used good magic to produce various PK effects. The TV series inspired a 2005 theatrical film of the same title that starred Nicole Kidman and a spinoff half-hour comedy Tabitha (1977), about Samantha's grown-up daughter, played by blonde-haired Lisa Hartman, who had the powers of a witch, which included TK.\n\n\"A Vision of Sugar Plums\" (December 24, 1964), season one, episode 15 was set at Christmas. In it, Samantha And Darrin bring home a troubled boy named Michael from an orphanage to spend Christmas Eve and Christmas Day at their home. The boy is played by Billy Mumy (post-Twilight Zone, pre-Lost in Space). He doesn't believe in Santa Claus, so Samantha reveals she is a witch to him, magically transforms her clothing into a black gown with pointy hat and flies him and Darrin to the North Pole on her broom to meet Santa and his elves in person. Also appearing at the end of the episode is actor Bill Daly (pre-I Dream of Jeannie), who with his onscreen wife character want to adopt Michael. An excellent representative episode of the series. It was repeated as the Christmas episode the following year in 1965 and in that was included a brief new intro to frame it as a flashback episode.\n\nBeyond , TV series (2017 - 2018): a young man named Holden Matthews (Burkely Duffield) wakes up from a coma after 12 years and discovers that he has paranormal powers, including telekinesis.

Dunn) then begins to develop superpowers: levitation, heat vision, super-speed, super-strength, and invulnerability.

A tall, skinny alien character Varek (Anthony James) had the power to phase the matter in his body so that he could walk through walls and energy beam weapons passed through him. This two-part episode is a noteworthy milestone in the history of telekinesis entertainment because it appears to be the first time a character who is ordinary looking, even unattractive: balding, rough faced, overweight (these traits also describe the actor John Quade in real life) was featured in a storyline having the power to move objects with the mind; thus, providing an inspiration to the audience watching that telekinesis could be possessed by anyone, not just Hollywood handsome types. Several times during the episode Buck Rogers insults the TK villain character Quince by calling him \"Porky,\" a scripted joke. He was wearing outer clothing that made him appear even larger. Also appearing in the episode were regular players Erin Gray and Tim O'Connor and guest stars Frank Gorshin, Markie Post, James Sloyan, and Nancy DeCarl.\n\n\"Space Vampire\" (January 3, 1980): about a humanoid alien with a large head, single eyebrow, and fangs named Vorvon (Nicholas Hormann) who was visible only to his victims, whom he drained the energy from and controlled like puppets or zombies.

This episode has an interesting opening and a shocking ending.\n\n\"The Lovers\" (February 16, 1960), a playful poltergeist episode that aired two days after Valentine's Day, it was set circa 1900 in Vienna, Austria and was about a young waitress and an older retired postman who fell in love, but every time they tried to kiss for the first time, objects in their vicinity would take flight. Host John Newland ended the show by saying it was a \"nice story.\"\n\n\"Vanishing Point\" (February 23, 1960), told in a flashback and set in then present day Connecticut, Edward Bins guest stars as a husband accused of his wife's disappearance by a police lieutenant detective (Fredd Wayne). The husband had heard his despondent wife say to herself after an argument while at their country home, \"All I have to do is . . . let go, and that would be the end of me.\" After searching the house and failing to find her, he witnesses a paranormal vision, does newspaper research, and learns that two other people in the distant past also disappeared in the house. He calls the detective to the house and shows him the old newspaper story, but is met with disbelief and the detective leaves. Now severely despondent himself, he recalls what his wife had said, and wills himself gone. This episode has some good original background music as he searches the house, in addition to the usual \"One Step Beyond\" theme music. Also, host John Newland plays himself as a paranormal investigator, presumably researching story tips for this TV series, in opening and closing scenes with the detective.\n\n\"The Explorer\" (March 15, 1960), a period story about an expedition of three men lost in the hot African desert that encounters a man (Jeremy Slate) who guides them to safety, but who later disappears and is presumed dead.

This episode involves dreaming and as Newland describes it at the end, the power of teleportation (it is actually psychic bi-location).\n\n\"The Visitor\" (May 10, 1960), noteworthy for its casting of real-life major movie star Joan Fontaine and Warren Beatty in his last TV role before becoming a major movie star himself (in old age makeup for part of the story), the nighttime tale has Beatty's husband character leaving his estranged alcoholic wife (Fontaine) at their snowy mountain vacation home and driving his car off a mountain road. While unconscious, he pyschically appears to his wife back at their home as his younger self and talks about an earlier tragic time in their lives when their infant daughter died at birth, one of the causes of her subsequent drinking. At the story's conclusion, with him rescued from the car and the two reunited at the home, host John Newland's says: \"What happened to Ellen Grayson? Was it a hullucination? Was it an accident in time? Or did the unconscious Harry Grayson will himself back to the man he was to convince Ellen of his love?\"\n\n\"Moment of Hate\" (October 25, 1960), Karen Wadsworth (Joanne Linville), a female executive manager of a fashion company seeks psychiatric help after she begins to suspect that she is killing people who anger her and is doing so with the power of her mind by wishing they were dead. The psychiatrist is skeptical, right to the surprise ending.\n\n\"Justice\" (March 7, 1961), another psychic bi-location story (host John Newland incorrectly describes it as teleportation), set in and filmed in circa 1961 contemporary England about a banker whose guilty conscience while sleeping manifests as a corporeal double of himself who leads the local police to the location of his mistress's murdered body and then the buried murder weapon, a knife. Some of the background music in this episode is similar to that used years later in \"The Outer Limits,\" due to both series having the same composer, Harry Lubin.\n\n\"The Room Upstairs\" (March 21, 1961), bi-location and psychic projections are the paranormal aspects of this story set in circa 1961 contemporary England. An American electronics engineer and his wife have been sent to live and work in England. They move into a leased house where, after several strange experiences seeing and hearing two adults and a child in distress calling for her mother, they learn that long ago a young chronically ill girl died in an upstairs room one night because her parents forgot to give her the daily medicine that she needed to live. The parents learn of the new residents' experiences and return to the house, whereupon everyone hears the girl crying for help and they all rush upstairs to the room, but she is not there. Host John Newland says oncamera in the epilogue: \"How did their spectres, or living ghosts, appear in this house, reliving that terrible night, over and over? Well, there are some who say that houses retain the aura of great emotional crises. Then there's another theory, that guilty conscience can recreate and project for others to see, the compelling guilt which haunts them.\"\n\n\"The Sorcerer\" (May 23, 1961), an episode guest starring Christopher Lee as a German officer in World War I who uses a sorcerer (psychic) to mentally teleport himself 800 kilometers back home to his girlfriend's apartment in Berlin, where he kills her for being unfaithful. After teleporting back and now remorseful, he insists to his superiors that he be punished for the crime. They will not because they do not believe it is possible he could have traveled such a great distance and back from the time he was last seen. This episode is about actual point-to-point physical teleporation, not psychic bi-location.\n\n\"The Tiger\" (June 20, 1961), set in England, a little girl (Pamela Weldon) who is being persecuted by a mean governess, wishes a real-life version of her small stuffed tiger into existence that then commits acts of destruction in the mansion at night and then finally protects the child when the governess is about to beat her with a wooden board in the darkened cellar \"punishment room.\" Though there is physical evidence of the creature's existence, such as scratchings, damaged items, and golden hairs, the tiger is never actually seen onscreen, only heard. Host John Newland explains it this way in the opening: \"This rarity of psychic penomenon doesn't even have a name. For 'mind over matter' doesn't even begin to explain what happened in this house. Can the human mind create that which is not?\" More of a mild horror story, the ending delivers a satisfactory fright for the viewer.\n\nThe Outer Limits , TV series (1963 - 1965): episodes that featured PK:\n\n\"The Man With the Power\" (October 7, 1963) featured actor Donald Pleasance as a scientist whose mind implant gives him deadly telekinetic powers.

The drug also causes him to become evil. Like the episode \"The Man With the Power,\" this one was kept out of those syndicated for reruns in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s and only became available when cable networks began and home video.\n\n\"The Inheritors Part One and Part Two\" (November 21, 28, 1964) A U.S. Government agent named Ballard played by Robert Duvall investigates four soldiers who were shot in the head in battle by bullets made by a meteorite and who now seem to be on a mission to build a spaceship as their IQs increase greatly. Steve Ihnat plays Lieutenant Minns. In a hospital scene in Part One, Minns appears to know psychically that Ballard is about to enter his room. In Part Two, agents try to prevent Minns from leaving a room by shooting him at point blank range. The bullets have no effect on him, suggesting that they were psychokinetically disintergrated in mid air.\n\nThe Outer Limits , TV series (1995 - 2002): PK/TK episodes:\n\n\"The Choice\" (S01 EP06, April 28, 1995) features actress Thora Birch as a young girl struggling with newfound telekinetic powers.

In the opening scene, two hikers from a distance record footage of the 30-something man miraculously healing a collapsed injured girl in the woods with the familiar hand-to-body light-glow effect common to paranormal healers in both film and television. The footage is shown on the news by a reporter, the man is captured by the government, and by episode's end, he is back in the woods rising into the sky in front of witnesses. The narration and script overall posit the question, was this an alien god who returned to earth after 2,000 years? The character Josh is played by actor Alex McArthur. Actress Kate Vernon plays the TV reporter.\n\n\"Monster\" (S04 EP18, July 10, 1998), about a group of government psychic assassins who can kill a human target, particularly terrorist leaders, anywhere in the world by watching him on live television in an underground facility and activating their long-distance TK ability in a jointly concentrated effort.
