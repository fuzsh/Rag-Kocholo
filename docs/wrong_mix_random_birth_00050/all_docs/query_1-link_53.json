Title: Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Chief Administrative Officer ATTEST: /s/ Deborah Chapin ................................ Assistant Secretary\n\nCUSIP No. 925524142 VIACOM INC. No. Certificate for Variable Common Rights This certifies that , or registered assigns (the \"Holder\"), is the owner of the number of Variable Common Rights (\"VCRs\") of Viacom Inc., a Delaware corporation (the \"Company\"), set forth above. Each VCR entitles the Holder, subject to the provisions contained herein, to convert such VCR into shares of the Class B Common Stock, par value $.01 per share (the \"Class B Common Stock\"), of the Company or any other capital stock of the Company into which the Class B Common Stock may be converted or reclassified or that may be issued in respect of, in exchange for, or in substitution of, the Class B Common Stock. Such number of shares of Class B Common Stock, if any, into which each VCR will convert shall be determined by the Company pursuant to the provisions set forth on the reverse hereof and written notice thereof shall be provided to the Holders of the VCRs promptly after the VCR Conversion Date (as defined below). The Company's determination of the number of shares, if any, of Class B Common Stock into which each VCR will convert shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error. Such conversion shall be made on _________ , 1995 (the \"VCR Conversion Date\"). Under certain circumstances, as described on the reverse hereof, the Holders of VCRs will not be entitled to any additional shares of Class B Common Stock on the VCR Conversion Date and this VCR Certificate and the VCRs represented hereby will expire on the VCR Conversion Date. The transfer of the VCRs represented by this VCR Certificate is registerable on the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this VCR Certificate for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, which initially shall be ____________, or at any other office or agency maintained by the Company for such purpose, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new VCR Certificates, for the same number of VCRs, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. In no case, however, shall the Company be required to issue fractional VCRs. Conversion of the VCRs represented hereby into shares of Class B Common Stock, if any, pursuant to this VCR Certificate shall be made only upon presentation and surrender of this VCR Certificate by the Holder hereof, in person or by duly authorized attorney, at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at any other office or agency maintained by the Company for such purpose. 2 This VCR Certificate and the rights evidenced hereby are issued and held subject to the laws of the State of Delaware, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended to the date hereof and as the same may be further amended and restated from time to time, and the By-Laws of the Company, as amended to the date hereof and as the same may be further amended and restated from time to time. Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this VCR Certificate set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this VCR Certificate to be executed and attested by the facsimile signatures of its duly authorized officers under its corporate seal. Dated: VIACOM INC. Attest: By ---------------------------- [SEAL] ------------------------------ Authorized Signature REVERSE OF VCR CERTIFICATE Each VCR represents the right to receive, subject to the provisions contained herein, shares of Class B Common Stock on the VCR Conversion Date. Such number of shares, if any, will be determined by the Company in accordance with the provisions herein and, under certain circumstances, as described below, the Holders of VCRs will not be entitled to any additional shares of Class B Common Stock and this VCR Certificate and the VCRs represented hereby will expire on the VCR Conversion Date. The number of shares of Class B Common Stock, if any, into which each VCR shall be convertible will be calculated as follows: Determination of Conversion Value. Subject to the limitation on conversion value described below, a value for Viacom Class B Common Stock (the \"Class B Value\") will be determined in the 90 qualified trading day period immediately preceding the VCR Conversion Date (the \"Alternative VCR Valuation Period\"). The Class B Value will equal the average closing price on the American Stock Exchange (or such other exchange on which shares of Class B Common Stock are then listed) for one share of Class B Common Stock during any 30 consecutive qualified trading days in the Alternative VCR Valuation Period which yield the highest such average closing price. The Class B Value will determine the number of shares, if any, into which each VCR shall be converted (a \"VCR Conversion Value\"), as set forth below: Class B Value VCR Conversion Value ------------- -------------------- (expressed as a fraction of one share of Class B Common Stock) $0 to $35.99 . . . 0.13829 $35 to $40 . . . . 30 - 0.32 minus 0.08 minus 0.60615 --------------- Class B Value $40.01 to $47.99 . 0.05929 $48 to $52 . . . . 36 - 0.32 minus 0.08 minus 0.60615 --------------- Class B Value $52.01 and above . 0 (Zero) The dollar amounts set forth in the above table under the caption entitled \"Class B Value\" are each a \"Class B Conversion Value\". The number of shares of Class B Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the VCRs and collectively, the numbers in the formula used to determine such amount, each as set forth under the caption entitled \"VCR Conversion Value\" are each a \"VCR Conversion Value\". Each such Class B Conversion Value and VCR Conversion Value, as it may have been previously adjusted, shall be adjusted upon each occurrence of an event described below under \"Adjustments\". Limitation on Conversion Value. Notwithstanding the determination of VCR Conversion Value described above, if at any time during the period from _______, 1994 (the 2 \"Issue Date\") until the VCR Conversion Date the average closing price for a share of Class B Common Stock on the American Stock Exchange (or such other exchange on which shares of Class B Common Stock are then listed) for any 30 qualified consecutive trading days is: (a) above $40 (a \"Class B Conversion Value\"), then the maximum conversion value for each VCR will equal 0.05929 (a \"VCR Conversion Value\") of one share of Class B Common Stock or (b) above $52 (a \"Class B Conversion Value\"), then the VCRs will have no value and will automatically terminate. Each such Class B Conversion Value and VCR Conversion Value, as it may have been previously adjusted, shall be adjusted upon each occurrence of an event as described below under \"Adjustments\". For the purposes of determining any period of qualified trading days, a trading day is not qualified if (i) with respect to a day during the first month following the Issue Date, fewer than 400,000 shares of Class B Common Stock trade on such day, (ii) with respect to a day during the second month following the Issue Date, fewer than 300,000 shares of Class B Common Stock trade on such day, (iii) with respect to a day during the third month following the Issue Date, fewer than 250,000 shares of Class B Common Stock trade on such day and (iv) with respect to a day from and after the first day of the fourth month following the Issue Date, fewer than 200,000 shares of Class B Common Stock trade on such day. Otherwise, each trading day will be qualified. In the event that the Company determines that the VCRs are not convertible into any shares of Class B Common Stock on the VCR Conversion Date, the Company shall give to the Holders of the VCRs notice of such determination. Upon making such determination, absent manifest error, this VCR Certificate shall terminate and become null and void and the Holder hereof shall have no further rights with respect hereto. The failure to give such notice or any defect therein shall not affect the validity of such determination. Prior to the time of due presentment of this VCR Certificate for registration of transfer, the Company and any agent of the Company may treat the person in whose name this VCR Certificate is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and neither the Company nor any agent of the Company shall be affected by notice to the contrary. The Company may, but shall not be required to, issue fractional shares of Class B Common Stock on conversion of the VCRs. In lieu of a fractional share, the Company may, at its option, make a cash payment for the fraction based on the average closing prices of the Class B Common Stock for the 15 consecutive trading day period, the first day of which shall be the twentieth trading day prior to the conversion. Except as set forth herein with respect to adjustments, this VCR Certificate confers no rights with respect to any dividends declared by the Company on the Class B Common Stock to holders of record on a record date prior to the VCR Conversion Date. Adjustments Each Class B Conversion Value will be reduced by a percentage equal to any percentage decline in excess of 25% in the Standard & Poor's 400 Index from the Issue Date until the VCR Conversion Date. 3 The Class B Conversion Values and the VCR Conversion Values shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in certain events, including (i) the payment of a dividend or other distribution by the Company to its stockholders in shares of Class B Common Stock, (ii) the sub-division (by stock split, stock dividend or otherwise) or combination (by reverse stock split or otherwise) of the outstanding Class B Common Stock or (iii) the issuance by reclassification of shares of Class B Common Stock. Upon each such event, the Company shall appropriately adjust the Class B Conversion Values and VCR Conversion Values. Whenever an adjustment is made as provided herein, the Company shall (i) promptly prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment and a brief statement of the facts accounting for such adjustment and (ii) mail a brief summary thereof to each Holder of a VCR. Such adjustment, absent manifest error, shall be final and binding on the Holder hereof. Each outstanding VCR Certificate shall thereafter be deemed to be amended to provide for the adjusted Class B Conversion Values and VCR Conversion Values. No adjustment to the Class B Conversion Values and VCR Conversion Values is required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in such values, but any adjustments which are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. THE COMPANY WILL FURNISH WITHOUT CHARGE, TO EACH HOLDER WHO SO REQUESTS, THE POWERS, DESIGNATIONS, PREFERENCES AND RELATIVE, PARTICIPATING, OPTIONAL OR OTHER SPECIAL RIGHTS OF EACH CLASS OF STOCK OR SERIES THEREOF OF THE COMPANY, AND THE QUALIFICATIONS, LIMITATIONS OR RESTRICTIONS OF SUCH PREFERENCES AND/OR RIGHTS.

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Registration Statement. The VCRs will be governed by a certificate (the \"VCR Certificate\") in the form included in the Registration Statement as Exhibit 4.3. In so acting, we have examined the Registration Statement including the joint proxy statement/prospectus (the \"Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus\") contained therein and the VCR Certificate. We have also examined and relied as to factual matters upon the representations and warranties contained in originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records, documents, certificates and other instruments as in our judgment are necessary or appropriate to enable us to render the opinions expressed below. In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the Viacom Inc. 2 August 25, 1994 authenticity of all documents, certificates and instruments submitted to us as originals and the conformity with originals of all documents submitted to us as copies. In connection with these opinions, we have assumed that each of the following shall occur on or prior to the issuance of the Class A Common Stock, the Class B Common Stock, the VCRs and the Additional Class B Common Stock: (a) the holders of shares of Viacom Class A Common Stock approve and adopt the Merger Agreement (including the issuance of the Merger Consideration) at the Viacom Special Meeting; (b) the holders of shares of Blockbuster Common Stock approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the Blockbuster Special Meeting; and (c) there shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the \"Certificate of Merger Merging Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation with and into Viacom Inc.\" in the form set forth in Annex VIII to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The opinions expressed below are limited to the law of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of Delaware and the federal law of the United States, and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any other law. Based upon the foregoing, and having regard for such legal considerations as we have deemed relevant, we are of the opinion that: 1. The Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock will be duly authorized by the Company and, when issued by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock will be validly issued, fully paid and non- assessable. 2. The VCRs will be duly authorized by the Company, and when (a) the VCR Certificates have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and (b) the VCRs have been duly issued by the Company as contemplated by the Merger Agreement in accordance with the provisions of the VCR Certificates, the VCRs will be validly issued and will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with the terms of the VCR Certificates. 3. The Additional Class B Common Stock will be duly authorized by the Company and, when issued by the Company in accordance with the provisions of the VCR Certificates, the Additional Class B Common Stock will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. The opinion set forth in paragraph 2 above is subject to (i) the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating to Viacom Inc. 3 August 25, 1994 fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the reference to us under the headings \"The Merger -- Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences\" and \"Experts -- Legal Opinions\" contained in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

Unless otherwise defined, capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that at the Effective Time, Blockbuster will be merged with and into Viacom in accordance with Delaware law. As a result of the Merger the separate corporate existence of Blockbuster will cease and Viacom will continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger. By virtue of the Merger, each share of Blockbuster Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Blockbuster Common Stock held in the treasury of Blockbuster, owned by Viacom or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Viacom or of Blockbuster and other than any Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.08 of one share of Viacom Class A Common Stock, (ii) 0.60615 of one share of Viacom Class B Common Stock and (iii) up to an additional 0.13829 of one share of Viacom Class B Common Stock, with such amount to be determined in accordance with, and the right to receive such shares to be evidenced by, one VCR. In delivering our opinion, we have reviewed the Merger Agreement and have assumed that the representations and warranties therein are and will remain true, correct and 2 complete and that the parties have complied with and will continue to comply with the covenants therein. In addition, we have reviewed the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and have assumed that the statements therein are and will remain true, correct and complete. We have also relied on the representations made by Viacom and Blockbuster in letters to us dated August 25, 1994. We have also assumed, based upon discussions with the management of Viacom or Blockbuster, as appropriate, that (i) neither Viacom nor Blockbuster is an investment company within the meaning of Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) of the Code; (ii) the sum of the amount of cash, if any, paid to stockholders with respect to Dissenting Shares and the value of the VCRs exchanged in the Merger will be less than 50% of the total value of the Blockbuster Common Stock outstanding as of the date of the Merger; (iii) the total adjusted tax basis of the assets of Blockbuster transferred to Viacom will equal or exceed the sum of the liabilities assumed by Viacom plus the amount of the liabilities, if any, to which the transferred assets are subject; and (iv) that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the Merger Agreement. Based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and our consideration of other pertinent authorities, all as in effect on the date hereof, we are of the opinion that the discussion in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus under the caption \"THE MERGER -- Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences,\" insofar as it relates to matters of federal income tax law, is a fair and accurate summary of such matters. We express no opinion (i) as to whether such description addresses all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be applicable to Viacom, Blockbuster or any particular Blockbuster stockholder or (ii) as to the U.S. federal, state, local, foreign or other tax consequences, other than as set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus under the caption \"THE MERGER -- Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences.\" We consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and to the reference to Shearman & Sterling under the caption \"THE MERGER -- Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences\" in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Very truly yours, /s/ SHEARMAN & STERLING EBH\n\n[LETTERHEAD OF SKADDEN, ARPS, SLATE, MEAGHER & FLOM] August 26, 1994 Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation One Blockbuster Plaza Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33301 Gentlemen: We have acted as counsel to Blockbuster Enter- tainment Corporation (\"Blockbuster\"), a Delaware corpora- tion, in connection with (i) the Merger, as defined and described in the Agreement and Plan of Merger between Viacom Inc. (\"Viacom\"), a Delaware corporation, and Blockbuster, dated as of January 7, 1994, as amended as of June 15, 1994 (the \"Merger Agreement\") and (ii) the preparation and filing of the Joint Proxy State- ment/Prospectus, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 29, 1994 (the \"Joint Proxy State- ment/Prospectus\"), under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Unless otherwise indicated, each defined term has the meaning ascribed to it in the Merger Agreement. In the Merger, each share of Common Stock, par value $.10 per share, of Blockbuster (other than shares held by Viacom, Blockbuster and, if appraisal rights are available under Delaware Law, those holders who demand and perfect appraisal rights) will be converted into the right to receive 0.08 of a share of Class A Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of Viacom, 0.60615 of a share of Class B common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of Viacom and up to an additional 0.13829 of a share of Viacom Class B Common Stock evidenced by one variable common right of Viacom (a \"VCR\"). In connection with this opinion, we have exam- ined and are familiar with originals and copies, certi- Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation One Blockbuster Plaza Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33301 August 26, 1994 Page 2 fied or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of (i) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and (ii) such other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate in order to enable us to render the opinion below. In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as origi- nals, the conformity to original documents of all docu- ments submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. We have assumed, based upon discussions with Blockbuster management, that (i) neither Viacom nor Blockbuster is an investment company within the meaning of Section 368(a) (2)(F)(iii) of the Code, (ii) the sum of the amount of cash, if any, paid to stockholders with respect to Dissenting Shares and the value of VCRs exchanged in the Merger will be less than 50% of the total value of the Blockbuster Common Stock outstanding as of the date of the Merger, and (iii) the total adjusted tax basis of the assets of Blockbuster transferred to Viacom will equal or exceed the sum of the liabilities assumed by Viacom plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which the transferred assets are subject. Based upon these assumptions and subject to (i) the Merger being consummated in the manner de- scribed in the Merger Agreement, (ii) the accuracy of the facts concerning the Merger that have come to our atten- tion during our engagement and (iii) certain representa- tions made by Blockbuster and Viacom in connection with the issuance of our opinion, including the representa- tions contained in their respective letters to us, dated August 25, 1994, we are of the opinion that the discus- sion in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus under the heading \"Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences,\" inso- far as it relates to matters of federal income tax law applicable to Blockbuster or to holders of Blockbuster Common Stock, is a fair and accurate summary of such mat- ters. We express no opinion as to whether such descrip- tion addresses all of the U.S. federal income tax conse- quences of the Merger that may be Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation One Blockbuster Plaza Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33301 August 26, 1994 Page 3 applicable to any particular stockholder or Blockbuster. In addition, we express no opinion as to the U.S. federal, state, or local, or foreign or other tax consequences, other than as set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus under the heading \"Certain Federal Income Tax Consequenc- es.\" This letter is furnished to you solely for use in connection with the Merger, as described in the Merger Agreement, and is not to be used, circulated, quoted, or otherwise referred to for any other purposes without our express written permission. We hereby consent to the use of this opinion as an exhibit to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and to the reference to our firm under the heading \"Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences\" in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the 1933 Act. Very truly yours, /s/ SKADDEN, ARPS, SLATE, MEAGHER & FLOM"
