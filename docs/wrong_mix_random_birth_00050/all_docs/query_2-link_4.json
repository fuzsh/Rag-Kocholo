        "text": "Today is Tuesday, March 8, the 68th day of 2016. There are 298 days left in the year.\n\nToday's Highlight in History: On March 8, 1966, Nelson's Pillar, a 120-foot-high column in Dublin honoring British naval hero Horatio Nelson, was bombed by the Irish Republican Army.\n\nOn this date: In 1702, England's Queen Anne acceded to the throne upon the death of King William III.\n\nIn 1854, U.S. Commodore Matthew C. Perry made his second landing in Japan; within a month, he concluded a treaty with the Japanese.\n\nIn 1874, the 13th president of the United States, Millard Fillmore, died in Buffalo, New York, at age 74.\n\nIn 1917, Russia's \"February Revolution\" (referring to the Old Style calendar) began in Petrograd; the result was the abdication of the Russian monarchy in favor of a provisional government.

(All four were eventually released.)\n\nIn 1996, the Coen Brothers' black comedy \"Fargo\" was placed in limited release by Gramercy Pictures.\n\nIn 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, a Boeing 777 with 239 people on board, vanished during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, setting off a massive search. (To date, the fate of the jetliner and its occupants has yet to be determined.)\n\nTen years ago: Iran threatened the United States with \"harm and pain\" if the U.S. tried to use the U.N. Security Council to punish Tehran for its suspect nuclear program. Six months after Hurricane Katrina, President George W. Bush got a close-up look at the remaining mountains of debris, abandoned homes and boarded-up businesses in New Orleans. The Hornets played their first game at The New Orleans Arena since Katrina; they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers, 113-107. NFL owners agreed to the players' union proposal, extending the collective bargaining agreement for six years.\n\nFive years ago: Voters in Bell, California, went to the polls in huge numbers and threw out the entire City Council after most of its members had been charged with fraud. (Residents were infuriated to find out that former City Manager Robert Rizzo had been receiving an annual salary of $1.5 million, and that four of the five City Council members had paid themselves $100,000 to meet about once a month.)\n\nOne year ago: Thousands of people crowded the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Alabama, many jammed shoulder to shoulder, to commemorate a bloody confrontation 50 years earlier between police and peaceful protesters that helped bring about the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
