Her magnetic personality, stunning looks, and captivating performances captivated audiences around the world. Despite a difficult upbringing and personal struggles, Marilyn Monroe remains a symbol of beauty, sexuality, and glamour to this day. Early Life and Career: Marilyn Monroe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson on June 1, 1926, in Los Angeles, California. Her mother, Gladys Baker, was mentally unstable, and her father was unknown. As a result, Marilyn spent much of her childhood in foster care, moving from one family to another. She attended several different schools, but she struggled academically and eventually dropped out of high school. In 1942, at the age of 16, Marilyn married her first husband, James Dougherty. She took a job at a munitions factory during World War II and later worked as a model. In 1946, she signed a contract with Twentieth Century Fox and changed her name to Marilyn Monroe. She began appearing in small roles in films such as \"The Shocking Miss Pilgrim\" and \"Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay!\". Rise to Fame: In 1950, Marilyn's career took off when she played a small but memorable role in the film \"The Asphalt Jungle.\" Her breakout role came the following year when she starred in \"All About Eve\" alongside Bette Davis. However, it was her role in the 1953 film \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\" that solidified her status as a Hollywood icon. The film's famous musical number \"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\" became an instant classic. Over the next few years, Marilyn starred in several other popular films, including \"How to Marry a Millionaire,\" \"The Seven Year Itch,\" and \"Some Like It Hot.\" Her performances were often praised for their comedic timing and vulnerability, and she quickly became one of the most sought-after actresses in Hollywood. Personal Life: Despite her professional success, Marilyn struggled with personal demons throughout her life. She was married three times, first to James Dougherty, then to baseball legend Joe DiMaggio, and finally to playwright Arthur Miller. She also had several high-profile affairs, including one with President John F. Kennedy. Marilyn's struggles with mental health and addiction were well documented. She suffered from depression and anxiety, and she often turned to prescription drugs to cope. She also struggled with insomnia, which led to her dependence on sleeping pills. Her erratic behavior and public outbursts made headlines, and her personal life was constantly scrutinized by the media. Tragically, Marilyn died on August 5, 1962, at the age of 36. Her death was ruled a suicide by overdose, although some conspiracy theories suggest that she was murdered. Her passing was a shock to the world, and she remains an enduring cultural icon. Legacy: Marilyn Monroe's impact on popular culture is immeasurable. More : newbiepronews.com"
