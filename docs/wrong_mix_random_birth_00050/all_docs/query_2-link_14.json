        "text": "Ooo… my first Spark! on the shiny new community! Happy Friday Y’all!\n\nToday in History:\n\nMarch 8, 1979\n\nPhilips, the Dutch multinational conglomerate corporation, unveiled a revolutionary product to the world at a press conference held in Eindhoven, Netherlands. The Compact Disc (CD), a digital optical disc data storage format that would transform the way we consume music and eventually how we play video games.\n\nThis event was the result of a collaboration between Sony and Philips. The two tech giants joined forces to standardize the specifications of the CD. They agreed upon a disc with a diameter of 12 cm, a decision driven by a rather musical rationale. This size was chosen specifically because it could hold enough audio data to accommodate Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, which runs for 74 minutes. This decision ensured that the CD would have sufficient capacity to contain a full-length musical performance, setting a new standard for audio storage.\n\nThe introduction of the CD marked a leap forward in audio technology, offering superior sound quality and greater storage capacity compared to vinyl records and cassette tapes. It paved the way for the digital revolution in music, changing the industry and how we listen to music forever.\n\nRead More\n\nAlso of interest on March 8th\n\n1910 – French aviator Raymonde de Laroche becomes the first woman to receive a pilot’s license.\n\n1917 – International Women’s Day protests in Petrograd mark the beginning of the February Revolution (February 23 in the Julian calendar).\n\n1917 – The United States Senate votes to limit filibusters by adopting the cloture rule.\n\n1924 – A mine disaster kills 172 coal miners near Castle Gate, Utah.\n\n1936 – Daytona Beach and Road Course holds its first oval stock car race.\n\n1950 – The iconic Volkswagen Type 2 “Bus” begins production.\n\n1966 – Nelson’s Pillar in Dublin, Ireland, destroyed by a bomb.\n\n1979 – Images taken by Voyager I proved the existence of volcanoes on Io, a moon of Jupiter.\n\n2014 – In one of aviation’s greatest mysteries, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, carrying a total of 239 people, disappears en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
