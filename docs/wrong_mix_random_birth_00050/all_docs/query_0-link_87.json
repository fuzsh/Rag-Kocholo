        "text": "Providing Aid, and Respect\n\nBy Marcia C. Dibble\n\nSonal Singh Wadhwa BS’01 is chief executive officer of the nonprofit Maitri India, which works to assist some of that country’s most vulnerable populations. Maitri is the Sanskrit word for loving-kindness, compassion, and friendship. Maitri India’s initiatives include improving the health and welfare of migrant populations, such as rickshaw pullers and the homeless; running a counseling and testing center for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections; and providing support for abandoned elderly widows. Other projects include addressing domestic violence and providing educational and skill-enhancement opportunities for underprivileged children and women. “The work that Maitri does has an extremely real and deep impact on the lives of the people that we touch,” says Singh Wadhwa.\n\nMaitri was founded in 2005 by Sonal’s mother, Winnie Singh, and her stepfather, retired General Bhopinder Singh, with the initial goal of generating much-needed awareness among armed forces personnel and their families about health risks such as sexually transmitted infections and tuberculosis. Following its success in this effort, the organization expanded its reach.Singh Wadhwa joined Maitri in 2006, shortly after its founding, when her family was looking for someone to run the organization. “It seemed like a natural fit,” she says. “I was burnt out at my previous job as a consultant and felt very strongly that if I was working that hard, it needed to have a real impact on people’s lives.”\n\nWith a bachelor’s degree in finance from the University of Utah and an MBA from the Thunderbird School of Global Management, Singh Wadhwa had most recently been working as a consultant with Hewitt Associates (now Aon Hewitt). She had come to the U after finishing high school in India, at the encouragement of Ted Wilson BS’64, longtime director of the U’s Hinckley Institute of Politics and a close friend of her family. It was at the U that Singh Wadhwa had her first experiences working with vulnerable and/or disadvantaged groups, volunteering with Primary Children’s Hospital as well as the American Red Cross. “These experiences contributed to building a sense of understanding that there is much that a single individual can do to alleviate the suffering of another.”\n\nAfter graduating from the U, Singh Wadhwa spent a year as a business information specialist with McKinsey Knowledge Center before becoming a business correspondent with Dow Jones Newswires for more than two years. She then embarked on her MBA, and after its completion in 2004, spent more than two years as a human resources and benefits consultant with Hewitt.\n\nAmong its many endeavors, Maitri India works to provide migrant workers and the homeless with forms of identification. “For many individuals, this may be the first time that they have any document that gives them an identity, access to government benefits, and a voice when it comes to voting,” Singh Wadhwa says. Maitri also makes other efforts for this group such as public health assistance for sexually transmitted infections, including workshops and testing services, as well as street plays to increase awareness and aid in prevention.\n\nIn Project Jeevan, Maitri provides destitute widows with a cooked meal once a day so they don’t need to beg for food on the streets, where they are left to survive until they die, Singh Wadhwa says. “These women have faced complete rejection from their families and the society. And working and earning money isn’t an option for many of them, because they are so frail in health.” Maitri also provides the women with potable water and dietary supplements, blankets and clothing, access to shelter and healthcare, and other essentials, as well as arranging funeral services per their religious preferences, when the time comes.\n\nMaitri’s work with children includes facilitating workshops in schools, as well as providing scholarships and directly teaching courses. Maitri currently instructs more than 80 children ages 4 to 17. The younger students study English, Hindi, and math, and older students also receive support in science, economics, and career counseling. Many of the children come from families where both parents left school early and work as daily wage earners or in homes as drivers or cleaning help. “It’s always a cause for celebration when we have underprivileged children from our supportive education program making it to college or medical school or to the Army,” says Singh Wadhwa. “These are dreams that we have had to work hard to make the kids believe in, and it’s a victory for us as much for them when it comes true.”\n\nSince 2007, the U’s Hinckley Institute of Politics has coordinated an internship program with Maitri every semester. Singh Wadhwa often works directly with the U interns, who help with a range of projects including the organization’s annual report, newsletter, website, grant proposal development and writing, background research for projects, and even development and execution of new projects. Kirk Jowers BA’92, current director of the Hinckley Institute, also serves on Maitri’s international advisory board. “Many of our programs became possible because of the initiatives or the hard work that our interns took upon themselves in the initial years,” says Singh Wadhwa.\n\n“The most fulfilling part of this work is the intangible—what can’t be measured,” she notes. “When we go to our communities and they greet us with immense joy, I know that we are doing something right.”\n\n—Marcia Dibble is managing editor of Continuum.\n\nWeb Exclusive Photo Gallery\n\n[nggallery id=55]\n\nA Horse’s Best Friend\n\nBy Ann Floor\n\nScott Beckstead JD’91 grew up in Twin Falls, Idaho, surrounded by goats, cattle, cats, dogs, rabbits, hamsters, gerbils, turtles—and horses. “I loved all my pets dearly,” he says. “They were my best friends, and given the choice, I preferred to spend my time with them.” So it was no surprise that as an adult, after obtaining a juris doctorate from the University of Utah’s S.J. Quinney College of Law, he opened his own firm on the Oregon coast and practiced civil law for 17 years, including numerous animal-related cases, and he co-authored a casebook on animal law. Over time, he became known as a leading national expert in animal law.\n\nIn 2008, the Humane Society of the United States and the Fund for Animals established the Duchess Sanctuary, a 1,120-acre home for nearly 200 formerly abused and neglected horses, in northern Douglas County, Oregon. Beckstead, with his lifelong passion for horses, experience growing up on his family’s ranch property in Idaho, and his expertise in rescuing and caring for abused and neglected animals as the leader of a local nonprofit animal rescue and foster care group in Oregon, was a natural choice to oversee the arrival of the horses and the opening of the sanctuary.\n\nThe Duchess Sanctuary is now considered a national model for the care of rescued horses. After Beckstead got the sanctuary up and running, a ranch manager was hired to take over its operations. Beckstead then moved in late 2008 into the position of Oregon senior state director of the Humane Society of the United States, where his advocacy and political skills have helped the group protect the state’s animals.\n\nIn 2009, Beckstead helped lead lobbying efforts that convinced state lawmakers to pass one of the toughest puppy-mill laws in the nation. In 2011, he successfully worked to urge lawmakers to pass a bill to ban the possession and transfer of shark fins, a measure which has been copied in other states and countries as part of the global effort to protect the world’s shark populations. During Oregon’s 2013 legislative session, his group’s efforts prevailed as the state passed several animal protection laws, including restrictions on the amount of time dogs can be tethered, a ban on rodeo horse tripping (where a lasso is used to snare a horse’s legs— already prohibited by mainstream rodeos in 11 other states, but still a major problem in Oregon), and enhanced penalties for aggravated animal neglect. Beckstead is working with law enforcement officials to ensure that the new laws are fairly and uniformly enforced.\n\nBeckstead, who also now teaches animal law as an adjunct professor at Willamette University, often is called upon by the Humane Society of the United States to serve as a national equine expert. He is a frequent speaker and presenter at equine welfare events and often assists the organization in its fight to stop the slaughter of American horses for human consumption. As he did in Oregon, Beckstead is working with other states to pass bans on horse tripping. He helped the city of Portland pass improved regulations to protect the welfare of carriage horses, and that experience and knowledge is coming to bear in other communities, including Salt Lake City. “It can be difficult to see the terrible things that people do to animals,” he says. “But the flip side is that I am well-equipped to jump in and fight to end animal cruelty, regardless of whether it takes the form of individual criminal acts in my own community, or institutionalized cruelty in places like factory farms and research laboratories across the nation.”\n\nIn addition to his animal welfare work, Beckstead served as mayor of Waldport, Oregon, from 2002 to 2007. He considers his education at the University of Utah’s College of Law to be one of his “most cherished assets,” he says. “I was encouraged by my professors to think critically and be a relentless advocate, and that training has paid off in the form of laws that will lead to a kinder and more compassionate world for animals.”\n\n—Ann Floor is an associate editor of Continuum.\n\n’50s\n\nJeanette Misaka BS’52 MS’71, an emeritus clinical professor in the University of Utah’s Department of Special Education, was a recipient of the Japanese Foreign Minister’s Commendation for 2013. She was one of two individuals selected from within the jurisdiction of the Consulate General of Japan in Denver. Misaka was recognized for her outstanding contributions to the promotion of mutual understanding and goodwill between the people of Japan and the United States. As a former university educator specializing in cultural diversity, Misaka has worked to promote the rights of women, the disabled, and racial minorities, particularly Japanese American citizens. A member of the advisory council of the Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation, Misaka experienced the internment of Japanese American citizens during World War II at Heart Mountain Internment Camp. She has been a dedicated member of the Japanese American Citizens League since the early 1950s and currently serves as a national league board member and as governor of its Intermountain District Council.

The signs are designed to change color and thereby allow each control station to communicate in ways never done before at NASA. The project can be traced back to an earlier one he did while a graduate student in the U’s College of Pharmacy. In 2006, he and his fellow students renovated a deteriorating outdoor courtyard of the college’s Skaggs Hall, using bricks engraved by Geraci, for their senior class gift. They used money raised from engraving supporters’ names on the bricks to establish an endowed Class of 2006 Service Scholarship Fund.\n\nKevin G.

Pershing in July announced new measures to ensure student athletes have multiple outlets to report inappropriate behavior. Pershing acted after an independent investigation revealed deficiencies in the current system.\n\nIn March, the University’s Board of Trustees hired three attorneys as independent investigators to explore allegations of physical and psychological abuse by former U coach Greg Winslow within the University’s swimming and diving program. The final report—compiled by investigators Alan Sullivan JD’74, John Nielsen BS’67 JD’69, and Michael Glazier—was made public in July after a three-month, comprehensive investigation. To gather their information, the investigators interviewed 53 witnesses. Eleven people declined to be interviewed, including some former students and their parents who had complained about Winslow’s coaching methods and who told the investigators they would not meet unless the investigators agreed to a list of preconditions, which the investigators found “unacceptable,” according to the report. Thirteen more people did not respond to the investigators’ requests for an interview.\n\nThe investigation found “isolated instances” of physical abuse and a pattern of psychological abuse by the coach, who was an alcoholic, Sullivan said during a July news conference to announce the findings of the inquiry. Winslow was the U’s swimming coach from 2007 until he was suspended this past February, and his contract was allowed to lapse this summer.\n\n“After thoroughly reviewing this report, it is clear to me the Athletics Department failed to properly support its students,” Pershing says. “While the administration did place Winslow on a performance improvement plan after several complaints about his coaching techniques, a communications breakdown allowed Winslow’s personal problems to disrupt the program and create an unnecessary, uncomfortable, and inappropriate environment for our student athletes. This is unacceptable.”\n\nPershing has been working with U Athletics Director Chris Hill MEd’74 PhD’82 and the Athletics Department to implement appropriate change. Pershing says he is confident Hill and his staff are fully dedicated to taking whatever steps are necessary to correct their mistakes. Hill notes that during his 26 years as the U’s athletics director, the department’s top priority has been to provide strong support for its student athletes. “As this comprehensive and independent report indicates, we could have done better,” Hill says. “I could have done better. I am ultimately responsible for all of our 400 student athletes and pledge to do a better job in the monitoring of our staff and programs.”\n\nAt a news conference in July to announce the investigators’ findings, Hill apologized: “I’m sorry. I want to apologize to any of our current or former swimmers who think I didn’t do my job.”\n\nHill has already implemented changes within his department and will now incorporate recommendations from the investigators. The enhancements include an ombudsman to Athletics who has been appointed through the Student Affairs office and will serve as a confidential conduit for student athletes. The position, held by Ryan Randall MSW’03, will report directly to the dean of students, independent of the Athletics Department. Pershing also has appointed Karen Paisley to be a faculty athletics representative and special assistant to the president, with specific direction to monitor student welfare.\n\nMembers of the Student Athlete Wellness Team have been instructed to now report instances of abusive coaching practices directly to the director of athletics. The Athletics Department also is developing written standards for safe and effective coaching methods and must ensure these standards are strictly enforced. And Hill, during the news conference, said the Athletics Department plans to do more extensive background checks when hiring coaches.\n\nThe University of Utah will also work to better ensure all employees and students are provided with information on substance abuse and how to report it. Associate Vice President Amy Wildermuth will work to verify that the proper disciplinary process is followed if substance abuse occurs, with consequences ranging from a performance improvement plan to a required leave of absence for treatment to termination.\n\nWeb Extra\n\nRead the investigators’ full report on the swimming program here.\n\nFive New Deans Appointed at the University of Utah\n\nThe University of Utah in recent months has hired five new deans, all of whom are nationally and internationally recognized scholars, researchers, and educators in their fields.\n\nRena N. D’Souza became the inaugural dean of the U’s new School of Dentistry in August, when the school also welcomed its first class of 20 students. Prior to her arrival at the U, she was a professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at Baylor College of Dentistry and served as its chairwoman from 2006 to 2012.\n\nD’Souza is known for her research in craniofacial development, genetics, tooth development, and regenerative dental medicine. As principal investigator and director of a National Institutes of Health-funded institutional research training grant, D’Souza supervised and mentored the training of dentists and scientists at the predoctoral and postdoctoral levels. She also organized a team of faculty who conceptualized and collaborated in an innovative, evidence-based dentistry curriculum for the DDS program supported by an NIH grant. D’Souza received her bachelor of dental surgery degree from the University of Bombay and was awarded her doctor of dental surgery, master’s, and doctoral degrees from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.\n\nThe U’s College of Nursing also has a new dean: Patricia G. Morton—a nationally known expert in nursing education, critical care, and cardiovascular nursing. Morton most recently worked as a professor and associate dean for academic affairs at the University of Maryland’s School of Nursing and was a Robert Wood Johnson Executive Nurse Fellow. Last fall, she was appointed as the editor of the Journal of Professional Nursing, a scholarly journal published by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, and she is the author of Critical Care Nursing: A Holistic Approach, a textbook now in its 10th edition. Morton holds undergraduate degrees in biology and nursing from Loyola College and Johns Hopkins University and obtained her master’s and doctoral degrees from the University of Maryland. She also completed the Acute Care Nurse Practitioner Program at Georgetown University’s School of Nursing.\n\nIn June, David Kieda was named dean of the U’s Graduate School. As professor and chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the U, Kieda worked closely with faculty and administrators to establish and expand the astronomy program. Kieda received his undergraduate degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his doctorate in physics from the University of Pennsylvania. He joined the University of Utah faculty in 1990 and is an internationally known researcher on the use of astronomical telescopes and observations to study the fundamental particles and forces in the universe. He was honored with the 2012 Utah Governors Medal of Science and Technology and the U’s 2013 Distinguished Scholarly and Creative Research Award.\n\nAlso in June, Alberta Davis Comer was named dean and director of the U’s J. Willard Marriott Library and University Librarian, and she assumed her new roles in August. Prior to her arrival at the U, she had served as dean and associate dean of library services at Indiana State University’s Cunningham Memorial Library since 2004.\n\nUnder her leadership, Indiana State University developed a number of innovations, including an academic library consortium across three universities (Indiana State University, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, and Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College) in partnership with a county public library to establish an integrated online library catalog system. Comer, who holds a master of library science degree from Indiana University at Bloomington, has served as editor of Indiana Libraries, published by the Indiana Library Federation, as well as editor of Cognotes, the daily paper of the American Library Association Conference.\n\nIn July, the U announced that María E. Fránquiz would become dean of the College of Education this coming January. She currently teaches qualitative research methods and bilingual teacher education at the University of Texas at Austin, where she is also an affiliate faculty member in the Center for Mexican American Studies and assistant dean of Faculty Development in the College of Education.\n\nFránquiz, who received her doctorate at the University of California at Santa Barbara, is co-editor of the Bilingual Research Journal, the premier journal in the field of bilingual education. A native of Puerto Rico, she was taught in diverse communities during her elementary and secondary education, including Panama and Germany, and says her interest in bilingual and multicultural education stems from those experiences.\n\nConstruction Begins on University’s New Law School\n\nThe University of Utah broke ground in June on a new College of Law building, which will facilitate new approaches to legal education based on more hands-on learning and skills training.\n\n“With this new building, the College of Law will advance its mission to establish a ‘teaching hospital for law’—an innovative vision for the future of legal education,” says U President David W. Pershing. “Expanded and improved facilities will enable a variety of educational tracks aimed at improving the human condition, including global justice and the evolving field of biolaw.”\n\nThe facility will feature a library integrated throughout the building, state-of-the-art training facilities, spaces for collaborative research, advanced but flexible learning technology, practice courtrooms, and a top-floor conference center. The College of Law faculty plans to use the new building to expand its already substantial commitment to community service and community-engaged learning. U law students provided almost 50,000 hours of volunteer pro bono and clinical service during the 2012-13 academic year. The new building will enable the school to continue this tradition by providing facilities for direct client interaction.\n\nThe new building also is designed to achieve LEED platinum certification, the highest designation using Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards, and will be located at the southwest corner of campus across from the Stadium TRAX station. The building is expected to be ready for the 2015-16 academic year.\n\nNew Book Details Work of Two University Ophthalmologists\n\nThe work of ophthalmologists Geoffrey Tabin and Alan Crandall, both of the University of Utah’s John A. Moran Eye Center, is detailed in a new book Second Suns, which chronicles their efforts to end preventable blindness in Nepal.\n\nTabin, an accomplished mountain climber, is a professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences and director of international ophthalmology at the Moran Eye Center. Crandall is professor and senior vice chair of ophthalmology and visual sciences, and director of the glaucoma and cataract program at the eye center. Together, they have worked with Nepalese doctor Sanduk Ruit to treat patients in one of the world’s most impoverished areas.\n\nSecond Suns (Random House, June 2013), by David Oliver Relin, co-author of Three Cups of Tea, describes their work with the Himalayan Cataract Project, an organization founded in 1995 by Tabin and Ruit to help the people of the Himalayas, who have an alarmingly high incidence of cataract blindness.\n\nSee our previous feature on Dr. Tabin here.\n\nU Technology Office Renamed to Emphasize Venture Options\n\nThe University of Utah’s Technology Commercialization Office has a new name. Now Technology & Venture Commercialization, the name change is meant to reflect the organization’s focus on commercializing inventions through partnerships with existing companies, as well as to emphasize its efforts to create new ventures. “The U has an opportunity to strengthen its leadership in successfully turning great ideas into practical applications,” says Bryan Ritchie, the organization’s executive director. The name change follows a comprehensive review of the program that also resulted in internal restructuring aimed at improving coordination and communication.\n\nProfessor Kathryn Stockton Wins 2013 Rosenblatt Prize\n\nKathryn Bond Stockton, a Distinguished Professor of English at the University of Utah, has received the Rosenblatt Prize for Excellence, the U’s most prestigious award for faculty. The $40,000 gift is presented annually to a faculty member who displays excellence in teaching, research, and administrative efforts.

She also served as director of the U’s Gender Studies Program for more than 10 years, transforming it into a nationally recognized center for scholarly inquiry.\n\nRead more about Kathryn Stockton in the Continuum feature here.\n\nUniversity Biologist Receives Second Whitley Gold Award\n\nFor the second time in five years, the United Kingdom’s Princess Anne awarded the prestigious Whitley Gold Award for conservation to Çağan Şekercioğlu. The University of Utah ornithologist and conservation biologist is the first person to have won the Whitley Gold Award twice from the Whitley Fund for Nature. He previously won in 2008, while working at Stanford University, for his efforts to safeguard bird-rich wetlands around northeast Turkey’s Kuyucuk Lake. He won the latest award for convincing Turkey’s government to create its first wildlife corridor for large carnivores such as wolves, brown bears, and Caucasian lynx.\n\nNew U Residence Hall Receives LEED Gold Certification\n\nThe University of Utah’s newest residence hall has received gold certification using Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards, making it the first LEED-certified college residence hall in Utah. The 167,000-square-foot Donna Garff Marriott Honors Residential Scholars Community exceeded minimum efficiency standards by more than 30 percent, resulting in a $55,000 annual energy savings. “We worked hard to ensure tremendous energy savings without increasing our construction budget,” says Myron Willson, director of the U’s Office of Sustainability.\n\nIN MEMORIAM\n\nCleone Peterson Eccles BS’57, a longtime U supporter who served on the Board of Trustees and the Alumni Association’s Board of Directors\n\nBrooke Hopkins, a professor emeritus of English who helped launch the U’s Writing Program\n\nBeverley Taylor Sorenson BS’45, a nationally recognized supporter of arts education\n\nMilton E.

Dibble\n\nOn their very first day as college freshmen, identical twins Lexie and Lindsay Kite MS’09 PhD’13, now 28, took their first steps down the road that led them to create Beauty Redefined, their recently founded nonprofit organization that works to help girls and women uproot limiting and harmful concepts of female beauty, value, and health.\n\nSeparately, in two different classes on “media smarts,” the twins were each introduced to critically evaluating the way women are represented in mass media, and the fact that much advertising is specifically engineered to make people feel “flawed” so that we will buy products in an endless (and fruitless) quest to “fix” ourselves. The Kites also began to see how profit-seeking messages aim to persuade women that they need to fit into one very limited conception of “beauty,” and to—literally—buy into the message that fitting into that concept should be a primary goal.\n\n“I sat in that classroom and my heart pounded faster,” Lexie Kite recalls. “I had such a powerful experience. I felt, this is true, and I have been so affected by this, I need to help other people realize this truth.” At home that night, she rushed to talk to Lindsay about it and discovered that her twin had had the same eye-opening experience in her own class.\n\nBoth were Utah State University undergraduate journalism majors at the time, Lexie in broadcast, and Lindsay in print. The sisters immediately dove into more research into popular culture and mass media and their impact on female body image and self-worth, and began looking for ways to share what they were learning. “We wanted to know how the messages affect individuals and how we might be able to help in some way,” says Lexie.\n\nStudying Naomi Wolf’s The Beauty Myth (which examines how women’s material and legal successes of the 20th century have been met with an oppressive counterweight of emphasis on and anxiety about physical appearance) and Jean Kilbourne’s Killing Us Softly (which focuses specifically on advertising imagery), Lexie recalls that the sisters thought, “It makes you mad, and then you feel like, where do I go with this, what do I do? And there wasn’t really an outlet.” So they expanded their own research “to all forms of entertainment media and profit-driven messages” and dove into “showing people how to recognize those messages, reject them, and get on to what is more important.”\n\nAt the University of Utah, the sisters delved into relevant interdisciplinary study in areas such as health promotion and education, art history, and psychology and were allowed to co-write their master’s and doctoral theses in communication.\n\nLexie’s research has focused on the ability to reject self-objectification. Lindsay, meanwhile, has honed in on promoting true physical health, as opposed to surface-level appearances or measures of health. The sisters’ graduate work became the basis for a one-hour visual presentation for their Beauty Redefined nonprofit. The presentation is regularly updated with recent examples and the latest research, with versions modified for different audiences, and the sisters have now shared it with thousands of people around the country.\n\nThe twins also maintain a Facebook page (www.facebook.com/TakeBackBeauty), which has more than 14,000 followers, and a website, http://www.beautyredefined.net/. “People have just come in droves, worldwide,” Lindsay says. “We’ve found that people are starving for this information.”\n\nTo help spread their message, and to support the nonprofit, the Kites have created a range of “uplifting slogan” products, such as cards featuring the message “You are beautiful (now go do great things!)” and sticky notes declaring “Your reflection does not define your worth.”\n\nThe twins have recently been developing curricula for use by individuals, as well as for organizations that work with both adult women and elementary-age girls. Lexie notes that their work is all the more relevant as younger generations are ever more saturated with media messages. “We want to help people at the ground level to recognize and reject the harmful messages,” she says. “Making better choices with our viewing and our pocketbooks leads to bigger changes.”\n\n—Marcia Dibble is managing editor of Continuum.\n\n’70s\n\nCarolyn B.

Overwhelmed with the hundreds of patients in the clinics and emergency rooms, he expressed concern about their care to his senior resident, who warned him that, for the sake of speed and accuracy, he needed to use a protocol in order to avoid reinventing the clinical evaluation and treatment wheel with every new patient.\n\n“You mean a cookbook?” Clawson asked, explaining that’s what protocols were called at the U. The senior resident handed him some five-by-eight cards and said, “Clawson, you can’t survive at the Big Free without one. You better take a good look at these.”\n\nClawson had spent time as an emergency medical technician and occasional dispatcher for Gold Cross Ambulance in Salt Lake City to pay his way through medical school at the U, so the suggestion from the senior resident, and his own experience as a dispatcher, led him to the realization one day that emergency medical dispatchers could be more than just clerks. With proper training and a clearly described protocol to work from, they could become professional first responders. Clawson moved back to Salt Lake City after his residency and worked in the emergency rooms at Cottonwood and LDS hospitals, and then as fire surgeon at the Salt Lake City Fire Department. And in 1978, he developed the 911 medical dispatch protocols and training. Those protocols now are used in more than 3,600 emergency dispatch centers in 43 countries.\n\nIn recognition of his pivotal contributions to emergency medical services, Clawson recently was honored with two national awards.\n\nThe National Association of EMS Physicians in January presented him with its Dr. Ronald D. Stewart Award, for making a lasting, major contribution to the EMS community nationally.\n\nClawson also was presented the J. Walter Schaefer Memorial Award of Excellence from the American Ambulance Association in November 2012, for excellence in leadership and dedication to the betterment of emergency medical services nationwide.\n\n“These are two of the most significant groups in emergency medical services, and to receive their highest awards is very humbling and fulfilling,” says Clawson.\n\nThe protocols include using a script during the initial 911 call to determine what is happening at the emergency scene. The dispatcher then utilizes a coded triage system to determine the level of emergency response needed. The caller is coached on what to do and what not to do and is given instructions for other lifesaving and safety actions. According to Clawson, the goal of the protocols is “to send the right thing, to the right person, at the right time, in the right way, and do the right things for the caller and patient until the troops arrive.”\n\nIn 1988, he co-founded the International Academies of Emergency Dispatch, which uses the protocols he developed and sets emergency response standards that are used internationally. Currently, about 55,000 dispatchers hold that group’s certification.\n\nClawson continues to oversee the group’s research, standards, and educational efforts. He also serves as chief executive officer and medical director of Priority Dispatch Corporation in Salt Lake City. Established in 1987, the corporation creates training materials to support emergency dispatch systems throughout the world.\n\n—Ann Floor is an associate editor of Continuum.\n\n’90s\n\nJon Pierpont BS’91 has been named the new executive director of the Utah Department of Workforce Services. Pierpont was appointed acting director by Governor Gary Herbert in August 2012, when caseloads were high, budgets were tight, and employee morale was low. In May, state senators voted unanimously to keep him on the job. Pierpont has spent half his life working in various capacities in the agency he now leads. After graduating from the University of Utah with a degree in sociology and an emphasis in criminology, he was hired as an eligibility case manager in 1992. By late 1993, he had been named to head the state’s central region.\n\nCecilia Romero BA’98 JD’02 has received the Utah State Bar’s Raymond S. Uno Award for the Advancement of Minorities in the Legal Profession.

Romero was instrumental in creating the Utah Minority Bar Association Diversity Pipeline Initiative, which pairs attorneys from the law firm of Holland & Hart with students from the law schools at the University of Utah and Brigham Young University.\n\nJason Mathis BS’96 MPA’02 was honored in March by the White House as a Cesar Chavez Champion of Change, along with 10 other immigration-reform activists. Mathis received the recognition for his help in promoting the Utah Compact, a declaration of five compassionate principles to guide the immigration discussions in Utah. Mathis noted that the Utah Compact was developed in response to Arizona’s tough immigration enforcement bill. More than 100 Utah businesses, law enforcement officials, political groups, and faith organizations signed the compact. Mathis currently serves as director of the Downtown Alliance and executive vice president of the Salt Lake Chamber.\n\n’00s\n\nAlex Jensen BS’05, who was part of the University of Utah’s starting lineup during the 1997-98 basketball season, has been named the Dennis Johnson Coach of the Year, as voted by his fellow NBA Development League head coaches.

She was 78.\n\nBorn in Fairview, Utah, on March 9, 1935, Eccles grew up in Sanpete County, helping on the family’s sheep ranch and working at the local “Merc” and at the Sanpete Valley Bank. Following high school, she attended the University of Utah, where she met her lifelong love, Spencer Fox Eccles. She graduated in 1957 with a degree in elementary education and, one year later, after four years of courtship, married Spence. After living in New York for two years and in Boise, Idaho, for 10, they moved with their young family to Salt Lake City in 1970 and quickly became integral to the life of their community and state. The couple were partners in all their endeavors—family, banking, and philanthropy—and Spence relied heavily on Cleone as his most valued sounding board. Their partnership flourished for more than 54 years.\n\nCleone Eccles’ commitment to her community was confirmed by her years of service on many boards, including the U’s Board of Trustees, as well as the boards of the U Alumni Association, Red Butte Garden, KUED, the College of Nursing, Neighborhood House, Ballet West, the Utah Symphony Guild, and the Junior Leagues of Boise and Salt Lake. She was a faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and served in both the Primary and Relief Society. In 2001, she was honored by the Junior League with its Legacy of Excellence Award. The U honored Eccles with its Distinguished Alumna Award in 1995 and an Honorary Doctorate in 2005. Together, she and Spence received Utah’s 2010 Philanthropic Leadership Award and were named the 2012 Humanitarians of the Year by Catholic Community Services. Although Cleone served with dedication in the community, her highest priority was family.\n\nShe is survived by her husband; her daughters C. Hope Eccles (Randal K. Quarles), Lisa Eccles, and Katie Eccles (David J. Burnett); her son Spencer P. Eccles (Kristine Lifferth); and 10 grandchildren. She also is survived by sisters Miriam Mason and Cathy Bryan (Jack); her sister-in-law, Betty Jo Peterson; and many nieces, nephews, and friends. She was preceded in death by her parents as well as her brothers Lewis A. Peterson and Albert L. Peterson.\n\nR. E. “Earl” Holding BS’51 died of natural causes on April 19, 2013. He was 86.\n\nHolding was born November 29, 1926, the youngest of three children of Franklin Eugene and Reva Johnson Holding, Mormons who lost everything in the 1929 stock market crash. The family lived at the Covey and Hillcrest apartments in Salt Lake City, where Holding did yard work for 65 cents an hour. He graduated from West High School in 1944, and by the time he went into the U. S. Air Force, he had saved $10,000.\n\nAfter serving in Europe during World War II, he returned to Salt Lake City, obtained a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering from the University of Utah, and, in 1949, married Carol Orme. Earl and Carol were seldom apart throughout their 64 years of marriage.\n\nIn 1952, the Covey family offered Earl and Carol the opportunity to manage Little America, a gas, food, and lodging enterprise located on pre-interstate Highway 30 (now I-80) in southwestern Wyoming. Holding turned the isolated motel into a popular stop for travelers and truckers. He added dozens of pumps and put up signs for several hundred miles in all directions proclaiming this the world’s largest gas station. During their 13 years there, he and Carol started their family and fell in love with Wyoming and its people. From that time on, Wyoming became home.\n\nThe foundation of Holding’s business enterprises was Sinclair Oil, which he bought in 1976, eight years after acquiring a shuttered refinery in Casper, Wyoming. Holding’s fossil-fuel empire with the green-dinosaur logo grew to include two refineries, 1,000 miles of pipeline, and 2,600 gas stations in 22 states\n\nIn Utah, Holding’s efforts helped bring the 2002 Olympic Winter Games to Salt Lake City. He was an enthusiastic supporter and believed the Games stood for the ideals of athletic excellence and international cooperation.\n\nAt the time of his death, Holding was considered to be among the largest landowners in America with some 400,000 acres across the West. He owned the Grand America Hotel in Salt Lake City, as well as the ski resorts Snowbasin, in Utah, and Sun Valley, in Idaho.\n\nHolding is survived by his wife, their three children, Anne, Kathleen, and Stephen, their spouses, twelve grandchildren, and his brother, Ralph. He was preceded in death by his parents, his sister, Helen Jean, and his close business partner and childhood friend, Kenneth Y. Knight.\n\nBrooke Hopkins died July 31, 2013, in his Salt Lake City home. He was 71.\n\nRoger Brooke Hopkins was born March 25, 1942, in Baltimore, where he attended Calvert and Gilman schools. He also attended Hotchkiss, in Lakeville, Connecticut, where he first discovered his love of British literature. He obtained a bachelor’s degree (1964) and a doctorate (1970) in English from Harvard University, where he also taught for five years. His academic training included a year on fellowship at Oxford.\n\nDivorced from Nancy Doe Hopkins, he began teaching at the University of Utah in 1975, where he met another new faculty member, Margaret Battin (known as Peggy), who would become his wife in 1986. Hopkins remained at the U for the rest of his career, receiving accolades and awards for his teaching and writing. His primary field was Romantic poetry, including Wordsworth, Keats, Byron, and Shelley, although he also explored the genre of autobiography, issues in psychoanalysis, and many other areas. He was a popular professor and won many teaching awards, including the University of Utah Distinguished Teaching Award, and he was selected as University Professor. He also served as a department chair and helped launch the University’s writing program.\n\nHopkins loved traveling the world with Peggy and friends, trekking in the Himalayas, whipping up a gourmet meal, or enthusiastically dancing in blues bars. Shortly after retiring, he was injured in a double-bike accident, which left him paralyzed from the neck down. Despite the constraints of life in a wheelchair, perpetual respiratory problems, and sometimes severe pain, he was able to teach ten OSHER courses to mostly retired professionals in his living room, including Thoreau’s Walden, The Iliad, The Odyssey, The Aeneid, The Divine Comedy, The Canterbury Tales, Shakespeare’s sonnets, Moby Dick, and Shakespeare’s The Tempest. These courses became a graceful and heartfelt capstone to his career. Together with Peggy, he also wrote an extensive account of the challenges and deep insights in facing quadriplegia, Love Under Trial, an early version of which is available at www.brookeandpeggy.blogspot.com.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, his sister Lisa Hopkins Wheeler, stepchildren Michael Battin and Sara Battin Pearson, and four grandchildren, Kendra Battin, Jack Battin, Maxwell Pearson, Sydney Pearson, and niece Isabelle Hopkins Wheeler.\n\nRick Majerus died December 1, 2012, while awaiting a heart transplant. He was 64.\n\nMajerus was born February 17, 1948, in Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin, 60 miles north of Milwaukee. He graduated from Marquette University High School in 1966 and played junior varsity basketball at Marquette University, his hometown college, where he graduated in 1970.\n\nMajerus led five different Division I basketball programs during a 25-year career. He began his coaching career at St. Sebastian Grade School in Milwaukee, later moving to Marquette University High School. In 1971, Majerus joined Marquette University as an assistant coach under mentor Al McGuire and then worked under Hank Raymonds until taking over as Marquette head coach in 1983. Majerus left Marquette in 1986 and became a professional basketball assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association during the 1986-1987 season. He returned to college basketball for good in 1987 as head coach at Ball State University, where he remained until 1989.\n\nMajerus coached the University of Utah’s Runnin’ Utes from 1989 to 2004, leading them to the NCAA Championship game in 1998. He was named the 1998 John Wooden National Coach of the Year after his Utes played Kentucky for the national championship. The No. 3 seeded-Utes defeated two No. 1 seeds (Arizona and North Carolina) during their run to the title game. In his 15 seasons, Utah earned a bid to the NCAA Tournament 11 times, making the Elite Eight in 1997 and the Sweet 16 in 1991 and 1996.\n\nDespite missing most of three seasons due to health or personal reasons, Majerus averaged 21 wins a season on the hill, amassing a record of 323-95 and winning nearly 80 percent of his games. A five-time Western Athletic Conference Coach of the Year, Majerus led the Utes to nine regular-season conference championships and four conference tournament crowns.\n\nMajerus was briefly married from 1987 to 1989. He is survived by sisters Jodi Majerus and Tracy Dowd, as well as an extended “family” of players, fans, and fellow coaches. Majerus was remembered at a funeral Mass in Milwaukee on December 8. His father, Raymond, died of a heart attack at 63 in 1987. Majerus was devoted to his mother, Alyce, before her death in 2011.\n\nSusan Miller died February 22, 2013, in the company of friends after a 10-month battle with cancer.

She obtained a bachelor’s degree from Valparaiso University and her doctorate from the University of North Carolina, in Chapel Hill. She directed composition programs at Ohio State University and the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee before coming in 1983 to the University of Utah, where she became the founding director of the University Writing Program.\n\nShe wrote award-winning books on rhetoric and the teaching of writing. Most prominent among those are Rescuing the Subject, Textual Carnivals, and Assuming the Positions: Cultural Pedagogy and the Politics of Ordinary Writing. More recently, she published Trust in Texts: A Different History of Rhetoric, and an anthology, The Norton Book of Composition Studies, which she edited.\n\nNever one to rest on her laurels, Miller put her knowledge of rhetoric and composition to a new use in 2009 when she started a writing group for physicians, medical students, and staff at the University of Utah Health Sciences Center who wanted to write about their experiences but had no formal training in writing.\n\nMiller is survived by her brother, Jack Allen Miller (Barbara) of Fredericksburg, Virginia; nephew Nathanial Christian Miller (Nell) and great niece Mary Nell Caroline Miller of Charleston, South Carolina; as well as devoted friends and colleagues and her beloved dog, AJ. She was preceded in death by her father, Allen Ward Miller; mother, Margretta Boose Bowers; and stepfather, Clarence Harmon Bowers.

He was 89.\n\nSkaggs was born August 9, 1923, in Yakima, Washington, to L.S. Skaggs, Sr., and Vivian Howe Skaggs. The family moved in 1932 to Salt Lake City, where Skaggs attended local schools and Westminster College. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II and participated in the Allied invasion of Europe in 1944. After the war, Skaggs joined his father’s company, Payless Drug Stores, and became manager of the store in Boise, Idaho. While there, he met Aline Wilmot, and they were married on February 27, 1949. When Skaggs’s father suddenly died at age 55, the couple moved to Salt Lake City, and Skaggs assumed the job of president and chief executive officer of Payless Drug Stores, running 11 stores at age 27.\n\nBy the time Skaggs retired in 1993, he had built the 11-store chain into American Stores Co., a retailing giant with more than $20 billion in annual sales and more than 280,000 employees. During these years, he helped change the way Americans shop by combining grocery and drugstores under one roof. Under the banner of American Stores, Skaggs assembled some of the most well-known brands in America, including Alfa Beta, Jewel Stores, Lucky Stores, Sav-On Drug, Acme Markets, Rea & Derick, OSCO Drug, Star Markets, Buttrey’s, Katz Drug Stores, and Skaggs Drug Stores.\n\nFor more than 50 years, he and Aline, through their ALSAM Foundation, gave hundreds of millions of dollars to education through scholarships, school construction, and donations to research institutes and universities. They had six major universities name their pharmacy school or pharmacy building in their family’s honor, including the University of Utah’s L.S. Skaggs, Sr. Pharmacy Hall, built in the 1960s. The new L.S. Skaggs Pharmacy Research Institute at the U, which adjoins Skaggs Hall, was dedicated just three weeks after Sam’s death.\n\nSkaggs is survived by his wife and their four children, Susie Balukoff (AJ) Boise, Idaho; Mark S. Skaggs (Cindy), Eureka Springs, Arkansas; Claudia S. Luttrell, Salt Lake City; Don L. Skaggs (Teresa), Salt Lake City; 15 grandchildren; and 37 great-grandchildren.

She was 89.\n\nSorenson was born in Salt Lake City on April 13, 1924, to Bessie Elinor and Frank Campbell Taylor. She was the fifth of six children and later wrote of how much she appreciated the books and music of her childhood, saying, “My little mother wove a magic web throughout… that left a silver lining for all who lived within.” Sorenson was determined to see the same pattern and example perpetuated into the next generation.\n\nShe was a daydreamer who always “looked for the good” and believed in setting goals. When she was young, she wrote them down: Go to college; save $1,000; be a kindergarten teacher; marry; become a mother (in that order). She accomplished all of those goals. By the time she had graduated from East High School and then the University of Utah in the spring of 1945, she had saved her $1,000. She boarded a train headed for New York to teach kindergarten at a Quaker school.\n\nHer life took a dramatic turn when she met James LeVoy Sorenson at her church in Manhattan. He proposed to her on their third date, and they were married the next summer, on July 23, 1946. They settled in Salt Lake City, raised their children, and celebrated nearly 62 years of marriage before his death on January 20, 2008.\n\nA dedicated philanthropist, Beverley Taylor Sorenson supported numerous worthy causes through her family’s Sorenson Legacy Foundation, working to ensure that the arts were integrated into the elementary education of Utah’s children. She created Art Works for Kids, and in 2008, the Utah State Legislature adopted the arts-focused teaching model she and her team developed, naming it in her honor: the Beverley Taylor Sorenson Arts Learning Program.\n\nIn 2008, the Sorenson Legacy Foundation gave a $15 million donation to the University of Utah for a biomedical and neurosciences building and $12 million for an interdisciplinary arts and education complex. The $24 million Beverley Taylor Sorenson Arts and Education Complex, now under construction and scheduled for completion by the end of 2013, will ensure that her dream of infusing the arts into diverse aspects of education becomes a lasting reality.\n\nSorenson is survived by her eight children, 49 grandchildren, and 65 great-grandchildren. Read more about her in this article from the Winter 2011-12 issue of Continuum.\n\nMilton Elliot Wadsworth BS’48 PhD’51 died January 31, 2013, after a brief struggle with pancreatic cancer. He was 90.\n\nWadsworth was born February 9, 1922, in Salt Lake City to Thomas Guy Wadsworth and Agnes Flockhart Wadsworth. He attended Lowell Elementary, Roosevelt Junior High, and East High schools. He worked as a riveter at an aircraft factory in Burbank, California, before the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, and then served as an infantry officer in the U.S. Army during World War II.\n\nAfter the war, Wadsworth began a lifelong relationship with the University of Utah, where he received bachelor’s and doctoral degrees in metallurgical engineering. Wadsworth and his future wife Mirian Bailey met in 1939 when they enrolled in the Spring Flowers of the Wasatch as freshmen at the University of Utah. They were both members of the U.S. Army and were the first couple married in uniform at the Fort Douglas Chapel, in 1943.\n\nIn 1968, Wadsworth was asked by the Ford Foundation to head up a graduate program in metallurgy at the University of the Philippines. For the next two years, from their home in Manila, he and his family traveled throughout Asia, including a family road trip through the back country of Cambodia in the spring of 1969, unaware of the United States’ secret bombing campaign.\n\nDuring his career at the University of Utah, Wadsworth served twice as chair of the Department of Metallurgical Engineering, as well as director of the Utah Mining and Minerals Research Institute, and dean of the College of Mines and Earth Sciences. He received the University’s Distinguished Research Award, Distinguished Teaching Award, and the Rosenblatt Prize. He served as president of the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers and was a life member of the American Society of Metals. Wadsworth won numerous professional and academic accolades, held five patents and two honorary doctorates, and published 145 papers.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Mirian; daughters Kathryn Davis, Jane Wadsworth, Amy Wadsworth (David Richardson), Leslie Wadsworth-Smith (Alan Smith), and Margaret Morrison (Richard); and 19 grandchildren. He is preceded in death by his daughter Cristine Blanch, sons-in-law Thomas Blanch and Jon Davis, and grandchildren Collin Davis, Ellen Marie Morrison, and Laura Elizabeth Blanch. Interment was at Wasatch Lawn. In lieu of flowers, family suggests contributions to the University of Utah’s Milton E. Wadsworth Endowment fund online here or by mail, care of Leslie Bigler, College of Mines and Earth Sciences, University of Utah, 115 S. 1460 East Rm. 205, Salt Lake City, Utah 84112-0102.\n\nHomer Warner BA’46 MD’49 died November 30, 2012, from complications of pancreatitis. He was 90.\n\nWarner was born April 18, 1922, to Homer (Pug) and Grace Richards Warner. He played football at both East High School and the University of Utah, where he was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. During World War II, he enlisted in the Naval Air Corps, where he was trained to be a carrier-based fighter pilot. After the war, he returned to the U, where he met Katherine Ann “Kay” Romney. They received their bachelor’s degrees and later married in the Salt Lake Temple.\n\nAfter graduating with his medical doctorate, Warner continued his training in Dallas, at the Mayo Clinic, and at the University of Minnesota, where he received a doctoral degree in physiology in 1953. He returned to Utah, where he opened a cardiovascular laboratory at LDS Hospital and studied waveforms as a potential path to diagnosing heart patients. After the U bought its first digital computer in 1960, Warner worked with graduate students to develop a tool to effectively diagnose congenital heart disease, but doctors were skeptical. Two years later, he became the chairman of what is now considered the first program to grant degrees in medical informatics.\n\nIn 1968, Warner wrote his first version of a software program to evaluate patient data to guide physicians. He had been inspired by seeing an intensive care unit nurse overwhelmed by information from sensors. As he further developed his Health Evaluation Through Logical Processing program, or HELP program, it expanded to include information about drugs, lab tests, pulmonary function testing, patients’ medical history, and more. It is now considered one of the nation’s first electronic medical records and is still operational 40 years later at Intermountain Healthcare hospitals.\n\nWarner founded the journal Computers and Biomedical Research in 1968 and remained its editor for the next 24 years. In 1977, he authored a medical informatics textbook that is still used today.\n\nColleagues say that Warner’s research continues to redefine medicine. Modern intensive care units can be traced back to the electronic systems he built to monitor heart patients in the mid-1950s. And his creation of the HELP program set the stage for a new academic field and multi-billion-dollar health IT industry.\n\nAfter his wife’s death in 2006, Warner married their lifelong friend Jeanne Okland in 2009. After her passing, he married June Okland Cockrell.\n\nWarner is survived by his wife June; sister Emma Lou Thayne (Mel) and brother D. Gill Warner (Nedra); sister-in-law Marian Warner; children Katherine Black (Richard), Stephen Warner (Elizabeth), Homer Warner, Jr. (Rochelle), Willard Warner (Mary Lee), Ann Bradley (John), and Jodi Wagner (Tom); 23 grandchildren; and 39 great-grandchildren. In addition to his first two wives, Homer was preceded in death by his brother, Richard. A public service was held on December 6, at the Foothill Stake Center in Salt Lake City. Interment was at Wastach Lawn Cemetery. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests donations to the Homer R. Warner Scholarship Fund in Medical Informatics at the University of Utah.\n\nDean Searches at the U Bring Opportunities\n\nThe University of Utah is currently searching to fill eight dean positions, a little less than half the institution’s total number of 19 deans.\n\nMany of the departing deans have gone on to greater administrative responsibilities. Three searches—for the College of Education, the Graduate School, and the Marriott Library—are being supervised by Michael L. Hardman, the U’s interim senior vice president for academic affairs. Two more searches are being overseen by Vivian S. Lee, the U’s senior vice president for health sciences: for the College of Nursing and the U’s new School of Dentistry. And three additional searches—for the colleges of Law, Social and Behavioral Science, and Architecture + Planning, will begin this fall, under the new senior vice president for academic affairs, Ruth V. Watkins.\n\nIt’s a key moment that provides the University with the chance to bring in fresh ideas, says Gretchen Bataille, senior vice president of leadership and lifelong learning with the American Council on Education. “It should be viewed as an opportunity,” she says, to hire people who will bring greater diversity to the University, to look at how programs are aligned, to hire deans who have a good track record in fundraising, and to forge new teams across the institution.\n\nThe American Council on Education does studies of college presidencies every five years, and one recent trend has been that an increasing number of deans have been moving on to become college presidents, Bataille says. In the past, the majority of presidents came from provost positions. But the changing role of deans has made them attractive candidates for presidencies. “It used to be that deans were glorified department chairs,” she says. “Deans are now being asked to do a lot of fundraising and strategic thinking and data-based decision making.”\n\nBecause of that experience, they can be attractive candidates for college presidencies, she says. “When they go out to interview, they can talk knowledgeably about fiscal realities in higher education, and fundraising. It’s a relatively new training ground, because the old thinking was that they didn’t get involved in those duties.”\n\nTwo of the current U vacancies were created when University of Utah deans went on to college presidencies. Charles A. Wight, who was the dean of the U Graduate School, became president of Weber State University last fall. Hiram E. Chodosh, dean of the U’s College of Law, will take office as president of Claremont McKenna College on July 1.\n\nSome U deans went on to other senior leadership roles. M. David Rudd, who was dean of the U College of Social and Behavioral Science, became provost of the University of Memphis this past March. The U College of Education deanship opened when Hardman moved from that job to be the U’s interim vice president of academic affairs. Joyce L. Ogburn, who was dean of the Marriott Library, became a special assistant to the U’s senior vice president for academic affairs, leading interdisciplinary projects. Maureen Keefe, dean of the College of Nursing, will be stepping down at the end of June to move into a new job assisting Lee with special projects, interprofessional education, and the Utah Cluster Acceleration Partnership (UCAP), which is a statewide effort to accelerate key industry sectors as engines of job creation and economic growth.\n\nThe Dentistry deanship is a new position for the school whose creation was approved last year. And Brenda Case Scheer, dean of the College of Architecture + Planning, announced in March that she would be stepping down to take a sabbatical to write a book, and then return to the U as a professor.\n\n“In my previous role as senior vice president for academic affairs, I worked closely with all of these deans and know of their tremendous contributions to the U,” says U President David W. Pershing. “I’m not surprised to see new opportunities coming their way and look to their successors for continued achievement and academic excellence.”\n\nIllinois Dean Named U’s Chief Academic Officer\n\nThe University of Utah has selected Ruth V. Watkins, dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, to become the U’s chief academic officer. Watkins was selected to be the U’s vice president for academic affairs after a national search. David W. Pershing held the position for 14 years before becoming president in 2012.\n\nWatkins, who is a professor of speech and hearing science, will begin work at the U in August. “I’m honored to be joining a Pac-12 university that is growing in stature nationally and internationally,” she says. “I look forward to working with the faculty, staff, and students of the University of Utah to implement President Pershing’s vision for delivering a high-quality academic experience that prepares students for meaningful roles in the global community.”\n\nAs the liberal-arts dean at the University of Illinois, Watkins has been a leader for 600 faculty members and has ensured quality in education for nearly 12,000 undergraduates and 2,500 graduate students.\n\nShe also has overseen a budget of approximately $142 million per year and has promoted the college’s fundraising and advancement efforts. During her time, the college exceeded its fundraising goal of $250 million.\n\nShe joined the faculty at Illinois as an assistant professor in 1993. She served as associate dean for academic and research affairs in the College of Applied Health Sciences from 2000 to 2003. She became an associate provost in 2003 and then served as vice provost from 2006 to 2008, when she became a dean.\n\n“Ruth is a superb administrator with a strong academic background, including major external research funding and a focus on the undergraduate experience,” Pershing says. “I am confident her collaborative leadership style and commitment to providing exceptional educational opportunities will enable her to enjoy continued success here in Utah.”\n\nWatkins graduated with highest honors from the University of Northern Iowa with a bachelor of arts in speech-language pathology. She received a master of arts in child language at the University of Kansas and continued there to obtain a doctorate in child language.\n\nLegislative Successes Include Med School Funds\n\nUtah Governor Gary Herbert and the Utah State Legislature demonstrated unprecedented support for the University of Utah during the 2013 legislative session. The University received funding increases that will allow it to restore and increase the Medical School’s class size, implement a small pay increase for employees, and provide continuing support for USTAR, as well as other initiatives.\n\n“It was a great year on the Hill for the University of Utah and higher education in the state,” said University of Utah President David W. Pershing, in a letter thanking the many political advocates who helped advance the U’s causes during the 2013 legislative session. More than 400 volunteers—alumni, present and former faculty and staff members, and students—have signed up to be political advocates for the University, and they helped by contacting lawmakers at key junctures to voice their support for the U. Their efforts were coordinated by the U for Higher Ed Committee through a program sponsored by the University of Utah Alumni Association and the University’s Office of Government Affairs.\n\nThe advocates’ efforts were well received by the Legislature, says Jason P. Perry JD’99, the University’s vice president for government relations: “All of our top priorities were accomplished.”\n\nThe 2013 session of the Legislature ended in March. Thanks to the efforts of Pershing and Health Sciences Vice President Vivian Lee, the Legislature passed S.B. 42, which appropriates $10 million in ongoing funding, with $6.5 million in the first year, to expand the Medical School’s class size from 82 students to 102, starting this fall. The class size will then increase an additional 20 slots in 2014, bringing the total number of annually admitted students to 122.\n\nLawmakers also approved partial funding for a 1 percent compensation increase for public higher-education employees. In a clear sign of support for the USTAR initiative, which continues to bring world-class researchers to the state, the Legislature appropriated $5 million in ongoing funding that will help restore some prior budget cuts and allow the U to fund new research teams. And as requested by the Utah State Board of Regents, legislators appropriated $18 million to help fund distinctive mission initiatives as well as growth at each public institution of higher education.\n\nU Named Pac-12 Champion in Green Power\n\nThe University of Utah’s commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship has been recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which announced in April that the U is the Pac-12 conference champion for the 2012-13 College & University Green Power Challenge. The U beat its conference rivals by using more than 93 million kilowatthours of green power, representing 31 percent of the University’s annual electricity usage.\n\nThe U purchases a combination of renewable energy certificates and utility green power products from 3Degrees and Rocky Mountain Power, which helps to reduce the environmental impacts associated with electricity use on campus. In addition, the U generates green power from an on-site renewable energy system. The green power purchases were motivated by a studentled campaign to create a fund for clean energy purchases.\n\nL.S. Skaggs Pharmacy Institute Opens at the U\n\nThe L.S. Skaggs Pharmacy Institute at the University of Utah was opened in April, providing a new, 150,000-square-foot home for pharmacy research and teaching, as well as the Utah Poison Control Center.\n\nThe $75 million-plus building was created through the generosity of the late L.S. “Sam” Skaggs and stands as a tribute to Skaggs’ dedication to scientific discovery and many years of involvement with the University’s College of Pharmacy. A businessman and philanthropist who led one of the country’s largest food and drugstore chains, American Stores, Skaggs and charitable organizations he created donated more than $50 million to help construct the new U institute. Skaggs died on March 21.\n\nMaster’s Degree in Entertainment Arts Approved\n\nThe Utah State Board of Regents in late March approved a master’s degree in Entertainment Arts and Engineering (EAE) at the University of Utah. EAE is an interdisciplinary program between the U’s colleges of Fine Arts and Engineering and will provide the first advanced degree for the discipline in the state.\n\nThe new degree approval coincides with the program being recognized for the number one undergraduate and number two graduate game degrees in the nation by the Princeton Review in its 2013 rankings, released in mid-March.\n\nPreviously, U students in the EAE Master Games Studio graduated with a master’s degree in computing or a master of fine arts degree in film and media arts, with an emphasis in game arts, game engineering, or game production.\n\nRead the Continuum feature package on the University of Utah’s Entertainment Arts and Engineering program here.\n\nHonorary Degrees Bestowed at Commencement\n\nA physician, a mountain climber, and an executive specializing in environmental sustainability were presented with honorary doctoral degrees at a revamped University of Utah commencement ceremony in May.\n\nIn an effort to attract greater participation, the U this year moved the ceremony from a daytime slot to a Thursday evening, and incorporated multimedia elements, including an Instagram photo contest in which students were invited to submit photos, with the winning shots displayed at the ceremony.\n\nThomas D. Rees MD’48, a U alum and physician who co-founded the Flying Doctor Service of East Africa, received an honorary doctorate in science. Mountaineer Apa Sherpa, who has summited Mount Everest a world-record 21 times, received a doctorate of humane letters. And Andrea Brantzeg Thomas BS’88, a senior vice president of sustainability for Walmart Stores, received a doctorate of humanities.\n\nNatalie Gochnour Named Associate Business Dean\n\nThe David Eccles School of Business at the University of Utah has appointed Natalie Gochnour BS’84 MS’88 as an associate dean. A 28-year Utah public policy veteran, Gochnour’s U job will involve enhancing the relevance, reputation, and relationships of the school with business and community leaders throughout the state.\n\nGochnour will report to both the dean of the business school and the president’s office, and she will plan and implement a new public policy initiative focusing on serving Utah businesses and community leaders. For the past seven years, Gochnour has guided the public policy work of the Salt Lake Chamber, Utah’s largest business association, representing 7,700 member businesses. She will continue to advise the Salt Lake Chamber and serve as their chief economist.\n\nU Neighborhood Partners Opens New Center\n\nUniversity Neighborhood Partners celebrated the grand opening of the new 10,000-square-foot Hartland Partnership Center in April. The center brings together University of Utah faculty members and students, nonprofit organizations, and residents of west Salt Lake City to address economic, linguistic, and social barriers.\n\nThe partnership provides help with English language acquisition, family financial literacy, citizenship issues, afterschool programs, employment skills, health-care education, and life skills training.\n\nEncouraging Education\n\nThe U Alumni Association awards $400,000 annually in scholarships.\n\nBy Cassie Taylor\n\nThis academic year, the University of Utah Alumni Association will award more than $400,000 in scholarships to deserving students at the University of Utah. A broad range of scholarships are offered to anyone from incoming freshmen to final-year seniors, and from those who come from a long line of U graduates to first-generation college students.\n\nScholarship applications are available on the Alumni Association webpage, www.alumni.utah.edu/scholarships/, and most will be due in early February. Applications for the Founders Day Scholarship are due the following November.\n\nSeveral committees made up of members of the various Alumni Association boards are given the task to select the scholarship recipients every year. Committee members spend hours reading hundreds of applications from well-qualified students. While this is a difficult task, it is very rewarding when they know that the money given helps to relieve the financial burden of paying for the ever-increasing costs of tuition.\n\nDuring the past year, more than 50 scholarship recipients were honored at the association’s Spring Awards Banquet in April, and the Founders Day Scholarship recipient was honored last February at the Founders Day Banquet. The Alumni Board Awards and Scholarships Committee selected Randy W. Cardon for the Founders Day Scholarship in 2012.\n\nThe Alumni Association awards the full-tuition, $6,000 scholarship annually to recognize students who have overcome difficult life circumstances or challenges and who have given service to the University and the community. Cardon is a U student and gunnery sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps who has served five deployments, including two tours in Iraq.\n\nScholarship winners honored at the Spring Awards Banquet included 13 other Founders Day applicants who were selected to receive the Achievement Scholarship, which is $4,000. The committee also awarded 11 Campus Involvement Scholarships to students who have been exceptionally engaged in campus activities, in addition to their studies, while maintaining good grades; 11 Legacy Scholarships to students who have parents or grandparents who attended the U; six scholarships to nonresident incoming freshmen; and two Marvin J. Ashton Scholarships, to a graduate student in the Humanities College and one in the Business School.\n\nThe Alumni Association’s affiliate boards presented scholarships this year, as well. The Emeritus Alumni Board awarded $5,000 each to six students at Salt Lake City’s Bryant Middle School who participate in the board’s tutoring program. Most of the students are refugees who have fled hardship and political strife in their home countries, and they will be the first in their families to attend college.\n\nThe Emeritus Alumni Board also gave two scholarships to nontraditional students who are returning to continue their education after many years away from school. The Young Alumni Board’s scholarship committee gave scholarships to four seniors and four graduate students this year. The Beehive Honor Society Board presented one undergraduate scholarship and one Beehive Legacy Scholarship, which is given to a Beehive Honor Society inductee or child of a Beehive inductee. These scholarships all required a GPA of at least 3.0 and ranged from $1,000 to $4,000 in value.\n\nFunds for scholarships are available thanks to donations from and participation in events by generous alumni. The purchase of University of Utah license plates for vehicles is the greatest source of funds for scholarships. The Young Alumni Scholarship 5K, held every year in conjunction with Homecoming, is another big source of scholarship revenue and is a fun way for alumni and others to get involved and contribute to the Alumni Association scholarship fund.\n\nThe Alumni Association places great value on being able to award scholarships to help students achieve their academic goals. With the help of scholarship money, students are given the opportunity to improve themselves and the University. Tate Matta, recipient of the Marvin J. Ashton Scholarship, says, “The money generously awarded through the scholarship will provide an incredible opportunity for me to further my career goals while increasing my ability to positively impact lives around me. I hope to build my own legacy of service and compassion throughout my career while continually supporting the University.”\n\n—Cassie Taylor is a program coordinator for the University of Utah Alumni Association.\n\nFounders Day 2013\n\nThe University of Utah Alumni Association will present the 2013 Founders Day scholarship winner in February and will honor four outstanding graduates of the U and one honorary alumnus with 2013 Founders Day awards. A Founders Day Banquet will be held in their honor on February 28 at the Little America Hotel.

The annual awards recognize U alumni who graduated 40 or more years ago and whose careers have been marked by outstanding service to the University, their professions, and their communities.This year’s winners are Daryl Cameron Barrett BS’67, Kim R. Burningham BS’60, Loabelle “Loa” Black Mangelson-Clawson BS’59 MFA’68, Bryant W. Rossiter BA’54 PhD’57, and JoAnn B. Seghini BS’58 MEd’73 PhD’79. The Emeritus Alumni Board hosted a Merit of Honor Awards Banquet for them on November 7 at Rice- Eccles Stadium and Tower.\n\nBarrett has spent many years as a community volunteer for child advocacy and education, serving on community boards and committees including the University of Utah Alumni Association; Junior League of Salt Lake City; Utah Children; Zoo, Arts & Parks; and Planned Parenthood Association of Utah. She was also elected to a term on the Utah State Board of Education and was appointed to the Utah State Board of Regents. With her sister-in- law, Barrett co-authored “You’re In Charge,” an innovative child-abuse prevention program for elementary-aged children that gained national recognition. She has been recognized with honors including a National Association of Child Advocates Volunteer Award.\n\nBurningham (who also holds a master’s degree from the University of Arizona and an MFA from the University of Southern California) served as a member of the Utah House of Representatives for 15 years and has been a well-respected teacher of speech, debate, and drama at Bountiful High School for 27 years. He was a member of the Utah State Board of Education for more than a decade, chairing the board for six years. He has also been a consultant in professional writing and presenting for Shipley Associates and Franklin Covey for 20 years and directs the Bountiful Community School. He has been recognized with honors including the Utah PTA Friend of Children Award and a Legislative Leadership Award.\n\nMangelson-Clawson is a legend in Utah dance. Now University of Utah professor emerita, she studied with eminent dancers including Martha Graham, Willam Christensen, and Alwin Nikolais. Mangelson-Clawson was a charter member of Repertory Dance Theatre and also danced for Ririe-Woodbury Dance Company, and her choreographed works have been performed by both companies. In 1978, she formed and became artistic director of Performing Danscompany, a student company. She has directed hundreds of dance productions and directed and produced two award-winning films on dance. She has also written articles on dance history and technique, and she created and performed a 90-minute one-woman show about Isadora Duncan, later produced as a video by KUED.\n\nRossiter spent many years conducting scientific studies with the Eastman Kodak Research Laboratories, becoming director of the Chemistry Division and later director of Science and Technology Development, through which he helped form a new venture between Eastman Kodak and ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. that led to pioneering efforts to develop broadspectrum antiviral drugs. One drug, Ribavirin, was eventually approved worldwide for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus, hepatitis C, and a number of other viral diseases. Rossiter is senior editor of Physical Methods of Chemistry, a 23-volume treatise found in many libraries and scientific institutions throughout the world.\n\nSeghini, now in her fourth term as mayor of Midvale, Utah, dedicated 36 years to the Jordan School District. She taught K through sixth grades for 12 years and then was an administrator for 24 more, retiring as assistant superintendent of curriculum and staff development. She also spent more than a decade as an adjunct faculty member with both Utah State University and the University of Utah, and was co-chair of the Brigham Young University-Public School Gifted/Talented Task Force. Her contributions to community and professional boards and committees include currently serving on the Board of Trustees of the Itineris Charter School and as chair of the Salt Lake County Human Services Committee.\n\n—Marcia C. Dibble is associate editor of Continuum.\n\nAlumni Homecoming Events Raise $60,000 for Scholarships\n\nPhotos by Nathan Sweet\n\nThe University of Utah Alumni Association raised about $60,000 for U scholarships for deserving students through its fundraising events during Homecoming week.\n\nHomecoming began Saturday, September 8, when scores of volunteers turned out to participate in the Legacy of Lowell Community Service Day. The following Tuesday, campus groups decorated their areas to reflect this year’s Homecoming theme, “Red, White and U.” The U’s emeritus alumni—those who graduated 40 or more years ago—gathered for their Homecoming reunion later Tuesday afternoon, with tours of the Natural History Museum of Utah followed by a reception and dinner there featuring museum director Sarah B. George as the guest speaker.\n\nFraternity and sorority members competed in song and dance at Songfest on Thursday. Students and alumni then gathered for a pep rally at the Union Building on Thursday night. Friday began with the U Alumni Association hosting the Homecoming Scholarship Scramble, a golf tournament at Bonneville Golf Course. Under the leadership of this year’s tournament chairman, Keith Wallace BS’72, the golf tourney netted approximately $30,000 for U scholarships, about 50 percent more than last year. Friday night, students gathered for the annual Homecoming dance, held at The Depot at The Gateway shopping center in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe Young Alumni 5K and KidsK on Saturday morning, September 15, also raised about $30,000 for U scholarships. The crowds headed in the direction of Rice-Eccles Stadium in the afternoon for the Alumni Association’s pre-game tailgate party on Guardsman Way and then watched the Utes triumph over Brigham Young University, with a score of 24-21.\n\nTreasuring the Wasatch\n\nU alum and physician Howie Garber photographs the mountains to help preserve them.\n\nBy Kim M. Horiuchi\n\nHowie Garber MD’80, an emergency room physician and award-winning nature photographer, has focused his expertise and efforts outside medicine on preserving and defending the beauty of Utah’s Wasatch Mountains.\n\nGarber has photographed the Wasatch Range for 25 years and received national and international awards for his images. His pictures have been widely published as book and magazine covers and in calendars and greeting cards.\n\n“There are many similarities in my two professions,” he says. “As an emergency physician and as a nature photographer, you must accept that many factors are out of your control. Every day as an outdoor photographer is different and often full of surprise. Your success depends on multiple factors—weather, planning, animal behavior, and luck.”\n\nHis latest project is a book, Utah’s Wasatch Range: Four Season Refuge (Peter E. Randall Publisher, October 2012), that is a collaboration with 22 writers, including 17 University of Utah professors or alumni. Among the contributors are Salt Lake City Mayor Ralph Becker JD’77 MS’82; U professors Brooke Hopkins, Jim Steenburgh, and Margaret “Peggy” Battin; and professors emeritus Gale Dick, former dean of the U’s Graduate School, and William T. Parry BS’57 PhD’61 of the Geology and Geophysics Department. Each contributed essays for the book that accompany nearly 160 photographs by Garber. The photos feature the area’s wildlife, alpine scenery, and people— including skiers, hikers, and children.\n\n“There wasn’t a single person who turned me down, and it really didn’t take much convincing,” says Garber, who adds that what makes him most proud about the book was the opportunity to collaborate with the writers. “It just shows how much people love the Wasatch Mountains.”\n\nPhotographer and author Stephen Trimble, who contributed one of the essays, says the photos and essays “work together to celebrate the diversity and fragility of one small mountain range that does so much for so many.”\n\nGarber says the book sprang from his wish to preserve the remaining natural areas and watershed of the Wasatch Mountains. Proceeds from the book, which is available for purchase through utahswasatchrange.com, will benefit groups working on clean air, wilderness, and protection of natural areas in the Wasatch. Garber’s involvement in Utah conservation efforts started after the City Creek flood of May 1983. Garber met regularly with city planners and helped establish the current system for biking and pedestrian use of the city’s surrounding canyons. In 1987, Salt Lake County started a master plan, incorporating bike and pedestrian use, for Emigration, Mill Creek, Parley’s, and Big and Little Cottonwood canyons.\n\nGarber worked for the next two years with Salt Lake County planners, as well as Becker, who was a consultant at the time, and a citizen’s advisory committee, on the master plan adopted by Salt Lake County. In 2009 and 2010, Garber worked with Envision Utah on the Wasatch Canyons Tomorrow plan. Since 2008, he has worked with Utah Physicians for Healthy Environment to improve Salt Lake City’s air quality.\n\nGarber, who was born and raised in Boston, says he is constantly trying to balance his three loves: medicine, photography, and conservation. He began working as an emergency room physician in 1982 after graduating in medicine from the U. His career path soon took him to Nepal and Brazil, where he met Sandra Cavalcanti, who was hitchhiking. Cavalcanti, to whom he was later married for a time, is a biologist specializing in jaguars and sparked his interest in wildlife photography.\n\nGarber most recently has worked as a doctor at a hospital in Rawlins, Wyoming, and has filled i"
