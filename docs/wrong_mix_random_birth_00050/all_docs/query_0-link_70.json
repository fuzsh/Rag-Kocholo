Long Beach Field, CA. 325th Bomb Squadron [NV*K], 92nd Bomb Group, Podington (Station 109), Bedfordshire 2Dec43. Named \"Sky Scrapper\". Failed to return from a mission to the AGO-Flugzeugwerke Fw 190 manufacturing factory at Oschersleben, Germany 11Jan44 (10POW). While the aircraft were airborne, the weather closed in over English bases and a recall signal was issued. B/Gen. Robert F. Travis, Air Commander of the 1st Bomb Division, continued on to the target. This left the 1st Bomb Division with greater exposure to enemy fighter attacks. Good fighter support was provided by P-47 Thunderbolts on the penetration and by P-51 Mustangs over the target. P-47s were airborne to provide withdrawal support but they obeyed the recall order to return to England and left the bombers to fend for themselves on the return trip. Luftwaffe attacks started over the IJsselmeer and intensified when the American fighters returned home. Meagre and fairly accurate flak was experienced on the bomb run, with intermittent inaccurate flak on the return trip. Shot down by enemy fighters, crashed Kotte Farm, Almelo, near Albergen, Netherlands. MACR 1921 39759 (MSN 17-6502) Accepted by USAAF at Lockheed Field, Burbank, CA 21Aug43.

The 1943 World Series had all the hallmarks of a classic. In a rematch of the previous year's antagonists, the St. Louis Cardinals would attempt to repeat their resounding win over the New York Yankees. The nation's war effort was gobbling up manpower at a prodigious rate. No one knew who might be playing ball in 1944, or if there would even be a 1944 season. It looked as if this might be the last great series for the duration of the war, which is why the first game drew over 68,000 fans to Yankee Stadium. On October 5, 1943, the Yankees were on their way to a 4-2 victory over the Cardinals when, in the eighth inning, four B-17s suddenly rumbled above the stadium packed with 68,676 fans. As the teams took batting practice and the pitchers warmed up, four Army Air Force B-17 bombers were droning toward New York City on their way to combat bases in England. No one is sure what sparked the next move. Perhaps it was just the high spirits of young men facing a dangerous future. As the aircraft crossed the Hudson River, the pilots headed for the Bronx and put the formation into a shallow dive. Picking up speed, the bombers thundered over Yankee Stadium in a low pass from home plate to center field. After they climbed out the B-17s wheeled about and circled the field while one aircraft returned for an encore. It cleared the upper-deck flagpoles by a mere 25 feet, prompting the Associated Press to later report that \"an Army bomber roared over Yankee Stadium so low that Slats Martin could have fielded it\". The aircraft then rejoined the formation and headed east. When they landed at Presque Isle airfield in Maine, the four pilots were confined to quarters while court martial proceedings were undertaken. They were released a few days later when the Army realized it was foolish to keep four badly needed aircraft and crews out of combat because of a youthful indiscretion. \"Besides,\" a general told them, \"you and your crew will probably be killed anyway\". North Atlantic Wing, Air Transport Command, Presque Isle Field, ME 5Oct43. 358th Bomb Squadron [VK*H], 303rd Bomb Group, Molesworth (Station 107), Huntingdonshire 18Oct43. Named \"Thru Hel'en Hiwater\" Damaged when B-17F 42-29823 was performing a cross over maneuver to echelon in preparation for landing at Molesworth following a mission 9Feb44 when the number four engine/propeller contacted with the tail of B-17G 42-39785. Both airplanes were able to land safely and there were no casualties. Battle damaged and returned to base after a direct hit on the tail. The tail gunner was uninjured, fortunate that he was checking the tail wheel when the shell hit. 359th Bomb Squadron [BN*B]. Failed to return from a mission to the railway marshalling yards at Hamm, Germany 22Apr44 (4KIA:6POW). Flak set an engine on fire before the target, the aircraft entered a spin and exploded before some crew could bail out, crashed Delecke, six miles south of Soest, Germany. {28 missions}.

Long Beach Field, CA. 427th Bomb Squadron [GN*R], 303rd Bomb Group, Molesworth (Station 107), Huntingdonshire 18Oct43. Named \"G. I. Sheets\" Failed to return from a mission to the industrial area at Frankfurt am Main, Germany 29Jan44 (5POW:4EVD:1KIA). During assembly for the mission, the plane had problems with the No.2 engine supercharger but the crew agreed to continue. Within sight of the target, the pilot had to feather the No.4 propeller because of an oil leak. The bomber could not keep up with the group, became a straggler and a target for enemy fighters so the crew jettisoned the bombs. The first wave of four Bf 109s attacked from the front and did a lot of damage even though the pilots took evasive action. One shell went through the nose plexiglass causing serious injury to the bombardier and navigator. The explosion had knocked out the oxygen system, the instrument vacuum system and damaged some headset communication. The pilot dove for cloud cover which was about 5,000ft. Utilizing the cloud cover as much as possible allowed the plane to get back over Belgium. There the cloud cover ran out as it flew over a large Fw 190 fighter base. They not only sent up fighters but fired on the bomber with small arm weapons. The combat with fighters was futile. The crew lost most of their gunnery protection and was receiving extensive damage to the aircraft along with injuries to the crew. With the rudder fabric burnt off by No.3 engine on fire, the pilot decided he had enough and sounded the warning bell. It had been approximately two hours since the first attack. A waist gunner bailed out but the remaining crew realized how low they were, estimated to be less than 400 feet and remained on board. Crash landed on pasture at Solre-Saint-Géry, south of Beaumont, Belgium MACR 2260 39787 (MSN 17-6530) Accepted by USAAF at Lockheed Field, Burbank, CA 31Aug43. Long Beach Field, CA.

Declared war weary. Reassigned for utility, training and weather check aircraft 12Feb44. Crash landed at Molesworth 5Jul44. The 303rd Bomb Group held a party to celebrate the 4th of July and invited a nearby Fighter Group of little friends. In the early hours of the following morning the little friends were in no shape to drive back to their own base. The Operations Officer of the bomb group used this plane as a taxi to take the fighter pilots home. Returning to Molesworth, on the downwind leg the pilot lowered the landing gear. The indicator light was missing the green cover and was too bright in the dark night so the pilot unscrewed the filament. On base leg, the pilot started to lower the wing flaps and expected a nice smooth landing. Unfortunately, he had inadvertently raised the landing gear and there wasnt a light to warn him. His arrival at Moleworth was with a screech of metal and a shower of sparks as the four propellers chewed into the runway and stopped the plane. Ferry Command 20May45. Returned to US.

Crashed near the control tower at Thorpe Abbotts 4Dec43. It was returning from a local navigation and procedures sortie. On its return the aircraft was approaching the runway for a straight-in landing but from a higher altitude than normal and in a slow power off glide. As the aircraft touched down, the right wing stalled and the landing was simultaneous on the right main gear, tail wheel and right wingtip, bending the wing two or three feet upwards. The aircraft took off again and climbed straight ahead to an altitude of 50 to 100 feet before stalling, dropping down again striking the left wing. It was the pilots first flight in the UK and had not flown for two months and the other pilot was acting as check pilot for the first time.

Failed to return from a mission to the AGO-Flugzeugwerke Fw 190 manufacturing factory at Oschersleben, Germany 11Jan44 (10KIA). While the aircraft were airborne, the weather closed in over English bases and a recall signal was issued. B/Gen. Robert F. Travis, Air Commander of the 1st Bomb Division, continued on to the target. This left the 1st Bomb Division with greater exposure to enemy fighter attacks. Good fighter support was provided by P-47 Thunderbolts on the penetration and by P-51 Mustangs over the target. P-47s were airborne to provide withdrawal support but they obeyed the recall order to return to England and left the bombers to fend for themselves on the return trip. It proved to be the most disastrous of the 303rd Bomb Group combat missions flown to date. The 303rd lost eleven of the forty B-17s flying the mission. Luftwaffe attacks started over the IJsselmeer and intensified when the American fighters returned home. Meagre and fairly accurate flak was experienced on the bomb run, with intermittent inaccurate flak on the return trip. Shot down by enemy fighters, crashed Nollman Farm, Natrup-Hagen, six miles southwest of Oschersleben, Germany. {10 missions}..

Since there had been no flying crew yet assigned to this most recent replacement, the crew chief decided he would name the plane after his home town in Pennsylvania: Emeigh (pronounced Amy). Artwork was based on an advertisement for Mojud Hosiery. Failed to return from a mission to the Junkers Flugzeugwerke aircraft factory at Aschersleben, Germany 22Feb44 (7KIA:3POW). On the way to the target, the formation met with the 381st Bomb Group. Since these planes were late following the main formation, no escort was available. Heavy cloud cover over the target forced the formation to divert to the industrial area of Bünde, Germany. The bomber formation was exposed to the attack of German fighters for over forty minutes without interruption, most of which were Fw 190s. Struck by flak the pilot was forced to feather the number one propeller. Almost immediately, flights of Bf 109s attacked and as the group increased speed and tightened their formation this plane was gradually left behind. One 500Ib bomb remained hung up in the bomb bay after the load was jettisoned to lighten the plane and was subjected to repeated attacks. Two enemy fighters came in on individual passes; the first killing the engineer, co-pilot and tail gunner and wounding two other crew men. As the survivors prepared to bail out of the waist door, the second Bf 109 attacked and killed three other airmen. The pilot stayed at the controls to try to keep the plane steady and give the survivors a chance of bailing out but just as the wounded waist gunner leaped from the waist, the plane turned over and went into a spin. Crashed at Hermannstal, one mile west of Lügde, six miles southwest of Hameln, Germany. {23 missions) MACR 2641 39816 (MSN 17-6559) Accepted by USAAF at Lockheed Field, Burbank, CA 8Sep43.

Crashed on takeoff and exploded at Deenethorpe 5Dec43. While taking off from Deenethorpe, and probably with frost on the wings, it was caught in the preceding aircrafts propeller vortices. It stalled and careered across a few fields with the tail section breaking off before skidding through a farmyard in the village of Deenethorpe, coming to rest against an empty cottage. The navigator and bombardier were trapped in the nose but rescued. Uninjured crew vacated the burning aircraft and warned the villagers of an impending explosion. Fire crews and colleagues rushed to the scene, and the two remaining injured crewmen were safely pulled out. Emergency workers evacuated all nearby civilians, thus no one was injured when the aircrafts bomb load (twelve 500lb bombs) exploded twenty minutes later, blasting the aircraft and the nearby fire tender to pieces and destroying or severely damaging most of the buildings in the village. The explosion was enormous and heard nine miles away. 8 crew OK, 2 badly injured. Condemned salvage Dec 7, 1943 39826 (MSN 17-6569) Accepted by USAAF at Lockheed Field, Burbank, CA 11Sep43.

Regained by Group. Battle damaged during a gunnery practice mission 30Dec43 (1WIA:9RTD). The aircraft had been flying at 13,000ft with the gunners firing at a towed target. After the session, the plane descended through cloud and after a while sighted land, the navigator claiming that it was England. Dropping down to 1,800 feet and heading for base, the crew was surprised - and annoyed  to have flak being shot at them but then found out that they were actually over France  the wrong side of the North Sea. The pilot turned around and flew quickly out to sea towards England. The tail gunner had been wounded by flak shrapnel; flak had struck the tail and exploded, nearly taking off his head. Arriving back over Thurleigh, fog was closing in and No.3 engine had a blown cylinder. Approaching to land on three engines, the plane was diverted and landed at Great Saling (Station 485), Essex. Regained by Group 21Jan44. Seriously battle damaged during a mission to the Messerschmitt aircraft factory at Augsburg, Germany 25Feb44 (1WIA:9RTD).

Battle damaged during a mission to the industrial area at Brunswick, Germany 10Feb44 (10RTD). Meagre to heavy flak was seen when crossing the enemy coast at IJmuiden, Netherlands. In the vicinity of Lingen, Germany the formation was attacked by enemy fighters in groups of three. As they neared the target, twin-engined aircraft fired rockets into the formation. Intense flak was encountered at the target where the aircraft received flak damage. The formation was under fighter attack until it neared the IJsselmeer on the return home. Friendly fighters were outnumbered, especially in the target area. Battle damaged on a mission to industrial areas in the suburbs of Berlin, Germany 4Mar44. Because of severe weather in the assembly area, the group diverted to a target in the Ruhr valley, Germany. The pilot left the formation, returned home alone and was attacked by enemy fighters but landed safely at Knettishall. Battle damaged on a mission to a railway marshalling yard at Liège, Belgium 25May44. Meagre flak was encountered crossing the French coast in the Le Tréport area but very accurate flak at Poix-de-Picardie, France. Failed to return from a mission to an oil depot at Königsburg, Germany 28May44 (10POW). The plane received a flak hit in the right wing shortly after the bombs were dropped over the target disabling No.3 and No.4 engines. The radio room was full of black smoke and a bunch of control cables had been shot in half. A piece of flat flak, about 18 inches long, came through the bottom of the right wing, through the engine, through the right fuselage, and radio room. It took the sight off the radio operators fifty-caliber machine gun and went out through the Plexiglas. The pilot managed to keep the badly damaged plane in the air, but could no longer maintain the necessary speed and altitude. The navigator reported that the plane could make it back to England with only two functioning engines if the propellers could be feathered. However, this was not possible due to the damage to this wing, so that the air resistance was too great to be able to maintain the altitude, even with the other two engines at full throttle. The plane had lagged behind the formation and, as protection from German fighter planes, the pilot called for friendly fighters to provide protection and two P-51 Mustangs appeared. He hoped to reach the Netherlands to find help with resistance fighters. The crew threw out everything that they could to lighten the aircraft but were unable to jettison the ball turret. The plane received some 40mm anti-aircraft fire from a town it passed over at 8,000ft. Still losing altitude steadily, at about 200 to 400 feet, the plane passed over an airfield and was fired at by 20mm anti-aircraft guns. Eventually the pilot was forced to crash land in a field near the Wiera river, one mile from Mengsberg, thirty-one miles southwest of Kassel, Germany. {46 missions}. MACR 5317. The bomber was initially camouflaged by the Germans to prevent it from being destroyed by American fighter planes.
