In Justice League Beyond, the league handles the self-destructing Superman robots and then enters the Phantom Zone to save Superman. As the story concludes, the true mastermind is revealed and someone returns from the Zone with the Justice League. Batman Beyond continues with Rewire wreaking havoc in the city and Terry, after being unconscious, devises a plan to stop the new villain. Christos Gage builds on the theme of whether or not the League can still make a difference without the use of their superpowers/technology. Case and point is when he has the majority of the Justice League enter the Phantom Zone, knowing that each of their traits is useless there, to save their comrade. Gage vividly details what truly makes a hero is their courage, heart and determination. It was such a fun read! Christos is also able to maintain enthusiasm by introducing new threats that will undoubtedly come into play later in the series–hopefully sooner than later because they have the potential to be great arcs in the Beyond universe. Batman Beyond seemed to take a more contemplative approach to the conclusion of its storyline. By doing this, Kyle Higgins retains the heart that Batman Beyond stories are known for. Two pages in particular just nail it; Terry McGinnis meets up with Dick Grayson, who points out how Rewire and his relationship with his father is reminiscent of Terry and Bruce’s. Higgins shows his understanding of great villains by noting some possible similarities between the antagonist and protagonist; two sides of the same coin. Why Wayne and McGinnis are not speaking to each other is still unclear, but it’s evident that Kyle has a firm idea on where he wants to go with this book. He has proven himself as a Batman Beyond scribe, so let’s just go along for this awesome ride. Iban Coello and Thony Silas have demonstrated, throughout these two arcs, their talent for the bringing the material to life. There wasn’t much in either book that stuck out in the panel layout or artwork; it was just solid work all around. Although, Coello’s depiction of Batman Beyond is still one of the best to date! These comics can be purchased digitally first, they alternate weeks. If you’ve become a fan or just enjoy stories in the Beyond universe, buy them as soon as they are available. If not, wait until they are compiled, in print, in this book each month. With two options to be reading these great books, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t be picking them up!

Odd and perhaps morbid choice for a kid, I know...At the same time, I was immersed in the pop culture of the time which included, but not limited to: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Ghostbusters, Jurassic Park, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, and of course, Batman: The Animated Series. Upon reflection, it’s fairly evident why I’m such a zealous geek. My day job is in television operations, so basically I’m exposed to media at every turn, which is where I want to be! Writing comic book reviews is another outlet to convey my respect and fanaticism for the this graphic medium. I hope what I have to say will resonate with others and also spark heart-felt discussion.

And ever since his first revelation that the spying wing of the U.S. government is especially interested in electronic communications data, the Web public at large hasn’t taken it lightly. The Internet Defense League, a coalition of thousands of websites formed to fight “bad laws and monopolies” against the Web at large, organized a large online protest on the Fourth of July, an attempt to voice the rallying cry to end “unconstitutional government spying,” as the group put it. The Independence Day protests were the largest online effort by the group since the SOPA blackouts — a mass effort in early 2012 in which many major sites “blacked out” for a period of 24 hours in response to the Stop Online Piracy Act bill — according to the IDL. Reddit, the popular link-sharing social media site, ran ads in support of the protests on its site all week long, and posted a missive in support of the movement on its official blog on the Fourth. In June, Reddit had more than 70 million unique visitors come to the site. WordPress, the popular content-management system and blogging network, added a widget that let site owners automatically display support for the IDL with a click of a button. WordPress powers more than 67 million sites across the Web (including this one). The Internet Association, which represents the interests of a large coalition of websites (including Google and Facebook) and argues for more Web-friendly public policy issues, also posted a strong statement of support on its official page. While a great many other sites supported the movement online, there were also local showings of support in major cities, including New York, San Francisco and Chicago. In Manhattan, hundreds of protestors rallied on Wall Street. As you can see below, hundreds of Californians turned out to for the “Restore the Fourth” rally in San Francisco. The government’s response thus far? It’s not budging. Top leaders in the NSA have testified before judiciary committees, saying that a number of its programs have foiled terrorist plots against America, and are invaluable to the country’s safety. Still, in a statement posted to its website, the NSA still respected Americans’ right to peaceful demonstration, especially on a day like the Fourth.

Ecuadorian official Roddy Zambrano has spoken about the controversial semi-final, as the Brazilians went on to lift the trophy. Argentine maestro Messi lashed out at South America's governing body Conmebol after his side beat Chile 2-1 in the third-place play-off. The Barca ace called the refereeing \"bulls***\" after officials opted not to use VAR for two clear penalty shouts for Argentina against Brazil. Speaking about Messi claiming the referee had “favoured Brazil in every play” of the match and the “officiating was crazy”, Zambrano retaliated on radio station Super K-800. Zambrano said: “He is dedicated to playing and I’ve never had a problem with him, the truth is his words surprised me, but everyone has their own opinion.” Speaking about possible penalties for Argentina’s Manchester City stars Nicolas Otamendi and Sergio Aguero, he said: “Otamendi went in hard and it wasn’t a nudge [on him]. \"VAR reviewed it and decided it was 50-50 and I wasn’t called to see it. They didn’t think it was a clear penalty. “On the first one, it is almost a reckless foul [by Aguero] on the defender. Why didn’t they show the camera angle from behind?” After the collision between Aguero and Dani Alves, Brazil stormed up the pitch and Liverpool’s Roberto Firmino scored their second goal to seal the match. Alves later slammed Messi for his comments, calling him \"disrespectful\". The former Barcelona star said: \"A friend is not always right just because he's a friend.

It's the only thing they've ever done, and the only thing they've ever wanted to do. Building the best boats in the world is more than a family business; it's a family passion.

A store at Pearl Kai closed Saturday. CLICK FOR LARGE Tower Records sounds final note Shoppers scoop up last-minute bargains as three stores close By Rosemarie Bernardo rbernardo@starbulletin.com Cradling an armful of compact discs at Tower Records on Keeaumoku Street yesterday, shopper Joanne Amende described how the popular store was a hangout for her when she was 12 years old while growing up in Chicago. \"This is a piece of my history gone. That's how I look at it,\" Amende, now 39, said. At that time, Tower was one of the few places that had punk music, she said. \"You couldn't find that kind of music anywhere. Tower had it.\" Known for its broad selection of music from indie and punk to rock and pop, Tower Records' stores on Keeaumoku Street and Kahala Mall shut its doors yesterday as part of a nationwide closure. Tower Records' in Pearl Kai, the third on Oahu, shut down Saturday. Walgreen Co., a major drugstore chain in the U.S., has expressed interest in opening a store at the Keeaumoku Street site. Many shoppers took advantage of the closeout sale at Tower Records at Keeaumoku Street and Kahala Mall yesterday, with remaining CDs available at only 99 cents each. But there wasn't much left. Most shelves at both sites were empty as some shoppers filled their baskets with CDs and DVDs. Music downloads from the Internet and big box retailers such as Wal-Mart, Circuit City and Best Buy that offer CDs at low prices contributed to the demise of Tower Records in the United States, according to some employees. In October, Great American Group purchased the 89-music store chain following bankruptcy filings from Tower Records. A representative of Great American declined comment. Nevertheless, the music store will continue to operate at franchised sites in several countries overseas, including Japan, where Tower Records thrives. Shopper Kelly Nakasone said it was just a matter of time before Tower Records would be impacted by music downloads such as iTunes. \"It's inevitable,\" Nakasone said. \"It's easy to plug in an iPod and listen to a song for a buck.\" Some store employees described Tower Records as an \"icon of the music industry.\" But with the combination of technology and a drop in computer prices in the mid-1990s, music lovers began to download music, a sign that a decline in store-bought CDs was eminent. Some loyal customers continued to shop at Tower Records, knowing they would be able to find catalogue items at the chain store. Flipping through rows of CDs, Makiki resident Celeste Vallentyne said Tower Records was the only retailer where she could find indie and underground music. Vallentyne, 26, said she spent about $200 on CDs at the Keeaumoku Street store within the last few days. Cashier Shelley Kim, 19, said, \"When we first found out that the store was closing, I thought I was going to cry.\" What Kim will miss most, she said, is the chain's signature red-and-yellow sign displayed outside of the building. \"It will be hard to see that sign go,\" she said. \"It's an end of an era,\" said Eric Ripley, store manager of the Kahala store. Ripley, who worked at Tower Records since he moved to Hawaii from San Francisco in 1993, said, \"It's sad to see it come to an end.\" Inside | Dec. 18 » Data reveals new tsunami risk » Kayak tours emphasize care of nature » UH graduation » Bus drivers applaud no-ring bill » Business class helps entrepreneur blossom » Tower Records sounds final note » Collapse of massive lava shelf appears imminent » Dinner wraps up Filipino centennial » Photo Finish » Sherman still playing the name game » Billy Joel forges strong connection » Portfolio: The Southwest » Keiki Kalikimaka » Growth on the horizon for LeJardin » LeJardin: Freshmen volunteer at home for ill kids » LeJardin: You Asked » Cel Shaded » Sun Devils bring 3 players home » Much-needed victory gives 'Bows big boost » NFL Islanders » Iolani Classic as loaded as ever » Hawaii At Work: Offering a new perspective » Tech View » Education quality as well as costs should guide school mergers Columns | Dec. 18 Cel Shaded Jason Yadao\n\ncc/2019-30/en_middle_0047.json.gz/line15\n\n__label__wiki\n\n0.771123\n\n0.771123\n\nAustinTalks (http://austintalks.org/tag/candy/) Austin youth invited to Halloween celebrations By AustinTalks | October 30, 2018 One party is being held from 5 to 9 p.m. Oct. 31 at St. Paul Lutheran Church, 846 N.

Recently honoured with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Ards International Guitar Festival in Northern Ireland, Sarah?s also drawn critical praise for her voice (which has been variously likened to malt whiskey and melted chocolate) and her engaging rapport with audiences: \"I?ve attended hundreds of concerts of all kinds, and her subtle mastery onstage launches her straight into my fave shows ever,\" wrote The Huffington Post. With the release of her new album, the Madrid-born, Chicago-raised, Cornwall-based singer/songwriter has expanded her battery of instruments to include piano, electric guitar and drum, and it's drawn critical raves internationally: Dutch music magazine Heaven hailed it as \"an early contender for folk album of 2018,\" the UK's fRoots said it was \"a collection to savour\" and the USA's PopMatters called it \"a gateway into a true innovator's soul.\" \"Seeing a shared world in a new way, from a different angle, is the role of the songwriter.

Birth: 28 September 1840, Camden, Del. Date Medal Issued: 22 July 1892. Voluntarily delivered an order in the face of heavy fire of the enemy. \"Postles deed of valor came on the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg. There, the 1st Delaware Regiment was a part of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Smyth's 2nd Brigade, Brig. General Hays's 3rd Division of Major General Hancock's II Corps.\" \"This day, July 2, 1863, the above soldiers were placed between the Taneytown and Emmitsburg roads just west of Cemetery Ridge. Located about one half a mile in front of the Union lines was the Bliss Farm consisting of a house and barn. All day both sides fought over possession of this farm. Around 6 o'clock in the evening Rebel sharpshooters gained the Bliss house and were causing a great deal of problems for the Union soldiers. To help put a stop to this four companies of the 12th New Jersey Regiment aided the 1st Delaware Regiment in gaining possession of the barn some 60 yards from the house. The Rebel's however wouldn't leave the house and continued to wreck havoc on the Union soldiers.\" \"General Alexander Hays, division commander, sent word to Col. Smyth to have his men in the barn 'take that damned white house and hold it at all hazards!' Col. Smyth turned to his men and said 'Gentlemen, you heard, who will take the order?' \" \"At that moment Postles was sitting on a rock a few feet away with his head in his hands having been sick for several days. Not hearing any response to Smyth's request, Postles raised his head and answered: 'I will take it, sir.' \" \"Postles mounted his horse, crossed the Emmitsburg Road, and headed at a gallop in the direction of the barn half a mile distant. The moment he crossed the Emmitsburg Road, Postles began to draw fire from the Rebel sharpshooters in the house which became so hot that he wondered why none of the bullets hit him or his horse. The closer he got, the thicker the bullets, but he reasoned he was safe as long as he was in motion and wondered what he was going to do when he stopped to deliver the message at the barn? Surely the bullets would then find their marks because they were firing at him from every window and door of the house just 60 yards away.\" \"As he got closer to the barn, he dug his spurs violently into his horse's sides. He later wrote: 'The poor brute, his sides torn up by my spurs and his mouth lacerated and bleeding from the cruel curb-bit, reared, and kicked and plunged, so that I was as bad a mark as though in full gallop.' He stopped and shouted out his message to the barn and as soon as they acknowledge it he raced safely back to his lines.\" \"When he got about 300 yards from the Rebel sharpshooters and felt safe, he reined in his horse and turned in his saddle. Taking off his cap, he waved in at the Rebel in defiance. That brought on the Rebel yell as they stopped firing at him. He rode back to the Union lines amidst three cheers and the congratulation of the corps commander himself, General Winfield Hancock.\" \"Out on the farm the Union soldiers attacked and took possession of the house, taking 40 prisioners and burning both the house and barn to the ground. As the prisoners were brought in, they recognized Postles as the daring rider and one of them said 'Well sir, I guess your time hain't come yet.' Postles asked the man what he meant and he related to him that he himself had three clean shots at him and so had others and neither the horse nor rider had been hit once.\" (from Martin, Roger A., Delaware\"s Medal of Honor Recipients)\n\ncc/2019-30/en_middle_0047.json.gz/line36\n\n__label__wiki\n\n0.794497\n\n0.794497\n\nLos Cabos Film Festival Announces the Films of the Horror, Environmental and American Specials Programs | October 20, 2015 Los Cabos International Film Festival is known as its program focuses on North American Cinema, strengthened by a selection of outstanding films acclaimed at the world’s most important festivals.

We are proud to present the following three flawless films that have done the rounds of prestigious festivals such as Sundance, Cannes and Fantastic Fest, and whose elegance raises terror to a higher level: “Matteo Garrone’s Tale of Tales is fabulous in every sense.” Peter Bradshaw. The Guardian Dir. Matteo Garrone (Gomorra, Reality) Cast: Salma Hayek, Vincent Cassel and Toby Jones Official Selection at Cannes Film Festival. “…an impressive feature debut with this gripping historical horror-thriller.” Justin Chang. Variety THE WITCH (Mexican Premiere) Dir. Robert Eggers (The Tell-Tale Heart, Hansel and Gretel) Cast: Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie Premiered at Sundance Film Festival. “…offers a compelling vision of life pushed to extremes. A gorgeously executed picture that prizes its characters as much as the elements of genre film.” Fantastic Fest WHAT WE BECOME (Latin American Premiere) Dir. Bo Mikkelsen (First Feature) Cast: Mille Dinesen, Toels Lyby and Ole Dupont Premiered at Fantastic Fest. In the new American Specials program, we present the following American films that have won critical acclaim and set box-office records, among them the Mexican Premieres of: “Depp shines in a solid gangster biopic.” Todd McCarthy. The Hollywood Reporter BLACK MASS(Mexican Premiere) Dir.

The most important among them is the fact that chemical nickel plating has high protective qualities and it is more effective to aggressive environment in comparison with electroless nickel. The technology provides more qualitative covering of not only the products of metal, cast iron, plastic but of inorganic dielectrics which include ceramics, glass, porcelain, glimmer, ceramized glass and ferrites. Advantage: offered technology has high effectiveness and quality and is profitable economically The technology allows electroless nickel plating of ferrous and alloy steels, cast iron articles, as well as for coating of plastic, glass, ceramics, and so on. Electroless nickel plating is widely implemented thanks to the valuable properties of its coating: – high uniformity, – high hardness, – significant corrosion resistance and wear resistance. Electroless nickel plating has higher protective properties than nickel electroplating. Protective properties of electroless nickel plating are defined not only by their own chemical resistance of the deposited metal, but by its structural features. Electroless-reduced nickel after may be used to cover wear parts and the parts which operate under high temperature conditions. It is found that the electroless nickel plating is less porous than electroplating of the same thickness. Determining porosity of nickel plating of different thickness, it was found that under porosity parameter electroless-reduced Ni-plating 8-10mm thick corresponded to electrolytic precipitations 20 microns thick. It should also be noted that the plating obtained by electroless method contain hydrogen several times less than electroplating. The ability to protect the main material against corrosion under the following conditions is important for nickel-coated products: – at high temperatures (560-625°C) – and the pressure of 1250 MPa, in the air and steam environments. Because of its specific properties nickel-plating finds application in many fields of mechanical and instrument engineering: – coating of metal articles of complex profile (with deep channels and blind holes); – to improve wear resistance of wearing surfaces of machine parts; – to improve corrosion resistance in boiling alkali media; – to replace chromium coating (with subsequent thermal treatment of electroless nickel); – to use cheaper steel with chemical nickel plating instead of corrosion-resistant steel; – for nickel plating of large-size equipment; – for coating of plastics, glass, ceramics and etc.. There were conducted comparative tests of nickel plated coatings. Under conditions of these test there was proved – that the products coated with nickel by electroless method have higher protective capacity than those coated by electroplating method. Conducted tests showed that Ni-coated samples of 25 micron thick do not change their appearance after spraying them with a solution of sodium chloride in the corrosion chamber over 8 days; after spraying outdoors – over 80 days; in water, heated up to 82°C (with air blow) – for 42 days. Also as a result of the tests of electroless nickel plating and nickel electroplating regularly sprayed in a corrosion chamber with 3% sodium chloride solution, there was proved – that the corrosion pits appear on electroless coatings, but further surface damage does not take place even after 2000 hours of tests, while they spread quickly coatings made by electroplating. Additionally, for purposes to compare the use of electroless nickel plating to protect the parts against corrosion under conditions of tropical climates, we used steel samples which were coated in solution. – And also samples with coatings made by nickel electroplating (matte-finished and glazed-finished). The samples were placed in a chamber for 21 hours at a temperature of 35 ± 2 and 20 ± 2°C. The first corrosion pits on the samples with coating made by nickel electroplating showed up on the matte-finished nickel -in 7 day after testing, on glazed-finished nickel – in 14 days. Corrosion pits occurred on none of the samples with coating made by electroless nickel plating within 84 days of testing. In 14 days a thin purple film occurred on them and remained until the end of testing. By assumption of scientists the presence of this film contributed to enhancing of the corrosion resistance of these coatings. Testing the samples under conditions of sub-tropical climate, indoor with humidity and temperature of the outer atmosphere, – coating made by electroless nickel plating were also covered with an oxide film of purple color and it remained within two years. It should be added that with the help of electroless nickel plating the problem of creation of light and wear-resistant friction pairs made of different aluminum alloys can be solved. Electroless nickel plating may be used to coat non-metallic materials (plastics and inorganic dielectrics). Inorganic dielectrics include ceramics, glass, porcelain, mica, glass ceramics, and ferrites. Metallization of inorganic dielectrics is used to make the following surface properties to the metal parts: – Conductivity – Ability to soldering, – Thermal conductivity. Metallization of glass is used to produce mirrors. Silicate materials (glass, quartz, glass ceramics, mica, etc.) at first are subject to chemical degreasing, and then are treated in a special solution. Parts made of non-metallic materials with metal coatings are widely introduced in radio engineering, automotive and other industries, so the question of the methods of electroless plating of metals combined with galvanic one is up-to-date. If you are interested – we will provide additional information and designer’s supervision over implementation of the technology. p.s.

Suntory is planning to leave their whiskeys on the International Space Station for at least a year to see if it will accelerate maturation. Can you really hurry a good thing? Aaron Goldfarb Updated 04.14.17 9:52AM ET / Published 08.08.15 12:01AM ET Aging whiskey is somehow both the simplest thing in the world…and a process the (mostly) old men who do it might not even fully understand. The simple part: a distilled white spirit—typically corn-based in America—is put into a barrel—typically charred oak in America—and then left to sit around for a decent stretch of time. The complex part: over these many years, the climate’s changing temperatures cause the whiskey to seep into the wood, then get pushed back out, extracting with it flavorful compounds like vanillins and hemicellulose which naturally linger in the barrel staves. Whatever the case, when the whiskey ultimately comes out of the barrel, the product will be darker, have (usually) had the white dog’s rough edges smoothed away, and become a now-complex offering packed with flavors such as caramel, vanilla, and even tobacco. Unfortunately, creating great whiskey has always meant dealing with that annoying little time factor. Straight bourbon legally must be aged for two years, someone like Eddie Russell (the co-master distiller at Wild Turkey) has told me he thinks bourbon hits its sweet spot around six years, and, of course, some of the world’s most coveted bourbons, ryes, and scotches often take ten to upwards of twenty-something years to become truly divine. But what if there was a way to cheat the system? Why, you’d immediately revolutionize the industry and surely become quite rich in the process. Suntory doesn’t exactly need to revolutionize the industry any more that it already has, and it’s already plenty rich enough, but this ancient Japanese distillery is still trying. This week, the world’s fourth-largest liquor company announced that on August 16 they will send some of their whiskey to the Japanese Experiment Module “Kibo” aboard the International Space Station. Interestingly, the six glass flasks being sent aren’t even new whiskey. Instead, Suntory is sending ten, eighteen, and twenty-one-year-old whiskeys, planning to leave them on the station for at least a year. Reportedly, the company’s researchers believe storing the whiskey in an environment without temperature fluctuations or gravity could lead to a mellower flavor profile upon its return to earth. “Our company has hypothesized that ‘the formation of high-dimensional molecular structure consisting of water, ethanol, and other ingredients in alcoholic beverages contributes to the development of mellowness,’” notes Suntory’s mumbo-jumbo-y press release. At first glance, this may seem like a gimmick, similar to Ninkasi Brewing’s recent “out of this world” experiment. Last year, the Eugene, Oregon brewery rocketed several vials of yeast 400,000 miles above earth, seeing if anything might happen to it. When it returned, brewery scientists found nothing had really been altered chemically, and the resulting Ground Control Imperial Stout got fairly pedestrian reviews. Having said that, back in 2011, noted Scottish distillery Ardbeg also sent to the International Space Station half a liter of scotch terpenes alongside shards of charred oak inside a NanoRacks MixStix. Once aboard the station an astronaut activated the experiment, causing the spirit to mix with the oak particles to simulate barrel-aging. Though the vials returned to earth in September of last year, we are still awaiting the results of Head of Distilling & Whisky Creation Dr. Bill Lumsden’s exhaustive studies, the findings of which will eventually be released in a white paper. A slightly less interesting, but perhaps more viable place whiskey has been aged is on a boat. While fishing with a friend, Trey Zoeller, the founder and master blender of Jefferson’s Bourbon, had an idea: what about aging his bourbon at sea? He figured that just maybe, the constant sloshing of the bourbon due to the natural waves of the ocean might cause the product to age faster. Conveniently, Zoeller had a friend, Chris Fischer, who was the founder of OCEARCH, a great white shark tracking group. Fischer allowed Zoeller to put a few barrels of unaged white whiskey on his boat when the researcher went off on his next global tracking mission. Some four years later, Zoeller tried the bourbon and was stunned. “The bourbon went in (the barrels) clear as water and came out black,” he told NPR. “Bourbon always picks up color in the barrel, but this four-year-old bourbon was darker than thirty-year-old bourbon.” What had happened was the more frequent than usual contact with the barrel wood had stripped away bad, astringent flavors quicker than usual, while helping the positive flavors become faster extracted from the wood. As a bonus, the sea air had also somehow gotten into the exposed barrels as well, adding a unique briny taste to the bourbon. First released in just a few-hundred bottles in 2012, Jefferson’s Ocean is one of the most intriguing bourbons I’ve ever tasted, one actually worth its higher $85 price tag. Others clearly agree, as it has become a now regular expression in Jefferson’s catalog. They are now on “Voyage No. 4,” which was released earlier this year, and Zoeller often notes: “I can tell the difference between each voyage.” Maybe his method isn’t so bizarre. As Zoeller told Food & Wine: “Whiskey was aged for the first time when it was floated down the Mississippi then up to New York. This was the original maturation process.” Somewhat luckily for Jefferson’s, they don’t actually distill their own bourbon, so they have plenty of time to worry and wonder about aging techniques. Jefferson’s buys most all of their bourbon already aged from factory distilleries like MGP in Indiana. Furthermore, recent batches of Ocean have seen barrels already six- and seven-years-old put aboard the boats. At the same time, some craft distilleries have opted for aging their whiskeys via methods that don’t have them deciding whether to put their distillate on planes, trains, and/or automobiles. These companies are banking on that fact that it’s less important where whiskey has been aged, and more important how it has been. Virginia’s Copper Fox Distillery tries to speed up the aging process with a tea-bagging-like method, adding a mesh sack of toasted oak and apple wood chips to the distillate for a year. Meanwhile, the Tuthilltown distillery in upstate New York ages its Hudson Baby Bourbon in tiny, three gallon barrels to facilitate more wood contact (traditionally, bourbon is aged in 53-gallon barrels). Additionally, low-frequency sound waves pulse through the aging warehouse at all times, the distillers believing it agitates the liquid, causing even more barrel contact. There’s also Cleveland Whiskey which pumps its white distillate briefly through barrels—to legally attain the designation “bourbon”—before adding it to stainless steel tanks with chopped-apart barrels. The tanks then undergo “disruptive pressure-aging technology,” causing the wood chunks to act almost as tiny sponges, pulling the liquid into their pores, then squeezing it back out again. The newly-released Highspire Rye is intriguingly aged in California wine barrels for 130 days with a blend of oak staves added inside. I must admit that, while many of these techniques sound like they might logically work, I’ve yet to find any that truly do. True, most of the aforementioned “rapidly-aged” whiskeys come in gorgeous bottles and have bombastic founders who are absolutely, 100% certain their whiskey is as good as the well-aged stuff you’ve actually heard of. Unfortunately, while I can tell you that none of the aforementioned booze tastes “bad” per se, none of them truly taste like anything other than young whiskey. So what’s next? Can the science of aging spirits actually be cheated? Is there some special place to put white dog whiskey that will truly speed up the process? Perhaps buried in the desert, atop a skyscraper, at the North Pole, or maybe even at the bottom of the ocean like the rum-maker Seven Fathoms has recently tried. Or maybe it’s more in discovering a special process that can act like a time machine. It still seems unlikely, but one man might have come closest to cracking the mysteries of aging. Though details are still scarce, Lost Spirits master distiller Bryan Davis has reportedly developed a patented, hyper-speed reactor that can provide the equivalent of twenty years of barrel-aging in just a week (and without a single barrel necessary). The few bottles of artificially aged single malts and rums he has already sent out into the world have been massive hits, lionized by geeks and critics alike. If his technique is proven truly viable when his prototype is finally unveiled to the public next month, Davis may very well revolutionize the way we all drink aged spirits. If not…well, many, many good men and women might be headed back to the drawing board.\n\ncc/2019-30/en_middle_0047.json.gz/line53\n\n__label__wiki\n\n0.873609\n\n0.873609\n\nESPN Axes Donovan McNabb, Eric Davis After Misconduct Investigation Danny Moloshok/Reuters ESPN has severed ties with former NFL stars Donovan McNabb and Eric Davis following an investigation into alleged sexual misconduct at the NFL Network.

Margaret Carlson Updated 02.19.18 9:52AM ET / Published 02.17.18 2:54PM ET Fox News host Laura Ingraham spent a segment of Friday’s show defending herself against charges of racism. She was just making a joke, a pun, a funny aside, really, when she said that Cavaliers basketball player LeBron James should just “shut up and dribble.” She was offended when he said in a video that President Donald Trump “doesn’t understand the people, and really don’t give a f--- about the people.” She could have apologized in that non-apologetic way famous people have of being sorry in the off-chance someone was offended. But why do that when you’ve got a made-for-TV ratings hit? There’s James, whom she went after for trying to go pro a year early, and for his \"barely intelligible, not to mention ungrammatical,\" way of speaking versus a right wing anchor of the sort Fox cloned until its sexual harassment scandal sent it’s most famous scurrying for higher ground. While James was growing up poor and fatherless to become a successful businessman, model father, and pillar of the community, Ingraham was becoming rich and famous by way of Dartmouth College where she was known for hunting and bagging liberals as an editor at the conservative Dartmouth Review. Her most hateful stunt was sending a reporter to infiltrate a gay group on campus taking down names and addresses. Ingraham then wrote letters outing those students to their parents. She regretted that publicly when she found out many years later that her brother was gay and later that his partner was dying from AIDs, as if treating a gay person properly was possible only if you had one in the family. She didn’t discover a black relative so she never took back attacking an African American professor for being himself, including having hair resembling “a used Brillo pad.” In taking after James, Ingraham is in step with Trump whose favorite sports figures are white owners, coaches and quarterbacks. Commenting While Black violates the unspoken sports ideal where whites sit in the expensive seats watching blacks throw a ball for their entertainment expecting them to always be seen and not heard. For weeks, Trump took time away from TV watching and golf, with Ingraham’s approval, to urge owners to fire any African-Americans who dared to take a knee to protest police killing unarmed black men on behalf of those who don’t have a voice. Does anyone think that the first to kneel, Colin Kaepernick a record-setting quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, being benched is not Trump’s dream come true? Ingraham found two black commentators to come on Friday night to confirm that she was right to take on the uppity James deemed “a clown” who should be “fired by the NBA” and extol Trump as the jobs president for blacks. Ingraham spent a lot of time expanding on a statement put out earlier by Fox that with “shut up and dribble” she was simply paying homage to her book Shut Up & Sing. She believes a polemic of 15 years ago is such a cultural touchstone, like Star Wars or Harry Potter, she can drop a reference into conversation and everyone gets it. To make her point, she cited another of her bon mots like telling Jimmy Kimmel to “Shut Up & Make Us Laugh,” and this week counseling San Antonio Spurs’ Gregg Popovich to “Shut up & Coach.” Of course, both of them were spouting liberal sentiments at odds with Trump on health care and guns. She granted herself immunity to criticize anyone who veers into her lane of political punditry, rightly reserved for her and the High Church of Fox. She had no criticism when another sports celebrity, Tim Tebow former Denver Broncos quarterback who appeared in a pro-life commercial famously broadcast during the Super Bowl in 2010. On this long weekend celebrating President’s Day, maybe Ingraham will have time to watch more of the video where James admired the cop on the beat in his childhood neighborhood and how he works hard at being the good father his absent father was not. Foretelling what was to come, he brought up how some people, no matter what you become in life, will always remind you that you are beneath them recalling the racial epithet spray painted on the front gate of his house. For his part, James posted \"#wewillnotshutupanddribble\" on his Twitter Friday night along with a picture of a neon sign that read \"I am more than an athlete.\" Away from the klieg lights Ingraham might ask what Ronald Reagan, her former idol and boss, would do. There’s no explaining how she got from him to a blowhard nationalist with a spotty relationship to the truth like Trump, except in her desire to be with a winner and pass Fox’s loyalty test. James vowed to repaint the fence and build it taller. Let’s tune in Tuesday to see what Ingraham is going to do. Editor's Note: This column has been updated to correct an error. It previously stated that Ingraham's brother had suffered from AIDS. It was her brother's partner.\n\ncc/2019-30/en_middle_0047.json.gz/line55\n\n__label__wiki\n\n0.965186\n\n0.965186\n\nDriverless Bus Collides With Pedestrian in Vienna The accident put a self-driving bus trial on hold. FOX & EPA FRIENDS Watchdogs Call on EPA to Probe Its Dealings With Fox News Maxwell Tani Media reporter Updated 12.13.18 10:47AM ET / Published 12.13.18 10:46AM ET Two left-leaning government watchdog groups on Thursday called upon the EPA to launch an internal investigation into whether the agency broke federal laws in its friendly coordination with Fox News. Last month, The Daily Beast reported that before an interview with former EPA Chief Scott Pruitt last year, a Fox & Friends producer sent a script to be approved by the EPA’s communications team. In a letter to the EPA’s office of inspector general on Thursday, Democracy Forward and Restore Public Trust said the EPA may have “violated federal laws that prohibit government funds from being expended to engage in covert propaganda” by approving the script without disclosing it had been government approved. “The Trump administration has a history of deceiving the public, and this is just another glaring example,” said Caroline Ciccone, Restore Public Trust’s executive director. “The American people expect that government officials honor long-established boundaries between the government and the press - and shouldn’t be using the media as its own publicist.”\n\ncc/2019-30/en_middle_0047.json.gz/line56\n\n__label__cc\n\n0.709504\n\n0.290496\n\nUsing creativity to bridge the mental health divide By Lalita Kaplish | The Researcher’s View For the seventh in our series on the Asylum and Beyond, Victoria Tischler considers creativity as a way to share experiences of mental illness. I’ve been thinking about the line between those living with mental health problems and without. As someone who works in the field it is often obvious, even at social events, which side you are on. Anyway, it isn’t really a divide at all, it’s a continuum and we all fall somewhere along it. An artwork in Crichton Royal Hospital archive by William Bartholomew – ‘Cake Month – ain’t it ridik’lus?’ (1861) – reminds me of the plethora of factors involved in mental illness and of the power of art to captivate. The decorative and stylized work features a jumble of text, bizarre and seemingly unconnected images and historical references, reminiscent of a word (and image) salad. ‘Cake Month – ain’t it ridik’lus?’ Drawing by William Bartholomew, 1861. Library reference: DGH/1/7/3/1/17. Bartholomew was treated at by W. A. F. Browne, the medical superintendent at Crichton from 1838–1857, a very early proponent of moral treatment, and an enthusiast for the use of art in mental health care. Browne recognized the artistic talent of his patients, authoring a treatise on ‘Mad Artists’ in 1880. Thus began the one of the earliest formative attempts to document the creative potential of mental health. Whether you ascribe to genetic, social or environmental causes, countless of us will experience mental illness, yet many remain reluctant to reveal this publicly. It’s mainly to do with stigma and fear. People are afraid, of a world upside down, rather like that portrayed in another work by an unknown Crichton patient – the ‘Dipsomaniac’. Seascape with upside down view. Watercolour by unknown patient at Crichton Royal Hospital, 1850s. Inscription on reverse reads ‘Dipsomaniac’. Library reference: DGH/1/7/3/1/91. We continue to be haunted by images of the raving lunatic of yore locked up, out of view. Madness has long been associated with otherworldly possession, deviance and criminality. In the past incarceration in an asylum was a spectacle; worthy of public visitors, for others out of sight was out of mind. This dilemma still resounds in the public imagination; a place where morbid fascination meets denial. Even more pertinent nowadays is the prejudice and discrimination that those living with mental health problems experience. In some respects contemporary mental healthcare has not changed much. Asylums that were once places of respite are now voluntary yet locked repositories for the mad and insufferable, offering scant regard to aesthetics. The closure of asylums and moves to provide care in the community mean that mental health problems are more visible yet the stigma remains. High profile revelations by people such as Professor Jamie Hacker Hughes, Vice President of the British Psychological Society, and celebrities such as Emma Thompson and Catherine Zeta-Jones about episodes of mental illness have brought the issue into the mainstream, although the dark shadow remains. As someone who has worked in the mental health field in clinical, academic and voluntary sectors for more than two decades, I still struggle with how best to help those who experience mental health problems. Using powerful art as its focus, and led by those with lived experience of mental health problems, the ‘Expert by Experience’ led organisation, Daily Life Ltd, uses innovative and creative methods to challenge stigma and negativity and to change thinking about mental health. A recent Daily Life Ltd event- The Roving Diagnostic Unit Late Spectacular – demonstrated how role modelling, authenticity and creativity could engage the public in a fun, playful and attractive way. These latter factors are key. Mental health issues are not typically associated with fun, play and attractiveness. Power pants at the Roving Diagnostic Unit Late Spectacular. Image credit: Priya Mistry. A stellar line up of talented artists including Dylan Tighe and Priya Mistry (my personal highlights) mesmerised their audiences and got people involved, indeed some proudly wore their personalised Power Pants all night long! The evening culminated with a performance by the enigmatic and legendary Bobby Baker, artistic director of Daily Life Ltd. The entire event embraced and enhanced by the wondrous ambiance of the William Morris gallery. It was all about mental health but it didn’t feel like it. It was quite simply an amazing and memorable night out. This approach works yet I wouldn’t advocate it for everyone. Mental health is fluid, and people are heterogeneous, so one approach doesn’t suit all. There is still much to do and to learn, especially from people with experience of mental illness. They continue to live with multiple and severe disadvantage. In parts of the world, being mentally ill means being physically chained up, some remain shackled by pharmaceuticals or demons within them, provoked by childhood adversity or other traumatic experiences. Social and economic inequality divides us all, not just those who experience ill health. Yet we all retain the capacity to be creative. Creativity offers a bridge across the divide between those who experience mental illness and those who don’t, in doing so it can create connections and profound change. Victoria Tischler is a freelance curator, researcher and psychologist. Her research interests focus on art and mental health. art Asylum and beyond Mental healthcare digitisation patients therapies One Response to Using creativity to bridge the mental health divide Mentally unhealthy I really don’t agree that it is obvious ‘which side of the line’ people are on. If you look around a room, some may obviously have mental health issues. On a bad day, I’ll be one of them. However, do you then assume that all others are mentally healthy? Even people you know and think are mentally healthy may not be. I hid my mental health issues for as long as I could, in fact it took a long time for me to identify that I had mental health issues. Also, I don’t believe that there is a black and white line. People are not either mentally healthy or unhealthy. I think it is a continuance. I’m sorry, I don’t think that your comments help the stigmatisation issues. It comes across as increasing the divide between healthy and unhealthy. Of course, the reality is that everyone has a mental health status, mine just happens to not be so good right now.

By Tom Kensler Chris Copeland. (Associated Press) BOULDER – Chris Copeland completed his eligibility at Colorado almost six years ago, but he has made the 15-player roster of the New York Knicks, making him one of the NBA’s most unlikely rookies. He will turn 29 years of age in March. Copeland, a 6-foot-8 forward from Richmond, Va., averaged 7.5 points and 3.8 rebounds during his college career (2002-06). After leaving CU, Copeland played in European leagues for teams in Belgium, Germany and Spain. He also played for Fort Wayne of the NBA’s D-League, but earned his spot on the Knicks roster with his play on the team’s summer league squad, where he averaged 13.8 points. Copeland became the fourth former CU player on a current NBA roster — the first time ever for the school to have four in the pros in the same season. He joins joins Chauncey Billups (L.A. Clippers, injured), Alec Burks (Utah Jazz) and Cory Higgins (Charlotte Bobcats). Comments Off on Another former Colorado player makes NBA — remember Chris Copeland? Categories: College Basketball, University of Colorado Summer play of point guard enables Colorado to sign 6-8 Dustin Thomas Entering the current recruiting season, Colorado men’s basketball coach Tad Boyle was searching primarily for wing guards. Mission completed. Boyle and his staff have received an oral commitment from 6-foot-5 Jaron Hopkins, a four-star talent from Mesa, Ariz., who coaches hope will follow in a lineage of scoring wing guards to come through the program: Cory Higgins, Alec Burks and Carlon Brown. In addition to Hopkins, Boyle would have loved to have landed 6-5 Jabari Bird, had the five-star prospect not committed last week to Pac-12 rival California. The Buffs also wondered if they needed another ball-handling guard. But the solid play of freshman point guard Eli Stalzer during the team’s five-game summer tour of Europe allowed the Buffs to use their second scholarship on a 6-8 forward: Dustin Thomas of Texarkana, Texas. Thomas averaged 20 points and 14 rebounds as a high school junior. He could fit right in as a replacement for 6-7 Buffs forward Andre Roberson — as soon as next season if Roberson has a big year and decides to turn pro. My take: The 6-3 Stalzer appears to be a steal as a spring signee. Look for the former Mater Dei HS (Santa Ana, Calif.) teammate of prior CU signee Xavier Johnson to get important minutes this season. And credit his performances during CU’s European tour for enabling Boyle to go after Thomas and help the overall roster. Categories: College Basketball, Pac-12, Recruiting, University of Colorado Colorado basketball eyes small forward Tre’shaun Lexing in Tacoma Those who criticize the July evaulation period for college basketball recruiting as a “meat market” may be overlooking what it can do for the prospective student-athlete. Tre’shaun Lexing, a 6-5 1/2, 195-pound small forward at Tacoma (Wash.) Lincoln HS, watched his offer list grow in quantity and quality after competing last week at a tournament in Las Vegas. Lexing presumably was spotted by Colorado’s coaching staff and, according to Rivals.com, left Las Vegas with a CU offer. According to the recruiting-based website, Lexing also now has offers from Washington State, Gonzaga and Oregon State. Prior to the Las Vegas event, it appeared his best offers came from Boise State and Santa Clara. Lexing, who averaged 18 points, 11 rebounds and five assists as a junior, told Rivals.com that he expects to take an official visit to Colorado in September. Colorado’s Tad Boyle and his staff seem to be scouring the nation, and especially the West, in search of a quality “2 or 3” wing (shooting guard or small forward) type of player with big upside, perhaps hoping to land the next Cory Higgins or Alec Burks. As a senior-to-be, Lexing can sign a national letter of intent during the November signing period. Comments Off on Colorado basketball eyes small forward Tre’shaun Lexing in Tacoma Categories: College Basketball, Pac-12, Prep sports, Recruiting, University of Colorado Colorado Buffs hoops recruiting 6-foot-5 guards The Colorado men’s basketball team has lost three tall guards in recent years — Cory Higgins, Alec Burks and Carlon Brown — so it’s no surprise that head coach Tad Boyle and his staff are recruiting to fill that position. Adam Munsterteiger of the local Rivals.com site BuffStampede.com uncovered two CU targets for the current recruiting cycle: 6-foot-5 Brandon Parrish of Arlington (Texas) Juan Seguin HS and 6-5 Elliott Pitts of Concord (Calif.) De La Salle HS. Both are seniors-to-be and can sign in November. Pitts said he received an offer from Colorado among a list that also includes California, Arizona, Boston College and others. Parrish said CU coaches said they would like to evaluate him during the summer tournaments. “I am hearing they really like me,” Parrish told Rivals.com. “They don’t have that many scholarships for my class, so while I am high on their list they want to evaluate me further in July.” Parris said he already has offers from Kansas State, Oregon State, Tulane and Rice. Comments Off on Colorado Buffs hoops recruiting 6-foot-5 guards Categories: College Basketball, College Sports, Pac-12, Prep sports, Recruiting, University of Colorado Scouting report: Buffs outshot Oregon in previous meetings; Ducks scored more Here are some things to consider in tonight’s Pac-12 tournament quarterfinal between sixth-seeded Colorado (20-11) and No. 3 seed Oregon (22-8), with much of the research by the CU sports information department. *** The last time a No. 6 seed ousted a No. 3 from the Pac-12 tournament occurred in 2009, a Southern California win over California. That Trojans team went on to become the only No. 6 seed to win the tournament title. *** Tonight, senior forward Austin Dufault will tie the Colorado record for most career men’s basketball games. Cory Higgins (2007-11) holds the record with 132 games. *** Colorado made only one 2-pointer Wednesday night in the 53-41 victory over No. 11 seed Utah. That was a trey by Andre Roberson in the first half. Colorado went one-for-11 from 3-point range, and better shooting likely will be needed tonight against Oregon. But Roberson’s trey at least continued CU’s string of 326 consecutive games with at least one made 3-pointer. *** Although Oregon has outscored Colorado 80.5 to 76.5 in the two regular-season meetings, the Buffs outshot Oregon from the field: 41 percent to 48 percent. The deciding factor? Rebounding. Oregon’s 33 to 28.5 edge on the boards enabled the Ducks to get a total of 18 more field-goal attempts than Colorado for the two games. Comments Off on Scouting report: Buffs outshot Oregon in previous meetings; Ducks scored more Categories: College Basketball, College Sports, Pac-12, University of Colorado Congrats to CU’s Roberson for making coaches’ all-Pac-12, but … … I think it’s ridiculous for the coaches to pick a 10-man, all-Pac-12 “first team.” Andre Roberson, the only player in the Pac-12 averaging a double-double with 11 points and 11 rebounds per game, should be a shoo-in for a five-player all-Pac-12 team. Having it a 10-man team dilutes the impact, significance and prestige of being named “all-conference.” And if the Pac-12 insists on a 10-man first team, why does it only have a five-man second team? What sense does that make? The ridiculous seems even more ridiculous. Roberson is on the Pac-12 all-defensive team (Thank God, that’s a five-man team), and Colorado’s Spencer Dinwiddie made the five-man all-freshman team. I don’t have a problem with Jorge Gutierrez of California earning Pac-12 player-of-the-year honors. The coaches realize that the former Denver Lincoln product does so much for the Bears at both ends of the court, much more than his stats could show. But I would have voted Colorado’s Tad Boyle as coach of the year (instead of Washington’s Lorenzo Romar). As a conference newcomer, CU finished in the upper division (tied for fifth) after having lost two players (Alec Burks and Cory Higgins) to the NBA and 75 percent of the 2010-11 scoring. The Pac-12 is down this year but I can brag to some of my sportswriter friends who cover other leagues that the Pac-12 all-stars would beat another more highly rated conference. Hey, it would be 10 players against five. Categories: College Basketball, Pac-12, University of Colorado CU men’s hoops frosh guard Dinwiddie scheduled to start Colorado men’s basketball is listing freshman guard Spencer Dinwiddie as a starter for tonight’s 8 o’clock season opener against Fort Lewis at the Coors Events Center. It’s been my experience in covering college hoops for more than three decades that when a freshman is put in the starting lineup for the first game it portends a bright future. Sure enough, in recent years, CU’s Richard Roby, Cory Higgins and Alec Burks were all opening-game starters. Dinwiddie has grown at least an inch since he signed with CU last November and is now listed at 6-feet-5. When he plays his natural position, he will be among the nation’s tallest point guards. A native Southern Californian, Dinwiddie averaged 11.2 points, 7.7 assists, 3.1 rebounds and 2.4 steals per game as a senior in leading Taft High a 29-3 record. He was named Los Angeles “City Section” player of the year. Dinwiddie told me recently that he figures senior Nate Tomlinson will be the point guard when Tomlinson is on the court. “It doesn’t matter to me where I play,” Dinwiddie said. “I’m just looking to contribute. Coach Boyle doesn’t like to categorize us. We’re just guards.” Dinwiddie is scheduled to be joined in the opening lineup by seniors Tomlinson, Austin Dufault and Carlon Brown, and sophomore Andre Roberson. Comments Off on CU men’s hoops frosh guard Dinwiddie scheduled to start CU men’s hoopsters getting no love in preview magazines On the way back from Colorado’s football game at Ohio State, I picked up a couple of college basketball preview magazines and quickly turned to the Pac-12 Conference section. CU is getting no love in the predictions. The Sporting News picks the Buffs to finish 11th in the Pac-12 standings, ahead of only fellow league newbie Utah. Athlon Sports doesn’t even give Colorado that much credit. It has the Buffs finishing last in the 12-team conference. Here’s an excerpt from the analysis of CU in the Sporting News, written by longtime Pac-12 beat writer Jon Wilner of the San Jose Mercury-News: “Colorado’s first season in the Pac-12 figures to be a rough one. No team inthe conference was hit harder by attrition than the Buffaloes (losing NBA first-round draft choice Alec Burks, 2000-point scorer Cory Higgins and fellow double-figure scorers Marcus Relphorde and Levi Knutson), and there isn’t a close second.” Wilner sounds like he believes he is doing Colorado a favor by not picking the Buffs to finish all the way at the bottom: “There is so little proven talent that the Buffs could finish last in the new-look league. But (head coach Tad) Boyle did such a marvelous coaching job last season … he’s worth a run in the standings himself.” Athlon writes: “The Buffs have to meet or exceed last year’s performance in three areas to give themselves a shot at being relevant in their first season in the Pac-12. They must improve defensively, be mentally and physically tougher in the post and continue to make the Coors Events Center a difficult place for opponents to get a win.” My take: I’m not sure Colorado has enough firepower or post presence to contend in its debut season in the Pac-12, but I would be surprised if the Buffs don’t surprise — and finish better than predicted, perhaps much better. My guess is that the Pac-12 teams located at sea level (which is most of them) will find it difficult to keep up with Boyle’s up-tempo pace in the rarefied air of Boulder. If CU can win most of its home games, that alone will enable the Buffs to climb in the standings. Sophomore rebounding machine Andre Roberson will focus more on offense this season, and points are expected to come from Utah transfer Carlon Brown and freshman guards Spencer Dinwiddie and Askia Booker. By the way, in the Mountain West, the Sporting News has Colorado State fourth, Air Force fifth and Wyoming eighth (last). Athlon has CSU fourth, Wyoming fifth and Air Force seventh. In the Sun Belt: Denver is picked for fourth in the West Division by the Sporting News, third by Athlon. In the Big Sky: defending champ Northern Colorado is picked to finish fourth by the Sporting News and sixth by Athlon. CU hoops recruit on ESPNU top 100 [media-credit name=”Hyoung Chang, The Denver Post” align=”alignright” width=”270″] [/media-credit] Lewis-Palmer's Josh Scott has cracked the ESPNU's top 100 recruits. Recruiting continues to look promising and exciting for the Colorado men’s basketball program. Josh Scott, a 6-foot-10 center who is about to begin his senior year at Lewis-Palmer High in Colorado Springs, is now on the ESPNU recruiting list of the nation’s top 100 prospects. Scott is ranked No. 99 — the only Coloradan on the ESPNU list. He gave an oral commitment to CU last spring and at that time said he will sign a national letter of intent with the Buffs in November during the early signing period. Amazingly, CU now has two all-time leading men’s scorers What were the odds of Cory Higgins finishing his CU men’s basketball career tied with Richard Roby (2004-08) atop the school charts at 2,001 points? They had to be astronomical. I know I have never seen another school with co-leaders in career scoring. Nothing against Roby, but I’m sure most were pulling for Higgins to claim the top spot to himself because this was new and fresh, and it’s always fun to see records broken. And to think that another basket by Higgins would have beaten Alabama and sent CU into the NIT championship game. Roby and Higgins overlapped one season, playing together in 2007-08, when Roby, a 6-6 guard, was a senior and the 6-5 Higgins was getting his feet wet as a freshman. Higgins told me countless times that he respected Roby for helping him “learn the ropes” of the college game. “I saw how he handled himself that year, with the team and with the media as the leader,” Higgins told me recently. Higgins became the team spokesman beginning in his sophomore season. And certainly not to be overlooked or forgotten is Brittany Spears completing her eligibility this season as the CU women’s all-time leading scorer with 2,185 points. It was a privilege to cover them for the past four seasons. Comments Off on Amazingly, CU now has two all-time leading men’s scorers What will next season’s CU men’s hoops lineup look like? With the 2010-11 season for the Colorado’s men’s basketball team having come to a close in the NIT semfinals, Buffs fans can say their final good-byes to scholarship seniors Cory Higgins (16.1 points per game), Levi Knutson (11.7) and Marcus Relphorde (11.2), along with senior walk-ons Javon Coney and Trent Beckley. And if sophomore Alec Burks (20.5) declares for the 2011 NBA draft, the Buffaloes will face a major rebuilding year in Tad Boyle’s second year as coach after going 24-14 to set a school record for victories. Without Burks, here’s taking a stab at what Colorado’s 2011-12 starting line-up could look like, barring another late signing. POINT GUARD: Nate Tomlinson, 6-3, senior; or Spencer Dinwiddie, 6-4, freshman. GUARD: Carlon Brown, 6-5, senior GUARD OR FORWARD: Jeremy Adams, 6-5, sophomore; or Damiene Cain, 6-7, freshman. FORWARD: Andre Roberson, 6-7, sophomore. CENTER: Shane Harris-Tunks, 6-11, sophomore. Scoring must come from: Brown, a transfer from Utah who averaged 12.6 points in 2009-10 as a junior for the Utes; Adams, a transfer from Navarro (Junior) College in Texas, averaged 27 points as a high school senior in Mississippi before redshirting as a freshman at Texas A&M; Dinwiddie, from Woodland Hills (Calif.) Taft High School, who was ranked among the nation’s top 150 players by HoopScoop and will pose matchup problems for opponents as a tall point guard; And Roberson, a rebounding dynamo who is expected to make dramatic improvements in his offensive game. Tomlinson also will be asked to look more to the basket. And a recruit from California, 6-1 Askia Booker of Los Angeles Price, could be next year’s Knutson, with an ability to provide a spark and instant offense from off the bench. When going big, Boyle could use Cain, a 230-pound power forward from the L.A. area who is said to have natural rebounding skills like Roberson but could be further along offensively. Also vying for a starting position will be 6-9 senior Austin Dufault, who did a commendable job in playing out of position this season as the starting center when Harris-Tunks suffered a season-ending knee injury in October. My guess is Dufault will be utilized as a valuable backup to both Harris-Tunks and Roberson, as Boyle strives to get bigger and more athletic with his starting unit. Boyle could sign one more in April (it will be a surprise if he doesn’t land another post player), which could alter the rotation. Bottom line: If Burks returns, Colorado likely will once again be no worse than a bubble team for the NCAA Tournament. Without Burks, another NIT bid may be more likely. Next season’s roster is not devoid of talent, but there are many unknowns. Will Harris-Tunks live up the expectations? How much rust will Brown have to knock off after sitting out the season as a transfer? Can Roberson, Tomlinson, Dufault and sophomore-to-be Shannon Sharpe contribute more scoring? Will the newcomers come through? How will Colorado adjust to competition in the new Pac-12? In any case, Boyle seems to be building a solid foundation with recruiting. Two athletic, in-state junior forwards from Colorado Springs, 6-9 Josh Scott of Lewis-Palmer and 6-7 Wesley Gordon of Sierra, announced they will come aboard for the 2012-13 season. Perhaps CU’s Burks should talk to UCLA players ANAHEIM, Calif. — While preparing for today’s interview sessions at the West Regional here, I spotted an article in today’s Los Angeles Times that was of interest to me, and could — or perhaps even should — be of interest to Colorado sophomore guard Alec Burks. UCLA coach Ben Howland said a potential lockout of NBA players could influence his advice to Bruins players that, like Burks, are considering turning pro early. “I can tell you in the NBA, in my opinion, this is going to be a serious lockout,” Howland told the Times. “They will not be playing, in my opinion, next December and maybe even January. … You’re not even going to get paid next year for half the year.” Howland later was quoted in the article as saying it’s usually unwise for a player to declare early for the NBA draft without assurances that he will be among the first 15 players chosen. “I’ve done all the research,” Howland told the Times. “I mean, you look at the guys who get picked between (draft slots) 22 and 31 and where they are five years later, versus guys who are one-to-15. It’s vastly different when you look at career paths.” The latest NBAdraft.net mock draft has Burks being selected No. 8 by Cleveland. College nonseniors have until April 24 to declare for the draft and may withdraw by May 8 to retain their college eligibility. NBAdraft.net does not have Colorado senior Cory Higgins projected to be selected in the two-round NBA draft. But a former Buff, 6-4 senior shooting guard Xavier Silas of Northern Illinois, is projected to go No. 57 to the Los Angeles Lakers. Comments Off on Perhaps CU’s Burks should talk to UCLA players Did CU’s Boyle predict NCAA tourney bid for Buffs in near future? Hmmm. It sure sounds so. Regarding missing out on the NCAA Tournament, CU coach Tad Boyle said: “I feel bad for the seniors who won’t get to experience the NCAA Tournament. Our coaches will, the young players in our program will. But those five guys won’t, and I feel bad for them.” One current CU freshman, 7-foot center Ben Mills, could be a candidate to red-shirt next season, with the return of 6-11 Shane Harris-Tunks. But CU freshman forward Andre Roberson has three more years. Boyle, obviously, is not expecting a long rebuilding process as the Buffs look to replace current senior starters Cory Higgins and Marcus Relphorde, top sixth man Levi Knutson and sophomore Alec Burks, who likely will make himself available for the 2011 NBA draft. Boyle is counting on immediate contributions from three November signees, two guards and a forward from the Los Angeles area. And one or two additional recruits could be signed next month.

Categories: University of Colorado KSU’s Martin: CU bad matchup for us KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Kansas State entered Thursday’s Big 12 quarterfinal with Colorado riding as much momentum as any team in the league. The Wildcats had won six games in a row, eight of their last nine. The afternoon ended with Colorado beating Kansas State for a third time. No other team, not even Kansas, was able to beat KSU more than once. “They’re a hard matchup for us because their two wings (Alec Burks and Cory Higgins) are real good off trhe dribble,” KSU coach Frank Martin said, “and our weakness the whole year has been our (in)ability to guard the dribble. “That presents a problem for us. Alec obviously came out of the chute and was as aggressive as he can be. Then Cory played like a senior that was determined to get his team deep into this tournament and hopefully to play past this tournament. “They’re to be credited for that.” Comments Off on KSU’s Martin: CU bad matchup for us CU makes Pullen work — at both ends KANSAS CITY, Mo. – One of the keys to Colorado’s 87-75 victory Thursday over Kansas State, CU coach Tad Boyle said, was the defensive effort of Buffs senior guard Cory Higgins on the Wildcats’ Jacob Pullen. Higgins had some help – from what was happening at the other end, Boyle added. And that also involved Higgins. “The one thing today, (Pullen) had to expend a lot of energy on defense,” Boyle said. “They put him on Alec (Burks), then they put him on Cory. He was expending a lot of effort on that end of the floor, which sometimes he doesn’t have to do. “But against us, they has to do that.” Comments Off on CU makes Pullen work — at both ends Hoiberg: CU’s Higgins will get selected in NBA draft First-year Iowa State coach Fred Hoiberg spent 15 years in the NBA, as a player or executive, so it spoke volumes when, during Monday’s Big 12 coaches teleconference, Hoiberg said Colorado guards Alec Burks and Cory Higgins are “two players that I think will be (NBA) pros.” Burks, a 6-foot-6 sophomore, has long been considered a probable first-round NBA draft choice, as soon as this summer, if he chooses to come out early. Higgins? “I do (think he will get drafted),” Hoiberg said of the 6-5 Higgins, a senior. “He can play two positions (point guard and wing/shooting guard). He’s got very good size for a point guard. “And he can create his shots. He does a terrific job of getting to the free-throw line. That’s something that in the NBA … that’s a luxury to have, a guy that can create contact and get to the line. “He shoots the ball well. And he’s a very smart player. Having his dad (Charlotte Bobcats general manager and ex-NBA player Rod Higgins) having been in that league for a long time obviously will help him.” Iowa State (14-8, 1-6 Big 12) plays Tuesday night at Colorado (14-8, 3-4), beginning at 7 p.m. (telecast: FSN) Comments Off on Hoiberg: CU’s Higgins will get selected in NBA draft 20-point game by Knutson big lift for Buffs What should be really encouraging for the Colorado men’s basketball team after Wednesday night’s 74-66 victory at No. 21 Kansas State, is that the Buffaloes (13-4, 2-0 Big 12) were led in scoring by somebody not named Alec Burks or Cory Higgins. Senior guard Levi Knutson came off the bench raining 3-pointers and topped the Buffs with 20 points. That marked only the fourth time in 17 games that one of CU’s “big two” did not lead the team in scoring. Colorado guard Levi Knutson drives to the hoop during the Buffs' big win Wednesday night. Knutson did it in back-to-back November games against Texas-Pan American (18 points) and Oregon State (20). Junior forward Austin Dufault led the Buffs with 18 points in the 92-65 blowout of Maryland-Eastern Shore on Dec. 29. First-year CU coach Tad Boyle has been preaching to his players that the team needs balance to reach its potential and can’t count on Burks and Higgins every night. “When we struggled early in the season, it was because we weren’t taking good shots and weren’t sharing the ball,” Boyle said before the team departed for Manhattan, Kan. “I guys have figured that out.” It’s amazing that this marked the first time a CU men’s basketball team has defeated ranked opponents in consecutive games. Unfortuately, that says something about the lack of tradition. But it also says something about what the future may hold.

(Marty Caivano, Daily Camera) In recent years, the Colorado men’s basketball team has fared about as poorly against Missouri as has the CU football team. That means ugly blowouts. Colorado has lost eight straight to the Tigers, dating back to a Feb. 25, 2006 win by the Buffs in Boulder. Comments Off on CU players: Buffs fast-paced style better suited to play Mizzou Basketball Matters: Colorado State Duo leading Rams Resurgence By Christopher Dempsey FORT COLLINS – With most sports fans’ attention focused on Tim Tebow or Carmelo Anthony, Colorado State has flown under the radar as one of the better stories in the region. The basketball program is not just healing under fourth-year head coach Tim Miles, but is showing signs of thriving. And this season, which featured one huge Cancun Governor’s Cup tournament win highlighted by victories over Ole Miss and Southern Miss, he has leaned on the senior duo of Andy Ogide and Travis Franklin to lead the way. They are the first two players on every opponent’s scouting report, the duo that has to be stopped in order to have a shot at beating the Rams. From Baton Rouge, La. (Franklin) and Marietta, Ga. (Ogide) they are Colorado State’s ‘DSD.’ “Down South Duo,” said Franklin, smiling wide. Or, Dynamic Scoring Duo. At a combined average of 30 points per game, Ogide and Franklin account for 39.4 percent of the Rams points; and with a combined average of 12.3 rebounds the two account for 36.7 percent of the team’s rebounding output. If things are getting done these two are more than likely in the middle of it.

Jody tells us what's going on....... Maltese Falcon Fundraiser Today I met Captain Chris Gartner aboard the stunning Maltese Falcon (M.F.) to discuss the Dock Party Fundraiser they held recently for Jody. The M. F. was due to leave Falmouth Harbour, Antigua and weren’t scheduled to return until November 2007. The crew wanted a dock party and organised one at short notice on 27th March 2007. An hour before the party was due to start Second Officer Timmy Attard decided he wanted to make the party a fundraising event for Jody. Timmy is good friends with Arvid who was travelling in the car with Jody at the time of the accident. The news spread around the harbour like wildfire and within an hour around 200 people ascended upon the dock beside the M.F. The party revellers indulged in drinks and food from the BBQ all kindly provided by the M.F. The crew and guests partied hard to the sounds of DJ Van of Cay Electronics "
