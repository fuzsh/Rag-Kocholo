        "text": "A walking tour of Scottish Montreal - Main Tour\n\nMAIN TOUR\n\n1. Anglo-Boer War Memorial\n\n(Strathcona Horse Monument in Dorchester Square)\n\nDonald Smith, later Lord Strathcona, was born in Forres, Morayshire, Scotland, and was chief financier and promoter of the Canadian Pacific Railway. He served as Chancellor of McGill University, President of the Bank of Montreal and gave generously to Montreal institutions. This monument commemorates Lord Strathcona's patriotism and public service in raising and equipping the \"Strathcona's Horse\" Regiment. His portrait can be seen in bas-relief on the west side.\n\n2. Robert Burns Monument\n\n(Dorchester Square)\n\nRobert Burns, the famous Scottish poet and songwriter, was born in Ayrshire, Scotland, in 1759. He published his first poems in 1786 and his fame became widespread. This is one of several monuments erected across Canada in 1930 by the admirers of Burns. The Seagram's Building, on Peel just north of St. Catherine Street, has a number of typically Scottish features, including an homage to Robert Burns.\n\n3. The Windsor Hotel\n\n(1110 Peet Street)\n\nThis \"Grand Old Dame\" of Montreal hotels was opened with the St. Andrew's Ball on November 29, 1878, by Princess Louise (4th daughter of Queen Victoria) and the wife of the Marquis of Lorne, the Duke of Argyle and Governor General of Canada. The St. Andrew's Ball was held here (except for a few years in the 1960s) until the hotel closed in 1981. Scots such as Duncan McIntyre, William Notman and the architectural firm of Hutchison & Wood were prominently involved.\n\n4. Monument to Sir John A. MacDonald\n\n(Dorchester Square)\n\nJohn Alexander MacDonald was born on January 11th, 1815, in Glasgow, Scotland, and moved to Canada in 1820. As a Father of\n\nConfederation, Sir John A.

His goal was to expand and settle Canada across the continent by building a transcontinental railroad —the Canadian Pacific.\n\n5. Statue of Lord Mount Stephen\n\n(Windsor Station before entrance to concourse)\n\nGeorge Stephen was born on June 5th. 1829, in Duffton, Banffshire, Scotland. He came to Montreal in 1850 and began working in a wool clothing firm. His dynamic character led him to become the first president of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and then a director and President of the Bank of Montreal. He was a noted Montreal philanthropist and art collector. This statue, made in England and placed only slightly above ground level, stands as though ready to receive guests to his train station.\n\n6. Bell Canada Building\n\n(1050 Beaver Hall Hill)\n\nNamed for St. Andrew, the patron Saint of Scotland, St. Andrew's Church was founded in April 1803, and its new large and important church was built here on Beaver Hall Hill in 1850. When the congregation joined with that of St. Paul's church in 1918, the site was sold to the Bell Telephone Company. We cannot ignore the Scottish origins of Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, who spent much of his life in Canada. The Bell Telephone Company of Canada was founded in 1880 and its first President was Andrew Robertson of Paisley, Scotland.\n\n7. Strathearn House\n\n(1175 Place du Frère-André)\n\nThe home of William Dow, who was one of Montreal's important brewers and businessmen, was born in Muthill, Perthshire, Scotland, on March 27, 1800, and came to Canada in 1818 or 1819. By 1834 he opened his own brewery– William Dow and Company. He became a very wealthy man and invested in real estate, railways and banks. William Dow never married and lived by himself in this richly decorated stone mansion named, in the Scottish tradition, \"Strathearn House\" at the top of Beaver Hall Hill. The Engineers' Club moved in on May 12, 1907, and occupied the premises for several decades.\n\n8. Canada Cement Building\n\n(606 Cathcart Street)\n\nThe formation of this company, one of the largest in Canada, owes its existence to a well-known Canadian Scot — William Maxwell Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook, who descended on Montreal in 1907, fresh from financial triumphs in his native Maritime province. By his own account, his move to Montreal raised his fortune from about $700,000 to over $5,000,000 in just a few years.\n\n9.

Fur District\n\nFrom the Bay east to Bleury Street and for a few streets north is Montreal's fur district, the heart of Canada's fur industry. Some of the finest furs in the world are treated and designed into magnificent garments for sale worldwide.

The Black Watch Armoury\n\n(2067 Bleary Street at President Kennedy)\n\nThe Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada armoury was built in 1905.

The Regiment has always been a prominent organization in Montreal's Scottish community.\n\n13. Hutchison Street\n\nThis street is named after the Hutchison family of Ayrshire, Scotland, one of the oldest of Montreal's Scottish families whose properties had been sizable in this area since 1815.

It was designed by Percy Nobbs, a Scottish-born architect, who had a great influence on Montreal's development. The museum opened in this building in 1967 due, in large part, to a generous grant by the Stewart. family. One of the museum's great collections is some 400,000 photographic negatives produced by William Notrnan, who was born in Paisley, Scotland in 1826 and died in Montreal in 1891. He was the renowned chronicler of Victorian Nlonireal, Quebec and Canada.\n\n17.McGill University\n\n(801-865 Sherbrooke Street West)\n\nMcGill University'• international renown is due in large part to the generosity, ingenuity and dedication of Montreal's Scottish community.\n\nJames McGill\n\nJames McGill was born in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1744 of Scottish Presbyterian parents. He amassed a fortune as a partner in the North West Company of fur traders and was then involved in other businesses.

He bequeathed his 46 acre estate, Burnside, and a large sum of money for the establishment of the university.\n\nThe Macdonald Physics Building\n\nwas constructed in the early 1890s, an endowment of Sir William C. Macdonald, founder of the Macdonald Tobacco Company and generous benefactor of the University at the turn of this century.\n\nIt was one of the largest buildings in Canada to be built entirely of wood and masonry to avoid magnetic interference. Ernest Rutherford, the discoverer of radioactivity, worked here.\n\nThe Redpath Museum, donated by Peter Redpath, is located on the west side of the campus, and houses one of the most important and oldest natural history collections in Canada.
