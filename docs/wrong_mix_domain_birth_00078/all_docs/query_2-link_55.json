        "text": "Andy Roddick became the latest pro athlete to enter podcasting with “Served with Andy Roddick,” a tennis-themed show that launched just over a month ago, and he already has a licensing deal with the Tennis Channel to stream weekly episodes on its T2 FAST feed beginning Sunday.\n\nThe T2 agreement (signed live on the show Feb. 13, with no agency involvement) spans 24 episodes over about 30 weeks, concluding after the 2024 U.S. Open. Roddick and Tennis Channel declined comment on the fee the network is paying to stream it. Roddick has been a contributor with Tennis Channel since 2020, describing it as a great relationship. “The negotiations along the way have been very honest and direct. That’s all you can really ask. I understand they’re taking a leap. I don’t know that this show has really existed on the airwaves in tennis before. I certainly want to deliver for them.”\n\nIn its first 30 days, “Served” logged more than 270,000 downloads and views across platforms. It enters the weekend Apple’s 26th-ranked sports podcast in the U.S. (No. 1 in tennis) and Spotify’s 20th, with listeners in 136 countries. The 2003 U.S. Open champ and former world No. 1’s show has featured segments breaking down match play and Saudi Arabia’s looming presence in the sport with co-host and veteran tennis reporter Jon Wertheim, to interviews with four-time Grand Slam winner Kim Clijsters and SVP of IMG Tennis/head of clients Max Eisenbud.\n\n“I don’t think it’s a success yet. I think it’s interesting,” Roddick said. “The best thing is can be, for me, is differentiated from whatever else is out there. But frankly I’m having conversations I’m intrigued by.”\n\nBOOSTING T2: Bob Whyley, Tennis Channel SVP/content production and executive producer, noted the value-add comes from marketing the T2 offering. Introduced in March 2022, T2 streams live matches not broadcast on Tennis Channel and original programming, like its Red Zone-esque bounce-around show Second Serve. It is free on several popular streaming platforms, such as YouTube TV, Roku, Hulu, Fubo and Amazon Freevee.\n\n“[T2] has amazing distribution,” Whyley said. “We need to bring more awareness to where people can find it … and enjoy it. And what better person in our tennis world than Andy Roddick, and his show that he’s been producing for us, to let people know the channel exists and then be wildly entertained?”\n\nServed Media, Roddick’s nascent media company, and Duality Sports and Entertainment, via co-founder Mike Hayden, handle the production and delivery of the show to Tennis Channel, whose production team then prepares a 50 minute-1 hour cut to stream on Sunday evenings. Content and sponsorship rights to the show are owned by Roddick through Served Media, while Tennis Channel will be able to sell ads against the program on T2.\n\n“Tennis Channel has a podcast network, and it’s a lot of inside-baseball tennis podcasts. We’re in that space. We love having long-form conversation,” Whyley said. “We look at [“Served with Andy Roddick”] as our studio show designed to market T2, and we’re excited about that.”\n\nThe uncut, audio-only version of the podcast releases Tuesday mornings after the T2 streams, allowing space to record timelier segments early in the week, with full videos uploaded to the Served YouTube channel the following Sunday. Roddick recorded the first five episodes from his home office in Charlotte but will be moving to a recently completed studio in his backyard shed. “My wife kicked me out of our house,” he joked. “I like the [remote] work I do [for Tennis Channel], but it looks a little bit like 'The Blair Witch Project.'” So I’m glad we’re upgrading.”\n\nAs of now, SwingVision, a smartphone-based AI tracking app for tennis in which Roddick has invested, is the show’s only sponsor. That arrangement, Roddick said, is negotiated on a week-to-week basis and could fall to the wayside depending on discussions with others. “We have some six, seven sponsor calls next week,” he said. “We’ll see where we land with that market. ... I think the market will speak back to us, but we certainly are proud of what we are putting out.”"
