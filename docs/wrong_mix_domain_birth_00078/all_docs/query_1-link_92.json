        "text": "It’s match point for Andy Roddick’s Austin estate. The retired tennis pro and his model-and-actress wife, Brooklyn Decker, have put their impressive five-bedroom house on the market.\n\nIf you’ve got game — and $5.95 million — you might just net the stately-yet-approachable residence at 9709 Angelwylde Drive.\n\nDon’t worry, the couple with serious star wattage isn’t going far. Broker Jonathan Creath with Kuper Sotheby’s International Realty says that Roddick and Decker are simply downsizing to smaller digs in Austin. They’ll be keeping it weird for the foreseeable future.\n\nAfter all, the Andy Roddick Foundation working to close the educational achievement gap, was founded and is based in Austin. And on the sweeter side, Roddick and Decker recently invested in Austin staple Tiff’s Treats.\n\nIt’s no wonder why the Texas power couple and their son Hank and daughter Stevie fell in love with the luxury homebuilder Don Crowell’s original. The 7,369-square-foot mansion is on a secluded 15-acre site, ringed with trees, boasting unbeatable views of the Hill Country. You can take it all in on the one-third-mile drive up the long road leading to the estate.\n\nThe home boasts six-and-a-half baths, a new wine cellar, a redesigned kitchen with six-burner Wolf range, a full gym, an office with a wood-burning fireplace, a swimming pool, reclaimed pine floors and an owner’s “hideaway.”\n\nA Kitchen Ace\n\nThe mansion is a mix of vibes, with reclaimed wood beams from the Chicago Stock Exchange and exposed white-painted brick in the bathroom. The kitchen is the most stunning example of Roddick and Decker’s reinvention of the home they bought in 2013.\n\nLast year, Decker shared her love of the kitchen with People magazine. “We are people who live in our kitchen. It’s where we eat our meals, have our conversations, drink wine,” she told the magazine. She also mentioned that she splurged on the marble and the brass sink.\n\nRoddick and Decker paired the existing rustic touches of the kitchen with sleek white marble countertops extending up the walls and vent hood and slate blue-gray cabinets. It’s an unexpected vibe, but one that meshes well with Roddick and Decker’s eclectic, contemporary-chic aesthetic.\n\nOther original finishes by the couple: a massive temperature-controlled wine cellar and a new master bedroom created by adding on to the guest bedroom. The new master bedroom features a tasteful master bathroom, complete with an oversized shower and copper soaking tub. The luxurious standalone tub looks out over two full size windows into the wooded acres.\n\nRoddick and Decker sold property earlier this year — their North Carolina, four-bedroom mountain retreat for $2.35 million. In 2015, the couple sold their five-bedroom Los Angeles house for roughly $3.34 million.\n\nLike with those two, this Austin estate could soon be out of their hands. Ball’s in your court."
