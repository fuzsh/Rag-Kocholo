        "text": "Born in Nebraska, Andy Roddick, 32, grew up in Texas and began playing tennis professionally in 2000. By 2003, he had won the US Open and was the world’s top player. He was a Wimbledon finalist in 2004, 2005 and 2009, losing to Roger Federer each time. Now retired, he lives between Texas and North Carolina with his wife, the actor and model Brooklyn Decker, who is expecting their first child. He is a BBC commentator for Wimbledon 2015, which starts on Monday, 29 June.\n\nWhen were you happiest?\n\nNothing is better than right now, and having a baby is no small part.\n\nWhat is your greatest fear?\n\nSnakes. Unfortunately, where we live I run across them close to weekly.\n\nWhat is your earliest memory?\n\nWe lived in Nebraska when I was very young, and I have vague memories of the house and being stuck in snow.\n\nWhich living person do you most admire, and why?\n\nI look up to people such as Andre Agassi who use their fame as a pedestal for causes. He was great to me early on in my career.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in yourself?\n\nI’m pretty honest, for better or worse.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in others?\n\nIgnorance and being inconsiderate.\n\nWhat was your most embarrassing moment?\n\nMeltdowns on court.\n\nWhat is your most treasured possession?\n\nThe golf clubs.\n\nWhat is your favourite smell?\n\nPizza.\n\nWhat do you most dislike about your appearance?\n\nThat’s easy: my bald spot.\n\nWhat is your guiltiest pleasure?\n\nWine.\n\nWhat is your most unappealing habit?\n\nChewing my nails.\n\nWho would play you in the film of your life?\n\nStifler from American Pie.\n\nWhat is your favourite word?\n\nThe F word, because it’s a noun, adjective and a verb.\n\nWhat did you want to be when you were growing up?\n\nI always wanted to be a sportsman of some sort. My brother John was a tennis player, too, and my eldest brother Lawrence a diver. I don’t know where it came from – our parents were farmers.\n\nTo whom would you most like to say sorry, and why?\n\nMy parents, for all the stuff I put them through as a kid.\n\nWhat does love feel like?\n\nI am pretty shallow, so I’m not going to be as forthcoming with this as I was with the one about my favourite smell.\n\nWhat was the best kiss of your life?\n\nThe last one.\n\nWho would you invite to your dream dinner party?\n\nClose friends and family only. At my dream dinner, I wouldn’t want to go through that awkward getting-to-know-you process for an hour or so.\n\nWhat is the worst job you’ve done?\n\nI don’t feel like I’ve worked a day in my life.\n\nIf you could edit your past, what would you change?\n\nI’d love to have won Wimbledon.\n\nWhen did you last cry, and why?\n\nAt my oldest friend’s wedding.\n\nHow would you like to be remembered?\n\nHopefully with a hint of positivity.\n\nWhat is the most important lesson life has taught you?\n\nEvery time you think you have something figured out, there is a curve ball around the bend. So be adaptable."
