        "text": "Americans Andy Roddick and John Isner scored a winning home double into the quarter-finals of the ATP Winston-Salem Open, advancing in straight sets yesterday.\n\nTop seed and former number one Roddick – playing outside the top 20 for the first time in a decade – posted a tidy 6-1, 6-3 win over Santiago Giraldo. Isner, the number four, advanced 7-6, 6-2 against Finn Jarkko Nieminen.\n\nRoddick is pushing hard to return to his former glory, with the 2003 US Open champion forced to withdraw with his long-running abdominal injury from Washington and Montreal this month and losing in the Cincinnati first round last week.\n\nThe American went through in 66 minutes with five aces and never faced a break point. He is now into his fourth quarter-final of the year, and first since the grass court event in Queen’s Club in London.\n\nHe will get a further test when he plays Argentine seventh seed Juan Monaco, who beat Japan’s Kei Nishikori 6-0, 6-3.\n\nIsner, who was born in the North Carolina, sent over 10 aces in his 64-minute home victory over Nieminen to run his total so far from two matches to 27."
