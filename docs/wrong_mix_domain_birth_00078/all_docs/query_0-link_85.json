        "text": "NEWS ROUND-UP nec extends sponsorship of wheelchair tennis The ITF has renewed its sponsorship agreement with NEC Corporation as title sponsor of the NEC Wheelchair Tennis Masters and as an Official Partner of the ITF Wheelchair Tennis Tour for 2014. NEC has been a sponsor of the ITF Wheelchair Tennis Tour since its inception in 1992, and in November celebrated 20 years as title sponsor of the NEC Wheelchair Tennis Masters. Staged in 2013 in Mission Viejo, California, in 2014 the Masters will be held in Great Britain for the first time, at the Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre, formerly the venue of the London 2012 Paralympic Tennis Event, on 24-30 November. The ITF Wheelchair Tennis Tour has over 160 tournaments in more than 40 countries offering over $1.5 million in prize money, including wheelchair tennis events at all four Grand Slams. Sabine Ellerbrock in action at the 2013 NEC Masters winter 2013 obituary: Rene Simpson Collins Moya and Massu become Davis Cup captains Canada's Rene Simpson Collins died in October at the age of 47 following a year-long battle with brain cancer. Simpson Collins was a former player, coach and Fed Cup captain. She recorded a career-high singles ranking of No. 70 in April 1989 and was an accomplished doubles player, reaching a career-high ranking of No. 32, winning three titles and progressing to the quarterfinals at the 1996 US Open. Simpson Collins also represented Canada at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. Simpson Collins played Fed Cup for 11 years, accumulating a 20-16 win-loss record in 25 ties from 1988 to 1998. She was Fed Cup captain from 2001 to 2009, and led the team into World Group II in 2007. She was inducted into the Canadian Tennis Hall of Fame in 2011. \"We are extremely saddened and carry a heavy heart by the news of Rene's passing,\" said Hatem McDadi, vice-president, tennis development, Tennis Canada. The federation will honour Simpson Collins in Montreal in February during the Fed Cup by BNP Paribas World Group II first round tie between Canada and Serbia. Carlos Moya was announced as the new captain of the Spanish Davis Cup by BNP Paribas team in the autumn, replacing Alex Corretja. His debut tie in charge will be Spain's first round away clash with Germany in February. Moya, who won Roland Garros in 1998 and held the No. 1 ranking in 1999, considers helping Spain capture the 2004 Davis Cup title to be one of the high points of his career. He won two singles rubbers, including the deciding match against Andy Roddick, to defeat USA 3-2 in Seville. The 37-year-old was also involved in Spain's 2003 Davis Cup Final loss to Australia in Melbourne. Fellow Mallorcan and long-time friend Rafael Nadal said, \"I think as a player he is one of the best we have had in the history of our country. He deserves to be Davis Cup captain.\" In Chile, Nicolas Massu has been chosen to captain the Davis Cup team and will work alongside fellow national hero Marcelo Rios, who will take on the role of technical coach. Massu, a double Olympic champion in Athens in 2004, competed in 56 Davis Cup rubbers, finishing with 32-24 record, and helped his country reach the World Group quarterfinals in 2006 and 2010. Former world No. 1 Rios, who was Australian Open runner-up in 1998, was a renowned Davis Cup player with 28 wins from 45 rubbers. Chile was relegated to Americas Zone Group II in September, and has not competed at as low a level in the competition since 1991. The team will travel to Barbados for the first round in January. \"The important thing is to get out of our group as quickly as possible, get back to Group I where the players can grow and, as Marcelo said, in the future, progress to the World Group,\" said Massu.

A former professional player born in Hopman Cup's host city Perth, Kilderry is the first West Australian to run the event, having served as the Deputy Event Director in 2013. \"This new role is a dream come true,\" Kilderry, 40, said. \"I know the players love coming here and we have a great team that is incredibly committed to ensuring both they and the fans love the event, Perth and indeed Western Australia.\" 30 ITFWORLD WINTER 2013 Carlos Moya with a young Rafael Nadal at the 2004 Davis Cup by BNP Paribas Final"
