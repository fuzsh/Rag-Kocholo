        "text": "Last year started out as the worst in a series of annus horribilis for Canadian-born and raised Greg Rusedski.\n\nIn Sydney before the Australian Open, under the pressure of rampant rumours that he had tested positive for a banned substance, the Briton went public with an admission that they were true. The illegal substance was the steroid nandrolone.\n\nA month later, he returned to his old hometown of Montreal for a tribunal hearing and then had to endure a six-week wait before learning in March that he had been exonerated.\n\nAt age 30, and after left-foot surgery in 2002 and a left-knee operation in 2003, any suspension for the positive test would likely have ended his career.\n\nThe drug-allegations ordeal did not help his tennis. He did not win a match from January until June and, by the end of Wimbledon, a ranking that reached No. 4 after his runner-up finish at the 1997 U.S. Open had plunged to No. 168.\n\nBut, at that nadir, he won the ATP grass-court event in Newport, R.I., a title he also captured as a Canadian in 1993 one of the two of his 14 career victories he won representing the Maple Leaf. That triggered a comeback to No. 48.\n\n\"Having gone through what I did last year and the year before with injuries,\" he said yesterday, \"you're either going to get weaker and disappear and fall off the planet, which I could have done when I was 168 in the world. But I decided I was going to fight back and got to the top 50, which I think is one of my best accomplishments as a professional tennis player.\" After a 2-6, 6-4, 6-0, 7-6 victory over Jonas Bjorkman in the first round of the Australian Open, he will face world No. 2 Andy Roddick tomorrow.\n\nThe two exchanged Wimbledon victories, Rusedski winning in three sets in 2002 and Roddick returning the favour a year later with the American leading their overall head-to-head 3-1.\n\nThey have also exchanged the tour serving-speed record. Rusedski set the mark at 149 miles an hour in 1998 and Roddick equalled it at Queens Club in 2003, extending it to 155 miles an hour last year.\n\n\"I'm excited, Thursday's match will be another step forward to see where I am,\" Rusedski, 31, said.\n\nHis goal is to get back into the top 20, maybe the top 10.\n\nHe is on that quest without a coach, hoping to change that before the French Open and Wimbledon. Eyeing more of a consulting-coach arrangement, he said, \"I'd like to have someone to bounce ideas off and just to help me prepare even better for the majors.\"\n\nAlong with finding coaching, Rusedski faces another major decision brought about by his compatriot Tim Henman's announcement last week that he is retiring from Davis Cup play.\n\nWithout the No. 7-ranked Henman, Britain's chances playing away against Israel in early March are probably cut in half. Without Rusedski, as well, they would be close to zero because of the weakness of other team members.\n\nIt would be easy for Rusedski to follow Henman's lead and, just before Masters Series events in Indian Wells, Calif., and Miami, take a pass and concentrate on training.\n\nOn the other hand, it is a terrific opening for the Canadian-bred Brit to play the patriot and gain some ground in a long-standing, losing public-relations battle with the Oxford born and bred Henman.\n\nLooking further down the line, Rusedski is a rare real-tennis fanatic among the players. He's aware of all the records and facts of the most obscure of players.\n\nIt is an open secrethe would eventually like to do television commentary work and being a Davis Cup loyalist would boost his image.\n\nFor those Canadians who don't forgive Rusedski for turning his back on his native land in 1995, one thing can be said in his favour. That future announcer's voice will be the one of the boy raised as an Anglophone in Pointe-Claire, Que. He still speaks English with a this-side-of-the-Atlantic accent as authentic as those belonging to the likes of golf's Mike Weir or hockey's Jarome Iginla."
