        "text": "1/11\n\nRetired tennis player Andy Roddick and his model/actress wife Brooklyn Decker finally unloaded their North Carolina lake house in late December. Originally listed in June 2016 for $2.99 million, the luxurious home was last seen asking $2.47 million and sold for a slightly less $2.35 million.The couple custom-built the four-bedroom, five-bath abode in 2013 after purchasing the 2.76-acre land lot in 2012. The project was a labor of love for the talented duo, who had never built a house from the ground up before, but decided they needed more space after the birth of their son in 2015. After recently giving birth to a daughter, that point is now doubly true for the growing family.New owners will enjoy the rustic yet modern style of the house, which overlooks Silver Springs Lake. Thoughtfully selected finishes shine throughout the home, including timber accents, stone fireplaces, reclaimed wood on ceilings, and gold lighting fixtures. Quirky details like suspended beds in the guest bedroom show the celebrity couple’s style.Shortly after listing their lakefront property, Decker and Roddick told Forbes that they are building a larger home three miles away. The Grace and Frankie star grew up in North Carolina, which might be why the pair is especially fond of the area.Women’s Wear Daily first reported the story and Liz Harris of McKee Properties had the Cashiers, NC listing."
