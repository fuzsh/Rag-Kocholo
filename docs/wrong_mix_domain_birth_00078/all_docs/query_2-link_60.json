        "text": "Between demanding careers and caring for two children under 4, Brooklyn Decker and husband Andy Roddick have their hands full.\n\nWhen we spoke with the 32-year-old Grace and Frankie star about her hit Netflix show earlier this year, she candidly admitted that when you’re a parent to two young children and you’re pulled in a million different directions, you can’t execute everything perfectly. “I don’t know that there’s a lot of space for romance, as unromantic as that sounds,” she said.\n\nUnromantic it may be, but it’s also honest. When she’s not acting, Decker also launched a shopping app, Finery, and invests in other companies. Roddick is a tennis star who’s putting his talent to use running the Andy Roddick Foundation, which provides sports-based mentoring to kids in need. The two have been married since 2009, and now, with a 4-year-old son, Hank, and a 2-year-old daughter, Stevie, the couple has realized their priorities had to shift a bit.\n\n“I’m kind of OK with that, simply because we have to be OK with the uncomfortable stages and phases of life,” she explained. “We have two kids under 4, they’re not in school yet. My job is still all over the place. We live on the East Coast and Texas and work in California, and my husband travels a lot for work, so it’s just sort of chaotic, and that’s OK with me.”\n\nThe model-turned-entrepreneur added, “I think there’s space for chaos, and that’s what we’re in. The second you think that’s wrong is when you get into trouble. So, we’re kind of leaning into the chaos of having young babies and laughing a lot along the way—which might be the secret.”\n\nThat doesn’t mean the couple ignores or neglects their relationship by any means. They’re just taking things one day at a time, knowing that at this stage, their kids come first. And that realization has strengthened their connection: “We definitely take time with each other, and our bond has deepened because of parenting and seeing our children grow up,” she said. “There’s such an intimacy to that.”\n\nIn times like these, we could all take a moment to laugh with the ones we love and not get stuck in ideas about what “perfect” parenting or relationships look like."
