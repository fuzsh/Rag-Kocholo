        "text": "Andy Roddick has finally won Wimbledon, a title that eluded him during his 12-year tennis career.\n\nAhead of the start of the grand slam tournament on July 1, Betway released an advert that shows Roddick becoming the Wimbledon (North Dakota) champion.\n\nThe three-minute video shows the former US Open champion travel to Wimbledon, North Dakota, a town with a population of 144 people, and easily beat seven of its residents to finally win a “Wimbledon” trophy.\n\nUnlike the perfectly manicured grass courts at the All England Tennis Club, Roddick has to mow a tennis court into a farmer’s field and recruit members of the town to play against him.\n\nChad Yeomans, Betway spokesperson, said: “Despite a decorated career in tennis, Andy never quite got his hands on the Wimbledon trophy, even though he reached the final three times.\n\n“That’s why we contacted the incredible town of Wimbledon, North Dakota to design a tournament that could possibly help Andy achieve tennis glory. We are really thankful to Andy and all involved in bringing this fun idea to fruition”\n\nRoddick won 32 titles in his career, including the US Open in 2003. He reached the Wimbledon final in 2004, 2005 and 2009 however was beaten in all three finals by Roger Federer.\n\nIn the advert, there is a nod to his adversary as a resident asks Roddick if he has seen his dog Roger who he has lost.\n\nRoddick, Betway Global Tennis Ambassador, said: “Wimbledon has always been a special tournament to me and one I’ve dreamed of winning. I am absolutely honoured to be able to finally call myself a Wimbledon (North Dakota) Champion… And to the people of Wimbledon who helped make it happen, this one is for you.”\n\nAs Betway’s tennis ambassador, Roddick also provided his tips for the third grand slam of the year. He says that defending champion Carlos Alcaraz is a favourite for the men’s tournament alongside Jannik Sinner."
