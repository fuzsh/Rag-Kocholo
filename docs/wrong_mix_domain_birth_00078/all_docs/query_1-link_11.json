        "text": "Andy Roddick was just 17 when he was inspired to make a difference.\n\nIn 2000, he founded the Andy Roddick Foundation.\n\nThen? ARF raised millions to improve the lives of children and families.\n\nNow? ARF keeps kids learning so they can succeed — all during months and times of day when statistics show they’re typically most at risk and falling behind.\n\nAndy Roddick was nine years old when he realized what he was born to do. These days, he’s devoted his life to recreating that moment, over and over again ­­— but not for himself. It turns out that one of the greatest tennis players of all time was born not just to pursue his own passion, but to help others discover theirs."
