        "text": "Tim Clayton/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nFormer tennis pro Andy Roddick is one of the most memorable players of his generation, but his legendary career left him with an unfortunate consequence.\n\nDuring a recent episode of his Served podcast, Roddick opened up about his battles with skin cancer, which he said he's suffered from since he retired from tennis in 2012.\n\n\"I've dealt with various types of skin cancer since I stopped playing, had a squamous cell tumor taken out of my lip, probably like five or six years ago, I haven't ever talked about it,\" Roddick revealed. \"This morning we went into this face laser thing that's why for those of you watching on YouTube it looks like I got in a fight.\"\n\nThe 41-year-old won the 2003 US Open and reached four other major finals in his career. He reached world No. 1 status in 2003 and earned an induction into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nRoddick, who is a father of two, went on to urge people to use sunscreen, especially on their children.\n\n\"It stinks. I think I'm going to be a general kind of hatchet job for the rest of my life. [I] won't go into the 'woe was me' part of it, because nothing is wrong, everything is good but, use sunscreen,\" he said. \"Put sunscreen on your kids, especially if they are tennis players. The problem won't present itself when the kid is eight, but it might present itself when that kid is grown and is 38.\""
