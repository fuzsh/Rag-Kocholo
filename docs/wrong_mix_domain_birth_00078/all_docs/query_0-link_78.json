        "text": "HOUSTON -- Andy Roddick was confirmed as the end-of-season world number one after fellow American Andre Agassi produced a spectacular comeback to beat Spain's Juan Carlos Ferrero 2-6 6-3 6-4 at the ATP Masters Cup.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Wimbledon champion Roger Federer beat Argentina's David Nalbandian 6-3 6-0 to lead the Blue Group and clinch his place in the semifinals.\n\nNalbandian and Agassi, who are both at 1-1, meet on Friday with the winner joining Federer in the last four.\n\nAgassi looked down and out in the first set against Ferrero but, after smashing his racket in frustration early in the second, the 33-year-old veteran turned the match around to end the French Open champion's hopes of advancing at the elite end-of-year event.\n\nU.S. Open champion Roddick, who plays Rainer Schuettler in the Red Group on Thursday, wasn't at courtside to thank Agassi, but quickly issued a statement after becoming the second youngest player to finish the year on top of the rankings.\n\n\"I'm incredibly honored to finish the year as number one but I'm probably more proud to be the sixth American,\" the 21-year-old said.\n\n\"It's hard to reflect on what a year this has been but I'm incredibly fortunate to be playing at home in the United States.\"\n\n\"Andy had number one in his hands the whole week,\" said Agassi, who has only finished the season as world number one once, despite winning eight Grand Slam titles.\n\n\"But, you know, glad to help ... I aim to please. For him to dominate the hardcourt season the way he did is incredible. I did that in 1995 and it just took a lot out of me.\n\n\"He's proven himself to be number one over the greatest players in the world. So he has a lot to feel proud about.\"\n\nSwiss third seed Federer, who beat Agassi in his opening match, stormed past Nalbandian for his first-ever career win over the Argentine in six attempts.\n\n\"To beat him now for the first time, it's just good to get it off my back,\" said the third seed.\n\n\"It's just easier to live like this now. I've been always hoping to beat him. Today is my first time and I'm happy about it.\n\n\"He was struggling but for me that doesn't really matter. I believe I am in a very good position now.\"\n\nâ€¢ American twins Mike and Bob Bryan became the first brothers to clinch the end-of-year top doubles ranking when Max Mirnyi of Belarus and Mahesh Bhupathi of Inda were beaten by Canada's Daniel Nestor and Mark Knowles of the Bahamas at the Masters Cup.\n\nThe Bryans face Argentine duo Gaston Etlis and Martin Rodriguez in the semifinals on Friday.\n\nClick Here to try 4 Free Trial Issues of Time!"
