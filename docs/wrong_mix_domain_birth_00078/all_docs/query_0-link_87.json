In the 3rd round, Novak faced Nalbandian for the 1st time and won the match by 6-2 6-3. From the following round, history started.\n\nAndy Roddick, world no.3 at that time was the 1st of top 3 players who Djokovic will defeat in Montreal. It was their 1st meeting and Djokovic even in the early stages of his career showed how great returner he is. 7-6 6-4 win for Novak. It was a spicy rivalry in the following years...\n\nIn the semifinal, Nadal and Djokovic played their 7th match. Rafa led 5-1 in h2h. Aggressive from the beginning and playing his best tennis in the most important moments (at 5-5 in the 1st set when Novak saved 2 break points) the Serb got his 2nd win against his biggest rival. Final score of the match was 7-5 6-3.\n\nRoger Federer and Novak Djokovic played for the 5th time. It was their 1st of many big finals that they have played against each other. Key of the match was the 1st set when Federer served at 6-5 for the set and had 40-15. Just like in most of their matches, Djokovic was the one who would win key points of the match. The match was decided in a tie break in the 3rd set when Novak lost only 2 points. 1st win over Federer, 2nd Masters 1000 title and 1st of many historical achievements from Djokovic.\n\n--\n\nFollow @bloggeroftennis for more tennis content!\n\n--\n\n#tennis #bloggeroftennis #sport #ATP #ATPWorldTour #Djokovic #NovakDjokovic #NoleFam #Serbia #Serbian #Montreal #Canada #Federer #Nadal #Roddick #tennisplayer #tenniscourt #tennislove #tennisfan #tennismatch #tennislife #tennisworld #tennisfun #tennistime\".",
