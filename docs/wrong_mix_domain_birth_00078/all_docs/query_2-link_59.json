        "text": "American tennis player Andy Roddick jokes that he opened his first start-up when he was 7. It was then the tennis grind started for the Nebraska-born 36-year-old, putting in hours every day to become one of the top juniors in the game on his way to a Hall-of-Fame career that includes a 2003 U.S. Open title and over $20 million in on-court prize money.\n\nWhile Roddick, who now lives in Austin with his wife, Brooklyn Decker, and their two children, took a different tact toward entrepreneurism by starting with tennis, has fully embraced the business world, turning both his on-court financial success into a robust business offering, but also leveraging a world he learned as he went into a second career that largely weaves out of the tennis lane.\n\n“The outside tennis business was something I learned as I went,” he says. “I was always pretty interested in how I could leverage deals, but as time went on I cared less and less about that side of it and more about the business. I focused on the business of my actual sport and took it outside my sport.”\n\nFor Roddick, his entry into business outside tennis started when he was around 21, already near the top of his sport. The big-serving star had his big shoe and clothing deal locked in and with his early success, endorsement deals were three, four and five years in length. “It is, ‘what’s next, how do we make money work for me?’” he says about his thinking at the time. “I became obsessed with the idea of working while I was playing to replace my (tennis) income. When I retired the income from playing was replaced by whatever I was doing afterwards.”\n\nIt was then that Roddick and business partner Phil Myers created the foundation for Roddick’s post-athletics stronghold: real estate. The duo created a triple-net lease real estate business, based on strict formulas and numbers. They were at the right place in the right time, taking advantage of the 2008 recession to “press forward and acquire our first bunch of buildings.” With such a rigid, long-term view, Roddick was able to stay disciplined and turn investing into numbers on a sheet.\n\n“Most professional athletes are expected to reap their paydays during their playing years,” Myers says. “The athlete that reacts to this early earning cycle needs to have a long-term view on business investment if he or she wants tomorrow to be better than today.” Myers says Andy recognized early in his career the principles of diversification, compound earning and not living extravagantly, leading to Roddick mixing his assets into 40 percent triple-net long-term leased commercial real estate, 25 percent listed equities, 15 percent in venture efforts, 10 percent professionally managed hedge funds and 10 percent in guaranteed tax-deferred investments.\n\n“It is not a business that is going to go 10x in one year,” Roddick says about the real estate. “We have acquired a sizable number of assets and have predicable cash flow, what we live off. When you make a hard push at age 23 or 24, it is slow at first. Then 10 years later properties have obtained value on their own and contracts create a head of steam.” The philosophy, so vastly different than the hope of investing in a company that gets acquired within three years, was key for the young player. Starting in real estate helped keep Roddick grounded early and not divert money to subsidize personal spending. “I know that Andy recognized that the $300,000 that he could have spent on a new Ferrari would lessen his net worth by over $1.4 million when he reached 55 and $3 million by 65,” Myers says. “Andy knew that he would rather have the $3 million available to give to his family, community and charities.”\n\nWith the real estate side of the business so formulaic and Roddick retiring from the game in 2012, he continued to leverage his business learning into new deals, startup spaces, series Cs and more. “The fun part for me is looking at the deals and new companies,” he says. “Investing in companies is more exciting day to day.”\n\nRoddick has built his portfolio to 17 current companies he’s invested in — others have been acquired since his initial investments — but isn’t worried about hitting a certain number. “If it was investing in just one of these companies, it would be extremely risky,” he says. “You have to invest in what is going on, retail to infrastructure. It is a little bit of the opposite of real estate, which is extremely disciplined with a formula we stick to and everything understandable on a piece of paper. Investing in companies, I want to sit down in the room and completely believe in the person I am hearing a pitch from.”\n\nSometimes Roddick hears about a new deal through his personal network and other times it comes from living in Austin for the past 15 years. “It certainly has been a beneficial place to have lived over the last 15 years with capital,” he says. “Austin is small enough you normally hear about things in your business network and get a look. Rarely is there a surprise. It is small enough you are one phone call away from getting an answer or talking directly with someone versus just scheduling a meeting.”\n\nAs Roddick vets new ideas, he leans heavily on Decker and Myers, with 80 percent of his deals including all three of them. Of course, his competitive side kicks in and sometimes takes on a deal they don’t want in on, always hoping to show them he was right in the end. That said, the real estate foundation allows him to remain choosy. “Real estate has provided that we can be patient,” he says. “With this I love to be a part of it.”\n\nMoving out of tennis proved to be a powerful choice for Roddick. “When I retired, it was interesting,” he says. “It was a pay to show up situation, it wasn’t long term. Everything I was getting was a seven-foot ceiling and I’m 6-2. There has to be a way to leverage it.” That’s when Roddick realized his capital was that way. Instead of resigning with Lacoste or Reebok upon retirement, he put his own capital into apparel company Travis Matthew and had a “pretty healthy exit” later on. He’s moved far enough from tennis in his business life that he’s not currently involved in any tennis companies.\n\nStill, the Roddick name has plenty of cache, so if lending his likeness and time — whether shooting commercials or making appearances — for the likes of Travis Matthew or his latest venture, Tiff’s Treats, he’s happy to make that happen.\n\nUsing his business sense, Roddick has put his money to good use in the Austin area with the Andy Roddick Foundation, which runs after-school programs for students. Roddick says the success and growth of the foundation comes from his willingness to be the dumbest person in the room and filling his board with strong business minds. “Our board meetings are like a free education for me,” he says. “I’m happily the dumbest person in the room all the time.”\n\nMyers says Roddick has a unique ability to synthesis the key talking points in any conversation and isn’t afraid to ask questions, allowing him the opportunity to grow his knowledge base at all times.\n\nThe high-level meetings really push discussions about expansion and growth into lessons covering strategy and applying best practice in business to lower the cost per child in the foundation without sacrificing quality. Roddick early on chose a direct-service model for his foundation instead of sprinkling money around in order to take a long view — the same view he took early on in his business ventures. The foundation first opened its doors to 80 kids in 2014. “It worked and we gained trust in the community,” he says. “This summer we served over 3,000 kids.” The foundation has grown, remaining focused and positioning quality as its north star. The participant retention rate has built trust from donors. “It was extremely strategic,” he says. “It was not about raising this amount of money, it was about those 80 kids and producing results.”\n\nThe program, which puts a focus on STEM, financial literacy, tech literacy and things Roddick feels are important to 12-year-olds isn’t about pushing his agenda — sure, they incorporate tennis into the physical education component, but that is the only bit of tennis you’ll see — but giving them the opportunity to thrive.\n\nComing from the self-centric world of tennis where Roddick was in charge of creating his own team, hiring his own coach, traveling the world individually and playing by himself, the move into the foundation has really helped him understand life in the business world. “The ability to ask questions when you don’t know is a huge thing and have had to do that so many times,” he says. “I’ll call a board member and ask them to walk me through this. Foolish pride can get in the way a lot of times. As athletes, we are programmed to have this false bravado thing. To let that go has been a huge teaching moment. There have been a million lessons applicable to business.”\n\nFrom that 7-year-old who took on his first free endorsement product at age 9 to the high school senior who in 2000 signed a five-year deal with Reebok as the number-one junior in the world to the young 20-something who looked long-term at the real estate market, Roddick’s willingness to look to the future, show patience and think long term has allowed a man once known just for tennis to make a difference in the lives of thousands of students every year while continually building a business brand beyond tennis."
