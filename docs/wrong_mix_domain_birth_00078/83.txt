Americans Andy Roddick and John Isner scored a winning home double into the quarter-finals of the ATP Winston-Salem Open, advancing in straight sets yesterday.

Top seed and former number one Roddick – playing outside the top 20 for the first time in a decade – posted a tidy 6-1, 6-3 win over Santiago Giraldo. Isner, the number four, advanced 7-6, 6-2 against Finn Jarkko Nieminen.

Roddick is pushing hard to return to his former glory, with the 2003 US Open champion forced to withdraw with his long-running abdominal injury from Washington and Montreal this month and losing in the Cincinnati first round last week.

The American went through in 66 minutes with five aces and never faced a break point. He is now into his fourth quarter-final of the year, and first since the grass court event in Queen’s Club in London.

He will get a further test when he plays Argentine seventh seed Juan Monaco, who beat Japan’s Kei Nishikori 6-0, 6-3.

Isner, who was born in the North Carolina, sent over 10 aces in his 64-minute home victory over Nieminen to run his total so far from two matches to 27.
