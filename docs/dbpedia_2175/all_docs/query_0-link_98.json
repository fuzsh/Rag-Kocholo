So be sensible Quinner and leave the sea gulls by the sea.\n\nOriginally posted by DAMNTHEWEATHER View Post\n\nNow yiv gone inta pinch of salt routine again. Anyway, a few mins or not.....try think of the poor busted who has to live with your badly trained gulls for the rest of the year....ye never thought of that did you ? Oh no....as long as you're alright Jack.....the rest can do what ye told the lift manager fella in yer last post.....Yeah... I'm alright Jack...flock you !!!\n\nOriginally posted by quinner View Post\n\na couple of years before I retired.....a new manager came on the company I worked for....\n\na few days later he rang my mobile and told me to go to a particular job......my reply was...''fuck off''......as I disconnected the phone.....\n\nhe then went to the area manager.....\n\nhe said I am not having engineers speak to me like that......\n\nthearea manager said, who was that and what did you say....\n\nhe said, I told Quinner to go and do a job at x location......\n\nthe area manager then said......you should have asked him, he is a very obliging peson....\n\ntelling him is a waste of time.......he would even tell me to ''fuck off''.....\n\nthe moral of the story......\n\nanybody, that speaks to me like that will always get the same reply.......\n\nno matter who they are.....\n\nOriginally posted by quinner View Post\n\nyes Twobob......\n\nI worked in the construction industry for most of my life......\n\nwhen you speak to somebody that you don't know......or want something done.\n\nyou introduce yourself.........\n\nyou ask politely......\n\nyou say thank you.......\n\nby the way......that manager didn't last long.......I never actually met him, he worked in the Cardiff office..........I very seldom went over there....\n\nit was a nice company to work for......five times I worked for them.....\n\nOriginally posted by Twobob View Post\n\nI worked for a crowd up till 18 mths back ....this one [ lets just say one of our european cousins ] clicked her fingers at me with her arm raised , I just stood and stared her out of it ...she never crossed my path again....i'm f@?@?d if any one is going to raise them selves off my back .\n\nOriginally posted by quinner View Post\n\nlol.....Twobob, I have had a great working life......the job on the whole was fun......if I was fit enough I would have stayed on after I reached retiring age........\n\nalas, I had to go........I don't really miss it though.....\n\nI meet up with some of the lads now and again if they are in my area......we go and have a breakfast and a chat......\n\nI worked mainly for SCHINDLER LIFTS a Swiss company.......and then for THYSSEN KRUPP ELEVATORS a German company...."
