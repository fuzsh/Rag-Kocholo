        "text": "Reading Time: 2 minutes\n\nBirds brighten our lives with their song, ability to fly and bright beauty. And birds are our connection to nature.\n\nBut there are times when we connect just a little too much with our fine feathered friends.\n\nThat connection often results in a big white smudge left on our car if we park under the wrong tree.\n\nOr even worse, on us if we’re in their direct line of fire.\n\nI’m talking about the dreaded white smudge: bird poop.\n\nBird Poop as a Good Luck Charm\n\nThere are some that believe bird poop brings good luck.\n\nSo if our avian friends poop on you, your car or your property, you may receive good luck and riches. And the more birds involved, the more prosperous you’ll be.\n\nIf you embrace bird poop in that way, congratulations, we’ve just reaffirmed your thinking and your reading is done.\n\nIf not you’re not the superstitious type and don’t feel lucky when a bird leaves a big smudge of bird droppings on your car, then read on.\n\nA new podcast by Birdnote, a partner of the National Audubon Society, with episodes airing daily on NPR radio stations nationwide answers the question: why is most of the bird poop we see white?\n\nAccording to Birdnote, birds, unlike mammals, don’t produce urine. Instead, they excrete nitrogenous wastes in the form of uric acid, which emerges as a white paste.\n\nAnd uric acid doesn’t dissolve in water easily, so it sticks to your car or its windshield like blobs of white plaster.\n\nCar Colors Most Pooped on by Birds\n\nIf you’re looking to buy a new car, then buyer beware.\n\nBirds do have a color preference when it comes to targeting their droppings.\n\nA study in England found that red cars are the most likely target of bird poop, followed by blue and black.\n\nGreen cars were the least likely targeted by birds.\n\nSo be careful where you park. And if all else fails, consider buying a white car."
