        "text": "Zaphod\":3i32bpal said:\n\nMore recently the wife and I were vacationing near Tampa and got to liking the beach at Honeymoon Island state park. There were gulls there who would make a grab for anything in your hand as it approached your mouth. Not cool man, not cool.\n\nInteresting, my wife and I used to vacation down there in Februaries to get away from the frozen north. I don't remember seagulls ever even having much of a presence. February is osprey nesting season on Honeymoon Island, though, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if the gulls keep their distance. And the osprey don't give a damn about people food, so they don't harass you.\n\nIt's not just crows and seagulls that are intelligent\n\nCanadian geese tend to hang out near where I live. I've always been kind of fascinated by them, so one Sunday, driving home from the store, I saw a bunch of them in a field. I pulled over and got out with most of a bagel I hadn't finished.\n\nOnly one goose was anywhere near where I stepped onto the field and he (she?) was a bit skittish at first so it was cool when he stepped over and started picking up bits of bagel I'd tossed on the ground. Even cooler was when he carefully inched closer and took a bit from my hand. It's head was about waist high...and I'm pretty tall.\n\nI was thinking, 'wow, this is so cool!' until I looked up and saw the that the rest of the geese, about six or eight, had noticed and were rapidly waddling my way. Nothing like seeing a bunch of waist high birds headed your way to make you think you've probably made a very stupid mistake.\n\nTurns out I need not have worried. Apparently two of the geese were allowed to take food from me...the rest were stamped away by the two when they tried to approach. I kinda felt bad for the others...they would hang around and look at me with this sad hopeful look...so after a bit I tossed a big chunk on the ground nearby so the two alpha geese went for it, and then surreptitiously tossed some to the meeker of the group.\n\nIron Clad Burrito\":1h3dukh9 said:\n\nThere's probably a nest, and babies, and by the way... no, you can't do anything about it. I was ready to kill one once, but an EPA guy happened to be in the area, says they're protected, and it's a $5,000 fine if you're caught killing one.\"\n\nWait, seagulls are a protected species? How the fuck does that make sense? They're the trailer trash of the bird world. You couldn't stop them reproducing even if you wanted to!\n\n---\n\nmhac\":1h3dukh9 said:\n\nAlternatively, you could try this method:\n\nSamurai Sword Ninja Folding Umbrella Auto Release\n\nNot necessarily the most trouble free solution!\n\nMonaLisaOverdrive\":f4t64uo2 said:\n\nOnly one goose was anywhere near where I stepped onto the field and he (she?) was a bit skittish at first so it was cool when he stepped over and started picking up bits of bagel I'd tossed on the ground. Even cooler was when he carefully inched closer and took a bit from my hand.\n\nWait. Wait wait wait. So you fed Canadian Geese? On purpose? Till now, I'd have thought surely no Arsian would be dumb enough to do something like that.\n\nMonaLisaOverdrive, thanks for being one of the damn fools responsible for training these geese to hang out around humans, shit everything up, and worst of all, get all up in our business looking for handouts.\n\nJakal\":3cojmvkw said:\n\nMonaLisaOverdrive\":3cojmvkw said:\n\nOnly one goose was anywhere near where I stepped onto the field and he (she?) was a bit skittish at first so it was cool when he stepped over and started picking up bits of bagel I'd tossed on the ground.

Amazingly soft, warm feathers on their backs.\n\nJakal\":1jny68bn said:\n\nMonaLisaOverdrive\":1jny68bn said:\n\nOnly one goose was anywhere near where I stepped onto the field and he (she?) was a bit skittish at first so it was cool when he stepped over and started picking up bits of bagel I'd tossed on the ground.
