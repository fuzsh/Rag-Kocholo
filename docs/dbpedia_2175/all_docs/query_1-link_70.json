        "text": "Enter Preston & Steve’s Seagull Screech-Off Contest happening Friday morning, May 24th at Keenan’s Irish Pub in North Wildwood.\n\nPicture this: it’s a warm day on the beach. Clear skies. Ocean crashing in the distance. Chatter of fellow beach goers all around. The loud call of one seagull to another calling dips on snacks they spot from the sky. This is the Jersey Shore.\n\nLove ’em or hate ’em, seagulls are iconic to the landscape of our summers. And apparently there are humans who do a damn good impression!\n\nEverything you need to know about Preston & Steve’s Keenan’s Broadcast\n\nDuring Preston & Steve’s broadcast last year, we met six of these people. We believe that there are more. If you are one of these people and you will be at Keenan’s in North Wildwood on Friday, May 24, 2024 by 7AM, then submit a video below.\n\nYou could end up on stage with The Preston & Steve Show competing for prizes! (video from last year posted below for inspiration). To apply, you can upload a video or share a link from Instagram, X(Twitter) or YouTube.\n\nWatch the 2023 Seagull Screech-Off:\n\nJoin Preston & Steve on May 24:\n\nSo many things to celebrate on Friday, May 24th! First off, it’s the official kickoff to summer. Secondly, Keenan’s Irish Pub in North Wildwood is celebrating their 25th anniversary. That gang knows how to party! Which means that this is one you won’t want to miss. [info]\n\nMarisa Magnatta, Producer at The Preston & Steve Show, has clocked-in two decades at 93.3 WMMR, Philly. She’s your source for everything Philly, concert, sports fan, restaurant or Preston & Steve Show related."
