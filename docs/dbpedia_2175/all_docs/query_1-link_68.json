Minutes later a flock of seagulls swarmed and attacked me and my sandwich.

The birds took to the skies and chased after us, covering us in shit.

A kid walking by threw a cracker near me and I was instantly attacked by a group of seagulls.

I sat on the sand, breathed in deeply and closed my eyes, trying to find some sort of inner peace. Then a seagull shat on me.

Someone thought it would be funny to put chunks of bread on and around my junk. Seagulls have sharp beaks.

I ripped it open in the car and realized it was a bag of birdseed. As I spat out the birdseed through the car's open window and tried to clean the mess, a pigeon flew into my car and attacked me.

I had to shamefully start walking back to work with a pair of girls laughing at me and an empty stomach. FML\n\nI agree, your life sucks 23 296\n\nYou deserved it 1 854\n\nShare"
