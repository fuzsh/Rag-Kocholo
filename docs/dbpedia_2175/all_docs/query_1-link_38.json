        "text": "I disagree with FC entirely. I have lived near the sea my entire life (in various places/countries) and I have never seen anything as noisy, messy or brash as the seagulls in Brighton. Every bin day theres crap on loads of streets (not just Tidy Street) and thier noise is plainly increadible, I think if the council did want to help the first step would be to be prompt in picking up the rubbish, but in reality the damage is done way before the binmen arrive (even if they are on time). I really dont see a solution to this problem except a cull really as there are clearly far too many of them inland because of the treats of our rubbish and the protection they get from people like FC.\n\nLucklily enough im moving to Barcelona in a month so it wont be a problem (im not moving because of the seagulls but its certainly a bonus).\n\nAnd FC, yes, I know they have seagulls there to but I can tell you they dont make half the noise or do half the damage that these ones do!\n\nIan\n\ni live in the centre of edinburgh and this problem is so frustrating with no help at all from council. i am so shattered with getting woken up at 3.30am every morning with the high pitched screeching from theses bird's as i type this at 1.50pm they are still screeching and have been all day... im dreading when the festival starts as the bird's will be going mad at 11.00pm every night because of the firework's after the tattoo finishe's evey night, it's ok for people on this page to say stop moaning easier said than done when you have to live with it, 7 years ago i stayed cloeser to the sea than i do now and never heard nothing like what im listening to here in the centre of town, something should be done about this but because they're protected nothing can be done or so the council told me, but i bet them in the council get a good night's sleep. and to be honest there isn't really any rubbish lying about in the street's as we have those big bucket's every where now so why do they keep coming into the centre of town,and if one more person tell's me the reason why they screech is because they're looking for water i don't believe that, it can pour with rain here in edinburgh for day's and they still screech\n\nfor the two who like to jib me about my grammar, if only you knew the facts im a 39yr old female who is 80% blind and can hardly see the keyboard let alone the screen so let me appologise for my grammer, but if thats all you can do is pick on someone with a disability then you have a sadder life than me. also i thought this forum was about seagulls and not grammer, so feel free to keep having a dig at me and my grammer. i maybe dont have sight but i have a heart which is more than can be said for you two sad lonely people. my three year old son has more common decency than you do, but as i said feel free to say what you like ater all it is a free world, but i'd appreciate how you slag me of as i sometimes have to get my son to help me find the keys and read something's out to me so basically youre upsetting him also (hope youre proud)\n\nUpdate on my post of August 2010 from Longstone, Edinburgh....\n\nThe 2011 \"Flying Rat\" problem didn't seem quite as bad as the year before. However, 2012 and the “mutants” are back and just as bad as 2010.\n\nI just called Pest Control @Edinburgh Council. I asked if the Council would put spikes on the roofs of the three tenaments where the majority of them sit. These buildings are occupied by a mix of private and Council tenants so right away the Council have an excuse not to get involved. Unsurprisingly, he said there was nothing they could do and suggested I got in touch with the RSPB. I told him I had already contacted them 2 years ago (after my last post) when my wife was attacked outside our house by a “flying rat” protecting one of its young, which was in a garden nearby. The RSPB could do nothing about it either and offered no advice other than just keep out of their way.\n\nSo, where do we go from here?…\n\nOptions now being considered after weeks of sleep depravation.\n\n1. During the night, point an industrial strength laser pen at them (taking care to avoid their eyes and any aircraft that might be around).\n\n2. Provide a daily buffet on the roof of my garage, consisting of sodium bicarbonate sandwiches & Smirnoff Trifle. 3. Hire a “Hit Man” with an air rifle to pick them off.\n\nOn a more serious note, this colony resides 4 miles from the sea. They are NOT sea birds, they are mutations of our creation. The fact is, we provide the environment for them to exist by allowing food to be left in the street. Its about time the Authorities admitted this and dealt with it before it gets worse.\n\nRant over…….\n\nI have undertaken research on Herring (and similar) gulls and have now read hundreds of reports locally and globally including scientific studies from orthnithologits, evironmental experts and bio-diversity specialists. I live in Peacehaven. I conclude the following: The Herring Gull population is exploding in all countries where they naturally occur. They are multiplying rapidly in both urban and coastal areas with urban migration being a relatively recent trend occuring over the last 25 years or so in the UK. The information held by DEFRA and the RSPB is now out of date as it relies upon a Survey known as Seabird with statistics based on numbers in 2000/02. No up to date surveys of gulls exists in this country. DEFRA have placed the herring gull on the \"red list\" as being endangered in the belief that the Herring Gull is in decline. My research shows the opposite is true. Research in the US, Meditteranean region, Baltic Region, and the South Atlantic off Argentina shows that gulls are now a threat to other species and are placing many species (and flora), such as terns and puffins and smaller gulls in the endangered list. Recent reports in the news show how gulls are attacking Whales and pecking at their flesh as they breach for air. The Herring Gull (and similar) has no natural predators and large numbers will gang up on hawks and even eagles and run them off. I have examined reports from local government from around the country (e.g. Bristol, Cardiff, Gloucester, Worcester, Birmingham, London, Carlilet, Tiverton, Brighton, Cheltenham, Gwynedd, Scarborough, North London) and all report significant growth in the number of herring gulls. The Southwest Regional Health Authority have recently issued a warning that the population explosion in gulls is now a threat to public health. Symtoms caused by gull overpopulation and increasing aggressiveness include, depression, anxiety, physical injury and threat of e.coli infections (http://www.swpho.nhs.uk/ resource/ item.aspx?RID=24280 ). Beaches in Chicago have been closed due to e.coli resulting from masses of gulls coating the sand with excrement. There are dozens of recent reports in the national press featuring attacks against humans that would amount to GBH had they been perpetrated by a human being. As the gulls grow in number they seem to be growing in aggression as competition for space increases. Thus, the herring gull is growing into an epidemic both here and abroad, is threating health and safety, is a threat to other wildlife and DEFRA are doing nothing about it. Locals to Brighton will have read in the ress how some are taking the law into their own hands and shooting the gulls. Local wildlife sanctuaries are taking lost seagull chicks in and feeding them ready to let them loose and your neighbors are feeding them. All of this needs to stop as it is making a bad situation worse. DEFRA needfs to remove the protection order, make feeding gulls an ASBO offense, issue local goverment with tear-proof rubbish bags and begin culling/mass egg oiling before they wipe out other bird life, especially the puffins and terns who are being more than decimated on a few offsore Islands on our coast. DEFRA need to work with the US equivalentg as they are much further along in their research and understanding of how big a threat the Herring (and similar) gull is to or bio-diversity given the lack of natural pedators and their abilithy to dominate other species so easily by sheer weight of numbers. I would advise any who read this to Google away and writge to your MP urging him/her to put pressure on DEFRA to act.\n\nWe live up in tyne and wear in a place called hebburn. Its a housing estate 8 miles from the sea and they are becoming a real pest around and on our houses, breaking aerials and dirting all over. I think the council should do something about this but also at the same time people should stop throwing food out if they have put to much on their plates. they are starting to wake us up in the area at about 5am. we do go to work and have full time jobs so it becomes a bit to much for us. FC you sound like you know the answer to everything about it not affecting you. You probs don't even work or maybe don't want to work so why should it bother you. You must walk around with poo on your tops. We don't as we are having to rewash all the time as putting our clothes on the washing lines is a no go. Get in the real life FC\n\nI don`t live in Brighton but would just like to confirm the comments people are making about noisy gulls nesting in cities. I live in Drammen, Norway`s 7th largest city, and I have lived here all my life. From 1974 to about 2007-08 I can barely remember hearing a single seagull at any time in the city. It isn`t really on the coast either, but lies at the bottom of a deep fjord, so apart from landfills you wouldn`t really expect gulls around here. But for the last six or seven summer more and more gulls have started nesting on the rooftops around town, carrying on with their ungodly racket at all conceivable hours of the day and night. I would estimate a population downtown of about 500 individuals, usually sitting in pairs on chimneys screaming their long, drawn out wails before going silent for about 20 seconds and then doing it all over again. And again, and again until a person is driven to nervous breakdown. Apparently they live on a diet of trash, vomit from drunk people at the weekends, kebab remains and newspapers (true, I saw one eat newspapers once). So the unfortunate guinea pigs of our local government`s Seagull breeding experiment (me and everybody else living in this city) have taken to calling them Kebabgulls, to go with our classic Kebabpigeons.\n\nHttp://www.treider.no/media/42897/istock_000017889105small.jpg\n\nCozy looking isn`t it? Well it`s not, since from March till October there are gulls. Hundreds and hundreds of nesting gulls.\n\nAnyway, I can comfort the people of Brighton by letting you know that like your council our local commune (True, they really call them that in Norway. Some people have no shame) has also distinguished itself by doing absolutely nothing about the problem for all these years. This again leads to a worsening situation as the gulls become more confident that there really is no danger in nesting on human populations, and so more and more of them do. I agree with the statements that these urban Kebabgulls are somehow now mutating into a hostile and ornery species totally out of its natural habitat and by any sensible definition of the word a pest and health hazard. The problem isn`t the gulls really, it`s where they think it`s OK to nest. Non nesting gulls aren`t as noisy, which is what I`ve learned from our ongoing infestation.Traditionally they have been nesting on cliffs and what have you, and if some less insane gulls are still doing that then I see no reason why local representatives (That`s right. They work for us, presumptively.) can`t hire a couple of knuckledraggers to walk around town with an air gun each until the place is quiet again. It would take a day or two and the problem would be gone. After that we can discuss Kebabgull ethics with people like FC until the cows come home. At least we have chance to be rested when we listen to the drivel. And let`s just for a second pretend that these wildly breeding things are somehow \"endangered\" when you can hardly set foot outside without being dive bombed by one. Let`s gather themk all up and shuip them back to more natural settings away from human population centers. Or we can build artificial bird walls on the properties of gull rights activists so all the gulls can nest there. And we can help them keep the gulls happy by shipping all our kebab remains and vomit there as well, so they`ll be good and stocked and can keep their gulls through the winter. I think this would be fixed in a hurry if the people pretending to make decisions actually had to live with this crap themselves, so let`s make that our goal and call it \"conservation\" to disarm them:) Have a good summer, from Earplug City Norway.\n\nI have been in the Bird Pest Control industry for 25 years and live in Sussex. I've heard it all...I've seen it all...I've been attacked...i've saved young chicks..I've taken injured gulls to a vet..and I've rescused for re-homing adolescent gulls that fallen off roofs. SO...what do we do? there are many deterrents on the market that we install. But what do they achieve? The gulls are now NOT on your roof, but move to the neighbour's roof the following year. Mr Cameron has said that £1m will be available to carry out a survey on the urban Gull issues !! Oh yes? This has all come to light because of the dog that was killed in Cornwall. I would suggest that a gull chick had taken it's first flight and landed in a garden, maybe taking cover. the dog went to investigate ans was attacked by the parents. Any human would want to protect their baby, but not necessarily carry out murder !! A cull is being suggested. The only methods available would be shooting, poisoning, breaking eggs or oiling eggs. Shooting = firearms/police etc. poisoning = who wants a dying gull landing in their garden?. breaking eggs = you have to do this on a regular basis as the gulls will just lay again! oiling eggs = will keep the gulls quieter, but the eggs won't hatch. Oiling would perhaps seem the best answer to control numbers....but it's going to take a VERY long time! Bird Control Sussex provide a free survey of your property, depending on distance and give a quote for suggested works. John\n\n@FC Like the other people posting your baseless opinions as fact here you obviously have no understanding of what we`re talking about: 48 hour bouts of deafening screams, having to sleep with the windows shut through summer because of the constant noise from April to October. It is a health hazard and above all these are not normal seagulls: They are nesting, ie they think the city is a seagull colony. There is a good reason why coastal villages have traditionally not been placed right next to seagull colonies because you can`t sleep at night in them if you do. These are incompatible species. If I was to suggest to you that I come to your home and start raising hippos there would you be OK with that? I mean it`s wildlife right? And unlike gulls they actually are endangered. No? Then you`re a hypocrite. Cities are for humans, not nesting seabirds. like I said above, if you love seagulls so much we can ship them all to where you live. And we can ship our vomit, kebab and trash there too so you`ll have plenty of feed for them. Don`t insist on doing this pathetic pest conservation in other people`s homes. Ruin your own life if you want and leave the rest of us alone.\n\n@Mr Butler. Poison is the appropriate response to pest problems. All this dilly dallying with fake eggs etc doesn`t work. It`s what the incompetents in my local \"authorities\" have been doing for the last decade and the infestation gets worse and worse every year. The problem is that because of airheads like FC the gulls are being left alone in human population centers when they should be killed off as soon as the first one tries to nest there. The result of that is that they have learned that it is safe to nest there when it shouldn`t be.\n\nSo since there is such apathy and incompetence on the issue here vigilante activities are taking place instead. Local business owners are distributing rat poison in secret because they are losing customers to all the noise. Ideally eagles should be released in town to hunt them. That alone would be enough to at least keep them quiet. Until then poison will have to do.\n\nEagles! Eagles would be a great solution. Or Hawks! I was up most of last night again - this happens for about 9 months of EVERY year for at least the last 5 years. Yes, we live by the seaside. Yes, we love it here. Yes, we hate the gulls. Our council, in its wisdom, a few years ago stopped the culling or collection of seagull eggs here - because of monetary cutbacks imposed by the Government. The result is that here, as in many place, the seagull population is SPIRALLING. If each bird lives up to 40 years, say, and each pair produces 2 babies a year, which seems to be the average - that's an awful lot more seagulls in just 5 years, never mind more. Here, in a small seaside town in the North of England, we have food stolen from people's hands, cars parked outside constantly covered with their filthy shit, washing can't be hung outside or it will also be covered. Tourists are saying they don't want to come back after their sleep, hairstyles or even cars are spoiled by the birds. And the noise. And just think. ALL those extra birds - they will all need to EAT. That's why they are becoming more aggressive. It's been proved that they go by SIGHT. They can learn new tricks, and often have one more aggressive bird in a group, who will go first, knock the food out of someone's hand, so that the whole gang can then feast on your fish and chips. They are nothing but RATS, FLYING RATS. Why are we not poisoning them? If it were legal I certainly would be. I've spent so many of my sleepless nights fantasizing about killing seagulls. This plague is bad for people - how many people's sleep is badly disturbed by gulls now? Lack of sleep causes all kinds of ill health.\n\nEve\n\nWe are in 2016 in the United kingdom, a country that markets itself as world super power. People cannot sleep. I had to move house and got zero support from the council. I was even criticized for my choice to rent in central Brighton. I moved in hove where there are less nests because there are less rubbish exposed.\n\nCouncil is here only to collect the tax and copy/paste the law that these wild animals are protected. I am originally from a country with 3k+ islands and loads of seagulls, yet the council told me I should expect this behavior from the seagulls and this type of nuisance in ANY seaside resort.\n\nWhat I'm learning from my 7 years residency in the Great Britain is that I have no true rights in receiving any real support, regardless if I'm paying my taxes. Only my money is good here. As such, I have recently withdrew myself from any activity that would bring benefits to the society (i.e. I used to do volunteer work in WWT Arundel). Instead I shall concentrate all my energy and time on generating more profit by always using legal ways but shouldn't really care about any ethical aspects.\n\nThank you Great Britain for teaching me the value of acting in an individualistic manner and be selfish - after all, no one will care about me so why should I care about society environment and all that crap. All it really matters (especially when you don't hold the local nationality) is how big are my bank accounts balances as, the bigger they are the more dignity and prestige I can add to my lifestyle.\n\nI live right by the sea, opposite it in fact. I have done so for many years. The seagulls are noisy in the summer months til around 10.30pm, and start up again around 3.30am...I can honestly say it doesn't worry me one bit. Firstly, FC is right; the seaside isn't an appropriate residence for individuals who loathe the noise of these glorious birds. Ultimately, humankind has created this problem by creating a dirty, rubbish strewn environment. All animals - including humans! - are opportunistic, and you cannot blame the gulls for taking advantage of this. For example, the imbeciles who put there black rubbish bags out the day before collection - it's these fools you should be admonishing. Secondly, who is mankind to dictate who/what inhabits their environment?; Why should we take precedence over other species? I was dumbfounded by a comment made by an individual above, stating 'cities are for people, not gulls'! Maybe if humankind didn't encroach on other species natural habitats, and as a result affect their natural food source(s) a lot of these 'manmade' problems would not exist. I love gulls. They are majestically beautiful, intelligent birds. They are incredible parents, mate for life, and have every right to inhabit the same environment as ourselves. I would suggest that - as I am in the 'same boat' as yourselves- that you become a little bit more tolerant to nature and take the time to appreciate these magnificent birds. I would also like to point out it is a criminal offence to deliberately harm a seagull, or destroy a nest. I have my windows open at night. I also have a fan on in warmer weather. Yes, the noise during the breeding months is loud, but my God, I'd rather hear the gulls than the drunken idiots who loiter around the beach shouting and screaming throughout the early hours. Maybe we should suggest a cull of these anti-social buffoons....but then again culls don't work do they.\n\nIt's 4:09sm here in Blackpool and they have yet again woke me and my whole house up. I do not live near the sea shore and they drive us all mad. Also my partner works in Poulton which is even further inland and they are rampant on her work building. Why they are called seagulls now i don't know as they live nowhere near the sea.\n\nI also cannot stand human beings who have some sort of perverse attraction to these vermin and you can bet your life these seagul lovers do not live in an area where they make noise in the early house or sh*t their corrosive vile all over your car every single day or get aggressive with you because your house is near their nest on the roof of a neighbouring house. Don't get me started on the bin bag destruction which thanks to seagul proof bags has been contained somewhat but still they persist in our area.\n\nThis is a growing problem and seagulls are protected by an out of date law which isn't keeping with the times as they have breeder and become a major nuisance.\n\nI'm half tempted to leave out some bread mixed with rat poison (to use as a deterrent for rats) and I believe that will destroy the the vermin. If they happen to come into my garden and steal this bait for rats then I will consider that theft from the said vermin will auffer a quick demise and I will finally be able to get some sleep again.\n\nThis is out of control and the law should protect us from these annoying creatures, instead it protects them yet if I go out in the early hours, crap on people's cars and shout my head of and wake everyone up I'm pretty sure the boys in blue will be coming to lock me in a cell for the night for my anti social behaviour.\n\nThis needs to stop now and seagulls need to be culled in certain areas.\n\nSeagullVermin and to all those that feel these birds are an issue, you and I really need to understand there's nothing to expect from anyone. The council will only take care of rubbish in the posh and expensive streets, they don't really care what I or you with your British surname says. As I already wrote, in this country it only matters your bank account.\n\nIf we want to find peace from this genuine nuisance (birds are singing, seagulls are just screaming and I can't see any beauty or majesty on that), we have some options. We can either kill them in an unintended way (your example with the rat trap is a great attemp!), as the council told me ' you cannot harm them intentionall', so all it matters is what you can prove not the mere act itsel! Or we could do things to increase the balance of our bank account; that way we will earn council's respect and they will clean the rubbish from our street too. Being a foreigner I choose the second option. I will walk on top of everyone's body, I will grass all my colleagues, I will steal from the weak at every opportunity but within the line of the law, and any other act that will generate profit for me.\n\nIn other words, for as long as I'm residing in this island I will do whatever it takes to make as much money as possible regardless any ethical conflicts; I will only take care to he within the law. This is the only way to survive in this country with some dignity and sanity.\n\nI have no negative feelings/thoughts for any British man or woman - political and financial figures are an exception. But the country itself is a joke. It's been marketed as a world super power and people can't even sleep. People can't save (and have dignity at the same time). People can only work, travel to and from work, and pay taxes and bills. Oh, and drink alcohol as if there's no tomorrow. During my first year as a taxpayer I felt better than my home country. I was seeing developments, nice initiatives for socializing etc. Having spent more than 6 year now fully integrated into the UK lifestyle (with the exception of the TGIF concept and the British cuisin), I can sensibly argue this is not the case. The new buildings I see are all made in a rush and cheap way; a building of 2011 today suffers from damages due to humidity...The socializing events are in order to engage lonely people, but why so many people are alone? Why the grandparents are living in care houses, while they have dedicated half their lives to raise kids? what are these kids do? Putting their work career as top priority and family, health and so on go second.\n\nGoing back to the seagulls, since people are operating in such an individual manner, why do we expect any help from the council? What will the council earn by cleaning our street?\n\nTherefore, people in this country need to start be more proactive and apply their thinking. I understand the hand of law is long and the law is strict, but the lawmakers are living luxurious lives and don't suffer from their laws. As such, we either become lawmakers ourselves, or we violate their laws to the best of our ability so that we resolve our issue without creating new ones for us or our surroundings/neighbours.\n\nBest of luck with your efforts. As for those who call these birds 'majestic' you really need to justify your view otherwise you offend the term 'majesty'.\n\nI live in Whitstable where 5 years ago there were no gulls nesting in my street. The problem is recent and due to human interference and stupidity. I have come to the conclusion after 3 summers of serious sleep loss, that the people in my street who are not bothered by seagull noise are either: partially deaf, or, insomniac so that being woken at 4am 'doesn't bother' them. This opinion was also given to me by a second homer who only weekends here and is self employed, so presumably can nap in the day to catch up on lost sleep. The retired folk here can do the same, and they are also the ones feeding them despite reasoned protest from working neighbours who are currently ragged with lack of sleep. I holiday in a seaside town in Portugal each summer where I am not kept awake by seagulls. A fishing town much like the one I live in in the uk simply does not have a problem with nesting gulls. This is because the Portuguese people do not feed them or encourage them to be scavengers. I know they would regard this a highly stupid, the thought simply wouldn't cross their minds. This feeding also encourages their violent behaviour. I'd say the people meddling in the lives of wild birds by encouraging them to be scavengers should be fined by the council. The council have done nothing to educate people into not feeding the gulls. Canterbury city council have done precisely nothing. People who are blinded by sentimentality towards these birds and who persistently feed them are the real problem (along with litter and rubbish being available to scavenge from). I've got no interest in hearing from people who arent bothered by the noise and think they are magnificent birds while inhabiting urban areas, crapping on and attackig residents. Magnificent they are when out at sea and nesting in rural areas ' not in urban areas where a gulls cry is designed to be heard miles away.\n\nLongstone, Edinburgh, 6 years on... The chicks that hatched in 2010 are now fully breeding adult FLYING RATS! . There are potentially 10 perfect nesting sites which are on top of 5 tenements in the Redhall estate in Longstone. The noise, day and night have got out of hand. The mess on washing, cars and Windows is also worse than ever. I,m sick of it and have given up with Edinburgh Council. The Environmental Health department of the Council are experts at passing the buck. The excuse they use for not removing the nests are \"the tenements are occupied by a mixture of private and Council tennents\". They want the private residents to sort out the nest removal and then claim the Council tennents share. Very convenient for them but logistically this would be a nightmare. There are so many obstacles in the way ( nationwide) of solving this horrendous problem. Whether you are a bird lover or not, the fact is, this problem will need to be tackled sooner or later. They are becoming a serious threat to other bird species and environmental health. My personal opinion is, these urban gulls (that don't even know where the sea is ), need to be re classified as vermin and dealt with in the same way as rats. Rant over.......\n\nLongstone, Edinburgh, 6 years on... The chicks that hatched in 2010 are now fully breeding adult FLYING RATS! .

Rant over.......\n\nKirkcaldy high street. Avoid like the plague or find yourself in Hell. I live between two shopping centres, both with nesting birds on top. So I can net or spike my roof to within an inch of its life and I'll still be living on their flight path. They have babies now, all along the roofs of surrounding shops. You should hear it out there at night. High pitched squeaking babies. Answering screaming adults. And through the day, when heaven forbid humans want to shop, they go nuts. And since people tend to wander along late at night too, the screaming is pretty much 24/7. Add in the screaming drinks at weekends and the daily wailing day-long buskers and I seriously am verging on suicidal. And neither police, nor Council nor environmental health give a damn. My only ambition is to figure out how I can get the Hell away from here.\n\nTo say it's living beside the sea and therefore tough, is a heap of BS. I have just come from a village on the north west of Scotland where I was living at the top of the beach and barely saw a gull let alone heard any screaming.\n\nAnd AZ I completely understand. I came here meaning to integrate, get to know the \"community\" and contribute in a positive way. There IS no community! Nobody gives a damn."
