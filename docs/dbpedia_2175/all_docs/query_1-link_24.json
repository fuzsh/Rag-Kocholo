That’s something you don’t usually see. Becky Consonni solves the seagull mystery!:\n\nJust last month there were sooooo many Canadian Geese visiting the west end of the lake. One day I think I counted 300! Then one morning I saw this white bird flying with a group of nine geese. This bird had black tips on the end of it’s wings and was bigger than a sea gull. When I saw that it had landed in an area that you can view from Hyde Road, I jumped in my car (still in my pajamas!) with camera in hand. I pulled over to the side of the road near the boat launch with my emergency flashers on. A Columbia Township Police Officer stopped next to me and asked if I was okay. I said: “LOOK! A SNOW GOOSE!” He was as surprised as I was, and I was grateful he didn’t make me get out of my car.\n\nUpon researching this with the help of Google, I found that this was not really a snow goose. It is a Ross’s Goose. My mother was wrong when she said “birds of a feather flock together” in this case."
