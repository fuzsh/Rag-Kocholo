        "text": "Good lord.\n\nI was driving down a street in Providence when I saw a seagull standing the middle of the road. There was a pile of spilled potatoe chips or something so it was doing what seagull do best: eating garbage. The thing is, the seagull knew I was coming closer with my car, I saw it watch me with its black doll eyes, but the damn bird didn't want to move. I'm here in the driver's seat thinking it would fly away like any other normal bird, but no, the seagull wasn't planning on flying anytime soon. Well, that isn't entirely true. It did try to fly away...but at the last second. So yeah, I hit it.\n\nDamn, when did certain birds become so fat and lazy that they aren't willing to fly away from danger...or atleast move aside? That seagull reminds me of those fat winged rats in New York City. I couldn't swerve to the side or competely stop; that would be dangerous on a fairly busy city street.\n\nA seagull is not a small bird or rodent. It's not a squirrel or chipmunk. When you hit a seagull...you feel it. There isn't much question.\n\nSo...to make me feel better...anyone else ever hit a bird with their car?\n\nSnailIracing:n(500tpostshpereline)pants\n\n-----------------------------@%\n\nOnce when my family was driving along a highway through the Sandhills the car started making a funny noise. We pulled over, and it turned out a bird had gotten lodged in the engine somewhere.\n\nWhy do the heathens rage behind the firehouse?\n\nSome sort of small bird, maybe a sparrow or something, once swooped in front of my car and got stuck in my front bumper when I hit it. I saw it in a parking lot, its neck broke on impact.\n\nAlso a little while ago a groundhog jumps in front of my car. I was going 35 and didn't even have enough time to brake, it jumped out so quickly. I hit it between my wheels. In the rearview mirror, I see it roll twice, then merrily walk off the road and down into the creekbed on the other side.\n\nMarsz, marsz, Dąbrowski,\n\nZ ziemi włoskiej do Polski,\n\nZa twoim przewodem\n\nZłączym się z narodem.\n\nOriginally posted by Warlockmish:\n\nWow Savage, something like that happens only once in a lifetime.\n\nPfft, nothing.\n\nAbout 15 years ago my friend's dad was driving along the motorway at night, when a duck flew through the windsheild and hit the back window. Needless to say it died, but luckily it was a company car.\n\nActually about 2 years ago I was heading down to my gran's for the weekend, and we were driving past a field in this town when 2 cats chasing each other come flying across the road. My dad hits the brakes, but he only saw one of them run away. He waits a sec and then drives forwards a few feet. Yeah, the car mysteriously dropped a few inches at the back when he moved.\n\nnope."
