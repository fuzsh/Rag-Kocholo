        "text": "Today, my group had its annual White Elephant. Last year, I won a thumbs-up statue from sprizee’s Dude. This year, I grabbed a gift referencing Festivus, opened the gift and within 2 seconds realized where I’d seen it. After the shortened 4th of July excursion to the Olympic Peninsula, our friend Beth (and former coworker) gave sprizee’s Dude a Damn Seagulls cap. I was happy to pass on a Cigarette-Dispensing Donkey. Good times.\n\nIn researching the earlier statue, I found this re-enactment of last year’s statue."
