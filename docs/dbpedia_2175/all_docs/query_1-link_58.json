        "text": "Pottstown >> The Mercury received a concrete answer to the seagull question and it appears to be slightly more scientific than the gulls’ preference for open spaces.\n\nAfter a long day of futile attempts to find an expert on seagulls, we received a call from a local scientist who was intrigued enough by our recent article to provide us with a solid explanation for the unusually large number of seagulls that have been loitering in parking lots and hovering around the Schuylkill River in Pottstown.\n\nGerald Waterfield, a local fisheries scientist with Normandeau Environmental Consultants in Stowe, called the Mercury Thursday morning to let us know that he had a much more direct reason for the boom in the gull presence.\n\nPopular theories about the gulls included a migration to the area because of the still-icy Great Lakes, as well as an early shad run that drew them to Pottstown. Those who guessed their arrival was because of an early shad run apparently weren’t too far off.\n\n“The ‘feast of the gulls’ is an annual event on the Schuylkill River during late winter,” explained Waterfield. “Blue Marsh Reservoir has a deep water outflow so that when The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers make releases through the dam, the water is cold during the summer … The Army Corps of Engineers releases water during the winter to allow for spring flooding.”\n\nWaterfield explained that this release of water draws many alewife fish through the dam. Though they do not have an accurate estimate of how many fish are drawn from the reservoir, Waterfield assumed that it must be an extremely high number to attract so many gulls along the river for so long a time.\n\nThe alewife are about four or five inches long and by this point in the season are usually full grown adults. As the alewife are pulled from the deep waters of the reservoir into the more shallow waters of Tulpehocken Creek and the Schuylkill River they likely suffer from “gas bubble trauma.” When this happens, Waterfield explained, “the gasses in their bodies come out of solution and gas bubbles pass through the brain and lodge there and cause brain bleeding or go to capillaries and burst them.” Waterfield compared the process to nitrogen narcosis, the trauma divers experience when they emerge from deep waters too quickly.\n\nThe alewife are then dead, dying or disoriented as they float or struggle near the surface of the water, making them vulnerable to scavenging gulls. Waterfield suspected that the gulls came from nearby landfills when they determined that the fish were moving down the river.\n\nThis year’s “feast of the gulls” lasted about seven days, from March 12 to March 17, according to waterdata.usgs.gov.\n\nWaterfield explained that Normandeau Associates have collected alewives at other times during the year but he suspects that the number of fish released from the reservoir during other seasons is only a fraction of what is released during the “winter drawdown.”"
