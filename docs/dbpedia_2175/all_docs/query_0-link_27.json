        "text": "For all that Brighton is associated with seagulls, it turns out the city isn’t the best place to be one. Our buildings are too tall, our roads too busy, our town centre too full of drunken revellers. So, if you’re a baby seagull blown from a roof too tall to be put back, the chances of you surviving are slim. This is ‘nature’, of course, and there’s no denying that a baby seagull makes a fine meal for a fox. But, with climate change comes more high winds, lashing rain and storms that take chicks from their parents. Herring gulls are red-listed and have recently been hammered by bird flu – there’s a noticeable absence of them and their lesser black-backed cousins around town this year. Plus, with the building of cities comes the responsibility of looking after the wild inhabitants of those cities. Or at least I think so. Luckily for the gulls, although perhaps not for the foxes, there’s a team of volunteers who drive around, picking up chicks and putting them back on roofs – those too tall or out of reach for a ‘put-back’ end up in a rescue centre.\n\nBut the rescue centres are full, and so garden sheds across the city are becoming mini rehab units, where seagull chicks can safely develop their flight feathers before being transferred to an aviary where they will learn to fly. This year, me and my shed join the effort. I clear a space on the floor and board off the lawn mower and dangerous tools. I line the windows with bubble wrap to soften the blow of any attempts at escape, and lay cardboard and old bedding – including an old cat bed on which they can snuggle together at night – on the floor. We are given the all-clear from an expert rehabber and told to await a call.\n\nThey arrive on Thursday: three parcels of squawk and dinosaur; three shed destroyers; three life-upenders; three dog-botherers. Five weeks old and completely helpless, completely reliant on me.\n\nI set them up in the shed but also make them a den outside, using an old rabbit run, so they can feel grass beneath their feet, splash about in the bird bath, watch adult gulls soar overhead. I feel better about having them in my care when they’re outside, as they’re supposed to be. I give them sticks and pieces of cardboard to play with, straw to nestle into. I feed them cat food and watch them preen and play, watch them scrap with their adopted siblings. I realise, quickly, that I can’t do anything but watch them because of the fox that sleeps on the shed roof. I panic. I wonder what I have done to myself (along with my partner, Emma, and dog, Tosca), having taken these three little birds into my life that need an inordinate amount of ‘watching’. And no, I won’t just leave them in the shed.\n\nI spend two days hating it. I hate their smell, I hate clearing up their shit, I hate their screams as I move them between shed and rabbit run. I nearly call the rescue and tell them I’m not coping. The dog is stressed, too. She seems to have taken on the role of seagull protector and suddenly won’t sleep, choosing, instead, to watch them with me, to protect them from the fox. Emma is kind – she names them Alvin, Simon and Theodore after the 80s kids’ TV show Alvin and the Chipmunks – but is leaving me to it. “They’re your baby seagulls”, she says.\n\nI’m reminded of when we first got Tosca. I’d never had a dog before and had no idea what I was letting myself in for. An anxious rescue, she slept in bed with the woman who fostered her, and we were encouraged to do the same, despite misgivings. I’ll never forget that first night of being spooned by a strange dog, feeling her breath on the back of my neck as I lay, sleepless, wondering what on Earth I had done to myself.\n\nIt took two weeks to adjust and fall in love with the dog, to understand her language – when she wanted food or a wee or to play or a walk – to learn how to live my life with her in it. It took four days to fall in love with the baby seagulls.\n\nInitially stressed because I couldn’t leave the house, I suddenly find myself enjoying spending more time at home, keeping an eye on them. Suddenly Emma and I are drinking beer in the garden on a Friday evening laughing at baby gulls practising their adult calls. Suddenly we have a distraction from the noise of daily life – a huge win for Emma, who runs her own business as well as teaching spin classes, and who rarely stops.\n\n“This is what life’s about”, I say to Emma, as we watch Alvin and Simon fight over a stick.\n\n“Yes”, she laughs, “it really is”, and she admits to enjoying having them around. Have the baby seagulls taught us how to live?\n\nI buy 10kg of frozen sprats and feed these (defrosted) to the chicks instead of cat food. Suddenly they and their shit don’t stink. I no longer gag entering the shed each morning, and no longer need to change their bedding as often. When the weather is kind I work outside or potter or read alongside them. (I read!) When it’s not I move the run to the side return so I can see them from my desk, leaving the window open so any squawk alerts the dog, who runs out to shout at the fox. Usually, on a Tuesday, Emma takes Tosca to work with her and I stay at home for my designated ‘Writing Day’.\n\n“I can’t do this without the dog”, I say, “please, will you leave her with me?”\n\nAs for Tosca, I’ve no idea what she thinks or feels, but she’s being gentle and kind and… loving? After obsessively watching their every move for the first few days she, like me, has calmed down, and seems to enjoy having them in her care. She insists on coming to say hello to them each morning and oversees the delivery of sprats, and she sleeps with an ear cocked for stressed seagull or prowling fox. When she’s feeling playful, we ask “where’s Monkey?” and she runs and fetches Monkey or sometimes Slothy or Bear or a ball and we run around chasing her with it while growling (for some reason we all growl). On Saturday we break it to her that she can’t play with the baby seagulls, and she sits with them and makes a noise we’ve not heard before, as if she’s actually trying to talk to them.\n\nThe fox watches them from the wall until Tosca barks him off, and she returns to the rabbit run and whimpers to them, looking back at the fox, as if genuinely concerned at the consequences of not seeing him away. At night, she paws at the back door and woofs me in to the garden.\n\n“I think she wants to show you a hedgehog”, says Emma. I get up and go out with her, and she pads, gently, to the shed, sits down and looks at the door.\n\n“And?” says Emma as we return to the sofa,\n\n\"It wasn't a hedgehog,” I reply, “she just wanted to say goodnight to the baby seagulls.\"\n\nI think she would groom them if we, or the seagulls, would let her. I think she’d snuggle up in the cat bed with them in the shed. They are her siblings, or her puppies, or her playmates, now, and we are all part of one slightly unusual family. It’s a difficult balance to strike, one of recognising her role as protecting the gulls from the fox, while also accepting that dogs are no friend of seagulls in the wild and the gulls must never think they’re safe with her. For all that I love her protective ways, I am trying to limit her contact with them as much as possible. I hope I’m getting this right.\n\nI’m not sure I want Alvin, Simon and Theodore to go to an aviary to learn to fly before being released, and I find myself lying in bed at night working out how and where to build them an aviary so they can learn to fly here. Imagine taking them to the beach to release them with Emma and the dog, weeks after they arrived as mere parcels of squawk, and dinosaur.\n\nHey! The team of people keeping Brighton and Hove’s gulls and other wildlife safe can only operate with the help of donations.
