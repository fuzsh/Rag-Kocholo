        "text": "Birds across the world are occupying landfills and moving to cities, as changing human habits threaten ever more wilderness\n\nThe seagull is no more. Most gulls in Britain, and many in mainland Europe and across North America, are now urban birds rather than the seaside signifiers they once were. Gulls will snatch a chip from your fingers as happily in the city centre of Bristol as on the Great Yarmouth seaside promenade. The councils of both places have spent money on gull-baffling waste bins and on posters encouraging human populations not to pander to the trash birds. They don’t explicitly call them that but a new (and worldwide) demonisation is certainly abroad, castigating almost every life form that has found a way to live and thrive alongside us. Waste lies at the heart of this, for it is that – the rich pickings to be had from our crapola, the waste that William Empson said remains – that has brought these other species close.\n\nOur rubbish, and our relationship with it, lured the gulls from the sea. In Britain, the 1956 Clean Air Act forbade the incineration of garbage and created landfill sites. Ever since, a throwaway culture has grown new tumuli across the country – burial heaps and long barrows at the edge of every conurbation. Paradoxically, these baleful end-stations for all our junk teem with abundant life. Suffering shortages of their traditional marine sustenance (thanks again to human fouling and overfishing of the seas), gulls headed for the new feed from then on. Half an hour gobbling the edible contents of a macerated bin bag at Pitsea dump in Essex gave herring gulls the same nutritional fix they once found in a day-long trawl of their old seashore haunts. In just a few gull generations, they became thoroughly adept at adaptation – a wave of urbanised interlopers who knew how to work the drosscape. Their scavenging ways made them exemplary recyclers before humans cottoned on to that need. And because they were already in town for the food, they stayed to breed, swapping cliffs and offshore islands for the roofs of tower blocks and industrial sheds. It would be a hard job to justify calling them seagulls now.\n\n‘Most of nature now lives in our scurf and dreck’\n\nHuman populations anywhere on the planet recognise a trash bird or two in their avifauna. The globalised Anthropocene has fostered common ills. Most so-called pest species, creatures thought to have gone somehow beyond nature, have travelled there due to modernity’s global error regarding the disposable. Dirt is matter out of place, in Mary Douglas’s memorable formulation, so almost anything might be thought dirty and therefore bad: in their pursuit of our dirt, taking them to new zones and into a new proximity with us, the gulls appeared dirty themselves.\n\nThey aren’t, of course. But it is true that most of nature now lives in our scurf and dreck. In North America it could be the European starling, a highly successful invasive alien; in Addis Ababa, black kites and marabou storks; in Johannesburg, it could be the Egyptian goose or the Indian myna. The sacred ibis in Australia is a relative of the same species revered and mummified by the ancient Egyptians – nowadays it is commonly dubbed a bin chicken. All these species are doing well, thanks to us. We are not sure we approve, hence the derogatory names. Across Spain, there are white storks that no longer migrate south for the winter because Spanish landfills are calorifically warm enough to see them through the cold months. They eat jettisoned paella, not frogs, but that is good grub for them (at least in the short term).\n\nIn Socotra, Yemen, Egyptian vultures are regarded as ecosystem service providers: there is no organised trash disposal on the island other than the vultures that eat up to 22.4 per cent of the organic waste annually produced in towns. In Britain, pheasants are trash birds in a different way to vultures or gulls. They don’t consume our waste but their trashed bodies pave many roads after the obscene annual over-production of birds for shooting leads to massive vehicle collision carnage. The pheasant biomass and species appetite has been equated with herds of elephants being set loose across lowland Britain. To our mind though, the bird has degraded itself in its semi-surrender to humankind in its forgoing of its wild status, so that the closer it comes to us, the less we think of it.\n\n‘We have made it harder for wild life to have a wild life and so those that can do so have come to bivouac, like us, in the remains of consumerism’\n\nIt isn’t only birds: urban foxes are scavenging almost everywhere; Indian cities have leopards snaffling whatever they can; waste-guzzling wild boars rampage across Barcelona; brown bears intercept feculent bin bags of trash en route to dumpsters in Brașov, Romania; piss-yellow polar bears loiter around every Siberian dump. All are dirtied by our dirt. Humans mean food, human waste places mean concentrations of food. We have made it harder for wild life to have a wild life (thanks to our globally destructive earthworks including habitat degradation, land grabs, pollution, and climate chaos) and so those that can do so have come to bivouac, like us, in the remains of consumerism. They are nature’s survivors – they have had to be, and they are smart. The gulls that use British landfills know not to turn up on Sundays (though they are bewildered by bank holidays), and every school playground has groups of attendant gulls that know exactly when the remains of packed lunches might litter the asphalt.\n\nApart perhaps from Socotra’s vultures though, there are as yet no new sacred cows comparable to the original beasts of Hindu India permitted to live freely among people because they are understood as somehow good and holy. Other vultures, especially in India and Tibet, that once did the unsanitary work of excarnating, or defleshing, human corpses, are now mostly dead themselves. Ninety-nine per cent of South Asian vultures have been wiped out, poisoned after ingesting toxic anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac) used on cattle. Meanwhile, bird-scaring is back in Britain: hawks are flown at flocking pigeons; nets are slung across gull-breeding sites on city-centre rooftops; the abundant eggs of Canada geese are pricked or oiled to ensure that they won’t hatch; pet owners in south-west England have grappled with gulls that had their eyes and beaks on a garden tortoise or a weedy Chihuahua. It is even suggested in some areas that you should be on your guard, wearing a hat and carrying a stick when you walk out with your bag of chips.\n\nThere’s a political dimension to this: these animals represent a biological underclass. We see them as aliens or immigrants or scavengers or beggars rather than – as we just as legitimately might – as go-getting entrepreneurs moving with the times and seeking out new livings. They are identified with the poor. But what has the European starling done in North America since a handful of birds were released in New York City in the late 19th century? They have done exactly what human Europeans did: made refugee landfall in the east, set up shop and prospered, moved west. We don’t often notice the parallel. Trash birds point elsewhere on the food chain too, in a way that ought to disturb us. At Cape Town dump, the kelp gulls jockey with sump-stained pelicans and rust-coloured sacred ibises, but also with human scavengers working through the city’s filth, pan-handling, begging for it.\n\nOne of the reasons why there were no gulls in Victorian London – hardly a single one travelled up the tidal Thames – is because there was nothing for them. There was rubbish aplenty, heaving and stinking middens of it, but the living these birds have more recently made in the city was then work done by people. The gulls wouldn’t have been able to compete with the human scavengers that cram the pages of Charles Dickens’ Our Mutual Friend (a good candidate for the greatest novel about waste). Or with those who fill the endless lists of sweepers, waste workers, dust sifters, night soil shifters, dog pure gatherers, among the multiple work categories found within Henry Mayhew’s monumental and magnificent work London Labour and the London Poor. Think of the smells from then lost to time!\n\nI’m old enough to have a leftover olfactory memory of dustbins unemptied during the strike in the British Winter of Discontent in 1979, when landfill came to every front door; and I know well what a modern dump smells of – sweet death. But that presumably has nothing on the colossal cloaca maxima that was London for much of its history until the 20th century.\n\nAt Pitsea, to watch the gulls feed, we had to sign indemnity forms and wear hard hats and steel toecaps. The foulness of the landfill got you nonetheless. We had, it seemed, gone to hell in a dustcart. Everywhere was refulgent with nastiness: the whole of the tipping area soupily crusted in a neon pink fungal eruption, with the rotting plasma having a sickly and sticky afterlife that stuck to my boots and bunged up my nose. There was only rubbish to stand on and nothing to breathe that wasn’t rotten. My throat was gritted with it, my eyes ran with it, my ears sang with it. It was extraordinary to think of the foul magma of everything 40 metres down below my feet having once been touched by human hands. Yet, for such a dying and killing zone, it was also strangely vivifying. Some version of a vendange tardive, or late harvest, was possible there. After a macerator chewed up a delivery of fast-food discards, dinge-toned red foxes started running towards the edible goodies from all corners of the dump – the baby-pink of the flesh of their open jaws the same pink as the neon grime. Before they got there, it seemed like a thousand gulls – herring and lesser black-backed – arrived to dine and held the foxes off with a raucous carnival that lasted as long as the food. It was life, no mistake. And the feasting birds – maligned by many for their very usefulness – seemed perfectly apt expressions of our botched tenancy of the planet.\n\n‘The longer-term fate of such places is usually to be capped and returned to the status of another non-place: a designated park area for civically imagined leisure activities’\n\nNot now. Now food-waste recycling happens elsewhere, the life of the dump is running down. We still throw far too much away and the dumps will continue to grow but they will foster less life. The gulls have already left Pitsea – for France, my gulling friends said, where recycling is less developed and the chips are certainly better. The longer-term fate of such places is usually to be capped and returned to the status of another non-place: a designated park area for civically imagined leisure activities. Others cannot even be obscured: some are fenced and grassed but then must be planted with black pipes reaching up like a golgotha of dead trees into the exurbian air, pipes to extract the noxious gases percolating upwards from the filth below. I preferred the honesty of the shit heap. And the gulls that went with it.\n\nThe world can be too clean, too clinical, too tidy, too dusted. Swallow numbers are falling in Britain because swallows need flies and the flies they like best need filth. There is no longer enough muck in the post-agricultural hectares of most of the country. Swallows are not trash birds, and they are a far cry from the gulls of the old landfills, but these days they are absent for similar reasons. We know no better how to be clean than we did to be dirty."
