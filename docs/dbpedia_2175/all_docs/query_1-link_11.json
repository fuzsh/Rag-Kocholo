        "text": "Gulls can certainly be bullies but it doesn't help that the owners put the bowls so close together!\n\nFeed the gull away from the cat and stand guard for the cat!\n\nNot feeding the gull would probably not work as seagulls aren't always scared of people so it would still ignore them and steal the cat's food.\n\nStud u like good suggestions but it says in the article that the cat won't eat anywhere else.\n\nMind you the cat could be losing rate from stress from the gull or if the cat is that elderly he could be losing weight due to renal failure, rather than just from getting less food.\n\n0\n\nWe were on holiday in Cornwall a couple of weeks ago and bought Fish and Chips from Rick Stein's chippy in Padstow. As we left the shop a seagull actually swooped down several times and tried to steal my OH's chips! He had to fight the damn thing off! It was dive bombing him, and quite shook him up!\n\nI was mugged by a seagull in St. Ives once - dropped a whole pasty when it banged into my shoulder. Mind you - I made sure the dog had it (or at least as much as I was prepared to let her have), and the seagull had none.\n\nPS: The local news recently featured a school on the south coast which had to turn off its wind turbine because it was chopping up herring gulls. Apparently those nasty things are endangered.\n\n0\n\nA friend of mine told me of a holiday she was on a few years ago at a seaside resort.\n\nShe was walking along the sea front on a hot day with plenty of people enjoying the sunshine.\n\nThere was a family near her and their little girl had an ice cream or similar to eat.\n\nThese seagulls can spot someone with food from who knows what sort of distance away and began dive bombing her.\n\nThis girl was only a little tot and was very frightened by this bird, so to defend her, her dad took a swing at this bird on its next attack and knock it clean out.\n\nMy friend walked over to have a look and a few people had gathered to have a look.\n\nThe seagull was still for 20 seconds or so before coming round and rather shakily flying off.\n\nShe said it was an amazing sight.\n\nI think the little girl recovered ok after.\n\nThe dad was acting like it was a big deal.\n\n0\n\nJust another symptom of mans selfish impact on the natural habitat of a wild creature.\n\nIt's nothing to do with natural habitat of a wild creature - which in the case of gulls is windswept cliff faces far from human habitation. Gulls moved to towns back in the early days of mass fisheries to eat all the guts etc that were discarded, and have flourished because of takeaway food and black bin liner bags. Their habits have changed even in my lifetime. You never used to see them in town centres at all, just at the docks.\n\n0"
