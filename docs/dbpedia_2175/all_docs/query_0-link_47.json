        "text": "Michigan is home to nine bat species. All of Michigan’s bats primarily eat insects. These insectivores provide important benefits to farmers and landowners by consuming harmful insects that damage crops. All bat species in Michigan are protected and may not be harmed. If you find a dead bat outdoors, contact your local DNR office to have it submitted for disease testing.\n\nBats can become nuisances when they enter homes, businesses or outbuildings. Bats can enter through very small cracks – just 1 ¼ inch by 3/8 inches in size.\n\nLearn more on our bat page.\n\nPrevent bats from entering buildings\n\nConduct a thorough inspection in the early spring. Bats have pups around May 16 – July 31, it is difficult to remove all the pups during this timeframe.\n\nMonitor for entrance or exit holes.\n\nSeal any secondary exits or entrances.\n\nInstall a bat house outside of the building in an area safe for bats to reside. Instructions for how to build a bat house can be found at Michigan.gov/Bats.\n\nCheck it out before you let it out\n\nIf you suspect a person has been bitten by a bat or has had direct exposure, contact your local health department. Bats can transmit rabies to humans.\n\nIf you suspect a pet has been bitten by a bat, contact your veterinarian. Bats can transmit rabies to animals as well.\n\nIf the bat is dead, take it to the Health Department or veterinarian for disease testing.\n\nLearn more about rabies at Michigan.gov/Rabies.\n\nRemoving bats from the attic\n\nDuring the pup rearing time (approximately May 16 – July 31), it can be very difficult to remove bats, even with one-way doors. Young bats will struggle to escape and will likely die without their mothers. Consider removing them prior to or after the pup rearing time to avoid causing impacts to bat populations.\n\nInstall a one-way bat exclusion device to the main exit/entrance. Leave in place for a few days until bats leave, remove device, and then seal off entrance/exit.\n\nFor large colonies of bats, contact a nuisance animal control company.\n\nRemoving bats from the home\n\nIf it has been determined by the local health department or veterinarian that no exposure has occurred and the bat is not needed for testing, here are some tips for removing the bat:\n\nConfine the bat to one room.\n\nOpen windows. Close the doors to the room and wait for the bat to leave.\n\nIf the bat does not leave overnight, call a nuisance animal control company.\n\nIf you choose to try to capture the bat yourself, always wear thick gloves. Slide a shoebox or other sturdy container over the bat and quickly place the lid on the box. Take the box outdoors, loosen the lid, and lean the box against a tree so that the bat may climb out. Bats cannot take flight from the ground, so use a rough structure that the bat can grip when releasing.\n\nIf the bat enters the home in the winter, they should not be chased or released outdoors as they will not survive. Instead, call a nuisance control company.\n\nPlease note that Canada goose roundup and relocation has been cancelled in 2023 due to highly pathogenic avian influenza.\n\nCanada geese have experienced population growth in areas throughout North America, including Michigan. This trend is due in part to the success of wildlife management programs and the adaptability of these magnificent birds. Canada geese nest in every Michigan county, but are most common in the southern third of the state.\n\nPreventing conflicts with geese at home:\n\nMake your yard less attractive to geese by allowing the grass to grow long. Don’t fertilize or water it.\n\nUse scare tactics to frighten geese away.\n\nScare tactics could include: Shell crackers, bird alarms or bird bangers, distress cries, screamers, electronic noise systems, motion detector accessories, bird scare balloons, mylar scare tape, and plastic flags.\n\nRepellents may help in the short-term to deter geese from feeding on the grass. Repellents made from grape extract may repel birds from turf areas.\n\nIn June and July, Canada geese are molting and unable to fly. Construct a temporary barrier between your yard and the water to keep flightless geese out.\n\nDo not feed Canada geese. Artificial feeding can habituate them and harm their digestive system. Bread products are not beneficial to waterfowl survival.\n\nBe aware of your surroundings when visiting parks and areas near water. Canada geese are protective of their nests and hatchlings. Do not disturb them or get too close.\n\nNests, aggressive geese, and population control options:\n\nCanada goose hunting seasons are available throughout the state. Hunting is an effective and economical tool to control goose populations. Season dates and bag limits can be found in the current Waterfowl Hunting Digest at Michigan.gov/Waterfowl.\n\nBird nests and the eggs they may contain are protected under federal law. It is illegal to touch, move, or possess any part of the nest or eggs without the proper permit.\n\nIn many urban areas, hunting may not be allowed for certain reasons. In this case, specially permitted nuisance control companies can be hired to assist landowners with goose control programs.\n\nContact the USDA Wildlife Services for removal assistance including nest destruction and relocation permits.\n\nCanada goose permit and contractor information\n\nNuisance Canada goose FAQs\n\nYou can contact your local DNR office if there is an aggressive Canada goose causing a public safety risk, farm damage, or an inappropriate nest in your area.\n\nResources\n\nCanada goose SMART brochure\n\nCanada goose SMART brochure (accessible)\n\nCoyotes are common throughout Michigan in rural and urban areas. They are active day and night, but most active around sunrise and sunset. They are abundant in areas where adequate food, cover and water are available. Breeding takes place January - March and people are more likely to see and hear coyotes during this time.\n\nNuisance coyote FAQ\n\nPrevention and Control Tips\n\nFor your safety, NEVER intentionally feed or try to tame coyotes. It is critical that they retain their natural fear of people.\n\nEliminate outside food sources.\n\nGarbage or pet food left out may draw their attention.\n\nCoyotes may also take advantage of the small mammals and birds that bird feeders and gardens often attract.\n\nClear out brush piles that provide hiding places for small mammals and birds.\n\nKeep small pets indoors or accompany them outside and keep them on a leash.\n\nCoyotes, like any wild animal, can act unpredictably and should be treated with respect and enjoyed from a distance.\n\nIf you see a coyote in your area, try to scare it off by yelling, clapping or making other loud noises. Most coyotes are naturally afraid of people and will leave if you frighten them. Watch the video: How to haze a nuisance coyote.\n\nRemoval Tips\n\nCoyote hunting and trapping seasons are available statewide. Details on season dates and bag limits can be found in the Fur Harvester Digest.\n\nIf problems exist outside regular hunting or trapping seasons, coyotes can be killed without a license on private land by the landowner or a designee if the coyote is doing or about to do damage to private property, pets, livestock, or humans.\n\nIn some areas, hunting or trapping may not be allowed for certain reasons. In this case, specially permitted nuisance control companies can be hired to assist landowners in the safe removal of problem animals.\n\nIf coyote depredation on livestock becomes a problem, please call or text 1-800-292-7800, 24-hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nResources\n\nCoyote SMART Brochure\n\nCoyote SMART Brochure accessible\n\nWhite-tailed deer are found in every county in Michigan and can easily adapt to their surroundings. Deer can be found in just about every habitat type, including both urban and suburban areas.\n\nIn urban and suburban areas, white-tailed deer will take advantage of gardens and landscaping for food. They may even try to feed from bird feeders. By removing potential food sources and protecting gardens with fencing, deer may move to other areas for food. Never intentionally feed or try to tame a white-tailed deer.\n\nPrevention and control tips\n\nDo not intentionally feed deer.\n\nRemove or modify bird feeders to prevent deer from accessing the food.\n\nConstruct fences or put wiring around gardens or individual plants to protect from damage.\n\nUse scare tactics to frighten deer away.\n\nTry repellents or modify landscaping. Use plants that are less likely to be eaten by deer.\n\nMSU Extension: Smart gardening to deter deer\n\nMSU Extension: Deer-resistant plants for homeowners\n\nLeave fawns in the wild; it is not unusual to find a fawn on its own.\n\nHunting is one option communities may use to help reduce deer populations in their area. If hunting is not currently an option in your area, try some non-lethal deterrent methods to discourage deer. Deterrent methods are generally a short-term solution to solve issues, but they usually aren't effective long-term. Examples of deterrents include fencing to keep deer out of a specific area, using noise and visual scare tactics, applying taste deterrents to ornamental plants, removing feed and making bird feeders inaccessible to deer.\n\nDeer may be aggressive towards pets, particularly dogs, that they view as a predator/threat. If a deer is acting aggressive or attacking a pet, use scare tactics to frighten the deer away and bring the pet indoors until the deer has left the area. Accompany your pet outdoors and keep it on a leash.\n\nThe local DNR office can be contacted if there is an aggressive white-tailed deer causing a public safety risk, a sick deer, agricultural or horticultural damage, or for additional prevention and control options.\n\nResources\n\nDeer SMART Brochure\n\nDeer SMART Brochure (Accessible)\n\nOne of the world’s most aggressive waterfowl species, especially while nesting and raising their young, mute swans drive out native waterfowl and other wetland wildlife with their hostile behavior. Mute swans will chase native breeding birds from their nests.\n\nYou and your neighbors can help protect Michigan’s natural resources by controlling invasive mute swans on your lakes and wetlands. Though hunting mute swans is not allowed, the DNR issues permits to remove mute swans and/or their nests and eggs. If you have mute swans on your property and wish to remove them or their nests and eggs, you must request a mute swan removal permit.\n\nLearn more about mute swans at Michigan.gov/MuteSwans.\n\nIt’s very common to spot a raccoon in an urban environment. Living near humans provides abundant food sources and cover for raccoons. They are well known for eating food scraps from the garbage and outdoor pet food. Occasionally, raccoons will enter homes, attics or garages, if given the opportunity. Raccoons are omnivores and eat a wide variety of foods. They generally spend the day sleeping in trees, but it’s common for them to try and den under buildings, decks or wood piles. Racoons can become a nuisance when they start to do damage to landscaped plants and yards when digging for bugs to eat. They also will feed on chickens and other small livestock.\n\nPrevention and control Tips\n\nRemove food sources like pet food and ensure that garbage is securely tucked in an animal-proof container. Put garbage out the morning of garbage pick-up rather than the night before.\n\nFruits and vegetables in gardens can attract raccoons. Use fencing to protect gardens or individual plants from wildlife. A single or double strand hot-wire/electric fence may help discourage raccoons from gardens.\n\nIf a raccoon gets into an attic, use noise (loud radio, banging pots and pans) or ammonia-soaked rags to scare the raccoon out. Make sure to seal the opening through which the raccoon entered once the raccoon leaves.\n\nTo keep raccoons from climbing onto a roof, cut any tree limbs that overhang the roof. Also be sure to cap your chimney to keep raccoons from climbing in your fireplace.\n\nSeal pet doors at night to keep raccoons from entering your house.\n\nRaccoons will sometimes climb into window wells and find themselves unable to climb out. Place a rough board into the well and allow the raccoons to climb out.\n\nBe sure all poultry livestock are in secure locations, especially at night and attempt to place all roosting areas away from fencing as raccoons are often able to reach through most wire fencing.\n\nRemoval Tips\n\nIn areas where hunting is allowed, raccoons may be taken without a hunting license if they are doing or about to do damage.\n\nIn areas where hunting and trapping is not allowed, you may contact a nuisance animal control company.\n\nContact the Michigan Trappers & Predator Callers to see if they have anyone interested in trapping the raccoon.\n\nThough skunks are most commonly known for their strong musky smell, they also can cause damage to your property by digging up the lawn searching for grubs. Much like the raccoon, they are opportunistic eaters and have a varied diet. They will occasionally raid garbage, eat pet food, grubs, bugs, or anything else they deem edible. Occasionally, they will seek shelter and den under buildings, decks, and wood piles. Attacks from a skunk are very unlikely, considering their first line of defense is to spray. However, if a person or pet is bitten or comes into direct contact with the skunk, contact your local health department or veterinarian immediately. Skunks could carry and transmit rabies.\n\nPrevention and control tips\n\nRemove food sources like bird feeders and pet food and ensure that garbage is securely tucked in an animal-proof container. Put garbage out the morning of garbage pick-up rather than the night before.\n\nCheck the yard before letting your dogs out at night. Make sure there are no skunks nearby that could potentially spray your pets.\n\nIf a skunk is denning under your porch, place lattice up from the ground to the deck to keep the skunk out. You might also try placing an ammonia-soaked towel into the den opening. The unpleasant smell will draw the skunks out.\n\nSkunks will sometimes climb into window wells and find themselves unable to climb out. Place a rough board into the well and allow the skunk to climb out of the well.\n\nIf you suspect a person has been bitten by a skunk or has had direct exposure, contact your local health department. Skunks can transmit rabies to humans.\n\nIf you suspect a pet has been bitten by a skunk, contact your veterinarian. Skunks can transmit rabies to animals as well.\n\nAfter speaking with the Health Department or veterinarian, collect the skunk specimen if it is dead and take it to them to determine if an exposure is suspected. If no exposure has occurred, collect the skunk specimen if it is dead and bring it to your local DNR office to be submitted for disease testing.\n\nRemoval tips\n\nIf you find a skunk acting unusually or a dead skunk, please contact your local DNR office to submit it for disease testing.\n\nIf you live in an area where hunting or trapping is allowed, skunks may be hunted or trapped if they are doing or about to do damage on your property.\n\nIn areas where hunting and trapping is not allowed, you may contact a nuisance animal control company.\n\nThere are 18 species of snake in Michigan, only one of which is venomous. The Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake is a federally threatened species and may not be captured or harmed. Sightings of the Eastern Massasauga are very rare. There are several snake species that look similar to the Eastern Massasauga, but only the Massasauga has a segmented rattle on the tail. Most of Michigan’s snakes keep to themselves and pose little threat to humans. They will sometimes hibernate in or near homes. Snakes eat mice, insects, and earthworms and therefore, can often be beneficial to have nearby. If you find a snake outside, leave it be and let the snake move away on its own. Typically, if a snake senses your presence it will move elsewhere.\n\nTo learn more about each snake species, see our snakes page or check out our 60-Second Snake video series!\n\nPrevention and control tips:\n\nKeep your landscape tidy. Remove tarps, rocks, wood, brush piles or anything else that might provide a sunbathing spot or covered shelter for a snake. Keep your grass mowed short.\n\nKeep rodent populations under control. Sometimes snakes will hang around homes or outbuildings if mice are present.\n\nRemoval Tips:\n\nIf a snake is in a building - watch this episode of 60-Second Snakes: Snake Removal\n\nIf the snake remains in an area that is frequently used, contain the snake (as seen in the snake removal video above) and move the snake to the closest natural habitat.\n\nThere should be no barriers between where the snake was found and where it is being relocated.\n\nThe snake may be moved a maximum of 800 feet or 250 meters from where it was found.\n\nIf you are unable to move the snake yourself, contact the Wildlife Division at 517-284-9453 for a list of volunteer snake responders or permitted wildlife pest control companies to assist in moving the snake.\n\nSome species of snakes can be harvested. Please see the Fishing Guide for snake regulations."
