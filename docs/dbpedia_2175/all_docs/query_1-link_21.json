Licenses are nontransferable.\n\nHARVEST INFORMATION PROGRAM\n\nAll migratory bird hunters must register annually with the Migratory Bird Harvest Information Program in each state in which they hunt ducks, geese, swans, mergansers, coots, cranes, snipe, doves and woodcock. Hunters who do not HIP register when they buy a North Dakota license, can add it later through the Game and Fish website at gf.nd.gov. HIP registration is a cooperative program designed to determine a sample of hunters from which to measure the harvest of migratory birds for management purposes.\n\nDEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nGame - “Game” includes any of those species of small game, or furbearers as defined in Section 20.1-01-02 of the North Dakota Century Code.\n\nSmall Game - includes all game birds (including waterfowl) and tree squirrels.\n\nUpland Game - includes sharp-tailed grouse, Hungarian partridge, pheasants,ruffed grouse and tree squirrels.\n\nMigratory Game Birds - includes ducks, geese, swans, mergansers, coots, cranes, snipe, dove and woodcock. All hunters must be HIP registered.\n\nWaterfowl - includes ducks, geese, swans, mergansers and coots.\n\nDaily Bag Limit - (Daily Limit) is the maximum number of a particular game that one hunter, legally licensed by this state, may take or kill during a single hunting day, within the boundaries of this state.\n\nPossession Limit - is the maximum number of a particular game species that a hunter, legally licensed by this state, may have in his/her actual possession during any phase of any single hunting trip, venture, or expedition of more than one day. No more than one daily limit may be taken on any one day. The possession limit at one’s personal permanent residence, except for waterfowl and migratory game birds, is not limited.\n\nPossession Limit for Waterfowl and Migratory Game Birds is the maximum number of migratory game birds of a single species or a combination of species permitted to be possessed by any one person when lawfully taken in the United States in any one specified geographic area (typically a state, Indian reservation or a hunting unit or zone within a state) for which a possession limit is prescribed.\n\nMigratory Bird Preservation Facility is any person or business for hire or other consideration, taxidermist, cold storage or locker plant facility, or hunting club which receives, possesses, or has in custody any migratory game birds belonging to another for purposes of picking, cleaning, freezing, processing, storage or shipment.\n\nPossession of Shot other than Nontoxic Shot means in the gun, or in the pockets, or within reach while in the process of hunting. See nontoxic shot regulations below.\n\nCanada geese includes all Canada geese, cackling geese and any other geese except white-fronted and light geese.\n\nLight geese include snow geese, blue geese and Ross’s geese.\n\nNONTOXIC SHOT REGULATIONS\n\nThe possession or use of shot other than federally approved nontoxic shot is prohibited while hunting ducks, geese, sandhill cranes, tundra swans, mergansers, snipe and coot statewide. For a list of approved nontoxic shot, visit the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service website at fws.gov.\n\nNontoxic shot is required for all hunting on all U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lands, including federal refuges and waterfowl production areas. This regulation applies to all hunters using shotguns, except while hunting turkeys and big game. These shot requirements are in addition to current statewide nontoxic shot requirements for migratory birds as listed above.\n\nLEGAL FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION\n\nGame Birds and Waterfowl – Only firearms no smaller than .410 gauge nor larger than 10 gauge loaded with shot and capable of holding no more than three shells, legal archery equipment, and raptors may be used.

Any release aid may be used providing it is hand operated, the shooter supports the draw weight of the bow, and the release is not attached to any part of the bow other than at the bowstring. Telescopic sights, range finding devices, or other electronic devices attached to the bow, or the arrow, are not permitted (exception: battery-powered or electronically lighted sights that do not project light, lighted nocks and recording devices which do not aid in range finding, sighting or shooting the bow are permitted). Handheld range-finding devices are legal. Arrows capable of causing damage or injury in excess of that inflicted by the cutting edges of the broadhead, are prohibited while hunting small game with a bow (e.g., explosive arrow points, arrows tipped with drugs or chemicals, ND Upland Game, Migratory Game Birds and Furbearer Guide – 2024-25 Page 39 and pneumatic or hydraulic shafts are illegal). Arrows must be at least 24 inches long and have at least 2 untrimmed feathers, or not less than 5 trimmed feathers when shooting at birds in flight.\n\nBlind individuals, paraplegics and/or those having lost the use of one or both arms, having a permit from the Game and Fish director to hunt with a crossbow, may use a crossbow during small game seasons.

The entire cylinder of a revolver is considered the chamber, requiring the revolver to be completely unloaded. Handguns with removable magazines or clips must have the magazine or clips removed from the firearm if the magazine or clip contains any loaded shells. It is illegal to carry any muzzleloading firearm in or on a motor-driven vehicle with a cap or primer in place or powder in the flash pan.\n\nLandowners may be more restrictive on their own property. In general, driving off established roads and trails is not allowed on state and federal lands. For more detailed information check with the managing agency.\n\nDriving off established roads and trails on private land is legal for the hunting of waterfowl and cranes; legal for the hunting of upland game with written permission from the landowner or lessee who actively farms or ranches the land (exception: does not apply during the deer gun season); NOT legal for the hunting of big game except for retrieval of harvested big game.\n\nMallard Island and deTrobriand Island within Lake Sakakawea are closed to the use of all motor-driven vehicles and aircraft. On all other wildlife management areas owned or managed by the Department, the use of all motor-driven vehicles is restricted to those constructed roads, well worn trails, and parking areas normally used by passenger cars. Motor-driven vehicle use on wildlife management areas is further restricted or prohibited where posted as such.\n\nEstablished roads or trails do not include temporary trails made for agricultural purposes.\n\nNo person may use motor-driven vehicles on North Dakota Game and Fish Department Conservation PLOTS (Private Land Open To Sportsmen) property without permission from the landowner, or as otherwise signed by the Department. These areas have been entrusted to the public for walking access through written agreements with private landowners. The boundaries of these properties are identified by large yellow triangular signs.\n\nMotorboats are legal for going to and from hunting areas. Ducks, coots, mergansers, geese and tundra swans may be taken from a floating craft, excluding a sink box, if such craft is either beached, fastened within or tied immediately alongside any type of fixed hunting blind, or resting at anchor. It is illegal to shoot from a sunken device or any free floating vessel on open water, or to use or cause to be used any free floating battery, electric, steam, gasoline or other powered vessel in an attempt to take waterfowl. A motorboat, sailboat or other craft may be used to pick up dead or injured birds.\n\nAll watercraft must have aboard a U.S. Coast Guard approved life preserver for each occupant. Additionally, any watercraft powered by any motor (including electric motors) must be registered and numbered (licensed) through the North Dakota Game and Fish Department, or for nonresidents – through the state where principally used.\n\nIDENTIFICATION\n\nOne fully feathered wing or the fully feathered head of all waterfowl, snipe, dove, crane and woodcock; and one leg and foot, or the fully feathered head, or the fully feathered wing of pheasant, Hungarian partridge and all grouse shall remain attached to such game during transportation or shipment until it reaches the hunter’s legal residence or it is processed to be immediately consumed.\n\nTRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE\n\nLicense holders must accompany their game, or parts thereof, during transportation. Game may be shipped by common carrier in receipt of proper bill of lading. No resident of the state may ship game or parts thereof out of state without a permit from the Department. Any resident, other than a licensed furbuyer complying with Section 20.1-03-23 of the North Dakota Century Code who ships or transports such hides or furs, shall tag each hide or fur with the name of the person having taken it and that person’s furbearer license number. Except for legally gifted game, it is illegal to possess or transport another’s game animal, or parts thereof, without the license holder accompanying or as otherwise permitted.\n\nNo person shall leave or store any game birds at any place other than that person’s legal residence unless each piece of game is tagged with the owner’s signature and address, date taken, number and species of game, and license number of the person who harvested the game. The packaging of game birds away from a person’s legal residence must be in a manner that the species and number of game birds in each package is easily determined.\n\nGame may be gifted to another, however this does not allow a person to exceed a daily limit. Any gifted game to be transported must be tagged with the above information and display sex and species identification as required. Termination of possession can only be accomplished by: (1) gifting of legally harvested game; (2) by consuming the game.\n\nNonresidents may transport or ship from the state a possession limit of upland game. No one may possess in the field, transport or ship at any one time, more than a possession limit of upland game or migratory game birds. No person shall ship migratory game birds unless the package is marked on the outside with: (1) the name and address of the person sending the birds; (2) the name and address of the person to whom the birds are being sent; and (3) the number of each species contained in the package.\n\nPOSTING AND TRESPASS\n\nOnly the owner or tenant, or an individual authorized by the owner, may post land either electronically or by placing physical signs giving notice that no hunting is permitted on the land. The name of the person posting the land must appear on each physical sign in legible characters. Physical signs must be readable from the outside of the land and must be placed conspicuously not more than 880 yards (one-half mile) apart. For land entirely enclosed by a fence or other enclosure, posting of signs at or on all gates through the fence or enclosure constitutes a posting of all the enclosed land.\n\nIt is illegal to hunt on posted lands without permission from the owner or tenant. Hunting on posted land without permission can be prosecuted even if the land is not posted to the letter of the law. Trespass is a criminal violation punishable by suspension of hunting, fishing and trapping privileges for a period of at least one year.\n\nIt is illegal to hunt upon the premises of another within 440 yards (one-quarter mile) of any occupied building without the consent of the person occupying the building. This does not prohibit hunting on land owned by neighbors (private or public) even if the land is less than 440 yards (one-quarter mile) from the occupied building.\n\nAny person may enter upon legally posted land (without a firearm or bow) to recover game shot or killed on land where he/she had a lawful right to hunt. It is illegal to hunt in unharvested cereal and oilseed crops, including sprouted winter wheat, alfalfa, clover and other grasses grown for seed, without the owner’s consent.\n\nIt is illegal to deface, take down or destroy posting signs. Failure to close gates upon exit or entry is a criminal violation, punishable by forfeiture of hunting licenses.\n\nWritten permission must be secured from landowners or operators before placing or setting any traps or cable devices on private land, including PLOTS lands. The owner or operator may determine the length of time permission is granted.\n\nROAD RIGHTS-OF-WAY\n\nDo not hunt on road rights-of-way unless you are certain that they are open to public use. Most road rights-of-way are under control of the adjacent landowner and are closed to hunting when the adjacent land is posted closed to hunting.\n\nWANTON WASTE OF MIGRATORY GAME BIRDS AND UPLAND GAME\n\nNo person shall kill, cripple, waste, destroy, spoil or abandon the edible flesh of any migratory game or upland game without making a reasonable effort to retrieve the bird/animal, and retain it in his/her actual custody, at the place where taken and between that place and either (a) his or her personal permanent residence; (b) taxidermist; or (c) a common carrier. Edible flesh means the breast meat of any game bird or the hind legs and lower back of a squirrel.\n\nFIRE DANGER INDEX\n\nThe fire danger index provides an indication of wildland fire potential. Fire danger indexes are calculated considering temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover and vegetative condition, and are rated as Low, Medium, High, Very High or Extreme. Fires are more likely to occur on higher index days. Certain outdoor activities may be prohibited when a fire danger index is considered Very High or Extreme. Hunters are asked to be aware of current fire danger indexes. Updated information is available through ndresponse.gov, or from a county sheriff’s office.\n\nCLOSED OR RESTRICTED AREAS\n\nPLOTS Areas -\n\nIn accordance with N.D.C.C. 20.1-08-04.9, nonresidents may not hunt any game from October 12-18, on North Dakota Game and Fish Department wildlife management areas or on Conservation PLOTS (Private Land Open To Sportsmen) areas. Exception: Nonresidents hunting on PLOTS land they own.\n\nWildlife management areas so posted, refuges, sanctuaries, national parks and historic sites shall be closed to the hunting and trapping of all species. (Exception: small game hunting, and furbearer hunting and trapping, may be permitted at times and on those areas of federally owned refuges designated by the refuge manager.) For additional regulations on federal refuges, contact refuge headquarters.\n\nThe Minot and Grand Forks air bases are closed to hunting. Nelson Lake in Oliver County is open to waterfowl hunting under special restrictions. Waterfowl hunting will only be allowed along the north shoreline in the N 1/2 of section 32 and the northwest part of the lake in sections 29 and 30. All other parts of the lake are closed to hunting. No open water hunting from a boat is allowed. All hunting must be done from shore.\n\nSchool trust lands are open to nonvehicular public access, including hunting, unless posted with ND Department of Trust Lands signs. Trapping is allowed, if the current surface lessee gives written permission. By giving permission, the lessee is made aware that legal traps and snares could be in the area. The only established trails on Department of Trust Lands available for public use are those that are signed with Game and Fish Department trail markers. See the ND Department of Trust Lands surface and minerals management page at land.nd.gov.\n\nState law allows the governor to close or postpone a hunting season upon reasonable notice through the media if climatic conditions create a fire hazard.\n\nland.nd.gov for additional information.\n\nOTHER RESTRICTIONS\n\nAn individual must harvest his or her own limit.\n\nIt is illegal to go afield with a firearm or archery equipment while intoxicated.\n\nIt is illegal to possess or use an electronic or recorded call while hunting migratory game birds.\n\nUse of artificial light, night vision, thermal vision or infrared light for locating or hunting game is prohibited, except for beaver, raccoon, fox and coyote during the open night hunting season on the animal.\n\nHunters may retrieve game that has fallen into a state wildlife refuge if they leave their firearms outside the boundary. They may not retrieve game that has fallen into a federal wildlife refuge unless there has been a retrieving zone designated by the refuge manager.\n\nIt is illegal to shoot harmless birds. All hawks, owls, falcons and eagles are protected by state and federal law.\n\nIt is illegal to use live ducks or geese as decoys.\n\nNo person may possess or sell any live wildlife or release any wildlife into the wild without a permit from the Department.\n\nTrail cameras may not be installed on private property without written permission from the landowner, or an individual authorized by the owner, and the camera must have an equipment registration number, or the individuals name, address and telephone number.\n\nSUMMARY OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS\n\nThe following is a synopsis of federal regulations that pertain to the hunting of migratory game birds. Persons requiring more information should go to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service website at fws.gov, to find a complete version of 50 CFR Part 20, contact the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at 701-250-4418 or 701-255-0593, or a local national wildlife refuge office. Migratory birds include all migratory game birds and most birds found in the United States with the exception of the house sparrow, feral pigeon (commonly called rock dove), European starling, Eurasian collared dove, mute swan, and upland game birds, which are protected by state laws. A complete list of protected migratory birds is found in Title 50 Code of Federal Regulations, Section. 10.13.\n\nDaily bag limit means the maximum number of migratory game birds of single species or combination (aggregate) of species permitted to be taken by one person in any one day during the open season in any one specified geographic area (typically a hunting unit or zone) for which a daily bag limit is prescribed. Aggregate daily bag limit means the maximum number of migratory game birds permitted to be taken by one person in any one day during the open season when such person hunts in more than one specified geographic area and/or for more than one species for which a combined daily bag limit is prescribed. The aggregate daily bag limit is equal to, but shall not exceed, the largest daily bag limit prescribed for any one species or for any one specified geographic area (typically a second state, Indian reservation, hunting unit or zone within a state) in which taking occurs.\n\nOpening day of a season – No person on the opening day of the season shall possess any freshly killed migratory game birds in excess of the daily bag limit, or aggregate daily bag limit, whichever applies.\n\nField possession limit – No person shall possess, have in custody, or transport more than the daily bag limit or aggregate daily bag limit, whichever applies, of migratory game birds, tagged or not tagged, at or between the place where taken and either (a) his/her automobile or principal means of land transportation; or (b) his/her personal abode or temporary or transient place of lodging; or (c) a migratory bird preservation facility; or (d) a post office; or (e) a common carrier facility.\n\nAggregate possession limit means the maximum number of migratory game birds of a single species or combination of species taken in the United States permitted to be possessed by any one person when taking and possession occurs in more than one specified geographic area (typically a second state, Indian reservation, hunting unit or zone with a state) for which a possession limit is prescribed. The aggregate possession limit is equal to, but shall not exceed, the largest possession limit prescribed for any one of the species or specified geographic areas in which taking and possession occurs.\n\nPersonal abode means one’s principal or ordinary home or dwelling place, as distinguished from one’s temporary or transient place of abode or dwelling such as a hunting club, or any club house, cabin, tent or trailer house used as a hunting club, or any hotel, motel or rooming house used during a hunting, pleasure or business trip.\n\nNo person shall take migratory game birds:\n\nWith a trap, snare, net, rifle, pistol, swivel gun, shotgun larger than 10 gauge, punt gun, battery gun, machine gun, fish hook, poison, drug, explosive, or stupefying substance; with a shotgun of any description capable of holding more than three shells, unless it is plugged with a one-piece filler, incapable of removal without disassembling the gun, so its total capacity does not exceed three shells.\n\nFrom or by means, aid, or use of any motor vehicle, motor-driven land conveyance, or aircraft of any kind, except that paraplegics and persons missing one or both legs may take birds from any stationary motor vehicle or stationary motor-driven land conveyance.\n\nBy the use or aid of live birds as decoys; although not limited to, it shall be a violation for any person to take migratory waterfowl on an area where tame or captive live ducks or geese are present unless such birds are and have been for a period of 10 consecutive days prior to such taking, confined within an enclosure which substantially reduces the audibility of their calls and totally conceals such birds from the sight of wild migratory waterfowl.\n\nBy the aid of baiting, or on or over any baited area, where a person knows or reasonably should know that the area is or has been baited. Baiting means the direct or indirect placing, exposing, depositing, distributing, or scattering of salt, grain, or other feed that could serve as a lure or attraction for migratory game birds to, on or over any areas where hunters are attempting to take them.\n\nHUNTING BY NONTRIBAL MEMBERS ON NORTH DAKOTA INDIAN RESERVATIONS\n\nIf an individual hunts exclusively on Indian lands within an Indian reservation, a tribal license is required and a state hunting license is not required. Hunting on nontribal lands within an Indian reservation requires a state hunting license. Game taken legally with a tribal license within an Indian reservation may be possessed and transported anywhere in North Dakota.\n\nPortions of some units/zones are located on Indian reservations. Contact reservation tribal offices for more information:\n\nFort Berthold. Game and Fish Department, 404 Frontage Road, New Town, ND 58763, 701-627-4760.\n\nStanding Rock.
