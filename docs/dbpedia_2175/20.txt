Seagulls are one of the skittish birds in ATLAS.

Basic Information[ | ]

Behavior[ | ]

Seagulls are neutral, and will not attack other creatures unless attacked first. When one Seagull is harmed, others nearby will join the onslaught against the aggressor.

Domestication[ | ]

Utility[ | ]

Seagulls provide a swim speed bonus. Each level-up you give your seagull will usually add 0.4% additional swim-speed bonus while approximately every fourth level will add 0.5%. This applies no matter which stat you level up.

Taming[ | ]

This creature is tamed by lowering its health to 20% then Bola-entrapping it. Have Prime Fish Meat (best) or Fish Meat in last slot to hand feed. Will take multiple Bolas in order to finally tame.

Breeding[ | ]

You can breed Seagulls in the following biomes: Eastern Tropics Windy, Western Temperate Windy, Eastern Temperate Windy and Western Tropics Windy. Acceptable temperatures for mating and offspring are between 16-34°C (61-93°F) (not accurate, discuss). Your newborn Seagull will be ready for you to claim it after 55 minutes and you will need to keep the egg extra warm until then, between 33-44°C (91-111°F).

Feeding Baby[]

It will eat from its inventory one Fish Meat (or similar food) about every 30-45 seconds. A newborn can only carry enough weight to hold a few units of food so you won't be able leave for very long between feedings. Once it can hold more, each full stack should give you x hours and x minutes away from baby. Tested with berries, non-Vit A source, and it works fine too if chili's aren't available.

About x hours and x minutes after the baby is born, the maturation meter will reach 10% and the baby will become a juvenile. After that point, the young Seagull will better handle temperature swings and it will be able to eat from a Feeding Trough, allowing you to leave it alone for longer periods of time.

Keeping Baby Comfortable[]

When possible, arrange to raise the baby someplace that won't stay too far above its comfortable temperature range for too much of the day. It is easier to heat an area than it is to cool it, so keep that in mind when setting up your nursery for each species you breed.

To keep the baby warm enough, have plenty of Wood Wall Hooks with Torches in them mounted around the floors and walls in the fully enclosed area where you will be raising the baby. Maybe also install a Lever set to the same PIN as the hooks so you can trigger them all at once if you like. This will help you keep your young pets alive during any cold spells.

If you need to cool the area, you will need to use Ice Boxes. To power them, you will need to have visited a frigid region ahead of time and stockpiled enough Ice to keep the boxes active until the heatwave passes.

Imprinting[]

Beyond the initial imprint when you claimed your newborn, you can also gain a very useful imprint bonus by cuddling with your new friend. The cuddle timer ("Wants Care In" timer) is eight hours. Cuddling or taking a walk with it as soon as possible each time the timer elapses will increase your new Seagull's stats.

Notes On Timing[]

Successfully raising a high-imprint offspring—or even just keeping your new buddy alive at all—can take quite a bit of time and good scheduling. So here is a rundown of the relevant times to be mindful of:

Mating time: 2 minutes

Gestation Time: 5 hours 45 Minutes

Baby feeding every 1 min 50 seconds

cuddle interval: 8 hours

0.1% maturation = 143 seconds

on OFFICIAL Servers: to 10% approx 4 hrs

Combat[ | ]

Seagulls can be easily killed with a few slashes from a spear or sword. It is not recommended to hunt them with bows while they are in the air, as they will easily dodge your arrows.
