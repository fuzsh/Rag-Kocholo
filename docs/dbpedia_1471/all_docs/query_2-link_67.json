        "text": "JANUARY 29, 2018\n\nOfficially launched as Major League Soccerâs 25th Club set to begin play in March 2020. âToday is a proud day for Miami, and for our family,â said Managing Owner and CEO Jorge Mas. âOur club will have a global vision but our fans in South Florida will always be our first priority reflecting the best of our community.â Inter Miami CF is a hyperglobal -yet local- team that represents our fans and our city. We are fan-centered and fan-driven Club and we want to create a passion for soccer in our city. We are one, we are fearless, we are ready.\n\nSEPTEMBER 5, 2018\n\nInter Miami CF officially announced the name, crest, and colors of the club. âThis is such a proud day for myself and for the entire team. Itâs an honor to announce the new name and crest to our fans,â said David Beckham, Inter Miami Owner. âWe are taking another important step in establishing our club and today marks an important moment in the history of Club Internacional de FÃºtbol Miami.â âOur city and our fans draw their strength from the dreams of a global population that calls Miami home,â said Inter Miami Managing Owner Jorge Mas. âIt is only fitting that our name pays tribute to the inclusiveness that makes us who we are.â\n\nAUGUST 22, 2020\n\nInter Miami CF earned the first victory in Club history with a 3-2 win over Orlando City SC in its first match at Inter Miami CF Stadium â now Chase Stadium. It was Inter Miami who struck first on its home field when JuliÃ¡n Carranza, Argentine forward, scored his first goal for the Club in the 12th minute. This marked the first MLS goal scored at Inter Miami CF Stadium â now Chase Stadium.\n\nDECEMBER 18, 2020\n\nInter Miami CF signed 15-year-old Felipe Valencia as a Homegrown Player, marking the first Academy product in club history to sign with the First Team. Valencia was the youngest Academy player to play for Fort Lauderdale CF â now Inter Miami CF II â in 2020 and the\n\nyoungest to score a goal at any USL level. At the time, he was also the 15th youngest player to sign a contract in MLS history.\n\nJANUARY 18, 2020\n\nClub has appointed Chris Henderson as Chief Soccer Officer (CSO) and Sporting Director to lead the strategic vision of the Club. Henderson will manage soccer operations and on-field developments, from the First Team to the youth levels.\n\nâThis is an incredible opportunity for me to take the next step in my career, return back to South Florida and solidify my mark on this league,â said Inter Miami CF Chief Soccer Officer and Sporting Director Chris Henderson. âI have always believed in the Inter Miami project and the Clubâs ability to become a powerhouse not only in MLS but across the global soccer industry.\"\n\nAPRIL 9, 2021\n\nAutoNation became the official and exclusive automotive partner of Inter Miami CF, which includes naming rights of the stadium and branding on the First Team training kits. This partnership amplifies AutoNation and Inter Miamiâs commitment to driving out cancer by\n\nleveraging the power of fÃºtbol to do good. Starting in April 2021, Inter Miami kicked off its second campaign in Major League Soccer at the newly named DRV PNK Stadium in support of AutoNationâs DRV PNK initiative.\n\nAPRIL 8, 2021\n\nInter Miami CF announced that it appointed Xavier Asensi as Chief Business Officer. Asensi, 39,Â joins Inter Miami after 10 years with FC Barcelona, where he most recently served as Chief Commercial Officer and was a member of the FC Barcelona Executive Board. âXavi brings a proven record of success at one of the worldâs greatest clubs,â said Inter Miami CF Managing Owner Jorge Mas. âHis vision will further drive the growth of our Club and support our local and commercial partnerships.â âI am grateful for the trust and support Jorge Mas and David Beckham have given me, and I am very motivated and excited to begin this new journey in SouthÂ Florida. I am a huge fan of the United States and I believe that there is no better time to be part of the soccer industry in this country alongside a young organization with a world ofÂ opportunities ahead,â said newly appointed Chief Business Officer Xavier Asensi. âIâve beenÂ very impressed with what Iâve seen so far and look forward to working with the team to establishÂ a clear direction and strategy to achieve our goals.â\n\nJune 8, 2021\n\nPlastic pollution is a significant issue for the world, especially with regards to the ocean. The issue must be at the forefront of mind at all times to not only ensure continued awareness of, but also to remember that it is up to us to be part of the solution. With this in mind, Inter Miami launched its adidas Primeblue jersey made with Parley Ocean Plastic in collaboration with MajorÂ League Soccer ahead of World Oceans Day on June 8, becoming the first team in history to ever launch a jersey fully underwater.\n\nWednesday, Sept. 15\n\nInter Miami unveiled XBTO, a prominent, global cryptofinance firm, as the first-ever Primary Jersey Sponsor for South Floridaâs Major League Soccer (MLS) Club. The deal between Inter Miami and XBTO marks the first cryptofinance partnership in MLS.\n\nInter Miami players, Club co-owners and prominent members of the Miami tech community participated in the special event to discuss the partnership and the many benefits of the booming crypto industry.\n\nFEBRUARY 19, 2022\n\nInspired by and designed for the fans of Inter Miami CF â the true heartbeat of the team â the kit is the first all-pink jersey in club history. On the cuff of the jersey sleeves and on the jock tag, theÂ fans are represented by an M-shaped line embossed into the fabric. Illustrating how the fans are the heartbeat of the club, the M is designed like a line from an electrocardiogram (EKG). In an additional design touch reflecting the true spirit between the club and its supporters, there is an inscription on the back of the neck of jersey that reads âLibertad Para SoÃ±arâ (Freedom to Dream). The design and font utilized are from a tattoo of IMCF Owner and President of Soccer\n\nOperations David Beckham. The words were originally scripted in the handwriting of BeckhamâsÂ close friend â the global superstar singer, songwriter, recording executive and actor Marc Anthony.\n\nMAY 26, 2022\n\nInter Miami CF returned to the Cayman Islands to build on its 2021 campaign to capture the launch of its second Primeblue jersey âEveryone at the club was excited to work with Jason, Coral, adidas and MLS again on such an important initiative as reducing plastic pollution in the Ocean. This year, we really wanted to find a way to highlight that when the Oceans are clear of plastic, marine life will repopulate and ultimately flourish, which is critical to a healthyÂ ecosystem.â â Inter Miami CF SVP, Brand and Marketing, Mike Ridley\n\nJUNE 14, 2022\n\nApple and Major League Soccer announced that the Apple TV app will be the exclusive destination to watch every single live MLS match beginning in 2023. This partnership is a historic first for a major professional sports league and will allow fans around the world to watchÂ all MLS, Leagues Cup, and select MLS NEXT Pro and MLS NEXT matches in one place -- without any local broadcast blackouts or the need for a traditional pay TV bundle.\n\nSEPTEMBER 12, 2022\n\nInter Miami CF announced a major, multi-year partnership with Florida Blue. The stateâs Blue Cross Blue Shield plan joins Inter Miami as the Clubâs Official Community Partner and secures the naming rights for the state-of-the-art, $60-million training facility in Fort Lauderdale, now the Florida Blue Training Center. Continuing a trend of aligning with local, like-minded brands, this relationship is rooted in a desire to strengthen the local community and further Inter MiamiâsÂ mission to harness the power of fÃºtbol to do good.\n\nAPRIL 18, 2023\n\nFor the third edition of the campaign, Coral Cay and Cayman Jason went to the Bahamas to release this yearâs One Planet Jersey underwater next to a Great Hammerhead Shark to promote responsible plastic use and the positive impact it can have on our ocean habitat. \"The One Planet initiative is special to our Club. This year we wanted to complete the trilogy with Jason and Coral alongside the oceanâs apex predator as a symbol of a healthy ecosystem, which is the ultimate goal of One Planet. Weâre grateful for adidas and MLS for continuing to work with us towards that goal,â said Mike Ridley, Inter Miami CF SVP of Brand and Marketing.\"\n\nJUNE 28, 2023\n\nInter Miami CF announced that its named the MLS Cup winner, two-time manager at a FIFA World Cup, three-time Conmebol Copa AmÃ©rica finalist, Concacaf Gold Cup winner and former FC Barcelona and Argentina National Team manager Gerardo âTataâ Martino as head coach. âIâmÂ very excited to join a big club like Inter Miami and I know together we can accomplish many great things,â said incoming Inter Miami CF head coach Martino. âThe Club has the necessary infrastructure to be a major competitor in the region and I believe that with everyoneâs hard workÂ and commitment we can get there.â\n\nJULY 15, 2023\n\nInter Miami CF today announced the signing of seven-time Ballon dâOr winner and World Cup Champion, Lionel Messi.\n\nâI am honored to welcome Leo Messi and his family to their new home,â said Inter Miami CF Managing Owner, Jorge Mas. âIn 2018, we made a promise to build an ambitious club that would attract the worldâs elite players. A club that would transform the global view of fÃºtbol in the United States and ensure that wherever fÃºtbol is discussed, your Inter Miami is part of the conversation. A heartfelt thank you to our fans that never stopped believing. Together we will continue to turn dreams into reality.â\n\nJULY 16, 2023\n\nInter Miami CF announced today that it has signed World Cup champion and nine-time LaLiga winner Sergio Busquets.\n\nâThis is a special and exciting opportunity that Iâm very excited to take.

He has proven for over a decade that he is one of the best fullbacks in the sport due to both his defensive solidity and capacity to contribute in the attack. We know that heâll help Inter Miami achieve the Clubâs objectives this season and beyond,â said Chief Soccer Director and Sporting Director Chris Henderson.\n\nAUGUST 19, 2023\n\nInter Miami CFÂ achieved another major milestone for the Club on Saturday night, making history by defeating Nashville SC at GEODIS Park in a dramatic penalty shootout to win the 2023 Leagues Cup title and clinch the First Teamâs first official piece of silverware.
