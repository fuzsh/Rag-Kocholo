He signed for side Lyon in 2008 before signing for Roma in 2011 after three seasons at Lyon.

Pjanić has since been considered an integral player for Juventus, winning two Serie A's and Coppa Italia's, and being named in the Serie A Team of the Year for 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18 seasons. He was also named in the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League Squad of the Season, for his role in Juventus's run to the final.A former Luxembourgish youth international, Pjanić made his senior international debut for Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2008, earning over 80 caps and scoring 13 goals since.
