        "text": "The Luxembourg national football team have competed in most qualifying campaigns for the Fifa World Cup, apart from the 1930 edition, and the Uefa European Championship, apart from the 1960 edition, only to have never featured in any tournament proper. With a population of just 600,000, Luxembourg does not have a large playing pool to select from, but have recorded some surprising results in their history. Their first victory as a footballing nation saw them defeat France in 1914, when they ran out 5-4 winners. In recent years, they have defeated Hungary and also drew with France, now a footballing superpower, and with each positive result comes widespread national news coverage. Jeff Strasser has the most caps for his nation, while Leon Mart has scored the most goals."
