        "text": "Introduction\n\nHey everyone! Been looking for a new save while rewatching \"Sunderland Til I die\". I realized how tough it was on those managers as they were really at the whim of the director of football. They could give suggestions, but really it was up to the DoF to reel in the talent. So that is what we are doing. We are starting in a custom Luxembourgish database. In the top flight, the Luxembourg National Division, with semi-professional outfit US Hostert.\n\nUnion Sportive Hostert\n\nThey were at risk of being relegated last season, but with that kind of youth recruitment we may have a pipeline of talent that even the director of football can't miss on.\n\nBoard Vision\n\nThe big push will be to stay up this season. Unfortunately, most of the financial and contract goals will be out of our hands. Also we have a one year \"earn your keep\" contract.\n\nFirst Team\n\nOur team is in rough states, with only 4 maybe 5 players predicted by the staff to be of top flight quality. Whereas only 4 of the starting 11 are signed on for multiple seasons.\n\nHalim Meddour\n\nOur best player is Meddour, a 26 year old ball playing defender. Unfortunately, with only one season under contract. We need to capitalize on his talents now and hopefully prevent his injury proneness from creeping up. Thank goodness his has traits of big matches and consistency as we will need both.\n\nMedia Prediction\n\nWe are predicted for a 19th place finish. This league is just like the premier league. So 38 games, with the bottom 3 clubs being relegated. We have no key players in the media dream eleven. There is gonna be a long road ahead. I will be updating this roughly every in game month, but with the team decisions not up to me it may be a little chaotic, but that's the fun part.\n\nBest of luck in your own saves.\n\nEdited March 19 by DrChristopher\n\nJuly 2023\n\nA good preseason is in the books. As well as our director of football pulling off some great contract extensions/transfers.\n\nTransfers\n\nAll on a free so luckily nothing too outlandish finance-wise yet.\n\nDimitrije Jovanovic\n\nWe do have a new highest earner at the club though. A Serbian mezzala from KVC Westerlo in the Jupiter Pro League. He is young only 20 years old with a three-year contract. He needs some help in dribbling, anticipation, and composure, but could be a real stalwart for the side for the next couple seasons.\n\nKenan Avdusinovic\n\nKenan actually came through the Hostert youth system, but immediately left for other teams in Luxembourg. He has played at the top flight of the National Division for the last 5 seasons for various sides. Most recently released by reigning champions Swift Hesperange, after not getting any playing time last season. He comes to us on a free with a sweetheart one year contract. Hopefully a good performance might help him resign and re-earn a starting role in a top flight side. He has the physicals that will make him a terror on the right. Lets see if that home town quality shows through.\n\nMohamed Konate\n\nOur last acquisition is Konate, a stone wall at the back. A teenager, 19 year old Malian, who was out of professional football last year. He played most recently for RE Virton in the Challenger Pro League in Belgium. We have some untested new faces, and I am anxious to see if they have what it takes to excel at this level.\n\nNext up is our first official game in charge away against projected 6th place Titus Petange. Then we take on some of Luxembourg's heaviest hitters.\n\nThanks for anyone following along, and best of luck in your own saves!\n\nAugust 2023\n\n5 games in and it is a mixed bag. Two big wins at home, but we have struggled away. I think all three losses were fairly unlucky as we really could be 2 wins, 2 draws, 1 loss right now in my opion. However, two unfortunate penalty giveaways find us in 12th place on 6 points.\n\nTransfers\n\nOn the other hand the director of football has been busy.\n\n1. Martin is a 22 year old French left wingback that has been out of football for a year, but likely comes in as our starting left back.\n\n2. Mendy is an absolute travesty. Left sided 25 year old Senegalese player who comes in as the 31st best player on the team with a crazy prize tag of $475 a week for two seasons! I put him immediately on the unwanted and developmental lists. Unfortunately we don't have the money to release him, so we will likely have to wait till the winter window to force him out of the side. Thankfully he comes in as an emergency backup.\n\n3. Djogou is a 21 year old Togolese defensive midfielder. He has great upside but is only of decent Division of Honour (second flight Luxembourgish) quality right now. That being said he is the first name off the bench as he can play any role in our midfield 4-3-3 DM Wide. Unfortunately he is part of a new trend of giving incoming players one-year deals. Hopefully we can have great form in the winter window to resign these good talents for a longer period of time.\n\n4. Our best find coming out of our recruitment scouting meeting. That was Saudi Arabian keeper Abdulaziz Edrees. He is a 3.5 star CA 5 star PA 22 year old we stole on a free from NK Uljanik Pula in the fourth tier of Croatia. He is an immediate number 1 between the sticks. He is also on a very secure 3-year deal but unfortunately is making $675 a week which is a huge price tag for our side. (It appears if I throw a great player on the transfer targets list and give them the parameters to go get them. I may have to deal with them occasionally throwing the bag at these players.)\n\n5. Schmit is a 16 year old striker free transfer from Berdenia in the Division of Honour. He is probably never gonna make the first team as he is currently our 8th best striker with the potential to someday be our 3rd/4th best. As long as we primarily play a single striker formation he will likely stay in the reserves or out of loan.\n\n6. Cetkovic was a interesting prospect from Lentgen in the First Division South (3rd tier of Luxembourg). At 16 years old he can play as a wingback on either wing. He is just outside the top 3 on either side already but is currently in the under 18s. Unfortunately with only 3 stars of potential he may never be more than an utility player at the senior level.\n\n7. Last is Lefel a real-world transfer set already in the database. He comes in as the second best keeper, but was pre-arranged by the database to leave in January. So he will really just be here as the 3rd keeper backup.\n\nBy the way we will be covering the pipelines/depth at different positions starting after the transfer window closes.\n\nFinances\n\nSo where does that leave us? Actually in a fairly healthy spot. We have a decent amount of budget left, but we need to get the direct of football on contract extensions first before he gets a chance to give away bad contracts in the winter window.\n\nNational League\n\nSo far we are flying free of the relegation spots, but it is fairly early days, and we need more than home form to keep us safe long-term.\n\nXg Table\n\nAs you can see our possession focused tactics are helping us with expected goals, and therefore our expected points should have given us a much better table position. So I think if we can maintain this form eventually the table will start falling our way.\n\nNext game is against lowly Racing FC Luxembourg at home before a tough second round tie against fellow division foes FC Etzella Ettelbruck later this upcoming month.\n\nThanks to everyone for following along. Best of luck in your own saves.\n\nCheers!\n\nEdited March 23 by DrChristopher\n\nSeptember 2023\n\n5 more games as boss here and the form has started to slip. We are no longer impenetrable at home and we have fallen to 14th in the league. On the bright side the DoF has worked miracles re-signing team key player Meddour to a two-year contract with an optional one-year extension for just $275 a week.\n\nGoalkeepers\n\nAs far as keepers go the pipeline looks like this.\n\n1st is Edrees the starter with only 8 conceded in 7 starts. He hasn't hit his stride yet, but has been holding to league average stats-wise. Which is what his quality is so par for the course with potential in spades.\n\nLeaving in January - Enzo Lefel would have been nice to hang on to but the database has already secured his move away from Stade Jos Becker,\n\n2nd is Fabio Sebastiani a five year team vet that never played in the top flight except in garbage games. He has also secured a two year contract with a optional extension. Meaning he will likely be a long-term fixture with the team as long as he doesn't resent us for playing second fiddle.\n\n3rd is Theo Sardou on loan from Red Black in the 3rd division of Luxembourg. Not sure how that works exactly, but he is on loan to us for the season. Luckily he is free and will be a nice depth coverage while we pair down our 40 plus player roster across all three levels.\n\n4th is Nico Gomes a youth prospect with a outside chance of being a Division of Honour keeper one day. My hope is we don't stoop so low to ever need his services.\n\nAbdulaziz Edrees\n\nWe are attempting to repair that first touch as early as humanly possible, but their is nothing I can do about his fear of big matches. Hopefully that means the other 30 games of the season he plays like the guy we hope he can be.\n\nFabio Sebastiani\n\nThe first touch disease is an epidemic in our team it seems. Hopefully someone will find the gonads to step up in big games.\n\nCompetitions\n\nNext up we face Etzella in the second leg of our second round cup tie. Then we face two top 6 projected sides. Luckily we finish of the month with a winnable home match against fellow relegation candidates Fola Esch. Now would be a great time to pick up our form and throw as many teams beneath us in the standings in order to insulate us from a relegation battle.\n\nThanks to anyone following along. Best of luck in your own saves.\n\nLet's go lads time to get stuck in!\n\nOctober 2023\n\nWe got knocked out immediately in the cup. Hopefully that means we can focus on the league. Not that we have even remotely struggled with fixture congestion thus far. We continue to have no heart away from home, but two big wins keeps us 8 points above the drop, and just 4 points from the European places.\n\nNational Division Table\n\nWe still continue to have league best expected goals and expected points. So I am still cautiously optimistic that our form will slowly turn.\n\nDefenders (Right)\n\nOne point that we might need to address in the future is our depth at rightback.\n\n1st is Loris a three year team starter with some potential left in the tank. Unfortunately being semi-professional seems to also have slowed his development. He has been playing admirably for his skill set though and at a bargain price.\n\n2nd is Koljen a hometown prospect with 12 seasons of time at the club across his career. He will never be better than Division of Honour quality, but right now I can't argue with $15 a week salary.\n\n3rd is Duah he may be a marginal top flight quality player someday, but right now he is doing well in the reserves. Averaging a 7.06 rating in 8 matches. He is also on a sweet deal. Hopefully he will resign to give us cover next season as well.\n\n4th is Bozidar how can play on the right and left side. He is thriving in the U18s averaging a 7.19 rating with 6 assists and 3 player of the match performances in 16 games played. If we get the chance to upgrade in other places he may take Duah's spot as 3rd string coverage in the fullback positions.\n\n5th is Wiltgen. He can play across the back line, but most staff thinks he is 1 to 1.5 star PA. So I think I will be looking to move him on at the earliest opportunity.\n\nLoris Bernardy\n\nI was initially very worried about his injury proneness as we don't have great depth at this position. However he was done well, and been nearly a lock on the team sheet.\n\nDemir Koljenovic\n\nKoljen also struggles to dribble, but luckily our short passing system hides that hole most of the time. Can our director of football find us some help?\n\nNext up is a slow month with only 3 matches. Hopefully we can solidify some contracts past this season in the meantime. Next up we play away against FC Marisca Mersch above us in the table. They have a bigger piggy bank than most of the teams at this level and they are the only professional team in Luxembourg.\n\nMy aim is to have 4 points from the next 3 matches.\n\nThanks for following along and best of luck in your own saves.\n\nLet's go Hostert!\n\nNovember 2023\n\nAn injury to two starters in the attack, has lead to some inconsistent scoring this month. We play the entire mid-table this month pretty much. So these are big ticket six-pointers. However, with our 'stuck in' tactics we have both starting center backs suspended and both attacking players still out. We are in for a rough month if some fellas can't step up.\n\nLuxembourg National Division\n\nWe are still hanging out mid-table, but the margins are slowly getting bigger between us and the European spots as well as us and the relegation spots.\n\nDefenders (Center)\n\nCenterbacks initially look like they have good depth, but after the starters we are very thin.\n\n1st is Meddour, a leading national division defender, with a 6.91 average rating. Interceptions and blocks per 90 are on the upper end of league average. As well as a league high in progressive passes per 90 and pass completion percentage. He really is our ideal ball playing defender at this level.\n\n2nd is Konate also playing with the first teamers. Top third in the league in clearances, interceptions, and blocks per 90. With a 92% pass completion percentage. Great potential, so it appears we have our starting backs set for the next season and a half.\n\n3rd is Dedenon first name off the bench for defenders especially since he has the ability to play leftback. Most of the coaches feel he will be equivalent to Meddour one day. We got him under contract for 2 and a half seasons.\n\n4th is Koljen, the old man we spoke about last month. He is what you see is what you get. Currently in the bottom half of the leagues defenders in most stats. Despite a 6.9 rating in 2 starts and 2 sub appearances in the league. He is cheap though he will most likely be a end of season decision on whether I push the DoF to resign him.\n\n5th/6th is Fabio and Schmitt both are never gonna be fit for this level and we likely be releasing them if we get enough transfer budget to make that happen. The wage room is shrinking with resignees. So we got to pair down the roster to get some better talent next season.\n\nHalim Meddour\n\nOur vice captain and soon to be captain come next season. He has been good. Super consistent and always a lock in big games, but he can't do it alone. Unfortunately the accumulation of yellow cards has caught up to him and he'll be suspended next game at home against Rosport.\n\nMohamed Konate\n\nA good national division player with eye on being leading quality in maybe 2 seasons time. He has good core attributes, just needs a little growth everywhere is make our back line formidable. However, with the decent prize and TV money in this league he may have to grow soon or fall down the pecking order.\n\nGeneral Performance\n\nAs you can see we are doing well by the numbers. We are struggling to get shots on target though. He are dominating in the shots per game category, if we capitalize on that volume I think we are gonna start turning these draws into wins.\n\nSurprise Free Transfer\n\nThe director of football has remained busy finding a former VfL Wolfsburg youth prospect on a free. He immediately comes in as one of our starting Mezzalas in the midfield 3. Great speed, I think he could be a real nightmare for opposing sides once he settles in. Our transfers once had us projected as high as 15th in the media predictions for the league, but the rest of the league has been busy and we have drifted back down to 17th in those predictions.\n\n5 games upcoming next month. I want 9 points. I also want to identify some young talent we can turn our DoF on to hopefully filling up the bottom of the depth charts and keeping him busy on quality acquisitions.\n\nBy the way I never showed our current Director of Football for reference here is the unpredictable Dylan Pinheiro.\n\nBest of luck in your own saves.\n\nLets go Lads!\n\nEdited March 26 by DrChristopher\n\nDecember 2023\n\nSchedule\n\nWe were a force this month. 5 wins in 5. Leapfrogging to 6th place in the league table just 3 points from an European place.\n\nLuxembourg National Division\n\nWhile we had some guys out our backup striker Deniz Muric had an inspired run then once we were back to full strength we never let up until we made the mid-table sides seem foolish. Our biggest problem now is we have no money for scouting in the winter window, and most options seem out of our price range. We may have to wait for 5 or 6 contracts to drop off our payroll next season before we can reasonably expect the director of football to sign anyone of consequence. Hopefully he doesn't get too zealous. Can we send him on vacation for the transfer window?\n\nDefender (Left)\n\nAs for our leftback situation it is as follows.\n\n1st is Martin our starter and a stable face in defense. He also gives us depth with his ability to play center back. In fact he is probably better there, but luckily he has thrived out on the left. Re-signed for a sort of big contract, but somehow the director of football negotiated a 1-year optional extension. So, we got him locked up for 2.5 more seasons.\n\n2nd is Zilli a former 3-year starter on our team, but he has become the first backup this season. 16 games played so far, but they are almost entirely off the bench. We have him signed for one more year, but his double hernia in October opened the door for competition behind him. Hopefully he can remain healthy.\n\n3rd is Dedenon a great versatile option just a step behind Zilli. In fact I would not be surprised to have him in the backup role by half way through next season. Already having played 23 games for the senior team during the last two seasons. Hopefully his determination can be enough to help him keep pace with Martin in growth as they age.\n\n4th is Mendy the only one without a contract for next year. Too expensive! He has never played once for the senior team. He is wanted as a contingency loan option for three lower divisional teams in France. So most likely we will still have to wait till season's end to get rid of him.\n\n5th is Bozidar a 16 year old who will likely never be national division quality. Hopefully we can find someone down the pyramid willing to take him on a free. Every time we clear 2 or 3 guys on minimum contracts. We free up a squad player like salary. So bit by bit we are shaping this team.\n\nLucas Martin\n\nA big 6'2\" defender who really hates to use his right foot. Flying high in the league with his tackles per 90. I'm still shocked he hasn't earned a national division quality badge from the staff as he has got to be at least leading quality in the second division. Just goes to show how good we are playing with players that are still below par.\n\nQuentin Zilli\n\nThe speed is the biggest bonus off the bench, but that is about the extent of it. Next season will really show us if he deserves to stay.\n\nSquad View\n\nSince we are at the halfway point I wanted to give you a look at the current starting 11. Some highlights include our two strikers M'Barki and Muric with a combined 15 goals scored. As well as midfielders Dzafo, Walther, and Djogou (not pictured) who are all are nearly averaging a 7 rating with 13 goals created between them. Also positively most players are in fairly good form, happiness, and morale.\n\nNext month we play the top of table. We might have a real shot at staying in the top half if we can win a game or two here, or we may find ourselves just as quickly back in the mid-table.\n\nBest of luck in your own saves.\n\nCheers lads!\n\nJanuary 2024\n\nSchedule\n\n25 out of 27 possible points over the last two months. Putting us within a game of the European spots.\n\nLuxembourg National Division\n\nM'Barki had a hattrick against Titus but went down with a sprained knee ligament until mid February. On the upside we now have 9 players officially of top flight quality. I don't think we are gonna be able to rise any higher in the table though as we starting to luck our against good teams playing us with bad lineups because so far most of the teams at this level are still in the cup.\n\nJanuary Transfer Window\n\nPinheiro our DoF went a little crazy this window. He brought in 9 players (1 was pre-arranged via real-world database). 3 of which I immediate put on the unwanted list. Our director of football has taken to signing any young players to non-contracts too. Which is tough as if we do get guys of substance they could be stolen away just as easily. On the upside the bad ones aren't clogging the wage bill. The good ones are as follows...\n\nDonovan Bonet\n\nProbably our strongest player on the bench, but at that age he is just a expensive depth option.\n\nHugo Wolf\n\nThe final real-world transfer by the database. On loan from Titus in our division. He came in as regular starter role, but agreed to backup. He is our second best keeper behind Edrees, but we have single game weeks for the remainder of the season. So barring injury he will just sit on the bench. If that potential goes up maybe he can be a transfer target.\n\nDuarte Oliveira\n\nBrought to us from an intermediary. We needed rightback depth and Oliveira was brought in on a great price for a 1.5 year loan from Famalicao in the Portuguese Premier Division. If we have the shot to make that deal permanent we should as it would make him home grown. Especially since other Luxembourgish sides were trying to steal away our starting right back this window.\n\nMohamed Loua\n\nLoua can play anywhere in the midfield. A permanent transfer from Belgian semi-pro side RE Virton. He immediately joins the starting lineup and is under contract for 2.5 more seasons. A skill or two in each attribute would make him a stalwart guy at this level.\n\nAll in all not too rough of a transfer window. Unfortunately we have no scouting budget still so we end up flying a little blind on trying to direct the DoF on who to bring in. Hopefully in a month or two we can ask for the director to renegotiate the young guys with potential on to part-time contracts.\n\nNext up we play some teams in vastly different form. We will see if this causes us to let off the gas.\n\nBest of luck in your own saves!\n\nLet's go lads!\n\nFebruary 2024\n\nSchedule\n\nWe continue to win except a draw against the former 1st place team at the time Progres.\n\nLuxembourg National Division\n\nWe have continued to rise up the league table flying as high as 2nd. If we stay top 3 we guarantee European play next season.\n\nLate Winter Transfers\n\nOur director of football had one final day of crazy transfers this window. Many were perennial reserve players that won't ever be more than cover but we had one big out and one potentially big in.\n\nDiego Matos\n\nComing in is a left wingback from US Reisdorf 47 in the third tier of luxembourgish football. Diego, at 16 years old, looks like he could be great one day. Unfortunately when he hits 17 he goes to a non-contract agreement. We need to do whatever we can to renegotiate that deal. He comes in as our record biggest signing in club history with a massive $1,300 fee, lol.\n\nLoris Bernardy\n\nOf course now that we finally had some right back depth in the side the big professional team Marisca Mersch came in for Bernardy our starting right back for $19,000 that could rise to $24,500. (Another team record high this time in transfer fee received.)\n\nSquad View\n\nThis is the starting 11 as it stands. Agovic has been really impress off the bench in M'Barki's absence. Unfortunately as you can see we asked the DoF is resign Federspiel, and all he did is just gave him a new better non-contract. Hopefully he grows in skill and demands we have to give him a part-time contract next time.\n\nUpcoming Transfers\n\nLuckily we have been busy preparing for refilling the ranks next season. Securing 4 squad level players with only $500 a week spent.\n\nNext up is a game away against 6th place FC Differdange 03. There are 10 games to go in the season. We will have a really good idea of where we stand at the end of this month.\n\nBest of luck in your own saves.\n\nCheers!\n\nMarch 2024\n\nSchedule\n\n4 wins in 4 games earning us the top spot with a point on Titus Petange in 2nd. Currently we are a lock for at least 9th place.\n\nLuxembourg National Division\n\nM'Barki is doing his damnest to go out with a bang with the highest average rating in the league. 6 games to go. All of our remaining opponents are in the bottom half of the league table. We are not a good big game team though so we need to continue to ease the tensions off the players going down the stretch.\n\nYouth Intake\n\nThe head of youth development is delusional no one is over a 2 star potential, but this is a golden generation?! I voted that no one get a contract from the youth intake.\n\nDefensive Midfielders\n\nThe defensive midfielder pipeline looks like this.\n\n1st is Loua, he is the best of the bunch with the ability to be a leading national division player. He hasn't been with us long but is an anchor at the back with plenty of years under contract.\n\n2nd is Djogou who is on an incredible contract with a 1 year contract extension. He has played almost half the season coming of the bench in the league and is doing fair with a 6.93 average rating.\n\n3rd is Maquart is on a great deal, but is also done at season's end. He has been a fringe guy with us the last three seasons. He is averaging a 7.47 for the first team with 3 assists in 3 surprising appearances in the league.\n\n4th is Grun and is being released at season's end too. He is playing decently for the reserves though getting them 5th in the reserve league this season.\n\nWe need some depth here and the best way to do that is to get someone better than anyone we have.\n\nMohamed Loua\n\nLoua was a great find by the director, and if we could push to go professional his growth could get the lift it needs during this last growth window.\n\nWilliam Djogou\n\nDjogou has similar potential as Loua, but is a step or two behind in current ability. He also has not taken the progressive steps in ability since the he arrived.\n\nBig month with the chance to secure us some serious accolades if we can hold firm.\n\nBest of luck in your own saves!\n\nCheers!\n\nApril 2024\n\nSchedule\n\nWe are 5 points clear of Titus in 2nd. With 2 games to go we are trying everything in our power to make the players forget that these are big games.\n\nLuxembourg National Division\n\nWe are super over-preforming, but just like Claudio Ranieri we are finally willing to accept we might have a shot to go and win this thing. Some Champions League money would definitely help us going forward.\n\nCentral Midfielders\n\nOur central midfielders are both Mezzalas and this is the look of the pipeline going forward.\n\n1st is Jovan, 21 years young and plenty of contract left. He is wanted by big money Marisca. 15 goals created with an impressive 7.05 average rating in the league. He has probably the best potential in the team.\n\n2nd is Dzafo another decent foreigner with a great contract. He is great for a team trying to stay clear of relegation, but he will slowly fall behind if we attempt to improve the side.\n\n3rd is Djogou. He is in a similar boat. Nice depth, but hopefully he will be a utility rather than a necessity next season.\n\n4th is Thibault enjoying his last month or two at the club. Hopefully he is signed up by a team in the lower division.\n\n5th is Tchantchou a little more expensive then I would like, but still only good enough to be a leading Division of Honour (2nd level of the Luxembourgish Pyramid) player in the future. Hopefully we won't need him for his full contract.\n\n6th is Pruvot, young with some years of growth in front of him, but most of the staff see him as never better than Djogou.\n\nOverall, 4 players signed on for next year. Would love someone better than all of them in order to starting to build our depth.\n\nDimitrije Jovanovic\n\nBalanced all around with great passing and tackling he has been a joy to watch. If he continues to grows he definitely will be a starter for the next several seasons. If not I hope we can at least get 30-50 thousand in fees for him.\n\nAbdullah Dzafo\n\n16 goals created in 36 league appearances. He has been ever present for the side. He has a couple holes in his game, but his ability to cover out on the left as been incredibly helpful. Especially with our small wage bill.\n\nI'm rushing to the finish line. I'm so excited to see if we can actually do this.\n\nA win against Kaerjeng and we are champions.\n\nBest of luck to anyone else in a battle to end the season.\n\nCheers!\n\nMay 2024: End of Season One\n\nSchedule\n\nWe did it! 4 points gave us a title win going into the last game of the season. We are champions of Luxembourg in our first season. 200 - 1 odds and a 17th place prediction from the media be damned.\n\nLuxembourg National Division\n\nI'm just baffled at M'Barki's form to finish the season and Edrees's clean sheets had us at the top of the pyramid. With a 50 goal differential no less! We didn't get the kind of reputation boost we dreamed but I think the sides will start playing a lot more guys behind the ball against us going forward. We will also find ourselves in the Super Cup and Champions League next season. We need to try to secure some prize money and make the push to go professional.\n\nSquad View\n\nI wanted to try out this new squad view. Sorted by appearances. Some highlights include...\n\nM'Barki with 21 goals in 29 appearances. 7.33 average rating with only 14.99 XG. Clinical. Unfortunately he is retiring after this season.\n\nDzafo with 10 assists playing nearly ever match this season at 39 appearances.\n\nZilli with 3.28 interceptions per 90. Just insidious off the bench.\n\nMeddour our best player still after all the transfers is 0.37 key tackles per 90. Glad to have him for two more seasons.\n\nAward Winners\n\nTop Flight Player of the Year\n\nThe old man rides off into the sunset with the MVP and the league championship.\n\nManager of the Year\n\nThe board is thrilled, I am signed on for another year.\n\nNational Division Best XI\n\n5 of our players also graced the Best XI. Still none in the media dream 11, but we perform well.\n\nRetirees\n\nAll three retirees want to be staff, Let me know if any of them seem like a good pickup. I really only control the coaching staff, but I don't mind seeing if we can convince the board to sign some club favorites.\n\nKoljen is not gonna be joining us though as he may have knowledge, but not great ability.\n\nBonet is interesting though. He could help us secure some favorable loan outs.\n\nFinances\n\nWe got a decent increase in the budgets. Our leading wage earner is $35,000 a year. So this could mean perhaps three players we might be able to purchase to slot right into the starting eleven. Unfortunately we had to expand to Europe scouting-wise as the pickings in Luxembourg were all prospects at best and we weren't the big fishes in that pond.\n\nWe are looking forward to what the new season brings. I think with our attentions split we will struggle to defend our title.\n\nTactic\n\nLast but not least the tactic we have to thank for our great run to end the season is GYR's Thanos tactic. We tried to tweak a few things over time, and this was what be felt most comfortable with. Primarily I would do my tweaking via personalized instructions during subs or at half-time. I liked the framework and shape it got our side into. Also prior to the upcoming transfer window this is likely our current starting XI.\n\nBest of luck in your own saves!\n\nCheers!\n\nJune 2024: Season 2\n\nSchedule\n\nOne more game of preseason before we enter the Champions Path First Qualifying Round. I think this is as winnable a tie as we could hope for.\n\nCompetitions\n\nThe board still think fairly low of us. So we are gonna push for the best results in Europe and the Super Cup. Hopefully we can come away with a half a million in prize money for those two competitions. They may secure us professional football next year.\n\nTransfers\n\nAll the free transfers have arrived. They include the following...\n\nHe comes in from Sydney Olympic in Australia for a club highest earning wage. He is worth it though as an immediate media dream best XI player.\n\nNext is a 22 year old Cameroonian inside forward on the right. A little expensive with some bad traits, but not a bad find for the director of football.\n\nNext was a great all around defender in from Walferdange in the division below. He averaged a 6.88 in 33 appearances in the league last season. He should gain Luxembourgish citizenship by October.\n\nHerr was a squad player for divisional side Schifflange last season and will tentatively come in as our number 9.\n\nAnother star from the 2nd division is Reihle. Can play anywhere in defense. He averaged a 6.72 in 32 appearance for Jeunesse in the Division of Honour.\n\nLastly is a Liberian prospect at 18 years old. He has good potential and if we can bring him along he could be homegrown for us. He comes in after a great season in the Liberian second division. I really got to stay on top of the director of football as we need more homegrown talent if we hope to have the numbers to compete in Europe.\n\nSquad View\n\nThis is our new current best XI. Teah needs to be on a part time contract, but I need to wait a little while before I can ask the DoF to re-negotiate.\n\nFinances\n\nAll the other bad non-contract players have been resigned to part time deals. So the wage bill stands at about what i expect going forward. Most teams have not been able to resign there players so we have flown up to 5th in the media predictions, but as players start to resign I expect that to drift back down to 6th to 10th.\n\nAlso thanks to our work with our DoF (who the board resigned) we only have 7 contracts expiring at the end of this season rather than the 20+ we had to deal with last season.\n\nWish us luck as we try to get the bag in Europe.\n\nThanks for following along, and best of luck in your own saves.\n\nCheers!\n\nJuly 2024\n\nSchedule\n\nGood start away from home getting the win against Shkendija, eased up at home, but held on to a win that put us into the second qualifying round. Where we faced a tough draw against FK Astana of Kazakhstan. Our away form was still good, but we allowed just too many goals at home to have a good shot in the second leg. So now we have been put into the Europa League Champions Path Third Qualifying round. It doesn't say if we lose here if we still get a chance to play in the Europa Conference League. So our goal is to win our draw against Estonian Champions FC Flora Tallinn. 8 matches next month will be the most brtual test of depth we have ever had thus far. Luckily we have a full 30 man strong roster we can now utilize. 17 of our players now as thought to be of National Division quality.\n\nCompetitions\n\nThe only question now is will these depth players be able to show the quality we need not to drop points in the league.\n\nTransfers\n\nMeanwhile the director of football has been bringing in guys like we have unlimited money cheats on. Luckily all were brought in on free transfers.\n\nFirst is our new starting left back. Or should I say our former starting left back. Our old youth talent Schmit has returned to the club. He was playing in Germany playing for regional German side Buchbach. Good physicals and national division quality. Guess he liked what he saw from his old side, and we were able to capitalize on his homesickness.\n\nNext is Dutch youngster Rosina he has gallons of potential. Hopefully he will sign an actual contract in the near future as he is non-contract right now. He will probably stay as cover until January then we'll try to loan him out in the winter window. (If he will resign as part-time.)\n\nNext Austrian phenom Busche. He has great key attributes. Can play in two of the attacking roles we need cover for and is only 16 years old. I don't know what kind of magic the DoF was able to pull off, but he comes in as the first name off the bench for the second best eleven. (Probably 10 appearances for the senior team this season is a likely number.)\n\nAnother Dutch player this time a volatile brave 6'2\" center back. Only 17 years old he will most likely be sent out on loan in Luxembourg if we can find him something.\n\nJust went I though the director of football was done. He bought us in even more center back depth with an even younger driven Belgian. Nys is gonna get some time off the bench in the league or in the auxiliary cup competitions. Mentally he is good, but I could really use some growth in the physical department. He might be a good No-Nonsense sub late in some games. (5-10 appearance likely this season for the senior team.)\n\nLast was a decent upgrade over our current keeping talent. Kips is national talent that has spent some time playing in Germany throughout the football pyramid there. He is good, but Jesus does his first touch terrify me. I full expect a howler or two this season.\n\nFinances\n\nThe wages are still reasonable but with another month of transfer window I just pray the DoF leaves room to resign all this talent. Perhaps I should busy him with those tasks now while I can.\n\nNext up is our third qualifying round match away. Can we get a good result to take into the home tie, and earn us a group stage appearance?\n\nThanks for following along. Best of luck in your own saves!\n\nCheers!\n\nAugust 2024\n\nSchedule\n\nWe did it boys a convincing double win against Flora then a tough draw against PAOK sends us to the Europa Conference Group/League Phase. We immediately win 3 million in prize money and ask the board to let us go professional. The jury is still out, but we have to make sure the money doesn't go to our heads. All the other Luxembourg teams were knocked out in the first rounds. Teams like Swift Hesperange that was used to European money are in rough financial states.\n\nCompetitions\n\nThe media has us predicted to finish 12th despite our signings and improvement. None of our players are media dream best XI anymore either. So there is no guarantee we can win another title. We got to slow roll this financial windfall into staying-power.\n\nTransfers In\n\nOur director of football has thankfully got the hint. He only brought in one player and at a position of need as well. Teixeira is on loan from UNA Strassen where he started for them all last season. He won't start for us, but as long as were in Europe we will need his services in the congested schedule ahead.\n\nTransfers Out\n\nUnfortunate out was last year's initial spark plug off the bench when M'Barki went down. Definitely was not good enough for us anymore, and was sinking to 3rd on the depth chart. He moved on a free non-contract transfer to Atert who won the Division of Honour title last season and promoted to our division. 1 goal in 2 appearances says he still has some life in those legs. Would have preferred to see him stay through till January to cover the upcoming fixtures, but we are gonna have to start trusting the youngsters sometime.\n\nSquad View\n\nThis is how the starting XI is shaping up. Kips picked up a (8-14 day) injury, but should be back soon. Meanwhile we haven't dropped any points in the league so we really thrived on all fronts this month.\n\nNext month is gonna be just as hectic as we immediately play 3 road games and our super cup matchup to end the month.\n\nAnybody have a favorite player so far? Mine is Oliveira, my best find I think of last season. We have him through this season, if we could extend him in any way he would be homegrown soon. I even think he has an outside chance of making the Luxembourg national team if he continues to improve. He is quite expensive though and without the ability to force through his extension ourselves we will most likely have to watch him go next summer.\n\nAnyway that wraps up this month. Best luck in your own saves.\n\nLet's go lads!\n\nSeptember 2024\n\nWe win our first piece of hardware this season with a super cup win against Titus. We kept falling being, but we stayed true and got the win via Kenan in the 89th minute.\n\nSchedule\n\nWe dropped a couple points this month in the league, and Mondorf are making us pay as they are flying high early. Getting out to a 6 point lead on us in the table. However, we are the only team to make them look human.\n\nCompetitions\n\n8 matches this month is really going to make us lean into our team depth. I imagine we are gonna struggle to catch up to Mondorf at all if by midseason that point gap becomes 9-12 points.\n\nAttacking Right Midfielder\n\nOur right attacking midfield pipeline looks like this.\n\n1st is Bieleu who is undoubtedly our number starter at the position with 7.27 average rating. 7 assists and 3 goals in 11 appearances. 1.95 open play key passes per 90 in the league is in the top 10% in the league. He has helped us a lot in Europe. (Which has been his main venue.) Once we are out of those competitions I can't wait to see him tear up the league.\n\n2nd is Kenan finally officially national division quality, but is probably as good as he is gonna get. Amazingly he is averaging 2.47 open play key passes per 90 which is 2nd in the league. He is clearly a step behind Bieleu, but his contribution in the Super Cup makes us hesitant to let him drift further down the pecking order. That speed has really served us well. I imagine he has 20 more appearances this season to make his mark.\n\n3rd is Luca our third string AMR. He has yet to make an appearance in the senior side this season. He made 8 appearance for us in the league last season, but so far is averaging a 7.15 in 4 appearances in the reserves, helping them to a current 6th place spot in the reserve division. We currently have him out on the transfer list as he wants a big wage increase, and at 24 I don't think he can ever become top flight quality.\n\n4th is Fernandes, another option currently on the transfer list. He has been with us for 2 seasons and has never made a first team appearance. Which I think says it all. We have money now, but not enough to keep guys that don't play. Not on a huge contract, but hopefully we can help him move on this coming transfer window.\n\n5th is Felizardo. He is interesting he doesn't have a ton of upside but he is currently lighting it up in the U18s with a 7.19 average rating 7 assists and 1 goal in 10 starts. He is currently stuck on a non contract so we may or may not push to have the DoF sign him to a proper contract if he continues to show good development.\n\n6th is Paravicini who probably will never be a first teamer, but as a fellow American he has a youth \"prove it\" contract that we will most likely be letting go when it terminates.\n\nBenjamin Bieleu\n\nJust 22 years old with room to grow. Unfortunately he is part of the trend of big games cowards and injury prone footballers we have at the club. Luckily he has played well and stayed in good health. Also thankful to have him signed for the next 2 seasons.\n\nKenan Avdusinovic\n\nKenan has been a great servant of the club the last season and a half. He has shown a little regression hopefully he can hang with us as we grow, but if we fail to get back in the Champions league... I don't think we have the quality yet to fight our way through Europa conference league qualifying to get back into a big group stage with that much needed prize money.\n\nBoard: Club Vision\n\nOn a positive note the board have officially agreed to let us go professional that will kick in next season.\n\nNext up is a second round cup draw against Bastendorf from the 3rd tier of Luxembourg football. Then immediately we head away to Georgian side Samgurali Tskhaltubo in the Europa Conference League stage.\n\nThanks for following along, and best of luck in your own saves.\n\nCheers!\n\nOctober 2024\n\nSchedule\n\nA mixed month. We started off with a bad first leg against Bastendorf but sealed the tie with a win at home. A great win away in Georgia versus Samgurali, but lost a surprising winnable contest at home versus Partizen, which we should have had no business being in. Unfortunately Mondorf has not stumbled in the slightest, meanwhile we dropped points in our game against relegation candidates Mondercange, at home no less.\n\nCompetitions\n\nWe are starting to make this a two horse race in the league. but there is a lot of season left to play. We only have 6 games this month. With how packed our fixture list has been this is a nice reprieve.\n\nAttacking Left Midfielders\n\nLets take a look at our AML depth...\n\n1st is Walther an inspired signing and find by the DoF. He hasn't set the world on fire yet this season, but he has held his own on the left, right, and in midfield whenever called upon. Plus that is usually against vastly better sides in Europe. We are little worried about his step back development-wise, but with the professional training coming next season I hope he will have a resurgence in attributes.\n\n2nd is Agovic our former starting attacker that was one of the top scorers for the club last season. 12 appearance for the club thus far this season, and a 6.92 average rating in the league ensures that he is still a common name off the bench. His striker skills have shone through though as he is in the top third of the league in shots on target per 90.\n\n3rd is Amehi who has been with us for 3 years. He is approaching his ceiling in my opinion. Most of staff feels he will always be only leading Division of Honour quality at best. He was a starter back in 22-23, but has slowly drifted to the 3rd string side getting 10 appearance or so a season. He is here for another year and a half. We will mostly have his replacement in by that time.\n\n4th is Fernandes also can play on both wings, but he is just too far away from the first team to get a chance here. Wanted by FC Tricolore Gasperich in Luxembourg's third division though so perhaps he will get a chance at an offer or two in January.\n\n5th is Mendy still expensive and absolutely refuses to sign for anyone. He has turned down at least 4 offers on the contract table to transfer to another side. He isn't even playing well for the reserves. Just a bad signing we are still paying for.\n\n6th is Paravicini as we said before he has the versatility to make us let him play out his youth contract, but most likely not destined for a long stay at the club.\n\nGil-Linnart Walther\n\nGreat find for this level. I think playing him into form, a good run in training, and we will be as high on him as ever. Especially at only 21 years old.\n\nKevin Agovic\n\nMr. Consistent, playing well in spite of the big match skittishness. Happily signed with us for the next 2 and a half seasons. That first touch has really been a god sent when coming in off the bench in Europe.\n\nOur next match is away in the league against Fola Esch. Followed by Maccabi in the Coference League. Wish us luck as we try to stay within striking distance of Mondorf at the top of the table.\n\nBest of luck in your own saves.\n\nCheers!\n\nNovember 2024\n\nSchedule\n\nThe epitome of mixed results this month. Mondorf have finally dropped a few points, but we have not been able to capitalize. We have a game in hand, with a UNA Strassen double header and 8 matchdays this month hopefully we can claim the top of the table thus resecuring the clubs future. (Also known as potential European prize money.)\n\nCompetitions\n\n5 league games this month and I think 13 points is the goal. We have struggled with taking our foot off the gas coming off the highs and lows of Europe but we won't get many more chances to pull ahead of the pack. Also by the end of this month I hope we will definitely be on to the 4th round of the national cup, but also maybe stealing a win from FK Sutjeska Nikšić of Montenegro. As FK Bodø/Glimt are most likely winning the league phase so unless they hilarious rotate in their U18s... Sutjeska is our only shot at the knockout stage.\n\nStrikers\n\nWhat does our forward depth look like?\n\n1st is Herr, 5 goals in 6 starts in the league. He is less consistent across all competitions, but still 0.6 non-penalty expected goals per 90 minutes. Making him the fourth most scoring efficiency forward in the National division. 23 years old. 1.5 year contract. Barring big incoming fees we can't fight off, he will be with us for some time.\n\n2nd is Maximilian, easily the biggest potential talent we have at the club. I still don't understand how we could sign him prior to 18 years old. Regardless he already has tremendous athleticism plus when we go professional next season we can make full use of his developmental age window.\n\n3rd is Bah who is another good talent and is thankfully homegrown in nation. My biggest worry is the lack of first team football. He is the best 3rd striker option making him tough to let out on loan. Especially while still in 3 competitions, but he is averaging a 7.6 rating in the reserves and needs to play in full senior fixtures. Unfortunately the DoF is signing everyone to star player contracts so rotation is becoming impossible. Perhaps if we were in fairly good secure form by January he could go out on loan for the second half of the season.\n\n4th is Hoffman currently transfer listed as hopefully someone thinks he can still reach his potential. I doubt it though. He has not grown with us. Only 3rd tier Luxembourgish quality with poor skills like 2 stamina, 4 balance, and 3 passing. I think he has a career further down the league pyramid but we have seen enough to feel confident in selling/releasing him this next off-season. He might be a loan farm guy if we want to try that out, but we aren't Mr. Moneybags yet.\n\nTeo Herr\n\nAs big of an inspiration Herr has been, he still is on the edge of the first team. I mean that to say is he is our third lowest CA starter in the first XI. Therefore it feels like the DoF uses that as the matrix for what first team positions to look for in the transfer market. So, development and form will be his best tools to preserving his first team spot.\n\nMaximilian Busche\n\nStill a step behind as a backup, only being Division of Honour standard. He has the right key attributes, and at this level physicals are still king.\n\nThanks to everyone for continuing to follow along. Best of luck in your own saves.\n\nLook forward to updating you as we finish our European campaign.\n\nLet's go lads!\n\nDecember 2024\n\nSchedule\n\n11 points in the league wasn't a bad showing. The real kick in the teeth was that we actually managed to beat Sutjeska. Only to lose 0-3 to Bodo/Glimt leaving us one goal differential shy of a knockout spot... Brutal.\n\nUEFA Europa Conference League\n\nWe deserved at least one goal from that match, but fate was cruel and thus I think we actually will go from 4 European sides to 3 sides next season as we apparently had a good 2019 campaign in Luxembourg, but that goes away and we will fall down a few spots as we have our highest coefficient points in 4 years, but 0.5 points less than 2019 so... Rough.\n\nLuxembourg National Division\n\nThe silver-lining is we managed to claim the top spot in the league. Mondorf went on a just suicidal run of form for the former league leaders (1-point from 4 games and 3 points in 6 games). We now hold our own destiny in our hands as we cross the half-way mark of the season. This slows the pace of fixtures as well, and will allow us to send a good chunk of the first team out on loan and bring in some fresh faces as the January window opens.\n\nTransfers\n\nFirst off incoming is the club's new out and out best player, English 21 year old Micah Hamilton. He arrives on a free after being released by Manchester City... MANCHESTER CITY! He is quality and isn't even the team's highest paid player. He immediately became part of the media dream 11, and sent us from predicted 12th place finish to 6th.\n\nNext was another player for the future. 16 year old defender and former amateur talent from the Netherlands, Arno. Good find and good contract. He probably wont play this year, but he could be one to watch out for.\n\nSquad View\n\nThe next section I wanted to show how the senior side was playing. The first image shows the starters, and the second a look at the backups at each position.\n\nStarting XI\n\nHamilton leads the way. Herr and Konate are now the squad guys that get subbed for occasionally. Teah was starting for a majority of the last two months, but with his versatility he is more often a super sub and spot start.\n\nSecond XI\n\nTeah leads the way for the second team. Edrees has really fallen down the ranks despite not playing badly. Loua was in the first XI for a period of the season, but injuries lost him the starting job. Nys is a really exciting prospect, but Nsanzimana's and Reihle's versatility really has the third string defenders struggling to find playing time. All told the 3rd teamers maybe received 54 appearances total across all competitions with the senior team. So maybe 4-5 appearances per player. Each probably also have ~10 appearances with the reserves to maintain sharpness. Enough to get us excited, but hopefully most can get a winter loan deal and get 10-15 more senior team competitive matches before season's end. (I feel like I read somewhere an ideal match load over the age of 18 to maintain progression is ~30 matches a season. If we can't fulfill that for the prospects we may have to go to a smaller roster next season rather than the full 33 man roster we had this season for the senior team.\n\nSummary\n\nWe briefly eclipsed the 5 mil bank balance mark. I'm anxious for the months to tick by so I can request more infrastructure upgrades. Professional status is coming. Youth facility upgrade is planned. Next is youth recruitment if I can convince the board.\n\nAs you can see we are still being hounded by playing time dynamic issues. Nevertheless we are on to the 4th round of the cup against Fola Esch, and it looks like with a few suspensions and an injury we might have a statement first leg game at home. The board are pleased. However, the only hold out to a A+ rating seems to be the board expectation of one more round win in the Luxembourg Cup. So, fingers crossed.\n\nThanks for following along. I hope this update highlighted some things a little better. As always if there is some different screens you would like to see feel free to let me know.\n\nBest of luck in your own saves.\n\nCheers!\n\nJanuary 2025: Winter Window\n\nSchedule\n\nAn undefeated January has moved us forward in the cup, but necessarily in the league.\n\nCompetitions\n\nThe top 4 are hanging with us. We play two in them this month, both at home. With 14 more games to go this season, it would be nice to be comfortably ahead by March or April. (Man we hate big games, don't make me try to do those pre-game team meetings.)\n\nTransfers\n\nWe managed to send the DoF on a chase of prospects again. With 6 players brought in 18 years of age or younger. The most impress one of the lot is...\n\nEric comes in immediately as our 3rd best right back in the senior team. Nevertheless we still won't get a chance to see him until next season. He comes in on a free from German divisional side Zehlendorf. First touch, dribbling, and crossing are really his only deficiencies. Hopefully he can become something here.\n\nDevelopment Center\n\nWith us now only in two competitions. We loaned out a majority of the 3rd teamers. Best of which was 24 year old Dedenon who is starting for Division of honour side Medernach, currently battling for the promotion playoff. I think that says all we need to know about our depth that no one went to a top flight team. (Only the top 17 players in our team are considered top flight quality despite two top of the table season performances from the lads.)\n\nClub Overview\n\nAs said professional status for the club will go into affect this summer. As well as an upgrade to the youth facilities. The board also raised the junior coaching budget. Next off-season I intend to push for training facilities upgrades. Not a bad win percentage as manager too.\n\nSummary\n\nLots to go over on this screenshot. Our general performance is great we dominate on both sides of the ball. Most impressive is our crossing, but our movement and passing are good too. We are a little under our expected goals, but that is FM sometimes.\n\nMost interesting is news of a potential takeover. Probably nothing but something of note.\n\nI hope you guys have enjoyed following along. Best of luck in your own saves.\n\nLets go and make the league sides fear us getting knocked out of Europe!\n\nCheers!\n\nFebruary 2025\n\nSchedule\n\nWe hit a tough patch mid month. Many players were demanding to play every game, but then were putting in bad performances because they were extremely tired. Furthermore only half of those players agreed to rest. (If anyone is experiencing this try to get at least a fortnight of agreed rest as these players will be right back to demanding playing time the day the rest promise is lifted.)\n\nCompetitions\n\nProgres surprised us but we have managed to still keep a healthy gap between us and Differdange in 2nd place. We are also in to the semi-finals of the domestic cup against 8th place Jeunesse Esch. Both sides could use a European cash injection, and are playing head games constantly make comments in the media about how we are overachieving.\n\nKeepers\n\nThis month we are covering the keeper pipeline\n\n1st is Kips. Leading the league in clean sheets despite only playing 18 of the 28 games in the league thus far. Also passing accuracy is 95%. Things are a little rockier in Europe, but a 6.84 average rating across all competitions is solid.\n\n2nd is Edrees. Edrees is leading the league with his array of passing with the ball at his feet. Also he has 33 saves in 13 appearances across all competitions. I'm really hoping we can get him a few more appearances before the end of this campaign.\n\n3rd is tied between Fabio and Omar. Omar is the new kid 16 years old brought in on a free from SC Eltersdorf in the German lower divisions. So far so good in the U18s with 12 conceded in 12 appearances and an average rating of 6.89 with 4 clean sheets. That has helped the youngsters grab 1st place in the youth top flight with 8 games to go.\n\nFabio on the other hand has been a victim of our success. He has been with us for 6 of the last 7 seasons. Yet he hasn't had more than 4 starts in any of the last 4 seasons. He certainly is no longer good enough for our level and thus will probably have to be moved on next season. Unfortunately he fairly contend to stay. So we may have to unsettle him in order to get him out.\n\nFirst Choice\n\nStill only maybe a top 5 keeper in this league. Kips has played well, but I don't know how much better he will get. Therefore our staff assessment is he is outstanding at this level, but he probably wont carry us any higher in Europe.\n\nSecond Choice\n\nSaudi Arabian with still a lot of potential. Edrees has shown flashes, but he needs to keep developing. He has regressed in physicals over his stay with us, and has had minimal growth elsewhere. He should be eligible for Luxembourg citizenship at the beginning of next season. Perhaps a half year loan would help jump start his development next season.\n\nLuxembourg National Division\n\nWe are projected to finish anywhere from 1st to 14th now in the league. We have rotated so heavily we don't have a lot of league leaders in the side. Nonetheless we are outpacing anyone else in the league in expected goals by team by at least 20 goals. Non-penalty expected goals per 90 is 2.32 and the second closest is FC Swift Hesperange at 1.69 per 90.\n\nQuiet next month with only 4 games, all in the league. Now is the time to go 4 for 4, claim 12 points, and put any chance of other teams catching us to bed. Our biggest tie will be 3rd place FC Alisontia Steinsel at home mid month. Let's go lads!\n\nThanks to everyone for following along, best of luck in your own saves.\n\nMarch 2025\n\nSchedule\n\nFinally we start to close the door on the competition. We can no longer mathematically finish lower than 6th. 6 games to go in the league and a 8 point gap on 2nd. Unfortunately, I think Rodange is definitely going down. Maybe we should look into an affiliate club further down in the pyramid.\n\nLuxembourg National Division\n\nAmazingly the potential takeover talks have not ceased since I think just prior to the winter transfer window. The administration may be in chaos but the dynamics have mellowed out and the team is much more even keel.\n\nDefenders on the Right\n\nWe got a lot of right backs and potential right backs at the club, lets go through them. (Let me know if everyone would like to see all the available right backs or just those natural or starting at that position.)\n\n1st Oliveira hands down. His loan ends this year. Hopefully we can set up an extension. I just wish he wasn't so expensive so we could get him in permanently.\n\n2nd is Nsanzimana who is luckily our best skilled player off the bench. Which is good if we lose Duarte this will give us good cover until we can address the hole in the side.\n\n3rd is Almeida. Reihle could play there, but he is better suited as a center back. Almeida was brought in on a free from FC Hertha 03 Zehlendorf in the German lower divisions. Only 16 years old, he has good potential and is already 2nd tier quality. He has only played in 4 games for the reserves, but has already put in 3 key tackles, 4 key passes, and winning nearly 5 headers a game with a 7.05 average rating. He will be 16 for a while yet, but when he turns 17 he will be out immediately to a Division of Honour side I have no doubt.\n\n4th is Federspiel currently on loan in the 3rd division with FC Erpeldange 72. So far they have not kept their promises, failing to play him even once. Prior to that he was tearing it up in the reserves with a 7.40 average rating in 7 appearances for the side. His speed is just second to none. I don't know how he gets into the senior side long term as he just doesn't have the potential of Almeida, Nys, or Moller. We will just have to wait and see how he progresses next season.\n\n5th is Rudy Duah but he has been on the transfer list for a while now and will be released at the earliest opportunity. Ie. right after he returns from his poor showing in the third division with FC Jeunesse Gilsdorf.\n\nFirst Choice\n\nWe would love to have him back especially with his great dribbles made per 90, and his league leading 0.56 crosses completed per 90 from the wingback spot.\n\nSecond Choice\n\nNsan is a little older, and has struggled to develop. He has played super often with 40 appearances for the first team, but that is mainly due to him being able to play anywhere across the back four and put in a good shift. He is one of the best in the division across all defenders with 2.41 tackles per 90, and 7.58 progressive passes per 90. Glad to have him on the books for another two seasons.\n\nSummary\n\nHere is a summary overview of the team. Next up is our first leg against Jeunesse Esch in the semi-final of the Luxembourg Cup.\n\n2 more months to go and 8-9 games depending on our cup performance. I think we can start to push for the treble this year.\n\nThanks to anyone following along, and best of luck in your own saves.\n\nCheers!\n\nApril 2025\n\nChampions\n\nWe did it! We have done the double. Winning the league with 3 games to spare. We immediately were allowed to go professional and were given a new contract. Also many of the players got resigned to full-time contracts, but that hiked the wages quite a bit.\n\nSchedule\n\nWe also came back in a magnificent second leg at home in the Semis to beat Jeunesse and progress to the domestic cup finals!\n\nLuxembourg Cup\n\nWe face 10th place in the league, US Rumelange, in one game \"winner takes all\". $85,000 to the winner. Not that we need it, but I would not mind making the hall of fame winning a treble.\n\nLuxembourg National Division\n\n2 games to go. Hopefully the top guys don't get too upset if I rotate the side a little bit. At the end we were projected an 8th place finish and have won the league back to back.\n\nBoard Vision\n\nBig budgets also released by the board. They are increasing our wage by 50%. Now we just got to hope that the DoF doesn't give out too many bad contracts. Furthermore Dylan Pinheiro has been resigned as our director of football for one more year, but his skills have not grown. So we might have to replace him next year. If it gets too crazy, we might have to lay down the law and demand more control of the business side. So far I like my small responsibility pool though.\n\nContract Struggles\n\nThe struggle is the contract situation. 9 major contracts in the starting eleven are most likely gonna demand a big wage increase with the new profile of the club. For instance Jovanovic has already got his big wage increase, and I was hoping for the 50 grand level to be more of an exemption rather than the rule. (Remember FC Swift Hesperange were starting to get used to champions league money, and after not making it for two seasons they are 1.21 mil in debt. We don't want to be the next cautionary tale.)\n\nMaybe I should put it all in the scouting budget to hid the wage? Anyway wish us luck as we finish off this season. Thanks for following along, best of luck in your own saves.\n\nCheers!\n\nEdited April 19 by DrChristopher\n\nMay 2025\n\nTreble Winners!\n\nWe did it lads! All the silverware we could hope for domestically. 2.34 goals per game. -8.04 underperforming expected goals per game. We generated so many chances we should have done better lol. 44 more chances created then any team in the league. I'm super proud of this team. Unfortunately we are still only top 8 by media prediction and next year they expect a top 4 finish and to compete for either the Luxembourg Cup or the Super Cup. So we have to work just as hard and we have way less wiggle room.\n\nEnd of Season: Schedule\n\nWe finished the season with only 1 lose since the end of February. As well as only 2 dropped points in that time as well (11 league games, nearly a third of the season).\n\nHistory\n\nWe are masters of Luxembourg. Now that we are top dogs we got to defend it. We finally made the favoured personnel list on our club page. As well as signed another contract this time we seemed to have earned a two-year deal through the 26/27 season.\n\nTeam Report\n\nI have never since it so succinctly put then in this team report. The current squad of players is .... slightly below average in the national division, and one of the weakest in Europe. I liked Konate in the midfield, but the assistants have him off the bench.\n\nFirst Team\n\nOliveira did so much, interceptions, assists, and even goals. He will be missed. He has refused to come back. Our striker to always the main goal scorer in this tactic. Loua chipped in woth a strong showing too, but he was penalty taker for the second team, and first midfield name off the bench. Walther needs to chill out though as I will not be giving him this much playing time next season. Bieleu and Jovanovic were the stars though. Each with 25 goals contributions, and only 22 years old.\n\nSecond Team\n\nLoua and Teah were invaluable and present all season long. Busche was really impressive in the first half of the season. Avdusinovic is probably finished his last regular season for us. Especially if Busche makes the jump or Teah moves over from left inside forward.\n\nThird Team\n\nOnly limited appearances around in the third string, but we have some potential highlights. Rosina I think could make progress if he gets playing time somewhere. Zilli still holding in there. He and Fabio are most likely gonna find new homes in the winter window. Almeida is exciting but nothing of note yet.\n\nGreat season. Now a big off-season where we have to try to reign in the spends of the DoF. Scouting budget money hiding and budget manipulation may be our best way forward.\n\nThanks for following along, best of luck in your own saves.\n\nCheers!\n\nEdited April 20 by DrChristopher\n\nJune 2025\n\nFacilities are starting to creep up. Still waiting to hear back from the board on upgrade to training facilities. Without European prize money. We would have lost roughly $500,000. So, we need at least a million or two of prize money to stay afloat with all this 5% raises the DoF added.\n\nTransfers: Early June\n\nNothing on the outs early, but at least one Spanish standout coming in.\n\nOn a free from San Felix. He has tons of potential, and might even push Jovanovic to the second team, but early season form will show us more. Got to love the professionalism.\n\nTransfers: Late June\n\nOliveira dropped from 400k to 20k and the DoF was able to sign him for 10k when I demanded that he was our urgent signing. He comes in permanently.\n\nTin in on a free loan from Dinamo. He can play anywhere in the attack. He immediate made the media dream eleven. I could see him being an award winner by the end of the season. Gil and Bieleu will have to play for their chances to stay in the first team or start being willing to rotate in and out as needed.\n\nAnother young Spanish midfielder this time on a free from Damm. Another professional intelligent player that has a lot of room to grow.\n\nLast out is our oldest player Ziggy. He was wanting to leave and I couldn't convince the DoF otherwise to see goes for 10k to Wellington Phoenix.\n\nMedia Prediction\n\nThat puts us as the team to beat in this league now. We have spent big money this window. $11,310 total lol. Hopefully we have helped our depth enough to not lose form in the various competitions throughout the season.\n\nSchedule\n\nNext up is our game against Zrinjski the champions of Bosnia & Herzegovina. They are better than us there whole first time is Hamilton quality or better. We need to win this round though as losers skip the Europa league and get dumped straight into the conference.\n\nWish us luck as we try to bring all these new personalities together. Here the first team as it stands...\n\nThanks for following, best of luck in your own saves.\n\nCheers!\n\nJuly 2025\n\nA great win away against HŠK Zrinjski Mostar then a good start against Zalgiris in the second round. We were optimistic heading into the home leg, but we could just not break them down. Looking back over the tie we were getting extremely lucky with offsides calls that kept us in it. Alas, it was not to be and we now find ourselves in the Europa League Champions Path Third Qualifying Round. We just have to win one more tie either here or in the Conference League to make it back to a league phase and big prize money.\n\nTransfers\n\nWe had some transfers come in. Capped by our biggest transfer fee ever spent, and the biggest in Luxembourg National Division history.\n\nAfter Ziggy left we managed to talk the DoF into this young Serbian loan from Partizan. Unfortunately he agreed to a kind of hefty fee paid monthly, but overall its not a bad deal for the talent we got.\n\nNext, another loan. This time from Benfica. Amazingly we bring in Duarte Oliveira just in time to see him slowly become a squad guy. As this wingback on the right will be taking the starting role. Now we certainly have depth.\n\nLast is our record signing. The DoF paid his release clause of $105,000 from Mallorca. Resolute personality, which is a huge bonus. Luis comes in to cover our weakest position in the team, left back.\n\nNow we have 27 players of National Division (Luxembourg Top Flight) quality.\n\nFirst Team\n\nThis is the best 11 as it stands. We are now the richest team in the top flight, with the highest salary, and the only professional side. We also have over half the media dream 11 in our squad.\n\nMedia Prediction\n\nWe are the giants now. We are not the giants reputation wise, but in practicality that's how the rest of the league treats us now.\n\nCompetitions\n\nAs such our board expectations reflect that new mantle. Must get Europe in the league (minimum), must win the super cup, and must reach quarter finals of the Luxembourg Cup.\n\nThis is a new test for us and hopefully our new depth can help us rise to the occasion.\n\nThanks to anyone following along, best of luck in your own saves.\n\nCheers!\n\nAugust 2025\n\n8 games this month. Mixed form that unfortunately has us getting off to a poor start in the league. We couldn't hang on in the Europa league and were knocked out away at APOEL on penalties. So we draw Qarabag, the Azerbaijan champs. A tough draw at home didn't look great, but we absolutely thrashed them away from home to secure league phase European football again this year.\n\nTransfers\n\nOnly one transfer in this month. I don't know if its good that we used up most of our wage space prior so that our DoF seemed less transfer-happy, but we have gotten better with a domestic pickup from US Rumelange.\n\nSinner comes in as our 5th best central defender. Sinner was a regular starter for the mid-table side over the last two seasons. Progressing his average rating from a usual 6.6 in 23/24 to a consistent 6.9 just prior to his signing with us. He won't move the needle a lot, but more top flight quality depth is cool with me.\n\nCompetitions\n\nThat leaves us languishing in 14th in the league. Hopefully with only 6 games to be played this month we can make some progress in the league.\n\nBall Playing Defenders\n\nAs for our centerback depth we have...\n\n1st is Simic. Very excited to see what he can do on loan for us.\n\n2nd is Aldin. 28 years old, consistent player, who did well starting at F91 Dudelange last season helping them back to an European finish in the league.\n\n3rd is Meddour. Finally old faithful has been displaced in the starting squad. This will be his 5th season with us. The big match king remains our captain, but if he continues to pitch fits about playing time we may have to rethink his dynamic role.\n\n4th is Massimo. Driven, 20 years old. Unfortunately he has fallen slightly in potential and most staff seem to think he is more 3 star PA then 3.5. Hopefully we can give him a run of games while we are in Europe and maybe cultivate some interest in him transfer-wise.\n\n5th is Sinner the new guy who will be a reserve player and spot starter in the domestic cup games occasionally this season. Most likely we will be sending him back out on loan during the winter window.\n\n6th is Reihle, the oldest man on the team. He completes our senior players at centerback, but as you can see we have a lot of guys just waiting to take his spot. He will most likely be sold this year to make room.\n\nFirst Choice\n\nInitially not great training results, but I have no doubt Simic's complete physicals will help him in putting up a seasonal best eleven performance.\n\nSecond Choice\n\nNothing much to write home about with Aldin either (most high mental attributes), but I feel really confident having a player who was always in the league's top 10 center-backs list each of the last two seasons.\n\nSummary\n\nWe have two games in hand in the league. Two wins would put us up in 6th. Hopefully we can cap off this month by winning the Super Cup once again.\n\nThanks to anyone following along, best of luck in your own saves.\n\nCheers!\n\nSeptember 2025\n\nSuper Cup Win!\n\nA poor run of form this month is capped by a good win against Rumelange in the Luxembourg Super Cup.\n\nSchedule\n\nDropped 7 points in this month alone in the league. Which has us sitting in the bottom half of the table.\n\nCompetitions\n\nWe have 8 matches next month. 2 in the cup, 2 in the Europa Conference, and the remainder in the league. We will most likely be 2 games in hand in the league by month's end, but if we can't get up to 9th or 8th I need to start getting concerned.\n\nDefenders on the Left\n\nWe have a good number of depth at left back but not a lot of quality depth that is pushing for a place in the first team.\n\n1st is Luis, 18 year old stud that has the position locked down for most likely the next couple seasons. Pressures, tackles, and sprints per 90 are at the top 3 of the league at his position.\n\n2nd is Leon. He was great last season and has remained one of the first names off the bench this season. As well as a regular starter when rotating. Hopefully he can grow a little more.\n\n3rd is Muller, and he falls into the 2nd tier quality players in the first team. Only being leading Division of Hour quality. He may surpass Leon one day, but most likely it will be by a hair. He will get 10-ish appearances over the next 3 months. Hopefully that will show us what we have before letting him going out on loan at the winter window.\n\n4th is Zilli who was a good servant, but has failed to find a move away. I will most likely hire an intermediary in the winter window to help us get him off the books.\n\n5th is Van de Maele. He is young and can certainly be a first teamer in time. I just want him to get senior game time on loan soon to continue his development. I wish their were more professional teams to loan him to in Luxembourg.\n\nFirst Choice\n\nHis tremendous work rate has been perfect up and down the left as a wing-back on attack. Can't wait until we are out of Europe and we can set him loose on the league.\n\nSecond Choice\n\nFinally we have a big match replacement for Leon, but as cover he is a perfect fit. Plus, that pace can still help him recover even in the Europa Conference.\n\nSummary\n\nAs you can see we are suffering from similar problems we had in season one. We are expected to be scoring more than we are and thus we are missing out on 5 points we should have. Which would have us in 2nd place rather than 12th. We need to make a serious jump as you can see this is the first time we have dropped below a B+ as a board grade. Meanwhile the supporters have us down to a C+ grade. I don't think we are in danger yet as we are still secure, but if we are still in the bottom half by Christmas we will be getting a talking to from the board.\n\nHope you all have enjoyed this recap this month. Work came up and I had to set the save down for a little bit, but the new season of Welcome to Wrexham has me needing to scratch the FM itch again.\n\nBest of luck in your own saves, and wish us luck as we try to steal some prize money from our European matchups.\n\nCheers!\n\nEdited May 6 by DrChristopher\n\nOctober 2025\n\nSchedule\n\nOnly 2 points dropped this month helped us rise to 6th, but we have no games in hand in the league. A close game against Football Club Nordsjælland from Denmark gave us the confidence to go play like we had nothing to lose and claim a draw against AZ.\n\nCompetitions\n\nThis leaves us a point below the knockout cutoff. Hopefully we can steal some points from another match this run.\n\nDefensive Midfielders\n\nNow for the Defensive Midfielders. Not a ton a star power, but a ton of potential and cover.\n\n1st is Pablo. 18 years old with 16 starts and a 7.04 average rating. He has been an incredible signing. Especially because he agreed to squad player playing time expectations while playing more like a regular starter. Love the professionalism.\n\n2nd is Konate has been a long time defender that has fallen to the second string team. Only 12 appearances so far this season. He hasn't made any big impacts, but his defensive skills make him a firm sub to have off the bench.\n\n3rd is Nys. 17 years old with miles of potential. He was gonna get some playing time, but has been out with two minor injuries during a particularly packed portion of our schedule and missed both opportunities. Fortunately we got to see him play with the reserves averaging a 6.85 with 2 goals and 3 assists in 20 appearances for the 2nd team. He will be 18 by the second half of the season. So he will most likely be out on loan next transfer window.\n\n4th is Djogou who was originally the third man, but with the young-ins closing in behind him he is essentially transfer listed going forward. William was a 3 season servant to the club, but has lost playing time every year. Also being that he refuses to become Luxembourgish he just hurts our foreign player limit squad rules. So, au revoir mate.\n\n5th is Rosina, the former heir apparent has got to find some senior minutes away on loan soon to keep pace with the glutton of potential we have around his skill-level. He played great in the second division last season with FC Syra Mensdorf, and would do well with a return their to finish off the season.\n\nFirst Choice\n\nThe professionalism and the future home grown status is incredible appealing to us. We have suffered with small European rosters and would love to some depth in these long league phases. Not only that but his ability to play up and down the spine makes him a good bench option going forward if needed. However, being double footed I doubt anyone is displacing him anytime soon.\n\nSecond Choice\n\nOur newest Luxembourg citizen. He thinks he can play for the national team, but likely he will never get there. Nonetheless we love his skills for us off the bench. Great in the air, loves big matches. He will probably receive another 20 appearances throughout the remainder of the season. Next season might be a trying one for him if he can't round out his potential soon.\n\nData Hub\n\nHere are some data hub highlights. Defending looks good and scoring make us feels like we will never have to worry about getting shots in the league.\n\nLuxembourg National Division\n\nOur goal differential is really gonna be an asset at the end of the season, but we still have a lot of ground to make up to catch up with Alisontia Steinsel.\n\n7 games this month with perhaps two of our most winnable Europa Conference league games against Limassol and Flora. Wish us luck as this month will be make or break to see if we have any shot at the knockout stage of the competition.\n\nBest of luck in your own saves.\n\nLet's go Hostert!\n\nEdited May 7 by DrChristopher\n\nNovember 2025\n\nSchedule\n\nAn almost perfect month. Of course our only loss was against Differdange in the league. Which has prevented us from catching up with the league leaders, Alisontia, in points despite moving up a couple places.\n\nUEFA Europa Conference League\n\nTwo big wins against bottom of the table teams in Europe make us good candidates to make the knockouts. This actually gives us the highest coefficient points ever for our country. We are still too far behind to get more teams in Europe, but a great season for Luxembourg even if the dream of progressing ends in this round.\n\nLuxembourg National Division\n\nWe are just outside the European places with a win separating us and 2nd. The harder task will be catching first. We aren't even at the half-way point, but the European prize money has become pretty necessary for our financial stability. As we are double the next highest player salary in the league, Progress with $550,000 a year.\n\nCentral Midfielders - Mezzala (Support)\n\nWe have 7 players we consider the pipeline for central midfield.\n\nThe starting duo is Emili and Schmidtka. Both are averaging above a 7 in rating. Plus, with both lads being here permanently at such young ages. They will be home grown at club in a few short years.\n\nThe second duo is Jovanovic and Teah. Teah definitely has the potential to stay around as a squad regular, I believe he also will be homegrown within a season and a half. Meanwhile Jovan has been a team regular the last 3 seasons. Averaging 39 appearances in all competitions the last two seasons. Both guys have some versatility that will keep them getting appearances for at least the next two seasons.\n\nThe third duo is Loua and Dzafo. Loua was originally kicking up a fuss at the beginning of the season, but has accepted fringe player roles alongside Dzafo. Dzafo seems like he would have a little more useful role versatility, but he refuses to claim Luxembourg secondary nationality despite being eligible. If Bradley takes that next step Dzafo will find himself on the transfer list as he has the higher transfer value. All three will be off on loan in the winter window.\n\nFirst Choice\n\nEmili has been great in the assist department with 7 in 21 starts. He has stayed healthy and with his professionalism we have seen a slight rise in his skills. With a training facility upgrade next month. That should help his development.\n\nSecond Choice\n\nSchmidtka has regressed skill wise a little despite a good mentorship group and good professionalism. Regardless he has been player of the match 3 times this season in the odd national division game he has started in. With that leadership though if he can stay in the first XI he will most likely be captain once he becomes home-grown (21 years old).\n\nOverview\n\n7 matches again next month with our next game as the second leg in the cup against Mondercange. Interestingly our staff claims we are still evenly-matched with the mid-table side despite a 4-0 win in the first leg. Those two European wins have given us another million in the balance. We may need to hide the extra transfer and wage budget before the transfer window to keep the DoF from going wild.\n\nThanks for following along and best of luck in your own saves!\n\nCheers!\n\nDecember 2025\n\nSchedule\n\n1 point gained from our last two Europa fixtures, and only 2 points dropped from our possible 12 points in the league.\n\nUEFA Europa Conference League\n\nWhich means we officially made the knockout stage, but this most likely spells the end of our run. It was a good campaign though, but led mostly by our loanees. So we may struggle to replicate this success.\n\nLuxembourg National League\n\nMeanwhile in the league we move to 3rd, 7 points back with the best goal differential. Peixoto is also thriving in the league, and once we finish any European ties he will make short work of the domestic competition. Dudelange hasn't hired a new manager yet and is opting for a caretaker since we turned them down. He may win the job though as he is moving them up the table.\n\nAttacking Midfielders (Right) - Inside Forward (Attack)\n\nAMR is our thinnest position I think.\n\n1st is Tin, the GNK Dinamo Zagreb attacker is incredible and will presumably refuse an extension here unless our team quality steps up in a big way. 11 goals in 25 appearances has been awesome though.\n\n2nd is Bieleu the Cameroonian winger. He is injury prone, but has stayed healthy for the most part. He is a leading quality National Division guy with 5 goals and 8 assists in 25 appearances. This position gets a lot of action in our setup. If we miss out on resigning Tin getting a replacement will likely be our first priority rather than starting Bieleu.\n\n3rd is Avdusinovic he was a regular starter for us the last two seasons, but with all the firepower the DoF brought in. He has become surplus to requirements. We are still trying to figure out the best way to get the DoF to focus on selling off these players as the unwanted list seems hit or miss.\n\n4th is Popp, the German youngster from SV Eichede. He is wanted on loan by a 3rd tier side, so hopefully he can get some playing time with them. So far this season he has averaged a 7.9 with the U18s and a 7.2 with the reserves rating wise. 23 goals in 35 appearances across both teams alongside 13 assists. Really looking forward to seeing how he plays for a senior squad.\n\nFirst Choice\n\nMan I wish we could keep him, but it would likely take the entire transfer budget and then some. He and Peixoto likely will be competing for 'Young player of the season'. They just need to make sure to play enough games in the league to be eligible.\n\nSecond Choice\n\nBen has been great in the league. 3 goals and 5 assists in 12 appearances with a 7.34 average rating. He hates big games, is injury prone and is mostly capped potential-wise. Nonetheless he is still a passable option in the senior team. Really the biggest issue I dislike with him is his wage as he is outside the first XI, but still top 7 in the squad as far as wage. Debating trying to see if he will agree to a more favorable contract as I think <$30,000 is closer to a fair wage. (Trying to trim the budget in case ever miss out on a champions league spot.)\n\nBoard\n\nThe board have agreed to increasing the junior coaching budget, but I haven't seen the adjective change to indicate that investment. Does anyone know if I have to ask for more staff or does junior coaching just give more in wages to sign youth team staff? Any insight would be helpful.\n\nNext up is a big league fixture month. With 5 league matches including a matchup against top of the table Alisontia away. A win there would be a big 6-pointer and help us reclaim our throne. By the way Alisontia have been super impressive they earned promotion to the top flight in season 1. Came 2nd last season, and now will likely be going down to the wire to displace us on top of the mountain this season. All while only being media predicted 8th.\n\nAnyways that is all for this month. Thanks for following along, and best of luck in your own saves.\n\nLet's go Hostert!\n\nJanuary 2026\n\nSchedule\n\nA perfect January. Leads us to a cup busy February. We haven't got our knockout draw yet but we play 3 games against current 6th place side Progres. We may have gotten a little eager in our development list. As now our first team is down to 24 players.\n\nLuxembourg National League\n\nWe are now in 2nd with 6 points on 3rd, and within 4 points of 1st. Peixoto is still leading the league in form, but we have had some unfortunate departures at the hand of our Director of Football\n\nTransfers\n\nThe good news first. The development list has worked with tons of guy going out to Luxembourgish sides. Very happy about that. Also we were able to steer the director to young talent to bring in, downside a few won't come in until next season. The few that have are all on a free. Two of our best are below...\n\nIncoming\n\nA new goalkeeper way better than Kips. Unfortunately Kips was in the middle of a 2 month long playing time promise so hopefully we can split the playing time and keep both guys happy until we can negotiate Kips playing time down.\n\nNext is striker prospect Artur from Ukraine. Great speed and technique with 4 assists in 3 starts for the first team. Might fit better on the wing then up top. Great role agreement too.\n\nOutgoing\n\nDinamo were feed up that we didn't use him as an inverted winger. They recalled him as soon as the window opened. He refused the DoF's attempt to sign him on a permanente.\n\nThen the worse news. Atlanta United came in for a transfer of Micah Hamilton. He was definitely our best player, but the money was too good for the administration to pass up. He signed for 6 times what we were paying him wage wise. So can't say I blame him. Huge blow to the side.\n\nLoanees\n\nCurrently 52 players at the club and at last count almost 20 are out on loan to different sides. We have taken a step back in our media prediction assessment. At our highest heights we were 70% favorites to win the league. That has drifted down to 40% favorites. Our new look starting eleven is as follows...\n\nFirst XI\n\nWish us luck as we try to find our new identity. Thanks for following along, and best of luck in your own saves.\n\nAlso I haven't been able to find a nickname for the team online. Other than not of their numerous youth teams.\n\nIf anyone knows the club nickname let me know otherwise ill just be calling them, Auslänners. I was going for outsiders or underdogs. The closest translations I could find was foreigners/outsiders. Either would work as we have almost a third of the club are foreign talent and youngsters.\n\nSo, let's go Auslänners!\n\nFebruary 2026\n\nSchedule\n\nWe draw Trabzonspor. He somehow managed a 1 all draw at home. We knew it was curtains. Then we got a early second half sent off of an opposition player and finally managed to break through with 15 minutes to go. We are on to the round of 16 and we face the team that we barely lost to in the league phase, FC Nordsjælland.\n\nCompetitions\n\nWe also face FC Schifflange '95 in the Luxembourg Cup semi-finals. We are also down to 9 games left in the league with us only a point behind. We really hoped we would be out of Europe by now. The thin squad it is no where more evident than the pipeline focus this month...\n\nAttacking Midfielder (Left) - Inside Forward (Attack)\n\nAfter a few departures, it has decimated the coverage at AML.\n\nOur new/old 1st team man is Walther. He has been perfectly passable with good stats, and at 22 he has found himself back in the starting eleven. It most likely won't be for long, but his consistency has eased our anxiety.\n\n2nd is Teah. He has been a third stringer all season and performed so poorly in training. It has caused him to regress in numerous skills, but hopefully he will play into form before too long as we will need his depth.\n\n3rd is Gascons. The stats in the image are of his current loan spell to FC Jeunesse Junglinster in the mid-table of the Division of Honour. His average rating is standard, but he has not been very clinical in those starts.\n\n4th is Balsa, and likewise his stats show for his current loan at FC Blo Wäiss Medernach in the Division of Honour currently sitting in 7th place. His contributions on loan and his average rating there have been much better. Both Balsa and Gascons are playing for their chance to dispose Teah to have a squad role in the senior team next season.\n\nFirst Choice\n\nThankfully he is a fan of big matches as the league seems to be going down to the final fixtures. Also the speed as made him able to keep up with better European opposition.\n\nSecond Choice\n\nTeah was my homegrown project that I thought would be regularly around the senior team. Unfortunately for the most part he has not popped off and his training has made him even more unpickable when deciding between him and others off the bench. Regardless needs must and he finds himself as our second choice for the rest of the season.\n\nOverview\n\nAs the summary reads. Nordsjaelland are a much better team. Hopefully they will put us out of our misery here and we can be knocked down to only 2 competitions.\n\n7 games this month will stretch our depth to the brink again.\n\nThanks for following along, best of luck in your own saves.\n\nCheers!\n\nMarch 2026\n\nSchedule\n\nWe had a tough tie in Europe, but despite a good away game we could not make it any further. This allowed us to treat the remaining competitions with our full focus, and we took it to the domestic clubs.\n\nCompetitions\n\nWe now have a final date with Differdange to try to reclaim the Luxembourg Cup. Also, we finally had a chance as FC Alisontia Steinsel dropped points and we were able to take a 3 point lead in first place. 4 games to play this coming month. 7 games total left and 6 more games left in the league.\n\nStriker - Advanced Forward (Attack)\n\nWe have 5 guys considered for our pipeline of striker talent.\n\n1st is Jordi. 30 goals in 41 appearances for the club. Still just 19 years old with plenty of potential. I just hope we can keep him. Now that we know the DoF is willing to sell good talent out from under us.\n\n2nd is the Ram. 28 appearances and 15 goals to his name. He is also 19 years old. The FC Jeunesse Junglinster product was a huge safety blanket for us in our domestic competitions this season. Both guys are likely going to be leading the line for the foreseeable future.\n\n3rd is Herr. Who is absolutely fed up with his lack of playing time. He has put in for transfer. So despite being a decent domestic option (Luxembourg second nationality) he will likely be gone by next season.\n\n4th is Busche. We have unfortunately failed to get him a loan opportunity. Nonetheless he has scored 38 goals in 37 appearances throughout our youth ranks this season. We got to get this man a chance to prove himself against senior talent.\n\n5th is Mamadou. He has been out on loan at FC Syra Mensdorf in the Division of Honour. He has scored 7 goals in 31 appearances. Not the greatest record, and his side is likely to be relegated to the 3rd tier of Luxembourgish football.\n\nFirst Choice\n\nGarcia is regressing a little bit, but he is still way ahead of most of the players in our side. On top of being pretty reasonable with both feet. Still can't believe we were able to get him on a free.\n\nSecond Choice\n\nRam meanwhile has been slowly improving. He has excellent peripheries. Good training, good composure, tall, either footed. Looking forward to him developing with us.\n\nData Hub\n\nHere is the most recent data hub numbers. We are doing really well across the board. Except perhaps defending due to almost no one staying very long in our half. We may have the league locked up by the end of this month.\n\nThanks for following along, and best of luck in your own saves.\n\nLet's go Auslänners!\n\nApril 2026\n\nChampions!\n\nWe did it! This is 3 seasons of being at the top of the pyramid.\n\nSchedule\n\n10 points of 12 this month sealed it. Really strong scoring all season has us within 4-5 goals of the all-time team goals record in a top flight season.\n\nLuxembourg National Division\n\nCrazy collapse that Alisontia had this season. It really was their league to win for a majority of the season. We won on 79 points our first year. So it was just a bummer that they faced a team like us. Hopefully they can give us some European help.\n\nReserve League\n\nThe youth teams are tearing it up too. This the first time the Reserves have had this kind of form, and their points total is insane only dropping 8 points all season so far. Plus, our guys are all over the leaderboards.\n\nU18 League\n\nHostert has also won the U18 league for the third time. Crazy too that Busche is the leading scoring in both leagues in the same season.\n\nEuropean Coefficients\n\nWe have have made a big jump from 2.75 points last year to 5.37 points this year. That should hopefully get us back to 4 teams in Europe again. We just need those teams to win some money so the prize money can start trickling through the league system.\n\nI love that this season seemed to be in the bag, but was really a wild ride from start to finish.\n\nNext month will be our recap as we try to reset.\n\nNew Chairperson\n\nAlmost forgot to mention. We had our old chairperson retire, and before he was out the door he was replaced by a local business man, who offered a significant transfer budget. However, since we don't get to manage that we asked for a training facility upgrade instead, and they agreed. So in the next two months we should have both a youth and training facilities upgrade. All while maintaining 6 million or so in the bank balance.\n\nIf at all possible I think I want to try to bring in more depth, and maybe help the league as each season the reputation drops, and it eats at the prize money. If we can bring up the reputation perhaps we can get more prize money to the other clubs.\n\nAnyway thanks for following along, and best of luck in your own saves.\n\nCheers!\n\nJune 2026\n\nSchedule\n\nLooks like we have an easy draw against Newtown in the Champions League. If we win we play Seinäjoen Jalkapallokerho of Finland or Víkingur R. of Iceland. Both would be very even draws.\n\nCompetitions\n\nThe board are expecting us to win everything domestically. This will be interesting now that everyone expects us not to drop form in any competitions. We have been kind of wild and free the last few seasons, but now our success is a demand.\n\nTransfers In\n\nI couldn't stop the DoF from spending big this window, but at least I could direct him to the free young players. First was a brand new striker. 16 finishing, I don't think we have ever had someone so clinical.\n\nNext was a painfully big wage on a new center back. Liking the heading and jumping reach. The young Spaniard is impressive, but I worry we are gonna start to needing Champions League prize money if we bring in too many players on these kinds of wages. (Last season we basically broke even financially. This season we are likely to be a little in the negative unless we can trim the roster/staff)\n\nThe DoF immediately did it again with another center back partner, young Croatian, Ismet. He doesn't jump out physically or technically but those mentals are awesome. We are gonna be absolutely impossible to brake down defensively.\n\nTransfers Out\n\nWe then "
