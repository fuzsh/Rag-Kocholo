        "text": "Standing between St Patrick’s Athletic and a spot in the Europa Conference League play-offs are one of the newest clubs in European football - but one with significant financial backing.\n\nAzeri side Sabah FK arrived in Dublin on Tuesday ahead of Thursday’s clash with Stephen Kenny’s side in Tallaght Stadium with a squad packed with internationals.\n\nAnd while the players are staying in the luxurious confines of the Castleknock Hotel, the club’s board and officials have treated themselves to a significant upgrade.\n\nREAD MORE: St Patrick's Athletic hero issues Euro warning ahead of third round clash\n\nREAD MORE: Lee Carsley is set to take charge of England against Ireland next month\n\nThey have splashed the cash on rooms in one of Dublin’s most expensive hotels, the Westbury, just off Grafton Street, where a one-night stay can cost as much as €3,900 for their most expensive room.\n\nSabah FK were formed in 2017, just in time to join the Azerbaijan First Division for the 2017/18 season. They won promotion at the first time of asking and quickly established themselves in the top-flight.\n\nTheir best finish came two seasons ago when they finished runners-up to mega-rich Qarabag, while last season they finished third, earning them Conference League qualification.\n\nSabah’s squad includes 10 internationals, one of whom will need no introduction to Pat’s manager Kenny.\n\nVincent Thill was one of Luxembourg’s star performers in March 2021 when they stunned Kenny’s Ireland at the Aviva Stadium, winning 1-0 in a World Cup qualifier.\n\nKenny will have happier memories of a meeting with some of their other international stars, however.\n\nNamiq Alasgarov started in Ireland’s October 2021 win away to Azerbaijan, while Tellar Mutallimov and Anatoliy Nuriyev were on the bench that day, when Callum Robinson scored twice and Chiedozie Ogbene also found the net.\n\nThey also have Jamaica international winger Kaheem Parris, Morocco’s Sofian Chakla and former Slovakia forward Pavol Safranko among their ranks.\n\nSabah play in the 13,000-capacity Bank Respublika Arena, located just under an hour away from the capital Baku.\n\nIn their short existence, they are onto their seventh permanent manager, while four men have served as interim boss.\n\nTheir longest-serving manager Murad Musayev resigned last February to return to his former club Krasnodar. Current boss, Croatian Krunoslav Rendulic, took charge in early March and has an impressive record so far of 10 wins in 13 games."
