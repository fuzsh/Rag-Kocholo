        "text": "SCRATCH RACES\n\nA straight race for the finish line with Rider Points\n\nEach team's score is determined by adding the total number of points scored by all finishing team members.\n\nWhere multiple teams have the same total score in a division, each team's fastest finishing rider will determine the teams finishing position in the leaue.\n\nPOINTS RACES\n\nZRL Points Races incorporate multiple scoring opportunities in the form of segment points and overall Finishing Points (FIN).\n\nFirst-Across-the-Line (FAL) Segment Points\n\nDesignated segments (sprints and climbs) on designated laps will offer FAL points for the first 20 racers to cross the segment's finish line. If a scoring rider's result is annulled, their FAL points remain with the rider but are excluded from any individual or team tally - they are not passed to the next rider. Please refer to ZRL Course Schedule for intermediates in play for each event.\n\nFastest-Through Segment (FTS) Segment Points\n\nAwarded to the top 10 Fastest Times throughout the race at designated Sprints and climbs. This is scored per race (not per lap).\n\nFinishing Position Scoring (FIN)\n\nFIN points are awarded based on the order that riders finish the race in as follows:\n\nTEAM TIME TRIALS\n\nTeam Time Trials are a true test of how 6 team members can work together to get at least 4 racers across the line in the fastest possible time. Team members will need to work together, take turns at the front and maintain as much draft for trailing team members.\n\nTeams are NOT permitted to draft from other teams and dropped team members should never ride or interfere with other teams on course.\n\nTeams are ranked by the time of the 4th rider. 4 riders MUST finish to score League Points and there are no individual rider points (FAL, FTS or FIN) on offer.\n\nLeague Points are allocated as per the League Points table below based on team rank. 1st place is 20 points, 2nd is 19 and so on.\n\nLEAGUE POINTS\n\nFor each Points Race the total Individual rider scores will be COMBINED (totaled) by team and ranked.\n\nTeam Time Trials are scored on TEAM finishing position.\n\nThe team with the HIGHEST total COMBINED scores will be declared the winner of the race.\n\nIn the event of a tie in COMBINED scores (only applies to Points Races), teams are then ranked in the following order:\n\nFinish Points Total\n\nFAL Points Total\n\nFTS Points Total\n\nIf a teams total points are still tied, the position of each tied team’s best rider across the finish line shall determine the tied team’s ordering, with the team with the higher placed rider placing higher.\n\nTeams are awarded LEAGUE POINTS for each race in each DIVISION of each LEAGUE as per the descending ranking as follows:\n\nZRL Community Division final League Standings\n\nAt the end of each ROUND, the team with the most LEAGUE POINTS shall be declared the winner of that round.\n\nIn the event of a tie on Total League Points, teams are then ranked in the same way as detailed above. This order is Total League/Season Points, Total Finish Line Points, Total FAL points, Total FTS points. In the event that this still results in a tie, it would fall to whichever team had the highest placing rider in the final race.\n\nWhere there is more than 1 division per Pace Group Category, at least 1 team will gain promotion to the division above and at least 1 team will be relegated to the division below.\n\nZRL SEASON FINALE\n\nA team must complete all 6 races in at least 1 round of the season to be elligible to race in the ZRL SEASON FINALE.\n\nRiders must complete at least 3 races, for the team, in any single round of the season to be elligible to race in the ZRL SEASON FINALE."
