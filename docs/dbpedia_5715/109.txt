These neighbourhoods are concentrated in a relatively small area, so it’s easy to get from one to the next. Safe and inviting, each has its own special vibe, with unique food, shops, and places to relax and have a good time. Just like the people you’ll meet on the streets, the city’s neighbourhoods are warm, welcoming, and tons of fun. Head out to discover the charm and beauty of each, which changes with the seasons. Never a dull moment, always a place at the table. That’s Québec City!

The Historical Neighbourhood

Fully enclosed by 4.6 km of fortifications, Old Québec is like a time capsule that grows more charming with each passing year. In summer and winter, from the top of the ramparts, along the stone cliffs, on Dufferin Terrace, you’ll want to take your time and soak up the history of this lively neighbourhood. In this maze of winding old streets set in the shadow of Château Frontenac, every nook and cranny has a story to tell.

The Bohemian Neighbourhood

Nestled between Old Québec and Montcalm, Saint-Jean-Baptiste is a foodie’s paradise. Leading out from the walled quarter, Saint‑Jean street runs the length of the neighbourhood, crossed by street after street of colourful houses hugging the steep hillside. By day you’ll find bakeries, chocolate shops, and gourmet grocery stores alongside booksellers, record shops, and independent boutiques. At night, Saint‑Jean’s restaurants, pubs, and bistros will have you out until the wee hours of the morning enjoying the great food and good times.

The Family Neighbourhood

Ahhh Limoilou, where neighbours chit chat, families fraternize, and friends stay the day. The parks are for picnicking. The walking is for talking. You can go for a run along the Saint‑Charles River or run errands on 3e Avenue. With all the bistros, cafés, specialty groceries, bakeries, and delis, it’s a party in your mouth—and on the streets. It’s hockey in the alleys and impromptu soirées on the balconies. It’s Limoilou!
