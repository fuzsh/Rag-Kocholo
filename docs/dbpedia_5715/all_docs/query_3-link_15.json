The main way borough is used in the US is to refer to a certain type of animal dwellings but we understand the meaning given by cropje jnr.\n\nI liked all of cropje jnr's suggestions, though in American English it is unlikely that someone would say borough. The main way borough is used in the US is to refer to a certain type of animal dwellings but we understand the meaning given by cropje jnr.\n\nBorough is a very appropriate suggestion in my opinion, depending on the city/country. What you're thinking of are burrows.\n\nYou're right mrbilal about the spelling. I got mixed up. It still isn't a likely word choice in the US though. I suppose it is more common in Canada.\n\nSome US cities, notably New York, have boroughs. (Manhattan, for example, is one of the boroughs.)\n\nAnd, checking a little further, I have found that New Jersey has incorporated towns called boroughs, and what many US states call counties, Alaska calls boroughs.\n\nYou're right mrbilal about the spelling. I got mixed up. It still isn't a likely word choice in the US though. I suppose it is more common in Canada.\n\nI believe some US cities and states have boroughs, especially New York City. In Canada, boroughs are fairly uncommon, the most being in Quebec.\n\nI had not thought of New York City. I can't think of any other areas in the US like that, so I would say the other choices provided are safer options.\n\nI think the thread drifted in other lanes and no one answered the specific question. In what case should I use \"neighborhood\" or \"vicinity\"?\n\nI'm going to give another example for better undertanding:\n\nThis could be a good neighborhood/vicinity for a family to live\n\nThank you.\n\nDo all of these work and mean more or less the same thing?\n\nThere's quite a lot of crime in this area.\n\nThere's quite a lot of crime in this neighbourhood.\n\nThere's quite a lot of crime in the vicinity."
