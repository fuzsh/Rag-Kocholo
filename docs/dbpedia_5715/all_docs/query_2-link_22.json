        "text": "Hello,\n\nWhen I was born my parents gave me only one name, let's say Jessica.\n\nWhen I was 18 I went to the Ministry of the Interior and added another name in my I.D., let's say that the secondary name is CFU.\n\nI'm filling a form. I have two fields and I don’t know where to write CFU (my secondary name).\n\nIs CFU a Middle Name or Alias Given Name?\n\nIf it makes any difference for your answer, I don't use my secondary name. It is just written in my I.D. Most of my freinds don't even know that I have it.\n\nThank you for your help\n\nSuppose a girl is named \"Lucia\" by her family. To this she adds \"Sue\", and calls herself \"Lucia Sue\". Sue is a middle name. She then becomes a singer in a girl group, and adopts the stage name \"Lush Spice\". \"Lush Spice\" is an alias.\n\nDoes that help?\n\nSo, if when pepole ask me \"what is your name\" my answer is always only Jessica (in my example), then CFU is not a middle name but alias name in my I.D.\n\nRight?\n\nI want to ask it again. Sorry for being pedant here. It is very important for me not to make any mistake.\n\nI'm taking GWB's example. Is Sue a middle name because it is written in this girl's ID?\n\nIf Sue is written in her ID but she doesn’t use this name. Everyone call her Lucia and she has never mentioned the name Sue. Would it still be her middle name?\n\nEveryone call her Lucia and she has never mentioned the name Sue. Would it still be her middle name?\n\nMany people have middle names that appear on their birth certificates or baptismal records, but which they do not ordinarily use, even as initials. Nevertheless, they still can refer to these as \"middle names\".\n\nIt is advisable to avoid the word alias unless talking about criminals. An artiste, singer or whatever, has a stage name or is \"also known as...\" often abbreviated to aka. An author has a \"nom de plume\" or penname. Or you say, \"goes under the name of...\" whether talking of a criminal or not. And in recent years we have had \"The artist earlier known as Prince\", I think it was.\n\nThank you Arrius\n\nWell, in the form there were two fields:\n\n1. Middle Name\n\n2. Alias Given Name /Additional Given Name\n\nThree questions:\n\n1) If I was a criminal and I was known in my neighborhood as \"the hammer\". Would it be an Alias Given Name /Additional Given Name?\n\n2) Also, I have an Argentinean friend. Her family call here Malina, but this name is not written in her ID, the only name in her ID is an Israeli name. In this case, is the name Melina an Alias Given Name/Additional Given Name?\n\n3) Is there a difference between Alias and Additional name?"
