I think neighbor can be used just for those that live just next to you or next door while neighborhood could be quite big. Am I right? Is so, what's the word?\n\nEdit: The reason I'm asking this is that in my native language we have a word that the rough translation of it is \"same-neighbourhoodie (person)\". I know it's awkward in English :). He might live a block away for example. We call people who live next door something else that I always thought it's neighbor.\n\nThanks\n\nActually, I do not believe that neighbor strictly means people living right next to you.\n\nneighbor\n\n: a person who lives next to or near another person\n\n: a person or thing that is next to or near another\n\nThis is why you might (often) hear next-door neighbor. Such a neighbor lives in an adjacent home to you. This is to distinguish that neighbor from a neighbor who lives in a house across from you or down the block.\n\nanswered Jun 19, 2016 at 11:03\n\nEm.Em.\n\n45.4k1212 gold badges136136 silver badges149149 bronze badges"
