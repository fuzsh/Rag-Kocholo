Rogers. © McFeely-Rogers Foundation.\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nSometimes you feel like holding your pillow all night long.\n\nSometimes you hug your teddy bear tightly,\n\nHe’s old but he’s still strong.\n\nAnd sometimes you want to snuggle up closely with your own Mom and Dad,\n\nAt night, you even need the light sometimes,\n\nBut that’s not bad.\n\nPlease don’t think it’s funny,\n\nWhen you want an extra kiss.\n\nThere are lots and lots of people,\n\nWho sometimes feel like this.\n\nPlease don’t think it’s funny\n\nWhen you want the ones you miss.\n\nThere are lots and lots of people\n\nWho sometimes feel like this.\n\nIt’s great to know you’re growing up bigger every day.\n\nBut somehow things you like to remember\n\nAre often put away.\n\nAnd sometimes you wonder over and over\n\nIf you should stay inside.\n\nWhen you enjoy a younger toy…\n\nYou never need to hide.\n\nIn the long, long trip of growing\n\nThere are stops along the way,\n\nFor thoughts of all the soft things,\n\nAnd the look of yesterday.\n\nFor a chance to fill our feelings,\n\nWith comfort and with ease,\n\nAnd then tell the new tomorrow,\n\n“You can come now when you please.”\n\nSo please don’t think it’s funny,\n\nWhen you want an extra kiss.\n\nThere are lots and lots of people\n\nWho sometimes feel like this.\n\nPlease don’t think it’s funny,\n\nWhen you want the ones you miss.\n\nThere are lots and lots of people\n\nWho sometimes feel like this.\n\nMusic and Lyrics by Fred M. Rogers. © McFeely-Rogers Foundation.\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nSome things I don’t understand.\n\nSome things are scary and sad.\n\nSometimes I even get bad when I’m mad.\n\nSometimes I even get glad.\n\nWhy does a dog have to bark?\n\nWhy does an elephant die?\n\nWhy can’t we play all the time in the park?\n\nWhy can’t my pussycat fly?\n\nWhy, why, why, why, why, why\n\nI wonder why.\n\nWhy, why, why, why, why, why\n\nI wonder why.\n\nWhy do big people say, “No!”?\n\nWhy are their voices so loud?\n\nWhy don’t the witches and bad guys all go?\n\nWhy does the sky fly a cloud?\n\nWhy, why, why, why, why, why\n\nI wonder why.\n\nWhy, why, why, why, why, why\n\nI wonder why.\n\nWhy does it have to get dark?\n\nWhy can’t the day always stay?\n\nLet’s say goodbye to the night time, Goodbye.\n\nLet’s send the dark time away.\n\nWhy do fire engines make noise?\n\nWhy is hot water so hot?\n\nWhy aren’t live babies like my other toys?\n\nWhy do I wonder a lot?\n\nSome day, oh some day, I’ll know what to say.\n\nSome day, oh some day, I’ll not have to say\n\nWHY?\n\nMusic and Lyrics by Fred M.

Rogers. © McFeely-Rogers Foundation.\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nWhat if I were very, very sad\n\nAnd all I did was smile?\n\nI wonder after a while,\n\nWhat might become of my sadness?\n\nWhat if I were very, very angry,\n\nAnd all I did was sit\n\nAnd never think about it,\n\nWhat might become of my anger?\n\nWhere would they go, and what would they do\n\nIf I couldn’t let them out?\n\nMaybe I’d fall, maybe get sick\n\nOr doubt.\n\nBut what if I could know the truth\n\nAnd say just how I feel?\n\nI think I’d learn a lot that’s real\n\nAbout freedom.\n\nI’m learning to sing a sad song when I’m sad.\n\nI’m learning to say I’m angry when I’m very mad.\n\nI’m learning to shout,\n\nI’m getting it out,\n\nI’m happy, learning\n\nExactly how I feel inside of me.\n\nI’m learning to know the truth.\n\nI’m learning to tell the truth.\n\nDiscovering truth will make me free.\n\nMusic and Lyrics by Fred M. Rogers. © McFeely-Rogers Foundation.\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nWhat do you do with the mad that you feel\n\nWhen you feel so mad you could bite?\n\nWhen the whole wide world seems oh, so wrong…\n\nAnd nothing you do seems very right?\n\nWhat do you do? Do you punch a bag?\n\nDo you pound some clay or some dough?\n\nDo you round up friends for a game of tag?\n\nOr see how fast you go?\n\nIt’s great to be able to stop\n\nWhen you’ve planned a thing that’s wrong,\n\nAnd be able to do something else instead\n\nAnd think this song:\n\nI can stop when I want to\n\nCan stop when I wish\n\nI can stop, stop, stop any time.\n\nAnd what a good feeling to feel like this\n\nAnd know that the feeling is really mine.\n\nKnow that there’s something deep inside\n\nThat helps us become what we can.\n\nFor a girl can be someday a woman\n\nAnd a boy can be someday a man.\n\nMusic and Lyrics by Fred M. Rogers. © McFeely-Rogers Foundation.\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nOne time I wished that a lion would come\n\nAnd eat up my house and my street.\n\nI was mad at the world\n\nAnd I wished that the beast,\n\nWould stomp everything\n\nWith his big heavy feet,\n\nAnd eat everything\n\nWith his big sharp teeth,\n\nAnd eat everything\n\nWith his teeth.\n\nBut that wish certainly didn’t come true,\n\n‘Cause scary, mad wishes don’t make things come true.\n\nOne time I wished that a dragon would come\n\nAnd burn up my Daddy’s big store.\n\nI was angry with him\n\n‘Cause I wanted to play\n\nBut my Daddy just went\n\nTo his store right away.\n\nI wished that the dragon\n\nWould burn his store,\n\nI wished it would burn Daddy’s store.\n\nBut that wish certainly didn’t come true,\n\n‘Cause scary, mad wishes don’t make things come true.\n\nEveryone wishes for scary, mad things.\n\nI’d guess that you sometimes do, too.\n\nI’ve wished for so many\n\nAnd I can say,\n\nThat all kinds of wishes\n\nAre things just like play.\n\nThey’re things\n\nThat our thinking has made,\n\nSo wish then\n\nAnd don’t be afraid.\n\nI’m glad it’s certainly that way, aren’t you?\n\nThat scary, mad wishes don’t make things come true.\n\nNo kinds of wishes make things come true.\n\nMusic and Lyrics by Fred M. Rogers. © McFeely-Rogers Foundation.\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nYou can make-believe it happens, or pretend that something’s true.\n\nYou can wish or hope or contemplate a thing you’d like to do,\n\nBut until you start to do it, you will never see it through\n\n‘Cause the make-believe pretending just won’t do it for you.\n\nYou’ve got to do it.\n\nEvery little bit, you’ve got to do it, do it, do it, do it\n\nAnd when you’re through, you can know who did it\n\nFor you did it, you did it, you did it.\n\nIf you want to ride a bicycle and ride it straight and tall,\n\nYou can’t simply sit and look at it ’cause it won’t move at all.\n\nBut it’s you who have to try it, and it’s you who have to fall (sometimes)\n\nIf you want to ride a bicycle and ride it straight and tall.\n\nYou’ve got to do it.\n\nEvery little bit, you’ve got to do it, do it, do it, do it\n\nAnd when you’re through, you can know who did it\n\nFor you did it, you did it, you did it.\n\nIf you want to read a reading book and read the real words too,\n\nYou can’t simply sit and ask the words to read themselves to you.\n\nBut you have to ask a person who can show you one or two\n\nIf you want to read a reading book and read the real words, too.\n\nYou’ve got to do it.\n\nEvery little bit, you’ve got to do it, do it, do it, do it\n\nAnd when you’re through, you can know who did it\n\nFor you did it, you did it, you did it.\n\nIt’s not easy to keep trying, but it’s one good way to grow.\n\nIt’s not easy to keep learning, but I know that this is so:\n\nWhen you’ve tried and learned you’re bigger than you were a day ago.\n\nIt’s not easy to keep trying, but it’s one way to grow.\n\nYou’ve got to do it.\n\nEvery little bit, you’ve got to do it, do it, do it, do it\n\nAnd when you’re through, you can know who did it\n\nFor you did it, you did it, you did it.\n\nMusic and Lyrics by Fred M. Rogers. © McFeely-Rogers Foundation.\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nYou used to creep and crawl real well,\n\nBut then you learned to walk real well.\n\nThere was a time you’d coo and cry,\n\nBut then you learned to talk and, my!\n\nYou almost always try.\n\nYou almost always do your best.\n\nI like the way you’re growing up.\n\nIt’s fun, that’s all\n\nCHORUS\n\nYou’re growing, you’re growing,\n\nYou’re growing in and out.\n\nYou’re growing, you’re growing,\n\nYou’re growing all about.\n\nYour hands are getting bigger now.\n\nYour arms and legs are longer now.\n\nYou even sense your insides grow\n\nWhen Mom and Dad refuse you, So\n\nYou’re learning how to wait now.\n\nIt’s great to hope and wait somehow.\n\nI like the way you’re growing up.\n\nIt’s fun, that’s all.\n\nCHORUS\n\nYour friends are getting better now,\n\nThey’re better every day somehow.\n\nYou used to stay at home and play\n\nBut now you even play away.\n\nYou do important things now.\n\nYour friends and you do big things now.\n\nI like the way you’re growing up.\n\nIt’s fun, that’s all.\n\nCHORUS\n\nSomeday you’ll be a grown-up, too\n\nAnd have some children grow up, too.\n\nThen you can love them in and out\n\nAnd tell them stories all about\n\nThe times when you were their size,\n\nThe times when you found great surprise\n\nIn growing up. And they will sing\n\nIt’s fun, that’s all\n\nCHORUS\n\nMusic and Lyrics by Fred M. Rogers. © McFeely-Rogers Foundation.\n\nAll Rights Reserved."
