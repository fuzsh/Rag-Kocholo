        "text": "When I talk about flooding to residents from Robbins, a Chicago suburb, they want solutions that fix flooding AND catalyze multi-generational leadership, create economic opportunities, address food injustice and much more to create a thriving community.\n\nThat’s because urban flooding is a quality-of-life issue resulting from land-use decisions rooted in racist practices and grounded in capitalism. Putting in new pipes alone won’t undo these problems.\n\nIncreased development (i.e., more pavement) and intensified storms because of climate change contribute to increased flooding. Communities of color face worse impacts. And they’re best positioned to design the solutions.\n\nMarginalized communities face more damage because redlining forced them to live in the region’s lowest point, which were previously wetlands. Naturally, stormwater pools there. This, coupled with delayed sewer system maintenance and undersized pipes, lead to worse flooding.\n\nAnalysis of flood damage payouts by the Center for Neighborhood Technology from 2007 to 2016, show that 87% of flood claim payouts went to communities of color in Chicago.\n\nThe deluge in the city in 2023 led to the Federal Emergency Management Agency setting up recovery centers throughout the South and West sides and in the west and south suburbs, because those areas suffered huge losses and are still recovering.\n\nFlooding impacts don’t happen in a vacuum. Regional leaders designed these communities using development strategies motivated by racially biased economic benefits, such as tax incentives for corporations, the privatization of social safety measures and a polluting, industrial mono-economy. Because of this, when residents spend money, very little is recirculated to support community wealth building.\n\nPeople lost financial security when deindustrialization led to job loss. So, when they experience flooding — which occurs frequently because of those land-use decisions — residents have fewer finances to recover. Instead, the industrial legacy of pollution led to worse health outcomes, further degrading their financial resiliency. These cumulative impacts reduce people’s quality of life.\n\nHow do we address these quality-of-life issues? Community organizing.\n\nResidents collectively amplify their ideas to government leaders. Decision-makers listen and redirect funding to technical firms that are committed to working WITH resident leadership to solve flooding AND other cumulative impacts. In Chicago’s south suburbs, for example, CNT collaborated with residents to create the Urban Flooding Baseline tool, which mapped flooding risks and impacts with community knowledge at its center. They also participated in our Civic Innovation Hub leadership development program. Programs like these build community power in Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit and elsewhere.\n\nResidents advocate that government leaders should invest in gray stormwater infrastructure that builds community wealth: through local procurement and entrepreneurship opportunities. Investors can fund training programs with direct-hire pipelines by firms for gainful employment. Firms can work with community members and municipal staff to locate, design, install and maintain public sites for green stormwater infrastructure.\n\nFor example, at schools, students can participate in rain garden designs. In Robbins, residents noted that local youth could maintain sites and sell vegetables to fill grocery stores and the youth programming gap. Investors and government programs can finance local organizations to administer these programs.\n\nTo be sure, government leaders face many real conditions that seem to limit the holistic solutions, such as zoning specifications, funding limitations or legal barriers. But those are human-built problems. With community organizing, proper investment and technical expertise together, these challenges can be undone and overcome to better serve communities."
