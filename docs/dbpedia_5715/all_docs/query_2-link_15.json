Place-name aliases allow you to associate names of well-known places with street addresses—for example, the names of museums, hospitals, or landmarks. When geocoding an address, the place-name alias table is consulted first. If a place-name is found, the street address from the place-name alias table is geocoded. Similarly, alternate names can be defined for features, such as streets or cities, in the reference data. When geocoding an address, the alternate name table is also searched to find potential candidates where streets or cities have more than one name.\n\nGet the data\n\nThe data for this tutorial is available for download on arcgis.com.\n\nGo to the item description web page of the geocoding tutorial data on arcgis.com.\n\nClick Open > Download, and save the file locally.\n\nUnzip the downloaded file.\n\nCreate an address locator that uses alternate names and place-name aliases\n\nIn this task, you'll create a new address locator that uses alternate street names and place-name aliases. You'll then use it in ArcMap to find addresses.\n\nIn ArcCatalog, browse to the Geocoding folder containing the Atlanta geodatabase.\n\nRight-click in the empty space of the Contents tab inside the Geocoding folder, and click New > Address Locator.\n\nThe Create Address Locator dialog box appears.\n\nOn the Create Address Locator dialog box, click the Browse button next to the Address Locator Style text box.\n\nThe Select Address Locator Style dialog box appears.\n\nChoose the US Address - Dual Ranges address style.\n\nClick OK.\n\nClick the Browse button next to the Reference Data text box to open the Reference Data dialog box.\n\nBrowse to the Atlanta file geodatabase, choose the streets feature class, and click Add.\n\nOn the Create Address Locator dialog box, click the arrow under the Role column heading and choose Primary Table.\n\nRepeat steps 6 and 7, but this time browse to and add the altname table in the Atlanta geodatabase.\n\nClick the arrow under the Role column heading for the altname table and choose Alternate Name Table.\n\nThe Field Map section should be completed automatically. If not, select the appropriate field in the reference data for each field. It is essential that the JoinID fields for the Primary Table and Alternate Name Table are mapped properly; if they aren't, follow these substeps:\n\nClick the arrow under the Alias Name column heading for the Primary Table:Altname JoinID field and choose streets:JOINID.\n\nClick the arrow for the Alternate Name Table:JoinID field and choose altname:JOINID.\n\nThe JOINID field in the altname table and the JOINID field in the streets feature class are used to relate the records in the altname table to the records in the streets feature class.\n\nRepeat steps 6 and 7, but this time browse to and add the altcity table in the Atlanta geodatabase.\n\nClick the arrow under the Role column heading for the altname table and choose Alternate City Name Table.\n\nThe Field Map section should be completed automatically. If not, select the appropriate field in the reference data for each field. It is essential that the JoinID fields for the Primary Table and Alternate City Name Table are mapped properly; if they aren't, follow these substeps:\n\nClick the arrow under the Alias Name column heading for the Primary Table:City Altname JoinID field and choose streets:JOINID.\n\nClick the arrow for the Alternate City Name Table:JoinID field and choose altcity:CITYID.\n\nThe CITYID field in the altcity table and the CITYID field in the streets feature class are used to relate the records in the altcity table to the records in the streets feature class.\n\nRepeat steps 6 and 7, but this time browse to and add the place_aliases table in the Atlanta geodatabase.\n\nClick the arrow under the Role column heading for the place_aliases table and choose Alias Table.\n\nThe field mapping for the place_aliases table should be completed automatically. If not, select the appropriate field in the reference data for each address locator field. For the field named Alias Table:Alias, click the arrow under the Alias Name column heading and choose place_aliases:NAME. This is the field that contains the names of the places you can use to geocode.\n\nNext, you'll set the path for the output address locator.\n\nClick the Browse button next to the Output Address Locator text box.\n\nThe Output Address Locator dialog box appears.\n\nBrowse to the Geocoding folder containing the Atlanta geodatabase, type Atlanta_AltName as the address locator name, and click Save to accept the change and close the dialog box.\n\nClick OK to start the process of creating the address locator.\n\nWhen the process finishes, the new Atlanta_AltName address locator appears in the Geocoding folder alongside the Atlanta file geodatabase.\n\nClose ArcCatalog.\n\nYou can now use this address locator to find where an address is located on a map.\n\nFind locations using alternate street names, alternate city names, and place-name aliases\n\nIn this task, you'll use the Atlanta_AltName locator you just created to find addresses.\n\nOpen a new map document in ArcMap.\n\nAdd the streets feature class from the Atlanta geodatabase to your map.\n\nClick the Find button on the Tools toolbar.\n\nOn the Find dialog box, click the Locations tab.\n\nClick the Browse button next to the Choose an address locator drop-down box.\n\nThe Add Locator dialog box opens.\n\nBrowse to the Geocoding folder, choose the Atlanta_AltName locator, and click Add.\n\nA street may have more than one name. For example, Atlanta Blvd is an alternate name for Old 10th St NE in the Atlanta database. With the Atlanta_AltName address locator, 30 Old 10th St NE and 30 Atlanta Blvd will both find the same location.\n\nType 30 Old 10th St NE Atlanta in the Full Address text box and click Find to search for candidates.\n\nRight-click the candidate in the candidate list and click Add Point.\n\nA graphic point representing the address's location appears on the map.\n\nType 30 Atlanta Blvd Atlanta in the Full Address text box and click Find to search for candidates.\n\nRight-click the found candidate and click Flash.\n\nYou can see that both addresses are matched to the same location on the map.\n\nWhen searching for an address, the city name or neighborhood name within the city could be used to locate the address. For example, Sherwood Forest is a neighborhood within the city of Atlanta that is listed in the alternate city name table in the Atlanta database. With the Atlanta_Altname address locator, 192 Little John Trl NE, Atlanta and 192 Little John Trl NE, Sherwood Forest will both find the same location.\n\nType 192 Little John Trl NE, Atlanta in the Full Address text box and click Find to search for candidates.\n\nRight-click the candidate in the candidate list and click Add Point.\n\nA graphic point representing the address's location appears on the map.\n\nType 192 Little John Trl NE, Sherwood Forest in the Full Address text box and click Find to search for candidates.\n\nRight-click the found candidate and click Flash.\n\nYou can see that both addresses are matched to the same location on the map.\n\nIn addition to geocoding addresses, you can also geocode place-names that have been defined in the place_aliases table.\n\nType Atlanta Market in the Full Address text box and click Find to search for candidates.\n\nRight-click the first found candidate and click Add Point.\n\nThe location of the hospital appears on the map as if you had typed its complete address.\n\nClick Cancel to close the Find dialog box.\n\nCreating locators that use alternate names and place-name aliases is beneficial for people who know a landmark's name but not its address. It also helps in situations where a street or feature has more than one name."
