        "text": "Neighborhood Councils advocate on issues like homelessness, housing, land use, emergency preparedness, public safety, parks, transportation, and sustainability. They also provide local expertise and a local voice on the delivery of City services to their communities.\n\nEach Council holds monthly meetings of their full board, in addition to monthly Committee meetings with a more targeted focus on key issues or projects, like public safety, transportation, homelessness, or land use. All meetings are open to the public.\n\nWHO CAN PARTICIPATE?\n\nAnother unique feature of LA’s Neighborhood Council system is its broad, inclusive definition of stakeholdership. Unlike other government officials, who are elected by residential stakeholders of the area they serve, Neighborhood Councils are open to participation by anyone who is part of the fabric of daily life in a community. This includes those who live, work, or own property or a business there.\n\nAlso included are “community interest stakeholders,” who have some type of ongoing, substantial involvement within a Council’s boundaries, such as students of a local school, or the congregation of a local church.\n\nBoard members – and candidates, and voters – need not be US citizens or legal US residents to qualify. Participation is also open to the formerly incarcerated.\n\nWHAT DO NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCILS DO & HOW ARE THEY FUNDED?\n\nSince Neighborhood Councils hold their meetings in the communities they serve, they are an important avenue for public participation in the City of Los Angeles, and give the members of a community the chance to have input on decisions that affect their quality of life, and the services they receive from the City.\n\nNeighborhood Councils play an advisory role in the Los Angeles municipal government. They gather, vet, debate, and come to a consensus on matters that impact City life and policy, and deliver their official stance on these issues in letters called “Community Impact Statements” (CIS), which are shared with City decision-makers, such as the Mayor, City Council, or City Departments such as City Planning. The Neighborhood Council may also attend meetings of these decision-making officials in person, to advocate for their board’s position on a matter. Neighborhood Councils members take action as a board, and not as individuals, so they do not take an official position without a majority vote first.\n\nNeighborhood Councils receive public funds of about $32,000 each year to support their activities. Each member takes state-mandated training on the ethical management of public funds, and the funds must be allocated by board consensus. The funds may be used to create events and programs that respond to community needs, or spent to advocate for issues that the board cares about such as crime prevention, better roads and streets, safe spaces for children, help for the homeless, arts, or local economic development.\n\nSome recent Neighborhood Council success stories are highlighted at EmpowerLA.org/art-exhibit. Click the graphics to learn details about successful projects and programs for land use, parks and public spaces, green living, town halls, seniors, youth, and more.\n\nWHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT OF NEIGHBORHOOD EMPOWERMENT?\n\nThe City of Los Angeles Department of Neighborhood Empowerment is the support agency for LA’s Neighborhood Council system citywide. The Department is sometimes called “EmpowerLA” because of its stated mission to empower Angelenos through civic engagement and community advocacy, via the Neighborhood Council system and other outreach programs and initiatives.\n\nNeighborhood Empowerment is not the only City department providing support for LA’s Neighborhood Councils, though we serve as the primary coordinator of these services. The Office of the City Attorney has a dedicated Neighborhood Council Advice Division that advises Councils and board members on legal issues, and the City Clerk is in charge of administering both Funding and Elections for the Neighborhood Council system. In addition, the Board of Neighborhood Commissioners serves as the official oversight body for the Neighborhood Council system. Commissioners are drawn from different areas of the City and are appointed by the Mayor.\n\nGET INVOLVED WITH YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL\n\nSubscribe to get Neighborhood Council agendas by email:\n\ntiny.cc/NCagendas\n\nSee upcoming Neighborhood Council meetings\n\nTo see when your local Neighborhood Council holds its monthly board meeting, select your Council from the list at EmpowerLA.org/councils to open our Department webpage for that Council. Details for their monthly board meeting are in the top right corner, as is a link to that Council’s website. The Council’s own website will have further details about when and where their Committees meet. (Don’t know which Neighborhood Council you belong to? Enter your address in the search bar at neighborhoodinfo.lacity.org to find out.)\n\nTo see all Neighborhood Council board and committee meetings across the City by date, visit this page: LAcity.org/government/meeting-calendars/neighborhood-council-meetings.\n\nClick the meeting title to view meeting address, time, and agenda.\n\nSee what position Neighborhood Councils are taking on issues before the City Council\n\nThe Community Impact Statements (CIS) issued by Neighborhood Councils are official letters stating the position that board has voted to take on City issues. CIS are one of the primary means by which LA’s Neighborhood Councils fulfill their advisory role in the City government. CIS letters get added to the file that the City maintains on each issue, and are considered by the City Council as part of their discussion of an issue.\n\nCIS can be viewed by the public on the City Clerk’s Council File Management System (CFMS) – a comprehensive index of all matters that are or have been considered and acted upon by the Los Angeles City Council. This index can be searched by keyword or Council File number – view it at CityClerk.LACity.org/lacityclerkconnect/index.cfm. CFMS also gives you an option to subscribe to get email notices whenever a file you’re interested in is updated."
