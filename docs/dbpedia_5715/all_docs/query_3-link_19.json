        "text": "There is perhaps a widely-held belief that maps exist to reflect reality, to faithfully represent the places and spaces in which we go about our daily lives. We rely on their accuracy to show us the way if ever we are lost, and we put a great deal of trust in the information they offer. However, just as anyone who studies documentary film making quickly learns, the subjectivity of the author (or cartographer in this case) cannot help but form part of what they produce – no matter their intentions at the outset.\n\nTo some extent, Google’s actions are understandable. Like most who seek to map our world, unnamed or ill-defined areas on a map create an uneasy void. This is doubly the case for Google, who monetise (incredibly successfully) the content of their map through their search and advertising business model. And as cartographers, they are not alone in facing pressure (whether internal or external) to have their map reflect the interests of a stakeholder – an example closer to home for me, Legible London, adopted the village name of “Fitzrovia” within the City of Westminster even though you would have had a hard time locating it on any other map of the capital. A similar request from a ’business improvement district’ to christen another part of the city as “Midtown” was rejected, however.\n\nFor most of us, the best advice seems to be to simply adjust our critical filters and apply a little more scepticism to how the world around us is represented in the digital realm. Just because it is on the map, that shouldn’t supplant the evidence sourced through our own eyes and experiences."
