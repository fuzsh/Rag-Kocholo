        "text": "Do you know why Goose Hollow is called Goose Hollow? Or where the name Montavilla comes from? Adam Aleksic, a high school senior out of Albany, New York, does.\n\nAleksic loves etymology. He has a website dedicated to his love of words where he goes by the name “Etymology Nerd.”\n\nRight now Aleksic is working on a project on city etymologies and one of the cities he’s turned his etymology-loving eye towards is Portland.\n\n“I found this information from various sites online (Wikipedia, Mental Floss, city records),” Aleksic said over Twitter, about his sources, “and a couple times I had to call local libraries/information centers to confirm.”\n\nHere are some of the interesting stories behind Portland’s most-unique neighborhood names that Aleksic has found.\n\nGoose Hollow: According to Aleksic, “in 1875, there was a legal dispute over goose ownership in the commons here.”\n\nBrooklyn: “Originally ‘Brookland,’ due to large number of creeks in the area,” according to Aleksic, “but as a lot of people moved in the nickname ‘Brooklyn’ took over.”\n\nMontavilla: While you might think this is a Spanish word, Aleksic says it is in fact a “syllabic abbreviation of ‘Mount Tabor Village.’”\n\nMount Tabor: The lofty name of this high up neighborhood was, according to Aleksic, “named by local Methodists after the site in Israel where the transfiguration of Jesus was reported.”"
