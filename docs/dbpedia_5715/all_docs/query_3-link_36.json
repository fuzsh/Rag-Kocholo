        "text": "Article content\n\nEdmonton’s most populous neighbourhood has unveiled its choice for a new name.\n\nThe Oliver Community League on Tuesday announced that pending city council approval the central neighbourhood will be known as Wîhkwêntôwin (we-kwen-to-win), Cree for “a circle of friends.”\n\nTuesday’s announcement was the latest step in a years-long process to rename the community after debate over the racist legacy of its namesake, settler politician Frank Oliver. The name was given by Elder Jerry Saddleback and has been approved by the city’s naming committee.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles by David Staples, Keith Gerein and others, Oilers news from Cult of Hockey, Ask EJ Anything features, the Noon News Roundup and Under the Dome newsletters.\n\nUnlimited online access to Edmonton Journal and 15 news sites with one account.\n\nEdmonton Journal ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSupport local journalism.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles by David Staples, Keith Gerein and others, Oilers news from Cult of Hockey, Ask EJ Anything features, the Noon News Roundup and Under the Dome newsletters.\n\nUnlimited online access to Edmonton Journal and 15 news sites with one account.\n\nEdmonton Journal ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSupport local journalism.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nOliver Community League president Imran Ahmad said the league sought input from every resident in the neighbourhood and undertook years of consultations before settling on the new name.\n\n“The name change is a big moment,” Ahmad said during the ceremony at the Oliver Exchange building. “I think it’s a step in terms of reconciliation and recognizing the land we’re on.”\n\nHe nevertheless hoped little would change about the community he calls home.\n\n“In terms of our day-to-day, I still live in Wîhkwêntôwin the same as I did yesterday, I still go to work here.”\n\nLocated west of Downtown between 109 Street and 124 Streets, more Edmontonians call Oliver home than any other single neighbourhood. It is one of the densest neighbourhoods in North America, according to past community league president Robyn Paches, and with towers going up in every direction, one of the city’s fastest growing.\n\nThe community was initially called the West End before being rechristened Oliver in 1937, four years after Oliver’s death.\n\nOliver was a newspaperman and politician who arrived at Fort Edmonton in 1867. He founded the settlement’s first newspaper, the Edmonton Bulletin, and was later elected as a member of Parliament. He served in Wilfrid Laurier’s cabinet as minister of the interior and superintendent of Indian Affairs, where he vehemently opposed non-British and non-white immigration. At one point, he drafted an order banning Black immigrants from entering the country, and also took racist positions regarding Ukrainians, Slavs, French Canadians and Asians.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAs a newspaper editor, Oliver pushed for First Nations reserves to be sold off and Métis lands to be surrendered for valueless “scrip.” The Oliver Act, which he introduced, allowed reserve lands to be expropriated and Indigenous reserves in or near towns to be removed. He advocated for the removal of the Papaschase band, which resided in what is now southeast Edmonton until the federal government evicted them and auctioned off the land.\n\nOliver was also an influential booster of Edmonton’s business and political interests and was key in winning support for naming the city the provincial capital. He also played a role in the development of the national parks system, and advocated against conscription during the First World War.\n\nThe most recent reappraisal of Oliver’s legacy began in 2017 amid protests around Canada’s 150th anniversary. In June 2020, the Oliver Community League formally asked the city to change its name, initiating a consultation campaign dubbed “Uncover Oliver.”\n\nSome viewed efforts to rename the community with skepticism. Then-Edmonton Journal columnist Paula Simons, for one, said removing Oliver’s name could let the city “off the hook” for its colonial past.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Oliver’s story is integral to the story of Edmonton, not in spite of his flaws, but because of them,” she wrote. “We’re a great multicultural city, built on a racist Imperial matrix. We can’t erase that fact. We have to recognize and confront it — and remembering Oliver helps do that.”\n\nPaches said the intent was not to whitewash the city’s history. Exploring Oliver’s legacy was a focus of the campaign, he said.\n\n“It was very educational-first — who was Frank Oliver, and what did he do? We want to make sure that we take that educational point moving forward.”\n\nAhmad doubted whether the name change would cause people to forget Oliver and what he stood for.\n\n“It’s not like we’re trying to hide it or anything,” he said. “The history is there, as Elder Saddleback mentioned.”\n\nThe league said it mailed consultation forms to every address in the community starting in 2022 asking if they supported a name change. Seventy per cent of respondents were in favour, with 30 per cent strongly supporting a change to an Indigenous name.\n\nThe process also included a renaming circle made up of Indigenous elders, leaders from the Chinese community and descendants of Black settlers. Paches said he’s proud of the process and thinks it can be “an example for the rest of the world.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“I don’t think we left any stone unturned,” he said.\n\nThe proposed name will go before the city’s executive committee Feb. 7, with debate before the full city council taking place Feb. 20.\n\nThe decision to rename specific buildings, businesses and institutions — including Oliver Arena, Oliver Pool, Oliver School and the Oliver Exchange — would be left with their respective decision makers, Ahmad said.\n\nPaches, for his part, said he hopes the idea of a neighbourhood as a “circle of friends” resonates with others as it has with him.\n\n“I was a small town guy, came to the city for the first time when I was 18. I didn’t have anybody, know anybody, and this community really got around me and I have a wonderful support network now. And I think that’s the lived experience of a lot of people here.”\n\njwakefield@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/jonnywakefield\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
