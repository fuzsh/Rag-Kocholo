        "text": "Tony Gonzalez is set to guest star in the CBS comedy “The Neighborhood,” Variety has learned exclusively.\n\nGonzalez will appear in the seventh episode of the show’s sixth season, which kicked off on Feb. 12. Gonzalez will play Derrick, Calvin’s (Cedric the Entertainer) new physical therapist. The character description states, “Derrick is a former pro-football player who helped Dave (Max Greenfield) with a previous injury. Calvin is eager to impress Derrick, but when Derrick comes to give Calvin PT at home, it’s much more painful than Calvin anticipated. Derrick needs Dave’s help to inspire Calvin through his painful healing process.”\n\nGonzalez is considered one of the greatest tight ends in NFL history. He played in the league for 17 seasons, primarily for the Kansas City Chiefs and then for the Atlanta Falcons. He is the NFL’s all-time-leader in touchdowns and yards by a tight end as well as consecutive starts and Pro Bowl Appearances by a tight end. After retiring in 2013, he began working as an analyst for “The NFL Today” and other NFL programming at CBS. He currently co-hosts “Thursday Night Football” for Amazon Prime Video.\n\nAs an actor, Gonzalez appeared in multiple episodes of the long-running CBS drama series “NCIS.” He has also appeared in films like “XXX: The Return of Xander Cage” and “The Underdoggs.”\n\nHe is repped by UTA, SMAC Entertainment, and Jill Fritzo PR.\n\n“The Neighborhood” has typically begun airing new episodes in the fall, but production was impacted on this and virtually all broadcast series by the combined writers’ and actors’ strikes that shutdown Hollywood throughout most of 2023."
