You New Yorkers know all of these already, and spit them out swiftly on the daily. Those who don’t live here don’t know what we’re saying…so here it is. Acronyms of NYC: The Neighborhood Nicknames edition:\n\nUWS: Upper West Side. The ‘hood that’s full of history, old people, families and rich people. Oh, and me.\n\nLES: Lower East Side. The hippest of the neighborhoods in Manhattan. SO MANY GOOD BARS AND RESTAURANTS AND COOL GRAFFITI.\n\nTriBeCa: Triangle Below Canal Street. Yep, look on a map. It’s literally a triangle. Taylor Swift and Target live here.\n\nDUMBO: Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass. Very trendy. I hear the toilets churn the opposite way here…\n\nFiDi: Financial District. The boringest of locations. Maybe a place to find your future Wall Street husband or wife – LOLZ.\n\nSoHo: South of Houston Street. SoHo is home of shopping and art. Oh, and the Nespresso cafe where you can get a free coffee – tastes better because it’s free.\n\nNoHo: North of Houston Street. Keep in mind Houston Street is not pronounced like the Texan city, it’s “How-stin.”\n\nNoLita: North of Little Italy. This is where we get a little granular in terms of neighborhood identification. Seriously?\n\nNoMad: North of Madison Square Park. I don’t know what to tell you, I didn’t name these ‘hoods!\n\nUES: Upper East Side. This is the Paris of Manhattan. So fancy.\n\nThere you have it. Are there any other neighborhoods that need identifying? Maybe there’s a new one I haven’t heard of yet – SoTiS (South of Times Square)? Or maybe EvBeMyApt (Everything Below My Apartment)?\n\nLet me know!\n\nHeyooo - I’m Mary and I’m here to show you the real, liveable, New York City - the one you’ll be excited to share with your friends. See what’s truly AWESOME to eat and do in NYC, no matter what your budget. Plus, I’m always on the lookout for noteworthy things to do when I travel to other cities around the world. So get out of Times Square and discover something cool with me!\n\nP.S. - all opinions are my own"
