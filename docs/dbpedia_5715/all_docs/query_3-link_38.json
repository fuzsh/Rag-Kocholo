        "text": "Introduction\n\nDepressive mood may impair an aged adult’s functional ability and thus their frailty—their multisystem reduction in physiological capacity. Place effect studies using multilevel and/or spatial modeling aim at informing researchers how an aged adult’s area of residence influences their health outcomes. Given the complex nature of trying to determine how the individual and his/her environment interact, attempts to inform research on how context matters use many statistical and theoretical assumptions. When attempting to investigate place effects, researchers are usually bounded by the availability of data—measures of health outcomes, sample sizes, and predefined nesting units. Some investigators make use of predefined nesting units (e.g., counties, tracts) to measure individuals’ social and/or physical environment. Some of them label their non-theory driven geographical polygons as “neighborhoods.” Using the term neighborhood during the interpretations of results in quantitative research may affect the level of meaning assigned to the study’s findings—where using the term lends more face validity to the research. Our article substantively contributes to place effect literature that focuses on the ageing population by offering a detailed discussion on the treatment of the word “neighborhood” in studies who investigate depression symptomatology using the complete or abbreviated version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) instrument with samples from both urban and non-urban areas.\n\nDefining “Neighborhood”\n\nUnderstanding frailty requires that an aged adult’s psycho-social interactions with his/her environment be understood. Investigating context’s effects on mental health requires the production of place measures. The creation of place measures demands that researchers identify a set of geographical boundaries to identify a place. For example, a hypothetical study on how an area’s criminal activity affects an individual’s depression symptomatology would require that places be given a score on some “criminal activity” scale. In order to give a place a criminal activity score, the researcher must determine what geographical boundaries constitute a place. That is, criteria for determining a place’s geographical boundaries would have to be (either explicitly or implicitly) chosen. Consequently, the need for geoboundarization (i.e., the act of determining geographic boundaries) mandates that the investigator make implicit or explicit theoretical decisions of what a person perceives as their area of residence. Investigations on mental health with United States (US) samples typically make use of US Census Bureau geographical units (e.g., counties, tracts). These methods have existed for many decades (1) and remain utilized as we move towards developing a clearer understanding of the role that geographical dependence plays in mental health outcomes (2).\n\nThe spatial units created by the geoboundarization process necessary for the production of place level measures create another condition; researchers must stamp the boundarized geospatial unit with a label. The labeling of geospatial units affords investigators a greater proficiency in communicating their findings on how place affects the individual. Some investigators unsuitably make use of the word neighborhood to label their geospatial units. We say unsuitable because the term currently possess a high but as of yet a scientifically difficult to define degree of significance—a condition which may change in the future after more investigations are done to determine what a neighborhood is and how it can be geographically boundarized. For now and because the meaning of neighborhood is given by its use and context, we argue selected geographic units should be referred to by their origin-assigned label. By origin-assigned we mean that a geographic unit should be referred to using the label that the polygon was assigned by the creator. For example, if the US Census creates a polygon and labels it “tract,” then all subsequent references to that polygon should label the geographic entity a tract.\n\nWhy should aging and frailty researchers care about the geographical boundarization and its subsequent labeling? The reduction in life-space mobility in the aged may make their frailty status more vulnerable to environmental effects. Advancing our understanding of how place affects their frailty requires that we advance our discourse on the proper use and meaning of terms.\n\nDiscussions on the production of social space (3) and geoboundarization of place have been going on for many decades (4). Early and current theorists have posited that human behavior is influenced by the context that the individual perceives as well as the social structures beyond his/her perceptions. This is why attempts to define the term neighborhood abound in the literature. Recent theoretical perspectives explain neighborhood as a geographical construct of place—where the term evokes images of an environment where local members share a common sense of place. It may be the term neighborhood has a deep psychosocial meaning for many, but the meaning of what a neighborhood is has yet to be scientifically defined—in particular, how neighborhoods should be geoboundarized. We hope that if research consistently adapts the origin-assigned labeling approach, we will continue to have a clearer discussion of how readily available spatial units capture (or fail to encompass) areas where individuals share a common sense of place.\n\nBecause its’ theoretical conceptualization are still bearing out, the operationalization, and thus measurement of neighborhood remains empirically unattainable. Despite these limitations, the recent proliferation of articles investigating the effects of sociophysical contexts on health have benefited from using the term neighborhood to make their arguments more compelling and easier to understand. Some literature makes use of the term with little attempt at a critical review of its meaning. Clapp and Wang (5) explain that a lack in definitional precision may occur because “the ordinary language definition is considered so compelling as to require little elaboration.” By way of example, when talking about “context” or “tract” effects on depression symptomatology, arguments could be rendered uninformative, weak, and/or confusing. In contrast, using the word neighborhood strengthens the flow of the prose and gives the feeling that greater insights—than those actually afforded by the research—can be derived from the findings. This is all possible because neighborhood is loaded with meaning and serves as a powerful rhetorical construct with intuitive (albeit not as of yet scientific) meaning.\n\nPhysically bounded spatial units, referred to as neighborhoods in some research, vary in their geographical scope and conceptual meaning. The dearth of attention given to this crucial matter focuses on how selected place-measures affect individual-level outcomes. Since the gold standard for defining a neighborhood is yet to exist, their geoboundarization ranges on various dimensions. For example, as described in detail elsewhere (6), neighborhoods may be defined by: personal views (e.g., place attachment); functional views (e.g., public transportation); social life views (e.g., social interaction); physical views (e.g., sidewalks); economic views (e.g., homeownership); or political views (e.g., organizations); and we add, policy views (e.g., school districts). Because a discourse on how neighborhoods should be geoboundarized has yet to become a matter of common academic debate, advances in developing a precise scientific meaning of place effects remain hindered.\n\nAs is clear from the previous paragraph, the rapid growth and continuing interest in neighborhood effects on health has not eradicated all methodological concerns. Because the widely used abstract neighborhood remains undefined, its geographical delineation remains muddled in non-theory driven polygons. Advances in the field of mental health, have generally shown that areas with poor-quality housing, few resources, and unsafe conditions can impose stress that can lead to depression (7). In general, sociophysical environments have been found to impact individual-level outcomes—an influence that exists above and beyond the effects of the individual’s own personal attributes. How we control the definition of context will ultimately bring into being how we define place-on-individual problems, design studies, and diagnose interventions to moderate the onset of disabling frailty. The main goal of this project is to echo previous requests (8) to increase definitional precision when investigating and labeling place and its effects on mental health outcomes. Our manuscript advances the efforts of others (73) by focusing on the use and meaning of the word neighborhood. To validate these arguments, we conduct a narrow literature review of place effects on depression symptomatology in the aged.\n\nPlace Effects on Mental Health\n\nA complete review of the literature on place and mental health can be found in Appendix A. In general, place effect studies range over a wide variety of study designs, geographical units, and area measurements. While there is some evidence that context affects health (25), there are some reasons why findings on place effects on mental well-being remain somewhat inconclusive. The inconclusiveness of existing research is in part due to the fact that cross study comparisons are difficult (if not impossible) to do. Cross study comparability on place effect studies is difficult to accomplish for two main reasons: (1) the different geographical polygons employed to measure place; and (2) the various forms of statistical methods employed to account for how macro-level factors influence micro-level outcomes. Within our literature review, the majority of studies do use the same geographical polygon: this leads to a series of more complicated questions (discussed in closing)—like, even if cross-study comparability is possible, how will it benefit us if we fail to capture a “true” measure of what a person perceives as his/her neighborhood? This study focuses on the first challenge and proposes a solution that can be accomplished through greater definitional precision—a step we hope will mitigate the plethora of issues faced by place effect investigations.\n\nCurrent Study\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to discuss implications from labeling arbitrarily defined geographical polygons as neighborhoods and to provide evidence from a narrow review of literature on the aged and depression symptomatology. We focus our study on the aged because their population merits special attention given the importance that frailty in the ageing population continues to exert in shaping our society. Please note that the “age 65” threshold is used because it is the most widely used demarcation for labeling somebody as an older adult in the US. Some have argued that it may have little social meaning for many non-U.S. nations and that the 65-age-threshold will steadily become less relevant as retirement ages fluctuate and life expectancies change (26).\n\nIn our literature review, we focused on studies which investigate depression symptomatology because some have argued that depression is “the most frequent cause of emotional suffering in later life” and “significantly decreases quality of life in older adults” (27). Depression influences health outcomes beyond mental well-being. For example, some have linked it to higher rates of mortality (28). Others have recently shown that including environmental factors is important in such studies because areas may significantly affect depression in people whose activity space is limited to their area of residence (29). Depressive mood is important for mental capacity and physical activity—both of which play a key role in an aged adult’s frailty status.\n\nWhile other depression screening instruments exist, we are only interested in articles where the CES-D scale is used. We focused on the CES-D complete or partial measure because it has been administered to aged adults around the world (30), has been validated with various populations (31), has been show to be reliable (31), and has been found to provide valuable insights into aged adults mental wellbeing.\n\nWe have limited our study to articles using samples from the US. This means we have excluded some high quality and relevant research (34). We decided to limit our investigation to studies using U.S. samples to facilitate the discussion of geographical polygons. That is, by only reviewing studies using US data, we can more readily critique the label used in referencing the selected geospatial unit in contrast to available geographical polygons in the area of study. The inclusion of other nations would necessitate an extensive discussion of how the various geographical entities vary by location.\n\nOur call for greater definitional precision is aimed not at creating or eliminating controversy, but rather to transfer the discourse in place effects, aging, frailty, and mental health to a more appropriate stage: Where the substance of an investigation is not muddled by the misappropriation of terms. We are not aware of any articles where the definition of neighborhood is discussed and where a review focusing on how the term neighborhood is defined in mental health literature of older adults where the CES-D scale is used is given simultaneously. Our investigation fills this gap by first discussing implications from labeling geographical polygons as neighborhoods and by providing an example to validate our arguments by systematically identifying scientific articles published between 2000 and 2012 and empirically researching if and how the term “neighborhood” is defined.\n\nMethods\n\nThe initial inclusion of articles for review followed three basic requirements. The first criterion for inclusion was that the item be published between January 1, 2000 and September 30, 2012. Articles meeting the first criterion were then selected if the terms “neighborhood” or its alternate spelling “neighbourhood”, and “mental health,” and/or “mental well-being,” and/or “CES-D” appeared in the title and/or the abstract. We only included articles published using the English language, which were peer-reviewed, and only used US samples in the analysis. The last selection criterion was used in order to reduce the amount of polygon comparisons made in our literature review—since compatibility of geographical units across nations would require an extensive discussion. From those being screened for relevance, we exclude all the articles where a neighborhood measure was not used as a key variable in the equation. This means all non-quantitative studies were excluded. Since all the aforementioned procedures produced a host of results, we limited our review to articles that only used a sample from our main population of interest: those age 65 and beyond. All others were disqualified from the abstract review stage.\n\nThe article search started with PubMed, after selecting for all the criteria outlined above, our initial search yielded over 102 articles. Their abstracts were reviewed by one reviewer. Any abstracts that showed potential for inclusion (i.e., met all the criteria) were retained for a full review. In order to insure full coverage, the reference sections of the full review articles were searched to identify potential articles for inclusion. The abstracts, derived from the reference section search in the initial full review sample, were evaluated for inclusion in the review. While using search engines to seek out desired articles, the abstracts in list of related articles, provided by search engines, were also searched to seek out potential candidates for inclusion.\n\nThese exhaustive procedures produced a total of more than 200 articles. An abstract review condensed the sample to undergo full review to 98. From these, thirteen of the articles used children or youth, another sixty-three were made up of studies with samples of adults (aged 21 and below 65), and only twenty contained analysis with aged study participants. From the aged articles 10 were excluded because they either excluded the CES-D scale or omitted the inclusion of a context-level measure (a list of all the 85 excluded articles is available from the author upon request). After completing a full review of the 98 articles, we ended up with a final sample of 11 articles to include in our literature review. Articles from the final sample of 11 are summarized in . The table provides information on how neighborhood is defined, which spatial units are used, what context measures are employed in the analysis, and a brief description of the key findings on CES-D.\n\nTable 1\n\nStudyUnitsModeling and SoftwareTreatment of “Neighborhood”Context MeasuresCESD FindingsEverson-Rose et al. 20115,770 people nested in 82 blocks (people per block range from 19–186)Linear mixed-effects models with SAS V9.2Briefly defined and justified the use of term neighborhoodSocial: combined four measures of socioeconomic status to create one measureBlocks with higher socioeconomic rankings were found to have a direct relationship with depressive symptoms (CESD used to measure depressive symptoms for psychological distress)Gerst et al. 20111,875 people nested in 386 tracts aMultilevel models with HLM 6.04Defined and questioned use of neighborhood termSocial: Percentage of Mexican-American residentsAged Latino/a men in more ethnically homogenous tracts had fewer depressive symptoms; this effect was not significant for womenBrown et al. 2009a273 people nested in 273 blocks (one person per block)Structural equation modeling with AMOS 6Neither defined nor questioned the use of the term neighborhood until closingSocial: Perceived social support.

On the treatment of “neighborhood,” we find that most use the term liberally and give limited regard to how their geographical unit may play a role in their measure of environment. With regards to CES-D, we find that in general, macro-level measures on context instability (here broadly defined) are statistically related with an increase in depression symptomatology (the micro-level outcome of interest). In short, an aged adult’s environment may play a key role in how frailty operates.\n\nThe specific aim of our project was to offer a literature review on articles focusing on the aged, who use the CES-D scale, and account for context. In particular, our aim was to show how greater definitional precision in the labeling of context measures can improve how neighborhood is defined in scientific research. There are some limitations with our project. First, our final article sample for review may be considered by some as too narrow (although our criterion only provided such a number of cases). Second, selecting articles that investigate an aged population means we are neglecting to explore how researchers of non-aged populations treat/use/define the term neighborhood. Our use of a geographical section in the city of Galveston, Texas, U.S. no doubt leaves room for some criticisms (e.g., it is a island with a unique population and city layout). Our focus on CES-D means that we excluded the treatment of the term by all those who may be interested in investigations of other mental health measures or other ailments. Despite these limitations, we feel our project achieves its mission in delivering the clear message that context labeling needs to occur with greater care.\n\nOur article’s first substantive contribution to the literature is our detailed discussion on the treatment of the word “neighborhood” in studies who investigate depression symptomatology using the CES-D instrument with an aged population. Our discussion amounts to more than just a long grievance, we provide a comprehensive discussion on how the use of the term limits place effect research. In particular, we offer critiques which can serve future advances in theory. Our second substantive contribution is on briefly showing that in general, more place-level instability is associated with greater levels of depression symptomatology. We now extend our contributions to outline a future research agenda.\n\nFuture research should investigate the same topic but with different age populations and different mental health outcomes (60), including studies that account for physical environment macro-level measures (61). Researchers could also continue what others began long ago (58) and explore if/how initial tract homogeneity morphs into heterogeneity as populations within tract increase (62). Lastly, investigations on how various statistical approaches (e.g., aspatial clustering algorithms) can inform “neighborhood” boundarization should continue while being informed by theory (63).\n\nOver a decade ago, researchers with the Social Science Research Council concluded that there was “much to be learned about neighborhood effects from studies that use census-based sources of data.” In their report, researchers are advised to continue searching for “alternative procedures for measuring neighborhoods” (64). Most of our reviewed articles used census-based data or spatial units. Even with the large number of studies, our knowledge on the consequences of environmental conditions for older adult mental well-being remains limited. Place effect studies on the mental health of aged adults lack congruency in their definition and measure of social and physical environments.\n\nUsing the meaning-rich term “neighborhood” allows authors to make powerful arguments on how a selected environmental measure influences an individual’s mental health. We believe the use of term can at times be misleading. As was extensively discussed before, there is no agreed upon definition of what a neighborhood is—much less of what its geographical boundaries should be. Convincing arguments for the sensitivity of boundary definitions have been given elsewhere (65). Some have clearly shown that people vary in how they geographically boundarize their neighborhood (66). This is all further complicated by the fact that contexts may not affect all people in the same way—because people have different personality characteristics that allow them to adjust in different ways to challenging environments (7).\n\nVarious studies are exploring how people define their neighborhood. Early work on this topic found that when residents’ neighborhood boundary definitions are explored, the resulting geospatial units covered different spaces and created different social measures than did census-defined units (67). Articles advocating the use of a “bottom-up GIS” approach in defining a person’s neighborhood exist (68) and cutting edge “participatory photo mapping” techniques allowing for a transdisciplinary approach that integrates various digital tools with qualitative data to depict the complex nature of person’s neighborhood are advancing (69). Investigations from the phenomenological viewpoint have found that individual’s “cognitive maps” are not entirely fixed, but that they do share meaning with other geographically proximal residents (70). This line of research may be able to better validate appropriate geographical polygons, albeit proxy, for capturing a persons’ neighborhood. More research using alternative nesting units may help develop these methods into units that could be used in larger datasets and at a more practical level for research.\n\nA call for greater definitional precisions is more than just an argument on semantics. Moving place effect studies on aging and frailty away from inconclusiveness requires that researchers be clear on how their geographical boundarizations affect their macro-level measures. The point is that until a definition of neighborhood is settled, aggregate measures of contexts will have to be arbitrarily produced by a subjectively chosen geographical polygon. Our call for greater definitional precisions is a call for making sure that place effect publications explicitly state the logic (or necessity) for their chosen geographic unit—and that said geospatial unit be initially labeled with its origin assigned label. When we begin to outline a framework for what the differing geographic units mean in place effect research, we will begin to make cross study comparability a more beneficial enterprise for understanding frailty in the aged.\n\nHypotheses should be born out of theory, the credibility of which should not depend on how a key term is used (71). Our call for greater definitional precision is aimed at transferring the discourse in place effect and mental health to a more advance stage: Where the substance of an investigation is not muddled by the misappropriation of terms. We find that publications investigating place effects on the mental health (using CES-D measures) of the ageing population need greater definitional precision when labeling their selected geographical units.\n\nAppendix D\n\nTracts as Neighborhoods\n\nMost of the justification for using tracts as neighborhoods comes from a shortlist of articles and one book chapter. Some of the reviewed articles point to Subramanian et al. (44), where the author argues that when using area-based socioeconomic measures, “census tracts have been shown to be reasonable approximations for delineating neighborhoods” (Pg. 829). Subramanian et al. (44) in turn makes such a claim by citing Sampson et al. (12). However, Sampson et al. (12) point out census tracts “offer imperfect operational definitions of neighborhoods for research and policy.” Sampson et al. (12) even goes on to explain in the following sentence that this is the reason why researchers are interested in designing strategies for defining neighborhoods. From our reading, Sampson et al. (12) does not offer a blanket validation for calling tracts neighborhoods.\n\nThere are two widely used citations, within our list of reviewed articles, which are said to justify the use of tracts as neighborhoods. Even though the authors from both Krieger et al. (45) and Krieger et al. (46) never actually advocate the use the term neighborhood, they are widely cited as providing justification for labeling tracts as neighborhoods. In the first piece, the word neighborhood is only mentioned one time in the text—when discussing others work. Krieger and colleagues only use the term “area-based” measures when referring to their selected context measures (45). On the second publication, the word neighborhood is not mentioned in the text at all (46). In this latter piece, the authors’ again only use terms such as “census tract and block group measures” to identify their macro-level factors (46). Here again, cited work fails to lend justification in labeling tracts as neighborhoods.\n\nIn our reviewed articles, Diez-Roux et al. (47) is also credited with providing justification for calling tracts neighborhoods. The authors in this article explain that in their study, they found little difference between using census tracts or block-group measures (47). Again, the only time the term neighborhood is used in the text is in a footnote given for one of their figures (47). The authors interpret their findings using the “block-group” or “census tract” labels (47)—they never justify using the neighborhood label to refer to tracts. Another popular citation seen in our reviewed articles was Ricketts and Sawhill (48) who use tracts and make use of the word neighborhood extensively within their text. The only justification for why tracts are referred to as neighborhood is given in a footnote where they state that “as the best available statistical equivalent of a neighborhood, a tract is a small statistical subdivision of a county with generally stable boundaries and homogeneous population characteristics” (48). They do not provide citations in their footnote—nor do they reference any theoretical premises for why tract geographical boundaries should be referred to as neighborhoods.\n\nTienda (49) is also cited as a source that legitimizes the labeling of tracts as neighborhoods. Our reading of her piece however leads us to believe she was attempting to outline the complications with deciphering neighborhood effects. In particular, Tienda (49) makes it clear that using tracts as proxies to neighborhoods only means that researchers are measuring global characteristics of arbitrarily defined places. Tienda (49) points out that “interaction patterns” are what create neighborhoods, and that consequently, tracts as proxies to neighborhoods only capture a bounded-space that is unlikely to be defined in social terms—since the boundaries of the arbitrary geographical polygons are not determined by the social interactions within them. From our reading of Tienda (49), she does not offer a justification for labeling tracts as neighborhoods.\n\nSouth and Crowder (50) are cited by some in the literature as providing evidence for why tracts can be labeled as neighborhoods. In their paper, South and Crowder (50) do use tracts and refer to them as neighborhoods extensively. Ross and Mirowsky (51) are also cited within our reviewed articles as validating the use of the term neighborhood to describe tracts. Ross and Mirowsky (51) do use the term extensively in the text and justifies it by citing Tienda (49) and South and Crowder (50). Ross and Mirowsky (51) write that census tracts are the best approximation to neighborhood. They write: “following most prior research, we use census tracts as geographical representation of neighborhoods\" (51). They cite Tienda (49) as being a source that explains how tracts offer an imperfect operationalization of neighborhoods. Ross and Mirowsky (51) validate the use of the term neighborhood to refer to tracts because they are the most “commonly available spatial entity in approximating the usual conception of neighborhood”—a statement that is followed by a citation to our previously discussed Rickets and Sawhill (48) article.\n\nMany of our reviewed articles cited a statement issued by the US Census Bureau regarding tracts to justify their use of the neighborhood label. Since the US Census Bureau kept being cited, it is worth mentioning that in 1990 and 2000, the Census Bureau reported [see http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/tr_metadata.html] that when first delineated, census tracts were “designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.” In 2010, the Census Bureau modified their description and explained [see http://www.census.gov/geo/www/2010census/gtc_10.html] that tracts are “small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity.” Statements by the US Census Bureau were probably never meant as a scientific justification for labeling tracts as neighborhoods. The Census recognizes that their geographical polygons must only serve the needs of the legal mandate that create the institution. That is, the Census creates geographies that serve governmental administrative needs and not the theories of academicians.\n\nCuriously, most of the articles within our full review paid little attention to alternative nesting units. Existing research has advocated the use of census block groups as more adequate neighborhood units (52–53). Others have even advocated testing various geospatial units to explore which ones are capable of producing the most robust estimates (53). Many alternative nesting units are used in the literature that have been argued to adequately serve as proxies for neighborhoods. Clearly the debate on what geographical boundaries best capture neighborhoods continues—a discussion that is unintentionally hidden when the term neighborhood is employed without regard to its scientifically ambiguous nature."
