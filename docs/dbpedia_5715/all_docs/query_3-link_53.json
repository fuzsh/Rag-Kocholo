It was easy to feel comfortable hiring my neighborâs daughter to watch my son after school.â - Patrick, Mission East\n\nâThis year for Spring Cleaning, we wanted to sell old appliances, tools, clothing and electronics on Nextdoor Finds. In no time, our neighbors stopped by to make a deal and take things off our hands. It was easier than anything else, and it feels good knowing our old stuff has found a new home in the neighborhood.â - Dan, Hayes Valley\n\nOUR PURPOSE\n\nAt Nextdoor, we believe that by bringing neighbors together, we can cultivate a kinder world where everyone has a neighborhood they can rely on.\n\nYOUR PRIVACY\n\nNextdoor is a trusted environment where all neighbors are verified, making it safe to share online the kinds of things you'd be okay sharing with your neighbors in person.\n\nHere's how:\n\nâ¢ Every neighbor verifies their address\n\nâ¢ All members go by their real names, just like in person\n\nConnect with us:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/nextdoor\n\nhttps://twitter.com/nextdoor\n\nhttps://instagram.com/nextdoor\n\nContinued use of Location Services running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

This app gave me the opportunity to work for myself again, being visible in different neighborhoods in Miami. Building a client portfolio takes time and dedication and Nextdoor gave me the opportunity to be seen by thousands of families at the same time. I started using it when that pandemic ð· that paralyzed the entire world. I quit my job as Chief Engineer for 4 buildings in North Miami, so I went all in and won ðª. In 2008 when Real Estate fell, I was working independently as a Handyman and I was doing well, but that economic disaster in 2008 made me have to be a Chief Engineer for hotels and then those four buildings. I had already given up on going back to work for myself, but I found Nextdoor and I decided to leave everything and go back to work for myself and Nextdoor gave me my life back. Today, 4 years later, I can say that I feel very proud of all the effort I put into each job and for being recognized by my clients, highlighted in the more than 530 reviews from neighbors on my profile. Something incredible and very difficult to achieve 530 reviews; More than any other contractor in all of Miami? in 4 years working with Nextdoor, and this is why I love â¤ï¸ this platform. Thank you, thank you ð and a thousand more thanks, for giving me back my work freedom.\n\nNodangnickname,ok? ,\n\nBuggy, SLOOOOW, and where is everything??!\n\nNextdoor has become increasingly slower and buggier, and options that were easy to find before are now hidden and take several clicks to locate. You can swipe and swipe and swipe before the screen will actually scroll. Clicking on a post or image? Hurry up and wait, and half the time now the whole app freezes up. Even typing a comment is a monumental effort â¦ Iâll have the entire sentence typed before it shows up on my screen. Then thereâs the censors and moderation. Iâm a neighborhood lead and have been for several years. I petitioned hard to become one. But then Nextdoor decided to dump a bunch of random people in as moderators. Many have absolutely NO idea what the rules regarding content even are! Theyâll flag one word comments like, âReally?â as public humiliation. Because it was directed toward them or their pal. *true story* Itâs frustrating to those of us who originally were tasked with this responsibility. Nextdoorâs auto-censor algorithms are utterly ridiculous too â¦ flagging words like âstupidâ or âjerkâ and reminding us to be ânice.â ð Nextdoor: you have an awesome thing going here, great idea overall and content, but PLEASE bring back the earlier format! Speed things up, minimize the constant barrage of irrelevant ads, and go back to neighborhood leads only instead of all this random crap. I donât expect a response to this review â¦ Nextdoor isnât real keen on that sort of thing either unfortunately.\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nThanks for sharing your feedback, neighbor. Weâve recently redesigned the layout of Nextdoor to focus on the features that Neighbors use most based on our research and user feedback. This article should be helpful in navigating the new layout: https://nxdr.co/3oACmw2. If you have questions along the way, please let us know, here: http://nxdr.co/socialcare. We've shared your thoughts with our team, as hearing from neighbors like you helps us improve."
