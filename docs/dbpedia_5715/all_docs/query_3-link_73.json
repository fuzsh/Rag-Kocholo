And really come up with a neighbourhood name,\" she said.\n\n\"Just to help with building identity of the community, just making it an inclusive process where lots of neighbours you know come together and meet one another ... become a stronger neighbourhood.\"\n\n'Getting people involved'\n\nThe survey went live earlier this week and Mullally said about 100 people have already filled out the online form.\n\nPeople have the chance to vote on some names that had already been kicked around, and add their own ideas to the list of names.\n\nThe idea for a secondary survey with some of the most popular names to be put up sometime after Labour Day.\n\nMullally the idea was supposed to be a fun way of \"building the community.\"\n\n\"Getting people involved, having them identify with their neighbourhood, having them get to know their neighbours, having them come out to community events and feel part of our community,\" she said.\n\nMullally also said that while the neighbourhood is part of the larger downtown Charlottetown area it is \"more distinctive.\"\n\n\"We have our own park and, we have a few little events and we thought why not come up with a name? Just because it really … supports people in feeling included.\"\n\n'Take a first step'\n\nThe Hill, Foxden, and Orlebar were included in the survey as well as Wowkwis, the Mi'kmaq word for red fox. If Wowkwis wins, the group says they will consult with Mi'kmaq elders on a proper term for Fox Den.\n\nShe isn't sure how far the group will go in making the name official in any capacity.\n\n\"We just thought we'd take a first step,\" she said.\n\n\"It will really just depend on what people want to do. I don't think in a naming process sometimes there's you know a real linear outline to how it's going to happen.\"\n\n\"I just encourage anybody who lives in or around the area to have a look at it and contribute their thoughts.\"\n\n- MORE P.E.I.
