I think that to a certain extent that is true of all Shakespeare's plays: they are all dramas and any attempt to call them histories, tragedies, or comedies is not helpful to theatre practitioners - a director and a group of actors.1\n\nVictor Hugo's Romantic dramas have remained the most controversial part of his work ever since he overturned the neo-classical canons accepted by the French theatre-going public in the 18308. Even friendly modern commentators as diverse as Michel Butor and Ruth Doyle have pointed to the disagreements among critics of his dramas, disagreements much more marked than those separating readers of his poetry or novels. Doyle, for instance, opens her 1981 annotated bibliography of Hugo's theatre by calling his plays the 'weakest part of his total work.'2 Oddly enough, however, among the 826 items she collected, she lists not a single study in English devoted entirely to his plays. And yet, by 1981, New French Critics and 'Hugologists' like Ubersfeld, Gaudon, Laster, Leuilliot, and Seebacher had all but completed their reinterpretations and reappraisals of Hugo's theatre. One recent English biographer, Joanna Richardson, also neglects to mention, in her hypercritical, sensationalistic, and inaccurate account of Hugo's life and work, a single post-Structuralist analysis of his dramatic output or of its reception, contemporary or modern.3 This is the first study in English, then, to benefit from the formal discoveries made by recent French critics of Victor Hugo's theatre; it will supplement them by offering rhetorical analyses of both his dramatic theory and practice. Ignorance about and latent hostility to Hugo's theatre in the Anglo-\n\nx\n\nIntroduction\n\nSaxon world are easily understood, springing, as they do, partly from the dearth of productions of his dramas in English. Outside France, Hugo the 'dramatist' remained, until 1996, best known as the writer of the work from which the musical Les Miserabks was taken, and of Notre-Dame de Paris, from which Disney produced an edulcorated cartoon version involving the 'Hunchback of Notre Dame.' However, the 1996 production by England's Royal National Theatre of Hugo's Le Roi s'amuse (re-entitled The Prince's Play)4 gave English-speaking theatre-goers the opportunity to see a drama banned in Paris after its premiere in 1832 and only rarely staged since in France. Even in some of the scholarly works listed by Doyle, ignorance of Hugo's dramas extends to the meaning of the word he used to designate the genre which they exemplify. While he may not have invented the French Romantic drama, he certainly produced its most successful definition and created as well almost all of its most lasting paradigms (the exception being Mussel's Lorenzactio). Before Hugo revolutionized French canons of theatrical taste, the French word 'drame' corresponded in meaning with the English word 'drama.' In its generic sense, 'drama' designates, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, any 'composition in prose or verse, adapted to be acted on a stage, in which a story is related by means of dialogue and action, and is represented with accompanying gesture, costume and scenery, as in real life: a play.' (Incidentally, this definition seems to confuse dramatic and narrative modes, separated since Plato into mimetic, or direct, speech and diegetic, or indirect, speech respectively.) Thus the expression, the 'French drama,' may well be seen as designating originally a specific, national species of the genus, 'the drama,' which the same dictionary defines as 'the dramatic branch of literature; the dramatic art.' As its etymological notes show, the OED bases its own definition on the Greek word Spajjia, 'deed, action, play, esp. tragedy.' To support this English usage of the term, one could invoke, among one's authorities, Aristotle himself who in Chapter 3 of the Poetics, speaking of both tragic and comic writers, Sophocles and Aristophanes in the event, adds that 'they both represent men in action, men actually doing things. And this, some say, is why their works are called dramas, from their representing men doing things.'5 This generic sense clearly survived into English, subsuming and mingling the various specific forms: tragedy, comedy, farce, indeed all of Polonius' dramatic sub-genres in all of their logical combinations: 'tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral. Before the rise of the 'Romantic drama' in France in the late 18205, 'drame' retained its generic sense. So, when Michel Lioure proposed, in 1963, the use of the French word 'drame' to cover stage plays produced in the period stretching from the\n\nIntroduction\n\nxi\n\neighteenth to the twentieth centuries, 'from Diderot to lonesco,'7 in his words, he both overturned a linguistic usage going back to the word's first appearance in France, which the Dictionnaire Robert lists as occurring in 1657, and extended the term's Romantic usage. Lioure quite rightly asserts the word's lack of currency in the seventeenth century, adding that the great French neo-classical writers Corneille, Racine, and Moliere wrote tragedies and comedies, not dramas. Lioure goes on: 'In the French dramatic context, the drama seems, next to proud Tragedy and free-speaking Comedy, as only one - frequently mediocre - moment or form of our dramatic history ... [Ejighteenth-century theoretical assertions about drama attest nonetheless to the actual creation of a genre. By defining itself generically as existing on the margins of tragedy and comedy, the drama made no reference to any earlier form of the dramatic art: it defined itself in opposition to what existed and invented itself as it went along.' 8 As we shall see when discussing in greater detail the dramatic theories and works of its chief practitioner, Victor Hugo, French drama thus made room for itself by opposing the generic distinctions going back to Aristotle, and upon which Boileau, codifier of the seventeenth-century French neoclassical canon, based an absolute preference for 'purity' of tone and temper, tragedy being totally 'serious' and comedy excluding catharsis and offering at best, in Moliere's bourgeois comedies, a 'useful lesson.' By combining comedy and tragedy, Romantic drama refused the French model offered by Racine, affirming instead its desire to imitate the universally recognized dramatists of the past, most notably Shakespeare. The expression 'Romantic drama' describes a form practised in France by Hugo, Dumas, Vigny, Musset, and a few minor authors who wrote a corpus of plays produced for the most part (Hugo's Torquemada is an obvious exception) between 1827 and 1843. More recently, Michel Lioure, by combining with 'drama' the adjectives, 'bourgeois,' 'symbolist,' and 'contemporary,' was able to posit a wider genre, one which, since Diderot, has dominated the French stage at least at the pragmatic level. So much so, that nowadays, dramatic conventions in France favour the mixture of tragic and comic action prevalent elsewhere in the West. This generic use of the word 'drama' is not the only one found, of course. When modern Hugologists or their ideological opponents use the term drame, as an evaluative tag, designed to confer value on (or withdraw it from) Hugo's dramatic production, they do so in the context of a logic dependent upon a literary historical view that seeks to place (or omit) him from the 'Pantheon' of the world's 'great' dramatists. When Anne Ubersfeld, for instance, certainly the principal Hugologist to specialize in the study of his theatre, defines the Romantic drama, she does so in this way: 'The drama is a literary genre which originates neither in France in 1830,\n\nxii\n\nIntroduction\n\nnor even in Germany in 1790-1800. The \"drama\" is much older, and when becoming conscious of itself, looks for guarantors and precedents in the England of Shakespeare and in Spain's Golden Age. Nor does it stop at the end of the 18308, but continues to return to its Romantic sources, seeing its posterity not so much in Northern Naturalist drama (Ibsen, Strindberg) as in the theatre of Symbolist authors like Villiers de 1'Isle-Adam, Maeterlinck and Claudel' (DR, 7). And she is right to point out that in William ShakespeareHugo demonstrates drama's 'almost infinite range': 'Drama, [Hugo writes], is a strange artistic form. Its diameter encompasses [Aeschylus'] Seven against Thebes and [Sedaine's] A Philosopher without Knowing It, Brid'oison [in Beaumarchais' Marriage of Figaro] and Oedipus; [Seneca's] Thyestes belongs in it, as well as [Lesage's] Turcaret. If you wish to define drama, include both [Aeschylus' and Sophocles'] Electra and [Marivaux's] Marion in your definition' (OC, 12, 204). Encouraged, seemingly, by Hugo's breadth of vision, Ubersfeld goes on to propose a definition of drama encompassing all performed works, irrespective of genre but characterized by 'freedom': 'Even when limited to its Romantic form, the drama has a history whose limits are ill-defined. Any work may be defined as a drama which, without consideration of form or code, pathetic or comic effect, presents a story, a fable implying both individual destinies and a 'social' universe. This extremely broad definition excludes, however, 'traditional' forms like tragedy and comedy or 'new' ones such as melodrama or comic opera [vaudeville}, since all of them are linked to a pre-existing structure or 'code.' Drama's essential characteristic is its freedom. But all freedom is a battle against constraints: so no one will be surprised that drama is a perpetual battlefield' (DR 7). Ubersfeld's definition is indeed broad. It will be part of our task in the following pages to examine to what extent and in which ways it may be said to coincide with Victor Hugo's theoretical vision and dramatic practice. Aiming to analyse the rhetoric of his dramas, the following study carefully distinguishes the generic characteristics of the Romantic drama that separate it from French neo-classical tragedy and popular melodrama. As well as studying the pre-eminently rhetorical notion of genre, we shall examine also, among other discursive techniques, Hugo's use of dramatic irony, and his construction of paradoxical characters, composed of conflicting emotions, antithetical moral impulses, and personifying conflicts between social status and meritocratic or erotic aspirations. Hugo's use of anagnorisis in plots based on mistaken identity and subsequent recognition shows him exploiting one of the dramatic devices Aristotle discussed in the Poetics, one which also, when productive of catharsis, makes a decidedly rhetorical appeal to an audience's emotions. We shall see that Hugo used plotlogic in order to persuade the French theatre-going public of the validity\n\nIntroduction\n\nxiii\n\nof his anti-royalist and unfashionable ideas concerning social justice in nineteenth-century France. The Romantic theory of drama he conceived permitted the creation of dramas certain to launch strong emotional appeals to audiences by invoking their sense of historical verisimilitude and ideological beliefs. His plots, by showing virtue despised and destroyed, aim to arouse indignation against social injustice, religious fanaticism, and the exploitation of women by egotistical husbands and lovers. In discussing Hugo's dramatic rhetoric, we shall foreground Hugo's theatrical practice: his remarks on the staging of his dramas and the detailed stage directions he included in them reveal most clearly how he envisaged the dramatization of his aesthetic ideas and socio-political concerns. Although many of his ideas appear in the prefaces he wrote for his dramas, he was no mere writer of theatrical tracts: ideologically speaking, Hugo fleshed out his value judgments by producing heroes and villains who personify both his ideals and the objects of his contempt. If his characters share with the orator a skilful use of language and gesture, it is because Hugo endowed them with a delivery, or actio, whose procedures and function have been discussed since it was codified by Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian and their epigones. Rhetorical analysis, which exposes the 'logic of value judgements,'9 will permit us to clarify Hugo's positions on aesthetic and socio-political matters, just as it will empower our discussion of the generic characteristics distinguishing the Romantic drama from neoclassical tragedy or Revolutionary melodrama. Rhetorical analysis also provides the tool best designed, since the ancient rhetors first studied the precise reactions of the specific audiences they addressed, for the discussion of the different kinds of receptions accorded a performance by particular audiences. The history of the reception of Hugo's dramas between his day and ours allows us to chart their persuasiveness as vehicles exemplifying, and promoting, his ideas both aesthetic and social. In order to follow Hugo's development as a dramatist, we shall trace his progress from his first experience of melodrama to the experiments he conducted, late in his career, with epic or bourgeois drama. It is to his first exposure to the melodrama, both as he and his family lived it in Napoleonic France, and as he first saw it in Pixerecourt's popular plays that we shall turn first.

In references it is abbreviated to OC. Passages from the plays are cited conventionally by act and scene, or by 'part,' 'day,' and 'scene,' when Hugo uses the latter terms. Lucrece Borgia is divided into acts, parts, and scenes; so the references contain three elements (e.g., i, i, 3). Marie Tudor and Angela each comprise three 'Days,' with each 'Day' divided into scenes, and in both plays 'Day 3' also contains 'parts.' In Marie Tudor, therefore, (3, i, 4) refers to Day 3, part i, scene 4; in Angela (3, 2, i) to Day 3, part 2, scene i. Les Burgraves is made up of 'Parts' and scenes only (e.g., 2, i), whereas Torquemada's two 'Parts' contain both acts and scenes. In the latter case (i, i, 7) refers to Part i, Act i, scene 7.

Youth and Dramatic Juvenilia\n\nDespite a few attempts by Freud and some of his successors, the psychoanalysis of literature that respects the literary signifier's originality has not yet begun, and that is probably not an accident. Up to the present, only the signifieds of literature have been analysed, which is to say literature's non-literary signifieds. Such questions refer to the whole history of literary forms themselves, and to everything in them that was specifically intended to authorize this misunderstanding.1\n\nIf we take Anne Ubersfeld's definition of the drama, namely 'a story, a. fable implying both individual destinies and a \"social universe\"' as the basis for studying Victor Hugo's career in the theatre, then we encounter a precise theoretical problem. As many of his biographers and critics have pointed out, his plays frequently dramatize the problems occurring among and between members of a family: incest, sibling rivalry, ancestor worship, are only some of the most obvious of such subjects. Formalists would argue that, in constructing his dramas around family strife, Hugo the pragmatic dramatist was merely following Aristotle's remark in Chapter 13 of the Poetics that 'the best tragedies are written about a handful of families.' Because the close relationships existing among family members are complicated and multi-directional (maternity clashing with incest, filial respect with sexual or political rivalry, etc.), such subjects sharpen the focus on internal strife and dramatic confrontation. Or should we, like the recent school of Hugo specialists at the University of Paris vn, editors and contributors to the monumental 'Chronological Edition' of Hugo's complete works (1967-70), use the plays as documents permitting a psycho-analytical\n\n4\n\nHugo and the Romantic Drama\n\nexamination of their author? Should we then see his plays as Romantic dramas of personal identity and (mainly) fraternal guilt, as these and other biographers have done? It seems to us that our task should be to adduce the relevant biographical evidence for both kinds of interpretation of his plays, the formally pragmatic and the allegorically confessional. Readers will, of course, decide which interpretation they prefer. It should be noted, however, that the biographical account in the following pages aims principally to show the importance which the Romantic drama occupied in Hugo's life. Victor-Marie Hugo was born in Besancon on 26 February 1802. The date is significant: it is the year when Napoleon Bonaparte became Consul for life, thus preparing for his proclamation as Emperor of the French two years later. It is doubly significant because the child's father was to rise to prominence in Napoleon's armies, even being admitted to membership of the imperial nobility. His mother, however, Sophie Hugo, nee Trebuchet, from a royalist Breton family, was so far from sharing her husband's Napoleonic sentiments that she even sheltered one of the many plotters against the Emperor's life. From this disunited home, forced as a child to follow his father in his postings as a serving officer and, presumably, with less need of obligation, to bask in his professional achievements, Victor was to learn much that he later put to good use in his dramas, as we shall see. The boy's father, Joseph Leopold Sigisbert Hugo, belonged to the heroic generation which, by following Napoleon, rose to glorious heights. Their Romantic sons, in the person of Alfred de Musset,2 were to protest that fate, by delaying their births, had forever denied them access to a similar glory. Leopold, born in Nancy, was fifteen when he first enlisted in the citizens' army in 1789. He served with distinction on the Rhine and in the Vendee, where, as a loyal republican, he fought against royalist French officers who had emigrated after the Revolution. While thus engaged, he met in Chateaubriant Sophie Trebuchet whom he married in Paris in November 1797. Sophie was originally from Nantes and although in her youth she expressed Voltairean, even republican, opinions, she later moved politically to the right, and was, as a confirmed monarchist, delighted by Louis XVIIl's Restoration in 1814. Never a Catholic - her marriage to Leopold was a purely civil affair - she never had Victor or his two elder brothers Abel and Eugene, born in 1798 and 1800 respectively, baptized. The marriage, between a violent-tempered serving officer of Napoleon and a stubborn, unforgiving supporter of the Bourbon monarchy, soon went wrong. Sophie's affair with General Lahorie began the year of Victor's birth; and Leopold's liaison with Catherine Thomas followed the year after. Sophie\n\nYouth and Dramatic Juvenilia\n\n5\n\nlearned of her husband's infidelities long before Leopold discovered, in 1811, her relationship with Lahorie, one of his own superior officers. The family lived in an atmosphere of mutual reproaches and quarrels until the official divorce in 1815, which Leopold successfully sought on the grounds of his wife's adultery. The boys, who were placed in the care of their father, supported their mother's cause throughout the marital disputes, gladly accepting the final legal settlement which, in 1818, returned them to their mother's care. As his marital life was falling apart, Leopold continued to advance in rank at the extraordinary rate made possible by Napoleon's almost continuous military campaigns. In 1800, after distinguishing himself at the battle of Marengo, he was promoted battalion commander. This triumph brought him to the notice of his future protector, Joseph Bonaparte. After the birth of his third son, Victor, however, he was sent in semi-disgrace because of his republican opinions and his unsuspecting friendship with Lahorie, who was known for his anti-Bonapartist sentiments, on garrison duty first to Marseilles, then to Bastia, and finally to Elba. While Sophie pleaded on his behalf in Paris, Leopold, alone in Elba with his three sons in December 1803, met Catherine Thomas, the mistress he would marry in 1821. Even in disgrace, his star continued to rise, however, bringing him the Legion of Honour in 1804. Recalled to the colours, Leopold once again distinguished himself in battle, this time serving in Massena's victory over the Archduke Charles at Caldiero, in Venetia. In 1806, after helping Joseph conquer and so become King of Naples, Leopold, now a major, captured after a long and difficult campaign the bandit Fra Diavolo, gaining as reward the military governorship of the province of Avellino. Once again Sophie and her three sons journeyed to share his military quarters, this time to Naples where, however, no lasting marital reconciliation ensued. In February 1808, Colonel Hugo followed Joseph to Spain where, in July of the following year, he again won promotion in battle, this time at Talavera. Appointed Brigadier-General, Governor of the province of Avila and Inspector-General of Spanish troops, Leopold, in 1810, defeated at Sigiienza the guerrilla chief Martin Diaz. Raised to the Imperial nobility as Count of Sigiienza, governor of several Spanish provinces and assured of a glorious career while the Emperor reigned, Leopold suddenly found himself called to order by Joseph Bonaparte, who professed himself scandalized by his protege's irregular liaison with Catherine Thomas. Joseph ordered him to send for Sophie and the family, a decision which explains indirectly why Victor at an early age came to learn Spanish and to get to know and love Spain, the country that was to become a principal setting for the action of his dramas. He also discovered, in the toponyms of two small Spanish towns passed through on his way to Madrid with Sophie and his\n\n6\n\nHugo and the Romantic Drama\n\nbrothers, the names he would give to his bandit chief, Hernani, as well as that of his Grand Inquisitor, Torquemada. On the journey to Madrid Victor also experienced the pleasures of theatrical, as opposed to existential, melodrama. This event, not without importance for Hugo's theory and practice of the Romantic drama, as we shall see, was recounted many years later by Victor's wife, Adele, in the account she left as a 'witness' of the life of her husband, who by that time was the most famous writer alive. As she explains, Victor, his mother, and brothers Abel and Eugene arrived in the border town of Bayonne on their way to Madrid. There they discovered that the military escort necessary to protect French travellers from Spanish guerrillas would not leave for a month. Compelled to stay in Bayonne, Sophie reserved a box in the local theatre for the entire period. The reservation delighted the boys who looked forward to the prospect of a whole month of nightly visits to the theatre. The first night they rushed off to see Guilbert de Pixerecourt's melodrama, The Ruins of Babylon. Hugo's wife continues: The children stared wide-eyed, dancing with joy at the spectacle. Jiaffar's apricot-coloured costume made a particularly vivid impression upon them. The next evening, still full of the previous performance, they rushed, as if drunk, to the theatre. The Ruins of Babylon was again on the bill. The play was so enjoyable that they were happy to see it again. The third day, they entered their box at the usual time. The curtain went up. On The Ruins of Babylon. They took some pleasure in looking out for a few of their favourite places in the play. Eventually, they fell asleep. (VHR, 178-9)\n\nAnother two visits were necessary to convince them that Pixerecourt's play was going to be the only show in town during their stay. The incident's significance derives from the influence Pixerecourt-style melodrama was to have on one of the very first written works by Hugo that survive. Hell on Earth (L'Enfer sur terre) and The Devil's Castle (Le Chateau du diable), both dramatic texts, were apparently written in 1812 when he was only ten years old.3 Little of Pixerecourt's melodramatic style appears, however, in Hell on Earth, which at this distance seems more like a child's view of a medieval peasant fabliau or Molieresque farce.4 In the twelve completed scenes, four characters, the Norman peasant Cassandre, his wife, her would-be lover Sylvain, and the Devil, contrive a reversal of the initial action in which the evil-tempered Cassandre slaps his wife. He later confides to Sylvain that he would prefer his 'reasonable' wife to be unreasonable and difficult, adding that she should even beat him. In scene 8, the Devil, having assumed the appearance of Mme Cassandre, returns with interest to her husband the slap he had given his wife in scene i. In the\n\nYouth and Dramatic Juvenilia\n\n7\n\nsame guise, the Devil, in scene 9, offers to Sylvain's lecherous advances the warm encouragement that Mme Cassandre had refused him in scene 4. Sylvain and the Devil, in three soliloquies (scenes 3, 5 and 7), explain the changes they would like to see or intend to make in the present situation. This use of the soliloquy as an expositional or explanatory device making possible dramatic irony (the public is better informed as a result than one or other of the characters) is interesting because it is a device used frequently by Hugo in subsequent plot construction. The scenes completed contain no sign of the happy ending proposed by the Devil in scene 5, where he claims to wish to restore harmony to the disunited husband and wife. This is typically Hugolian: unlike traditional melodrama, none of his dramas end happily for the protagonists. More influenced by the melodrama is The Devil's Castle which, unlike Hugo's dramas, does have a happy ending. The convention conforms in part to Ubersfeld's view of melodrama whose sentimentally optimistic denouements Hugo's Romantic dramas were to overturn: 'Melodrama is highly coded, and rigidly systematic [she writes]: its characters are prefabricated \"types.\" First, the Traitor, greedy and hypocritical ... His adversary, the disinterested Hero (rarely a woman): acting out of pure virtue, he is not the lover, and receives no other reward than a clear conscience. His helper is a man of the people, a Simpleton, whose linguistic malapropisms and behavioural faux-pas provoke good-natured laughter. The Young Girl is the designated victim, coveted by the Traitor along with her fortune; frequently kidnapped, she remains virgin pure. Finally, the Father, persecuted in the past, rediscovers at the end, thanks to the Hero, his family and place in society' (DR, 90). The influence of some of these melodramic conventions is clear in The Devil's. Castle, but so too are young Victor's departures from the generic model. The dramatis personae comprise Raoul, the disinterested hero; Robert, his comic henchman, a simple-minded, cowardly boaster, who is beaten onstage by an imp from hell; Adelaide, Raoul's love object who, like Dona Sol in Hernani, joins her lover in death; the Brigand, who tempts the Hero with money and panders for his mistress, the Brigand-Queen; and two utility roles, Martha, Robert's wife and confidant (useful for expositional purposes), and a slave who claims to be able to offer the Hero a means of escaping his fate (a false peripeteia, as things turn out). But, like Hernani and Dona Sol in Hugo's later drama, both Robert and Adelaide commit suicide. How then can The Devil's Castle conform to the melodrama's demand for a conventional happy ending? The answer is by a final reversal which abandons the dramatic logic of the previous scenes. The final scene takes place in the Castle's throne room in an atmosphere appropriate to a Christmas pantomime, as the young Hugo's stage direction makes clear: ' The stage represents the throne room; the throne, supported by four magnificent col-\n\n8\n\nHugo and the Romantic Drama\n\numns, is raised up at the back of the stage, with the old Count of Richaumont seated upon it. Around him are ranged all the actors in the play.' Here the father-figure, the Count, Adelaide's uncle, effects the magical reversal, bringing back to life the dead lovers, adding the final gesture of reconciliation, and the apparent guarantee of future happiness: 'Raoul, Adelaide, come to my arms, my children. What I have done was merely to test you; it was only a ceremony played out by my men-at-arms and my vassals. Raoul, you are worthy of my niece; Adelaide, you have a husband who deserves you. My children, I give you all my wealth. Be happy (OC, i, 21). Before taxing Hugo, whether he was ten or fourteen years old at the time, with having created a phantasmagoria fatal to the suspension of disbelief, it is worthwhile remembering that he did not in fact invent the plot. Eliette Vasseur points out that almost all the elements of Hugo's play, title, subject, peripeteia, ending, even the characters' names derive from the 'heroic comedy of one Loaisel de Treogate, a Breton pre-Romantic writer' (OC, i, ii). Rather than charging Hugo the young dramatist with a lack of stage technique should we then tax him with plagiarism? It seems more productive, given the author's youth, to point to the mixture in The Devil's Castle of some of the conventional characters of melodrama with, already, some still timid departures from the genre. Mention of such intertextual problems as influence, sources, and plagiarism inevitably raises the question of Hugo's first exposure to the plays which were to inspire his own first written works. Adele Hugo recounts that among her husband's earliest memories was a play, Genevieve de Brabant, put on at the school which the three-year-old attended and in which he played Genevieve's child, disguised in a sheepskin equipped, bizarrely enough, with an iron claw. He seized the opportunity during her speeches to prick her legs with the implement, so that she was forced into some very audible out-of-character vituperative asides to her offspring (VHR, 102). The same source recounts that after the experience of seeing Moliere's Comtesse d'Escarbagnas and Pixerecourt's The Ruins of Babylon, Hugo saw in Valladolid his first Spanish play. The account is interesting from several points of view, not least because it illustrates the perils of reading biographical events as the direct source of an author's literary works or theories: 'In the play performed, there was a character who died from a dagger thrust. Real blood, or at least what created the illusion of blood, spilled from the wound and covered the stage. Until that time, young Victor had seen, among tragic works, only plays in which everything was fake, emotions as well as production values. He was extremely struck by the dying man whose blood was spilled because such a thing must happen if one is stabbed. This scene gave him, for the first time, the idea of reality in art' (ibid., 206). One can only agree with the annotator (ibid., 722, nio) of this passage that\n\nYouth and Dramatic Juvenilia\n\n9\n\nits glib character as a description of Hugo's much later dramatic practice represents a case of post hoc ergo propter hoc, of sequence being taken for consequence. Just as likely is the reverse: later practice may well have served to reconstruct the 'memory' and its 'effect.' The next event in Hugo's education as a dramatist occurred after his return from Spain to Paris and concerns a passing fascination with Bobino and Jocrisse, French avatars of Mr Punch and his wretched wife. The French version was played by two human actors: Bobino, the master, beats his loudly protesting valet, Jocrisse, to the delight of the French children forming the audience. In 1814 when the brothers Hugo saw it, the scene was played to attract patrons outside the Bobino theatre, near the Luxembourg gardens. Once inside the theatre, the Hugos were introduced to the puppets, almost half life-size, moved by wires and wooden batons, but they were so lacking in life that the boys preferred the human attraction outside. Nevertheless, the visits did induce them to procure a puppet theatre, for which Hugo improvised dramatic scenes and dialogues. He also wrote the texts for a series of dramatic performances which took place at the Cordier boarding school he attended in 1815. For these entertainments, which Mme Hugo later compared to the first circus performances arranged in revolutionary Paris by Antonio Franconi, he also helped with the 'sets' and took an interest in costumes, both of which activities he was to continue during his career as a Romantic dramatist. The plays he wrote for his companions were largely based on the battles of Napoleon; in them, as author, he gave himself the role of Emperor. With the collaboration of his brother Eugene, he staged Imperial triumphs on classroom tables, and according to Mme Hugo, The [schoolboy] spectators drawn up on benches in the most orderly fashion applauded' these performances (VHR, 280). His familiarity with classical tragedy coincides in part with his Philosophy year at Louis-le-Grand, one of the most highly reputed schools in France. The Jesuits who ran it specialized in theatrical presentations in Hugo's time, just as they had when among their pupils they counted Donatien, later the Marquis, de Sade. Maurice Lever, Sade's most recent biographer, writes: '[TJheatre occupied a central role in the life of the school. They organized dramatic presentations and staged tragedies, comedies, pastorals, and even oratorios and operas, which the good fathers generally wrote themselves on edifying subjects and assigned their students to interpret with the aid of professional dancers from the Opera ... The school's productions were notable for their sumptuous scenery and complex machinery, which served to evoke splendid palaces, grand perspectives, colonnades, and fantastic landscapes. Formal performances were held every year in August, at the school prize-giving in the main courtyard.'5 As\n\nio\n\nHugo and the Romantic Drama\n\ndramatists, both Sade and Hugo benefited from the good fathers' enthusiasm. In 1816, when he was fourteen, Victor Hugo decided to write a tragedy. His decision derived in part from his voracious reading: in the summer of 1815, for instance, confined to bed with a knee injury sustained in a schoolboy fight, he read, among several other works listed later by his wife Adele, all the tragedies of Voltaire. Irtamene, the promised tragedy, 1,508 lines in five acts, written between 17 July and 14 December 1816, became his mother's New Year's gift on i January 1817. Irtamene certainly conforms to many, but not all, of the conventions of French neo-classical tragedy of the seventeenth century, as codified by Boileau in his 1674 Art poetique. Boileau's canonization of French neo-classical dramatic authors, most notably Corneille and Racine, takes remarks by Aristotle and Horace and hardens them into a set of 'rules.' Thus, an author of tragedies should, he believed, respect the unities of time, place and action ('a single thing done, in one place, in one day'), avoid the resolution of a complicated action by a final, surprising peripeteia, and display judgment in the choice and treatment of subject ('see that love appears as a weakness, not a virtue'). 6 Boileau adds to these prescriptions the doctrine of bienseance, which decrees that onstage action must observe the contemporary proprieties, (i.e., the rigid social code of Louis xiv's Versailles): for this reason no violence may be shown. Finally, the dramatic author, says Boileau, must respect his audience's view of what is believable, the criterion being their sense of verisimilitude. This is the Aristotelian notion of doxa, a rhetorical criterion of plausibility aimed at persuasion. How does Irtamene conform to Boileau's model for French neo-classical tragedy? The action concerns Irtamene's refusal to accept usurpation of the throne of Egypt by Cambyse who has deposed the young Zobeir's father. Irtamene, an officer in the former king's guards, opposes Cambyse's minister, Actor, who is only deterred from putting the former guardsman to death by his own passion for Phalerie, Irtamene's loving wife. Several complications result from this initial motivational tangle: Irtamene is happy to die, is even ready to commit suicide, while Actor is ready to free him in exchange for Phalerie. She prefers to die with her husband who, while attempting to dissuade her, cannot contemplate her union with his hated rival, Actor. As in neo-classical dramas, discussions, lyrical and rhetorical, by all the characters, including the confidants, form the development of the subject. It is by inviting spectators to participate imaginatively in such (monological and dialogical) discussions that neo-classical dramatists achieved what is still recognized by many as their greatest strength, the illusion of psychological 'depth' in the characters. In fact, such plays present the characters with one or a number of difficult choices, placing them in\n\nYouth and Dramatic Juvenilia\n\n11\n\nsituations where they face a series of what seem to be unsolvable dilemmas. Their choices involve the primary emotions and threats to their personal security or that of their families: love or death, honour or loss of reputation, patriotism or imprisonment and execution, marital or incestuous love, enforced adultery or the loss of one's child, and so on. Such virtually impossible choices produce characters of great moral intensity, but onstage action becomes purely verbal, being reduced to a succession of tirades, dialogues, and soliloquies. All events like deaths, duels, battles, etc. take place in the wings, as it were, and they and their results are communicated by messengers to public and actors alike. The complications inherent in the initial situation of Irtamene would be ample for a conventional neo-classical tragedy bound by the unities and dramatic proprieties. But Hugo shows his lack of sympathy with such conventions in several ways. First, he violates the unity of space. The action takes place in three different sets: Actor's palace in Acts 1-3; Irtamene's dungeon, which comes equipped with a secret door, in Act 4; and in a 'vast space surrounded by columns' in Act 5. The unity of action, which the plot summary just given seems to guarantee, accounts for six characters: Irtamene, Actor, and Phalerie, and their three confidants, Phorcys, Megabise, and Cirma, respectively. Hugo exploits the confidant's traditional roles in neo-classical tragedy, those of expositional aid and messenger: Cirma's misunderstanding of her mistress's motivation allows Phalerie to explain her real feelings, and it is Phorcys who recounts, in a monologue of some 96 lines, Irtamene's escape from the scaffold and the final battle in which he kills Actor. Fatal to both the unity of action and to the tragic quality of the play is the presence of a seventh character who has only a secondary, or derived role in the Irtamene-Actor confrontation, but whose presence guarantees that tragic despair will be resolved by a happy ending. This seventh character is the son of the deposed king, the youthful Zobeir, for whom Irtamene declares his readiness to die. Phalerie too decides to die out of love for her husband, going so far as to draw a knife onstage preparatory to plunging it in her bosom. A contemporary audience would not have been impressed by such a gesture, confident that no violence could be shown to happen. This miscalculation of effect by the young author demonstrates his uneasy grasp of neo-classical conventions. Zobeir's presence in Act 4 is only made possible by another 'Romantic' addition to the neo-classical model: the already mentioned secret door. Such devices were condemned by the doctrine of verisimilitude, which seventeenth-century audiences interpreted more severely than either the popular audiences that Hugo was later to address, or modern audiences brought up on the cinema's 'special effects.' Two other principal features of neo-classical tragedy respected by the\n\n12\n\nHugo and the Romantic Drama\n\nyoung author of Irtamene, the alexandrine verse and the 'high style' (le style noble} are more difficult to illustrate in translation, a problem which will recur throughout this study. The verse itself is, in any case, untranslatable without the loss of its poetic qualities, and although poetry is often regarded by French-speaking critics as the most successful characteristic of Hugo's dramas, I shall in my translations give only the meaning of the passages relevant to the discussion. As for the style noble, it consists of a literary dialect from which, because of the respect reigning at Louis xiv's Versailles for 'propriety' (bienseance) all 'low' words, i.e., popular, practical or technical terms, were banished, their place being frequently taken by more abstract, figurative terms, by vague but unexceptionable synonyms, metonyms, synecdoches, etc., and by loose, euphemistic, periphrastic structures. A good example of the differences between French and English notions of what should form the 'politically correct' kind of language in tragedy is Voltaire's translation into the linguistic code acceptable in eighteenth-century France, of Hamlet's famous soliloquy on suicide. Voltaire replaced Hamlet's 'When he himself might his quietus make / With a bare bodkin,' for example, by what he judged the more courtly 'Death would be too sweet in these extremities.'7 It is perhaps natural that in his despair, Irtamene, for example, should employ courtly language, using, among other rhetorical figures of the high style, appropriate emotional appeals like apostrophe and exclamatio: I see myself in irons, and in this palace itself In which my king from my hand received the diadem, In this palace which saw my happiness, And [is] now witness to my dark grief... Unfortunate one! what have I said? Alas is it for the earth To raise its eyes to the seat of the thunder?\n\n(4>i)\n\nSimilarly during Irtamene's interview with Zobeir, whom he considers to be his real king, both men, in seeking to outdo each other in generosity of soul, use the heightened language conventional in neo-classical tragedy: IRTAMENE\n\nWhat? my Lord, in this place you expose your life! Ah! Have you forgotten that Actor still commands here? Have you considered that his hand can ... ZOBEIR What dare you say to me? When it is to serve me that you spill your blood,\n\nYouth and Dramatic Juvenilia I should fear decease when Irtamene expires! I should fear the iron of a vile Persian!\n\n13\n\n(4, 2)\n\nBut such high-flown language may well appear strange in the mouth of a furious Actor, determined to murder his rival, as he explains to his equally unscrupulous henchman, Megabise: The traitor will experience all that my rage may do! He is the too happy husband of Phalerie ... May he curse the fate which seems to him so sweet! But think not, friend, that my vain anger Will be limited to giving him the death he craves ... Could poison, or the dagger worthily Serve the just transport of my wrath?\n\n(3, 6)\n\nBoileau's advice to authors that they 'Enliven [their] work with a world of verbal figures.'8 is here followed to the letter, down to the final rhetorical question. The language in the original, further complicated by the demands of versification (despite several cases of enjambement or run-on lines), abounds in inversions of subject and verb, of verb and object, of verb and adverbial phrase, etc. But the 'noble' or 'high' style is used throughout, at the expense, perhaps, of one of Boileau's equally imperative criteria, verisimilitude. In his dramas, however, Hugo will show no fear of either popular expressions or technical terms. And what of Irtamene?, possible meanings? The play can be interpreted as a political allegory, as Eliette Vasseur chooses to do (OC, i, ii). This is only possible, however, if the play is taken to represent a world other than that of post-Restoration France. Briefly, according to Vasseur's reading, Irtamene represents the royalists who fought successfully in 1814-15 against Bonaparte, the usurper, in order to restore the Bourbon monarchy in the person of Louis xvm. The problem here, as she admits, is the process of idealization Hugo's king seems to have undergone. Instead of being, like the historical Louis xvm, old, fat, and lethargic, Zobeir is young, handsome, and energetic.9 Myth has always been able to improve upon history, as Aristotle pointed out. And Hugo did, after all, give Irtamene to his royalist mother as a present. Maybe wishful thinking does explain why he chose this subject for Utopian treatment. Later in the same year, 1817, the studious, and ambitious young Hugo once again attempted, in Athelie ou les Scandinaves, to do homage to Racine and Voltaire, the two 'demigods of the French theatre' he had mentioned in the poem he sent to his mother to accompany Irtamene. This time he was less successful, and though he spent a month, from 15 September to\n\n14\n\nHugo and the Romantic Drama\n\n15 October, on the tragedy, he managed to complete only two acts along with an outline of the whole five-act play. Vasseur suggests that Hugo was unable to complete Athelie because, although in the two acts completed he respected the unities, the plan shows that in the rest of the play such obedience to neo-classical convention would prove impossible. The heroine's name, at least, recalls that of Athalie, heroine of Racine's final tragedy, whose action is also set in a temple. The Nordic element, evident in the names of the other characters and in the choice of setting of Athelie suggests, rather, Voltaire's attempts to renew French tragedy by situating the action in places other than classical Greece or Rome, or Biblical Israel. Hugo's opening stage direction indicates the cultural specificity the set should attempt to represent: 'The action takes place in the sacred wood of Torston, inside the temple of Odin. On the right stands a black, marble tomb bearing Duncar's name; in the background is the altar covered with a veil' (OC, 1, 193). This already Romantic decor, if considered along with the props necessary for the projected final act, a poisoned chalice and a black shroud covering a corpse revealed onstage in the final scene, indicates how far from neoclassical tragedy's conventional anteroom between royal apartments is the setting of Athelie. The complicated plot also departs from the neo-classical doctrine stipulating unity of action. Athelie involves both a conflict between love and dynastic marriage and a revenge drama. Athelie, Queen of Scandinavia was married by her father to Duncar, whom Althur, her ex-suitor, has killed, tricked by the treacherous Morler. Having sworn to avenge her husband by executing his killer, Athelie learns from Duncar's ghost that Althur, whom she has chosen to be her second husband, is the guilty party. He, however, feels no guilt, believing that although Duncar died at his hands, Morler's treachery made him the real murderer, and Althur hopes to expiate his crime by offering to Athelie, whom he now expects confidently to marry, Morler's death. The existing two acts present the exposition of the subject and show Athelie's first hesitations. One reason Hugo did not complete the play seems clear from the exposition. The subject, as stated, is impossible according to the dictates of Aristotelian and French neo-classical tragedy. Honour, a principal tragic motivation, dictates that Althur, the murderer of Athelie's husband, must not profit from his act by marrying her, since such an arrangement smacks of cynical self-interest. The promised expiation in no way exculpates Althur, since he will not suffer in the process of winning his reward, the hand of his beloved. Corneille, in Le Cid (1637), had attempted a similar subject, but in his case, Rodrigo had 'only' killed in a duel Don Diego, Chimene's father. Nonetheless, the resolution of such a highly charged subject did not convince the play's many critics: at the end, Rodrigo is sent\n\nYouth and Dramatic Juvenilia\n\n15\n\noff to war so that in time, perhaps, Chimene will see in him something other than her father's murderer. In fact, Corneille's play produced one of the great controversies in the history of seventeenth-century theatre in France, and it is even now frequently identified as a tragi-comedy because of its potentially happy ending. It would be unreasonable to expect Hugo, at fifteen, to resolve a problem even more highly charged than the one Corneille faced in Le Cid. The projected ending of Athelie shows how far his practice of 'tragedy' had already led him towards the Romantic drama. Philippe van Tieghem quite rightly sees in the projected ending 'a grandiose spectacle, one of those that Voltaire dreamed of in order to increase tragedy's visual appeal.'10 Hugo's outline for the setting and action of the final climactic scene presents many of the effects that he would use again in his Romantic dramas: The great veil of the temple is raised, the altar appears brilliant with light and ornament; the temple's interior is similarly decorated, with priests and bards placed to the right and left of the altar. Althur, eyes blazing, dressed in a king's armour, followed by a litter covered by a black sheet and carried by his warriors, enters from one side of the stage; from the other side, Athelie advances, pale, trembling, hardly breathing and supported by her women. Althur, raising his sword towards the altar, swears to love and protect his wife; then the high priest presents him with the sacred chalice. Athelie, seeing her lover about to drink from the poisoned cup, cries out, gathers her strength, seizes it and gulps down the poison; then she explains everything to Althur, urging him to live because her husband is avenged [by her death]. Petrified with horror, Althur explains in his turn to Athelie Morler's treacheries and, raising the black sheet shows his dying wife the corpse of the traitor he has just sacrificed to his vengeance, adding that he had intended to admit everything to Athelie immediately after their marriage and to pacify Duncar's ghost by killing the real murderer. But, he adds, since the gods have ordered things differently, I will follow you, as is only just; with these words, he draws his sword and falls upon it over the body of his dying wife. (OC, i, 223)\n\nThe Liebestod immediately suggests the ending of Hernani, while the use of stage props like the poisoned chalice, the (chivalric) costume indicating a medieval, rather than a Graeco-Roman subject, characterize Romantic drama rather than seventeenth-century tragedy. Athelie ou les Scandinaves is the last time Hugo will court neo-classical prestige by calling one of his plays a 'tragedy.' It should not be thought, however, that Hugo's dramatic writing in 1817 was uniformly tragic or melodramatic. As a New Year's gift to his mother in 1818, he gave her the enigmatically tided A.Q.C.H.E.B., initials which stand for A Quelque Chose Hasard Est Bon (Chance Is Good for Something) and which\n\n16\n\nHugo and the Romantic Drama\n\nhe identifies generically as a 'comic opera' in 24 scenes not divided into acts. The 'operatic' part is composed of fifteen songs, in several metres: octosyllables dominate but lines of six and ten syllables also appear. The tone differs sharply from song to song, although all of them serve to reveal the character of the singer: Armand's epic account and expression of gratitude for Saint-Leger's exploit which saved his life in battle, contrasts, for example, with the comic political song of Maitre Jacques whose versification is as faulty as his grammar. A sung finale in which each of the main characters explains the meaning of the title as it applies to his or her role in the play offers both a joyful summary of events and an appeal to the audience to forgive a young author's lack of art. Although these poems are called songs, and although Hugo did hope to have the play performed at the Feydeau Theatre, no record remains of the music necessary to turn a comedy in prose and verse into a comic opera or musical comedy. Vasseur suggests that the enigmatic quality of the tide reflects the formulas, random numbers, and logarithms studied by Victor and Eugene in 1817-18, their Mathematics year at Louis-le-Grand. The apparently random nature of the crucial events of his life is well summarized by SaintLeger: 'Born by chance I don't know where, entrusted by chance to the care of a notary, condemned by chance ... to pay I don't know what debt, a duellist by chance, in love by chance, you will admit that I can't share the opinion of those who claim that chance is unimportant' (OC, i, 234). Once his problems are resolved - his identity established, his long-lost brother found, his debts and the legal charges against him dismissed, and his marriage to Celine assured - Saint-Leger can well afford to sing in scene 24: 'Chance tangled up my fate's mysterious thread. Chance's stubborn rage has long darkened my wretched life. But today mends all. Although I have been a poor vagabond, my happiness is being prepared. Chance is good for something' (OC, 1,273). The fortuitous means which unite the lovers and defeat the swindler, Coinclipper (Rognespece) include many of the props and dramatic tricks of melodrama, among them, disguises and coincidences. The discovery of the truth about Saint-Leger's birth, for example, which forms the final reversal resolving the drama, is made possible by a snuffbox containing a portrait of his mother recognized by Count Dorval, who turns out to be not only his long-lost brother, and the Colonel he wounded in a duel, but also his rival for Celine's hand, a rival happy to yield his place to his new-found brother. If we can allow the snuffbox and portrait to be conventional agents of the type of recognition that Aristotle calls 'anagnorisis by signs,'11 the dramatic multifunctionality of the Count may well appear hyperbolic. Such functional over-motivation rarely produces verisimilitude, as Genette points out.12\n\nYouth and Dramatic Juvenilia\n\n17\n\nNew in Hugo's juvenile theatre are the pieces of comic business which show the swindler and his Latin-spouting clerk, Polygraph, receiving their come-uppance from both brothers. Of even greater interest to our postmodern age is Hugo's foregrounding of the work's literary devices. Thus Saint-Leger, Hugo's chance-led hero, is writing a comic opera about his own life, he tells Armand in scene 4, so that art can improve upon reality: 'On earth, where everything follows Chance's chariot, let Chance command me; there [in my work], I command Chance. There I am loved and I am to be married; here, I'm only in love. Here, fate thwarts me, but there, I know how to achieve happiness ... You see, my dear friend, that I have found an excellent remedy against boredom and grief; unhappy in reality, I'm happy in my head, and that's all I need' (OC, i, 236-7). It is possible to see in this declaration by Saint-Leger of the artist's almost absolute right to rearrange reality by the power of imagination an attempt by Hugo to excuse the play's lack of verisimilitude on the grounds that the pleasure art offers is of greater value than mere plausibility. This is the type of pleasure comic opera proposes. The lines just quoted have also been taken, by Vasseur for instance, to relate to Hugo himself who, still confined in the Cordier Pension in 1817 and separated from his mother, was deeply unhappy. Art's self-reflexivity appears at least once more in the play's finale where, Prospero-like, M. d'Escour, Celine's father, draws an analogy between his indulgent treatment of the lovers and the good-natured reception authors, particularly young ones, need to receive from the public: 'Yes, like any loving father, I do want to make the lovers happy. (Addresses the stalls.) Gentlemen, can authors expect a similar kindness from you? If, by chance, you pardon them their youth, they will joyfully repeat \"Chance is good for something\"' (OC, 1, 273). Hugo was not here abandoning his 'rough magic,' but he certainly put aside comedy after A.Q.C.H.E.B. Not until Le Theatre en liberte would he write another play that ends well for all the protagonists. A.QC.H.E.B. is also the last of Hugo's plays, until his exile in the 18505, not expressly written for public performance. The reason is simple enough: if he was to make his living as a professional writer, his works would need to make money. But in 1818 he had not yet decided on a final choice of career. In that year, as well as entitling one of his poems 'Mes Adieux a 1'enfance,' Hugo received permission from his father to study law, studies he continued until 1821. Victor and Eugene also left the Cordier boarding school to live again with Mme Hugo, where Victor wrote in two weeks the first version of his novel, Bug-Jargal to win a bet. One event that did incline him towards a literary career was his 1820 meeting with Chateaubriand: the sight of the old writer at the peak of his fame fuelled the boy's ambition to be a great author.\n\nl8\n\nHugo and the Romantic Drama\n\nIn 1819 Hugo's ode on the restoration of Henri iv's statue in Paris won the grand prize, the 'Golden Lily,' in the poetry competion called the 'Floral Games,' organized by the Academy of Toulouse. In April, Victor and Adele Foucher, daughter of a family long friendly with the Hugos, declared their love for each other, and Victor made many visits to the Fouchers in Issy that summer. A secret correspondence between the lovers, begun in January 1820, was discovered by Mme Hugo in April. Despite the friendship between the two families, she refused to contemplate the marriage, and broke off relations with the Fouchers. Until her death on 27 June 1821, Adele and Victor were forbidden to see one another. In July 1821 Adele's father allowed their betrothal, making clear that marriage was out of the question unless Victor could prove his ability to support a wife. The lovers were forced once again into a clandestine correspondence, and family disputes followed, during one of which on 11 April 1822, Adele threatened suicide in an attempt to break her father's opposition to the marriage. M. Foucher may well have found more persuasive the signs that Victor's name was becoming known in literary and even in court circles. In March 1820, Hugo received 500 francs from Louis xvm for his 'Ode on the Death of the Due de Berry,' and in June 1822 he was awarded an annual royal pension of 1200 francs on the publication of his Odes et poesies diverses. The marriage was approved by both fathers, but a problem remained, preventing the couple from being married in church: Victor had never been baptized. Armed with a false declaration, signed by his father, that the baptism had taken place abroad, Hugo and Adele were finally able to marry at Saint-Sulpice on 12 October 1822. Much more disturbing than the bureaucratic irregularity was the change in the character of Eugene, Hugo's elder brother and friendly rival in the various literary competitions they both entered. Rivalry had turned into envy on Eugene's part, as he saw his brother's greater success, and into sexual jealousy, when he saw that Adele preferred Victor to himself. The first sign that all was not well was a letter to Victor on 14 July 1818 from Felix Biscarrat, the boys' friend and tutor at the Cordier boarding school, who wrote of his fears concerning Eugene's sanity. His parents' separation and the resulting division of loyalties and frequent changes of residence cannot have added, during his eighteen years, to Eugene's mental stability. In March 1820 Eugene withdrew from the editorial board of the review, Le Conservateur Litteraire, which the three Hugo brothers had founded in 1819. Then in April 1822 Eugene suddenly disappeared, having apparently set off towards Blois to convince himself that Leopold, his father, really had married again. Arrested in Chartres without papers, Eugene had to write for his father's help to obtain his release from jail. But the climax came\n\nYouth and Dramatic Juvenilia\n\n19\n\nduring the night following Victor's marriage to Adele. She gives the following account, in which her presence as eyewitness to some of the events in question should be noted: 'During the night, Eugene had become violent and Abel had called to him [Biscarrat] to help care for his brother. For some time now, Eugene had been a cause for concern, as the strangeness of his mind became more apparent ... All our strength and love were needed to control the fit. Victor rushed to his brother. Medication and good nursing pacified the sick man, but he was never to regain his reason.'13 In fact, after attempting to care for Eugene themselves, the family were forced, after another violent outburst, to have him permanently committed in June 1823 to the asylum at Charenton. Not allowed vistors because of the violent nature of his condition, he died there in 1837. By the end of his period as a juvenile or adolescent dramatist, Victor Hugo had tried all the genres then prevalent in the French theatre, from neo-classical tragedy to melodrama, and even comic opera. But, not unnaturally, none of these youthful efforts gained more than a general reading by a troupe of actors. His next plays would encounter all the practical problems that timid or dictatorial theatre managers, recalcitrant actors, incompetent theatrical costumiers and set designers, the official censor, and the notoriously flighty Parisian theatre-going public placed in the way of a young and productive dramatist. It is time to examine the conditions under which plays were produced in France, particularly in Paris, in the 18205.\n\n2. Theatre in France 1800-1830\n\nP O L I T I C A L E V E N T S : G O V E R N M E N T A N D THEATRE After the Revolution, the number of theatres in Paris and the provinces rose considerably. In 1791 the National Assembly proclaimed the freedom of theatres by a decree which authorized 'any citizen to open a public theatre and to play there dramatic works of any genre.' This latter stipulation replaced the monopoly to present classical tragedy or comedy that statefunded theatres like the Comedie-Francaise had enjoyed before the Revolution. In 1792 the Assembly made Schiller, one of the foreign authors most admired by theorists and practitioners of Romantic drama, an honorary Citizen of the French Republic. In 1793 the Convention established free performances 'for and by the people,' an act which extended the pleasure of theatre-going to the popular classes. The aim was to promote theatre as a means of educating the people in civic virtue, a role the melodrama filled admirably, with its fables involving the poetic justice which rewarded virtuous characters after their struggles against antisocial evil-doers. The result of such liberalizing acts was disastrous for the state-subsidized theatres which lost their bourgeois audience to the almost two hundred popular theatres which sprang up between 1791 and the end of the century. But the liberalizing trend ended when Napoleon became Emperor. Anxious to establish a national theatre which would both reflect France's recently acquired glory and good taste and provide a link between his new institutions and those of the Ancien Regime, he immediately took steps to rebuild the prestige and increase the subsidy of the Comedie-Francaise.\n\nTheatre in France, 1800-1830\n\n21\n\nIn so doing he built upon a policy begun in 1799 by the Directory which on 25 Floreal an VII (14 May 1799) signed into law an agreement with twenty-seven actors of the troupe that was to occupy the new theatre on the rue de Richelieu. The government gave the troupe the right to occupy the theatre, and to exploit the necessary furniture and sets it contained. The government also paid the Society's debts and re-established members' pensions. In return the 'citizen artists' undertook to open the new Theatre of the French Republic,' which they did on 11 Prairial an VII (30 May 1799), with Corneille's Le Cid and Moliere's L'Ecole des maris.* In return for financial support for the new theatre, which became from 1804 to 1814 the 'Emperor's Theatre,' Napoleon made full use of its dramatic and propagandistic possibilities. He frequently ordered command performances both at home in his various palaces and abroad on the occasion of his diplomatic visits to foreign cities. In all, Napoleon commanded performances of some 45 tragedies and 79 comedies from the actors of his theatre in cities as widely apart as Brussels (1803), Mayence (1804), Erfurt (1808), and Dresden (1813). He stipulated the presence either of his favourite actors, including the great tragedian Talma, whom we will meet later, or of the whole company, as was the case during his meeting with Czar Alexander at Erfurt in 1808. In 1806 an Imperial decree named as the four 'major theatres' of Paris the Opera, the Empereur (or Comedie-Francaise), the Empress (or Odeon), and the Opera-Comique. The repertoire for each was carefully defined, with each reacquiring its pre-Revolution monopoly. The Emperor's Theatre gained the right to the repertoire of the old ComedieFrancaise. The Empress Theatre acquired the exclusive right to any new play premiered there, and the Opera and Opera-Comique had exclusive rights in their respective genres. Another Imperial decree of 1807 limited the 'minor theatres' of Paris to four. Melodramas, farces and pantomimes were to be played at the Gaite and Abigu-Comique Theatres. At the Varietes and the Vaudeville, popular audiences could see parodies, peasant plays, and popular musical shows. The only 'minor' theatre to contest this restriction was the Porte-Saint-Martin, the most popular of the 'boulevard' theatres, called also the 'people's opera,' and the venue to which Hugo and Alexandre Dumas pere were to bring their Romantic dramas after breaking with the Comedie-Francaise. An 1809 decree authorized the reopening of the Porte-Saint-Martin theatre which, thanks to astute management and the popularity of melodrama, was soon the most financially successful theatre in Paris. The 'boulevard' theatres were so called because they occupied neighbouring sites along the boulevard du Temple in northeastern Paris. The section of the grand boulevard they occupied became known also as the\n\n22\n\nHugo and the Romantic Drama\n\n'boulevard du Crime,' celebrated in our century in Marcel Game's 1945 film, Les Enfants du paradis, in which Pierre Brasseur offers a sympathetic portrait of the greatest of Romantic actors, one whom Hugo called upon whenever he was available, Frederick Lemaitre. In 1823 a proposal came forward to substitute the boulevard's nickname for its official name, and the Almanack des Spectacles explained why: We have counted up the crimes that have been committed on the boulevard in the last twenty years. This is what we discovered: Tautin has been stabbed 16,302 times, Marty has been poisoned in one way or another 11,000 times, Fresnoy has been killed in various ways 27,000 times, Mile Adele Dupuis has in her innocence been seduced, abducted or drowned 75,000 times, 6,400 capital charges have tested Mile Levesque's virtue, while Mile Olivier, who has only recently begun her career, has already drunk 16,000 times from the cup of crime and vengeance. Unless we are mistaken, that makes 151,702 crimes to be shared among six individuals who none the less appear to enjoy excellent health and widespread esteem.2\n\nThe article attests both to the violent onstage action that melodrama used to such spectacular effect, and to the genre's enormous popularity: even allowing for comic hyperbole on the reporter's part, the figures imply a considerable number of separate performances. Evidently the centre of theatrical life had shifted from the Palais-Royal district to the boulevard du Crime. Nothing confirms this shift better than Napoleon's unsuccessful attempts to impose a neo-classical repertoire on his official state theatre. Theatre receipts of the time show that the plays written by imitators of Corneille, Racine, and Voltaire simply did not draw the public, despite all of the great Talma's skill and popularity. Even productions of tragedies or comedies by the three great classics themselves, Corneille, Racine, and Moliere barely recovered the minimal costs expended on the (threadbare) sets and costumes necessary to produce them. Maurice Descotes explains that when actors' annual salaries were paid (6,000 francs for a principal role, male or female, down to 2,000 francs or 1,200 francs for a Chief or Second Confidant, respectively), along with a system of free passes which saw up to a third of the total house handed out to courtiers, the press, the claque, friends of authors, actors, administrators etc. (many of whom then sold the free tickets for their own profit), even the high ticket prices charged at the Emperor's Theatre could not begin to meet expenses (DRGC, 15). The financial debacle meant not only that scenery, sets and period costumes (actors paid for their own contemporary costumes at the time) were used over and over again, thus confirming the Comedie as a\n\nTheatre in France, 1800-1830\n\n23\n\ntheatre of almost pure declamation without visual spectacle, it made the state subsidy not just attractive but absolutely vital to the theatre's survival. Along with financial help, however, came interference and censorship, both before and after the Restoration. Since the public censor will play so central a role in preventing the performance of Victor Hugo's Romantic dramas, the institution deserves examination.3 The new ideal of freedom from the censorship of public performances introduced by the Revolution did not last long. Napoleon instituted state censorship of plays in 1800 and enforced it rigorously until his abdication in 1815. Even plays by great literary figures were forbidden in his reign: Voltaire's Merope and Tancrede, for instance, were refused a place in the Emperor Theatre's repertoire. Especially open to charges of political sedition were plays on modern subjects and such plays, even when successful outside France, were banned in Paris: a case in point is Duval's Edouard en Ecosse, banned by the Imperial censor for its supposed royalist leanings. Perhaps nothing displays more clearly Napoleon's determination to dominate his state theatre than the decrees he dictated in 1812 from Moscow with the city virtually in flames about his ears. (The only contender for most exemplary incident in this context occurred during the Hundred Days, when he attended a performance of Hector, a neo-classical tragedy by the now forgotten Lance de Lancival at the [hastily renamed] Emperor's Theatre on 21 April 1815, less than two months before Waterloo.) In Moscow Napoleon somehow found time not only to thwart the financial demands of the Theatre's then female star, Mile Mars, he also signed a decree, on 15 October 1812, laying down 101 articles relating to the operation of the Theatre, many of which are still in force today. The Emperor's Commissioner (who became the Royal Commissioner after the Restoration) was to superintend the plays presented and organize the day-to-day and long-term running of the house. The decree also defined the duties of the cashier, the budgetary arrangements, including actors' salaries, pensions and the sharing of profits. It outlined the procedure for broadening the repertoire by accepting new plays, clarified the rights of authors and the responsibilities of actors, particularly with regard to casting and leaves of absence, both sources of dispute in the preceding years. The decree also set rules for the Theatre's 'School of Declamation,' where young actors received their training. After the Restoration Napoleon's decrees continued to regulate the renamed Comedie-Francaise with minimal cosmetic changes imposed by the new political regime. Conflicting political loyalties, as shown by riots in the theatre in 1818, caused the censorship of plays to continue, with the difference that the ban now affected plays judged to be Bonapartist in\n\n24\n\nHugo and the Romantic Drama\n\ntenor. Censorship would continue until after the 1830 Revolution, when Louis-Philippe abolished it for a few months only, as Hugo was to find to his cost. Neo-classical plays continued at the Comedie-Francaise, but despite Talma's magic they failed to cover expenses. Not until the arrival in 1825 of Baron Taylor as Commissioner did the Comedie-Francaise turn towards young Romantic dramatists like Vigny, Dumas, and Hugo as a possible means of warding off bankruptcy. But even Taylor, partly because of the extra expenses on set-construction and on the authentic costumes demanded by the historically minded new dramatists, and because of his frequent absences from Paris on archeological expeditions, failed to change the financial situation of the theatre. Cushioned by the subsidy, flattered by their status as the premier troupe of France, the actors at the Comedie were prepared to accept a situation that Ubersfeld qualifies as 'catastrophic.' She bases her judgment on the theatre's receipts in the fall of 1830, which is eight months after the premiere, and eventual financial success, of Hugo's Hernani: 'The balance sheet for September and October 1830 at the Comedie-Francaise is particularly edifying ... [SJince we know that costs amounted to about 1,400 francs for each performance, and that receipts went as low as 241 francs on 22 October, and 270 francs on 8 September (there are 21 performances with receipts of less than 700 francs in the two months), we have some idea of the size of the catastrophe' (RB, 48-9). If subsidized theatre's condition was virtually inoperable, how was it that the boulevard theatres were thriving? The answer involves looking at several aspects of Parisian theatre between 1800 and 1830. PARIS THEATRE BEFORE THE ROMANTIC DRAMA\n\nFirst, ticket prices were lower at the popular theatres, so that while bourgeois patrons of the Comedie-Francaise could easily afford to patronize the Porte-Saint-Martin theatre if they so chose, the more numerous workingclass audience that occupied the 'Paradise' or 'Gods' at the theatres on the 'boulevard du Crime' could not so easily afford the Comedie-Francaise. Maurice Descotes lists differences in ticket prices ranging from between 30 per cent for the most expensive seats in the two theatres (C.-F. 6fr.6o, P.-S.-M. 4fr.) to up to 60 per cent for the cheapest seats (C.-F. ifr.So, P.-S.-M. ofr.60; DRGC, 9). Obviously, the social and intellectual differences between, and expectations of, the two audiences would also show themselves in any theatre they patronized. It is difficult to imagine the young, penniless artists who would form part of Hugo's supporting claque at the 'battle' of Hernani behaving as the following remark claims was typical of patrons of the Comedie: '\"Fashionable Society,\" the \"elite\" returned to the Comedie Francaise [after the Restoration]; it was the official stage on which the classical masterpieces were acted, and it was good taste to come\n\nTheatre in France, 1800-1830\n\n25\n\nalong for some noble boredom. Right from the time of the Empire, middle-class ladies had their boxes where they spent an hour or so showing off their diamonds.' M. Descotes also cites an amusing article from the Globe (i January 1825): 'Go, if you dare, and find a seat once a week in the stalls at the Comedie-Francaise, in the midst of the group of experts whose formal demeanour and dignified pose betray their claim to be there to judge the play, much more than their desire to enjoy it... in their view the theatre is a kind of academy where pompous declaimers methodically recite long speeches' (RB, 45). As well as being useful in characterizing attitudes in the audience at the Comedie-Francaise, once satiric hyperbole is discounted, this passage also touches on the antiquated style of acting which separated the official troupe, still the best in Paris at declaiming plays written in alexandrine verse, from popular boulevard actors like Lemaitre, Marie Dorval, or Bocage. Despite its stars, Talma and Mile Mars, to whom we shall return, acting at the Comedie-Francaise still reflected the lessons in declamation taught in its school by former members of the troupe like the great Voltairean actor, Henri Lekain.4 Accounts of the day speak of the actors' habit of standing in a bunch around the prompter's box,5 declaiming their tirades to the public without so much as looking at each other, even during dramatic climaxes. One commentator even added that 'too often, the actor who is not speaking, stares off into the boxes, to see who is in them, which totally destroys the illusion.'6 Critical judgments of such a performance can do no more, logically, than commend or criticize the physical attributes of performers, their skill at memorization, at vocal mellifluousness and rhythmic recitation of the twelve-syllable lines. Before Talma's innovations, little attempt was made to suggest violent emotion other than by the conventional 'sob' which frequently marked the caesura, the slight pause at the hemistich. Talma's greatness as premier tragic actor at the Comedie until his death in 1826 which prevented Hugo's offering him the title role in Cromwell, a play in which he had apparently shown great interest,7 saved for a time the neo-classical tragedies still being performed there. His death signalled their demise. Some of Talma's innovations directly anticipated Hugo's remarks in the Preface to Cromwell. Talma's study of the classical statuary produced by the official Imperial sculptor David, his seeking out in museums, art galleries, and libraries authentic historical models and adopting them for his costumes, rather than relying on the anachronistic, fashionable dress actors continued to wear even when playing Roman or Greek characters, form one of his innovations. He also preferred the violent stage effects that English dramatists, Shakespeare particularly, offered the actors and that French classical tragedy denied them. According to Maurice Descotes' reading of contemporary reviews, Talma played Hamlet as a 'man pos-\n\n26\n\nHugo and the Romantic Drama\n\nsessed, at once lucid and terrifying ... Right from his first entry, his disorder and inarticulate cries, the terror on his face made visible to the public the ghost of his father following on his heel; and during the recounting of the murder, his eye, going in turn to his mother and then to Claudius, expressed \"his various impressions by admirably diverse means,\" which the narration concerning the two characters produced upon him' (DRGC, 29). Shakespeare was to influence French actors in other ways, as we shall see. Marvin Carlson, a specialist in the drama of the Revolutionary period and after, points to other ways in which Talma, out of his concern to save classical tragedy from oblivion, sought to increase its emotional appeal to contemporary audiences: 'In the fourth act of [Racine's] Britannicus, for example, during Agrippine's lengthy harangue of Neron, tradition kept the young emperor glum and quiet, but Talma wearily adjusted his robe, toyed with the arm of his chair, followed patterns on his garment. Some critics, such as Charles Nodier ... on the Journal des Debats, protested against this spreading of the drame into tragedy, but the general public was delighted. Even more daring were the innovations in Etienne de Jouy's Sylla (1821) ... For the first time a classic tragedy made extensive use of crowd scenes; for the first time a tragic hero lay down in a bed on stage' (FS, 29). It is no wonder that Talma was harshly criticized by his own colleagues at the Comedie, as unused to being upstaged as were conventionally trained actors in the 19505 by their colleagues of the 'Method' school of acting. The Comedie's female star, Mile Mars, was not as interested in innovation as Talma. She was famous for her roles as coquette in classical comedies. Beginning in 1810 with ingenueroles like Agnes in Moliere's L'Ecole des femmes, she went on to play all the grandes coquettes in the comedies of Moliere and Marivaux: Celimene, Elmire, Araminte, Suzanne, adding to them some of the great lovers in these plays: Sylvia, Rosine, Henriette, and Isabelle. Beautiful, elegant, and imperious, she ruled at the ComedieFrangaise after Talma's death, demanding (and getting) unheard-of salaries, permitting herself illicit leaves of absence and lengthy provincial or foreign tours, and exercising her absolute right to pick and choose among the leading roles in old and new plays. This right explains why Mars, primarily a comedienne, was to play the ultimately tragic Dona Sol in Hugo's Hernani. Although she disliked Romantic rhetoric, the play was important; her prestige demanded, therefore, that as the uncontested star of the Comedie, she must play the new heroine, even if at fifty-one she seemed an unlikely candidate for the role of an eighteen-year-old. The reason she was able to dominate the state theatre for so long was, naturally, financial: she could attract an audience to a theatre badly in need of one. As to her acting itself, Jules Janin described it as follows: 'Mile Mars's act-\n\nTheatre in France, 1800-1830\n\n27\n\ning was cerebral, well reasoned, most highly intelligent. This is what limited her. She was marvellous at acting out the tricks of a coquette; she could dismiss an importunate lover with inimitable scorn, brush off a bore rudely yet without giving offence. But witty roles suited her better than those demanding feeling; she was good at speaking from the head, not so good at speaking from the heart. / To serve her gifts, Mile Mars had a voice admired by all her contemporaries. They described it as supple, fresh, cristalline, quite the opposite of Mme Dorval's voice, deep, hoarse, trivial on occasion' (DRGC, 74) .8 Mile Mars' undoubted intelligence enabled her to see in the Romantic drama one means of renewing a moribund theatrical repertoire. And when the occasion presented itself in 1827, it enabled her also to recognize, and imitate, the new style of English acting, a style she was to exploit in her appearances in the dramas of Hugo, Dumas, and Vigny. In the history of the Romantic drama, nothing shows more clearly the virtue of arriving in the right place at the right time than the second of the three visits to Paris made by English companies between 1822 and 1832. In 1822, which was too soon after Waterloo for the liking of most Parisians, the actors were booed off the stage with cries of 'Down with Shakespeare; he's an aide-de-camp of Wellington' (RS, 169). The second English troupe, including among its members such accomplished actors as Kemble, Kean, Macready, and Harriet Smithson, would triumph in Paris in 1827-8, however, leaving behind an influence on Romantic dramatists that, as they admit in their memoirs or theoretical texts, is hard to exaggerate. Mme Hugo, for instance, recounts as follows the effect the performances by the English actors had in 1828 on her husband: 'Victor Hugo attended Miss Smithson's brilliant debut-performances and, for the first time, saw Shakespeare acted. At that moment, he was writing the Preface to Cromwell and he was inspired to write this commentary on the English master's dramatic art: \"[Shakespeare] this god of the theatre, in whom appear to be united the three great geniuses who characterize our theatre: Corneille, Moliere, Beaumarchais\"' (VHR, 420). Alexandre Dumas was even more emphatic in describing the first night of Hamlet, 11 September 1827: 'This was the first time that I saw in the theatre real passions felt by men and women of real flesh and blood.'9 And by the time that a third English troupe returned in 1832, French dramatists, actors, stage managers, set designers and costumemakers had so well learned their lesson about Shakespearean mise en scene that these English performances were compared, to their detriment, to the recent triumphs of Frederick, Marie Dorval, Bocage, and others. Since Shakespeare, along with Schiller, is generally regarded as the principal influence on French Romantic drama, it is worth tracing the history of the knowledge and reception of his works in France at this time. Audi-\n\n28\n\nHugo and the Romantic Drama\n\nences in the late eighteenth century knew his plays in the 1769-92 translations byJean-Frangois Ducis. But as Carlson explains in recounting an 1804 revival of Ducis' version of Hamlet, his 'translations' were in fact adaptations or bowdlerizations of Shakespeare: 'As in all of Ducis' Shakespearean adaptations, great care had been taken to adjust or weed out English irregularities. Ophelia is made the daughter of Claudius to give Hamlet a Cornelian choice between love and duty. Gertrude deserts the king to aid Hamlet, who is not killed but crowned at the end' (FS, 24). Ducis had no English, basing his adaptations on Letourneur's 1778-83 translations. France would have to wait for more faithful translations of Shakespeare until Vigny's not entirely successful attempts in 1828-9, and then until Francois-Victor Hugo, the dramatist's son, produced a complete translation, published between 1859 and 1866. When Kean played Hamlet in Paris in 1827, however, he did so in English and, if the words were little understood by the young unilingual Romantic enthusiasts, his style of acting bore out everything they were saying against declamatory fossilization at the Comedie-Francaise. The English troupe stayed in Paris from September 1827 to July 1828 (although the stars came and went as repertoire demanded), time enough for a varied season of Shakespearean offerings which overturned French notions of, among other dramatic conventions, stage propriety. Comment was aroused, for instance, by the Romeo and Juliet of Kemble and Miss Smithson. In the balcony scene, the actors remained upstage (where the balcony was), never looking at the audience; in fact, Kemble never once turned his head towards the house, and Miss Smithson's asides were made to the side, rather than to the public. Etienne Delecluze noted the following remarks in his diary after attending a performance of Richard III starring Edward Kean, the actor who most impressed Dumas and Hugo: 'Richmond and Richard fight with swords for five or six minutes. Richard is finally stabbed by his opponent. Richard-Kean, when he receives the wound, stays on his feet staggering about. He continues to wave his sword, then he drops it and soon with his empty hand, he pretends to continue fencing. Finally Kean falls down, and writhing around in that position, speaks half-a-dozen lines that form no more a part of the play than does any of the pantomime which preceded them' (DRGC, 38). Clearly, conservative French spectators like Delecluze preferred the convention whereby such disturbing events as death occurred in the wings, while motionless actors declaimed the author's lines to the public. Other commentators, the Romantic poet Heinrich Heine, for example, have left their impressions of performances they attended. Even Heine found the English style of Shakespearean acting 'not against nature, but rather nature exaggerated.' He complained about the 'shouting' of both\n\nTheatre in France, 1800-1830\n\n29\n\nmale and female actors, adding that it was possibly explained by the greater size of English popular theatres, as compared to the French houses (DRGC, 38-9). Some French actors, on the other hand, were paying careful attention to these new ways of portraying death or madness, believing that such histrionic techniques would enable them better to express emotion or counterfeit physical pain. They also acquired some of the tricks associated with the English stars: Kemble's sardonic, or 'satanic,' laugh made its reappearance in 1831 when Bocage played the title role in Dumas' Antony. Dumas is the best source for comparisons of English and French actors before and after 1827-8. In his Souvenirs dramatiques, he compares, for instance, five different interpretations of Othello: 'I saw the Othellos of Talma, Kean, Kemble, Macready, and Joanny [Talma's successor as principal tragedian at the Comedie-Francaise]. Talma's Othello was a Moor with a veneer of Venetian civilization; Kean's was a wild beast, half tiger, half man; Kemble's was a man in his maturity, hot-headed and violent; Macready's was an Arab from the time of the Moors in Spain, elegant and chivalrous;Joanny's Othello was ...Joanny' (DRGC, 41). And on the subject of Othello's suicide Dumas writes: Talma used a downward thrust; Joanny followed the tradition established by Talma; Kean and Kemble drove home the dagger horizontally. Macready stabbed himself under the ribs with an upward movement. Then he introduced something that had a great effect on the audience: although wounded, he retained the strength necessary to get to the bed, and, speaking Desdemona's name with his last gasp, fell, kissing in death his victim's hand' (ibid., 41). Unlike Joanny, some French actors learned well, using the English style of acting to hone their own techniques. The most famous boulevard actors, Frederick Lemaitre and Marie Dorval, form a case in point. By all accounts, Lemaitre's acting had the two characteristics most despised at the Comedie-Francaise: it was instinctive, and it made him a star big enough to ignore their socio-artistic pretentions. He had little dramatic training, except for a few months at the Conservatoire where, encouraged by his teacher Pierre Lafon, he tried and failed the audition to join the Odeon, the Comedie-Francaise's left-bank house. He began his career in boulevard theatre, achieving stardom in 1824 as Robert Macaire, a vicious bandit who tearfully repents as he dies, in a formula-melodrama, L'Auberge desAdrets, written by a 'committee' of three authors, Saint-Amand (with whom Frederick was to write a sequel, Robert Macaire, in 1834), Antier, and Polyanthe. One of Frederick's biographers continues: 'Frederick ... shuddered at the threadbare plot, the tearful recognition scenes, the stilted dialogue and the unconvincing ending. / Then he had a sudden inspiration: instead of playing Macaire straight, as a sinister villain, he would turn him into a gay, cynical rascal, quipping as he killed ... / The\n\n30\n\nHugo and the Romantic Drama\n\nsame evening he told the actor Firmin, who had been cast as Bertrand [Macaire's accomplice] that he intended to guy the part of Macaire, and Firmin readily agreed to follow his example.'10 This flash of inspiration made him a star and provided him with as reliable a breadwinner as was to be for Bernhardt her faithful work-horse, La Dame aux camelias by Dumas fils. The passionate, earthy style of acting necessary for playing principal roles in boulevard theatre served Frederick well when, among his many successes, he acted Hamlet, Falstaff, Don Cesar de Bazan, Ruy Bias, or Kean. The two latter roles were written for him by Hugo and Dumas, both of whom considered him to be the consummate Romantic actor. The most obvious modern French actor comparable to Frederick, one also known, among other successes, for his interpretation of the title role in Hugo's Ruy Bias, was Gerard Philippe, no more afraid than Lemaitre of being criticized on occasion for 'going over the top' in his portrayals, or for 'chewing up the scenery' in the productions in which he starred. This resemblance between two popular stars brings up an important question: How should these 'larger-than-life' Romantic heroes, heroines, and villains be played? At a revival of Ruy Bias at the Comedie-Francaise in 1938, Colette recorded her doubts concerning the willingness of modern actors to impersonate such characters and also concerning a modern audience's reluctance to accept the Romantic style of acting: 'I don't think that actors can be recruited from any French troupe nowadays willing to play Romantic drama romantically. Victor Hugo's theatre must be acted as its author conceived it, grandiloquently, with fire, great outbursts of wild emotion, contrasts of light and shadow, exaggerated facial expressions. Who at the Comedy will take on, among other risks, that of a ridiculousness so splendid and generous that it commands admiration; who will dare readily to groan, yell, tear out his hair, address (tutoyer) the Great Ones of the earth with undue familiarity, summon up the Devil and threaten Heaven itself?'11 Colette had not seen Gerard Philippe, whose Ruy Bias was in any case, according to contemporary accounts, all the more effective for being understated rather than overacted, but clearly Frederick's was a hard act to follow even for popular stars. We will have occasion to discuss the ways in which this 'boulevard Talma,' the 'French Kean,' as he was also called, prepared a role during rehearsals of Hugo's Lucrece Borgia and Ruy Bias. If Mile Mars was the star of comedy at the state-funded ComedieFrancaise, the queen of melodrama in the popular boulevard theatres was Marie Dorval. The two actresses would play against each other in 1835 in Hugo's Angela at the Porte-Saint-Martin theatre. Like Frederick's, Dorval's apprenticeship was practical. Before arriving in Paris she acted in touring companies for several years, playing the varied popular repertory that\n\nTheatre in France, 1800-1830\n\n31\n\ndeveloped her deep, emotional voice later commented upon by all the Parisian critics of her day. She had the same good luck as Frederick in her lessons at the Conservatoire: not fitting the mould, she was dismissed, thus not having time to acquire the limiting method then taught there by retired members of the Comedie. In 1818, at twenty, she began her career at the Porte-Saint-Martin theatre, playing ingenues, victimized virgins (for example in Le Vampire [1820], another 'committee' melodrama, this time by Carmouche, Nodier, and Jouffroy), and tearful wives. By 1827 her roles as passionate, frequently heart-broken, sometimes brutalized, heroines had made her the female star equivalent to Frederick. In that year both actors starred in Trente Ans ou la Vie d'unjoueur (The Life of a Gambler), a popular work by Victor Ducange, writer of melodramas. During her subsequent liaison with Vigny she subsequently played to great acclaim Kitty Bell in his Chatterton, a Romantic drama whose success at the time was largely due to a spectacular fall down a staircase she accomplished each night in 'dying.' Theophile Gautier, Hugo's 'lieutenant' at the 'battle' of Hernani, and historian of nineteenth-century French theatre, has this to say of her acting: 'Her talent was completely passi"
