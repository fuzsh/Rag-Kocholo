        "text": "I feel like I need to follow up on my long-ago prediction that the film of Les Misérables was going to be awesome, because that proved so dramatically false. And Russell Crowe was only part of the problem.\n\nSo, allow me to present a post I’ve been meaning to make for a long time: Why Les Misérables Is Not the Dramaturgical Hot Mess It May Initially Appear and How the Movie Screwed Up By Assuming That It Was.\n\n…let’s call it “The Dramaturgy of Les Mis” for short.\n\nOne of the features of the new film which I found most interesting was the various ways in which it streamlined the story. And I don’t mean in terms of time. The film was about as long as the average stage production, yet somehow seemed to cover far less ground. The script tightened its focus much more directly on Jean Valjean’s journey to redemption, through trimming subplots, adding scenes and a musical number, and through sometimes very subtle lyric changes. All of these changes made perfect sense. They are the kind of focusing and trimming that I think most dramaturgs would recommend if given the script. Les Misérables is generally accepted as Jean Valjean’s story, and the stage musical loses track of him for huge swathes of time– most noticeably, when the plot reaches Paris and suddenly Marius, Eponine, and the revolutionaries take center stage. I recently found myself giving dramaturgical notes to a playwright which mostly consisted of various iterations of “focus” and “clarify”– figure out what the story’s actually about, then trim the fat. But applying this advice to the film of Les Misérables left a story which feels somewhat anemic. Why?\n\nFirst of all, what did the movie change? The most obvious example is the addition of a new song, “Suddenly,” to which some of my more cynical friends appended the subtitle, “For Your Best Original Song Consideration” (the rest of the music being ineligible). But the song is also hugely important as a stepping-stone in Valjean’s character arc which is very conspicuously missing from the musical. The musical never explicitly (and barely implicitly, frankly) states what “Suddenly” gives voice to: the specific redemptive power that Cosette’s presence has on Valjean’s life. The ability to love, crucial to Hugo’s novel and indeed one of the final sentiments of the play (“To love another person is to see the face of God”), is what makes Valjean able to truly repair his life. This is assumed in the play; in the film, it is stated.\n\nIt is stated several times, in fact, the final being in the final scene of the play. Earlier on, in Cosette and Valjean’s only real scene together, Cosette begs for stories about the past. In the musical, it’s her own past: her “questions and answers that somehow seem wrong” are about the identity of her mother and the circumstances of her barely-remembered childhood: “There’s so little I know that I’m longing to know/Of the child that I was in a time long ago.” In the movie, they are questions about Valjean, and the same line is, “There’s so little I know that I’m longing to know/Of the man that you were in a time long ago.” The question at the heart of their relationship becomes whether or not Valjean will ever trust in love enough to risk losing Cosette– either to the truth about his past, or to Marius. And both of these questions are answered. While the written confession that Valjean gives to Cosette as he is dying is described in the play as “the story of those who always loved you/Your mother gave her life for you and gave you to my keeping” in the movie, these lines are changed to, “the story of one who turned from hating/A man who only learned to love when you were in his keeping.” It’s a neat, linear payoff that feels connected and satisfying in a way that we expect movies to feel.\n\nThe side effect of this focus is, of course, serious trimming of every other subplot. The Thénardiers are barely present, Eponine has never felt so pointless, and God love you if you can manage to tell Grantaire apart from any of the other curly-haired students milling around in waistcoats. This trimming is what I think contributed to the weird duality of the film’s pacing: it felt both ponderously slow, and way too rushed. Long shots of Valjean climbing a mountain dragged, while the quick nods to the Thénardiers post-Master of the House felt choppy and almost out of place in their briefness. Tom Hooper, perfect logically, tried to give the film a plot (Valjean) and subplots (everyone else), and ration out screen time accordingly. Unfortunately, that’s just not what Les Misérables is.\n\nNow it’s time to talk about Victor Hugo.\n\nLes Misérables the novel simply is not Les Misérables the musical, and it can get annoying (and confusing– I’m looking at you, Tom Hooper) when people attempt to conflate their intentions. But that’s for another discussion of adaptation. And even though they’re different, some of Victor Hugo’s aesthetic principles can be really usefully applied to Les Misérables the musical. Here, I want to talk about the vision of Romantic theatre which he famously outlined in the preface to his remarkably awful play Cromwell. The ways in which Hugo’s ideas about Romanticism (and we’re talking about the capital-R movement here, not just romantic things) changed between Cromwell and Les Misérables and the degree to which he (or any theorist, really) actually follows his own rules are also separate problems. But Hugo discusses the idea of plot at some length, and his understanding of an ideal storyline illuminates a lot about the difficulties of trying to force Les Misérables into linearity.\n\n“But let us be careful not to confound unity with simplicity of plot. The former does not in any way exclude the secondary plots on which the principle plot may depend. It is necessary only that these parts […] shall tend constantly toward the central plot and group themselves about it at the various stages, or rather on the various levels of the drama. Unity of plot is the stage law of perspective.”\n\nHugo and other Romantic writers were bored by the Neoclassical movement which enforced a strict (mis)interpretation of Aristotle’s Poetics, and insisted on unity of time, place, and action. This meant that a “good play” followed one story in real time in one location. People fudged this, obviously, but Hugo was one of the first writers of the period to totally blow it apart. However, he still liked unity of plot– with the caveats quoted above. Unity, in his view, could also come from laying different ideas next to each other and seeing how they cast one another into relief. How Les Misérables fits into this idea is probably pretty obvious. Though Valjean’s redemptive journey is the “central plot,” the secondary plots and their movement around and alongside this main plot are no less essential to the overall picture. The shifting stage perspective brings different characters into lesser or greater focus at various moments in the story, but those shifts are still illuminating various facets of a single dramatic landscape.\n\nSo what is the dramatic landscape in question, anyway? The answer in concrete terms is pretty much “France after Napoleon,” which is vast and intimidating and the reason that the novel is 1500 pages long. The answer in thematic terms is a little more manageable, and what the musical focuses on, since there’s really no way to dramatize Hugo’s hundreds of pages of historical background and digressions. I think that the landscape of Les Misérables is a series of journeys to redemption– with Valjean’s as the centerpiece, naturally.\n\nA lot of this redemption comes through martyrdom: Fantine, Enjolras and the students on the barricade.\n\nOthers come through love: Marius, consumed with guilt at having failed to die alongside his friends, is brought back from despair by Cosette; Eponine begins to break away from her villainous relations out of love for Marius.\n\nAnd others, of course, reject redemption entirely: The Thénardiers are perfectly happy to remain amoral opportunists, thankyouverymuch.\n\nThe point I’m building to here is to highlight another major change in the film which was generally positively received (by which I mean, my friends liked it), but which irritated me, though it was essential to the film and I think symbolizes the differences between a linear Les Misérables and a panoramic Les Misérables. When Valjean dies, he is encouraged by the ghost of Fantine, who is then joined by the ghost of Eponine to sing possibly the most beautiful female duet ever written (–okay, maybe just in my opinion). In the movie, Eponine’s part is taken over by the Bishop who offered Valjean his blessing way back in the Prologue. In Les-Mis-As-Valjean’s-Story, this makes perfect sense: who better to assure him that he has indeed succeeded in following a path of goodness and Godliness than the man who set him on it in the first place? And in Tom Hooper’s adaptation, this was the only logical choice, because Eponine’s role was almost completely pointless and her presence there would have made no sense.\n\nSo why does it ever make sense? She’s never met Valjean, he has no reason to be comforted or pleased by her being there. But that’s because, in the panoramic view, the ending isn’t just about Valjean– it’s about everyone, and both Fantine and Eponine’s appearances are not about Valjean, but the women themselves. Their presence is an assurance that in spite of their degradation, in spite of the fact that unlike Valjean, they did not survive to reform their lives and repent for their sins, they too were redeemed. As the explicitly religious lyrics to the final reprise of “Do You Hear the People Sing?” remind us, we really can’t escape Christian morality here. (There are clear implications here about the way the film reduces all the female characters to accessories of male characters, whereas in the musical and novel they are given their own redemptive journeys… but look, I’m resisting discussing it!)\n\nSo yes, Les Misérables onstage is chaotic and often confusing and why on earth does the main character disappear for so long– but this chaos and confusion also provides scope. Themes are deepened by their repetition across characters and scenarios, and this makes them richer. Or at least, it makes them what Les Misérables was actually intended to be, which is so much more than just the story of Jean Valjean.\n\nOr of Hugh Jackman’s ridiculous age makeup."
