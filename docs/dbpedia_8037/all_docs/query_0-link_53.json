        "text": "What would be your favorite product material option?\n\nFor every product we offer a range of different materials and sizes. We allow you to pick your favorite size and material among the following product individualization options:\n\nCanvas: The printed canvas, not to be confused with an artwork painted on a canvas, is a digital image printed onto canvas. A canvas creates a exclusive effect of three dimensionality. The advantage of canvas prints is that they are relatively low in weight, meaning that it is quite simple to hang up your Canvas print without the support of extra wall-mounts. A canvas print is suited for any kind of wall.\n\nAcrylic glass print: The print on acrylic glass, which is sometimes named as a plexiglass print, transforms the original work of art into beautiful wall decoration. The work of art is custom-made thanks to the help of modern UV print machines. The special effect of this are deep and vivid color tones.\n\nPrinted poster (canvas material): The Artprinta poster is a UV printed sheet of flat canvas paper with a fine surface texture, which resembles the original version of the work of art. Please note, that depending on the size of the canvas poster print we add a white margin of approximately 2 - 6cm around the work of art to facilitate the framing with a custom frame.\n\nMetal (aluminium dibond print): This is a metal print manufactured on aluminium dibond material with a true depth. For our Direct Print On Aluminum Dibond, we print the selected artpiece right onto the aluminium composite white-primed surface.\n\nLegal disclaimer: We try what we can to depict our products as clearly as possible and to showcase them visually on the different product detail pages. Nonetheless, the colors of the print materials and the print result may vary to a certain extent from the representation on the device's monitor. Depending on your settings of your screen and the nature of the surface, colors can unfortunately not be printed as exactly as the digital version on this website. Considering that all our are printed and processed by hand, there may as well be minor variations in the exact position and the size of the motif.\n\nOriginal artwork information from the museum (© - Maison de Victor Hugo - Hauteville House - www.maisonsvictorhugo.paris.fr)\n\nLarge Canvas with a gold frame\n\nThis scene of the vigil under the triumphal arch, on the night of May 31 to June 1, 1885, Victor Hugo is on his deathbed, and before national Funeral, another highlight of mourning that stops the attention artists like Alfred Roll (inv. No. 211) or here Georges Clairin, night accentuating the dramaturgy of the funeral scene. Clairin shows the coffin of the poet before the immense catafalque designed by Charles Garnier, guarded by Republican Guards on horseback, carrying torches. In this documentary vision, it adds an allegorical figure holding a laurel wreath and a torch (?) Which, extending its luminous body is responding the light of glory and immortal genius to terrestrial flame guards.\n\nAs the 1887 exhibition catalog, George Clairin present there: \"CLAIRIN 542 (G.). H. C. Funeral of Victor Hugo; - the vigil. \"The work is reproduced in color in\" The illustrated Life. \" Image has variants with the picture of the museum (more finished look, unlike the winged genius and wreaths in the foreground, etc.) and bears a signature and the date \"1885\" on the site of the dedication to Mrs. Ménard-Dorian. A gravure Schwartzweber Schiltz & Co., published by Alph. Piaget, with \"military Salon 1887\" offers new variants with the painting of the museum and one reproduced in \"The illustrated Life.\" One can wonder if the fabric of the museum, freer execution and more lyrical, is not a sketch or a republic to be offered Aline Ménard-Dorian (whose daughter married Pauline Georges Hugo in 1894) , who held a Republican salon frequented by writers, painters and political man (it is considered one of Proust's models for the character of Verdurin). Georges Clairin was close to this republican middle and Hugo's because in addition to the painting on the wake, it left a portrait of Victor Hugo on his deathbed, autographed Jules Claretie (MVHPD0721).\n\nState funeral, Arc de Triomphe (Paris)\n\nWhat type of art product do we offer?\n\nThe more than 130 year old painting was created by the master Georges Jules Victor Clairin in 1885.
