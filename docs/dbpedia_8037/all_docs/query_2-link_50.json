        "text": "As field, dramaturgy has a long history. We like to think of it as beginning with Plato and Aristoteles (or maybe even with Aristophanes). To grasp the evolution of dramaturgy we need to combine studies of artworks and processes, societal structures, and studies of media-matrixes, with knowledge from theatre practice, science and history. Any experiment describing an evolution of a field has to consider its starting point, and its epistemological prerequisites. Is a theory of dramaturgy at all possible and necessary? In this article, I will present some arguments from my research on theories of dramaturgy. Patrice Pavis: \" We should, I would suggest, resume our theoretical labours, not necessarily by enumerating all the task of the dramaturge, but by looking for adequate methodological and theoretical tools, in order to think the new situation we are in. At stake might be the future of dramaturgy and its challenges.1 CHALLENGING EXPANSIONS An attempt to conceive a theory of dramaturgy gathers momentum in times when the concept and the functions are challenged by expansions. How wide a variety of different areas and professional functions can be managed by a theory behind the concept and its societal functions? In order to grasp the gravity and complexity of the situation, we need to identify some of the important expansions. I suggest a first study should consider five such parameters.\n\nObjects come in all sorts of shapes, sizes and forms. The notion of musical works as objects, represented by their written scores, has proved to be effete and limiting to the study of music as diverse social-cultural practice and performed craft. The past two decades have witnessed considerable efforts to renew conceptual and methodological tools, and Neumann's study makes a valuable contribution to this effect. This commentary responds to some issues raised by Neumann's article in relation to the notion of musical \"object\". Specifically, I retrace the shift from a score-based to a process-oriented musicology geared towards performances, placing the concerns of contemporary opera studies within this broader disciplinary change. I consider some implications of technology in mediating new operatic objects for discourse. Finally, I reflect on some of the inherent dangers of objectifying performance in empirical analyses."
