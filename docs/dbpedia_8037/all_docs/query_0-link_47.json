Peter Parnell’s new book embraces story theatre and features verbatim passages from Hugo’s gothic novel.\n\nThe musical begins as the bells of Notre Dame sound through the famed cathedral in fifteenth-century Paris. Quasimodo, the deformed bell-ringer who longs to be \"Out There,\" observes all of Paris reveling in the Feast of Fools. Held captive by his devious caretaker, the archdeacon Dom Claude Frollo, he escapes for the day and joins the boisterous crowd, only to be treated cruelly by all but the beautiful gypsy, Esmeralda. Quasimodo isn’t the only one captivated by her free spirit, though – the handsome Captain Phoebus and Frollo are equally enthralled. As the three vie for her attention, Frollo embarks on a mission to destroy the gypsies – and it’s up to Quasimodo to save them all.\n\nA sweeping score and powerful story make The Hunchback of Notre Damean instant classic. Audiences will be swept away by the magic of this truly unforgettable musical.\n\nDom Claude Frollo: Jerry West\n\nQuasimodo: Brad King\n\nEsmerelda: Anissa Cordova\n\nCaptain Phoebus de Martin: Marshall Mahoney\n\nClopin Trouillefou: Patrick Boylan\n\nEnsemble:\n\nAnna Lewis\n\nAudrey Cash\n\nAudrey Robertson\n\nBeth Ansede\n\nCara Doolittle\n\nChelsea Glass\n\nCourtney Poda\n\nDoug Hudock\n\nEmily Russell\n\nFrances Fields\n\nGarrett Maroney\n\nJeremy McCoy\n\nJaxon Coleman\n\nJulie Harris\n\nMeredith Boylan\n\nMo Pruiett\n\nRyan Avent\n\nTres Taylor\n\nTyler McKinney\n\nWesslen Romano\n\nChorus:\n\nBaylor Shull\n\nChapman Richards\n\nClare Henry\n\nErnesto Barquet, Sr.\n\nJackie Herron\n\nJacob Mastromonico\n\nLaitrice Allen\n\nMakayla Lee\n\nMegan Sims\n\nMichael George\n\nPeg Tribert\n\nRobert Cothran\n\nShirley King\n\nVirginia Boice\n\nDirected by Kyle Seconi"
