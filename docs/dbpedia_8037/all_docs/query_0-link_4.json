        "text": "Les Misérables by Victor Hugo and performed by The Lux Radio Theatre is much-loved and has enjoyed much popular success through its various adaptations as a musical, in the theatre, cinema, and on television. The lively and exquisitely characterised story follows convict Jean Valjean (Orson Welles) through a Paris bubbling with revolutionary fervour, as he seeks redemption for his crimes and previous lifestyle.A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens and performed by The Mercury Theatre on the Air is one of Dickens’ best-known stories, and has been the basis of many films and television series. Sidney Carton, the novel’s world-weary protagonist, traveling between London and revolution-torn Paris, is played captivatingly by the star of the Oscar-nominated 1935 film (Ronald Colman), who is supported by a strong cast."
