Likely novelists to be studied include Miguel de Cervantes, Samuel Richardson, Henry Fielding, Choderlos de Laclos, Jane Austen, Gustave Flaubert, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Henry James, Vladimir Nabokov, Franz Kafka, Tom McCarthy, and Zadie Smith. Film screenings will be scheduled and will also be available for watching in the library. Requirements: one paper of 5-6 pages, one paper of 7-8 pages, regular postings to the online discussion board, and in-class exercises. (LG - Fiction, LC)\n\nENGL 12001 The Literature of Riot: The Red Summer of 1919 and African American Literary History (Noah Hansen) | Autumn\n\n“The Red Summer of 1919” was a series of race riots that swept the U.S. at the end of WWI, marking a confluence of social tensions around race, labor, and migration with a wider crisis of the world imperial system. This course takes the centenary of 1919 as an opportunity to explore the Red Summer’s legacies in African American literature and political thought. Working in tandem with a series of public programs that aim to “confront the race riots,” we will examine how Black writers have responded directly and obliquely to the upheavals of 1919. Our archive, which includes selections from the early 20th century Black press, important literary treatments, and primary historical documents from http://chicago1919.org,will facilitate a geographically and temporally layered understanding of the Red Summer. Moving from Chicago to D.C. to the seaports of Britain, and from 1919 to the present, we will engage multiple scales of the Red Summer’s significance for racial capitalist modernity. At stake conceptually in the course are questions of historical interpretation and cultural memory: How does one “read” the events of 1919, both as inscriptions of social tensions in their own time, and in relation to the succeeding historical developments that have shaped their memorialization? How do we, and how can we, read 1919 in 2019? Readings include Claude McKay, Cyril Briggs, W.E.B. Du Bois, Marcus Garvey, Alain Locke, Toni Morrison, and Eve Ewing.\n\nENGL 12003 How to Do Things with Books in Britain, 1910-1960: Modernism, War, and After (Zachary Hope) | Autumn\n\nThis course examines the many forms and functions of the common reader in British literary history. Beginning with a look back at the early life of this reader, and especially at the purchase their literacies afford them within a burgeoning material culture, we then consider how these literacies and their material dependencies—their reading habits, spaces, and objects—are imperiled as variations of this reader live through experiences of total war, women’s suffrage, interwar anxiety, Blitzing, unhousing, reconstruction, postcolonial displacement, and other moments of profound social change. Readings will include novels, short stories, and essays by Virginia Woolf, E. M. Forster, Graham Greene, Elizabeth Taylor, Elizabeth Bowen, and George Lamming, alongside other contemporary cultural documents–magazines, films, Mass-Observation records—and select pieces of theory and criticism. Assignments include weekly posts, reading surveys, an autoethnography of your own reading habits, and a final paper.\n\nENGL 12320 Critical Videogame Studies (Patrick Jagoda) | Autumn\n\nSince the 1960s, games have arguably blossomed into the world’s most profitable and experimental medium. This course attends specifically to video games, including popular arcade and console games, experimental art games, and educational serious games. Students will analyze both the formal properties and sociopolitical dynamics of video games. Readings by theorists including Ian Bogost, Roger Caillois, Nick Dyer‐Witheford, Mary Flanagan, Jane McGonigal, Lisa Nakamura, and Katie Salen will help us think about the growing field of video game studies. This is a 2019-20 Signature Course in the College. (LT)\n\n*ENGL 14002 Postmodernism/Postmodernity (Zoe Hughes) | Autumn*\n\nPostmodernism is a late-twentieth century movement in literature, art, and philosophy that insists on the difference between the objective, or scientific, and lived, or experienced, world. This course introduces students to the central tenets of postmodernism by way of its predecessor, modernism. Is postmodernism a distinct movement or just a kind of modernism? To answer this question, students will engage in comparative analyses of paradigmatic modernist and postmodernist texts. Authors include Samuel Beckett, Octavia Butler, Jeanette Winterson, and Mark Danielewski. Topics include philosophies of art; inheritances of genres/forms, worlds, and technologies; and engagement with issues of race, gender, and sexuality. For the final, students will produce a postmodernist poem or short story or an essay explaining how a text of their choosing reflects and/or deviates from postmodernist norms. (LT)\n\nENGL 14320 Witnessing War (Rachel Galvin) | Autumn\n\nWar is a defining phenomenon of the twentieth century, yet there is no consensus on how to represent it. How can the experience of extremity or atrocity be described? Who might provide a more trustworthy account of events—a soldier, civilian eyewitness, news reporter, or philosopher? How do political bias and propaganda complicate our understanding of the reliability of war stories? We begin by evaluating arguments about war and its representation by a range of international writers including Wilfred Owen, W.B. Yeats, and Tim O’Brien. Next, we explore the intellectual’s role in witnessing war by reading Primo Levi’s autobiographical account of Auschwitz, The Drowned and the Saved, alongside critical texts by thinkers such as Giorgio Agamben, Jean-Paul Sartre, Edward Said, Susan Sontag, and Judith Butler. In the course of the quarter, we’ll examine a range of classic writings on war by Karl von Clausewitz, Immanuel Kant, Ernst Jünger, Sigmund Freud, Hannah Arendt, and others. In the last part of the course, we consider responses to the United States’ involvement in the wars of the twenty-first century. Texts may include Nick Flynn’s memoir The Ticking Is the Bomb and contemporary poetry from writers such as Don Mee Choi, Mónica de la Torre, Philip Metres, Solmaz Sharif, Juliana Spahr, Ocean Vuong, and C.D. Wright. We conclude with a look at war as represented in painting and photography, and a discussion of Susan Sontag’s controversial New York Times article about the American use of torture at Abu Ghraib prison. (LT)\n\nENGL 15302 King Arthur in Legend and History (Christina von Nolcken) | Autumn\n\nWe will consider the historical origins of the Arthurian Legend and some of the ways in which it has been reshaped and used in Britain. We will consider first how the legend was treated in the Middle Ages, most importantly by Geoffrey of Monmouth in the twelfth century and Thomas Malory in the fifteenth. Then we will turn to the extraordinary revival of interest in the legend that started with the Victorians and which has continued almost unabated to the present. In our discussions we will consider such matters as the political uses that have been made of the legend as well as some of the reasons for its enduring popularity. We will end with a viewing of the 1975 Film Monty Python and the Holy Grail. (LC)\n\nENGL 16600 Shakespeare II: Tragedies and Romances (Tim Harrison) | Autumn\n\nThis course explores mainly major plays representing the genres of tragedy and romance; most (but not all) date from the latter half of Shakespeare's career. After having examined how Shakespeare develops and deepens the conventions of tragedy in Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth, King Lear, and Antony and Cleopatra, we will turn our attention to how he complicates and even subverts these conventions in The Winter's Tale and The Tempest. Throughout, we will treat the plays as literary texts, performance prompts, and historical documents. Section attendance is required. This course is part of the College Course Cluster, The Renaissance. (LC)\n\nENGL 20001 Theories of Gender and Sexuality (Lauren Berlant; Kristen Schlit) | Autumn\n\nThis is a new one-quarter, seminar-style introductory course for undergraduates. Its aim is triple: to engage scenes and concepts central to the interdisciplinary study of gender and sexuality; to provide familiarity with key theoretical anchors for that study; and to provide skills for deriving the theoretical bases of any kind of method. Students will produce descriptive, argumentative, and experimental engagements with theory and its scenes as the quarter progresses. Prior course experience in gender/sexuality studies (by way of the general education civilization studies courses or other course work) is strongly advised. (LT)\n\nENGL 20050 Narrating Diasporas (Sophia Azeb) | Autumn\n\nThis course explores how Black writers in the twentieth century variously crafted and defined the African Diaspora while actively navigating this diaspora. Alongside scholarly works in African diaspora theory, readings will include essays and novels by Black writers from the Americas, Europe, and Africa. (LT)\n\nENGL 20152 London Program: London’s Water Stories: Representations of the Thames in Literature, Art and Film (Josephine McDonagh) | Autumn\n\nThis course will consider representations of urban experience in 19th, 20th and 21st-century London through focusing on the river. As one of the main points of entry to Britain for people and goods throughout the 19th and much of the 20th century, the river and especially the London docks, loom large in many of the mythologies of London as an imperial center, a destination for immigrants, and, with the redevelopment of Canary Wharf in the 1980s, a center of global finance. We will think about the licit and illicit traffic of the river, the various cultures and counter cultures that have emerged along it, and the ways in which it figures in literary and other texts. Students will travel on the river, visit relevant museums and exhibitions, including the Docklands Museum and the Tates, and they may have a guided walking tour on the Isle of Sheppey. Texts may include works by Dickens, Oscar Wilde, Woolf, Conrad, and James Berry, and films by Derek Jarman and John Mackenzie. (LC)\n\nENGL 20153 London Program: Postcolonial England: Migration, Race, Nation (Sonali Thakkar) | Autumn\n\nThis course will examine how ideas of English identity and nationhood have been transformed by postwar migration and diaspora, as well as by political and cultural contestations over race, racial representation, and the legacies of the British Empire. We will ask how the decline and overthrow of Britain’s influence and rule in the colonies after WWII gave rise to not just postcolonial nation-states overseas, but also to a postcolonial England. Our focus will be on the discourses and cultural production of migrant and diasporic communities. But we will also consider the historical context in which our authors and artists worked, and the various forms of imperial amnesia and nostalgia, as well as nativist and xenophobic political currents, against which they struggled. We will examine literary texts, cultural criticism, and film, music and visual culture from the early postwar period (Windrush Generation and the Suez Crisis) up to the present. Authors we might study include Sam Selvon, Kazuo Ishiguro, Salman Rushdie, Bhanu Kapil, and Kamila Shamsie, with films by Isaac Julien and Hanif Kureishi. We will also make use of London’s historical and cultural offerings, with a possible trip to the Black Cultural Archives, among other outings. (LG - Fiction)\n\nENGL 20154 London Program: The Country and the City (James Chandler) | Autumn\n\nFollowing loosely in the track of Raymond Williams’s 1973 book of the same title, this course will consider the interplay of urban and rustic life in literary productions of the early British Industrial Revolution. Writers we read will include William Blake, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Jane Austen, and possibly Charles Dickens. We will take advantage of the major exhibition of William Blake that will be on offer at London’s spectacular Tate Britain gallery (the first there in two decades), and we will probably make an excursion to Chawton, about 40 miles outside of London, to see Jane Austen’s village, including the 16th-century country house where her brother Edward presided (LC).\n\nENGL 20155 London Program: Surveilling London: Sexuality, Race, and Power (Madison Chapman) | Autumn\n\nThis course investigates the experience of watching and being watched in London while giving students the opportunity to pursue a quarter-long individual research project. Through texts ranging in genre, medium and period, we will explore explicit and implicit surveillance in London: the formal modes of observing and regulating people in public (government CCTV, private security technology), and informal instances of overseeing and overhearing. How has London's literature, history, and culture registered its status as a site of particularly intense surveillance? We begin the quarter with theoretical (Lauren Berlant, Michael Warner, Jeremy Bentham) and imaginative texts (Daniel Defoe, Oscar Wilde) alongside film and television (Francis Ford Coppola, Bodyguard) which illuminate the key paradox of how surveillance blatantly regulates public identities while, paradoxically, encouraging voyeurism of bodies labeled other or perverse. Fieldtrips to related historical and cultural sites will contextualize student research aims as we shift to independent projects in the second half of the course. Students will pursue archival and fieldwork opportunities in London with freedom to select topics under the umbrella of surveillance. Through rigorous engagement with course texts and individual research, students will strengthen textual analysis skills, become better acquainted with the city, and develop a reflexive relationship to their embodied and intellectual journeys through London. (LT)\n\nENGL 20560 The Rise of Prose: Composition, Criticism, and Constitutions (Frances Ferguson) | Autumn\n\nThis course will focus on writings of the late 18th century and early 19th century that aimed to prepare lawyers, doctors, and ministers to convey information and opinion to others. We’ll look at writings by Adam Smith, Hugh Blair, and Joseph Priestley to consider the challenges of persuading people in writing (instead of in public speeches and sermons) ; and we’ll conclude by considering Jeremy Bentham’s discussions of the principles that someone should take into account in preparing a constitution that would bear a meaningful relation to people’s future behavior. (LC, LT, LG - Nonfiction)\n\nENGL 21221 Realism, or Illusions of the Real (Amanda Shubert) | Autumn\n\nHow do texts create illusions of reality, and what kinds of techniques are involved in making something feel real to the reader? What kinds of reality does realism show? We will explore answers to these questions through readings of a range of literary works from the nineteenth- and twentieth-century realist tradition, from Jane Austen’s Emma and Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth’s Lyrical Ballads to Virginia Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway, as well as through analysis of photography and early film. Our assumption will be that the literary texts and visual media we look at contain within them theories of realism and representation for us to uncover. The written assignments for this course will ask you todevelop some of the analytic skills used by literary scholars, namely: close textual analysis of a literary text; arguing an interpretation; and summarizing and evaluating works of literary criticism and theory. (LC)\n\nENGL 22903 Literature and Architecture: Between Utopia and Dystopia, Design and Occupation (Jennifer Scappettone) | Autumn\n\nThis seminar to be taught in conjunction with the 2019 Chicago Architecture Biennial will allow students to explore the material repercussions of built, neglected, and mythologized environments on those who imagine and inhabit them, and to consider the way the literary arts not only respond to, but contribute to their shape. We will place the literature of the metropolis into dialogue with the writings and plans of architects and urbanists on the one hand, occupant-activists on the other. We will study the creation (and sporadic dismantling) of the city from the perspective of its builders and inhabitants—moving from the nineteenth-century flaneur through Situationism, to the utopian schemes and conceptual architectures of the ‘60s and 70s, and contemporary protest movements. A range of cities, visible and invisible, will be under consideration, with Chicago as our immediate case study. In lieu of a standard research paper, students will be given the opportunity to produce a collaborative atlas of Chicago. They must make time for field trips to the Biennial and to select monuments around the city. This is a featured Makers Seminar for English majors, but is open to all students. (LT, LC)\n\nENGL 23123 Cybernetics and Trans Identities (Alexander Wolfson) | Autumn\n\nThis course is an examination into the ways in which theorizations of trans identity have been bound to discourses concerning cyborgs and cybernetics. On one hand, we will look into the ways in which medico-technological discourses have inscribed and produced the limits for conceptualizing trans-ness. On the other, we will examine how trans self-narratives have mobilized cybernetic language to parasitically produce autonomous discourses. The over-arching questions of this class will be: how should we engage concepts, such as the cybernetic and the prosthetic, that have been used towards the disenfranchisement of trans identities, while simultaneously have been re-inscribed as emancipatory concepts? How should we tell the histories of these discourses? How do they affect, produce, contain, and enliven contemporary worlds of trans identities and existences? This course will, from its onset, be interdisciplinary in nature, both in terms of the academic disciplines from which we choose our texts (trans theory, queer theory, critical race theory, psychoanalysis, philosophy, new media theory, literary criticism, etc.) and also through an engagement with various genres and media, engaging fiction, film and visual art, as ways to further expand and develop our critical investigations. Readings will include works by figures such as Karen Barad, Jean Baudrillard, Mel Chen, Gilles Deleuze, Donna Haraway, Beatriz Preciado, Jasbir Puar, Gayle Salamon, Sandy Stone, Alexander Weheliye (LT).\n\nENGL 24002 Joyce’s Ulysses: An Introduction (Maud Ellmann) | Autumn\n\nThis course consists of a chapter-by-chapter introduction to Ulysses. We will focus on such themes as the city, aesthetics, politics, sex, food, religion, and the family, while paying close attention to Joyce’s use of multiple narrators and styles. Students are strongly encouraged to read Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and Homer’s Odyssey as preparation for this course. Assignments will consist of bi-weekly quizzes, collaborative class presentations, regular contributions to the class blog, and 2-3 papers. (Fiction, 1830-1940)\n\nENGL 24408 Before and After Beckett: Theater and Theory (Loren Kruger) | Autumn\n\nBeckett is conventionally typed as the playwright of minimalist scenes of unremitting bleaksness but his experiments with theatre and film echo the irreverent play of popular culture (vaudeville on stage and screen eg Chaplin and Keaton) as well as experimental Theatre and modern philosophy, even when there are no direct lines of influence. This course will juxtapose these points of reference with Beckett’s plays and those of his contemporaries (Ionesco, Genet and others in French, Pinter in English. It will then explore more recent plays that suggest the influence of Beckett by Caryl Churchill and Sarah Kane in English, Michel Vinaver in French, as well as the relevance of theorists and philosophers include Barthes, Wittgenstein, and critics writing on specific plays. (LT)\n\nENGL 25601 Nineteenth Century American Gothic William Veeder | Autumn\n\nThis course will trace the “Gothic” tradition in America from its initial manifestations in Brown and Irving through its first great flowering in the “American Renaissance” era of Poe, Hawthorne, and Melville, and on to the end of the century with James and Gilman. We will emphasize questions of methodology as well as practicing close analysis and defining a literary tradition. (LC)\n\nENGL 25805 Popol Vuh, Epic of the Americas (Edgar Garcia) | Autumn\n\nAs one of the oldest and grandest stories of world creation in the indigenous Americas, the Mayan Popol Vuh has been called “the Bible of America.” It tells a story of cosmological origins and continued historical transformations, spanning mythic, classic, colonial, and contemporary times. In this class, we will read this work fully and closely (in multiple translations, with some account of its original K’iche’ Mayan language as well), attending to the important way in which its structure relates myth and history, or foundations and change. In this light, we will examine its mirroring in Genesis, The Odyssey, Beowulf, Ovid’s Metamorphoses, and the Diné Bahane’ to consider how and why epics struggle with a simultaneity of origins and historiography. In highlighting this point of tension between cosmos and politics, we will examine adaptations of the Popol Vuh in contemporary political contexts by Miguel Ángel Asturias, Ernesto Cardenal, Diego Rivera, Dennis Tedlock and Andrés Xiloj Peruch, Humberto Ak’ab’al, Xpetra Ernandex, Ambar Past, Patricia Amlin, Gregory Nava, Arturo Arias, and Werner Herzog. As we cast the Guatemalan-born Popul Vuh as a contemporary work of hemispheric American literature (with extensive North American, Latin American, Latinx, and Indigenous literary engagement), we will take into account the intellectual contribution of Central America and the diaspora of Central Americans in the United States today. As a capstone to our class, we will visit the original manuscript of the Popol Vuh held at the Newberry Library in Chicago, thinking carefully about how this Mayan story of world creation implicates us to this day. (LC)\n\nENGL 25999 Secret Histories, Inside Jobs: Paranoia and Conspiracy in American Literature (Nell Pach) | Autumn\n\n“Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean they’re not after you,” runs the famous line – repeated everywhere from bumper stickers to Nirvana lyrics – from Joseph Heller’s Catch-22, the story, in Heller’s words, of a “sane man in an insane world.” American fascination with conspiracies – real and imagined – runs through the country’s history from eighteenth-century Illuminati paranoia to today’s truthers and birthers, and finds plenty to satisfy it in fiction, film, television, and even sensationalist news coverage. Conspiracy theories and their defenders frequently invoke American ideals of democracy, justice, and free thought but also often reflect the nation’s ugliest legacies of nativism, racism, and cynical self-interest.The texts we will examine in this course entertain, to differing degrees, the possibility that American historical events and sociopolitical power dynamics are the products of unseen and unknown forces, sinister machinations, carefully arranged nets that are pulled tight at the right moment. Examining a range of fiction from around 1800 to the present, we will explore conspiracy narratives from Nathaniel Hawthorne to Thomas Pynchon. Why does the notion of one’s own manipulation in the hands of shadowy puppet-masters hold such enduring appeal and sway in the American imagination? (LC)\n\nENGL 29101 Archive [Yellow] Fever (Sarah Johnson) | Autumn\n\nThis course examines slavery in the 18th and 19th-century Caribbean through the lens of maladies within and of the archive. The course also provides an introduction in methods of working in historical and contemporary archives. We will read fictional, archival, methodological and theoretical texts to examine fears of contagion and disease on the Middle Passage and plantations of the Caribbean, as well as scholarship on the difficulty of working in archives, especially those of slavery. The class will make two trips to special collections, one to view archival texts from the period and another to find an archival object of the student’s choosing (relevant to their own research interests) that will provide the topic of their final paper. Texts in this course include the work of Saidiya Hartman, Marisa Fuentes, Jacques Derrida, Carolyn Steedman, Christina Sharpe, Simone Browne, Michel Foucault; Richard Ligon, Mary Seacole, Thomas Thistlewood, William Earle. This course is offered as part of the Migrations Research Sequence. This is a research and criticism seminar intended for third- and fourth-year English majors. (LC, LT)\n\nENGL 29103 Representations of Islam in Early Modern England (Noémie Ndiaye) | Autumn\n\nThis seminar explores the representation of Islam and Islamic cultures in early modern English literature, from the 1580s to the 1650s with a primary but not exclusive focus on drama. What enduring fantasies about the Islamic world does early modern English literature express? How do religion, race, gender, and sexuality intersect in the formation of those fantasies? How do specific English social, political, and cultural issues inform literary representations of Islam? Ultimately, what do texts about Islam tell us about early modern England? This is a research and criticism seminar intended for third- and fourth-year English majors. (LC)\n\nENGL 25008/35008Changing Worlds: J.G. Ballard’s Apocalyptic Quartet (Andrei Pop) | Autumn\n\nBetween 1961 and 1966, the English novelist and short story writer J.G. Ballard produced four novels (The Wind from Nowhere, The Drowned World, The Burning World, and The Crystal World) that depict, poetically and concretely, global changes to the earth and its human inhabitants, in particular their imaginations. The relation of these lyrical apocalypses to science fiction, visual art, ecology and the philosophy of time, as well as their awkward coordination into a cycle, will concern us. We will conclude the course by reading Anna Kavan’s 1967 Ice, which in a way compliments and completes Ballard’s cycle.\n\nENGL 21360/41360 Gender, Capital, and Desire: Jane Austen and Critical Interpretation (Tristan Schweiger) | Autumn\n\nToday, Jane Austen is one of the most famous (perhaps the most famous), most widely read, and most beloved of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British novelists. In the two hundred years since her authorial career, her novels have spawned countless imitations, homages, parodies, films, and miniseries – not to mention a thriving “Janeite” fan culture. For just as long, her novels have been the objects of sustained attention by literary critics, theorists, and historians. This course will offer an in-depth examination of Austen, her literary corpus, and her cultural reception as well as a graduate-level introduction to several important schools of critical and theoretical methodology. We will read all six of Austen’s completed novels in addition to criticism spanning feminism, historicism, Marxism, queer studies, postcolonialism, and psychoanalysis. Readings may include Shoshana Felman, Frances Ferguson, William Galperin, Deidre Lynch, D.A. Miller, Edward Said, Eve Sedgwick, and Raymond Williams. (LC, LT)\n\nENGL 10403 Genre Fundamentals: Poetry: Rhythm and Myth (Edgar Garcia) | Winter\n\nThis course is an introduction to poetry that is focused on two core elements of poetry: rhythm and myth. We will consider how rhythm is an experience of time that the patterned language of poetry produces. And myth here refers to the persistent present of the poem, which wishes to be the event that it describes, rather than just a representation of it. With these elements in tension, a poem is a complex temporal system, simultaneously pulsing with the changing rhythms of everyday life and timeless—dynamic and resonant across histories, languages, and cultures. In this class we will read poetry from a variety of genres as well as cultures and languages (ancient and modern, western and non-western, oral and written) to better understand this lasting poetic tension. Along the way, we will take into account key theorists on poetic form and the function and meaning of myth. (LG - Poetry)\n\nENGL 13512 The Future (Bill Brown) | Winter\n\nThis course focuses on the future as imagined by American science fiction of the 20th century. On the one hand, we will pay attention to the scientific, political, and cultural contexts from which particular visions of the future emerged; on the other, we will work to develop an overarching sense of science fiction as a genre. We will deploy different analytical paradigms (Formalist, Marxist, Feminist, &c.) to apprehend the stakes and the strategies for imagining future worlds. After some initial attention to the magazine and pulp culture that helped to establish the genre, we will spotlight major SF movements (Afro Futurism, Cyberpunk, Biopunk, etc.) and major authors (including Robert Heinlein, Philip K. Dick, Ursula K. Le Guin, Samuel R. Delaney, William Gibson, and Octavia Butler). Finally, we will use this 20th-century history to think about 21st-century SF work in different media (e.g., film, radio, graphic narrative). (LT, LG - Fiction)\n\nENGL 15620 Imagining Pagans in the Middle Ages (Julie Orlemanski; Joe Stadolnik) | Winter\n\nThis undergraduate course investigates what became of classical paganism during the Christian Middle Ages. How did medieval writers portray Greek and Roman practices of worship and its pantheon of gods? For medieval literate culture, classical myths were both an index of historical difference – 'we no longer believe what they believed' – and an ongoing source of poetic, narrative, and symbolic potency. Through the close-reading of a variety of source texts, the course examines what classical myths and pagan belief means to late-medieval poets and thinkers. In particular, we’ll look to how ‘imagining pagans’ incited the medieval historical imagination; inspired cosmological or proto-scientific thought experiments; disrupted orthodox theology; and finally, worked to establish fiction as a domain of literature. The poetry of Geoffrey Chaucer will be at the heart of the class, but we will also read widely across medieval culture. No previous experience with Middle English is necessary. (LC)\n\nENGL 16013 The Arts of Detection (Javier Ibanez) | Winter | (Note: this course is replacing \"Genealogies of the Early Novel\")\n\nBlithely disregarding the distinction between high and low culture, at once nostalgic and iconoclastic with respect to the legacies of Enlightenment rationality, detective fiction is also uniquely self-reflexive in the explicit thematization of its formal concerns with the principles of narrative construction, the mechanics of semiosis and interpretation, and the logic of emplotment. In this course, we will trace the history of the genre, from its beginnings in the nineteenth century to its more recent incarnations, and think about how it stages questions concerning such issues as the cultural and institutional practices of discipline and surveillance; the epistemologies of secrecy and disclosure; the aesthetics of the detail, the mystery, and the puzzle; the relationship between inquiry and desire; the overdetermined legibility of urban spaces; and the porous boundaries between self and other. Our primary texts will include works by Edgar Allan Poe, Wilkie Collins, Arthur Conan Doyle, G. K. Chesterton, Dashiell Hammett, Jorge Luis Borges, Patricia Highsmith, and Agatha Christie, among others, as well as examples from television and film. In addition, we will also consider the sustained interest detective fiction has generated within a number of different theoretical traditions. (LC, LG - Fiction, LT)\n\nENGL 16500 Shakespeare I: Histories and Comedies (Richard Strier) | Winter\n\nAn exploration of some of Shakespeare's major plays from the first half of his professional career when the genres in which he primarily worked were comedies and (English) histories. Plays to be studied include The Comedy of Errors, The Taming of the Shrew, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Twelfth Night, Richard III, Richard II, Henry IV Parts 1 and 2, and Henry V. A shorter and a longer paper will be required. (LC)\n\nENGL 17440 August and After: Contemporary Black Drama and Performance (Tina Post) | Winter\n\nThe American stage has seen an explosion of black playwrights since the 1990s. From the verbatim theater of Anna Deavere Smith to the cagey narrators of Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, these playwrights have reimagined and reworked American drama’s conventions of form and mood. Performers like Ralph Lemon and Jennifer Kidwell are devising work at theater's intersection with dance, media, and visual art, and playwright Adrienne Kennedy has returned after a decade-long hiatus. This course surveys the landscape of contemporary back theater-makers and performance artists (and includes, where relevant, the historical predecessors they explicitly invoke or work against). What forces animate works of contemporary black theater and performance? What tropes or conventions do they jettison, and which do they keep? Is there enough uniting these works that an underlying coherence prevails, or does studying them alongside one another instead reveal the dissolution of a racial center?\n\nENGL 19880 Inhabiting the Borderlands: Latinx Embodiment in Literature, Art, and Popular Culture (Carmen Merport) | Winter\n\nHow does a Latinx cultural identity become legible? What are the conditions of its recognition? What kinds of embodied practices and performances serve to point to the particular intersections of race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, and gender that can be termed “Latinx”? To approach these questions, this course will explore critical texts by Diana Taylor, Gloria Anzaldúa, Julia Alvarez, Coco Fusco, José Esteban Muñoz, and Tomás Ybarra-Frausto, among others, as well as performances, artwork, and literature by La Lupe, Walter Mercado, Yalitza Aparicio, Cherríe Moraga, Judith Baca, Carmen Maria Machado, and more. (LT)\n\nENGL 21926 People, Places, Things: Victorian Novel Survey (Elaine Hadley) | Winter\n\nQuarter Systems and the Victorian novel do not mix well, which is only to say that this course cannot aspire to a comprehensive accounting of the Victorian novel, or the myriad forms of the novel that emerged during Victoria’s reign (1837-1901). What it does seek to do, however, is give you some little sense of the Victorian novel’s formal and thematic range in a few of the uncharacteristically shorter novels of the period, and—in the bargain—give you a few critical tools and concepts to better figure out what these novels are and what they might be doing. Critical approaches to the Victorian novel are as varied as the novels themselves, perhaps, but I’ve tried to give you access to some of the more recent interventions that centrally query character and characterization (people), things and the circulation of things, and location and spatialization (places). Jane Eyre, Hard Times, Lady Audley’s Secret, The Warden, Jude the Obscure, The Hound of the Baskervilles. (LC, LG - Fiction)\n\nENGL 23506 Diets and Other Body Horror: Modifying, Mortifying, and Masticating the Fictional Flesh (Nell Pach) | Winter\n\nPhysical bodies remain a cultural preoccupation – their maintenance is debated and obsessed over in every news cycle, food and diet bloggers meticulously photograph everything they put in their mouths, and body-modifying surgeries and “lifestyle” protocols constitute a multibillion-dollar industry. This course examines twentieth- and twenty-first-century literary responses to the persistent, problematic fantasy of remaking human bodies to bring them into alignment with standards of beauty, health – or something else entirely. Readings will take us from speculative fiction to dirty realism, Netflix shows to biopolitical and fat acceptance theory. Authors may include H.G. Wells, Virginia Woolf, Margaret Atwood, China Miéville, Mary Gordon, and Roxane Gay. What do these narratives make of the gore and violence beneath the peaceful façade of bodily care and feeding, from the banal to the alien? (LG - Fiction)\n\nENGL 26206 Race and Space (Adrienne Brown) | Winter\n\nThis course will look at the way that race is as much a product of space as it is of blood, skin, vision, or law. How does space determine the way we perceive race and how does race color the ways we experience and relate to space? Starting with post-antebellum rewritings of slavery’s spaces, moving through the hysteria surrounding passing and urbanization in the 1920’s, the role of the mid-century suburbs in reorganizing racial categories, the post-Civil Rights post-industrial city and the shoring up of the ghetto, to the current intersections between ideas of the post-racial and the post-spatial, this course will explore the novel as a key site for mediating the changing linked experience of race and space.\n\nENGL 26249 Literature and the Financial Crisis of 2008 (Kenneth Warren) | Winter\n\nIn this course we will look at 2008 stock market crash as an event within literary fiction among writers in the US, the UK, and South Asia.\n\nENGL 27500 Modernism and the Harlem Renaissance: Issues and Methods (Kenneth Warren) | Winter\n\nIn this course we will examine that period known as the Harlem Renaissance, partly as an exercise in literary criticism and theory, partly as an exercise in literary and intellectual history. Our objectives will be to critique the primary texts from this period and at the same time to assess the efforts of literary scholars to make sense of this moment in the history of American cultural production. (LT)\n\nENGL 29102 Mobile Life (Josephine McDonagh) | Winter\n\nThis is a new research-intensive course which aims to provide both theoretical frames and methods for research for exploring topics related to migration and literature in the contemporary world and in historical contexts. We will explore various aspects of the migratory experience; the ways in which literary texts shape or shed light on them; and how contemporary theories help us to understand migration and its literatures. Key terms will include migration, mobility, exile, refugees, settlement, kinship, border crossing, bureaucracy. We will ask questions such as: how do printed and other forms of information enable/regulate movement? What is an imaginative transportation? What happens when we cross a border? What is at stake in settlement? Who is a refugee? How do children function in the migratory imagination? In class we will focus mainly on anglophone texts from the nineteenth century onwards, including novels, short stories, poems and plays, journalism, propaganda, bureaucratic documents, maps, guides, and other kinds of texts. The assessment for the course will include an outline of a research project of your own devising, for which you will develop your own archive of sources. This course is offered as part of the Migrations Research Sequence. (LT)\n\nENGL 20228/30228 William Blake: Poet, Painter, and Prophet (W.J.T. Mitchell) | Winter\n\nWilliam Blake is arguably the most unusual figure in the history of English poetry and visual art. Recognized now as an essential part of the canon of Romantic poetry, he was almost completely unknown in his own time. His paintings, poems, and illuminated books were objects of fascination for a small group of admirers, but it was not until the late 19th century that his work began to be collected by William Butler Yeats, and not until the 1960s that he was recognized as a major figure in the history of art and literature. Dismissed as insane in his own time, his prophetic and visionary works are now seen as anticipating some of the most radical strands of modern thought, including Freud, Marx, and Nietzsche. We will study Blake’s work from a variety of perspectives, placing his poetry in relation to the prophetic ambitions of Milton and his visual images in the European iconographic tradition of Michelangelo and Durer, Goya and Fuseli. The course will emphasize close readings of his lyric poems, and attempt to open up the mythic cosmology of his allegorical, epic, and prophetic books. (LC)\n\nENGL 26708/34620 Modernist Poetry: Yeats, Eliot, Pound (Maud Ellmann) | Winter\n\nWe will study selected works by Yeats, Eliot, Pound, H.D., Auden, Stevens, Williams, Loy, and others. Some 19th C authors, such as Browning, Tennyson, and Whitman, will also be addressed. (LG - Poetry)\n\nENGL 26312/36312 Global Speculative Fiction (Hoda El Shakry) | Winter\n\nThis course examines literary and cinematic works of speculative fiction in a comparative context. An expansive genre that encompasses science fiction, fantasy, magic realism, horror, as well as utopian and dystopian literature, speculative fiction envisions alternate, parallel, possible, or imagined worlds. These worlds often exhibit characteristics such as: scientific and technological advancements; profound social, environmental, or political transformations; time or space travel; life on other planets; artificial intelligence; and evolved, hybrid, or new species. The course reflects on how these texts and films reimagine the past and the present in order to offer radical visions of desirable or undesirable futures. To that end, we will consider how this genre interrogates existential questions about what it means to be human, the nature of consciousness, the relationship between mind/body, thinking/being, and self/other, as well as planetary concerns confronting our species. Literary and cinematic works will be paired with theoretical readings that critically frame speculative and science fiction in relation to questions of gender, race, class, colonialism, bio-politics, human rights, as well as environmental and social justice. In addition to exploring speculative fiction as a way of reading and interpreting the universe, we will examine its generic and aesthetic qualities across a variety of subgenres (Afrofuturism, cyberpunk, steampunk, climate fiction). (LT)\n\nSPRING ENGL 10709 Genre Fundamentals: Fiction (Sianne Ngai) | Spring\n\nWhat are basics of complex storytelling? What are its conventions and deviations? This course explores fiction by focusing on specific narrative strategies and how they change over time. Authors will most likely include Herman Melville, Henry James, Edith Wharton, William Faulkner, Toni Morrison, and Ali Smith, among others. (LG - Fiction)\n\nENGL 12004 Manifesto! Art, Politics, Utopia (Tim DeMay) | Spring\n\nThe manifesto exploded in the 20th Century, spanning aesthetic and political spectrums in order to consolidate groups, challenge dominant structures, and otherwise make claims for how the future should look. This course will examine the genre of the manifesto from Marx to cyborgs by looking at its use by writers, thinkers, and activists, asking about representation (both in how artists represent subjects, and how speakers represent their constituents), identity, the avant-garde, modernity/modernism, and the implied suggestions of utopian worlds. By examining such a specifically action-oriented genre, we will explore just what connection, if any, art and literature have to the political, real, everyday, whatever-we-call-it, shared world and our abilities to craft its future. (LT)\n\nENGL 13002 A Still Life: Feminists and Objects in Modernity (Katherine Nolan) | Spring\n\nModernity has always been fascinated by the fantasy of objects coming to life. Feminist theory, by contrast, has often been fixated on the reverse: “objectification,” or the process of human beings becoming like objects. This course puts into conversation these two different ways of imagining animate object-ness in order to assemble a critical archive on one of modernity’s foundational binaries: the “subject-object” dichotomy. We will examine a series of genres that prominently feature objects, including it-narratives, narratives about robotic women, and video games, while consider these texts in relation to prominent feminist writings about objectification. (LT, LC)\n\nENGL 14001 Anglophone Immigrant Literature: Narratives of Displacement, Deprivation, and Consumption (Upasana Dutta) | Spring\n\nIn anglophone immigrant literary narratives, there is a place of particular poignancy and longing reserved for meditations upon food. What is the role, the space, and the import of food in immigrant lives? What diminution accompanies the loss of your own food, and what desire attaches to the rediscovery, or the replication of it in a foreign land? What are the stakes involved in charting out a dominion of your own familiar flavors or adapting to a new palate in an unfamiliar milieu? This course charts a few of these concerns and uses food writing as a point of entry into modes of being and making in immigrant literature, considering that emigration is a displacement that is sometimes impelled and accompanied by trauma, and characterized by rapid modes of adaptation to an unfamiliar and frequently hostile environment. Readings are likely to include fiction and poetry by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Amy Tan, Imtiaz Dharker, Amarjit Chandan, Monique Truong, and Cristina Henríquez. These primary texts will be supplemented by critical and analytical readings about patterns of displacement and consumption in immigrant lives and literature. (LT)\n\nENGL 15001 Secrets and Spies: Espionage Fiction in the 20th Century (Jennifer Pan) | Spring\n\nFollowing a few decades of low interest after the end of the Cold War, spy fiction experienced a resurgence after 9/11 with popular shows like Homeland, The Americans, and Archer. It would seem that we find espionage most interesting in times when we can envision a concrete enemy. This course will explore how tensions between the ethos and the practice of espionage produce changing and often contradictory views of nationhood. Who is included or excluded in national identity is inextricably bound to sites of difference like race, gender, class, sexuality, ability, and religion. How does espionage, which is premised both on closeness to the enemy and immaculate patriotism, show up in the way the nation constructs itself and its others? Spies and spying offer unique lenses through which to examine how nations grapple with the project of distinguishing the us from the them. We will begin with the Dreyfus Affair in 1894, and then move on to Rudyard Kipling’s Kim (1901), W. Somerset Maugham’s Ashenden: Or the British Agent (1928), Helen MacInnes’s While Still We Live (1944), Odell Bennett Lee’s The Formative Years of an African-American Spy: A Memoir (2012), as well as movies The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965), The Lives of Others (2006), and Casino Royale (2006). (LT, LG - Fiction)\n\nENGL 15320 Witnessing Medieval Evil: Literature, Art, and the Politics of Observation (Benjamin Saltzman) | Spring\n\nSeeing hell for oneself, watching the torture of a saint, looking at illustrations of violence: these profoundly terrible experiences, narrated and drawn, shaped the way medieval readers took in the world around them, its violence, its suffering, its preponderance of evils. But how exactly does literature allow readers to witness and process such horrors? How is the observation of violence transformed by art? What is unique about the medieval experience of these artistic and literary forms of mediation? What can they teach us about our own contemporary cultural encounters with the sights and stories of atrocity? By exploring questions like these, this course will consider the didactic, religious, and epistemological functions of witnessing in a variety of early medieval texts such as illustrated copies of Prudentius’s Psychomachia (in which the Virtues engage in a gruesome battle against the Vices), the Apocalypse of Paul (in which Paul sees hell and lives to tell about it), early medieval law codes, the Life of St. Margaret, the Old English Genesis, and the heroic poem Judith. These medieval texts will be read alongside thinkers like Giorgio Agamben, W.J.T. Mitchell, and Susan Sontag, whose work on images of atrocity in the modern world will both inform our critical examination of the Middle Ages while opening up the possibility for rethinking literature and art in relation to contemporary experiences of violence. (LC, LT)\n\nENGL 16003 Ventriloquism in Literature and Culture (Marissa Fenley) | Spring\n\nIn this class we will collectively identify the conventions that have come to define theatrical tradition known as ventriloquism. While this course will be rooted in the study of performance, we will also look at instances when ventriloquism appears in literature and film as a metaphor and as a trope. By looking at ventriloquism both in its technique and its thematics we will investigate the extent to which the ventriloquist and the dummy are sexed and racialized categories. Our texts will span from the recorded performances of famous ventriloquists such as Edgar Bergan and Charlie McCarthy, episodes of The Twilight Zone, horror films like Dead of Night and popular fiction. We will also consult several theoretical texts such as Freud on the uncanny and Winnicott on transitional objects. (LT)\n\n*ENGL 17002 Early Modern Love: Eros in British Literature 1500-1700 (Michal Zecharia) | Spring*\n\nThis course examines an age-old problem of erotic love: how can love be a chief component of the well-lived life, when at its most celebrated it departs from reason, even to the point of madness? We will consider the challenges that love presents to human knowledge and ethics through the lens of early modern English literature, where the theme of love was at the center of aesthetic creativity, but our discussion will also draw on the philosophy of love, the history of emotions, Christian theology, and psychology. With these resources at hand, we will explore the phenomenon of erotic love, the relation of Eros to self and identity, and the reasons for love, finally leading up to the question: what does it mean to love well? Readings will include poetry, drama, and prose by prominent sixteenth- and seventeenth-century authors such as Edmund Spenser, William Shakespeare, and John Milton, as well as less studied voices in the period, alongside theoretical works by thinkers throughout the ages, from Plato and Augustine to Harry Frankfurt and Lauren Berlant. Students will have an opportunity to approach the topic through analytic and creative assignments. (LC)\n\nENGL 18108 Culture and the Police (Chris Taylor) | Spring\n\nHow do cultural products facilitate, abet, and enable the form of social ordering that we call policing? This course will explore the policing function of what modernity calls “culture” by exploring the parallel histories of policing, the emergence of modern police theory, and the rise of the novel. We will focus in particular on how both literature and the police emerge to navigate a series of linked epistemological and political problematics: the relation between particularity and abstraction, the relation between deviance and normalcy, and indeed that of authority as such. While we will focus on texts from the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Atlantic world, students with a broader interest in policing are encouraged to enroll. Readings will include Daniel Defoe, Patrick Colquhoun, Henry Fielding, G.W.F. Hegel, Louis Althusser, Michel Foucault, Michael McKeon, Mary Poovey, and Mark Neocleous.This is a research and criticism seminar intended for third-year English majors. (LC, LT)\n\nENGL 19205 Poetry in the Land of Childhood (Alexis Chema) | Spring\n\nCupboards and attics, nests and shells, the inside of a bush, the bottom of a rowboat: this course applies Gaston Bachelard’s phenomenology of the poetic image as a way of compassing the intimate “fibred space” of childhood as it is constituted by Romantic poems. (LC, LG - Poetry)\n\nENGL 19890 Portrait of the Artist as ___: Twentieth-Century Authorship in Theory and Practice (Carmen Merport) | Spring\n\nClose your eyes and imagine an artist. What or who do you see? This course will explore the theories and representations of authorship and artistry that have shaped the way most of us imagine such figures. We will also discuss works of criticism, literature, and art that seek to counter or transform this tradition from a variety of angles and positionalities. Figures we will attend to include James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Frida Kahlo, Zora Neale Hurston, Vincent Van Gogh, and Andy Warhol. (LT)\n\nENGL 20046 Introduction to Caribbean Studies (Kaneesha Parsard) | Spring\n\nWhy have critics, writers, and artists described the Caribbean as “ground zero” of Western modernity? Beginning with the period before European settlement, we will study slavery and emancipation, Asian indentureship, labor and social movements, decolonization, debt and tourism, and today’s digital Caribbean. We will survey literary and visual cultures, primary source documents, and thought across the English, French, Spanish, and Dutch-speaking Caribbean. All readings will be available in translation. (LC, LT)\n\nENGL 20720 Film and Fiction (James Chandler) | Spring\n\nThis will be a wide-ranging course that addresses three distinct but related critical problems in the contemporary understanding of film and fiction. The most general is the question of how we might go about linking the practice of criticism in the literary arts with that of the screen arts. Where are the common issues of structure, form, narration, point of view management, and the like? Where, on the other hand, are the crucial differences that lie in the particularities of each domain—the problem that some have labeled “medium specificity” in the arts? The second problem has to do more specifically with questions of adaptation. Adaptation is a fact of our cultural experience that we encounter in many circumstances, but perhaps in non more insistently as when we witness the reproduction of a literary narrative in cinematic or televisual form? Adaptation theory has taught us to look beyond the narrow criterion of “fidelity” a far too limiting in scope? But when we look beyond, what do we look for, and what other concepts guide our exploration? The third and final problem has to do with the now rampant genre of the “film based on fact,” especially when the facts derive from a particular source text, as in the recent case of Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman? What has this genre become so popular? What are its particular genre markings (e.g., excessive stylization, the use of documentary footage of the actual persons and events involved)? What might its emergence have to do with the perceived crisis in the authority of reported facts in our time? There will screenings of adaptations and readings in the prose fiction on which they are based, both older (e.g., Austen, Shelley, and Dickens) and more recent (e.g., Ishuguro and Baldwin) as well as readings in both literary and film criticism. Possibilities for the films-based-on-fact that we might screen would include: American Hustle, Fruitvale Station, I Tanya, and BlacKkKlansman. Students enrolled in the course will be expected to complete a short written exercise at midterm (3-4 pp.) and a longer course paper (12pp.). (LT)\n\nENGL 25318 Literary Radicalism and the Global South: Perspectives from South Asia (Abhishek Bhattacharyya) | Spring\n\nWhat does it mean to speak of literary radicalism? What are the hallmarks of a radical literature? And how does any such body of radical literature relate to the crucial question of empire, while also seeking to not be limited by that address? This course will explore the theme of literary radicalism through perspectives arising from South Asia. Over the twentieth century the subcontinent has been shaped through a wide variety of social and political movements: from anticolonial struggles to communist organising, feminist struggles, dalit mobilisation, indigenous protest and more, with their histories intertwining in different ways. We will start with a consideration of some texts on literary radicalism from other parts of the global South by authors such as Julia de Burgos and Ngugi Wa Thiong’o, and then move to a detailed discussion of South Asian texts in subsequent weeks. This course will work with specific texts every week to examine particular aspects of literary style and history. We will study texts from a variety of subcontinental languages (in translation, unless originally in English), and across different forms – poetry, short fiction, children’s literature, novels, a memoir, a graphic novel and a documentary film on a poet. By grappling at length with specific geopolitical and literary contexts in South Asia, and serving as an introduction to them, this course seeks to move beyond reading them reductively simply in relation to empire/colonialism or the metropolitan reader, while simultaneously looking back at the global divisions of power from their perspectives. No prior training in South Asia or literature courses is a requirement. Students aren’t required to know any languages of the global South, but are very welcome to bring any such knowledge into their contributions to and submissions for the class.\n\nENGL 25405 The American Classics (Eric Slauter) | Spring\n\nThis course offers an introduction to six of the greatest works of American literature: Nathaniel Hawthorne’s Scarlet Letter (1850), Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick (1851), Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1852), Henry David Thoreau’s Walden (1854), Frederick Douglass’s My Bondage and My Freedom (1855), and Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass (1855). Lectures invite you to immerse yourselves in the environments in which they were written and to explore the crucial literary, intellectual, social, religious, economic, and political contexts that shaped the production and reception of these distinctly American contributions to world literature. (LC)\n\nENGL 26250 Richer and Poorer: Income Inequality (Elaine Hadley) | Spring\n\nCurrent political and recent academic debate has centered on income or wealth inequality. Data suggests a rapidly growing divergence between those earners at the bottom and those at the top. This course seeks to place that current concern in conversation with a range of moments in nineteenth and twentieth century history when literature and economics converged on questions of economic inequality. In keeping with recent political economic scholarship by Thomas Piketty, we will be adopting a long historic view and a somewhat wide geographic scale as we explore how economic inequality is represented, measured, assessed and addressed. Readings will include some of the following literature, Hard Times, Le Pere Goriot, The Jungle, The Time Machine, Native Son, Landscape for a Good Woman, White Tiger, and some of the following economic and political texts Principles of Political Economy, The Acquisitive Society, The Theory of the Leisure Class, Capital (Marx and Piketty), The Price of Inequality and Inequality Re-examined. (LT, LC)\n\nENGL 26900 Postwar U.S. Literature (Deborah L. Nelson) | Spring\n\nRanging across genres and media platforms, this survey course covers the major aesthetic innovations of the late 20th century in their historical context. Beginning with the end of World War II and ending at 9/11, each week will contain one major reading and several smaller ones as well as samplings of other arts (photography, film, performance art, etc.) relevant or analogous to the readings.\n\nENGL 27017 Passing (Nicolette Bruner) | Spring\n\nIn this course, we examine how people move within and between categories of identity, with particular attention to boundary crossings of race and gender in U.S. law and literature from the nineteenth century to the present. Law provides a venue and a language through which forces of authority police categories of identity that, at Jean Stefancic and Richard Delgado observe, “society invents, manipulates, or retires when convenient.” Readings will include theoretical texts as well as court rulings, cultural ephemera, and literary texts. (LT)\n\nENGL 27529 Intoxication and Dispossession in Colonialism (Matt Boulette) | Spring\n\nManhattan, according to one folk etymology, means “the place at which we were drunk.” Supposedly the Lenape (Delaware) people named the island after their “general intoxication,” in 1609, on wine and aqua vitae offered by the English explorer Henry Hudson. That derivation, though false, nonetheless puts drunkenness intriguingly close to the center of an originary colonial encounter. In this course, students will examine how such scenes were reiterated, transformed, and exploited throughout the 19th century. As we move along these historical itineraries, we will ask how toxic ideology distills and reinforces logics of racial dispossession. But we will also ask how intoxication opens onto altered states, draws out chronic conditions, and expands repertoires of conviviality. Our readings will weave between multiple genres in pursuit of these questions. Juxtaposing antiquarian files and execution sermons, medical inquiries and autobiographies, bureaucratic reports and romantic episodes, we will retrace scenes of intoxication through the texts, images, and institutions that configured them over time. (LC)\n\nENGL 27533 Fugitive Poetics: Slaves, Runaways, Exiles, and Nineteenth-Century American Poetry (Jake Fournier) | Spring\n\nThis course considers late-eighteenth- and nineteenth-century American poetry from the perspective of the disprized. One central point of discussion will be how slavery and indentured servitude—and the attendant urge for escape and freedom from these and other carceral institutions—shaped the American poetic imaginary. We will take up both the poetry and poetic theory written by fugitives and explore poetry itself as a form of fugitivity for the enslaved, politically exiled, or ideologically confined. Central figures in the traditional canon of nineteenth-century U.S. poetry—Poe, Whitman, and Dickinson—will be considered from this vantage alongside figures like Harriet Jacobs, Frances E. W. Harper, José María Heredia y Heredia, and José Martí, among others. In the process, we will explore the potential connections and collisions between these nineteenth-century literary texts and contemporary lyric and critical race theory. This course is as interested in the nineteenth-century construction of a national American poetics as it is in American poetry itself; equal weight will be given to poetry and prose. Topics will include the poetic imaginary in early American statecraft, prosody and the carceral condition (what Max Cavitch calls “Slavery and its Metrics”), blackface lyrics and class mobility, abolitionism, and inter-American literary exchange.(LC, LG - Poetry)\n\nENGL 28113 The American Novel in History and the Historical Novel (Adam Rowe) | Spring\n\nWe will read several American novels—some canonical, others largely forgotten—to explore the relationship between literature and history from the early Republic to the present. A novel such as Nathaniel Hawthorne's The House of the Seven Gables is a historical artifact, a rich and suggestive reflection of the world in which it was written, and a profound meditation on history itself, on the narratives by which a culture acknowledges and denies its inheritance from the past. Indeed, many novelists have explored dimensions of our collective past that historians, tethered to the surface of recorded fact, cannot reach and should not ignore. From the creation of the American republic to the unraveling of the American working class, from the experience of slavery to the experience of industrialized warfare, we will examine some of the most significant issues in American history through the art of some of the nation's most gifted novelists. (LC, LG - Fiction)\n\nENGL 28651 Epic Cosmologies (John Wilkinson) | Spring\n\nCosmological epic poetry – how things are, and how they have come to be – challenges the human scale of lyric. In its origin story this course tracks recent English-language cosmological epics through Charles Olson as far back as the pre-Socratics and Gilgamesh, with stopping-off points including Milton, Blake and Shelley, while also encountering Victorian cosmic terror. (LC, LT, LG - Poetry)\n\nENGL 20806 / 30806 British Drama, 1660-1830 (Timothy Campbell) | Spring\n\nThis survey of British drama during the long eighteenth century ranges from Restoration sexual comedy and civic drama of political virtue and self-sacrifice to popular spectacles of criminal justice and early Gothic theater of passionate hatred. Alongside the plays, we will consider theatrical history (including Shakespearean legacies and significant actors of the period like David Garrick, Mary Robinson, and Sarah Siddons) together with criticism and theory, past and present. (LC)\n\nENGL 29120/39120 Renaissance Christian Epic: Tasso, Vida, Milton (Joshua Scodel) | Spring\n\nThis course will focus upon the two most important Renaissance Christian epics, Torquato Tasso’s La Gerusalemme liberata/Jerusalem Delivered (first pub. 1581) and John Milton’s Paradise Lost (first pub. 1667), and two brief Biblical epics, Marco Girolamo Vida’s Christiad (1535) and Milton’s Paradise Regained (1671). We will examine these four Renaissance epics as ambitious efforts to revive an ancient and pagan form in order to depict Christian and self-consciously modern visions. We will consider how Renaissance epic poets imitate and emulate both their classical models (primarily Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey, Virgil’s Aeneid, and Ovid’s Metamorphoses) and Judeo-Christian sources (primarily the Bible); seek to forge an elevated and appropriate language for epic in Latin, Italian, and English; espouse new visions of the human, the heroic, and gender relations; and adumbrate distinctively modern national, imperial, and global ambitions. All non-English texts will be read in translation, but students who can read Latin or Italian will be encouraged to read the originals.

Nooter) | Autumn\n\n(=SIGN 26055, TAPS 17019) This course will travel through the great dramas of ancient Greece, including works of Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and Aristophanes. Moreover, it will show how the history of contemporary thought has been shaped by reflection on Greek tragedy, starting from the philosophy of Hegel and Nietzsche, the psychoanalysis of Freud and Lacan, the feminist critiques of Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva and Judith Butler, works of structuralism and poststructuralism, and finally the recent material and affective turns in scholarship. Along the way, we will draw insights on modern movements of the performance arts from adaptations, including those in dance (Martha Graham), in film (Pier Paolo Pasolini, Lars von Trier), and in drama itself (Anne Carson). As this course will demonstrate, there is hardly an intellectual or artistic movement of recent history that has not taken its cue from Greek drama. All reading will be in English. (LC, LT)\n\nCLCV 24319. The Idea of Freedom in Antiquity. (A. Horne) | Autumn\n\n(=CLAS 34319, LLSO 24319, HIST 2/30507) Freedom may be the greatest of American values. But it also has a long history, a dizzying variety of meanings, and a huge literature. This course will be an introduction to critical thinking on freedom (primarily political freedom) with an emphasis on Greco-Roman texts. The first half of the class will focus on Greek authors, including Herodotus, Euripides, and Aristotle. The second half will focus on Roman authors, from Cicero to Livy to Tacitus. The ancient texts will be supplemented by modern literature on freedom, such as John Stuart Mill and Isaiah Berlin. (LC, LT)\n\nCLCV 24519. Dreams in the Ancient World. (S. Torallas. A. Maravela) | Autumn\n\n(=CLAS 34519, NEHC 20613/30613, ANCM 44519, RLST 24503). Dreams belong to the universals of human existence as human beings have always dreamt and will continue to dream across time and cultures. The questions where do dreams come from and how to unravel a dream have always preoccupied the human mind. In this course we will focus on dreams in the Greco-Roman and Greco-Egyptian cultural environments. We will cover dreams from three complementary perspectives: dreams as experience, dream interpretation and dream theory. The reading materials will include: (a) a selection of dream narratives from different sources, literary texts as well as documentary accounts of dreams; (b) texts which document the forms and contexts of dream interpretation in the Greco-Roman and Greco-Egyptian cultures and (c) texts which represent attempts to approach dreams from a more general perspective by among others explaining their genesis and defining dream-types. (LC, LT)\n\nCLCV 22519. The Life and Afterlife of Cleopatra (J. Johansen) | Winter\n\n(=GNSE 23124) Cleopatra is one of the most notorious women in history. The quintessential femme fatale, she has permeated Western cultural imagination for more than 2,000 years. Born of a bastard king, she rose to power in one of the most turbulent times in human history – Rome was waging bloody civil war, the empires of Alexander the Great’s legacy were falling, and Egypt was in revolt and uprising. Her story is one of political intrigue, sex, power, murder, war, and suicide. But her story was never her story alone. Once the asp took its fatal bite, Cleopatra’s story was coopted by her enemies and her legacy was built at the intersections of gender, sexuality, and race over the last two millennia. This course has two main objectives: 1. to strip back the Western, male gaze of Cleopatra’s legacy and evaluate Cleopatra’s reign within its own context; and 2. to interrogate Cleopatra’s constructed identities and the role they have played and still play in society. In this course, students will take a critical look at the life and legacy of Cleopatra VII, queen of Egypt, through a wide-array of primary source materials and a selection of her vast reception, including Roman, Arabic, and Renaissance literature; Shakespeare; Afrocentric art, literature, and pop culture; film; comedy; advertising; and popular music. (LC)\n\nCLCV 23608. Aristophanes’ Athens (J. Hall) | Winter\n\n(=CLAS 33608, ANCM 33900, =HIST 30803, HIST 20803) The comedies of Aristophanes are as uproarious, biting, and ribald today as they were more than 2,400 years ago. But they also offer a unique window onto the societal norms, expectations, and concerns as well as the more mundane experiences of Athenians in the fifth century BCE. This course will examine closely all eleven of Aristophanes’ extant plays (in translation) in order to address topics such as the performative, ritual, and political contexts of Attic comedy, the constituency of audiences, the relationship of comedy to satire, the use of dramatic stereotypes, freedom of speech, and the limits of dissent. Please note that this course is rated MA for adult themes and language. (LC)\n\nCLCV 28319. Ephron Seminar. \"Imagining Nature among the Greeks\"? (L. Wash) | Winter\n\nThe goal of this course is to gain an understanding of the historical roots of the concept of nature (Greek physis), while being attentive to the diversity of ancient Greek thought about nature even in its early history. In the texts we will read, numerous notions of “nature” can be discerned: for instance, nature as the physical form of an individual, nature as an underlying reality of someone or something, nature as an autonomous thing distinct from human art and from the supernatural, nature as the all-encompassing natural order, or nature as the natural environment. The conceptual and ideological work done by these conceptions also varies wildly. Furthermore, the images associated with the concepts are similarly diverse, ranging from human bodies to magical plants and cosmic spheres, and with a comparable repertory of conceptual and ideological purposes. Yet discussions of the concept of nature typically deal almost exclusively in abstractions: this is true, for instance, of the standard study of physis written over a century ago as a U of C dissertation, which we will read in excerpt. Throughout this class, we will consider not only the explicit and abstract conceptualization of nature, but also a number of related images—especially in the form of metaphors, analogies and personifications—that ultimately fed into the literary and philosophical depictions of nature in the long traditions that have followed. (LC, LT)\n\nGREK 24519/34519. Lucan (A. Horne) | Winter\n\nLucian’s sparkling dialogues and essays are among the best of Greek humorous writing. Conscious of his long tradition, Lucian explores such topics as moral philosophy, literary history, and issues of fantasy, escapism, and belief—all while maintaining a light touch. We will read several works of Lucian in the original Greek. Translation will be supplemented by thematic discussions of Lucian’s comic technique and intellectual concerns. (LC)\n\nCLCV 12900 Civil War Literature (M. Lowrie) | Spring\n\n(=SIGN 26052) The Romans did not invent political strife, far from it, but they named the concept. Civil war (bellum civile) is technically formal war among citizens. Since antiquity, the Roman civil wars of the first century BCE, which brought the Roman Republic to the point of collapse, have been paradigmatic not only for the modern conceptualization of political discord, but for its narration. As Marx said of various stages of the French Revolution, it was fought in Roman garb, first of the Roman Republic, then of the Roman Empire. Despite the formal definition, ancient and modern tales of civil war typically turn on discord within the family, among the sexes, and in the cosmic order. Civil war comes to stand for pervasive social collapse. Beginning with Thucydides’ famous description of stasis on Corcyra, readings will encompass selections from Roman history (Caesar, Sallust, Velleius Paterculus, Tacitus), biography (Plutarch, Suetonius), Latin poetry (Horace, Propertius, Vergil, Seneca, Lucan), modern novels on civil war with Roman resonances (Victor Hugo, Michel Houellebecq), and articles on civil war from political science and conceptual history. Central questions will be repetition in history, whether civil war can ever come to an end, and whether its ghastly horror is constitutive of the political order and, if so, of what kind. (LC)\n\nCLCV 24219. Troy and Its Legacy. (M. Andrews) | Spring\n\n(=HIST 20404/230404 CLAS 34219) This course will explore the Trojan War through the archaeology, art, and mythology of the Greeks and Romans, as well as through the popular imaginings of it in later cultures. The first half will focus on the actual events of the \"Trojan War\" at the end of the second millennium BCE. We will study the site of Troy, the cities of the opposing Greeks, and the evidence for contact, cooperation, and conflict between the Greeks and Trojans. Students will get an introduction to the history of archaeology and the development of archaeological fieldwork. The second half will trace how the narrative and mythology of Homer's Iliad and the \"Trojan War\" were adapted and used by later civilizations, from classical Greece to twenty-first-century America, to justify their rises to political and cultural hegemony in the Mediterranean and the West, respectively. (LC)\n\nCLCV 25219. Art of Rhetoric from Aristotle-Cicero. (P. White) | Spring\n\n(=CLAS 35219, LLSO 25219). Rhetoric was the supreme technology of the Greco-Roman world, and the principal focus of formal schooling up to the end of antiquity and beyond. The readings for the course show how the psychology of persuasion was reduced to a system, how the system was adapted to political structures of the very different societies in which it flourished, and how orators put it into practice: Aristotle’s Rhetoric, Cicero’s On the Orator and Brutus, and selected speeches of Demosthenes, Cicero, and others. (LC)\n\nGREK 21116/31116. Herodotus. (D. Martinez) | Autumn\n\n(=FNDL 21116, NEHC 2/31116, RLST 21116, BIBL 31116) “I, Herodotus of Halicarnassus, am here setting forth my history, that what has been done may not fade in time from the memory of man, and great and remarkable achievements, whether of Greeks or foreign (barbaroi) peoples, may not lack the honor of remembrance” (I 1.1). “I am going to give an extended account of Egypt, because it has a greater number of remarkable things in it, and presents us with a greater number of extraordinary works, than any other country. For that reason I shall say more about it” (II 35.1). With those two sentences Herodotus expresses the over-all vision of his great History and his particular fascination with Egypt as a special case study of human civilization and man’s “great and remarkable achievements.” We will read Book II this quarter, with attention to Herodotus’ language and his unrivalled status as master of the older Ionic prose style. We will also focus on his historical method, his relish for narrative detail and diversion, and his interpretatio Graeca of Egyptian culture, civilization, and religion. (LC)\n\nGREK 25116/35116. Reading Greek Literature in the papyri (S. Torallas) | Autumn\n\n(=BIBL 36916 HCHR 36916, ANCM 45116).\n\nThe earliest—and often the only—witnesses for Greek literary works are the papyri. This makes their testimony of great importance for literary history and interpretation, but that testimony does not come without problems. In this course we will cover some of the concepts and techniques needed to recover the literary treasure contained in this highly complex material: from the history of book forms, the textual tradition of literary works, and the creation of the canons to more philological aspects such as editorial practice, Textkritik and paleography. Our literary corpus will include biblical texts, paraliterary (school and magical) texts, and translations of Egyptian texts into Greek. We will work with photographs of the papyri, and every part of the course will be based on practice. As appropriate we will also work with the University of Chicago’s collections of papyri. Requirements: at least two years of Greek. (LC)\n\nGREK 21300/31300. Greek Tragedy (C. Faraone) | Spring\n\nThis course is an introduction to Aeschylean drama in general, seen through the special problems posed by one play. Lectures and discussions are concerned with the play, the development and early form of Attic drama, and philosophical material. Modern Aeschylean scholars are also read and discussed. (LC)\n\nLATN 21100/31100. Roman Elegy (D. Wray) | Autumn\n\nThis course examines the development of the Latin elegy from Catullus to Ovid. Our major themes are the use of motifs and topics and their relationship to the problem of poetic persona. (LC, LG - Poetry)\n\nLATN 25200/35200. Medieval Latin (M. Allen) | Autumn\n\n(=HIST 23207/33207, HCHR 35200) The Practice of Carolingian Saints’ Tales. Spoken “Lingua Romana rustica” departed from canonical Ancient Latin long before the late eighth century. But at this time the renewed study of the Classics and grammar soon prompted scholars and poets to update the stories of their favorite saints, and to inscribe some for the first time. We shall examine examples of ninth-century Carolingian “réécriture” and of tandem new hagiography in both prose and verse by authors such as Lupus of Ferrières, Marcward of Prüm, Wandalbert of Prüm, Hildegar of Meaux and Heiric of Auxerre. All source readings in Classical Latin adapted to new Carolingian purposes, which we shall also explore historically in their own right. (LC)\n\nLATN 21219/31219. “Philosophical Prose: Cicero, Tusculan Disputations” (P. White) | Winter\n\n(=FNDL 21219) Several months after the death of his beloved daughter and just two years before his own death, Cicero composed a dialog with an imaginary interlocutor arguing that death, pain, grief, and other perturbations were an unimportant part of the big picture. A reading of this famous contribution—all of it in English, selections in Latin—to the genre of consolation literature affords an opportunity to weigh his many examples and his arguments for ourselves. (LC)\n\nLATN 21300/31300. Vergil. (M. Lowrie) | Spring\n\n(=FNDL 21301) Vergil’s ten Eclogues are some of Latin literature’s most enigmatic poems. In addition to reading this collection carefully in Latin, we will sample some of Theocritus’ pastoral in translation, Calpurnius Siculus’ Eclogues in Latin, and Milton’s Lycidas. Class time will focus on translation, interpretation, and discussion of secondary readings.

The readings pair primary texts with theoretical texts, each pair addressing issues of interdisciplinary comparison. They include Orson Welles’s “Citizen Kane” and Coleridge’s poem “Kubla Khan”; Benjamin’s “The Storyteller,” Kafka’s “Josephine the Mouse Singer,” Deleuze and Guattari, Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature, and Mario Vargas Llosa’s The Storyteller; Victor Segalen’sStèles; Fenollosa and Pound’s “The Chinese Character as a Medium of Poetry” and Eliot Weinberger’s Nineteen Ways of Looking at Wang Wei; Mérimée, “Carmen,” Bizet, Carmen, and the film adaptation U-Carmen e-Khayelitsha(South Africa, 2005); Gorky’s and Kurosawa’s The Lower Depths; Molière, Tartuffe, Dostoevsky, The Village Stepanchikovo and its Inhabitants, and Bakhtin, “Discourse in the Novel”; Gogol, The Overcoat, and Boris Eikhenbaum, “How Gogol’s Overcoat Is Made.” (LT)\n\nCMLT 24111/34111 The Soviet Empire (Leah Feldman) | Autumn\n\n(=NEHC 24110/34110, REES 24110/34110) What kind of empire was the Soviet Union? Focusing on the central idea of Eurasia, we will explore how discourses of gender, sexuality and ethnicity operated under the multinational empire. How did communism shape the state's regulation of the bodies of its citizens? How did genres from the realist novel to experimental film challenge a cohesive patriarchal, Russophone vision of Soviet Eurasia? We will examine how writers and filmmakers in the Caucasus and Central Asia answered Soviet Orientalist imaginaries, working through an interdisciplinary archive drawing literature and film from the Soviet colonial 'periphery' in the Caucasus and Central Asia as well as writings about the hybrid conception of Eurasia across linguistics, anthropology, and geography. (LT)\n\n*CMLT 25025/35025 Bilingual Bodies: Gender and Translation (Anna Elena Torres) | Winter*\n\nThe course will consider translation -- both theory and practice -- in relation to queer studies and gender and women's studies. Authors will include Naomi Seidman, Monique Balbuena, Yevgeniy Fiks, Raquel Salas Rivera, Kate Briggs, and others. For the final essay, students may write a research paper or translation project. (LT)\n\nCMLT 24272/34272 The Ancestral (Mark Payne) | Winter\n\n(=SCTH 34272) Recent work in history and anthropology has stressed the need for deeper models of origins and relations, perhaps even dispensing with “prehistory” as an alternative to more familiar forms of historical self-understanding. This class will look at how the ancestral in literature imagines such deep forms of historical belonging, staging modes of revenance whose cryptic vitalism challenges the phenomenological basis of new materialism. Readings will include Martin Heidegger, Ronald Hutton, Ethan Kleinberg, Quentin Meillassoux, Hans Ruin, and Anna Tsing, poetry by Li He and Osip Mandelstam, weird fiction by H. P. Lovecraft, Arthur Machen and Algernon Blackwood, and futurology by Cicely Hamilton, Jean Hegland, Sarah Moss, and Will Self. (LT)\n\nCMLT 50205 Contemporary Critical Theory 1920-Present (Haun Saussy) | Winter\n\nThis course (the second half of the required Comparative Literature introductory sequence) roams the cultural landscape transformed by Freud, Saussure, Shklovsky, the First World War, and the Russian Revolution. Readings from psychoanalytic, formalist and Marxist criticism, from the corresponding heresies, and their successors. The aim throughout is to locate theoretical texts in the polemical situations to which they originally were addressed, and others in which they subsequently were invoked. (LT)\n\nCMLT 27512/37512 Dream of the Red Chamber: Forgetting About the Author (Haun Saussy) | Spring\n\n(=EALC 27512/37512) The great Chinese-Manchu novel _Honglou meng_ (ca. 1750) has been assigned one major author, Cao Xueqin, whose life has been the subject of much investigation. But before 1922 little was known about Cao, and interpreters of the novel were forced to make headway solely on the basis of textual clues. The so-called “Three Commentators” edition (_Sanjia ping Shitou ji_) shows these readers at their creative, polemical, and far-fetched best. We will be reading the first 80 chapters of the novel and discussing its reception in the first 130 years of its published existence (1792-1922), with special attention to hermeneutical strategies and claims of authorial purpose. (LT, LC)\n\nCMLT 29120/39120 Renaissance Christian Epic: Tasso, Vida, Milton (Joshua Scodel) | Spring\n\n(=ENGL 29120/39120) This course will focus upon the two most important Renaissance Christian epics, Torquato Tasso’s La Gerusalemme liberata/Jerusalem Delivered(first pub. 1581) and John Milton’s Paradise Lost(first pub. 1667), and two brief Biblical epics, Marco Girolamo Vida’s Christiad(1535) and Milton’s Paradise Regained (1671). We will examine these four Renaissance epics as ambitious efforts to revive an ancient and pagan form in order to depict Christian and self-consciously modern visions. We will consider how Renaissance epic poets imitate and emulate both their classical models (primarily Homer’s Iliadand Odyssey, Virgil’s Aeneid, and Ovid’s Metamorphoses) and Judeo-Christian sources (primarily the Bible); seek to forge an elevated and appropriate language for epic in Latin, Italian, and English; espouse new visions of the human, the heroic, and gender relations; and adumbrate distinctively modern national, imperial, and global ambitions. All non-English texts will be read in translation, but students who can read Latin or Italian will be encouraged to read the originals. (LC)\n\nReturn to top of page\n\nEAST ASIAN LANGUAGES & CIVILIZATIONS\n\nEALC 24513/34513 Documentary Chinese (Guy Alitto) | Autumn\n\nThis course guides students through critical readings of primary historical documents from approximately 1800 through 1950. these documents are translated sentence by sentence, and then historiographically analyzed. Most of these documents are from the nineteenth century. Genres include public imperial edicts, secret imperial edicts, secret memorials to the throne from officials, official reports to superiors and from superiors, funerial essays, depositions (\"confessions\"), local gazetteers (fangzhi), newspapers, and periodicals. To provide an introduction to these genres, the first six weeks of the course will use the Fairbank and Kuhn textbook The Rebellion of Chung Jen-chieh (Harvard-Yanjing Institute). The textbook provides ten different genres of document with vocabulary glosses and grammatical explanations; all documents relate to an 1841–42 rebellion in Hubei province. Each week prior to class students electronically submit a written translation of the document or documents to be read; a day after the class they electronically submit a corrected translation of the document or documents read. A fifteen-page term paper based on original sources in documentary Chinese is also required. A reading knowledge of modern (baihua) Chinese and some familiarity with classical Chinese (wenyan) or Japanese Kanbun. Other students may take the course with permission from the instructor. (LC, LG - Nonfiction)\n\nEALC 24812 Women Writing Women in Modern Japanese Literature (M. Mazza-Hilway) | Autumn\n\nThis course surveys the literary works by women writers of Japan through the modern period from late Meiji (early 1900s) through mid-Shōwa (1970s). Throughout this period, Japanese writers and critics have been preoccupied with questions related to self-expression: How does one know and represent one’s self in writing? Can a true self be expressed through the artifice of literature? What is the relationship between writing and self-consciousness? Yet literature written by women has largely been left out of this conversation, and often chronically consigned to the margins as mere ‘women’s writing’, a pale imitation of pure (male-authored) literature. Aiming to address this unevenness, this course engages with groundbreaking works of literature authored by women. Furthermore, in order to transcend insubstantial and limiting categories such as “women’s writing”, students’ analysis will be focused using the dynamic lense of women writing women: that is, women’s self-representation in literature. Readings for the course are grouped by larger themes which are key not only to students’ analysis of literary works, but in relation to the larger social, political and cultural contexts in which the works were produced. All works will be read in English translation.\n\nEALC 25415 Early Daoist Literature and Thought (D. Lebovitz) | Autumn\n\nAccording to the Laozi, “The Way (Dao) that can be told of (dao-ed) is not the eternal Way.” Like “the Way,” “Daoism” as a religion, philosophy, or school of thought, is a fundamentally elusive and contested category in Chinese studies. Exploring its texts and controversies, however, makes for a stimulating introduction to some of the core values and concerns of Chinese civilization. In this course, we will read a variety of literature regarded as belonging to “Daoism” in one sense or another. We will approach texts such as the Laozi (Daodejing; Classic of the Way and Virtue) and Zhuangzi (Chuang-tzu) as literary expressions of Chinese thought, but also as resources for later cultural and religious developments. The primary work of the course will engage us in careful reading and discussion. We will explore both commentarial interpretations of the texts and will think creatively about how to understand and interpret the texts today. Students will be expected to conduct an independent research project at the end of the term. Knowledge of Chinese is not required. Open to MAPH students, equivalent course EALC 35415 (LC, LT)\n\nEALC 25709/35709 Picturing Moral Autonomy in China and Elsewhere (M. Powers) | Autumn\n\n(=ARTH 25709/35709) This course examines how intellectuals in Preindustrial China maintained their independence, as well as their moral compass, in times of inordinate social and political pressure. Systematic thinking on this topic appears early in China, beginning with Confucius and Mencius, but was by no means limited to the Confucian tradition. Zhuangzi (late 4th c. BCE) devoted an entire chapter to the problem. This course will survey some important meditations on the topic from the Classical period, but will focus on the Song dynasty (960-1278) with its rich body of essays, poems, and paintings touching upon the problem of moral autonomy. To supplement our study of primary sources we’ll read secondary sources on Song law, society, and government, as well as relevant secondary studies of European art. Later in the course we will read reflections on Song period Chinese essays by English radicals of the 18th century, and will wrap up with American classics by Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Wendell Berry. Along the way we will learn how to conduct “close readings” of both written and visual materials for clues to the deep, humanistic themes underlying artistic choice. (LC)\n\nEALC 27016/37016 Comparative Metahistory (H. Saussy, U. Timme Kragh) | Autumn\n\n(=KNOW 27016/37016, CMLT 27016) The seminar will focus on classical, medieval, and modern historiography from China, India, and Tibet seeking answers to three general questions: (1) How are senses of historical time created in Asian historiographies by means of rhetorical figures of repetition, parallelism, dramatic emplotment, frame stories, and interweaving storylines? (2) How are historical persons and events given meaning through use of poetic devices, such as comparison, simile, and metaphor? And (3) How do Asian histories impose themselves as realistic accounts of the past by means of authoritative devices using citation of temporal-spatial facts, quotation of authority, and/or reliance on established historical genres? The methods employed to answer these questions are here adapted from pre-modern Asian knowledge systems of literary theory, poetics, dramaturgy, and epistemology, and thus permit looking at other knowledge formations from within the discourse of the traditions themselves. (LC, LT)\n\nEALC 27515/37515Beijing: Past and Present (N. Feng) | Autumn\n\nThis class explores the history and cultural life of Beijing from the Yuan dynasty to the present. First, in what ways did the city develop over the course of the past millennium and how did the material space of the city impact people’s daily life? Using materials from archaeology and architecture, we will track the permutation of the city plan, the process of construction and destruction, and the social and cultural life of urban residents. Second, how was Beijing experienced, understood, and represented in varied literary and art forms from the imperial period to today? Through literature (Lao She, Lin Yutang), art (Xu Bing, Song Dong.), and film (directed by Chen Kaige, Jia Zhangke, Guan Hu) that features Beijing and its people, we will study the city not only as an imagined site of remembrance and nostalgia, but also a political site constructing cultural identities and reflecting social conflicts. This class has a Language across the Curriculum section, and we will read selected novels and poems on Beijing. Open to MAPH students but not PhD students. (LC)\n\nEALC 10701Topics in EALC: Poets/Teachers/Fighters:Writing Women in China and Beyond (P. Iovene) | Winter\n\nA survey of essays, poetry, diaries and fiction by women writers from the 12th to the 21th century in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. No previous knowledge of Chinese is required. (LC)\n\nEALC 15100/35100Beginning the Chinese Novel (A. Fox) | Winter\n\n(=FNDL 20301) This course will look at the four great novels of sixteenth-century China: Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Water Margin, Journey to the West, and Plum in the Golden Vase. Deeply self-conscious about the process of their own creation and their place within the larger literary canon, these novels deploy multiple frames, philosophical disquisitions, invented histories, and false starts before the story can properly begin. By focusing on the first twelve chapters of each novel, this course will serve as both an introduction to the masterworks of Chinese vernacular literature and an exploration of the fraught beginnings of a new genre. Open to MAPH students. (LC, LG - Fiction)\n\nEALC 44622 Keywords in Chinese Literary and Cultural Criticism (P. Iovene) | Winter\n\nAn investigation of the key concepts in 20th Century Chinese literary and cultural criticism, and of the ways in which they have been transformed over time. Concepts to be discussed may include \"science,\" \"world,\" \"modern,\" in their various Chinese renditions. Some course readings will be in Chinese. (LT)\n\nEALC 22027/32027 The Modern Japanese Novel (H. Long) | Spring\n\nThis course introduces students to modern Japanese literature through the form of the novel. We begin in the late-nineteenth century, when a new generation of writers sought to come to terms with this world historical form, and end in the twenty-first, with writers trying to sustain the form through graphic art and digital media. Along the way, we will consider some of the key debates that have structured the novel's evolution: between elite and mass forms, truth and fiction, art and politics, self and other, native and foreign. The course also looks at how the form has evolved in response to shifting modes of cultural production and shifting patterns of literary consumption. Authors covered will include Natsume Soseki, Tanizaki Jun'ichiro, Kawabata Yasunari, Oe Kenzaburo, Tawada Yoko, Murakami Haruki, and Mizumura Minae. All works will be read in English.
