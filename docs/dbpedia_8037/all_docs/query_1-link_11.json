        "text": "He was Bound to Love You, When He Heard You Sing\n\n752 Words | 2 Pages\n\nEver heard of a story that sings of the “Angel of Music” and the “Phantom of the Opera”? A tale that once you have listened to the sweet melody that you will realized that you've pasted the “Point of No Return”? This love triangle has captivated multitudes ever since the 1910 original Phantom of the Opera was published in France by Monsieur Leroux, although most story lovers recall the musical of the same name by Andrew Lloyd Webber or the motion picture adaption. Although this story has been entertaining people for over a century, in this new era have prerecorded voices and movements begun to overshadow the talented performers of live theater? Although “The lavish screen adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera (2005) only deepened the damage” of the dislike of musicals made into film “with non-stars in the leads and an unimaginative production,”(Musical),which version, the live performance or the film, makes the story more attractive? To answer these questions, permit this essay to analyze two methods of storytelling: 2011 live performance Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall and the 2005 film, and decide if music and story lovers everywhere have too “turned from true beauty”.\n\nAnalysis Of Josecito Leon Y Su Internacional Banda Roja '\n\n1026 Words | 3 Pages\n\nOn October 23, 2016 I went to a concert type of event that different music groups were performing. This event is what Hispanics call a “Jaripeo Baile,” which is a place that people can see other people bull riding like in the rodeo, but this event was only about music groups performing. One of the music groups that performed was a band called “Josecito Leon y Su Internacional Banda Roja.” While I watched the band’s performance it reminded me of how it relates to the themes that were from our readings and discussions that we had throughout the semester.\n\nNelly Concert\n\n595 Words | 2 Pages\n\nOn Monday March 25, some members of the baseball team, my girlfriend, and I traveled to Murray State University to watch a concert performed by Nelly and the St. Lunatics. It was a terrible night to go anywhere because it was raining and storming the whole way, but there was nothing that was going to stop us from going to the concert. We where all so hyped up about it and couldn’t wait to head out. My brother, who attends Murray State, had gotten us excellent seats about seventy-five feet away from the stage.\n\nConcert Critique\n\n597 Words | 2 Pages\n\nOn Tuesday, October 17, 2017, I attended a musical concert. This was the first time I had ever been to a concert and did not play. The concert was not what I expected. I assumed I was going to a symphony that featured a soloist clarinet; however, upon arrival I quickly realized that my previous assumptions were false. My experience was sort of a rollercoaster. One minute I was down and almost asleep; next I was laughing; then I was up and intrigued.\n\nPunk Rock Essay\n\n934 Words | 2 Pages\n\nPunk rock often attains to individuals who are against the order and corruption of society and especially the music industry. As ticket prices for arena shows skyrocketed, the popularity of small underground venues with low entry prices increased. These venues are very willing to let local punk rock bands play if they can draw in a large crowd. This intimate experience sparks the thrill of playing on stage. As more of these club venues open, more up and coming musicians get a taste of the spotlight drug. When the audience of a punk rock show pick up on the performer’s adrenaline rush, they also receive a taste of it.\n\nDramaturgical Analysis\n\n1189 Words | 3 Pages\n\n“All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players.” William Shakespeare may have written these words in As You Like It in 1600, but Erving Goffman truly defined the phrase with his dramaturgical theory. Dramaturgical analysis is the study of social interaction in terms of theatrical performance. Unlike actors though, who use a script telling them how to behave in every scene, real life human interactions change depending upon the social situation they are in. We may have an idea of how we want to be perceived, and may have the foundation to make that happen. But we cannot be sure of every interaction we will have throughout the day, having to ebb and flow with the conversations and situations as they happen.\n\nAnalysis Of Too Much Punch For Judy\n\n1010 Words | 3 Pages\n\nThe play that we read for this unit is Too Much Punch For Judy, by Mark Wheeller. It is a form of Verbatim Theatre, meaning that it is based on the spoken words of real people. This play is about the story of a young woman who kills her sister in an alcohol related accident. When I first read the play I couldn’t empathize with the story as I haven’t experienced such a shocking event before. In this essay I will describe, analyse and evaluate both my work and the work of other actors in my group, focusing on the mediums, elements and explorative strategies of Drama.\n\nCompare And Contrast Two Concert\n\n1854 Words | 4 Pages\n\nOver this semester, I attended two concerts. The first concert I went to was a performance done by the Swedish band Graveyard at the 9:30 club in DC. The second concert that I went to was at the George Mason Center for Performing Arts. This concert was a jazz competition between bands call The Battle of the Big Bands. Both concerts were performed very well and kept the audience, myself included, very entertained throughout the entire show. In this paper, I will be discussing each individual show in depth, and then continuing on to compare the two concerts.\n\nForum Theatre Essay\n\n1473 Words | 3 Pages\n\nIn his book ‘Games for Actors and Non-actors’ (2002), Boal likens forum theatre to invisible theatre, but unlike with invisible theatre where the spectator is unaware they are part of the action, forum theatre makes the spectators conscious of their involvement in the piece. This makes them what Boal refers to as the spec-actor. Forum theatre starts the same way all most theatre “the show is performed as if it were a conventional play. A certain image of the world is presented” (Boal, 2002: 243). Once the first performance is over, it will begin again, but this time the audience or ‘spec-actor’ is allowed to stop the performance at any time, make their way onto the stage and make the chances they think necessary to change the original outcome of the piece. This aspect makes it a good theatre practice to help people tackle issues that may occur in daily life such as abuse or suicide, as well as perhaps more pressing political issues. Its ability to adapt its stories to what is considered relevant to society means that it can continue to work as a means of highlighting issues for an unprecedented amount of time. It was in it’s most basic form an attempt to portray society’s issues through theatre and give people the opportunities to come up with\n\nDescriptive Essay On My First Concert\n\n895 Words | 2 Pages\n\nThere is an event that I just can describe as one of the most unique and memorable in my life: attending my first concert. After years of listening to Ron Pope’s music, watching his YouTube channel, and following all of his social media accounts, the satisfaction of seeing someone whose music has been the soundtrack to my life for so long was unreal. There were moments that I had to internally remind myself that this is, in fact, happening in real life. Being a dedicated (some may say eccentrically so) fan is tough work – and I was rewarded with two hours of pure magic for one night. Attending my first concert was a unique event that I will always remember fondly because of the atmosphere, the amazing performance and the sense of connection\n\nImportance Of Theatre\n\n1376 Words | 3 Pages\n\nFor thousands of years, people have been arguing that theatre is a dying art form. Many people think theatre is all just cheesy singing and dancing or just boring old Shakespeare, but there is much more to theatre than those two extremes. Theatre is important to our society because it teaches us more about real life than recorded media. Theatre has been around for thousands of years and began as a religious ceremony that evolved into an art form that teaches about the true essence of life. Theatre can incorporate profound, and provocative, observations of the human condition that can transcend time; lessons found in Greek plays can still be relevant to the modern world. People argue that the very essence of theatre is being snuffed out by modern"
