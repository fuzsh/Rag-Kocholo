Reconstruction of a tragedy that started as a comedy.\n\nRigoletto, the court jester to the king, is standing in a small boat with a body bag. The person in the bag is not the one he wished to have killed. In his confusion, he tries to reconstruct the events that have led up to this fate. Two singers, two actors and a pianist join him in his descent into the tragedy that began as a comedy.\n\nCredits"
