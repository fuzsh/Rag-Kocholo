        "text": "Module: Dissertation.\n\nTitle: ‘Nostalgic Reality’: Authenticity and Fidelity in Adaptations of Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables.\n\nWord Count: 9778.\n\nGrade: 80.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe heritage culture industry in Great Britain is, to a large extent, dominated by left-wing criticism, often centred on 1980s television adaptations of Victorian literature. Heritage critics, in an attempt to rally against right-wing governments, frequently privilege the notion that the industry, as a modern conservative phenomenon, draws upon ‘nostalgic’ memories of historical novels in order to project a means by which contemporary culture can legitimise the politics of ‘mean times.’ Through an analysis of the Cameron Mackintosh 1985 stage and Tom Hooper 2012 screen adaptations of Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables, this dissertation explores the notion that the quest for an ‘authentic’ and ‘faithful’ relationship with their original source material is of greater importance to adaptive work than their affiliation with this heritage genre. Focussing significantly on Jean Baudrillard’s poststructuralist concept of ‘reality’ and ‘nostalgia’ this analysis will discuss the ways in which these modern adaptations approach Hugo’s subversive notions of the ‘real,’ ensuring that ‘authentic’ representations of his literary past, as well as aesthetic ‘fidelity’ to his original work, can be achieved. Moreover, through faithfulness to the very ‘un-reality’ of Hugo’s novel, these stage and screen adaptations prove that when literary history is considered on its own terms, outside the realms of ‘nostalgia,’ both authenticity and fidelity is possible.\n\nContents­\n\nIntroduction.\n\n1. ‘The real is no longer what it was’: Identity, social space and a quest for the ‘real’ in Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables.\n\n2. Nostalgic representations of the past: Aesthetic authenticity in Cameron Mackintosh’s 1985 stage musical Les Misérables.\n\n3. ‘I dreamed a dream’: Emotional fidelity in Tom Hooper’s Les Misérables (2012).\n\nConclusion.\n\nBibliography.\n\nIntroduction\n\n“When the real is no longer what it was, nostalgia assumes its full meaning.”[1]\n\nJean Baudrillard\n\nIn her article on the political occultations in Victor Hugo’s seminal French masterpiece Les Misérables[2] Kathryn Grossman suggests that “the novelist attempts to encompass the whole of reality.”[3] Benjamin Poore, in his important book on the nature of staging heritage theatre, refutes this hypothesis. He discusses contemporary culture’s recollection of the past, specifically Victorian Britain, in terms of Baudrillard’s concept of “nostalgia,” coining the term “anecdotalism” to describe the way we like to “capture [the Victorians] ‘in a nutshell.’”[4] When determining historical events or adapting historical novels, the very notion of what is ‘real’ becomes problematic, something that has significant implications for notions of authenticity and fidelity when adapting the work of a nineteenth-century author into a contemporary stage show or film. There is an implication in what Poore is saying that to seek an ‘authentic’ past is an impossible dream as it implies that we are fully conscious of our history, something that can manifestly never be the case as long as it is determined in such a selective manner. Through a study of Hugo’s Les Misérables, and the 1985 stage and 2012 screen adaptations of the same name, this dissertation seeks to analyse ways in which notions of the ‘real’ in an original text impact the merits of seeking historical authenticity and aesthetic fidelity in adaptation. If, as Baudrillard contends, “the real is no longer what it was,” it is possible that any quest for authenticity and fidelity in adaptation relies significantly on the deconstruction of “nostalgia” as an overriding concept.\n\nDuring the promotional interviews prior to the release of the 2012 screen adaptation of Les Misérables,[5] Tom Hooper explained how he decided to produce the entire film in the medium of song as he did not want “two competing levels of realism.”[6] Given the opposing theoretical arguments with regards representations of historical authenticity and reality, it is worth reflecting on the realism that Hooper is attempting to recreate, as well as the barometer on which we are to judge its success. Grossman suggests that the “notion of appearances” in Les Misérables “is linked to the historian’s task of probing reality;”[7] the very question of who Hugo’s principal character, Jean Valjean, truly is, is linked to Hugo’s interrogation of reality in his work as a whole. As Grossman indicates Hugo often blurs the lines between fact and fiction, and the literary and the historic; thus identifying a sense of the ‘real’ in Hugo’s original work is going to be problematic for the likes of Hooper.\n\nThe multiple identities of characters such as Jean Valjean can be considered a microcosm of the complex challenge of exploring the many adaptations of Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables. The first chapter of this dissertation will focus on the competing notions of the ‘real’ in Hugo’s novel, embodied in the multiple identities of Valjean, as well as the conflated relationship between individual identity and Parisian space, that makes searching for a level of reality complicated. Digressing from his fictional tale on a number of occasions, Hugo articulates: “may we here break off our narrative to recall that we are dealing with a matter of fact?”[8] Hugo is demonstrably self-aware of the narrative contradiction between fact and fiction that he is portraying. Les Misérables is a novel of many facades, at one instant set in the ‘real’ Battle of Waterloo, at the next the fictional barricades of 1832; themselves a fictional representation of the ‘real’ barricades of the July Revolution in 1830. Reinterpreting a sense of reality in Hugo’s original work, as well as an authentic vision of the historical period of revolutionary France, could be problematic. Fidelity to a particular contemporary medium, as well as to the complicated psychological depth of the principal characters, however, should not be sacrificed in a vain search for the ‘real.’\n\nInvoking the spirit of rebellion and revolution that is evident in Hugo’s original work, chapter two will provide a study of the 1985 West End musical stage adaptation, produced by Cameron Mackintosh.[9] It can be contended that musical numbers such as “Do you hear the people sing” and “Red and black,” along with the aesthetic spectacle of the barricade, “The first attack” and “The second attack,”[10] project an air of authenticity in relation to the spirit of rebellion in revolutionary nineteenth-century France, as well as in relation to its ‘original;’ what can be considered the original in the context of this – or any – stage adaptation, however, is a complicated matter that is open to debate. The timing of the original West End release – first staged in the midst of the Conservative Thatcher Government, as well as in the wake of the UK miner’s strike and the Brixton and Toxteth riots – is potentially of great importance. It is possible that there is a narrative link between Hugo’s fictional barricade and story of rebellion and the residing feeling of resentment and challenge to the political elite from the working classes of England in the 1980s. In her exploratory piece on 1980s musical theatre Miranda Lundskaer-Nielsen suggests that the stage can be “a place for political and sociological debate.”[11] Whilst to challenge the status quo within society is debatably the hallmark of all art and culture, it can also be argued that it becomes problematic in the genre of musical stage adaptation, a medium largely marketed towards the middle classes.[12] Although it could be argued that Hugo’s novel may itself have been targeted towards a middle-class readership, the invocation of the spirit of revolution, the dichotomy between the subject matter of the French lower classes of the nineteenth century, and a “Middle England”[13] audience, results in a complex web of authenticity in relation to the original text, the medium of musical theatre and the prevailing British political tensions of the 1980s.\n\nThe complicated nature of a screen adaptation that invokes the spirit of one medium (an original novel), but takes its source text from another (a stage adaptation of the novel) is likely to create a significant imbalance in terms of any notion of fidelity to its source material. Chapter three will focus on an analysis of the film in terms of a quest for faithfulness; establishing both the means by which it is hoped to be gained – the medium of film and sung dialogue on screen – as well as the original source text to which it seeks fidelity. Whilst Hooper’s film adaptation adopts the same characters and is marketed as an adaptation of Hugo’s novel, it also transfers the medium of musical theatre onto the screen and takes the original West End script as its dialogue. To further complicate matters there is also a wealth of both French and English spoken non-musical screen adaptations that the movie can draw inspiration from, as well as the “nostalgic” history of nineteenth-century Paris. Hooper’s own analysis of his screen adaptation suggests that he was wary of “a barrier of artificiality between the audience and the…characters.”[14] Given the many sources the film can reinterpret, and notwithstanding its relationship to Hugo’s novel and Mackintosh’s stage show, this chapter will analyse Hooper’s “barrier of artificiality” primarily on its own terms; Davies contends, after all, that the copy is an “act of creation in itself.”[15]\n\nThe film focuses on a number of principal themes, including the love triangle involving Cosette, Éponine and Marius. When considering the film on its own terms it is critical to analyse the relationships, character journeys and plot lines in terms of their effect on the narrative as a whole. Christian Gutleben, in his sceptical critique of neo-Victorian and neo-historical culture, suggests that “discourse has replaced the convention of psychological depth.”[16] Whilst there are moments in the film which lack the narrative honesty that Gutleben seeks, this is potentially not the case in other areas: Anne Hathaway’s interpretation of Fantine during “I dreamed a dream;” Hugh Jackman’s “Soliloquy;” and Aaron Tveit’s powerful rendition of “ABC café/Red and black” are all examples of where the medium of live song on screen can actually increase the sense of depth of characterisation.[17] This analysis, however, will also focus on the lack of depth and narrative honesty, as Gutleben hypothesises, in the Éponine/Cosette/Marius love triangle, specifically the way in which it damages both the sense of faithfulness to the spirit of Hugo’s original, as well as the relationship that this storyline has with others in the film. Any sense of fidelity, whether to the original source, or as a piece of art in its own right, is reliant on the narrative standing up to scrutiny against the backdrop of the film as a spectacle, as well as in relation to its source material.\n\n‘The real is no longer what it was’: Identity, social space and a quest for the ‘real’ in Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables\n\n“Evil must hide behind false appearances to project an air of respectability and legitimacy. Such characters need frequent changes of identity.”[18]\n\nKathryn Grossman\n\nIn her analysis of Les Misérables Kathryn Grossman examines the relationship between the evil in individual characters and their need to create multiple identities in order to disguise their illegitimacy within a specific culture and discourse. When analysing an “evil” character such as Monsieur Thénardier and his many guises, both in name – Jondrette, Thénard and Fabantou – as well as in his multiple physical appearances, it is evident that there is some traction in what Grossman is theorising. The very subversive nature of evil, however, can be turned on its head when considered in the context of an individual character, or even a geographical location, that too are dependent on alternative identities and appearances, but for an altogether more altruistic purpose. Throughout this narrative of the life of Jean Valjean – also known as 24601, Monsieur Madeleine, Monsieur La Maire, Ultime Fauchelevent, Monsieur Leblanc, and Urbain Fabre – there are a number of identities forced or bestowed upon him, as well as some he has chosen to pursue himself. Whilst it can be argued that the use of multiple identities by Valjean is largely self-serving in his constant pursuit to evade Inspector Javert, the benevolent nature of these identities is also in evidence; in particular when he cares for Fantine, before adopting her child, Cosette, after she dies. Critics such as Grossman view the demonstration of “such “feminine” qualities as compassion and maternity” as “transcend[ing] the conventional dichotomy of gender.”[19] Additionally Victoria Thompson contends that in nineteenth-century Paris the identity of an individual can largely be linked to the geographical space in which they occupy, suggesting that “the telling of “spatial stories” has serious implications for the formation of identity and the distribution of power.”[20] The conflation of Valjean’s various identities – including his supposed ignorance of traditional gender scripts – and his relationship with the geography of France can therefore be considered as part of a grand narrative of historical identity subversion. In a society intrinsically dependent on strict class-dominated spatial structures a man with no discernible fixed identity also lacks a space in the world to call his own.\n\nThe subversive way in which Hugo approaches his historical narrative should not be mistaken for historical inaccuracy; the very conflation of historical events such as the Battle of Waterloo with his fictional history, suggests that Hugo is very deliberate in his act of historical subversion. Whilst Thompson rightly argues that early nineteenth-century Paris was dependent on “the classification of Parisians into easily recognizable social types…[rendering] the social hierarchy of the city…easily legible,”[21] the conflation of class identity in the character of Valjean can be seen as a deliberate subversive act, challenging the status quo of which Thompson writes. Recalling the initial trial of the young Valjean the narrator, in the same way as Thomson highlights, dictates the social structure in to which Valjean, a poacher, was born:\n\nThe poacher works in the woods, and the smuggler in the mountains or on the sea. The towns make men ferocious because they make them corrupt. Mountains, sea, and forest make men reckless. They stir the wildness of men’s nature, but do not necessarily destroy what is human.[22]\n\nThe narrator, who it can be argued is Hugo after referring to himself as “the writer”[23] within this very passage, is keen to identify the social standing to which Valjean is born and the expectations of the social script that he is to adhere to in his life. Associating Valjean’s character as intrinsically linked with his surroundings, Hugo defines Valjean at this early stage as a reckless man; as someone who takes the wildness of his nature from the wildness of his surroundings. Hugo demonstrates Peter Ackroyd’s modern psychogeographic notion that a person’s “dwelling can materially affect the character and behaviour of the people who live within them.”[24] By declaring that the recklessness and wildness of a man’s nature “do not…destroy what is human” Hugo introduces the subversive way in which the concept of the ‘real’ identity is going to be approached; Valjean’s character will not be determined by a rigid, pre-scripted social order, but by cause and effect his life and character will take many paths. Hugo opts for a narrative that will challenge, as Fiona Cox suggests, the “precarious nature”[25] of the rigid nineteenth-century French social order. The very notion of a fixed identity in Les Misérables is ‘un-real.’\n\nWhilst it can be suggested that Hugo’s characterisation of Valjean’s identity lies somewhere between ambivalence and subversion, it can also be argued that the physical space that Hugo’s characters occupy is a welcome complication to this identity narrative. Iain Sinclair suggests that where “resistance…[is] required”[26] psychological relationships between individual characters and the physical space in which corporeal identities occupy will always come to the fore. Where a resistance narrative such as Les Misérables is at its most effective is not only when individual psychology and social space are intertwined, but when discursive social norms of identity are challenged. As Thompson rightly highlights, the “…conceptualization of space is linked to questions of identity.”[27] As the novel progresses into Paris – and we are introduced to the street urchin Gavroche and the middle-class student Marius – Hugo is quick to inform us that it is the “back streets…that the real Parisian is to be found.”[28] It is implicit in Hugo’s dialogue that the “real Parisian” is a poor Parisian – a character such as Gavroche – and that the social space that they are decreed to occupy is out of sight of the rest of society, in an area of the city that Cox describes as the “shadowlands of poverty.”[29] Moreover, whilst it is the sinister shadowlands that the poor Parisian physically occupies, it is the shadowlands of the mind that determines their psychology. As a motif of the lower classes within early nineteenth-century Paris, both the stage and screen adaptations adopt this aesthetic given to them by Hugo. The stage show utilises an extremely effective use of space – the poor, stooped characters enter the stage from the rear, moving slowly towards the front – dim light and smoke as the poor of Montreuil-sur-Mer emerge singing “At the end of the day.” The film, it could be argued, goes a stage further by depicting the poor of Montreuil-sur-Mer literally occupying the shadowlands of a tunnel. The entrapment of their own psychologies is reflected in the physical entrapment that they face by the locked gates, only opened to allow Inspector Javert, occupying a social space on horseback indicative of his social rank, through from one open space to another. Both representations do, in effect, portray a sense of Hugo’s “real Parisian,” as well as the social order attested to by Thompson.\n\nThis link between a geographical location and an individual psychology is a common motif of the contemporary critical theory known as psychogeography. Reflecting on psychogeographic theory Peter Ackroyd proposes that “…a street as a dwelling can materially affect the character and behaviour of the people who live within them.”[30] His interpretation is heavily weighted in favour of geography over human psychology. It is an important interpretation that Valjean emphasises on a number of occasions, not least at the beginning of the narrative as he is assessing his time in prison. “It is gaol that makes the gaolbird”[31] he informs us, highlighting the role played by the State in creating criminals out of citizens and malign intent out of mere stupidity, concluding that “it was prison that changed me.”[32] As Valjean transcends his criminal identity in the novel (depicted in the “Soliloquy” scenes in both the stage and screen adaptations) he is left “no more than a shadow” before “vanish[ing] entirely.”[33] Whilst there is an argument to suggest that Valjean currently occupies the “shadowlands of poverty” that may well be expected of a convict on the run, it can be further surmised that his plummet into the shadows is an early example of the self-determination that he is to demonstrate throughout the narrative, as well as indicative of a character who will transcend the pre-determined social spaces of nineteenth-century France. In order to navigate his own quest for identity Valjean must in the first instance reject the State sanctioned identity that has previously been determined on his behalf.\n\nAs Valjean exits the “shadowlands of poverty” Hugo makes a concerted effort to dehumanise him; in effect, “destroy[ing] what is human.”[34] After being turned away from a number of places whilst looking for somewhere to sleep in Digne, Valjean is finally “driven out of a dog-kennel,” declaring in frustration “I’m not even a dog.”[35] Whilst far from ideal for Valjean, it is a turning point in his characterisation, his quest for acceptance and his search for an identity. Valjean may well believe it is the “gaol that makes the gaolbird,” or that it is the State and Society that dictates the terms under which he must live, but it is the Bishop that provides him with the chance for an alternative identity; an identity that goes against the grain of what is expected of him and lifts him up from the base level that the dog and the gaoler have reduced him to. On being caught stealing the Bishop’s silver, Valjean is afforded a reprieve, given silver candlesticks and told “…do not ever forget that you have promised me to use the money to make yourself an honest man.”[36] Through his own act of benevolence, the Bishop ensures Valjean has the chance to “demonstrat[e] heart as well as muscle,”[37] in what Grossman characterises as not only an opportunity to transcend his social status, but the “conventional dichotomy of gender”[38] also.\n\nHaving spent nineteen years incarcerated as a convict Valjean can be considered as the epitome of the criminal ““masculine” ideal,”[39] stealing silver from the Bishop who has given him shelter[40] and robbing money from the urchin Petit-Gervais.[41] Valjean’s transformation into the charitable and caring entrepreneur, town mayor and adoptive father of the poor girl Cosette, can be seen as a feminisation of his identity, yet it would be too simplistic to suggest that he has merely taken on a feminine role and discourse; a discourse, it should not be forgotten, that is dependent on the knowledge and understanding of multiple scripts. It would be true to suggest that the language used to describe his fatherly affection towards Cosette could be described as traditionally motherly, effeminate, or even sexual: “everything in him that was passionate and capable of affection had been aroused and had flowed out to the child.”[42] However, rather than suggest a dichotomisation in Valjean’s identity between feminine and masculine, woman and man, or mother and father, Hugo astutely adopts a more androgynous – or gender neutral – identity for Valjean; as Grossman insightfully argues: Valjean “transcends the conventional dichotomy of gender.”[43] In spite of his benevolent, altruistic and ordered nature Valjean also uses his physical strength to retrieve Fauchelevent from under his cart,[44] as well as to rescue Marius from the barricade, dragging him through the Parisian sewage system.[45] As Grossman concludes Valjean combines both “anarchy and regularity into a more complex, hybrid order,”[46] creating an identity that both conforms and complicates traditional discourses of gender. Moreover, in the context of Hugo’s interpretation of the ‘real,’ it is a further example of the subversive way in which he approaches identity in order to challenge the nineteenth-century French social order.\n\nJean Baudrillard contends that “when the real is no longer what it was, nostalgia assumes its full meaning.”[47] Through a complex transcendence of conventional identity politics and a conflicting relationship between Javert’s multiple identities and the agreed social space in which it is believed he should occupy, Hugo ensures that the very notion of the ‘real’ is subverted at source. This has profound implications in the context of future adaptations of Les Misérables, but does not necessarily mean they cannot accurately represent both authenticity to Hugo’s historical moment, or fidelity to the characters he has created. Where adaptations of Hugo’s novel could become unstuck is in the aesthetic choices they make. By referring to Thompson’s – as well as other historians’ – interpretations of the ‘real’ nineteenth-century there is a danger that adaptations will merely be representative of a nostalgic image of the past; authenticity to a preconceived notion, rather than the ‘reality’ of Hugo’s work, a work that it can be argued is not based on authenticity in the first instance. Attempts at fidelity to Hugo’s original ideas, as steeped in fiction as they are, could also be problematic. Fidelity to a subverted notion of the ‘real’ can only operate to its fullest extent if all stakeholders – producers, directors, script writers, audience – are fully conversant with the spirit of Hugo’s original script.\n\nNostalgic representations of the past: Aesthetic authenticity in Cameron Mackintosh’s 1985 stage musical Les Misérables\n\n“…the potential for treating the historical past as if it were a fictional narrative does undermine certain aspects of history as a lived experience.”[48]\n\nMark Llewellyn\n\nIn his erudite analysis of the aesthetic choices made by those adapting and appropriating nineteenth-century literature and culture, Mark Llewellyn rightly proposes that there is an ethical debate to be had every time a decision is made to reinterpret history for the benefit of a contemporary audience. Taken a stage further the re-ascribing of a historical novel, set in a specific, often well-known, historical space and overlaying it with conflicting interpretations of the past, in a contemporary musical theatre medium can be considered even more problematic. Are we to assess its authenticity as an interpretation of the historical novel or the ‘real’ history of the period? Who has the right to make ethical decisions about the appropriation of history? If, as Benjamin Poore suggests, “all reconstructions of the past are interested and motivated by our current history and situation,”[49] is the ‘authentic’ feeling that appears to be popular in modern theatre entirely dependent on the prevailing politics of the contemporary moment, undermining, as Llewellyn suggests, the importance of historical experience? In a theatre audience dominated by “Middle England”[50] – a hypotheses that may well be truer of the 1980s than the current West End market that it can be argued is heavily influenced by foreign tourism – will the nuances of a historical narrative change with the intended target audience? When considering Cameron Mackintosh’s popular musical stage adaptation of Les Misérables, first performed in the West End in 1985, in the realm of authenticity, it is important to discuss not only the aesthetic nature of any interpretive quest for the authentic – its reliance on the source material for the “spirit and word of the story”[51] – but the Thatcherite setting into which the production was first released.\n\n1980s Great Britain was considered by some left-wing critics to be a period of “nostalgic, elegiac, class-bound…decline,”[52] as well as a time of “conscious pursuit of the political objective of isolating and ghettoising the underclass.”[53] By others of a more Conservative persuasion the period was seen as an era when Britain was returned to its former glory as a “flourishing island power.”[54] Les Misérables was first performed to a London audience amidst this divisive political backdrop. With tensions high following a series of riots in the early 1980s, as well as the prolonged miner’s strike that ended earlier that year, the stage appeared set and the time right for a revolutionary narrative of rebellion. As Laurence Porter writes, admittedly in 2005, the “moral, social, and political messages” within Victor Hugo’s novel “remain pertinent to many of the situations we confront” today.[55] Although it must be noted that any perspective on the stage show can only be given from a contemporary standpoint – having not experienced it in the 1980s – the conclusion of the show suggests that the collaboration that was responsible for bringing it to the stage were well aware of the political and social space it occupied. Immediately prior to the curtain going up and after the culmination of the narrative, the entire cast, including those who have died, sing:\n\nEnsemble: Will you join in our crusade?\n\nWho will be strong and stand with me?\n\nSomewhere beyond the barricade\n\nIs there a world you long to see?[56]\n\nIn a less than subtle instant the show is suddenly being performed to the audience rather than for them; we are no longer following the narrative of the story but being asked to be part of it. With a dutiful clapping to the stirring revolutionary beat the audience are taken by the spirit of rebellion and, it could be argued, become rebels themselves. There is a sense of contradictory authenticity in the representation of rebellion at this juncture. The “Middle-England”[57] audience that Graham Ley suggests dominate theatre participation can be considered a reflection of the “friends of the ABC” rebels, themselves a group of largely middle-class students; the middle-class audience become middle-class rebels. Even in the context of an authentic political representation of Margaret Thatcher’s premiership and the social mood of the 1980s – a legitimate source material for 1980s left-leaning theatre according to critics such as Poore and left-wing playwright David Edgar[58] – there is an uncomfortable and problematic sense of the trivial; the clap-a-sing-a-long becomes symptomatic of a “Middle-England” that only sees the plight of the poor and lower classes in the context of entertainment. When the audience participatory role goes beyond the passive and into the active in such a situation, any sense of political narrative authenticity can become far-fetched.\n\nLinda Hutcheon is unambiguous in her determination that “an adaptation can obviously be used to engage in a larger social or cultural critique.”[59] With this in mind a significant aesthetic decision made by the producers of the stage show was to encapsulate the spirit of rebellion in a substantial physical construction; a piece of set structure that is firmly established in musical theatre dialect as “the barricade.” Miranda Lundskaer-Nielsen suggests that the creation of visually spectacular sets – such as the barricade – influenced a common critical view that the most popular approach to musical theatre in the 1980s tended to prioritise “technical spectacles” over “dramaturgy, music, staging, and performance.”[60] Lundskaer-Nielsen refutes this theory, commenting that the “characterization of them as mere spectacles is often misleading and reductive.”[61] Citing conflicting critical debates regarding the Broadway production of the show, the most striking, if somewhat class-based, response is from Bernard Levin who suggests that the decision to reinvent the technically spectacular musical in this way was an entirely “commercial rather than artistically driven phenomenon.”[62] Put another way, it is the audiences’ demand for the spectacle that is the overriding influence on any narrative authenticity that it might have. The barricade is less a physical manifestation of an interpretation of Hugo’s original novel – and as such an attempt to “engage in a larger social and cultural critique” – and more a manifestation of audiences’ desire for the spectacle as consumers of the musical theatre genre.\n\nAs Lundskaer-Nielsen suggests, however, this focus on the spectacle of the barricade can be considered “reductive.” In many ways the barricade as a construction is at the heart of the story and as such a physical representation of it can enhance the narrative in ways that its absence may not. In isolation it may be considered, as Levin has previously agonised over, a “commercially driven”, consumer-led phenomenon dictated to by an increasingly middle-class audience with a craving for the spectacular. Theatre consumers are, however, parting with considerable sums of money; to consider Les Misérables merely in the context of a spectacle is not only reductive to the show’s narrative presence, but also to the audiences that watch them. Whether considering the show as representative of Hugo’s novel, or a sense of nineteenth-century France that is indicative of historical theory, a physical representation of the barricade is essential in the stage show’s quest for an authentic demonstration of the space that the rebels must occupy as a symbol of their struggle with the State. In a similar way to the effect that space has on Valjean’s identity, the barricade as a physical space defines the rebels and their struggle with the Parisian authorities. The group psychology of the rebels would be significantly altered if “the barricade” was removed.\n\nIf Thompson is correct in her assertion of social spatial juxtapositions then in order for Les Misérables to portray a sense of authenticity the barricade cannot be an isolated motif within the stage show. At the commencement of “In my life,” as Cosette and Marius are acquainted for the first time, there is an interesting, as well as subtle use of a simple gate that initially separates the two young lovers. A clear segregation of the middle-class space that Cosette occupies and the middle-class space that Marius has rejected, the gate operates at the same level as the barricade: a signifier of social rank and status. Whilst the poorer social space of the barricade and the Café Musain are easily traversed by Valjean and Cosette, Marius must climb the gate and penetrate Cosette’s physical space in order for the narrative of the two lovers to progress. More importantly, in the context of authenticity, the barricade is as much a part of the narrative as the gate is. At a time of increased demand for heritage culture – nostalgic cultural representations of the past that critics such as Robert Hewison consider merely as “fantasies of a world that never was”[63] – it is easy to dismiss the barricade as representative of a “distortion of the past, [as well as a] stifling of the culture of the present.”[64] The barricade and the gate are, however, interesting representations of how “…socioeconomic power shaped the urban space”[65] in nineteenth-century Paris and as such can be considered with a greater level of authenticity than some critics may allow.\n\nCiting the tense social and political period of the 1980s in his scathing attack on the heritage industry, Hewison suggests that “…it is not surprising that the past seems a better place,”[66] yet paradoxically “…the times for which we feel nostalgia most keenly were often themselves periods of disturbance.”[67] Hewison articulates an important point: if, in “hard times”[68] we are to seek entertainment via nostalgia, then why do we turn to adaptations of the bleakest literature and representations of poverty to do so? Benjamin Poore suggests that Dickensian adaptations on stage and screen in the 1980s became a “symbol of resistance”[69] against the Thatcher Government; this does, however become increasingly problematic when considered in the context of a theatre audience compared with a television one. One of the starkest portrayals in the Les Misérables stage show is the depiction of the poor at the commencement of the song “Look down.” As the beggars enter the stage from the rear, slumped down and never revealing their faces, they occupy the physical “shadowlands” of the stage. Framed by dull light and smoke it is a direct representation of the shadows that the poor occupy both in Hugo’s novel and in Thompson’s analysis of nineteenth-century Parisian space. As discussed in the previous chapter, this can be viewed as a ‘real’ interpretation of the most destitute characters in Hugo’s novel; it is not difficult to believe in their poverty, their position in society and their plight. If, as previously mentioned however, nostalgia is to be viewed as a prevailing contemporary need for entertainment through appropriations of the past, what are the implications for authenticity? If nostalgia is to be considered as dependent on ‘un-real’ interpretations of the past, then the very quest for authenticity to either Hugo’s original text, or Thompson’s historical analysis, under the banner of nostalgic heritage culture, becomes impossible. Considered on its own merits, however, the stage adaptation can, on other levels, be considered an authentic adaptation.\n\nIn his seminal poststructuralist work Simulacra and Simulation Jean Baudrillard proposes that:\n\nWhen the real is no longer what it was, nostalgia assumes its full meaning. There is a plethora of myths of origin and signs of reality – a plethora of truth, of secondary objectivity, and authenticity.[70]\n\nThe parameters by which authenticity is assessed are not easily defined. When a sense of nostalgia – a craving for a bygone age where the signs and signifiers are too not easily definable and reliant on “a plethora of truth” – takes its place the very notion of authenticity becomes problematic. Hewison discusses nostalgia as “profoundly conservative,”[71] suggesting that where nineteenth-century values are to be resurfaced and reinterpreted within the heritage industry the link between authenticity and the stage is always likely to remain fluid. Where the stage adaptation of Les Misérables does complicate notions of authenticity is that it is unsure of its authentic origins: whether they are firmly rooted in the social and political climate of the contemporary era; a quest for a replication of Hugo’s original work; or an aesthetic sense of the historic as suggested by historians such as Victoria Thompson. The myths surrounding the truth of Les Misérables’ origins, as well as the audience’s role as contemporary interpreters and historians, make the quest for authenticity in the stage show complex but not impossible. Consider the stage adaptation outside of the realm of nostalgia, and a sense of authenticity in its representations of the past become more evident. “The barricade” becomes historical and spectacular; the gate is representative of a barrier between Cosette and Marius, as well as a symbol of the prevailing social order in nineteenth-century France; and the shadows are both a staging device and a representation of the poorest nineteenth-century Parisian spaces. In the context of this musical adaptation of Hugo’s Les Misérables when nostalgia is no longer what it was, the ‘reality’ of Hugo’s original work can, and does, come centre stage.\n\n‘I dreamed a dream’: Emotional fidelity in Tom Hooper’s Les Misérables (2012)\n\nTom Hooper’s screen adaptation of Les Misérables is a film that can, like Mackintosh’s musical stage show, be categorised as belonging to the heritage genre of stage, television and cinematic adaptation of which academics such as Christian Gutleben and Robert Hewison are so critical. Whilst defending heritage film’s place as a “site where otherwise marginalised voices can be heard,”[72] Andrew Higson also associates heritage culture with a “middle class…conservative vision.”[73] Most damagingly, in respect of heritage film’s role in creating and telling narrative driven stories, Higson describes the genre as a “commodification of the past,”[74] suggesting, as was alluded to in the previous chapter regarding theatre target audiences, that the primary role of heritage cinema is to appropriate the past for financial gain and commercial success; an accusation that could easily be levelled at all aspects of art and culture, not merely the heritage genre. Whilst she also views heritage culture as being largely “ideologically complicit”[75] with Thatcherite Conservatism, as well as recognising the disparaging association “…rightly or wrongly – with middle-class, middlebrow, middle-aged and largely female audiences,”[76] Claire Monk is also acutely aware that heritage film is “dependent on the interpretive judgement of the viewer;”[77] an issue, as previously discussed, that is problematic in itself. What is implicit in much of this criticism of the genre in general, and Les Misérables in particular, is that the issue of fidelity in interpretive and adaptive cinema is a divisive one. As previously discussed in the first chapter Gutleben, in his sceptical analysis of the allure of Victorian – as well as, by implication, wider nineteenth-century – culture, suggests that “discourse has replaced the convention of psychological depth”[78] in contemporary adaptations of the past. There is a sense in what Gutleben is contending that much in the same way that adaptation in 1980s theatre was influenced by contemporary social and political issues, the tendency to attach historic literary, as well as literal, events to modern screen adaptation results in a conflation of ideas and discourse that irreparably complicates the notion of emotional and psychological depth. There is a narrative conflict within Hooper’s Les Misérables in the nature of the emotional portrayal of characters such as Valjean and Fantine to the seemingly frivolous and shallow interpretation of the Cosette/Eponine/Marius love triangle, that makes Hooper’s Les Misérables an ideal text in which to analyse whether “the urge to assess how ‘faithful’ the film version is to its original…becomes a negative yardstick with which to beat”[79] film adaptation as a whole, or whether the criticism levelled at the heritage genre by the likes of Gutleben and Higson is justified.\n\nIn a promotional interview with Tribute Movies prior to the release of Les Misérables Hooper appears to anticipate the criticism that is going to be levelled at the film when he suggests that “…communicat[ion] through [live recorded] song…might allow us to experience emotions in the cinema in an even stronger way.”[80] With the film not requiring studio voice recordings or miming – affording the actors the opportunity to both sing and act on screen simultaneously – the live sung dialogue can, along with other technical filming practices, add a sense of depth in character that can not only be faithful to a “memory”[81] of an original idea, but can also, in the case of Les Misérables, operate at a deeper level than its theatrical stage counterpart. As the horrific plight of Fantine in Hugo’s original novel culminates in her falling into prostitution as a means of supporting her young daughter, an emotionally charged narrator declares that “at the sad point which our tale has now reached there is nothing left of the girl that was once Fantine.”[82] The stage adaptation portrays this powerful moment when Fantine realises the desperation of her situation with the song “I dreamed a dream,” before she prostitutes herself to a naval officer to the rear of the stage out of the view of the audience:\n\nFantine: I dreamed a dream in times gone by\n\nWhen hope was high\n\nAnd life worth living\n\nI dreamed that love would never die\n\nI dreamed that God would be forgiving.[83]\n\nBenjamin Poore writes that “nineteenth-century melodrama elevated emotion.”[84] If this is to be considered the case then the power and emotion of “I dreamed a dream” captures this admirably. It can be argued that the film takes this emotion a stage further. In contrast to this scene on stage Fantine prostitutes herself to the naval officer before she projects her inner psychological pain in song and, crucially, she does it in a close-up shot of her face; at the point at which she expresses in song the lowest ebb of her life, there is an intimate physical manifestation on screen of her plight. The way in which Hooper approaches the screen adaptation not only allows for close-up shots of the emotion on Fantine’s face, but it is also possible to project various vocal ranges to suit the psychological moment that the character is portraying at that instant. By singing live on set, rather than dubbing studio recordings onto the film in post-production, the actors are given the opportunity to express vocal and facial emotions simultaneously, rather than the forced emotion of mime that other musical films have done in the past. Corinne Lhermitte, in her analysis of previous adaptations of Les Misérables, writes that it can often be the case that “scant attention is given to filmmakers’ innovative techniques.”[85] In the case of Hooper’s use of live sung dialogue on screen it is this “innovative technique” that adds to the emotional depth and the faithfulness to the angst that Fantine experiences in the novel, as well as the emotion that would be expected of someone in her situation.\n\nIt can be argued that by utilising innovative techniques within the cinematic medium, Hooper is successful in removing the “barrier of artificiality between the audience and […his] characters,”[86] ensuring that there really is “nothing left of the girl that was once Fantine.”[87] Moreover, through Anne Hathaway’s emotional performance of Fantine the film distances itself from Gutleben’s views on “psychological depth.” It challenges accusations of complete fidelity to the stage adaptation, whilst at the same time projecting an air of faithfulness to Hugo’s original work. However, this still remains problematic: there is a conflation in priorities at play between a need to be dependent on the original source – and as such faithful to the “spirit and word”[88] of the novel – yet independent of the source of the musical text. From the outset of her analysis of adaptation in contemporary culture Rachel Carroll suggests that “all adaptations express or address a desire to return to an ‘original’ textual encounter.”[89] This is undoubtedly true; Graham Ley implies in his work on theatrical adaptation that all artistic production is in some way adaptive – and as such derivative – of pre-existing primary material.[90] Les Misérables complicates this notion in that it is often difficult to appreciate or locate its original source. Whilst it is possible, as discussed here, to trace the foundations of Hooper’s interpretation of Fantine’s character back to Hugo’s creation, Valjean, as was suggested in the first chapter, is not a character who lends himself to adaptation.\n\nThere is a conflict at play in Valjean’s identity that hinders any quest for a faithful adaptation of his character. By subverting notions of normative gender representations in developing a character that is at once demonstrative of the “masculine ideal,” yet at the same time steeped in a sense of “feminine…compassion and maternity,”[91] Hugo created a character steeped in depth, but also in contradictions. An interesting point in the novel which to analyse the many future interpretations is when Valjean reveals that he is a prisoner that has broken parole, giving himself up to return to prison, declaring to Inspector Javert: “‘I am at your service.”[92] It is important to note that although Valjean is submissive to Javert at this stage, he also refuses to give himself up until he has cared for Fantine in the final stages of her life; two examples of the seemingly “feminine” role in which Valjean is deemed to at times perform. Whilst both the stage and screen productions that we have concentrated on in this analysis maintain the benevolent and caring side of Valjean’s psychology as he cares for Fantine on her death bed, the varied interpretations of Valjean’s subservience to Javert are of interest. This scene is portrayed in both the stage and screen productions during the “The confrontation;” a point at which both depict a fight between Valjean and Javert, an event that never manifests itself in the novel, despite some hostile rhetoric from Valjean as he arms himself with a metal cudgel: “‘I would advise you not to interfere with me at this moment.’”[93] At this point in the stage adaptation Valjean attacks Javert with a chair as he sings, knocking him unconscious before escaping:\n\nValjean: I am warning you Javert\n\nThere is nothing I won’t dare\n\nIf I have to kill you here\n\nI’ll do what must be done![94]\n\nAdding a violence to his strength that is a significant departure from the novel, this scene alters the benevolent side of his character irreparably. The same scene in the screen production interestingly departs from both its musical source text and the original novel with somewhat surprising results in terms of its seeming faithfulness to both. Omitting the part of the song detailed above from the libretto, the film makes a conscious decision to distance itself from the characterisation of Valjean as an uncontrollably violent character, as highlighted in this passage in the novel. There is, however, still a fight between the two, this time resulting in Valjean fleeing out of a window. Whilst this can be considered as a departure from both the stage show and the original novel – it is not, after all, a direct representation of either – it could also be argued that it is an example of how adaptive work can be “simultaneously derivative and generative,”[95] whilst still maintaining a faithful relationship with the “spirit” of the original. Whilst this scene does represent an aesthetic choice that deviates from the novel, it also maintains faithfulness to the original competing and conflicting natures within Valjean’s character – the benevolence he demonstrates for Fantine against his seemingly self-centred desire to escape from authority – something that it can be argued the stage show fails to do. It is to the “spirit and word” of Hugo’s work in which the film reflects its faithfulness, rather than a complete physical recreation.\n\nIn his analysis of Les Misérables as one of the great national novels Laurence Porter suggests that “Eponine comes to watch Marius die, to ensure that Cosette won’t have him.”[96] Whilst this can be viewed as a shallow interpretation of Eponine’s intentions at the barricade, it also offers an emotionally charged perspective of the love triangle between Cosette, Eponine and Marius. It is reflective of the deep love obsession between Marius and Cosette that culminates in the marriage proposal in Hugo’s original text. As the narrator suggests of Marius’ feelings towards Cosette: “this vision wholly occupied the mind of Marius, so that he could think of nothing else.”[97] Whereas Hugo develops the relationship between Cosette and Marius, as well as Eponine’s solitary obsession with Marius over a period of time, the film, by necessity it could be argued, is fickle in its interpretation of these relationships. When Marius offers Eponine money to find out where Cosette lives at the conclusion of “The robbery” and “Javert’s intervention” there is a sense, as an audience, that it is difficult to believe in his immediate obsession. Whilst Eponine’s line “I don’t want your money, Sir”[98] is a rare instance of text taken directly from Hugo’s novel, it is not apparent on screen that the money that he offers her is all he has to feed himself for a week; there is a sense of “psychological depth” lacking in Marius’ character throughout that not only deviates from the novel but, more importantly, undermines other areas of the film where strength of characterisation is more prominent. There is a sense that by depicting a love story with such little depth, as well as a character in Marius that would so quickly lose interest in the revolution for the love of a girl he has just met, the film risks not only losing sight of its source text – whatever that might be – but also playing into the hands of critics who believe that heritage cinema “…reproduc[es] only the seductive surface”[99] of the past.\n\nConsidering the film adaptation of Les Misérables in terms of its fidelity to its original source is problematic. What, after all, is its source text? Les Misérables takes its name from the Hugo novel, but its dialogue from the libretto of the stage adaptation. With questionable levels of ‘real’ and ‘reality’ at play in the novel and debated notions of ‘authenticity’ in the stage show, the very concept of fidelity in the film adaptation is always going to be fluid when taking its source material from them both. Critics such as Cairns Craig view the source of all heritage films as coming from within their own “audience’s expectations”[100] of a firmly established generic order, whilst others, such as Lhermitte, are more open to the contention that “…it would be more fruitful to view them as hybrid products containing traces of a source text.”[101] Hooper’s film adaptation addresses both of these critical opinions. Where the film and notions of fidelity are at their most strained is in its place amongst this panoply of “hybrid products.” Craig also suggests that the casting of the same acting alumni in heritage cinema breeds a level of “incestuousness”[102] that undermines any sense of originality that there may be. Citing Helena Bonham-Carter – famous for her roles in 1980s Ivory-Merchant productions such as A Room With a View[103] – Craig implies that the very notion of a conflict between originality and fidelity is flawed, as heritage cinema can only ever be true to its generic rules and expectations. Whilst, ironically, Bonham-Carter does play a part in this screen adaptation – following up her role in another recent generic film, Great Expectations[104] – it can be argued that the use of innovative live sung dialogue sets her role apart from previous ones and allows for an interpretation and analysis of Les Misérables on its own terms. Additionally, whilst the love triangle between Cosette, Eponine and Marius does appear frivolous and lacking the depth that is apparent in Hugo’s original, Anne Hathaway’s emotional performance of Fantine and the way in which the film demonstrates Valjean’s multi-faceted character, can be considered faithful to the novel. The film demonstrates enough independence from the generic heritage industry to be viewed, on its own terms, as a faithful representation of the “spirit” of Hugo’s original text.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhere the screen adaptation of Les Misérables complicates matters of fidelity is not in its relationship with its two primary sources – the novel and the stage show – but its relationship with the heritage genre that many consider it belongs to. Poore highlights the need to consider whether the quest for “hyperauthentic and hyperfidelity[105] in the screen adaptation industry as a whole actually results in productions attempting to “trump each other for verisimilitude just as much as they try to trump the source text.”[106] In the case of these cinematic and theatrical musical adaptations of Les Misérables, it can be argued that there is a definite desire to reflect the “spirit” of the original novel. If there are attempts to compete with each other for a sense of verisimilitude, it would seem to be in relation to the original source text, rather than the heritage genre as a whole. Andrew Higson argues that heritage culture is reliant on “individual images for their display of authentic period detail, rather than for narrative symbolism.”[107] This is, however, too dichotomised a notion in relation to the culture and politics of adaptation. There is an implication that a “period” motif can be either faithful to a cinematic or theatrical genre, or faithful to an original source; it does not allow for authentic representations of the past, faithful identification to multiple sources and influences, or indeed credit as an original source in its own right. When considering aesthetic themes such as the barricade, the gate and the shadowlands of the Parisian underclasses – all motifs that are consistent with both Hugo’s novel and historical notions of social space – Higson would appear too hasty in his summation that individual images cannot display ‘authentic’ period detail as well as narrative symbolism.\n\nThe carriage is one of these motifs, drawn upon in the screen adaptation to reflect social status. As Madame and Monsieur Thénardier arrive at Marius and Cosette’s wedding at the commencement of “The wedding chorale,” they are seen to enter the carriage of an aristocratic couple on the left hand side, emerging out of the right hand side as the Baron and Baroness de Thenard. Entering the carriage as the common Thénardiers, they transform in the carriage and exit it as nobility. Victoria Thompson suggests that the carriage was a symbol of nobility in nineteenth-century France, reflecting that “…while the common people travelled on foot, the aristocracy travelled in carriages.”[108] This too is reflected in Hugo’s text when he describes carriages as “important vehicles bearing the quarterings of peers of France.”[109] The stage adaptation makes the aesthetic decision, amongst others, not to include the carriage. Does, as Higson insinuates, the stage show acquire more narrative symbolism in its decision not to include the period details of the carriage? It is unlikely. The use of the carriage in the screen adaptation is both faithful to the historical representations of social status and space in nineteenth-century Paris, as well as Hugo’s original.\n\nThere is, to a certain extent, a confliction in priorities in the notion of authentic representations of the past, as well as the concept of fidelity in both adaptations; fidelity to what exactly? The stage show takes its roots from the original text, whereas the film takes its script from the stage show, but has a clear relationship with the novel. A quest for an authentic association with the original novel, however, is not straightforward. Hugo’s original novel problematises concepts of ‘reality’ and the ‘real;’ something that critics such as Baudrillard, Poore and Higson would appropriately suggest leads to the nostalgic terms that heritage cinema is perceived by some to depend on. The very fact, however, that “writers on the subject often come from literary criticism”[110] should not lead to the privileging of the literary over the theatrical and cinematic. Both the stage and screen musicals should be considered on their own terms as both generative pieces of work in their own right, as well as adaptations that privilege characters and social critiques created by a literary author. The use of the carriage in the film is indicative of the astute way in which the stage show and film made aesthetic decisions with regards authentic interpretations of both Hugo’s novel and what has been written about nineteenth-century France. Through an exploration of the “plethora of myths of origin and signs of reality”[111] surrounding Hugo’s original text, both Mackintosh and Hooper have created their own works that not only stand up to scrutiny against a backdrop of criticism regarding their status as generic heritage culture, but allow for an analysis of both as generative works in their own right. Ironically, it is the adherence to the very ‘un-reality’ of Hugo’s original novel that also allows for a sense of authenticity and faithfulness to it in both.\n\nBibliography\n\nPrimary Sources\n\nHugo, Victor.
