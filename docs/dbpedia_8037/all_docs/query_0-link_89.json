        "text": "“The approach of DESCHONECOMPANIE is recognizable, but still works wonderfully: with a lot of respect, but also with a large dose of anarchy, they strip the opera genre of its formal clichés, to arrive at a fresh and hilarious marriage between Italian singing and Dutch texts, in a refined and moody illuminated wooden décor.”\n\nFilip Tielens - De Standaard ****- 04.08.2921\n\n“Inventive theatre that shows a great love for opera. ... Tom Goossens slides a very inventive Dutch translation between the sung phrases, with virtuoso rhyme. ... Wouter Deltour accompanies on the piano, often ironic, elegant and virtuoso. He testifies to a great musicality and a sense of theatre. ... The cast brings in a brilliant way the delicious lyrics of Goossens. ... In this way, Goossens and Deltour once again succeed in making well-known operas accessible in a playful yet respectful way.”\n\nJohan Tielemans - Pzazz - 05.08.2021\n\n“Another feather to the hat of director Tom Goossens and musical director Wouter Deltour but also praise for Cie Marius who took care of the text adaptation and translation of the original play. ... The performance is funny and catchy for an audience of non-opera connoisseurs and for the opera connoisseurs present it is a delicious persiflage.”\n\nSylvia Broeckaert - Klara Blijf verwonderd! – 07.08.2021\n\n“A refined whodunit with depth, where you are especially impressed and pleased by the way the story is sung and told ... Humour and tragedy merge into each other in a flashy way. Stefaan Degand is a crack of an actor, who can switch from one emotion to another ... Esther Kouwenhoven radiates a warmth in her singing art that moves and stays with her ... A wonderful evening of opera.”\n\nTuur Devens - Theaterkrant - 12.08.2021"
