        "text": "VÃ­ctor Hugo RascÃ³n Banda was born in 1948 in UruÃ¡chic.\n\nIn 1979 he wrote his first play Voces en el umbral (Voices on the Threshold), an innovative text that recreates the life of two women, one of them a German and the other a Tarahumara. Los ilegales (The Illegal), the first of his plays on stage, was the beginning of a career marked by popular acclaim, as well as recognition from critics and the academic world. For his plays, VÃ­ctor Hugo has been awarded several national and international prizes: RamÃ³n LÃ³pez Velarde (1979), Teatro Nuestra AmÃ©rica (1981), Juan Ruiz de AlarcÃ³n (1993) y Rodolfo Usigli (1993). Recently, he received the âXavier Villaurrutiaâ medal, an award given by the artistic community of his country, through the National Institute of Fine Arts and the National Council for Culture and Arts, as recognition for his lifeâs work.\n\nPlays such as Contrabando (Contraband) (1991), La mujer que cayÃ³ del cielo (The Woman who Fell from the Sky) (1999), SazÃ³n de mujer (Woman Seasoning) (2001) or Apaches (Apaches) (2003) access subterranean worlds, both tragic and passionate, inhabited by beings who stare us down and denounce injustice, pain, desire and social marginality.\n\nHis dramatic work is one of the most produced and published in Mexico. Some of the national theater prizes bear his name: Monologue Dramatic Composition in Quintana Roo; One Person Theater Contest in Quintana Roo, and Playwrighting Prize in Nuevo LeÃ³n.\n\nHe has also written several screenplays, such as: DÃ­as difÃ­ciles (Hard Days), Morir en el Golfo (Dying at the Gulf), Playa azul (Blue Beach), JÃ³venes delincuentes (Young Delinquents), La muerte del Padre Pro (The Death of Priest Pro) and Rosa de California (Rose of California).\n\nHe is the President of the writers of Mexico, Counsultant Council of the Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes, Treasurer of the Academia de Artes y Ciencias CinematogrÃ¡ficas, President of the Authors Societies, and Vice-president of the International Confederation of Authors and Composers Societies."
