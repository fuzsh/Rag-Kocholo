        "text": "I remind the reader that the four parts of this essay are the result of a drastic selection meant to address the most representative characteristics of each genre (in this sense, radio is not an exception). This is mainly due to lack of space, but also to allow the reader to keep memory of what he/she reads and to focus on the most important facts. With regard to Les MisÃ©rables on radio, our survey starts in 1925 with a BBC production, the first one of which I have clear traces. Following productions are a little bit less than ten, all by BBC (1939, 1944, 1976 and 2001; I will come back on the latter at the end of this chapter). Thus, Great Britain seems to have the lead, as the musical productions by Cameron Mackintosh (see Part IV) in 1985 demonstrates. Also France does not fall too much behind, but its radio productions are as diverse as to even include a sort of conference. In fact, in 1953, AndrÃ© Maurois dedicated 10 programs to Hugo and the characters of his book. Claude Santelliâs version from 1961 to 1968 follows. It featured such actors as Michel Galabru, Victor Lanoux and Claude Rich interpreting the parts of the novel dedicated to Cosette, Gavroche and Jean Valjean. Another French radio version is Jean Belloriniâs adaptation of Book IV performed in 2013 by the acting company Air de Lune. In 2010, though, the same playwright, along with Camille De la GuilloniÃ¨re, had already made an adaptation for seven actors and two musicians of the part of the novel titled TempÃªte sous un crÃ¢ne. France, as will be explained further on, occupies the first place as to the quality of its radio productions.\n\nIn order to prove what I have just said and despite what historical data maintain (that there are many radio editions of Hugoâs novel), I will deal here mainly with the Orson Wellesâs version of 1937. This work marks Wellesâs transition from the Campbell Playhouse to The Mercury Theater on the Air broadcasted by the U.S. MBS (Mutual Broadcasting System). Despite being recent history, the vicissitudes behind this production are not completely clear. In fact, many U.S. sources do not ascribe the adaptation of Les MisÃ©rables to a specific company, which is quite odd. Moreover, the CBS (Columbia Broadcasting System) seems involved in the production since the very beginning (pictures of the setting confirm it), but some sources reports the presence of the MBS. At the end of my research I could assess that reality was somewhat different. Les MisÃ©rables, that MBS wanted to produce, was such a big success that the repertoire of the recently born The Mercury Theater on the Air was quickly spread throughout the United States. At the same time, CBS commissioned Welles to prepare several radio shows of increasing magnitude.25 These objective data could explain, at least to some extent, the coexistence of MBS and CBS in the same production: the latter joined and, during the preparatory stage of the radio drama, eventually replaced the former.\n\nThe famous program The War of the Worlds by Orson Welles, sponsored by Campbellâs Soup â featured also in a recent episode of The Simpsons Cartoon â was broadcasted on October 30, 1938. It had two main effects: making Welles famous all over the world and putting many U.S. citizensâ nerves through the mill. It also generated a large amount of bibliographical material that demonstrates how relevant that event was. In fact, I agree with who says that The War of the Worlds, to which I pay my tribute, marked the entrance of media in the adult age. But let us go back to Les MisÃ©rables. Welles chose Hugoâs work to start a new series of theater On the Air. The whole program lasted 2 hours and 28 minutes and was divided into 7 half-an-hour parts â in fact thirty minutes was believed to be the longest span of time a listener could keep his attention focused on the same program. Among Wellesâs works with The Mercury Theater, Les MisÃ©rables was the only subject that got divided into several episodes. It is not clear to me whether this was an isolated experiment meant to be repeated, or whether the overall plan was to reduce every program to one episode â as it actually happened â and grant Hugoâs work a special treatment, partly justified by the extent of the novel.\n\nHowever, the texts available for consultation at that time did not concern that bridge. Despite being of high interest for any radio enthusiast, information was reduced to mere technical explanations, some of which are still valid at present. Other sources were only useful to gather the necessary documentation for the writing of a manual about history of technologies. Nevertheless, I am convinced that a radio amateur should go first of all through a simple textbook in electrical engineering.28 Then, he/she should move to the physical principles behind a transmitter and a receiver (those same principles that linguistics first, and information theory and semiotics later, frequently employed for analytical reasons). In addition to the waveform â band, frequency and wavelength â that the receiver picks up from the transmitter,29 it would also be mandatory to study the oscillator, the modulator, the amplifier and the antenna of a transmitter as well as the homodyne, the heterodyne and the super-heterodyne of the receiver. Thanks to the Multiplex System, such a technology eventually evolved into stereophony (from 1977). Television also used the same bandwidth as radio â from short to long waves â and quickly became the most pervasive communication medium.\n\nThis is why radio is a medium of particular importance, the first of its kind. With its technical-conceptual simplicity radio does not alter the relationship between transmitter and receiver and does not interfere with the message (or, at least, it does so to a lesser extent than other media). Human voiceâs vibes and speakerâs sounds captivate the radio listener in such an intense way that other âmore completeâ media can only dream of. In fact, a message transmitted with other media does not convey very often its essence as radio does. Radio involves only one sense: the hearing. Heart and brain catch signals from one sole source. Also for this reason I speak about the radio experience as âpurityâ and âessence.â What we hear daily as ânormalâ sounds augments its presence through radio reception and words eventually catch our attention. It is as though the voice coming out of the speaker is able to drag us to the source of what it is saying. However, it is not just a matter of loudness. In fact, we can ecstatically listen to a music we know very well and we already possess on CD or LP because it sounds somehow âdifferent.â This happens also when we listen to a well-known interpretation: that music seems to be as precious as an unexpected present that we are gifted enough to appreciate.\n\nCinema underwent many more substantial changes than radio. I have already mentioned above about the passage from individual to collective consumption. After having become a collective show, the âsilent artâ turned into a âsound artâ that many artists and intellectuals disesteemed (e.g. Charlie Chaplin, RenÃ© Clair, BÃ©la BalÃ¡zs, Rudolph Arnheim, etc.). However, the new situation was not an âabstractâ problem, just food for intellectuals â or for solitary intellectuals36 â in fact many cinema actors committed suicide because they could not afford acting for an audience with their own voice. The change from black-and-white to color was not received so tragically but, still, did not please everybody: several cinema masters, from Ingmar Bergman to David Lynch, kept using black-and-white. Cinemascope, anamorphic lenses, 70mm (instead of the âclassicalâ 35mm), the consequent change from the 4:3 screen format to the other more âspectacularâ sizes (16:9, 1.85:1, 2.40:1, etc.), Dolby System, Dolby Digital 5+1 and DTS norms, all measures suitable for placing the viewer in an immersive, mobile acoustic dimension similar to the one produced by the images, frequently changed the essence of cinema both for the director (e.g. the help offered by computer graphics) and the spectator (let us not even speak, for the sake of cinema, about the unfortunate return of 3D). Instead, radio highly benefitted from technical improvements (again, the implementation of frequency modulation and stereophony) that did not alter its essence, since, in any case, there is always someone speaking and someone listening. The former can either alternate his/her voice with a voice at the telephone37 or be the only voice speaking. In both ways the essence of radio does not change, and for this same reason radio has always been true to itself.\n\nNow it is time for some personal confessions. Since I was a boy up to my late adolescence, I took pleasure in listening to radio theater and lyric operas. In both, but especially in the former, vocal vibes widened my inner self and filled the space around me: a gradual increase in the tone of the voice had an effect similar to the passage from a long shot to a close-up in cinema. Also, an unintelligible murmuring could become important because of its signifier. This would apply to non-vocal sounds as well: an approaching tapper, the wind hissing, a window slamming, the irregular ticking of raindropsâ¦ All of them were interesting sound events that yielded concrete emotions: fear, excitement, tensionâ¦ Everything was as âauthenticâ as it were heard from the real source. Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne (Vingt mille lieues sous les mers, 1870), Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson (1883), Mother Courage by Bertolt Brecht (Mutter Courage und ihre Kinder, 1939, interpreted around thirty years after it was written by Lina Volonghi featuring Anna Fierling under the direction of Luigi Squarzina), and La fidanzata del bersagliere by Edoardo Anton39 (1963)40 were among my favorite friends for at least fifteen years between 1954 and 1969.\n\nThe understanding of the artistic possibilities radio can offer and the expressive balance Welles achieved in its reduction of the very long novel is remarkable. Therefore, no serious losses are felt, even if one knows Hugoâs work very well. This means that radio had reached at that point a dramaturgical autonomy. For example, in the first part Valjean, after having served his sentence, receives a lot of wasted food at his request for a meal and a place where to sleep. Here, the director makes a step back to when Valjean, while repeating his own name, listens to and comment about both his first sentence to prison and the other sentences that came after each attempt to escape from jail. There is no need for many explanations; it is what in cinema is called a flashback, that is, the same solution Welles applied twelve years later to build the whole narrative structure of Citizen Kane. (Note that by doing so, Welles was able to impregnate the flashback technique with unexpected aesthetic values.42) In Wellesâs Les MisÃ©rables the voices from the past overlap with the voices of the present, so that a very effective allusion to the two-faced personality of the main character is realized. Valjeanâs voice splits into âbeforeâ and âafterâ, which is just an illusion since both time dimensions belong to the same person.\n\nAnother directorial feature is found in the use of noises that often get in very loud, notably in the most dramatic moments. This happens, for example, in the second part when Monsieur Madeleine (Jean Valjean), who is now mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer, strenuously lifts a cart that is squashing a peasant. The scene takes place under the eyes of the inspector Javert who has not recognized Valjean yet, but, since he remembers the exceptional strength of prisoner â24601,â starts feeling suspicious. After loud and excited interjections, all the voices stop shouting and for a few seconds one can hear only the creaking of the wood. Although weak, this sound fills in oneâs entire perceptive space and is sufficient to give him/her the sense of both the protagonistâs exhausting effort and the inevitable revelation to the inspector of Valjeanâs real identity. As early as 1937, about fifty years before the appearance of acoustic engineers and sound designers, Welles had already well understood that ânoises,â both in cinema and radio were as important as music. In fact, they could even be the acoustic protagonists of a scene.\n\nWith regard to the music, after having dreamed for years about prestigious collaborations between Welles and the composer (the pictures from the 1940s in my possession seemed to confirm my illusions), I have to say that whoever he was his musical commentary is not particularly original. I do not even know for sure, despite my thorough investigation, who he was. Perhaps, the orchestra conductor Frank de Vol, but it could also be one of those minor musicians who were and did nothing to be anything but anonymous, mostly in the case of a radio drama. In Wellesâs Les MisÃ©rables there are between two and four original pieces for each episode â or for an important passage â all of them in the symphonic style of the XIX century. A more precise stylistic definition would refer to the early Hollywood âschoolâ that was still influenced by silent filmsâ music: Ãrno RapÃ©e, John S. Zamecnik, Samuel L. Rothapfel, Carl Breil, Louis F. Gottschalk, Hugo Riesenfeld, David Mendoza, William Axt and many others. These were the models who enriched radio and cinema stories with an average but well-crafted music.\n\n43 The first formulation of the theory of levels dates back to the end of the 70s. In synthesis, this is what I mean by âlevels.â Internal level (diegetic) indicates musical events belonging to the scene of the movie. The musical source is in display or its vision can be legitimately imagined. Sometimes it corresponds to playback. It shows no artistic intentions from part of the author. External level (non-diegetic): undetermined musical source; indexing function; ubiquity; it can be the typical accompaniment/commentary, even with a leitmotivic function. When it reaches the limits of expressive neutrality, it can be a generic background. Normally it reveals the authorâs artistic intentions. Mediated level (metadiegetic): internalized musical source, which can be identified with memory, the emotions of a character, or any kind of subjective sonic mimesis, a sort of acoustic âpoint-of-viewâ shot. It can acquire any function from the other levels, especially the leitmotivic function. It does not reveal the artistic intentions of the author.

Anderson, with the assistance of Lidia Bagnoli, Music and the Moving Image 4/2 (2011), 1-29; Id.

(Auto)biografia di un modello analitico,â in Roberto Giuliani e Renata Scognamiglio (ed.), \"Su la testa!\" Musiche e saggi per i 70 anni di Sergio Miceli (Lucca: LIM, forthcoming).\n\n44 In the same year as Wellesâs Les MisÃ©rables (1937), fascist cinema produced in Italy several propagandistic films. One of them was Scipione lâafricano (dir. Carmine Gallone, music Ildebrando Pizzetti). Every choir piece at a clear or presumed internal level was sung by professional singers.\n\n49 Here is the previously announced bibliographic note on radio. While perusing a quite comprehensive catalogue on multimedia publications from 1971 to 2015 (by The MIT Press), what struck me most was that there were no publications about radio. Even in the homepage of a far poorer website as Quelli della radio is (last accessed October 2015), there is a link to the pictures of the fair âLa Radio, il Suonoâ (the eighth edition was celebrated on March 7 and 8, 2015). Anyway, following my personal judgment, I selected a group of texts to be consulted for the present research: M. E. Becchis, Chiacchierando di Radiofonia (Turin: Stab. Generali Aversano, 1929); Proceedings of the âI Convegno Internazionale di musicaâ (Florence: Le Monnier 1933) with papers by Aban Berg, Darius Milhaud and Alfredo Casella, among others (papers specifically on radio were: Adriano Lualdi, âDue nuove vie per la musica: Radio e film sonoroâ; AndrÃ© Coeuroy, âProblÃ¨mes intÃ©rieurs et extÃ©rieurs de la radioâ; and R.

Finally, here are two very important websites I often consulted: Radiomusuem (last accessed October, 2015) that has, among other things, 683582 detailed records on radio equipment and a complete translation of the site in English, German, Spanish, French and Italian; and also Le Radio di Sophie (last accessed September-October 2015) that has, among many other things, a free download area with a number of brochures and some rare books (the administrators very politely ask for a small donation). Source for some of the listed texts: Archive S. M., Florence.\n\nThe French psychoanalyst and philosopher Jacques Lacan, author of Radiophonie, is a different matter. Although his contribution on the subject is very famous, it might be useful to provide some information about it. Lacanâs assessment is the answer to one of seven questions Robert Georgin asked him. They were then released in three versions. I have already commented on the first. The second was recorded by TRBF (Belgium) and broadcasted on June 5, 1970 (France Culture would do the same later on). Now it is freely available at http://radiolacan.com/fr/topic/29/2. The third version was printed in Scilicet 2/3 (Paris: Seuil, 1970) Lacanâs modifications to the three versions of the interview were studied by Patrick Valas in Help transcription!. An illustrated version of the interview is found at http://staferla.free.fr/Lacan/Radiophonie.pdf. The third version has also been translated in English by J. W. Stone. After such a well-deserved examination of the sources, I must conclude, though, that the interviewâs title might mislead the reader. In fact, the text is actually a typically philosophical presentation â from Plato to Jakobson, from Saussure to LÃ©vy-Strauss â that never really focuses on ânormalâ phenomena concerning radio. Some believe that, in the end, a philosophical dissertation works with anything. However, confusing this precious collection of Lacanâs thoughts with an argumentation about radio would be very reductive.\n\nAll websites last accessed May-June 2015. Source: Archive S.

This radio adaptation tried to account for this powerful and incredibly lively language by making it hear, literally, because history has almost obliterated the uniqueness of the voice that speaks it. We recognize the plot, the mythical characters, the revolutionary Paris, but we lost what is written. It's hard to express, but that's what one discovers while getting engulfed in the book. It is as if one finger touched the fibers of our heritage in all that is best for and in what it can make us better. Victor Hugo loves telling stories and he makes us love it. / Therefore, the concept of this adaptation for the radio was to make his voice heard. [â¦]â [ET]\n\nEven the voices of the actors are as one would image them to be, which means that they have been carefully and wisely selected. The most remarkable are: the voice of Monseigneur Myriel that the narrator lets speak during the crucial meeting with Napoleon; the dark and deep voice of Jean Valjean that, possibly intentionally, recalls the tone of Harry Baur in the 1934 Raymond Bernardâs and Arthur Honeggerâs masterwork (see Chap. 3.1); and the unforgettably quiet voice of Marius. Actually, all the actors seem to be very good. The program was on air in 2012, that is, two years before Tom Hooperâs musical film (see Part IV) came out. Since both adaptations made a similar selection of the episodes from the novel, one could wonder who inspired who. It is likely, though, that as they were created nearly at the same time, no reciprocal influence could occur. Yet, one feels that Hooper already knew the French radio version."
