        "text": "It is perfectly obvious that opera is a particular form of theater: a particular form, that is, of stage action. Not so obvious is how to identify the elements that generate drama in an opera: to precisely describe operatic dramaturgy. This is evidenced by the inconclusive debate that has recurred throughout the history of music (Di Benedetto 1988). This chapter relates to an epistemological study of the ways in which operatic dramaturgy has been analyzed; more specifically, to a comparison of two schools of thought. According to one of these, the drama stems from the verbal text; according to the other, it originates in the musical elements. To avoid any ambiguity, the phrase \" musical dramaturgy \" will be understood here in its etymological sense of the \" production (ἔργον) of theatrical action (δρᾶμα) through music. \" In that sense, musical dramaturgy is a sub-category of poetics. This definition is narrower than the generic \" study of opera \" seen in many university courses, but it covers more ground than theories of musical dramaturgy such as the one that Carl Dahlhaus strove to forge in the 1980s.\n\nThis thesis describes the process from composition to performance, with special emphasis on the composer's intentions and the communication of musical ideas to the performers, through a musical score of an opera. This is done by composing three scenes that use the same libretto, interpreting the libretto in three different ways. The research data was in the form of personal reflections, a questionnaire and a group discussion. I examined my own compositional process and the intentions I had in mind when writing the music, and compared them to the response given by the performers after playing through the music for the very first time. From there, I try to see where possible differences and agreements occur. The result was that my main ideas for the atmosphere and the connections between characters were clear, but the finer details, such as why things happen and where, were not always understood. I also look at the difference between the responses given by the instrumentalists, and the singers. The results show that while the singers got more of the bigger picture, the instrumentalists noticed some of the finer details in the music.\n\nThe dissertation „Cross-genre composition: encoding characters in the chamber opera I.th.Ak.A. with semiotic elements derived from commercial music genres“ employs methods of artistic research to create aesthetic and musicological foundations for analysing the compositional practice of the author, in reference to an opera composed specifically for the dissertation, I.th.Ak.A. (Premiere: 06.04.2018, Hamburg State Opera). Such a method is new to the German academic landscape, where artistic research in music had not yet penetrated into dissertation practices, however prevalent they may be in other arts or international musical artistic research. Central to the research is the term “Cross-genre”, used in the dissertation to describe a specific process of hybridity between the classical music tradition and commercial music genres. All thoughts and compositional follow the central research question: How is it possible to enrich the contemporary classical music tradition through elements of commercial music genres? Compositional research – the act of composing the opera – was performed with explicit attention to the central research question. It thereby served as an artistic ‘experiment’, researching the central question via the composition of musical materials. After completion, the score was analysed and theorised around a discursive-theoretical framework built on the ideas of Cross-Genre as defined by the author, for which two external metatheories are employed. Firstly, the essay “On the New” by Boris Groys was explored, which describes a field of interaction between the conservation of art history and the production of the “new”, compared in this instance to the interaction between contemporary classical music tradition and elements of commercial music genres (respectively). Secondly, the post-colonial theory of Homi K. Bhabha was addressed to provide a set of vocabulary from which terms for Cross-Genre composition are created, including “hybridity”, “stereotype” and “mimicry”, for example. These two intellectual points of reference are then demonstrated to be essential keys for understanding the ‘artistic experiment’ of the new opera via a score-analysis, the method for which was developed anew according to Cross-Genre, whilst being founded technically upon narrative semantics. It aims to provide a substantial map of interaction between the contemporary classical music tradition and elements of commercial music genres, and how it builds the core operatic dramaturgy of the work. The analytic method, the aesthetic thoughts on Cross-Genre and the artistic component itself (the score for I.th.Ak.A.) are offered as research artefacts. In short, the core of the dissertation is a process of making the author’s own creative process more cognitive."
