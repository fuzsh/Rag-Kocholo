        "text": "Le Favori (The Favorite Minister)\n\nby Marie-Catherine Desjardins (1664)\n\nIf you’re looking to explore the transactional nature of relationships when status is on the line… consider this tender-hearted hilarious romp complete with gossip, political intrigue, and romantic complications. Social prestige and customs maintain the delicate ecosystem that is the royal court, but when Moncade, the King’s sensitive and widely beloved favorite, is cast out, chaos ensues. As Moncade reckons with his status, the courtiers around him scheme to advance their own agendas using witty prose and undeniably shady tactics. With themes of inner beauty, integrity, and finding meaning within the ordinary, Le Favori calls into question our social ties and asks us what it means to truly value friendship.\n\nMarie-Catherine Desjardins, aka Madame de Villedieu (1640-1683) was the first woman to have her plays professionally staged and reviewed in the French capital. Following the divorce of her parents in 1655, the teenaged Marie-Catherine moved to Paris with her mother, where she quickly garnered wealthy benefactors through her literary prowess. She became known in the leading salons for her poetic talent – enough to hire a literary agent. The Favorite Minister was first performed for King Louis XIV and his court in 1665, breaking barriers and legitimizing dramatic writing as a pursuit for French women. A prolific writer, she produced 20 novels as well as a poetry collection and several plays over her lifetime.\n\nCasting*: Written as 3W/6M – could be doubled as 3W/5M or played as 5W/4M.\n\nProduction Considerations: No more than Shakespeare\n\nLicensing: Public Domain.\n\nAdelinda\n\nby Hannah Brand (1796)\n\nIf you’re looking for an irreverent class comedy featuring a gritty female lead… consider this romp of mistaken identities by the 18th century master of dialogue, Hannah Brand. The willful and mischievous Adelinda is set to marry the wealthy Count D’Olstain – much to her weary parents’ relief. The only problem – Adelinda is already secretly married to a lowly servant! Schemes and mistaken identities abound, lost children are returned, and some snooty parents get a rightful scolding in this comical and quippy caper about the lengths we go to for a happily ever after.\n\nHannah Brand (1754-1821) was an English actress, playwright, and poet. She began her career running a prestigious girls’ school with her sister, but by her late 30s, had decided to leave teaching and pursue a life in the theater. She published a book of poetry and plays in 1798, including Adelinda, which seems not to have been performed in her lifetime. In 1794, Brand retired from the stage and returned to the world of education, working as governess. Though her work was tragically overlooked in her time, she is considered by many modern historians as a pioneering figure in eighteenth century drama.\n\nCasting*: Written as 5W/3M\n\nProduction Considerations: No more than Shakespeare\n\nLicensing: Public Domain\n\nNew System of Freedom; or the Conspiracy Against Love\n\nby Charlotte von Stein (1798)\n\nIf you’re looking for a madcap Comedy of Errors with chaotic Gen-Z wit…consider this arch, rollicking take on love and freedom from German dramatist Charlotte Von Stein. Once upon a time, Menonda was happily in a relationship – until her brother, bent on destroying all romantic love, got between her and her beloved. Now, due to a mistaken kidnapping and several misplaced identities, she finds herself held captive under the same roof as both her jilted lover and her bumbling brother. Will the lovers reunite? Will the kidnapping be avenged? Does anyone know what’s going on? A confetti of comedy’s favorite pleasures served up with a healthy dose of camp, this is the perfect piece for any theater looking to engage a younger crowd in the classics.\n\nCharlotte Von Stein (1742-1827) was a prominent figure in the Weimar Court and enjoyed moderate literary success in her later life. She had a decade-long affair with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, one of the most influential writers in the German language. Goethe composed several poems in Charlotte’s honor and modeled characters in his works after her. Charlotte wrote at least four plays, only one of which was published during her lifetime. (However, the piece’s second publication was incorrectly attributed to her peer and acquaintance Friedrich Schiller. Rude.)\n\nCasting*: Written as 7W/8M with potential for doubling\n\nProduction Considerations: No more than Shakespeare, but may benefit from a production dramaturg\n\nLicensing: Public Domain - Translator David Clauson (dmclauson@gmail.com) allows companies to produce this text with no fee, but please contact him to let him know you’ll be producing it.\n\nThe Sons of Erin; or Modern Sentiments\n\nby Alicia Sheridan Le Fanu (1812)\n\nIf you’re looking for a plot-twist-filled farce with bold schemes to fight prejudice… consider this comedy from the elusive Irish playwright, Alicia Sheridan Le Fanu. When the eldest daughter of an upper-class English family marries an Irishman, she is cast out and the whole family is thrown into disarray. But what if that Irishman comes back to prove himself to the family… disguised as a distinguished secretary? What secrets does he uncover? Can the family ever look past their own bias and reconcile? Full of comedic mix ups and shocking plot twists, Sons of Erin shines a light on the nonsensical nature of prejudice.\n\nAlicia Sheridan Le Fanu (1753-1817) was a major influence in the Dublin artistic community. Even so, not much is actually known about her. Le Fanu was born and married into two prolific artistic families. Her father was an actor; her mother was a novelist and playwright; her sister published two novels; and her niece, Alicia Le Fanu (commonly mistaken for Alicia Sheridan Le Fanu), was a prolific writer. Many more in the Sheridan-Le Fanu families wrote and published - men and women alike. The family was known for their support of women’s education and writing. For example, when Alicia Sheridan Le Fanu could not be present for the last few rehearsals of Sons of Erin, her nephew took her place to see the process through.\n\nCasting*: Written as 6W/6M\n\nProduction Considerations: No more than Shakespeare, but a dialect coach could be helpful\n\nLicensing: Public Domain\n\nThe Verge\n\nby Susan Glaspell (1921)\n\nIf you’re looking for a tragi-comedy where the lyric insight of Virginia Woolf meets the electric cruelty of Hedda Gabler… consider this post-war portrait of a woman created and creating through destruction. Claire Archer attempts to transcend the constraints of modern life through the breeding of new plants, despite a literal Tom, Dick, and Harry trying to stop her. As the blossoming of her latest creation approaches, her sanity is called into question and tensions around her unique way of life explode. A piece that is by turns devastating philosophical portraiture, droll farce, and scathing feminist cry, The Verge comes together in a pressure cooker analysis of prescribed womanhood.\n\nSusan Keating Glaspell (1876-1947) got a degree in philosophy, then began her career as a reporter and columnist. She joined a radical social group, The Monists, and met her future husband, George Cram Cook, while protesting a book banning with them. They became prominent artists in Greenwich Village, and started The Provincetown Players. The company featured the talents of Edna St. Vincent Milay, Louisa Bryant, and Sinclair Lewis, and launched the career of Eugene O’Neill. Glaspell was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for Alison’s House, and briefly directed the midwest bureau for the Federal Theatre Project.\n\nCasting*: Written as 5W/4M, doubling possible\n\nProduction Considerations: 2 potentially elaborate sets; a fight director for the final scene\n\nLicensing: Public Domain\n\nHeaven Challenges\n\nby Li Man-kuei (1943)\n\nIf you’re looking for a dramedy about reframing your life and learning to fall in love (with yourself) again… consider this powerful Chinese play about love, loss, and artistic identity. Taking place in West China during the Sino-Japanese War, Heaven Challenges centers around Shih Kun-Yi, a housewife who has given up her love of painting to serve her husband. When he divorces her in an attempt to climb the social ladder, Shih Kun-Yi must discover how to fall in love all over again: with herself, her art, and her friends who are just as lost as she is. If the confrontation of gender roles in Ibsen’s A Doll’s House speaks to you, dive into this striking tale.\n\nLi Man-kuei (李曼瑰) (1907-1975) was a trailblazing politician, educator, and dramatist, who has been described as “the mother of modern Chinese drama.” After studying in China, she became a Hopwood Award-winning writer at the University of Michigan, winning the award the year before Arthur Miller. She worked at the Library of Congress and Columbia University before returning to China in 1940. A member of the Kuomintang, she was elected in 1948 to the parliament of the government it established in China. Like many Kuomintang supporters, she relocated to Taiwan, and there leveraged her political influence to reinvigorate local theatre. Li organized drama festivals, introduced Western performing arts styles via the Little Theatre Movement that she established in 1960, and led two universities’ drama departments. She wrote about 30 plays in English and Chinese.\n\nCasting*: Written as 4W/3M\n\nProduction Considerations: trigger warning for suicide content\n\nLicensing: Public Domain\n\nDay of the Swallows\n\nby Estela Portillo-Trambley (1971)\n\nIf you’re looking for a lush, poetic drama with a powerhouse queer heroine and an intersectional view of indigeneity… consider this moving piece from an eminent Chicana dramatist. Josefa is a pillar of her rural community - unflappable, benevolent, formidable, respected. Why then is there a fresh bloodstain on her floor? As the rest of the village women gather for a ritual to find husbands, Josefa is trapped in her house, frantically trying to prevent her secret from being revealed. This play is a harrowing, verdant exploration of the creation and keeping of a queer utopia, and what it costs to protect it. Capturing the poetry and cultural interrogation of Tennessee Williams with a distinctly feminist viewpoint, Day of the Swallows examines the secrets we’re forced to keep and the lengths we go to hide them.\n\nEstela Portillo-Trambley (1926-1998) was a writer, teacher, and talk-show host from El Segundo Barrio of El Paso, Texas. She taught English throughout El Paso public schools, taking a two-year break to host a radio talk show, Stella Says. The show frequently addressed political and controversial matters, and she was asked to write for a local TV station. In 1968, Portillo helped establish the first bilingual theater in El Paso, Los Pobres Bilingual Theater. She wrote eleven plays, and published novels, a novella, and a collection of stories, for which she became the first woman to receive the Premio Quinto Sol Award. She continued writing and teaching until her death in 1998.\n\nCasting*: Written as 4W/6M, could be 4W/4M with doubling or recording\n\nProduction Considerations: Use of two ethnic slurs. Features some text in Spanish. Would benefit from a production dramaturg or community associate. Features characters of mixed Spanish-Indigenous heritage; contemporary language (and Portillo herself) would describe this community as Chinana.\n\nLicensing: Send a written request to Tracey Trambley: contact us for the address\n\nThe Mother of 1084 (Hajar Churashir Maa)\n\nby Mahasweta Devi (1973)\n\nIf you’re looking for a whirling political drama centering a mother’s feminist awakening… consider this dreamlike exploration of familial ties and civic responsibility. Nearly two years after the killing of her son, Sujata continues to struggle with his involvement in the uprising that resulted in his death. She embarks on a journey to understand her son and in doing so comes to recognize her own oppression as a mother, wife, and woman. Reminiscent of Brecht’s The Mother, this powerful and deeply human play examines grief, love, and the cost of revolution.\n\nMahasweta Devi (1926-2016) is one of India’s foremost literary figures. Devi was also an activist: she traveled frequently, often embedding herself in the communities she was writing about and organizing with them to protest the injustices they faced. Many of her 100+ novels and short stories were focused on the lives of tribal communities, the lower classes, rebels and revolutionaries, sex workers and nomads. She received India’s most esteemed literary recognition, the Jnanpith Award, and was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for her “compassionate crusade through art and activism to claim for tribal peoples a just and honorable place in India’s national life.”\n\nCasting*: Written as 9W/9M, could be doubled\n\nProduction Considerations: Large cast of Indian characters. A cultural consultant and/or dramaturg for pronunciation and historical context.\n\nLicensing: Seagull Books - contact naveenatseagull@yahoo.in or info@seagullbooks.org\n\nSpell #7\n\nby Ntozake Shange (1979)\n\nIf you’re looking for an ensemble-lead choreopoem that explores the Black experience in the entertainment industry… consider Spell #7 by celebrated playwright Ntozake Shange. Set in the late 70s in St. Louis, Missouri, the play welcomes us into a world not too far from our own, forcing us to reckon with the realities of the “isms” in creative spaces. The play takes us through the lives of 9 characters who are fighting to discover themselves as artists in a society that sees them as one dimensional after-thoughts. Using a mixture of lush poetry and stylized choreography (and guided by a literal magician), the ensemble explores the effects of blackface and violence against Black women in the entertainment industry and beyond.\n\nNtozake Shange (1948-2018) moved to St. Louis, MO, soon after the Brown v. Board ruling, and her experience as the first Black student in her class heavily influenced her work. Equally influential were her supportive parents: to support their daughters’ artistic education, they befriended the likes of Dizzy Gillespie, Chuck Berry, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, and Josephine Baker. Shange taught Humanities, Women’s Studies, and Afro-American Studies at California colleges. Her most famous work, For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow is Enuf, brought her fame during its two years on Broadway, and was adapted into a feature film.\n\nCasting*: Written as 4W/5M\n\nProduction Considerations: 9 Black triple-threat actors, Music Director, Musicians, Choreographer, Dramaturg, Large Black-face mask that looms over the audience\n\nLicensing: Concord Theatricals\n\nThe Lucky Chance\n\nby Aphra Behn (1686)\n\nIf you’re looking to gamble on love with this multi-generational comedy featuring headstrong heroines and aging Romeos… consider this raunchy Restoration Comedy about sex, marriage, and consent. The ripened, spry, and sometimes lecherous Sir Cautious Fulbank and Sir Feeble Fainwou’d used their money and status to land young wives. But both wives had young suitors they already loved… who are trying to win them back! While the old men gamble, bribe, and swindle, the young suitors assume double identities, dance with a Devil(!), and put their livelihoods on the line –– with plenty of help from their crafty ladies. Delight in this unapologetic critique of capitalism and patriarchy while asking: are our motives in love and partnership ever truly altruistic?\n\nAphra Behn (1640-1689) is known as the first woman in the world who made her living solely off of writing. She was a novelist, a playwright, and a spy for the King! Much of Aphra Behn’s early life cannot be known for sure – some believe she obscured the details of her early life intentionally. Her husband passed away in 1665, leaving Behn in need of ways to support herself– so she turned to writing. One of her most notable works was The Rover (1681), which was one of the most successful plays of her time. She passed away in 1689, and is buried in Westminster Abbey.\n\nCasting*: Written as 4W, 9M\n\nProduction Considerations: We strongly encourage hiring an intimacy coordinator. Requires a “devil costume” and perhaps some songs, which are cuttable.\n\nLicensing: Public Domain\n\nLaodamia\n\nby Catherine Bernard (1698)\n\nIf you’re looking to blend the political intrigue of Shakespeare’s histories with the visceral drama of a Greek tragedy… consider Catherine Bernard’s tight verse play featuring a moral yet conflicted Queen trapped in a tragic love quadrangle. Caught between her heart and her sense of place, Laodamia, the Queen of Epirus, has always lived a life of self sacrifice– until she falls in love with her sister’s betrothed. Set against the backdrop of an impending revolution, this tragic love story is as much about deep sisterly bonds as it is about political intrigue. As her feelings conflict with the world’s expectations and the whole court is thrown into chaos, Laodamia must decide whether to follow her heart or her sense of duty. Tense, vibrant, and a true vehicle for a powerhouse female actor, this play will keep you in suspense until the last climactic second.\n\nCatherine Bernard (1662-1712) was one of the most successful female playwrights of the 17th century. Despite her success, little is known about her life – not even the dates of her birth. Also an acclaimed novelist and poet, she is perhaps best known for setting the aesthetic foundations for the French fairy tale genre. Bernard achieved widespread critical and commercial success, even though it was considered scandalous for a woman to write tragedies. However, despite the outward success of her plays and novels, she still relied primarily on money received from competitions and patron nobles in Louis XIV’s court to survive.\n\nCasting*: Written as 4W, 4M\n\nProducing Considerations: optional - Because much of the most dramatic actions take place offstage, if dramatized, some of those moments would likely need a larger ensemble cast and a good fight choreographer.\n\nLicensing: Public Domain\n\nThe Mésalliance\n\nby Luise Gottsched (1743)\n\nIf you’re looking for a farcical skewering of the aristocracy that evokes an Arrested Development for the 18th century… consider this contemporary roast of old-money values. The notable Von Ahnensoltz family deigns to allow a bourgeois gentleman to marry their noble daughter… and pay off all their debts, of course. However, their daughter isn’t sold, instead creating delicious chaos with her formerly affianced… and delicately, sort of, sticking it to the man. Dusty heraldry, fashionable hypochondria, and, of course, debt abound in this frothy class commentary that would elevate the Tartuffe or Imaginary Invalid slot of any season.\n\nLuise Gottsched (1713-1762) is remembered as “the mother of modern Germany comedy.” She was a German-language poet, playwright, essayist, and translator. Encouraged by a highly educated mother and raised in the progressive circles of the Polish royal court, Gottsched began to write poetry when she was only twelve years old. She went on to garner literary acclaim from her translations and original comedies created for The German Stage (one of which was The Mésalliance). She passed in 1762, leaving behind an indescribably extensive canon of translations and a number of influential plays.\n\nCasting*: Written as 4W, 6M\n\nProducing Considerations: Three very minor line changes should be made to update older, offensive language.\n\nLicensing: Translation - Camden House, an imprint of Boydell & Brewer Inc.\n\nThe Uncle\n\nby Princess Amalie of Saxony (1835)\n\nIf you’re looking for the German Jane Austen’s riff on a marriage plot where the impressionable ingenue turns out to be a shrewd strategist… consider this fresh, delicate romantic comedy. Löwenberg needs his Uncle’s approval for his intended marriage to Anna, but he knows he’ll never get it from such an avowed bachelor... unless he can trick his Uncle into falling in love with his beloved himself! But the plan works a little too well. After ridiculous miscommunications, deceptions, and delightful physical interludes, Anna emerges as a self-possessed agent of her own fate and Princess Amalie ensures that her leading lady has the last laugh.\n\nPrincess Amalie of Saxony (1794-1870) was forced to flee her home at age 12, when Napoleon occupied Saxony. Her time as a teenager in exile shaped her writing, and she returned to Dresden and her royal role with a new perspective. Amalie was then exposed to Italian operas, shortly after beginning to compose operas under a pseudonym, which were performed during family celebrations and for the court’s inner circle. When she began writing plays, her first comedy, Falsehood and Truth, was produced at the top theater in Berlin. In 1842, many of her plays were published together as “Essays for the German Stage,” all the proceeds for which she donated to a charity in Dresden. Princess Amalie’s works express inherently feminist positions, specifically on a woman’s right to consent.\n\nCasting*: Written as 4W, 6M\n\nProducing Considerations: None particularly. But it requires two locations, which could be wonderfully lavish if the production budget allows.\n\nLicensing: Public Domain\n\nThe Stone Host\n\nby Lesya Ukrainka (1912)\n\nIf you always wished you could see Lady Macbeth take on Don Juan… consider this reimagining of the Don Juan myth from a celebrated Ukrainian author. Donna Anna is looking to transcend her position in society, and an ineffectual Don Juan might just be her ticket out – inciting an impassioned game of cat and mouse. Told in the Spanish Golden Age tradition, this play’s masquerade balls, moody cemeteries, and sword fights will keep an audience in joyful suspense until its surprising conclusion. With complexity, romance, and modern-sounding verse, Ukrainka examines the power struggles that still hold sway in our relationships today.\n\nLesya Ukrainka (born Larysa Petrivna Kosach; 1871-1913) was a Ukrainian writer, translator, and activist. During her childhood, her mother submitted Ukrainka’s work to literary journals under the pseudonym ‘Lesya Ukrainka’ (meaning approximately ‘Ukrainian Woman’) to protect her identity in the wake of suppression of the Ukrainian language under Russification. Ukrainka was a devoted Marxist and remained politically opposed to Russian tsarism for her entire career. Her revolutionary activities and controversial publications led to her arrest in 1907, and she remained under tsarist watch for the remaining six years of her life. She died in 1913, leaving behind an impressive portfolio of work and a legacy of activism that cemented her as one of the most significant literary figures in modern Ukrainian history. She is featured on the 200 hryvnia banknote.\n\nCasting*: Written as 7W, 3M (with a few additional ensemble members that can be doubled)\n\nProducing Considerations: Some music and dancing, some stage violence, and some clever stage craft as one character steps out of mirror.\n\nLicensing: Public Domain\n\nThe Singing Valley\n\nby Josefina Niggli (1936)\n\nIf you’re looking for an atmospheric romance where the truest love story is one with home and community… consider this heartfelt struggle between new and old. After 30 years in the Big City, Antonio Lozano returns with his adult children to his village in Mexico, focused on innovating farming practices in his rural home. The cosmopolitan meets the pastoral, conflict abounds, and the entire valley must decide whether to adapt to a modernized future or to stick with traditions steeped in history. Addressing globalization, romanticized change, and our relationship to the environment, this sensitive story asks us what it truly means to return home.\n\nJosefina Niggli (1910-1983) was among the first to write in English about Mexican topics, focusing in particular on gender, race, and ethnicity. She was born in Mexico to Anglo-American parents. Forced to flee during the Mexican Revolution, she spent much of her childhood unhappily in Texas, desperate to return to Mexico. Themes of displacement, lack of belonging, and return to a homeland would later permeate her works. Niggli received a master’s degree in drama from University of North Carolina and spent several years writing and teaching there until moving back to Mexico. After the success of her novels, Niggli became a stable writer for Twentieth-Century Fox and MGM studios where she worked anonymously on films like The Mark of Zorro. Niggli died in 1983. Her work has been recently acknowledged as radical and trailblazing, particular for the Chicanx literature movement. She is recognized for laying the foundation for Chicana feminists like Gloria Anzaldúa, Ana Castillo, and Sandra Cisneros.\n\nCasting*: Written as 5W, 8M (includes one child)\n\nProducing Considerations: While the music is noted at the end of the script, you may need a musical director.\n\nLicensing: The University of Wisconsin Press\n\nDust to Earth\n\nby Shirley Graham Du Bois (1939)\n\nIf you’re looking for a live-wire take on fossil fuel and the American labor system… consider this incendiary drama exploring the intersection of racism, capitalism and environmentalism. Set against the backdrop of a rural coal mine, a young Black man struggles to confront his heritage when his white father arrives to survey the mine his white daughter is set to inherit. A tack-sharp look at systemic violence and ultimately a plea towards empathy, it is a perfect drama for the Miller or O’Neil slot in your season.\n\nShirley Graham Du Bois (1896-1977) was an American playwright, composer, biographer, educator, and activist. After her father was named president of Monrovia College in Liberia, Du Bois moved to Paris to study music at The Sorbonne. She then studied at Howard University, and eventually obtained her BA and MA in music from Oberlin College. Du Bois was later named director-supervisor of “Chicago Negro Unit” of the Federal Theater Project. Political associates in the 1940’s and peers since her childhood, Du Bois married famed sociologist and activist W.E.B. Du Bois in 1951. The couple, frustrated at their continued mistreatment and lack of progress in America, renounced their citizenship and became citizens of Ghana. She died of breast cancer in Beijing, China in 1977. Du Bois' expansive life demonstrated a tireless commitment to social and artistic activism, Black history, and education.\n\nCasting*: 10 W, 12 M - racially specific\n\nProducing Considerations: An on-stage mine-shaft, large multi-ethnic cast including a lead actor who reads as a mixed-race redhead, intimacy coordinator, fight director.\n\nProducing Opportunities: The comparison (or perhaps integration) of SGD’s Coal Dust, an earlier iteration of the play, which further fleshes out characters and themes.\n\nLicensing: Odell Murry\n\nLas Pascualas\n\nby Isidora Aguirre (1957)\n\nIf you’re looking for an ethereal folk story about the perils of love and loneliness… consider this elusively modern take on a traditional Chilean folktale. Legend has it that long ago, three lonely women lived in harmony alongside a lake – until their lives were altered forever by a mysterious stranger with whom they each fell in love. Driven to extremes by forbidden love and the gendered constraints of their world, the women struggle with their new worldviews and each other, leading this tightly wound story to its haunting climax. Aguirre’s elegiac masterpiece is grounded by its portrait of the realities of female loneliness in a patriarchal society, making it as raw and intimate as it is otherworldly.\n\nIsidora Aguirre (1919-2011) was a prolific Chilean playwright who wrote more than 30 plays and multiple novels. At the age of 21, Aguirre married a refugee from the Spanish Civil War and moved to Paris, where she made her living as an illustrator. Upon her return to Chile, she ran into actor and theater director Hugo Miller on a trolley ride that altered her trajectory in life – their interaction sparked her interest in theater, and she enrolled in a dramaturgy course of his at the Ministry of Education. Her works covered many styles, but she consistently investigated the social norms of her country. She is considered one of the foremost Chilean dramatists of the 20th Century.\n\nCasting*: written as 6W, 2M\n\nProducing Considerations: None particularly. Multiple playing spaces, some complex props if desired.\n\nLicensing: Public Domain\n\nAnd the Soul Shall Dance\n\nby Wakako Yamauchi (1976)\n\nIf you’re looking for a wistful story about immigration, identity, and the American dream… then dive into the powerful yet sparse world of Wakako Yamauchi’s And the Soul Shall Dance. Set in Great Depression Era California, this play follows two Japanese immigrant families and their young daughters as they struggle to make ends meet, integrate into US society, and survive the whims of nature and each other. United by circumstance, the women find solace in each other, building bonds despite their differing impressions and traumas, and savoring the art that makes their souls dance. Intimately specific yet universally felt, this historical family drama illuminates the realities of immigration, labor struggles, and gender inequities that still resonate today.\n\nWakako Yamauchi (1924-2018) was a groundbreaking Japanese-American writer, poet, and painter. Born in California in 1924 to two immigrant parents working as itinerant farmers, Yamauchi grew up in a rural community with a house just big enough to fit on the back of a truck. At the age of 17, she and her family were sent to an internment camp, where she would remain for the next year and a half. While there, Yamauchi started her artistic career, working on the camp newspaper as a cartoonist. After the war, she wrote And the Soul Shall Dance, which won the 1977 Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for the best new play and was later produced for public broadcast. In 1980, Joseph Papp, the founder of The Public, produced a successful run of Yamauchi’s The Music Lesson as a response to the backlash about lack of opportunities for Asian-American artists in the theatre. Yamauchi never stopped writing, publishing works into her 70s and 80s.\n\nCasting*: written as 4W, 2M\n\nProducing Considerations: While this play has universally relevant themes, they were written by a Japanese-American woman who lived through an internment camp. We encourage producers to thoughtfully investigate that historical and cultural context and to take it into serious consideration when making casting choices.\n\nLicensing: Japanese American National Museum\n\nValor, Agravio y Mujer (Valor, Outrage and Woman)\n\nby Ana Caro (1640)\n\nIf you want a scorned heroine who is determined to live in a revenge tragedy but accidentally finds herself in a comedy… consider this Spanish Golden Age play. With cross dressing, love triangles, swordplay, and soaring verse, this is a celebration of women’s agency. Doña Leonora dresses like a man and crosses Europe to get revenge on her ungrateful ex who left her unmarriageable. Along the way, she manipulates others in her sphere (often through the clever use of funny voices) causing confusion and antics – and ends up with a triumph that she deems better than any murder.\n\nAna Caro Mallén de Soto (1590?-1660?) was a prolific and widely-praised Spanish poet and playwright. Some evidence suggests that she was enslaved at birth in Granada and was later adopted by an officer of the High Court of Justice. She was one of the first female playwrights to earn money for her writing. Only two of her plays survive.\n\nCasting*: Maximum 13 Actors // Minimum 9 Actors – Written as 4W, 9M\n\nProduction Considerations: Nothing beyond a typical Shakespeare play. Some strong cuts may help a contemporary audience move through abundant monologues.\n\nTranslations: The Courage to Right a Woman’s Wrongs by UCLA’s Diversifying the Classics; Valor, Outrage, and Love by Amy Kaminsky (heightened language)\n\nLicensing: Diversifying the Classics translation | Amy Kaminsky translation\n\nThe Frolicks, or the Lawyer Cheated\n\nby Elizabeth Polwhele (1671)\n\nIf you’re looking for a Restoration play with even more hijincks than Merry Wives of Windsor… consider this energetic, bawdy comedy that centers around the tricksy courtship of the clever Clarabell and the rakish Rightwit. Through a series of deceptions, plots, pranks, and manipulations, they find a way to be together – and manage to marry off everyone else in the cast as well. Complete with doltish country suitors, deceitful women, trusting husbands, untrusting fathers, and trendy dances, this play covers all the best staples of the Restoration. The plot itself is simple, and yet the events that lead us along the way are delightfully frothy, foolish, and fun.\n\nElizabeth Polwhele (1651?-1691?) is our mystery woman playwright. She’s English and wrote three plays, one of which is lost. She was likely the daughter of a vicar, and married a minister… but if so, she would have been 20 and unmarried when she wrote this bawdy play, which wasn’t her first production. All we truly know is she considered herself “an unfortunate young woman haunted by poetic devils.” And, The Frolicks—whether actually performed in her time or not—is the first comedy by a woman playwright for professional production in England. The image we have included here is “Portrait of an Unknown Woman,” which seemed fitting.\n\nCasting*: Maximum 25 Actors // Minimum 16 Actors – Written as 5W, 11M\n\nProduction Considerations: This production calls for a large cast. We suggest some shrewd cuts (including our cut available to your left.) We also recommend having a fight director and intimacy coordinator for this play.\n\nLicensing: Public Domain\n\nThe Beau Defeated\n\nby Mary Pix (1700)\n\nIf you’re looking for a fun rom-com where your wingman is a flock of wingwomen… consider this witty Restoration comedy. A rollicking, hilarious, and touching tale of Mrs Rich, the wealthy widow of a banker, who wants to marry a Lord to improve her social status. She listens to all the wrong people for advice– eventually leading her straight into the arms of a notable rogue. Through sparkling discourse, interwoven with a moving subplot, Mrs. Rich’s friends and brother-in-law come to her rescue in the nick of time and prevent their friend (and a few other women) from throwing it all away for an undeserving man.\n\nMary Pix (1666 -1709) joined up with her intellectual gal pals, forming a trio of early female (some might say feminist) playwrights. Delariviere Manley, Catherine Trotter, and Mary Pix rose to fame at the same time with their works. They gained so much public attention that they were parodied in an anonymous satirical play The Female Wits (1696). Mary wrote seven plays total, with an additional four published anonymously but attributed to her.\n\nCasting*: Maximum 19 Actors // Minimum 15 Actors – Written as 10W, 9M\n\nProduction Considerations: Heavy props and costumes needed (if keeping the play in its period)\n\nLicensing: Public Domain\n\nThe Fatal Falsehood\n\nby Hannah More (1779)\n\nIf you want a high-octane alternative to Two Gentlemen of Verona… consider this tight rollercoaster of a poetic play instead. Here, two of the closest friends fall deeply in love with the same woman. Spurred on by an Iago-like character, the plot careens toward a tragic end – yet each character reflects on the ramifications of their actions, which makes it all the more impactful. Fall in love—and out—with this epic tale of romance and duty. Undeniably, the poetry of this play is one of its biggest strengths, so be careful of confusing it with the Bard! Bonus: with some minor cuts to avoid a puzzling suicide, this tragedy could easily be presented as a dark comedy!\n\nHannah More (1745-1833) was a moralist, practical philanthropist, poet, and playwright. She was deeply involved in the campaign to end slavery. Often mocked by her male literary counterparts, she persisted, writing many pastoral plays and Percy (a play which was found among Mozart’s possessions in 1791). The Fatal Falsehood was her final play before shifting her focus to promoting accessible education for girls and poorer children. (Fun ETC gossip moment: More stopped writing for the stage after a pamphlet-duel with Hannah Cowley, from our 2020 list, about who was plagiarizing from whom!)\n\nCasting*: 6 Actors – Written as 2W, 4M\n\nProduction Considerations: None more than a Shakespeare play (and fewer costumes!)\n\nLicensing: Public Domain\n\nFrançoise\n\nby George Sand (1856)\n\nIf you’re looking for something a bit lighter in your Ibsen or Shaw slot… consider this deft comedy where the girl finally learns to stand up for herself. An enjoyable romp through Bourges, France, this play speaks to anyone who has gotten stuck in a relationship with someone truly selfish. Henri, the idealized love of Francoise, is “a central role without precedent in French literature” – yet whom is easily recognized in contemporary life. Ahead of its time, George Sand delivers this delightful, snide jab at the aristocracy that seems a precursor to Oscar Wilde’s cutting humor. Join us in rooting for Françoise as she gains the self worth to say adieu.\n\nGeorge Sand (1804-1876) is a well-known writer of novels and was perhaps one of the most famous writers in France – even beyond her contemporary Victor Hugo. Noted for her gender fluid persona, Sand often wore men’s clothes in public – which required a permit at the time. By the age of twenty-seven, she had built an empire out of her words. Sand was extremely popular, becoming an icon of the literary movement during the Romantic era, and leaving behind an impressive legacy.\n\nCasting*: 8 actors – Written as 3W, 5M\n\nProducing Considerations: Similar to producing an Oscar Wilde play. Three settings and period costumes, depending on your vision.\n\nLicensing: SUNY Press\n\nForging the Truth (杨绛)\n\nby Yang Jiang (1940)\n\ntranslated by Amy Dooling\n\nIf you’re looking for a clever class comedy by a Noel Coward contemporary… consider this zany play that takes on tradition, marriage, and capitalism. The spoiled but sweet Wanru has a watchful father… who she is desperate to avoid when sneaking in her hot new boyfriend. In this story, family is often run like a business and financial prospects are important across the board – but not everyone is clearly showing their cards. Wanru’s Dad keeps trying to run her love life like a business, Yanhua gets the world’s worst proposal, and everyone’s trying to keep up the face of tradition... even if it’s just a show. Chinese comedic playwright Yang Jiang brings light, love, and clarity to this relatable family situation.\n\nYang Jiang (杨绛) (1911-2016) was a Chinese playwright, author and translator. She is best known as the first Chinese person to produce a complete Chinese translation of Miguel de Cervantes' novel, Don Quixote. A Chinese, French, English and Spanish speaker, she translated materials from many cultures. During the Cultural Revolution, she and her husband were sent to labor camps due to their status as cultural figures and educators – and after, she returned again to writing. Contradicting a Chinese saying that it is impossible for a woman to be both a chaste wife and a gifted scholar or talented artist, her husband once described her as “the most chaste wife and talented girl” in China.\n\nAmy Dooling (translator) is a scholar of modern Chinese literature. She has published books on 20th century women’s writing and feminist literary culture. Dooling’s scholarship focuses on the intersections between political activism and cultural expression in modern China. She has written extensively on the subject of radical women writers and early twentieth-century feminism.\n\nCasting*: Maximum: 13 Actors // Minimum: 11 Actors – Written as 7W, 6M\n\nProducing Considerations: Three sets.\n\nLicensing: Contact the translator; Contact the estate\n\nForiwa\n\nby Efua T. Sutherland (1962)\n\nIf you’re looking for a story about a small community and love akin to Our Town... consider this play about how an overlooked outsider and two powerful women can shake a community out of a slump. Set in a small Ghanaian village, a love story emerges, challenging the town to reconcile tradition with modernity. Relatable across the globe, this sweet yet brave look into a slice of Ghanaian life shows what it takes to rebuild a community — hope, courage, and open hearts.\n\nEfua Sutherland (1924-1996) was a beloved playwright, author, and child advocate. After completing her studies in Ghana, she pursued higher education in England, where she was one of the first African women to study at Cambridge. Upon her return, she founded the Ghana Experimental Theatre, which later became the Drama Studio. Based around Ghanaian tradition and storytelling methods, her work helped introduce the study of African performance tradition at a university level.\n\nCasting*: Maximum Unlimited // Minimum 10 Actors – Written as 7W, 13M\n\nProducing Considerations: The playwright notes that this could be done as a site specific piece or in a traditional theatre with symbolic scenic pieces. The production requires consultation with someone knowledgeable about Ghanaian rituals. While it is a potentially large cast, there are doubling opportunities.\n\nLicensing: Click here to email the estate.\n\nA Happy Country (Un País Feliz)\n\nby Maruxa Vilalta (1964)\n\nIf you’re seeking a play about revolution where the family drama is the political drama… consider this powerful portrait of love, protest, class, and voyeurism. This play follows the recently impoverished Jiménez family in an unnamed Spanish-speaking country as complex conversations are brought to the foreground by the arrival of a tourist staying in their home. How do you balance your activism with your desire to just live? Do you fight for your family, or your country? And how do you be an ethical tourist in a culture that is not your own? This play leaves an audience asking all the right questions and drawing their own timely parallels.\n\nMaruxa Vilalta (1932-2014) is a highly acclaimed Catalan-born, Mexican playwright, novelist, and director. She was born to two lawyer parents in Barcelona – where her mother was the first woman to graduate from the law school. They moved to Mexico at the beginning of the Spanish Civil war. She wrote numerous novels and plays, and won Mexico’s national prize for Arts and Sciences in 2010.\n\nEdward Huberman (translator) worked on translating a number of Maruxa Vilalta’s plays.\n\nCasting*: 7 Actors – Written as 2W, 5M\n\nProducing Considerations: Simple set, one setting, no major changes. Here is a wonderful opportunity to commission a new translation. We are including the Spanish text in hopes that it may inspire such treatment.\n\nLicensing: Translation by Edward Huberman, contact the Latin American Literary Review\n\nLes Blancs\n\nby Lorraine Hansberry (1970)\n\nIf you’re looking to tackle race, imperialism, and the prejudice of the Western world towards African countries… consider this mesmerizing masterpiece. Set in a rural Christian mission in an unnamed African country, this play explores the complexities of navigating personal relationships across racial divides when every decision you make is inherently political. Intricate, atmospheric, and shimmering with emotional truth, this play is as relevant to our modern world now as it was fifty years ago.\n\nLorraine Hansberry (1930–1965) was a playwright, author, activist, and visionary. Best known for her work, A Raisin in the Sun, Hansberry was the first Black woman playwright produced on Broadway. She won the New York Drama Critics’ Circle Award at the age of 29, making her the first African-American, the fifth woman, and the youngest writer in history to do so. She was a vocal proponent of the Civil Rights movement, gender equality, and queer liberation. She died in 1965 of pancreatic cancer at the age of 34. At her funeral, the priest read a message from James Baldwin and Martin Luther King Jr., which said, “Her creative ability and her profound grasp of the deep social issues confronting the world today will remain an inspiration to generations yet unborn.”\n\nCasting*: Maximum 20 Actors // Minimum 11 Actors – Written as 3W, 8M\n\nProducing Considerations: The cast calls for a number of non-speaking roles, some of which can be doubled, and a child. There are some gunshots fired onstage, and a building is blown up by a grenade. There is also some ritualistic African dance, so bring on a great choreographer!\n\nLicensing: Concord Theatricals\n\nLos Empeños de Una Casa (House of Desires)\n\nby Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz (1683)\n\nIf you wish Twelfth Night’s love triangle was a love octagon… meet this passionate and thrilling comedy. House of Desires is a romantic farce about two siblings involved in a variety of romantic entanglements. Lock everyone in the same house, sometimes turn off the lights, and watch the sparks and antics ensue! Originally written in Spanish, it is a wonderfully witty comedy of errors full of clear-sighted female protagonists, clever servants, and the folly of ambitious men.\n\nSor Juana Inés de la Cruz (1648-1695) was born in Mexico to a Spanish father and Mexican mother. She later sequestered herself in a convent, the only way for a woman to pursue her thirst for knowledge and gain instruction in the arts. During that time, she used her works to comment on the socio-politico-economic landscape of Mexico in the 17th century and condemn the sexism of the church.\n\nCatherine Boyle (translator) is a professor of Latin American Culture at King’s College in London. She has translated numerous other works for premier theaters in Europe and wrote “Chilean Theater: 1973-1985” which looks at theater in Chile and the impact this story telling had on the medium.\n\nCasting: Maximum: 3W, 7M (10) // Minimum: 3W, 6M (9)\n\nProducing Considerations: There is an original song performed by musicians that only appears in one scene. This could be pre-recorded or adapted. The action primarily takes place in one locale with many doors. Although this play has universally relevant themes and characterizations, it was originally written by a Mexican woman for Spanish speaking audiences. We encourage producers to thoughtfully investigate the historical and cultural context and to take it into consideration when making casting and production staff choices.\n\nTranslations: We recommend Catherine Boyle’s House of Desires.\n\nAlso: Michael McGaha’s Pawns of a House; Anadina Saladino’s Trouble at Home; David Pasto’s The House of Trials.\n\nLicensing: Concord Theatricals (for Boyle’s translation)\n\nBold Stroke for a Wife\n\nby Susanna Centlivre (1718)\n\nIf you’re looking for a restoration play that tackles the patriarchy (comedically, of course)… you’ve met your match. A star vehicle for a charismatic actor, this Moliere-esque comedy deftly ridicules hypocrisy, greed, hubris, and the absurdity of women’s position as property. Anne Lovely has not one but four bizarre male guardians who must give consent to her marriage, and Colonel Fainwell is determined to win each over through the clever use of disguises. With insightful satire, physical comedy, and modern humor, this tight plot keeps an audience in joyful suspense until the final moment.\n\nSusanna Centlivre (1669-1723) is perhaps the most successful English playwright after William Shakespeare by number of performances before the twentieth century.\n\nCasting: Maximum 4W, 15M (19) // Minimum 3W, 9M (12)\n\nProducing Considerations: No more than any Shakespeare production; exciting opportunities for a costume designer.\n\nLicensing: Public Domain\n\nBold Stroke for a Husband\n\nby Hannah Cowley (1783)\n\nIf you’re thinking of producing The Taming of the Shrew… consider this play, featuring five bold women with strength and agency instead. While Olivia takes on various unattractive qualities to un-suit her various suitors (despite her frustrated father’s attempts to marry her off), Laura and Victoria are wooing each other – yet competing with each other – both in an effort to best Don Carlos. Bold Stroke for a Husband has the levity and hijinks of a Shakespearean comedy with the feminist attitudes of a much more modern piece, combining the best of Shrew and Twelfth Night in one tight, funny, uplifting narrative.\n\nHannah Cowley (1743-1809) is best known for writing The Belle’s Stratagem. Her first play – which she wrote in a day, was supposedly inspired by going to the theatre and telling her husband, “Well I could write as well myself!”\n\nCasting: Maximum: 7W, 8M (15) // Minimum: 5W, 6M (11)\n\nProducing Considerations: No more than for any Shakespeare play.\n\nLicensing: Public Domain\n\nAnima (Her Soul)\n\nby Amelia P. Rosselli (1898)\n\nIf you put The Seagull, A Doll’s House, and Mrs. Warren’s Profession in a blender… you get this thoughtful dramedy about a woman’s true value. Our charming protagonist, Olga, is a successful painter, a wit, and, it turns out, a victim of sexual assault. Revelations of her past subvert her romantic future and ultimately lead her to end up with a kind man who values her soul rather than her body. Anima (or Her Soul) reminds us of the negative implications of patriarchal norms on both men and women. Step into this quirky, disarming, and award-winning play for an examination of who we’re really seeking.\n\nAmelia Pincherle Rosselli (1870-1954) was born in Venice to a prominent Jewish family and later lived in Florence where she was active in promoting social justice and women’s causes. She gave up writing after her sons, Carlo and Nello, founders of the antifascist movement Justice and Liberty, were assassinated in 1937 on Mussolini’s orders. She left Italy, lived in the USA, but ultimately returned to Florence.\n\nNatalia Costa-Zalessow (translator) is Professor Emerita in the Department of Modern Languages at San Francisco State University. She is the author of Scrittrici italiane dal XIII al XX secolo: Testi e critica; Amelia Pincherle Rosselli: Her Soul and Anima: Dramma in tre atti; Francesca Turini Bufalini: Autobiographical Poems; Margherita Costa: Voice of a Virtuosa and Courtesan Selected Poems; and 31 articles on various Italian writers.\n\nCasting: Maximum 6W, 9M (15) // Minimum 5W, 5M (10)\n\nProducing Considerations: Three locales.\n\nLicensing: Contact Natalia Costa-Zalessow (email in script) for performance rights.\n\nRachel\n\nby Angelina Weld Grimké (1916)\n\nIf you’re looking to engage a white audience in BLM conversations… consider this heartbreaking yet love-filled family portrait. This play was “the first attempt to use the stage for race propaganda in order to enlighten the [white] American people relative to the lamentable condition of the millions of Colored citizens in this free republic,” according to the program for the first production in NYC in 1916. Rachel, a young Black woman in love, wonders if she could endure having kids of her own given the racism she and the children in her neighborhood face everyday. Though certainly a tragedy, this play also shows Black love and Black joy in this historically important piece.\n\nAngelina Weld Grimké (1880-1958) is one of the first African American women to have her play produced in 1916 and published in 1920. She is the descendant of the Grimké sisters, two abolitionists, and the niece of Francis J. Grimké who helped establish the NAACP. Thought of as a predecessor of the Harlem Renaissance, she inspired the likes of Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes. It is also rumored that she was gay--she wrote many poems focusing on queer love and romance.\n\nCasting: Maximum: 3W, 3M, 9 children (15) // Minimum: 3W, 3M, 2 children (8)\n\nProducing Considerations: As written, the script calls for no less than 8 children under 10 years old. However, with some easy cuts, the play can be (and has been) done with 2 children (Ethel and Jimmy).\n\nLicensing: Public Domain\n\nThe Drag\n\nby Mae West (1927)\n\nIf you thought LGBTQ+ culture was invented in the 1960s, think again… Witty, tragic, and vibrant, The Drag is an exquisite portrait of the existing LGBTQ+ community of the 1920s. Mae West crafts an eloquent history lesson mixed with joyful celebration. The Drag shows the perils of “conversion therapy” and the criminalization of homosexuality, while simultaneously presenting in delightful clarity the same joys, losses, warmth, and transgressive counter-culture that our LGBTQ+ family feels to this day.\n\nMae West (1893-1980) was one of the most multi-disciplinary and controversial artists of the 20th century, known for her comic chops, fearless sensuality, and toeing the lines of censorship. An icon of the sexual revolution, she proclaimed “I was the first liberated woman, you know. No guy was going to get the best of me.” When she was arrested for the “indecency” of her plays, she took a limo to jail.\n\nCasting: Maximum 4+ W, 14+ M (18+) // Minimum 3W, 9M (12)\n\nProducing Considerations: There is a full blown, queertastic, magical, drag show/dance party scene at the top of Act Three. (You’re welcome.) We encourage producers to consider casting outside the bounds of gender binary casting listings and to make special efforts to consider LGBTQ actors for LGBTQ roles.\n\nLicensing: Public Domain: the agency that represented Mae West is now defunct.\n\nOne-Acts or Restless Night in Late Spring & A Hell of Her Own\n\nby Fumiko Enchi (1928)\n\nIf you’re interested in the intersection of art and politics… consider these one-act plays! In Restless Night, two college students debate the virtues of creating art or abandoning it all to become a political activist -– both coming close to understanding each other, though not seeing eye to eye. A Hell of Her Own delves into similar questions: is rebellion more virtuous than being… well, virtuous? Women are at the center of these two beautiful, thoughtful slices of life – and both have the exact same breakdown of actors to make doubling easy.\n\nFumiko Enchi (1905-1986) is a celebrated Japanese writer. Despite suffering from multiple serious health conditions, Enchi was a prolific writer. She won multiple literary prizes for her novels and wrote around 20 plays – though very few of her works have been translated into English (yet!).\n\nAyako Kano (translator) is a professor of East Asian Languages and Civilizations at the University of Pennsylvania. She is the author of Acting Like a Woman in Modern Japan: Theater, Gender and Nationalism, and Japanese Feminist Debates: A Century of Contention on Sex, Love, and Labor.\n\nCasting: Maximum (2 separate casts): 6W, 2M (8) // Minimum: 3W, 1M (4). The plays cast well in repertory.\n\nProducing Considerations: As of September 2020, these translations have yet to have their world premiere. Each short play is 15-35 minutes in length. Restless Night in Late Spring could stand alone in a digital experience. While these plays have universally relevant themes and characterizations, they were originally written by a Japanese woman for Japanese audiences. We encourage producers to thoughtfully investigate that historical and cultural context and to take it into serious consideration when making casting choices.\n\nLicensing: Contact the Wylie Agency & Ayako Kano (translator) for performance rights.\n\nSpunk\n\nby Zora Neale Hurston (1935)\n\nIf you’re dreaming about a combination of the musical folklore of Hadestown and Oklahoma… Spunk is a theatrical event (with music). An expansion of her well-loved short story (but with a more joyous ending), this play centers on the relationship between a married woman and a loveable wandering musician named Spunk. It is a humorous, moving portrait of a small-town Black community in the 1930s. Filled with music, magic, and folklore, Spunk manages to be epically theatrical whilst remaining grounded and endearingly quotidien. It is a love letter to small towns, the Black communities in the South, and the wanderers and romantics in us all.\n\nZora Neale Hurston (1891-1960) was one of the most influential, inspired, and well-known writers of the Harlem Renaissance. Her writing is characterized by her authentic portraits of contemporary African American and Black culture and communities, lyrical writing style, and roots in folktales and magical realism.\n\nCasting: Maximum 5+ W, 12+ M (17+) // Minimum 4W, 8M (12)\n\nProducing Considerations: This play requires a composer/music director knowledgeable about Black music traditions and at least one strong actor/musician (singer/guitarist). This is a star vehicle for the actor playing Spunk. Casting can swell beyond the maximum if desired. Additionally, there is a conjuring scene that includes the stage direction of a man unzipping his skin onstage and stepping out of it while “cat men” dance around him. However, Hurston herself notes that this scene “cannot be fully put on paper. Must be done in direction.” Please note: There is potential confusion with another adaptation of Hurston’s short story also entitled “Spunk” by George C. Wolf. These are different plays with similar spirits.\n\nLicensing: Public Domain\n\nWedding Band: A Love Story in Black and White\n\nby Alice Childress (1962)\n\nIf you want to take on the pandemic, privilege, and systemic racism with grace and heart… then you need to look to Alice Childress. A compassionate yet candid look at the complexities of prejudice, Wedding Band focuses on love and the forces that try to tear it down. The play follows Julia, a Black woman, through the complexities of an interracial relationship in 1918 Charleston, South Carolina. This generous community of Black women navigate an Influenza outbreak, war abroad, and war at home.\n\nAlice Childress (1916-1994) is known to be the only Black woman to have written, produced, and published plays for four decades. She turned to playwriting, after eleven years of acting, to engage more directly with her audience. She dedicated her work to representing the Black experience as honestly as possible.\n\nCasting: Minimum/Maximum: 8W, 3M\n\nCasting Consideration: Casting is race specific: 4 Black women, 2 white women, 1 white girl, 1 Black girl, 1 Black man, 2 white men\n\nProducing Consideration: One location, 105 minutes.\n\nLicensing: Concord Theatrical"
