Giorgos Konstadinou also known as Giorgos Konstantinou, (Greek: Γιώργος Κωνσταντίνου) born October 27 1934 in Athens is a popular Greek actor and director. His career success was boosted and critically changed after the notorious "Profiterol" sketch and reached his pinnacle at the retro comedy film THE...Kopanoi. However after that era, tired and unable to express any innovative skills, he resorted in acting and directing an ample number of theater plays widely considered debacles. Still, he exhibited true strength and tenacity by surviving in the TV and theater scene for all these years.
