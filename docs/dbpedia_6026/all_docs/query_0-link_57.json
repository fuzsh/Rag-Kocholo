You know: pioneers and mountain men, buffalo hunters and outlaws, sodbusters and gold-prospectors, stagecoach drivers and pony-express riders, gamblers and schoolmarms; folks in covered wagons crossing the unspoiled wilderness of 19th-century America; cowboys on horseback, fighting off Red Indians; men in hats duelling with sixguns outside the swing-doors of small-town saloons. The reason I ask is because the western’s fate as a popular genre of fiction may have some bearing on the fate of science fiction, with its quite different imagery of bug-eyed monsters and superweapons, robots and space- ships, alien planets, time machines, biospheric disasters, otherworldly societies and future cities. It occurred to me recently, while browsing through a reprint of Edward Buscombe’s The BFI Companion to the Western and one or two other books, that the western is almost exactly forty years older than science fiction - and that the histories of the two fields parallel each other in many ways. If the “shapes” of their careers as genres are congruent, then in the history of the last forty years of the western we may see the outlines of science fiction’s future. What will happen to sf in the four decades to come may be very similar to what has happened to the western in the four decades just past. The Shapes of Genres Allow me to explain briefiy why I see the two fields as similar in shape. James Fenimore Cooper {The Pioneers [1823], The Last of the Mohicans [1826]) was to the western what Jules Verne {Journey to the Centre of the Earth [1864], From the Earth to the Moon [1870]) was to science fiction: its first great practitioner and its initial creative force. Of course, we all know that the term “science fiction” did not exist in the 1860s when Verne began writing his voyages extraordinaires - but nor did the term “western” exist forty years earlier when Cooper began writing his Leatherstocking Tales. Both writers inspired a host of imitators, and it was in that process of emulation and variation that the respective genres gradually emerged. The founding fathers of the two genres gained some literary esteem, as well as enormous international success in a more commercial sense. Some of their immediate followers shared in that esteem and success. But then a curious thing happened to both genres: they went underground, and became “invisible” to middle-class literary taste. In the case of the western (born in the 1820s), this began to happen in the 1860s, with the invention of a new cheap format of fiction-publishing for a mainly working-class and juvenile readership - the so-called dime novel (paper-covered booklets or pamphlets issued on a weekly or monthly basis). In the case of science fiction (born in the 1860s), it began to happen in the open- ing decades of the 20th century with the invention of another new fiction- publishing format - the pulp magazine (thick magazines with spines, printed on the cheapest available paper). The western disappeared into the dime novels and wandered in that wilderness for forty years, during which many of its hardiest conventions and cliches were formulated; and likewise science fiction disappeared into the pulps for a similar period of time, during which it too gathered most of its accretion of stock images and formulae. But both genres were to have a liter- ary heyday, when they emerged once more into the sun of middle-class acceptance - and, again, those glory days were, roughly speaking, forty years apart. With the western, this happened in the 1910s and 1920s, with the arrival of best-selling writers such as Clarence E. Mulford {Hopalong Cassidy^ 1910), Zane Grey {Riders of the Purple Sage, 1912) and Max Brand {The Untamed, 1918) - Owen Wister’s The Virginian (1902) had been a slightly earlier sign of respectability. It is to this period that the very term “western,” as a label for a widely-recognized type of popular fiction, belongs; and this process of naming is one reason why some people say (erroneously) that the western “began” with The Virginian. Science fiction’s comparable heyday was in the 1950s and 1960s, when writers such as Heinlein and Asimov, Bradbury and Sturgeon, Wyndham and Clarke, all emerged from the pulps to the new honour of hardcover publication and respectful newspaper reviews. The term “science fiction” (soon followed by its ugly contraction “sci-fi”) first became common currency in the early 1950s. (It had been in use among pulp fans before that date, but went unrecog- nized by a more general public - see Damon Knight’s introduction to his anthology A Century of Science Fiction for more on this point.) Just as the western had been the “in” genre of the 1910s, with Zane Grey, for example, far outselling his contemporary Edgar Rice Burroughs, so science fiction became the in-thing of the 1950s, in book form at any rate: it was perceived as being new, young, vital, full of . promise, the “literature of the future.” The Dominance of Film and TV Meanwhile, the western, after enjoying its long summer of the 1920s, 30s and 40s, entered a new phase in the 1950s (at the same moment science fiction was experiencing its first publishing boom). What happened then was that the western became primarily a cine- matic form. Of course, there had been many, many western movies before 1950, but the vast bulk of them had been cheaply-made “oaters,” series B- movies of small consequence - horse operas, in fact. What was new in the 1950s was the coming of the screen “super-western”: High Noon, Shane, The Searchers, The Big Country, The Magnificent Seven and numerous other films which were among the most respected of their day (and among the highest grossers). To film critics, it is a statement of the obvious to say that the 1950s was the Decade of the Western. And the western’s success on the big screen was soon followed by a stampede of television examples of the form - Gunsmoke, Cheyenne, Wagon Train, Rawhide, Bonanza, The Virginian (pale shadow of Wister’s original) and literally scores of other westerns thun- dered across the world’s TV screens, lasting well into the 1960s and 70s. Throughout this film-and-TV-domina- ted phase new westerns continued to be published in book form as well, but a growing percentage of these books were spinoffs of one kind or another - a good example is the “Dollars” series of paperback-originals, inspired by the Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns of the 1960s, which in turn inspired the lengthy “Edge” series by G. G. Gilman (British author Terry Harknett) and others of its ilk. This period can be seen as an Indian summer for western writers - so long as they were willing to emulate what they and their public saw on the screen (large or small). So, if the print western enjoyed a 1910s and 20s heyday, followed by a 1930s and 40s high summer, followed by a 1950s and 60s autumn during which it became overshadowed by other media, can we draw the same chart for science fiction, simply by shifting all the dates forty-or-so years further forward in time? I believe we can. If the 1950s represent the sf genre’s heyday, then, by this logic, the 1990s should represent the onset of its autumnal phase, when its printed forms have become secondary to its film and TV forms. In other words, science fiction in the 1990s may be in much the same position that the western was in in the 1950s. Indeed, since Star Wars, sf movies have become more and more dominant - the Aliens films, the Back to the Future movies, the Terminator films, and so on (Kubrick’s 2001 [1968], was a harbinger, just as Ford’s Stage- coach [1939] was a forerunner of the “super-westerns” that would come in the 1950s). Moreover, sf television is 4 interzone September 1995 now gaining full strength, what with the plethora of Star Trek spinoffs, Quantum Leap, Babylon 5, The X-Files and other successful shows. Already one senses that there is a younger generation for whom science fiction means film-and-TV sf before it means books or other written forms. And an ever-greater proportion of the sf books which do get published, and enjoy sales, are movie or TV spinoffs. The End In the 1970s and 80s, all of a sudden (as it seemed), there were no more western series on TV - and precious few western movies in the cinemas. In Britain, the western novel died, quite abruptly, in the mid-1980s (for example, Angus Wells, who had written scores of them under pseudonyms, woke up one day in 1984 to discover that he had no more commissions; that’s why he started to write fantasy, and it’s also why his colleague John Harvey turned to crime fiction). A few genre westerns continue to be published in the USA, but for the most part the western novel exists now only in its handful of “main- stream” examples: Larry McMurtry writes the occasional blockbuster such as Lonesome Dove or Streets of Laredo, and wins Pulitzer Prizes, but these are not published as genre works. It’s the same with films: the occasional Dances With Wolves or Unforgiven may scoop an Oscar, but there are no more run-of- the-mill western movies (or TV shows), just as there are no more mid-list western novels. The western, as a widely popular genre which once supported many hundreds of writers and film-makers, is dead. Will it be the same for science fiction thirty or forty years from now - or even sooner? David Pringle DP being busy with editorial and other projects has left the letters to me. All editorial responses are mine. PB Dear Editors, I had expected Nick Lowe to come in for some criticism for his review of Star Trek: Generations but I was disappointed that the two letters you did print were of the Star Trek anorak variety. I have subscribed to Interzone for long enough to realise that most of your reviewers have strong, personal and informed views which are sometimes forcefully put. Nick Lowe let us all down with a sloppy review - if he was not familiar with the canon then why not discuss the film as a standalone science fiction film. I am, though not a fanatic, never- theless familiar with the characters and their universe and it was difficult for me to decide how good or bad the film was - 1 suspect the latter. And then Gary Dalkin adds insult to injury with his review of Babylon 5. I watch B5 regularly and it is ahead of any TV science fiction I have seen - largely because, although each episode is largely self-contained, there is an overall development of the main plot throughout. It may be watered-down SF and completely embarrassing in parts but it is the best we have in a field that includes the forgettable Dataman and Seaquest DSV. We must hope that Mr Stracz 3 mski can see the whole thing through to its conclusion. I must say that SF is for books - not TV or film or comics. It really doesn’t - or can’t - work in any medium other than the written word. And now the main point. Here is my subscription for the next 12 issues - please keep on doing what you do so well. Paul Garbett North Berwick I have to admit to being astonished by Nick Lowe's review when I typeset it. He not only did not know the context of the story, but also signally failed to note that all of the strong female characters who feature in the TV series were at best sidelined and at worst ignored. Is Holly- wood really so far behind the times'^ I was also astonished that anyone could review Babylon 5. 1 found the first episodes so dull I simply gave up watching it. Whereas Star Trek continues to fascinate me all unwillingly - 1 don't have the time to watch TV at all. PB Greetings O masters of the printed word. A way to increase your subscriptions by tenfold? It came to me by way of serendipity as I lay upon my damask couch. Weeping for the long awaited return of my humble little manuscripts. A vision of the Interzone slush pile reaching unto the very ceiling. Let it be heard. Far and wide. That there is another slush pile, only inches high. Where sit in honoured isolation. Awaiting the immediate attention of the eagle-eyed editors. The manuscripts sent in by - subscribers. Surely this will result in a surge of gold to your needy coffers. Whatever your response to this inspired, freely offered marketing strategy. I shall now pepper you with manuscripts, who’s envelopes will be marked. Subscriber (98). For that is my delivery number. In the faint hope that, one' day, my unconventional sense of humour will spark a response in one of your good selves. Now that’s off my substantial chest, I should like to state that Francis O’Regan’s tale of desperate search in Interaction 97 is no tall story. But is most likely a cut-down version of the grim truth. I suffered the same long, hard search over two years ago. Until, at last. In subterranean cham- bers beneath London’s busy streets. I triumphantly clutched my first copy of Interzone in trembling hands. Welcome to the club of desperate endeavour Francis. Stay strong and true to the cause of looking at the world from an oblique angle. Terry Lovesey Somewhere in the shires. Before it folded, Nexus actually oper- ated this policy. It made no difference to finances or slushpile, so the money ran out, and one of my continuing tasks is responding properly to all the manu- scripts still in the slushpile. Recently, I discovered one of Terry Lovesey's stories there. I was tickled by his humour and his idiosyncratic punctuation, but they haven't clicked with the IZ editors yet. Both he and I live in hope. PB Dear Editors As a latecomer (or should it be new- comer) to this country. I’ve been enjoying Interzone since issue 50. If I agreed about the quality of every story that appears I would start worrying about deterioration of my critical faculties. I must say however that it never fails to deliver stories that stimulate the imag- ination and challenge the intellect. Nick Lowe is a priceless asset, deliv- ering a well thought-out and superbly informed verdict (needless to say I don’t always agree) and John Clute is hugely enjoyable (when his personal bias does not make him infuriating). I already subscribe to far too many magazines to be always on time with my reading of IZ so I can’t comment on individual stories without sounding like I’ve been caught in a back-issue timewarp, but what has kept me buying IZ month after month is the fact that in all this time not once did I feel that the magazine was growing stale or its editors complacent. So keep those editorial instincts sharply honed and don’t worry about the moaners. There is (to borrow a tired cliche) a silent majority that’ll stay with you every step of the way. David Amerland interzone September 1995 5 8th July 1900 Denver, Colorado In spite of the luxuries of American railroad travel, it is a blessing not to be travelling for the next day or two, because I plan to rest in this city before contin- uing my journey. This is the longest continuous break I have ever made from magic: no performances, no practising, no conferences with my ingenieur, no auditions or rehearsals. To the east of Denver lies the great plain, across part of which I came while travelling from Chicago. All day yesterday a wind blew from the southeast, hot and dry and apparently laden with grit. The staff at the hotel complain that it is from the arid neighbouring states, like Oklahoma, but no matter what its source it meant that my explorations of the town were hot and unpleasant. I curtailed them and returned to the hotel. Later in the day, when it was cooler, I went out to the balcony of my room and watched the sun setting behind the stunning peaks of the Rocky Mountains. 10th July 1900 Colorado Springs, Colorado This town is about seventy miles to the south of Denver, but the journey has taken all day in a horse- drawn omnibus. It made frequent stops to take on and put down passengers, to change horses, to change drivers. I felt uncomfortable, prominent and travel-weary. My appearance was probably ridicu- lous, to judge by the expressions on the faces of the farming people who rode with me. However, I have arrived safe and sound, and am immediately charmed by the place in which I find myself It is not anywhere near as large as Denver, but abundantly reveals the care and affection that Americans lavish on their small towns. I have found a modest but attractive hotel, suit- able for my needs, and because I liked my room on sight I have registered for a week’s stay with an option to extend it if necessary. From the window of my room I can see two of the three features of Colorado Springs that have brought me here. The whole town dances with electric lights after the sun has set: the streets have tall lamps, every house has brightly illuminated windows, and in the “downtown” area, which I can see from my room, many of the shops, businesses and restaurants have 6 interzone September 1995 dazzling advertising signs that glisten and flash in the warm night. Beyond them, bulking against the night sky, is the black mass of the famous mountain that stands beside the town: Pike’s Peak, nearly 15,000 feet in height. Tomorrow, I shall make my first ascent of the lower slopes of Pike’s Peak, and seek out the third singular feature that has brought me to this town. 12th July 1900 I was too weary to write in my diary yesterday evening, and I have perforce to spend today alone here in the town, so I have plenty of opportunity to recount at leisure what transpired. I was awake at an early hour, took my breakfast in the hotel, and walked quickly to the central square of the town where my carriage was supposed to be waiting for me. This was something I had arranged by letter before leaving London, and although everything had been confirmed at that time I had no way of knowing for sure that my man would be there for me. To my astonishment, he was. In the casual American manner we quickly became great Mends. His name is itandall D. Gilpin, a Col- orado man bom and bred. I call him Randy, and he calls me Robbie. He is short and round, with a great circling of grey whiskers about his cheerful face. His eyes are blue, his face is burned red ochre by the sun, and his hair, like the whiskers, is steel-grey. He wears a hat made of leather, and the filthiest trousers I have ever seen in my life. He has a Anger missing from his left hand. He carries a rifle under the seat from which he drives the horses, and he told me he keeps it loaded. The route to Nikola Tesla’s laboratory is a steady climb of mixed gradients across the eastern face of the great mountain, the land densely wooded for the first mile or so as the lane wends its way out of the town, but soon thinning into rocky ground support- ing immensely tall and well-spaced firs. The views to the east were vast, but the landscape in this region is so flat and uniformly used that there was virtually nothing scenic at which to marvel. After an hour and a half we came to a plateau, on the northeast face of the mountain, and here no trees grew at all. I noticed many fresh stumps, indi- cating that what few trees had actually once grown here had been recently felled. In the centre of this small plateau, and not nearly as mterxone September 1995 7 Illustrations by Gerry Grace IN A FLASH large as I had been led to believe, was Tesla’s laboratory. ‘Tou got business here, Robbie?” said Randy. ‘Tou watch how you go. It can get darn dangerous up here, from what folks say” ‘T know the risks,” I averred. I negotiated with him briefly, unsure of what arrangements, if any, Tesla himself had for descending to the town, and wanting to be sure that I could later get back to my hotel without difficulty Randy told me that he had business of his own to attend to, but would return to the laboratory in the afternoon and wait for me until I appeared. I noticed that he would not take the carriage too close to the building, and I had to walk the last four or flve hundred yards by myself The laboratory was a square construction with sloping roofs, built with unstained or unpainted wood, showing many signs of impromptu decisions about its design. It appeared that various small extensions had been added after the main structure went up, because the roofs were not all at the same pitch, and in places met at odd angles. A large wooden derrick had been built on (or through) the main roof, and another, smaller rig had been built on one of the side sloping roofs. In the centre of the building, rising vertically, was a tall metal pole that tapered gradually to what would have been a point, although there was no visi- ble apex because at the top there was a large metal sphere. This was glinting in the bright morning sun- shine, and waving gently to and fro in the fresh breeze that was blowing along the mountainside. On each side of the path a number of technical instruments of obscure purpose had been set on the ground. There were many metal poles driven into the stony soil, and most of these were connected to each other with insulated wires. Close by the side of the main building was a wooden frame with a glass wall, inside which I saw several measuring dials or registers. I heard a sudden and violent crackling sound, and from within the building there came a series of bril- liant and horriflc flashes: white, blue-white, pink- white, repeated erratically but rapidly. So flerce were these explosions of light that they glared not only at the one or two windows in my sight, but revealed the tiny cracks and apertures in the fabric of the walls. I confess that at this moment my resolve briefly failed, and I even glanced back to see if Randy and his carriage were still within hailing distance. (No sign of him!) My faint heart became even fainter when, within two or three more steps, I came upon a hand-painted sign mounted on the wall beside the main door. It said: GREAT DANGER Keep Out! As I read this the electric discharges from within died away as abruptly as they had started, and it seemed a positive omen. I banged my flst on the door. After a wait of a few moments, Nikola Tesla him- self opened the door. His expression was the abstracted one of a busy man who has been irritat- ingly interrupted. It was not a good start, but I made the best of it. “Mr Tesla?” I said. “My name is Rupert Angier. I wonder if you recall our correspondence? I have been writing to you from England.” “I know nobody in England!” He was staring behind me, as if wondering how many more Englishmen I had brought with me. “Say your name again, good sir?” “My name is Rupert Angier. I was present at your demonstration in London, and was greatly inter- ested -” “You are the magician! The one Mr Alley knows all about?” “I am the magician,” I confirmed, although the meaning of his second query was for the moment lost on me. “You may enter!” So many impressions about him at once, of course reinforced by my having spent several hours with him after our first exchange. At the time I noticed his face first. It was gaunt, intelligent and hand- some, with strong Slavic cheekbones. He wore a thin moustache, and his lanky hair was parted in the middle. His appearance was in general untended, that of a man who worked long hours and slept only when there was no alternative to exhaustion. Inside the laboratory Tesla introduced me to his assistant, a Mr Alley. This interesting man appears to fulfil many roles in Tesla’s life, from scientific assistant and collaborator, to domestic servant and companion. Mr Alley declared himself to be an admirer of my work! He had been in the audience during my show in Kansas City in 1893, and spoke briefly but knowledgeably about magic. By all appearances the two men work in the labo- ratory alone, with only the astonishing research equipment for company. I ascribe this near-human quality to the apparatus because Tesla himself has a habit of referring to his equipment as if it had thoughts and instincts. Once, yesterday, I heard him say to Alley, “It knows there’s a storm coming”; at another moment he said, “I think it’s waiting for us to start again.” Tesla interrogated me about the use of electricity in Britain, how widespread it was becoming, what was the British government’s commitment to long- term generation and transmission of power, the kinds of transmission being envisioned and the uses to which it was being put. Because I had planned to have this meeting with Tesla, I had done my home- work on the subject before leaving England and was able to converse with him on a reasonably informed level, a fact for which he seemed appreciative. He was especially gratified to learn that many British installations appeared to favour his polyphase sys- tem, which was not the case here in the USA. “Most cities still prefer the Edison system,” he growled, and went into a technical exposition of the failings of his rival’s methods. I sensed that he had rehearsed these sentiments many times in the past, and to lis- teners better equipped than I to take them in. The upshot of his complaint was that in the end people would come around to his alternating current sys- 8 interzone September 1995 CHRISTOPHER PRIEST tern, but that they were wasting a lot of time and opportunities while they did so. On this subject, and on several others related to his work, he sounded humourless and forbidding, but at other times I found him delightful and amusing company. Eventually, the focus of his questions turned to myself, my career, my interest in electricity, and to what uses I might wish to put it. I had resolved, before leaving England, that were Tesla to enquire into the secrets of my illusions he would be one person to whom I would make an exception and reveal anything in which he might show interest. It seemed only right. When I had seen his lecture in London he had had all the appearance of a member of my own profession, taking the same delight in surprising and mystifying the audience, yet, unlike a magician, being more than willing, anxious even, to reveal and share his secrets. He turned out to be incurious, though. I sensed that nothing would be gained by my harking on the subject. Instead, I let him direct our conversation, and for an hour or two he rambled entertainingly over his con- flicts with Edison, his struggles against bureaucracy and the scientiflc establishment, and most of all his successes. His present laboratory had been funded, in effect, by the work of the past few years. He had installed the first water-powered city-sized electricity generator in the world; the generating station was at Niagara Falls, and the beneficiary city was Buf- falo. It is true to say that Tesla had made his fortune at Niagara, but like many men of sudden wealth he wondered how long he could make last what he had. As gently as I could I kept the conversation cen- tred on money, because this is one of the few sub- jects where our interests genuinely meet. Of course he would not impart details of his finances to me, a virtual stranger, but funding is clearly a preoccupa- tion. He mentioned J. Pierpoint Morgan, his present sponsor, several times. I have said little of the dominant feature of his laboratory. All through the long conversation we were overshadowed by the bulk of his Experimental Coil. Indeed, the entire laboratory can be said to be the Coil, for there is little else there apart from recording and calibrating apparatus. The Coil is immense. Tesla said that it had a diam- eter in excess of fifty feet, which I can well believe. Because the interior of the laboratory is not brightly lit the Coil has a gloomy, mysterious presence, at least while it is not being used. Constructed around a central core (the base of the tall metal pole that I had seen protruding through the roof), the Coil is wound around numerous wooden and metal battens, in a complexity that increases the closer in to the core you explore. With my layman’s eyes I could make no sense of its design. The effect was to a large extent that of a bizarre cage. Everything about it and around it seemed haphazard. For instance, there were several ordinary wooden chairs in the laboratory, and sev- eral of these were in the immediate vicinity of the Coil. As indeed were many other bits and pieces: papers, tools, scraps of dropped and forgotten food, even a grubby-looking kerchief I duly marvelled at the Coil when Tesla conducted me around it, but it was impossible for me then to understand any of it. All I grasped was that it was capable of using or transforming huge amounts of electricity. The power for it is sent up the mountain from Colorado Springs below; Tesla has paid for this by installing the town generators himself! ‘T have all the electricity I want!” he said at one juncture. “As you will probably And during the evenings.” I asked him what he meant. “You will notice that from time to time the town lights momentarily dim. Sometimes they even go off altogether for a few seconds. It means we are at work up here! Let me show you.” He led me out of the ramshackle building and across the uneven ground outside. After a short distance we came to a place where the side of the mountain dropped steeply away, and there, a long way below, was the whole extent of Colorado Springs, shimmer- ing in the summer heat. “If you come up here one night Til demonstrate,” he promised. “With a pull on one lever I can plunge that whole city into the dark.” As we headed back, he said, ‘You must indeed visit me one night. Night-time is the flnest time in the mountains. As you have no doubt observed for your- self the scenery here is on a grand scale but intrinsi- cally lacking in interest. To one side, nothing but rocky peaks; to the other, land as flat as the top of a table. It is a mistake to look down or around. The real interest is above us!” He gestured towards the sky. “I have never known such clarity of air, such moon- light. Nor have I ever seen such storms as occur here! I chose this site because of the frequency of storms. There is one coming at this moment, as it happens.” I glanced around me, looking for the familiar sight of the piling anvil-topped cloud in the distance, or, if closer, the black mass of rain-bearing cloud that darkens the sky in the minutes before a storm actu- ally breaks, but the sky was an untrammelled blue in every direction. The air, too, remained crisp and lively, with no hint of the ominous sultriness that always presages a downpour. “The storm will arrive after seven this evening. In fact, let us examine my coherer, from which we can ascertain the exact time.” We walked back to the laboratory. As we did so I noticed that Randy Gilpin and his carriage had arrived, and were parked well away from where we were. Randy waved to me, and I waved back. Tesla indicated one of the instruments I had noted earlier. “This shows that a storm is currently in the region of Central City, about 80 miles to the north of us. Watch!” He indicated a part of the device that could be seen through a magnifying lens, and jabbed a Anger at it at odd moments. After peering at it for a while I saw what he was trying to indicate - a tiny electrical spark was bridging the visible gap between two metal studs. “Each time it sparks it is registering a flash of interxone September 1995 9 IN A FLASH lightning,” Tesla explained. “Sometimes I will note the discharge here, and more than an hour later I will hear the thunder rumbling in from far away.” I was about to express my disbelief when I remem- bered the intense seriousness of the man. He had moved to another instrument, next to the coherer, and noted down two or three readings from it. I fol- lowed him to it. “Yes,” he said. “Mr Angier, would you be good enough to look at your timepiece this evening, and note the moment it happens to be when you see the first fiash of lightning. By my calculation it should be between 7.15 p.m. and 7.20 p.m.” “You can predict the exact moment?” I said. “Within about five minutes.” “Then you could make your fortune with this alone!” I exclaimed. He looked uninterested. “It is peripheral,” he said. “My work is purely experimental, and my main concern is to know when a storm is going to break so that I might make the best use of it.” He glanced over to where Gilpin was waiting. “I see your carriage has returned, Mr Ang- ier. You plan to make another visit to see me?” “I came to Colorado Springs for one reason only,” I said. “That is so that I might put a business proposi- tion to you.” “The best kind of proposition, in my experience,” Tesla said gravely. “I shall expect you the day after tomorrow.” He explained that today was going to be taken up by a trip to the railhead to collect some more equipment. With this I departed, and in due course returned with Gilpin to the town. I must record that at exactly 7.19 p.m. there was a fiash of lightning visible in the town, followed soon after by a crack of thunder. There then began one of the more spectacular storms it has been my lot to experience. During the course of it I ventured on to the balcony of my hotel room, and looked up at the heights of Pike’s Peak for some glimpse of Tesla’s laboratory. All was darkness. 13th July 1900 Today Tesla gave me a demonstration of his Coil in operation. At the start he asked me if I was of a nervous dispo- sition, and I said I was not. Tesla then gave me an iron bar to hold, one that was connected to the fioor by a long chain. He brought to me a large glass dome, apparently filled with smoke or gas, and put it on the table before me. While I continued to hold the iron rod in my left hand, I placed, at his direction, the palm of my right hand against the glass chamber. Instantly, a brilliant light burst out inside the dome, and I felt every hair on my arm rise proud from my skin. I pulled back in alarm, and the light immediately van- ished. Noticing Tesla’s amused smile, I returned my hand to the glass and held it there steadily as the uncanny radiance burst forth once more. There followed several more such experiments, some of which I had seen Tesla himself demonstrat- ing in London. Determined not to reveal my nervous feelings, I endured the electrical discharging of each piece of apparatus stoically. Finally, Tesla asked me if I should care to sit within the main field of his Experimental Coil while he raised its power to twenty million volts! “Is it entirely safe?” I enquired, but jutting my jaw a little, as if I were accustomed to taking risks. “You have my word, sir. Is this not why you have come to see me?” “Indeed it is,” I confirmed. Tesla indicated I should sit on one of the wooden chairs, and I did so. Mr Alley also came forward. He was dragging one of the other chairs, and he placed it beside me and sat down. He handed me a sheet of newspaper. “See if you can read by unearthly light!” he said, and both he and Tesla chuckled. I was smiling with them as Tesla brought down a metal handle and with an ear-shattering crashing noise there was a sudden discharge of electrical power. It burst out from the coils of wire above my head, folding out like the petals of some vast and deadly chrysanthemum. I watched in stupefaction as these jerking, spitting electrical bolts curved first up and around the head of the coil, then began mov- ing down towards Alley and myself, as if seeking us as prey. Alley remained still beside me, so I forced myself not to move. Suddenly, one of the bolts touched me, and ran up and down the length of my body as if tracing my outline. Again, my skin horrip- ilated, and my eyes were scorched by the light, but otherwise there was no pain, no burning sensation, no feeling of electrical shock. Alley indicated the newspaper I was still clutching, so I held it before me and discovered, sure enough, that the radiance from the electricity was more than bright enough to read by. As I held the page before me, two sparks ran across its surface, almost as if an attempt was being made to ignite the paper. Marvel- lously, miraculously, the page did not burn. Afterwards, Tesla suggested I might like to take another short walk with him, and as soon as we were outside in the open air he said, “Sir, let me con- gratulate you. You are brave.” “I was determined not to show my true feelings,” I demurred. Tesla told me many visitors to his laboratory were offered the same demonstrations I had just seen, but that few of them seemed ready to submit themselves to the imagined ravages of electrical discharge. “Maybe they have not seen your demonstrations,” I suggested. “I know you would not risk your own life, nor indeed that of someone who has travelled all the way from Great Britain to make you a business offer.” “Indeed not,” said Tesla. “Perhaps now is the time when we should quietly discuss business. May I beg details of what you have in mind?” “This is what I am not entirely sure about I began, and paused, trying to formulate the words. “Do you propose to invest in my researches?” “No, sir, I do not,” I was able to say. “I know that you have had many experiences with investors.” 10 interzone September 1995 CHRISTOPHER PRIEST ‘That indeed I have. I am thought by some to be a difficult man to work with, and very little I have in mind is likely to turn a short-term profit for an investor. It is something that has in the past caused vexed relationships.” “And in the present too, may I dare to venture? Mr Morgan was clearly on your mind when we spoke the other day.” “Mr J.P. Morgan is indeed a current preoccupation.” “Then let me say candidly that I am a wealthy man, Mr Tesla. I hope I might be able to assist you.” “But not by investment, you say.” “By purchase,” I replied. “I wish you to build me an electrical apparatus, and if we can agree a price I shall gladly pay for it.” We had been strolling around the circumference of the cleared plateau on which the laboratory stands, but now Tesla came to a sudden halt. He struck a pose, staring thoughtfully towards the trees that covered the rising side of the mountain ahead of us. “Which piece of apparatus do you require?” he said. “As you have seen my work is theoretical, experimental. None of it is for sale, and everything I am using at present is invaluable to me.” “Before I left England,” I said, “I read an article about your work in The Times. In the article it was said that you had discovered on a theoretical basis that electricity might be transmitted through the air, and that you planned to demonstrate the principle in the near future.” Tesla was watching me fiercely while I spoke, but having declared my interest to such an extent I had to go on. “Would this be true?” I stared directly into Tesla’s eyes as I asked this final question, and saw that another great change had come across his features. Now his expression and gestures became animated and expressive. “Yes, it is entirely true!” he cried, and at once launched into a wild account of what he planned. Once thus begun he was unstoppable! He strode off in the direction we had been heading, speaking quickly and excitedly, making me trot to keep up with him. We were circling the laboratory at a distance, with the great balled spire constantly in view. Tesla ges- ticulated towards it several times while he spoke. The essence of what he said was that he had long ago established that the most efficient way of trans- mitting his polyphase electrical current was to boost it to high voltages and direct it along high-tension cables. Now he was able to show that if the current was boosted to an even greater voltage then it became of extremely high frequency, and no cables at all would be required. The current would be sent out, radiated, cast broadly into the aether, whereupon by a series of detectors or receivers the electricity could be captured once more and turned to use. “Imagine the possibilities, Mr Angier!” Tesla declared. “Every appliance, every utility, every con- venience known to man or imaginable by him will be propelled by electricity that emanates from the air!” Tesla launched into a litany of possibilities: light, heat, hot-water baths, food, houses, amusements, automobiles ... all would be electrically powered in some mysterious and undescribed way. intenone September 1995 11 IN A FLASH “You have this working?” I asked. “Without question! On an experimental basis, you understand, but the experiments are repeatable by others, should they bother to try, and they can be controlled. This is no phantasm! Within a few years I shall be generating power for the whole world in the way that at present I power the city of Buffalo!” We had circled the large area of ground twice while this exposition poured out of him, and I kept my pace beside him, determined to let his scientific rapture run its course. Finally it did. “Do I understand you wish to buy this apparatus from me, Mr Angier?” he said. “No, sir,” I replied. “I am here to ask for another purchase.” “I am fully engaged in the work I am describing!” “I appreciate that, Mr Tesla. I am seeking some- thing new. Tell me this: if electrical energy may be transmitted, could physical matter also be sent from one place to another?” The steadiness of his answer surprised me. He said, “Energy and matter are but two manifestations of the same force. Surely you realize this?” “Yes, sir,” I said. “Then you already know the answer. Though I must add that I cannot see why anyone should wish to transmit matter.” “But could you make me the apparatus that would achieve this?” “How much mass would be involved? What weight would there be? What size object?” “Never more than two hundred pounds,” I said. “And the size... let us say two yards in height, at most.” He waved a hand dismissively. “What sum are you offering me?” “What sum do you require?” “I desperately need 8,000 dollars, Mr Angier.” I could not prevent myself laughing aloud. It was more than I had planned, but still it was within my means. Tesla looked apprehensive, apparently think- ing me mad, and backed away from me a little... but only a few moments later we were embracing on that windy plateau, clapping our hands against each other’s shoulders, two needs meeting, two needs met. As we drew apart, and clasped hands in contract together, a loud peal of thunder rang out somewhere in the mountains behind us, and rolled around us, rumbling and echoing in the narrow passes. 14th July 1900 Tesla drives a harder bargain than I had reckoned. I am to pay him not eight but ten thousand dollars, a small fortune by any standards. It seems he sleeps on important matters just like ordinary men, and awoke this morning with the realization that the $8,000 would cover only the shortfall he was bearing before I arrived. My apparatus will cost more. Beside this, he has demanded that I pay him a goodly per- centage in cash, and in advance. I have $3,000 I can produce in cash, and can raise another three with the bearer bonds I have brought with me, but the remainder will have to be sent from England. Tesla agreed promptly to the arrangement. Today he has quizzed me more closely about what I require of him. He is incurious about the magical effect I plan to achieve, but is concerned instead with practicalities. The size of the apparatus, the source of power for it, the weight it will need to be, the degree of portability required. I find myself admiring his anal 3 dical mind. Portabil- ity was one aspect I had not thought about at all, but of course this is a critical factor for a touring magician. He has already drawn up rough plans, and has banished me to the distractions of Colorado Springs for two days, while he visits Denver to acquire the constituent parts. But he works slowly! I am anxious about the passage of time. Naively I had thought that once I commissioned him it would be a matter of hours before he produced the mechanism I required. I see, by the abstracted expression he bears as he mutters to himself, that I have started a process of invention that might know no practical end. (In an aside, Mr Alley confirmed that Tesla sometimes worries at a problem for months.) I have firm bookings in England in October and November, and must be home well before the first of them. 21st July 1900 Tesla’s work apparently proceeds well. I am allowed to visit his laboratory every two days, and although I have seen something of the apparatus there has been no question yet of a demonstration. Today I found him tinkering with his research experiments. He seemed abstracted by them and was partly irri- tated and partly puzzled to see me. 4th August 1900 Violent thunderstorms have been playing around Pike’s Peak for three days, casting me into gloom and frustration. I know that Tesla will be involved with his own experiments, not with mine. ’ The days are slipping by. I must be on the train out of Denver before the end of this month! 8th August 1900 Tesla told me on my arrival at the laboratory this morning that my apparatus was ready for demon- stration, and in a state of great excitement I readied myself to see it. When it came to it, though, the thing refused to function, and after I had watched Tesla fiddling with some of the wiring for more than three hours I returned here to the hotel. I am told by the First Colorado Bank that more of my money should be available in a day or two. Per- haps that will spur Tesla to greater efforts! 12th August 1900 Another abortive demonstration today. I was disap- pointed by the outcome. Tesla . seemed puzzled, claiming that his calculations could not be in error. The failure is briefiy recorded. The prototype apparatus is a smaller version of his Coil, with the wiring arranged in a different fashion. After a pro- longed lecture about the principles (none of which I 12 interzone September 1995 CHRISTOPHER PRIEST understood, and which I soon came to realize was delivered by Tesla mainly for his own sake, a form of thinking aloud), Tesla produced a metal rod which he or Mr Alley had painted in a distinctive orange colour. He placed it on a platform, immediately beneath a kind of inverted cone of wiring; the apex of the cone focused directly on the rod. When at Tesla’s instruction Mr Alley worked a large lever situated close by the original Coil, there was the noisy but now familiar outburst of arcing electrical discharge. Almost at once the orange rod was surrounded by blue-white fire, which snaked around it in a most intimidating way. (I, thinking of the illusion I wished to work on the stage, was quietly satisfied by the appearance of this.) The noise and incandescence built up quickly, and soon it seemed as if molten particles of the rod itself were splashing to the fioor; that they were not was evidenced by the unchanged, unharmed appearance of the rod. After a few seconds Tesla waved his hands dramati- cally, Mr Alley threw back the control lever, the electric- ity instantly died away, and the rod was still in place. Tesla immediately became absorbed in the mys- tery, and, as has happened before, my presence was thereafter ignored. Mr Alley has recommended me to stay away from the laboratory for a few days, but I am acutely conscious of time running out. I wonder if I have sufficiently impressed this upon Mr Tesla? 18th August 1900 Today is notable less for a second failed demonstra- tion than for the fact that Tesla and I have argued with some bitterness. This quarrel happened in the immediate aftermath of his machine’s failure to work, and so we were both keyed up, I with disap- pointment, Tesla with frustration. After the orange-painted rod had failed to move again, Tesla picked it up and offered it to me to hold. A few seconds before it had been bathed in radiant light, with sparks flying in every direction. I took it from him gingerly, expecting my fingers to be singed by it. Instead, it was cold. This is the odd thing: it was not just cool, in the sense that it had not been heated, but actively cold, as if it had been sur- rounded by ice. I hefted the rod in my hand. “Any more failures like this, Mr Angier,” Tesla said, in a friendly enough voice, “and I might be obliged to give you that as a souvenir.” “I shall take it,” I replied. “Although I should pre- fer to take with me what I came here to buy.” “Given enough time I shall move the Earth.” “Time is what I do not have much of,” I riposted, tossing the rod to the fioor. “And it is not the Earth I wish to move. Nor is it this metal stick.” “Then pray name your preferred object,” Tesla said, with sarcasm. “I shall concentrate on that instead.” At that moment I felt impelled to release some of the feelings I have been holding back for several days. “Mr Tesla,” I said. “I have stood by while you have been using a chunk of metal, assuming that you needed to do so for experimental purposes. Is it my understanding, at this belated moment, that you could be using something else instead?” “Within reason, yes.” “Then why do you not build the thing to do what I require?” “Because, sir, you have not expressly described your requirements!” “They do not involve the sending of short iron sticks,” I said hotly. “Even if the contraption were to work in the way I thought I had specified, it would be of little use to me. I wish it to transmit a living body! A man!” “So you wish me to demonstrate my failures not on a hapless iron rod, but on a human being? Whom do you nominate for this dangerous experiment?” “Why should it be dangerous?” I said. “Because all experiment is risky.” “I am the one who will be using this.” “You wish to submit yourself?'' Tesla laughed with brittle menace. “Sir, I shall require the remainder of your money before I start experimenting on you!” “It is time for me to leave,” I said, and turned away, feeling angry and chastened. I pushed past him and Alley, and made it to the outside. There was no sign of Randy Gilpin but I strode off anyway, determined if necessary to walk the whole way down to the town. “Mr Angier, sir!” Tesla was standing at the door to his laboratory. “Let us not exchange hasty words. I should have explained properly to you. Had I but known that you wished to transmit living organisms, you would not have presented me with such a challenge. It is difficult to deal with massy, inorganic compounds. Living tissue is not of the same order of problem.” “What are you saying?” “If you wish me to transmit an organism, please return here tomorrow. It shall be done.” I nodded my confirmation then continued on my way, stepping on the loose gravel of the path that descended the mountainside. I expected to meet Gilpin on the way down, but even should he not appear I was an 3 ^ay determined to make the most of the exercise. The road snaked down the mountain in a series of sharp bends doubling back on each other, often with a precipitous drop to the side. When I had walked about half a mile my attention was caught by a fiash of colour in the long grass beside the track, and I stopped to investigate. It was a short iron rod, painted orange, apparently identical to the one Tesla had been using. Thinking I might after all keep a souvenir of this extraordinary meet- ing with Tesla, I picked it up, brought it down the mountain, and I have it with me now. 19th August 1900 I found Tesla in a mood of despond when Gilpin deposited me at the laboratory this morning. “I fear I am about to let you down,” he said to me when he came to the door. “Much work remains, and I know how pressing is your return to Britain.” “What has occurred?” I inquired, glad that the anger that fiared between us yesterday was a thing of the past. “I believed it would be a simple matter with life organisms. The structure is so much simpler than that of the elements. Life already contains minute intcrzone September 1995 13 IN A FLASH amounts of electricity. I was working on the assump- tion that all I had to do was boost that energy. I am at a loss as to why this has not worked! The compu- tations worked out exactly. Come and see the evi- dence for yourself” Inside the laboratory I noticed Mr Alley was adop- ting a stance I had never associated with him before: he stood in bellicose fashion, arms folded protective- ly, jaw jutting pugnaciously, a man angry and defen- sive if ever I saw one. Beside him on the bench was a small wooden cage, containing a diminutive black cat with white whiskers and paws, presently asleep. As his eyes were fixed on me as I walked in, I said, ‘'Good morning, Mr Alley!” ‘T hope you will not be a party to this, Mr Angier!” Alley cried. ‘T brought my children’s cat on the firm promise that it would not be harmed. Mr Tesla gave me an exact assurance last night! Now he insists that we submit the wretched creature to an experi- ment that will undoubtedly kill it!” ‘T don’t care for the sound of this,” I said to Tesla. “Nor I. Do you think I am inhumane, capable of torturing one of God’s more beautiful creatures?” He led me to the apparatus, which I immediately saw had been entirely rebuilt overnight. When I was a foot or two away from it, I recoiled in horror! About half a dozen enormous cockroaches, with shiny black carapaces and long antennae, were scattered all around. They were the most repulsive creatures I had ever seen. “They are dead, Angier,” said Tesla, noticing my reaction. “They cannot harm you.” “Yes, dead!” said Alley. “And that’s the rub! He intends me to place the cat in the same jeopardy.” I looked down at the huge and disgusting insects, wary of any sign from them of a return to life. I stepped back again when Tesla nudged at one with the toe of his boot, and turned it over for me to see. “It seems I have built a machine that murders roaches,” Tesla murmured gently. “They are God’s creatures too, and I am made despondent by it all. I did not intend that this device should take life.” “What’s going wrong?” I said to Tesla. “Yesterday you sounded so sure.” “I have calculated and recalculated a dozen times. Alley has checked the mathematics too. It is the night- mare of every experimental scientist: an inexplicable dichotomy between theoretical and actual results. I confess I am confounded. Such a thing has never happened to me before.” “May I see the calculations?” I said. “Of course you may, but if you are not a mathe- matician I fear they will not convey much to you.” He and Alley produced a great loose-leaf ledger in which his computations had been carried out, and together we pored over them for a long time. Tesla showed me, as best I was able to understand, the principle behind them, and the calculated results. I nodded as intelligently as I could, but only at the end, when I could take the calculations for granted and concentrate on the results, did an unexpected glimmering of sense shine through. “You say that this determines the distance?” I said. “That is a variable. For purposes of experimenta- tion I have been using a value of 100 metres, but such a distance is academic, since, as you see, noth- ing I try to transmit travels any distance at all.” “And this value here?” I said, jabbing my finger at another line. “The angle. I have been using compass points. It will direct in any of 360 degrees from the apex of the energy vortex. Again, for the time being that is entirely academic.” “Do you have a setting for elevation?” I asked. “I am not using it. Until the apparatus is fully working I am merely aiming into the clear air to the east of the laboratory. One must be careful not to cause a rematerialization in a position already occu- pied by another mass! I do not care to think what might happen.” I looked thoughtfully at the neatly inscribed mathematics. I do not know the process by which it happened, but suddenly I was struck by inspiration! I dashed out of the laboratory and stared from the doorway due east. As Tesla had said, what lay beyond was mostly clear air, because in this direc- tion the plateau was at its narrowest and the ground began to drop away some ten metres from the path. I moved quickly over and looked downwards. Below me I could glimpse through the trees the pathway snaking down the mountainside. When I returned to the laboratory I went straight to my portmanteau and pulled out the iron rod I had found beside the path yesterday evening. I held it up for Tesla to see. “Your experimental object, I do believe?” I said. “Yes it is.” I told him where I had found it, and when. He hurried across to the apparatus where its twin was lying, discarded in favour of the unlucky cockroaches. He held the two together, and Alley and I stood with him, marvelling at their identical appearance. “These marks, Mr Angier!” Tesla breathed in awe, lightly fingering a criss-cross patch neatly etched into the metal. “I made them so that I might prove by identification that this object had been transmit- ted through the aether. But “It has made a facsimile of itself!” Alley said. “Where did you say you found this, sir?” Tesla demanded. I led the two men outside and explained, pointing down the mountain. Tesla stared in silent thought. Then he said, “I need to see the actual place! Show me!” To Alley he said, “Bring the theodolite, and some measuring tape! As soon as you can!” And with that he set off down the precipitous path, clutching me by my upper arm, imploring me to show him the exact location of the find. I assumed I would be able to lead him straight to it, but as we moved further down the track I was no longer so sure. The huge trees, the broken rocks, the scrubby forest-fioor vegetation, all looked much alike. With Tesla gesticulating at me and gabbling in my ear it was almost impossible to concentrate. I eventually came to a particular turn in the path where the grass grew long, and I paused before it. 14 interzone September 1995 CHRISTOPHER PRIEST Alley, who had been trotting after us, soon caught us up and under Tesla’s directions set up the theodo- lite. A few careful measurements were enough for Tesla to reject the place. After about half an hour we had agreed on another likely site. It was exactly to the east of the laboratory, although of course a substantial distance beneath it. When we took into account the steepness of the mountainside, and the fact that the iron rod would have bounced and rolled on hitting the ground, it did seem that this was a likely position in which it would end up. Tesla was evidently satisfied, and he was deep in thought as we walked back up the mountain to his laboratory. I too had been thinking, and as soon as we were inside once more I said, ‘‘May I make a suggestion?” “I am already greatly indebted to you, sir,” Tesla replied. “Say what you will!” “Since you are able to calibrate the device, rather than simply aim your experiments into the air to the east of us, could you not send them a shorter distance? Perhaps across the laboratory itself, or outside to the area surrounding the building?” “We evidently think alike, Mr Angier!” In all the times I had been with him I had never seen Tesla so cheerful, and he and Alley set to work immediately. Once again I became supernumerary, and went to sit silently at the rear of the laboratory. I have long since fallen into the habit of taking some food with me to the laboratory (Tesla and Alley have the most irregular feeding habits when engrossed by their work) and so I ate the sandwiches made for me by the staff at the hotel. After a longer and more tedious period than I can describe here, Tesla finally said, “Mr Angier, I believe we are ready.” And so it was that I went to examine the appara- tus, for all the world like a member of a theatre audience invited on stage to inspect a magician’s cabinet, and with Tesla I went outside and estab- lished beyond doubt that his designated target area was empty of any metal rods. When he inserted the experimental rod, and manip- ulated his lever, a most satisfactory bang heralded successful completion of the experiment. The three of us rushed outside, and sure enough, there on the grass, was the familiar orange-painted iron rod. “Tomorrow, sir,” Tesla said to me, “tomorrow, and with the consent of my noble assistant here, we shall endeavour to safely transport the cat from one place to another. If that can be achieved, I take it you will be satisfied?” “Indeed, Mr Tesla,” I said warmly. “Indeed.” 15th December 1900 London Most of the past three weeks have been an agony of frustration, because I have been waiting for electric- ity to be supplied to my workshop. I have been like a small boy with a toy I could not play with. The Tesla apparatus has been erected in my workshop ever since I picked it up from Mount Pleasant, but with- interxone September 1995 15 IN A FLASH out a supply of current it is useless. I have read Mr Alley’s lucid instructions a thousand times! How- ever, after my increasingly frequent reminders and urgings, the London Electricity Company has at last done the necessary work. I have been rehearsing ever since, wrapped up mentally and emotionally in the demands this extraordinary device makes on me. Here, in no par- ticular order, is a summary of what I have learned. It is in full working order, and has been inge- niously designed to work on all presently known ver- sions of electrical supply. This means I may travel with my show, even to Europe, the USA and (Alley claims in his instructions) the Far East. However, I cannot perform my show unless the the- atre has electrical current supplied. In future I will have to check this before I accept any new bookings, as well as many other new matters (some of which follow). Portability. I know Tesla has done his best, but the equipment is damnably heavy. From now on, plan- ning the delivery, unpacking and setting up of the apparatus is a priority. It means, for instance, that the simple informality of a train-ride to one of my shows is a thing of the past, at least if I wish to per- form the Tesla illusion. Technical rehearsals. The apparatus has to be erected twice. First for private testing on the morn- ing of the show, then, while the main curtain is down and another act is in progress, it has to be re- erected for the performance. The admirable Alley has included suggestions as to how it might be car- ried out speedily and silently, but even so this is going to be hard work. Much rehearsal will be neces- sary, and I shall require extra assistants. Physical layout of the theatres. I or Adam Wilson will always need to reconnoitre beforehand. Boxing the stage. This is practicably straightfor- ward, but in many theatres it antagonizes the back- stage staff, who for some reason think they have an automatic right to have revealed to them what they consider to be trade secrets. In this case, allowing strangers to see what I am actually doing on stage is out of the question. Again, more preparatory work than usual will be necessary. Post-performance sealing of the apparatus, and private disassembly, are also procedures fraught with risk. I cannot accept any bookings until these proce- dures have been worked out and ensuing problems resolved. All this special preparation! However, careful plan- ning and rehearsal are in the essence of successful stage magic, and I am no stranger to any of them. One small step forward. All stage illusions are given names by their inventors, and it is by these that they become known in the profession. The Three Graces, Decapitation, Cassadaga Propaganda, are examples of three illusions at present popular in the halls. After some thought I have decided to call the Tesla inven- tion In a Flash, and by this it will become known. 14th February 1901 I rehearsed In a Flash twice yesterday, and will do so twice again tomorrow. I dare not make it any more than that. I shall be performing it on Saturday evening at the Trocadero in Holloway Road, then at least once again in the week following. I believe that if I can perform regularly enough then extra rehearsals, beyond stage movements, misdirection and patter, should not be necessary. Tesla warned me that there would be aftereffects, and these are indeed profound. It is no trivial matter to use the apparatus. Each time I pass through it I suffer. In the first place there is the physical pain. My body is wrenched apart, disassembled. Every tiny particle of me is thrown asunder, becoming one with the aether. In a fraction of a second, a fraction so small that it cannot be measured, my body is con- verted into electrical waves. It is radiated through space. It is reassembled at its designated target. Slam! I am broken apart! Slam! I am together again! It is a violent shock that explodes in every part of me, in every direction. Imagine a steel bar smashing into the palm of your hand. Now imagine ten or twenty more hammering down in the same place from different angles. More fall on your fingers, your wrist. A hundred more strike the back of your hand. The ends of your fingers. Every joint. More explode out from inside your flesh. Now spread the pain through your whole body, inside and out. Slam! A millionth of a second of total agony! Slam again! That is how it feels. Yet I arrive in the selected place, and I am exactly as I was that millionth of a second earlier. I am whole in myself, and identical to myself, but I am in the shock of ultimate pain. The first time I used the Tesla apparatus, with no warning of what I was to experience, I collapsed to the floor in the belief that I had died. It did not seem possi- ble that my heart, my brain, could survive such an explosion of pain. I had no thoughts, no emotional reac- tions. It felt as if I had died, and I acted as if I had died. As I slumped to the floor my wife Julia, who of course was there with me for the test, ran to my side. My first lucid memory in the post-death world is of her gentle hands reaching into my shirt to feel for a sign of life. I opened my eyes, in shock and amazement, happy beyond words to find her beside me, to feel her tenderness. Quickly I was able to stand, to reassure her that I was well, to hold her and kiss her, to be myself once more. In truth, then, physical recovery from this brutal experience is itself speedy, but the mental conse- quences are formidable. On the day of that first test I forced myself to repeat it in the afternoon, but as a result I was cast into the darkest gloom for much of the Christmas period. I had died twice. I had become one of the walking dead, a damned soul. Yesterday, in the electrical brightness and famil- iarity of my London workshop, I felt I should undergo two more rehearsals. I am a performer, a professional. I must give an appearance to what I do, give it a sheen and a glamour. I must project 16 intcrxone September 1995 CHRISTOPHER PRIEST myself about the theatre in a flash, and at the moment of arrival I must appear to be a magician who has successfully performed the impossible. To sink to my knees, as if poleaxed, would be out of the question. To reveal even a glimpse of the mil- lionth-second of agony I have endured would also be unconscionable. The point is that I have a double level of sub- terfuge to convey. A magician ordinarily reveals an effect that is “impossible”: a piano seems to disap- pear, a billiard ball magically reproduces itself, a lady is made to pass through a sheet of mirrorglass. The audience of course knows that the impossible has not been made possible. In a Flash, by scientiflc method, in fact achieves the hitherto impossible. What the audience sees is actually what has happened! But I cannot allow this ever to be known, for science has in this case replaced magic. I must, by careful art, make my miracle less miraculous. I must emerge from the elemental transmitter as if I have not been slammed apart, and slammed together again. So I have been trying to learn how to prepare for and brace myself against the pain, how to react to it without keeling over, how to step forward with my arms raised and with a flashing smile to bow and acknowledge applause. To mystify sufficiently, but not too much. I write of what happened yesterday, because last night, when I returned home, I was in too great a despair even to think of recording what had hap- pened. Now it is the afternoon and I am more or less myself again, but already the prospect of two more rehearsals tomorrow is daunting and depressing me. 16th February 1901 I am full of trepidation about tonight’s performance at the Trocadero. I have spent the morning at the theatre, setting up the apparatus, testing it, dismantling it, then locking it away again safely in its crates. After that, as anticipated, came the protracted negotiations with the scene-shifters, actively hostile to my intentions of boxing the stage. In the end, a straightforward cash transaction settled the matter and my wishes prevailed, but it has meant a huge dent in my income for the show. This illusion is clearly only performable if I can demand fees greatly in excess of anything I have earned before. A lot depends on the show tonight. Now I have an hour or two of free time, before I must go back to Holloway Road. I plan to spend part of it with Julia and the children, and try to take a short nap in whatever is left. I am so keyed up, how- ever, that sleep seems only remotely possible. 17th February 1901 Last night I safely crossed the aether from the stage of the Trocadero to the royal box. The equipment worked perfectly. But the audience did not applaud because it did not see what was happening! When finally the applause came it was more bemused than enthusiastic. The trick needs a stronger build-up, a greater sense of danger. And the point of arrival must be picked out with a spotlight, to draw attention to my position as I materialize. I have talked to Adam about it, and he suggests, ingeniously, that I might be able to rig up an electrical spur from the apparatus so that turning on the light is not left to a stagehand but is commanded by me from the stage. Magic always improves. We perform again on Tuesday at the same theatre. I have left the best to last - I was able to disguise completely the shock of the impact on me. Both Julia, who saw the show from the auditorium, and Adam, who was watching from the rear of the stage through a small flap in the box screen, say my recovery was almost flawless. In this case it works to my advantage that the audience was not fully attentive, because only these two noticed the single weakness that occurred (I took one inadvertent step backwards). For myself, I can say that practice with the appa- ratus has meant the terrible shock is not nearly as terrible as before, and that it has been getting slightly better each time I try it. I can foresee that in a month or so I will be able to bear the effect with outward indifference. I also note that the consequent gloom I suffer is much less than after my first attempts. 23rd February 1901 My performance on Tuesday, much improved after the lessons of the weekend, gained me a laudatory review in The Stage, an outcome more to my favour than anything else I can imagine! On the train yes- terday Julia and I read and re-read the words to each other, glorying in the undoubted effect they will have on my career. By our temporary exile here in our Derbyshire house we will not learn of tangible results until we are back in London early next week, when we have finished here. I can wait contented. The children are with us, the weather is cold and brilliant, and the moorland scenery is ravishing us with its muted colours. I feel I am at last approaching the peak years of my career.

The above extract, though it makes for a free-standing and self- explanatory story, forms just a small part of a long, complex and very cunning narrative in which not all is what at first it seems... interzone September 1995 17 C HRISTOPHER PRIEST was horn in 1943 y and published his first short story in 1966 and his first novel. Indoctrinaire, in 1970. In 1983 he was named as one of the ten best Young British Novelists (at the age of 39!) in a Book Marketing Council promotion. He lives in Hastings, on the Sussex coast, with his wife and fellow -writer, Leigh Kennedy, and their five-year-old twins, Elizabeth and Simon. I interviewed him at his home, a few months before the public- ation of his latest novel. The Prestige (due from Simon & Schuster! Touchstone in September 1995). Alan Roche: Chris, your novels The Affirmation and The Glamour, both focus on the unreliability of memory to distinguish fact from fiction, truth from falsehood, an idealized sense of the past from its reality What is it about memory that causes you to use these ideas in your fiction? Christopher Priest: (Looks perplexed and laughs.) Can’t remember! Most fiction is told in the past. But it’s organized; it tells a story. Real memory isn’t like that; it’s much more chaotic. Many of us cannot remember the order our actions took place in, even if we can remember what we actually did. I grew interested in fiction that reflected this. Roche: The way memory functions is linked with different perceptions of reality - the imagined world in conflict with the real world. This conflict seems to be at the heart of much of your work and is obviously very important to you, isn’t it? Priest: I’m fascinated by the different interpretations of the same event witnessed by groups of people. If six people witness a bank robbery you’ll get six different descriptions of what happened. And I’m often intrigued to hear someone describe an event that I have attended and learn that they saw something completely different going on. Roche: Are the ideas which you use to structure your narrative more important to you as themes or for building your plots? Priest: The narrative starts as an idea, a notion for a story. The Glamour was built up from a plot idea that’s admittedly a bit of an old chestnut: is a person responsible for his or her actions when suffering from loss of memory? If you kill someone and can’t remember doing it, are you guilty? By the time I’d worked on that for a bit it had grown into a complicated metaphor where invisibility stood for amnesia. I couldn’t have worked it out from the ground up: I needed a sort of frame- work of plot to think about it. The thing is, all the books I write are connected with my life. Ideas about memory loss and the way in which the real world impinges on the imagined are topics which interest me. Roche: When I first read The Glamour I thought that perhaps the idea arose out of that old saying, “sorry, didn’t see you there.” Priest: Yes, I know what you mean. There are some people who are just not seen. I find the idea of The Glamour very plausible. Roche: In your fiction there is a sense of your characters not being able to distinguish reality from imagination; truth from falsehood. Is this how you see the human predicament? Priest: I think that’s too simplistic. What interests me is the way in which people can make themselves believe as facts things that seem to me demonst- rably untrue. About two years ago I attended a lecture in Hastings about UFOs and alien abduction. I find all that sort of stuff intriguing. But I rapidly came to the conclusion that I was the only person in the room who hadn't been abducted! And I thought - they’re all daft as brushes. But I can’t question their belief Roche: There are no explicit religious or spiritual motifs in you novels, but there is often the sense that your main characters are seeking some definitive truth or reality in what are explicitly secular societies. Would you agree with this? Priest: Yes. But there’s a moral code, you see. That’s a different thing. I’m not an atheist. That requires a strong belief system. Agnosticism appeals to me because I am one of the world’s Don’t Knows. I’m not sure of anything. Roche: What’s your view on readers who say that novels like The Affirmation, The Glamour and The Quiet Woman are not science fiction? 18 interzone September 1995 Priest: I hear this from a lot of people and I can see what they mean. But at the same time, I’ve discovered that the people who seem to appreciate my stuff best are science-fiction readers. It’s a complex subject. Let me explain my feelings, if I can. When I started writing, about 30 years ago, there was a sort of move- ment in science fiction that came from the centre. It involved writers like J. G. Ballard, Tom Disch, Philip K. Dick. These people were taking the “spiritual heart” of science fiction and moving it forward, away from its crappy past into something that promised better. That seemed to me worth doing. The stuff I’ve written ever since has stuck to that principle, has evolved from what I see as the centre of science fiction. But what has happened since is that far from turning their backs on the past, most science-fiction writers now embrace it. Most of the books on the sf shelves in book-shops today reflect that crappy past. You have big and rotten fantasies, TV novelizations and spoofs. Not much else at all; not much that’s serious, anyway. I’m very serious about books. What I feel now is that the heartland of science fiction has been marginalized by a drift into trivia. And I’m now seen as being out on the loony fringe, accused of writing mainstream literature. But I feel that I have stuck to what a lot of us found stimulating about sf in the 1960s. This was that it was a living form of literature which was capable of change and experi- ment, and you could always press on within it, getting better, and more serious, and more adventurous. I don’t think the stuff being published and sold now has a future. How many times can you write a spoof on Dr Who? Roche: On your evidence, Chris, science fiction as a genre is in a pretty bad way. Priest: The genre’s probably dead, or well on the way. “Genre” is the wrong word, but for something like science fiction to have any sort of meaning it has to be a place where new or interesting or difficult writers can work, where they can test the rules. There needs to be more writers like John Sladek, who is one of those writers who doesn’t write sf but who doesn’t write anything else, in the old sense. Roche: When I first read The Affirma- tion, I had no pre-conceived ideas that it was a science-fiction book ^r that you were an sf writer. I read it as a literary or mainstream novel. After I had read The Glamour, The Quiet Woman and then A Dream of Wessex and Inverted World I thought perhaps you had consciously divided your fiction into mainstream and science fiction. But this isn’t true, is it? Christopher Priest interviewed by Alan Roche Priest: No. Iain Banks does that. I don’t know how the hell he does! I just write my own books. I see both The Affirmation and The Prestige as both being “of” science fiction. They’re products of the movement I mentioned earlier. I agree that The Affirmation is not science fiction. But if it’s not - what the hell is it? The trouble, I think, is that the definitions of science fiction are not flexible enough to include novels like The Affirmation and The Glamour. My feelings about that are, “well, stuff the definitions! I just want to write my own books.” Roche: Magic Realism (sharply etched realism with elements of the fantastic and dreamlike) is a label that perhaps could be applied to some elements of your fiction. Would you agree? Priest: Yeah. But I wouldn’t personally apply that term. I think there are only two magic realists worth reading. Neither are British: Milan Kundera and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. I just feel I’m struggling against other people’s prejudices; people who say: “but you don’t write sf ” But what is sf? I don’t know any more. All I know is that I’ve been writing this kind of stuff for about 20 years now, and it’s about time people twigged what I’m on about. Roche: There’s a sense, I believe, among new writers, that if it’s science fiction the story can be as outlandish as you like, that it need make no sense at all - that somehow, because it’s sf, it’s easier to write. Priest: Ha! Well, if they think that they’re wrong. I write one book every four or five years. Simply because I find it hard. I certainly don’t see it as a soft touch and I wish I could write three or four books a year. I find the limitations of the genre interesting. What I do is to push against the edges set by the limitations; distort them, make it uncomfortable for the reader, so that the reader has to deal with the novel on my terms not theirs. Roche: Inverted World gives us a glimpse into a surreal future, rich in images. One which stands out for me is the image of figures walking into the horizon, becoming squatter and flatter the further they walk. The city Earth, which turns out to be a massive IBM-type building on tracks, creates, in my imagination, a tragic-comical image of a dead bureaucracy. Together with the earlier image, it hints at a world crushed under the weight of the inertia that accompanies red tape. Am I being too fanciful? Priest: Well, it’s not what I was think- ing when I was writing it. But there’s a tension between the structure of the plot and the ideas presented to me through my unconscious. If it’s a good bit, and it works, I leave it in. And I feel that this is communicated to the interzone September 1995 19 MYTHIC TEMPLATES reader’s unconscious, too. You tap into a series of archetypes. I’m not an allegorist - but there are allegorical bits in it. There’s a great rawness about Inverted World, which I think is what a lot of people have found attractive about the book. I’m far too inhibited to write like that now. Roche: The images and symbols in Inverted World do add up to suggest the metaphor I mentioned earlier. As a writer do you invent your metaphor first or does it grow organically from the narrative? Priest: The latter. When I’m writing best I’m cruising along with a terrific plot and I’m allowing the unconscious to play its part too. I get into this surfing mentality. Roche: What were the main ideas behind A Dream of Wessex? Priest: It started as an idea about a group of individuals who get together to think about the future. One of them gets stuck there. When I started writing the book I realized I was dealing with sf One aspect of science fiction, of which I totally disapprove, is to do with future histories; the future treated as a reality. It’s not quite predicting the future, but it’s taking the future really seriously. To me the future is completely unknown. Any dealing with the future is a metaphorical approach from the present. Once you realize that sf is a metaphorical approach to your own world, freedom breaks out. You can do all sorts of things with it. And that’s what A Dream of Wessex is all about. Roche: The Space Machine, your homage to H. G. Wells, is written in the tone of a 19th-century writer. Why did you decide to do this? Priest: At the time, the mid-1970s, I wanted to write something a bit different from my usual stuff. My prose was then being regularly described as cold and clear, unfunny and unemoti- onal. Clinical. I just wanted to write a comedy. What I like about Wells is his sense of fun. Roche: In what ways is Wells important to you as a writer? Priest: He’s just a great writer, isn’t he? The trouble with the later Wells is that he fell for the future-history lark. And he started believing in it: as a prophet, as a seer. Then he started hectoring and nagging. I don’t think a writer can influence or protect you from anything. Roche: I’d like to get your opinion on some current trends in fiction. What’s your attitude to the postmodernist approach to narrative as being a commentary on its own fictionality? Priest: Well, it’s a blight on literature. The only postmodernists worth a candle are Kundera, Nabokov and Calvino. I also like John Fowles’s work. But in general, bloody postmodernism has landed on the current British novel like the pox. I think anyone who admires second-raters like Martin Amis should read Kundera and see how the master does it. Roche: The Affirmation could be read, on one level, as a novel describing the process and the struggle of writing fiction: although it is woven within the overall novel. How do you feel about this sort of interpretation? Priest: I get very defensive when I hear people saying, in a lofty way, as they sometimes have, “this is yet another novel about writing novels.” Roche: Yes, but I said “on one level”: it’s just one part of the plot and fits in with the overall theme of memory- loss. What makes this aspect work is its subtlety. Priest: There are good things to be taken from postmodernism and all the other “isms.” Things speak to you. I can’t pretend not to be influenced by Kundera, but I hope that what I take from him is not so much the effects, but the spirit of having a go, of trying out something a bit odd or difficult. Then of assimilating it, making it mine. The Affirmation was written at the beginning of the 1980s, by which time I’d read quite a lot of postmodernist fiction - and formed negative views about it. The instinct in postmodernism to be ironic and to examine the text is worth doing. But I object to the clod- hopping way postmodern techniques are usually used. You know, Peter Ackroyd breaking off from his biography of Dickens to interview himself about the research he had to do. That sort of thing. Roche: Do you think the “personal- ity factor,” engendered by self- publicity, will become of more interest than the writer’s work? Priest: In the end, no. Because publicity goes to the wind. And the books have an annoying habit of sticking around for years and years. I think that self-publicity reveals an insecurity about the work - that somehow it has to be propped up. I mean doing an interview like this is self- publicity. Roche: Some of your earlier work’s dramatic content arises out of the psychological trauma brought about by conflicting interpretations of reality. The Prestige is a departure from these ideas, isn’t it? Priest: Yes. I don’t have a master scheme; I take each novel as it comes. If it’s different from the other stuff it’s because one has to move on. I can’t go back to my earlier novels; I said all I want to say about that sort of subject. I had to break away from those ideas. The Prestige has two narratives dealing with the same event: and the conflict is about comprehension, not about understanding reality. Roche: But you use magic and illusion for a particular reason don’t you? Priest: No. Well, I don’t want to give too much of it away really. I was interested in the concept of twinship... But what The Prestige is really about is secrecy: about the way people will protect a secret - no matter how trivial. Roche: I have had the privilege of reading The Prestige in manuscript, and I enjoyed it immensely. I think others will too. Thanks very much for the interview, Chris. ■ 20 Interzone September 1995 O n the Thursday I drove home from work as usual, leaving the office car park at five past five. I was in a good mood - the phrase “only one more day to go” kept echoing in my head. I was looking forward to the four weeks' leave, thinking of it as an extra holiday. The whole notion of paternity leave seemed so new, so strange, that I couldn't help thinking of it as a stroke of good luck rather than something ordinary, something from which anyone and everyone might benefit. I suppose it was a stroke of luck that the firm was so up-to-date, so enthusiastic to capture and keep its young executives that it had put such provisions into its package. The traffic wasn't too heavy even on that nightmar- ish stretch of the M25 connecting the M3 to the M4, which had temporarily shrunk to three lanes while they were widening it to seven. I got home about 5.40, put the car in the garage, and breezed into the house as if I hadn't got a care in the world. I called out to Ginny but I didn't think anything of it when she didn't call back or rush to meet me - it was difficult for her to do anything in a hurry, being nine months gone. I must have been pottering around downstairs for ten minutes and more before it finally occurred to me that maybe I ought to take a look. I can't describe what it was like to open the bed- room door and see all that blood. She'd actually taken the duvet off the bed and put down two bath- towels, obviously expecting that there'd be some blood and intending to mop it all up, but she could have had no notion of what would actually happen. Both towels were soaked through and the blood had spread out both sides on to the sheet and through to the mattress. She still had the coat-hanger in her hand, with the hook part straightened out and the rest twisted into some bizarre configuration. I honestly thought she was dead. I didn't see how anyone could lose that much blood and not be dead, but it seems these things can be very deceptive. Even though I thought that she was dead, I leapt for the phone beside the bed and punched out 999, hysteri- cally demanding an ambulance. It wasn't until I knew the ambulance was on its way that I tried to take a pulse and realized that she was still breathing. It was then that my fear changed focus, and I felt a cold surge of terror at the thought that the baby must be dead... and it wasn't until the shock of that thought had subsided that I realized that that must have been the whole point - that must have been what she was trying to do. What other reason could a nine-months pregnant woman have for sticking a partially unbent wire coat-hanger up herself, except to carry out a ridicu- lously late abortion? After that, the fear was displaced by something else. It wasn't exactly horror, more a sharply painful sense of not being able to understand, of there being no conceivable explanation. It made no sense, and there seemed to be no possible sense that it could make. It wasn't just that the word why? kept echo- ing inside my head - the worst thing was the aware- ness that the question had no imaginable or excusable answer. The ambulance arrived within five minutes, which was good considering the time of day and the fact that the house is two-and-a-half miles from the hos- pital. The paramedics didn't waste any time. They hooked up a drip before they even tried to move her - not real blood but synthetic stuff, designed to be reaction-free. They must have pumped three or four pints in before they fetched the stretcher to set beside her. They were very careful - they didn't want the bleeding to start again. Neither of them said a word about the coat-hanger. One of them gen- tly took it out of her hand and laid it aside. “Will she be all right?” I asked, while they were strapping her on. I was already tr 3 dng to figure out how they were going to get the stretcher round the bend in the stairs. “I think so,” said the senior paramedic. “It looks worse than it is.” “What about...?” He didn't let me finish. “Can't tell about the baby,” he said. “Touch and go. They're surprisingly tough. Have to see.” They were very clever on the stairs. They took the bend very smoothly, as if they'd had years of practice and as if Ginny weighed nothing at all. We made it to A&E in four minutes fiat, without so much as a bump or a sway. In a way, that was the easy part for me, because I could count it down - every second was a step on the way. Once they wheeled her off into the depths of the department, though, I was stranded in that desolate waiting-area full of drunks and wailing children, not having the slightest idea how long it would be before they'd bring me any news or let me go to see her. I don't mind waiting so much when I know what time I'm aiming for, but sitting there in turmoil, watching the red second hand sweep around and around and around without any sign of progress was hell on earth. interzone September 1995 21 THE SERPENT It was 8.15 when the doctor finally came out. ‘Tour wife’s stable, Mr Coxon,” she said. “The baby’s heart is still beating, and there’s no sign of any damage to the foetus itself, but we’ll have to make a further investigation to determine how much damage has been done to the birth canal. We’ll have to do a Caesarean, but we’ll have to be careful in determining the right time. For the moment, it’s best to leave things as they are, but we’re monitor- ing the situation carefully.” “Can I see her now?” I asked. “In a little while,” she told me. “She’s under seda- tion. She won’t wake up for some hours. You’ll be able to sit with her if you wish, but... I’m afraid there are some questions I must ask you first.” It shouldn’t have come as a shock. I should have spent the previous two hours rehearsing my answers - but when I’d asked myself the question it had seemed so utterly unanswerable that I simply hadn’t gone on to think about what I’d have to say to others in search of an explanation. “I don’t know,” I said, before she could even formu- late the question. “I don’t know why she did it. I can’t imagine.” “Had she been depressed?” the doctor asked. She was trying to be gentle, and there was no accusation in her tone, but her big dark eyes seemed to me to be like black searchlights projecting shadows into my head. “No,” I said, too promptly, and quickly changed the plea. “Well, a little... unusually quiet, tired, drained - but you’d expect that, wouldn’t you? It’s a strain, isn’t it? She was bound to feel awkward, uncomfort- able. She wanted it over, of course she did. She cursed the kid a bit, when she was kicked or got backache... bound to. Nothing serious. Of course she moaned... not nearly as much as I’d have moaned if I’d been blown up like that, with all the other petty discomforts, all the tedious waiting. I thought she was just exhausted, weary, washed out. Not clini- cally depressed. Not desperate.” I don’t suppose the doctor’s eyes were saying any- thing, really, but to me they seemed to be saying: How would you know? How closely have you been watching her? How much time have you given to discussing her feelings? Really discussing them, intimately? Haven't you been consciously drawing away, throwing yourself into your work, glad of the excuse that you had to get things straight before you started your leave? Haven't you been glad these last few weeks that you were bring- ing work home, getting over-tired, so that you didn't have to have too much to do with a wife who'd grown so big, so awkward, so ungainly, so... “We were both looking forward to the baby,” I said, in a sort of anguished stage-whisper. “We both wanted the baby. We had everything set up, everything ready. Cot, pram, clothes, nappies... everything short of redecorating the spare room with Peter the Rabbit wallpaper. There was nothing wrong. Nothing.” It all rang true, inside. I was morally certain that it had been true... except that it plainly wasn’t. All that blood on the bed, and that stupid twisted coat- hanger, were witnesses whose evidence was beyond doubt. Something had been wrong. Very wrong.
