These films have been chosen according to several criteria, including their narrative and visual representation of the future, their significance in shaping the genre, and, not least, the availability of archival collections documenting their production and reception. Projecting Tomorrow has been written to a set of agreed criteria and principles. James Chapman wrote the Introduction and Chapters 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9, while Nick Cull wrote Chapters 1, 5, 8, 10, 11 and 12, and the Afterword. Like Projecting Empire, to which it is to some extent a companion volume, Projecting Tomorrow draws upon extensive research in US and British film archives. We are indebted to many archivists and librarians whose unstinting assistance and exemplary professionalism is only too rarely acknowledged.

In their previous collaboration, Projecting Empire (I.B.Tauris, 2009), they examined the changing representation of imperialism in the cinemas of Hollywood and Britain between the 1930s and the early twenty-first century. In the present volume they have turned their attention to dreams of tomorrow, the imagined futures of science fiction films, both British and American. They have adopted the same approach in this book as in the earlier one-contextual cinematic history. So they scrupulously locate their chosen films in their individual industrial, economic, political, social and cultural contexts. They trace the films’ often fraught and complex production histories and their critical and box office reception. They relate the films to the fiction both of celebrated writers like H. G. Wells and Arthur C. Clarke and the army of authors of pulp fiction and comic strips who have contributed so much to the ideas and themes of science fiction cinema. Their fourteen chosen films range from Just Imagine (1930) with its trip to an inhabited Mars and its satire on prohibition to Avatar (2009) with its unsparing critique of American imperialism and capitalist exploitation. They demonstrate how – appropriately enough – the evolution of the science fiction genre has benefited from the development of more and more advanced cinematic technology, so that epics such as Things to Come in 1936 or Star Wars in 1977 or Avatar in 2009 represent the state of the art. Crucially Chapman and Cull highlight the extent to which contemporary cultural anxieties have been projected onto the future in science fiction cinema: the Cold War and fear of Soviet invasion, the destructive potential of super-weapons, concern about changes in gender relations, the ruthless onward march of corporate capitalism, fear of man-made machines running out of control.\n\nChapman_Prelims.indd xiii\n\n12/12/2012 12:23:42 PM\n\nxiv\n\nProjecting Tomorrow\n\nWe should never underestimate the power of these dreams of tomorrow to influence the audiences of today. Thousands of people now describe themselves on census forms as Jedi knights after the warrior caste in Star Wars and recently a group of Palestinians painted themselves blue and dressed like the Na’vi in Avatar to protest against Israel’s construction of a barrier. In this lovingly researched, thoughtfully argued and vividly readable volume, Chapman and Cull help us to understand better why and how science fiction cinema has extended such power over the imagination of its audiences.

The first recorded public exhibition of motion pictures occurred in Paris on 22 March 1895 when Louis and Auguste Lumière unveiled their new Cinématographe to a meeting of the Société d’Encouragement à l’Industrie Nationale.1 H. G. Wells’s The Time Machine – often regarded as the first modern SF story – was serialized between January and May 1895 before its publication in book form by William Heinemann of London in May.2 Cinema and science fiction were both products of the technological revolution of the late Victorian period. The cinematograph was the ‘last machine’ of the Victorian age, following the telephone (1876), internal combustion engine (1876), cathode ray tube (1878), phonograph (1878) and wireless telegraphy (1894).3 Science fiction also reflected this interest in technology and modernity. What differentiated Wells’s work from previous examples of what at the time was known as ‘scientific romance’ was its insistence on explanatory frameworks based on scientific and philosophical principles (particularly Darwinism) rather than fantasy or magic. To this extent cinema and science fiction were products of the same historical and technological contexts. There were close parallels between Wells’s writing and early cinema. Wells has been claimed as a ‘proto-cinematic’ writer. His work is replete with ‘optical speculations’ such as the disappearing protagonist of The Invisible Man and the Martian death rays in The War of the Worlds.4 A tradition of optical ‘trick’ effects permeated early cinema, particularly in the fantasy films of the French pioneer Georges Méliès, such as The Vanishing Lady (1898) and A Voyage to the Moon (1902). The giant public entertainment screens that Wells describes in the futuristic city of When the Sleeper Wakes anticipated the Paris Exposition of 1900 when the Lumière brothers projected films onto a screen some twenty metres square. Wells’s fiction also demonstrates an affinity with cinema in its narration. In The Time Machine, for example, he describes the sensation of time travel as if from the perspective of a cinema spectator:\n\nChapman_Intro.indd Sec1:1\n\n12/12/2012 12:50:36 PM\n\n2\n\nProjecting Tomorrow\n\nThe laboratory got hazy and went dark. Mrs Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing me, towards the garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket. I pressed the lever over to its extreme position. The night came like the turning of a lamp, and in another moment came tomorrow. The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter and even fainter.5 One does not need to subscribe to the fashionable cult of Deleuze to recognize that cinema is based around temporal and spatial contraction. Wells’s narration here anticipated such filmic devices as the fade and the dissolve, used to indicate temporal and/or spatial ellipsis, as well as the illusion of accelerated motion that results from changing the speed of the projector. Indeed, The Time Machine was not only the first SF story but might have become the first SF film. The British pioneer R. W. Paul was quick to realize the cinematic potential of Wells’s novel. Paul was a manufacturer of scientific instruments who turned to filmmaking when he was commissioned to produce films for Thomas Edison’s kinetoscope. On 24 October 1895 Paul filed a patent application for a device he described as ‘a novel form of exhibition whereby the spectators have presented to their view scenes which are supposed to occur in the future or past, while they are given the sensation of voyaging upon a machine through time’.6 The idea was that spectators would stand on a platform with their attention directed towards a screen on which the films were being projected: it might be seen as a precursor of today’s amusement park rides and attractions. It is probable that Wells collaborated with Paul on the ‘Time Machine patent’ – their retrospective accounts suggest this was so – though in the event it went no further than the drawing board.7 Wells is often described as the ‘father of science fiction’: the American writer Robert Silverberg, for example, called him ‘the father of us all’.8 He is certainly the most oft-filmed SF author: there have been over forty films based on Wells’s stories.9 In particular his novels of ‘scientific romance’ – The Time Machine, The Island of Doctor Moreau, The Invisible Man, The War of the Worlds and The First Men in the Moon, all published between 1895 and 1901 – have all been made into major motion pictures in Hollywood and Britain.10 Unlike many intellectuals of his generation, Wells was interested in cinema and recognized its potential as a vehicle for communicating ideas: this would lead to his collaboration with Alexander Korda on the production of Things to Come in the 1930s. Other SF writers, however, have fared less well at the hands of the film industry. Isaac Asimov, for example, is represented only by a travesty of a film that borrows just the title of his seminal I, Robot.11 Robert Heinlein, too, is represented by just one film, though at least\n\nChapman_Intro.indd Sec1:2\n\n12/12/2012 12:50:37 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nPaul Verhoeven captured something of the militaristic flavour of Starship Troopers.12 There have been superior films of Richard Matheson’s I Am Legend and The Shrinking Man and Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451.13 Of three major films adapted from Philip K. Dick – Blade Runner, Total Recall and Minority Report – only the first bears any resemblance to its source.14 British writer John Wyndham has been well served by two films based on The Midwich Cuckoos – Village of the Damned and its sequel Children of the Damned – if rather less so by the film of The Day of the Triffids.15 And several seminal works of science fiction remain unfilmed, including Karel Capek’s R.U.R., Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World and Arthur C. Clarke’s Childhood’s End – though the producer George Pal toyed with the idea of filming all three – and series such as Isaac Asimov’s Foundation trilogy and Ray Bradbury’s The Martian Chronicles.16 Why has SF literature been so poorly served by the cinema? One reason is that until the mid-twentieth century the major form of SF literature was the short story rather than the novel. In addition to his half dozen novels of ‘scientific romance’, Wells wrote over eighty short stories between the 1880s and the 1920s. And the short story was also the favoured medium of the American ‘pulp’ magazines that popularized science fiction in the 1920s and 1930s. The most significant of the ‘pulps’ were Amazing Stories and Science Wonder Stories, both founded by Hugo Gernsback in the late 1920s, and Astounding Stories, founded in 1930, and which, from 1937, under editor John W. Campbell Jr, published early work by Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, Clifford Simak and Theodore Sturgeon.17 The short story is difficult to adapt for cinema as a feature film of around 90–120 minutes invariably requires padding out.18 Another reason is that SF literature often focuses on speculative ideas and concepts that do not always translate well into the narrative medium of film. Wells himself recognized this. In his introduction to the published screenplay of the film Things to Come – which he adapted from his speculative 1933 book ‘The Shape of Things to Come is essentially an imaginative discussion of social and political forces and possibilities, and a film is no place for argument. The conclusions of that book are therefore taken for granted in this film, and a new story has been invented to display them.’19 While SF literature has dealt largely in ideas – some critics prefer the term ‘speculative fiction’ – SF cinema has followed a different trajectory. The history of SF cinema is inextricably linked with the history of film technology. More than any other genre, science fiction depends upon the technology of the medium: it relies upon special effects to create images of future civilizations and alien worlds. From the ‘trick’ films of Méliès to effects-driven blockbusters such as George Lucas’s Star Wars (1977) and James Cameron’s Avatar (2009), science fiction has always been at the\n\nChapman_Intro.indd Sec1:3\n\n12/12/2012 12:50:37 PM\n\n4\n\nProjecting Tomorrow\n\ncutting edge of film technology. As one critic put it: SF films ‘reflect the technology that makes them possible’. 20 It has been suggested, however, that cinema’s preference for spectacle has prevented it from engaging with the underlying ideas of science fiction. Barry Keith Grant, for example, argues that the prevalence of spectacle has ‘been at the root of the genre’s general failure to express fully the ideas and concepts found in the best science fiction literature’.21 The history of SF cinema can be divided into several periods or cycles. In the 1920s and 1930s there were very few major science fiction films. As those were products of different national cinemas – the Soviet Union (Aelita, 1924), Germany (Metropolis, 1926), America (Just Imagine, 1930) and Great Britain (Things to Come, 1936) – they cannot be said to constitute a cycle as such.22 These films were all expensively produced and were notable for their detailed representation of futuristic urban spaces and ordered societies. They were also somewhat earnest and ponderous: critics admired their technical achievements but were less persuaded by their melodramatic narratives. At the other end of the production scale, however, science fiction flourished in Hollywood’s serials (or ‘chapter plays’) of the 1930s and 1940s: The Phantom Empire, The Lost City, Undersea Kingdom, Flash Gordon (and its two sequels), Buck Rogers, Brick Bradford, King of the Rocket Men and Captain Video.23 The serial represented an alternative mode of film practice produced with juvenile audiences in mind. Their sources were the ‘pulps’ and comic strips, and what they lacked in production values they made up for in zest and breathless pace. The emergence of television in the 1950s killed off the serials but they were remembered with affection. George Lucas’s inspiration for Star Wars came from the Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers serials he saw as a child. The first major cycle of SF films came from Hollywood in the 1950s. This period is now regarded as a ‘golden age’ of science fiction cinema with films including Destination Moon, The Thing from Another World, The Day the Earth Stood Still, When Worlds Collide, The War of the Worlds, Invaders from Mars, It Came from Outer Space, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, This Island Earth, Conquest of Space, Forbidden Planet, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Journey to the Center of the Earth and The Time Machine.24 There were several reasons for the emergence of science fiction as a major production trend at this time. One was that science fiction was an ideal genre for the new technologies such as widescreen (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Forbidden Planet) and 3D (It Came from Outer Space) that the film industry turned to in its efforts to counter the rise of television. Another was that science fiction offered filmmakers a medium for exploring the political and cultural anxieties of Cold War America. Peter Biskind remarks that the 1950s ‘established that science fiction, whether in film or in the mainstream literature of the genre, could\n\nChapman_Intro.indd Sec1:4\n\n12/12/2012 12:50:37 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nprovide an important vehicle for articulating cultural anxieties and for commenting in a serious way on those concerns’.25 These ranged from the right-wing fears of the Soviet Union expressed in the hawkish politics of some alien invasion films (The Thing from Another World, Invaders from Mars) to liberal tracts warning against the dangers of nuclear proliferation (The Day the Earth Stood Still) and ideological conformity in the face of McCarthyism (Invasion of the Body Snatchers). Other films prophesied catastrophe, whether from natural causes (When Worlds Collide) or atomic warfare (This Island Earth), while a cycle of ‘creature features’ (The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, Them!, It Came from Beneath the Sea) warned against the possible effects of radiation and the consequences of nuclear testing. Science fiction was less prominent in the 1960s, but the success of two major films in 1968 – Planet of the Apes and 2001: A Space Odyssey – kickstarted another cycle that lasted until the mid-1970s, including The Forbin Project, THX 1138, The Andromeda Strain, Silent Running, The Omega Man, Slaughterhouse Five, Soylent Green, Westworld, Zardoz, Dark Star, Rollerball, Futureworld, The Man Who Fell to Earth and Logan’s Run. 26 The recurring motif of these films is a dehumanized, dystopian future where individual liberty and freedom of thought have been suppressed by technology. The pessimistic vision of the future in 1970s SF cinema has been understood as an expression of the mood of disillusion and despair that affected America following Vietnam and Watergate. Collectively these films marked a decisive shift away from the basically optimistic outlook that characterized SF cinema before the 1970s. The films were a mixed bag in terms of quality and popular appeal, though they all demonstrated, once again, how SF cinema functioned as a vehicle for social commentary. The emergence of SF cinema as a mainstream genre coincided with the reformulation of the industrial practices and aesthetic strategies of the film industry that has been termed ‘New Hollywood’.27 Hitherto the received wisdom of the film industry was that science fiction was a marginal genre with limited appeal: even the one genuine blockbuster SF film prior to the late 1970s, 2001, was regarded as something of an exception. However, the annus mirabilis for SF cinema was in 1977 when the extraordinary impact of two films – George Lucas’s Star Wars and Steven Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind – transformed the prevailing view of the genre’s popular appeal. Star Wars (with record-breaking domestic rentals of $193 million) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind ($84 million) became two of the most successful films in cinema history. Since then SF films have consistently been among the biggest-grossing films, including E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, Jurassic Park, Independence Day, The Matrix, The War of the Worlds, Avatar and the six Star Wars sequels and prequels.28 These super-blockbusters, with their state-of-the-art film technology, represent\n\nChapman_Intro.indd Sec1:5\n\n12/12/2012 12:50:37 PM\n\n6\n\nProjecting Tomorrow\n\nthe culmination of the trend towards the cinema of spectacle that had begun with Méliès: indeed the promotional discourses of these films usually focus on their special effects rather than their plots. The advances in film technology that have facilitated the rise of the SF blockbuster were themselves a consequence of the success of the genre: George Lucas founded the special effects company Industrial Light and Magic on the back of the profits of Star Wars. There is of course an extensive body of critical literature on SF cinema. Much of the existing scholarship falls into one of two schools. One approach, exemplified by the work of John Baxter, John Brosnan and Christine Cornea, has been to map the history of the genre, identifying the major production trends and analysing the recurring themes.29 Such histories tend to deal in broad brush strokes: they usually have little space for the detailed consideration of individual films and sometimes marginalize films that do not fit easily into wider thematic patterns and production trends. The other approach, exemplified by Brooks Landon, Vivian Sobchack and J. P. Telotte and in volumes edited by Annette Kuhn, Ziauddin Sardar and Sean Cubitt, draws upon the discourses of cultural theory: the modern and the postmodern, simulacra and hyper-reality, the self and the other, the human and the monstrous.30 The emphasis here is often on close readings of films: but there is a tendency to return to the same narrow range of examples (Alien, Blade Runner, The Terminator) that best support a particular theoretical interpretation rather than expanding the field of enquiry. Alien and its sequels are also key points of reference in a growing body of feminist readings of SF cinema that focus on themes of gender politics and sexual difference.31 Projecting Tomorrow combines aspects of these two schools but is different from both. As in our previous book together, Projecting Empire, our approach is historical and case-study based.32 We have selected a dozen SF films, mostly American but including several British examples to represent Britain’s important contribution to the genre, from the 1930s to the early twenty-first century. Our examples include several classics of the genre but also some that have been marginalized or neglected in other histories. We have ranged across the full range of SF templates and themes, including the ‘history of the future’ (Things to Come), space travel and extra-terrestrial encounters (Forbidden Planet, 2001), the invasion narrative (The War of the Worlds, The Quatermass Experiment), space opera (Star Wars), planetary romance (Avatar), future apocalypse (Planet of the Apes), utopia/dystopia (Logan’s Run), cyborgs (RoboCop), documentary (The Hellstrom Chronicle) and even an SF musical comedy (Just Imagine).33 We have included films based (however loosely) on SF literature and films written specifically for the screen. Two of our case studies – Things to Come and 2001 – reveal what\n\nChapman_Intro.indd Sec1:6\n\n12/12/2012 12:50:37 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nhappened when leading SF writers (H. G. Wells and Arthur C. Clarke) were lured into collaborating with the film industry. We do not claim that these are necessarily the best or the most historically significant SF films – though several, including Things to Come, Forbidden Planet, 2001 and Star Wars would undoubtedly be recognized as landmarks of the genre. Nevertheless all the films are of interest for their narrative and visual representations of the future (or as in the case of Star Wars, a technologically advanced mythical past) and for their role in shaping the genre. We could have written the book with an entirely different selection of case studies. An alternate list might include The Day the Earth Stood Still, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Time Machine, Fahrenheit 451, THX 1138, The Omega Man, Westworld, Dark Star, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Blade Runner, The Terminator and Starship Troopers. Perhaps this is to anticipate a sequel: Projecting Tomorrow 2? As film historians our methodology is that of empirical investigation and analysis. We seek to locate SF films in their historical contexts – industrial, economic, political, social, cultural – and to document their production and reception histories. To this end we have drawn upon a wide range of primary sources including scripts, studio records, personal papers, censors’ reports, publicity materials, autobiographies, trade papers, and contemporary newspaper and journal reviews. In particular we are interested in how and why the films were as they were: this involves the sometimes conflicting inputs of producers, writers and directors, and a variety of other factors such as censorship policy, studio politics, and (as often as not) budgetary constraints. Our method therefore owes nothing to voguish trends in cultural theory and everything to the evidence of the archives. As with our previous study of the cinema of empire, Projecting Tomorrow shows how the content of films is shaped by the agencies involved in their production and the conditions under which they were made. The theme that links all our case studies is how the futuristic narratives and images of SF cinema are determined by the circumstances of their production. It is often said that science fiction is as much about the present in which it is created as the future in which it is set: to this extent SF cinema functions in a similar way to the historical film as a commentary on the times in which it is produced and consumed. While this is hardly a new insight, it is one that hitherto has largely been taken for granted in both the historical and the theoretical literature. We would maintain that the truth of this assumption can be proven only through archival research and the nitty-gritty accounts of production and reception that are grist to the film historian’s mill. Projecting Tomorrow therefore seeks to show how cinema’s imagination of the future has also functioned as a mirror of the present.\n\nChapman_Intro.indd Sec1:7\n\n12/12/2012 12:50:37 PM\n\n8\n\nProjecting Tomorrow\n\nNotes 1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5 6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11 12 13\n\n14\n\nKristin Thompson and David Bordwell, Film History: An Introduction (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1994), p.9.

The Time Machine has been filmed twice, directed by George Pal for MGM in 1960 and by Simon Wells (Wells’s great-grandson) for Warner Bros. in 2002. There have been three films of The Island of Doctor Moreau, directed by Erle C. Kenton for Paramount in 1932 (as Island of Lost Souls), by Don Taylor for American International Pictures in 1977 and by John Frankenheimer for New Line Cinema in 1996. The Invisible Man was directed by James Whale for Universal in 1933: there were four sequels in the 1940s (five if we include 1951’s Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man) that had little to do with Wells. There have been two theatrically released films of The War of the Worlds, directed by Byron Haskin for Paramount in 1953 and by Steven Spielberg for Dreamworks in 2005.

(Rossum’s Universal Robots) in 1938 and again in 1948: these were live broadcasts and no longer exist. There have been two television films of Brave New World: by Universal in 1980 with Keir Dullea (2001: A Space Odyssey) as Grambell and for USA Network in 1998 with Star Trek’s Leonard Nimoy as Mond. In 2008 it was announced that Ridley Scott would direct a film of Brave New World with Leonardo di Caprio: at the time of writing this project seems to have stalled. NBC produced a three-episode television mini-series of The Martian Chronicles in 1980. See Gary Westfahl, Hugo Gernsback and the Century of Science Fiction (Jefferson NC: McFarland, 2007). In contrast short SF stories proved a fertile ground for television anthology dramas in the 1950s and 60s. The British series Out of This World (ABC, 1962) and Out of the Unknown (BBC2, 1965–71) included adaptations of Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Frederick Pohl and John Wyndhan. In America Richard Matheson wrote several episodes of The Twilight Zone (1959–64), and Harlan Ellison contributed to The Outer Limits (1963–5). H. G. Wells, Things to Come: A Film by H. G.

Gleaming white towers formed broad avenues laid out with ribbons of garden. Bridges arched gracefully between the ranks of buildings, carrying trains and speeding lines of automobiles; some streets plunged into tunnels through the larger towers. Between the skyscrapers neat formations of aircraft crisscross the city. We notice two single-seat monoplanes in particular. They pull to a standstill and hover next to each other using propellers mounted horizontally in the wing. The young male pilot of one jumps onto his wing and hops nimbly across onto the wing of the other. A young woman smiles up from the controls and the action begins ... It was a scene unlike anything in American motion pictures to that point. A vision of a possible future realized with a level of detail had been seen only once previously, in Fritz Lang’s lavish German masterpiece Metropolis (1927). This was the first sight of the future New York in Fox Metrotone’s Just Imagine, the film with the distinction of being Hollywood’s first major SF film. Here for the first time were many elements that would become commonplace in the decades to come, the most obvious being contemporary comment. Just Imagine was a genre piece before the cinematic genre had fully formed: a paradox that led to a flurry of allegations of plagiarism from writers who considered themselves to be the only possible originators of its ideas. Other films would seek to impress the audience with lavish spectacles of the future and space travel, and beguile them with speculation in risqué fashions in the future, but Just Imagine would remain unique in one regard: it would be the only SF musical. The origins of Just Imagine lie not in America’s traditions of experimental fiction or genuine social or scientific speculation, but on that familiar epicentre of American fantasy: Broadway. Just Imagine plundered the emerging aesthetics of the imagined future to serve the ends of musical entertainment and make a political point – satirizing Prohibition – along the way. It was\n\nChapman_Chap01.indd Sec1:13\n\n12/12/2012 12:47:42 PM\n\n14\n\nProjecting Tomorrow\n\nthe creation of Fox Metrotone studios and the highly successful team of lyricists Buddy DeSylva and Lew Brown and composer Ray Henderson.1 Individually, each of the three had already made a mark with songs that became part of the American landscape. The team first came together on Broadway in 1925. Their collective output included standards like ‘Button up your Overcoat’, songs showcasing African-American entertainers including ‘Black Bottom’, and songs for ‘Minstrel’ entertainers like Al Jolson for whom they wrote ‘Sonny Boy’. In October 1929 they scored a massive hit with the film musical Sunny Side Up for Fox. It was a cheerful ‘cross town’ romance set in New York City. Tunes included the highly hum-able title song ‘Keep your Sunny Side Up’. The director of Sunny Side Up, David Butler, attracted attention with mobile camera work and experimental colour sequences. The film’s real success lay in its being available at the very moment that the bottom dropped out of the American economy. It became America’s escape from the Wall Street Crash. The film did well enough to guarantee studio demand for a swift follow-up. The follow-up would become Just Imagine. In seeking to repeat the success of Sunny Side Up, DeSylva, Brown and Henderson sought an amalgam of the previous film’s successful elements: music, romance and comedy. The new future setting added a dose of escapist fantasy. It was a promising strategy to show a comfortable future in the midst of a distressed present. Studio documents reveal that Just Imagine was a pet project of DeSylva particularly. He had long since noticed the potential for a musical set in the future – some of the ideas seen in Just Imagine were road-tested on stage in The George White Scandals of 1926. In fact he recalled raising the idea of a ‘futuristic musical comedy’ when he first began contract negotiations with Fox studio executive Sol Wurtzel, long before Sunny Side Up.2 The core plot of Just Imagine concerned a standard pair of lovers divided, but that still left the need for comic relief. In Sunny Side Up the humour had been provided by one of the most popular screen comedians of the era, El Brendel, who played the poor girl’s downstairs neighbour Eric Swenson. The new film would place his talents front and centre. Brendel was a dialect comedian whose screen persona was a hapless thickly-accented Swede with a propensity for phrases like ‘yumping yiminy’. Born in Philadelphia from a German/Irish family, Brendel had begun a career in vaudeville in 1913 with a German dialect routine. With the wave of anti-German feeling that surged across America during the Great War, Brendel judiciously evolved his Swedish persona and prospered, performing with his wife Flo Bert. The humour was gentle and played on the anxieties of an immigrant nation whose citizens found understandable release in laughing at someone less adjusted to life in the new world than themselves.3 The same dynamic was\n\nChapman_Chap01.indd Sec1:14\n\n12/12/2012 12:47:42 PM\n\nDry Future\n\n15\n\n1. The city of 1980 as realized for Just Imagine (1930) (Source: British Film Institute).\n\nseen at work in the ‘greenhorn’ tradition in Jewish comedy.4 By 1921 Brendel was a regular on Broadway. His success was such that even before the coming of sound he had a contract in Hollywood, joining Famous Players in 1926. He signed with Fox in 1929. In the wake of The Jazz Singer Brendel was ideally placed to exploit the new technology with its demand for amusing audio to match the pictures. His speaking roles included the rookie flyer turned mechanic Herman Schwimpf in Wings (1927) and in 1930, the comic role of Gus the Swede in The Big Trail (1930).5 In Just Imagine Brendel played an Everyman from the present revived fifty years in the future – a take on the familiar idea of the sleeper waking in the future familiar from Edward Bellamy’s utopian novel of 1888 Looking Backward or William Morris’s British response News From Nowhere (1890), or H. G. Wells’s When the Sleeper Wakes of 1899. There was no particular plot reason for making him a Swede, though the characterization made a certain sense if one imagined a modern man fifty years adrift in time as the ultimate greenhorn immigrant. The most exciting element of Just Imagine would be its future city settings. These were the work of the set designer and art director, a former architect named Stephen Goosson. As James Sanders has noted, Goosson drew inspiration from the work of the late Italian futurist Antonio Sant’\n\nChapman_Chap01.indd Sec1:15\n\n12/12/2012 12:47:42 PM\n\n16\n\nProjecting Tomorrow\n\nElia, the New York architect Harvey Wiley Corbett and most especially the drawings that Corbett commissioned from Hugh Ferriss, which reached a wider public as a result of his book of illustrations, Metropolis of Tomorrow, which appeared in 1929.6 These influences had already shaped Fritz Lang’s Metropolis. With an unprecedented budget and a dirigible hanger in Arcadia, California to work in, Goosson, together with the mechanical effects director Ralph Hammeras and their team, began the process of creating the city of the future. The fan magazine Photoplay reported: It took 205 engineers and craftsmen five months to build it, at a cost of $168,000 ... . It was designed after long conferences with noted artists and scientists who dare to peer far into the future. Seventy-four 5,000,000 candle power sun arcs light the set from above. Fifteen thousand electric light bulbs illuminate its buildings and streets.7 The production was complex. The scenes set on Mars required casting multiple sets of identical twins. The film needed elaborate costumes, sets, miniature work and the brand new process of back projection, which worried studio managers. A studio lawyer wrote anxiously to Wurtzel: It is my understanding that plans are being made for some trick photography in the new Butler production. If this is the case, I think that we should be sure what method is going to be used and whether or not we are laying ourselves open to any claim for damages by reason of existing patents.8 The production was apparently fairly uneventful. When interviewed in his later years the director’s only major recollection concerned the leading man John Garrick being stranded above the set in his mock-up aircraft during an earthquake.9 Just Imagine began with a preface in invoking the world of fifty years previously – 1880 – it depicted a sleepy street corner in horse-drawn New York City and then flashed forward to the same corner in 1930 following a hapless jaywalker and his attempt to cross the street without being hit by a car. With the distance to the past established, a narrator invited the audience to ‘Just Imagine’ the world of fifty years into the future: ‘If the last fifty years made such a change, just imagine the New York of 1980 ... when everyone has a number instead of a name and the government tells you whom you should marry. Just Imagine ... 1980!’ The scene shifts to the skies above the future New York where two lovers hovering in adjacent aircraft steal a conversation. The young man, an airline pilot named J-21 (John Garrick), has bad news for the\n\nChapman_Chap01.indd Sec1:16\n\n12/12/2012 12:47:44 PM\n\nDry Future\n\n17\n\nwoman LN-18 (Maureen O’Sullivan); the state marriage tribunal has ruled against his petition to marry her and instead favoured her father’s choice, an obnoxious newspaper proprietor named MT-3 (Kenneth Thompson), on the grounds that MT-3 has achieved more in his life. J-21’s appeal date is set for four months’ time. Later, at home, J-21 confides his despair to his friend RT-42 (Frank Albertson). As a distraction, RT-42 and his girlfriend D-6 (Marjorie White) take J-21 to witness a medical experiment at D-6’s place of work: the revival of man who has been dead since he was struck by lightning on a golf course in 1930. At the lab they find an astonishing array of technology and ranks of impassive scientists. A mysterious ray revives the corpse (El Brendel) but the scientists have no further plans for the man and even offer to kill him again. Concerned, J-21 volunteers to help him find his feet in the new world. Noting that he predates the alpha-numeric naming schema of the day, they resolve to call him ‘Single O’. Single O is disoriented by the sights of 1980, though fascinated by the revealing women’s fashions. When he realizes that food has been replaced by one kind of pill and illicit cocktails by another, he mourns ‘give me the good old days’. He makes the same remark when he sees a couple obtain a baby from a vending machine rather than through the traditional method.10 He cheers himself up by getting drunk on pills. MT-3 forces LN-18 to reject J-21 and he wanders the city alone. A mysterious stranger finds him and offers to give the flyer his heart’s desire. J-21 is taken to meet a great inventor named Z4 (Hobart Bosworth), who reveals that he is looking for someone to pilot his rocket plane to Mars. J-21 recognizes his opportunity to distinguish himself beyond MT-3 and thereby get the court to rule in his favour. RT-42 agrees to join him as his co-pilot and the flyers celebrate their departure with an illicit drinking party on the airship Pegasus. They go to the launch site. As their rocket blasts away from earth Single O emerges as stowaway, under the impression that he was going to J-21’s ‘Ma’s’ rather than the planet Mars. Landing on Mars a month later, the three friends encounter exotically costumed Martians, many of whom appear to be dancing girls. They are welcomed by the Martian queen, Loo Loo (Joyzelle Joyner). Single O is befriended by a large, camp, Martian male named Boko (Ivan Linow). The Earthmen are entertained to a bath and a show by performing Martian monkeys. As the show reaches its climax, they are attacked and captured by a second group of Martians led by Boo Boo (also Joyzelle Joyner) and Loko (also Ivan Linow), who are the physical doubles of the first. J-21 realizes that every Martian has an evil twin who becomes part of a parallel hostile civilization. The three Earthmen are flogged into jail by Martian girls and witness a ritual ‘victory dance’ in front of an idol. J-21 realizes that time is\n\nChapman_Chap01.indd Sec1:17\n\n12/12/2012 12:47:44 PM\n\n18\n\nProjecting Tomorrow\n\n2.

After a chase, which entails much confusion between Boko and his evil double, Single O saves the day and carries his friends to freedom. They blast off for the return journey and make it back to earth just in time for J-21’s court hearing. Recognizing that J-21 has proved his worth, the judge grants his marriage license. A bearded old man appears, claiming to be Single O’s son. With a delighted paternal cry of ‘climb up on my knee sonny boy’ Single O whisks the old man onto his lap and they strike a final tableau before the end title. Just Imagine was built to be a stage for contemporary comment. Its core objective was to satirize Prohibition. Congress had passed the constitutional amendment to control the sale of alcohol in the United States in 1919 and given it draconian reach through the Volstead Act of the same year, which banned the sale of almost all intoxicating drink. By 1930 Prohibition had little credibility. Because the law outlawed the sale of even fairly weak beer and wine it seemed unfairly indiscriminate. It had plainly created an opportunity for organized crime and was regularly flouted by people who were supposed to be the guardians of public morals. Pressure groups campaigned for a change as ardently as their forebears had called for\n\nChapman_Chap01.indd Sec1:18\n\n12/12/2012 12:47:44 PM\n\nDry Future\n\n19\n\nrestrictions. The issue of alcohol was introduced in the first seconds of the film. The flashback to 1880 concludes with a drunk exiting a bar and the narrator’s comment ‘We also had this ...’ Waking in 1980 Single O is amazed to learn that Prohibition is still in effect. RT-42 promises, ‘It looks like in a year or two we’re going to get a little light wine and beer’, which Single O notes was also the expectation in 1930. Single O swiftly takes to the intoxicating pills that are the alcohol substitute for many in 1980. It is clear that the law is still routinely flouted. At the party on the Pegasus the assembled pilots sing their drinking song with the refrain: ‘If they want the world dry, we’ll obey/we’ll just drink it that way.’ More than this, the marriage law subplot is also a comment on Prohibition in as much as it is a case of government over-reaching and intruding in the personal lives of its citizens, rendered on an absurd scale. The link is explicit. When RT-42 complains about the law to a government census official, she strikes a pose and declares: ‘Like the Volstead Act, it is a noble experiment ...’ borrowing the famous phrase that President Herbert Hoover had used to defend the legislation while running for the White House in 1928.11 Just Imagine can be seen as a part of the deaththrows of Prohibition: making the point when criticism of that law could be a subject for mainstream popular culture, and the flouting of that law could be depicted as the routine practice of the sympathetic characters. Prohibition was not the only element of life in 1930 to attract comment. Just Imagine also dealt with anxieties around gender relations at the start of the 1930s. This is explicit in an early scene in which a female census inspector comes to call (as 1980, like 1930, is a census year). She is an officious, uniformed older woman. RT-42 speaks of his dislike for ‘modern women’ and teases her. J-21 responds by singing of his longing for an old-fashioned girl: ‘the type that blossomed fifty years ago’, RT-42 dreamily imagines a succession of flappers shaking a cocktail, abandoning resistance to a kiss and simultaneously smoking and reading a book entitled ‘Ex-Wife’ (which itself is suggestive), while rocking the cradle with her foot. There are interesting hints at concern over technology intruding into reproduction. RT-42 tells the census taker that his parents were General Electric because he was an incubator baby. Later, Single O witnesses the baby delivered by vending machine. There were other in-jokes about the politics of the period. When Single O learns that the cars and planes of the era all have obviously Jewish names – Rosenblatt, Pinkus and Goldfarbs – he quips ‘It looks like someone got even with Henry Ford.’ The remark turns on Ford’s notorious anti-Semitism.12 Unfortunately, the car names are the only indication of social diversity in the future. The Irish are still cops. All the scientists are old white and male with the exception of one who appears to be Japanese. No Black faces are seen. The film may be pessimistic about government but it is unflinchingly optimistic about technology, not least because it promises that science\n\nChapman_Chap01.indd Sec1:19\n\n12/12/2012 12:47:45 PM\n\n20\n\nProjecting Tomorrow\n\nmight someday have the power to resurrect the dead. 13 Lesser innovations promised include videophones, video door viewers, beds and sinks that fold away. The ubiquity of aircraft in Just Imagine is very much of its era, with aviator Charles Lindbergh attaining an unprecedented celebrity following his solo Atlantic flight in 1927. Just Imagine traced such preoccupations into the future making aviation common place and obliging transatlantic pilot J-21 to venture into space in order to accomplish a Lindbergh-type breakthrough. We are told that everything else has been done. Although the film mixes science fiction with humour, the humour is not at the expense of science fiction. Despite its heritage in literature with H.G. Wells and Jules Verne, the genre was not well enough established in film for the film to joke about its conventions. The world created within the film is treated fairly seriously with only limited use of the alpha-numeric names for puns.14 The general approach is to have fun with the oddness of 1930 in 1980s eyes and 1980 to 1930s eyes and – no less – have fun with the similarities, as when Single O remarks: ‘So women are still causing trouble? You’d have thought in fifty years they’d have found a good substitute for them.’15 There are elements of the film that are designed to be funny in their own terms: El Brendel ‘shtick’ sometimes has nothing to do with the setting, as when he interrupts the action to deliver the comic monologue ‘The Romance of Elmer Stremingway’, which involves the rapid changing of hats. There is humour in the film’s songs – sometimes quite racy humour as when D-6 and RT-42 urge their audience to ‘Never swat a fly ...’ because ‘they want to make hay, hay the way I do ...’. Finally, DeSylva, Brown and Henderson can’t resist in-jokes. The drunken Single-O sings a snatch of their song ‘Sunny Side Up’, and his final line ‘Climb on my knee Sonny Boy’ echoes the famous first line of their Al Jolson hit. With the film complete Fox ran into a snag: how exactly to market a film so unlike anything seen before. The studio publicity material for Just Imagine avoided comment on the Prohibition element in the story, and made no promise of great comic or musical value beyond allusions to the success of Sunny Side Up. Instead they aimed for the lowest common denominator. The suggested tag lines in studio publicity include: ‘Just Imagine the necking, kissing, petting technique of 1980’ and ‘Just Imagine youth on wings ... making love in the skies.’ ‘Get a load of this advance course in love making, sky-rocketing and thrill-hunting ... See what the girls will wear fifty years from now. Do you blush easily?’16 Audiences wooed into the theatre by such come-ons would have been disappointed, more especially once America’s censors had set to work on the film. Just Imagine had one last hurdle before its distribution: the would-be moral guardians at the Motion Picture Distributors Association of America. As of 1930 the MPDAA was renewing efforts to pull film production into\n\nChapman_Chap01.indd Sec1:20\n\n12/12/2012 12:47:45 PM\n\nDry Future\n\n21\n\nline promulgating a revised Production Code in February of that year. Their preview of Just Imagine left them a little uncomfortable. A memo written after the premiere of 10 October suggested that while the picture as a whole was ‘quite delightful in its spontaneous fun’ the studio might still usefully use the interval before its distribution to trim some of the cheekier scenes.17 On 18 October Colonel Wilson from the Production Code Administration (PCA), wrote to Fox with suggestions for ‘reconsideration’ and a list of elements that were likely to be censored by local boards. His most substantial objections were to the ‘Never Swat a Fly’ number with its suggestive lines like: ‘an ant may like to but it can’t’, close-ups of skimpy costumes, certain dance movements, and the gags around the character Boko/Loko on Mars: The line in which Single O says: ‘She is not the queen, he is’, after taking one look at Loko [sic], will probably be eliminated because of its implication. It is possible, too that some of the censors may want to eliminate from Loko’s actions that which seems to make it appear that he is ‘queer’.18 A further viewing in November raised further worries about the Mars sequences. Martians were shown at one point using nose thumbing as a greeting – a gesture that the PCA felt inappropriate for repeat viewing.19 As predicted, many local censorship boards made substantial cuts. Targets included various combinations of cut multiple shots of skimpy garments on Earth and Mars, suggestive dance moves, the nose thumbing and the biggest laugh: Brendel’s ‘give me the good old days’ response to seeing a baby arrive from a vending machine.20 Major cuts to the version screened in New York included the risqué ‘Never Swat a Fly’ song. Variety felt that the film was much weaker as a result.21 While the studio held out against the production code office’s worries for several months, in December they finally agreed to make a number of cuts to render the film acceptable for screening to the Motion Picture Academy.22 The critical reaction was mixed. The Los Angeles Evening Express heralded the film as ‘epochal’, arguing that it ‘Opens up new vistas of the power of the camera drama to release the ideas of authors for new flights ... Its daring as an innovation never fails to arouse admiration.’23 Film Daily hailed a ‘wow comedy novelty, refreshing futuristic concoction packed with fanciful surprises and humor’.24 The Los Angeles Times told readers: ‘You daren’t miss it.’25 Variety, however, was underwhelmed, mourning that despite the engaging premise, the film failed to deliver. Its reviewer felt that the ‘tunes’ were ‘not strong’ and concluded: ‘Just Imagine cost heavy and is going to need impressive publicity outlay to help it on its way.’26 The film performed disappointingly. It lasted only a week at its New York venue – The Roxy.\n\nChapman_Chap01.indd Sec1:21\n\n12/12/2012 12:47:45 PM\n\n22\n\nProjecting Tomorrow\n\nExplaining its early departure in his enthusiastic review for the New York Times, Mordaunt Hall reported: ‘It is said that it did not find favor with the generation hovering around the twenties because a believable romance was absent.’27 During production, the Fox legal team had worried that they might be sued for patent violation over the innovative technical processes used. No such suits were filed, but the studio ran into a different sort of legal difficulty, which illuminates the novelty of the film’s subject matter in 1930. Shortly after its release a writer named David Halperin sued Fox for $50,000 alleging that Just Imagine plagiarized his unproduced play Starlight Gables, which he claimed he had submitted to the studio the previous spring.28 An internal investigation at the studio found that no one remotely connected with the production had seen this script but that a professional reader named Leonard Spiegelgass who sometimes worked for Fox had examined it as a favour to the author, rejected it but sent it on to MGM just to soften the blow.29 Halperin’s play (which survives in the studio’s legal files) was a lacklustre work in which the inventor of a rocket called the Lunamobile receives a blow on the head from criminals and dreams that his craft makes a crazy trip to Mars. The script included excruciating personifications of the stars and planets.30 Halperin claimed multiple similarities to the Fox film, including ‘ultra-modernistic scenic effects’ and a climax on Mars as he ‘visualized and imagined, subjectively and perceptively, that planet to be’. He even claimed that the costumes and physique of Martians had been plagiarized from him. Quite apart from the Just Imagine team’s complete ignorance of Halperin or his work, most of these elements were what would soon be recognized as standard conventions of the science fiction genre: a cigar shaped space vehicle, ‘ultra-modern’ setting and skimpy costumes for alien girls, rather than Halperin’s own invention. On the idea of a trip to Mars, one Fox legal executive noted: ‘the mere idea of a trip to Mars is an old one and has been repeatedly used in fiction since the days of Jules Verne’. He was able to recall prior use of the idea in film, noting: ‘Universal released a picture in 1922 entitled HELLO MARS which deals with the adventures on that planet of a group of aviators.’31 Another executive observed: ‘There is utterly no similarity between Halperin’s script and our picture excepting that a so-called “Lunamobile” in his story flies to Mars.’ He concluded: ‘This, of course, is such an ancient idea for use in fiction that I do not see any possibility of his being able to recover anything from Fox Film Corporation.’32 The Fox team had a brief moment of anxiety when it was pointed out that Halperin’s script included reference to twins on Mars, but they were reassured to realize that this was simply a gag about Martian children all looking alike rather than a central focus of the culture in the same way as Just\n\nChapman_Chap01.indd Sec1:22\n\n12/12/2012 12:47:45 PM\n\nDry Future\n\n23\n\nImagine’s Jekyll and Hyde set-up. David Butler explained that he had devised the idea of twins on Mars as an easy way to suggest alienness ‘to avoid expense of creating “eight-legged horses,” strange animals and people, etc. etc’.33 Full of confidence, the Fox team prepared to place both Butler and the film’s originator Buddy DeSylva on the stand. The case never got to court. The existence of two other plagiarism complaints suggests that Halperin was not the only writer who could not tell where generic convention ended and their own creativity began.34 The case opens fascinating questions of the understanding of genre at this juncture in Hollywood history.35 As will be seen, the issue of originality would recur half a century later. Just Imagine did not deliver the spectacular results that its creators had hoped for. It received Oscar nominations for Goosson and Hammeras for art direction, but lost (like many other nominees that year) to the RKO’s epic Western Cimarron. In retrospect, the film was hardly deserving of great success. Its comedy was awkward and the romance painfully mechanical. The songs were not DeSylva, Brown and Henderson’s best. The Martian sequences did not match the standard of the earlier scenes. The real star of the film – the elaborate cityscape – only appeared for a couple of seconds at the opening and then returned briefly later. Though the film soon disappeared from theatres, its aesthetics lived on in another way: Fox loaned out props and stock footage to other projects, including the serials of the later 1930s. The rocket miniature, some effects outtakes and the Martian idol sequence reappeared in Flash Gordon (1936) and Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe (1940), and the cityscape was seen in Buck Rogers (1939). In this way, glimpses of Just Imagine became part of the mainstream of American SF history.36 Despite its modest showing at the box office, the careers of the principal creative figures associated with the picture flourished. All had their contracts renewed at Fox.37 Buddy DeSylva went on to be a co-founder of Capitol Records along with Johnny Mercer. In the 1950s DeSylva, Brown and Henderson were given the compliment of a Hollywood musical biopic of their careers called The Best Things in Life Are Free directed by Michael Curtiz. Their music lives on in the ‘standard’ repertoire though none of the Just Imagine songs remain in circulation. David Butler’s later films included many Shirley Temple vehicles, and Calamity Jane (1953). Goosson became a great master of Hollywood art direction. His greatest triumph was to create the mythic realm of Shangri La for Lost Horizon (1937) at Columbia, for which he received an Academy Award. In contrast, of the Just Imagine cast, only Maureen O’Sullivan achieved real stardom – as Jane to Johnny Weissmuller’s Tarzan in Tarzan the Ape Man (1932) and in subsequent films. El Brendel continued his unlikely career for many years ending as a guest star in 1960s TV.\n\nChapman_Chap01.indd Sec1:23\n\n12/12/2012 12:47:45 PM\n\n24\n\nProjecting Tomorrow\n\nJust Imagine dropped from view and was considered ‘lost’, becoming a legend among aficionados who knew it only from stills. The screening of the rediscovered film in the golden age of science fiction in the 1970s was something of an anticlimax. As 1980 approached, the studio had only a couple of letters requesting a re-release in the year in which the film was set, in order to compare prediction with reality. Clips surfaced in documentaries on science fiction, including Looking Back at Tomorrow for Disney’s Epcot Center in Florida.38 Art director Stephen Goosson, recalling the film in 1972, was struck by how far short of reality he and the architectural prophets of the 1920s had been. He wrote: ‘What is being done now is far beyond anything thought of in those days, and I am pleased to see it.’39 Today Just Imagine is a fascinating document of the emergence of the genre and is readily compared by scholars to Metropolis.40 Its value as a curiosity was sufficient to justify a release on DVD in 2008. The film’s influence on the genre is hard to gauge, but seems limited. Just Imagine’s use of ideas that had already occurred to other writers was no sign of plagiarism, and in the same way, the later use of the ideas seen in Just Imagine is no indication of the film’s influence. The later echoes of Just Imagine stand as an indicator of the emergence of generic conventions and shared reference to similar sources. The idea of evil doppelgangers on Mars loosely anticipates the ‘mirror universe’ created by Jerome Bixby for the original series of Star Trek and numerous other space age Jekyll and Hydes. Single O’s story anticipates Woody Allen’s Sleeper (1973) and Mike Judd’s Ideocracy (2006), and directly inspired C. M. Kornbluth’s story from 1951 ‘The Marching Morons’.41 The number-for-name idea reappeared in George Lucas’s first film, THX 1138, and in the names of the droids in the Star Wars films. The idea of an Art Deco future resurfaced in the future New York of Luc Besson’s The Fifth Element (1997). The use of revealing women’s costumes to connote the future would be a standard element of the genre: Single O would have appreciated the couture of Forbidden Planet (1956), Barbarella (1968), Logan’s Run (1976), and the uniform designs of the original series of Star Trek (1966–9). But the memorial the filmmaking sought was not in celluloid imitation but in legislation. They plainly hoped that Just Imagine could be one more nail in the coffin of Prohibition. So it proved. Barely a year and half after the release of Just Imagine, the target of its satire – Prohibition – became a thing of the past. Just Imagine immediately became an anachronism, but doubtless, all concerned raised a glass regardless.\n\nNotes 1\n\nDeSylva’s credits included the words to ‘California here I come’, and ‘If you knew Susie’.

Things to Come is unique in that it marked the only occasion where Wells was involved in the production of a film of one of his own works. However, the collaboration between the visionary author and the flamboyant producer would turn out to be anything but an easy experience. Wells had maintained his interest in the cinema since his association with R. W. Paul and their putative film of The Time Machine in 1895. He was a founding member of the Film Society in London in 1925, alongside such figures as George Bernard Shaw, film critics Ivor Montagu and Iris Barry, film directors Anthony Asquith and Adrian Brunel, theatre director John Strachey and actor Ivor Novello. The Film Society was at the forefront of an intellectual film culture emerging in Britain in the 1920s that championed the European avant-garde in preference to the commercial products of the British and American studios.4 Wells also had a peripheral involvement with the film industry at this time. In 1927 he wrote the scenario for a film entitled The Peace of the World, promoting his idea of a world state – a project that collapsed when the producer, Edward Godal, went bankrupt – and in 1928 he lent his name to a trio of comedy shorts produced by Ivor Montagu and Adrian Brunel: Bluebottles, Daydreams and The Tonic, starring Elsa\n\nChapman_Chap02.indd Sec1:27\n\n12/12/2012 12:47:55 PM\n\n28\n\nProjecting Tomorrow\n\nLanchester and Charles Laughton.5 Although he was disappointed with most of the films of his work that he lived to see – The Invisible Man was the one exception – Wells nevertheless recorded in his diary in 1935: ‘I was and am still interested in the film as a means of expression rather than entertainment.’6 Wells’s fullest involvement in the film industry came through his association with Alexander Korda in the mid-1930s. Korda, an Anglophile Hungarian émigré, had established himself as a major force in the British film industry with The Private Life of Henry VIII in 1933. The success of that film prompted Korda to embark upon an ambitious, though highly profligate, production programme with a series of expensive films including Catherine the Great (1934), The Private Life of Don Juan (1934), The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934), Sanders of the River (1935), The Ghost Goes West (1935), Rembrandt (1936), Elephant Boy (1937), Knight Without Armour (1937) and an uncompleted film of I, Claudius.7 Korda was prepared to take both economic and aesthetic risks in his quest to produce films that could compete with the best Hollywood had to offer. Things to Come was the culmination of this strategy. It was expensive – its final cost of around £250,000 made it the most expensive British film up to that point – and it was intellectually ambitious.8 Film Weekly saw it as nothing less than an attempt to elevate the status of the author in the film industry: ‘Mr Wells has become the first writer to receive what is known in the entertainment business as “top billing”. He has written something which he calls a film scenario, and although there has never been a scenario like it before, it is gratefully accepted as a work of genius.’9 There had indeed never been anything quite like Things to Come. It was unusual in so far as it was a hybrid of a literary adaptation and an original screen story. Wells adapted the scenario from his own book The Shape of Things to Come, published in 1933. The Shape of Things to Come is characteristic of Wells’s later work in that it is not a conventional novel but a philosophical and historical treatise. It is a speculative history of the future, in the guise of a ‘dream book’ left behind by one Dr Philip Raven, an adviser to the League of Nations, chronicling world events from 1930 to 2105. It describes the collapse of the world economic system following the Wall Street Crash and the secret re-armament of Germany, leading to the outbreak of the Second World War in January 1940. The war lasts until 1949 when social breakdown, uprisings and the spread of disease force the warring nations to cease hostilities. In 1956 an outbreak of ‘maculated fever’ wipes out half the world’s population. Wells then describes the rise of the Modern State. The surviving scientists, meeting at Basra in 1965, lay down the principles on which the Modern State will be built, including the centralization of economic planning and the abolition of nation states and private property.\n\nChapman_Chap02.indd Sec1:28\n\n12/12/2012 12:47:55 PM\n\nThe Prophet and the Showman\n\n29\n\nThe Air Police employ ‘pacifin’, a new peace gas, to overcome opposition and impose the rule of law. An era of ‘Puritan Tyranny’ follows, in which a scientific elite leads the task of reconstruction. In 2059, when war, poverty and disease have all been abolished, the World Council is dissolved – there is no further need for it – and ‘there remains no single human being upon the planet without a fair prospect of self-fulfilment, of health, interest and freedom’.10 It will be clear that The Shape of Things to Come was no ordinary book. It can be seen as a summary of Wells’s views on politics, society, economics and religion. Most discussion of the book has tended to focus on its speculative qualities – Wells accurately predicted the immediate cause of the Second World War as a dispute between Germany and Poland over Danzig and foresaw the strategic role of air power – though its real significance resides in its ideas about historical process. It develops themes that Wells had already explored elsewhere, including in The Outline of History (1920), A Short History of the World (1922) and The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind (1931), into a manifesto for the future of humanity. In particular it expresses his belief in a system of world government and, controversially, his advocacy of an altruistic dictatorship by a scientific and intellectual elite. It asserts that nation states and organized religion are obstacles to progress and should be abolished. And it argues that technocracy – the organization of society according to rational scientific principles – represents the key to achieving future peace and prosperity.11 The challenge in adapting The Shape of Things to Come for the screen was to turn Wells’s polemical manifesto into a dramatic and coherent film story. Wells recognized that the film would need to be different from the book. In his preface to the published film story he wrote: ‘The Shape of Things to Come is essentially an imaginative discussion of social and political forces and possibilities, and a film is no place for argument. The conclusions of that book are therefore taken for granted in this film and a new story has been invented to display them.’12 Korda paid Wells £10,000 for the screen rights and adaptation. Wells was also contracted to write The Man Who Could Work Miracles, from one of his early short stories, though in the event this was largely the work of Korda’s regular contributor Lajos Biró.13 Wells was very much involved, however, in the preparation of Things to Come, or Whither Mankind? as it was originally known. His first treatment, which does not survive, was rejected by Korda and director William Cameron Menzies as being ‘quite impracticable for production’.14 His second treatment, however, is recognizable as the blueprint of the final film. This treatment abandons the framing device of the ‘dream book’ and omits most of the asides on intellectual and scientific developments\n\nChapman_Chap02.indd Sec1:29\n\n12/12/2012 12:47:55 PM\n\n30\n\nProjecting Tomorrow\n\nthat occupy whole chapters of The Shape of Things to Come. The complex historical processes described in the book are represented through archetypal characters, and whereas the book offers a broad-brush account of world events, the treatment narrows the focus to the British city of ‘Everytown’. Wells included detailed notes on particular sequences, especially regarding aspects of design, and suggested that instead of credits at the beginning, the audience should be presented with a printed programme: ‘This is a long needed innovation upon cinema practice. It is in the interest of everyone ... Few people remember the names that are just flashed on the screen.’15 Whither Mankind? opens in Everytown at Christmas against a background of growing international tensions. The three principal characters – engineer John Cabal, idealistic doctor Edward Harding and businessman ‘Pippa’ Passworthy – are introduced discussing the worsening international crisis. War breaks out and Everytown is subjected to heavy aerial bombardment followed by a gas attack. Cabal, a pilot, shoots down an enemy airman who, fatally wounded, gives his gas mask to a little girl (‘I’ve given it to others, why shouldn’t I have a whiff myself?’). War continues, through a montage of newspaper banners, until 1968, when we are reintroduced to Harding, who is trying to find a cure for the pestilence known as the Wandering Sickness, ‘which is destroying mankind’. Everytown is now ruled by a gangster known as the Boss. Society has regressed politically and technologically: the Boss has an air force of unserviceable planes and his army wear rag-tag uniforms. In 1975 Cabal arrives back in Everytown in a futuristic aeroplane. He represents the World Transport Board (which in the film becomes the rather more impressive-sounding ‘Wings Over the World’), an organization that comprizes ‘we who are all that is left of the old technical services, the old engineers and industrial machinists ... We alone can pull the world together.’ Cabal is imprisoned by the Boss, but escapes and subdues the Boss and his men with peace gas. Wells then describes the rebuilding of Everytown. In 2054 Cabal’s descendant, Oswald Cabal, is President of the Council. He and Raymond Passworthy discuss the Space Gun that is about to fire the first human beings to the Moon: Cabal’s daughter and Passworthy’s son are among the crew. An artist called Theotocopulos (the only character who also features in the book) opposes the launch. He rouses a mob to destroy the Space Gun but is too late. The treatment ends with Cabal pontificating on the choice for humanity: ‘If we are no more than animals – we must love and suffer and pass and matter no more – than all the other animals do or have done. It is that – or this? All the universe – or nothingness. Which will it be, Passworthy?’ It is evident from the treatment that Wells, for all his inexperience as a screenwriter, nevertheless had a coherent vision for the shape and structure\n\nChapman_Chap02.indd Sec1:30\n\n12/12/2012 12:47:55 PM\n\nThe Prophet and the Showman\n\n31\n\nof the film. He described it in musical terms and suggested that it should be understood as being like an opera: The film consists of four main parts. The first part (Pastorale) represents A Christmas Party under (practically) PRESENT CONDITIONS. No date. War breaks out and the chief character reappears in the second part (Marche Funèbre), The Episode of the Two Aviators (1940). A series of short exposures then shows war, degenerating into SOCIAL CHAOS, leading to the third part, which begins in The Darkest Hour of the Pestilence, shows The Wandering Sickness at its Climax (1960), and the revolt of the airmen, technicians and men of science, who achieve Resurrection amidst the Ruins. The third part is set in A SPECTACLE OF IMMENSE RUIN. Everything is done to summon up a vision of our present world smashed. Then comes a rapid series to convey WORK, leading up to the counter vision of what can be done with our world ... The fourth part (Chorale) is THE WORLD IN 2054. This concentrates on fresh spectacular effects. If they are not surprising and magnificent and REAL the whole film falls down. The interest of this latter part brings the drama of creative effort versus the resistances of jealousy, indolence and sentimentality, to a culmination.16 Wells added a note to the effect that the dates in the treatment ‘are merely rough indications’: the finished film would set its climax in 2036, a hundred years in the future. It is instructive to consider what Wells’s treatment omits from the book and what it adds. The major omissions are the critique of democratic government and the suppression of organized religion. The omission of these themes would almost certainly have been necessary in order to meet the strictures of censorship: the British Board of Film Censors forbade any criticism of institutions such as Parliament and the Church.17 Censorship would also account for the fact that the identity of the country which attacks Britain is not revealed. (In the book the Second World War begins with a pre-emptive Polish attack on Germany: Britain remains neutral.) The main additions are the sequence depicting Everytown under the dictatorship of the Boss, and the climax involving the Space Gun. The Space Gun now seems the most risible aspect of the film: it is not clear why Wells adopted this quaint throwback to Jules Verne and George Méliès at a time when rocket technology was becoming a reality. There were also some themes in the treatment that did not make it into the finished film. It includes more discussion of the social organization and technology of the future. It also includes unusual references to Hindu\n\nChapman_Chap02.indd Sec1:31\n\n12/12/2012 12:47:56 PM\n\n32\n\nProjecting Tomorrow\n\ndeities – unusual in the sense that Wells himself was not religious – that are overlaid onto the characterizations. It suggests that the dramatic structure was based on the Hindu trinity – Brahma the Creator, Siva the Destroyer and Vishnu the Possessor – which ‘express the main forces in the world about us’.18 This reflects Wells’s intellectual ambition, but in the event Korda’s commercial instincts prevailed and the idea was discarded. It would seem unlikely that many British or American cinema-goers in the 1930s would have been sufficiently well versed in Hindu theology to understand it.19 Things to Come went before the cameras early in 1935: such was the scale of the film that it occupied sets at two studios (Elstree and Worton Hall), while exteriors were shot at Denham Studios, Korda’s state-of-the-art new complex still in the process of being built. The production employed ‘every resource and discovery of modern film technique’.20 Korda assembled a top-drawer creative team including William Cameron Menzies, the leading Hollywood production designer, to direct; special effects supervisor Ned Mann (known at Denham as ‘The Mann Who Could Work Miracles’); French cinematographer Georges Périnal, who had shot The Private Life of Henry VIII and Sanders of the River; and Korda’s brother Vincent as art director. It was Wells’s initiative to hire British composer Arthur Bliss, despite Bliss never having written a film score before, after attending a lecture at the Royal Academy of Music. ‘Something that I said on this occasion must have caught Wells’s attention,’ Bliss recalled in his autobiography, ‘for he invited me to lunch, and there and then spoke of his projected film based on his book The Shape of Things to Come, and asked me whether I would like to collaborate with him by writing the musical score.’21 Wells’s interest in the music of Things to Come demonstrates how he tried to impose his impramatur on every aspect of its production. On one occasion, for example, he wrote to Bliss: ‘I am not sure about the Finale ... It’s good – nothing you do can fail to be good – but it"
