In ancient Greece the oracles of the gods foretold future events, while in the Old Testament, prophets of the Lord counseled Biblical kings. In the 21st century, science has replaced magic and religion as an explanation for these unusual abilities, talents the public continues to regard with a mixture of awe, fear and skepticism. What, exactly, is meant by the term “psychic”? The word derives from the classical Greek word psyche, meaning the soul, the spirit, or the mind. Webster’s dictionary deﬁnes psychic as both an adjective (“lying outside the sphere of physical science or knowledge”) and a noun (“a person apparently sensitive to nonphysical forces”). These deﬁnitions describe the psychic realm as an occult territory existing apart from our everyday world of logic and science, and individuals who function within this realm as “sensitives” with special powers of mind. The word psychic evokes a variety of cinematic icons, from wizened, Old World fortune-tellers to high-tech Jedi Knights. In the movies, psychics are usually portrayed as tormented, misunderstood loners whose paranormal powers make them unable to ﬁt into mainstream human society. Sometimes the psychic individual is even an inhuman, extraterrestrial being. The world of moviepsi is overlaid with supernatural imagery and is frequently presented in terms of ghosts, demons and other denizens of the netherworld. Fiction ﬁlms about the psychic realm do not constitute a separate genre, but are culled from the ranks of the horror, science ﬁction, ﬁlm noir and dramatic genres (although the vast majority of them are to be found in a horror/sci-ﬁ vein). This is in stark contrast to the pursuit of psi in the real world, where scientists strive to bring the light of reason and the scientiﬁc method to the study of the paranormal. The term psi (rhymes with I) is derived from a letter of the Greek alphabet that is used by parapsychologists to describe anomalous phenomena such as precognition, clairvoyance, telepathy and psychokinesis. It 1\n\n2\n\nPreface\n\ncame into usage in the 1950s to replace the word “psychic,” which had fallen into scientiﬁc disrepute. Contrary to popular belief, individuals with augmented psychic abilities are in most cases not signiﬁcantly different from the normal human population. Additionally, the most advanced psi research suggests some degree of psychic ability resides within everyone. Parapsychologists have focused on researching four principal psychic abilities: • Precognition: the ability to perceive future events before they occur • Clairvoyance: the visualization of objects or events at a distance • Telepathy: the power to send or receive information from another person’s mind • Psychokinesis: the ability to affect the physical world using thought alone The most dramatic and cinematic of these psi abilities is psychokinesis (sometimes abbreviated as PK). Movie psychics routinely wield great powers of mind-over-matter in blockbusters and cult favorites such as The Medusa Touch, Carrie, Scanners, Star Wars and X-Men, where they are able to hurl large objects around with their PK abilities without breaking much of a sweat. In the real world this level of psychic energy is only manifested in cases involving poltergeists, which occur in “the ﬁeld” and are not generally amenable to laboratory study. Demonstrations of the existence of PK in the lab have proven elusive, but this hasn’t stopped Hollywood from exploiting the more sensational implications of psychokinesis. As for clairvoyance, precognition and telepathy, these psi powers are not as visually dramatic but have featured in memorable ﬁlms in a variety of genres such as The Night Has a Thousand Eyes, Resurrection, The Eyes of Laura Mars, Don’t Look Now, The Last Wave, The Dead Zone, The Green Mile, The Gift and Minority Report. The medium of ﬁlm is ideally suited to render the fantastic world of psi visible. A technique as simple as an off-screen voice-over can simulate mental telepathy. Unusual lighting, set design, fades, dissolves and other optical tricks can conjure clairvoyant visions. The advent of ultra-sophisticated computer graphics and other exotic cinematic techniques have made it possible to picture any conceivable visionary state, no matter how unusual or bizarre. There is, to be sure, a negative aspect to the study of psi. Carny hucksters, conﬁdence men, fortune tellers and phony mediums have exploited a credulous belief in psychic powers, from time immemorial to the more recent depredations of Uri Geller and the Psychic Friends Network. The skeptical/cynical view of ESP (extrasensory perception) is represented in a number of ﬁlms about bogus psychics, swamis and magicians involved in criminal schemes. Examples include Nightmare Alley, The Amazing Mr. X, Man on a Swing, Family Plot and Seance on a Wet Afternoon. These ﬁlms explore the potential psychological dangers of an uncritical belief in these poorly understood phenomena. Throughout its history, parapsychology has been considered a “fringe”\n\nPreface\n\n3\n\nsubject unworthy of serious scientiﬁc inquiry. The dubious academics portrayed in the Ghostbusters ﬁlms by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, who are hounded out of their ivory tower by skeptical university administrators, present a comic take on reality. Despite decades of research, the scientiﬁc establishment remains hostile to the existence of ESP because of their attitude of “It can’t be, therefore it isn’t.” Despite the acceptance of the Parapsychological Association as a valid discipline by the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1969, institutional science continued to turn up its collective nose at the notion of psi. Then, in the late 1960s, reports began to ﬁlter out of the Soviet bloc that the Communists had developed a sudden interest in psychic phenomena. Russian and Eastern European psi research programs, geared toward intelligence gathering and mind control were reportedly serious and well-funded by their Communist sponsors. The implications for American national security were ominous, especially if the Reds were to make breakthrough discoveries in parapsychology. In order to counter this perceived threat, beginning in the early 1970s the U.S. intelligence services began funding psychic research at the esteemed Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in Palo Alto, California. The SRI psi research went underground by the end of the decade, and the existence of an American psychic espionage unit of “remote viewers” was not revealed to the public until the late 1990s, by which time the psi-spy outﬁt had been disbanded. Although the track record of the psychic spies in deciphering enemy secrets was decidedly mixed, there were reportedly some spectacular successes, including the discovery of a downed Soviet bomber on the African continent by an American remote viewing team in 1978 that was later conﬁrmed by former president Jimmy Carter.\n\nPsi and the Occult From the time of prehistoric shamans to the 21st century, psychic functioning has had a whiff of the supernatural about it despite the best efforts of the science-minded to bring psi out of the darkness of the occult. Individuals endowed with psychic powers are frequently demonized in horror/sci-ﬁ ﬂicks in order to exploit the darker aspects of the psi phenomenon at the box ofﬁce. This is perfectly illustrated in Brian de Palma’s psychic thriller Carrie (1976), in which a sensitive, innocent teenager (Sissy Spacek) with telekinetic powers is instantaneously transformed, via a sadistic prank, into a psychotic, bloodsoaked avenger who brutally murders her high school classmates before stalking off to her own death. On the other end of the spectrum are suave, veddy British psychotronic killers such as Michael Rennie in The Power, Richard Burton in The Medusa Touch and Ben Kingsley in Suspect Zero. Somewhere in between are sinister American psychic villians like Michael Ironside in Scanners\n\n4\n\nPreface\n\nor Andrew Stevens in The Fury. Needless to say, these psi-powered assassins have little if any basis in reality. While the mechanics of psychic functioning are still not clearly understood, researchers have taken pains to separate psi from the supernatural world of ghosts and spirits. There is one phenomenon, however, that deﬁes easy categorization: the poltergeist. Derived from a German word that means “noisy ghost,” poltergeists constitute the most extreme and dramatic manifestation of psychic power; however parapsychologists are divided as to the true nature of the poltergeist. Some researchers postulate that the phenomenon is the result of “recurring spontaneous psychokinesis” (or RSPK), while others believe that spirit beings are responsible for the effect. As the RSPK theory is currently in vogue among parapsychologists, ﬁlms about poltergeists can be considered a part of the psychic continuum.\n\nPsi and Mysticism Some ESP-themed ﬁlms emphasize a mystical or religious approach to psi. In the Star Wars ﬁlms, for instance, the Jedi Knights derive their paranormal powers from “the Force,” a thinly-veiled substitute for God, and their organization constitutes a neo-pagan order of psychic warriors devoted to “bringing peace and justice to the Galaxy.” Similarly, in Dune the protagonist’s extraordinary psi powers inspire a futuristic Islamic messiah cult to perpetrate a galactic jihad. In dramatic treatments of the theme such as Resurrection and The Gift, psychics living in conservative rural communities are persecuted by zealous religious individuals who believe their powers derive from demonic sources. Obeying the Old Testament dictum “Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live,” the religionists plot murder against psychics.\n\nPsychics and Crime Psychics have frequently been associated with criminal behavior in movies, either as criminals or as paranormal sleuths. Films noir of the 1940s tended to portray psychics and mediums as slick crooks and manipulative swindlers in ﬁlms like Nightmare Alley and The Amazing Mr. X. This theme was later carried forward in thrillers such as Séance on a Wet Afternoon and Family Plot. In addition to perpetrating thievery, psychics used their powers to commit homicide in The Power, Patrick, Psychic Killer, Dreamscape and The Medusa Touch. As in real life, where psychics are sometimes called upon to aid the police in solving murders, individuals gifted with psi powers have been involved in bringing killers to justice in a number of ﬁlms. The standard plot formula\n\nPreface\n\n5\n\ninvolves a psychic (usually female) who inadvertently begins receiving visions of a murder or series of murders being committed in the vicinity. Information essential to solving the crime is passed along to detectives, who are generally skeptical and even suspicious about the psychic’s visionary evidence, but who come around to a grudging acceptance of psi by the last reel. This is the basic (and by now clichéd) plotline of such psi-oriented fare as The Psychic, The Dark, Man on a Swing, In Dreams and The Gift.\n\nAlien Psi Some of the most gifted cinematic psychics are non-human or partly human extraterrestrials. Psychic aliens in ﬁlms have been around from the early 1950s, and have been endowed by screenwriters with paranormal powers of telepathy, telepathic hypnotism and psychokinesis. Oddly, telepathic aliens have also been reported in real-world cases of alien abduction. These psi abilities enable them to exert their will over the non-psychic general population of humankind and to visit all manner of mischief on hapless homo sapiens. Like superior intelligence, psi powers are a hallmark of the E.T.’s superior mental capabilities. The only defense lies in using earthling psychics to counter them. In the alien invasion blockbuster Independence Day, for instance, the President of the United States (played by Bill Pullman) has a psychic exchange with one of the aliens and uncovers their motivations. Not all extraterrestrials use their powers for evil, however. Some of them, like the beneﬁcent aliens of Starman and E.T. use their powers for healing and other good deeds, while everybody’s favorite spaceman, Star Trek’s Mr. Spock, is well-known for his use of the telepathic “Vulcan mind meld” to help the crew of the starship Enterprise out of some very tight spots.\n\nSci-Fi Psi While movie aliens seem to be generously endowed with psi, other science ﬁction ﬁlms also explore the ramiﬁcations of psi talents in human individuals. The most well-known example is, of course, in the Star Wars series, in which psychic individuals are recognized, recruited and trained by the organization of the Jedi Knights to function as a corps of paranormal paramilitary troops who enforce the dictums of a galactic empire. Similarly, in Dune, guilds exploiting various ESP powers vie with each other for dominance of a star-ﬂung imperial culture. In Starship Troopers human psychics use their talents to hunt and destroy fearsome alien arachnids, while in Minority Report a group of psychic “precogs” visualize murders before they happen.\n\n6\n\nPreface\n\nDrama and Comedy Outside the realm of melodrama, psi phenomena have also been featured in a number of ﬁlms that are primarily dramatic, including The Clairvoyant, Resurrection, The Green Mile and Premonition. These ﬁlms tend to treat the theme in a more serious and thoughtful fashion. Paranormal themes also crop up occasionally in dramatic ﬁlms that are not fundamentally about psi. Examples include Juarez, 8 1 ⁄2, Fanny and Alexander and Shadow of a Doubt. The psychic world can also provide material for comedy, as evidenced in such varied fare as Wilder Napalm, Ghostbusters and What Women Want, and in kiddie fare like Escape from Witch Mountain, Matilda and The Last Mimzy.\n\nPsychic Paranoia During the 1980s, news reports detailing CIA malfeasance against U.S. citizens and rumors about clandestine government ESP programs inspired a ﬂurry of movies in which well-funded espionage agencies, staffed by a corps of evil bureaucrats, conducted unholy experiments that produced homicidal psychic warriors with terrifying paranormal powers. Your tax dollars were hard at work on psychic black ops projects in ﬁlms like Dreamscape, Scanners, The Lawnmower Man, The Fury and Firestarter. These ﬁlms served to create paranoia about psi, which was shown in a negative, even demonic light, while at the same time exploiting paranoid anxieties about a “secret government” wielding quasioccult powers designed to subjugate the populace.\n\nInto the Psychic Wilderness These are some of the themes running through popular ﬁlms that have served to inform public attitudes about ESP. For the most part, they have tended to exploit the negative aspects of the phenomenon and portray psychics as threatening monstrosities, marginal schizoid individuals, and even aliens, characterizations that grossly distort the nature of psi and minimize its positive aspects. On one level this is due to the greed of Hollywood ﬁlm-makers eager to exploit the more fantastic implications of psi, but on another level this also represents a visceral uneasiness about the nature of ESP itself. The very idea of psi deﬁes our commonsense view of reality and challenges us on the level of phenomenology and epistemology; this disquieting mental undertow is reﬂected in the mirror of cinema. This uneasiness about psi is especially true of psychics themselves, who must live with the disturbing implications of their extraordinary experiences.\n\nPreface\n\n7\n\nThis, then, is a journey into another realm, a dimension, as Rod Serling used to say, not only of sight and sound, but of mind. It is a trip one step beyond the Twilight Zone, a voyage over the threshold into a brave new world of dazzling ﬁlmic possibilities.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n• ONE •\n\nA Brief History of the Paranormal in Fact and Fiction Although there are no written records, psychic phenomena have been part of human culture since prehistory. In analyzing the nature of still-existing preindustrial societies, anthropologists have documented the role of individuals they refer to as shamans. They are, in essence, “witch doctors” who utilize apparently paranormal abilities for the beneﬁt of the tribe. Shamans are reportedly able to locate lost objects, foretell future events and heal illnesses, and are usually highly respected within their societies. Cave paintings thought to represent shamans dating back to the Paleolithic period attest to their great antiquity. Shamanic practices have survived into the modern world, as depicted in Peter Weir’s apocalyptic thriller The Last Wave (1977). Divinatory techniques were commonplace in the emerging civilizations of Egypt, China, India and Mesopotamia, where written records of such practices date back to the Second Millennium B.C. In ancient Sumeria, the ﬁrst civilization in history, the will of the gods was ascertained in dreams and in the interpretation of the size and shape of the livers of sacriﬁced animals. Bronze Age China developed a system of fortune-telling based on a book called the I Ching, which is still used in the East (and West) in modern times. Texts such as The Leyden Papyrus have preserved the divinatory formulas of ancient Egypt.\n\nThe Delphic Oracle In Classical Greek and Roman times, divinely-inspired oracles delivered prophecies of future events. The most famous of these was the Oracle at Delphi, where a prophetess called the Pythia foretold the future while in an altered state of consciousness induced by vapors rising from a deep cleft in the earth. The oracle was consulted on matters of war by emperors and kings, and had a profound effect on the history of the Western World. In a famous story recounted by the Greek historian Herotodus, Croesus, the wealthy ruler of the 9\n\n10\n\nCinema of the Psychic Realm\n\ngold-rich kingdom of Lydia, was contemplating an attack on the Persian Empire and decided to test the various oracles to ascertain which was the most accurate. He sent messengers to the seven most prominent oracles to query them about what King Croesus was doing at that exact moment. Only the oracle at Delphi conveyed the correct answer, namely that the king was boiling a lamb and a tortoise together in a cauldron made of brass. On the basis of this contest, Croesus decided to ask the Pythia if he would be victorious if he attacked the Persian Empire. The oracle replied, in typically opaque fashion, that if he attacked the Persians, a great empire would fall. Unfortunately, when Croesus acted on this advice, it was his own empire that fell. Croesus’s contest between the oracles is considered the ﬁrst test of remote viewing recorded in history. Another famous incident from Greek history also highlights the importance of Delphi. As depicted in the ﬁlm 300 (2007), the Persian King Xerxes I launched an invasion of Greece in 480 B.C., which was opposed chieﬂy by King Leonidas of Sparta and the fearsome warriors of his city-state. The Oracle was consulted regarding the prospects for a Greek victory, and the answer came back that Sparta could only be saved from destruction by the death of one of its kings. On the basis of this prophecy, Leonidas decided on a suicidal defense of the pass of Thermopylae accompanied by 300 of his best warriors against overwhelming odds. Although the Persians ultimately prevailed at Thermopylae and Leonidas was killed in battle, Xerxes was later defeated when the Greeks united, having been inspired by the resistance of the 300 Spartans.\n\nPsi in the Bible In the Old Testament of the Bible, divinely-inspired prophets foretold future events and provided clairvoyant information about the enemies of Israel. The word “prophet” derives from the Greek word “prophetes,” meaning “to speak before” or “proclaim.” In Hebrew the term is nabi, meaning “to utter.” Like the Delphic Oracle, the Hebrew prophets functioned as psychic mediums who received messages and visions from a higher power and provided information that enabled rulers to make important decisions. The ﬁrst nabi is generally considered to be the patriarch Moses; other important prophets wrote books of the Old Testament, including Samuel, Jeremiah, Isaiah, Daniel and Ezekiel. According to the prophet Daniel, the holy seer “reveals deep and secret things; he knows what is in the darkness and light dwells within him” (Dan. 2:22). These powers of divination were frequently used to provide vital information in times of crisis. For instance, the prophet Elisha instructed King Joash to throw two arrows through a window in order to determine whether the king would be victorious in battle (2 Kings 13:14–19). Elisha also used his clairvoyant abilities to bafﬂe the king of Syria during a military campaign by report-\n\nOne • A Brief History of the Paranormal in Fact and Fiction\n\n11\n\ning the Syrian’s location to the Hebrew king. One of the Syrians explained to his king that “Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber” (2 Kings 6–12). In addition, another method of divination discussed in the Bible involved the use of the “Urim and Thummin,” sacred stones or gems that were manipulated by both prophets and priests to foretell the future. The Old Testament also mentions similar divinatory techniques practiced by contemporary cultures in the ancient Near East. In Ezekiel 21:21 we read: “For the King of Babylon stands at the parting of the road, at the fork of the two roads, to use divination. He shakes the arrows, he consults the images, he looks at the liver.” While legitimate prophets of the Lord were highly esteemed by the Israelites, anyone else practicing divination outside of the approved religious framework was subject to severe censure or even death. The book of Deuteronomy, one of the books of Jewish law attributed to Moses, clearly spells out these penalties: “But that prophet or dreamer of dreams shall be put to death because he has spoken in order to turn you away from the Lord your God” (Deut. 13:5). The book also states more explicitly, “There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the ﬁre, or one who practices witchcraft, or a soothsayer, or one who interprets omens, or a sorcerer, or one who conjures spells, or a medium, or a spiritist, or one who calls up the dead. For all who do these things are an abomination to the Lord, and because of these abominations the Lord your God drives them out from before you.” (Deut 18:10–12). The most succinct and oft-quoted passage on the subject is found in Exodus 22:18, which states ﬂatly, “Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.” These ultra-strict religious injunctions would negatively affect attitudes toward psychics and ESP for millennia, and they continue to have repercussions on the study of psi in the present day. In the New Testament, Jesus is reported to have performed many miracles, including healings and levitation on water. After the death of Jesus, some of these divine powers were bestowed upon his disciples, notably Peter, who travelled to Rome to spread the gospel of Christianity as related in the Book of Acts. One of Peter’s rivals was a famous magician named Simon Magus, who sought to duplicate or hoax the miracles of Jesus in order to establish a cult of personality around himself that would rival the Christian faith. The story of Simon Magus is dramatized in the ﬁction ﬁlm The Silver Chalice (1954), in which Paul Newman (in his screen debut) plays Basil, a Greek slave and artisan who is commissioned by Christian leaders to fashion a chalice to hold the cup from which Jesus drank during the Last Supper. When he embraces Christianity, Basil runs afoul of the ﬂamboyant pagan sorcerer Simon Magus (Jack Palance), who claims to have powers greater than those of Christ. Believing his own hype, Simon arranges for a public display of his supernatural talents. Claiming that he has the ability to ﬂy, he jumps from a tall tower\n\n12\n\nCinema of the Psychic Realm\n\nand promptly plummets to his death, while onlookers shake their heads in bafﬂement at the spectacle and scornfully observe, “He didn’t ﬂy.” This story illustrates the attitude of the Christian church toward those who claim to have paranormal powers. While proof of Jesus’s divinity rests upon the miraculous feats as reported in the Gospels, anyone else claiming to have preternatural talents is regarded as a heretical “false Christ.” Later church doctrine introduced the concept of the “Antichrist,” a demonic analog of Jesus who Christian prophecies foretold would appear in the last times before Judgment Day to confound the faithful with false miracles accomplished through the power of Satan. Thus anyone demonstrating psi powers outside of the approved religious framework would be considered dangerous and diabolical, and perhaps even be branded as the Antichrist.\n\nRome, Christianity and the End of the Ancient Prophetic Traditions Like the Greeks before them, the Romans practiced forms of pagan divination. Roman seers known as augurs were authorized to interpret the will of the gods according to their observations of the skies. By the late Republic period there were sixteen ofﬁcial augurs who looked at lightning ﬂashes, cloud formations and ﬂights of birds to issue edicts that decided the election of Roman magistrates, dictated military tactics, and judgments about important legal matters. Many lesser seers and soothsayers also plied their trade in the city, typiﬁed by the sayer of sooth who famously warns Caesar to “Beware the Ides of March” in Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar. Also popular were the haruspices, individuals who practiced a form of divination based on the inspection of the liver and entrails of sacriﬁced animals. All this would change abruptly as Christianity began to replace the pagan cults as the state religion of the Empire in the fourth century A.D., which culminated in the declaration of the new faith as the ofﬁcial Roman religion under the Emperor Constantine. Once in power, the Christians suppressed the ancient pagan ways by imposing strict penalties on their practice. While paganism was for the most part tolerant of the various and sundry cults contained within the vast mosaic of the Empire, Christianity would accept no other gods and ruthlessly destroyed all of its divine competitors. In A.D. 398 the Temple of Apollo at Delphi was torn down, and an oracular legend of great antiquity faded into obscurity. Similarly, prophetic traditions among the Hebrews had also lapsed and were entirely non-existent by the time of Christ in the ﬁrst century A.D. With injunctions against psychics and seers embedded in their scriptures, priestly castes among both Jews and Christians replaced prophets and oracles, declaring them anathema. This situation prevailed for the next 1400 years of Western civilization, exacerbated by the witch hunts of the Middle Ages in\n\nOne • A Brief History of the Paranormal in Fact and Fiction\n\n13\n\nEurope and the forced conversion of “heathen” religious practitioners as Christianity was spread by the sword. Charismatic seers like Joan of Arc usually wound up being burned at the stake for practicing witchcraft. In spite of this persecution, folk healers and “dowsers” (psychics who use a forked stick to locate water and other objects underground) continued to ply their trade in rural areas.\n\nThe Return of the Paranormal Things did not begin to loosen up until after the Enlightenment, when the absolute authority of religion began to be questioned. By the 19th century, a number of popular movements had arisen that would lead to the development of parapsychology as a scientiﬁc discipline. One of these was Mesmerism, a movement started by the Viennese doctor Franz Mesmer in Paris in the late 1700s. Mesmer was basically a quack who submerged his patients in baths ﬁlled with iron ﬁlings and stared directly into their eyes in order to induce trance states. It was observed that certain entranced persons, referred to as “somnambules” or “clairvoyants,” seemed to exhibit paranormal skills and became renowned psychic celebrities. By Mesmer’s death in 1815, Mesmeric salons had emerged all over Europe. Some of his techniques eventually developed into the modern practice of hypnotism. Another popular psi-oriented movement of the time was Spiritualism, which had its genesis in 1847 when two sisters, Margaretta and Catherine Fox, reported a series of strange rapping noises on the farm where they lived in Hydesville, New York. These anomalous raps were allegedly communications from spirit beings, who could in this way answer “yes” or “no” to questions. Later, the sisters devised a code to correspond to individual letters of the alphabet in order to facilitate more elaborate communications from the spirit world. The rapping spirits soon spread from the Fox household to the surrounding communities, as people set up their own séance groups and found that they could produce similar phenomena. Spiritualism, as the new movement was called, soon spread throughout America and Europe as psychic “mediums” supposedly summoned spirits in hundreds of darkened séance parlors. Spiritualist practitioners believed that mediums could speak with the dead, levitate and materialize objects, clairvoyantly reveal hidden information and produce writings penned by spirit beings. The heady world of Spiritualism was delightfully satirized in David Lean’s ﬁlm version of Noël Coward’s play Blithe Spirit (1945). In the ﬁlm, a dotty bogus medium played by Margaret Rutherford (best known for her screen portrayal of Agatha Christie’s dowager sleuth Miss Marple in a series of British comedy/mysteries), holds a séance where she attempts to summon the spirit of Rex Harrison’s deceased wife. To everyone’s surprise the wife’s ghost (Kay Ham-\n\n14\n\nCinema of the Psychic Realm\n\nmond) promptly materializes, much to the chagrin of Harrison’s current spouse (Constance Cummings), and a living/dead love triangle ensues. This supernatural bedroom farce pokes gentle fun at Spiritualism, although it turns out that there is a true medium, a humble servant girl, in the household. The proliferation of spirit mediumship led to widespread fraud and abuse, as bogus mediums bilked the credulous out of their life savings. Despite the fact that Margaretta Fox had recanted and declared the Fox family medium to be fraudulent in 1888, the belief in spirits in séances remained popular and had become something of a social problem by the late 19th century. In an attempt to separate the psychic wheat from the chaff, the ﬁrst paranormal research organization, the Society for Psychical Research (SPR), was formed in London in 1882. Founding members of the SPR included luminaries such as physicists Sir Oliver Lodge and Sir William Crookes, Cambridge philosopher Henry Sidgwick, psychologist Fredrick Myers, Nobel prize–winning physiologist Charles Richet, the poet William Butler Yeats and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes. This august assemblage of scientiﬁc and literary talent was charged with the mission of “making an organized and systematic attempt to investigate the larger group of phenomena designated by such terms as mesmeric, psychical, and spiritualistic.” An American offshoot, the American Society for Psychical Research (ASPR), was formed in Boston in 1885. The scientiﬁc search for psi had begun. Despite their lofty pedigree, the SPR and ASPR failed to establish the study of the paranormal as a valid scientiﬁc discipline. Part of the problem was with the questionable nature of mediumship itself, which was rife with fraud and abuse. The famed magician and escape artist Harry Houdini conducted a personal crusade against these bogus mediums that was covered extensively in the press. As depicted in George Pal’s 1953 biopic Houdini, the magician had become obsessed with the afterlife after the death of his mother and brieﬂy fell under the sway of mediums, only to discover that it was all a sham. Afterward, Houdini employed his skills as an illusionist to uncover the trickery that created the mirage of the supernatural in the séance room. These revelations did nothing to bolster the case for psychic phenomena in the public mind. Additionally, the paradigms of the material world as understood by turn-of-the-century science were unable to accommodate psi phenomena within any scientiﬁcally recognized framework. Author Jim Schnabel observes in his book Remote Viewing, “It became increasingly fashionable among scientists to portray psi as a primitive, retrograde fantasy which modernity was swiftly leaving behind.”1\n\nMental Radio The development of radio technology in the late 19th century led to the formulation of the concept of telepathy, or mind-to-mind thought transference. The term was coined in 1882 by F.W.H. Myers, one of the founders of the SPR.\n\nOne • A Brief History of the Paranormal in Fact and Fiction\n\n15\n\nTelepathy was believed to function in a manner analogous to radio, in which a “sender” broadcast a signal through the ether to a “receiver” using ultra-low frequency radio waves. In the 1930s this idea was popularized by the respected American novelist Upton Sinclair in his remarkable book Mental Radio. Sinclair, who would win a Pulitzer Prize, was best known for his hard-hitting journalistic novels such as The Jungle, an exposé of the American meat packing business. Mental Radio was a nonﬁction account of a series of telepathy experiments Sinclair conducted with his wife of ﬁfty years, Mary Craig Sinclair, and other psychics during the 1920s. Sinclair’s pioneering work concentrated on sending and receiving pictorial information via telepathy. His experiments revealed an important insight: psychic information exchange was primarily visual in nature rather than verbal. In fact, attempts to build a conceptual, language-based framework around the images actually interfered with the telepathic process. Sinclair’s insights regarding the visual nature of psi were independently validated by a contemporary, French chemist and parapsychologist René Warcollier, who also noted a visual basis for psi. Unfortunately, Warcollier’s 1946 book Mind to Mind was not widely available in English translation, and his work fell into obscurity. Sinclair and Warcollier’s work provided valuable clues into the imagebased nature of psychic functioning, but the signiﬁcance of their research would not become apparent until decades later, when their insights would be instrumental in formulating basic remote viewing theories during the 1970s. The notion that telepathy functioned through the action of radio waves or via some other form of electromagnetic energy would prove to be a blind alley for Soviet and Western psi researchers, who would spend decades conducting experiments that ultimately disproved this hypothesis.\n\nParapsychology in the Laboratory A different approach to psi research was advocated by J. B. Rhine, a scientist who had become interested in the phenomenon in the 1920s. Rhine, a botanist by training, founded the Parapsychology Laboratory at Duke University in North Carolina in 1930, where he attempted to study psi under controlled conditions. Taking a statistical approach, he conducted hundreds of thousands of laboratory trials in order to prove that his results were greater than those that could be expected by chance alone. Rhine employed a specially designed deck of cards, called “Zener cards,” which were imprinted with ﬁve symbols: a star, a cross, a square, a circle and a pair of wavy lines. Picking a card, a “sender” would attempt to transmit the correct design to a telepathic “receiver,” and the results were recorded. This process is depicted in an amusing scene in Ghostbusters (1984), in which psychic researcher Dr. Venkman (Bill\n\n16\n\nCinema of the Psychic Realm\n\nMurray) dispenses electric shocks to student volunteers for incorrect Zener card guesses during an ESP experiment. Rhine coined the term “extrasensory perception,” abbreviated as ESP, to bring precognition and telepathy within the orbit of perceptual psychology and out of the shadows of the séance room. Similarly, in order to de-mythologize the concept of mind-over-matter, Rhine invented the word “psychokinesis” (or PK), and conducted statistical tests with dice-throwing to measure this psychic ability. After several years of experimentation at the Duke Lab, Rhine summarized his ﬁndings in a book entitled Extra-Sensory Perception, published in 1934. The book was well received in the American press and was followed by a sequel, Extra-Sensory Perception After 60 Years, in 1940. Rhine’s books were instrumental in bringing the concepts of psi to the attention of the general public. Despite Rhine’s scientiﬁc rigor, the study of ESP continued to be denounced as a pseudoscience by the academic establishment, and psychic research once again fell into obscurity. The Duke Lab’s statistical methodologies and experimental protocols were called into question as the conservative scientiﬁc establishment scrambled to debunk psi. Rhine’s best evidence for the existence of ESP and PK was in the statistical analysis of a large number of Zener card and dice-throwing trials, which showed positive guessing results that were only very slightly higher than chance. These dry stat tables did not appear to offer compelling proof for the claimed wonders of the paranormal realm. Additionally, later psi studies would determine that Rhine’s bean-counter approach to ESP research was so mind-numbing that it was actually antithetical to psychic functioning. Rhine and the Duke Parapsychology Lab continued to soldier on for decades, but ESP research became permanently marginalized, existing on the far fringes of orthodox science. Parapsychologists were ostracized, deprived of funding and forced to make do with private contributions from philanthropists, while publishing the results of their research in the Journal of Parapsychology and other obscure technical journals with a negligible readership.\n\nPsychic Poltergeists The most controversial, dramatic, and cinematic of psychic phenomena is the poltergeist. Derived from the German, the word means “noisy ghost,” a reference to the pandemonium caused by the phenomenon. A poltergeist causes objects (even large, heavy ones) to move around by themselves as if directed by invisible hands. Sometimes strange noises, raps or mysterious voices are heard. It can even cause apports, the de-materialization and re-materialization of solid objects. Ghost-like apparitions have also been reported, but are rare. Like psychic phenomena such as clairvoyance and precognition, accounts of poltergeists have been reported since antiquity. Perhaps the earliest case on record dates to 858 B.C., when a farmhouse near Bingen on the Rhine River was\n\nOne • A Brief History of the Paranormal in Fact and Fiction\n\n17\n\npelted with showers of stones from an unseen source; the “evil spirit” even caused the walls of the house to shake. Unlike a conventional haunting, which is conﬁned to a speciﬁc place (i.e., the “haunted house”), a poltergeist seems to attach itself to a speciﬁc person and will manifest itself wherever that person happens to be. In psychic terms, this individual is referred to as the “focus” of the poltergeist. Invariably the focus is a young person, in an age-range from early puberty to young adulthood. Researchers theorize that the poltergeist somehow feeds off of the intense psychosexual energies generated by adolescents and young adults. The phenomenon is believed to be caused by “unconscious” psychokinetic forces on the part of the focus individual, and is commonly referred to as “recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis,” or RSPK, by paranormal researchers. The RSPK hypothesis is an attempt to remove the phenomenon from the realm of the occult and transform it into a scientiﬁc anomaly that could be studied in the physical world. Unfortunately, researching the poltergeist in a laboratory setting proved to be highly problematic. The phenomenon prankishly refused to manifest itself under controlled conditions, and had to be studied in the ﬁeld at the location where the psychic outbursts occurred. Furthermore, the manifestations were frequently so complex that the idea they were caused or directed by the focus person strained credulity. Some researchers have noted similarities between the poltergeist phenomenon, multiple personality disorder and so-called “demonic” possession, all of which produce psychokinetic effects. While the precise nature of the poltergeist remains elusive, the RSPK hypothesis is still the prevailing one among ESP researchers and serves to bring the phenomenon out of the domain of the supernatural and into the light of scientiﬁc inquiry. No matter what its ultimate nature, the poltergeist has provided inspiration for a number of psychic thrillers, including Poltergeist (1982) and its three sequels. William Friedkin’s seminal horror classic The Exorcist (1973) was based on a reallife case that a number of psi researchers think was more probably a poltergeist manifestation than an example of demonic infestation, and the ﬁlm presents a number of instances of PK and telepathy. In the disappointing sequel, Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977), Linda Blair’s preternatural abilities are studied in a psychic laboratory setting. The notion that poltergeist-like PK effects could be harnessed and directed by individuals with psychic powers found its way into many a movie script, and would inspire a new generation of Scanners, Jedi Knights, X-Men and assorted psychic characters who came equipped with major-league PK.\n\nInto the Sixties As the paradigm-shifting Age of Aquarius moved into high gear in the 1960s, psychic researchers anticipated that the esoteric study of psi might ﬁnally achieve a higher level of scientiﬁc respectability. Although there was some move-\n\n18\n\nCinema of the Psychic Realm\n\nment toward acceptance within the scientiﬁc community, ESP research would remain a fringe discipline on the edge of pseudoscience throughout the decade. While popular belief in psi had risen to new heights, fueled in part by the use of psychedelic drugs during the swingin’ 60s, the conservative scientiﬁc establishment remained unconvinced. In 1969, at the urging of the esteemed anthropologist Margaret Mead, the American Association for the Advancement of Science admitted the Parapsychological Association into its group of approved scientiﬁc disciplines. In spite of this apparent victory, psi research continued to languish in a netherworld of academic non-respectability. Things would change in the following decade, however, as the U.S. Government secretly became involved in psychic research. Spurred by reports of Soviet developments in psychic spying, the CIA decided to conduct their own experiments into psychic functioning in the early 1970s. These studies were carried out at the Stanford Research Institute in Palo Alto, California, by physicists Russell Targ and Hal Puthoff. The two scientists designed a series of trials to test the psi talents of individuals under strict scientiﬁc protocols. The CIA-sponsored project in what came to be known as “remote viewing” was code-named “Project Scannate,” a term derived from the phrase “scanning by coordinate.” In 1976 the project graduated from research to applications when it was adopted by a unit of the U.S. Army’s Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) based at Ft. Meade, Maryland. Although much information about the project remains classiﬁed, the remote viewers were reportedly able to achieve upwards of 65 percent accuracy when run against hard espionage targets in the real world. One of the most spectacular of the program’s known successes came in 1978, when two SRI-trained remote viewers managed to locate a Soviet TU-22 bomber that had gone down in the African nation of Zaire before the KGB could get to it. This extraordinary incident was later publicly veriﬁed by former president Jimmy Carter. The Army/CIA remote viewing project kept a very low proﬁle for most of its existence, not only because its intelligence operations were classiﬁed, but also because of the embarrassment that would follow should the U.S. government’s dabbling in the paranormal ever become known to the public. Then in 1995 the government was forced to admit the existence of the project in connection with a lawsuit brought against the Army by a former viewer, David Morehouse, who claimed that he had suffered mental and emotional damage from his involvement with the Ft. Meade unit. Faced with having to reveal details of the psi-spy project, the CIA quickly issued a disclaimer. In September 1995, the agency’s Public Affairs Bureau issued a statement admitting the involvement of the U.S. military/intelligence communities with remote viewing, but claiming that psychic espionage had proven ineffective and was being discontinued immediately. Despite this ofﬁcial denial, many former psi-spies believe that the program has not been shelved, but has merely gone underground and faded into a deeper shade of black. The psychic cat, however, was\n\nOne • A Brief History of the Paranormal in Fact and Fiction\n\n19\n\nalready out of the bag. The results-oriented techniques developed for the program offered strong evidence for the reality of psi and pointed the way toward further avenues of research. Although the U.S. Government is ofﬁcially out of the psychic business, parapsychologists continue to probe the mysteries of psi. Current thinking has attempted to link ESP functioning to the topsy-turvy world of quantum physics. Scientists have observed that matter behaves differently on the quantum level, that is, on the level of the tiniest sub-atomic particles. In the quantum world matter can exist as both a wave and a particle simultaneously, and an object can be in two places at the same time as the familiar world of classical physics collapses. Paranormal researchers theorize that precognitive, telepathic or clairvoyant perception takes place on the quantum level, where the commonsense rules of the physical world no longer apply. While scientists continue to argue about the existence and nature of psi, the concept of ESP has taken root in an entirely different realm: in the fantastic alternate worlds of science ﬁction literature.\n\nPsi as a Literary Device ESP-related themes appear in works dating back to the beginning of literature. In the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh, which was composed in the Third Millennium B.C., the hero Gilgamesh has a precognitive dream about the coming of his fellow demigod Enkidu. Similarly, in a hymn to the deity Dumuzi from the Ancient Near East, the god dreams of the future circumstances of his own death. Tales from Classical Greek mythology are also replete with prophecies and oracles. One of the most dramatic is the story of the prophetess Cassandra, who had been granted the gift of prophecy by her lover, the god Apollo. When Cassandra later spurned the god, Apollo could not rescind the gift, so he laid a curse upon her so that no one would believe her predictions. In the tragedy Agamemnon by the Greek playwright Aeschylus, the Greek king Agamemnon returns to his homeland victorious after the Trojan War, with Cassandra in tow as his spoils. While the king is unaware that his wife and her lover are planning to murder him and seize the throne, Cassandra has already “seen” the regicide with her prophetic sight, and screams in terror as she is led into the royal palace, where she knows she is soon to be dispatched by the queen. Ancient Norse literature contains many references to precognitive and clairvoyant phenomena. As recounted in the Norse Eddas, the principal deity Odin trades one of his eyes for the power of the second sight. The hero of Njal’s Saga is an Icelandic Viking who possesses precognitive vision and is haunted by the prophetic revelation of his future death inside a burning house. Similarly\n\n20\n\nCinema of the Psychic Realm\n\nin the Arthurian cycle of tales from medieval Britain, the magician Merlin employs his magical powers of prognostication to advise King Arthur. While these myths and tales reﬂect a belief in psychic functioning held within these societies, it is also possible to view the idea of psi as a literary device used to increase dramatic tension. Consider, for instance, the use of the technique of the presentiment, in which characters experience a ﬂeeting vision of future events in the plot. A memorable example of this occurs in Dennis Hopper’s 1960s hippie anthem Easy Rider (1969), in which Peter Fonda’s character experiences brief ﬂash-forwards of his own death during the ﬁery climax of the ﬁlm. These glimpses of the future are not provided in the interest of showing that Fonda’s character is psychic, but rather to create a mood of sadness and inevitability about the proceedings. Thus the portrayal of psi in literature and ﬁlm can sometimes have more to do with the generation of dramatic frisson than with a portrayal of the reality of psychic phenomena.\n\nScience Fiction Psychics As literary science ﬁction emerged as a distinct genre in the early part of the 20th century, writers found inspiration for their fantastic adventures in the emerging realm of the psychic as explicated by the scientiﬁc studies of the Society for Psychical Research and the Duke Parapsychology Lab. Science ﬁction writers in this formative period tended to concentrate on exploring the provocative implications of telepathy rather than other paranormal abilities such as precognition, clairvoyance or psychokinesis. The notion of telepathy, with its radical possibilities, provided fertile ground for the exploration of human consciousness and speculation about the evolution of society. Sci-ﬁ writers coined the term “psionics” to describe the industrial application of psi in futuristic societies. Alfred Bester’s 1953 novel The Demolished Man, for instance, posits a future world in which an elite corps of mind-reading “Espers” pervades every institution of business and government. ESP abilities were usually portrayed as a positive force within society and, like atomic energy, computers or space travel, an emerging technology with transformative possibilities for humankind. Psi was the province of advanced, superior beings: aliens, mutants and supermen and women of every stripe. Not all assessments of psi by the sci-ﬁ crowd were positive, however. Some writers theorized that telepathic functioning might constitute a retrograde ability that may have had a negative survival value for our ancestors. Neanderthal Man in particular, whose cranial equipment was wired differently than the brains of modern humans, is sometimes depicted as an ESP-enabled loser in the evolutionary lottery. In Nobel Prize–winning author William Golding’s 1963 novel The Inheritors, a kindly race of telepathic Neanderthals is driven to extinction by a group of non-psychic Cro-Magnons who, deprived of a genetic\n\nOne • A Brief History of the Paranormal in Fact and Fiction\n\n21\n\nESP advantage, are forced to develop language and technology to compensate. A similar theme was explored more recently in John Darnton’s 1997 novel Neanderthal, in which two relict groups of Neanderthals are discovered in a remote area of the former Soviet Union, one of which possesses telepathic abilities: here too the more aggressive, non-telepathic tribe dominates the gentler, telepathic group. In science ﬁction terms, a telepathic hive mind also carries the potential danger of the surrender of one’s individuality to a collective consciousness. Science ﬁction writers exploited some of the more sensational implications of psi in a manner similar to that adopted by Hollywood decades later, albeit in a much more thoughtful fashion. Their works explored the conﬂict between “normal” humans and ESP-equipped Übermensch, and the consequences of this alienation. The protagonists of these paranormal fables are typically alien or mutant psychic individuals who are brought into conﬂict with the majority population of normals.\n\nOdd John British SF writer Olaf Stapledon’s 1935 novel Odd John is arguably the ﬁrst serious treatment of the psi theme in science ﬁction literature. The title character, John, is a mutant superman who is gifted not only with a superior intellect but with telepathy and other powers of mind. Presented as a story related by a semi-anonymous human narrator, the narrative begins in England, where the precocious John slowly matures into a child prodigy. Upon reaching adulthood and undergoing a series of intense, self-imposed trials, Odd John sets out on a quest to ﬁnd other oddities like himself. He is aided in this task by his telepathic powers, which enable him to mind meld with other “supernormals” around the world. John is driven by a vision of creating a sanctuary where he and his ilk can form a society entirely free from the inﬂuence of homo sapiens. Toward this end, he invents a saucer-shaped, atomic-powered seagoing yacht equipped with a high-tech airplane and goes in search of other members of the homo superior species. Guided by his telepathy, Odd John manages to locate a number of his fellow mutants in various exotic places around the globe, and he transports them to a remote, uncharted island in the South Seas. The mutants then use their psychic powers to induce the entire indigenous population of the island to commit suicide in an act of inter-species ethnic cleansing. John and his followers establish the ﬁrst homo superior colony in Earth’s history and (if allowed to breed) will represent the next evolutionary step beyond ordinary humankind. The supernormal members of the Colony establish a utopian collective and engage in various spiritual, artistic, scientiﬁc and psychic pursuits. They frolic naked in their tropical Eden, living in telepathic union, where their paranormal abilities are enhanced to include a limited form of psychokinesis and the\n\n22\n\nCinema of the Psychic Realm\n\nhypno-telepathic control over human minds. Strangely, these assembled specimens of homo superior are described as freakish-looking, even deformed in appearance, and they mature much more slowly than normal humans do, giving them a sort of juvenile quality. Unfortunately there’s trouble brewing in paradise when a British naval vessel discovers the Colony, and despite the best efforts of the mutants to psychically alter the memories and perceptions of the sailors, their existence becomes known and homo sapiens come to realize that they cannot tolerate a competitor. After several attacks by human shore parties, John and his followers opt to destroy the island in a nuclear conﬂagration rather than be killed or enslaved by an inferior species. In Odd John, Stapledon links psi abilities with an assortment of grotesque, inhuman beings rather than with everyday people. Those who possess ESP powers are mutants, different, odd; in fact, they constitute an entirely different species. The “supernormals,” obsessed with surviving in a world dominated by an inferior race, are amoral in their dealings with homo sapiens. As a child John murders a policeman, and in adulthood he kills two sailors in order to protect the secret of the Colony. Under his leadership, the mutants use their mind control powers to perpetrate mass genocide upon the hapless humans on the island, treating them like so many vermin to be exterminated on a piece of coveted real estate. Stapledon loads the novel with John’s wry observations about the foibles and limitations of humankind while presenting enhanced intellect and psychic abilities as advanced evolutionary attributes of homo superior. Their telepathic abilities enable them to construct a truly democratic, utopian society of linked superminds.\n\nSlan Another early SF novel that featured a telepathic race of superbeings was A.E. van Vogt’s Slan (1946). Set hundreds of years in the future, the novel follows the exploits of young Jommy Cross, who is a slan, a mutant with physical and mental abilities that are superior to those of homo sapiens. True slans possess two hearts and have a head endowed with a mass of tendrils that enable telepathy in place of hair. The word slan is based on a contraction of the name of their discoverer and patron Samuel Lann, who ﬁrst recognized them as a distinct race and groomed them to dominate humankind. After years of warfare between man and slan, the slans were decisively defeated and went underground, their remnants hunted down and killed by humans. To complicate matters further, a second mutation has taken place producing a race of “tendrilless” slans who look completely human but lack the telepathic abilities of true slans. These tendrilless mutants have covertly inﬁltrated human society, and are also actively stalking their tendrilled brethren. After Jommy’s mother and father are brutally killed by humans, the young\n\nOne • A Brief History of the Paranormal in Fact and Fiction\n\n23\n\nmutant goes on a quest to ﬁnd other true slans and to develop high-tech inventions devised by his father. Going underground among the humans, Jommy works on perfecting his father’s technology while being hunted by both humans and tendrilless slans. His superior offensive and defensive weapons and his telepathic powers enable him to stay one step ahead of both races. In spite of being subjected to blasts of pure mental hatred from the minds surrounding him, Jommy consistently shows compassion toward his enemies. The freewheeling pulp ﬁction plot careens through futuristic cities on Earth and Mars as Jommy seeks his elusive slan birthright and ﬁnally brings reconciliation to the three races. Written during the “golden age” of magazine science ﬁction, the basic narrative of Slan seems derived from plot elements of Odd John. Again there is a gifted young genius/telepath who scours the globe in search of other members of his hidden mutant race. However, unlike the amoral, aristocratic John, Jommy’s telepathy serves to make him more compassionate and makes it possible for him to gain perspective on non-slan minds from the inside. This empathic sensitivity extends to those who hate him and wish him harm. Once more psychic powers are portrayed as being possessed not by humans but by a race of superhuman mutants. The slans have even evolved specialized anatomy for this purpose. There is also a persistent warlike enmity between mankind and a telepathic race. The ﬁnal triumph of the true slans over the tendrilless slans seems to suggest that telepathy has a higher evolutionary survival value than enhanced intelligence.\n\nMore Than Human In Theodore Sturgeon’s novel More Than Human (1953), an itinerant halfwit with telepathic abilities named Lone hooks up with a number of children who also possess psychic powers: Janie can telekinetically move objects with her mind; the twins, Bonnie and Beanie, are able to teleport themselves through space; Gerry is another telepath who can hypnotically inﬂuence people’s minds; while Baby is superintelligent but infantile. These cast-offs from society eke out a feral existence in an isolated backwoods area, living on the fringes of our society where they develop a special kinship and begin to function as a team by using their special abilities to help the group survive. In their totality this group of freaks begins to meld into something resembling a complete being, a “gestalt organism” whose potential as a whole exceeds that of its individual parts. This psychic unity is enabled through a psi process called “bleshing” (a combination of the words blending and meshing), which allows the members to function as a greater whole. It soon becomes obvious that homo gestalt, as this unitary being is referred to, is on a collision course with homo sapiens. Wishing only to develop their psychic abilities in solitude,\n\n24\n\nCinema of the Psychic Realm\n\nthe individual members of the gestalt must use their psi powers to the fullest to keep their existence a secret from humankind. While homo gestalt may represent the next step in human evolution, it is unrestrained by human morality. Its members commit murder and other crimes in their struggle to survive, but in the end strive to develop an ethos that will guide the actions of the new species. Sturgeon exhibits some familiarity with concepts found in ESP research, although bodily teleportation and hyperintelligence are not truly within the realm of psi. The notion of a group of psychic geeks who represent the next step in the evolution of the human race living in isolation seems to have been lifted from Odd John. Although the novel contains evocative descriptions of the subjective experience of telepathy, the concept of “bleshing” is not developed fully, and seems confusing because not all of the members of the gestalt group are telepathic. Once again, individuals possessing psychic powers are depicted as grotesque misﬁts living on the margins of human society. In fact, it is their psi abilities that make them different and serve to marginalize them, an idea that would later be taken up in ESP-oriented movie thrillers such as Scanners, The Fury and Firestarter. No explanation is given as to why this motley crew are gifted with psychic abilities, although the author implies that psi occurs naturally during childhood and gradually fades away as we get older.\n\nThe Demolished Man The most acclaimed SF novel on the psychic theme from science ﬁction’s “golden age” is Alfred Bester’s The Demolished Man (1953), which won the very ﬁrst Hugo Award for a novel (sci-ﬁ’s equivalent of an Oscar). Hundreds of years in the future when telepathy has become an applied science, a minority of the human population who possess telepathic abilities are organized into an elite corps of “Espers.” Derided as “peepers” by the general public, the telepaths are nonetheless tolerated and grudgingly appreciated for their unique and valuable abilities. Members of the Espers Guild pervade all professions in human society, commercial and administrative, including the police. Mind-reading Esper cops have all but eliminated the simple art of murder. Super-rich industrialist Ben Reich thinks otherwise. He plans to murder a commercial rival to secure a business advantage and beat the rap by defeating the Esper’s mental probes. In order to accomplish this, Reich makes use of an insipid pop song that centers on the meaningless phrase, “tenser, said the tensor,” which will ﬂummox all attempts to meld with his mind. Going on the lam after committing the homicide, Reich successfully uses the rhyme to deﬂect Esper telepathy, and uses his vast resources to stay one step ahead of the law. He is pursued by the peeper Prefect of Police Lincoln Powell, and despite the Esper’s telepathic edge, Reich’s wits and money frustrate the police as they\n\nOne • A Brief History of the Paranormal in Fact and Fiction\n\n25\n\nrelentlessly pursue him around the Solar System. Reich is eventually brought to justice only when the Espers as a group employ mass telepathy to alter his subjective reality and cause him to be “demolished” in an ESP-induced mental breakdown. Unlike the other science ﬁction treatments of psi, The Demolished Man departs from portraying psychic individuals as mutants and freaks secretly living apart from humankind. Bester’s Espers are fully integrated into the human world, which makes full commercial use of their abilities; but they remain a breed apart, living in a closed, elite society where their telepathic exchanges and communications are not accessible or comprehensible to the vast majority of the population. In addition, Espers are only allowed to marry and breed with others of their kind. The novel suggests that the development of natural psi talents into a commercial science of psionics would have positive beneﬁts for all mankind, including the eradication of serious crimes. Although psi is shown in a positive light, the reader’s sympathies are frequently with Reich as he strives to outwit the Esper’s mental intrusions and avoid his seemingly inevitable demolition.\n\nESP Real and Unreal These four science ﬁction novels represent the most seminal and highly regarded treatments of the psi theme during this early period of literary science ﬁction. In most of them, ESP abilities are associated with grotesque, quasihuman mutants, members of homo superior, homo gestalt or the snake-headed slan race. Only in The Demolished Man is psi talent presented as a naturallyoccurring attribute in otherwise normal humans. All of the novels portray ESP as a potent force with the potential to enrich humankind and even propel homo sapiens to the next evolutionary level. But at the same time they all hint at a darker side to psi and posit telepaths who have the power to probe and manipulate human minds at will. The emphasis on telepathy over other forms of ESP reﬂects the gadget-oriented emphasis of this early phase of “hard” science ﬁction, in which the idea of thought exchange was viewed as a type of “mental radio” existing in the physical realm of electromagnetic phenomena. Fortunately or unfortunately, the sci-ﬁ notion of psionics, or the large-scale practical application of psi in society at large, has never been realized. While the scientists assembled their stat tables and the science ﬁction writers spun their tales of the paranormal, psi remained in the limbo of fringe scientiﬁc publications and sci-ﬁ pulp magazines. But there was another domain where the paranormal not only existed, but even ﬂourished: the cinema. The mysterious shadow world of visions, mind-reading and prophecy would ﬁnd its most popular expression in the medium of ﬁlm.\n\n• TWO •\n\nEarly Paranormal Films The subject of psychic phenomena did not immediately lend itself to cinematic treatment. Early ﬁlms dealing with psi were typically clouded over by association with the supernatural realm. These ﬁlms emerged during the period of Expressionist cinema in Germany between the two world wars, when the Teutonic psyche was haunted by the spectres and shadows of the Great War, when all manner of ghosts, devils, golems, grim reapers and vampires inhabited darkened movie theaters. Films of this period tend to emphasize a single psychic ability above any others, namely the use of hypnotic telepathy to control the minds of groups or individuals. In Robert Weine’s The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919), for instance, the evil hypnotist Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) exerts his mind control powers over Cesare (Conrad Veidt), who is reduced to a somnambulistic state wherein he lies asleep in a cofﬁn until roused to do the murderous bidding of the monstrous doctor. The hypnotized Cesare recalls the psychic “somnambules” who were so prominent in the Mesmerist movement of the late 18th Century. With its highly stylized Expressionist sets, which represented the interior worlds of madness and dreams, Caligari was an international sensation that launched the German Expressionist cinema movement and is today considered a classic of the silent era. Nosferatu (1922), an unauthorized screen adaptation of Bram Stoker’s novel Dracula lensed by the esteemed director F.W. Murnau, featured Max Schreck as the gnome-like “Count Orloc.” Like the many vampires who would follow him, the Count possessed hypno-telepathic abilities that enable him to impose his will on his victims from a distance. Nosferatu, like Caligari, was critically well-received at the time, but lawsuits from the Stoker estate prevented the ﬁlm from being widely shown outside Germany for many years. The great Austrian director Fritz Lang created the ﬁrst truly psychic ﬁlm character in Dr. Mabuse, an arch-villain who was the brainchild of novelist Norbert Jacques. In Lang’s four-hour silent epic Dr. Mabuse, the Gambler (1922), the evil Mabuse (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) uses his hypnotic powers to manipulate the minds of those around him in a bid to control the world’s economy. In one 26\n\nTwo • Early Paranormal Films\n\n27\n\nMesmerist Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss, left) displays his somnambulistic slave, Cesare (Conrad Veidt), to Lil Dagover in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919).\n\nscene Mabuse creates an elaborate, cinema-like illusion of a procession of horses that is witnessed by the entire audience at a theater, while at the same time giving a policeman a telepathic command to shoot himself. Brought to justice at the end of the ﬁlm, the criminal genius returned in Lang’s sound-era sequel, The Testament of Dr. Mabuse (1933), in which Mabuse (Klein-Rogge) again uses his preternatural abilities in a bid to conquer the world. Unlike Caligari and Nosferatu, which were both set in earlier historical periods, the two Mabuse ﬁlms take place in contemporaneous Germany and eschew the trappings of the supernatural in favor of real-world science ﬁction. Due to a materialistic mindset that was skeptical of all “supernatural” subjects, American ﬁlm audiences were not partial to psychic themes during Hollywood’s silent era, and few ﬁlms dealing with this topic were produced at this time. This would change in the early-talkie period, when the supernatural horror ﬁlm came to America with the twin Universal Studios hits Dracula and Frankenstein in 1931. In particular, Bela Lugosi in Dracula ably exhibited the vampire’s powers of hypnotic telepathy that enabled him to control his victims from a distance.\n\n28\n\nCinema of the Psychic Realm\n\nEarly Psi Films In the wake of the Universal monster hits, other studios scrambled to cash in on the horror craze. One early effort was Warner Brothers’ Svengali (1931), featuring the great John Barrymore in the title role. Based on George du Maurier’s 1894 novel Trilby, the ﬁlm tells the story of the hypnotist and musical impressario Svengali, who possesses the ability to mesmerize and control women. In an early scene one of Svengali’s students and romantic conquests, the talentless Madame Honori (Carmel Myers), announces that she has left her husband for him and is now penniless, whereupon Svengali uses his hypnotic powers to compel her to commit suicide. Soon afterward he meets the beautiful young model Trilby (Marian Marsh) and becomes instantly infatuated with her. Trilby, however, is in love with a young artist named Billee (Bramwell Fletcher). One day while Svengali is treating Trilby for a headache, he uses his powers to place The “Great Proﬁle” John Barrymore as the telepathic hypnotist in Svengali her in a hypnotic trance. “You shall see nothing … hear nothing … dream (1931). nothing … but Svengali,” he drones, as his eyes glow with an unholy light. Once she is under his control, he erases her memory of Billee, fakes her suicide and transports her away from Paris under cover of night. Svengali then transforms her into an operatic diva of immense talent, but in spite of their artistic relationship his love for her remains unrequited. The couple embark on a tour of Europe, with the newly-minted singing sensation Trilby now billed as “Madame Svengali.” After entertaining the crowned heads of Europe on an extended tour, Svengali and Trilby return to Paris for a much-heralded concert; but when Trilby recognizes Billee in the crowd, her love for him makes her personality re-assert itself. As Svengali’s mental control of the diva begins to wane, Trilby starts to lose her singing talent and must ultimately choose between her love and her art. The Great Proﬁle plays the role of the malevolent maestro with considerable verve, sporting a Rasputin-like appearance complete with a baroque beard, long hair and ﬂowing operatic robes. In one semi-comic scene, he attempts to\n\nTwo • Early Paranormal Films\n\n29\n\nforce Trilby into his bed with hypnotism, but when she responds to him, he abruptly dismisses her, saying, “But it is only Svengali, talking to himself again.” Another sequence conveys Svengali’s hypno-telepathic powers in a distinctly cinematic fashion. It begins with a closeup of Barrymore’s magnetic eyes as the camera slowly pulls backward, through a window and out into the street, then travels over the rooftops of Paris, ﬁnally penetrating Trilby’s bedroom. This type of moving camera technique was rare in early sound-era ﬁlms that tended to employ static camera setups. Director Archie Mayo deserves kudos for working with the notoriously difﬁcult Barrymore while serving up gobs of mysterioso visual atmosphere and deftly mixing comedy, horror and romance into a highly diverting whole. Svengali was the ﬁrst ﬁlm of the sound era to portray an individual with psychic powers. Although Barrymore’s histrionic portrayal paints psi in an occult light, there is no clearly supernatural element to the plot. The transformative potential of psi is suggested in Trilby’s psychically-induced metamorphosis from shallow model to musical genius under her master’s paranormal tutelage. Oddly, Svengali’s hypno-telepathic domination of women would ﬁnd a parallel in eerily similar psi experiments conducted in the Soviet Union in the 1960s. According to the 1970 book Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain, male telepathic senders would attempt to render young female students unconscious and hypnotize them, sometimes over long distances. Actor Claude Rains, who had his ﬁrst starring role in James Whale’s riotous screen version of H.G. Wells’ The Invisible Man (1934), travelled back across the pond to England to star in Maurice Elvey’s paranormal thriller The Clairvoyant (1935). Rains plays Maximus, a small-time music hall mentalist who has a modestly successful act with his wife and assistant, Rene (Fay Wray). The couple use an elaborate system of code words to simulate clairvoyance until Maximus begins to experience real psychic visions. Unfortunately his gift is only enabled when he is in the presence of newspaper heiress Christine Shaw (Jane Baxter), a situation that leads to complications in his marriage. His ﬁrst major premonition comes when he is travelling on a train with Rene, Christine and her newspaper mogul father Lord Southwood (Athole Stewart). After having a vision that the train will crash, Maximus pulls the emergency cord and stops the train, lessening the impact of the inevitable collision and saving their lives. When the event is widely reported in Lord Southwood’s newspapers, the clairvoyant becomes a media celebrity, signs a lucrative contact with the publishing magnate and lands a theatrical booking at the Palladium. Maximus goes on to predict a 100 to 1 winning horse in the Derby, but his next premonition gets him in big trouble. He predicts a massive cave-in in the nearby Humber Shaft, an enormous mine being excavated by hundreds of workers, and even goes to the mine in person to beg the miners to discontinue their work. The miners reject his pleas, and when the cave-in occurs as predicted, Maximus is ordered to stand trial for having caused the disaster in the\n\n30\n\nCinema of the Psychic Realm\n\nSvengali (John Barrymore) puts the hypnotic eye on his apprentice, Trilby (Marian Marsh), in Svengali (1931).\n\nmanner of a self-fulﬁlling prophecy. The court marshals strong evidence against him, and Maximus is only exonerated when he correctly predicts that a large number of the men are alive and have escaped through a side tunnel. In the happy ending, the rescued miners come marching into the courthouse and Maximus is persuaded to give up his gift along with his relationship with Christine. Ad copy for the ﬁlm proclaimed, “The Invisible Man makes the future visible,” in this modest Gaumont Studios production. In his ﬁrst visible starring role, Rains delivers a strong performance as the tortured psychic Maximus and is ably assisted by Fay Wray (who had only recently escaped from the grasp of King Kong) and a ﬁne British cast. Ably directed by Maurice Elvey, the ﬁlm recycles footage from Elvey’s sci-ﬁ production The Transatlantic Tunnel (1935) for the Humber Shaft cave-in sequences. The screenplay by Charles Bennett, who co-wrote the classic Hitchcock thriller The 39 Steps (1935), steers clear of the supernatural while exploring the mystery of psychic premonition, although the script provides no clues as to why Christine’s presence is necessary for Maximus’s psi powers to function. Maximus’s paranormal gift brings him equal measures of fame and grief, and in the end is rejected in favor of normalcy. The\n\nTwo • Early Paranormal Films\n\n31\n\nﬁlm also plays on the tendency of everyday people to blame the psychic messenger when bad things happen according to their predictions, and to brand their mysterious ESP abilities as demonic and therefore subject to righteous punishment. Historically, The Clairvoyant (also known under the alternate title The Evil Mind) represents the ﬁrst notable feature ﬁlm on the subject of psychic phenomena, and has afﬁnities with another early essay on precognition, John Farrow’s ﬁlm noir The Night Has a Thousand Eyes (1948). Like Svengali, Paramount’s Peter Ibbetson (1935) was based on a turn-ofthe-century novel by George du Maurier, and had previously been lensed during the silent period as Forever (1921). As the story opens, two children, Peter and Mary, are childhood sweethearts who develop the ability to “dream true”— to visit each other in their dreams. Separated in childhood, they are re-united as adults when Peter (Gary Cooper), now an architect, is hired to do a restoration job for the Duke of Towers (John Halliday). Mary (Ann Harding), who is now the Dutchess of Towers, is still carrying the ﬂame for Peter. Learning of his wife’s attraction, the jealous Duke pulls a gun on Ibbetson, who kills the nobleman in self-defense. Put on trial for murder, Peter is convicted of murdering the Duke and sentenced to life in prison. For the rest of their lives, Peter and Mary can only meet inside the mutual dream world they share. Director Henry Hathaway, best known for his action-oriented productions, is more restrained in his treatment of this sentimental, romantic material, but Peter Ibbetson’s uneasy blend of fantasy and costume romance did lukewarm business at the box ofﬁce. Even though the emphasis is on the romantic aspect of the story, what is really being described here is the psychic phenomenon known as dream telepathy, in which thoughts or experiences can be exchanged between two minds in a dreaming state. This phenomenon has been documented as occurring between psychotherapists and their patients in Elizabeth Lloyd Mayer’s book Extraordinary Knowing (2007) and has been extensively researched by ex-military remote viewer Dale Graff in Tracks in the Psychic Wilderness (1998).\n\nPsychics, Mediums and Cynics in Film Noir The term ﬁlm noir was coined in France but refers to a body of American crime thrillers produced roughly between 1942 and 1953 that were characterized by a world-weary fatalism, a profound social cynicism and a stylish eroticism. Film noir heroes, typically hard-boiled private eyes like Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe, exist in a shadow world where they confront sadistic hoods, deadly femmes fatales, big-time gangsters, psychotic criminals and other perverse characters caught in a web of fear, violence and intrigue. Some of the inhabitants of this dark and sinister milieu are bogus mediums and psychics who use their illusory paranormal powers to further their criminal schemes.\n\n32\n\nCinema of the Psychic Realm\n\nBy the early 1940s, the noir metropolis of Los Angeles in particular had become home to a sizable assortment of kooks, quacks and weirdos who made their way into mystery ﬁction and Hollywood ﬁlms noir. In Raymond Chandler’s mystery novel Farewell, My Lovely (1940), Chandler’s private detective Philip Marlowe is menaced by a sinister phony psychic named Jules Amthor. The author acidly describes the “Psychic Consultant” thus: “Give him enough time and pay him enough money and he’ll cure anything from a jaded husband to a grasshopper plague. He would be an expert in frustrated love affairs, women who slept alone and didn’t like it, wandering boys and girls who didn’t write home, sell the property now or hold it for another year, will this part hurt me with my public or make me seem more versatile?” Chandler further notes that most of Amthor’s clientele consists of women, “fat women that panted and thin women that burned, old women that dreamed and young women that thought they might have Electra complexes, women of all sizes, shapes and ages, but with one thing in common — money.”1 In Edward Dmytryk’s 1944 screen adaptation entitled Murder, My Sweet, Marlowe (Dick Powell) squares off against Amthor (Otto Kruger), who is using information gleaned from his rich lady clients to perpetrate a series of jewel heists. In one scene, Marlowe gets roughed up by the jewel thieves inside the psychic’s elegant apartment. Later Amthor turns up dead when he is doublecrossed by one of his fellow criminals. Slick, dapper and sinister, Amthor personiﬁes the archetype of the phony psychic within the cynical, hard-boiled universe of ﬁlm noir. One of the darkest and most acclaimed of the classic ﬁlms noir also revolves around the character of a phony psychic. Edmund Goulding’s Nightmare Alley (1947) cast handsome leading man Tyrone Power against type as Stanton Carlisle, a small-time carnival hustler who obtains the secret of a fake mentalist act from Zeena (Joan Blondell), one of the other carnies. The mind-reading trick involves the use of an elaborate system of code words to emulate clairvoyance. He takes the act on the road with his wife Molly (Colleen Gray), billing himself as “The Great Stanton,” and as their telepathy act becomes a hit they are booked into larger and larger venues. They soon get a high-class gig at an upscale nightclub in Chicago, where the Great Stanton wows the urban sophisticates with his carny fakery masquerading as ESP. Stanton has ambitions that go beyond show business, however. He takes up with unscrupulous psychologist Dr. Lilith Ritter (Helen Walker), with whom he hatches a scheme to defraud wealthy Chicagoans. Using information taken from the conﬁdential ﬁles of Dr. Ritter’s patients, he makes it appear that he has obtained intimate knowledge of their personal lives via clairvoyance or telepathy. With his victims in awe of his apparently paranormal powers, Stanton bilks them out of a fortune while assuming a false piety that makes them believe he is a godly man. When he enlists Molly to impersonate the ghost of an industrialist’s dead sweetheart, she rebels and deliberately spoils the illusion.\n\nTwo • Early Paranormal Films\n\n33\n\nBogus psychic “The Great Stanton” (Tyrone Power, center) wows Chicago society with his phony ESP in Nightmare Alley (1947).\n\nDiscredited by this debacle and cheated out of his money by the wily Lilith, Stanton separates from his wife and descends into the carny life once more. He hits rock bottom when he becomes a carnival “geek,” a grisly attraction who bites the heads off live chickens, before he is ﬁnally redeemed by his wife’s love. This off beat melodrama is critically viewed today as one of the most unusual works in all of ﬁlm noir. Nightmare Alley’s blend of carny exploitation, white-collar criminality, obsession, degradation and psychic chicanery is perfectly realized by director Goulding and cinematographer Lee Garmes. Tyrone Power, in the most far-out role of his career, carries the ﬁlm as the sociopathic Stanton and delivers a powerful portrayal of one man’s descent into a private hell. The screenplay, adapted by Jules Furthman from a novel by William Lindsay Gresham, exposes the seamy world of psychic charlatanism with unblinking candor and explores the gullibilities that enable bogus mentalists to manipulate their victims. This cynical view of psi, emerging through the jaded prism of ﬁlm noir, offers a compelling presentation of the skeptical position regarding ESP. The debunkers believe that all psychic functioning is a fraud perpetrated on gullible believers by clever fakers, and Nightmare Alley illustrates people’s willingness to believe in fortune telling. In one carny spiel, repeated twice in the ﬁlm, the\n\n34\n\nCinema of the Psychic Realm\n\nseer supposedly has a vision of a little boy running through a ﬁeld with a dog at his side. Most shills fall for this psychic con job, but the trick is that every boy has a dog and the situation is common in almost every lad’s childhood. Stanton’s bogus clairvoyance convinces even wealthy, educated people by manipulating their will to believe in the preternatural. Ironically, Zeena is given to fortune-telling with a deck of arcane Tarot cards, and correctly predicts both her husband’s death and Stanton’s eventual downfall. Another noir that explored the world of phony occultism was The Amazing Mr. X (1948). Rich widow Christine Faber (Lynn Bari), who lives in a beautiful mansion overlooking the Paciﬁc, is haunted by ghostly visions and by the voice of her recently deceased husband calling to her from the sea. With her sanity on the line, she meets a mysterious man named Alexis (Turhan Bey) who claims to have psychic powers and offers to put her in touch with her dead spouse. Alexis seems to know intimate details about Christine’s personal life, which bolsters her belief in his ESP abilities. Her new ﬁancé, Martin (Richard Carlson), and her sister (Cathy O’Donnell) are appalled as she falls under the sway of the suave psychic. Christine visits Alexis in his spooky digs, which are adorned with weird statuary, a crystal ball and a trained raven. The audience is shown the elaborate mechanical devices that Alexis uses to simulate his paranormal powers, including one-way mirrors, secret chambers, sliding doors and a turban containing a radio headset. It soon becomes evident that the psychic is involved in a plot to defraud Christine’s estate, and that reports of her husband’s death have been greatly exaggerated. Directed by Bernard Vorhaus from a screenplay by Crane Wilbur, The Amazing Mr. X is enlivened by the camera work of ace noir cinematographer John Alton, who stylishly evokes a mysterioso paranormal world of light and shadow. Like Murder, My Sweet and Nightmare Alley, the ﬁlm exposes the machinations of bogus “psychic consultants” who cynically manipulate wealthy women with grand larceny in mind. Stolen photographs are used to simulate the faces of deceased loved ones in the séance room, while sophisticated devices like a concealed TV camera and a radio-equipped turban enable the illusion of the psychic’s omniscience. Alexis describes the appeal of his vocation as “feeding people’s desire to escape the present,” and The Amazing Mr. X goes out of its way to examine the elaborate mechanisms of fakery, both psychological and technological, that are used to manipulate gullible believers. While most ﬁlms noir of the period portrayed psychics as criminal frauds, there was one case of genuine ESP among them. John Farrow’s The Night Has a Thousand Eyes (1948), adapted from a haunting novel by Cornell Woolrich, stars noir icon Edward G. Robinson as John Triton, a carnival mentalist who discovers he has genuine precognitive and clairvoyant powers. While performing his act one night, he tells a woman that her house is on ﬁre and her son is in danger, which proves to be the case. In the weeks that follow Triton makes\n\nTwo • Early Paranormal Films\n\n35\n\nseveral more predictions that come true, but they all involve death and destruction. The reluctant prophet becomes consumed with guilt by the implications of his psychic visions, and laments, “I had a crazy feeling I was making the things come true.” One tragic prediction involves his former sweetheart, Jenny (Virginia Bruce), who he has foretold will die in childbirth, and when this comes to pass Triton is crushed and goes into seclusion. Years later, Triton moves to Los Angeles to be near Jenny’s daughter Jean (Gail Russell), whose father is the rich industrialist Whitney Courtland (Jerome Cowan). Courtland becomes apprised of Triton’s psychic prowess, and uses the seer to make money at the racetrack and on the stock market; however the prophet’s fateful visions return as he successfully predicts Courtland’s death in a plane crash. Triton then has an even more disturbing vision, that of Jean lying dead at the feet of a lion, but at this point Jean’s ﬁancé Elliott (John Lund) suspects foul play and calls the police. Triton is arrested and the psychic goingson are investigated by Lt. Shawn (William Demarest), but the seer convinces the detective of his powers by correctly predicting the suicide of a prisoner. Released from custody, Triton has a premonition of his own death, and races to save Jean by taking a bullet meant for her ﬁred by one of her father’s criminal associates. Trading fates with Jean, Triton expires at the feet of a stone lion, under the thousand eyes of the fateful stars. Departing from the usual noir formula of depicting psychics as slick, manipulative grifters pretending to have psi abilities, The Night Has a Thousand Eyes ponders the melancholy destiny of an individual who possesses true paranormal gifts. Farrow’s ﬁlm is infused with a mood of brooding gloom and mystery that are associated with Triton’s eerie abilities, as the psychic believes that his visions are somehow linked to his very existence. While Triton is not himself a criminal, his real ESP powers are even darker, and are associated with supernatural dread, night and fate. The ﬁlm has afﬁnities with The Clairvoyant (1935) and The Medusa Touch (1978) in its depiction of a psychic prophet tormented by the perverse gift of foreknowledge of disastrous events, and is unusual in its presentation of the uncanny within the hard-boiled realism of the ﬁlm noir universe.\n\nCrime, Skepticism and ESP All of these early ﬁlms on the subject of ESP involve a connection between psi and crime in some fashion. Even when psychics are blameless of any criminality, as in The Clairvoyant, Peter Ibbetson and The Night Has a Thousand Eyes, they are indicted by society at large because of the strangeness and “otherness” of their paranormal powers, and by the odd belief that they are somehow responsible for the dire events that follow in the wake of their visions. An association between psychics and criminality was established during the period\n\n36\n\nCinema of the Psychic Realm\n\nof classic ﬁlm noir in Farewell, My Lovely, Nightmare Alley and The Amazing Mr. X, and this connection would re-establish itself in later psi-oriented crime thrillers such as Séance on a Wet Afternoon (1964), Man on a Swing (1974) and Family Plot (1976). The gritty realism of noir provided a context for the skeptical view of the paranormal. American “I’m-from-Missouri” hard-headedness had no room for spiritualists, mentalists or mediums. The psychic racket was portrayed as preying upon human gullibility and religiosity, with most of the victims of Jules Amthor, The Amazing Mr. X, and Stanton Carlisle being of the supposedly more irrational female gender. There are also associations between ESP and religious transgression, especially in Nightmare Alley, where a psychic swindler invokes God in order to further his criminal schemes, and in The Night Has a Thousand Eyes, in which the seer is tormented, Job-like, for the sin of possessing the second sight. Both ultra-rational skepticism and religious bias would continue to limit the appeal of psi-themed movie fare in years to come.\n\n• THREE •\n\nESP in Drama, Comedy and Children’s Films While the majority of movies on paranormal themes are consigned to the science ﬁction, fantasy and horror genres, there are a number of ﬁlms that are primarily dramatic in focus. These ﬁlms concentrate on emotional interactions between the characters, and while ESP is an important element in the narrative, it is not the soul of the plot. This reﬂects the experience of the paranormal in people’s everyday lives, when it may emerge spontaneously during a life crisis situation. There are many anecdotal accounts of spontaneous ESP manifesting itself in ordinary, non-psychic individuals on a single-event basis: the mother who knows that her son has been killed on the battleﬁeld before the letter arrives from the war department; the time you thought about someone you hadn’t heard from in a while just before the phone rang with a call from that person; the identical twins who can read each other’s minds at a great distance. These ﬁlms explore the dramatic implications of life inside a psychic universe without reverting to melodrama. An early example is The Rocking Horse Winner (1949), a British ﬁlm directed by Anthony Pelissier and adapted from a short story of the same name by D.H. Lawrence. The narrative centers around the Grahame family, upperclass Londoners who have fallen on hard ﬁnancial times. Their economic woes are solely the result of the family’s proﬂigate lifestyle. Father Richard Grahame (Hugh Sinclair) persistently loses money at the track, while mother Heather (Valerie Hobson) continues to squander the family’s remaining cash on expensive clothes, jewelry and other luxuries they can’t afford. Things get paranormal when their adolescent son, Paul (John Howard Davies), discovers he can predict winners at the racetrack while riding on his wooden rocking horse. Colluding with servant Bassett (John Mills) and his uncle Oscar (Ronald Squire), Paul begins to turn his hunches into hard cash at the track, secretly bringing in money to support his mother and father in the style to which they have become accustomed. But Paul’s precognitive powers have their price, and picking the winners to fund his parent’s compulsive materi37\n\n38\n\nCinema of the Psychic Realm\n\nalism begins to diminish the boy’s life force, with ultimately tragic consequences. Director Pelissier imbues Lawrence’s parable of British mores and materialism with an otherworldly gloss, as homey scenes of upper-class English domestic life are contrasted with the sequences in which Paul rides his haunted hobby-horse, where skewed camera angles and expressionistic lighting setups are employed to give the proceedings an atmosphere of the occult. POV shots of Paul’s subjective vision as he rocks himself into a precognitive altered state are especially jarring. Although the child’s prophetic powers are never explained, the dark-eyed rocking horse becomes a talisman of dread and symbolic of the dangerous ESP abilities that ultimately consume Paul. Like many later ﬁlms, The Rocking Horse Winner correlates paranormal functioning with childhood or adolescence. A ﬁne cast, solid direction and classy source material distinguish this production. Lawrence’s story was remade as a short ﬁlm by Michael Almereyda in 1997 with the locale moved to Southern California. Another British paranormal drama is Jerzy Skolimowski’s off beat feature The Shout (1979). Alan Bates stars as the enigmatic Charles Crossley, a man who believes he possesses preternatural shamanic powers. As the ﬁlm opens, Crossley is a patient in a mental hospital who relates the actions leading to his commitment in a ﬂashback — or is it a hallucination? The plot unfolds against the bleak backdrop of a small seaside village in North Devon, England, where Anthony (John Hurt) lives an idyllic existence with his wife Rachel (Susannah York). Anthony is an electronic musician who uses sophisticated equipment to record exotic sounds such as the ampliﬁed buzzing of a ﬂy or the magniﬁed sound of stroking a dog’s fur. Enter the mysterious Crossley, who forces his way into the lives of the couple using his charismatic powers and takes up residence in their cottage. Crossley explains to Anthony that he has lived among the aborigines of the Australian Outback for eighteen years in complete isolation from white society. During this time he claims to have learned a technique called the “terror shout,” a cry that will kill all who hear it, from an aboriginal sorcerer. When Anthony expresses skepticism, Crossley arranges a demonstration of his power. He advises Anthony to stop his ears with wax in order to blunt the full power of the terror shout as the two of them hike to a remote spot out on the dunes. Believing them to be alone, Crossley unleashes the shout, which shocks Anthony into unconsciousness while inadvertently killing a nearby shepherd and his sheep. Now convinced of Crossley’s paranormal powers, Anthony is fearful of asserting himself against the interloper, even when Crossley seduces Rachel. For his part Anthony has been seduced by the shout, and wishes to capture the sound the way he samples the noises of nature with his electronic gear. Pushed to the breaking point, Anthony ﬁghts back by ﬁnding a way to use Crossley’s aboriginal powers against him, which presumably leads to his commitment to\n\nThree • ESP in Drama, Comedy and Children’s Films\n\n39\n\nthe mental institution. The story then builds to an enigmatic climax as the nuthouse’s lunatics go crazy during a sudden thunderstorm and the power of Crossley’s shout is unleashed once more. This lurid material could have been the basis for a melodrama or horror movie, but Skolimowski’s glacial pacing, naturalistic setting and emphasis on the interactions of a small number of characters keep The Shout entirely within the realm of the dramatic ﬁlm. Derived from a story by mytho-poetic writer Robert Graves, the screenplay by Skolimowski and Michael Austin is crafted into the story of a love triangle between a group of isolated people set against a compelling backdrop of madness and shamanic mystery. In open-ended fashion, the issue of whether Crossley is insane or possesses psychic powers is never fully settled. The bleak North Devon landscape of tufted sand dunes and ragged seashore is employed to build the ﬁlm’s mood of sterility and loneliness. Acclaimed British thesps Bates, Hurt and York turn in sincere, intense performances in this charac"
