        "text": "Doomwatch was a British science fiction television programme produced by the BBC, which ran on BBC1 between 1970 and 1972. The series was set in the then present day, and dealt with a scientific government agency responsible for investigating and combating various ecological and technological dangers.\n\nThe series was followed by a 1972 film adaptation produced by Tigon British Film Productions, and a revival TV film was broadcast on Channel 5 in 1999.\n\nReview:\n\nCreated by Kit Pedler – a real life scientist and early environmental campaigner – and Gerry Davis (the pair having met while working on Doctor Who, for which they created the Cybermen), Doomwatch is the story of the titular government division the Department for the Observation and Measurement of Scientific Work, created up to monitor threats to humanity caused by dodgy or simply over-ambitious scientific work (the series is a classic example of anti-science paranoia, where every new development is bound to cause death and destruction).\n\nWhile Doomwatch was intended by politicians (usually represented by John Barron, as inadvertently hilarious here as he was in The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin) as a sop to public green concerns and not designed to have real power, under the control of Dr. Spencer Quist (John Paul), it takes its duties very seriously indeed, and throughout the three series, tackles assorted threats – from the small scale to the apocalyptic – while often battling with government bureaucrats who are often keen to cover up wrongdoing, placate voters and support their big business chums.\n\nWorking for Quist are serious minded new recruit Toby Wren (Robert Powell – also in Asylum; Harlequin) – who is dramatically killed off at the end of series one – and loud-shirted ladies man Dr. John Ridge (Simon Oates), while in the second series (in response to viewer complaints that the women in the show were little more than bimbo secretaries) the team were joined by a couple of female scientists, Dr. Anne Tarrant (Elizabeth Weaver) and Dr. Fay Chantry (Jean Trend).\n\nThere are two problems with Doomwatch when seen today, and to be fair to the show, neither are really its fault. Firstly, most of the show master tapes have been wiped, as per BBC policy on anything that wasn’t sport. Five episodes of series one and nine out of twelve episodes of series three remain lost – and we only have series two because tapes were found in Canada. Most annoyingly, the pivotal episode in which Wren is killed off is missing, though the important scene luckily survives as the introduction to series two. The loss of these episodes makes it hard to judge how the series developed in the third series and fails to explain the sudden absence of some characters.\n\nThe other problem with Doomwatch is more damaging, however. This is a show that was very much of its time in terms of production style, and as such it has dated very badly. We are used, of course, to the idea that 1970s BBC shows would be shot in a disconcerting mix of film (for exteriors) and videotape (for studio sets), the latter giving everything a horribly cheap feel and the jumping from one to the other an aesthetic annoyance. It seems especially irritating in this series though, for some reason.\n\nWhat’s more, the style at the time was to shoot ‘as live’, meaning that if anyone fumbled their lines, they just kept going. And it happens a lot here. John Paul is especially bad, but he can be forgiven when you consider the sheer levels of gobbledegook he had to remember in dialogue scenes that go on forever. And that’s the most irritating aspect of the show now, more than the fumbling dialogue of the mismatched shooting formats – it’s very, very slow.\n\nI’m not one for demanding everything movies at lightning speed – in fact, it’s one of the things that irks me about modern cinema. But here, a large chunk of the running time of each episode seems to consist of Quist in his office ranting interminably (Paul seemed determined to get through his dialogue as quickly as possible, maybe before he started to forget more of it). Quist is probably one of the most unappealing characters ever to head a TV show – and this doesn’t seem especially deliberate. But when you start feeling sympathy for the government lackeys that he is barking at, you know the character needs more work.\n\nIt’s a shame, because the series is full of interesting ideas that remain relevant today – you almost want these to be remade with better production values and acting, because most would still work now. Sure, the much-shown scene of actors hopping around with stuffed rats attached to their legs in Tomorrow, The Rat are hilarious – but the story itself is suitably chilling. And that’s often the case here – the stories deserve better than the show can provide.\n\nInterestingly, one of the few episodes from series three to survive is the unbroadcast Sex and Violence, where Doomwatch is brought in to oversee an investigation into ‘the permissive society’. As relevant now as it was in 1972 (politicians still trot out the same cynical anti-smut arguments as those mocked here), it’s conversely very much of its time – you can’t imagine a modern TV show mocking clean up campaigners like Mary Whitehouse or Cliff Richard (here rechristened “Dick Burns”) – modern producers and writers would be more likely to sympathise with the anti-porn argument – or showing genuine Nigerian execution footage (fans of Faces of Death 2 will recognise this as the imagery that closed the film).\n\nBuy: Amazon.co.uk\n\nI very much wanted to like Doomwatch, but in the end, it felt very hard going. Clearly, there is a lot of love for the show still, but how much of this is rose-tinted childhood memory is open to question. I can’t see many people under 40 getting very much from this series, to be honest – the technical and production deficiencies will be just too much to move beyond, I suspect. But even as someone used to the BBC style of the era, I found this something of a struggle, and my disappointment was increased because unlike many shows, it felt as though Doomwatch deserved to be better than it ultimately turns out to be.\n\nDavid Flint, review courtesy of The Reprobate\n\nKill Command (also known as Identify) is a 2016 British science fiction action horror film written and directed by Steven Gomez, making his feature debut. It stars Thure Lindhardt and Vanessa Kirby. The story focuses on a group of U.S. Marines attempting to survive after a training mission against warfare A.I. goes wrong.\n\nOpening plot:\n\nIn a technologically advanced near future, Katherine Mills, a cyborg working for Harbinger Corporation, discovers a reprogramming anomaly regarding a warfare A.I. system located at Harbinger I Training Facility, an undisclosed military training island. She meets with Captain Damien Bukes and his team consisting of Drifter, Robinson, Cutbill, Goodwin, Hackett, and Loftus – all of whom have been assigned to a two-day training mission at Harbinger I.\n\nUpon their arrival, the team notices global communications have been disabled, limiting them to local access only. They discover autonomously operating surveillance drones monitoring them. The team begins their mission of eliminating A.I. threats.\n\nThe first encounter proves easy for the team as they eliminate A.I. drones from a vantage point. During the battle, Mills discovers an advanced S.A.R. (Study Analyze Reprogram) unit, S.A.R.-003, but is unable to access it. That night, Drifter and Mills discuss their pasts and Bukes’ disdain for her. Later, Loftus is killed by the S.A.R. unit.\n\nThe next day, they discover Loftus’s body at the location of the first encounter. The drones take the team’s original vantage point and kill Hackett. They discover the A.I. is adapting and learning from them…\n\nReviews:\n\n” …it’s a brisk, accomplished effort with a lot more wit, integrity, and intelligence than some of the more lavishly-budgeted genre movies which overwhelm the multiplexes. Our command… watch Kill Command.” Paul Mount, Starburst\n\n“For a low-budget British film, this has great robot/effects design – courtesy of writer/director Steven Gomez’s background in visual effects. However, it has an over familiar premise, not much in the way of plot and is even a touch monotonous in the action department.” The Kim Newman Web Site\n\n“The bare-bones storytelling and character-development-on-the-fly might be indebted to Walter Hill’s work on Alien, but Gomez, a former visual effects artist making his debut, doesn’t have the chops to turn it into anything remotely intriguing, let alone special. Along with the European ensemble cast talking with cockamamie American accents, mouthing dialogue taken from the Bumper Book of Soldier Clichés written by James Cameron…” Martyn Contario, SciFiNow\n\n“It’s a sci-fi action thriller whose borrowings are very plain, but it’s decent and watchable nonetheless, with an interesting central character premise … Gamers will have a bit of deja vu watching this but it is a well managed movie with some cool, controlled performances among the detonations.” Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian\n\n“In terms of the performances, Kirby comes off best, aided by some striking VFX work on her glowing blue eyes, but the screenplay fails to deliver on the promising resentment that her presence on the mission initially provokes. As robo thrillers go, this has its moments, but the mechanical script could have used a little more in the way of human warmth.” Matthew Turner, The List\n\n“The film’s main asset – the impressive digital effects that create the formidable sentient battle machines – is also its main problem. Having designed the robots, the film-makers show them off to the audience at every available opportunity, ignoring the basic rule of cinema that the most effective threat is the one that we create in our own minds.” Wendy Ide, The Observer\n\nCast and characters:\n\nThure Lindhardt as Captain Damien Bukes\n\nVanessa Kirby as Katherine Mills\n\nDavid Ajala as Drifter\n\nBentley Kalu as Sergeant Rory Robinson\n\nTom McKay as Corporal Robert Cutbill\n\nMike Noble as Lance Corporal Martin Goodwin\n\nKelly Gough as Corporal Daniella Hackett\n\nOsi Okerafor as Corporal Sam Loftus\n\nFilming locations:\n\nColdharbour, near Docking\n\nOld Vinyl factory in Hayes, London, England\n\nWikipedia | IMDb\n\n‘Face your deepest fear’\n\nThe Descent is a 2005 British horror film written and directed by Neil Marshall (Tales of Halloween; Dog Soldiers).\n\nThe plot follows six women who, having entered an unmapped cave system, become trapped and are hunted by blood-thirsty human hybrids lurking within.\n\nBuy: Amazon.co.uk\n\nThe film took $57.1 million at the box office against a reported budget of £3.5 million. A sequel, titled The Descent Part 2, was released in 2009.\n\nThe skull of women motif used in some advertising material is based on Philippe Halsman‘s In Voluptas Mors photograph.\n\nThe film’s marketing campaign in the UK was disrupted by the London bombings in July 2005. Adverts on London’s transport system (including the bus that had exploded) had included posters that carried the quote, “Outright terror… bold and brilliant”, and depicted a terrified woman screaming in a tunnel.\n\nThe film’s distributor in the UK, Pathé, recalled the posters and reworked the campaign to exclude the word “terror” from advertised reviews of The Descent. Pathé also distributed the new versions to TV and radio stations. The distributor’s marketing chief, Anna Butler, said of the new approach, “We changed tack to concentrate on the women involved all standing together and fighting back. That seemed to chime with the prevailing mood of defiance that set in the weekend after the bombs.”\n\nThe Descent was released in North America with approximately a minute cut from the end. In the American theatrical cut, Sarah escapes from the cave and sees Juno, but the film does not cut back to the cave.\n\nIn the 4 August 2006 issue of Entertainment Weekly, it was stated that the ending was trimmed because American viewers did not like its “uber-hopeless finale”. Lionsgate marketing chief Tim Palen said, “It’s a visceral ride, and by the time you get to the ending you’re drained. [Director Neil] Marshall had a number of endings in mind when he shot the film, so he was open [to making a switch].” Marshall compared the change to the ending of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, saying, “Just because she gets away, does that make it a happy ending?” The North American Unrated DVD includes the original ending.\n\nBuy: Amazon.com\n\nPlot:\n\nA year after the tragic death of her husband and young daughter on the drive back from an adventure holiday, Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) and her adventurous girlfriends, Juno (Natalie Mendoza), Beth (Alex Reid, Arachnid) , Sam (MyAnna Buring, Kill List) and Rebecca (Saskia Mulder) are reunited at a cabin in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina (admirably portrayed by the wilds of Scotland and Buckinghamshire). Holly (Nora-Jane Noone), Juno’s new friend, is introduced.\n\nWhilst Sarah begins to imagine the time she had with her family just twelve months prior, she is whisked along to a potholing jamboree in a cave-system kept as a surprise by Juno. Alas, no sooner have they begun to explore, than the passageway collapses behind them, shutting them in what, Juno now admits, is a completely unmapped labyrinth of tunnels and caverns. Despite the group’s previous disastrous holiday, no-one thought to inform anyone where they were going.\n\nAs the unhappy group progress through the gloom, they find evidence of previous explorers and, more pertinently, cave drawings describing a second exit from the cave, towards which, they hopefully advance. No sooner have they set off than Holly falls and suffers a pleasingly graphic compound fracture of her leg; Sarah applies a splint, though you imagine the entire group is relived it happened to the most annoying of their number.\n\nWhilst collecting their thoughts, Sarah fleetingly spies a figure in the murk, the others essentially patting her on the head, assuming she’s still suffering mental trauma. Exasperated and frightened, Sarah is proved right as the girls find that indeed they are not alone and something humanoid is hunting them down, like lions in the savannah, attacking the weakest (Holly) and ripping out her throat. In the melee of pickaxes and claws, Juno accidentally plunges her rock climbing equipment into Beth, a fact she is not too happy about but does little to resolve.\n\nBriefly the group are separated but Juno locates Sam and Rebecca, dispatching another of the ever-increasing number of troglodytes before further casualties are inflicted. She convinces the duo to continue on with her towards the exit, despite Sarah being missing. Fearing for their lives and owing something of a debt of gratitude, they relent.\n\nMeanwhile, Sarah is still alive, slightly more-so than Beth who is more blood than flesh but still manages to inform her friend that not only had Juno done her a mischief but had also been having an affair with Sarah’s dead husband, which she proves by producing a pendant she snatched from the increasingly unpopular ‘friend’. Now in a clouded rage, she mercy-kills Beth and slays a family of the pale creatures en-route to find the others.\n\nMost of the ladies have by now realised the creatures are blind, a result of their evolution underground, though have excellent hearing. This knowledge is ultimately redundant, as the creatures mastery of their domain means that escape is almost impossible, First to demonstrate this are Rebecca and Sam, leaving only Juno and Sarah to fend off their attackers and seek salvation. They’ve come so far but is Sarah in the mood for forgiveness, and even if she is, is there any chance to escape?\n\nReview:\n\nAfter the huge critical and commercial success of Neil Marshall’s debut effort, 2002’s Dog Soldiers, everybody waited expectantly to give him a polite ripple of applause for his follow-up but not to push his luck. Much eating of head-wear followed when it was clear that Marshall had at least equalled his efforts and had pushed himself and his team yet further, filming a low-budget horror film with a small cast in a near to pitch-black environment. In fact, no caves were harmed during the making of this movie, the immersive and believable sets being made at Pinewood.\n\nThe Descent has, aside from the creatures and a brief appearance by Sarah’s husband, an all female cast, an intentional device but one which is somewhat nailed-on and for the most part, glaring. The film doesn’t suffer as such, the group still has an alpha female, a brash annoyance and a baddie but it’s an unnecessary ‘first’ and not the only example of the film-maker perhaps trying a little too hard, when their storytelling skill and understanding of what it means to be frightened were already sound.The actresses all do a sterling job both emotionally and physically, their rock-climbing exertions regularly being wince-inducing for the audience. Helpfully, they are given different accents, a huge help in distinguishing who’s who in the necessarily dark filming environment.\n\nIt’s frustrating to watch a film which feasts on such raw human fears – the dark, being lost, claustrophobia, loneliness, things going bump in the dark – knowing that if every horror film director tapped into such universal emotions, we’d be left with far less chaff. The dark is dealt with bravely and skilfully, the only light being of provided sources, torches, helmets, watch displays and the like. The creatures, known retrospectively as crawlers, are well-devised in many respects, pale and pathetic on one level, possessed of cunning and finely-honed senses on the other.\n\nThere are niggling gaps – their excellent hearing makes up for lack of sight but whispering is apparently fine (take heed of the zombies of the Blind Dead series, able to hear even the beating of your heart!) and one might think that a sense of touch would also be similarly keen but their ability to sense the heat of flaming torches and indeed the trapped party’s body-heat is lacking. Curmudgeonly sorts may point to their similarity to Gollum of Tolkein fame.\n\nThough an effective score is provided by David Julyan (The Cabin in the Woods), the traditional musical stingers designed to make the audience jump, are instead easily facilitated by the rasping crawlers appearing out of nowhere.\n\nAs is many a film’s wont, despite the presence of the crawlers, the human participants pose at least the equal amount of physical and psychological danger. The film just about stays the sensible side of the 2000’s version of the 80’s trapping of ‘it was all a dream’, fortunate – although it was felt a statement had to be made beyond the basic plight of the cavers, it would be refreshing to have a horror film that didn’t fall back on ulterior factors, as if to suggest just being a horror film wasn’t enough.\n\nThe crawlers themselves, humanoid enough to clarify that they have evolved from Earth not from Mars, are the work of Paul Hyett (Howl; The Facility, Eden Lake) and his team, the prosthetics being anatomically sensible but still repulsive, their appearance being hidden from the actresses until filming started, ramping up the tension yet further. The film spawned one, ill-advised, sequel, whilst Marshall has yet to recapture his early vigour and invention on the big screen.\n\nDaz Lawrence, Horrorpedia\n\nBuy: Amazon.co.uk\n\nOther reviews:\n\n” …Marshall delivers what amounts to a feature-length exploitation of viewer phobias — distressingly claustrophobic and shot so vertiginously that it feels as though you’re dangling in the cave with the women. The generously gelatinous gore isn’t without metaphorical purpose either. As the cave gets wormier and wetter, tighter and more terrifying, it feels like a womb thick with amniotic fluid.” Nick Rogers, The Film Yap\n\n“Its no hyperbole to call Neil Marshall’s second feature a masterpiece. It succeeds brilliantly on technical and artistic level and it achieves the basic aim of any horror film. It is as scary as hell.” MJ Simpson, Urban Terrors: New British Horror Cinema 1997 – 2008\n\nBuy: Amazon.com | Amazon.co.uk\n\n” …carefully establishes the psychological relationships among the women, then squanders this calibrated and generally plausible setup with a series of crude, implausible, and scattershot horror effects. The two strains are supposed to merge but mix like oil and water as the narrative grows increasingly incoherent (the fact that so much of it transpires in darkness doesn’t help).\n\n“Marshall could very well be the Caravaggio of the B-movie. Working in complete darkness, he playfully uses the cavers’ equipment as his paintbrush … As for a “deeper meaning,” Marshall covers that, too. What is most haunting about this film is Sarah’s own descent into feral madness. In one close-up, her blue eyes pierce the blood that covers her face, and we realize that she might have transformed into a creature herself.” Sarah Lilleyman, Time\n\n“One of the scariest films of this or any decade… Ultimately, The Descent is the purest kind of horror film – ruthless, unforgiving, showing no mercy.” Bloody Disgusting\n\nCast and characters:\n\nShauna Macdonald as Sarah Carter\n\nNatalie Mendoza as Juno Kaplan\n\nAlex Reid as Elizabeth “Beth” O’Brien\n\nMyAnna Buring as Samantha “Sam” Vernet\n\nSaskia Mulder as Rebecca Vernet\n\nNora-Jane Noone as Holly\n\nOliver Milburn as Paul Carter\n\nMolly Kayll as Jessica Carter\n\nWikipedia | IMDb\n\n‘Beware the stare that will paralyze the will of the world’\n\nVillage of the Damned is a 1960 British science fiction horror film by German director Wolf Rilla. The film is adapted from the novel The Midwich Cuckoos (1957) by John Wyndham (Web).\n\nA sequel, Children of the Damned (1963), followed, as did a remake by John Carpenter, also titled Village of the Damned (1995).\n\nThe film was originally a 1957 American project, to be filmed at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios in Culver City, California. Ronald Colman was contracted for the leading role, but MGM shelved the project, bowing to pressure from religious groups that objected to the apparently sinister depiction of virgin birth.\n\nRonald Colman died in May 1958—by coincidence, his widow, actress Benita Hume, married actor George Sanders in 1959, and the latter was cast in the role that Colman was originally due to play. The film was transferred to the MGM British Studios.\n\nThe blonde wigs that the children wore were padded to give the impression that they had abnormally large heads. The children were lit in such a way as to cause the irises and pupils of their eyes to merge into a large black disc against the whites of their eyes, to give them an eerie look. The American release includes shots where the children’s eyes actually glow.\n\nBuy: Amazon.com | Amazon.co.uk\n\nMain cast:\n\nGeorge Sanders (Psychomania; The Lodger), Barbara Shelley, (The Gorgon; Blood of the Vampire; Cat Girl) Martin Stephens, Michael Gwynn (Scars of Dracula; What a Carve Up), Laurence Naismith, Richard Warner.\n\nOpening plot:\n\nThe inhabitants of the British village of Midwich suddenly fall unconscious, as does anyone entering the village. The military establishes a cordon around Midwich and sends in a man wearing a gas mask, but he, too, falls unconscious and is pulled back with rope. The man awakens and reports experiencing a cold sensation just before passing out. The pilot of a military reconnaissance plane is contacted and asked to investigate. When he flies below 5,000 feet, he loses consciousness and the plane crashes. A five-mile exclusion zone around the village is established for all aircraft. The villagers regain consciousness and apparently are unaffected.\n\nTwo months later, all women and girls of childbearing age in the affected area are discovered to be pregnant, sparking many accusations of infidelity and extramarital sex. The accusations fade as the extraordinary nature of the pregnancies is discovered, with seven-month fetuses appearing after only five months.\n\nAll the women give birth on the same day. Their children have an unusual appearance, including “arresting” eyes, odd scalp hair construction and colour (platinum blond), and unusually narrow fingernails. As they grow and develop at a rapid rate, it becomes clear they also have a powerful telepathic bond with one another. They can communicate with each other over great distances, and as one learns something, so do the others…\n\nContemporary reviews:\n\n“As a horror film with a difference it’ll give you the creeps for 77 minutes.” Dilys Powell, The Sunday Times, 20 June 1960\n\n” …as a quietly civilized exercise in the fear and power of the unknown this picture is one of the trimmest, most original and serenely unnerving little chillers in a long time” Howard Thompson, New York Times, 8 Dec 1960\n\nOther reviews:\n\n“This is a horror milestone, not just for its unique concept, but also for the director’s willingness to push the standards of the day at the conclusion of film, which was (and remains) anything but formulaic … Any true horror fan must take a trip back through time once in awhile to remind himself/herself how the genre progressed through the ages and appreciate the particulars of a bygone era.” John Strand, Horror Freak News\n\n“With a chilling performance from Martin Stephens as David, the outspoken leader of the children, Village of the Damned is an incredibly effective thriller. It helps that the film is focused on a group of mind controlling children, always a great choice to sends shivers up someone’s spine” The Film Reel\n\n“Besides a strong cast, who play their parts without a hint of campiness, Village of the Damned also possesses powerful direction from Wolf Rilla. The scenes are crisp and subtle. There is very little onscreen violence, but suspense and suggestion are used competently. Even without a lot of action, we never lose interest in the story.” Exclamation Mark\n\n“The film is remarkably faithful to the novel, but Rilla’s direction is surprisingly pedestrian, failing to make enough of the enigmatic world Wyndham creates.” The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Science Fiction\n\nCast and characters:\n\nGeorge Sanders as Gordon Zellaby\n\nBarbara Shelley as Anthea Zellaby\n\nMartin Stephens as David Zellaby\n\nMichael Gwynn as Alan Bernard\n\nLaurence Naismith as Doctor Willers\n\nRichard Warner as Harrington\n\nJenny Laird as Mrs. Harrington\n\nSarah Long as Evelyn Harrington\n\nThomas Heathcote as James Pawle\n\nCharlotte Mitchell as Janet Pawle\n\nPamela Buck as Milly Hughes\n\nRosamund Greenwood as Miss Ogle\n\nSusan Richards as Mrs. Plumpton\n\nBernard Archard as Vicar\n\nPeter Vaughan as P.C. Gobby\n\nJohn Phillips as General Leighton\n\nRichard Vernon as Sir Edgar Hargraves\n\nJohn Stuart as Professor Smith\n\nKeith Pyott as Dr. Carlisle\n\nFilming locations:\n\nThe village of Letchmore Heath, near Watford. Local buildings, such as The Three Horseshoes Pub and Aldenham School, were used during filming.\n\nInfluence:\n\nThe climactic scene in which the children break down Zellaby’s mental brick wall is #92 on the Bravo miniseries 100 Scariest Movie Moments.\n\nThe film is parodied in “Wild Barts Can’t Be Broken,” the eleventh episode of the tenth season of American animated series The Simpsons, as a horror movie titled The Bloodening.\n\nWikipedia | IMDb | Image credits: Wrong Side of the Art!"
