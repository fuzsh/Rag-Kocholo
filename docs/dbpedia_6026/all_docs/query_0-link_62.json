        "text": "Source: http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/donald-trump-immigration-address-transcript-227614\n\nAugust 31, 2016\n\nRemarks as prepared for delivery and obtained by POLITICO Wednesday night.\n\nThank you, Phoenix. I am so glad to be back in Arizona, a state that has a very special place in my heart.\n\nI love the people of Arizona and, together, we are going to win the White House in November.\n\nTonight is not going to be a normal rally speech.\n\nInstead, I am going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today: immigration.\n\nI have just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the President of Mexico – a man I like and respect very much, and a man who truly loves his country. Just like I am a man who loves the United States.\n\nWe agreed on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns and people across our border, and to put the cartels out of business.\n\nWe also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico, and the close friendship between our two nations.\n\nIt was a thoughtful and substantive conversation. This is the first of what I expect will be many conversations in a Trump Administration about creating a new relationship between our two countries.\n\nBut to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington. There is no other way.\n\nThe truth is, our immigration system is worse than anyone realizes. But the facts aren’t known because the media won’t report on them, the politicians won’t talk about them, and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up.\n\nToday you will get the truth.\n\nThe fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful politicians. Let me tell you who it doesn’t serve: it doesn’t serve you, the American people.\n\nWhen politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, and lower wages.\n\nImmigration reform should mean something else entirely: it should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.\n\nBut if we are going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and sensitive issues.\n\nFor instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people have over the record pace of immigration and its impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills, and living conditions. These are valid concerns, expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds.\n\nWe also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. It is our right as a sovereign nation to choose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish here.\n\nThen there is the issue of security. Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws.\n\nI have met with many of the parents who lost their children to Sanctuary Cities and open borders. They will be joining me on the stage later today.\n\nCountless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this Administration. This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into a U.S. community under the policies of this White House. He was released again after the crime, and is now at large.\n\nSarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top of her class, the day before.\n\nAlso among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody.\n\nAnother victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times.\n\nThen there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administration’s priorities for removal.\n\nIn California, a 64 year-old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but was never deported.\n\nA 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names.\n\nOn top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion dollars a year. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next ten years, we could provide one million at-risk students with a school voucher.\n\nWhile there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, this doesn’t change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower-skilled workers with less education who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they will ever pay in.\n\nBut these facts are never reported.\n\nInstead, the media and my opponent discuss one thing, and only this one thing: the needs of people living here illegally.\n\nThe truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants – or however many there may be.\n\nThat has never been the central issue. It will never be the central issue.\n\nAnyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington.\n\nOnly out of touch media elites think the biggest problem facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don’t have legal status.\n\nTo all the politicians, donors and special interests, hear these words from me today: there is only one core issue in the immigration debate and it is this: the well-being of the American people. Nothing even comes a close second.\n\nHillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated. But she’s not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable death. No, she’s only talking about families who came here in violation of the law.\n\nWe will treat everyone living or residing in our country with dignity. We will be fair, just and compassionate to all. But our greatest compassion must be for American citizens.\n\nPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders. President Obama and Hillary Clinton support Sanctuary Cities, they support catch-and-release on the border, they support visa overstays, they support the release of dangerous criminals from detention – and they support unconstitutional executive amnesty.\n\nHillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants – breaking the federal budget. On top of that, she promises uncontrolled low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, especially African-American and Hispanic workers. This includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees in a four-year term.\n\nNow that you’ve heard about Hillary Clinton’s plan – about which she has not answered a single substantive question – let me tell you about my plan.\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from federal immigration officers, along with top immigration experts who represent workers, not corporations. I also worked with lawmakers who’ve led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years, and most importantly, I’ve met with the people directly impacted by these policies.\n\nNumber One: We will build a wall along the Southern Border.\n\nOn day one, we will begin working on an impenetrable physical wall on the southern border. We will use the best technology, including above-and below-ground sensors, towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels, and keep out the criminal cartels, and Mexico will pay for the wall.\n\nNumber Two: End Catch-And-Release\n\nUnder my Administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country.\n\nNumber Three: Zero tolerance for criminal aliens.\n\nAccording to federal data, there are at least 2 million criminal aliens now inside the country. We will begin moving them out day one, in joint operations with local, state and federal law enforcement.\n\nBeyond the 2 million, there are a vast number of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled or evaded justice. But their days on the run will soon be over. They go out, and they go out fast.\n\nMoving forward, we will issue detainers for all illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings. We will terminate the Obama Administration’s deadly non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets.\n\nSince 2013 alone, the Obama Administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into U.S. communities – these are individuals encountered or identified by ICE but who not detained or processed for deportation.\n\nMy plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens.\n\nWe will restore the highly successful Secure Communities program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails. Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this Administration. This is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction.\n\nOn my first day in office, I am also going to ask Congress to pass “Kate’s Law” – named for Kate Steinle – to ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry face receive strong mandatory minimum sentences.\n\nAnother reform I am proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, two law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously-deported illegal immigrant. The Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly identified and removed.\n\nWe are going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers. Within ICE, I am going to create a new special Deportation Task Force, focused on identifying and removing quickly the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice.\n\nThe local police know who every one of these criminals are. There’s no great mystery to it, they’ve put up with it for years. And now, finally, we will turn the tables and law enforcement will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.\n\nWe’re also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents, and put more of them on the border, instead of behind desks. We will expand the number of Border Patrol Stations.\n\nI’ve had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them. The endorsement I’ve received from the Border Patrol officers means more to me than I can say.\n\nNumber Four: Block Funding For Sanctuary Cities\n\nWe will end the Sanctuary Cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.\n\nNumber Five: Cancel Unconstitutional Executive Orders & Enforce All Immigration Laws\n\nWe will immediately terminate President Obama’s two illegal executive amnesties, in which he defied federal law and the constitution to give amnesty to approximately 5 million illegal immigrants.\n\nHillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs – including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked by the Supreme Court. Clinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty.\n\nClinton’s plan would trigger a Constitutional Crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before. In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office.\n\nIn a Trump Administration, all immigration laws will be enforced. As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But, unlike this Administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement – and ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs. Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation – that is what it means to have laws and to have a country.\n\nOur enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges – that is, those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net, along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who’ve come here under the current Administration.\n\nNumber Six: We Are Going To Suspend The Issuance Of Visas To Any Place Where Adequate Screening Cannot Occur\n\nAccording to data provided to the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign-born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States. The number is likely higher, but the Administration refuses to provide this information to Congress.\n\nAs soon as I enter office, I am going to ask the Department of State, Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put into place.\n\nCountries from which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya.\n\nFor the price of resettling 1 refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region.\n\nAnother reform involves new screening tests for all applicants that include an ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.\n\nFor instance, in the last five years, we’ve admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan – in these two countries, according to Pew research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified.\n\nApplicants will be asked for their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities, attitudes on Radical Islam, and many other topics as part of the vetting procedure.\n\nNumber Seven: We will ensure that other countries take their people back when we order them deported\n\nThere are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they have been ordered to leave the United States, including large numbers of violent criminals. Due to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into U.S. communities. There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick’s tragic death in Connecticut just last year. Yet, despite the existence of a law that commands the Secretary of State to stop issuing visas to these countries, Secretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance.\n\nThe result of her misconduct was the release of thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home.\n\nAccording to a report from the Boston Globe, from the year 2008 through 2014, nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not take them back. Many of these 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton’s watch – she had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she didn’t do it.\n\nThose released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assault and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable, who went on to reoffend at a very high rate.\n\nNumber Eight: We will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system.\n\nFor years, Congress has required a biometric entry-exit visa tracking system, but it has never been completed.\n\nIn my Administration, we will ensure that this system is in place at all land, air, and sea ports. Approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never left. Beyond violating our laws, visa overstays pose a substantial threat to national security. The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system should be a high priority and “would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in August and September 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the U.S. on expired visas.”\n\nLast year alone, nearly a half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas. Removing visa overstays will be a top priority of my Administration. If people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never leave – the Obama-Clinton policy – then we have a completely open border. We must send the message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.\n\nNumber Nine: We will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.\n\nWe will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.\n\nImmigration law doesn’t exist just for the purpose of keeping out criminals. It exists to protect all aspects of American life – the worksite, the welfare office, the education system and much else. That is why immigration limits are established in the first place. If we only enforce the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world.\n\nI will enforce all of our immigration laws.\n\nThe same goes for government benefits. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants used some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs, like food stamps or housing assistance. This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the U.S. treasury.\n\nThose who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for removal.\n\nNumber 10: We will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers\n\nWe’ve admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015.\n\nMany of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country. But we now have an obligation to them, and to their children, to control future immigration – as we have following previous immigration waves – to ensure assimilation, integration and upward mobility.\n\nWithin just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records.\n\nThe time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals:\n\n· To keep immigration levels, measured by population share, within historical norms\n\n· To select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society, and their ability to be financially self-sufficient. We need a system that serves our needs – remember, it’s America First.\n\n· To choose immigrants based on merit, skill and proficiency\n\n· And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first.\n\nWe want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally and properly-vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest.\n\nWe’ve been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago. To avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them. We wouldn’t put our entire federal budget on autopilot for decades, so why should we do the same for immigration?\n\nLet’s talk about the big picture\n\nThese ten steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last fifty years.\n\nBecause I am not a politician, because I am not beholden to any special interest, I will get this done for you and your family.\n\nWe will accomplish all of the steps outlined above, and when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail. Crime will go down, border crossings will plummet, gangs will disappear, and welfare use will decrease. We will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our inner cities.\n\nFor those here today illegally who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and only one route: to return home and apply for re-entry under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. Those who have left to seek entry under this new system will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to enter under the immigration caps or limits that will be established.\n\nWe will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. There will be no amnesty.\n\nOur message to the world will be this: you cannot obtain legal status, or become a citizen of the United States, by illegally entering our country.\n\nThis declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays.\n\nPeople will know that you can’t just smuggle in, hunker down, and wait to be legalized. Those days are over.\n\nIn several years, when we have accomplished all of our enforcement goals – and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, and the establishment of our new lawful immigration system – then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those who remain. That discussion can only take place in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.\n\nRight now, however, we are in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis, and a terrorism crisis. All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security. That is the only conversation we should be having at this time.\n\nWhether it’s dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas, or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing – and the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clinton’s answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security.\n\nThese are matters of life-and-death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhat we do know, despite the total lack of media curiosity, is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. The result will be millions more illegal immigrants, thousands more violent crimes, and total chaos and lawlessness.\n\nThis election is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration, and reform our laws to make your life better.\n\nThis is it. We won’t get another opportunity – it will be too late.\n\nSo I want to remind everyone what we are fighting for – and who we are fighting for.\n\nSo I am going to ask all the Angel Moms to come join me on the stage right now.\n\n[[PAUSE FOR ANGEL MOMS – EACH SAYS THE NAME OF THEIR CHILD INTO THE MICROPHONE]]\n\nNow is the time for these voices to be heard.\n\nNow is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf.\n\nNow is the time for all of us, as one country, Democrat and Republican, liberal and conservative, to band together to deliver justice and safety and security for all Americans.\n\nLet’s fix this problem.\n\nLet’s secure our border.\n\nLet’s stop the drugs and the crime.\n\nLet’s protect our Social Security and Medicare.\n\nAnd let’s get unemployed Americans off of welfare and back to work in their own country.\n\nTogether, we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures.\n\nTogether, we can save America itself.\n\nJoin me in this mission to Make America Great Again.\n\nThank you, and God Bless you all!\n\nSource: https://web.archive.org/web/20151018145627/http://articles.philly.com/1987-09-25/news/26207027_1_elizabeth-arden-barrymore-ringo-starr\n\nPosted:\n\nBARRY LETS IT ALL HANG OUT\n\nBarry Manilow's autobiography, out next Thursday, trashes him, his mom and Bette Midler, not necessarily in that order.\n\nIn \"Sweet Life: Adventures on the Way to Paradise\" the king of melodramatic elevator music talks about his own emotional uptightness, his mother's drinking problem and suicide attempts, and characterizes his three years working the Continental Baths in New York with Midler as \"every Jewish boy's nightmare come to life.\"\n\nWhile Midler's reaction is yet to be recorded, his mother says the book's all right with her, \"because that's not how I am now.

It takes me away to that time in New England - those long rocky beaches, where we stood like ships that passed in the night.\n\nWe smiled and said it's all right.\n\nThere are probably ships out there passing in the night, tonight. But it's too darn cold to stand here and look for 'em, and anyway the light from the Popeye's Fried Chicken place makes it hard to see beyond the sand.\n\nTwilight time is long gone. I hunch my shoulders to the sea and face the behemoth hotel-casino called Resorts, where the stretch limos stretch and the crowds crowd in, up the escalator and into the glittering Superstar Theater, where they await Barry Manilow.\n\nAnd where Barry Manilow's concession stand awaits them: T-shirts, books, buttons and baubles, all plastered with the famous mug (the National Enquirer headline: \"I've Got a Big Nose - and I Like It!\").\n\n\"Yeah, it's going real well,\" smiles Charlie Robinson, manning the Manilow merchandise Friday night for the first of four shows in town as part of the singer's \"Big Fun Tour De Force\" tour.\n\nIt's going way better than Vegas, reports the concessionaire. Nearly as good as a non-casino Manilow gig.\n\n\"There's a lot of people invited by the casinos that are here to gamble more than to see Manilow,\" Robinson, a member of the road crew, explains. ''But we're doing surprisingly well. He's got a strong following on the East Coast and this is one of the first chances in years to see him.\"\n\nRobinson can't disclose what \"surprisingly well\" is. \"You'd be surprised how much, though.\"\n\nThe Barry Manilow sweatshirt is $25.\n\n\"That's cheap. We do a lot of different acts, and for a lot of them it's $27 or $30. We had to taper it down a bit with the older crowd. They hedge more than the younger kids do.\"\n\nThe three-night stand in Atlantic City, which ended yesterday, is the second leg of the \"Tour De Force\" tour. It began in Vegas in January and continues into March and St. Louis and Oklahoma City.\n\nIt is about to begin here, in the Superstar Theater, where 1,300 folks - from London and New London, from Tokyo and Toledo, from uptown and downtown - sit at their tables. Their faces illumined by quivering candlelight and a million tiny lightbulbs, rimming the tiered room. The 1,300 sit, fingering fat $1 Resorts coins in their pockets, pulling on cigarettes, nursing their Fuzzy Navels and Pina Coladas.\n\nThere are a lot of Fuzzy Navels and Pina Coladas. The waitresses tell you that once the show starts, they can't serve drinks. They suggest you double up.\n\nPeople double up.\n\nIt is just past 10 p.m. The lights dim in the glittering Superstar Theater. Back in an aisle, a spotlight finds the glittering superstar himself, carrying a cordless mike and a tune: \"I'm Your Man.\"\n\nHe makes for the stage. \"I'm what you're waiting for! Here I am! I'm your man!\" he sings. His 10-piece band plugs away. The rhythm is up.\n\nHe wears a double-breasted pin-stripe jacket, broad at the shoulder and snug at the hip. He wears black tuxedo pants. He wears a white silk shirt. He wears a brooch.\n\n\"Hello Atlantic City! What fun you are! What fun you are already!\"\n\nCheers. Yelps. Squeals and screams.\n\nThis is the new Barry Manilow, the 41-year-old Brooklyn balladeer who writes the songs that make the whole world sing - \"Mandy,\"\"Ships,\"''Somewhere in the Night,\"\"Could It Be Magic\" (OK, some of them he didn't write) - and who has now incorporated '40s jazz and cabaret into his act.\n\nIt's sort of conceptual: There are characters (Mambo Jones, the King of Latin Swing), and there are standards (Barry crooning \"Stardust,\" or making like the Federal Express guy in a fast-talkin' flurry of vocal jazz on the cool classic \"Cloudburst\").\n\nAnd there's a sort of musical autobiography, wherein Barry explains how, as a child, his mother made him practice the accordion. A living-room set - replete with plastic-covered furniture and lampshades - is wheeled on and the crooner grabs his accordion and demonstrates how even today's big hits sound like hoary old things on the instrument. To wit, Madonna's \"Like a Virgin\" becomes a polka.\n\n\"Take Madonna,\" says Barry. \"And many would like to\" - (beat) - \"and many have.\"\n\nIn his entry in Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock-and-Roll, Manilow is termed \"a one-man urban melting pot. (His) personality blends Italo-American balladry with Jewish vaudeville shtick, a Brill Building song sense and a dash of cabaret camp.\"\n\nThis is no lie. Especially the part about vaudeville.\n\nAt one point, Barry relays an off-color parable about a frozen bird that lands in a pile of cow dung.\n\nIt is also no lie that the female population of the glittering Superstar Theater is completely taken with the guy: his humor (\"I thank you from the bottom of my heart and the heart of my bottom\"), his honesty (\"I'm the worst joke teller you've ever heard in your life\"), and his hair.\n\n(He himself is taken with his hair: He fluffs it as he wails, \"Baby I need you now,\" and he fluffs it a lot of other times, too.)\n\n\"The best thing about being Barry's fan is that you can think of him as your friend,\" says Doreen Lynne Kline of Brooklyn, who is seated in the first row, along with her camera, her tape recorder and her friend, Lisa Rettig of the Bronx. \"There is no wall up there. He doesn't separate himself from his fans like some other entertainers.\"\n\nThis point is eerily illustrated a few moments later when Barry, singing ''Tryin' to Get the Feeling Again\" - a song about a romance turned sour - sits at the edge of the stage, his chipmunk features maybe this far (or this close) from a woman in strapless black leather. The woman has a bottle of cognac and a card for Barry. He takes the bottle but misses the epistle. This is very upsetting.\n\nKline and Rettig, both in their late 20s, got their first-row seats by waiting in line for 24 hours. They would have waited twice that long. They have the same seats for all four of the engagements. They have seen Barry many, many times. Last year, when Barry was signing copies of his autobiography, Sweet Life: Adventures on the Way to Paradise, in Manhattan, and Rettig was waiting in line outside in the cold, he came by and wrapped his coat around her.\n\nBarry has moved to the piano, teasing the ivories with the intro to \"When Will I Hold You Again.\"\n\nAs his fingers meander, so too his thoughts: \"Going against the grain is never an easy thing to do. Feeling like a misfit when you're growing up is not the most pleasant experience. But I'll tell you something: If you're wise, when you grow up you can use it to your advantage. You take your weaknesses and you turn them into assets. That's what I try to do.\n\n\"I will always be grateful to my family for giving me the support and the encouragement I needed to become an individual.\"\n\nWild applause.\n\nIt is time for the part of the show where Barry picks a volunteer (female, must know the words) to join him on stage for \"Can't Smile Without You.\" Hands go up all over. \"Barry, over here!\"\"Me!\"\"Me!\"\n\nHe descends into the crowd and goes for a dark-haired woman in a dark suit, midway back. Her name is Diane, a graphic artist from Allentown.\n\nHe takes her hand, leads her to the stage. She gets her own microphone and the two coo: \"You know, I can't smile without you.\" A videocam documents the duet. Afterward, Barry signs the videotape and gives it to Diane. A memory, captured forever.\n\n\"The closest to heaven I'll be for a while,\" says Diane Kalb, after the concert. She is 23 and has seen Barry perform that many times, plus two.\n\n\"The closest to heaven,\" she repeats.\n\nIt is not everyone's idea of heaven. In fact, Manilow precedes his show- stopping medley of hits (like 25 of them) with an apologia. \"For those of you dragged here tonight,\" he smiles, \"this medley's going to be agony.\"\n\nThe agony and the ecstasy.\n\n\"I've been alive forever. . . . Even now this pain inside of me goes on and on. . . . At the Copa, the Copacabana. . . . Read 'em and weep. . . . Tryin' to get the feeling again, the one that made me shiver, made my knees start to quiver. . . . Doctor, my woman is coming back home late today. . . . Baby I need you now, now, now and hold on fast, could this be the magic at last. . . .\n\n\"We dreamers have our ways of facing rainy days, somehow we survive, we keep the feelings warm, protect them from the storm, until our time arrives. . . .\n\n\"I kept my world protected, I made it through the rain, I kept my point of view and found myself respected by the others who got rained on too.\"\n\nCrashing crescendo. Horns, keyboards, drums, guitars, piano.\n\n\"I write the sooooooonnnnnnnnnngggggggggs!!!\"\n\nBarry pulls the mike away from his face in a flourishing finale. The voice still hangs in the air, powerful.\n\nBarry is bowing, but you can still hear \"soooonnnnnnnnnggggggggggs.\" Then you look around the stage.\n\nIt's one of the backup singing guys.\n\nAsimov Brings On A Series, Manilow Swings Into Jazz\n\nSource: https://web.archive.org/web/20151223024214/http://articles.philly.com/1988-03-07/news/26277899_1_isaac-asimov-limericks-swing-street\n\nPosted:\n\nBarry Manilow and science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov: What do they have in common? Except, perhaps, that both of them sing \"I Write the Songs\" (Manilow on stage, Asimov in the shower).\n\nTelevision, television, television, of course. Tonight, Manilow dips into jazz for the music special Barry Manilow: Big Fun on Swing Street! (Channel 10, 10 p.m.), while Asimov has co-created a new series, Probe (Channel 6, 9 p.m., Thursday nights at 8 after today).\n\nThe two-hour premiere of Probe demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of Asimov. The writer, who put together this series with Michael Wagner, is an endlessly clever polymath, author of literally hundreds of books ranging from novels considered to be science-fiction classics to nonfiction examinations of the Bible.\n\nAsimov is brilliantly facile, but in his fiction, characterization has never been his long suit. Accordingly, Probe features cardboard characters who, at their best, make braininess attractive.\n\nTonight's episode introduces us to Austin James, an endlessly clever polymath who also happens to be as good-looking as actor Parker Stevenson. Stevenson, best known on television as half of The Hardy Boys, crinkles his cute little eyes and expounds glibly on chemistry, biology and computer science - he's television's first sexy hacker.\n\nAustin James' secretary-assistant is Mickey Castle, who has been written as a ditsy doll. But as portrayed by Ashley Crow, Mickey becomes something more - a fully rounded comic creation: a curious, eccentric woman who just happens to fit the TV-series requirement of attractiveness.\n\nCrow's performance is the clear standout of tonight's show, which sets up the series' structure: Police are baffled by a murder, and call in science whiz Austin James. James applies his recondite know-how and, two hours later, the case is closed. There are fewer car crashes than in most such shows, and, because Asimov is involved, the solution to the crime involves amusing variations on basic scientific principles.\n\nAnd, oh yes, another of Asimov's passions: limericks. Probe is the only show on the air tonight that will feature three pretty good limericks.\n\nBarry Manilow: Big Fun on Swing Street! does not contain a single limerick, but it does include songs with lyrics by George Gershwin and Hoagy Carmichael, so the wordplay is even more impressive.\n\nThis hour-long special is the video version of Manilow's recent album Swing Street (Arista), the singer-pianist-arranger's extended homage to the swing jazz that he admires so much. As such, it's a welcome contrast to the treacly contemporary pop ballads that Manilow usually performs.\n\nTonight's show does without extraneous dialogue - no hokey comedy sketches, no fulsome introductions of the guest stars. Just one song after another, with extended showcases for performers ranging from saxophonist Gerry Mulligan to Kid Creole and the Coconuts.\n\nBecause Manilow is so generous with the time he offers his guests - Kid Creole (a.k.a. August Darnell) has never had such prime-time exposure for his subtle, witty pop music - Big Fun on Swing Street! is a pleasant way to spend an hour.\n\nBut will the fans that make up Manilow's core audience tune in? The Swing Street album didn't even crack the top 40 - a rarity for Manilow. Obviously, most of the same listeners who squeal when he sings \"I Write the Songs\" weren't interested in their hero's jazz obsession, which makes tonight's special a bit more of a commercial toss-up than usually would be the case with a middle-of-the-road sure bet such as Manilow.\n\nManilow Reprises Manilow\n\nSource: https://web.archive.org/web/20160103193844/http://articles.philly.com/1989-10-03/news/26117222_1_manilow-fans-reincarnation\n\nPosted:\n\nThe Beatles were simulated, recreated and emasculated on Broadway only after the group broke up.\n\nElvis' glitzy multimedia reincarnation hit Vegas and Atlantic City more than 10 years after the king's untimely demise.\n\nBut Barry Manilow, live and snappy as a beanpole with a lemon-mousse hairdo can be, cheerfully hosted his own artistic wake before an enthusiastic crowd at the Shubert Theater last night.\n\nManilow's \"On Broadway\" production, here for a four-night run, could well be titled Barrymania. Like Beatlemania, it's a loosely plotted career retrospective that places its subject's music in a light, biographical setting. Yet somehow, the less-than-earthshaking social significance of Manilow's career seemed unsuited for such a treatment.\n\nEarly on, Manilow made his first play for the sentiments of the fortyish crowd, crediting the show's inspiration to John F. Kennedy. Standing before a 25-panel slide projection of the Brooklyn Bridge, Manilow offered the bland Kennedy quote: \"We can't know where we're going until we know where we've been.\"\n\nTo paraphrase another popular former president: \"We have nothing to fear but schlock itself.\"\n\nThat awkward moment was par for the course as Manilow continually tried for an appeal that was generational but ended up simply generic.\n\nCasually striding through miniature classroom and backstage settings, Manilow mixed his simply constructed, easy-to-sing (even his most ardent fans ought to admit that Manilow's voice, though pleasant, is hardly powerful) tunes with tired, scripted patter.\n\n\"When I was 14,\" quipped Manilow, \"I thought if you looked up 'weirdo' in the dictionary, you'd find my picture.\"\n\nPlaying tirelessly on the sweet little geek image he's been using since 1974, Manilow titillated his adoring female fans. First, he'd play the wimp, then make his move musically, sacking the women away with limpid old ballads, including \"When Will I See You Again?\" and \"Mandy,\" accompanied by a sharp 10-piece band.\n\nIn an effort to show that he's grown hip and worldly with his middle-aged fans as they've turned the dial from Top 40 to adult contemporary, Manilow even dabbled in a bit of baby blue humor.\n\nOnly in the jazz tune \"Cloudburst,\" with his rapid-fire phrases tumbling over each other like dominoes, did Manilow break free of the show's overall malaise to seem fresh and involved.\n\nUnfortunately, however, the fans were there for stale romance and Manilow was happy to oblige. Rather than follow his more spirited instincts and branch out in lively style, Manilow chose to set his career on a bier.\n\nTaj Will Rock; Other Stars To Be Dimmer\n\nSource: http://articles.philly.com/1990-09-07/entertainment/25876666_1_headliners-mini-revue-mystery-of-edwin-drood\n\nPosted:\n\nConsidering that the casino-hotels did not exactly fill their showrooms with flashy, innovative entertainment during the last few months - a time of year when the gambling houses traditionally go all out to lure the waves of summer visitors to the shore - it would be unrealistic to expect much more during the fall/winter season.\n\nAnd so, with a couple of exceptions, entertainment prospects in Atlantic City for the next several months appear rather bleak.\n\nAs far as headliners go, one can generally look for the same names that have been popping up in the showrooms for the last several years. As things stand, the chief exception will be a number of acts due at the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort.\n\nThe Taj Mahal has taken advantage of its 5,000-seat Mark G. Etess Arena to bring in such rock-concert acts as Elton John, Santana, Chicago and James Taylor, and will continue to do so in the coming months. The Allman Brothers Band will appear Oct. 26, and while dates are not yet firmed up, scheduled to perform at the Taj Mahal in November are Fleetwood Mac, Little Richard and Basia.\n\nOtherwise, there will be a fair amount of production, specialty and concept shows in the showrooms.\n\nSet to debut on Monday, for instance, is From Broadway to the Boardwalk at the Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino. This is a series of shows that will spotlight performers who have had success in Broadway productions for three-week stints on a Monday-through-Thursday basis.\n\nLeslie Uggams, who has appeared in such shows as Anything Goes and Jerry's Girls, will kick off the series Monday and returns for the weeks of Sept. 17 and 24.\n\nUggams will be followed by Betty Buckley (Cats, Pippin, Mystery of Edwin Drood) the weeks of Oct. 1, 8 and 15; Theodore Bikel (Fiddler On the Roof, Zorba, The Sound of Music), the weeks of Oct. 22, 29 and Nov. 5, and Carol Lawrence (West Side Story and I Do, I Do), the weeks of Nov. 12, 19 and 26.\n\nThe Showboat Hotel & Casino, which had considerable success with a late- summer mini-revue, Summer Lightning, starring Clint Holmes, will unveil another small show titled Hooked On Music Monday. This one, which will continue through Nov. 24, will star singer Bobby Arvon and feature pop music favorites from the '50s through the '90s.\n\nEven the Sands Hotel Casino will take a break from its name-headliner policy when it presents the Moscow Ballet for an engagement that runs from Wednesday through Sept. 27. The Soviet troupe includes members of the famous Bolshoi and Kirov companies, and will present dances from many of the best- known ballets, including The Nutcracker, Sleeping Beauty and Swan Lake.\n\nWhat promises to be the biggest, glitziest production show to hit town in some time will arrive Sept. 25 when Barry Manilow Presents Copacabana opens at Caesars Atlantic City Hotel-Casino.\n\nWhile Manilow will not appear in the show, he is producing and directing it. According to Manilow, \"this will be a full-scale, Broadway-style musical, including spectacular sets, costuming, choreography and original songs.\"\n\nCaesars is obviously counting on the show to be around a long time, since it is scheduled for an indefinite run - meaning forever, if the patrons continue to show up.\n\nThere also is the promise of flash and glitz with Ziegfeld: A Night at the Follies, which will open Oct. 5 at Harrah's Marina Hotel Casino for a run through Dec. 16. Here, too, there is the promise of lavish costumes and spectacular dancing. This is a retooled version of a show that was presented in London, where it failed.\n\nHowever, Harrah's people say that the original show concentrated too much on the biographical aspects of theatrical producer Flo Ziegfeld's life - apparently not very interesting, despite his lavish showmanship - and less on the music and dancing.\n\nLooking way ahead to the Christmas holiday season, the Taj Mahal will present Moscow On Ice from Dec. 14 to 26. Yes, a family show.\n\nAs the year progresses toward its finale, there may be other announcements concerning fresh acts and possibly even new production shows, but for now, this is it.\n\nManilow Puts 'Copacabana' On A Stage\n\nSource: https://web.archive.org/web/20150921140530/http://articles.philly.com/1990-09-28/entertainment/25877569_1_bruce-sussman-jack-feldman-casino-show\n\nPosted:\n\nHer name was Lola; she was a showgirl.\n\nAnd so it was destined that she surface at the Copacabana, the hottest spot north of Havana, where music and passion are always the fashion.\n\nThere Lola met Tony, a struggling songwriter by day, a Copa bartender by night. It was love. Not quite at first sight, but it was love.\n\nThen along came Rico, a sleaze from Havana, who operated the Tropicana.\n\nAnd - well, you've no doubt heard all about this before. Barry Manilow, ''Copacabana,\" 1978 - Manilow's all-time biggest hit record. Now it's been turned into a Broadway-style musical, Barry Manilow Presents Copacabana, which opened this week at Caesars Hotel-Casino.\n\nManilow never expected to get such mileage out of \"Copacabana\" when he and collaborators Bruce Sussman and Jack Feldman wrote it.\n\n\"Clive (Davis, president of Arista Records) said it would never be a hit,\" Manilow said after Wednesday night's performance. \"And that guy can pick hits.\"\n\nSo no one's perfect.\n\nFour years ago, Manilow starred in a television movie based on the record. ''I played Tony and got shot at the end,\" he noted. \"The critics loved that.\"\n\nIt's true, Manilow has been generally clobbered by the critics for many years. He is adored only by a large portion of the public.\n\nIt should be noted that Manilow is producer and director of Barry Manilow Presents Copacabana, but does not appear in it. It should also be pointed out that for this production, the story has been expanded and changed here and there. The tragic ending of the original song is gone.\n\n\"The casino people want happy endings,\" Manilow said. Happy people are more inclined to leave the showroom and head straight for the gambling area.\n\nIt should also be stressed that what Manilow and partners Sussman and Feldman have created is a unique show, the likes of which Atlantic City hasn't seen since the casino industry moved in. It is the debut of a Broadway-style musical, complete with book and original music, the bulk of it created for this show.\n\nContrary to speculation, Manilow says he has no plans to take it to Broadway, though he conceded that a road tour was not out of the question. For now, Caesars' aim is to keep Barry Manilow Presents Copacabana indefinitely - forever, if warranted by audience response.\n\nManilow, for one, is realistic about his show. He regards it as risky: ''It's neither a Broadway show nor a casino show.\"\n\nWell, it's a casino show now, and by Atlantic City standards, a highly innovative and entertaining show. And, aside from the book concept and original music by a commercially successful songwriting team - not to mention its association with a major pop music star - this really is a casino show when you get down to the basic ingredients of those big, lavish Las Vegas- style revues.\n\nThere is the bevy of showgirls, for instance, though the flesh-and-feathers concept is played down. And there is glitz. Plenty of glitz. The costuming is exotic, the sets are effective.\n\nThe story is silly, of course, but that has never gotten in the way of a Broadway musical. And the dialogue - well, consider a bit of it.\n\nAt one point, Tony the songwriter (played by Sean Sullivan) sits at the piano and breaks into \"I Write the Songs\" (cute, right?). The club owner responds with, \"That song will be a hit when man walks on the moon. Take a little constructive criticism, kid, you make me puke.\"\n\nAs to that man-on-the-moon line, understand that all this takes place shortly after World War II.\n\nThe song is expanded on when Lola (played with due spunk by Hillary Turk) is whisked off to Havana after Rico spikes her champagne. There she is to be the reluctant star of his Tropicana revue. However, she receives support from Rico's longtime abused mistress, Conchita (played with exaggerated flair by Kay Freeman). And, of course, Tony hops on the first plane out of New York for Havana after hearing of the dastardly deed.\n\nGetting back to the song, we have the shootout. Returning to the revised plot, there is a bizarre escape from Havana.\n\nWhat makes Barry Manilow Presents Copacabana work is the energy of the cast, the flash of the production and the variety of music created by Manilow and company. We have mellow ballads, upbeat dance routines, spicy Latin routines, even a sultry bolero.\n\nGreat musical theater this is not. But when it comes to knowing what works with the masses, it's hard to top Manilow's instincts, and everyone involved must be commended for attempting something fresh and different in Atlantic City.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nBarry Manilow Presents Copacabana is being presented in the Circus Maximus Theater at Caesars Hotel-Casino, Arkansas Avenue and the Boardwalk.

Though Manilow doesn't perform in it, he's listed as producer, director, composer and co- writer. Sure, he had help with those, the book, the lyrics, staging, choreography, sets and just about everything else that goes into a musical, but you can tell that the man who gave us \"I Can't Smile Without You,\" and ''I Write the Songs\" was passionately involved.\n\nIn remarks at a reception after last night's performance, Manilow said he'd be happy if what he calls a \"hybrid of a glitzy casino show and a Broadway book show\" would hang around Caesars in Atlantic City for two years or so, maybe taking off for Las Vegas and other gambling meccas. Before taking this show, based on his gassy hit ballad of some years back, to Broadway, Manilow said, he'd have to expand it, open it up, make it something \"more than what it is.\"\n\nThe musical opens with a dimpled, wholesome, clean-cut songwriter, Sean Sullivan, who was cast not only for his looks, but for his ability to sing almost, but not quite, like Manilow himself. He's in the midst of artistic passion: plonking out what will be the melody of Manilow's Copacabana song on an electric keyboard, with a drum synthesizer behind him.\n\n\"What rhymes with Copacabana?\" he asks whimsically. \"Banana, Ivana - no, she's got enough troubles already.\"\n\nThe songwriter then dreams up Lola (Hillary Turk), who appears as a determined actress fresh off the bus in big, bad Manhattan. The opening number, \"I've Just Arrived,\" is a perfect copy of similarly rousing New York-here-I-am songs that have been the staple of Broadway show business musicals from \"42nd Street\" to \"A Chorus Line.\" This number is so good, in fact, it's hard to believe it's downhill from here.\n\nThe songwriter casts himself in his fantasy as Tony Starr, a singer/ songwriter tending bar at New York's legendary Copacabana nightclub during the early 1950s. He and Lola meet when she auditions at the club and they fall in love. Lola gets a job as a showgirl but is kidnapped to Cuba by the nasty Rico Costelli (Lou DeMeis), a Cuban thug who owns Havana's famed Tropicana club. Tony and Sam Silver (Ronn Munro), the cynical owner of the Copacabana, take off to rescue the helpless lass.\n\n\"Barry Manilow Presents Copacabana\" has a plot, stars who can really sing, interesting dance numbers, dramatic staging and two flawless, easy- listening shlock-pop love ballads that are so . . . so MANILOW that they just might make Andrew Lloyd Webber jealous. You can imagine \"You Were Always in My Dreams\" and the bouncy \"Sweet Heaven, I'm in Love Again\" oozing out of elevators - they are perfect musical-comedy show-stoppers.\n\nWhat makes the show a letdown is that its plot and characters are just tired old cliches: the plucky young hero, the innocent girl in the big city, the crusty nightclub owner, the suave villain and the Spanish spitfire, in this case, a Carmen Miranda-type singer at the Tropicana, played by Kay Freeman.\n\nWhich is sad, because Manilow HAS written some of the songs the world sings, and if anybody can beat Andrew Lloyd Webber at his own formula, he can.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\n\"Barry Manilow Presents Copacabana\" plays the Circus Maximus showroom, Caesars Atlantic City, Arkansas Avenue and the Boardwalk, for an unlimited run. Showtimes are 8:30 p.m. Tuesday-Thursday; 8:30 and 11:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday; and 5:30 and 8:30 p.m. Sunday. Tickets are $17.50, available from the Box Office and Ticketmaster. 800-677-7469.\n\nManilow: Show Tunes And His Own\n\nSource: https://web.archive.org/web/20151223075847/http://articles.philly.com/1992-05-04/news/26014007_1_show-tunes-barbershop-quartet-barry-manilow\n\nPosted:\n\nHe is definitely not hip. Never has been. Never will be.\n\nAs a singer he'll never touch Sinatra, Bennett or Torme. And songwriters Andrew Lloyd Webber and Stephen Sondheim certainly don't have to regard him as major competition.\n\nBut don't underestimate Barry Manilow. He raised the curtain Friday night at the Mark G. Etess Arena in Atlantic City for two evenings of ''Showstoppers,\" a revue of seldom-heard show tunes and his own radically reworked songs.\n\nEngaging and sincere - all charm, no smarm - Manilow paid homage to the golden age of pop and vaudeville. \"Where or When\" allowed him to claim the songs of Rodgers and Hart as the model for his own \"ridiculously big\" musical endings. \"I didn't invent it;, I just borrowed it,\" he said.\n\nManilow, who has long dreamed of writing a show for Broadway, performed a long medley using the conceit \"What if my songs had come from great Broadway musicals?\"\n\nThe conceit worked. \"Trying To Get the Feeling\" done in Gershwin's languorous style, an exuberant \"It's a Miracle\" as it might have been plucked from The Music Man, and \"Mandy\" as performed by a barbershop quartet, showed that Manilow - when free to take chances - could strip the saccharine from his material and render his songs in ways that are deeply moving, exuberantly joyful and hilariously funny.\n\nManilow may not have soul. But in the tradition of the Great White Way, he's got a lot of heart.\n\nWhere Chubby Checker Plucked Chickens, Elvis Got Pelted With Eggs, Springsteen Met Manilow, And Other High Points Of Philly's Musical History.\n\nSource: https://web.archive.org/web/20160325162131/http://articles.philly.com/1992-09-18/news/26021555_1_sam-cooke-movie-house-streets\n\nPosted:\n\n1. Former home of Douglass \"Jocko\" Henderson, Emlen Street near Lincoln Drive, Germantown. One night in 1957, the legendary disc jockey was awakened by the doorbell. It was Sam Cooke, a 22-year-old gospel singer, and his manager, Bumps Blackwell, pushing Cooke's new single, \"You Send Me.\" As a result of the encounter, Henderson played the record and put Cooke on a show at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.

Since he led a group of disgruntled animators in a defection from the Disney studio in 1979, Bluth has enjoyed a mix of huge successes (An American Tail, The Land Before Time) and lesser achievements (Rock-a-Doodle, All Dogs Go to Heaven).\n\nThumbelina finds Bluth and the talented team of animators at the top of their game. The film has a charm, vivacity and good humor that remind us that Bluth remains the only serious competition for Disney in animated features for children. In Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast, the Disney artists have admittedly set standards that are hard for anyone else to approach, but Thumbelina will do very nicely until The Lion King comes along this summer.\n\nComedy and music, always Bluth's strong points, propel this version of Thumbelina. Like the Disney animators, Bluth likes to intersperse big set- piece numbers. The dancing frogs and beetles at the Beetle Ball in Thumbelina do not eclipse the likes of \"Be Our Guest\" from Beauty and the Beast and \"Under the Sea\" from The Little Mermaid, but they show the same flair for fusing image to rhythm.\n\nIn its recent much-acclaimed offerings, Disney has expanded the audience for animation far beyond the young. With Barry Manilow contributing key songs (in collaboration with Jack Feldman and Bruce Sussman), Bluth is obviously trying the same approach.\n\nTo prove that this is literally a small world, the voice of Thumbelina, the heroine no bigger than your thumb, is provided by Jodi Benson, who was Ariel in The Little Mermaid. Thumbelina is the gift of a kindly witch to a woman who yearns for a daughter. Vertically challenged and a victim of rampant size-ism, Thumbelina dreams of meeting someone of her own proportions.\n\nWhen a fairy prince answers her prayers, she is immediately smitten - only to be kidnapped by a devious toad. The path to Thumbelina's reunion with her love is filled with peril and propositions. The pace rarely lags and the subtext that Bluth always includes in his work is cleverly entwined with the adventures.\n\nLike all good storytellers in this field, Bluth excels at guiding children with a subtlety and finesse that ensures they do not realize they've just learned something worthwhile. Thumbelina is, despite its theme, no small feat and represents his best work since An American Tail and the under-rated The Secret of NIMH.\n\nHANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN'S THUMBELINA * * *\n\nProduced by Don Bluth, Gary Goldman and John Pomeroy; directed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman; written by Don Bluth; songs by Barry Manilow, Jack Feldman and Bruce Sussman; distributed by Warner Brothers.

Aimed squarely at the preschool set, this latest cartoon feature from Don Bluth (\"An American Tale,\"\"The Land Before Time\") has its magical moments, but nowhere near the sustained entertainment majesty of recent Disney efforts.\n\nSome offensive ethnic stereotypes and a less-than-enlightened visual coding system (attractive is good, the opposite is bad) are about the only reasons to keep your tots away from this richly colorful, tuneful time-killer.\n\nHowever, the combined, adult-toxic elements of one-dimensional storytelling, Barry Manilow's relentlessly puerile music and overdosage of underdeveloped cuddle-creatures, could make it play more like living death for viewers older than 8.\n\nToo bad, since Bluth does make the best-looking movies outside of his former employer Disney's kingdom. But he simply cannot dig the deeper psychological elements or contemporary resonances out of Andersen's fable the way team Disney did with the author's \"Little Mermaid.\" All Bluth and his co-director Gary Goldman can glean from the material are platitudinous instructions to find your place in the world and follow your heart.\n\nWhich your tinier tots should surely be able to relate to, seeing as how our heroine, though sprung to life full grown, is all of two inches high. Thumbelina, voiced expertly by the Little Mermaid herself, Jodi Benson, longs for someone her own size to love - and without much fuss, is found by fairy Prince Cornelius (Gary Imhoff) in no time.\n\nBut all this first-sight stuff is jeopardized when she is kidnapped by some Latino vaudeville toads (no offense intended, I think; it's just an excuse for a Charo production number). Though she escapes their warty grasp, Thumby has to find her way home through the gigantic, threatening world, or at least get found by Cornelius.\n\nAlso on the program: the big-screen debut of Steven Spielberg's popular, TV cartoon characters The Animaniacs, in the short film \"I'm Mad!\"\n\nTHUMBELINA * *\n\nDirected by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, produced by Don Bluth, Gary Goldman and John Pomeroy, written by Don Bluth, songs by Barry Manilow, Jack Feldman and Bruce Sussman; musical score by William Ross and Barry Manilow, distributed by Warner Bros.\n\nRunning Time: 85 minutes\n\nJacquimo - Gino Conforti\n\nMother - Barbara Cook\n\nThumbelina - Jodi Benson\n\nHero - Will Ryan\n\nQueen Tabitha - June Foray\n\nMrs. Toad - Charo\n\nMr. Beetle - Gilbert Gottfried\n\nMs. Fieldmouse - Carol Channing\n\nMr. Mole - John Hurt\n\nParents Guide: G\n\nShowing at: Area theaters\n\nVeteran Stars Strike Gold In The Standards Barry Manilow Is Just One Singer Who, Finding New Hits Hard To Come By, Has Turned To The Old.\n\nSource: https://web.archive.org/web/20150922122843/http://articles.philly.com/1994-12-29/entertainment/25856572_1_beautiful-music-country-music-arista-records\n\nPosted:\n\nBarry Manilow looked at his future and turned to the past.\n\nAfter racking up almost 30 pop hits and becoming a major solo star in the process, Manilow now laughingly refers to himself as a \"boy singer,\" what vocalists were called back in the good old big-band days.\n\nManilow is one of a number of veteran pop and country artists - from Kenny Rogers to Dennis DeYoung of Styx - who are rejuvenating their careers by recording albums of pop standards. Manilow's gold-certified Singin' With the Big Bands features 15 songs at least 40 years old. He gets an authentic sound, too, working with the bands carrying on the names of Glenn Miller, Les Brown, the Dorsey brothers and others.\n\n\"I have only done one pop album in the last 10 years. While it had some nice songs on it, it just didn't make it,\" says Manilow, who has sold 50 million records since 1974. \"Now, I just want to make beautiful music and I really don't care whether it's pop or not. It's difficult to sell these pop songs the way I used to. Radio has changed so much.\"\n\nChanging radio has had a similar effect on Kenny Rogers. He reeled off more than 60 country hits between 1969 and 1984. But knowing when to fold 'em and when to hold 'em, as it were, Rogers recently severed his Nashville ties, signing with New York-based Atlantic Records and cutting Timepiece in Los Angeles. It features 12 pop classics overseen by hotshot producer David Foster, who worked on Natalie Cole's award-winning Unforgettable.\n\n\"I have always had a real passion for pop music, but until now, I've never had a reason or a vehicle to pursue it,\" says Rogers, who played all kinds of music while growing up in Houston. \"Country music has changed and it's virtually impossible for me to get airplay now. When I was hot, once scoring 18 consecutive Top 10 records, I said those that compete will, and those that can't will complain about it. I refuse to complain about it, so I just backed off and took another look at music.\"\n\nRogers plans to promote the album with what he calls an \"infomercial.\"''My greatest-hits album sold about 22 million copies because we took it to television and found out from our research that people who buy from a TV 1-800 number won't go into a record store,\" Rogers says. \"We found that people who like this kind of music are intimidated by contemporary music stores. You ask for someone like Frank Sinatra or Andy Williams and they send you back into the catacombs somewhere. People don't like being treated like a second-class citizen.\"\n\nThat's not to say Rogers won't allow his albums to be sold in music stores. But his TV sales concept seems to have some validity. Certainly, it worked for Manilow's big-band album.\n\nEarlier this year, Clive Davis, head of Arista Records, called a meeting to discuss promotion of Manilow's new album. \"He said this would be a challenge to promote, which was like waving a red flag in front of a bull,\" says Tom Ennis, a vice president for product management at Arista, Manilow's home since 1974. \"The odds were stacked against us, but we felt if we could get people to hear it they would like it. We thought television would be a way to reach people who would understand the album. So, Barry has done a lot of television, morning shows and late night, and it's worked.\"\n\nEnnis says TV, particularly an HBO special, helped Arista promote Carly Simon's successful album of standards, My Romance, in 1990.\n\nAs for radio, Walter Powers, director of client services for Seattle's Broadcast Programming Inc., says that even many so-called adult contemporary stations are more interested in newer artists.\n\nHARD TO GET AIRPLAY\n\n\"We send products to over a thousand radio stations,\" Powers says, ''. . . and it's difficult for an artist like Barry Manilow, Kenny Rogers, Neil Diamond or Barbra Streisand, that old core of adult contemporary, to get any airplay.\"\n\nYet Powers predicts those artists could again be a major factor in radio. ''As the baby boomers move into that older demographic, those people could come back. Advertisers want that 24-to-54-year-old demographic. Once you turn 55, an advertiser says you fall off the face of the Earth. With this generation, a lot of the people moving into that age group are still interested in music.\"\n\nPowers says he would love to form a record label featuring what he calls ''dead artists\" (in the hit-making sense), and would try to promote the music of those still-active performers without the help of radio.\n\nOne way to avoid reluctant radio programmers is to have your own theater. Numerous artists have done that in Branson, Mo., the tourist mecca in the Ozarks that has more than 30 theaters featuring stars such as Mel Tillis, Charlie Pride and Bobby Vinton.\n\nThe Gatlin Brothers have a successful theater in Myrtle Beach, S.C. With 40 country hits to their credit, the singing siblings have released two successful albums of pop standards, Moments to Remember and Cool Water, recently packaged in a boxed set called Sincerely.\n\n\"We were approached by producer Jim Fogelsong, and he had this idea for a project of standards,\" says Steve Gatlin, who sings with brothers Rudy and Larry. \"We are known as a harmony group, and all the songs on the albums are by groups.\"\n\nSo, who is Steve trying to reach with this album?\n\nA TIME OF RADIO\n\n\"I'm not trying to reach a country fan, necessarily,\" Gatlin says. \"We want to reach people who grew up in a time when the radio was a bigger part of life and everybody knew the hits of the day. This is the music those people grew up on.\"\n\nGeorge Collier, general manager of Intersound Entertainment, which issued the Gatlin Brothers album and has a roster of senior artists such as Exile, Crystal Gayle and Dan Seals, says he can make money with those performers, even if their former larger labels opted to let them go.\n\n\"It's really easy, a no-brainer,\" Collier says. \"A major label wants a triple-platinum artist and they have to get that to afford all the people there. We don't have a lot of fat at this company. You don't have to pay a producer $50,000 to do an album. We pay a fair rate and we use top session players. But we set it up so that you get some money at the beginning, and, if the album sells, you get a lot more.\"\n\nCollier quickly and firmly points out that his artists aren't older. \"I call them established, and they are. These people all have had a lot of hits.\"\n\nIt's one thing to cut an album featuring the honeyed harmonies of the Gatlins or the smoothly professional singing of Rogers or Manilow. But Dennis DeYoung was a real live arena rock-and-roll star, selling 20 million records and scoring eight Top 10 singles, as lead singer of Styx. His new Atlantic album, 10 on Broadway, represents the antithesis of soaring rock anthems such as Styx's \"Come Sail Away\" or the wispy ballads \"Lady\" and \"Babe.\"\n\nBefore singing Broadway songs, DeYoung was on Broadway, playing Pontius Pilate in a touring revival of Jesus Christ Superstar, which played a few weeks in the Big Apple. \"When we were playing in Los Angeles, Danny Goldberg, of Atlantic Records, saw the show and asked me if I would be interested in doing a Broadway album,\" says DeYoung.\n\nDeYoung, who produced the 10-song album, says he had no interference from Atlantic when he opted to do songs such as \"Summertime,\"\"On the Street Where You Live\" and \"Someone to Watch Over Me.\"\n\n\"I decided to go at this almost like an 'unplugged' album,\" DeYoung says. ''We would start with a piano and then add just what was necessary to make the whole thing work. I had a pretty extensive knowledge of Broadway already. I looked at about 100 songs. I picked them for strong melodies.\"\n\nDeYoung says that about 50,000 copies of the Broadway album have been sold, hardly up to the standards of the platinum-plus Styx days, \"but that wasn't what we were trying to do. This was a breath of fresh air for me and a way to avoid catering to the music business. I know the company is still promoting the album, and we all knew it would take a while for it to catch on.\"\n\nWillie Nelson, who sold millions of his standard-studded Stardust album in 1978, has included some of his own standards on his new album, Healing Hands of Time. It has new versions of his classics, such as \"Crazy\" and \"Night Life,\" as well as \"I'll Be Seeing You\" and \"All the Things You Are.\"\n\nAsked about the success ratio of these kinds of albums, radio programmer Walter Powers says it's up to the record companies, \"and, right now, they are more interested in promoting young rock artists. . . . But when they realize a huge chunk of the population is getting older they may change. The minute it becomes OK to advertise to people over 50, you are going to see programmers clamoring to program to those people.\"\n\nAs for his future, Manilow says he wants to be careful about going back to the well too often. \"After really researching these songs, I realized there may be two albums, but probably not three. You know, the big-band era only lasted about eight years during the war and there are only so many good songs from those days.\"\n\nRogers can see himself as a country star again.\n\n\"I think the success of this album will dictate what we do next,\" Rogers says. \"A lot of things could happen in the next two years. I think country is destined to change. I looked at a Billboard not too long ago and 86 of the songs on their Top 100 country chart were by new artists and that will probably change. So country may be something for me again. But my heart is really into this album. This, I think, is a good record.\"\n\nA Special Devotion\n\nSource: https://web.archive.org/web/20151226220516/http://articles.philly.com/1999-08-11/news/25485216_1_manilow-music-manilow-tunes-copacabana\n\nPosted:\n\nBarry Manilow holds a special place in Tommy Hickman's heart.\n\nHickman, who is mentally retarded and suffers from mild cerebral palsy and epilepsy, was about 4 or 5 and struggling to speak when he started listening to his brother's Barry Manilow music.\n\n\"I was a big Barry Manilow fan,\" said Joe Hickman, Tommy's brother. Joe would bring Tommy into his bedroom and play Manilow music. And magic happened.\n\n\"It seemed to help him speak better than he was,\" said Joe, 41. Manilow tunes like \"It's a Miracle,\" and \"Could It Be Magic\" were big around that time, he said, and the family already enjoyed Manilow's music.\n\nJoe and the rest of the Hickman family didn't notice it at first, but \"all of a sudden [Tommy] starts picking up on stuff,\" he said. \"We said `Wow!'\"\n\nTommy started singing along with the music, family members said. He also drummed along with the music, which helped his motor skills. His speech therapist used Manilow music in Tommy's therapy.\n\nTommy Hickman will turn 29 on Aug. 11 and lives with his father Richard in Overbrook. He speaks slowly, but assertively. He's been to several Manilow shows - New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia. He attended a fan club convention in Kansas City, Kan.\n\n\"I like all of his music and he helped me,\" Hickman said of Manilow. \"My favorite song is `Copacabana.'\" Hickman is a member of the Barry Manilow International Fan Club. He has his own Web page (www.geocities.com/~adimike/tommy.html), where he pays tribute to Manilow and two other people, the late Flyers broadcaster Gene Hart and game show host Bob Barker.\n\nHickman met Manilow at a book signing, but nothing more than that. A couple of years ago the A&E network broadcast \"Barry Manilow: Live by Request,\" where viewers e-mailed song requests for Manilow to sing. Another brother, Adrian, 43, e-mailed the network on Tommy's behalf and his request was selected. Manilow dedicated \"I Made It Through the Rain\" to Tommy.\n\n\"That smile, I don't think we ever wiped it off,\" said Hickman's sister, Juliana Guaraldo, 36. Tommy's rendition of the song can also be heard by clicking his Web site.\n\nTommy Hickman comes from a close-knit Catholic family. Aside from brothers Adrian and Joe, there's another brother, Richard Jr., 50. One brother Jim, is deceased. All of the brothers except Tommy attended St. Thomas More. In fact, Tommy was named after the saint. His mother, Juliana, who kept the house filled with music (and had the unusual distinction of being a Catholic girl who sang in a synagogue), died two years ago.\n\nAs a youngster, Tommy attended the Developmental Disabilities Day Care Center at 60th and Master streets, said Guaraldo, who teaches special-needs children. He attended St. Katherine's Day School until he was 21.\n\nTommy bowls in the Special Olympics in the fall, and is involved in other programs for people with special needs. He helps his siblings around their houses when necessary.\n\nHe likes the Flyers - he knew the late Gene Hart - Elton John, the Bee Gees, 'N Sync, the Backstreet Boys and Will Smith.\n\n\"It's neat to see how he's grown,\" Guaraldo said. \"He has such a passion for [Manilow]. It's great to see Tommy come so far and be given the ability to have self-esteem.\"\n\nTommy and Adrian and at least one other guest will be going to Manilow's show at the Blockbuster-Sony E-Center on Aug. 26.\n\n\" `Even Now' is one of my all-time favorites,\" Tommy Hickman said. \"I want to tell him that. I want to meet this man so much.\"\n\nSend e-mail to huntera@phillynews.com\n\nWild About Barry He's Their Man The Devoted Followers Of Barry Manilow\n\nSource: https://web.archive.org/web/20151227022651/http://articles.philly.com/1999-08-11/news/25485768_1_manilow-concerts-barry-manilow-tanner\n\nPosted:\n\nDiana Beard figures she was, oh gosh, maybe 10 or 11 years old when she had her first encounter. She doesn't know exactly why she was drawn to him - maybe it was simply the music - but the impression has lasted.\n\nChristina Cotsifas was a \"young and impressionable\" sixth-grader. Tracy Miller was 11. Kellye Je anne Tanner says she was a mere baby, but still remembers the first time.\n\nBarry got them young.\n\nNow they've got Barry - on records, on videos, on photos, on T-shirts.\n\nBeard, Cotsifas, Miller and Tanner are all fans of Barry Alan Pincus, now known to the world as Barry Manilow, the definitive popular music shaper of the '70s.\n\nWhether through his on-stage persona, easy-to-relate-to lyrics, straight-for-the-heartstrings musical arrangements or apparent affection for charitable causes, Manilow has developed a strong following of fans, whose dedication can, in some ways, rival those who followed the Grateful Dead - without the drugs and tie-dyed shirts, of course.\n\nTalk of having attended more than 100 Manilow concerts is not unusual. Nor is talk of traveling from city to city to follow him. Stories of meeting Manilow at book signings or record signings, interviewing him via satellite and becoming a \"Can't Smile\" girl get uploaded on dozens of Web sites and printed in newsletters. Photos are swapped, tapes are traded, friendships are developed.\n\nThe Barry Manilow International Fan Club, which started in 1980, has about 10,000 members in 20 countries, according to a spokesman from Stiletto Enterprises, which runs the club. In the United States, there are at least 45 \"official\" Barry Manilow fan clubs, with names like \"Hot Tonight for Barry\" (Illinois), \"Barry's Little Rhodies\" (Rhode Island) and \"We Got the Feeling\" (Pennsylvania).\n\nOne perk members of an official local chapter get is the chance decorate Manilow's dressing room when he performs in or near their home town.\n\nBeard is a 34-year-old, pool-shooting graphic designer. She's founder and executive director of In the Key of B, a local fan club that has nearly 90 members, ranging in age from the 20s to 60s. They will decorate Manilow's dressing room when he comes to Camden's Blockbuster-Sony E-Center Aug. 26. The theme: Moonlight Serenade.\n\n\"People can relate to it,\" Beard said of Manilow's music, which focuses on \"everyday occurrences.\" She's been to more than 100 Manilow shows. On her red Jeep is a vanity license plate that reads, \"I Sang,\" which lets drivers in back of her know she sang on stage with Manilow. And, of course, she has lots of CDs, LPs, books and other Manilow paraphernalia in the house she shares with her fiance Michael (who's really into Randy Travis) and four cats (who are really into whatever their masters are into).\n\nChristina Cotsifas, 33, of Coatesville, is a computer tech support manager and member of In the Key of B. She's only been to 70 shows since 1978.\n\n\"It's not like he's a sex symbol or anything like that. I outgrew that in the teens,\" Cotsifas said. \"I like his genuineness, his ability to connect at the concert.\" Plus he writes \"great material,\" she said, material that goes beyond his pop paydays. \"A lot of people don't know he has a jazz album, a swing album,\" Cotsifas said. \"He put his all in it.\"\n\nBoth Beard and Cotsifas have climbed one of the highest peaks that any Manilow fan can conquer. They were \"Can't Smile\" girls. These are women Manilow chooses from the concert audience and brings on stage with him to sing his 1978 hit, \"Can't Smile Without You.\" When Manilow begins to whistle the song's introduction, wannabe \"Can't Smile\" girls can't hold back any longer. They throw up their snazzy signs and banners, flash their bright clothing or Manilow T-shirts, wave their hands, wish, hope and pray to get his attention.\n\nBeard's yellow posterboard sign with 14-inch letters that said \"Please\" caught Manilow's eye Jan. 29, 1989, at Atlantic City's Resorts International. Cotsifas' chance came in 1993 after 11 years of trying. It was Sept. 4, during Manilow's first show at Caesars in Atlantic City.\n\n\"I was halfway in the back, in the center and had a sign, but something told me that it was going to be my turn finally!\" she writes on the Manilow Web page where fans share their \"Can't Smile\" experiences. \"Barry was the best. So nice and calming and his eyes were so blue. . .\"\n\nThe \"Can't Smile\" performances are videotaped for the lucky singer. Photographs are no problem, because, unlike many other artists, Manilow allows them at his shows.\n\nIt would be too easy but not fair to classify all Manilow fans as obsessed, said Tanner. Yes, some fans have emptied checking and savings accounts and sold a possession just to get to a Manilow convention, she said. But \"the majority of us Barry fans do have lives,\" Tanner, an actor from Columbia, Md., wrote via e-mail. \"What would be acceptable for a 16-year-old wouldn't be of a 26-, 36- or 46-year-old.\"\n\nManilow's music, Tanner writes, is \"a nice part of our lives, that gives us much happiness and fits in with the other parts of our lives, career, friends, home, family, etc.\"\n\nThis strong connection Manilow has with his loyal audience doesn't save him from being the focus of disparaging words from those who haven't caught the Manilow magic.\n\nHis pop music has been called corny; mention his name and you'll most likely be greeted with a smirk, if not an all-out belly laugh. His popularity - he's had 25 Top 40 hits - and the era in which he reached that popularity, the long-haired, platform-shoe 1970s, make him a huge target for ridicule.\n\n\"It's more that a lot of people don't respect him as an artist,\" Cotsifas said \"They associate him with things like his hits from the '70s. But when you go to a concert, it's sold out. It's just not his [loyal] fans buying the tickets.\"\n\n\"I really don't understand that one myself,\" said Tanner, who first heard Manilow's song \"Amy\" as a baby. \"The things people say to me is `He's too saccharine, he's too sappy.'\"\n\nIndeed, fan club members get their share of grief from anti-Manilowites. It used to be worse in the past, Beard said. Some club members may strongly defend Manilow, but many take the high road: \"Everybody is entitled to their opinion,\" Beard says.\n\nThe same people who mock Manilow's music now probably had at least one of his records in their collection as a teen. Or at least they could sing one line of \"Copacabana\" or \"I Write the Songs.\"\n\nBut his fans don't worry about such problems. They just worry about Barry and meeting him and learning more about him.\n\nTracy Miller, 36, is founder and president of the We Got the Feeling, a 60-member chapter in North Apollo, near Pittsburgh. Her favorite record is \"Could It Be Magic,\" but her biggest thrill came in June, when she interviewed Manilow by satellite from TV station KDKA. \"I had eight minutes with him,\" she said. She could hear and see him (his hair was longer than it had been, and appeared colored a little), but he could only hear her.\n\nShe asked questions about his next CD, using a computer to compose, and how it feels to see people in the audience singing his songs. Some of the answers, she admits, she doesn't remember, being all caught up in the excitement of interviewing Manilow and concerned about what she would ask next.\n\nManilow's music \"gives you a little respite,\" said Miller, a wife and mother who works part time for a Web site. \"It gives you a little place to go and relax.\"\n\nManilow Mixes Music, Passion\n\nSource: https://web.archive.org/web/20151221205708/http://articles.philly.com/2000-10-26/news/25586464_1_bruce-sussman-copa-girls-jack-feldman\n\nPosted:\n\nBARRY MANILOW'S COPACABANA. Merriam Theater, 250 S. Broad St. Through Sunday. 8 tonight & tomorrow night; 2 & 8 p.m. Saturday; 2 & 7:30 p.m. Sunday. Tickets: $34.50-$39.50. Info: 215-732-5446.\n\nFYI to all you Barry Manilow fans out there: Contrary to the title, Mr. Music is not starring in \"Barry Manilow's Copacabana.\" Not physically, anyway.\n\n\"I did everything,\" Manilow said via phone from his Califonia home, when asked how much bang he got for his buck, having his name hand-stamped on the title like that.\n\n\"If I could have, I would have been painting the scenery,\" he quipped. \"I'm a hands-on kinda guy.\"\n\nTwenty-two years after the catchy little ditty \"Copacabana\" won Manilow his very first Grammy, the song-story of Rico and Lola has morphed into a full-blown musical with a Latin-themed score, including 19 new songs in addition to the title number.\n\nThe show opened last night at the Merriam Theater.\n\nWhen you think about it, a musical is probably the most likely evolution of a tune that has had past lives as a television movie and a Las Vegas revue-meets-Broadway-type casino show for Caesars in Atlantic City.\n\nManilow said this adaptation was the most taxing.\n\n\"Trying to make a three-minute song into a 21/2-hour play was the hardest,\" he admitted. \"We were OK expanding it into a movie, because there were only about three or four songs in it and they really weren't book songs, they were performance songs.\n\n\"When they asked us to write the casino version of it, that was harder, because we needed to write some book songs that moved the story along, not just songs that the Copa girls sang.\"\n\nManilow laughed. \"But when it came time to actually write a two-act musical with lots more characters, lots more story? That was really challenging. . .When you're trying to write a Broadway musical, you don't start like this.\"\n\nSince he was working with such a simple and well-known "
