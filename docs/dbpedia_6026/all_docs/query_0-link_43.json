        "text": "Remaking a much-loved and cult classic seems like a tricky path to choose in cinema and to a degree television drama: the film/programme you are making will often have a certain pre-existing recognition factor but that is also a double-edged sword as you are essentially pitting yourself against, well, the love of and for a cult classic.\n\nAlong which lines it is also a potentially odd and tricky thing for a director to do to attempt to make a semi ‚Äúin the spirit of‚Äù sequel to his own much-loved cult classic (see The Wicker Tree).\n\nAlong which lines, three such films and programmes which have been remade that I have previously written about at A Year In The Country are The Wicker Man, The Village of the Damned and Edge of Darkness.\n\nNow, although I thought it was an odd thing to do, to attempt to remake The Wicker Man, I tried to go into watching the 2006 version with an open mind and without being overly prejudiced against it ‚Äì as a cultural behemoth the original version of The Wicker Man casts a long and imposing shadow.\n\nIt‚Äôs a fair while ago since I watched the remake and despite my trepidation in watching it, one of the main things that struck me was rather than thinking it was inherently bad, that it was essentially just another film, almost workmanlike, in contrast to the fantastical/fantasia like multi-layered cultural and aesthetic aspects of the original.\n\n(The original film version of The Wicker Man‚Äôs troubled and intriguing production and release history has also come to be fairly inherently intertwined with those cultural aspects ‚Äì adding a further layering which makes it shadow all the longer and more imposing on any remake.)\n\nAll of which brings me to the 2010 film adaptation/remake of Edge of Darkness.\n\nIt seems like both a tricky and odd path for a director to remake his own much-loved, not so much cult but widely and critically acclaimed classic but that is what Martin Campbell did (he also directed the 1985 television original).\n\nFor myself the original of Edge of Darkness is so rooted in my psyche and also the time, place and historical context of when it was made that I think I am too wary to watch the remake removed from that context and to possibly dispel my appreciation of the original, even out of curiousity about what the remake is like.\n\nWhich brings me to John Carpenter‚Äôs 1995 adaptation of The Village of the Damned (originally adapted from John Wyndham‚Äôs novel The Midwich Cuckoos), here remade as Village of the Damned.\n\n(There was also a British made sequel to The Village of the Damned made in 1964 called Children of the Damned.)\n\nJohn Carpenter is known for holding British science fiction/fantasy writer Nigel Kneale in high regard (as I have mentioned before, in homage to Nigel Kneales‚Äôs Work, his Prince of Darkness film is credited to Martin Quatermass and he commissioned Kneale to work on the script for Halloween III which John Carpenter co-produced and co-scored) and it‚Äôs not much of a jump from Nigel Kneale‚Äôs intelligent take on British science fiction etc to John Wyndham‚Äôs.\n\n(Although not directed by the same person, the above still from Village of the Damned shares something of a similarity or two with the below still from Halloween III and both have a somewhat classic John Carpenter-esque ‚Äúempty/isolated streets‚Äù dread.)\n\nThe 1995 remake of Village of the Damned is an odd film texturally: it has the look and feel of a made-for-television movie, although it had a budget of $22 million (approximately $36 million today allowing for inflation), which is hardly small change.\n\nThat look and feel may be in part due to the period aesthetics of when it was made, related film stock and/or the DVD transfer process.\n\nIt could also possibly be a side effect of the way in which when viewed now 1990s and turn of the millennium film and television can have a sense of not yet being old enough to have gained a retro fetishistic aspect, more just still rooted to the period of its production and a little out of step with modern tastes and expectations.\n\nIn this remake the story is moved from the English countryside to a smallish Northern Californian American town.\n\nWhile the village in the 1960 version is peopled largely by the middle classes with terrribly good diction, alongside working class and labourer types, in John Carpenter‚Äôs version at the start the town seems to be largely populated by male hunks and styled female blondes.\n\nThe film also features a number of lead actors who previously starred in various well-known and market-leading science fiction/fantasy franchises (Mark Hamill ‚Äì Star Wars, Christopher Reeves ‚Äì Superman, Kirstie Alley ‚Äì Star Trek).\n\nThe government/authorities‚Äô response to essentially the town‚Äôs women being impregnated by a possibly alien race seems curiously unofficial/ramshackle ‚Äì particularly viewed today in an era of heightened security measures.\n\nHere the problem seems to be tackled by say the kind of grungey, underfunded, self-directed groups or organisations that would perhaps be found in David Cronenberg‚Äôs Videodrome.\n\nAs I have mentioned before sections of John Carpenter‚Äôs work, particularly his earlier films in the 1970s and during parts of the 1980s, contained a kind of ragged, tight, almost street energy to them, a possibly more fun, less arthouse parallel to David Cronenberg‚Äôs earlier films.\n\nThere is still some kind of left-of-centre cinema feel to this version of Village of the Damned and elements of that tighness or energy but it feels less focused or to not have quite the same energy of some of his other work:\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm really not passionate about Village of the Damned. I was getting rid of a contractual assignment, although I will say that it has a very good performance from Christopher Reeve, so there‚Äôs some value in it.‚Äù (John Carpenter in an interview at Vulture website.)\n\nPossibly that lack of a sense of lean example of cinema could also be a result of the translation and remaking of an earlier piece of work and the way in which during that process some of the original energy or ‚Äúmagic‚Äù, that indefinable something can sometimes be lost along the way.\n\nHowever, as I say, it‚Äôs a tricky proposition attempting to remake a much loved cult classic and the creators of the new version may well find themselves treading on what some may consider culturally hallowed ground. Taking on such a task could be considered something of a double edged sword in many ways; you have the pre-existing recognition factor and possibly proven appeal of the story etc of the earlier version but then there are also a whole host of expectations and comparing with its forebear to contend with.\n\nElsewhere:\n\nThe Wicker Man 1973 / The Wicker Man 2006\n\nEdge of Darkness 1985 / Edge of Darkness 2010\n\nThe Village of the Damned 1960 / Village of the Damned 1995\n\nJohn Carpenter at the Vulture website\n\nElsewhere at A Year In The Country:\n\n1) Day #173/365: ‚ÄúDouglas I‚Äôm scared‚Äù; celluloid cuckoos and the village as anything but idyll‚Ä¶\n\n2) Wanderings, Explorations and Signposts 4/52a: Halloween III: Season of the Witch ‚Äì A Curious Slice of Culture and Collisions with the Past\n\n3) Wanderings, Explorations and Signposts 22/52: John Carpenter‚Äôs Prince of Darkness Part 1 ‚Äì The Sleeper Awakens4) Wanderings, Explorations and Signposts 23/52: John Carpenter‚Äôs Prince of Darkness Part 2 ‚Äì ‚ÄúThis is not a dream‚Äù5) Wanderings, Explorations and Signposts 24/52: John Carpenter‚Äôs Prince of Darkness Part 3 ‚Äì Quatermass-esque Non Bebop Filmmaking\n\n6) Wanderings, Explorations and Signposts 8/52: In The Morning I‚Äôll Be Gone, Orkney Twilight, GB84 and Edge of Darkness ‚Äì Hinterland Tales Of Myths, Dark Forces and Hidden Histories Part 2\n\n7) The Wicker Man: well, that would be in a fair few ‚ÄúElsewhere at A Year In The Country‚Äù\n\nThe CDs are now sold out but the album is available to download at our Bandcamp page, Amazon, The Tidal Store, 7digital etc and can be streamed on Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, YouTube etc.\n\nPreorder today 10th July 2018.

Otherworldly or conjurings are words that also come to mind.\n\nReference points for the soundtrack?\n\nWell, they may include the likes of Cat‚Äôs Eyes pastoral fantasia soundtrack for The Duke of Burgundy or the also fantasia like soundtrack to Valerie and Her Week of Wonders, the melodic conjurings of Jane Weaver‚Äôs Parade of Blood Red Sorrows and maybe the soundtrack for some semi-forgotten supernatural tinged Italian giallo (along which lines, I could also mention Kelli Ali‚Äôs The Kiss, which has not dissimilar semi-forgotten soundtrack qualities).\n\nOther possible references points?\n\nThe also pastoral wanderings and wordless vocalisations of Sharron Kraus‚Äô Pilgrim Chants & Pastoral Trails, which connects back to Part 1 of this post as in that I mentioned how Peter Anderson Studio created the intro sequence for Requiem and also designed the artwork for this particular Sharron Kraus album.\n\nIn Part 1 of this post I also mention how the Peter Anderson Studio work for requiem has:\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶a certain classy texturality, the lineage of which could be traced back to the likes of Vaughan Oliver and Nigel Grierson‚Äôs work for 4AD in the 1980s‚Äù.\n\nWhich for myself brings me to some other possible reference points for The Requiem soundtrack: it puts me in mind of something pleasingly leftfield that you might have found on say 4AD or Mute in the 1980s.\n\nPossibly in some way the accessible, melodic experimentalism of Holger Hiller on the album Obem im Eck/the track Waltz or the more experimentally arthouse, atmospheric side of gothic tinged (but not actually goth) work such as some of Dead Can Dance and Lisa Gerrard‚Äôs work, in particular The Host of Seraphim from 1988‚Äôs The Serpent‚Äôs Egg.\n\nAs with some of Dead Can Dance‚Äôs work, the soundtrack for Requiem also here and there brings to mind a sense of reimagined medieval aesthetics ‚Äì although less overtly and with a more contemporary edge than Dead Can Dance‚Äôs work, which also often has a more epic, almost glacial quality or distance to it, in contrast to the Requiem soundtrack which as mentioned earlier has a warmer more intimate character.\n\nThe title‚Äôs to Requiem‚Äôs soundtrack‚Äôs tracks are composed of generally short non-words including Aigra, Naaa, Rgoan, Lsraph and Omsia. I can‚Äôt bring a particular album to mind but these titles also seem to remind me of some similarly titled left-of-centre work that travels in not too dissimilar terrain from the 1980s.\n\nOr moving slightly further along in time on 4AD, His Name is Alive‚Äôs Livonia album from 1990 could also be a reference point for the Requiem soundtrack, particularly the opening track As We Could Ever, which shares with Requiem‚Äôs soundtrack a sense of otherworldly, female vocaled conjuring.\n\n(As an aside, although all possessing their own character, a number of the track‚Äôs/music mentioned in this post ‚Äì Jane Weaver‚Äôs Parade of Blood Red Sorrows, Kelli Ali‚Äôs The Kiss and Sharron Kraus‚Äô Pilgrim Chants & Pastoral Trails, Dead Can Dance‚Äôs Host of Seraphim and the Requiem Soundtrack itself ‚Äì share a similarity in featuring female wordless vocals.)\n\nAnd talking of otherworldy, as with the Peter Andersen Studio work for Requiem, the album cover art for Livonia and the insert for The Serpent‚Äôs Egg contain otherworldly, almost spectral aesthetics and a certain texturality in regards to pastoral inflected work ‚Äì all of which reflects the rural setting and super or preternatural themes of the episodes of Requiem.\n\nAs a further reference point, in some way the soundtrack to Requiem also put me in mind of the loose cultural/musical grouping that David Keenan has called England‚Äôs Hidden Reverse ‚Äì the post-industrial likes of Coil, Current 93 and Nurse With Wound.\n\nIn Requiem the music is a soundtrack to, rather than a hidden reverse, more a layered, super or preternatural world and related conspiracies/machinations.\n\nAs with Requiem, sections of Coil‚Äôs work and the neo-folk aspects of Current 93 also bring to mind and/or explore a flipside or unsettled undercurrents of rurality/the pastoral.\n\nWith regards to Current 93, that aspect is also highlighted due to founder David Tibet‚Äôs championing and releasing of Shirley Collins‚Äô music, who in recent years appears to have been situated/to have come to situate herself amongst and work alongside a sense of ‚Äúwyrd‚Äù Albion and has been called ‚ÄúThe High Queene of English Folk‚Äù in promotional material for the documentary The Ballad of Shirley Collins.\n\nHer connection to England‚Äôs Hidden reverse is also made more implicit due to her recording with Stephen Thrower and Ossian Brown of Cyclobe, who have also worked with Coil.\n\nAnyways, returning more directly to Requiem:\n\nMusic is also an inherent part of the plot of Requiem as the main character is a famous, stylish young cellist and her partner in her attempts to uncover the truth behind the machinations she discovers is her onstage musical partner and accompanying pianist.\n\nAs part of their investigations they discover in a hidden basement recordings of haunting music, which appears to have been created and used for ritualistic purposes ‚Äì something that, albeit for somewhat different reasons than those presented in Reqiuem, sections of England‚Äôs Hidden Reverse and Coil in particular have been known to do or state that their music is intended for.\n\nPartly because of the time in which they were created these recordings which are discovered in Requiem were made on reel-to-reel cassettes.\n\nIn the supernatural context of the series, the media on which they are recorded seems to have an inherently more spooked or spectral nature to it than say a digital recording might have, although my view of such things is possibly partly influenced by the hauntological inflections which have come to be attached to physical and period analogue media and also their use and intrinsic presence in the likes of The Stone Tape and Berberian Sound Studio.\n\nAs an aside, returning to listen to sections of the soundtrack to Berberian Sound Studio, the melodic, spectral, entrancing, female vocaled otherworldly nature of some of Requiem‚Äôs Soundtrack shares some similar territory with Broadcast‚Äôs soundtrack for Peter Strickland‚Äôs film.\n\nWhile in a further intertwined manner Andrew Liles who has worked with both Current 93 and Nurse With Wound reworked the sound design of Berberian Sound Studio for a record release titled The Equestrian Vortex, which is the name of the film-within-a-film in Berberian Sound Studio.\n\nAnd talking of physical and digital releases of music and other culture, as mentioned in Part 1 of this post, the Requiem soundtrack is only available digitally to download or stream but I chose to purchase the album as a download.\n\n(The series itself is also only available in high-definition online/as a download, something which I discuss further in Part 1 of this post. Also, as far as I know, it is only available as a 192 kbps download, which is essentially a compressed, lossy file format and so although consciously I can‚Äôt hear the parts that have been trimmed away, semi-consciously I wander what parts of the music is missing ‚Äì see ‚ÄúThe Ghost In The MP3 and considerations of past/future loss‚Äù below.)\n\nDespite the convenience and instant access to millions upon millions of songs that streaming can offer, in terms of just sitting down to appreciate and experience an album, in an almost modern-day sacramental manner, downloads possibly offer a more distilled and undisturbed experience in the way that a physical CD or record can ‚Äì there isn‚Äôt the hurried, slightly harried sense of ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next? What else can I listen to?‚Äù that the almost unlimited nature of streaming offers.\n\n(Not too dissimilar could also be said of the streaming of films and television and the sometimes overwhelming selection of available titles, in contrast to say just downloading one particular title and that being the one which you focus on and watch.)\n\nHaving just one album to listen to, in a self-curated manner, seems to offer a moment of repose in a rather busy contemporary cultural and digital landscape.\n\nElsewhere:\n\nAigra ‚Äì Requiem‚Äôs main title theme\n\nThe Requiem trailer\n\nThe Requiem title sequence by Peter Anderson Studio\n\nMore on Dominik Scherrer and Natasha Khan‚Äôs score\n\nThe Stone Tape and the Capturing of Resonances\n\nBerberian Sound Studio / Requiem musical intertwining\n\nJane Weaver‚Äôs Parade of Blood Red Sorrows\n\nKelli Ali‚Äôs The Kiss\n\nElsewhere at A Year In The Country:\n\n1) Day #23/365: Nigel Kneale‚Äôs The Stone Tape ‚Äì a study of future haunted media\n\n2) Day #153/365: Stepping through into‚Ä¶ Berberian Sound Studio\n\n3) Day #327/365: A fever dream of Haunted Air‚Ä¶\n\n4) Day #349/365: Audiological Reflections and Pathways #2; the semi-random placing of England‚Äôs hidden reverse‚Ä¶\n\n5) Week #12/52: The Ghost In The MP3 and considerations of past/future loss\n\n6) Audio Visual Transmission Guide #19/52a: The Ballad Of Shirley Collins Trailer and Wandering Amongst Shadowed Furrows/The Hidden Reverse\n\n7) Day #58/365: Lullabies for the land and a pastoral magicbox by Ms Sharron Kraus\n\n8) Day #150/365: Parade Of Blood Red Sorrows\n\n9) Week #1/52: The Duke Of Burgundy and Mesmerisation‚Ä¶\n\n10) Audio Visual Transmission Guide #28/52a: Valerie And Her Week Of Wonders ‚Äì Unreleased Variations Away From Bricks And Mortar\n\n11) Audio Visual Transmission Guide #48/52a: Kelli Ali‚Äôs The Kiss and Cinematic Conjurings\n\n12) Wanderings, Explorations and Signposts 26/52: Requiem Part 2 ‚Äì Sidestepping Modern Methods, Curiously Banal Infrastructure and Other Considerations\n\n13) Wanderings, Explorations and Signposts 25/52: Requiem Part 1 ‚Äì Further Glimpses of Albion in the Overgrowth and Related Considerations14) Wanderings, Explorations and Signposts 26/52: Requiem Part 2 ‚Äì Sidestepping Modern Methods, Curiously Banal Infrastructure and Other Considerations\n\nContinuing on from Part 1 of this post, a few further points about the television series Requiem:\n\n1) As has been a recurring trope in cinema and television, it presents rurally based communities in contrast with urban ones as insular or ‚Äúother‚Äù, to have their own ways and beliefs that connect back to previous eras, in a not dissimilar manner to say Hot Fuzz and The Wicker Man.\n\n2) Talking of The Wicker Man, without wishing to give too much of the ending of Requiem away, as in The Wicker Man, here the outsider victim is essentially lead on a misleading merry dance by the rural folk in pursuance of their beliefs and practices and for the correct completion of their ritual the chosen one must come willingly.\n\n3) As is often the case with modern drama, Requiem sidesteps or ignores some of the realities of modern life, communications, the dissemination of news, images etc: here a strikingly stylish famous musician whose mother has died in bizarre circumstances is able to go and raise merry heck in a community and rake up all kinds of semi-buried truths in a very public manner, with only one apparent instance of a reporter and a traditional newspaper headline and little or no recordings of her actions digitally by the public nor social media postings.\n\nThe truth is likely that in such an instance today her actions would be recorded and/or posted about and spread widely online within minutes of them happening.\n\nIt must be difficult as a scriptwriter to get around the ‚Äúwell, the characters are trapped and threatened by forces x, y and z but with just one mobile phone call they could summon help‚Äù aspect of modern life.\n\nPossibly hence a fair bit of character‚Äôs in modern dramas holding up mobile phones and saying ‚ÄúNo, no signal‚Äù, having left them at home, dropping them etc.\n\n4) Largely in Requiem supernatural elements are seen in only very fleeting glimpses or represented via audio but at one point a form of spirit or demonic possession is shown as having not dissimilar characteristics as electrical charges and discharges.\n\nWhich caused me to wander how do you represent the supernatural on film and in television? What is the possible literal physical manifestation of such things? Are they/should they be all otherworldly spectral or ectoplasmic apparitions? Do they have a connection to and/or have the characteristics of other real world, natural and/or scientific phenomenon?\n\n(See John Carpenter‚Äôs Prince of Darkness for a further consideration of the commingling of science and the supernatural, also for sharing with Requiem a depiction of mirrors as portals through which the super or preternatural can attempt to enter the day-to-day world.)\n\n5) Aside from the above electric like possession, there is only one other overt special effects orientated visual expression of the supernatural, which leaves space for the viewer‚Äôs imagination.\n\nThat other overt expression is when one of the character‚Äôs has been possessed and in order to show this her eyes flip to opaque black for just a moment.\n\nSuch elements are tricky as once you have overtly shown the supernatural it can normalise it or seem a little obvious or too signposted as ‚Äúthis person is now bad‚Äù.\n\n6) In Requiem the ‚Äúgood‚Äù, respectable people of the rural community who are actually up to no good appear to be largely the relatively affluent middle class and above; the local ‚Äúcoven‚Äù is made up in part by a doctor/psychiatrist, a solicitor, a mildly bohemian antiques dealer and an owner of large rural estate. They appear to have their more working class or lower in class footsoldiers but they are more the lead than the leading.\n\n7) A pivotal character in the plot, although one without a large amount of screen time, is that mildly bohemian antiques dealer, who is played by Tara Fitzgerald and seems to have an almost smugly evil aspect to her character.\n\nThat character puts me in mind in part as a form of occult middle manager with a sense of self-satisifying expectation.\n\n(This put me in mind of Sean Hogan‚Äôs 2011 film The Devil‚Äôs Business, which explores some similar themes as Ben Wheatley‚Äôs Kill List; two assassins or mercenaries find themselves embroiled in occult activities, the carrying out of which in both have a curiously banal infrastructure and management aspect.)\n\n8) The main character Matilda Gray in the series is played by Lydia Wilson, who here has a very striking and almost otherworldly ‚ÄúWoman Who Fell to Earth‚Äù aspect to her appearance, which looking back over the series could be seen as a reflection of the hidden, preternatural forces which are present around and also even contained within her.\n\nAlthough in a more overtly fashionable, almost hipster way in Reqiuem, that otherworldly aspect of the appearance of a disturbed individual can also be found in Angela Pleasance‚Äôs physical appearance and screen presence in Jos√© Ram√≥n Larraz‚Äôs 1974 film Symptoms, which as with Requiem, also depicts rural areas as being far removed from bucolic idylls.\n\nElsewhere:\n\nThe Requiem trailer\n\nThe Requiem title sequence by Peter Anderson Studio\n\nThe Symptoms trailer via the BFI\n\nElsewhere at A Year In The Country:\n\n1) Week #28/52: Symptoms and gothic bucolia\n\n2) Wanderings, Explorations and Signposts 22/52: John Carpenter‚Äôs Prince of Darkness Part 1 ‚Äì The Sleeper Awakens\n\n3) Wanderings, Explorations and Signposts 23/52: John Carpenter‚Äôs Prince of Darkness Part 2 ‚Äì ‚ÄúThis is not a dream‚Äù\n\n4) Wanderings, Explorations and Signposts 24/52: John Carpenter‚Äôs Prince of Darkness Part 3 ‚Äì Quatermass-esque Non Bebop Filmmaking\n\n5) Wanderings, Explorations and Signposts 25/52: Requiem Part 1 ‚Äì Further Glimpses of Albion in the Overgrowth and Related Considerations\n\nArcadia was something of a treat to arrive through the old digital letterbox a while ago.\n\nIt is a film directed by Paul Wright which was created from a collage of found images, with a soundtrack by Adrian Utley from Portishead and Will Gregory from Goldfrapp, alongside music by Anne Briggs amongst others:\n\n‚ÄúUsing a mixture of film and TV footage from the BFI National Archive and regional archives around the UK, director Paul Wright creates a mosaic of contrasting images, sounds and moods, taking in folk carnivals and masked parades, hunting and harvesting, communes and raves, mechanisation, environmental issues, fires, floods, storms and much more.‚Äù (From the film‚Äôs accompanying promotional text.)\n\nAt times and particularly earlier in the film it can seem like a pastoral reverie but as it progresses the overall atmosphere and impression it leaves is far from a twee rural idyll and is at times deeply, quietly (and sometimes not so quietly) unsettling.\n\nAt A Year In The Country I have previously talked about particular television series etc being a form of ‚ÄúAlbion in the overgrowth‚Äù, in the sense that they may contain glimpses of what could be loosely called an otherly, undercurrents or flipside of pastoral related culture; due to the institutional funding via the BFI, the ‚Äúknown‚Äù performers of its soundtracks and its still independent/arthouse but wider scale cinematic and upcoming home release, Arcadia seems like a time when the underground goes overground ‚Äì a more publicly prominent expression of a contemporary interest in what could also be called ‚Äúwyrd‚Äù pastoral and folk culture.\n\nIt could be seen as a companion piece to the also BFI released DVD MisinforMation, which was also created using found footage:\n\n‚ÄúThe BFI invited Mordant Music to re-score a series of 70s and 80s public information films, resulting in a startling and ingenious audiovisual mash-up.‚Äù (From the DVD‚Äôs promotional text.)\n\nArcadia even shares the use of similar archival public information film footage, although due to its focusing on PIFs, MisinforMation can be seen as being more strictly hauntological than Arcadia, as such films are something of an ongoing mainstay and reference point for hauntological orientated ideas and work.\n\nPaul Wright‚Äôs film seems to explore and exist in the undefined but still recognisable territory where the hauntological, spectrally imprinted layers of history and culture intertwine with that aforementioned sense of an otherly pastoralism and the further reaches of folk culture.\n\nWell, I say further reaches but actually much of for example the more folk ritual orientated footage that can be found in Arcadia would once and in a different context be considered to be fairly normal day-to-day archival footage of local activities and celebrations; within Arcadia they seem to gain another meaning as the film builds to become far more than the sum of its parts and reveals a sense of hidden layers and the stories to be found running beneath and throughout the land.\n\nAlthough in large part being created from what appears to be archival documentary footage, Arcadia does not purely draw from such film but also includes sections of Brownlow and Morro‚Äôs film Winstanley and its recreation of the 17th century diggers and their radical communal ways of living ‚Äì although in a way that film seems almost nearer to documentary footage than a work of biographical fiction and so seems to fit particularly well in amongst Arcadia‚Äôs use of found footage.\n\nElsewhere as mentioned earlier there are glimpses of public information films, what appear to be rurally set performance art and artist‚Äôs films and also the likes of David Gladwell‚Äôs experimental/exploratory film Requiem for a Village:\n\n‚ÄúThe idyllic, rural past of a Suffolk village comes to life through the memories of an old man who tends a country graveyard.‚Äù (From the DVD‚Äôs promotional text.)\n\nAt points Arcadia‚Äôs soundtrack brings to mind Ghost Box Records-esque electronica and possibly also Boards of Canada‚Äôs hauntological progenitorial work; connected to which and some of the atmospheres Boards of Canada‚Äôs work creates, the images on the screen in Arcadia are often pastoral in nature but the soundtrack at times appears to conjure a sense of a foreboding dystopic future.\n\nAt other points Arcadia‚Äôs soundtrack becomes a pounding, acid rave beat and images of the abandonment that is sometimes found in folk rituals and games are interspliced with footage of rave/club scenes, which historically could still be seen to have a rural connection as the unlicensed side of raves at one time often took place in country settings, in say deserted rural warehouses and open fields, although it is not made overly clear in Arcadia if this is the case with the footage which is used.\n\nElsewhere the escapism of participants in psychedelic/hippy probably 1960s or earlier 1970s rural festival footage appears in the film, which is is somewhat contrasted by the use of other footage which depicts the harsher form of escapism and youthful expression of urban punk gigs.\n\nSome of the images in Arcadia could be seen as being accidental forebears to Henry Bourne‚Äôs portraits of contemporary folk costume wearers in his book Arcadia Britannica: A Modern British Folklore Portrait. In fact Arcadia as a whole seems almost as if it could somehow have fallen both backwards and forwards through time and to somewhow be both an influence on and reflection on spectral pastoral work.\n\nAdding to that sense of time slip, the version I watched was a compressed, lossy, timecoded preview version, which along with some of the degraded/multi-generational nature of sections of the source footage lend Arcadia a sense that it could well be a semi-lost film that you might stumble upon on the likes of Youtube.\n\nSections of Arcadia appear to be taken from previous era‚Äôs witchcraft/occult pseudo-documentaries and in a further falling backwards-and-forwards through time manner, some of the related footage in the film shares a similar aesthetic with some of the imagery and work created/collaborated on by the band Broadcast and its core members James Cargill and Trish Keenan, who released a collaborative album called Broadcast and the Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio age.\n\nThat album also used found sounds from similar pseudo-documentaries, while part of Broadcast‚Äôs avant-pop aesthetic seemed to draw from and/or channel a form of psychedelic occultism.\n\nThere appears to be a utopian/progressive undercurrent to Arcadia, related to which, at times the use and juxtaposition of images ‚Äì for example the idyllic pastoral and the voracious actions of industry ‚Äì can veer towards a more overtly polemic direction and possibly intention; it seems stronger as a piece of work when those elements are less stridently and more space is left for the viewer to travel with the film and I expect still be subtly signposted towards a particular conclusion and point of view.\n\nThe film ends with George Auric and Isla Cameron‚Äôs haunting performance of the song O Willow Waly, a version of which was used in Jack Clayton‚Äôs unsettling pastoral supernatural 1961 film The Innocents and which was also released on seven-inch by often archival release orientated record label Finders Keepers. Due to that supernatural/pastoral connection, its use here seems somewhat appropriate and something of a rounding of the circle back to earlier work which also explored the undercurrents and hidden, layered stories of the land and rural areas.\n\nIn reflection of the collaged, layered nature of the film, I thought I would continue and finish off with a few examples of the voiceover found in Arcadia, which I assume are also largely taken from archival footage:\n\n‚ÄúShe was told the truth lay in the soil.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFor a thousand years these valleys have had a secret which no one else has shared.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúA secret past. A hidden history.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúA land of great magic. A land of great mystery.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAll over Britain many still take part in these otherworldly rituals‚Ä¶ return to a time when we were connected to the land. A time when we were connected to each other.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDoes your mam know what you get up to when you come down here?‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúShe will do now with you lot showing this on the telly.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNone knew that a shadow had fallen on the land.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFor those with an image of the countryside as being somehow related to ‚ÄòMerrie England‚Äô, the presence of those who are impoverished and underpriveliged is a real threat.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf I wanted to I could fill this little room with ghosts.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe past is gone, the future is unwritten.‚Äù\n\nElsewhere:\n\nArcadia‚Äôs website\n\nArcadia at the BFI / it‚Äôs nationwide cinematic release\n\nThe Arcadia film collection at the BFI Player\n\nElsewhere at A Year In The Country:\n\nDay #29/365: Alison Goldfrapp ‚Äì Performer As Curator and a wander through crumbling textures\n\nDay #146/365: Glimpses of Albion in the overgrowth\n\nDay #143/365: Central Office Of Information + Mordant Music = MisinforMation\n\nDay #78/365: Winstanley ‚Äì Another Field In England\n\nDay #143/365: Central Office Of Information + Mordant Music = MisinforMation\n\nWanderings #13/52a: Boards Of Canada ‚Äì Tomorrows Harvest; Stuck At The Starting Post / Tumbled From A Future Phase IV?\n\nEther Signposts #5/52a: Homer Sykes Once A Year And A Lineage Of Folk Custom Wanderings\n\nDay #242/365: The return of old souls; fleeting glances of Anne Briggs\n\nDay #106/365: The whisperings of Willow O Waly\n\nBroadcast ‚Äì Recalibration, Constellation and Exploratory Pop: Chapter 8 Book Images\n\nA while ago I watched Requiem, which is a television series created by Kris Mrska and co-produced by the BBC and Netflix.\n\nIt is a largely rurally set supernatural thriller, which is fairly unsettling without overly relying on gratuitous gore/fx as a form of entertainment/questionable audience stimulant, as seems to often be the case with much of contemporary television and film.\n\nAs a very brief introductory precis of the plot it involves a famous classical cellist who after the self-immolation of her mother attempts to seek the truth behind her death and her own origins, the search for which, after she finds newspaper clippings collected and hidden by her mother, leads her to a rural community where a young girl had gone missing and was never found many years before, the mystery of which begins to have a multi-layered, supernatural conspiracy aspect to it.\n\nRequiem could be placed in a loose gathering of ‚Äúglimpses of Albion in the overgrowth‚Äù television ‚Äì mainstream dramas etc which to various degrees explore, utilise and express a flipside or otherly pastoralism.\n\n(As I have mentioned before there is no overarching, definitive genre name for such things but elements of the further reaches of folk culture, paganism, the supernatural, hauntological timeslip etc can be found in such things. Wyrd is a word that is often used but for some reason it also seems a little possibly clumsy or inelegant in terms of trying to capture a sense of such spectral cultural phantasms.)\n\nAlong similar lines in relatively recent times in that loose gathering could be included Britannia, The Living and The Dead and elements of Detectorists, while if you cast the net further in years it could also take in the Savage Party Hollyoaks trailer and the turn of the millennium remake of Randall & Hopkirk (Deceased) ‚Äì the latter two of which I have written about at the A Year In The Country site before and in the Wandering Through Spectral Fields book.\n\nAnyways, back more directly to Requiem.\n\nThe introduction sequence is particularly striking. It combines various layered elements and atmospheres ‚Äì a sense of beauty, subtle eeriness and darkness, a cello semi-hidden in the images, nature and wildlife, ancient folklore and superstition. Aesthetically it is nicely textured and kaleidoscope/mirrored, with subtle tinges of offset RGB transmissions and puts me in mind here and there of biological illustrator Angela Mele‚Äôs work for The Creeping Garden.\n\n(As an aside, the sequence is by the Peters Anderson Studio ‚Äì which now I know makes sense I‚Äôd thought it had a certain classy texturality, the lineage of which could be traced back to the likes of Vaughan Oliver and Nigel Grierson‚Äôs work for 4AD in the 1980s. The Peters Anderson Studio also created the nicely textured pastoral artwork for Sharron Kraus‚Äô Pilgrim Chants & Pastoral Trails album released by Second Language Music and which I have written about at A Year In The Country previously.)\n\nThe soundtrack for Requiem was created by Dominik Scherrer and Natasha Khan, who is known for her work as Bat For Lashes and could be filed alongside The Living and the Dead‚Äôs, in that it explores/accompanies a sense of otherly pastoralism (and in The Living and the Dead‚Äôs case folk music and culture) within a mainstream television setting and which has been released to buy but only, at the time of writing, via download.\n\n(The Living and The Dead‚Äôs soundtrack was released independently by The Insects who created/recorded it, Requiem‚Äôs by Dubois Music.)\n\nWhich is a shame, as apart from having a softspot for physically presented music I think that both series‚Äô imagery and themes could lend themselves to some fine packaging.\n\nAlong which lines of such things being released physically or not, I have noticed increasingly that BBC television series are only being released in high definition online/digitally and in standard definition on DVD and not Blu-ray, which also seems a shame and restrictive in terms of options. The Living and the Dead was released on both Blu-ray and DVD but as far as I know Requiem is only being released on DVD.\n\nI guess this is market-lead consideration, with Blu-ray sales still only being a fraction of those for DVD (20/80 respectively the last I read).\n\nAlthough sometimes HD can be a little harsh in its presentation and possibly seem a little too ‚Äúreal‚Äù or break the spell of a drama, not having the option for it in physical media is still a tad annoying.\n\nSuch is the modern world I guess.

Below: artwork for a foreign release of Quatermass and the Pit and a Blu-ray reissue.)\n\nPrince of Darkness shares some similar preoccupations as Nigel Kneale‚Äôs work and could be seen as treading not dissimilar ground as Quatermass and the Pit, which features an ancient alien spacecraft and race that are unearthed and discovered to have been instigators/controllers of mankind‚Äôs darker urges over the ages: in both films ancient destructive, human mind and action controlling forces are awakened and the devil, dark forces and evil are given rational, scientific, physical explanations and embodiments, with these beings bearing a physical similarity to archetypal images of devils.\n\n(In a further connection to British science fiction authors, one of the characters in Prince of Darkness is called Wyndham, which may well be a homage to The Midwich Cuckoos author John Wyndham ‚Äì a book which John Carpenter would go on to adapt in 1995 when he made Village of the Damned, which had been originally adapted for cinema in 1960.)\n\nAll the above could make Prince of Darkness seem to be a quite heavy experience but I hasten to add that it is an entertaining film ‚Äì well, entertaining in the sense of unsettling the living heck out of you. As John Carpenter says in one of the Blu-ray extras ‚ÄúI wanted to do a movie that caused a lot of unease and dread‚Äù.\n\nJob accomplished Mr Carpenter.\n\nThe extra in question is called ‚ÄúSympathy for the Devil‚Äù, which features a new interview with John Carpenter and can be found on the Scream Factory / Shout Factory Collector‚Äôs Edition Blu-ray release of the film, which if you have access to a Blu-ray player capable of playing Region A discs is well worth seeking out.\n\nIt features a sympathetic restoration and extras, particularly the new interview with John Carpenter that inform and inspire further debate rather than merely revealing or over revealing ‚Äúthe secrets behind the magic curtain‚Äù.\n\nOh and nicely done animated menu screen as well (!).\n\nThe Blu-ray cover features a newly commissioned illustration by Justin Osbourn, which pays homage to the atmosphere and era of production of the film while also lending it a certain modern tinge or edge.\n\n(As an aside, when writing this I saw that Scream Factory have released a steelbook version of the film, the new cover illustration for which is a good capturing of the intermingling of science, technology, religion, horror, the super or preternatural etc within the film. As an aside within an aside ‚Äì blimey, it‚Äôs getting to be like vinyl single covers in the 1980s with all the variants of film covers released in limited edition and the like nowadays.)\n\nWatched now, when much of film and television is almost frantically kinetic and action filled, Prince of Darkness has a refreshing stillness of pace ‚Äì although without being slow, plodding or recalling a sense of the now sometimes hard to digest rhythms of previous decades of film and television. Rather, this allows the viewer‚Äôs mind and imagination to wander.\n\nAlong which lines, in Sympathy for the Devil, John Carpenter discusses how film today ‚Äúis all bebop‚Äù ‚Äì referring to the style of jazz which features fast tempos and complex, rapid changes and how he considers that there are two main ways of making films: one approach which draws from German expressionist film and has a certain languid presentation which allows space and time for the viewer to ‚Äúlook around‚Äù and another which draws from Russian montage, where there is a rapid cutting together of images in order to keep people excited and stimulated but which can be devoid of content.\n\nPrince of Darkness ain‚Äôt so bebop and all the better for it.\n\nConnected to which despite it being an unsettling horror film, there is little gratuitous gore in the film.\n\nThis is in contrast to much of contemporary film and television, whether horror, thriller etc, where a very graphic presentation of such things seems to have become the norm and a form of easy, obvious and questionable form of audience stimulation.\n\nYes, it‚Äôs okay, we get it, between CGI and prosthetics you‚Äôve worked out how to portray such things ‚Äì the possesion of that technical ability does not mean you have to use it. There is a known part of human consciousness called imagination which does not need precise visual depicting of acts in order to create its own images and atmospheres (!).\n\nAnyways‚Ä¶\n\nJohn Carpenter also discusses in the Blu-ray extras how he had been reading a book on subatomic particles, which seems to have informed the film‚Äôs themes:\n\n‚ÄúNone of this is truth. Say goodbye to classical reality because our logic collapses on the subatomic level into ghosts and shadows.‚Äù (From a lecture presentation in the film.)\n\nThat sense of reality, of our belief systems being questioned, collapsing and thrown into new light could well be the main underlying theme of the film.\n\nElsewhere:\n\nThe Prince of Darkness trailer via Scream Factory\n\nAn extract from Sympathy for the Devil/an interview with John Carpenter from the Scream Factory Blu-ray\n\nThe Scream Factory Collector‚Äôs Edition\n\nThe Scream Factory limited edition Steelbook\n\nElsewhere at A Year In The Country:\n\n1) Wanderings, Explorations and Signposts 4/52a: Halloween III: Season of the Witch ‚Äì A Curious Slice of Culture and Collisions with the Past\n\n2) Wanderings, Explorations and Signposts 22/52: John Carpenter‚Äôs Prince of Darkness Part 1 ‚Äì The Sleeper Awakens\n\n3) Wanderings, Explorations and Signposts 23/52: John Carpenter‚Äôs Prince of Darkness Part 2 ‚Äì ‚ÄúThis is not a dream‚Äù"
