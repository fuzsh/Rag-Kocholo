A world where a sense of the impossible, the fantastic, the spectacular finds its way into the architecture and design of everything from shopping malls, hospitals and office blocks to art galleries, restaurants and nightclubs. In these futuristic places and spaces, aluminium clad interiors, (hidden) surveillance cameras, robotic displays, retro sci-fi design and ‘impossible’ lines, shapes and vanishing points seemingly allow the wanderer to time travel and see beyond or rather to enter into the future. For example, in the modern nightclub interior, space can suddenly change or metamorphose, creating the impression that one is caught in a state of spatial flux. Floors move, lighting and laser rigs are in perpetual motion, video projection creates the sense that one is being immersed in the holodeck, and ‘special effects’, whether it be water emerging from beneath the floor or a space craft descending from the rotating ceiling, make the club space unstable – outside the physical laws of gravity. of course, the cyborg clubber ‘plugs’ herself into this liquid machine and by so doing becomes a vital part of its futuristic circuitry. We live in a world where the everyday stories that people tell one another – over dinner, in the school playground, on the front of newspapers and in the soundbites of television – border on the wondrous and the terrifying in equal measure. For example, tabloid and broadsheet newspapers are full of ‘science fiction’ stories such as the alien invasion scenarios that make it into print on almost a daily basis. The mysterious and scientifically unexplainable appearance of corn circles in england is one ‘seasonal’ example. Or newspapers are full of science fact stories that are written as impossible stories so they become interchangeably science t h e sc i e n c e f i c ti o n f i l m reader\n\nLiquid_Metal_pages.indb 9\n\nfact/fiction narratives. The recent, although still unconfirmed, genetic cloning of baby girl ‘Eve’ by the Raelians (a religious cult who believes that Aliens begat the human race), is one example where elements of science fact and fiction collide. it is an example that points to the way the borders of science fiction and science fact actually merge and ultimately collapse in the postmodern world – where the real is as much (science) fiction as the fiction itself, and where the (science) fiction is – or becomes – as credible or authentic as fact. Through this type of simulation, even Jean Baudrillard’s (1994) meta-concept of hyperreality, from which this idea is borrowed from, seems little removed from the pages of Philip K. Dick or Robert A. Heinlein. The television representation of war is another example of the way in science fiction’s codes and conventions in part provide the audio soundtrack, the special effects and the spectacular action sequences for the ‘actual’ conflict that takes place. Computergenerated missiles, spectacular explosions, doomsday scenarios and evil dictators planning biological attacks, are borrowed or re-imagined from the science fiction lexicon and drawn into the way war is imaged and narrated on factual television programmes. As this Reader was being composed, news programmes across the world spectacularly prepared their people for another horrifying invasion narrative as the US and UK fireup for a terribly real sci-fi war in iraq. We live in a world where the mass media in general calls upon the science fiction text to sell cinema seats, boost ratings or to connect or engage people from across the globe. Today when one goes to the multiplex or to the video/DVD rental store, or when one switches on the television or scans the latest listings magazines, ix\n\n10/1/14 12:40:01\n\none expects to find either the latest science fiction blockbuster showing, or a recent science fiction hit or television series being rented or premiered, or a golden oldie sci-fi flick getting a repeat airing, often as part of some sci-fi mini-season, on late-night television. Whole digital channels are dedicated to its fare. Numerous magazines and journals speak its name. Bookshops dedicate whole sections to the science fiction text. Science fiction websites connect millions of fans across the globe. Science fiction-based conventions and conferences populate the entertainment and academic landscape, for many people structuring or mapping out the year for them. Science fiction is a religion for some, a big, fat dollar sign for others. Science fiction is everywhere in the postmodern world. Science fiction film and television is everywhere and yet never really totally at home in the academic world today, ignored or scorned and critiqued as it so often is. in terms of cinema, science fiction is often in part blamed for the infantilism of New Hollywood and named as the motor for childish and vulgar cinematic display. As Thomas Schatz naively bemoans: From The Godfather to Jaws to Star Wars, we see films that are increasingly plotdriven, increasingly visceral, kinetic, and fast-paced, increasingly reliant on special effects, increasingly ‘fantastic’ (and thus apolitical), and increasingly targeted at younger audiences. (1993: 23) Or else science fiction is seen as one of the apocalyptic catalysts for real cinema’s imminent death. So the argument runs, science fiction film fills the movie world with too many special effects and set-piece moments at the expense of narrative development or meaningful characterisation, or so relies on CGI or the digital aesthetic that reel film dies in the antiquated chemical process to which it clings to. or finally, science fiction cinema is seen as the ultimate commodity intertext, a marketplace for selling games, toys, theme park rides and product tie-ins, x\n\nLiquid_Metal_pages.indb 10\n\nand its own endless stream of remakes and sequels – in what therefore becomes an over-determining and all-devouring franchise system. Television-based science fiction is seen to be central to this commodity-synergy footprinting: uniting the second, third, fourth etc. series of say, Star Trek, with their cinematic interpretations, year after year after year. And yet science fiction film and television is in another sense valorised by the academic community since it is seen as a cohering genre that is best able to articulate contemporary fears, such as those that presently exist over genetic engineering and nuclear war, and to play out ideological tensions around class, race, gender and sexuality. As Annete Kuhn summarises, … there is the idea that science fiction films relate to the social order through the mediation of ideologies, society’s representation of itself in and for itself – that films speak, enact, even produce certain ideologies, which cannot always be read directly off films’ surface contents. (1990:10) The science fiction text, so seemingly far fetched and non-realistic, is here seen as an allegorical or metaphorical or mythical meaning-making system that directly interprets or questions or provides healing solutions to the everyday issues and problems that people face on the planet. Here the argument runs: if you want to know what really aches a culture at any given time don’t go to its art cinema, or its gritty social realist texts, but go to its science fiction. This is precisely the destination of this Reader. Liquid Metal: The Science Fiction Film Reader is the very first extended collection of previously published essays on science fiction film and, to a lesser extent, television. The Reader brings together a great number of what are regarded to be ‘seminal’ essays that have opened up the study of science fiction to serious critical interrogation. The essays in this collection understand science fiction either as a destructive liquid me ta l\n\n10/1/14 12:40:01\n\ngenre, in the senses outlined above, or as culturally central to the transmission of dominant ideology or counter-hegemony, to identity formation, and to the political wounds that mark any age or society at any given time. The essay choices in this Reader have not only been made on the quality and the importance of the writing to an understanding of how science fiction functions, but in terms of a loose histography, so that arguably the ‘best’ of the writing on science fiction, over the last thirty or so years, is represented. However, choices have also been predicated on two other factors. First, essays have been chosen so that across the Reader the film and television texts that are discussed cover science fiction from America, europe and Asia – although, as might be expected, American cinema dominates. Second, essays have been chosen in terms of their centrality to the themes that structure and sub-divide the book, themes that themselves have been chosen on the basis of how they have come to dominate the major concerns of science fiction writing in recent academic history. The Reader is divided into eight distinct themed sections, each section containing three or four key essays that explore in different and sometimes contradictory ways the theme that heads the section. The\n\nt h e sc i e n c e f i c ti o n f i l m reader\n\nLiquid_Metal_pages.indb 11\n\nReader, forgive the pun, takes the reader on an intellectual, textual and contextual journey, beginning with an exploration of the generic specificities of its form, and ending with a historically specific case-study section: the 1950s invasion narratives. Along the way cyborgs are encountered and dispatched; great metropolis are visited and destroyed; the world ends and is reborn; fan’s poach around for deeper meaning; aliens arrive and issue grave warnings; and people stand and stare, in awe and wonder, at the liquid textures of the science fiction text. Given the ‘popular’ dominance of science fiction cinema within Hollywood filmmaking, given the dramatic rise in the number of film courses (in Britain, europe and North America) that take science fiction cinema as a key area of study, and given a current academic marketplace where only separately themed books on science fiction exist, Liquid Metal is a timely and necessary addition to the literature on science fiction cinema. i hope you enjoy the Reader.

It can involve futuristic gadgets, weaponry, clothing, housing and transportation, including silver suits, intergalactic space crafts, flying cars and light sabres. But science fiction can also involve the mere ‘copying’ of existing social and cultural relations so that what the audience sees and hears in part resembles closely the world as it is experienced on a daily basis. Science fiction can be special effects-laden with marvellous and miraculous worlds conjured up in instantaneous, seamless and seemingly effortless strokes of realism, but it can just as easily be technology free with the absence of special effect an eerie marker of malaise in the sci-fi narrative. Science fiction can be about mad scientists, bad science, alien invaders, nuclear or biological catastrophe, time travel, psychosexual lack and terror, space travel, prophecy and apocalypse, utopia, dystopia, technophobia, technophilia, racial and national identity, the family and corporate capitalism. Science 2\n\nLiquid_Metal_pages.indb 2\n\nfiction can be driven by display, spectacle and wonderment, but it can also be motored by melancholy and introspection. Science fiction is like the western, the noir, and often borrows or shares its codes and conventions with the horror film, in hybrid exchanges and articulations. Science fiction is, as a consequence, particularly difficult to pin down generically. Science fiction shapeshifts and transmogrophies just like the best traditions of its narrative. Nonetheless, there is something wonderful about the science fiction text. in an extract from Vivian Sobchack’s ‘Images of Wonder: The Look of Science Fiction’, the visual surfaces of science fiction cinema are shown to be inconsistent, at least in terms of narrative meaning and context. Drawing on the work of Jim Kitses and Colin McArthur, Sobchack examines the iconography of the spaceship and the robot to see if they hold the same generic weight as that of the railroad in the western. Sobchack concludes that these liquid me ta l\n\n10/1/14 12:40:02\n\ntwo potential ‘icons’ are in fact so fluid in their textual uses within science fiction that ‘it is the very plasticity of objects and settings in SF films which help define them as science fiction, and not their consistency. And it is this same plasticity of objects and settings that deny the kind of iconographic interpretation which critically illuminates the essentially static worlds of genres such as the western and gangster film’. Steve Neale locates the cohering parameters of science fiction film in terms of the ‘special effects effect’. This is the selfconscious response that is elicited from audiences the moment they are faced with a particularly astonishing or horrifying science fiction event that has been conjured up from the seamless magic of the special effects department. According to Neale, special effects not only have direct and involuntary cerebral or physical effects on the audience but they also simultaneously involve audiences in a three-way dialogue about the very nature of special effects as they happen in a film. Audiences are aligned with the (sometimes incredulous) characters in the film, with the makers of the special effect (who are ‘showing off ’ their spectacular capabilities at the moment the special effect is revealed), and the cinema as institution, that is also drawing attention to its machinery and commercial nature more widely. According to Neale, special effects involve audiences in a self-conscious process: while audiences may stare in wonder at a city suddenly, supposedly, crafted out of thin air, they may at the same time utter ‘what an amazing special effect’, acknowledging the magic hand of the special effects department and filmmaking in the very moment that it is witnessed. in contrast, Barry Keith Grant argues that ‘the pleasure of science fiction is deter-\n\nt h e sc i e n c e f i c ti o n f i l m reader\n\nLiquid_Metal_pages.indb 3\n\nmined by the quality (synonymous with believability) of the special effects. For these viewers, nothing destroys the pleasure of a science-fiction movie than seeing the ‘seams’ in a matte shot or glimpsing the zipper on an alien’s bodysuit’. Grant begins his essay by comparing horror with science fiction, arguing that the appeal of science fiction is cognitive and cerebral, driven as it so often is by ‘heady issues’ and a sense of wonder. The science fiction texts looks to the stars, to parallel worlds, to ‘alternative possibilities’, while its narratives and thematics are conjured up out of the alchemy and the discoveries of chemistry and physics. Consequently, for Grant, the best (recurring) textual and reception symbol or image for the ‘scopophilic pleasure’ of science fiction is the wide-eyed child, repeatedly caught in the sensory overload of science fiction’s possible futures. Warren Buckland’s essay initiated a heated exchange with J. P. Telotte in the pages of the journal Screen. Buckland also acknowledges the centrality of special effects to science fiction cinema, arguing that they are not just conduits of spectacle and display but representational devices for the creation of what he calls (borrowing from modal logic studies) ‘possible worlds’, or ‘a modal extension of the ‘actual world’’. Buckland then goes on to develop a more controversial argument around the digital image, digital special effects and realism. In his reading of Jurassic Park and The Lost World, Buckland argues that ‘The interactions created between the digital dinosaurs and live action/real backgrounds within a single shot help to create a new realism in the digital image, for the effects create the illusion of spatial and diegetic unity’.\n\n3\n\n10/1/14 12:40:02\n\nthe wondeR of science fiction\n\nImages of Wonder: The Look of Science Fiction Vivian Sobchack\n\nAlthough a great deal has been written about the images in science fiction (SF) films, most often that writing has been more descriptive than analytic. There has been only minor consideration of the nature of SF images and their function in the creation of a film genre which in photographic content is unlike any other. Instead, discussions of the visual surface of the films have usually seemed to degenerate into a delightful but critically unproductive game film enthusiasts play: ‘Swap that Shot’ or ‘The Robot You Love to Remember’. Although there is absolutely no reason to feel guilty about swapping nostalgically remembered images like baseball trading cards, it does seem time to go beyond both gamesmanship and nostalgia toward a discovery of how SF images in content and presentation function to make SF film uniquely itself. What, if anything, do all the films have in common in their visual surface? Iconography One approach to the images in genre films (most often the western or gangster film) has been iconographic. Jim Kitses, one of first film critics to discuss the relationship of iconography to the genre film in his Horizons West, explains the basis of the approach: ‘As a result of mass production, the accretions of time, and the dialectics of history and archetype, characters, situations and actions can have an emblematic power.’1 And Colin McArthur, in Underworld U.S.A., emphasises the ‘continuity over several decades of patterns of visual imagery, of recurrent objects and figures in dynamic relationship’ which ‘might be called the iconography of the genre.’2 McArthur goes on to say: ‘The recurrent patterns of imagery can be usefully divided into three categories: those surrounding the physical presence, attributes and dress of the actors and the characters they play; those emanating from the milieux within which the characters operate; and those connected with the technology at the characters disposal.’3 4\n\nLiquid_Metal_pages.indb 4\n\nIn certain groupings of films, then, the visual units which manifest – and often dictate – character, situation and action have been examined as those elements which not only link the films together, but which also carry meaning and emotional nuance beyond their physical particularity in any one film. Because these elements of visual content appear again and again in film after film, they have become visual conventions or icons, pictorial codes which are a graphic shorthand understood by both filmmaker and audience.4 The western topography (whether photographed in the United States or Spain) is not just any place; beyond the specificity of badlands, mountains, rangeland, desert, its appearance evokes associations in the viewer which are, perhaps, more metaphysically than historically based. The same could be said of the city of the gangster film; buildings and alleys, rooftops and fire escapes surround themselves with clusters of meaning and yet-unplayed actions, with emotional reverberations which have little connection with the same physical objects represented, for example, in an urban comedy like Preston Sturges’ Christmas in July (1940), or an urban musical like Robert Wise’s West Side Story (1961). Costumes and tools also become objects of totemic significance in certain film genres; the gun of the western is different in significance as well as in kind from the gun of the gangster film. This recognition of iconography is, perhaps, what Michael Butor was trying to indicate when, attempting to define science fiction, he felt it was sufficient to say: ‘You know, those stories that are always mentioning interplanetary rockets.’5 His statement, how-ever, brings us to a crucial issue regarding any iconographic consideration of the SF film. Butor, himself, acknowledges that rocketships are not in themselves necessary to science fiction.6 And one could create a list of such SF ‘objects’ as the spaceship which do indeed evoke the genre, but which are specifically and physically not essential to it: the New Planet, the Robot, the Laboratory, Radioactive Isotopes and Atomic Devices. On the other hand, it is extremely difficult to think of a western which does not take place in a visually represented ‘West’ with guns and horses, or to recall a gangster film which does not show a nightclub or which has no guns and no automobiles. These settings and objects seem physically essential to these genres and liquid me ta l\n\n10/1/14 12:40:02\n\nLiquid_Metal_pages.indb 5\n\nVivian Sobchack\n\nt h e sc i e n c e f i c ti o n f i l m reader\n\nare not those which surround the images of a stagecoach, horse or covered wagon. From its first silent chugging to its clangorous present, the railroad in the history of the western film has not altered in its physical particularly or its specific significance; it is, indeed, an icon. Now let us examine one of the most potential icons of SF cinema: the spaceship. Any inspection of the genre leads one in-evitably to the conclusion that there is no consistent cluster of meanings provoked by the image of a spaceship. The visual treatments of the ship vary from film to film – and sometimes even vary within a single film. Beyond the fact that seeing a spaceship on the screen signals to the viewer that he is watching a film which does not take place in the present (and even that signal is weakening since space flight is now a reality), there is no constant meaning generated by that image; because there is no consistent meaning, there is little accumulation of ‘emblematic power’ carried by the object from movie to movie. There are those films, for example, which treat the spaceship lovingly, positively, optimistically. There is no doubt as to the ‘goodness’ of a technology which can produce such a magnificent toy (although this goodness does not necessarily extend to the men who created the technology nor to the men who employ it). The ship itself is ‘good’. It is aesthetically beautiful. It is fun to play with. It promises positive adventure, an ecstatic release from the gravitational demands of Earth, and it can remove us from ourselves and the complexity of life on our planet, taking us to new Edens and regeneration. In Destination Moon (Irving Pichel, 1950), the silvery sleekness of Ernest Fegté’s single-stage spaceship almost palpably glows against the velvet black and star-bejewelled beauty of a mysterious but non-hostile space; it is breathtakingly beautiful, awe inspiring and yet warmly comforting like the night light in a child’s bedroom. In the interior of the ship the crew delights in its weightlessness, playing games with gravity like children released in a schoolyard for recess. When Worlds Collide (Rudolph Mat, 1951), although its plot and themes evoke what John Baxter sees as ‘a 1930s vision of Armageddon’,7 presents us with the positive image of a spaceship as an ‘interplanetary Noah’s Ark’,8 destined to carry a group of potential colonists from a doomed Earth to a new world. The\n\nImages of Wonder\n\ntheir iconographic significance seems readily approachable and comprehensible because they appear and send the same messages to us in almost every film. It is also highly significant that both these genres are visually circumscribed by an awareness of history, the western even more so than the gangster film. This linkage of situation and character, objects, settings and costumes to a specific past creates visual boundaries to what can be photographed and in what context. This historical awareness, which leads at least to an imaginative if not actual authenticity, demands repetition and creates consistency throughout these genres. This is not true, however, of the SF film, a genre which is unfixed in its dependence on actual time and/ or place. There is, then, a very obvious reason for the fact that most iconographic analysis has focused on the western and the gangster film. Simply, these genres play out their narrative in a specific, visually identifiable and consistent context, and the objects of these films accrue their meaning not only from repetitious use, but also because they function in a much more circumscribed and limited way than do objects in other genres. This limitation of meaning should in no way be considered a cinematic, aesthetic, or thematic liability – but it should point to why iconographic analysis serves a less potent critical function when it is used as a method to seek meaning in settings and objects in other film genres less affixed to history. Consider, for example, the railroad – a frequent, although not mandatory, icon in the western. The meanings which are suggested by its appearance on the screen are both complex and richly paradoxical, yet they are also circumscribed in scope from movie to movie. The railroad is not merely its physical manifestation; it is progress and civilisation. It threatens the openness and freedom of the West and individual enterprise, but it also promises the advantages of civilised life and brings the gentling influence of the Eastern heroine who plays the piano and uses an English saddle if she rides horses at all. The ambiguity and paradox contained in the western’s images of the Iron Horse are as rich as our mixed feelings about civilisation and progress, but they are also limited to those feelings and those feelings only. The railroad is not interchangeable with other means of transportation in the western; its meanings\n\n5\n\n10/1/14 12:40:02\n\nthe wondeR of science fiction\n\nspaceship, plumper and looking more fecund than its predecessor in Destination Moon, is visually divorced from the chaos and squabbling on Earth. Completed, it sits horizontally on its launching pad on a mountainside high above the confusion and it ‘glows like gold, while the sky is in perpetual sunset’.9 It visually promises, in contrast to the orange and dying hues of Earth, a golden dawn. Among other films which visually celebrate the spaceship and dwell on its surfaces with a caressive photographic wonder which precludes any ambiguous interpretation of its essential worth are Conquest of Space (Byron Haskin, 1955), with its lavish treatment of takeoffs, manueverings and landings, and Forbidden Planet (Fred Wilcox, 1956), whose ‘palatial flying saucer’10 operates ‘via quanto-gravitetic hyperdrive and postonic transfiguration’.11 There is, however, a demonic side to the spaceship. In many films it is a trap from which there is little hope of escape. Its sleekness is visually cold and menacing, its surfaces hostile to human warmth. It functions mechanically and perfectly, ignorant of its creators and operators – or it malfunctions with malice, almost as if it could choose to do otherwise but prefers to rid itself of its unsleek and emotionally tainted human occupants. Instead of glowing like a night light, it coldly glitters like the blade of a stiletto. Instead of humming, it ticks. It evokes associations not of release, but of confinement. The womb-like and protective warmth of a positive visual treatment is nowhere apparent; rather, the ship is seen negatively, viewed with anti-technological suspicion, the images of it suggesting a tomb-like iciness, a coffin-like confinement. Its corridors and holds echo the sounds of human isolation or provide a haven for alien and lethal dusts and slimes; in unseen corners the subversion of human life begins. In 20 Million Miles to Earth (Nathan Juran, 1957), a spaceship returning to Earth from Venus crashes into the sea, carrying aboard the gelatinous embryo of an alien monster who subsequently hatches and proceeds, after growing, to terrorize Rome. The ship of Mutiny in Outer Space (Hugo Grimaldi, 1964), harbours a deadly fungus and transports it to a space station from whence it threatens to infect the Earth. These rockets and countless others harbour, support and transport alien ‘things’ which ultimately threaten not only Earth, but life itself as we know it. Even more 6\n\nLiquid_Metal_pages.indb 6\n\nmenacing is the ship ‘Discovery’ which is to take astronauts Bowman and Poole to Jupiter in 2001: A Space Odyssey (Stanley Kubrick, 1968). Although the film does not in any way deny the aesthetics of technology, it gives us in ‘Discovery’ a mechanism which barely tolerates and finally rejects human existence. Despite the vastness of the ship, the visual treatment impresses upon us a sense of claustrophobic and stifling confinement, cold and death. Most of the crew are temporarily frozen in cryogenic beds which resemble the sarcophagi of ‘Egyptian mummies’.12 Their movement from life to death because of a computer malfunction is discernable only through the impersonal and yet somehow malevolent red lights and computer print which let us know that their life support systems are no longer operative, and by the needles on the screens above their glass coffins which ‘run amok on the graphs and then record the straight lines of extinction’.13 Vast as it is, the ship allows no room for privacy; Bowman and Poole attempt to hide from the main computer HAL’s omnipresent eyes and ears and unctious voice so they can discuss a possible solution to their predicament, but HAL can read lips and we are given a subjective camera shot to prove it. The astronauts are forced into their bulky and oppressive space-suits by the ship and its computer’s increasing rejection of biological existence; HAL’s paranoia is the ship’s madness as well. This sense of entrapment and confinement is echoed in a more ‘realistically’ plotted film, Marooned (John Sturges, 1969), which ‘was released during the week the world waited for Apollo 13’.14 Three astronauts are confined in a malfunctioning space capsule; almost all the visuals are in close-up, showing the men cramped in their potential coffin orbiting the moon. The capsule is dubbed ‘Ironman One’, a name perhaps suggestive of the medieval torture chamber, called the ‘Iron Maiden’, in which the victim was most securely confined. And, in Silent Running (Douglas Trumbull, 1972), the space freighter ‘Valley Forge’ literally becomes a coffin for its crew, murdered by Freeman Lowell (the ecologicallyminded protagonist) to protect his specimens of plant life from destruction. In this film, the visuals emphasise the vastness of solitary confinement, the deadness of a hermetically sealed existence which is silent and unyielding in its evocation of eternal loneliness. liquid me ta l\n\n10/1/14 12:40:02\n\nLiquid_Metal_pages.indb 7\n\nVivian Sobchack\n\nt h e sc i e n c e f i c ti o n f i l m reader\n\nments: ‘We see that space has been conquered. We also see it has been commercialised and … domesticated. Weightless stewardesses wear weightless smiles, passengers diddle with glorified Automat meals, watch karate on in-flight TV and never once glance out into the void to catch a beam of virgin light from Betelgeuse or Aldebaran’.16 The spaceship of the SF film, then, is in no way comparable to the railroad of the western in the latter’s ability to communicate by its standard physical presence a constant and specific cluster of meanings throughout an entire genre. Unlike the railroad, in so far as the spaceship is a means of getting from here to there, it is, at times, functionally interchangeable with other modes of transportation like the time machine. In films such as The Time Machine (George Pal, 1960) and The Time Travelers (Ib Melchior, 1964), there are definite mechanisms which are at least physically differentiated from the spaceship, but in World Without End (Edward Bernds, 1956) and Planet of the Apes (Franklin Schaffner, 1968), the spaceship is the time machine. Unlike the railroad, not only can the spaceship’s meanings and functions change from film to film and from decade to decade, but its very shape and colour are plastic and inconstant – ergo, the sleek and silver body of the ship in Destination Moon, the circular perfection of the flying saucer in Forbidden Planet, the bright yellow of the minaturised submarine in Fantastic Voyage (Richard Fleischer, 1966), and the combination of dark awkward bulk with the latticed delicacy of the plant domes on the ‘Valley Forge’ of Silent Running.17 In addition, one can draw no conclusions from the films as to a tendency to visualise positively those ships which belong to us (Earthlings) and to visualise negatively those ships which belong to ‘them’ (aliens). Treated as a thing of beauty, the alien Klaatu’s 350-foot flying saucer in The Day the Earth Stood Still (Robert Wise, 1951), is so pure in line, so ascetically designed by Lyle Wheeler and Addison Hehr, that it concretises the Platonic virtues of clarity, sanity, reason – virtues sadly lacking in the Washington, D.C., mise-en-scène in which the saucer comes to rest.18 On the other hand, the Martians’ individual war ships in War of the Worlds (Byron Haskin, 1953), could hardly be more sinister (and eerily beautiful) in their realisation; their shape suggests a cobra or the ocean’s deadly manta ray, their silent movement over city\n\nImages of Wonder\n\nThe spaceship need not, however, be treated either positively or negatively. In numerous SF films, it is seen and used neutrally; its wonders are de-emphasised visually, made to seem commonplace, accepted not only by the characters but by the camera as well – matter-of-factly. The ship is merely a means to get from here to there – and has about as little visual impact and iconic power as a Greyhound bus. The dials and lights and switches are neither warmly supportive nor coldly sinister. They exist – like an automobile dashboard – as something familiar, conquered and forgotten. The complex workings of the ship pose no problems to the garage-mechanic confidence aboard. In Marooned, when the capsule malfunctions, one astronaut helplessly and impotently refers to the good old days in contrast to a present whose technology no longer admits salvation through tinkering: ‘We used to fix the planes we flew with paperclips’, he says, frustration apparent on his face. In those films which treat the spaceship like a Ford, repairs on malfunctions can be affected with the equivalents of paperclips and hairpins – or the problem is so ‘understood’ by the crew in their mechanic-like overalls that there is no mystery whatsoever connected to the malfunction. Films like Rocketship X-M (Kurt Neumann, 1950), The Angry Red Planet (Ib Melchior, 1959) and Queen of Blood (Curtis Harrington, 1965) treat the spaceship as a mechanical convenience which, devoid of wonder, will carry the crew to visually exciting adventures having little to do with a technology already accepted and dismissed. To be nostalgic for a moment, but also to the point, I fondly remember a scene aboard the spaceship in The Angry Red Planet in which the attitude toward the voyage to Mars is visually encapsulated: one sees the hero shaving with an electric razor and the heroine putting perfume behind her ears while a tape bank records a mundane log entry. This domestication of the spaceship leads one to recall the recent terminology used by actual astronauts on the various moon flights and aboard Sky Lab, their references to ‘housekeeping’. Perhaps no film to date, however, has visually evoked the reduction of space flight to ‘the ultimate in humdrum’15 as has 2001: A Space Odyssey in the section in which space-scientist Floyd flies Pan American to an orbiting spaceport and from there to the moon. As Joseph Morgenstern aptly com-\n\n7\n\n10/1/14 12:40:03\n\nthe wondeR of science fiction\n\nand countryside metaphorically turns Earth’s atmosphere turgid, their inexorable progress is punctuated only by the hissing of their incinerating rays.19 The morally ambiguous and finally reprehensible Metalunans of This Island Earth (Joseph Newman, 1955) kidnap two Earth scientists and transport them to another world aboard a spaceship which is pointedly emphasised as a marvel of design, containing as it does such visual delights as a main control centre composed of a brightly-lit and revolving replica of the atom, and a series of translucent tubes which transform their occupants’ molecular structure before our eyes. Even more obvious in their capacity to change shape and colour and evocative power than spaceships are SF robots, all too frequently considered en masse, lumped together superficially and erroneously for critical convenience as emblematic of that vague term ‘SF technology’. Yet, again, after seeing robots in a wide range of films, the viewer must be drawn inevitably to a recognition of their essentially expressive singularity. Gort, the huge intergalactic ‘policeman’ of The Day the Earth Stood Still, is definitely mysterious and menacing. Shot much of the time from a low angle, he is faceless; the otherwise smooth and metallic impenetrability of his blank visage is broken only by a visor which slowly opens to reveal a pulsing light or to emit incinerating rays after which it silently closes. His metallic surface, that visor, is a perverse visualisation of the medieval knight in shining armor, and the images of Gort are far removed from those of the lumbering but pleasant clumsiness of Tobor the Great (Lee Sholem, 1954), devised as the ‘answer to the problem of human space flight’.20 Tobor is treated with the reverence one usually reserves for a can opener, and in one highly comic scene, the robot – operated by a scientist’s young grandson – walks stiffleggedly about the house crashing into furniture and through doors in what amounts to a parody of Frankenstein’s Monster. Tobor becomes a mindless hero because of his inexplicable emotional attachment to the little boy, explained away in the film as ‘a new synthetic instinct, race-preservational concern for the young’. Perhaps the most celebrated robot of all SF film, Robby of Forbidden Planet, bears no resemblance whatsoever to either Gort or Tobor. He was ‘one of the most elaborate 8\n\nLiquid_Metal_pages.indb 8\n\nrobots ever built for a film production. More than two months of trial and error labour were needed to install the 2,600 feet of electrical wiring that operated all his flashing lights, spinning antennae and the complicated gadgets that can be seen moving inside his transparent dome-shaped head’.21 Visually, Robby looks like the offspring of some mad mating between the Michelin tire man and a juke box. He is ‘a phenomenal mechanical man who can do more things in his small body than a roomful of business machines. He can make dresses, brew bourbon whiskey, perform feats of Herculean strength and speak 187 languages … through a neon-lit grille. What’s more, he has the cultivated manners of a gentleman’s gentleman’.22 Although essentially a servant and programmed according to Isaac Asimov’s famous Robotic Laws of SF literature (whose prime directive is that robots shall not harm human beings), Robby has a distinct personality. He is comically humourless and proud. (‘This is my morning’s batch of Isotope 217. The whole thing hardly comes to ten tons’, he says, carrying the ‘whole thing’ around.) He is alternately petulant and helpful; ‘when Francis [Anne Francis, who plays the role of Alta in the film] asks him for star sapphires, he croaks, ‘Star sapphires take a week to crystallise. Will diamonds or emeralds do?’ ‘So long as they’re big ones’, Francis says. ‘Five, ten, fifteen carats are on hand’, Robby replies smugly’.23 Robby’s personality – although treated positively – prefigures to a degree the more sinister HAL of 2001: A Space Odyssey, the computer (an immobile robot) who pushes Robby’s comic hubris over the edge of reason. ‘It is when HAL cannot admit he has made a mistake that he begins to suffer a paranoid breakdown, exhibiting overanxiety about his own infallible reputation and then trying to cover up his error by a murderous attack on the human witnesses.’24 Ultimately, despite their similarity of manner, Robby and HAL are decades apart in both visualisation and meaning. Even if HAL were physically realised as more than ‘a bugeyed lens, a few slabs of glass’,25 it is hard to imagine him becoming the darling of the toy industry as Robby was to become after the release of Forbidden Planet. Robby’s cute rotundity and comic primness, however, did not influence the subsequent screen images of robots. He was revived the following year in The Invisible Boy (Nicholas Nayfack, 1957), liquid me ta l\n\n10/1/14 12:40:03\n\nLiquid_Metal_pages.indb 9\n\nVivian Sobchack\n\nt h e sc i e n c e f i c ti o n f i l m reader\n\nfilms which followed the commerical success of 2001. The mechanical ‘drones’ of Silent Running are affectionately named Huey, Louey and Dewey, but although they waddle, their visual realisation reminds one less of Disney than of Tolkien. (Paul Zimmerman has aptly called them ‘iron hobbits’.28) They are unaesthetic squat boxes on stumpy short legs, neither marvelous nor sinister in their physical realisation. It is their very ordinariness which makes them endearing. The drones are not superhuman like Gort or Robby, nor are they capable of insubordination like HAL; they don’t even talk and their literal interpretation of the English language results occasionally in functional faux pas. And yet, as the film progresses and they are programmed to play poker, to perform a surgical operation, to be ‘companions’ to the isolated Lowell, the camera’s treatment of them becomes progressively sympathetic and subjective, suggesting the merest hint of an animate life of some kind tucked away in their circuitry. As William Johnson points out in an excellent review of the film: ‘They are machines with at least as much claim to animate being as a responsive and well-trained pet.’29 The subjective camera lets us see out of their monitor-screen ‘eyes’ in a way which does not deny their machineness (the images are obviously poor TV quality and in black and white), but promotes as well a feeling of sentient watchfulness. ‘When two drones, standing side by side, bury a dead crewman, Lowell sees part of the body through one drone’s eye and part through the other’s. Later, this odd subjectivity is taken a stage further: when Lowell is talking to the two drones, we (the audience) are shown their monitor screens, through which we look at Lowell and Lowell looks at us … Here, through the drones eyes, ‘man is linked with his creation in a single circuit of consciousness’.30 Such is not the case in Westworld (Michael Crichton, 1973). The subjective camera may let us in one instance look through the scannereyes of the robot gunfighter (coldly played to mechanical perfection by Yul Brynner), but what we see is so remote from human vision that we are emphatically made aware not of a ‘single circuit of consciousness’, but of the vast separation between man and his creations. The little colored cubes which move geometrically over a graph paper-like grid may be aesthetically pleasing in their pastel visualisation, but they\n\nImages of Wonder\n\nas ‘the playmate of his inventor’s ten-year-old son’26 and then he disappeared. Through the 1950s and 1960s, mobile robots continued their singular ways, sometimes visualised negatively, sometimes positively. And they also occasionally functioned interchangeably with other SF manifestations. In Kronos (Kurt Neumann, 1957), the robot is not an instrument of an alien race as was Gort in The Day the Earth Stood Still; brought to Earth by a fireball, Kronos is the alien, a ‘strange machine, half creature, half construction’.27 The huge electronic robot of The Colossus of New York (Eugene Louri, 1958), is a monster also, but his technologically-devised exterior is motivated by impulses found in the most traditional horror films. The robot’s brain is not a complex gadget or an incomprehensible alien mind; it is the transplanted human brain of a scientist’s son and it turns against its father, its creator, as Frankenstein’s monster had done years before. Perhaps the most innovative and intellectually complex treatment of robots was in the low budget Creation of the Humanoids (Wesley Barry, 1962), a film which considers the robot both positively and negatively. Here is posited and visualised a ‘history’ of robotics which leads to the creation of humanoids. The rationale for making the machines look and act human is that ‘Humans found it psychologically unbearable to work side by side with machines’. Finally, the dividing line between robot and human is totally extinguished. Interpreting Asimov’s Robotic Laws literally, the robots have been transferring and duplicating sick humans and accident victims into perfect mechanical bodies; as one robot says, ‘Humanity doesn’t always know what is in its best interest.’ The film’s protagonist, antirobot and member of the Order of Flesh and Blood, turns out to be a humanoid himself and – along with the heroine – is finally raised to the humanoid level R100 by undergoing an operation which will enable him to ‘humanly’ contribute to the reproductive process, a function which the robots see as crude but which ‘fulfills a psychological need’. The film ends with a close-up of a pleasantlooking ‘man’ – our narrator – who smiles directly at the viewer and says, ‘Of course the operation was a success or you wouldn’t be here.’ The mixed treatment of robots is still apparent in the 1970s, in the new group of SF\n\n9\n\n10/1/14 12:40:03\n\nthe wondeR of science fiction\n\ndeny any but the most tenuous connection between the robot’s vision and our (the audience) vision of a warm-blooded and un-geometric human being trying to escape from mechanical retribution. The robots which run amok in this nightmarish extension of Disneyland do so for no known reason. The initial competence of the scientific staff who run the resort, the calm and often boring visual emphasis on computers and monitor screens under expert control, the close-ups of mechanical ‘operations’ and repairs which in their detail suggest a technology thoroughly understood, routinised and conquered, all are quickly subverted by images which emphasise chaos and claustrophobia in the control centre, and a world outside which has been stolen from its anthropomorphic gods in white lab coats. The robots’ malevolence which goes beyond mere malfunction is inexplicable in scientific terms. And Asimov’s Robotic Laws seem purposefully mocked by the mechanical creations turned perfect and skilled killers. The fluctuating meanings of what superficially seem to be iconic objects in SF films can be demonstrated many times over. Time and place are not constants either. The temporal setting of science fiction has no obligation to history; it may be a speculative past (Creation of the Humanoids), the present (Seconds, [John Frankenheimer, 1966]), the immediate future (The Andromeda Strain, [Robert Wise, 1971]), the distant future (Forbidden Planet), or a combination of times as in the Planet of the Apes series. As well, the settings of science fiction know no geographical boundaries and may be found literally anywhere – from smalltown USA, to distant and undiscovered galaxies, to the interior of a human body. Inevitably, then, we must be led away from a preoccupation with a search for consistent visual emblems into more ambiguous territory. It is the very plasticity of objects and settings in SF films which help define them as science fiction, and not their consistency. And it is this same plasticity of objects and settings that deny the kind of iconographic interpretation which critically illuminates the essentially static worlds of genres such as the western and gangster film.\n\n10\n\nLiquid_Metal_pages.indb 10\n\nNotes Jim Kitses, Horizons West (Bloomington, IN.: Indiana University Press, 1969), p. 25. 2 Colin McArthur, Underworld U.S.A.

It has infiltrated the base camp – and the crew – of a scientific observation post in Antarctica. At one point, in the guise of the body of an ailing crew member, it tears off the hands of the doctor who attempts to revive him; then, awakened, sprouts all manner of tentacles and limbs through the muscles and flesh of its host. It is shot down in flames. But one of its tentacles latches on to the crew member’s head, which is now lying under the table: the tentacle lashes out of the head onto a door, and drags itself on its side. Just as it reaches the doorway, the crew see it and are transfixed by it. The head slowly turns upside down and, suddenly, eight insect-like legs rip through the head using it like a body.The sight is of an upside-down severed human head out of which have grown insect feet. As it ‘walks’ out the door, a crew member says the line of the film: ‘You’ve got to be fucking kidding!’2\n\nAs Brophy goes on to show, the significance of this line lies in its twofold status. It is on the one hand a narrative event: a fictional remark made by a fictional character about a specific, fictional entity. As such it is a sign of the character’s astonishment, an acknowledgement of what is for him the reality of the creature and its powers. On the other hand, it is what one might call both a ‘textual’ and an ‘institutional’ event: a remark addressed to the spectator by the film, and by the cinematic apparatus, about the nature of its special effects.As such it is the sign of a number of things. It is a sign that the film is, at this point at least, ‘violently selfconscious’ (to use Brophy’s words):3 it is aware that the Thing (and the world it inhabits) are cinematic fabrications, the product, in particular, of an tthhee sc sciieennccee ffiicctitioonn ffiillm m reader reader\n\nLiquid_Metal_pages.indb 11\n\nup-to-date regime of special effects; it is aware that the powers of this regime have here been stretched to their limit; and it displays both those powers – and that awareness – to the full. It is a sign also of an awareness on the part of the spectator (an awareness often marked at this point by laughter): the spectator knows that the Thing is a fiction, a collocation of special effects; and the spectator now knows that the film knows too. Despite this awareness, the special effects have had an effect. The spectator has been, like the fictional character, astonished and horrified. An effect of this kind is fundamental to science fiction in the cinema. So too, though, is the awareness. In fact, as I shall go on to argue, the effect and the awareness are interdependent. Indeed, one of the keys to understanding the attraction, the pleasure, the lure of science fiction lies precisely in the intricate intercalation of different forms, kinds and layers of knowledge, belief and judgement that a line like the one from The Thing, together with the effect it accompanies, serves both to correlate and mark. In order to identify a little more precisely the nature and function of these forms, kinds and layers, it is necessary to say something about narrative fiction and genre, about cinema and the nature of its images and sounds, and about the status and role of its special effects. All narratives involve the representation of events and their agents. The primary purpose of these agents and events is to provide links in a narrative chain (a plot) on the one hand, and to occasion a range of aesthetic effects (like suspense, surprise and pathos) on the other. Narrative events and their agents are understood and adjudged on the basis of a variety of types of knowledge, and in accordance with a variety of different criteria. This knowledge and these criteria can either be internal and overt or external and implicit. Thus on the one hand the narrative can have its characters comment on one another, on the world they inhabit, and on the events that they encounter, thereby providing the spectator with an array of explicit information and judgements. Alternatively, it can rely on the spectator’s own knowledge and values, appealing implicitly to information and criteria of judgement it presumes it shares with its audience. Most narratives in most genres in the cinema involve both kinds of knowledge 11\n\n10/1/14 12:40:03\n\nthe wondeR of science fiction\n\nand judgement. Thus, for example, two of the members of the crew in The Thing are called doctors, but the film does not at any point explain what a doctor is or does. It assumes we will know. However, soon after the Thing’s first transformation on the base, one of the doctors performs an autopsy on its partially incinerated body. He is needed to provide both spectator and crew with the kind of information that the narrative cannot presume. He says: ‘You see what we’re talking about: here is an organism that imitates other life forms. And it imitates them perfectly. When this thing attacked our dogs it tried to digest them, absorb them, and in the process shape its own self to imitate them.’\n\nThis information is treated as authoritiative, in part because it is delivered, precisely, by an expert, and in part because it remains uncontested: it is the only explanation we are offered. However, a little later in the film there is both speculation and dispute. Two members of the crew are sent out onto the ice to investigate what looks like the remains of some kind of spaceship: – ‘Jesus, how long you figure this has been in the ice?’ – ‘I’d say the ice this is buried in is a hundred thousand years old. At least.’\n\nThey return to base. The helicopter pilot, MacReady, explains what he thinks might have happened; and crewmen Childs and Palmer comment on what he says: – ‘I don’t know. Thousands of years ago it crashes and this thing gets thrown out, or crawls out, and it ends up freezing in the ice.’ – ‘I just can’t believe any of this voodoo bullshit.’ – ‘Happens all the time, man. They’re falling out of the sky like flies. Government knows all about it. Right, Mac?’ – ‘You believe any of this voodoo bullshit, Blair?’ – ‘Childs, Childs. Chariots of the gods, man.’\n\nIn line with Colin MacCabe’s argument that in conventional narrative films (or what he calls ‘classic realist texts’) the truthful view is the 12\n\nLiquid_Metal_pages.indb 12\n\nview confirmed by the camera, by what we ourselves see, it is significant that we tend here to accept MacReady’s account.4 We do so not only because it is the only coherent account we are given but because all Childs offers is doubt, though this is important. Nor do we do so only because MacReady is played by the star of the film, Kurt Russell, though this is important too. We do so primarily because we have been shown MacReady actually looking at the spaceship’s remains, and because we have been shown, in a pre-credit sequence, the spaceship crash. Thus this particular conversation, and the judgement it involves, is significant for what it can tell us about the articulation and acquisition of knowledge in any kind of narrative film. It is significant also, though, for what it can tell us about the nature and function of knowledge in science fiction in particular. All fiction to some extent involves what has traditionally been called ‘suspension of disbelief’, by virtue of the fact that its agents and events are, by definition, unreal. In actual fact, while disbelief may well be involved, it is often knowledge and judgement that the spectator is required to suspend, as Ben Brewster has pointed out.5 Thus in Vincent Minnelli’s film, The Cobweb (1955), we have no choice but to accept the judgement of the film and of a number of the characters that the designs for a new set of curtains show artistic promise and skill, whether or not we may personally like them.6 Similarly, we have no choice but to accept that the unconventional behaviour of many of the film’s characters is due to neurosis, whether or not we have any precise knowledge of mental states and conditions, and whether or not we agree with the way they are portrayed and explained in the film. In The Thing, we have no choice but to accept the doctor’s explanation that the Thing can absorb and imitate other life forms, and MacReady’s thesis that it came from outer space, crashing to Earth in a spaceship. However, while The Cobweb is a contemporary drama, The Thing is science fiction.The cultural status of the events and narrative agents involved in the two films are therefore distinct. While they are in both films equally unreal, spaceships and shapechanging aliens – unlike curtains, neurotically inspired artistic talent and mentally disturbed behaviour – are conventionally adjudged in our culture as also inherently improbable.7 liquid me ta l\n\n10/1/14 12:40:03\n\nt h e sc i e n c e f i c ti o n f i l m reader\n\nLiquid_Metal_pages.indb 13\n\nSnatchers, Elizabeth Driscoll and others try to explain to a sceptical David Kibner that human beings are somehow being copied. ‘Don’t you think we know how insane this sounds?’, she says. ‘But what do you think we’re doing? Do you think we’re making it up?’ One of the reasons why we know that Elizabeth and the others are not ‘making it up’, one of the reasons why we, at least, believe what Roy has to say, is that, as in The Thing, we ourselves have seen what it is that is being referred to, what it is that is being explained. Inasmuch as this is the case, the processes and issues of judgement and belief are ultimately focused – and founded – on what it is we see, and hence ultimately also on the cinematic image and its powers. In his essay ‘The Imaginary Signifier’, the film theorist Christian Metz has addressed in general terms the nature and the powers of the cinematic image – and cinematic sound – and the extent to which they involve, and depend on, specific regimes and structures of knowledge and belief.8 Metz points out that the cinema is in many ways ‘more perceptual’ than other arts like music, literature, sculpture, painting and photography. It involves both vision and audition, and it involves the representation, in detail, of sound, of speech, of objects in space, and of movement and temporal progression. However, this ‘numerical superiority’ disappears when cinema is com-pared to arts like opera and theatre. For opera and theatre, too, involve several axes of perception, and are possessed of similar representational capacities.\n\n‘You’ve Got To Be Fucking Kidding!’ Steve Neale\n\nIt is in this context that the conversation between Childs, MacReady and Palmer is particularly significant. For what is at stake here is precisely the improbability, not only of the film’s own events, but of the reasons it gives for their occurrence. Childs’s scepticism is especially important. For it articulates a position of doubt, a refusal to suspend disbelief, that is shown to be mistaken. But Palmer’s ready acceptance of MacReady’s explanation is also important. If Childs is sceptical, Palmer is naive (and slightly deranged). His enthusiastic evocation of the ‘Chariots of the gods’ is thus merely the equally unacceptable obverse of Childs’s dismissive evocation of voodoo. MacReady’s position, based as it is on direct observation and a coherent assessment of the facts – not on a refusal to face those facts, or on an acceptance of them only because they fit neatly into a pre-existing framework of irrational beliefs – emerges, therefore, by contrast, as all the more balanced, all the more credible, all the more convincing; all the more probable. Like MacReady, The Thing is here engaged in a process of persuasion. Major aspects of its fictional world are, from a general cultural point of view, not only unlikely or impossible, but also, therefore, unknowable in advance and thus in need of explanation.The film is therefore involved both in establishing its own credibility, and in establishing its own regime of credence – the rules, the norms and the laws by which its events and agents can be under-stood and adjudged. What is probable or possible in this world? How does it operate? What is regarded within it as unusual, unlikely, inexplicable? How do we know when the explanations we are offered for the events that occur are right or wrong? And so on. Such a process is of course very common in science fiction (as it is in other genres, like the horror film, which involve the depiction of improbable or ‘marvellous’ events). Common also is the twofold nature of this process, one in which exposition, explanation and the establishment of internal norms are coincident with the negotiation of a position of credibility – and the acknowledgement of positions of incredulity and doubt.Thus in Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Roy Neary tries to explain to his wife what it is that he has witnessed. ‘You’re not going to believe what I saw’, he says. And in the 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body\n\nTheir difference from the cinema lies elsewhere: they do not consist of images, the perceptions they offer to the eye and the ear are inscribed in a true space (not a photographed one), the same as that occupied by the public during the performance; everything the audience hear and see is actively produced in their presence, by human beings or props which are themselves present.9\n\nIn the cinema, by contrast, ‘everything is recorded’,10 everything, therefore, is absent: Thus the cinema, ‘more perceptual’ than certain arts according to the list of its sensory registers, is also ‘less perceptual’ than others once the status of these perceptions is envisaged rather than their number of 13\n\n10/1/14 12:40:03\n\nthe wondeR of science fiction\n\ndiversity; for its perceptions are all in a sense ‘false’. Or rather, the activity of perception it involves is real (the cinema is not a phantasy), but the perceived is not really the object, it is its shade, its phantom, its double, its replica in a new kind of mirror. It will be said that literature, after all, is itself only made of replicas (written words, presenting absent objects). But at least it does not present them to us with all the really perceived detail that the screen does … The unique position of the cinema lies in this dual character of its signifier: unaccustomed perceptual wealth, but at the same time stamped with unreality to an unusual degree, and from the very outset.11\n\nIn the cinema, therefore, a dual and contradictory status is accorded its images and sounds. These images and sounds thus incrementally redouble the already contradictory status of any fiction they may be used to present: ‘In the cinema it is not just the fictional signified, if there is one, that is thus made present in the mode of absence, it is from the outset the signifier.’12 Inasmuch as this is the case, the ‘suspension of disbelief’ required by any fiction – or more accurately, the suspension of judgement, on the one hand, coupled with a splitting or division of knowledge on the other (as can be encapsulated in a formula like ‘I know this is fictional, unreal, but will nevertheless treat it as worthy of judgement, and therefore as worthy of credence’) – is given, in the cinema, an additional twist (‘I know that what is presented by means of these images and sounds is not really there, but nevertheless…’). Yet further twists are added when it comes to a genre like science fiction, which by definition deals, as we have seen, with the unlikely, and hence the unbelievable; and when it comes to the mobilisation, in cinematic science fiction, of a regime of special effects, of specially fabricated images and sounds, both to present and to authenticate its events, its agents and its settings. Metz has discussed special effects in the cinema in ‘Trucage and the Film’.13 He points out that ‘trucages’ in the cinema are of various kinds, and can operate in a variety of different ways at a variety of distinct and different levels. Some, like the effects involved in fades and dissolves, are meant to be perceived. Others, 14\n\nLiquid_Metal_pages.indb 14\n\nlike the use of stuntmen and stand-ins, are not. Some, like back projection, are involved at the point of filming. Others, like wipes, are not. Some, like the use of models and make-up, are primarily profilmic (effects produced in front of the camera, but without the aid of its own particular technological capabilities). Others, like slow-motion and mattes, depend either upon the specific capacities of the camera, or upon other cinematographic devices and processes.And so on.At the moment of viewing, as opposed to the moment of production, the spectator is engaged in a number of mental operations. In the case of ‘visible trucages’ ‘the spectator undertakes a type of spontaneous sorting out of the visible material of which the text is composed and ascribes only a portion of it to the diegesis [the fictional world]’.14 In the case of the majority of effects usually termed, and regarded, as ‘special effects’, by contrast (the use of mattes, make-up, back projection, models and the like), ‘the spectator ascribes to the diegesis the totality of the visual elements furnished him’.15 Metz goes on to argue: In films of the fantastic, the impression of unreality is convincing only if the public has the feeling of partaking, not of some plausible illustration of a process obeying a nonhuman logic, but of a series of disquieting or ‘impossible’ events which nevertheless unfold before him in the guise of eventlike appearances.16\n\nThus here, once again, the spectator’s credibility is subject to division: ‘The spectator is not the victim of the machination to the point of being unaware that it exists, but he is not sufficiently conscious of it for it to lose its impact.’17 With this particular combination of forms of awareness and ‘impact’, we are back again at the point in The Thing at which the character utters his self-reflexive line. Here it is worth stressing, once more, the element of display the line involves. As Metz himself points out, while there is always a degree of duplicity, of secrecy, of the hidden attached to the use of special effects, there is always also ‘something which flaunts itself’.18 This flaunting both caters to – and counters – the spectator’s awareness, while ensuring at the same time that cinema will take the credit for the impact. Either way, cinema gains. It is worth also stressing that, of course, both the impact itself, and hence the liquid me ta l\n\n10/1/14 12:40:03\n\nall the splittings of belief which man will henceforth be capable of in the most varied domains, of all the infinitely complex unconscious and occasionally conscious interactions which he will allow himself between ‘believing’ and ‘not believing’ and which will on more than one occasion be of great assistance in resolving (or denying) delicate problems.20\n\nInasmuch as the institution of the cinema is one of the ‘domains’ to which Metz goes t h e sc i e n c e f i c ti o n f i l m reader\n\nLiquid_Metal_pages.indb 15\n\non to refer, a thesis such as this accounts both for the spectator’s general capacity to believe (and at the same time to know), and for the extent to which that capacity can be exercised, multiplied, doubled and redoubled in a genre like science fiction. It accounts, too, for the extent to which knowledge and belief are foregrounded – highlighted as issues – in science fiction films, the extent to which, for instance, as we have seen, the characters themselves have often to suspend disbelief, have often to undergo a process of learning, have often to revise the habitual basis of the judgements that they make. What it cannot do, though, is predict how any one individual film will draw on this capacity and deal with these issues. As a final comment, it is perhaps worth suggesting in this context that the more interesting films will be those which work not, like E.T. (1982), simply to affirm belief (and the cinema’s capacity to feed it), but those which, like Invasion of the Body Snatchers (in particular the 1956 version), work instead to link habitual perceptions, assumptions and judgements to issues and forms of social conformity – and in the process offer a challenge to both.\n\n‘You’ve Got To Be Fucking Kidding!’ Steve Neale\n\nparticular – and delicate – balance between impact and awareness, is always relative both to the capacities of cinema’s special effects regimes as they exist at any point in time, and to the amount of capital expended on effects in production. As has already been pointed out, The Thing is concerned, among other things, not only to display the latest special effects, but also to display an awareness that they are the latest. It is also concerned, like other, often cheaper, science fiction and horror films to build in an element of camp, a tongue-in-cheek knowingness. This element is designed to protect the spectator (and hence the film) both from disappointment, should the effects fail to convince, or should their convincingness serve merely to highlight the improbable nature of that which they are used to represent; and also from genuine trauma, should the effects and what they represent be taken too seriously. Metz draws on the psychoanalytic concept of disavowal, and on its model of the fetish, to pinpoint the nature of the divisions of knowledge and belief that the cinema, its fictions, and its special effects all, in their various ways, involve. Just as the fetish both avows and disavows an absence, a lack (the lack, for the fetishist proper, of the phallus wished for in the object of sexual desire), so the fictional representation, the cinematic image, and the special effect both avow and disavow something that does not actually exist.19 Although, as a clinical perversion, fetishism is a specific psychic formation (and practice), it is, like all perversions, only a particular response to a universal human experience (in this case the experience of castration of insufficiency, loss and lack); only a particularised extension of a universal disavowal (the disavowal of the lack of the phallus the mark of power and selfsufficiency initially imagined as belonging to the mother). It thus provides a paradigm for\n\nNotes 1 2 3 4 5\n\n6 7\n\nPhilip Brophy,‘Horrality – the Textuality of Contemporary Horror Films’, Screen, vol. 27, no. 1, 1986. Ibid., p. 11. Ibid.

It is worth pointing out here that the problem of improbability is common to a number of genres, including the horror film and what might be termed the fantasyadventure film (films like Jason of the Argonauts, Clash of the Titans and so on). It is no accident, therefore, that these genres often overlap (as in The Thing itself, on the one hand, and a film like Star Wars on the other). What, in part at least, distinguishes these genres from one another is the degree and the type of motivation, of justification, they offer for the extraordinary events and agents they portray. Science fiction, of course, justifies its improbabilities on ‘scientific’ (or quasi-scientific) grounds. It is worth pointing out also, though, that such a justification is as conventional, and itself as subject to judgements of improbability, as the supernatural\n\n15\n\n10/1/14 12:40:03\n\nthe wondeR of science fiction\n\njustifications of the gothic horror film, and that in the end, in any case, motivation is merely an alibi for the elaboration of aesthetic effects.

However, my intention is not to claim, as indeed some critics have, that ‘science fiction film … is an intellectual impossibility’.2 Clearly such a sweeping claim would be absurd, yet fans of science-fiction literature have lodged this complaint against science-fiction film frequently. For my purpose here, we might begin to hack our way through what Darko Suvin calls the ‘genealogical jungle’ of science fiction by distinguishing it from horror.3 Although the two genres share some of the same generic elements (iconography, character types, conventions), their treatment is notably different. So while the genres of science fiction and horror often overlap, even more so in film than in literature, the contrasts between them are rooted in the particular nature of sciencefiction film. Both science fiction and horror, along with fantasy, are types of narrative that have been called speculative fiction or structural fabulation.4 Horror and science fiction are both rooted in the real world: the former works by positing something as horrifying in contrast to the normal, quotidian world; the latter by acknowledging to some extent contemporary scientific knowledge and the scientific method. Hence the close relationship between the two genres. Such works as Mary Shelley’s novel Frankenstein (1817), Ridley Scott’s Alien (1979), and the two versions of The Thing (1951, 1982) have been categorised as both science fiction and horror, for all employ iconography and conventions found in both genres. By contrast, fantasy narratives are based neither in the natural world nor in the supernatural, but the supranatural. As Robert Heinlein notes,\n\ntthhee sc sciieennccee ffiiicti cctitioonn ffiillm m reader reader\n\nLiquid_Metal_pages.indb 17\n\nScience fiction and fantasy are as different as Karl Marx and Groucho Marx. Fantasy is constructed either by denying the real world in toto or at least by making a prime basis of the story one or more admittedly false premise – fairies, talking mules, trips through a looking glass, vampires, seacoast Bohemia, Mickey Mouse.5\n\nThe distinctive aim of fantasy, then, according to Lester del Rey, is to present ‘alternative impossibilities’.6 Despite the narrative relation between horror and science fiction, the two genres offer experiences and pleasures strikingly different, in fact almost opposite, in nature. As such critics as Robert Scholes and Bruce Kawin have argued, the appeal of science fiction is primarily cognitive, while horror, as the genre’s very name suggests, is essentially emotional.7 Linda Williams has discussed the horror film as a ‘body genre’ – that is, one of those genres (like pornography and melodrama) that works by eliciting pronounced emotional and physiological excitation. Science-fiction, by contrast, is often defined more cerebrally as a philosophical openness described as a ‘sense of wonder’. Science fiction critic Sam Moskowitz, quoting Rollo May, for example, invokes the phrase as the essential quality of science fiction and defines this sense of wonder as a heightened awareness and open attitude to new ideas.8 Science fiction, quite unlike fantasy and horror, works to entertain alternative possibilities. Perhaps, then, the fundamental distinction between the two genres is one of attitude: a closed response in horror, an open one in science fiction. Horror seeks to elicit terror and fear of something unknown or unacknowledged. According to Robin Wood’s highly influential Freudian/Marxist analysis of the horror film, the genre’s monsters represent a ‘return of the repressed’, forbidden desire disowned and projected outward by the protagonist.9 Accordingly, in horror stories narrative consciousness is often trapped or contained, set in claustrophobic, enclosed places, as in the countless castles, vaults, tombs and chambers that typify the genre’s dramatic spaces. And vision is often obscured, from Poe’s ‘The Pit and the Pendulum’ (1843) to John Carpenter’s The Fog (1979). Because the sleep of reason breeds monsters, horror tales emphasise darkness 17\n\n10/1/14 12:40:04\n\nthe wondeR of science fiction\n\nand night (Stephen King’s The Dark Half [1990], the numerous movies entitled Night of …) and superstition (Halloween [1978], Friday the 13th [1980] and the various Curse(s) of …). Tellingly, the narrator’s struggle in Poe’s story ‘Descent into the Maelstrom’ (1841) to employ empirical reasoning to prevent himself from being sucked below the surface is paradigmatic of the horror tale. By contrast, the rapt upward gaze of faces bathed in beatific light in Steven Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) is emblematic of the expansive thrust of science fiction. Vision in horror tales tends to focus down and inward, as in Poe’s ‘The Premature Burial’ (1844) or David Cronenberg’s Parasite Murders (a.k.a. Shivers/They Came From Within, 1975), while science fiction gazes up and out – from man’s one small step in Jules Verne’s From the Earth to the Moon (1865) to the giant step for mankind through the stargate in Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Kawin sums up the difference by comparing the last lines of The Thing – the dire warning ‘Keep watching the skies!’ – and Brainstorm (1983) – the hopeful and expansive invitation to ‘Look at the stars!’10 It is no coincidence that one of the first science fiction movies of the sound era was entitled Just Imagine (1930). For Damon Knight, ‘Some widening of the mind’s horizons, no matter in what direction’ is what science fiction is all about.11 In this sense science fiction narratives are, to use Méliès’s own phrase, voyages extraordinaires which, befitting their frequent setting in the future and/or on parallel worlds, emphasise the vastness of space and the fluidity of time. Thus in science fiction, narrative point of view expands to entertain rather than contain new possibilities.As in, say, Olaf Stapledon’s novel Last and First Men (1930) or H. G. Wells’s The Shape of Things to Come (1933) and the film version Things to Come (1936), which Wells scripted, the dramatic conflict in science fiction is quite often exactly this: the difficulty of accepting rather than combating forces larger than the individual will. According to Suvin, the genre works by providing us with an experience of ‘cognitive estrangement’: as in Russian Formalism, our attention is returned to reality by the premisses of science fiction tales, which make us question the givens of our world.12 In both Richard Matheson’s The Shrinking Man (1956) and the film adaptation The\n\nIncredible Shrinking Man (1957), the mental perspective of the protagonist expands even as his body dwindles. At first Scott Carey is terrified by the new, challenging world in which he finds himself, but ultimately he achieves spiritual transcendence. His epiphanic perception, on the novel’s final page, is that he has moved from the ‘universe without’ to the ‘universe within’: ‘Why had he never thought of it; of the microscopic and the submicroscopic worlds? … He’d always thought in terms of man’s concept, not nature’s … But to nature there was no zero. Existence went on in endless cycles’ (or, as the film concludes: ‘To God there is no zero’).13 The horrible dangers of an enlarged world are embodied in both novel and film in the spectacular form of a spider that comes to seem monstrously large. Both horror and science fiction make generic claims to monster movies – ‘the Creature film sits (awkwardly, for some) between horror and SF’, observes Vivian Sobchack14 – but they are represented quite differently in the two genres. This difference follows from their respective orientations of vision. In horror, creatures are monstrous violations of ideological norms, while in science fiction monsters are often simply a different life form. Because of this difference in the treatment of the Other, as Sobchack observes, horror monsters threaten the disruption of moral and natural order, while those of science fiction address the disruption of the social order.15 So the monsters of horror are typically abject, sometimes explicitly unnameable, as in Stephen King’s It (1986); but in science fiction they may be subjects of rational scrutiny, as in John W. Campbell Jr’s novella ‘Who Goes There?’ (1938), the source of both versions of The Thing. Because the monsters of horror commonly represent ‘the return of the repressed’, they tend to be anthropomorphic (the vampire, the zombie, the mummy) and animalistic (the wolf man, cat people), to spring from our physical nature, albeit in unnatural or ‘interstitial’ form.16 The Other of science fiction, however, frequently takes nonhumanoid forms, whether animal (War of the Worlds, 1953), vegetable (The Andromeda Strain, 1970) or mineral (The Monolith Monsters, 1957). The fundamental difference between science fiction and horror is conventionally\n\n18\n\nLiquid_Metal_pages.indb 18\n\n10/1/14 12:40:04\n\nt h e s c i e n c e f icti o n f i l m reader\n\nLiquid_Metal_pages.indb 19\n\nIn cinema, narration proceeds by manipulating time and space, clongating and condensing both for dramatic and affective purposes. The techniques for achieving such spatial and temporal distortions constitute the foundation of classic narrative film, but such manipulations are central to documentary and experimental cinema as well. Across the range of different film practices the camera, the recording apparatus itself, seems capable of moving through both dimensions at once. Terry Ramsaye has noted how much the cinema resembles a time machine in his discussion of H. G. Wells’s description of travelling through time in The Time Machine (1895).19 (Later in the year Wells’s book was published, inventor William Paul, whom Wells knew, applied for a patent for a machine that would provide simulated voyages through time.) The cinematic machine, like the Constructors in Stanislaw Lem’s novel The Cyberiad (1967), is a device capable of imagining and ‘building’ (through special effects) other machines infinitely more sophisticated than itself. Science fiction film has relied heavily on special effects, and these effects in turn constitute one of the particular pleasures of the genre. The genre’s reliance on special effects is itself an enactment of science fiction’s thematic concern with technology. It is therefore understandable that for many viewers the value of (that is to say, the pleasure derived from) science fiction movies is determined by the quality (synonymous with believability) of the special effects. For these viewers, nothing destroys the pleasure of a science fiction movie more than seeing the ‘seams’ in a matte shot or glimpsing the zipper on an alien’s bodysuit. Even Richard Hodgens, an apparent purist who bemoans the lack of scientific knowledge in science fiction movies, seems to confuse the failure of some films’ special effects to be ‘convincing’ with the plausibility and consistency of their narrative premises.20 Special effects are ‘filmic moments of a radically filmic character’,21 for they seek to achieve unreality as realistically as possible – to engage ‘our belief, not our suspension of disbelief’, as Sobchack puts it. We marvel at special effects images at once for their fantastic content and for the power of their realisation. They announce the powers of cinema while, paradoxically, taming the imagination through the very fact of visual representation. This\n\n‘Sensuous Elaboration’ Barry Keith Grant\n\nrepresented within the two genres themselves as a differing emphasis on the mind (science fiction) and the body (horror). Science fiction focuses on heady issues, as in such movies as The Brain from Planet Arous (1958) and The Mind of Mr Soames (1969). The premiss in Poul Anderson’s novel Brain Wave (1954) is that the human race is suddenly confronted"
