Lattuada: I made (…) La nostra guerra because I wanted to show that a little squad of [Italian] soldiers went with the English 8th Army to the North, to show that Italy too, with a minimal army, participated; they were not partisans, they were just volunteers who went together with the 8th Army, and at the end arrived in Milan. This film was put together with all that we could find, occasionally things directed in Rome. And also bits that we had asked for from some who, dressed as volunteers, but not soldiers, not partisans, went to the North with the 8th Army. Pietrangeli also wrote the commentary and Serandrei edited it. Then we showed it.

Gobetti: And the shooting?

Lattuada: All done in Rome. And every now and then it gets shown a little all over the world, because there are requests from here and there. It is conserved in the Cineteca Italiana in Milano, where Gianni Comencini directs everything.

Gobetti: And the Cineteca Italiana?

Lattuada: It was evacuated to the north, in a shack in the country; we had not yet brought it to Milan. We took it into the country; all the films were in a shack. Everyone, even my aunt, helped to carry the boxes.
