Directed by Luchino Visconti

Director Luchino Visconti employs the story of lust and greed at the pulpy heart of James M. Cain’s novel, “The Postman Always Rings Twice,” as a framework to present the poverty and decay of the Po River Valley in the starkest terms. In so doing, he earned the ire of the fascist government, which banned the film, and set the terms for the neo-realist movement to follow.
