        "text": "Mario Bava\n\nMario Bava (San Remo, 1914) died in Rome 1980. His father was a camera person at the time of silent movies and passed down to Mario his passion for the cinema as well as a love for painting and an interest in everything that is connected with images. Until 1960 he worked as director of photography. In the 1940s he directed a few short films. He debuted as a director with Black Sunday, today still considered his masterpiece. Subsequently, he started to make color films and began to make a long series of gothic horror films that have largely been overlooked in Italian criticism. His cinema has earned a healthy reputation abroad and has been subjected to an important re-evaluation over the last thirty years.\n\nFILMOGRAFIA"
