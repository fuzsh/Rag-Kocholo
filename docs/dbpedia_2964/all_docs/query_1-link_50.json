        "text": "67. One should note here the caution that is required in using judicial materials as sources of historical fact finding. The decision just cited states, at para. 6, as an argument to quash the decision of the judge of the preliminary hearing, that the 1952 final decision in the Kappler case (see above, note 49) had reversed the prior decisions as regards the legitimacy, from a ius in bello perspective, of the via Rasella attack. The 1999 decision states, literally: “The Supreme Military Court, with its decision 25–10–1952, n.1711 (Rassegna della Giustizia Militare, 83) has overturned this thesis, declaring the reprisal unlawful in relation to the lawfulness of the Italian action: ‘Via Rasella, in light of the norms of international law, must be evaluated with rigorous coherence. It cannot be characterized otherwise than an act of hostility against the occupation armed forces, committed by persons who possessed the status of legitimate belligerents.’” If one consults the 1952 decision as printed in the law review (published by the Italian Ministry of Defense in a special issue in 1996 devoted entirely to war crimes trials) one finds the phrase as transcribed. But when one goes to verify the text of the decision by examining it as published in many law reviews in the year 1953, one realizes that its sense is opposite, because the 1996 reprint omitted a “not.” The correct phrase—completely consistent with the context of the decision—is, therefore: “committed by persons who did not possess the status of legitimate belligerents” [emphasis supplied]. To make things even more complicated, for unknown reasons the whole phrase was omitted in the on line text of the 1999 decision published on the Italian Ministry of Defense web site, http://www.difesa.it/GiustiziaMilitare/RassegnaGM/Processi/Priebke_Erich/Pagine/17_23-02-99.aspx (September 8, 2012). After notification by the authors of this article, it was eventually corrected in January 2012. The mistaken quote in the 1996 decision has been repeatedly used in many writings and public debates as the judicial seal on the historical truth of the via Rasella attack: see ex multis Luigi Miragliuolo, “I fascisti fornirono perfino scorte armate ai treni per Auschwitz,” http://www.storiaxxisecolo.it/deportazione/deportazionefascismo1l.htm (September 8, 2012); Raimondo Ricci, “Processo alle stragi naziste? Il caso ligure. I fascicoli occultati e le illegittime archiviazioni,” http://www.istitutoresistenza-ge.it/Pubblicazioni/ricci.html (September 8, 2012); http://www.finanzaonline.com/forum/arena-politica/1231494-priebke-bisogna-avere-pieta-per-chi-non-e-ha-mai-avuta-8.html (September 8, 2012); and http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=143733 (September 8, 2012). All of this helps us to understand how much the historical debate regarding Via Rasella remains a heated topic in Italy, more than 65 years after the fact. For an interesting insight into how the extremely detailed entry on via Rasella in Wikipedia (http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatti_di_via_Rasella [September 8, 2012]) was debated, see http://www.territorioscuola.com/wikipedia/?title=Discussione:Attentato_di_via_Rasella (September 8, 2012). For a literary account of how history can be changed by the insertion or the omission of a “not” see novel, José Saramago's, The History of the Siege of Lisbon (New York: Harcourt Brace, 1996).Google Scholar\n\n140.

Similar words can be found in Irving v. Penguin Books, Lipstadt (2000) England and Wales High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division 115 (leave to appeal denied in [2001] England and Wales Court of Appeals Civ. 1197): “Needless to say, the context in which these issues fall to be determined is one which arouses the strongest passion. On that account, it is important that I stress at the outset of this judgment that I do not regard it as being any part of my function as the trial judge to make findings of fact as to what did and what did not occur during the Nazi regime in Germany. It will be necessary for me to rehearse, at some length, certain historical data. The need for this arises because I must evaluate the criticisms of or (as Irving would put it) the attack upon his conduct as an historian in the light of the available historical evidence. But it is not for me to form, still less to express, a judgment about what happened. That is a task for historians. It is important that those reading this judgment should bear well in mind the distinction between my judicial role in resolving the issues arising between these parties and the role of the historian seeking to provide an accurate narrative of past events” (Gray J.).\n\n150. See, for a clear example, the critical analysis of the Priebke trial provided by Battini, Michele and Pezzino, Paolo, Guerra ai civili. Occupazione tedesca e politica del massacro. Toscana 1944 (Venice: Marsilio, 1997), 223–51Google Scholar, 253–58. The two historians argue that the reconstruction of the Ardeatine Caves massacre offered by the court was not entirely convincing, as the judges omitted to hear from Col. Dietrich Beelitz––Field Marshal Kesselring's chief of operations––as a witness. Col. Beelitz, informed by Gen. Mälzer of the attack on via Rasella while the Field Marshal was away from headquarters, telephoned the news to the German Armed Forces Supreme Command and witnessed the discussions that preceded the decision to execute ten Italians for every German killed. The authors conclude that by hearing from Col. Beelitz as a witness––as occurred in other proceedings––the judges could have ascertained the responsibility of the Wehrmacht (and of Field Marshal Kesselring in particular) for the reprisal and the massacre of hundreds of innocent civilians."
