        "text": "As pundits made their Golden Lion predictions in the last days of the Venice Film Festival, the general consensus was that it all depended on what kind of mood Damien Chazelle’s competition jury was in: playful, in which case Yorgos Lanthimos’s early critical darling “Poor Things” would sweep to victory; or sober, which could tilt the prize toward either of two urgent films about the global migrant crisis, breaking later in the fest, Matteo Garrone’s “Me Captain” and Agnieszka Holland’s “Green Border.”\n\nIn the end, the jury split the difference, handing major prizes to all three films, plus Ryusuke Hamaguchi’s quiet, cryptic environmental fable “Evil Does Not Exist.” But playfulness ultimately pulled ahead. “Poor Things,” a delirious adult fantasy starring Emma Stone as a horny Frankenwoman on a wild coming-of-age journey, took the Golden Lion for best film of the festival, making good on the breathless buzz surrounding it since its premiere in the early days of the festival.\n\nLanthimos’s lavish, Searchlight Pictures-backed film was met with one of the most unilaterally glowing receptions for any Venice premiere in recent memory, as critics and audiences alike thrilled to its bawdy, offbeat comedy, dazzling visual spectacle and pointed message of feminist empowerment. In a rave review, Variety’s critic described it as “a vast absurdist odyssey, positively compact at a galloping 141 minutes, that takes in a groaning buffet of settings and ripe secondary characters — all played with relish by a dream ensemble.” Said ensemble also includes Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe, Ramy Youssef and Jerrod Carmichael.\n\nLanthimos’s win comes five years after he took the runner-up Grand Jury Prize for his dizzy royalty farce “The Favourite,” which also took Best Actress for Olivia Colman, en route to an awards-season run that culminated in 10 Oscar nominations and a win for Colman. Searchlight, which also steered “The Favourite,” will be planning another full-steam campaign in pretty much all categories for “Poor Things,” which was also celebrated Telluride and will next play at the New York Film Festival; it hits theatres Stateside on December 8.\n\nProducer-star Stone’s tour-de-force as a literal woman-child, evolving before our eyes, may have been one of the most discussed performances of the festival — but with Venice rules dictating that the Golden Lion champ can’t win anything else, that cleared the way for another Best Actress victor. The beneficiary was a fellow American: 25-year-old Cailee Spaeny, a revelation to many as the young Priscilla Presley in Sofia Coppola’s intimate biopic “Priscilla,” which calls on the star to play Elvis Presley’s ex-wife from her early teens to her early thirties. Variety’s Owen Gleiberman praised Spaeny for “[making] Priscilla a figure of strength, but the force of her performance is how she enacts her slow-motion melancholy.” In a brief, overwhelmed speech, Spaeny dedicated her award to Presley “for trusting me with something truly complex, so personal and difficult.”\n\nGiving the night’s longest and most impassioned speech, Peter Sarsgaard won Best Actor for his turn as a dementia-stricken New York widower in Michel Franco’s “Memory,” a performance deemed “unforgettable” by Peter Debruge in his Variety review. In one of multiple allusions during the ceremony to the ongoing WGA and SAG strikes, an emotional Sarsgaard said, “All of the issues regarding fair pay are important, but the issue that’s stuck with me is AI,” elaborating that “the work we do is about connection, this animated space between us.” “If we lose that battle, our industry will be the first of many to fall,” he warned, concluding that “disconnection paves the way for atrocities.” He shared his award, he said, with co-star Jessica Chastain: “People talk about losing themselves in roles, but we found ourselves in ours.”\n\nJapanese director Hamaguchi, an Oscar winner last year for his Chekhov-inspired intimate epic “Drive My Car,” won the Grand Jury Prize for “Evil Does Not Exist,” a thorny parable protesting capitalist development of rural environments that drew much admiration from critics — as well as extensive debate over its ambiguous, enigmatic ending. Variety’s Jessica Kiang described it as [a swing] away from its prior axis of cautious, melancholy optimism toward something far colder, wintrier and more fraught.” The film likely won’t unite opinion as much as “Drive My Car” did, but it looks to be one of the major arthouse conversation pieces of the next year.\n\nOf the two migrant-themed films, Garrone’s sweeping “Me Captain” was the most successful, taking two prizes: Best Director for the Italian auteur, and Best Young Actor for its remarkable teenage lead Seydou Sarr, a TikTok star in his native Senegal, and fully commanding as a vulnerable boy on an arduous journey across Africa, in an attempt to cross to Italy. Veteran Polish director Holland had to settle for the Special Jury Prize for her harrowing “Green Border,” a portrait of a Syrian family fleeing ISIS for Belarus, which many presumed was Lanthimos’s chief obstacle to the Golden Lion. In a staunchly political speech, Holland called out European leaders for failing to assist in the crisis, “not because we don’t have the resources, but because we don’t want to.”\n\nRounding out the Competition awards, Best Screenplay went to Chilean director Pablo Larraín and co-writer Guillermo Calderón for a very different political statement: the Netflix-produced “El Conde,” a pitch-black comic horror which images former dictator Augusto Pinochet still roaming the earth as a very thirsty vampire. Offering a shoutout to striking WGA scribes, Larraín pledged his “passion and compassion for the writers.”\n\nAnother political comedy, Hungarian director Gabor Reisz’s sprawlingly ambitious “Explanation for Everything,” took the top prize in the festival’s secondary Horizons competition; Variety’s critic praised the “confidently imposing” film about a right-wing media circus surrounding a high-schooler’s failed finals exam, as “escalatingly absurd but underpinned by a mordant plausibility throughout.” In something of a surprise, the Luigi De Laurentiis Award for Best Debut Feature went to Taiwanese actor-director Lee Hong-Chi’s film “Love is a Gun,” which premiered outside the festival’s official selection, in the Critics’ Week sidebar.\n\nThe top prize on the festival’s VR-oriented Venice Immersive sidebar, meanwhile, went to Dutch director Celine Daemen’s highly inventive “Song for a Passerby,” which encourages viewers to watch themselves as ghosts, or to see themselves as elements in a dreamworld — something that could also be said for Lanthimos’s triumphant vision.\n\nFULL LIST OF WINNERS\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nGolden Lion for Best Film: “Poor Things,” Yorgos Lanthimos\n\nGrand Jury Prize: “Evil Does Not Exist,” Ryusuke Hamaguchi\n\nSilver Lion for Best Director: “Me Captain,” Matteo Garrone\n\nSpecial Jury Prize: “Green Border,” Agnieszka Holland\n\nBest Screenplay: “El Conde,” Guillermo Calderón, Pablo Larraín\n\nVolpi Cup for Best Actress: “Priscilla,” Cailee Spaeny\n\nVolpi Cup for Best Actor: “Memory,” Peter Sarsgaard\n\nMarcello Mastroianni Award for Best Young Actor: “Me Captain,” Seydou Sarr\n\nHORIZONS\n\nBest Film: “Explanation for Everything,” Gabor Reisz\n\nBest Director: “Paradise is Burning,” Mika Gustafson\n\nSpecial Jury Prize: “An Endless Sunday,” Alain Parroni\n\nBest Actress: “El Paraiso,” Margarita Rosa De Francisco\n\nBest Actor: “City of Wind,” Tergel Bold-Erdene\n\nBest Screenplay: “El Paraiso,” Enrico Maria Artale\n\nBest Short Film: “A Short Trip,” Erenik Beqiri\n\nLION OF THE FUTURE\n\nLuigi de Laurentiis Award for Best Debut Feature: “Love is a Gun,” Lee Hong-Chi\n\nHORIZONS EXTRA\n\nAudience Award: “Felicita,” Micaela Ramazzotti\n\nVENICE CLASSICS\n\nBest Documentary on Cinema: “Thank You Very Much,” Alex Braverman\n\nBest Restored Film: “Moving,” Shinji Sōmai\n\nVENICE IMMERSIVE\n\nGrand Jury Prize: “Song for a Passerby,” Celine Daemen\n\nSpecial Jury Prize: “Flow,” Adriaan Lokman\n\nAchievement Prize: “Emperor,” Marion Burger, Ilan Cohen\n\nVENICE DAYS (announced earlier)\n\nGdA Director’s Award: “Humanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person,” Ariane Louis-Seize\n\nAudience Award: “Through the Night,” Delphine Girard\n\nEuropa Cinemas Label Award: “Photophobia,” Ivan Ostrochovsky, Pavol Pekarčík\n\nCRITICS’ WEEK (announced earlier)\n\nGrand Prize: “Malqueridas,” Tana Gilbert\n\nSpecial Mention: Saura Lightfoot Leon in “Hoard” and Ariane Labed in “The Vourdalak,” for their performances\n\nAudience Award: “Hoard,” Luna Carmoon\n\nVerona Film Club Award for Most Innovative Film: “Hoard,” Luna Carmoon\n\nMario Serandrei – Hotel Saturnia Award for Best Technical Contribution: “Malqueridas,” Tana Gilbert\n\nBest Short Film: “The Lost Memories of Trees,” Antonio Le Camera\n\nBest Director (Short Film): “Ender’s Line,” Gabriele Biasi\n\nBest Technical Contribution (Short Film): “We Should All Be Futurists,” Angela Norelli\n\nCOLLATERAL AWARDS (announced earlier)\n\nFIPRESCI Award: “Evil Does Not Exist,” Ryusuke Hamaguchi\n\nFIPRESCI Award for Best Film from Orizzonti and Parallel Sections: “An Endless Sunday,” Alain Parroni\n\nQueer Lion Award: “Housekeeping for Beginners,” Goran Stolevski\n\nARCA CinemaGiovani Awards\n\nBest Film in Venice: “Green Border,” Agnieszka Holland\n\nBest Italian Film in Venice: “El Praiso,” Enrico Maria Artale\n\nAuthors Under 40 Awards\n\nBest Directing and Screenwriting: Luna Carmoon, “Hoard”\n\nBest Screenwriting: Mika Gustafson, “Paradise is Burning”\n\nSpecial Mention: “Humanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person,” Ariane Louis-Seize, Christine Doyon\n\nSpecial Mention for Editing: “Malqueridas,” Javira Velozo, Tana Gilbert\n\nBrian Award: “Tatami,” Guy Nattiv, Zar Amir Ebrahimi\n\nPietro Bianchi Award: Sergio Castellitto\n\nXXXV CICT – UNESCO Enrico Fulchignoni Award: “Me Captain,” Matteo Garrone\n\nCinema & Arts Awards\n\nBest Films: “Backstage,” Afef Ben Mahmoud, Khalil Benkirane;
