        "text": "140 min. Italian.\n\nGiovanna, a petrol station owner’s wife, meets drifter Gino in the Po Delta. She wants to escape her dreary life at the side of her dull husband and demands unconditional love from Gino. Regarded as a precursor to neorealism, Visconti’s adaptation of the novel by James M. Cain pares down its crime fiction tropes to concentrate more on its melodramatic and existential aspects: the barren landscapes provide the framework for and confines of passions that neither help people escape material poverty nor social constraints. Visconti contrasts the realism of the locations with the artificiality of his mise-en-scène, creating brief moments in which the characters detach themselves from their world. In Italy, the film was cut by almost 40 minutes on \"moral grounds\". The version being screened here is the most extensive version of the film to date. (ab)\n\nLuchino Visconti was born in Milan in 1906. After extensive travelling, Visconti first lived in Paris in 1936, where he worked as an assistant to Jean Renoir. At the end of the 1930s, Visconti moved to Rome and took part in various film projects. In 1942, he completed his debut film Ossessione. Visconti then directed films that contributed to the birth of Italian neorealism. From the 1960s onwards, his film work primarily focused on the world of the upper middle class and the nobility. His films include literary adaptations such as Il Gattopardo and the so-called 'German Trilogy' (La caduta degli dei, Morte a Venezia, Ludwig). Visconti also directed numerous plays and operas. He died in Rome in 1976.\n\nLuchino Visconti: My path to OSSESSIONE\n\n[…] The term “neorealism” arose from correspondence I conducted with Mario Serandrei, who is still my editor today. He saw the first rushes of OSSESSIONE and wrote me a long letter in which, among other things, he elucidated, “This film genre, which I see for the first time… I would call ‘neo-realistic’.” And that’s where the expression “neorealism” comes from; it was first coined for OSSESSIONE. (...)\n\n(Giuseppe Ferrara: Entretien avec Luchino Visconti, Paris 1963; quoted in: Ulrich Gregor: Aspekte des italienischen Films 1, Bad Ems 1969, p. 58)\n\nA veristic picture of Italy today\n\n[…] Right around the year 1940, interest in contemporary North American literature began to blossom among Italian intellectuals. For the first time, Italian translations of the works of Faulkner, Hemingway and Steinbeck appeared; Italian authors like Vittorini began translating American texts themselves or, like Pavese, wrote essays on the literature of the United States.\n\nIn the face of the sterile art doctrine of Fascism, a breath of liberation emanated from this literature: here, all of a sudden, one felt the presence of real life and veracity also in depicting social oppositions whose mention Fascist cultural policy had rendered taboo. In the world of the American novels, the Italians ultimately discovered their own contemporary reality. We have to keep this in mind if we want to understand the reasons and the literary “climate” that led Visconti to shoot his film OSSESSIONE after James M. Cain’s novel “The Postman Always Rings Twice”. It wasn’t so much the criminal intrigue or the hardly outstanding stylistic qualities of the literary model that mattered to Visconti, but the chance the novel provided to sketch a naturalistic picture of Italy that would radically differ from the conventional, mythical Italy of white telephones, salons, and trains running on time that the official cinema of that time propagated. […]\n\nWhat Visconti primarily succeeded in doing in OSSESSIONE was to paint a veristic, true-to-life, true-to-milieu panorama of life in the Italian provinces, as had never been seen in Italian film. OSSESSIONE reveals for the first time the contemporary reality of an Italy that is undisguised, un-rhetorical and far removed from all the official clichés, exposed in downright dismal narrowness. In 1942, that was a revolution. Visconti brought to the screen the décor of the poorly maintained provincial houses, the rural roads, the popular festivals with their singing contests, the city squares of Ancona and Ferrara, the sandbanks and river levees with an intensity and documentary gift for observation whose power has not faded in the least to this day. He did not employ these décors as a picturesque background, but understood how to tie milieu and nature with personality, with the character of his protagonists. Visconti’s characters in OSSESSIONE are rooted in and live from the northern Italian landscape. Visconti unfolds this landscape in long tracking shots and pans that replace the dissociating montage that he learned from the French, namely from Renoir. With this technique, Visconti was able to reflect and interweave milieu-defining details, characteristic aspects of the landscape, and certain aspects of his characters’ psychological behaviour. It is telling, incidentally, that Visconti mostly did without close-ups of faces and rather left the persons in the context of their milieu, which resulted in magnificent scenes, true anthology sequences of film history […].\n\n(Ulrich Gregor, Von OSSESSIONE zu LA TERRA TREMA, Kinemathek, No. 32, February 1967, Infoblatt No. 5, 1.
