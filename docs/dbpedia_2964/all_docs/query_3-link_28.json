        "text": "Roger William Corman\n\n(April 5, 1926 – May 9, 2024)\n\nThe great producer/director/cultural icon Roger Corman has passed away at 98. It might take us months to fully comprehend what a big deal that is.\n\nAs for me, I can remember exactly when Mr. Corman became part (a big fat part) of my Movie Life.\n\nEvery summer growing up, we’d head to Strawn, Texas, and stay a few weeks with my grandparents. Being a movie-collecting family, and this being the pre-home video 1970s, we would pack a 16mm projector and a stack of prints for the trip. One particular summer, when I was 10 or 11, one of the films that made the trek (in a Chevrolet station wagon) was Roger Corman’s Pit And The Pendulum (1961). (Budd Boetticher’s Buchanan Rides Alone was there, too.)\n\nStrawn is a tiny town of about 850 people — a couple hours West of Dallas. My grandfather, AG “Flint” McCullough, was a real cowboy — he trained cutting horses. My grandmother, Zelma McCullough, worked in Strawn’s lone grocery store. They were wonderful people.\n\nSummers in Strawn get really, really hot. And sitting under the window-unit air conditioner at my grandparents’ house, watching Pit And The Pendulum projected onto the bright white living room wall, was a nice way to beat the heat.\n\nI ran that print of Pit And The Pendulum several times over those three weeks — on one of those green Bell & Howell projectors some of us remember from high school. I can still hear its clicky purr mixed with the hum of the A/C. Can recall the brownish color of the slightly-faded ‘Scope print. (No telling what it looks like now.) And can still recite a lot of its dialogue.\n\nWatching that film so many times, I started to get a sense of how movies work. The power of cutting to a closeup. How the lack of light can be more impactful than the presence of it. Just what music can do. How widescreen (Panavision, in this case) can be used to startling effect. And on and on.\n\nThis sent me digging for any Corman movie I could find, which in those days meant learning his filmography and scouring the TV Guide, hoping to happen upon something. I read Ed Naha’s book on Corman over and over.\n\nRoger Corman not only taught me about movies, he taught me to love them. I really owe him an awful lot.\n\nAs the major studios abandon their classic films on DVD, Blu-Ray and 4K, smaller, independent firms are coming along to take up some of the slack — loading up collectors’ shelves and showing the majors how to treat a film, ANY film, with respect. One of the companies to watch is Film Masters. They’re announcing titles at a rapid pace (“like the Russians are in Jersey,” to quote Gene Hackman in The French Connection), with the latest being an actual double feature from 1961, The Devil’s Partner and Creature From The Haunted Sea.\n\nThe Devil’s Partner\n\nDirected by Charles R. Rondeau\n\nStarring Ed Nelson, Edgar Buchanan, Jean Allison, Richard Crane, Byron Foulger\n\nThis tale of devil worship and demonic possession in a small town in New Mexico was produced in 1958. Gene and Roger Corman bought it release in a twin bill (from their company Filmgroup) with their own picture, Creature From The Haunted Sea. It’s a pretty solid little movie, with some terrific character actors like Edgar Buchanan and Byron Foulger.\n\nCreature From The Haunted Sea\n\nProduced & Directed by Roger Corman\n\nStarring Antony Carbone, Betsy Jones-Moreland, Edward Wain\n\nWritten by Charles Griffith in a week (so Corman could get some tax incentives while making a couple films in Puerto Rico) and shot in five days, Creature From The Haunted Sea is part crime picture, part monster movie — and a total hoot all the way through. A few years later, Corman had Monte Hellman shoot some additional scenes to pad it out for TV.\n\nFilm Masters is pulling out all the stops, again. You get both versions of Creature From The Haunted Sea (theatrical and TV), commentaries, an essay and a documentary from Ballyhoo on Filmgroup. Coming in January 2024.\n\nKnowing these films, and knowing what to expect from Film Masters, this comes highly recommended.\n\nDirected by Antonio Margheriti (Anthony Dawson)\n\nStory & Screenplay by Vassily Petrov\n\nCinematography: Marcello Masciocchi\n\nEdited by Mario Serandrei\n\nMusic by Mario Migliard\n\nCast: Claude Rains (Professor Benson), Bill Carter (Cmdr. Robert Cole), Maya Brent (Eve Barnett), Umberto Orsini (Dr. Fred Steele), Jacqueline Derval (Mrs. Collins)\n\nAntonio Margheriti’s first film as director, Assignment: Outer Space (1960, AKA Space-Men) did well, so Titanus (there’s no producer credited on these films) gave him a bit more to work with for the next one, which ended up being Battle Of The Worlds (1961). The most obvious thing to come from that boost in budget was hiring Claude Rains, who does a lot more for the film than it does for him.\n\nRains plays Professor Benson, a cantankerous old genius who’s been watching another planet, which he calls “The Outsider,” approach the earth. Scientists from a space station near Mars consult with Rains, who predicts The Outsider will come close to the earth, but pass by without hitting it. They doubt him, but when it turns out he’s right, everybody’s relieved. Whew! Then it alters its course and settles into an orbit around the earth. That’s not a very planet-y thing to do.\n\nRains decides some sort of intelligence is controlling The Outsider and tells the scientists it needs to be destroyed right away. Again, the professor is ignored.\n\nSpaceships are sent out to investigate — and they’re promptly destroyed by a fleet of flying saucers that come swarming out of The Outsider. Whatever this thing is, it’s got some vile ideas about the earth. Now, everybody’s more than willing to listen to Rains. And he knows exactly what needs to be done.\n\nLike most Italian science fiction movies, Battle Of The Worlds is pretty odd. At times, it doesn’t make a lot of sense. The budget limitations are painfully obvious. The acting is, for the most part, pretty bad (hard to tell with all the dubbing). And the pacing is weird. But like Margheriti’s previous picture, there’s something about it that I find really, really cool.\n\nAll of Margheriti’s sci-fi pictures of the 60s demonstrate his love of science fiction, which makes up for most of the film’s deficiencies. The special effects run hot and cold. Maybe that’s being generous, but I prefer them that way. Battle Of The Worlds is jam-packed with ideas and creativity, which are far more valuable than a several million bucks worth of CGI.\n\nClaude Rains is a lot of fun in this thing. He’s pretty over-the-top, playing an eccentric scientist a lot like the one he played in the remake of The Lost World (1960, he was Professor Challenger in that one). Rains demanded that his scenes for Battle Of The Worlds be shot with sound, rather than the Italian way of dubbing everything in later. English-speaking actors were used frequently. All this makes a big difference in how the film plays.\n\nMargheriti and cinematographer Marcello Masciocchi are very inventive with their camerawork. Odd angles and unusual lens choices give the picture a very distinct, other-wordly look — and help disguise the lack of funds.\n\nIn 1963, Topaz Film Corporation paired Battle Of The Worlds with another Italian picture, Atom Age Vampire (1960). They played drive-ins for years before winding up on television. That’s where I caught up with it, on a local station late one night in the mid-70s.\n\nNow let’s get to the new Blu-Ray from The Film Detective. An original 35mm print from the American Topaz release was used. While the picture played Italy in Technicolor, it criss-crossed the US in Eastman Color — and that’s what we see here. The folks at The Film Detective have cleaned up the print quite a bit — it’s sharp as a tack, very steady and with minimal splices. The color has faded a bit toward that Eastman Color’s weird, sickly, pinkish brown, however. That’s a shame, but what we have here is far, far superior to what we’ve been suffering through for decades (see the above comparison, from The Film Detective YouTube channel). It’s not perfect, but I’m so happy to have it. (Having grown up watching lots of film prints, mostly 16mm, I have a soft spot for a few light lines, some grain and a bit of fading. It’s part of the film experience, and I like being reminded of it every now and then.) I’m so thankful that companies like The Film Detective are willing to do the sleuthing necessary to find the best available material for films like this, then taking on the costly clean-up work needed for a nice DVD/Blu-Ray release.\n\nThe supplements are quite nice. There’s a half-hour piece on Antonio Margheriti from Ballyhoo and Tim Lucas. It’s excellent. There’s also a commentary by Justin Humphreys, and a nice essay in the booklet.\n\nI’ve been a fan of Battle Of The Worlds since I saw it on TV. For years, I’ve wanted it to make it to DVD or Blu-Ray in a version that reflected what it looked like back in 1961 (or ’63). This isn’t perfect, but I love it. I’ve been on a Margheriti sci-fi mini-binge of late, so the timing with this is perfect. A big thanks to folks at The Film Detective, and a big recommendation to all y’all out there."
