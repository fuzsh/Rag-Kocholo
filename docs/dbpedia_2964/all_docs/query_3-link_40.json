        "text": "In this interview, Roberto Chiesi talks about the personal and professional relationship between Pier Paolo Pasolini and Federico Fellini. He describes their experience with neorealism and how each of them moved past it to develop an original and unique cinematographic style. He focuses on specific elements of their cinema, such as the importance of the oneiric dimension and their conception of the sacred. Chiesi explains the central role civic involvement had in the work of Pasolini; his last movie Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma (Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom) (Pasolini 1975) is centred on the dramatic process of degradation caused by the new consumeristic ideology. Fellini, instead, was primarily concerned with the corruptive vulgarity of the new commercial television. Highlighting the importance of\n\nMario Masini is an active figure of Roman experimental cinema; alongside Paolo Brunatto, Alberto Grifi and Alfredo Leonardi, Mario Masini began his career as a director with two short films: Il sogno di Anita (‘Anita’s dream’) (1963); Immagine del Tempo (‘Images of time’) (1964) – from the title of a lithography by Emilio Vedova; and one feature-length film X chiama Y (‘X calls Y’) (1968). Masini collaborated with Carmelo Bene on the cinematography of Nostra Signora dei Turchi (Our Lady of the Turks) (1968), Il barocco leccese (Lecce’s Baroque) (1968), Don Giovanni (1970), Salom (1972) and Un Amleto di meno (One Hamlet Less) (1973). Masini was the cameraman of Paolo and Vittorio Taviani’s San Michele aveva un gallo (Saint Michael Had a Rooster) (1973) and Padre Padrone (Father and Master) (1977), which was awarded the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival. He was the cinematographer for Haile Gerima’s Teza (Morning Dew), which received the Special Jury Prize at the Venice International Film Festival (2008). His film Der rote Schal (‘The red scarf’) was released in 2018. In this interview Mario Masini discusses his participation in Roman experimental cinema as well as his cooperation with other artists such as Carmelo Bene.\n\nItalian filmmaker Federico Fellini (1920-1993) is one of the most renowned figures in world cinema. Director of a long list of critically acclaimed motion pictures, including La strada, La dolce vita, 8½, and Amarcord, Fellini's success helped strengthen the international prestige of Italian cinema from the 1950s onward. Often remembered as an eccentric auteur with a vivid imagination and a penchant for quasi-autobiographical works, the carnivalesque, and Rubenesque women, Fellini's inimitable films celebrate the creative potential of cinema as a medium and also provide thought-provoking evocations of various periods in Italian history, from the years of fascism to the age of Silvio Berlusconi's media empire. In Making a Film Fellini discusses his childhood and adolescence in the coastal town of Rimini, the time he spent as a cartoonist, journalist, and screenwriter in Rome, his decisive encounter with Roberto Rossellini, and his own movies, from Variety Lights to Casanova. The director explains the importance of drawing to his creative process, the mysterious ways in which ideas for films arise, his collaborations with his wife, Giulietta Masina, his thoughts on fascism, Jung, and the relationship between cinema and television. Often comic, sometimes tragic, and rife with insightful comments on his craft, Making a Film sheds light on Fellini's life and reveals the motivations behind many of his most fascinating movies. Available in its entirety for the first time in English, this volume contains the complete translation of Fare un film, the authoritative collection of writings edited and reworked by Fellini and initially published by Giulio Einaudi in 1980. The text includes a new translation of the Italo Calvino essay \"A Spectator's Autobiography,\" an introduction by Italian film scholar Christopher B. White, and an afterword by Fellini's longtime friend and collaborator Liliana Betti.\n\nWithin the realm of the trans-cultural debate, Spaghetti Western are rarely associated to what it is generally intended as \" highbrow culture \". On the contrary, both Sergio Leone's and Tonino Valerii's Westerns are important examples of how some of its best authors were able to enrich a genre eminently aimed at entertaining big masses, with a multi-layered psychoanalytical paratext. This paper will focus, in particular, on Valerii's I giorni dell'ira (Day of Anger, 1967) reading the relationship between the protagonist Scott Mary and the deuteragonist, Frank Talby, through the lenses of the Oedipus complex. My aim is to augment the classical theory of Freud, Jung, and Lacan, with the more recent discoveries on the pathological relationship between a youngster and his paternal figure put forward by Recalcati, Cacciari, and Zoja."
