        "text": "The involuntary manslaughter case against Alec Baldwin was dismissed on Friday, more than two years after the gun he was rehearsing with on the “Rust” film set fired a live bullet that killed the movie’s cinematographer.\n\nThe case was dismissed after the judge found that the state had withheld evidence that could have explained how live rounds wound up on the film set.\n\nMr. Baldwin, who was both a lead actor and producer in the western, was the second person to go to trial for the fatal shooting of the cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins. This year, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the armorer who loaded the gun with a live round that day, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to 18 months in prison.\n\nThe aftermath of the shooting has also included numerous civil lawsuits, a steep fine on the production and a reckoning inside Hollywood over the use of real guns on television and film sets.\n\nMr. Baldwin repeatedly denied responsibility for the tragedy, noting that he was told that the gun did not contain any live rounds and that live ammunition is supposed to be banned on sets. The actor also denied pulling the trigger, but prosecutors said that forensic reports disproved that account.\n\nHere is an overview of what has happened since the fatal shooting."
