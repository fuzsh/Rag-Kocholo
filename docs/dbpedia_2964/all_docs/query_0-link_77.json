        "text": "Laboratory Experiments on Meandering Meltwater Channels\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFernandez, R.; Berens, J.; Parker, G.; Stark, C. P.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nMeandering channels of all scales and flowing over a wide variety of media have common planform patterns. Although the analogy in planform suggests there is a common underlying framework, the constitutive relations driving planform evolution through vertical incision/deposition and lateral migration differ from medium to medium. The driving processes in alluvial and mixed bedrock-alluvial meandering channels have been studied substantially over the last decades. However, this is not the case for meandering channels in other media such as ice or soluble rock. Here we present results from experiments conducted at the Ven Te Chow Hydrosystems Laboratory of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on meltwater meandering channels. A rivulet is carved into an ice block and water is allowed to flow at a constant discharge. Planform evolution is analyzed with time lapse imaging and complemented with rubber molds of the channel once the experiment is over. These molds give us the full 3D structure of the meandering, including incisional overhang. Vertical incision rates are measured throughout the run by taking elevations along the channel, and these measurements are complemented with analysis from the molds. We show examples of meandering of intense amplitude with deep overhangs. Features resembling scroll bars document cyclically punctuated melting. We report on lateral migration rates, incision rates, sinuosity, channel depths, channel widths, reach averaged velocities, bend wavelengths and amplitudes and compare them to values reported in the literature for alluvial rivers.\n\nRiver meanders and channel size\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nWilliams, G.P.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nThis study uses an enlarged data set to (1) compare measured meander geometry to that predicted by the Langbein and Leopold (1966) theory, (2) examine the frequency distribution of the ratio radius of curvature/channel width, and (3) derive 40 empirical equations (31 of which are original) involving meander and channel size features. The data set, part of which comes from publications by other authors, consists of 194 sites from a large variety of physiographic environments in various countries. The Langbein-Leopold sine-generated-curve theory for predicting radius of curvature agrees very well with the field data (78 sites). The ratio radius of curvature/channel width has a modal value in the range of 2 to 3, in accordance with earlier work; about one third of the 79 values is less than 2.0. The 40 empirical relations, most of which include only two variables, involve channel cross-section dimensions (bankfull area, width, and mean depth) and meander features (wavelength, bend length, radius of curvature, and belt width). These relations have very high correlation coefficients, most being in the range of 0.95-0.99. Although channel width traditionally has served as a scale indicator, bankfull cross-sectional area and mean depth also can be used for this purpose. ?? 1986.\n\nMeandering channels without vegetation: Examples from Nevada and Chile\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMatsubara, Y.; Howard, A. D.; Burr, D. M.; Williams, R. M.; Moore, J. M.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nWe report on a study motivated by the occurrence of highly sinuous, actively migrating paleochannels on Mars. Highly sinuous, unconfined meanders require small aspect ratios, which in turn require cohesive channel banks. This cohesion is obtained most commonly by vegetation cover coupled with high suspended sediment loading. The dominant role of vegetation in meandering is reflected in the difficulty in creating highly sinuous channels in flume experiment without introduction of vegetation. The occurrence of strongly meandering channels on Mars suggests meanders can develop in the absence of vegetation. The main objective of our study is to understand the processes of meander evolution in non-vegetated surfaces. We have studied two terrestrial sites in which meandering channels form where vegetation is sparse and has little influence on bank erodibility or point-bar deposition, indicating that there must be other mechanisms creating bank cohesion. One mechanism is stabilization of point-bar deposits by mud drapes. The Quinn River in Nevada is a sinuous channel that flows through fine lacustrine sediments on the floor of paleolake Lahontan resulting in the river having both bed and bank composed of sediment containing least 40% silt/clay. In addition to abundant mud, high salt content of the river water encourages flocculation and settling of fine sediment; thus both high clay/silt content and salt work together at the Quinn River to maintain a small aspect ratio. In contrast to the Quinn River, meandering channels on alluvial fans in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile are deposited by flows originating from the foothills of the Andes Mountains where sediments are coarser and more variable in size. Like Quinn River both fine sediments and salts contribute to meandering. The bank cohesion is provided by mudflows or hyperconcentrated flows creating bank drapes as well as extensive overbank levees which harden to adobe-like consistency. The Atacama Desert is rich in\n\nFlow Structure and Channel Morphology at a Confluent-Meander Bend\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRiley, J. D.; Rhoads, B. L.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nFlow structure and channel morphology in meander bends have been well documented. Channel curvature subjects flow through a bend to centrifugal acceleration, inducing a counterbalancing pressure-gradient force that initiates secondary circulation. Transverse variations in boundary shear stress and bedload transport parallel cross-stream movement of high velocity flow and determine spatial patterns of erosion along the outer bank and deposition along the inner bank. Laboratory experiments and numerical modeling of confluent-meander bends, a junction planform that develops when a tributary joins a meandering river along the outer bank of a bend, suggest that flow and channel morphology in such bends deviate from typical patterns. The purpose of this study is to examine three-dimensional (3-D) flow structure and channel morphology at a natural confluent-meander bend. Field data were collected in southeastern Illinois where Big Muddy Creek joins the Little Wabash River near a local maximum of curvature along an elongated meander loop. Measurements of 3-D velocity components were obtained with an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) for two flow events with differing momentum ratios. Channel bathymetry was also resolved from the four-beam depths of the ADCP. Analysis of velocity data reveals a distinct shear layer flanked by dual helical cells within the bend immediately downstream of the confluence. Flow from the tributary confines flow from the main channel along the inner part of the channel cross section, displacing the thalweg inward, limiting the downstream extent of the point bar, protecting the outer bank from erosion and enabling bar-building along this bank. Overall, this pattern of flow and channel morphology is quite different from typical patterns in meander bends, but is consistent with a conceptual model derived from laboratory experiments and numerical modeling.\n\nMethodology for calculating shear stress in a meandering channel\n\nTreesearch\n\nKyung-Seop Sin\n\n2010-01-01\n\nShear stress in meandering channels is the key parameter to predict bank erosion and bend migration.

A.; Pyrcz, M.; Sullivan, M.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nMeandering rivers are probably one of the most recognizable geomorphic features on earth. As they meander across alluvial and delta plains, channels migrate laterally and develop point bars, splays, levees and other geomorphic and sedimentary features that compose substantial portions of the fill within many sedimentary basins. These basins can include hydrocarbon producing fields. Therefore, a good understanding of the processes of meandering channels and their associated deposits is critical for exploiting these reservoirs in the subsurface. In the past couple of decades, significant progress has been made in our understanding of the morphodynamics of channel meandering. Basic fluid dynamics and sediment transport (Ikeda and Parker, 1981; Howard, 1992) has shown that many characteristic features of meandering rivers, such as the meandering wavelength, growth rate and downstream migration rate, can be predicted quantitatively. As a result, a number of variations and improvement of the theory have emerged (e.g., Blondeaux and Seminara, 1985; Parker and Andrews, 1985, 1986; and Sun et al., 2001a, b).The main improvements include the recognition of so called \"bar-bend\" interactions, where the development of bars on the channel bed and their interactions with the channel bend is recognized as a primary cause for meandering channels to develop greater complexity than the classic goose-neck meander bend shapes, such as compound bend. Recently, Sun and others have shown that the spatial patterns of width variations in meandering channels can be explained by an extrinsic periodic flow variations coupled with the intrinsic bend instability dynamics. In contrast to the significant improvement of our understanding of channel meandering, little work has been done to link the geomorphic features of meandering channels to the geometry and heterogeneity of the deposits they form and ultimately preserves. A computer simulation model based on the work of Sun and others (1996, 2001\n\nRiver channel patterns: Braided, meandering, and straight\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nLeopold, Luna Bergere; Wolman, M. Gordon\n\n1957-01-01\n\nChannel pattern is used to describe the plan view of a reach of river as seen from an airplane, and includes meandering, braiding, or relatively straight channels.Natural channels characteristically exhibit alternating pools or deep reaches and riffles or shallow reaches, regardless of the type of pattern. The length of the pool or distance between riffles in a straight channel equals the straight line distance between successive points of inflection in the wave pattern of a meandering river of the same width. The points of inflection are also shallow points and correspond to riffles in the straight channel. This distance, which is half the wavelength of the meander, varies approximately as a linear function of channel width. In the data we analysed the meander wavelength, or twice the distance between successive riffles, is from 7 to 12 times the channel width. It is concluded that the mechanics which may lead to meandering operate in straight channels.River braiding is characterized by channel division around alluvial islands. The growth of an island begins as the deposition of a central bar which results from sorting and deposition of the coarser fractions of the load which locally cannot be transported. The bar grows downstream and in height by continued deposition on its surface, forcing the water into the flanking channels, which, to carry the flow, deepen and cut laterally into the original banks. Such deepening locally lowers the water surface and the central bar emerges as an island which becomes stabilized by vegetation. Braiding was observed in a small river in a laboratory. Measurements of the adjustments of velocity, depth, width, and slope associated with island development lead to the conclusion that braiding is one of the many patterns which can maintain quasi-equilibrium among discharge, load, and transporting ability. Braiding does not necessarily indicate an excess of total load.Channel cross section and pattern are ultimately controlled by the\n\nDesigning and Assessing Restored Meandering River Planform Using RVR Meander\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLangendoen, E. J.; Abad, J. D.; Motta, D.; Frias, C. E.; Wong, M.; Barnes, B. J.; Anderson, C. D.; Garcia, M. H.; MacDonald, T. E.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe ongoing modification and resulting reduction in water quality of U.S. rivers have led to a significant increase in river restoration projects over the last two decades. The increased interest in restoring degraded streams, however, has not necessarily led to improved stream function. Palmer and Allan (2005) found that many restoration projects fail to achieve their objectives due to the lack of policies to support restoration standards, to promote proven methods and to provide basic data needed for planning and implementation. Proven models of in-stream and riparian processes could be used not only to guide the design of restoration projects but also to assess both pre- and post-project indicators of ecological integrity. One of the most difficult types of river restoration projects concern reconstructing a new channel, often with an alignment and channel form different from those of the degraded pre-project channel. Recreating a meandering planform to provide longitudinal and lateral variability of flow and bed morphology to improve in-stream aquatic habitat is often desired. Channel meander planform is controlled by a multitude of variables, for example channel width to depth ratio, radius of curvature to channel width ratio, bankfull discharge, roughness, bed-material physical characteristics, bed material transport, resistance to erosion of the floodplain soils, riparian vegetation, etc. Therefore, current practices that use simple, empirically based relationships or reference reaches have led to failure in several instances, for example a washing out of meander bends or a highly unstable planform, because they fail to address the site-specific conditions. Recently, progress has been made to enhance a physically- and process-based model, RVR Meander, for rapid analysis of meandering river morphodynamics with reduced empiricism. For example, lateral migration is based on measurable physical properties of the floodplain soils and riparian vegetation versus\n\nCreating self-formed meandering channels in laboratory flumes (Invited)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBraudrick, C. A.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nOur ability to construct predictive numerical models for meandering rivers is hampered by the inability to create meandering channels in the laboratory where individual variables can be isolated and controlled. Typically, experimental channels braid, straighten, or cease migration once they develop curvature. By using alfalfa sprouts to provide bank strength and fine sediment to attach point bars to the floodplain, we have successfully created and maintained meandering morphology in a laboratory flume. The 6.1 by 17 m flume has a floodplain slope of approximately 0.005 with a sandy bed and banks that scales as a gravel bed river. The alfalfa sprouts slow bank erosion allowing time for the bars to create new floodplain deposits. The sprouts also increase floodplain roughness, armor new bar deposits, and promote deposition of overbank sediment. The fine sediment, a lightweight plastic that scaled as sand, was crucial for blocking chutes formed between the bar and the floodplain, isolating cut-off channels from the main flow, and creating levees. During this 136-hour long experiment, the channel width stabilized as the channel migrated across the floodplain, and the curvature was recreated following cutoffs. Although the sinuosity (about 1.2) was low relative to meandering channels observed in the field, the spacing of bends was within the upper bounds of field examples. Subsequent experiments with higher bank strength had more limited chute development were able to generate a sinuosity of about 1.4. Scaling analysis indicates that the bank migration rates in the lower sinuosity experiment were approximately 10 times faster than migration rates in the field. A particular challenge in these experiments is maintaining a healthy alfalfa crop. After 15-20 hours of flood flows, the alfalfa begins to die off and new emergent bars need to be seeded. It then takes about 7 days for the alfalfa to grow to the size used in these experiments. The 15-20 hours scale to about one\n\nField Investigation of Flow Structure and Channel Morphology at Confluent-Meander Bends\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRiley, J. D.; Rhoads, B. L.\n\n2007-12-01\n\nThe movement of water and sediment through drainage networks is inevitably influenced by the convergence of streams and rivers at channel confluences. These focal components of fluvial systems produce a complex hydrodynamic environment, where rapid changes in flow structure and sediment transport occur to accommodate the merging of separate channel flows. The inherent geometric and hydraulic change at confluences also initiates the development of distinct geomorphic features, reflected in the bedform and shape of the channel. An underlying assumption of previous experimental and theoretical models of confluence dynamics has been that converging streams have straight channels with angular configurations. This generalized conceptualization was necessary to establish confluence planform as symmetrical or asymmetrical and to describe subsequent flow structure and geomorphic features at confluences. However, natural channels, particularly those of meandering rivers, curve and bend. This property and observation of channel curvature at natural junctions have led to the hypothesis that natural stream and river confluences tend to occur on the concave outer bank of meander bends. The resulting confluence planform, referred to as a confluent-meander bend, was observed over a century ago but has received little scientific attention. This paper examines preliminary data on three-dimensional flow structure and channel morphology at two natural confluent-meander bends of varying size and with differing tributary entrance locations. The large river confluence of the Vermilion River and Wabash River in west central Indiana and the comparatively small junction of the Little Wabash River and Big Muddy Creek in southeastern Illinois are the location of study sites for field investigation. Measurements of time-averaged three-dimensional velocity components were obtained at these confluences with an acoustic Doppler current profiler for flow events with differing momentum ratios.

The flow configuration corresponds to the experiments of Shiono and Muto (1998). The predicted mean streamwise velocities, mean secondary motions, velocity fluctuations, turbulent kinetic energy as well as mean flood flow angle to meandering channel are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. We have analyzed the flow structure as a function of the inundation level, with particular emphasis on the development of the secondary motions due to the interaction between the main channel and the floodplain flow. Bed shear stresses have been also estimated in the simulations. Floodplain flow has a significant impact on the flow structure leading to significantly different bed shear stress patterns within the main meandering channel. The implications of these results for natural compound meandering channels are also discussed.\n\nRiver meanders\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nLeopold, Luna Bergere; Wolman, M. Gordon\n\n1960-01-01\n\nMost river curves have nearly the same value of the ratio of curvature radius to channel width, in the range of 2 to 3. Meanders formed by meltwater on the surface of glaciers, and by the main current of the Gulf Stream, have a relation of meander length to channel width similar to rivers. Because such meanders carry no sediment, the shapes of curves in rivers are evidently determined primarily by the dynamics of flow rather than by relation to debris load.Velocity distributions along river curves provide a generalized picture of flow characteristics. Evidence on flow resistance in curved channels suggests that a basic aspect of meander mechanics may be related to the distribution of energy loss provided by a particular configuration or curvature. No general theory of meanders is as yet satisfactory, however; in fact, present evidence suggests that no single theory will explain the formation and characteristics of all meanders and that few of the physical principles involved have yet been clearly identified.\n\nExperimental Research on Boundary Shear Stress in Typical Meandering Channel\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, Kai-hua; Xia, Yun-feng; Zhang, Shi-zhao; Wen, Yun-cheng; Xu, Hua\n\n2018-06-01\n\nA novel instrument named Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) flexible hot-film shear stress sensor was used to study the boundary shear stress distribution in the generalized natural meandering open channel, and the mean sidewall shear stress distribution along the meandering channel, and the lateral boundary shear stress distribution in the typical cross-section of the meandering channel was analysed. Based on the measurement of the boundary shear stress, a semi-empirical semi-theoretical computing approach of the boundary shear stress was derived including the effects of the secondary flow, sidewall roughness factor, eddy viscosity and the additional Reynolds stress, and more importantly, for the first time, it combined the effects of the cross-section central angle and the Reynolds number into the expressions. Afterwards, a comparison between the previous research and this study was developed. Following the result, we found that the semi-empirical semi-theoretical boundary shear stress distribution algorithm can predict the boundary shear stress distribution precisely. Finally, a single factor analysis was conducted on the relationship between the average sidewall shear stress on the convex and concave bank and the flow rate, water depth, slope ratio, or the cross-section central angle of the open channel bend. The functional relationship with each of the above factors was established, and then the distance from the location of the extreme sidewall shear stress to the bottom of the open channel was deduced based on the statistical theory.\n\nA nonlinear model of flow in meandering submarine and subaerial channels\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nImran, Jasim; Parker, Gary; Pirmez, Carlos\n\n1999-12-01\n\nA generalized model of flow in meandering subaqueous and subaerial channels is developed. The conservation equations of mass and momentum are depth/layer integrated, normalized, and represented as deviations from a straight base state. This allows the determination of integrable forms which can be solved at both linear and nonlinear levels. The effects of various flow and geometric parameters on the flow dynamics are studied. Although the model is not limited to any specific planform, this study focuses on sine-generated curves. In analysing the flow patterns, the turbidity current of the subaqueous case is simplified to a conservative density flow with water entrainment from above neglected. The subaqueous model thus formally corresponds to a subcritical or only mildly supercritical mud-rich turbidity current. By extension, however the analysis can be applied to a depositional or erosional current carrying sand that is changing only slowly in the streamwise direction. By bringing the subaqueous and subaerial cases into a common form, flow behaviour in the two environments can be compared under similar geometric and boundary conditions. A major difference between the two cases is the degree of superelevation of channel flow around bends, which is modest in the subaerial case but substantial in the subaqueous case. Another difference concerns Coriolis effects: some of the largest subaqueous meandering systems are so large that Coriolis effects can become important. The model is applied to meander bends on the youngest channel in the mid-fan region of the Amazon Fan and a mildly sinuous bend of the North-West Atlantic Mid-Ocean Channel. In the absence of specific data on the turbid flows that created the channel, the model can be used to make inferences about the flow, and in particular the range of values of flow velocity and sediment concentration that would allow the growth and downfan migration of meander bends.\n\nTransposition of a Process-Based Model, Flumy: from Meandering Fluvial Systems to Channelized Turbidite Systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLemay, M.; Cojan, I.; Rivoirard, J.; Grimaud, J. L.; Ors, F.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nChannelized turbidite systems are among the most important hydrocarbon reservoirs. Yet building realistic turbidite reservoir models is still a challenge. Flumy has been firstly developed to simulate the long-term evolution of aggrading meandering fluvial systems in order to build facies reservoir models. In this study, Flumy has been transposed to channelized turbidite systems. The channel migration linear model of Imran et al. (1999) dedicated to subaqueous flows has been implemented. The whole model has been calibrated taking into account the differences on channel morphology, avulsion frequency, and aggradation and migration rates. This calibration and the comparison of the model to natural systems rely on: i) the channel planform morphology characterized by the meander wavelength, amplitude, and sinuosity; ii) the channel trajectory and the resulting stratigraphic architecture described using Jobe et al. (2016) indexes. Flumy succeeds in reproducing turbidite channel planform morphology as shown by the mean sinuosity of 1.7, the wavelength to width and amplitude to width ratios around 4 and 1 respectively. First-order meander architecture, characterized by the ratios meander belt width versus channel width, meander belt thickness versus channel depth, and the deduced stratigraphic mobility number (the ratio between lateral versus vertical channel displacements), is also well reproduced: 2.5, 3.8, and 0.6 respectively. Both lateral and downstream channel normalized migrations are around 3.5 times lower than in fluvial systems. All these values are absolutely coherent with the observations. In the other hand, the channel trajectory observed on seismic cross sections (hockey stick geometry) is not fully reproduced: the local stratigraphic mobility number is divided upward by 3 whereas up to 10 is expected. This behavior is generally explained in the literature by an increasing aggradation rate through time and/or flow stripping at outer bend that decreases\n\nMeandering rivers: Interpreting dynamics from planform geometry and the secret lives of migrating meanders\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchwenk, Jonathan\n\nMeandering rivers are dynamic agents of geomorphic change that rework landscapes through migration while maintaining beautiful looping planforms. This work investigates the relationships between the alluring planform geometries of meandering rivers, the dynamics of individual meander bend migration, and the dynamic processes driving meander evolution. A simple yet physically-based model of long-time meander migration is employed to understand the dynamic trajectories of individual meander bends and establish relationships between historic dynamics and cutoff bend geometry. At the reach scale, concepts from nonlinear dynamic theory are applied to river centerlines to determine if the dynamic nonlinearities driving meander evolution are preserved in the reachwide planform structure. Understanding how rivers move across their floodplains requires snapshots of planforms over long time periods from aerial photography or historic maps and surveys which are often taken at irregular and long intervals. Migration occurring between snapshots has thus largely remained a mystery. More recently, worldwide satellite imagery collected at least every 18 days by the NASA Landsat family of satellites offers the potential to reveal the secret lives of migrating, meandering rivers. This research mines the vault of Landsat imagery to resolve over 30 years of planform migration along more than 1,300 km of one of the Earth's most active meandering rivers: the Ucayali River in Peru. Analysis of the resulting annual binary channel masks suggests that migration rates are controlled by processes acting across bend-to-reach scales. An exciting new geomorphic discovery emerges from the analysis revealing the role of cutoffs as drivers of nonlocal morphodynamic change.\n\nThe bankfull hydraulic geometry of evolving meander bends\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMonegaglia, F.; Tubino, M.; Zolezzi, G.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nChanges in the bankfull hydraulic geometry of meandering rivers associated with meander growth from incipient meandering to cutoffs have seldom been analysed in detail. Such information is also needed by meander morphodynamic models, most of which simulate the evolution of bankfull channel geometry by simply accounting for channel slope reduction inversely proportional to elongation, while changes in bankfull channel width are often neglected or, when they are considered, they are not consistent with the few available observations. To address these gaps we first perform an extensive, systematic, bend-scale evolutionary analysis of bankfull channel widths in several large meandering rivers in the Amazon basin, over a three decades time period, from remotely sensed field data. The analysis consistently show a slight decreasing trend of the bankfull channel width during the planform evolution towards cutoff. Furthermore, we develop a physically based model for the evolution of bankfull channel geometry during the planform development of meandering rivers. The model is based on the conservation of sediment discharge. An integrated one-dimensional Exner equation that accounts for meander elongation, sediment supply conservation and sediment income from the channel banks, allows us to predict the evolution of the channel slope. The evolution of the channel width is modeled through a threshold equation. The model correctly predicts the slight variability of channel width during meander development and a gentler reduction of the channel slope, which is mitigated by the conservation of sediment supply. The bankfull geometry of highly dynamic meandering rivers is predicted to be elongation-dominated, while the one related to slowly evolving meandering rivers is sediment supply-dominated. Finally, we discuss the implications of the proposed modeling framework in terms of planform structure, meander shape and morphodynamic influence.\n\nNumerical modeling of dune progression in a high amplitude meandering channel\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nLaboratory experiments carried out by Abad and Garcia (2009) in a high-amplitude Kinoshita meandering channel show bed morphodynamics to comprise steady (local scour and deposition) and unsteady (migrating bedforms) components.

This minimization involves the adjustment of the planimetric geometry and the hydraulic factors of depth, velocity, and local slope.The planimetric geometry of a meander is that of a random walk whose most frequent form minimizes the sum of the squares of the changes in direction in each successive unit length. The direction angles are then sine functions of channel distance. This yields a meander shape typically present in meandering rivers and has the characteristic that the ratio of meander length to average radius of curvature in the bend is 4.7.Depth, velocity, and slope are shown by field observations to be adjusted so as to decrease the variance of shear and the friction factor in a meander curve over that in an otherwise comparable straight reach of the same riverSince theory and observation indicate meanders achieve the minimum variance postulated, it follows that for channels in which alternating pools and riffles occur, meandering is the most probable form of channel geometry and thus is more stable geometry than a straight or nonmeandering alinement.\n\nA geomorphic explanation for a meander cutoff following channel relocation of a coarse-bedded river.\n\nPubMed\n\nThompson, Douglas M\n\n2003-03-01\n\nThe Veteran's Fishing section of the Blackledge River in central Connecticut was relocated in the late 1950s. The relocation resulted in an unstable channel despite extensive efforts to prevent erosion. Overbank erosion and meander cutoffs were investigated using detailed survey data, characterizations of sediment deposits, flow modeling, and a moment-stability analysis. Limited reworking of revetment boulders indicate that riprap bank material was immobile during a 1979 flood event responsible for the formation of the cutoff channel. A moment-stability analysis factor-of-safety value of 1.1 supports the conclusion that riprap was not directly eroded from the banks. Alluvial particles with d(95) values ranging up to 120 mm were deposited along a bar downstream from the cutoff channel at flows estimated to be below a 1.5-year recurrence interval flow. Development of the bar deposit resulted in locally elevated water surfaces at high flow. The resulting overbank flow across the meander neck to the adjacent downstream bend led to the creation of an upstream migrating knickpoint, the erosion of approximately 16,000-year-old sediments, and the subsequent meander cutoff. The results of the study indicate that traditional erosion-control measures cannot prevent extreme channel adjustments if the geomorphic processes that control sediment continuity also are not considered.\n\nField migration rates of tidal meanders recapitulate fluvial morphodynamics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFinotello, Alvise; Lanzoni, Stefano; Ghinassi, Massimiliano; Marani, Marco; Rinaldo, Andrea; D'Alpaos, Andrea\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe majority of tidal channels display marked meandering features. Despite their importance in oil-reservoir formation and tidal landscape morphology, questions remain on whether tidal-meander dynamics could be understood in terms of fluvial processes and theory. Key differences suggest otherwise, like the periodic reversal of landscape-forming tidal flows and the widely accepted empirical notion that tidal meanders are stable landscape features, in stark contrast with their migrating fluvial counterparts. On the contrary, here we show that, once properly normalized, observed migration rates of tidal and fluvial meanders are remarkably similar. Key to normalization is the role of tidal channel width that responds to the strong spatial gradients of landscape-forming flow rates and tidal prisms. We find that migration dynamics of tidal meanders agree with nonlinear theories for river meander evolution. Our results challenge the conventional view of tidal channels as stable landscape features and suggest that meandering tidal channels recapitulate many fluvial counterparts owing to large gradients of tidal prisms across meander wavelengths.\n\nHydrodynamics and sediment transport in a meandering channel with a model axial-flow hydrokinetic turbine\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHill, Craig; Kozarek, Jessica; Sotiropoulos, Fotis; Guala, Michele\n\n2016-02-01\n\nAn investigation into the interactions between a model axial-flow hydrokinetic turbine (rotor diameter, dT = 0.15 m) and the complex hydrodynamics and sediment transport processes within a meandering channel was carried out in the Outdoor StreamLab research facility at the University of Minnesota St. Anthony Falls Laboratory. This field-scale meandering stream with bulk flow and sediment discharge control provided a location for high spatiotemporally resolved measurements of bed and water surface elevations around the model turbine. The device was installed within an asymmetric, erodible channel cross section under migrating bed form and fixed outer bank conditions. A comparative analysis between velocity and topographic measurements, with and without the turbine installed, highlights the local and nonlocal features of the turbine-induced scour and deposition patterns. In particular, it shows how the cross-section geometry changes, how the bed form characteristics are altered, and how the mean flow field is distorted both upstream and downstream of the turbine. We further compare and discuss how current energy conversion deployments in meander regions would result in different interactions between the turbine operation and the local and nonlocal bathymetry compared to straight channels.\n\nThe Spatial Structure of Planform Migration - Curvature Relation of Meandering Rivers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGuneralp, I.; Rhoads, B. L.\n\n2005-12-01\n\nof previous studies. Continuous curvature series can be related to measured rates of lateral migration to explore empirically the relationship between spatially extended curvature and local bend migration. The methodology is applied to a study reach along a highly sinuous section of the Embarras River in Illinois, USA, which contains double-headed asymmetrical loops. To identify patterns of channel planform and rates of lateral migration for a study reach along Embarrass River in central Illinois, geographical information systems analysis of historical aerial photography over a period from 1936 to 1998 was conducted. Results indicate that parametric cubic spline interpolation provides excellent characterization of the complex planforms and planform curvatures of meandering rivers. The findings also indicate that the spatial structure of migration rate-curvature relation may be more complex than a simple exponential distance-decay function. The study represents a first step toward unraveling the spatial structure of planform evolution of meandering rivers and for developing models of planform dynamics that accurately relate spatially extended patterns of channel curvature to local rates of lateral migration. Such knowledge is vital for improving the capacity to accurately predict planform change of meandering rivers.\n\nMigration Rate Of Tidal Meanders: Inferences From The Venice Lagoon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFinotello, A.; D'Alpaos, A.; Ghinassi, M.; Lanzoni, S.; Marani, M.; Rinaldo, A.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nMeandering channels are ubiquitous features of tidal landscapes. However, despite their fundamental role on the eco-morphodynamic evolution of these landscapes, tidal meanders have received less attention when compared to their fluvial counterparts. Improving current understanding of tidal meander migration, a largely-examined topic in fluvial landscapes, is a key step to highlight analogies and differences between tidal and fluvial cases. The migration of about 400 meander bends, belonging to 40 salt-marsh channels in the Northern Venice Lagoon (Italy), from 1968 to nowadays, has been investigated by means of both a classical method in fluvial frameworks and new procedure. Similarities with fluvial meanders occur, although important difference also emerge. Meanders cutting through the San Felice marsh follow the relationship between cartesian length and channel width, typical of meanders developed within different settings. However, meander migration rates proved to be smaller than those characterizing fluvial meanders. Indeed, the analysis of meander migration suggests a mean migration rate of about 0.10 m/year, consistent with the few data available in the literature. As for the fluvial case, the maximum-potential migration rate (i.e. the envelope curve of the relationship between migration rate and bend radius, both divided by channel width) reaches a maximum for radius-over-width ratio included between 2 and 3, regardless of the considered method. Nevertheless, the new-proposed method allows us to provide a more objective and continuous characterization. By using this new procedure, the channel curvature has finally been Fourier-analyzed, confirming the importance of even harmonics along the curvature spectrum. A correlation between migration rates and dominant harmonics seems to drive the evolution of tidal meanders and might represent a key-feature to distinguish them from their fluvial counterparts.\n\nDon't Fence Me In: Free Meanders in a Confined River Valley\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEke, E. C.; Wilcock, P. R.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe interaction between meandering river channels and inerodible valley walls provides a useful test of our ability to understand meander dynamics. In some cases, river meanders confined between valley walls display distinctive angular bends in a dynamic equilibrium such that their size and shape persist as the meander migrates. In other cases, meander geometry is more varied and changes as the meander migrates. The ratio of channel to valley width has been identified as a useful parameter for defining confined meanders, but is not sufficient to distinguish cases in which sharp angular bends are able to migrate with little change in geometry. Here, we examine the effect of water and sediment supply on the geometry of confined rivers in order to identify conditions under which meander geometry reaches a persistent dynamic equilibrium. Because channel width and meander geometry are closely related, we use a numerical meander model that allows for independent migration of both banks, thereby allowing channel width to vary in space and time. We hypothesize that confined meanders with persistent angular bends have smaller transport rates of bed material and that their migration is driven by erosion of the cutbank (bank-pull migration). When bed material supply is sufficiently large that point bar deposition drives meander migration (bar-push migration), confined meander bends have a larger radius of curvature and a geometry that varies as the meander migrates. We test this hypothesis using historical patterns of confined meander migration for rivers with different rates of sediment supply and bed material transport. Interpretation of the meander migration pattern is provided by the free-width meander migration model.\n\nMartian Meanders and Scroll-Bars\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThis is a portion of an inverted fluvial channel in the region of Aeolis/Zephyria Plana, at the Martian equator. Channels become inverted when the sediments filling them become more resistant to erosion than the surrounding material. Here, the most likely process leading to hardening of the channel material is chemical cementation by precipitation of minerals. Once the surrounding material erodes, the channel is left standing as a ridge. The series of curvilinear lineations are ancient scroll-bars, which are features typical of river meanders (bends) in terrestrial fluvial channels. Scroll-bars are series of ridges that result from the continuous lateral migration of a meander. On Earth, they are more common in mature rivers. The presence of scroll bars suggests that the water flow in this channel may have been sustained for a relatively long time. Measuring characteristics of these scroll-bars and meanders may help to estimate the amount of water that once flowed in this channel, aiding our understanding of the history of water on Mars. The map is projected here at a scale of 25 centimeters (9.8 inches) per pixel. [The original image scale is 29.3 centimeters (11.5 inches) per pixel (with 1 x 1 binning); objects on the order of 88 centimeters (29.6 inches) across are resolved.] North is up. http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA21551\n\nSecondary Circulation Asymmetry in a Meandering, Partially Stratified Estuary\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPein, J.; Valle-Levinson, A.; Stanev, E. V.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nNumerical model experiments are used to study the effects of multiple channel bends on estuarine dynamics and, in particular, on secondary flows. These effects are demonstrated by comparing experiments with two different idealized trumpet-shaped estuaries, one straight and another one with a Ë8 km meandering section in the middle of the estuary. Meanders complicate the flow field by introducing secondary processes. For instance, meanders increase turbulence and associated mixing locally within the water column, as well as outside the meandering portion. Furthermore, meanders transform up to 30% of the along-channel momentum into secondary circulation. Production of turbulence and secondary currents is different at flood and ebb tidal phases. At flood, meanders lead to unstable stratification and increased turbulence. At ebb, the flow develops a helical pattern and adjusts to the channel curvature with minimal decrease in density stability. The secondary circulation asymmetry is caused by an interplay between the across-channel baroclinic pressure gradient force and the centrifugal force. During ebb both forces enhance each other, whereas they oppose during flood. As a consequence of this interaction between baroclinic forcing and curving morphology, ebb flows and horizontal buoyancy fluxes increase relative to flood. The enhanced ebb dominance shifts a density front toward the mouth of the estuary, thus reducing salt intrusion.\n\nOn the Fundamental Cause of River Meanders\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSahagian, D. L.; Diplas, P.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nRiver meandering has been attributed to the erosion and deposition of sediments along river banks, yet the fundamental cause of the instability has not been heretofore identified. In this conceptual study, we address the conditions that lead to the meander instability, in effect \"upstream\" of the many previous and thorough analyses of hydraulics and the alternating erosional/depositional pattern that ensues once such conditions exist. Rivers are only one of many fluid systems that exhibit meandering behavior, and no other involves sediments at all. Other examples include the gulf stream, glacial meltwater, the jet stream, channels in submarine fans, water falling directly down from a faucet, derailed trains and even tractor trailer trucks. As such, a universal criterion is needed to explain meandering in general. We show that meandering in all systems is driven by the existence of an adverse pressure gradient, such that the resulting deceleration imposed upon the fluid causes it to be energetically favorable to divert the flow to either side of its original direction. This universal framework makes it possible to determine under what conditions the meandering instability will be manifest in altered flow/channel morphology.\n\nRVR Meander â Migration of meandering rivers in homogeneous and heterogeneous floodplains using physically-based bank erosion\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nThe RVR Meander platform for computing long-term meandering-channel migration is presented, together with a method for planform migration based on the modeling of the streambank erosion processes of hydraulic erosion and mass failure.

The meander characteristics of 12 bends, identified from seven orthophotos taken between 1974 and 2004, were acquired in a GIS environment. Based on that earlier years' data acquisition, channel prediction was performed for the two years 1996 and 2004 using least squares estimation and linear extrapolations, yielding a satisfactory agreement with the observations (the median predicted and observed migration rates were 3.1 and 3.6 [m/year], respectively). The best-predicted migration rate was found to be associated with the longest orthophoto-recorded interval. The study confirmed that channel migration is strongly correlated with bend curvature and that the maximum migration rate of the bend corresponded to a radius of curvature [bend radius (R(C))/channel width (W(C))] of 2.5. In tight bends of a smaller radius of curvature than 1.6, secondary flow scouring near the bend apex increases bend curvature. The stability index of the dimensionless bend radius was determined to be 2.45. Overall, this study proves the effectiveness of least squares estimation with historical orthophotography for characterization of meandering channel migration.\n\nHighly Sinuous Meanders on Mars: Morphology, Hydrology and Terrestrial Analogs (Invited)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHoward, A. D.; Burr, D. M.; Williams, R.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nOf the rare preserved channel features on Mars, perhaps the most exciting are highly sinuous channels found, to date, in only three locations. We discuss the most extensive of these channel systems in the Aeolis/Zephyra Plana region. The channel features stand in positive relief (as inverted channels). The morphological assemblage of the sinuous ridges [Burr et al., 2009] presents a compelling case for their origin through persistent fluvial meandering within branching networks of preserved channels and associated meander belts. High resolution images reveal narrow sinuous ridges which can often be traced over tens of torturous loops. Wavelengths of these sinuous plateaus range from about 200-500 m and the width of the superposed or embedded ridges ranges from about 20-100 m where well preserved. The flat-topped plateaus exhibit irregular outer edges, often with lobate planforms with about the same size and curvature as bends in the associated sinuous ridges. We interpret these to be cutoff meander loops. In some cases parallel lineations occur interior to the sinuous ridges that appear to be analogs to point bar scars in terrestrial meandering channels. We interpret the sinuous ridges and associated sinuous plateaus featuring lobate scarps to be remnants of floodplains and associated channels formed by meandering streams. These have subsequently been eroded into positive relief by aeolian deflation of weaker surrounding deposits. At the time of fluvial activity the valleys would have been surrounded by uplands (probably with low relief). The dendritic pattern of the floodplain deposits and the considerable period of time required to sculpt the wide floodplains through lateral meander migration with cutoffs indicates a water source from distributed precipitation as rain or snow followed by runoff. The primary geomorphic issue with the martian meanders is the mechanism providing bank cohesion and a low aspect ratio. Terrestrial highly sinuous, unconfined meanders\n\n2D and 3D numerical simulations of morphodynamics structures in a large-amplitude meanders\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nIn the pioneering study of the Ishikari River, Japan, Kinoshita (Kinoshita 1957, 1961) described two types of meandering channels: (1) channel with two bars per meander wavelength (one bar per bend), and (2) channel with three or more bars per meander wavelength (multiple bars per bend).

As a result, channel evolution or migration can cause problems for bridge structures that are fixed in the flood plain. A once-stable bridge structure that was uninfluenced by a riverâs shape could be encroached upon by a migrating river channel. The potential effect of the actively meandering Wabash River on the Interstate 64 Bridge at the border with Indiana near Grayville, Illinois, was studied using a river migration model called RVR Meander. RVR Meander is a toolbox that can be used to model river channel meander migration with physically based bank erosion methods. This study assesses the Wabash River meandering processes through predictive modeling of natural meandering over the next 100 years, climate change effects through increased river flows, and bank protection measures near the Interstate 64 Bridge.\n\nSelf-formed meandering river created in the laboratory using an upstream migrating boundary\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nvan Dijk, W. M.; van de Lageweg, W. I.; Kleinhans, M. G.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nBraided rivers are relatively easily formed in the laboratory, whereas self-formed meandering rivers in the lab have proven very difficult to form, indicating a lack of understanding of the necessary and sufficient conditions for meandering. Our objective is to create self-formed dynamic meandering rivers and floodplains in a laboratory. Early experiments attempted to initiate meandering with upstream inflow at a fixed angle different from the general flow direction. The resulting bends were fixed at one position, which is not the dynamic meandering observed in nature. Another important condition for meandering is to have banks stronger than the non-cohesive bed sediment, which has been attained by growing vegetation. Furthermore, finer or light-weight sediment has been used to let chute channels fill up where otherwise multi-thread channels would have evolved, which is braiding. Yet the fixed-angle inflow kept meander migration and channel belt width and complexity limited. We accomplished dynamic meandering in the laboratory by using an upstream migrating boundary, which simulates a meander migrating into the flume. Our experiments were conducted in a circulated flume of 11x6 meter, with a constant discharge and sediment feed consisting of a sediment mixture ranging from silt to fine gravel (Kleinhans et al., 2010, this conference). The downstream boundary is a lake into which the river built a branched fan delta (Van de Lageweg et al., 2010, this conference). The morphology was recorded by high-resolution (0.5 mm) line-laser scanning and digital Single Lens Reflex (SLR) camera used for channel-floodplain segmentation and particle size estimation, at an interval of 8 hours. Furthermore a large number of smaller-scale auxiliary experiments were conducted to explore meandering tendency in a large range of parameters. Initial alternate âforcedâ bars were formed at fixed positions with low sinuosity when the upstream boundary was at one fixed position. Migration\n\nMorphology and spacing of river meander scrolls\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStrick, Robert J. P.; Ashworth, Philip J.; Awcock, Graeme; Lewin, John\n\n2018-06-01\n\nMany of the world's alluvial rivers are characterised by single or multiple channels that are often sinuous and that migrate to produce a mosaicked floodplain landscape of truncated scroll (or point) bars. Surprisingly little is known about the morphology and geometry of scroll bars despite increasing interest from hydrocarbon geoscientists working with ancient large meandering river deposits. This paper uses remote sensing imagery, LiDAR data-sets of meandering scroll bar topography, and global coverage elevation data to quantify scroll bar geometry, anatomy, relief, and spacing. The analysis focuses on preserved scroll bars in the Mississippi River (USA) floodplain but also compares attributes to 19 rivers of different scale and depositional environments from around the world. Analysis of 10 large scroll bars (median area = 25 km2) on the Mississippi shows that the point bar deposits can be categorised into three different geomorphological units of increasing scale: individual 'scrolls', 'depositional packages', and 'point bar complexes'. Scroll heights and curvatures are greatest near the modern channel and at the terminating boundaries of different depositional packages, confirming the importance of the formative main channel on subsequent scroll bar relief and shape. Fourier analysis shows a periodic variation in signal (scroll bar height) with an average period (spacing) of 167 m (range 150-190 m) for the Mississippi point bars. For other rivers, a strong relationship exists between the period of scroll bars and the adjacent primary channel width for a range of rivers from 55 to 2042 mis 50% of the main channel width. The strength of this correlation over nearly two orders of magnitude of channel size indicates a scale independence of scroll bar spacing and suggests a strong link between channel migration and scroll bar construction with apparent regularities despite different flow regimes.

T.; Sklar, L. S.; Dietrich, W. E.\n\n2005-12-01\n\nThe development of a mechanistic understanding of channel geometry and morphodynamics has been inhibited by the inability to create self-formed, freely meandering, single thread channels in a laboratory flume. By being able to reliably generate such channels, studies of the influence of sediment supply and flow dynamics as well as bank strength on channel morphology can be experimentally explored. We have found that the key experimental controls are: 1) ratio of bank strength to boundary shear stress exerted on the bank; 2) bedload and suspended load rates; and 3) variable flow discharge. We have been able to create meandering channels in a sand bedded laboratory flume using alfalfa sprouts. The alfalfa sprouts decrease the bank erosion rate so that bank erosion would occur at approximately the same pace as bar growth. The addition of coarse suspended load was necessary to cause deposition on bars to grow to the floodplain height. The sprouts contributed to deposition by creating a rough floodplain surface. Steady discharge failed to produced meandering, apparently due to the lack of suspended load deposition on the bar surface. The channels were created in a 3.6-m wide and 6.1-m long flume with an adjustable slope set at 0.01. We introduced both bedload (sand) and suspended load (crushed silica) into the top of the flume, which has an initial channel with either one or two bends carved into the floodplain. Runs lasted between 1 and 4 hours and occurred once per week. Alfalfa seeds were spread evenly outside the low flow channel following each run and are allowed to grow between runs. With the same material and flow conditions, the channel rapidly braided without the alfalfa sprouts. Braided was also favored under steady flow conditions. Under dynamic flows with banks strengthened by sprouts, the resulting experimental channels had many of the features observed in meandering streams such as oxbow lakes and meander cutoffs. The cutoffs occurred during overbank flows\n\nUnderstanding Single-Thread Meandering Rivers with High Sinuosity on Mars through Chemical Precipitation Experiments\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLim, Y.; Kim, W.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nMeandering rivers are extremely ubiquitous on Earth, yet it is only recently that single-thread experimental channels with low sinuosity have been created. In these recent experiments, as well as in natural rivers, vegetation plays a crucial role in maintaining a meandering pattern by adding cohesion to the bank and inhibiting erosion. The ancient, highly sinuous channels found on Mars are enigmatic because presumably vegetation did not exist on ancient Mars. Under the hypothesis that Martian meandering rivers formed by chemical precipitation on levees and flood plain deposits, we conducted carbonate flume experiments to investigate the formation and evolution of a single-thread meander pattern without vegetation. The flow recirculating in the flume is designed to accelerate chemical reactions - dissolution of limestone using CO2 gas to produce artificial spring water and precipitation of carbonates to increase cohesion- with precise control of water discharge, sediment discharge, and temperature. Preliminary experiments successfully created a single-thread meandering pattern through chemical processes. Carbonate deposits focused along the channel sides improved the bank stability and made them resistant to erosion, which led to a stream confined in a narrow path. The experimental channels showed lateral migration of the bend through cut bank and point bar deposits; intermittent floods created overbank flow and encouraged cut bank erosion, which enhanced lateral migration of the channel, while increase in sediment supply improved lateral point bar deposition, which balanced erosion and deposition rates. This mechanism may be applied to terrestrial single-thread and/or meandering rivers with little to no vegetation or before its introduction to Earth and also provide the link between meandering river records on Mars to changes in Martian surface conditions.\n\nAlluvial cover controlling the width, slope and sinuosity of bedrock channels\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTurowski, Jens Martin\n\n2018-02-01\n\nBedrock channel slope and width are important parameters for setting bedload transport capacity and for stream-profile inversion to obtain tectonics information. Channel width and slope development are closely related to the problem of bedrock channel sinuosity. It is therefore likely that observations on bedrock channel meandering yields insights into the development of channel width and slope. Active meandering occurs when the bedrock channel walls are eroded, which also drives channel widening. Further, for a given drop in elevation, the more sinuous a channel is, the lower is its channel bed slope in comparison to a straight channel. It can thus be expected that studies of bedrock channel meandering give insights into width and slope adjustment and vice versa. The mechanisms by which bedrock channels actively meander have been debated since the beginning of modern geomorphic research in the 19th century, but a final consensus has not been reached. It has long been argued that whether a bedrock channel meanders actively or not is determined by the availability of sediment relative to transport capacity, a notion that has also been demonstrated in laboratory experiments. Here, this idea is taken up by postulating that the rate of change of both width and sinuosity over time is dependent on bed cover only. Based on the physics of erosion by bedload impacts, a scaling argument is developed to link bedrock channel width, slope and sinuosity to sediment supply, discharge and erodibility. This simple model built on sediment-flux-driven bedrock erosion concepts yields the observed scaling relationships of channel width and slope with discharge and erosion rate. Further, it explains why sinuosity evolves to a steady-state value and predicts the observed relations between sinuosity, erodibility and storm frequency, as has been observed for meandering bedrock rivers on Pacific Arc islands.\n\nMeanders in Ridge Form in the Zephyria Region\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2015-11-05\n\nIn this image from NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft, an ancient sinuous meandering river system is surrounded by features called yardangs. The yardangs are the ridge-like landforms that align approximately north-south. These features were created as the wind scoured and eroded the bedrock. The raised relief of the meandering river suggests inverted topography, likely due to lithification and cementation of the riverbed sediment. The cemented channel deposits were resistant, and thus less susceptible to erosion over time. However, the area surrounding the riverbed suggests that this area was a floodplain of weaker lithology that was subsequently eroded and shaped to the yardangs. The main meandering inverted riverbed within the image has a length of about 13 kilometers. The elevation of the channel at the top of the image is on the order of 113 meters higher than the bottom, based on Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data. This elevation difference and the increase in sinuosity of the channel shape in the southerly direction implies that the flow of the ancient river may have been heading south-southwest. http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20047\n\nHow Do River Meanders Change with Sea Level Rise and Fall?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nScamardo, J. E.; Kim, W.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nRiver meander patterns are controlled by numerous factors, including variations in water discharge, sediment input, and base level. However, the effect of sea level rise and fall on meandering rivers has not been thoroughly quantified. This study examines geomorphic changes to meandering rivers as a result of sea level rise and fall. Twenty experimental runs using coarse-grained walnut shell sediment (D50= 500 microns) in a flume tank (2.4m x 0.6m x 0.1m) tested the optimal initial conditions for creating meandering rivers in a laboratory setting as well as variations in base level rise and fall rates. Geomorphic changes were recorded by camera images every 20 seconds for a duration of 4 hours per experiment. Seventeen experiments tested the effects of changes in initial base levels, water discharge between 200 and 400 mL/min, and sediment to water input ratios between 1:1000 and 1:250 while measuring sinuosity, channel geometry, and the timescale of the channel to reach a stable form. Sinuosity and channel activity increased with increasing water discharge, initial base level, and the sediment to water ratio to a point after which the activity decreased with increasing sediment input. Base-level change experiments used initial conditions of 400 mL/min, a 1:750 sediment to water input ratio, and a 6 cm initial base-level to induce river meanders for the initial 2 hours before base-level change occurred. Three separate experiments investigated the effects of increasing rates of sea level change: 0.07 cm/min, 0.1 cm/min, and 0.2 cm/min. Experimental sea level was decreased constantly from a high-stand of 6 cm to a low-stand of 2 cm back to the high-stand base-level in each experiment. The rates of change in the experiments scale roughly from central to glacial cycles. In all three experiments, sea level fall induced meander cut-off while sea level rise prompted greater rates of meander bend erosion and meander growth. Sinuosity increased by 12%, 13.5%, and 24\n\nMountain river meanders and typhoon strike frequency in the western Pacific\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStark, C. P.; Barbour, J.; Hsieh, M.; Hovius, N.; Jen, C.; Chen, M.\n\n2004-12-01\n\nBedrock-floored mountain rivers are shaped by erosion processes that ultimately control the evolution of the landscape on geological time scales. In mountains across the western Pacific, meanders in bedrock channels are common and often emerge during incision rather than inherit their sinuosity from a past alluvial form. Incising emergent meanders are important because they reveal a process of lateral channel erosion at least as fast as the vertical rate erosion. Here we report a remarkable link between incised meander development and typhoon strike frequency, a good proxy for extreme rainfall and flood discharge. Using satellite imagery, shuttle-radar topographic data and a 58~year inventory of typhoon tracks, we mapped meander abundance and quantified regional densities of mountain river sinuosity and typhoon strikes. Our analysis shows that eroding meanders are most common in the typhoon-prone islands of Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines, and in rivers incising weak lithologies. One might expect that the faster the erosion rate, the greater the meandering, but we have found that monthly mean rainfall - and therefore mean discharge - correlates very poorly with sinuosity. Instead, the variability of rainfall, and presumably discharge, about the mean explains bedrock meander development much better. Mountain river sinuosity, for geologically similar bedrock, increases in a roughly linear fashion with typhoon strike frequency. The coefficient of variation of monthly rainfall (standard deviation normalized by the mean) exhibits a similar trend. We deduce that extreme flood discharge, e.g. driven by typhoon rainfall, accelerates lateral erosion rates and spurs meander development in mountain rivers.\n\nApplication of meandering centreline migration modelling and object-based approach of Long Nab member\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSaadi, Saad\n\n2017-04-01\n\nCharacterizing the complexity and heterogeneity of the geometries and deposits in meandering river system is an important concern for the reservoir modelling of fluvial environments. Re-examination of the Long Nab member in the Scalby formation of the Ravenscar Group (Yorkshire, UK), integrating digital outcrop data and forward modelling approaches, will lead to a geologically realistic numerical model of the meandering river geometry. The methodology is based on extracting geostatistics from modern analogous, meandering rivers that exemplify both the confined and non-confined meandering point bars deposits and morphodynamics of Long Nab member. The parameters derived from the modern systems (i.e. channel width, amplitude, radius of curvature, sinuosity, wavelength, channel length and migration rate) are used as a statistical control for the forward simulation and resulting object oriented channel models. The statistical data derived from the modern analogues is multi-dimensional in nature, making analysis difficult. We apply data mining techniques such as parallel coordinates to investigate and identify the important relationships within the modern analogue data, which can then be used drive the development of, and as input to the forward model. This work will increase our understanding of meandering river morphodynamics, planform architecture and stratigraphic signature of various fluvial deposits and features. We will then use these forward modelling based channel objects to build reservoir models, and compare the behaviour of the forward modelled channels with traditional object modelling in hydrocarbon flow simulations.\n\nPaleohydrological methods and some examples from Swedish fluvial environments. II - River meanders.\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nWilliams, G.P.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nEmpirical relations are developed between river-meander features and water-discharge characteristics for 19 reaches along Swedish rivers. In these relations, either average channel width or average radius of curvature of meander arcs can be used to estimate average annual peak discharge and average daily discharge. By accepting certain assumptions, the relations can be applied to other meandering Swedish rivers, present or ancient. The Oster-Dalalven River near Mora is used as an example.-Author\n\nComplexity, self-organisation and variation in behaviour in meandering rivers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHooke, J. M.\n\n2007-11-01\n\nRiver meanders are natural features on the surface of Earth that present some degree of regularity of form. They range from being highly dynamic to being stable under present conditions. Conventional theory is that meanders develop to an equilibrium form which is related to discharge and sediment load. Other research has demonstrated that many highly active meanders exhibit a continuous evolution over time and a non-linearity in rate of development. Ideas of autogenesis and of self-organised criticality as being an explanation of some meander changes have been proposed. In this paper data from rivers around the world are examined for further evidence of autogenic, self-organised or non-linear behaviour through analysis of change in sinuosity over time for reaches and change in individual bend form, particularly bend curvature and bend elongation. Some examples do exhibit trends of increasing sinuosity over time and a few show limits from which large decreases occur. Several case studies show non-linearity of behaviour and increasing complexity of form. Other case studies, however, do not exhibit such trends. Phase space plots are used to help uncover emergent behaviour but show a variety of patterns. The example of a reach in which multiple cut-offs occurred is analysed for mechanisms of self-organisation of the planform and in the pool-riffle pattern. Riffles are more closely spaced and also more transient in the more rapidly changing and higher sinuosity parts of the channel. Hypothetical trajectories of different meander behaviour, including for bedrock meanders, are plotted but the challenge remains to uncover the conditions for occurrence and for divergence of tendencies to stability and instability. Identification of attractors and phase space of behaviour of different meandering systems offer the potential for application to sustainable channel management.\n\nControls on cutoff formation along a tropical meandering river in the Amazon Basin\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAhmed, J.; Constantine, J. A.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe termination of meander bends is an inherent part of the evolution of meandering rivers. Cutoffs are produced by one of two mechanisms: neck cutoffs occur when two adjacent meanders converge, while chute cutoffs are generated by flood-driven floodplain incision, resulting in a shorter, steeper channel path. Here we use an annually-resolved record of Landsat imagery, coupled with daily discharge data to assess the role of high-magnitude discharges (Q â¥ QBF) on cutoff formation along the Rio Beni, Bolivia. Our results suggest that despite numerous above-bankfull events, the dominant cutoff mechanism operating on the Beni is neck cutoff. Evaluating the formation of these cutoffs reveals that migration rates accelerate during years of high discharge, and eventually cause the migrating bends to breach. The density of floodplain vegetation and the medium into which the channel migrated was also responsible for the patterns of cutoff documented along this river. The presence of existing floodplain channels permitted the river to divert its flow along shorter courses thereby facilitating cutoff, and limiting sinuosity growth. Understanding the long-term evolution of meandering channels is important since their morphodynamics are responsible for the creation of highly biodiverse riparian habitats, as well as the store and release of alluvial material. Moreover, the interactions between discharge and the channel-floodplain system are integral for the functioning and long-term evolution of these landscapes, particularly in the face of global climate change.\n\nModeling the Long-term Planform Evolution of Meandering Rivers in Confined Alluvial Valleys: Etsch-Adige River, NE Italy.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZen, S.; Bogoni, M.; Zolezzi, G.; Lanzoni, S.; Scorpio, V.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nWe combine the use of a morphodynamic model for river meander planform evolution with a geological dataset to investigate the influence of external confinements on the long-term evolution of a meandering river flowing in an Alpine valley. The analysis focuses on a 100 km reach of the Adige River, NE Italy, which had several sinuous/meandering sections before being extensively channelized in the 1800s. Geological surveys and historical maps revealed that many sections of the study reach impinge on the borders of the valley during its evolution. Moreover, a marked spatial heterogeneity in floodplain vertical accretion rates likely reflects preferential positions of the river channel in the floodplain. Valley confinements are represented by bedrock outcrops and by alluvial fans created by lateral tributaries, and were extracted from the geological and historical maps to build the computational domain for the meander morphodynamic model. The model predicts the long-term planform evolution of a meandering river based on a linear solution of the 2D De St Venant-Exner differential system and can manage changes in floodplain erodibility. Model applications allow to isolate the effects of valley bedrock and of alluvial fans in constraining the lateral channel migration. Modeled river channel persistence maps are compared with the available geological information. The present work allows further insights into the role of external confinements to river meander belts, which have been conducted so far mostly assuming the channel to evolve in unconfined floodplains. Future research shall incorporate model components for floodplain vertical accretion rates and for the advancement of alluvial fans occurring at the same time scale considered for meander evolution.\n\nThe linkage between fluvial meander-belt morphodynamics and the depositional record improves paleoenvironmental interpretations, Western Interior Basin, Alberta, Canada\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDurkin, P.; Hubbard, S. M.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nEnhanced stratigraphic interpretations are possible when linkages between morphodynamic processes and the depositional record are resolved. Recent studies of modern and ancient meander-belt deposits have emphasized morphodynamic processes that are commonly understated in the analysis of stratigraphic products, such as intra-point bar erosion and rotation, counter-point-bar (concave bank-bench) development and meander-bend abandonment. On a larger scale, longitudinal changes in meander-belt morphology and processes such as changes in meander-bend migration rate, channel-belt width/depth ratio and sinuosity have been observed as rivers flow through the tidal backwater zone. However, few studies have attempted to recognize the impact of the backwater zone in the stratigraphic record. We consider ancient meander-belt deposits of the Cretaceous McMurray Formation and document linkages between morphodynamic processes and their stratigraphic product to resolve more detailed paleoenvironmental interpretations. The ancient meander belt was characterized by paleochannels that were 600 m wide and up to 50 m deep, resolved in a particularly high quality subsurface dataset consisting of 600 km2 of high-quality 3-D seismic data and over 1000 wellbores. A 3-D geocellular model and reconstructed paleochannel migration patterns reveal the evolutionary history of seventeen individual meander belt elements, including point bars, counter point bars and their associated abandoned channel fills. At the meander-bend scale, intra-point-bar erosion surfaces bound accretion packages characterized by unique accretion directions, internal stratigraphic architecture and lithologic properties. Erosion surfaces and punctuated bar rotation are linked to upstream changes in channel planform geometry (meander cut-offs). We provide evidence for downstream translation and development of counter-point bars that formed in response to valley-edge and intra-meander-belt confinement. At the meander\n\nModeling meander morphodynamics over self-formed heterogeneous floodplains\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBogoni, Manuel; Putti, Mario; Lanzoni, Stefano\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThis work addresses the signatures embedded in the planform geometry of meandering rivers consequent to the formation of floodplain heterogeneities as the river bends migrate. Two geomorphic features are specifically considered: scroll bars produced by lateral accretion of point bars at convex banks and oxbow lake fills consequent to neck cutoffs. The sedimentary architecture of these geomorphic units depends on the type and amount of sediment, and controls bank erodibility as the river impinges on them, favoring or contrasting the river migration. The geometry of numerically generated planforms obtained for different scenarios of floodplain heterogeneity is compared to that of natural meandering paths. Half meander metrics and spatial distribution of channel curvatures are used to disclose the complexity embedded in meandering geometry. Fourier Analysis, Principal Component Analysis, Singular Spectrum Analysis and Multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis are used to emphasize the subtle but crucial differences which may emerge between apparently similar configurations. A closer similarity between observed and simulated planforms is attained when fully coupling flow and sediment dynamics (fully-coupled models) and when considering self-formed heterogeneities that are less erodible than the surrounding floodplain.\n\nEvolution of cutoffs across meander necks in Powder River, Montana, USA\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nGay, G.R.; Gay, H.H.; Gay, W.H.; Martinson, H.A.; Meade, R.H.; Moody, J.A.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nOver a period of several decades, gullies have been observed in various stages of forming, growing and completing the cutoff of meander necks in Powder River. During one episode of overbank flow, water flowing over the down-stream bank of the neck forms a headctu. The headcut migrates up-valley, forming a gully in its wake, until it has traversed the entire neck, cutting off the meander. The river then follows the course of the gully, which is subsequently enlarged as the river develops its new channel. The complete process usually requires several episodes of high water: in only one of the five cases described herein was a meander cutoff initiated and completed during a single large flood.\n\nModeling the stratigraphy and preservation potential of meandering stream deposits\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTucker, G. E.; Clevis, Q.; Lock, G.; Lancaster, S.; Desitter, A.\n\n2003-12-01\n\nBoth natural and human-induced modes of river and floodplain behavior have the potential to obscure, expose, or even destroy portions of the archaeological record. In valley systems with actively meandering channels much material can be lost to lateral bank erosion. Conversely, floodplain aggradation can bury and therefore obscure sites. In this study we aim to quantify the preservation potential of fluvial units containing archaeological sites as a function of the natural process of meandering, climate change and increased land-use during the Holocene. We used the CHILD simulation model of landscape evolution to explore alternative scenarios in which these three factors are both varied independently and combined. Boundary and initial conditions for the model scenarios are based on the Holocene evolution of the archaeologically-rich Upper Thames Valley, which is known to have witnessed variations in flood frequency, land-clearance, episodic alluviation and river entrenchment. The CHILD model is set up to combine four components that simulate the development of valley and floodplain system: hillslope and channel erosion, lateral stream meandering, overbank deposition, and the accumulation of a 3D stratigraphy. The landscape is represented by an adaptable triangular mesh of nodes, especially suited for simulating the gradual shifting of meander bends. The new stratigraphic layering routine recently added to the model in improves the resolution of the stratigraphic record accumulated by the model. Simulation results reveal systematic controls on preservation potential, and suggest potential sources of bias in the archaeological record.\n\nHydrodynamics and Connectivity of Channelized Floodplains: Insights from the Meandering East Fork White River, Indiana, USA\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCzuba, J. A.; David, S. R.; Edmonds, D. A.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nHigh resolution topography reveals that meandering river floodplains in Indiana commonly have networks of channels. These floodplain channel networks are most prevalent in agricultural, low-gradient, wide floodplains. It appears that these networks are formed when floodplain channels connect oxbows to each other and the main river channel. Collectively, the channels in the floodplain create an interconnected network of pathways that convey water beginning at flows less than bankfull, and as stage increases, more of the floodplain becomes dissected by floodplain channels. In this work, we quantify the hydrodynamics and connectivity of the flow on the floodplain and in the main channel of the East Fork White River near Seymour, Indiana, USA. We constructed a two-dimensional numerical model using HECRAS of the river-floodplain system from LiDAR data and from main-channel river bathymetry to elucidate the behaviour of these floodplain channels across a range of flows. Model calibration and verification data included stage from a USGS gage, high-water marks at a high and medium flow, and an aerial photograph of inundation in the floodplain channels. The numerical model simulated flow depth and velocity, which was used to quantify connectivity of the floodplain channels, exchange between the main channel and floodplain channels, and residence time of water on the floodplain. Model simulations suggest that the floodplain channels convey roughly 50% of the total flow at what is typically considered \"bankfull\" flow. Overall, we present a process-based approach for analyzing complex floodplain-river systems where an individual floodplain-river system can be distilled down to a set of characteristic curves. Notably, we map the East Fork White River system to exchange-residence time space and argue that this characterization forms the basis for thinking about morphologic evolution (e.g., sediment deposition and erosion) and biogeochemistry (e.g., nitrate removal) in floodplain\n\nStream-power model of meander cutoff in gravel beds\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPannone, M.; De Vincenzo, A.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nIn the present study we propose a one-dimensional model for the prediction of the large-time evolution of river meanders (pre-cutoff conditions) characterized by gravel bed and negligible suspended load. Due to its relatively simple structure, it may be a fast and easy tool to forecast the time evolution of a bend when the symptoms of an incipient instability suggest quantifying the time left for river exploitation as a naturalistic or a commercial resource and timely planning, if needed, the site management and restoration. Most of the previous research on meandering rivers focused on linearized theories that apply to very small bend amplitudes and very large radii of curvature. The dynamics of meander growth and cutoff was typically afforded by case-sensitive numerical simulations or by descriptive methods aimed at deriving purely empirical laws relating the hydraulics to some geomorphological parameters. The present approach combines the immediacy of a general analytical model with the accuracy of a fluid-mechanical background. The model focuses on energetic principles and interprets the mechanism of meander cutoff as the achievement of limit conditions in terms of river stream power. The corresponding analytical solution, which consists in a 1-D deterministic integro-differential equation governing the meander pre-cutoff phase, accounts for the influence of the morphological and sedimentological parameters by the downstream migration rate and the radius of the meander osculating circle. The results, expressed in terms of instable meander lifetime, are in good agreement with the data obtained from a number of field surveys documented in literature. Additionally, the proposed fluid-mechanical model allows identifying the physical mechanisms responsible for some peculiarities of large-time meander evolution like the decreasing skewness and asymmetry.\n\nInteractions between hyporheic flow produced by stream meanders, bars, and dunes\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nStonedahl, Susa H.; Harvey, Judson W.; Packman, Aaron I.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nStream channel morphology from grain-scale roughness to large meanders drives hyporheic exchange flow. In practice, it is difficult to model hyporheic flow over the wide spectrum of topographic features typically found in rivers. As a result, many studies only characterize isolated exchange processes at a single spatial scale. In this work, we simulated hyporheic flows induced by a range of geomorphic features including meanders, bars and dunes in sand bed streams. Twenty cases were examined with 5 degrees of river meandering. Each meandering river model was run initially without any small topographic features. Models were run again after superimposing only bars and then only dunes, and then run a final time after including all scales of topographic features. This allowed us to investigate the relative importance and interactions between flows induced by different scales of topography. We found that dunes typically contributed more to hyporheic exchange than bars and meanders. Furthermore, our simulations show that the volume of water exchanged and the distributions of hyporheic residence times resulting from various scales of topographic features are close to, but not linearly additive. These findings can potentially be used to develop scaling laws for hyporheic flow that can be widely applied in streams and rivers.\n\nIntegration of fluvial erosion factors for predicting landslides along meandering rivers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, Yi-chin; Chang, Kang-tsung; Ho, Jui-yi\n\n2015-04-01\n\nRiver incision and lateral erosion are important geomorphologic processes in mountainous areas of Taiwan. During a typhoon or storm event, the increase of water discharge, flow velocity, and sediment discharge enhances the power of river erosion on channel bank. After the materials on toe of hillslope were removed by river erosion, landslides were triggered at outer meander bends. Although it has been long expected that river erosion can trigger landslide, studies quantifying the effects of river erosion on landslide and the application of river erosion index in landslide prediction are still overlooked. In this study, we investigated the effect of river erosion on landslide in a particular meanders landscape of the Jhoukou River, southern Taiwan. We developed a semi-automatic model to separate meandering lines into several reach segments based on the inflection points and to calculate river erosion indexes, e.g. sinuosity of meander, stream power, and stream order, for each reach segment. This model, then, built the spatial relationship between the reaches and its corresponding hillslopes, of which the toe was eroded by the reach. Based on the spatial relationship, we quantified the correlations between these indexes and landslides triggered by Typhoon Morakot in 2009 to examine the effects of river erosion on landslide. The correlated indexes were then used as landslide predictors in logistic regression model. Results of the study showed that there is no significant correlation between landslide density and meander sinuosity. This may be a result of wider channel dispersing the erosion at a meandering reach. On the other hand, landslide density at concave bank is significantly higher than that at convex bank in the downstream (stream order > 3), but that is almost the same in the upstream (stream order < 3). This may imply that river sediment play different roles between down- and upstream segments. River sediment in the upstream is an erosion agent vertically\n\nThe interaction between vegetation and channel dynamics based on experimental findings\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTeske, R.; Van Dijk, W. M.; Van De Lageweg, W.; Kleinhans, M. G.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nStrong feedbacks exist between river channel dynamics, floodplain development and riparian vegetation. Several experimental studies showed how uniformly sown vegetation causes a shift from a braided river to a single-thread and sometimes meandering river. The objective of this study is to test what the effect of fluvially distributed seeds and vegetation settling is on channel pattern change and channel dynamics. The experiments were carried out in a flume of 3 m wide and 10 m long. We tested where the vegetation deposited in a braided and meandering river and how the morphology changed. We used a simple hydrograph of 0.25 hour high flow and 3.75 hour low flow, where alfalfa seeds were added during high flow. The bed sediment consisted of a poorly sorted sediment mixture ranging from fine sand to fine gravel. The evolution was recorded by a high-resolution laser-line scanner and a Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) camera used for channel floodplain segmentation, water depth approximation and vegetation distribution. In an initially braided river, vegetation settled on the higher banks and stabilized the banks. In an initially meandering river, vegetation settled in the inner scrolls, and also on the outer banks when water level exceeded bankfull conditions. In agreement with earlier work, the outer bank was stabilized; erosion rate decreased and bends became sharper. The inner bend vegetation stabilized a part of the point bar and hydraulic resistance of the vegetation steered water in the channel and to the non-vegetated part of the inner bend. As result the meander bend became braided as water flows along the vegetation. Vegetation formed patches that grew over time and reduced channel dynamics. We conclude that self-settling vegetation decreased local bank erosion and that vegetated islands leads to a multi-thread system instead of single-threaded.\n\nImaging and locating paleo-channels using geophysical data from meandering system of the Mun River, Khorat Plateau, Northeastern Thailand\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNimnate, P.; Thitimakorn, T.; Choowong, M.; Hisada, K.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe Khorat Plateau from northeast Thailand, the upstream part of the Mun River flows through clastic sedimentary rocks. A massive amount of sand was transported. We aimed to understand the evolution of fluvial system and to discuss the advantages of two shallow geophysical methods for describing subsurface morphology of modern and paleo-channels. We applied Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) to characterize the lateral, vertical morphological and sedimentary structures of paleo-channels, floodplain and recent point bars. Both methods were interpreted together with on-sites boreholes to describe the physical properties of subsurface sediments. As a result, we concluded that four radar reflection patterns including reflection free, shingled, inclined and hummocky reflections were appropriated to apply as criteria to characterize lateral accretion, the meandering rivers with channel-filled sequence and floodplain were detected from ERT profiles. The changes in resistivity correspond well with differences in particle size and show relationship with ERT lithological classes. Clay, silt, sand, loam and bedrock were classified by the resistivity data. Geometry of paleo-channel embayment and lithological differences can be detected by ERT, whereas GPR provides detail subsurface facies for describing point bar sand deposit better than ERT.\n\nMeander morphodynamics over self-formed floodplains: can the migration history affect the future morphology of the river?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBogoni, M.; Lanzoni, S.; Putti, M.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFloodplains, and rivers therein, constitute complex systems whose simulation involves modeling of hydrodynamic, morphodynamic, chemical, and biological processes which act over a wide range of time scales (from days to centuries) and affect each other. Self-formed floodplains are produced by the sedimentary processes associated with the migration of river bends and the formation of abandoned oxbow lakes consequent to the cutoff of mature meanders. The erosion and deposition processes at the banks lead to heterogeneities in the surface composition, thus the river may experience faster or slower migration rates depending on the spatial distribution of the erosional resistance. As a consequence, the past spatial configurations of the river (i.e. the migration history) play a key role in shaping the successive river paths.We recently published a paper addressing the modeling of meander morphodynamics over self-formed heterogeneous floodplain. Results show that the heterogeneity in floodplain composition associated with the formation of geomorphic units (i.e., scroll bars and oxbow lakes) and the choice of a reliable flow field model to drive channel migration are two fundamental ingredients for reproducing correctly the long-term morphodynamics of alluvial meanders. We compare numerically generated planforms obtained for different scenarios of floodplain heterogeneity to natural meandering paths, through half meander metrics and spatial distribution of channel curvatures. Statistical and spectral tools disclose the complexity embedded in meandering geometry and the crucial differences between apparently similar configurations.Floodplain heterogeneity affects both the temporal and spatial distributions of meander geometry, and eventually leads to a closer statistical similarity between simulated and natural planform shapes when scroll bars and oxbow lakes left behind are harder to erode than the surrounding floodplain.\n\nThree-dimensional flow structure and patterns of bed shear stress in an evolving compound meander bend\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nEngel, Frank; Rhoads, Bruce L.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nCompound meander bends with multiple lobes of maximum curvature are common in actively evolving lowland rivers. Interaction among spatial patterns of mean flow, turbulence, bed morphology, bank failures and channel migration in compound bends is poorly understood. In this paper, acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements of the three-dimensional (3D) flow velocities in a compound bend are examined to evaluate the influence of channel curvature and hydrologic variability on the structure of flow within the bend. Flow structure at various flow stages is related to changes in bed morphology over the study timeframe. Increases in local curvature within the upstream lobe of the bend reduce outer bank velocities at morphologically significant flows, creating a region that protects the bank from high momentum flow and high bed shear stresses. The dimensionless radius of curvature in the upstream lobe is one-third less than that of the downstream lobe, with average bank erosion rates less than half of the erosion rates for the downstream lobe. Higher bank erosion rates within the downstream lobe correspond to the shift in a core of high velocity and bed shear stresses toward the outer bank as flow moves through the two lobes. These erosion patterns provide a mechanism for continued migration of the downstream lobe in the near future. Bed material size distributions within the bend correspond to spatial patterns of bed shear stress magnitudes, indicating that bed material sorting within the bend is governed by bed shear stress. Results suggest that patterns of flow, sediment entrainment, and planform evolution in compound meander bends are more complex than in simple meander bends. Moreover, interactions among local influences on the flow, such as woody debris, local topographic steering, and locally high curvature, tend to cause compound bends to evolve toward increasing planform complexity over time rather than stable configuration"
