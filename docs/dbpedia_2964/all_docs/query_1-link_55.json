        "text": "A rejection of the distortions of fascist ideology - Roma città aperta (1945)\n\nAccounts of the history of Italian cinema are dominated by the critical centrality of a cluster of films made between the mid-1940s and the mid-1950s and commonly described as Neo-Realist. The films themselves are relatively few, yet discussion of them has been substantial and has encompassed a complex range of theoretical, methodological, and historiographical debates.\n\nThe bulk of Neo-Realist films were made at a particularly sensitive time in the history of contemporary Italy, as the country emerged from over twenty years of fascist dictatorship (1922-1943). In the immediate post-war years, Neo-Realist films provided an immediate response to wipe out the material and ideological legacies of fascism. They denounced the horrors of the war and/or dealt with themes central to the agency of Reconstruction such as poverty, unemployment, shortage of housing, and social strife. Moreover, in their social and geographical inclusiveness, they represented a bid to redefine the co-ordinates of national and cultural identity uncontaminated by the legacy of fascism.\n\nCentral to this discourse was the construction of fascism itself as the antithesis of truth and authenticity. The realism of films like Roma città aperta ('Rome Open City', Roberto Rossellini, 1945), and Ladri di biciclette ('Bicycle Thieves', Vittorio De Sica, 1948) was perceived as a rejection of the distortions of fascist ideology and the culture it had engendered. As such, Neo-Realism was construed as constituting a radial break from the practices and values which had informed film production during the fascist regime.\n\nNeo-Realist films may be seen to depart quite radically from the conventions and production values of the studio system of the 1930s. Location shooting and use of available light resulted in more naturalistic photography, closer to the documentary than to the studio-made fiction film. In addition, the contemporary topicality of subject-matter, the focus on the lower-class milieux, and the casting of unglamorous minor stars, or even unknown non-professional actors, further distinguished the films from both indigenous studio productions and those of Hollywood.\n\nReleased in 1948 and directed by Vittorio De Sica, Ladri di Biciclette (1948) is heralded as one of the key movies in the Italian Neorealist movement.\n\nThe first film to be credited as Neo-Realist, Roma città aperta, can be seen to draw on both these documentary and subgeneric strands. The Neo-Realist corpus does not display the degree of stylistic coherency that would allow for easy categorization (and, indeed, the definition and selection of films seen to represent 'Neo-Realism' has been a matter of some dispute). The evidence of the films themselves is complicated. Some films may be seen to clearly indebted to popular forms of entertainment and existing film genres. Other films may be more aptly described as 'art cinema'. On the whole, the box office performance of Neo-Realist films was respectable.\n\nThe difficulties in identifying a clear set of features specific to Neo-Realist cinema are compounded by the persistence of undertainties over the origins of the term 'Neo-Realism' and its semantic content. What is clear, however, is that the word cannot be traced back to the consciously thought out and publicly circulated manifesto of a movement. It seems that the film editor Mario Serandrei was among the first to use the word when, in a letter to director Luchino Visconti, he employed it with reference to Ossessione (Luchino Visconti, 1943). Indeed, because of its use of real locations and uncompromisingly grim portrayal of the provincial fringes of Italian society during fascism, Ossessione has generally been regarded as a harbinger of post-war Neo-Realism.\n\nThe context in which Ossessione was produced and described as a Neo-Realist film, however, raises some interesting historical issues. Throughout the early 1940s Visconti and the screenwriters of Ossessione were writing articles for the specialist film journal Cinema, edited by Benito Mussolini's son Vittorio. Their articles insisted on the necessity of using realism in the development of a national film language. In doing so, they suggested models from both and indigenous tradition of high cultural literature and painting and from film styles, such as French poetic realism, and even, on occasions, from Hollywood film genres, such as the 1930s gangster film. The strongest emphasis, however, was placed on the power of landscape - and the human presence within it - to act as signifiers of Italian cultural identity.\n\nIn terms of critical discourse, the term 'Neo-Realism' did not acquire wide critical currency until the late 1940s, when it was also invested with a new range of meanings. Indeed, during the post-war years, it was the international critical acclaim with which some Italian films were received on the fast-growing art-house circuit which was to play a decisive role in shaping the canon of films and authors to which the term 'Neo-Realism' was applied.\n\nIt was the French critic André Bazin, in particular, who was to express highly influential views regarding the essence of the Neo-Realist phenomenon. Bazin's concern with the definition of an ontology of film language, and his belief that genuine film art derives from a phenomenological rather than analytical approach to the real, was strongly linked to his appraisal of Neo-Realism. He particularly valued a number of formal traits found in Rossellini's films such as elliptical narrative structure, the rejection of plot-enhancing detail, unpredictability of character motivation, use of long takes, and the preference for medium and long shots and rejection of close-ups. As a result of Bazin's influence, these formal traits became common terms in the description of the Neo-Realist style.\n\nWhile Bazin acknowledged the importance of the historical circumstances in which Neo-Realism had emerged, he did not see them as an essential part of its novelty or significance. In contrast, it was precisely a concern with these historical circumstances which structured the debate on Neo-Realism taking place in Italy. There, it was the construction of Neo-Ralealism as a movement with specifically national roots which defined the parameters of the term's currency in the critical discourse of leftist intellectuals. These writers were particularly concerned with placing Neo-Realism at the very core of the cultural reocnstruction of post-war, post-fascist Italy. Indeed, it was in the late 1940s, when the Cold War was beginning and the anti-fascist political front was breaking down, that the most intense period of debate around Neo-Realist cinema took place.\n\nThe parties of the left, and in particular the Communist Party (PCI), had been at the forefront of the anti-fascist Resistance; the PCI enjoyed considerable popular support, but soon after the war it was marginalized from the institutional political mainstream occupied by the conservative Christian Democrats (DC). The championing of Neo-Realism on the part of leftist intellectuals was consistent with the aim of reasserting the credentials of the left as the 'true' representative of a genuine national-popular tradition against both the persisting legacies of fascism and overwhelming American influence in the life and politics of the country.\n\nThe most compelling definition of Neo-Realism remains the one formulated by Cesare Zavattini, the screenwriter who teamed up regularly with Vittorio De Sica to produce such key Neo-Realist works as Ladri di biciclette and Umberto D. Zavattini maintained that the greatest achievement of Neo-Realist cinema was that it brought onto the screen the lives of ordinary people. For him, the aim of Neo-Realism had to be to rediscover, without embellishment or dramatization, the 'dailiness' of people's lives. He argued that the most minute and apparently insignificant detail of these lives was full of poetry as well as the 'echoes and reverberations' of the human condition.\n\nUmberto D (Vittorio De Sica, 1952)\n\nOther critics and filmmakers such as Luigi Chiarini, Giuseppe De Santis, Carlo Lizzani, and the editor of the Marxist journal Cinema nuovo, Guido Aristarco, were more explicit in placing the representation of social reality at the very core of the aesthetic and ethical commitments of Neo-Realism. From their perspective, the roots of the phenomenon in the socially progressive ideals of the Resistance represented its innermost essence. Thus, the promotion of a democratic sense of collective identity for the Italian people, and more specifically for the working classes, was considered the primary aim of Neo-Realism.\n\nThe critical discourse of the 1950s was dominated by a concern with the commercial and political bastardization of Neo-Realism. From the late 1940s onwards, new generic strands of the sentimental comedy (i.e. 'pink Neo-Realism') were at the forefront of the commercial resurgence of the domestic product. These films incorporated elements of mise-en-scène and thematic motifs from their worthier Neo-Realist predecessors, but they were generally denounced by critics, who saw in them a victory for commercialism and escapism over art and engagement (views which then necessarily reinforced a split between cinema d'autore (auteur or art cinema), on the other hand, and genre production, on the other). However, the attachment of many critics to criteria of Neo-Realist purity also complicated the discussion of the films made by those authors who had originally been most closely identified with Neo-Realism.\n\nIn diverse ways Riso amaro, Stromboli terra di Dio ('Stromboli', Roberto Rossellini, 1951), L'oro di Napoli ('Gold of Naples', Vittorio De Sica, 1954), Senso (Luchino Visconti, 1954), and La Strada (Federico Fellini, 1954), to name only a few of the most controversial cases, all departed from understood Neo-Realist orthodoxies.\n\nThroughout the 1950s Rossellini and Fellini defended the integrity and coherence of their work against what they saw as an imposition of ideological restrictions on the development of a 'new way of seeing'. In 1956, in a letter to Guido Aristarco, André Bazin reiterated this point, arguing that Rossellini and Fellini had remained faithful to the spirit of Neo-Realism in their aesthetic approach to the wholeness of human reality, its ambiguity and resistance to analysis. Aristarco, on the other hand, admired the formal accomplishments of the two author's films, but, in branding them spiritualistic and individualistic, emphatically rejected the idea that they were truly realist or free from ideological considerations.\n\nWhile these debates revealed differences regarding the relationship between form and content, and between art and ideology, in Neo-Realism there was none the less a shared belief in the value of the realist aesthetic. From the early 1960s onwards, however, a series of challenges were waged against existing definitions of Neo-Realism as an inherently innovative and progressive phenomenon. One of the most serious of these challenges stemmed from the reassessment of the historiography of fascism, the Resistance, and the post-war settlement.\n\nRecent work has reinstated some of Neo-Realism's importance for the study of Italian film history by providing a more detailed and exhaustive picture of the modes of production and consumption of film culture in post-war Italy. An important development in this respect has been the renegotiation of the boundaries between film and cultural studies, which has led to a greater emphasis on the role which film plays in relation to a nation's cultural history. The impact of Neo-Realism on domestic production has been analysed in relation to the viewing habits of Italian filmgoers in the 1940s and 1950s, the structures and institutions which regulated these habits and defined the scope of viewer's semantic competence. Neo-Realist films have also been studied for their relations with a wider spectrum of discursive and iconographical component of Italian culture.\n\nIt is no longer possible to take for granted the nature of cinematic realism or the ways in which Neo-Realist films have been implicated in often conflicting notions of national and cultural identities. This redefinition of the field of study suggests the importance of understanding these aesthetic practices in relation to specific historical and production contexts. Paradoxically, the continuing interest of Neo-Realism lies precisely in that it was neither a straightforwardly homogeneous or unitary phenomenon but successfully crossed the boundaries between highbrow and lowbrow, tradition and modernity, engagement and pleasure.\n\nIf the film industry has ever been a symbol of entertainment, in our society of spectacle the inclusion of movies in a modern art collection represents the opposite: critical skills.\n\nThe Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord. Originally published in 1967. The revolutionary thinker, Guy Debord was the leading figure of the French intellectual group who called themselves The Situationist International. His text, The Society of the Spectacle written in 1967 is one of the greatest theoretical examinations of our socio-cultural condition, describing in pinpoint accuracy, the dreadful corporate globalization craze currently sweeping the planet. His work was instrumental in sparking the student uprisings in Europe in the late sixties. In 1989 he published his \"Commentaries on the Society of the Spectacle\" Both texts are chillingly accurate descriptions of the world of simulation and lies that mankind has transformed his life into. In December of 1994, at the age of 62, Debord killed himself.\n\nEvery historical period tends to privilege some discursive modes above others and invent new fictions and forms of expression. These are instruments that successive generations conceive in order to approach a world in continuous change and, therefore, promote the particular vision of certain social groups above that from others.\n\nThe novel was, in the 19th century, the device that the bourgeoisie developed with the aim of conjuring their fears and wishes. Honoré de Balzac, Leo Tolstoi or George Eliot were clear examples of this phenomenon, reaching a degree of intensity, subtlety and social incidence which was hardly to be repeated in other ages. That was not only due to the literary achievements of their authors, but also to the permeability of that genre in the different social layers that, in spite of their diversity, did not stop identifying with the avatars and circumstances of their main characters.\n\nRussian author Leo Tolstoy wrote the acclaimed novels War and Peace, Anna Karenina and The Death of Ivan Ilyich, and still ranks among the world's top writers.\n\nIf we had to choose an artistic medium which incarnated the spirit of the 20th century, no doubt we would opt for cinema. This came to join the popular knowledge and the avant garde. Around it gathered both the masses in search of myths that everyday life denied them as well as the most critical voices of the industrialized world. Chaplin, for example, was the modern man par excellence. His mechanical movements searched to be precise and articulate, just like those of a machine. However, his clumsy appearance evidenced the shadows of a society whose prosperity continued settling in inequality.\n\nCharlie Chaplin was not a socialist, but he yearned for social justice. Having had a poor childhood, and after witnessing two world wars that revolved around each country trying to increase its sphere of influence regardless of the human losses, Charlie was bound to be sympathetic towards the Socialism ideas that showed him hope. The Great Dictator showed his hatred for fascism, but it was also out of concern for his fellow human beings.\n\nThe museum of modern art hurried to integrate cinema in its document archive. New York’s MOMA was founded in 1929 and in 1935 it already had its Film Library. However, modernity, carried by a determined willingness of separating the aesthetic disciplines and subordinating the artistic achievements to its formal autonomy, set cinema aside to the screening hall. A disembodied perception of the world was required and the black box favoured that the viewer integrated himself in the film story, apparently with no arbitration whatsoever. In fact, although some of the most avant-garde exhibition proposals of the period, such as those designed by El Lissitzky, Kiesler or Moholy-Nagy, included cinema as one of their basic mechanisms, it would not be until the last decades of the last century when its use became extended in biennials and museums. In the current classification of the collections of Museum Reina Sofía , cinema has a preferential place, next to painting, sculpture or drawing. Berlanga’s Welcome Mr Marshall or Hitchcock’s Rear Window gives us a better understanding of the continuum between art and cold war, the mutual surveillance to which the political blocs were submitted during the 1950s and 1960s, the importance of the visual in the partitioning of the sensical of that time and the difficulty to represent the other. Likewise, a series of films by Resnais, Buñuel, Keaton, Godard, Portabella or Almodovar, just to mention the best known, pave the way of the collection.\n\nWelcome, Mr. Marshall! (1953): After finding out that North American people are visiting the Spanish villages, the citizens of Villar del Río start preparing themselves to welcome them when they arrive.\n\nDespite the crisis which some sectors of the film industry are going through, we cannot state that the moving image, cinema in its broadest sense, has decayed during the last decades nor society’s capability to generate stories. However, it is true that the Web has radically transformed our discursive universe: we do not read or see what someone has written or filmed for us, we reconstruct it inexorably from the endless tangled mess of files put up on the internet. The virtual navigation, the hypertext reading, the almost infinite multiplicity of options which forces the user to choose and make the stores of his own, have reversed the trend of understanding what surrounds us. The digital revolution has replaced film, as a device, to a second level. Following the trail of those objects and practices which stopped being useful, cinema seems to have found a second life in the centre of the arts.\n\nThe transition from silent to sound films caused great upheaval in the film industry, requiring costly renovation of production facilities and movie theaters, ending the careers of many silent film stars, and making it more difficult to market films abroad. Hollywood took some time to overcome the artistic and technical challenges of sound film production, and the result was several years of mediocre output. For European filmmakers, production costs skyrocketed because Hollywood studios owned the patents to the new sound technology and licensed it at an exorbitant price.\n\nBy the mid-1930s, Hollywood entered a period of unparalleled success and stability, with five major studios (Paramount, Warner Brothers, MGM, RKO, and Twentieth Century Fox) and three minor studios (Universal, Columbia, and United Artists) cultivating distinct styles, genres, and stars. In 1934, under pressure from religious organizations such as the Legion of Decency, Hollywood enforced a Production Code that censored the content of its films, screening out foul language, depictions of “deviant” sexuality, narcotic use, and graphic violence. During World War II, Hollywood contributed enormously to the war effort through the production of propaganda films.\n\nMajor Movements\n\nFrench poetic realism: This movement, which emerged in the 1930s, is characterized by expressionistic, sublime imagery; fluid camera movements; deep-focus photography; and symbolic mise-en-scène. Its films show an understated humanism and profound empathy for their characters, who find themselves trapped between their desire for spontaneity and freedom and the social customs and hardships that constrain them. With World War II looming on the horizon, these films, while often whimsical and joyous, seem haunted by a sense of loss and impending doom. Key films include Jean Vigo’s Zéro de Conduite (1933) and L’Atalante (1934), Jean Renoir’s The Rules of the Game (1939), and Marcel Carné’s The Children of Paradise (1945).\n\nJean Renoir's The Rules of the Game (1939)\n\nMajor Directors\n\nCapra, Frank: Capturing the optimism of New Deal America, Capra became one of the most successful directors of the studio era through a series of well-crafted social dramas and comedies of manners, such as It Happened One Night (1934), that feature “everyman” protagonists, witty dialogue, and populist themes of justice and redemption. Many of Capra’s films make reformist political statements in the liberal tradition, featuring ordinary people who attempt to redress personal or systemic injustices by appealing to existing societal institutions: legal institutions in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), governmental in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), and media in Meet John Doe (1941).\n\nIt Happened One Night (1934) © Bettmann / Corbis: It Happened One Night.\n\nVon Sternberg, Josef: Like his German compatriot Fritz Lang, von Sternberg moved from Ufa to Hollywood in the 1930s after Hitler came to power. Known primarily for the seven films he made with Marlene Dietrich, including Blue Angel (1930) and The Devil is a Woman (1935), von Sternberg created a visual style defined by intricate and crowded mise-en-scène; spectacular and sexually suggestive sets, costumes, and props; and expressionistic lighting. Von Sternberg assailed the moral puritanism of American society through sophisticated visual symbolism and innuendo, integrating classical myths of female sexual power over men with Dietrich’s decidedly modern gender-bending persona and performances.\n\nHawks, Howard: In a career spanning more than 50 years, Hawks wrote and directed films considered among the best in their respective genres, notably the gangster film Scarface (1932), the screwball comedy His Girl Friday (1940), the detective film The Big Sleep (1946), and the western Red River (1948). Hawks’s films embody a quintessentially American and Protestant perspective, exploring the power of individual will and faith to overcome extreme natural conditions and social pressures. Hawks also created numerous strong, witty female characters, showcasing the talents of some of Hollywood’s finest actresses such as Lauren Bacall and Katharine Hepburn.\n\nHawks' The Big Sleep (1946)\n\nFord, John: The director of over 125 films, Ford is one of the most influential and written-about directors in cinematic history. He gained greatest acclaim for his picturesque and epic westerns, including Stagecoach (1939), My Darling Clementine (1946), and Rio Grande (1950). In these films, Ford explores the moral and psychological dilemmas facing individuals and communities on the border between civilization and wilderness. A cultural conservative, Ford’s vision of American history is steeped in the mythology of the frontier, where courage, loyalty, and honor fuel the drive toward survival and progress. Unlike von Sternberg and Welles, Ford worked successfully within the studio system, sharing its emphasis on expert storytelling and populist values, as well as its racism and historical revisionism.\n\nFord's Rio Grande (1950)\n\nDeren, Maya: Trained as a professional dancer and choreographer, Deren became the most important practitioner, theorist, and promoter of American avant-garde film during the 1940s and 1950s. In “poetic films” such as Meshes of the Afternoon (1943) and At Land (1944), Deren expressed the metaphysics of movement and action—the vertical meanings and feelings associated with a given moment rather than its place within the horizontal logic of narrative. Influenced by Freud’s psychoanalysis and Jung’s ideas of myth and ritual, Deren’s films are full of dreamlike, surrealist imagery that explores the relationship between conscious and subconscious states.\n\nDeren's Meshes of the Afternoon (1943)\n\nOther major directors: George Cukor, John Grierson, John Huston, Leni Riefenstahl, Preston Sturges, Billy Wilder, William Wyler.\n\nAlthough the earliest instances of modernist artists planning and making films were in Russia and Italy in the 1910s, it was in the 1920s that the term 'avant-garde' began to be applied to film, as part of a new kind of discourse about cinema. What proved crucial was the self-definition of a group of French filmmakers, who were also active as critics and theorists. Louis Delluc and Jean Epstein, together with Abel Gance, Marcel L'Herbier, Germaine Dulac, and Henri Chomette, all subscribed to a preocupation with film's 'specificity', in order to demonstrate the legitimacy of cinema as an art in its own right. They shared a common interest in exploring the optical and psychological power of the film image, focusing on the concept of photogénie. They also spawned a support system of film clubs, specialized cinemas, and magazines, all devoted to the promotion of film as a modern art; and this network soon spread beyond France, creating a sympathetic context for innovative work from elsewhere.\n\nBy the end of the 1920s more mainstream critics had institutionalized the avant-garde as a kind of 'Research & Development' department, present to a greater or lesser degree in most major national schools of filmmaking. But if the avant-gardes were gaining mainstream acceptance, they had also already come under fire from a number of positions which equally could be - and often are - considered avant-garde. First came the attack of the Soviet left, also composed of filmmaker-critics, and led by Sergei Eisenstein. In a polemical reply to a 1926 German article, Eisenstein challenged the claim that Soviet montage films, like all serious cinema, depended on the 'figurative quality of the [individual] shot'. Instead of 'literary' or 'pictorial', shots, Eisenstein argued for the 'director's' or 'compositional' shot, which is conceived as an integral part of the montage sequence; and in doing so he dismissed the work of the French avant-garde as 'children's playthings', which merely exploit the 'photographic possibilities of the apparatus' - in terms similar to those he would also use against his equally polemical Soviet contemporary Dziga Vertov.\n\nNeither Eisenstein nor the other new Soviet filmmakers who emerged after 1924 would have accepted the label 'avant-garde', regarding it as symptomatic of a bourgeois conception of art. Yet they were committed to challenging Soviet audiences' conservatism by means of experiment; and such experiments would often not be 'intelligible to the millions'. The Soviet left's refusal of avant-garde status and willingness to 'battle with public taste' marked a rejection both on the autonomy of aesthetics and of an implicitly élitist view of art.\n\nAnother challenge to the self-declared French avant-garde in the late 1920s came from closer to home. The Surrealist movement, composed initially of writers, although with a growing number of visual artists, declared its opposition to all conventional art in the name of a call to revolt. Surrealist activity, in whatever genre, aimed to provoke, to scandalize, and to seek new forms of self-expression and pleasure. But Surrealists vigorously rejected this conscription.\n\nUn Chien Andalou (1929)\n\nThe Surrealist and Soviet 'anti-avant-gardes' were to have a lasting influence on the cinema at large, far beyond the relatively short duration of the original movements. Their key films became the 'classics' pf the 1920s, when histories of cinema began to be written in the following decade, and have largely remained so ever since. The prestige of their leading figures - Eisenstein, Pudovkin, and Vertov; Buñuel, Dalí, and Jean Vigo - became linked to the appeal of Soviet montage's dialectic and of the Surrealist belief in the unconscious as cyphers for Marxism and Freudianism respectively. Thanks in large part to these alliances, film was acquiring a new status, which allowed it to engage with the most serious cultural and political issues of the day.\n\nBy 1930 the new film culture spawned by the avant-gardes had produced its own radical film clubs, magazines, distribution networks - and an emerging generation of filmmakers and activists already steeped in the ideologies and debates of the rival avant-gardes. Many of these would become leaders of the documentary movements which were typical of the 1930s: figures like John Grierson, Ivor Montagu, Len Lye, and Humphrey Jennings in Britain, Joris Ivens in the Netherlands, and Henri Storck in Belgium.\n\nThe fact that much pioneering cinema history was written under the influence of the early Soviet and/or Surrealist positions has meant that the received history of film still echoes many of the original battles, and indeed often follows the contours of these highly polemical movements.\n\nThe Surrealist critic and filmmaker Jacques Brunius stressed how the French avant-garde emerged from a combination of dissatisfaction with existing French cinema at the end of the First World War and the new stimuli of German Expressionism, American comedy, Swedish mysticism, and Soviet montage. He dismissed much of its output as pretentious, but defended the importance of the aesthetic issues it raised and the need to break 'the routine of a developing academicism', which in turned paved the way for French cinema's great achievements in the more accessible genres of satirical comedy and poetic realism in the 1930s.\n\nL'entr-acte (1924) - Dada meets cinema in this cornerstone of the 'historic avant-garde', which was originally commissioned to be shown during the interval of the ballet Relâche.\n\nThe avant-gardes of the 1920s are still being explored; neglected work comes to light; and the known threshold of avant-garde film activity itself is pushed back to the early years of the century, contemporary with the birth of the seminal Futurist and Cubist avant-gardes out of late Symbolism. But even as the historiography of the avant-gardes grows more sophisticated, this prompts new debates. The concept of the avant-garde has seemed intrinsically European - perhaps, indeed, a differentiating feature of European cinema in the post-First World War era, when Hollywood began to consolidate its global domination.\n\nHowever, the most fundamental question, implicit in many recent interventions, is whether it makes sense to continue thinking of any film as 'avant-garde', instead of as an 'independent' or an artist's film.\n\nPolitical economy conceals the estrangement in the nature of labor by ignoring the direct relationship between the worker (labor) and production. It is true that labor produces marvels for the rich, but it produces privation for the worker. It produces palaces, but hovels for the worker. It produces beauty, but deformity for the worker. It replaces labor by machines, but it casts some of the workers back into barbarous forms of labor and turns others into machines. It produces intelligence, but it produces idiocy and cretinism for the worker.\n\nWhat constitutes the alienation of labor?\n\nFirstly, the fact that labor is external to the worker -- i.e., does not belong to his essential being; that he, therefore, does not confirm himself in his work, but denies himself, feels miserable and not happy, does not develop free mental and physical energy, but mortifies his flesh and ruins his mind. Hence, the worker feels himself only when he is not working; when he is working, he does not feel himself. He is at home when he is not working, and not at home when he is working. His labor is, therefore, not voluntary but forced, it is forced labor. It is, therefore, not the satisfaction of a need but a mere means to satisfy needs outside itself. Its alien character is clearly demonstrated by the fact that as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, it is shunned like the plague. External labor, labor in which man alienates himself, is a labor of self-sacrifice, of mortification. Finally, the external character of labor for the worker is demonstrated by the fact that it belongs not to him but to another, and that in it he belongs not to himself but to another. Just as in religion the spontaneous activity of the human imagination, the human brain, and the human heart, detaches itself from the individual and reappears as the alien activity of a god or of a devil, so the activity of the worker is not his own spontaneous activity. It belongs to another, it is a loss of his self.\n\nThe result is that man (the worker) feels that he is acting freely only in his animal functions -- eating, drinking, and procreating, or at most in his dwelling and adornment -- while in his human functions, he is nothing more than animal.\n\nKarl Marx, The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts\n\nIn any kind of creative work the creating person unites himself with his material, which represents the world outside of himself. Whether a carpenter makes a table, or a goldsmith a piece of jewelry, whether the peasant grows his corn or the painter paints a picture, in all types of creative work the worker and his object become one, man unites himself with the world in the process of creation. This, however, holds true only for productive work, for work in which I plan, produce, see the result of my work. In the modern work process of a clerk, the worker on the endless belt, little is left of this uniting quality of work. The worker becomes an appendix to the machine or to the bureaucratic organization. He has ceased to be he—hence no union takes place beyond that of conformity.\n\nErich Fromm, The Art of Loving\n\nAre these principles still valid nowadays?\n\nDoes this happen in all countries or only in some?\n\nWhat's the difference between creative and forced work?\n\nIs every kind of work alienating?\n\nExplain the negative consequences of work\n\nHow could work become satisfactory for all?\n\nChaplin's last silent film, filled with sound effects, was made when everyone else was making talkies. Charlie turns against modern society, the machine age, and progress. During his last performance ever, the Tramp (Charlie Chaplin's most memorable on-screen character, a recognized icon of world cinema most dominant during the silent film era) struggles to live in modern industrial society with the help of a young homeless woman. Firstly we see him frantically trying to keep up with a production line, tightening bolts. He is selected for an experiment with an automatic feeding machine, but various mishaps leads his boss to believe he has gone mad, and Charlie is sent to a mental hospital. When he gets out, he is mistaken for a communist while waving a red flag, sent to jail, foils a jailbreak, and is let out again. We follow Charlie through many more escapades before the film is out.\n\nAlthough it was technically possible to make the Tramp speak when the movie was made, Chaplin didn't intend to do so. On the other hand, he introduced a soundtrack. Write down the different kinds of sounds that appear along the film.\n\nSilent films used different techniques that allowed the viewer to follow the story: the introduction of brief explanatory texts and the actors performances. Note the difference between Chaplin's and the rest of the characters acting compared to those in sound films.\n\nThe film shows work organization during a period called the Second Industrial Revolution. This sort of organization was known as Fordism (A manufacturing philosophy that aims to achieve higher productivity by standardizing the output, using conveyor assembly lines, and breaking the work into small deskilled tasks. Whereas Taylorism (on which Fordism is based) seeks machine and worker efficiency, Fordism seeks to combine them as one unit, and emphasizes minimization of costs instead of maximization of profit. Named after its famous proponent, the US automobile pioneer Henry Ford (1863-1947). Based on your observation, write down the measures taken in order to increase work productivity and the effects they have on the employees.\n\nWhat's the ultimate purpose of showing the Tramp being force-fed by a \"modern\" feeding machine? Why does the employer reject it after all?\n\nDirected in 1936, Modern Times also depicts the consequences of a real historical event: The Wall Street Crash of 1929, also known as Black Tuesday or the Stock Market Crash of 1929, which provoked a worldwide economic crisis. Companies closed down in the U.S. and their employees became unemployed, which led to a growth of socially marginalized ghettos. More than one million people lived in tin and cardboard homes without the the minimum hygiene, health and safety conditions. The difference between social classes became significant, since the ones who kept their job were benefited when the prices went down. During the film's screening, consider Chaplin's attitude towards these events and how you can relate the events shown in the movie with today's reality.\n\nThe role of the female character, the gamine (a slim, often boyish, elegant, wide-eyed young woman who is, or is perceived to be, mischievous, teasing or sexually appealing) is to minimize the strong political connotations of the movie. Chaplin, accused of being a communist had to exile to the U.S. Once there, he was accused of being an anti-capitalist, which created him many enemies. Consider every political tendency depicted in the film.\n\nPLOT SUMMARY - Below are the most significant scenes. Please write down your thoughts about each of them so we can have a further discussion:\n\nAccelerating assembly line where the Tramp screws nuts at an ever-increasing rate onto pieces of machinery. Alternated shots of the employees and the employer.\n\nForce-feeding machine.\n\nNervous breakdown, the factory is thrown into chaos. The Tramp is sent to a hospital.\n\nUnemployment, Communist demonstration, Jail.\n\nCocaine and its effects.\n\nThe gamine's father dies and the sisters are separated.\n\nThe Tramp gets out of jail against his will and finds a job at the shipyard.\n\nThe gamine and the tramp are arrested and reunited in the paddy wagon. Freedom.\n\nDreams of a better life.\n\nJob as a night watchman at a department store. Fired again.\n\nReal happiness at the run-down shack.\n\nFactory's reopening. The tramp gets his boss trapped in machinery, but manages to extricate him. The other workers decide to go on strike.\n\nThe Gamin becomes a café dancer. The tramp finds a job as a singer and a waiter.\n\nNew police intervention and new escape.\n\nFURTHER ANALYSIS:\n\nIn spite of the dramatic events, the film proves to be a comedy. Did you find it funny? Which would you find the funnier scenes? Why?\n\nDuring the first scene a flock of sheep is shown, which is a strong metaphor.\n\nIs there any moment in which it's difficult to understand the plot because of the lack of conversation?\n\nWhat measures do the employees take to face the economic crisis?\n\nHow do the powerful industrialists react towards their employees. Do you agree with the police intervention?\n\nWhich sequences compare and contrast better the workers' misery and the higher classes' opulence? There's a moment in which a parallelism between dream / reality is used to depict such inequality. Explain it.\n\nWhen everything seems to be alright, a new police intervention devastates the main characters. How do they react? Is it a happy or sad ending? What kind of shot does the director use to transmit that emotion? Describe the last shot and explain its symbolic value.\n\nThe original ending was different: The gamin became a nurse while the tramp recovered from a nervous breakdown at the hospital. Why do you think this was modified? Which ending do you prefer?\n\nConsider all the points above and publish your thoughts on your own blog.

Its unique power was a “matter of making images seen”. It is precisely this harnessing of visibility, this act of showing and exhibition which cinema before 1906 displays most intensely. Its inspiration for the avant-garde of the early decades of the 20th century needs to be re-explored.\n\nWritings by the early modernists (Futurists, Dadaists, and Surrealists) on the cinema follow a pattern similar to Leger: enthusiasm for this new medium and its possibilities; and disappointment at the way it has already developed, its enslavement to traditional art forms, particularly theatre and literature.\n\nMarcel Duchamp and Man Ray. Dadaism at its full glory.\n\nThe history of early cinema, like the history of cinema generally, has been written and theorized under the hegemony of narrative films. Early filmmakers like Smith, Méliès, and Porter have been studied primarily from the viewpoint of their contribution to film as a storytelling medium, particularly the evolution of narrative editing.\n\nEarly cinema was not dominated by the narrative impulse that later asserted its sway over the medium. Actuality film plays an important role in early film production. The Lumière tradition of “placing the world within one’s reach” through travel films and topical did not disappear with the exit of the Cinématographe from film production. But even within non-actuality filming – what has sometimes been referred to as the “Méliès tradition” – the role narrative plays is quite different than in traditional narrative film. Méliès himself declared in discussing his working method:\n\n“As for the scenario, the “fable”, or “tale” I only consider it at the end. I can state that the scenario constructed in this manner has no importance, since I use it merely as a pretext for the “stage effects”, the “tricks”, or for a nicely arranged tableau”.\n\nLumière and Méliès are united in a conception that sees cinema less as a way of telling stories than as a way of presenting a series of views to an audience, fascinating because of their illusory power (whether the realistic illusion of motion offered to the first audiences by Lumière, or the magical illusion concocted by Méliès), and exoticism. In other words, the relation to the spectator set up by the films of both Lumière and Méliès (and many other filmmakers before 1906) had a common basis, and one that differs from the primary spectator relations set up by narrative film after 1906. This earlier conception of cinema is called “the cinema of attractions”.\n\nThe cinema of attraction does not disappear with the dominance of narrative, but rather goes underground, both into certain avant-garde practices and as a component of narrative films, more evident in some genres (e.g., the musical) than in others.\n\nThe cinema of attraction is an exhibitionist cinema that bases itself on its ability to show something. It constructs a relationship with its spectator by means of the recurring look at the camera by actors. This action which is later perceived as spoiling the realistic illusion of the cinema, is here undertaken with brio, establishing contact with the audience. From comedians smirking at the camera, to the constant bowing and gesturing of the conjurors in magic films, this is a cinema that displays its visibility, willing to rupture a self-enclosed fictional world for a chance to solicit the attention of the spectator.\n\nGeorges Méliès' A Trip to the Moon (1902)\n\nIn the earliest years of exhibition the cinema was an attraction. Early audiences went to exhibitions to see machines demonstrated rather than to view films. It was the Cinématographe, the Biograph or the Vitascope that were advertised on the variety bills in which they premiered. After the initial novelty period, this display of the possibilities of cinema continues, and not only in magic films, Many of the close-ups in early film differ from later uses of the technique precisely because they do not use enlargement for narrative punctuation, but as an attraction in its own right.\n\nThe term “attractions” comes from Eisenstein and his attempt to find a new model and mode of analysis for the theatre. An attraction aggressively subjected the spectator to “sensual or psychological impact”. According to Eisenstein, theatre should consist of a montage of such attractions, creating a relation to the spectator entirely different from his absorption in “illusory imitativeness”.\n\nSergei Eisenstein\n\nThe enthusiasm of the early avant-garde for film was at least partly an enthusiasm for a mass culture that was emerging at the beginning of the century, offering a new sort of stimulus for an audience not acculturated to the traditional arts. It is important to take this enthusiasm for popular art as something more than a simple gesture of épater les bourgeoise.\n\nWriting of the variety theatre, Marinetti not only praised its aesthetics of astonishment and stimulation, but particularly its creation of a new spectator who contrasts with the “static”, “stupid voyeur” of traditional theatre. The spectator at the variety theatre feels directly addressed by the spectacle and joins in, singing along, heckling the comedians. Dealing with early cinema within the context of archive and academy, we risk missing its vital relation to vaudeville, its primary place of exhibition until around 1905. Film appeared as one attraction on the vaudeville programme, surrounded by a mass of unrelated acts in a non-narrative and even nearly illogical succession of performances. Even when presented in the nickelodeons that were emerging at the end of this period, these short films always appeared in a variety format, trick films sandwiched in with farces, actualities, “illustrated songs,” and quite frequently, cheap vaudeville acts. It was precisely this non-narrative variety that placed this form of entertainment under attack by reform groups in the early 1910s.\n\nFollies Revue, late 1910s vaudeville\n\nThe period from 1907 to about 1913 represents the true narrativization of the cinema, culminating in the appearance of feature films which radically revised the variety format. Film clearly took the legitimate theatre as its model, producing famous players in famous plays. The transportation of filmic discourse that D.W. Griffith typifies bound cinematic signifiers to the narration of stories and the creation of a self-enclosed diegetic universe. The look at the camera becomes taboo and the devices of cinema are transformed from playful “tricks” – cinematic attractions (Méliès gesturing at us to watch the lady vanish) – to elements of dramatic expression, entries into the psychology of character and the world of fiction.\n\nJust as the variety format in some sense survived in the Movie Palaces of the 1920s (with newsreel, cartoon, sing-along, orchestra performance and sometimes vaudeville acts subordinated to, but still co-existing with, the narrative feature of the evening), the system of attraction remains an essential part of popular filmmaking.\n\nThe chase film shows how towards the end of this period (basically from 1903-1906) a synthesis of attractions and narrative was already underway. The chase had been the original truly narrative genre of the cinema, providing a model for casuality and linearity as well as a basic editing continuity. A film like Biograph’s Personal (1904, the model for the chase film in many ways) shows the creation of a narrative linearity, as the French nobleman runs for his life from the fiancées his personal column ad has unleashed. However, at the same time, as the group of young women pursue their prey towards the camera in each shot, they encounter some slight obstacle (a fence, a steep slope, a stream) that slows them down for the spectator, providing a mini-spectacle pause in the unfolding of narrative.\n\nA film like The Great Train Robbery (1903) points in two directions, toward a direct assault on the spectator (the spectacularly enlarged outlaw unloading his pistol in our faces), and towards a linear narrative continuity.\n\nEdwin S. Porter's The Great Train Robbery (1903)\n\nBoth Eisenstein and Marinetti planned to exaggerate the impact on the spectator, Marinetti proposing to literally glue them to their seats and Eisenstein setting firecrackers off beneath them. Every change in film history implies a change in its address to the spectator, and each period constructs its spectator in a new way.\n\nThe famous sign in Los Angeles, California was erected in 1923 to advertise a new housing development. Later it was modified to read as it does today, simply \"Hollywood\".\n\nThe world cinema is mainly organized as an industry, that is a collection of business seeking profits through film production, film distribution, and the presentation of movies to audiences (theatres, TV, video, Youtube, Itunes, etc.).\n\nSince the 1920s, one industry, Hollywood, has dominated the world. That’s why the history of the film industry begins there, not because it has produced the best films, but because it has forced all other national cinemas to begin by dealing with the power of Hollywood as an industry (CULTURAL IMPERIALISM).\n\nHollywood is an industry that consists of three components:\n\nPRODUCTION: The creation of a film. Since the 1910s this has been done in studios in the L.A. area.\n\nDISTRIBUTION: Once films are made, Hollywood companies sell their films around the world. Worldwide distribution is the basis of Hollywood’s power and no other film industry has been as far-reaching for as long as Hollywood.\n\nPRESENTATION: Finally, movies are watched in theatres and cinemas, and on television at home. Since the 1960s most people see most movies at home on TV.\n\nA collection of major studio corporations (Hollywood) came to dominate the production, distribution, and exhibition of movies and continued to maintain its control through the coming of sound, the innovation of colour and widescreen images, and the diffusion of TV and home video.\n\nThe history of Hollywood as an industry is divided into four key periods:\n\n1) The rise of Hollywood, from the late 19th century to the coming of sound:\n\nThe motion picture industry in the U.S. grew from its origins during the final years of the 19th century to consolidation into an oligopoly (that is, control by a few corporations) in 1930, amidst the coming of sound.\n\nThrough the decade of the 1890s into the early days of the 20th century inventors worked with the first filmmakers and exhibitors to persuade a sceptical public to embrace the movie show.\n\nThe early inventors and entrepreneurs sought to sell their discoveries through the existing entertainment industries. The vaudeville (or variety) hall provided the first business outlet, which gave way to the nickelodeons, the thousands of theatres that from 1905 to 1910 presented hour-long all-movie shows; it was the nickelodeon that formed the basis of the film industry that within a decade became Hollywood.\n\nFinally, Hollywood came to stand for world distribution and presentation with a sudden technical change – the coming of sound. The popularity of the talkies enabled new companies such as Warner Bros. to rise to power and join the small list of major studios including Paramount, Loew’s, and other powerful corporations of the silent era, which not only retained but increased their power.\n\n2) The studio era of the 1930s and 1940s:\n\nThe coming of sound consolidated Hollywood’s control over the world market and moved the U.S. into the studio era in which filmmaking, distribution, and exhibition were dominated by five theatre corporations: Paramount, Loew’s (parent company to the more famous MGM), Fox Film (later 20th Century Fox), Warner Bros., and RKO. They ruled Hollywood during the 1930s and 1940s and operated around the world as fully integrated business enterprises.\n\nIt was theatre ownership rather than studio production which defined the status of Hollywood in this era. By controlling picture palaces in all of the downtown areas across the U.S., the major studios took three-quarters of the average box-office receipts.\n\nUniversal Pictures, Columbia Pictures, and United Artists constituted the studio era’s “Little Three” and led the scramble for these left-over film revenues. While always considered part of the Hollywood studio colossus, these corporations could never match the economic muscle of the Big Five because they did not own the top (exclusively first-run) theatres.\n\n3) The TV broadcasting age beginning with the rise of TV in the 1950s:\n\nThe decline of the studio era was the result of three main factors: the Paramount antitrust decrees (the U.S. Federal Government forced the Big Five to sell their movie palaces, and suddenly Hollywood lost direct control of and access to the movie market), the social transformation of the U.S. with suburbanization and the baby boom, and the emergence of a moving-image rival, television.\n\nOnce television programming commenced in the U.S. after WWII, movie fans stayed at home, attracted by “free” (i.e. funded by advertising) television entertainment. Going out to the movies suddenly became a relatively expensive night out, requiring a long journey downtown. Television entertainment was so much cheaper that millions of citizens of the U.S. simply stayed at home.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s the film industry adjusted to these new circumstances, first with auto theatres (drive-ins) and then with cinemas in shopping-malls, the long-term solution. In this completely new network of venues Hollywood also differentiated its product from black-and-white television with the development of widescreen and colour images.\n\nThe moves towards independent filmmaking represented a new mode of Hollywood production. Independent producers put together packages of stars, a story, and production values which they turned into feature films that were distributed by a studio. In this formulation, the studio boss is seen to lose his former power, while that of the director as auteur is seen to increase.\n\n1950s drive in movie theatre\n\n4) The era inaugurated by the coming of the feature film blockbuster in the mid-1970s:\n\nBy the mid-1970s Hollywood as an industry had adjusted to a new world of flexible film production and the new suburban audiences captured by TV. A new era for Hollywood as a film industry began in the mid-1970s following the innovation of the blockbuster, exemplified by such films as Jaws (1975) and Star Wars (1977).\n\nHollywood as an industry has also continued to redefine itself, principally by adding to its technological bag of tricks. Computers in particular have enabled filmmakers to craft special effects to live action and animation in a way which was simply not possible before.\n\nIt is the new ways and places to watch movies – especially cable, satellite, and video – that have defined the era of contemporary cinema. A handful of companies formed more than a half century ago still have hegemony over the creation of the movies and the distribution of them throughout the world. Since the end of the Second World War the Hollywood major studios have survived the enforced selling of their theatre chains, the rise of network TV, the advent of cable and pay TV, the video cassette revolution, and the arrival of digitalization. These companies may have new owners, but they show no signs of weakening – if anything. They are getting stronger.\n\nStar Wars Premiere, August 3rd 1977.\n\nThe six media conglomerates which dominate contemporary Hollywood (Disney, Twentieth Century Fox, Universal, Paramount, Columbia, and Warner Bros) now possess a power and cohesion against which the oligopoly of the Hollywood studios during the 1930s and 1940s simply pales in comparison.\n\nAs with all aspects of capitalism in the U.S., the mass media industries are shaped by forces found in the investment banking community, commonly known as Wall Street. However, it is corporations, rather than bankers, that hold the key to power and control in the US motion picture industry.\n\nThe corporations that controlled Hollywood in the 1930s, as the Great Depression commenced, have remained as the top corporations. No new corporation as a major studio has been created, although many have tried.\n\nTo take Hollywood as a simple industrial centre is misleading. The centre of power of the film industry based in Hollywood has, since the close of WWI, rested with its control over international distribution. The Hollywood industry has long dominated bookings around the globe, and film box-office figures in the U,S,, even with blockbusters, are small in comparison with the total take from all sources around the world.\n\nPeople in the U.S. watch a lot of TV and film, and once we pile up all those minutes, the time commitment comes to 250 billion hours per year. If we take the average hourly wage in the U.S, to be about $10, we come to a couple of trillion dollars of time invested.\n\nFrom: Douglas Gomery's Hollywood as industry"
