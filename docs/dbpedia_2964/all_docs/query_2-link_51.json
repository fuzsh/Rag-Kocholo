        "text": "SNOWFLAKE (AZFamily) — An Arizona woman was shot in her own bed after a man broke into her home.\n\nThe bullet came just millimeters from hitting her brain and killing her. The woman, named Anne, says the man who shot her was a stranger who lived near her parent’s home where she was staying in Snowflake, which is about three hours northeast of Phoenix.\n\nAnne lost her eye when then-18-year-old Joel Hernandez shot her in the face in December.\n\nHe broke into her home when she was trying to sleep. She says she does not know why she was targeted.\n\nHernandez plead guilty to the crime in May and next week will learn his fate in a courtroom.\n\n“I look up in the doorway and he’s standing there with the door closed behind him in my room,” Anne said. “He had the gun like this and went, ‘Shhh’ to me.”\n\nTraumatizing moments for Anne, who says she was trying to sleep when now Hernandez was standing over her, threatening her with a gun to her head.\n\n“He came up and crouched down next to me,” she said. “I could smell the alcohol on his breath, and he tried to get me to take off my clothes. I kept telling him no, no.”\n\nShe said he was getting frustrated and shot her.\n\n“It went down my forehead, in between my skull, on top of my brain, out my eye, down my cheek and into my shoulder,” Anne said.\n\nIf the bullet had gone differently, it would have hit her brain.\n\nShe was rushed to a Show Low hospital then flown to a Phoenix hospital.\n\n“I just feel lucky I wasn’t killed, and I can see my kids grown up and get married and have grandkids,” she said.\n\nAnne says she feels like he had been watching her for months.\n\n“His bedroom window faced our front door,” she said.\n\nThe Navajo County Attorney’s Office says Hernandez has pleaded guilty to attempted second-degree murder and burglary as well as three previous crimes, including unlawful use of transportation, criminal damage and threatening or intimidation.\n\n“I’m hoping he is charged to the fullest and that he will never get out and he will never do something like this to someone else,” she said.\n\nAnne says she has emotional and physical scars from that night and plans to be at court with her family by her side.\n\n“I have PTSD, very bad anxiety and panic attacks,” she said. “When I hear noises outside, I freak out.”\n\nAnne says her insurance won’t cover the cost of surgery on her eye because they are considering it as an elective or cosmetic procedure.\n\nHer family has created a GoFundMe for that recovery.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?
