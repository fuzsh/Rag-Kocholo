Seranella's protagonist is, like the author herself, a veteran of life on the streets, a former drug addict, and a car mechanic. Seranella's \"flawed but appealing heroine,\" as Miranda \"Munch\" Mancini is described by a contributor to Publishers Weekly, has gained a wide readership and critical approval in a handful of novels that often pair her with Los Angeles Police Department detective Mace St. John. The novels trace Munch from a hooker and drug addict to mechanic, single mom, and part-time detective, often working out aspects of her own past along the way.\n\nBorn in Santa Monica, Seranella grew up in affluent Pacific Palisades; her two brothers attended Stanford University, and a similar future was in store for her until she left home at age fourteen. As she told Bettijane Levine in the Los Angeles Times, \"I got into liquor and drugs and underwent a complete personality change.\" She made her way to San Francisco in the early 1970s, where she had some run-ins with the law, and then joined a commune, getting more involved in the drug life. At the commune, one positive thing happened: she learned how to fix cars, inspired by some of the young dropout mechanics there. Her parents tracked her down after a couple of years but could do nothing to change her ways. She went from cocaine to heroin; by the time she was twenty-one, she was already a veteran of California jails. She finally, however, began to turn her life around, finding employment as a mechanic in gas station garages, working for seventeen years in the trade. \"I was a really good mechanic,\" she told Levine, \"the person everyone came to when they had a problem that couldn't be fixed.\" After marrying her boss, she decided that she did not want to be a mechanic when she reached fifty, and sat down to write her first mystery.\n\nAnn Shields noted in the Los Angeles Times that Seranella's first book, No Human Involved, is a novel of \"redemption.\" In this first outing, Munch—short for Munchkin—is on drugs and booze and working as a prostitute. She becomes the chief suspect in the murder of her own father, the \"no human involved\" of the title—the phrase is cynical insider cop talk for a crime in which transients or other undesirables are the victims. Munch had no great love for her father, who got her hooked on drugs and then pimped her. When Detective Mace St. John comes to pick her up for questioning, she gives him the slip and takes on a new identity as a car mechanic. All goes well for a time until St. John discovers that the gun used in the killing of the older Mancini has also been used in a serial murder, and he decides to track Munch down. Munch, meanwhile, has made a fresh start, getting off drugs and alcohol, as well as getting rid of her biker friends, but when she returns to her old neighborhood to retrieve the hidden weapon, she and Mace come face to face. A critic for Publishers Weekly praised the \"grit and authentic street life\" of this first novel, while a contributor for Kirkus Reviews similarly noted that \"Munch's scenes pulse with such startling immediacy … that first-time Seranella makes you forget how familiar her story is.\" Catherine M. Nelson, writing in the Armchair Detective, found that the \"tense moments for both Munch and Mace keep the pages turning.\"\n\nSeranella puts her heroine on the path of reform in No Offense Intended, but Munch gets drawn back into the old life when Sleaze John shows up and asks for a favor: just pick up and deliver his young daughter, Asia, to his sister. Later, seeing John shot on the freeway, she stops, and a world of pain ensues, involving drugs, burglary, and murder. In the process, Munch gets thrown into jail for parole violation and ultimately joins forces with another detective, Jig Blackston, to get to the bottom of things and save Sleaze John's child, Asia. A critic for Kirkus Reviews felt that this second installment \"lacks the energy and originality\" of the first, but still found Munch to be a \"great heroine.\" A reviewer for Publishers Weekly was more positive, praising Seranella's \"gift for snappy dialogue and descriptions,\" and further observing that \"this is a mystery series with legs.\"\n\nThe third book in the series, Unwanted Company, finds Munch adding to her mechanic's wages by starting a limo service, and her car is hired to chauffeur a Romanian diplomat around Los Angeles during the 1984 Olympics. A serial killer on the loose murders the two women traveling with the Romanian, and then Ellen, a friend from Munch's past, adds to the troubles: driving for Munch, she witnesses the Romanian involved in another murder. A contributor for Publishers Weekly thought that, in spite of some obvious plot contrivances and a telegraphed ending, \"the novel's dizzying pace\" and Seranella's \"incisive portraits of flawed, vulnerable characters\" result in a \"satisfying novel.\" Marilyn Stasio, writing in the New York Times Book Review, commented on the \"creepy and scary\" nature of the novel, twin emotive threads that the author \"handles with the same kind of no-sweat skill that Munch applies to her automotive repairs.\"\n\nMace St. John makes a return in Unfinished Business, in which Munch—now repairing cars for the rich—and the detective team up when some of her customers appear to be the victims of a rapist. Soon Munch herself, as well as her adopted daughter Asia, are threatened by the rapist. When Mace is taken out of action by a heart attack, Munch has to stop the villain by herself. A reviewer for Publishers Weekly noted that the \"reader feels little trepidation\" in this mystery; however, the same contributor commented that \"Munch is a likable protagonist.\" Similarly, Dick Lochte of the Los Angeles Times, felt that the author's own career as an auto mechanic \"adds a welcome air of verisimilitude to the novels\" and that Seranella \"is at her best when presenting the less melodramatic moments in her heroine's life.\"\n\nThe past once again intrudes on Munch in No Man Standing, when the parents of her friend Ellen are killed and Ellen thinks some hidden stolen money may be the cause of the crime. Munch takes time from raising her daughter and buying a house to help Ellen out in this tale that might make readers return to earlier installments in the series \"to catch up on what they've missed,\" according to Booklist's Carrie Bissey. Rex E. Klett, writing in Library Journal, suggested this title for those \"who like their mysteries a bit grittier,\" and a contributor for Kirkus Reviews thought this was Seranella's \"best yet: fast-paced and brainy but with plenty of heart.\"\n\nWith 2003's Unpaid Dues, Munch is once again reminded of her infamous past when Jane Ferrar is found murdered. Munch's mug shot shows up when the dead woman's prints are run by Detective Mace St. John; she took Ferrar's identity to avoid a drunk-driving charge once upon a time. What she does not tell the police, however, is that she and the dead woman had an even stronger link, and Munch suspects it was that which led to Ferrar's death. Ultimately, Munch must risk her well-ordered life to get to the bottom of things before she becomes another victim. Booklist's Bissey felt that this sixth title \"provides some valuable backstory,\" and a critic for Kirkus Reviews compared the novel to a \"well-tuned machine\" that \"glides perfectly right up to its elegant finish.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nArmchair Detective, summer, 1997, Catherine M.
