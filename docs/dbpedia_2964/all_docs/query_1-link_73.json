        "text": "Discussions of eroticism usually commence with references to Georges Bataille and his L’Erotisme, whose first English edition was published under the title Death and Sensuality: A Study of Eroticism and the Taboo (1962), thus encouraging analyses in terms of transgression. This article opens with a quotation from Zygmunt Bauman’s essay, “On Postmodern Uses of Sex,” which reflects on the instability of the concept and emphasizes its contextualization. This openly declared incongruity raises questions of applicability. What is meant by eroticism today, i.e. in and after postmodernism? The article seeks to explore the relevance of the term in studies of urban drama and tries to suggest a workable approach that would differentiate between the commonly observable erotic material found on display within the premises of the city and the eroticism of the city itself. In the latter case the erotic relationship involves the materiality of the urban context and its user. The essay, focusing on drama, assumes that plays are written for the stage—their proper mode of existence—and deems it necessary to include the city/theatre and city/drama interdependence as well as the nexus of concepts such as urban drama and its genre restrictions into the following analysis.\n\nLAWRENCE WEBB's review of Film & Domestic Space Film and Domestic Space arrived on my desk during the first wave of Covid-19 lockdowns, at a moment when attention had naturally turned inwards to the domestic interior. The book has therefore gained an unexpected sense of topicality. As the new constraints of physically distanced living have transformed houses and apartments into digitally networked hubs for home working and online social interaction, public and private space have blurred in unforeseen ways. More than ever, the home has become visible via media technologies. Through video calls and the ubiquitous array of the Zoom screen-now a staple of family hangouts, classrooms, and business meetings alike-images of other people's homes have rarely been so present in our everyday lives. On television, broadcasting from home has offered glimpses into the domestic interiors of politicians, celebrities, presenters, and pundits-with the staging and semiotics of bookshelves even briefly becoming a topic of online debate (Guest). In short, the pandemic has not only produced a wide range of domestic imagery. It has also revealed domestic space as a site of media production as well as media consumption, bringing into focus how the home can operate as a type of moving image apparatus-or as Baschiera and De Rosa put it, as a dispositif. As their timely book shows, this exchange between screen media and domestic space has a varied and complex history. The editors note in their useful introduction that domestic space is not a new subject for film studies. We might think, for example, of pathbreaking work by Elizabeth Bronfen on the home and nostalgia in Hollywood cinema, Pamela Wojcik on the \"apartment plots\" of mid-century New York, Merrill Schleier on the gendered tensions of high-rise living, or John David Rhodes on the ambivalent spectacle of the cinematic house. Domestic mise en scène is also important to scholarship on classical Hollywood melodrama, horror cinema, and the British heritage film, for example (Gledhill; Curtis; Higson; Vidal), and a competing edited volume, Spaces of the Cinematic Home: Behind the Screen Door (2015), stakes out similar territory to this book. Nevertheless, Baschiera and De Rosa's collection does bring something new to the table. It builds and expands on the literature-with an impressive roster of authors, including key scholars such as Schleier, Rhodes, and Laura Rascaroli contributing new material-and offers a rich set of case studies, many of which suggest new directions and possibilities. Though it is still broadly Euro-American, the collection pushes beyond the paradigm of mid-twentieth century Hollywood-which has provided such powerful images of domestic space for scholars such as Rhodes, Schleier, and Wojcik-to consider a broad range of historical and geographical\n\nThis article analyzes how documentaries and docudramas about the homicides of 1,500-plus women in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico offer competing narratives about the respectability of victims, yet reinforce the “virgin-whore” dichotomy and their corresponding spatial formations. For instance, activist mothers of disappeared women in Juárez have publicly denounced the official government’s theory that each disappeared woman led a secret “double life” that made them vulnerable to a dangerous lifestyle: virgin by day and whore by night. Activists seeking redress for their daughters emphasize so-called virgin values. However, in popular media, the state’s explanation of the double life as the cause of these murders has been recreated for film audiences in local docudramas distributed on the streets of Juárez. I argue that both genres of cinematic representations rebuild a case against the victims rather than the perpetrators. I demonstrate that, in casting blame upon victims, the spatial politics embedded inside the logics of the double life reinforce binaries about public and private spheres. Spatial discourse about public space as posing considerable risk and harassment threats for women has been interpellated in a complex and important way in struggles to prevent further sex crimes. This analysis interrogates the limitations of the rebuttals made against mainstream discourses by activist mothers as they reinscribe the virgin-whore binary."
