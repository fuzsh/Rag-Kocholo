As usual, the lagoon city will host the 73rd Venice International Film Festival which, this year, will be held from August 31st to September 10th. At the same time, in the Venice Lido like always, the 31st edition of the International Film Criticsâ€™ Week will take place.

The choice of the candidates has been based on the research of new and innovative elements for cinematography. Nine, among more than five hundred films, have been selected to run for the final award. Three different prizes will be assigned to the most deserving movies at the end of the week. Among these, the Mario Serandrei Award-Hotel Saturnia will be dedicated to the best technical contribute for cinematography. This demonstrates how the Serandrei family, which has been managing for four generations the Hotel Saturnia & International since 1908, is tightly linked to the world of culture and in particular to the cinema one. In fact, Mario Serandrei, skilled master of film editing, was one of the major Italian cinema exponents starting from the Neorealistic period. Moreover, he had the chance to actively collaborate with different directors of the Italian cinema context, among which Luchino Visconti, Giuseppe De Santis, Alessandro Blasetti, Federico Fellini e Carlo Lizzani.

In his memory, after fifty years from his passing, the Serandrei family has decided to create the prize dedicated to him in this 31st edition of the International Film Critics' Week.
