        "text": "American actor (born 1947)\n\nNot to be confused with Tim Mathieson.\n\nTim Matheson (born Timothy Lewis Matthieson; December 31, 1947) is an American actor.[1] Some of his best-known acting roles include the title character of the 1960s animated Jonny Quest TV series, Eric \"Otter\" Stratton in the 1978 comedy film National Lampoon's Animal House, and the recurring role of Vice President John Hoynes in the 2000s NBC drama The West Wing, which earned him two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nMatheson was born in Glendale, California, the son of Clifford Matthieson, a training pilot, and Sally Matthieson.[2] Matheson served a tour of duty in the United States Marine Corps Reserve.[3]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nAt age 13, Matheson appeared as Roddy Miller in Robert Young's CBS nostalgia comedy series Window on Main Street during the 1961–1962 television season. In the 1962–1963 season he appeared in two episodes of Leave It to Beaver, cast as Mike Harmon, a friend of Beaver’s.[4][5] In 1964, he provided the voice of the lead character in the animated series Jonny Quest. He also supplied the voices of Sinbad Jr. the Sailor in the 1960s Hanna-Barbera animated series Sinbad Jr. and his Magic Belt [6] and Jace in Space Ghost. He co-starred as Joe Hardy, opposite Richard Gates as Frank Hardy, in a 1967 pilot episode for what would have been a TV series called The Hardy Boys, based on the novel series of the same name, but the series was not picked up.[7]\n\nHe played the role of the oldest son, Mike Beardsley, in the film Yours, Mine and Ours (1968), which starred Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda.\n\nIn 1969, Matheson joined the cast of NBC's television Western The Virginian in the eighth season as Jim Horn. He had a guest role in the 14th episode of the second season of Night Gallery, in the story \"Logoda's Heads\". In the final season of the television Western Bonanza in 1972–1973, Matheson played Griff King, a parolee who tries to reform his life as a worker at the Ponderosa Ranch under Ben Cartwright's tutelage. He portrayed a corrupt motorcycle cop, Phil Sweet, who was part of a death squad with some other young cops in the film Magnum Force (1973). Matheson also appeared earlier in the CBS situation comedy My Three Sons. In 1975, he guest starred in CBS's short-lived family drama Three for the Road.\n\nIn 1976, Matheson appeared with Kurt Russell in the 15-episode NBC series The Quest. In 1978, he was part of the ensemble cast of National Lampoon's Animal House. The following year, he appeared with John Belushi again in Steven Spielberg's 1941. In 1980 he auditioned for the role of Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark, for which Harrison Ford won the part.\n\nMatheson appeared in the film To Be or Not to Be (1983) starring Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft. He and Catherine Hicks played Rick and Amanda Tucker, who operate a detective agency in Laurel Canyon in CBS' Tucker's Witch, which aired during the 1982–1983 season. Then Matheson starred in the comedy films Up the Creek (1984) and Fletch (1985). In 1989, he starred in the short-lived sitcom \"Just in Time\" produced by Warner Bros.[8]\n\nAlong with business partner Daniel Grodnik, he bought National Lampoon in 1989,[9][10][11] selling it in 1991.[12][13]\n\nHe had a recurring role as Vice President John Hoynes on The West Wing. His work on The West Wing earned him two Primetime Emmy award nominations.[14][15]\n\nHe has directed episodes of Third Watch, Ed, The Twilight Zone, Cold Case, Without a Trace, The West Wing, Psych, The Good Guys, Shark, White Collar, Criminal Minds, Suits and Burn Notice (on which he also performed in a recurring role).\n\nIn 1996, Matheson took on the role of a con man who claims to be Carol Brady's thought-to-be-dead husband in A Very Brady Sequel. He appeared in the film Van Wilder (2002), playing the father of the title character, who was inspired by his own character in Animal House; Matheson's character even makes a veiled reference to the fun times he had had at Dartmouth, where the fraternity upon which Animal House is rumored to have \"had a strong tradition of existence\". He appeared in the auto-racing film Redline. He also appeared in a Volkswagen commercial in 2008.\n\nIn 2009, Matheson directed the pilot episode of Covert Affairs, premiered on USA Network in 2010. Matheson also directed the pilot episodes of The Good Guys (2010) for the Fox Network, Criminal Behavior (2011) for Lifetime, and Wild Card (2011) for USA Network. He played Dr. Brick Breeland on Hart of Dixie from 2011 to 2015. Since 2019, Matheson has starred as Doc Mullins in the Netflix series Virgin River.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nMatheson has been married three times. He was first married to actress Jennifer Leak from 1968 to 1971, whom he met on the set of Yours, Mine, and Ours. In 1985 he married Megan Murphy, with whom he had three children; they divorced in 2010.[16] He married Elizabeth Marighetto in March 2018; the two live together in Hollywood, California.[citation needed]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1967 Divorce American Style Mark Harmon Joe Hardy 1968 Yours, Mine and Ours Mike Beardsley 1969 How to Commit Marriage David Poe 1973 Magnum Force Officer Phil Sweet 1978 National Lampoon's Animal House Eric \"Otter\" Stratton Almost Summer Kevin Hawkins 1979 Dreamer Dreamer Private Jeff Reed aka Captain Phillips 1941 Captain Loomis Birkhead 1982 Michael Donovan 1983 To Be or Not to Be Lieutenant Andre Sobinski 1984 The House of God Roy Basch Up the Creek Bob McGraw Impulse Stuart 1985 Fletch Alan Stanwyck 1989 Speed Zone Jack O'Neill 1990 Solar Crisis Steve Kelso 1991 Drop Dead Fred Charles 1995 Midnight Heat Tyler Grey 1996 Black Sheep Al Donnelly Roy Martin / Trevor Thomas 1998 A Very Unlucky Leprechaun Howard Wilson 1999 She's All That Harlan Siler Marty 2000 Chump Change Simon \"Sez\" Simone 2002 Van Wilder Vance Wilder Sr. 2003 Where Are They Now?: A Delta Alumni Update Dr. Eric \"Otter\" Stratton, OB / GYN Video short 2005 Don't Come Knocking Producer 1 Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the Moon 3D Houston Capcom Voice 2007 Redline Jerry Brecken 2009 Behind Enemy Lines: Colombia Carl Dobbs Video American Pie Presents: The Book of Love Alumnus Guy No. 4 Video 2011 No Strings Attached Eli's Dad #2 2015 Tom and Jerry: Spy Quest The President Voice, direct-to-video[17] 2017 Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle Old Man Vreeke Uncredited 2018 6 Balloons Gary 2019 Child's Play Henry Kaslan\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1961–1962 Window on Main Street Roddy Miller First acting role The Alvin Show Additional voices 1 episode 1962–1963 Leave It to Beaver Michael \"Mike\" Harmon 2 episodes 1962 My Three Sons Alan Edgerton Episode: \"Tramp's First Bite\" (uncredited) 1963 Ripcord David Episode: \"The Final Jump\" 1964–1965 Jonny Quest Jonny Quest Voice 1965 Sinbad Jr. and his Magic Belt Sinbad Jr. Voice O.K.
