        "text": "Can #GenAI solve all fashion problems? 🤔 Judging by all the hype at Viva Technology which welcomed an impressive 160K visitors, so much optimism would convert any skeptics in the room. Once again, LVMH dazzled us with its \"Dream Garden\" pavilion immersing thirteen of its iconic Maisons as well as promising startups from the #LVMHInnovationAward, illustrating how innovation is set to reinvent every facet of the luxury sector. Among the stars at the event were several notable startups and innovations: 🔮 Raive: A multimedia GenAI company with built-in IP royalty attribution, revolutionizing how we manage and monetize creative content. 🔮 xydrobe: Delivering multisensory VR experiences, redefining customer engagement in retail and events. 🔮 FancyTech: Specializing in GenAI video production, seamlessly blending 3D models and creative briefs to craft captivating visual content. But the question remains, can #GenAI truly address all fashion problems? At LVMH, the application of AI is broad and multifaceted, aiming to: 1️⃣ Enhance Customer Experience: From AI-powered digital try-ons by Loro Piana to immersive retail innovations by SEPHORA, AI is transforming how customers interact with brands. 2️⃣ Boost Brand Desirability: With AI-driven personalized experiences by Louis Vuitton and augmented reality enhancements by TAG Heuer, brands are becoming more appealing and engaging than ever. 3️⃣ Promote Exemplary Leadership: Ensuring sustainable growth and ethical AI usage, as demonstrated by Christian Dior Couture and Tiffany & Co., AI is paving the way for a more responsible fashion industry. As these #innovation unfold, it's clear that #GenAI holds immense potential to revolutionize fashion, but it also raises questions about the future of creativity, sustainability, consumer trust, and further social disparity. ❓ What are your views on #GenAI impacting the #FutureOfFashion❓ #FashionTech #LuxuryInnovation #SustainableFashion 📸 Sarah Aubel\n\nWhat world do we live in?? Shein might be dodging barriers to hit the US public markets, but they've cozied up with the London Stock Exchange instead. Why the cold shoulder from the US? Well, thanks for outlying it @Ken Pucker, from using banned Xinjiang cotton to having workers pull insane 75-hour shifts, there’s a lot going on behind Shein's glossy exterior. Shipping globally 5,000 new items daily emboldens their savvy use of loopholes to dodge hefty import duties and oil-based polyester that ends up in landfills, while their PR claims being a “sustainable and accessible brand.” This isn't just about Shein—it's about all of us. Is it profit > planet? How much are we willing to put up with unchecked corporate behavior...\n\nWith the first Monday of May, NYC's fashion scene was buzzing with the #MetGala, and you may wonder why that matters 🤔 (apart from the $26M raised in one night). The Met Gala's ripple effect on fashion retail is undeniable. 📸 The media's immediate and extensive coverage of the event means that the most acclaimed looks become instant inspirations for designers and brands worldwide. ⚡️From #luxury to high street, within weeks, you can spot 'inspired-look' collections hitting the shelves, demonstrating the rapid response of the fashion industry to these iconic styles. After all, that's what we did back when I was a designer at BCBGMAXAZRIAGROUP. For small and medium brands, staying ahead in this fast-paced environment is crucial. Competing with major players requires an agile supply chain and a keen eye on trends that emerge from such high-profile events. This is where Zipps.io steps in—providing the tools needed to swiftly adapt and deliver new trends to consumers sustainably. 🔍 In eyeing the looks from this year's Met Gala, \"The Garden of Time,\" here are my top 8 that I foresee will influence collections soon: 1. Jennifer Lopez in Schiaparelli 2. Vittoria Ceretti in Alaïa 3. Dan Levy in Loewe 4. Elle Fanning in Balmain and Cartier 5. Sabrina Carpenter in Oscar de la Renta 6. Brie Larson in Prada and Fred Leighton 7. Bruna Marquezine in Tory Burch and Tiffany & Co. 8. Gigi Hadid in Thom Browne and Chopard ♻️ As these trends make their way from the 'green' carpet to your wardrobe, remember the cycle of fashion is swift, but choosing lasting and sustainable trends is key. Zipps.io empowers brands to stay competitive and relevant in this fast-paced world of fashion by making the supply chain more agile and traceable.

For decades, the fashion supply chain has been tangled up in complexity. 💥Despite tech progress, we’re still seeing the same old challenges. 🧐 After chatting with over 100 industry pros and deep-diving into #discussions with more than 50 fashion brands/experts, a few major pain points keep cropping up: 1️⃣ #Disconnected Incentives: Everyone in the supply chain seems to be playing a different game, leading to inefficiency and plenty of frustration. 2️⃣ #Complex Stakeholder Chain: From designers, product developers, raw material suppliers, merchandisers, patternmakers, graders, cutters, sewers, quality control personnel, packers, shippers, customs officials, warehouse staff, distributors, and retailers. Each link in the chain can add weeks to production timelines for just about anything—human errors, holidays, you name it. This makes the whole process painfully slow and rigid. 3️⃣ #ToolOverload Without Integration: There’s no shortage of tools aiming to improve product dev to inventory forecasting, but what’s missing is a simple, end-to-end solution that everyone can actually use. You might be wondering why #FastFashion and #Luxury seem to be doing just fine. It’s all about having a supply chain that’s vertically integrated and tightly tuned to snap up market opportunities. ⚙️ #Stories like planning a collection over six to nine months ahead, then having trends shift last minute—\"suddenly everyone wanted shorter crossbody bags, and we have to scratch the previous order to adapt fast.\" This shows just how crucial agility is in our industry. 📍That’s why we’re working on Zipps.io. 🔍 We’re zeroing in on the needs of Small & Medium-sized contemporary brands that need #agility and #speed in their operations, leading to significant #reductions in waste. 🚀 By smoothing out the process, Zipps.io helps these brands stay nimble and #sustainable in today’s fast-paced fashion scene. Here’s how Zipps.io helps: ✅ #CentralizedDataManagement: All your design files, tech packs, and records are stored in one spot, making everything easy to access and use. ✅ #EnhancedCommunication: We bridge the gap between you and your factories/suppliers, cutting through language and regional barriers effortlessly. ✅ #RealTimeData: Get the latest updates on inventory and production instantly, so you can make swift and smart decisions. ✅ #Visibility & #Traceability: Track your production process every step of the way for a clear, measurable impact and to stay on top of compliance. We're fast developing at Antler and being in NYC helped us talk to and include a whole new set of customers' pain points that validate our previously focused Paris brands' problems. Thanks Antler team!! Jeff Becker Roslyn Jin Cody Sugarman Annie Ripp Kaila J. Lim\n\nVery insightful perspective from Marian Temmen!! Now, SHEIN's Supply Chain as a Service (SCAAS) initiative, while innovative, raises several #concerns about the broader impact on the fashion industry. By centralizing manufacturing and distribution, Shein could potentially #stifle competition and concentrate market power, undermining the diversity and sustainability that are critical for a healthier industry. As he mentioned, this model, akin to YouTube's dominance in video content, risks creating an environment where smaller players are dependent on a single, powerful platform, potentially leading to a #monopolistic scenario. In contrast, we are developing Zipps.io, a streamlined supply chain management #SaaS that #empowers small and medium business brands to independently connect with suppliers and factories. Our platform helps these brands maintain their competitiveness by digitizing their supply chains, producing smaller batches, ensuring they remain #agile and responsive to market changes without relying on a dominant entity like Shein. Together with Bernard Yong & Stephane Courtioux, we are committed to fostering a more #equitable and #sustainable fashion industry where SME brands can thrive on their own terms. #Sustainability #Fashiontech #Supplychain\n\n🗑️ The fashion industry trashes around 92 million tons of #TextileWaste annually, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation 🌍 But where does all this waste come from? Here are the main culprits along with potential solutions: 1️⃣ #Overproduction 🔥 FAST FASHION: Rapid trend turnover and low-cost production typically lead to overproduction, with more items produced than the market needs. With SHEIN reportedly producing 5000 pieces each day!! 🟢 Solution: Adopting a circular fashion model, focusing on product longevity, reuse, and recycling, can help mitigate overproduction and waste. 📊 POOR DEMAND FORECASTING: With long lead times, brands may produce more than necessary to avoid stockouts, resulting in surplus inventory. 🟢 Solution: With 72% of retailers planning to incorporate better forecasting and real-time visibility technologies, there's an opportunity to reduce the need to overproduce. 📦 MASS PRODUCTION: With globalization trends, aimed at economies of scale, brands produce large quantities to reduce unit costs, often relying on promotions and discounts to clear excess inventory. 🟢 Solution: Localizing production and better merchandising mix can lead to a significant 10% reduction in inventory costs, reducing reliance on promotions and discounts. 2️⃣ #Waste 🛍️ POST-CONSUMER WASTE: Fast fashion encourages a disposable mindset among consumers, leading to high clothing turnover and significant landfill or incinerator waste. 🟢 Solution: Educating consumers about the environmental impact of their fashion choices and promoting sustainable consumption habits such as maximizing cloth-wear with styling tips can help reduce post-consumer waste and increase consumer engagement. ✂️ PRE-CONSUMER WASTE: The production process generates considerable waste, including fabric offcuts, defective items, and unsold inventory, often ending up in landfills or incinerated. 🟢 Solution: Using 3D modeling and more precise product development technologies can help reduce pre-consumer waste and increase efficiencies. 💦 TEXTILE WASTE: The fashion industry's heavy use of textiles, like cotton, requires significant water and pesticides, contributing to environmental degradation. 🟢 Solution: Developing new sustainable fabrics and recycling existing fibers can help reduce reliance on controversial textiles. How can #technology help? Digitizing a brand's supply chain with an end-to-end solution like Zipps.io can lead to more sustainable practices and a healthier planet. 🌿 By simplifying the process, we can find frictions, improve efficiency, have a more agile supply chain, and even revolutionize it with an on-demand model! No more overproduction 😇 produce only what you sell! #Thoughts? Leave me a comment on how much this makes sense to you!\n\n👚 Shirts at $7.90: Bargain or Outrage? While it might seem like a bargain, there's a lot more to the story. According to the Financial Times, SHEIN's revenues hit a whopping $45 billion in 2023. That's 30X growth in six years. 🤯But what is the real cost of fast fashion? 🌍 Every day, SHEIN adds over 5,000 new styles, producing over 5 billion garments a year, air-shipping out of China globally. And 2/3 of these are made from polyester!! We're talking #microplastic pollution and methane emissions from landfills. Not exactly the legacy we want to leave behind, right? 🚫 On top of that, there are some serious concerns about how SHEIN operates. Issues like forced labor, poor working conditions, and avoiding tariffs, are raising red flags. Shein’s IPO filing last November has yet to be approved by the SEC, and as such, they are eyeing a change of venue. According to Bloomberg, they are taking initial steps to file on the London Stock Exchange instead. 🔄 As Ken Pucker said so well: \"To change behavior, change the rules.\" It's time to advocate for transparency, sustainability, and ethical practices in fashion. We must support brands that prioritize the health of our planet and its inhabitants. This is why with Zipps.io, we are aiming to empower SME brands to be competitive with their supply chain. By providing real-time connectivity between brands, suppliers, and manufacturers, Zipps.io helps SME fashion brands manage their supply chain more efficiently, sustainably, and ethically. #SustainableFashion #EthicalFashion #FastFashion #SHEIN #EnvironmentalImpact #Zippsio #SupplyChainInnovation https://lnkd.in/gdEfe9aG\n\nWhat is the #futureoffashion? 🤔 With only 63% inventory accuracy and 34% of businesses facing product unavailability, it's clear that the industry needs a revamp. 💡 Reflecting on my journey as the Founder of Opus Mind, I remember the incredible demand for our recycled Italian-made leather goods. Our commitment to #sustainability resonated with consumers, but #supplychain disruptions amplified by the pandemic, presented unexpected challenges. This experience fueled my passion for #simplifying the fashion supply chain with ZIPPS.io, ensuring that sustainable brands can thrive without being hindered by logistical obstacles. 📈 💪 #ASK: If you know of a brand owner, production/operation manager, or anyone in the fashion business, I would love to be #connected!! 🤖 As the industry embraces digital transformation, 72% of retailers are gearing up for real-time #visibility in their supply chains. 🚀 Will tech be the new black? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: innovation is always in style. 😉 #FashionTech #InventoryManagement #RetailRevolution 📸 photo credit: Karina Tess on Unsplash"
