After a brief interlude she became aware of the presence of another young man of her high school class, albeit in a different circle, who was not only a neighbor but a close friend of her younger brother.

Her Irish dominated her personality, whether it is in charm, wit, temper or in spoken word it was always plain who she was and what she felt and thought. Anne never failed to make an impression with her presence, word and appearance. Upon her husbands retirement in 1983 she actively cherished the many remaining years with her mate, home, children and grandchildren.\n\nPredeceased by her beloved husband Claud in June of this year, she is survived by her son Tracy (Cindy) of Plymouth, Michigan, daughter Claudia Graving (Michael) of East Lansing, grandsons Ted and Alex Basing, sister Margaret Ralph of Hatfield, PA, brother Harry A.
