Dubbed a “municipal treasure,” Kathryn at 87 is a servant leader of the generational kind. Her father received this award in 1982 and her mother left her with a legacy of service to carry on at the Gwinnett Medical Center, where she volunteered for 22 years. “We were just raised up this way. Four generations of my family have been actively involved with the hospital system,” says Kathryn, whose service to the Gwinnett community is legendary. While she has devoted her time to many organizations, the Gwinnett Medical Center, Duluth First United Methodist Church (where she raised funds for the church’s 38 stained glass windows), and the Duluth Fall Festival that she founded with the insistence that every festival dollar raised would benefit Downtown Duluth. Even the Georgia State Senate honored her with a resolution for her dedication to public service to the State of Georgia and to the City of Duluth and called her life “a salute to service.” In 2013 Wesleyan honored Kathryn with the alumnae award for Distinguished Service to the Community.\n\n1954 (65th Reunion)\n\nReunion Chair: Ruth White Fruit ’54\n\n(L-R) Row 1: Marilyn Bennett Edwards, Ruth White Fruit, Blaine Ross ShanksRow 2: Joyce Hall Pelphrey, Joyce Paris, Natalie Brewton Barfield, Ann Parsons Odum, Athelyn Wade Buttrill, Natholyn Miller Freeman\n\nFrom Deridder, LA, Marcia Mallet Ades ’54 writes, “We are doing as well as we can as LeRoy has a constant battle with Parkinson’s disease.

Although she was 10 days into her 85th year when she died, she never got old in my eyes.” Libby volunteered at the First United Methodist Church. She was a member of several organizations including her Garden Club and the Florida Museum of Natural History where she was a docent for 56 years and a board member for 53 years. She accompanied her husband on 50 volunteer surgery trips around the world, working in the operating rooms, clinics, and with families of surgery patients.

According to Jane and Carolyn (pictured in blue) “We’re having a great time and a great life!”\n\nFrom her home in Gainesville, FL, Arline Atkins Finch ’56 sends a note, “Ann Munck ’38 was a very challenging English teacher who was a lifelong influence on my life. How grateful I am to her and to Wesleyan.”\n\nAccording to Georgia Walton Bradford ’57 her life has slowed enough that she finds time to reminisce...about Dr. Zorin and Dr. Fay. “Being in both the Chorus and the Glee Club were highlights of my Wesleyan days - only three years of them as I married my Air Force husband after my junior year. Adding three children to a family that moved all around the world was challenging. But, I finally graduated (at Wesleyan in 1969), fulfilling my mother’s dream that I’d be a Wesleyan graduate.” Georgia earned a master’s degree in educational administration (Univ. of TX- San Antonio) and a doctorate in 1989. Elected to the Kansas House of Representatives, she become a political force on behalf of students, and was instrumental in getting a doctoral program installed at Wichita State University as well as eliminating out-of-county tuition rates for county colleges throughout the state. Other life experiences included meeting Soong Mei-Ling, attending the funeral of Chiang Kai-Shek, and leading a conference of Education Services Officers (ESO) as the only woman ESO in Europe at the time. Georgia says, “My years at Wesleyan, though interrupted, were foundational as well as inspirational. After a divorce I married Robert W. Bradford.

She is still having gallery showings.”\n\n“Wesleyan enriches life,” says Joan Maddox Sammons ’57 who joined Emory’s Michael C. Carlos Museum as a member of the docent class in 1985. Joan taught a number of sessions on ancient art at Evenings at Emory and later was asked to do the research for the museum catalog. When that was finished she was asked to help with the conservation of the Niagara Falls collection of Egyptian artifacts that the museum had just purchased. Joan has remained a volunteer in the conservation lab since 1998. “I have had the extraordinary experience of working on objects from ancient civilizations, a thrilling experience which even included working in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo when Emory conserved and reinstalled their Predynastic pottery collection. These objects had been stored away for over half a century, unseen, and unstudied. We brought them to light again. Just trying to make Gulnar Bosch proud! I was so thrilled to have been invited to her 80 birthday celebration in Tallahassee, FL, on November 4, 1989. She inspired my life and enriched it in many ways so that I, too, continue to work and enrich the lives of others. So Wesleyan has focused my life, even though I was “just a wife and mother of 4” and didn’t have a career,” writes Joan. (See Joan above - pictured far right - at Emory’s 100th Veneralia gala where she served on the Patron Committee)\n\n“I now live in a retirement home, The Nottingham, near Syracuse, NY,” reports Julia Stillwell Ketcham ’58.
