        "text": "Thomas Kingston passed away in February 2024. \"It is with the deepest sorrow that we announce the death of Thomas Kingston, our beloved husband, son and brother. Tom was an exceptional man who lit up the lives of all who knew him. His death has come as a great shock to the whole family and we ask you to respect our privacy as we mourn his passing,\" reads a statement shared on behalf of Lady Gabriella Kingston, Mr Martin and Mrs Jill Kingston, Mrs Joanna Connolly and Mrs Emma Murray, breaking the news of his death.\n\nA Buckingham Palace spokesperson also shared a statement: \"The King and The Queen have been informed of Thomas’s death and join Prince and Princess Michael of Kent and all those who knew him in grieving a much-loved member of the family. In particular, Their Majesties send their most heartfelt thoughts and prayers to Gabriella and to all the Kingston family.\"\n\nBelow, a brief explainer about Kingston, published in 2019, shortly after he wed Lady Gabriella Windsor.\n\nLast year was a big one for royal wedding watchers, from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's nuptials last May to Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's ceremony in October. But the wedding bells weren't done ringing just yet: this May, Lady Gabriella Windsor, the Queen's first cousin once removed, married financier Thomas Kingston.\n\nThough he's not a member of the peerage, Kingston's name may sound familiar to those who keep a close eye on the royal scene. So who is the man who just married into the U.K.'s most famous family?\n\nTom Kingston and Lady Gabriella Windsor attend the Royal Ascot at Ascot Racecourse in June 2017.\n\nHe has appeared in public with the royal family.\n\nIn June, Kingston made his first-ever appearance at Trooping the Colour, an annual parade held in honor of Queen Elizabeth's birthday. Every year, the event concludes with the royal family waving from the Buckingham Palace balcony—and this time, less than a month after marrying Lady Gabriella Windsor, Kingston joined them.\n\nLady Gabriella Windsor (second from left) stands with her new husband, Thomas Kingston (third from left) at Trooping the Colour.\n\nHe started his career in diplomatic relations.\n\nAfter graduating from Bristol University with a bachelor's degree in economic history, Kingston went to work in the Diplomatic Missions Unit of the United Kingdom's Foreign Office, according to the Telegraph. For almost three years he worked in Baghdad as a project officer for the Iraqi Institute of Peace to mediate conflicts in Iraq and even helped negotiate the release of hostages.\n\nKingston then transitioned to finance, working as an equity analyst for Schroders, a global asset management firm, and then as managing director of Voltan Capital Management until April 2017. Per the Palace, he now \"works in frontier market investment and is a Director of Devonport Capital.\"\n\nLady Gabriella Windsor and Thomas Kingston attend the wedding of Pippa Middleton and James Matthews in may 2017.\n\nHe once dated Pippa Middleton.\n\nThough it's not clear where Kingston and Lady Gabriella (known to those close to her as Ella) met, Kingston is clearly comfortable in royal circles. In the past he's been linked to Natalie Hicks-Lobbecke, one of Prince William's ex-girlfriends, and for a period in 2011, he and Pippa Middleton were reportedly an item.\n\nPippa Middleton and Tom Kingston at the Cheltenham Festival in March 2013."
