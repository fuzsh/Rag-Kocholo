        "text": "by Grant Jones\n\nI was recently craving some 6th Generation goodness (said nobody ever). There have been many lunch breaks spent perusing PlayStation 2s, gawping at GameCubes and examining Xboxs, yet as I looked through lists of Greatest Games of this era, so many have been remastered or ported to a current system. This year has a Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake on the horizon, and we recently had a lazy port of Fahrenheit. It made me think; just how many of these supposed greats of yesteryear actually require a twenty-year-old piece of hardware to run? Is it even worth buying one of these systems in 2021, considering you have to deal with wired controllers, memory cards and a SCART lead that goes in OH MY GOD MY TV DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ONE!?\n\nThis episode of I need to stop writing about games and just play them is brought to you by Metacritic. We’ll take a look at all the games that scored 85% or higher and thus, received the coveted N64 Magazine Star Award. Probably. I've excluded sports titles, considering half of Metacritic is a shrine to the NFL; at least in the early 2000s it was. I caught up with former PS64 Magazine Editor Jim Cleaver to discuss if the PS2 is indeed worth purchasing...\n\nExclusive: TONY HAWK’S PRO SKATER 3 / TONY HAWK’S PRO SKATER 4\n\nThese two skater classics remain exclusive to this generation, but considering the first two games have been rebuilt recently, there's a good chance 3 and 4 could arrive in the future.\n\nJim Cleaver: But will they have the song from Jackass me and my mates would play whilst Rock Bottom-ing each other on mattresses?\n\nIf they do turn up, you probably won't get the full experience because of music licensing issues. They did capture the original two games’ style and sound expertly however, so have faith!\n\nAvailable elsewhere: GRAND THEFT AUTO III / GRAND THEFT AUTO: VICE CITY / GRAND THEFT AUTO: SAN ANDREAS\n\nThis trilogy of terror can be downloaded on PS4, a new Xbox and also the Xbox 360 (Sony has since shut the PS3 store). San Andreas also received a curious physical release in 2015, so it can be played on 360/PS3 in disc-form too.\n\n[JC]: Is there any benefit to having the PS2 originals? Music licensing?\n\nOther than to have the case on your shelf, there's very little point, as these versions all run well on current hardware. Rockstar has caves full of cash and so music remains intact which is remarkable really. Less remarkable is the fact the re-releases are just ROM dumps. You get the full loading times between islands still. Although there are now achievements, which is nice.\n\nAvailable elsewhere: RESIDENT EVIL 4\n\nCapcom's masterpiece can be played on any device the right side of a toaster. It's available on all current formats (and probably phones too) and will see a proper remaster next year. We think.\n\n[JC] But I like the pointy controls on the Wii. Do any HD versions have that?\n\nUnfortunately not, but we’re talking about the PS2 here, Jim. Resi 4 is still a blast on a controller and you get all the bonus PS2 content in subsequent offerings. The textures look a lot nicer in the new versions too. Plus, you can even play it portably on the Switch! There are few finer moments in life than offing a dog as you’re dropping a log.\n\nAvailable elsewhere: METAL GEAR SOLID 2: SONS OF LIBERTY / METAL GEAR SOLID 3: SNAKE EATER\n\nTwo iconic PS2 titles that are available on Xbox 360 to download, or on disc on PS3/Xbox 360. They were briefly available on Game Pass last year but quietly disappeared in August. Probably under a cardboard box. They also saw a Vita physical release and can be played on Sony’s PSNow service.\n\n[JC] Are these ports...solid?\n\nMostly a lick of paint with these “HD Editions”, but you get the definitive versions and the PSP’s Peace Walker is thrown in too! Physical copies were a Zavvi exclusive so it’s easier to track down digitally.\n\nExclusive: GRAN TURISMO 3: A-SPEC / GRAN TURISMO 4\n\nEvery tarmac wanker’s favourite car manufacturer is probably in either of these two behemoth racing sims. They remain exclusive to the PS2 but are more common than Stacey Solomon.\n\n[JC] Why haven’t they been ported?\n\nLicensing. They still look pretty decent and there’s plenty to keep you busy. Gran Turismo 5 and 6 do the same job on PS3, while Gran Turismo Sport on PS4 went down the e-sports route, so lacks a proper career mode. If you can wait, there’s Gran Turismo 7 arriving this year on PS5.\n\nAvailable elsewhere: DEVIL MAY CRY / DEVIL MAY CRY 3\n\nA lovely HD collection was released for Xbox 360 and PS3 in 2012 and was released again on PS4 and Xbox One. You can even play it on PC if you’re that way inclined.\n\n[JC] Are they any good now?\n\nSounds like it, but the newest title looks to be the best yet. You can actually play all the Devil May Cry games on a current platform: Devil May Cry 2 (also known as Devil Will Cry), Devil May Cry 4, the DmC title and the latest entry, Devil May Cry 5 are all available on PS4 and Xbox One. The fifth title just got a new 4K refinement too for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Nintendo fans can also play these two PS2 titles on their Switch.\n\n[JC] Devil May Poo?\n\nIndeed.\n\nAvailable elsewhere: GOD OF WAR / GOD OF WAR II\n\nWildly overrated in their day (I like them, but the review scores were a bit over the top), these two action titles are also available on PS3 and the Vita (physical only now). They are well worth playing, although their absence from the PS4 library is jarring considering God of War III was brought over.\n\n[JC] Doesn’t the new one do away with the original?\n\nNot really, it’s a very different game. But the decision to reboot the series may prevent the first two games from returning for a while. You’ve also got the dodgy sex mini-games, which, when I think about it is probably why they haven’t been re-released.\n\nExclusive: KLONOA 2: LUNATEA’S VEIL\n\nA 2D platformer with 3D visuals - one for the Clockwork Knight fans this one.\n\n[JC] Wasn’t there one of these games on the Wii?\n\nYep. That one is a remake of the first game which, because it didn’t sell well, meant that plans to remake the PS2 title were scrapped.\n\nAvailable: RATCHET & CLANK / RATCHET & CLANK 2: GOING COMMANDO / RATCHET & CLANK 3: UP YOUR ARSENAL\n\nRemember when platformers relied on wisecracking animal duos? Banjo-Kazooie, Jak & Daxter, Sooty and Sweep Do Dallas 64. Ratchet & Clank is more weapons based and less furry (thanks to this duo being robotic).\n\n[JC] They worth revisiting?\n\nRatchet & Clank was \"re-imagined\" on PS4 which is probably a good place to start. The full trilogy was polished up and released on PS3 and Vita - all well received shooty-platformers but unlikely to set your world alight. No idea why they didn’t bring them to PS4 but the new one on PS5 is out soon.\n\nAvailable: TWISTED METAL: BLACK\n\nDrab car-combat with adult language. It’s a bit like braving a McDonald’s Drive-Thru car park late on a Friday evening. The PS2 version is available on PS4.\n\n[JC] Was this actually any good?\n\nYeah, but it’s a product of its time. Does really need a few mates to fully appreciate but given it’s always on sale for a couple of quid, there are worse ways to spend a Friday evening.\n\n[JC] Like in a McDonald’s Drive-Thru car park?\n\nExactly.\n\nAvailable: SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS\n\nFashionable boss battle title that was given an HD facelift on PS3, then full reconstructive surgery on the PS4. Get that version.\n\n[JC] Is there no reason to pick up the original?\n\nNot unless you like paying more for an inferior product.\n\nGeneration exclusive: DEAD OR ALIVE 2\n\nRefined arcade fighter that stands the test of time. Available on the original Xbox in a semi-remake (alongside the first game) as Dead or Alive Ultimate, which can be played on an Xbox 360. DOA2 was also on Dreamcast.\n\n[JC] I’m here for the shoulder boulders. Where’s my best place for that?\n\nDead or Alive 5 Ultimate and Dead or Alive 6 are your best bet on modern systems, and they are genuinely good fighting games too. I promise.\n\n[JC] Your flies are undone.\n\nDamn it.\n\nAvailable: ICO\n\nModern games can feel too handholdy to some, but none more so than this critical darling. An early PS2 release, it has seen better days. Namely on the PS3 as part of the Ico-Shadow of the Colossus Collection.\n\n[JC] No PS4 version?\n\nUnfortunately not and it wasn’t as popular as Shadow of the Colossus so I doubt we’ll see a full-blown remake any time soon.\n\nAvailable: JAK & DAXTER / JAK II\n\nNaughty Dog’s 3D platforming series had a number of games on the PS2 (that number being 5) and the first four are all available on the PS4 as “PS2 Classics”, even though the first three did get HD remasters on the PS3. An odd one, that.\n\n[JC] What one's missing?\n\nThere was a PSP title called The Lost Frontier that was released in late 2009 - it also dropped on PS2. In 2009! But it wasn't as good as earlier titles. This was a post-Mario Galaxy world, after all.\n\nAvailable: SHIN MEGAMI TENSEI: PERSONA 3 / SHIN MEGAMI TENSEI: PERSONA 4\n\nPart-time job disguised as a videogame, the vast Persona titles came into their own on the PS2. Persona 3 is playable on PSP whilst the fourth entry is cited as a Vita highlight.\n\n[JC] Wasn’t the PS2 a goldmine for J-RPGs?\n\nYeah, although by default considering the GameCube and Xbox weren’t exactly go-to machines for the genre. These two are worth a small fortune these days - Persona 3 is £140 at CEX and some mug just bought it on Music Magpie for £2.59. True story.\n\nGeneration exclusive: VIEWTIFUL JOE / VIEWTIFUL JOE 2\n\nTough as nails brawler/platformer with a beautiful aesthetic and neat gameplay gimmick. Both games are exclusive to PS2 and GameCube.\n\n[JC] Bit of a fan favourite this - what happened to Joe?\n\nIt's a strange one. Apparently it sold really well on GameCube but terribly on PS2 (the first game sold 275,000 on Cube, 46,000 on PS2). Very backwards considering the size of the audiences. Capcom has pretty much given up on the series since a couple of handheld efforts in 2005 on the DS and PSP.\n\nAvailable: RAYMAN: REVOLUTION\n\nFor some reason, the PS2 saw a revised version of the N64/PlayStation/Dreamcast platformer Rayman 2. Acclaimed at the time, is this really what you’re craving a PS2 for?\n\n[JC] This was 3D wasn’t it?\n\nYep - it’s highly unlikely this ended up being any sort of revolution, but if you really want to play Rayman 2, the N64 version was ported to the Nintendo DS and the Dreamcast version ended up on the 3DS. At least those ones are portable.\n\n[JC] No terrible poo joke?\n\nI mean I would, but there’s no need to go out on a limb for one etc. etc.\n\nAvailable: DRAGON QUEST VIII\n\nSo you like dragons, quests and roman numerals? Boy have I got the game for you. This vast J-RPG saw a second life on the 3DS but the PS2 version is a lot cheaper.\n\n[JC] Do I need to know the plot from the previous seven entries?\n\nMate, it’s probably something about evil forces, magic and turn-based battling. With a party including an irritating anthropomorphic cuddly toy, a heavy-set ex-bouncer from Rochdale and a questionably young lass with enormous norks.\n\n[JC] Oh thanks, that’s 80 hours saved.\n\nYou’re welcome.\n\nExclusive: ACE COMBAT 4: SHATTERED SKIES\n\nPeople really hated the sky in the early 2000s. Deadly Skies, Crimson Skies, Sky’s Gamezville. Shattered Skies is the fourth entry in what is essentially the Japanese version of Top Gun.\n\n[JC] These seem to review well - what’s the big deal?\n\nIf you’ve ever enjoyed After Burner Climax or even StarFox then Ace Combat is that but with more (ahem) grounded missions and targets. They must be popular as there are loads of them - this one actually sold 2.6m copies! Ace Combat 4 is a PS2 exclusive and is actually called Ace Combat: Distant Thunder in the UK.\n\nAvailable: TOM CLANCY’S SPLINTER CELL / TOM CLANCY’S SPLINTER CELL: PANDORA TOMORROW / TOM CLANCY’S SPLINTER CELL: CHAOS THEORY\n\nStealth trilogy that is often associated with Xbox. And that’s your best place to play them - they are all playable and actually enhanced on the One X, Series S and Series X.\n\n[JC] Was this the peak for Tom’s sneak-’em-up series?\n\nChaos Theory is a classic as far as the level design goes, although I personally prefer the risk-reward insta-kills of Conviction and Blacklist. Until Ubisoft greenlight (all three of them) a new entry, you’re best playing these on Xbox as the PS2 ports aren’t great.\n\nAvailable: SILENT HILL 2 / SILENT HILL 3\n\nA ropey PS3/360 HD collection was released a decade ago and that’s your best bet here. Unless of course, you don’t have a PS3 or 360. But the PS2 titles have skyrocketed in price recently.\n\n[JC] What was wrong with the HD collection?\n\nAccording to last month’s Official PlayStation Magazine, “there are texture problems” but it’s a small price to pay considering these are two of the best survival horror titles of their time.\n\n[JC] Will I shit my pants?\n\nYeah, but it won’t be as memorable as it’s not on Switch! But then, shitting your pants is always memorable. The fuck am I talking about?\n\nGeneration exclusive: Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance\n\nA console interpretation of the hit PC RPG that was on all three consoles at the time, but the PS2 one was the version that won loads of awards.\n\n[JC] Baldur’s Gate returned on Switch recently - is that the best one?\n\nYeah the first two titles are the so-called classics, and both returned on Switch, Xbox One and PS4. I won’t judge you for getting them instead of this.\n\nAvailable: BULLY\n\nOr Canis Canem Edit as it’s known here. This game is a Rockstar gem that’s available on Xbox 360, Wii, PS4 and even Android/iOS! The PS2 original is probably the worst version as these all expanded upon the game with additional modes and spruced up visuals.\n\n[JC] Why is this so fondly remembered?\n\nI’m not too sure why, as the protagonist just reminds me of the young potato-faced Wayne Rooney. It had a small open-world similar to the Yakuza series so you got to know the environments and characters more intimately. It never quite clicked for me, as it’s set in America but it’s designed like a British private school - so you’ve got a lot of American teenagers in a British setting and it’s never clear if it’s set now or in the 1950s. It’s definitely more The Beano than The Inbetweeners.\n\nAvailable: DARK CHRONICLE\n\nYeah, yeah another Japanese RPG… But this one is less Japanese, if that makes sense. It’s by the same guys that did Ni No Kuni and has a gorgeous cel-shaded visual style. You can play this on your PS4 (it’s one of the PS2 classics).\n\n[JC] I always get this and Rogue Galaxy mixed up.\n\nDon’t blame you, they are both by developers Level-5, both RPGs and both cel-shaded. It’s similarly great!\n\nAvailable: KINGDOM HEARTS / KINGDOM HEARTS II\n\nConvoluted Disney mash-up that’s beloved if divisive. These games are available on the PS3; the first is part of Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix while the sequel is in Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix, or you can get both on PS4. That one’s called Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX and has a bunch of the other spin-offs too from the GBA, DS, PSP and 3DS.\n\n[JC] Are they taking the Mickey?\n\nNo, but the Realm of Darkness does. And yes I sifted through a Kingdom Hearts wiki to get that joke in.\n\nAvailable: GUILTY GEAR X2\n\nGuilty Gear isn’t far off Kingdom Hearts as far as “what game is what”. A beautifully drawn fighter that originally debuted on the PlayStation as Guilty Gear, Guilty Gear X appeared on Dreamcast (2000) and PS2 (2001), with Guilty Gear X2 arriving on PS2 in 2003. From there, it goes down the Street Fighter II route with countless updates (mostly to add a couple of characters and patch in balancing issues for hardcore fans that notice that sort of thing). Deep breath\n\nFirst update: Guilty Gear X2 #Reload - PS2, Xbox, PSP\n\nSecond update: Guilty XX Slash - PS2\n\nThird update: Guilty Gear XX Accent Core - PS2, Wii\n\nFourth update: Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus - PS2, PSP, Wii, Xbox 360, PS3\n\nFifth update: Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R - Vita, PS3, Xbox 360, Switch\n\n[JC] Fair play. That makes a bit more sense now, but what’s the latest one?\n\nAfter Guilty Gear X2 was flogged to death, it was replaced in 2014 by Guilty Gear Xrd (presumably to indicate it’s X3 - just call it that!). Since then, we have had Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator and Guilty Gear Xrd Rev. 2. A new Guilty Gear is due this year on PS4 and PS5, called Guilty Gear Strive. The lack of an X should have been replaced with a “why”.\n\nAvailable: HALF-LIFE\n\nYou can probably play this on any laptop now thanks to Steam, but the PS2 port was a respectable addition to the system’s library in 2001. You also had Deus Ex - another 10/10 PC title.\n\n[JC] So now you’re telling me that I don’t need to buy a Windows XP PC too?\n\nYou can if you want, but there was a window in the early years of the PS2 where the best of PC ended up on PS2. Unreal Tournament, Giants: Citizen Kabuto, Commandos 2, Age of Empires II - it’s like Sony wanted to get them out before the GameCube and Xbox turned up. Or to hide their shoddy launch year line-up.\n\nAvailable: ONIMUSHA WARLORDS / ONIMUSHA 3: DEMON SIEGE\n\nSamurai-action game that did what a lot of Capcom series do - starts interesting then descends into ludicrous territory, as the third game is set in France (and features Jean Reno!). You can play the first game on Switch, Xbox One, PC and PS4; the third game is still available to purchase on Steam.\n\n[JC] How come Capcom have neglected Onimusha? It was a popular series.\n\nYeah, there was a fourth game; 2006’s Dawn of Dreams but it didn’t sell well, and Kenji Inafune said he’d rather make Mega Man Legends 3 than do another Onimusha. I’m sure we’ll see the series again one day.\n\nAvailable: SUIKODEN III\n\nAnother series that ended on the PS2 (there was a spin-off on DS and PSP) - Suikoden III didn’t actually get a European release. Until 2015 when it arrived on PS4 as a “PS2 Classic”.\n\n[JC] I’ve heard about this series - which one’s the good one?\n\nIt’s a well-loved series and my understanding is that Suikoden II is the one fans bang on about. That’s on the PlayStation, with three more sequels on the PS2. I guess if you’re into Japanese RPGs these will be games on your radar.\n\nAvailable: BEYOND GOOD & EVIL\n\nPokemon Snap but you get a game with it! Fondly remembered action adventure with a photography slant, Beyond Good & Evil got a lovely HD re-release on Xbox 360 and PS3 in 2011, and there was a physical release alongside Outland and From Dust.\n\n[JC] Any signs of the sequel?\n\nIt’s been quiet hasn’t it? The signs aren’t great and after the disappointment that was Shenmue III, sequels arriving almost two decades later are rarely worth the wait.\n\nAvailable: KATAMARI DAMACY\n\nExclusive: WE LOVE KATAMARI\n\nVideogames are inspired by all areas of life. Shigsy built Pikmin after an inspired trip to the garden for a casual leak, Pac-Man came about after a slice of fortune in a pizzeria, and Katamari Damacy allegedly came into fruition on a warm summer day, as lead designer Keita Takahashi had to keep unsticking his ballsack from his inner thigh. Allegedly.\n\n[JC] Explains why your mum is credited in Donut County.\n\nWow. Katamari Damacy was recently remastered and is available on Switch, PC, Xbox One and PS4. We Love Katamari is the sequel and is very similar, but remains exclusive to the PS2.\n\nAvailable: AMPLITUDE\n\nIt’s weird to see music games like Amplitude as full retail releases - it just doesn’t happen any more. Music and rhythm games are now strictly indie territory, and Amplitude is very much a product of its era. Despite this, it saw a remake in 2016 for PS3 and PS4 (thanks to a fan Kickstarter).\n\n[JC] Weren’t there a few of these games on PS2?\n\nI know what you’re getting at. I thought Fantavision was a music title, but is instead a fireworks puzzler. Then you had Rez in 2002, a port of the trance-heavy Dreamcast title, and then Harmonix’s game Frequency - Amplitude is the sequel to that but features pop-rock rather than electronic dance tracks.\n\nGeneration Exclusive: COLIN MCRAE RALLY 3\n\nMuddy visuals weren’t necessarily a selling point on the PS1, more a technical limitation, but that didn’t stop Colin McRae becoming the Tony Hawk of the rally scene in the late 90s. The game is also available on Xbox and Windows.\n\n[JC] Is this a bit pointless now given the Dirt games are so good?\n\nKinda. There were some excellent rally titles in the early 2000s, from Rallisport Challenge on Xbox, World Rally Championship on PS2 and even the rally mode in Gran Turismo 3, yet Colin McRae was a proper mix of arcade and simulation, which is now split between Dirt (arcade) and Dirt Rally (simulation).\n\nAvailable: Psychonauts\n\nTrippy little 3D platformer with a charming sense of humour, Psychonauts is available on your Xbox and PS4. Much like Beyond Good & Evil, a sequel has been in development for a while (since 2015).\n\n[JC] I always thought this was an Xbox game - what gives?\n\nI guess because the box art is that luminous green, but it was originally an OG Xbox exclusive until Microsoft dropped it in 2004 before Majesco published it in 2006. It might have been a bigger deal if it had released earlier - instead, it’s a cult classic that happened to get a PS2 port. Probably to try and recoup some money.\n\nExclusive: WWE SMACKDOWN: HERE COMES THE PAIN\n\nYeah you’re not seeing this anywhere else. The PS2 is home to some superb wrestling games so it’s well worth picking up for them if you’re into your sweaty grappling.\n\n[JC] What made the PS2 games so great then, spandex boy?\n\nThey were just the right combination of the N64 games’ natural, more methodical grappling systems and the PS1 predecessors that were quick and arcade-like. The big selling point though is that there was just so much to do. Tonnes of modes and huge career modes that had the best rosters of all time (this was when WWF and WCW line-ups combined). Even if you don’t like wrestling, these are at least goofy and stupid enough to enjoy on their own merits - unlike the new 2K games.\n\nKinda available: Hot Shots Golf 3\n\nA bit like Mario Golf but with less charm. Hot Shots Golf became Everybody’s Golf, and this third entry didn’t even come out in Europe despite selling two million copies in the United States. Hot Shots Golf 4 (or Everybody’s Golf in Europe) is available on PS2 too. They are all pretty similar, so grab the version on either PSP, PS3, Vita or PS4 if you have them. There’s even a PSVR version!\n\n[JC] Not to use up one of my pick-up lines, but tell me more about the Mario Golf comparison.\n\nYou little romantic. They both use the two-click method of power and precision to hit the ball, along with lengthy career modes with unlockable characters and courses. There’s a goofiness to it all too and pound for pound, Everybody’s Golf has filled in nicely when Mario Golf has been absent."
