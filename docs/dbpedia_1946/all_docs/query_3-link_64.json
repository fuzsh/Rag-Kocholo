        "text": "There's something very comforting about the bottom right corner of the box labeling the game as \"park simulation\".\n\nKonami released a trio of JP3 games at the same time on the GBA and they all have this genre identifier in the corner to set them apart lol\n\nI was assigned to review all three for a small website a long time ago. The park builder was the best of the three. The other two are not worth even remembering their names.\n\nRebelstar: Galactic Command, which has the most wild game cover ever:\n\nThe actual game looks like\n\nAlso it's a tactical game by fuckin julian gollop\n\nI have to check this out! o.o\n\nCame here for hidden gems, then got recommendation like Golden Sun, Megaman, Final Fantasy?? Common people you can do better.\n\nMy recommendation is Sigma Star Saga.\n\nIt's an ARPG + Shmups. Both rpg part and Shmups parts are really fun and they're interconnected. You can get experience in Shmups sections and you can also get parts to upgrade your ship from RPG section. Graphics and story is good too.\n\nAnd you sold me on that game, I'll put it on the list! :D\n\nI replayed them all last year and I still love them all, some more some less but I think they are all still great. It was a bit easy to get lost in MMBN2 and 3 but MMBN4-6 streamlined the internet. I can see however how people might not like the fifth entry, the story and the SRPG battles are really a bit meh. Okay and I skipped the first game because that aged far more roughly than the rest though with the DS remaster having a English patch now I might have to grab a copy if it's cheap and play that instead.\n\nOne thing I noticed, the themes and events seem a bit more disturbing to adult-me than than they felt as a kid, realizing what the WWW really does and the end of MMBN2 in the final parts where the real and the digital worlds merge.\n\nI plan to tackle Starforce this year! :D\n\nI agree, but even then the combat is sadly a bit too sparse in all aspects, like a SRPG lite. Still the moment where Pharsti goes Orbital Frame is amazing and gives me chills to this day! :D\n\nI've been meaning to play them eventually actually, are they cheap to import?\n\nStar force is good too if you haven't played it. I recently replayed 1. It definitely ages the worst but I still have fun playing it.\n\nCame here for hidden gems, then got recommendation like Golden Sun, Megaman, Final Fantasy??

Graphics and story is good too.\n\nI came into this thread to suggest this, it seems like the kind of wacky experiment that nobody really played back in the day, so no one really talks about it. I haven't gotten to it yet myself (still on my backlog) but I remember reading about it in Nintendo Power as a kid and was so intrigued, the genre blend looks fun. Maybe I'll play it soon. How bad are the random encounters? I do remember the frequency and unpredictability of them being a big criticism when I read reviews for it.\n\nI came into this thread to suggest this, it seems like the kind of wacky experiment that nobody really played back in the day, so no one really talks about it.

How bad are the random encounters? I do remember the frequency and unpredictability of them being a big criticism when I read reviews for it.\n\nI didn't really mind random encounters and they're not too frequent. In fact I actually looked forward to it since I enjoyed the Shmups part more lol.\n\nZone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars is a terrible game but about the best Visual Novel to be found on the GBA I think.\n\nI had this game and could never get into it when I was a teen (I ended up skipping the story, should've given it a go). The action-time aiming system was terrible though.\n\nOther than that I recommend Summon Night: Swordcraft Story 1 & 2. They're both great games; good combat, characters, music, mostly light hearted fun. The first one is more focused on a gameplay loop between going through a massive labyrinth and upgrading things in your town, while the second is a much larger in scale RPG. It has Tales' style combat and fun crafting system.\n\nDamn, I remember wanting to play this game so much after seeing screenshots in magazines.\n\nKonami Krazy Racers is a better kart racer than Mario Kart Super Circuit in pretty much every regard, it is wacky, fast, has a really fun roster (Vic Viper! Bear Tank! Dracula! Goemon!) and top notch music.\n\ntsk tsk tsk Why you do my boy Power pro Kun dirty like that?\n\nBoktai: The Sun is in Your Hand.\n\nIt's an action game produced by Hideo Kojima where you play as a vampire hunter named Django who's... well, hunting vampires. It's played from an isometric perspective, and has some light stealth mechanics in the vein of Metal Gear (you can get against a wall and tap on it to attract enemies to that spot, etc.).\n\nThe cool part is that your weapon, the Gun del Sol, kills things with sunlight... literally. The game cart has a built-in solar sensor that detects sunlight, and you use that to replenish your gun's energy/ammunition. If you run out of energy and it isn't sunny out (or you don't have a blacklight nearby), you have to try to sneak your way past enemies (or just generally avoid them). The sensor also detects the intensity of the sunlight, so if it's a really sunny day, your energy recharges more quickly (and iirc, it will also restore your health). It's a really cool system.\n\nThe game's kind of expensive nowadays unfortunately, but it's a really unique game that I think is worth playing. The sequels are good too (though the third game never released outside of Japan, and the fourth game on DS is very different and not as good as the rest).\n\nAlso: if you get your hands on a cart and don't want to mess with the solar sensor (or if the sensor is broken or something), you can rip the ROM and apply a fanmade patch that lets you manually adjust the sunlight levels using the GBA's shoulder buttons. It takes some of the fun out of it, but it's still a solid game regardless.\n\nSome more screenshots! Unfortunately most of the screenshots online are from the first areas but the game has your classic zelda spread of environments, with snow, swamp and desert biomes.\n\nOh, and it has a whole Pokemon style monster collecting side-quest.\n\nTheir mascot monster (which I don't think actually debuted in this game) is a perfectly unsubtle blend of Pikachu and Kirby:\n\nAnd here's my personal favourite track in the game:\n\nIt's the sequel to Bomberman Quest for the Game Boy Color. I liked the GBC version better, but this one is good too.\n\nAstro Boy Omega Factor, one of the best 2D action games ever.\n\nCame to say this.\n\nDouble Dragon Advance is also pretty underrated.\n\nCame in here for this. Play this game.\n\nI was about to post this.\n\nI can never understand the praise for this game. It's super repetitive. you fight the same enemies over and over with different size and color palette. I find it pretty average.\n\nMy suggestions are Drill Dozer and Tekken Advance if you are into fighting games\n\nWell, this is what I played last night :\n\n- DemiKids : Dark\n\nA SMT spin-off which aimed at surfing on the Pokémon trend. Didn't really like it. My not-Persona favourite spin-off stays Another Bible on Game Boy (the T-RPG) but the quest continues\n\n- Astro Boy\n\nI actually had played this one already but I... had forgotten about. What a blast! Definitely revisiting it later. I'm stuck at the beginning of world 2 yet but it shouldn't last too long.\n\n- Starfy\n\nI had played it already a couple of years ago but very very briefly. I really love it. What a gem.\n\n- Star Wars Episode III\n\nI did NOT expect that, but then again I wasn't THAT surprised. Super Return of the Jedi (Game Boy, not SNES) was one of my favourite games as a kid. I'm a sucker for Star Wars beat'em all and platformers so that was fun.\n\nNoted a lot of really really intriguing games that I'm going to try tonight. Thanks for your inputs :D Man, the GBA has a great library. I kind of feel bad for overlooking it.\n\nI would recommend you buy this game. It pushes the Game Boy Advance hardware with the amount of enemies that can appear on-screen. Zero slow-down. As you can see from the cover art it has dinosaurs. Another thing it has is a time-slowing mechanic (fyi, it is also made by the same developer who made Max Payne on GBA). And there is 4 player death match available via one cartridge! Check it out.\n\nI would recommend checking this out if you're a fan of the Rolling Thunder series. I enjoyed this quite a lot more than Metal Slug Advance. The boss fights are always a pleasure. The last level is highly memorable and well executed.\n\nI would recommend you buy this game. It pushes the Game Boy Advance hardware with the amount of enemies that can appear on-screen.

And there is 4 player death match available via one cartridge! Check it out.\n\nThanks for this. Game looks really cool and I had no idea it existed. By the name and the cover art, I would have 100% skipped even booting this game.\n\nHere's one I don't think has been mentioned:\n\nCIMA: The Enemy.\n\nStupid name, but the game is really cool:"
