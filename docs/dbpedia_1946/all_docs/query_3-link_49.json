        "text": "Game Preferred platforms PC version issues 007 Nightfire PlayStation 2\n\nXbox\n\nGameCube Completely different game, developed by Gearbox Software. Some weapons appear in the console version but not the PC version, has fewer levels than the console versions and does not implement driving mode. It uses Half-Life's game engine, GoldSrc. Had a mixed reception compared to the console's counterpart. 2006 FIFA World Cup/FIFA World Cup: Germany 2006 Xbox 360 Based on the version for 6th generation consoles, instead on superior one for Xbox 360. Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain PlayStation Worse camera, slower animations, poor quality sound and FMVs compared to PS1 version. Numerous crash issues and incompatibility with the modern PCs. Most of the issues can be fixed by Verok's GL Wrapper & Patch. Castlevania: Lords of Shadow PlayStation 3\n\nXbox 360 Does not include foliage animation[1] and the Solid Snake outfit[2] from the console versions. Crazy Taxi Dreamcast\n\nGameCube The 2002 PC port is locked to 50 FPS, is missing the licensed soundtrack, and is prone to crashing when loading into the city without Windows Compatibility Mode fixes. The 2011/2014 Steam version is playable at 60 FPS, but suffers from many of the same problems as previous PC port and runs horribly due to bad optimization with DirectX 9[3]. Use DXVK, SilentPatch, and Crazy Taxi Overhaul to fix the issues with current Steam version, or just play the Dreamcast version. Cröixleur Sigma PlayStation 4\n\nSwitch The Japanese PlayStation 4 version has PSVR capabilities (was removed in the international releases for reasons unknown), while all versions of the Switch port features a pseudo-VR \"Gyro Mode\" that re-creates VR through the Joy-Con's gyroscopic accelerometer, and both console versions have local co-op multiplayer for select modes, all of which are missing in the latest \"Deluxe Edition\" version on PC. The PC version of Deluxe Edition also introduced a bug with the Wanderer feature in the Dungeon Mode which causes the player to take severe damage (if not One-Hit K.O.) from them unless the game is played in Offline Mode. English translation for the in-game subtitles are also worse in the PC version with missing spaces between words or missing text strings, leading to a lot of run off sentences. Darkstone PlayStation The 3D engine in the PC version, while outputting in higher resolution, is known to produce rendering errors on some systems, both older and newer. The music is very glitchy and dialogue audio cuts off abruptly. The PC version allows multiplayer and two-character mode, but some PS1 features like selling artifacts are missing. Some players also find the camera/battle controls awkward and unintuitive compared with the console. Devil May Cry 5 PlayStation 5\n\nXbox Series X/S Сonsoles has an expanded \"Special Edition\" version of the game with additional features (Legendary Dark Knight Mode, ray tracing and Turbo Mode), which are not available on PC. Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot Xbox Series X/S\n\nPlayStation 5 The next gen update was not ported to PC. Driver: San Francisco PlayStation 3\n\nXbox 360 Missing the split screen multiplayer mode and a grainy orange filter. FIFA 06\n\nFIFA 07 Xbox 360 Based on the version for 6th generation consoles, instead on superior one for Xbox 360. Although it has limited content on the Xbox 360 compared to 6th generation home consoles and PC - EA cut several leagues from the Xbox 360 version of the game. FIFA 08\n\nFIFA 09\n\nFIFA 10 PlayStation 3\n\nXbox 360 Based on the version for 6th generation consoles, instead on superior one for 7th generation. FIFA 11 PlayStation 3\n\nXbox 360 After long time shipping 6th generation based game to PC, this one is finally based on the version for 7th generation consoles but with limited quantity of new features. FIFA 14 PlayStation 4 (Pro)\n\nXbox One (X/S) Based on the version for 7th generation consoles, instead on superior one for 8th generation. FIFA 21\n\nFIFA 22 PlayStation 5\n\nXbox Series X/S Based on the version for 8th generation consoles, instead on superior one for 9th generation. Finding Nemo PlayStation 2\n\nXbox\n\nGameCube Completely different game, developed by a different studio. Grand Theft Auto:\n\nSan Andreas PlayStation 2\n\nXbox Many missing effects, worse textures and different map geometry, compared to the PS2 version. Some problems can be fixed by using mods; the retail \"Second Edition\" (v2), Steam, and Rockstar Games Launcher versions, however, need to be downgraded to be moddable. Madden NFL 06 Xbox 360 Based on the version for 6th generation consoles, instead on graphically better one for Xbox 360. Though most people prefer Madden NFL 06 of the sixth generation over those of the seventh generation ones. Madden NFL 07 PlayStation 3\n\nXbox 360 Based on the version for 6th generation consoles, instead on graphically better one for 7th generation versions. Though some people prefer Madden NFL 07 of the sixth generation over those of the seventh generation ones. Metal Gear Solid PlayStation The FMVs don't work on modern PCs and lack blur effects. The GOG.com release fixes the FMVs, and a mod fixes additional issues. NBA 2K14 PlayStation 4 (Pro)\n\nXbox One (X/S) Based on the version for 7th generation consoles, instead on graphically better one for eighth gen.[1] NBA Live 06\n\nNBA Live 07 Xbox 360 Based on the version for 6th generation consoles, instead on graphically better one for Xbox 360.

NHL 08\n\nNHL 09 PlayStation 3\n\nXbox 360 Based on the version for 6th generation consoles, instead on superior one for 7th generation. However similar to FIFA 07 situation NHL 08 has limited features on the 7th generation version compared to 6th generation home consoles and PC. PowerSlave/Exhumed Windows (R)\n\nPlayStation\n\nSega Saturn\n\nA completely different game; while the original PC release is a straightforward FPS get from point A to point B, while Sega Saturn and PS1 versions are closer to being a 3D metroidvania. Whether Saturn or PS1 version is better is a matter of taste, PS1 has unlocked framerate and true translucency for water surfaces but its level geometry is simplified and lighting is distinctly different. The console versions served as a basis for the 2022 remaster for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC. Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands Wii The Wii version is a completely different (and superior) game than the PS3/360/PC version. Pro Evolution Soccer 6/Winning Eleven: Pro Evolution Soccer 2007 Xbox 360 Based on the version for 6th generation consoles, instead on superior one for Xbox 360. Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 PlayStation 4 (Pro)\n\nXbox One (X/S) The next gen update was not made for the PC version. Rayman 2 PlayStation 2\n\n3DS\n\nDreamcast Too many differences to list here. Michel Ancel has said that he considers the Dreamcast port the best version of the game. Rayman 3D (the 3DS port) is based on the Dreamcast version with some additional content, but has some additional issues and FPS drops. New 3DS models can fix the performance issues by forcing New 3DS mode using CFW. Silent Hill 2 PlayStation 2\n\nXbox Missing some effects, fog effects are lower quality, audio is worse and some effects are missing details, badly converted FMVs, and has compatibility issues on modern versions of Windows and newer hardware. Many problems from the PC version can be patched using the Silent Hill 2: Enhanced Edition. The Sims PlayStation 2\n\nXbox\n\nGameCube Different engine. Sonic Adventure DX GameCube\n\nDreamcast Too many to list here. The GameCube version is also affected by many downgrades compared to the Dreamcast version, but is playable at 60 FPS and story cutscenes can be skipped. Use SADX Mod Installer to downgrade and patch any of the PC ports, or just play the Dreamcast version. Sonic Adventure 2 GameCube\n\nDreamcast GameCube version has some improved character models, revamped multiplayer, and a few quality of life changes, but is marred many visual downgrades, errors during the cutscenes, and worse sound mixing than the Dreamcast version. HD version on PS3, Xbox 360, and PC supports 16:9 aspect-ratio, but is inconsistent between in-engine cutscenes as it sometimes shifts back to 4:3, is missing some Chao Garden features, content featured in the GameCube version is locked behind a DLC paywall, introduces more bugs than other versions, and sound mixing is even worse to the point of blaring over other sounds. Patch the PC version with SA Mod Manager and install various mods to fix these problems, or just play the Dreamcast version. Spider-Man 2 PlayStation 2\n\nXbox\n\nGameCube Completely different game, developed by a different studio. It was \"dumbed down\" for a young audience and thus featured more simplistic and less challenging gameplay. SpongeBob SquarePants:\n\nBattle for Bikini Bottom PlayStation 2\n\nXbox\n\nGameCube Completely different game, developed by a different studio. The remake titled SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom – Rehydrated is based on the original console versions.

Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow PlayStation 2\n\nXbox\n\nGameCube Shadows, water and torchlight may not render correctly on modern PCs. It is recommended to play it on the original Xbox. Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent PlayStation 2\n\nXbox\n\nGameCube The PC version is the сontroversial 7th gen version, not the superior 6th gen version. Tomb Raider (1996) PlayStation The PC version of the game is notorious for having missing music. Patches exist that add it from the PSX version. Note that the proper music is not a continuous soundtrack and only plays when certain events happen; to test if your version has been patched, see if the demo in Lara's Home asks you to use the joystick. Toy Story 3 PlayStation 3\n\nXbox 360 The Windows version is a port of the Wii version instead of the X360/PS3 versions, have fewer Toy Box options for gameplay and town customization, and lack a multiplayer option.

Some weapon and Gadgetron vendor graphics are vertically compressed. Big Al's character model has numerous visible holes, most notably in his tongue and shirt. The memory card that was used to save and load icons in the menu was replaced by a brain with eyes in a container. The Shady Salesman's character model is missing its eyes. The exploit to explore the Blackwater City hoverboard tracks on foot for the infinite bolt glitch is fixed, per the Platinum re-release of Ratchet & Clank. However, it is still possible to access them by using a Decoy Glove to force yourself of bounds. Most sound-emitting gadgets (such as the Metal Detector) have a different sound when used compared to the original PS2 release. In the bargain snagglebeast fight on Umbris, when the beast triggers its shield, it will be green. On Quartu, after Ratchet finds out Drek is going to destroy his home, the lighting in the cutscene is darker than usual. The music that plays while fighting Chairman Drek on Veldin (which was left out of the North American PlayStation 2 release due to a bug, but restored in the PAL release) is normally missing. After beating the game, when the HelpDesk Girl appears at the end, no dialogue from her plays. Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando PS3\n\nVita PS3/Vita: cropped widescreen, In the options menu (either main menu or in-game) a new option called subtitles appears, but can never be toggled in the PlayStation 3 version. Subtitles can still be activated from the settings on the main menu screen in the PS Vita version. In the initial screen, Ratchet only plays one demo instead of multiple ones; at the end of any demo, the game goes to the main menu. When arriving at any destination, the cutscene where Ratchet & Clank exit the ship is sometimes missing. In cutscenes, the camera is more zoomed out compared to the original PS2 release. This is notable on Tabora, where after Ratchet throws his OmniWrench off-frame in the original, it is still visible in the remaster. Abercrombie Fizzwidget's glasses are now dark instead of clear, much like Tuxedo Ratchet's glasses which changed in the same way between Going Commando and Up Your Arsenal. The Maktar Resort's central structure no longer rotates. The slot machines on Maktar Resort have a missing texture bug where the entire piece surrounding the slot display is pure white instead of metallic.\n\nWater graphics that consist of two 2D films with the one used as light reflection effect (on Tabora lakes, Dobbo acid, and Grelbin water in the factory) in the original version now consist of only the one film used as the reflection effect. The Abercrombie Fizzwidget robot on Todano no longer speaks while giving the tour. This greatly increases the ease at earning the \"You're My Hero\" skill point.\n\nRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal PS3\n\nVita PS3/Vita: cropped widescreen, Extra skins are purchasable in Up Your Arsenal, such as the Ninja and Sumo Ratchet skins. the Santa Ratchet skin and Pipo-Saru Ratchet skin (These two skins were previously exclusive to the Japanese version)can be accessible by cheats. Any of the skins above cannot be obtained in the PS Vita version, and in addition, the Constructobot skin won't unlock after collecting all the trophies.\n\nThe Holoshield Glove's V1 version (and not the others) shoots out rotating rectangles, rather than the expected oval with the proper textures. Some of the display elements in Up Your Arsenal are a slightly different hue from the orange-brown color in the PlayStation 2 version. With the exception of the Miniturret Glove, the reticle for certain launcher/glove weapons is different. The Nitro Launcher and Bouncer, for example, used a reticle with a series of segmented, spinning rings, but now have the cog-like reticle from the Glove of Doom. Some particle effects are missing, such as some bloom particles and loading screen effects on Aquatos. The sound effects for when the ship is flying from planet to planet plays in a different order. Exiting the Quick Select option in the Pause menu will exit the whole pause menu. When using the Tyhrra-Guise to interact with tyhrranoids, there is no variation in the key tone regardless of which button is pressed during the rhythm game. In the Vita version, the unnamed Qwark vid-comic has extremely bad graphical issues. In offline or online multiplayer matches, there is no longer music while waiting before the start. In addition, multiplayer was taken out altogether in the PS Vita version A secret debug menu in the game which unlocks weapons, gadgets, missions, and planets can be accessed.\n\nRatchet: Deadlocked PS3 though there are no new textures or model refinements and graphics match the native texture resolution on PlayStation 2. Players have noted a few issues with the cinematics, with some full-motion video cinematics being improperly rescaled, in-game cinematics sometimes suffering camera and graphical glitches, and the inability to turn on subtitles. There are also some framerate and technical glitches reported in the gameplay. The port features PlayStation Network multiplayer functionality, though the four-player local play is no longer supported and is limited to two-player local play, and eight-player multiplayer is limited to six. Red Faction PC PC version lacks some visual effects that are only on ps2. Shadow of the Colossus PS3\n\nPS4(R) PS3: Stable frame-rate (30 FPS locked). runs in 720p or at an odd resolution (960x1080) if 1080i/p video is enabled on the PS3 so it may look a little off unless you disable those video modes. Based on the PAL release but is missing some minor bonus content from that version. Due to some questionable changes on the climbing physics, several of the time attack fights are imbalanced in this version with at least one of them practically requiring an exploit to complete its challenge time on hard mode. Supports stereoscopic 3D but the frame-rate tanks even lower than it does on the PS2 version with it enabled.\n\nPS4:Remake.\n\nShin Megami Tensei: Nocturne Switch\n\nPS4 PS2: Original. \"Hardtype\" Hack for an increased challenge.\n\nSwitch/PS4: Redone character models. Better Visual effects. Has the ability to choose which skills to transfer to demons. New easy mode, A blur will appear on the sides of the screen every time there is FMV, in order to fill the screen. Audio is also still compressed.\n\nSilent Hill 2 PC\n\nXbox\n\nPS3\n\nXbox 360 Windows: Port based on the Xbox version. Buggy, but the Enhanced Edition mod fixes all of the issues and adds a 16:9 aspect-ratio, 60 FPS, higher quality FMVs, and more, making it the definitive version.\n\nXbox: Has the same lighting as the PC version but with the PS2-style soft shadows left intact, fog issues (albeit less noticeable due to the lower resolution), poor audio, and the same relatively low-quality FMVs by default. Can run at 480p.\n\nWindows, Xbox, and PS2 \"Directors Cut (EU)/Greatest Hits (US)\" versions contain bonus material.\n\nPS3/360: HD version based on unfinished code, resulting in an uncountable number of bugs and graphical/audio mistakes. Let you choose between the original voicework of the game or a new redub done by a different cast made for this version... though results may vary. Stay far away.\n\nSilent Hill 3 PC\n\nPS3\n\nXbox 360 PS3/360: HD version based on unfinished code, and completely removed the original voice acting in favor of a new (subjectively worse) redub by a new cast. Same issues as Silent Hill 2 HD, but even worse. Again; stay far away.\n\nWindows: The PC version adds improved flashlight lighting, the ability to save at any time during the game, and 60 FPS gameplay. however, there are some points where the game will drop to 30. If you are running in HD, the DoF effects are rendered in native resolution, making them look pixelated. Fortunately, fan patches available on this page.\n\nSilent Hill 4: The Room PC\n\nXbox Windows: Frame rate is capped at 30 FPS in the retail and digital releases, while cutscenes are at 15 FPS in the physical release, but can be changed to 30fps using mods.\n\nSome of the \"hauntings\" from the console version are missing. GOG version is a port of the inferior European PC-version but has compatibility fixes applied.\n\nXbox: Just as good as the PS2 version, but with 480p support.\n\nSiren PS3 (R) PS3: Titled \"Siren: Blood Curse\", it is a remake of the original ps2 version.\n\nThe American release of Blood Curse contains a slightly edited introductory scene, where a ceremonial stabbing is obscured by excessive camera shakiness. The European release of Blood Curse includes an exclusive making-of documentary titled Behind the Curtain of Terror, which is accessed via the PlayStation 3's XMB Video menu.\n\nSly Cooper PS3\n\nVita PS3/ Vita: The player can now invert the game's camera controls. Developer commentaries in the physical version of the game have been removed. They were added back in for the digital release. There is a drastic increase in the distance between Sly and an enemy required to trigger the sneaking sound of Sly's feet and the sneaky music. It has been increased to the point where Sly will make the sneaking sound almost all the time unless all nearby enemies are defeated. This effect is amplified vertically. Almost all background music has been remixed. Some background music is impacted by de-synchronizations, most notably during \"A Deadly Dance.\" The original background music for \"Treasure in the Depths\" was replaced by the music from \"Burning Rubber,\" and the music from \"A Ghastly Voyage\" was put into \"A Grave Undertaking.\" Some of the sneaky music was replaced by its non-sneaky counterpart. \"Back Alley Heist\" is one example. Some voice acting is also impacted by de-synchronizations, especially Carmelita in both \"Police Headquarters\" and \"Duel by the Dragon.\" In main hub of \"Vicious Voodoo,\" a small trail of coins were added to the path that leads to the \"Piranha Lake\" mission. At the end of \"Duel by the Dragon,\" if the player hits the fireworks clockwise, a glitch occurs where Carmelita does not speak, but the dragon head still falls, followed by the player not being able to move. The player must hit the fireworks counter-clockwise to avoid this. For the PlayStation Vita release, Matt Olsen had to re-voice the camera control tutorial that plays when the player approaches the entrance to \"A Cunning Disguise\" inside \"Prowling the Grounds.\" Since the right analog stick cannot be clicked on the Vita, Bentley instead says, \"to bring the camera behind you, tap the rear touch pad.\" The l1 prompt that is in front of the Bentley icon that allows the player to revisit any binocucom conversations, tips from Bentley, or PA messages from the Fiendish Five members is removed in the PS Vita version, as that function has now been assigned to the touch screen. Some of the glitches (mostly speed-running ones) were fixed. The music for \"Muggshot's Turf\" has been sped up. When entering the \"At the Dog Track\" mission, it first plays the same music that is heard when Sly confronts Muggshot in the boss mission. It then plays the original music once the race begins. In the PS3 version of the game, the music that plays during the prologue has been changed. The alternate music that plays once Sly sneaks past the water tower is no longer triggered; the original starting music is heard throughout the entire job. The Japanese version has every dialogue re-recorded from the ground up, which the voice actors for Sly, Bentley, Murray, Carmelita and the Panda King are taking over. However, some Japanese voice actors were changed for others. Sly 2 PS3\n\nVita PS3/ Vita: The player can now invert the game's camera controls. Only the bonus videos for \"The Black Chateau\" (Sly Cooper: The Second Season) and \"Anatomy for Disaster\" (the credits) are available to watch from the level select screen. The cutscene that plays after defeating Dimitri doesn't show the team playing cards in Monaco. Instead, the Cooper Van drives in place while Sly's audio continues, though he doesn't mention Monaco anymore. This was probably changed, because the games had to be ESRB rated again and it was most likely requested to remove this scene to lower the rating. A different sound is heard when selecting the second through eighth episodes and the movie option from the Episode Select Screen. This doesn't apply to Episode 1 for some reason. The level reset glitch in \"Menace from the North, eh!\" was fixed. The first few seconds of each level's soundtracks are cut off each time they are played the first go-around. This includes all soundtracks except the intro level, as well as alternative soundtracks for boss battles or other missions. The player can no longer use the USB Headset feature to distract the guards. For the PS Vita version, Kevin Miller and Matt Olsen had to re-voice the waypoint & binocucom controls to \"tap the rear touch pad to bring up the waypoint\" and \"tap the touch screen to bring up the binocucom.\" This is also the reason the amount of buttons used for the power-ups has lowered for the PS Vita version, so the player can use only the L button for one power-up at a time. In the digital version of the game, at the start of the dialogue, it is quiet, gets louder, and then the volume decreases again at the end of a line. Sly's portrait in the Gadget Grid is different. It uses the same portrait as the one in Sly 3. When recon photos are taken, they take up the entire screen instead of zooming out. The Sly logo that appears while the game is loading is missing. The Sony Computer Entertainment presents screen uses a different font. The in-game dialogue is slightly delayed on the physical PS3 version of the game. This problem does not occur in the digital or PS Vita versions. The background music will also occasionally loop when the character dialogue delay occurs. Some of the menus and screen effects do not fill up the entire screen. This doesn't happen when playing the game in the original 4:3 display mode (such as with an older TV). Most of the UI is fixed in the physical northern European version. Some menu sound effects are quite different, mainly the ones which play when, for example, manually saving the game. The \"transition\" sound effect that plays when entering or exiting a level is also slightly different. During \"Operation: Thunder Beak,\" when Bentley enters the water tower in the original PS2 version of the game, there is a transition where the image smoothly flips upside down before Bentley appears in the tower. However, in this remaster, the transition doesn't work as intended, flipping the entire image in a single frame before cutting to the interior of the water tower. The Japanese version has every dialogue re-recorded from the ground up, which the voice actors for Sly, Bentley, Murray, Carmelita and the Panda King are taking over. However, some Japanese voice actors were changed for others. Sly 3 PS3\n\nVita PS3/ Vita: The few missions that supported 3-D no longer ask the player if they want to enable 3-D because the entire collection on PS3 is 3-D compatible (but despite this, the cutscenes that play before that menu popped up are still there). The Vita does not support either version of 3-D. The music glitch in the \"Hungry Croc\" mission was fixed. In the original, the music never played. Though some of the PS2 versions (most likely the PAL versions) had the music played correctly. In the multiplayer game \"Biplane Duel,\" the green-orange targeting beacon doesn't appear to be locked on to the person when using special items. However, it is only a visual glitch.When starting the game, there is a chance a random bug will happen where the music will begin looping five seconds of the audio, and the cutscene dialogue will take several minutes to load the dialogue, with characters freezing mid-speech and looping until the game catches up. A way to fix this is simply powering the system off and restarting the system, but there have been reports of people being unable to fix the problem without deleting their data, and some who have been unable to fix it at all, indicating that it is potentially an error on the disk itself. During the \"Beauty and the Beast\" mission, the music for the fight between Carmelita and Mugshot doesn't play. Additionally, after the mission is over, the rest of the game won't play any music unless the player restarts the game, dies, or use Bentley's Grapple-Cam. European Sly fans can finally watch The Evolution of Sly video without having to look it up on the internet, as every bonus video is now accessible. When Sly first meets Dimitri in \"Police HQ,\" players can clearly see him even when his back is turned. This is because the HD port has a different rendering, which causes the lightning to be much more clear. Characters count much faster when opening a double button security door. For the PS Vita version, Kevin Miller and Matt Olsen had to re-voice the waypoint & binocucom controls, as you have to tap the rear touch pad to bring up the waypoint and tap the touch screen to bring up the binocucom. This is also the reason the number of buttons used for the power-ups has lowered for the PS Vita version, so the player can only the L button for one power-up at a time. In the PS Vita version, you can use the motion sensors of the PS Vita system to steer the galleon in \"Dead Men Tell No Tales,\" though it is never mentioned in-game. As in Sly 2: recon photos now take up the entire screen. the Sly logo that appears while the game is loading is missing.the Sony Computer Entertainment presents screen uses a different font. the in-game dialogue is slightly delayed on the physical PS3 version of the game. This problem does not occur in the digital or PS Vita versions. The background music will also occasionally loop when the character dialogue delay occurs. As in Sly 2, some of the menus and screen effects (particularly The Guru's hypnosis) don't fill up the entire screen. Also, it is mostly fixed in the physical northern European version. Murray's bounce height was drastically decreased. This is only seen in the PSVita release, but In the \"Dark Caves\" mission, when exploring the second cave, the lighting is different. The Vita version does not support any of the two-player minigames. The entire game is not available on the physical release of the PS Vita version and is instead only available via digital download. Tales of The Abyss 3DS 3DS: Loading times are shortened. Slightly more lag sometimes. Removal of Multiplayer. Some stats were changed for difficulties some of NA exclusive mystic arts were added to the Japanese version (Japan only). Only four save slots per game card. Some sidequest cut-offs have been altered. No world map glitch (can't keep Asch in party). Tekken 5 PS3\n\nPSP PSP/PS3: Titled \"Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection\". Changed Intro. More Balanced Gameplay. added moves. the Arcade Battle has been upgraded by adding twelve more ranking titles and removing one: Conqueror.\n\nmany new stages. These stages were actually modified versions of the originals that contained different textures, details, and stage music that make most of them unrecognizable. In the PSP version, there is a new mode called \"Tekken Dojo\".\n\nYakuza 1,2 PC\n\nPS3/4\n\nWiiU PS3: HD Remake \"Yakuza Kiwami\" (Japan Only).\n\nPS4/Xbox One/PC: HD Remake titled \"Yakuza Kiwami\" and \"Yakuza Kiwami 2\".\n\nWiiU: HD Remake (Japan Only).\n\nZone of the Enders Xbox 360\n\nPS3 Xbox 360 and PS3 version 1.0 suffer from heavy performance issues, PS3 version 2.0 fixed the performance issue and is considered to be the best version. Zone of the Enders: The Second Runner PC\n\nPS3/4\n\nXbox 360 PS2 (Japan, PAL): Has exclusive content such as new cutscenes, new battles during the campaign, new difficulty modes, more Extra Missions, and more Positive and Negative responses\n\n(Whenever anyone talks to the player, The player can respond to it with the L3 or R3 buttons. Some answers can give the player extra challenge or other little things.)\n\nPS3/360: Based on the PS2 PAL version of the game. Higher quality FMV. Xbox 360 and PS3 version 1.0 suffer from heavy performance issues, PS3 version 2.0 fixed the performance issue. Xbox 360 is also backwards compatible on Xbox One/Series.\n\nPC/PS4: A remaster with updated textures, 4K support, a new but optional control style, various graphics settings on PC, some quality-of-life tweaks, and the ability to play in VR from the view of the cockpit. However, positive and negative responses seem to only work correctly in the middle of a dialogue, and it does not feature dual-audio language support due to licensing restrictions but a mod exists for the PC version."
