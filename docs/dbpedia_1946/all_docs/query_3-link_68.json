        "text": "Gamecube looks great, stepping away from the time period it belongs. Almost all the heavy hitters have aged gracefully, or gotten better over time. Even for a Nintendo console, it's got unique titles. E.G Gamecube has Thousand Year Door, Prime 1&2, Pikmin 1&2. These are standout games with experiences you just can't get anywhere, even today. Thats the main reason why people like it. Simply has expertly crafted experiences that just don't exist outside it. Also, GCN was just in wrong place at the wrong time. People were desperate for Video Games to \"grow up\". Nintendo didn't care and made Wind Waker. People can now, finally, really appreciate this. Worth noting that Mario and Zelda are also not the standout titles for it either, unlike other consoles. So it's not immediately obvious what is super appealing about the GameCube.\n\nTho, it lacked titles for you to be stuck with it for 5 years, people are realizing that they missed out on a generation of amazing experiences that never translated fully into Nintendo's other consoles. So it's gonna get viewed as a hidden secret that makes you look cool to say it's the best ever. IMO Switch and SNES are better, for sure. Maybe it could take third. NES is trash (too old), and N64, Wii, Wii U suffered similar problems from GCN but subjectively could be placed in any order IMO.\n\nIMO:\n\nSwitch > SNES > Wii > GCN > Wii U > NES\n\n(Obviously I'm too young to appreciate what NES was)\n\nBut looking back, I think I might have a theory as to why the GameCube is looked upon more fondly today: The GameCube's top games might actually stand the test of time better than the most popular PS2 and Xbox games of that era. PS2-era hits like GTA San Andreas, Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3, or various sports simulators, look and play obsolete these days. Fans may still like them, but it's clear modern standards have moved on. The sports sims in particular have simply been supplanted by modern versions (notable exceptions being Tony Hawk, SSX, and NBA Street). Melee on the other hand is still stubbornly popular today. Wind Waker, Mario Sunshine, and Metroid Prime look and play today about as attractively as they did 15-plus years ago. I would say Halo Combat Evolved and Halo 2 are also still similarly beloved today though. This is an advantage of Nintendo's refusal to chase bleeding-edge blockbuster game trends and realistic graphics. Nintendo's games overall have probably aged better than those of almost any other publisher.\n\nI can't do a pound-for-pound counting right now, but it's possible that compared to the PS2 and original Xbox, the GameCube has a higher proportion of games that are still good in 2020. Though the PS2 probably still has enough if you dig deeply enough into its massive library.\n\nIf you were to ask me for a \"best Nintendo console\" though, I'd probably give you the SNES, maybe the original DS if you include the GBA's library, or the 3DS if you include the DS's library.\n\nTo flip this argument around a little bit (though I 90% agree with you) I think the value of the GCN now is that a lot of its best games appeal really highly to this type of enthusiast audience. Like, they're critical darlings pushing the gameplay aspect to the limits of what was achievable at the time, even if that meant they lost some of the mainstream appeal. The GCN is full of games which were reviewed and received very highly by their respective fanbases but had very low sales because they lacked the crossover appeal of something like Halo or the sports games. The two closest games to achieve this were probably Metroid Prime and Resident Evil 4, and even Metroid games rely on their critical favor over pure sales numbers.\n\nConversely, Nintendo's heaviest hitters - Super Mario, Zelda, Mario Kart - were criticized for various breaks from tradition at the time they were released, and contributed to Nintendo's \"kiddie\" image. I know these games are highly touted now, especially Wind Waker, but it wasn't like that when they were first released. This is anecdotal, but a close friend of mine and I fought constantly over whether PS2 or GCN was the better system, with Wind Waker as the centerpiece of his argument against me (in reality, it just meant that we got to play the best games on both systems, so in retrospect a win!)\n\nAnyway, I think the DVD player on the PS2 was instrumental in expanding the market, and opening up a space for Nintendo to expand their own sales with the Wii and Wii Sports - so Nintendo was, at the time, still focusing on the market they knew already (ever-shrinking, having lost RPG makers to PSX/PS2). So even though there's likely a higher number of still-good-today PS2 games, the concentration of very good stuff on GCN has a stronger impact today.\n\nI think the GC is my favourite Nintendo console. But that's with the gameboy adapter, broadband adapter and 3rd party screen that clips on... Basically a 20 year old proto wii u. But like the wii U I don't play it at all now.\n\nAt the time nintendo didn't want to pay the licence fee for DVD, it killed a large amount of appeal for the gamecube, my brother got a ps2 because of the dvd functionality, as did a number of my friends. The only gamecube (and Xbox) owner I knew of in my area was... me. Because I already had a dvd player.\n\nAdd in the handle and bright colour design and yeah, that's a kiddie console, it might have resi, etc. But at it's heart nintendo wanted a child friendly console. 20 years ago, black was the only \"real\" colour for gaming consoles.\n\nThe dry spells between releases compared to ps2 and xbox didn't help either. The history of nintendos heavy handedness with developers contributed to this too.\n\nAll in all, nintendo made bad choices and cut corners that harmed it, even though the underlying hardware was great for the time.\n\nThe Gamecube just edges the PS2 for me in terms of being my favorite console of that generation.\n\nThe first party output was stellar despite them often not being well received at the time.\n\nLuigi's Mansion\n\nWave Race Blue Storm is still the only jetski game I go back to. The dynamic weather and handling is still incredible.\n\nPikmin 1/2\n\nSmash Melee\n\nEternal Darkness\n\nAnimal Crossing\n\nMario Sunshine\n\nDonkey Kong Jungle Beat\n\nWind Waker / Twilight Princess / Four Swords Adventures\n\nF-Zero GX\n\nall the Metroid Prime games\n\nMario Kart Double Dash!!\n\nPaper Mario TTYD\n\nMario Strikers\n\nFire Emblem Path of Radiance\n\nPac Man Vs. (yes, me and my friends broke out our GBAs and link cables)\n\nHell, I even love how stupid MGS: The Twin Snakes is, even if I think the original is a better game. Battalion Wars is another one that I think is a hidden gem, even if I get why some might not like it.\n\nA lot of these games are among my favorite games in their respective series, and several are among my favorite of all time.\n\nThe PS2 third-party output was incredible, but again, a lot of my favorite third-party games of that era were all Gamecube exclusive or Gamecube first.\n\nSuper Monkey Ball 1/2\n\nREmake / RE4 (hell even RE0 which was subpar was fun, and getting the best versions of the rest of the RE series was also great)\n\nP.N.03\n\nViewtiful Joe 1/2\n\nKiller 7\n\ngreat ports/updates of some of my favorite DC games:\n\nSkies of Arcadia\n\nIkaruga\n\nmy favorite versions of\n\nBeyond Good and Evil\n\nPrince of Persia Sands of Time\n\nSoul Calibur II\n\nTales of Symphonia might be the only Tales game I love\n\nmy favorite version of Soul Calibur II\n\nthe Rogue Leader games from Factor 5\n\nTimesplitters 2 / Future Perfect\n\nBaten Kaitos 1 / 2\n\nLost Kingdoms 1 / 2\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles (yup, we played this with our GBAs too)\n\nPhantasy Star Online 1/2 (I played this with friends in 4-player split screen for ages\n\nAnd as someone who has always loved playing portable games on a TV, the GBA library via the Game Boy Player was incredible. I went so far as to import it just to get it a few months early. If I started listing all the games I remember playing through on the GB Player I'll be here all night.\n\nI definitely own more PS2 games than Gamecube ones, but the Gamecube games are the ones I've gone back to revisit over and over since the end of that generation. I understand why that's not the case for a lot of people, but it certainly is for me."
