        "text": "By request here is my rider report for the Strida Evo\n\nSome observations Total real bike weight: 13.3kg (including 33cl of water)\n\nMy modifications\n\nnew saddle, grips and tyres.\n\nI have added extra weight added by the Brooks flyer special at 810grams, stock saddle although comfortable it doesn’t match the comfort of a Brooks saddle that really moulds to your shape.\n\nMy longest single ride at 32kms was a pleasant experience and easily completed.\n\nI used the middle gear ratio (100%) most of the time, for hills the first gear at (78.7%) has been very well conceived and very effective. Riding on the flat the (125.7%) really makes this bike faster than a 3 speed Brompton (thanks to a good friend and Brompton owner).\n\nMy normal commute at 5 miles in London traffic (8.04kms) has reduced by nearly 5 minutes using the SX to 25 minutes, so average speed on the Evo 19.3kmh up from (16.09kmh on the SX).\n\nI have just fitted Schwalbe Kojak and dropped the Innova stock tyres as these faster and lighter and reducing the overall bike total back to 13kg even with the addition of the brooks saddle. So highly recommended but also handling is much better.\n\nThe gears changes smoothly but I did notice the same sensation as highlighted from (keps) when peddling in low and high gears initially but this has dissipated with use so this is down to running the bike in.\n\nThe Evo is an evolution of the Strida design making it fully developed we have all requested and waited for the extra gears so now its here…But I do sometimes miss the simple SX because of the weight, no gears making this a perfect urban bike (Mark Sanders was right) but in this ever changing world we are now working more and faster the Evo reflects this…\n\nMy negatives for the Evo is the extra weight which is a trade off of the gears, and changing my riding style. Now at stops and red lights I would always lead off on the right side peddle by braking and peddling backwards to position myself for when the light turns green…of course with the Evo it changes the gears so I have occasionally tried to peddle off in the high gear!!\n\nOverall the Evo is highly recommended what should Ming do to develop the model…? my vote is for making it lighter…anyone else???\n\nI have just purchased an Evo whilst in Sydney (Oz). 18\" wheels made this little beastie fly, but as these are not readily obtainable in NZ, have swapped out the wheels for the resin/aluminium ones.\n\nI have now done a couple of return trips to work. My commute is about 8km, so not very long. The justification for the strida for me was the upright riding position, which I find more comfy than my Speciailized Expedition semi-cruiser(which has just appeared on trade me as a result). I would not have considered the Strida but for purchasing a 3.3 earlier this year, and loving it. The Evo is quite an evolution. When I place them side-by-side, the extra gusset reinforcing the steering head is the first obvious difference, then the beefed up seating mount, and of course the freewheel/gears. The Evo seems a little sudden in the braking after the drums, but I am getting to prefer it over the drums now, after only a few days. I have the bent bars, which is a real improvement for my legroom. So far, quite intoxicated with this brushed aluminium machine!"
