        "text": "Hi, looking for some cheap road tyres for a 25 mile road ride at end of May. Its for charidee pop pickers. Will also be used for hard pack fire road type stuff as we have a few routes here in sunny Norfolk.\n\nI have Alex rims EN24 with 26x2.25 nobby nics and find them pretty good off road, but really draggy on tarmac. Trying to build up my fitness at the moment and did a 30k ride other day which nearly killed me.\n\nBeen looking at the city jets as seen them mentioned a few times on here and are cheap. Currently £10.50 at halfords with another 20% off. My question really is what size to get, 1.5 or 1.9 ? Will the 1.5 even fit on my rims?\n\nIs there much difference in comfort, rolling resistance between them? Also any other tyres I should look at?\n\n0\n\nI have the 1.95 City Jets, and they are absolutely brilliant. Wont ever have to worry about a puncture. Rolling resistance is great. And they are really good at absorbing bumps.\n\nJust watch out on fireroads if its quite loose, had a really unexpected moment when cornering and braking quite gently with the rear. It locked but didnt \"unlock\" when i released the brake like most tyres would.\n\n0\n\nRolling resistance is good, not great, it's worse than any of the tyres I've had on my commuter and they feel a bit 'dead' by comparison as well, they are good tyres and excellent value for money, but not great.\n\nAlways worth keeping an eye out, I got my mate some Conti sport contacts for £15 delivered, used but as new.\n\nCurrently riding a Whyte T130C, X0 drivetrain, Magura Trail brakes converted to mixed wheel size (homebuilt wheels) with 140mm Fox 34 Rhythm and RP23 suspension. 12.2Kg.\n\n0\n\nThey have a pretty stiff construction compared to others, maybe thats the reason behind the deadness. I never found them to be dead myself.\n\nYeah they arent the best, nowhere near to my 1.4 michelins, but then again they are 1.4 There isnt actually a great deal of difference between CJs and Maxxis Aspens on the road. If i could get these michelins in 1.95 like the CJ or just bigger in general, id buy them in a heartbeat. http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/mich ... lsrc=aw.ds\n\nLove them and i only use the standard wire bead ones at 420 grams. there are some \"advanced\" ones. Bloody 200 grams! http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/mich ... lsrc=aw.ds Id get these next if i ever need a road tyre again.\n\n0\n\nI've run 26x1.5\" as\n\nPanaracer RiBMo, Continental Sport Contact, WTB Slickasurus and Specialized Nimbus on my Commuter and my daughter had the CJ's on her commuter so I have a reasonable basis for comparison of similar tyres, the CJ is the slowest rolling and the RiBMo the fastest, the Nimbus doesn't quite have the grip of the others in the wet which is why the set I have are now on my town hack bike which doesn't get used at higher speeds much nor in the wet as much. That said the CJ can be had for less than half the price of the others making it a winner on value unless you find a good deal. On my commuter I usually run 80psi rear and 70psi front (increasing pressure all the way to the max in steps I found it gave lowest rolling resistance when tested on a downhill roll from stationary to 20mph), the town hack bike uses about 65psi to get some grip back.\n\nI used to have some wider slicks and above 15-16mph the lower aero drag of the narrower tyres is noticeable, the narrower tyres are also lighter and accelerate faster.\n\nCurrently riding a Whyte T130C, X0 drivetrain, Magura Trail brakes converted to mixed wheel size (homebuilt wheels) with 140mm Fox 34 Rhythm and RP23 suspension. 12.2Kg.\n\n0\n\nThanks for the advice. Just to throw a spanner in the works, the more I think about it I think I might be better going for a semi slick for more off road ability and a faster rolling summer tyre. So a mixture of road, fire road/dirt paths and off road. Nearest trail centre is Thetford so quite dry in the summer.\n\nSchwalbe land cruisers seem to be a good budget option, get good reviews but heavy.\n\nhttp://www.chainreactioncycles.com/schw ... nt=Default\n\nOr seen some Continental travel contacts, more expensive but lighter. Don't mind spending a bit more for a good summer tyre that rolls easier on tarmac than my nobby nics(performance line)\n\n0\n\nOf those, yes, the one I have left to try is a narrow Schwalbe Kojak but at circa 1000 miles a year it takes a while, even bought used the WTB's (a rebadged Maxxis) lasted over 3000miles on the rear and nearly 4000 on the front.\n\nCurrently riding a Whyte T130C, X0 drivetrain, Magura Trail brakes converted to mixed wheel size (homebuilt wheels) with 140mm Fox 34 Rhythm and RP23 suspension. 12.2Kg.\n\n0\n\nI wouldn't go for Land Cruisers. Had them as my first semi-slicks on my first bike. Reasonably tough but stupidly heavy. Not much use in wet conditions and a bit too sticky on the road.\n\nI gave them away after 3 months to a friend, who then gave them away after a further 2 months. No-one wanted them.\n\n2007 Felt Q720 (the ratbike)\n\n2012 Cube Ltd SL (the hardtail XC 26er)\n\n2014 Lapierre Zesty TR 329 (the full-sus 29er)\n\n0\n\nThe Rookie wrote:\n\nOf those, yes, the one I have left to try is a narrow Schwalbe Kojak but at circa 1000 miles a year it takes a while, even bought used the WTB's (a rebadged Maxxis) lasted over 3000miles on the rear and nearly 4000 on the front.\n\nDon't bother. They are OK but lack any real puncture protection and, if you do any serious mileage, tend to square off very quickly (soft rubber) compared to Continental Sport Contacts. Been through three sets of Kojaks,. 5 Sport Contacts, 2 Slickasourus and a set of Schwalbe city jets (probably the worst of the bunch) as well a whole bunch of others.\n\nThe Conti Sport Contacts are the best of the bunch, the Kojaks are a little lighter and faster but not very long lasting (and puncture prone) and the City Jets are built like a tank but very, very draggy (that pointed, grooved apex folds under your body weight causing a wider contact patch on the ground which you can't seem to resolve, no matter how much pressure you pump them up to).\n\n0\n\nNot personally, but I know a few who have with no problems.\n\nA bit cheaper but the JT edition - no I don't know the difference to the DTC.\n\nhttp://www.bike-discount.de/en/buy/kend ... wg_id-2970 or they also do the 1.95 for less.\n\nUsed them a few time, excellent service, stereotypically Germanic dare I say!\n\nCurrently riding a Whyte T130C, X0 drivetrain, Magura Trail brakes converted to mixed wheel size (homebuilt wheels) with 140mm Fox 34 Rhythm and RP23 suspension. 12.2Kg.\n\n0\n\nBought my bike from BD and did see them as well. Think they must be the sealant ready tyres going by the weight. Standard tubes is 520g, KCST is about 600g and UST is 850g\n\nhttp://www.kendatire.com/en/bicycle/mtb ... eight-pro/\n\nAlso from what I can find out I think they are all JT editions....or signature series. Newer model (or rebranded packaging, who knows) are either Tomac series or Pro depending on packaging. Look to be the same tyre.\n\nThink i would prefer the 2.1 though for a bit more comfort, might be a bit grippier off road as well\n\n0\n\nJust to let people know Halfords are currently doing the City Jet 26\" x 1.5\" for £7.19 each\n\nJust bought a couple for my new commuter build, at that price even if they're not the best I'm not bothered\n\n__________________\n\n\"I keep getting eureaka moments ... followed very quickly by embarrassment when someone points out I'm a plank\"\n\nScott Genius MC 30 RIP\n\nNukeproof Mega AM 275 Comp\n\nCube LTD Rigid Commuter\n\nRibble 7005 Sportive\n\n0\n\nQuick update\n\nJust ordered 2 small block eights off nexdaytyres which had the correct part number (212511). Now showing as out of stock after I ordered so will see if they actually turn up and if they are infact the correct version.\n\nTried emailing 2 different shops (1 very well known) about which version they actually stock and getting no replys after 2 days. Not unheard of I know but bit the bullet now and fingers crossed they turn up.\n\nAlot of places seem to be out of stock in various sizes so are either selling like hot cakes now weather has turned or everyone is awating stock\n\n0"
