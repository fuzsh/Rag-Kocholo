        "text": "Introducing the #Aratek-A900, proudly imported and distributed by Asterion Technologies cc. The Aratek A900 is an FBI Appendix F FAP 60-certified and MOSIP-compliant 4-4-2 live-scan fingerprint scanner, designed to tackle the most demanding and extensive tasks. This portable unit is housed in an IP65-rated enclosure, making it impervious to dust and moisture, and perfect for all fingerprint applications, even in harsh environments. The comprehensive SDK available for the A900 live scan equipment supports sequence checking, NFIQ fingerprint image quality checks, and slap fingerprint segmentation. The A900 is the ultimate fingerprint device for various applications including National ID, Voter Registration, Finance & Banking, Census, Law Enforcement, e-Passport, and VISA. Contact Asterion Technologies @ connect@asterion-technologies.com to find out more about the Aratek Biometrics range of devices. #nationalid #Voterregistration #Financeandbanking #Census #Lawenforcement #epassport #Visa #biometric\n\nCurious about what sets Trust Stamp's Stable IT2 apart? Our Chief Commercial Officer, Kinny Chan, breaks it down for you: 🔍 What is Stable IT2? 🔑 What's the key technological innovation behind it? 🔄 How does it differ from current biometric systems? 💡 And what are the benefits for users who integrate it into their devices? 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲! 👇 #biometricauthentication #biometricsecurity #biometrics #technology #innovation\n\nIn case you missed it last week, here is part 1 of our new short format publication series dedicated to technologies that are instrumental in our goal of keeping Europe open and #secure. Our first 'Technology Brief' delves into biometric recognition, providing an overview of the technology, its benefits, limitations, accuracy, and applications. #biometrics #ASaferEurope #technology\n\nMaureen is right about the rise of mobile and biometrics, and how students always have their phones. What they also always have, even if they forget everything else, or it's too risky to use your phone to summon help, is their voice. #Voiceauthentication and #speechrecognition -- multifactor/multimodal authentication in a single utterance.\n\n🇩🇪 🆔 Lessons learned from the \"Showcase Program Secure #DigitalIdentities\" in Germany I. Build new ways on existing roads - There is not the one way for digital identities. Il. Public-Private-Private Partnerships can push the evolvement of innovative solutions that can compete with existing (monopolistic) solutions. III. The most secure and innovative technology is useless if there is no functional business model behind it that can bring the solutions to a broad use. IV. To achieve the above, open dialogue formats between the government/ administration, the civil society and businesses are essential, esp. to create trust, acceptance and transparency. Germany's consultation process can be a best practice for other nations.

Book a demo of #SPECTRA, our #LawEnforcement solution: https://lnkd.in/ewFarCT7 SPECTRA is a #software that uses OPPSCIENCE’s #IAM cutting-edge technology. It fuses #data of any type, size, source, and format while preserving the integrity of its information. It not only enables secured access to #centralized #information but correlates the information under the same context. It generates real-time #intelligence and uses automated features to prioritize its relevancy within the needed context (defined by the end-user), and the information is available in different #visualizations (mapping, graph, timeline, relationships, 360° profile…) to make the #decision-#making process much more #efficient. #MilipolParis2023 #MilipolParis #Milipol2023 #intelligenceanalysismanagement"
