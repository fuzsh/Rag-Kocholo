This recording led to H.R. winning a down beat Guitar - New Star award in The Third Annual Jazz Critics Poll in 1955 ( The Critics Choices, down beat, Aug. 24, 1955, p.10 ). This recording together with some recordings made with Jim Hall in 1956 have been released on CD Fresh Sound FSR-CD 471 in 2007. This recording is discussed in the book Bassically Speaking: An Oral History of George Duvivier, by Edward Berger, Studies in Jazz No. 17, Institute of Jazz Studies, Rutgers, 1993. On page 169 Duvivier is quoted as saying\n\n\"That same year 1956, I did a very challenging recording with Chico Hamilton. We were both working with Lena Horne in Los Angeles when Dick Bock of Pacific Jazz approached us to a trio album with Jim Hall. ... Chico and I both wrote some originals and Jimmy Cheatham, the trombonist brought in a thing of his called Nuttye. We concentrated on making each track completely different. The guitar parts were awesome. Howard Roberts, who subbed for Jim Hall in places, came in and sight-read those things!\"\n\nAlthough, Duvivier (who organized the session together with Chico Hamilton) indicated that it was supposed to be a session with Jim Hall, there is no explanation for how tracks made with H.R. in 1953 wound up on the record. (Many thanks to Mike Kremer and to Adrian Pellew for helping to straighten out some details.)\n\nThe Chico Hamilton Trio\n\n1956 - Pacific Jazz.\n\nSelections: Blues On the Rocks (G.

In particular, Jim Hall is on Blues On The Rocks, Autumn Landscape, and Porch Light and neither guitarist plays on Skinned Strings. Many thanks to Dave Gould for this (see above under Jazz Studio Two) and to Mike Kremer and Adrain Pellew for helping me sort out who played on what.\n\n3 Roads to Jazz\n\n1956 American Recording Atrists ALP-100.\n\nSelections: Top O' the Mark (Jerry Vaughn).\n\nPersonnel: leader - Jerry Vaughn, accordion - Marty Paich, alto sax - Herb Geller, drums - Chico Hamilton, guitar - Howard Roberts, bass - Bob Enevoldsen.\n\nSession: L.A., January, 1956.\n\nComments: H.R. as a part of the Jerry Vaughn Quintet doing one song.

This was also issued as Art Pepper/Buddy DeFranco Sessions, Live, and contains sessions from the same television show by Art Pepper (with Russ Freeman). The album cover only identifies H.R. as backing Lucy Ann Polk. Another discography lists the guitar and piano players on the Buddy DeFranco tracks as being Tal Farlow and Sonny Clark, respectively. This seems unlikely, however, as the guitarist sounds like H.R. and all these tracks are from the same television show. The tracks with Buddy DeFranco have been reissued on a Buddy DeFranco CD called Wailers. This CD contains the tracks of the original album (with Barney Kessel on guitar) together with 3 bonus tracks from the TV show which again make the mistake of crediting Tal Farlow as being on guitar. Interestingly the third track is a great version of Now's the Time and the guitar playing is very characteristic of H.R. at this time. Many thanks to Mitch Seidman for telling me about the Wailers CD.\n\nBenny Carter Quartet and Quintet Take The \"A\" Train\n\n1957 - issued on Fresh Sound FSR-CD 306 in 1997.\n\nSelections with H.R.: Take The \"A\" Train (Strayhorn), Laura (D.

June, July 1957.\n\nCommnets: The guitarist on these selections is identified as \"John Doe\" while the guitarist on other selections is identified as Howard Lucraft. The Lord Discography identifies John Doe as H.R. and I definitely agree. Beautiful playing by H.R. and very typical of this period in his playing.\n\nBilly Daniels - You Go To My Head\n\n1957 - Verve MGV2072.\n\nSelections with H.R.: Blue Skies (I.

No personnel are listed on this record. Generally nice recording with a great H.R. solo on My Shining Hour.\n\nTeach Me Tonight - The de Castro Sisters\n\n1957 - released on BCD 16381 (Bear Company) in 1999\n\nSelections with H.R.: That Little Word Called Love (Colman), Old Timer's Tune (Raye-Dennis).\n\nPersonnel: vocals - Peggy, Cherie and Babette de Castro, guitar - Jack Marshall, Bob Bain, Howard Roberts, piano - Herbert Dell, bass - Red Callender, drums - Irving Cottler, clarinet - Ted Nash, trombone - Milt Bernhart, trumpet - Ray Linn.\n\nSession: Aug. 17 1957, Radio Recorders Annex, Hollywood.\n\nComments: Sounds like Jack Marshall on the solos.\n\nHerbie Harper/6\n\n1957 - Mode - released in 1995 on V.S.O.P.\n\nSelections: Jay's Tune (J.

That album credits H.R. as being on Summit Ridge Drive while this album credits him with this tune plus the medley Dancing in the Dark, Moonglow and Time on my Hands and also Indian Love Call. The guitar on all the remaining tracks is credited to Barney Kessel.

Jack Kane was from Toronto and graduated with a degree in Music from the University of Toronto. He was well-known in Canada during the late 50's as he had a popular show on the CBC called the Music Makers. Some of this is documented in They Loved to Play, Memories of the Golden Age in Canadian Music by Murray Ginsberg, Eastend Books, 1998 which discusses the history of the Canadian music industry. Kane went to work as a music director for a Edie Gorme-Steve Lawrence television show which is when this recording was made. He died quite young in 1961. The Jack Kane composition The Sound of the Blues is particularly good. I got this recording on tape from the National Library of Canada with the kind permission of Universal Music.\n\nAllan Kane, the son of Jack Kane, supplied me with the information that this recording was nominated for a Grammy in 1958 in the category Best Orchestra Performance.\n\nMerrill Moore - Boogie My Blues Away\n\n1958 - only issued in 1990 on Bear Family Records as a double CD.\n\nSelections: South, Sentimental Journey, Shanty In Old Shanty Town, Sweet Georgia Brown, Moore Blues, Nobody's Sweetheart, Jumpin' At The Woodside, Somebody Stole My Gal, Lazy River.\n\nPersonnel: piano - Merrill Moore, guitar - Howard Roberts, bass - Morty Korb, drums - Ted Kovar.\n\nComments: I've only listed the selections where Howard Roberts plays.\n\nClaude Williamson mulls the Mulligan with his twin Jazz Pianos and Trio\n\n1958 - Fresh Sound Records FSR-CD 54.\n\nSelections : All compositions by Gerry Mulligan.
