        "text": "Wayne Shorter. 2006. Photo credit: Tom Beetz.\n\nWhen most jazz fans think of Wayne Shorter, they are likely to conjure up one or more of his Blue Note albums (e.g., Juju), and/or one or more of his Miles Davis albums (e.g., Miles Smiles), and/or one or more of his Weather Report albums (e.g., Heavy Weather). My first thoughts, however, run to Native Dancer, that hybridized, outlier collaboration with musicians from Brazil. When the LP came out in 1975, I bought six copies and gave five to friends—I loved it that much.\n\nWayne had featured several Brazilian rhythm tracks on previous albums. Still, as Shorter biographer Michelle Mercer wrote,\n\nNo one was prepared for the deeply affecting sound of Wayne’s Native Dancer recording. It was unlike any Brazilian music most Americans had ever heard. The record’s first few notes introduced a voice, one that had to be the most potent falsetto on the planet [belonging] to Brazilian pop star and composer Milton Nascimento [to which] Wayne married jazz to Milton’s melodies in a kind of holy union that made other Brazilian jazz efforts of the time [Jazz Samba, Getz /Gilberto] seem like one-night stands. (1)\n\nHaving first learned of Nascimento from jazz pianist Herbie Hancock, Wayne covered one of the singer/songwriter’s tunes on a Blue Note album in 1970. Inevitability, one often realizes, dictated a shared recording date. With his Portugese wife Ana Maria’s encouragement, Wayne arranged to have Milton and two musical associates stay at his house in Malibu where they lived, and worked for two weeks, going to the studio to record Native Dancer on September 12, 1974.\n\nShorter recognized that if you have a one-of-a-kind singer, one who had assimilated the bossa nova of his fellow countrymen, along with the Gregorian chants of his remote Catholic church in the hinterlands, into a self-styled alto yodel (some called it) or his female voice (Milton called it), then a hybrid album—not a jazz album, not a Brazilian album—but a hybrid should be made. And that’s what Wayne did.\n\nAlong with him and Herbie Hancock, there were three Brazilians:\n\nMilton, Wagner [Tiso], and Robertinho [Silva]. There were also two players from the pop scene, Dave McDaniel, a bassist with Joe Cocker, and Jay Graydon, a guitarist, producer, and songwriter. There was Dave Amaro, [Brazilian singer] Flora Purim’s guitarist, on a couple of tunes, and [husband, percussionist] Airto [Moreira] on most of them. The engineer was Rob Fabroni, who had worked with The Band and other rock groups. And finally, Jim Price, a multi-instrumentalist who had worked with the Rolling Stones, produced the record. (2)\n\nThe album opens with “Ponta De Areia,” a singsong, nursery school melody over an unusual 9/8-meter sung by Milton in his liquid, instrumental-like wordless falsetto voice. Heard underneath is a shadow piano melody by Herbie. The other singer on the date, Wayne, enters smoothly on his soprano saxophone, repeating the childlike melody before he joins Milton in a duet. “Ponta” ends as it begins except for Waynish obligatos underneath.\n\nPerhaps fearing the first-track exotica might be a bit much for first-time listeners, Wayne follows “Ponta” with his own composition, “Beauty and the Beast.” A solid toe-tapper that begins with hesitant, funky block chords by Herbie that segues into a strong, melodic statement by Wayne, then alternates back and forth between the two as the tune continues; ostensibly one is “Beauty,” the other, Beast.” At song’s end they are one in the same.\n\nNascimento sings “Tarde” clearly, softly, yet another display of his tremendous vocal range. For this luxurious mood piece, Wayne pulls out his first instrument—tenor sax—and plays a romantic solo over a Hammond organ cushion. Milton reenters with a sweeping, wordless falsetto behind Wayne’s tenor excursions, pauses for a spell, then returns with an even higher-pitched falsetto.\n\nHancock later remarked, “After Wayne soloed, when Milton would come back in, you couldn’t even tell it was a voice. Because when Wayne played, it sang, and Milton’s singing has an instrumental quality to it.” (3)\n\nMilton begins “Miracle of the Fishes” wordlessly, wailing away, then slips in some lyrics along with the wail as Wayne, on tenor again, joins in with gusto. The free-spirited pair soar off together, not so much as an energetic vocal/sax duo, but more like a saxophone cutting contest that might take place on the fringes of avant jazz. The backup musicians (organ, guitar, drums, percussion) are exceptional in this unrestrained, up-tempo romp.\n\nShorter is back on soprano for the lovely ballad “Diana,” named for the newborn daughter of Flora Purim and Airto, ably supported by pianist Hancock.\n\nNascimento wrongly titled “From the Lonely Afternoons”—should have been “Lovely” or “Happy.” The singer-songwriter sails a wordless vocal over the band’s jumping, finger-snapping groove that compels Wayne on tenor to spread a Coltraneish flurry of notes over the head-bobbing musical stew. At the close, other voices (members of the band?) join Milton before Wayne declares “Good Afternoon.”\n\n​\n\nCritic Howard Mandel, who awarded Native Dancer five stars in DownBeat magazine, was especially enamored by the saxist’s homage to his wife “Ana Maria,” writing, \"A lovely line is offered again and again with the slightest embellishment, gradually blossoming into a large, encompassing circle that Hancock laces with sweeping and graceful runs.” (4)\n\nAs revealed by Shorter biographer Mercer:\n\nMilton sang “Lilia” with wordless vocals [as he did on several others], which was for him a style born of necessity and perfected under pressure. Under Brazil’s military dictatorship in the sixties and seventies, the ruling regime monitored pop music, censoring anything seemingly rebellious . . . When Milton recorded [an album] in 1973, the censors denied clearance on several of its songs. His record company asked him to write new lyrics. But Milton didn’t want to play the military’s editing game . . . So Milton protested by singing without words, using his voice in an instrumental role. (5)\n\nAnd did he ever on “Lilia.” A trebly “LaLaLaAyeAyeAyeYa-eeea” wail over a bouncy organ-piano-guitar broken 5/4 meter rhythm–his “alto yodel almost indistinguishable from Shorter’s airily ethereal soprano sound, which draws the song to a climax by ringing out one tone against a shifting rhythm bed.” (6) Whew!\n\n​Wayne’s soprano settles into a gentler approach on Hancock’s introspective “Joanna’s Theme,” which closes the album. The four non-Nascimento tunes on the recording—this one, plus “Diana,” “Ana Maria,” and “Beauty and the Beast”—are collectively gorgeous and belong on this intriguing album, largely because of the uncanny similarity between the principal soloists’ voices.\n\nThis album has little precedent (that I can think of). Jazz musicians have worked with vocalists from the very beginning, but mostly in a backup role, and either way, too. Instrumentalists backing up the vocalist, or the opposite, singers backing up the front line instruments. For example, choral groups have backed up trumpeter Donald Byrd, pianist Andrew Hill, and guitarist Kenny Burrell.\n\nAs for the other way around, we can turn to, of course, Duke Ellington and “Creole Love Call,” the Ellington composition best known for its vocal by singer Adelaide Hall. It was the first 100 percent nonverbal scat vocal in jazz. (7) Duke followed up on the use of the human voice as an instrument, especially on “Mood Indigo,” with its famed tri-part opening. In recent times, soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy would often use the voice of wife, Irene Aebi, along with the other frontline instruments.\n\nSimply put, Native Dancer is one of the greatest albums of the late 20th century; and for this alone, Wayne Shorter deserves to be a Kennedy Center honoree.\n\nMichelle Mercer, Footprints: The Life and Work of Wayne Shorter (New York: Jeremy Tarcher/Penquin, 2007), 164.\n\nMercer, Footprints, 169.\n\nMercer, Footprints, 173.\n\nHoward Mandel, Wayne Shorter, Native Dancer review, DownBeat magazine, 1965.\n\nMercer, Footprints, 171.\n\nMandel, Native Dancer Review, DownBeat.\n\nAnn Powers, Good Booty: Love and Sex, Black & White, Body and Soul In American Music (New York: Dey Street Books, 2017), 27.\n\n​\n\nDustin Hoffman (1968), Midnight Cowboy (1969), Jon Voight (1993). Credit: Wikipedia.\n\n​James S. Hirsch opened his Washington Post review of Glenn Frankel’s book Shooting Midnight Cowboy[1] with the following:\n\n​\n\nThe director [John Schlesinger] was an insecure taskmaster whose most recent movie had bombed. The producer [Jerome Hellmann] was a lifelong depressive whose last film had also flopped. The screenwriter [Waldo Salt] was a self-destructive alcoholic, the two lead actors [Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman] relatively untested newcomers. Collectively, they were making a movie based on a bleak novel that had sold poorly and was ignored by critics. That was the most improbable genesis of Midnight Cowboy, the 1969 classic of two outcasts who find heartbreak and hope in the kaleidoscope jungle of New York City. [Improbably,] the film would win the Academy Award for Best Picture and the adoration of legions of fans.[2]\n\n​\n\n​After reading the above, you could easily conclude that Midnight Cowboy was a happy movie accident. Indeed, it was. But what about “Everybody’s Talkin’,” the memorable Grammy-winning theme song not mentioned in Hirsch’s review? Did it come about in an improbable fashion like everything else in the movie? Was “Talkin’” a happy musical accident? Read on.\n\nDirector Schlesinger liked to edit his film dailies to music. From a pile of new albums, he selected Aerial Ballet by obscure LA singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson. One song, “Everybody’s Talkin’,” caught Schlesinger’s ear. An ideal track, he thought, to guide and pace his edits.\n\n​\n\n“Talkin’” was the only cut on the album that hadn’t been written by Nilsson. The song had been authored by yet another obscure singer-songwriter and recorded for his self-named album Fred Neil, interestingly, the last song recorded for the album.[3] This fact foretold a glorious future for the song, albeit unknown to everyone at the time and quite frankly to many even today.\n\n​Turns out, more often than not, the last-recorded track is usually the album’s biggest hit. Think not? Check out these chart-topping caboose hits:\n\nColeman Hawkins “Body and Soul”\n\nFrank Sinatra “I’ve Got You Under My Skin”\n\nDeep Purple “Smoke on the Water”\n\nJerome Kern “Smoke Gets In Your Eyes”\n\nBooker T. and the M. G. “Green Onions”\n\nRupert Homes “The Pina Colada Song”\n\nJohn Lee Hooker “Boogie Chillun”\n\nBill Haley and the Comets “Rock Around the Clock”\n\nEmerson, Lake, and Palmer “Lucky Man”\n\nIn the fall of 1969, “Talkin’” came to Nilsson’s attention from his recording producer at RCA, Rick Jarrard, who had heard it on his car radio while driving to the studio. Rick quickly purchased the Fred Neil album and played it for Harry, who gave it a thumbs-down; he wasn’t about to add someone else’s work to his Aerial Ballet album. Jarrard doubled down and argued vigorously for its inclusion. Harry finally capitulated, as a favor to his record producer.[4]\n\nAs a matter of interest, “Talkin’” was not the first song heard on the radio by a producer that eventually worked its way into a film and subsequent widespread fame. Say hello to “What a Wonderful World” and “Unchained Melody.”[5]\n\nMoreover, talk about serendipity or synchronicity—this very same record producer, Rick Jarrard, working with Jefferson Airplane on their Surrealistic Pillow album, convinced reluctant guitarist Jorma Kaukonen to include his finger-picking acoustic solo “Embryonic Journey” on Airplane’s psychedelic-rock Surrealistic Pillow album. Jorma’s folky “Journey” would be as much a fan favorite as the group’s well-known surreal hits “Someone to Love” and “White Rabbit.”\n\n​“Talkin’” was not a shoe-in to be the picture’s theme song, despite Schlesinger’s intentions. Top-flight artists—Joni Mitchell, Leonard Cohen, Donavan, Bob Dylan—had submitted songs for consideration. Schlesinger stuck by his daily editing song. United Artist objected. They wanted an original song, one they could own and copyright, release as a single, and on the film soundtrack album. Harry Nilsson wanted UA to use a song of his, not one by Fred Neil! Still, the director tenaciously clung to his choice as the main theme and introduction to the film.\n\nAs for United Artists, the matter was finally resolved when producer Hellman and Director Schlesinger showed the nearly finished film to UA executives. Hearing the music as an integral part of the movie did the trick. Ownership rights be damned, what’s perfect is perfect.[6]\n\nAs for the question asked at the outset, “Talkin’” is indeed a happy musical accident, despite director Schlesinger’s unwavering devotion to the rightness of his choice, fighting off all attempts to replace it with something else.\n\nThe song came to him in an accidental fashion. An aide brought him a stack of new albums for him to use in his film-editing process. He selected Aerial Ballet at random and became enamored with its last track. He loved the sweetness of the melody and the wistful rebellious spirit of the lyrics that perfectly aligned with the Joe Buck character played by Jon Voight.\n\nImagine if he had selected any other 1967 release, like Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band or the Monkees' Headquarters or the Grateful Dead or the Moody Blues or Procol Harum or the Who?\n\nHard to imagine anything better than Aerial Ballet’s last track. When contemplating this, keep in mind that in 2004, “Everybody’s Talkin’” was listed number 20 in AFI’s top 100 movie songs of all time!\n\n​​Glenn Frankel, Shooting Midnight Cowboy: Art, Sex, Loneliness, Liberation, and the Making of a Dark Classic (New York: Farrar, Strauss and Giroux, 2021).\n\nJames S.

The best of which, in my opinion, is the highly entertaining Passin’ Thru (2017).\n\nThe album opens with Lloyd’s composition “Dreamweaver,” also recorded by his first quartet. The second quartet’s take is longer (by six minutes) and more complex, as Tom Jurek wrote:\n\n​\"The version commences with a modal, post-Coltrane intro as the saxophonist explores tones and space before the drummer Harland checks into its groove, one that touches on the blues, folk music, a pop-style chorus and gospel before moving off to explore Eastern modalities, post-bop, and (some) dissonances before circling back to its lovely melody.\"\n\n​The following tracks reflect the various genres and styles mentioned above, singularly and collectively.\n\n“Nu Blues” is a be-boppin’ swinger by the Jason Moran Bop Trio. Moran is rollin’ the keys like Bud Powell, Rogers is Ray Brown or Oscar Pettiford walkin’ the bass, and Harland is bebop originator Kenny Clarke keepin’ time on his ride cymbal, kickin’ the bass drum, and adding his own polyrhythmic textures. Tenorman Lloyd joins the Trio and its throwback time to a 1950s Norman Granz Jazz at the Philharmonic concert battlin’ it out with Flip Phillips and Illinois Jacquet.\n\nWell, that’s the way I heard it.\n\n“How Can I Tell You” is about as close the new quartet could get to a late-night slow dance dreamy ballad. Moran’s (almost) cocktail piano and the drummer’s use of brushes sets the mood for the leader’s lyrical saxophone offering to the song’s inspiration, singer Billie Holiday.\n\nOn “Tagor” Lloyd stirs the bluesy stew prepared by his rhythm mates with his Eastern sounding flute. At the start Moran strums the piano strings like a guitar, Rogers adds a Motown melodic bass line, and the drummer drives “Tagor” forward with a snare and hi-hat attack.\n\nAt the mid-point, with no loss of drive, Moran moves to the keyboard to pound out a funky chording interval over a rock-and-roll backbeat. Start to finish this is a hand-clapper.\n\nThe title track opens with unaccompanied bass and then, boom!, the band takes off with a high energy up-tempo dance-like excursion into bop. Moran’s piano and Lloyd’s tenor solo engage Roger’s and Harland’s rhythms with startling athletic lyricism.\n\nBordering on playful and/or novelty, “Passin’ Thru” is a crowd pleasin’ groove.\n\nThe album closes on a respectful note with “Shiva’s Prayer.” A beautiful unaccompanied piano piece by Moran, with lovely arco bass playing by Rogers, and soft drums by Harland.\n\nThen quiet.\n\nSonny Sharrock | Ask the Ages | Axiom\n\nScott Yanow in his ultimate guide to the great jazz guitarists opined, \"Sonny Sharrock was the first truly avant-garde guitarist in jazz. . . When Sharrock burst on the scene in the mid-1960s, he was not only free in his choice of notes but in . . . his use of feedback and distorted sounds. He preceded Derek Bailey and Jimi Hendrix. During an era when few jazz guitarists even acknowledged rock, Sharrock was playing explosive solos that made him the Pharoah Sanders of the guitar.”\n\nInteresting, then, that he would pair up with saxophonist Sanders, along with bass player Charrette Moffet and drummer Elvin Jones in 1991 to record Ask the Ages, the consensus definitive and most essential album of Sharrock’s career.\n\nThis is unquestionably a free jazz album, how could it not be with Sonny Sharrock, Pharoah Sanders, and Elvin Jones ripping it up as if it was 1965.\n\nYet it is something else again, appealing and accessible to a wide range of music fans. Proof of this can be found on google: type in “rateyourmusic.com Ask the Ages,” select the top entry, and read the 45 reviews, and you’ll see what I mean.\n\nAsk the Ages has six original Sharrock compositions: two scorchers “Promises Kept” and “Many Mansions,” two mellow and melodic “Who Does She Hope to Be” and “Once Upon a Time,” and two in-betweeners, “Little Rock” and “As We Used to Sing.” It is the mellow tunes (and secondarily the in-betweeners) that make this album so appealing with “Who Does She Hope to Be” generally favored over “Once Upon a Time.”\n\nBut for my money, the latter is the exceptional track.\n\nWhile each instrument is heard in “Once Upon a Time,” it is the collective daresay “symphonic” — like sound that matters.\n\nSonny’s guitar, chording Hendrix-like and soloing at the same time (dubbing may have been involved); Pharoah’s tenor sax, offering a repetitive hummable figure; and Elvin’s non-stop striking of his drums with mallets, yes, with mallets not sticks or hands, creating a rhythmically throbbing pattern. Occasionally, Sonny spices the group’s malleting stew with a memorable Santana-like guitar line.\n\n​Overall, a never-to-be forgotten, compelling track.\n\nFrank Sinatra | Live in Australia 1959 | Blue Note\n\nWhile Sinatra’s time capsule albums are Wee Small Hours in the Morning, Songs for Swinging Lovers, Only the Lonely, and a few others, the “Jazziest” is Frank Sinatra with the Red Norvo Quintet Live In Australia 1959.\n\nA rare album where Frank sings his well-known fan favorites, not as originally recorded with a large studio orchestra, mind you, but backed by a small jazz combo live.\n\n​From Will Friedwall’s liner notes:\n\n“He just melted into it . . . He took responsibility (like a conductor) he beat off the group and everything, he did his own thing, and the band played great for him . . . [Alto/flute] player Jerry Dodgion elaborated: the informal format also encouraged Sinatra to vary both the program and the arrangements themselves . . . He could be different every night which is more in keeping with a jazz group.”\n\n​\n\nSome might argue that Sinatra’s performance with Count Basie’s band captured live in Las Vegas tops that in Australia 1959.\n\n​For me, Ol’ Blue Eyes' best live album is Australia 1959.\n\nFrank Sinatra | The Concert Sinatra | Reprise\n\nIn the entire recording oeuvre of Frank Sinatra there is nothing like The Concert Sinatra, an album of extended performances by Frank and a 73-piece symphony orchestra arranged and conducted by Nelson Riddle.\n\nThe recording features eight tunes (lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein on all but one.) These are not the vocal offerings of familiar Sinatra poses, the finger-snappin’ swingin’ bachelor or the down-and-out sad sack propped against the lamppost.\n\nNo, this is the full-voiced light classicist in the manner of contemporaries Todd Duncan, Howard Keel, Gordan McRae, or (almost) Paul Robeson.\n\n​\n\nIn other words, Frank gets as close as an American pop singer can to the bel canto style.\n\nOn no other album does Sinatra reveal such strength in his lower register and overall dynamic range. This album is in a class by itself. Discussions of what category it belongs to: jazz, pop jazz, pop, or Broadway — are irrelevant.\n\n​It’s simply incandescent.\n\nNo male interpretive singer of the 20th century other than Frank Sinatra could have pulled this off.\n\nWilson and Adderley | Nancy Wilson/Cannonball Adderley | Capitol\n\nI bought this CD for two reasons: one, my fondness for the classic Adderley Quintet (Cannonball (Alto), brother Nat (Cornet), Sam Jones (Bass), and Louis Hayes (Drums) with Joe Zawinal (Piano); and two, my piqued curiosity after I read an article in Downbeat magazine in 2004, listing the best jazz vocalist albums chosen by 73 jazz singers (21 male, 52 female).[1] At the top, number one, was the album Nancy Wilson/Cannonball Adderley originally recorded in 1961.\n\nAfter multiple listenings, I came around to understanding the record’s appeal to the Downbeat singers, helped along by Nancy Wilson’s statement in the album’s liner notes that she considered her vocals on the album “as a sort of easy-going third horn.”[2]\n\nJazz singers (all singers?) in particular desperately want to be a thoroughly integrated member of the band — not off to the side or out front, but in the mix. And that, in fact, was what Nancy was in this instance and what the DownBeat singers heard and no doubt wished for themselves.\n\nThe album is doubly interesting because it is not entirely a vocal album, five of the 12 tracks are instrumentals by the quintet (every one outstanding) especially Cannon’s alto solo on the trumpet warhorse “I Can’t Get Started” and the brothers cookin’ on “Teaneck,” but it is the seven Wilson tracks that caught the ears of the DownBeaters.\n\nHighlights for me are the gentle cornet playing by Nat behind Wilson on “Save Your Love for Me” and Nat’s tune “The Old Country;” and Cannon’s bopish swinging sax duet with Nancy (and Nat) on “Never Will I Marry” and “Happy Talk.”\n\nSam Jones bass is superb, especially on “A Sleeping Bee.”\n\n“Singers” All-Time Favorite Vocal Jazz Albums, DownBeat, June 2004, 48.\n\nRon Grevatt, original liner notes, Nancy Wilson/Cannonball Adderley, Capitol Records, 2004, Compact Disc, CDP 077778120421.\n\nThe Faine jazz CD collection.\n\nContinuing from part 2, here are more personal favorites from my collection of 440 jazz CDs.\n\n​\n\nRoswell Rudd | MALIcool | Soundscape\n\nMost often identified with the jazz avant-garde of the 1960s, trombonist Roswell Rudd, together with West African (Malian) musicians, formed a cross-cultural ensemble to create an original sound neither jazz nor traditional African.\n\n​The result: MALIcool.\n\n​Rudd’s usual thick trombone sounds, growls, smears, and boozy blats along with his warm tone dances its way among the sonic wonderland of Malian instruments — kora (12-string harp), ngoni (plucked lute), balaphone (Afro vibes), guitar, bass, and djembe (hand drum).\n\nAfter reconciling the two musical systems (7-tone open form with 12-tone closed form), arrangements for the most part were deliberately sparse, leaving room for everyone to improvise.\n\nThe album’s songs could not have been more varied: Thelonious Monk’s “Jackie-ing,” a traditional Welsh folk song, a re-imagining of Gershwin’s “Summertime,” and Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy,” and several African traditional numbers.\n\nA close listen to the album’s ten tunes, specifically to the strings (kora, ngoni, and guitar) will let you know where country blues came from, ditto the balafon, where swing-era vibist Lionel Hampton came from.\n\nJohn Ephland of DownBeat magazine wrote: “Jazz purists will no doubt scoff at this meeting of musical souls. No matter how you slice and dice it, this music, modest at times, is still a ballsy bit of panache, a marriage of seemingly disparate worlds into something that works.”\n\n​I agree, besides, most jazz purists did not scoff. Released in 2002, MALIcool made it onto various Top Ten lists of the year.\n\nJohn Hollenbeck | Songs I Like a Lot | Sunnyside\n\nDrummer/arranger John Hollenbeck has put together a stunning album with cohorts Gary Versace (piano/organ), Kate McGarry and Theo Beckman (vocalists), and the 16-piece Frankfort Radio Big Band (five winds, four trumpets, four trombones, three rhythm — drums, electric and acoustic guitar, and bass.)\n\nAfter a first listen, you will like Hollenbeck’s songs too, starting with the majestically arranged “Wichita Lineman.” The Jimmy Webb classic begins with a softly picked guitar line over a clarinet/flute chorus.\n\nThe crystalline pure voice of McGarry sings the first verse. An instrumental interval precedes Beckman’s take on the second verse before a rhythmic chording of piano, flute, and winds support a lengthy electric guitar solo.\n\nThe prominent role Hollenbeck assigns to the guitar here is perhaps a tribute to Glen Campbell’s and Wrecking Crew regular Carol Kaye’s guitar playing on the original hit version. Additional instruments and the vocalists enter the fray, a new but related melody develops, and the guitar makes a final statement before the coda: a gorgeous instrumental passage with voices in harmony and flutes a flutter.\n\nJohn Kelman (All About Jazz) concluded: “It’s a song that’s been covered many times before but never so cinematically.”\n\nNext up: “Canvas” by English singer-songwriter Imogen Heap from her 2009 album Ellipse.\n\nThe track begins with a riffing guitar followed by an instrumental statement of the melody. McGarry enters alone and then is doubled by Beckman giving voice to rather a singular melody that leads to a magnificent trombone solo. Hollenbeck’s drumming is persistent throughout, upping the tempo and the song’s energy at the close.\n\nJohn Kelman again hits the nail on the head when he wrote, “If Wichita Lineman” is cinematic then Hollenbeck’s arrangement of Webb’s ‘The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress’ is positively IMAX.”\n\nThe arranger’s take on this lesser-known Webb tune is a sprawling 14-minute wall of compelling sound. The piece begins with just McGarry’s voice and piano before a layer of flutes and winds softly insinuate themselves into the arrangement.\n\nThe tempo picks up, and then guitar, drums and other instruments join in, piano becomes more dominant, volume steadily builds, drums more active. McGarry and Beckman join in, build, build, voices ooohing and aaahing.\n\nThen a cooldown led by a lone clarinet before the entire orchestra climbs back up the aural staircase to greet a tenor saxophone solo at the top.\n\nBeckman re-enters voicing the melody. McGarry joins him as the full orchestra roars into a symphonic ending with wind instruments mirroring the violins. Trust me, this is better heard than read.\n\n“Man of Constant Sorrow,” whew!\n\nThe traditional folk tune’s tempestuous intro — low growly brass and winds and Hollenbeck’s tumultuous drums — lead to a second section of quick-strummed acoustic guitar and Beckman’s delivery of “Sorrow’s” first verse with McGarry’s repeating last line.\n\nA killer lengthy tenor sax solo follows as Hammond organ punctuates the never-wavering strumming and drumming. Beckman sings the second verse.\n\nMcGarry repeats the last line as before. Alto sax solo follows, other instruments join in, low horns and organ chug away along with Hollenbeck’s constantly churning drums.\n\nBeckman sings the final verse, and with McGarry, sings the last line “Meet you on that golden shore” 10 times! For the coda, organ, full orchestra, drums, vocalists go crazy, or as one critic put it, “Go Dixieland in the sixth dimension.” In other words, go free, like maybe Charlie Haden and the Liberation Orchestra.\n\nWho could have imagined such an ending for a circa 1900 mountain folk song? John Hollenbeck, that’s who.\n\nFree jazz originator Ornette Coleman’s “All My Life” originally sung by Indian singer-songwriter Asha Puhli in Coleman’s Science Fiction (1972) album is given a much different treatment by Hollenbeck.\n\nVocal honors to Kate McGarry, and what a lovely melody it is. At the outset, she sings over simple\n\npiano accompaniment before the orchestra enters with a paraphrase. McGarry continues on with light orchestra backing, passing the baton to the band for a round of overlapping solos.\n\nThen, with busy drums underneath, singer and orchestra carry the melody together, with the latter becoming progressively more dominant. The song ends with multiple instruments soloing.\n\nThrough it all, Ornette’s attractive melody is never far from listeners’ ears.\n\n“Fall’s Lake,” a song from the indie-electronic artist Nubukazu Takemura featuring clarinet and distorted-sounding vocalists is not as interesting as the others. Too arty.\n\nHollenbeck’s song “Chapel Falls” closes the album in a relaxed mood. It starts with a repetitive piano figure underneath a sing-songy melody that is subsequently repeated by various sections of the band creating an ear-catching soundscape.\n\n​In essence, a mid-tempo toe-tapper, a good closer.\n\nBruce Hornsby | Camp Meeting | Legacy\n\nThis is not, repeat not, a novelty album — far from it.\n\nPop/country singer-pianist Hornsby can indeed play jazz piano, especially in the company of heavyweights Christian McBride (bass) and Jack DeJohnette (drums).\n\nThe trio tackles familiar themes from the jazz songbook — “Solar” (Miles), “Giant Steps” (Coltrane), “Straight No Chaser,” (Monk), “Un Poco Loco,” (Powell), “We’ll Be Together Again,” (Fischer/Lane), and two Hornsby originals. The album’s standout track is his “Camp Meeting”: a slow-building churchified romp worthy of FM radio play. The interplay between pianist and bassist is extraordinary.\n\nJazz Times critic Steve Greenlee commented, “The music stretches and contracts, it races, it gallops and It rumbles. It sounds like Keith Jarrett and Chick Corea and Bill Evans, all of them and none of them.”\n\n​Precisely, it sounds like Bruce Hornsby.\n\nAndrew Hill | Passing Ships | Blue Note\n\nIn my opinion, the uniquely gifted Andrew Hill (1931–2009) never received his due as a jazz composer or pianist beyond the narrow jazz critical elite.\n\nRegarding the former, people are quick to name Duke Ellington, Billy Stayhorn, Tadd Dameron, Charles Mingus, John Lewis, Thelonious Monk, Bill Evans, Benny Golson, Wayne Shorter for example, but never Andrew Hill.\n\nSimilarly, when bop and post-bop pianists are discussed, people will offer up the likes of Bud Powell, Horace Silver, Mal Waldron, Paul Bley, Cecil Taylor, and Carla Bley but never Andrew Hill.\n\nThis, even though he recorded 51 mostly highly rated albums (31 as leader featuring top-flight musicians) and even though he received many prestigious awards, for example DownBeat Hall of Fame, NEA Jazz Master, Jazz Journalist Association Lifetime Achievement, and the first Doris Duke Foundation Award for Jazz Composers. Andrew, it appears, was about as famous as Whistler’s father.\n\nOne last sad note, in Whitney Balliett’s voluminous 880-page Collected Works: A Journal of Jazz 1952–2001 there is not one mention of — you guessed it — Andrew Hill.\n\nAs for me, I fell in love with his 1960s Blue Note LPs (Black Fire, Smokestack, Judgement, Point of Departure, Compulsion) and one, Passing Ships, recorded in 1969 that was belatedly released on CD 34 years later.\n\nAndrew surrounded himself with rhythm (Ron Carter, bass, Lenny White, drums) and six horns: (Woody Shaw and Dizzy Reese, trumpets), (Julian Preister, trombone), (Bob Northern, french horn), (Howard Johnson, tuba and bass clarinet), (Joe Farrell, soprano and tenor, and other winds) — a nonet performing seven original compositions.\n\nThis is a personal favorite even though it has obvious flaws. The recording and mixing are sub-par and Andrew’s arrangements for large ensemble are, while ambitious, sloppily executed at times (perhaps due to inadequate rehearsal time).\n\nAndrew compensated for this by, as always, his appealing quirky, idiosyncratic compositions and outstanding soloing by everyone, especially Farrell, Shaw, and himself. Listen to the first tracks “Sideways,” “Passing Ships,” Plantation Bag,” and “Noontide.”\n\n​Ask yourself whether anyone of these compositions could make a hard bop playlist along with tracks by hard boppers Art Blakey, Horace Silver, Lee Morgan, Benny Golson, Jackie McLean, Donald Byrd, Bobby Timmons or Cannonball Adderley. You bet, most would, especially “Plantation Bag.”\n\nAndrew Hill | Live at Montreux | Freedom\n\nLive at Montreux (1975) is an excellent introduction to Andrew the solo pianist starting with the jagged, jaunty and delightful “Snake Hip Waltz” followed by the darker but still accessible “Nefertisus.”\n\nThe longest track on the album is the abstract and challenging yet entertaining eighteen-minute “Relativity.”\n\nThe pianist’s stylistic influences — stride, boogie-woogie, post-bop, and avant-garde are on full display. The album concludes with Andrew’s five-minute sketch of the melodic contours of Duke Ellington’s supreme contribution to the American hymnal “Come Sunday.”\n\nThe Faine jazz CD collection.\n\n​In part 1 of this blog series, I wrote about my collection of 440 jazz CDs I acquired from the mid-1980s to the present — the CD Era — noting that 124 of them consisted of multiple buys from 16 artists: 14 from trumpeter Miles Davis down to five each from saxophonists Cannonball Adderley, Ornette Colman, Chico Freeman, Charles Lloyd, and pianist Keith Jarett and Mal Waldron.\n\nStarting here in part 2, I discuss in some detail personal favorites from the collection in no particular order.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nElla Fitzgerald | Ella in Berlin/Mack The Knife | Verve\n\n​\n\n​William F. Lee’s Jazz Singers Biographical Dictionary claims Fitzgerald was considered by many to be the finest female jazz singer of all time.\n\nTaken at face value (ignoring those who considered her a pop singer) evidence for “the finest female jazz singer ever” can be found in her famous “Song Book” albums where she recorded definitive studio orchestra versions of the American Songbook composers Berlin, Gershwin, Arlen, Ellington, Kern, Mercer, Porter, and Rodgers and Hart. But even more important are the many concert/nightclub stage recordings where her highness is backed by a small jazz combo.\n\nIn this regard, one only has to look no further than the best of the lot, Grammy-winning Ella in Berlin backed by the Paul Smith Quartet. Ella’s assured sense of rhythm and close rapport with the musicians is evident throughout, on the slow ballads as well as the virtuoso scat numbers. The program is superbly varied.\n\nThirteen songs equally divided between slow, medium, and up-tempo numbers.\n\n​Gershwin’s “Summertime” is sung straight with minimum vibrato, while his “Lorelie” is a slow tempo swinger.\n\nOn “Our Love Is Here to Stay” (Gershwin again) and personal favorite “Gone with the Wind” her instrumental phrasing comes to the fore, leaving little doubt that she is an ambrosial class singer; at times stuttering a word into three or four syllables, speeding up or slowing down a line, creating new interesting melodies while still paying homage to the source.\n\nBut it is “Mack the Knife” and “How High the Moon” that elevate this album to precious metal status, and likely entry into the Library of Congress National Recording Registry someday. Ella’s “Mack” surpasses both the Louis Armstrong and Bobby Darin versions. Hard to believe because she forgets the lyrics at the outset but continues by making up her own whimsical lyrics as she goes along, picking them out of the air — wonderin’ what’s the next chorus to this song now, somethin’ ‘bout cash, trash, you won’t recognize it, it’s a surprise it — even mentioning the prior Darin and Armstrong recordings, scatting a delightful imitation of Satch.\n\nThis four-minute lighthearted musical improvisation, believe it or not, won best song by a female at the 1960 Grammy Award.\n\nAnd to think, the next song, the last one in the concert, topped Ella’s rendition of “Mack.” Her take on “High the Moon” is a masterclass in scatting. Few jazz singers, male or female, have come this close to perfection, considering that the racehorse tempo of “Moon” is sustained over seven minutes.\n\nThe Paul Smith Quartet deserves high praise for the stellar support throughout, especially pianist Smith and drummer Gus Johnson.\n\nKeith Jarrett Trio | Somewhere | ECM\n\n​\n\nKeith Jarrett is one of the most widely admired jazz pianists on the planet — primarily known for his Koln Concert album, the best-selling solo album in jazz history.\n\nThe Koln did the trick for most, but for me, it was his Standards Trio albums with bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Jack DeJohnette.\n\nBeyond reproach are the trio’s renditions of songs from the Great American Songbook (like “Blame It On My Youth,” “Body and Soul,” and “I Thought About You”) and the jazz repertory (“Woody ‘n You,” “Things Ain’t What They Used to Be,” and “Oleo”).\n\nEspecially beyond reproach are the occasional compositions of their own, typically mesmerizing trance-inducing vamps that for me were always an album highlight (like “The Cure,” on the The Cure, “Sunprayer” on Tribute One, and “U Dance” on Tribute Two). Perhaps the best of these appears on the 2013 album Somewhere.\n\n​Jarrett’s reading of the Leonard Bernstein–Stephen Sondheim “Somewhere/Everywhere” theme appropriately begins gentle and sublime, then at the five-minute mark of the 19-minute extravaganza, it gets “reconstructed and reshaped . . . into the driving, hypnotic improvisational ostinato coda Jarrett calls ‘Everywhere,’ with breathtaking chord voicings, forceful middle-register bass flourishes, and awe-inspiring tom-tom and cymbal work by DeJohnette; the track’s conclusion is drenched in royal gospel and regal blues” that fades into the distance, a chance for the audience to catch its breath before erupting into a rush of explosive shouts and applause.\n\nThe stage mic captures a round of laughter from the trio, as if to say, “How the hell did we pull this one off!”\n\nChico Freeman | Spirit Sensitive |\n\n​India Navigation\n\nOn Spirit Sensitive saxophonist Chico Freeman lends his pure sound and articulate relatable improvisations to 10 memorable songs composed by the following:\n\nGreat American Song Book composers Vernon Duke “Autumn In New York,” and Rodgers and Hart “It Never Entered My Mind,” as well as seven jazz musician composers: Thad Jones “A Child Is Born,” pianists Duke Ellington “Don’t Get Around Much Anymore” and Horace Silver “Peace,” bassist Cecil McBee “Closer to You Alone,” guitarist Luis Bonfa “Carnival,” singer Patti Austin “You Don’t Have to Say You’re Sorry,” and tenor saxophonist John Coltrane “Lonnie’s Lament” and “Wise One.”\n\nAll the jazz songs (save for those by Coltrane) have lyrics and are a testimony if you will, to their euphoniousness.\n\nFreeman plays tenor on all of the above, except for “You Don’t Have to Say.” Chico is sensitively supported by bassist Cecil McBee, pianist John Hicks, and drummer Billy Hart, although the drums appear to be improperly recorded, the only flaw on the album.\n\nDrum issue aside, this is one of the most beautifully realized albums. It starts with quality material and proceeds with masterful interpretations.\n\nPerhaps I am overly biased in my opinion here, largely because (truth be told) my absolute favorite song is Patti Austin’s “You Don’t Have to Say You're Sorry,” and my favorite instrumental version is by Chico Freeman.\n\nI first took notice of Austin in 1976 upon the release of her first album, End of the Rainbow, with the self-composed “You don’t have to say you’re sorry / but I sure do wish you would.”\n\n​I have played the song numerous times over the years and bought the album for friends. Chico plays it on soprano saxophone with minimal but perfectly placed jazz flourishes.\n\n​Tearfully gorgeous. Ms. Austin, I’m certain, would agree.\n\nDarcy James Argue | Infernal Machines |\n\n​New Amsterdam\n\nSpring 2009 saw the release of Infernal Machines by Darcy James Argue, composer/conductor of an 18-person swing-size big band called Secret Society (five winds, five trumpets/fluegelhorns, four trombones and four rhythm — drums along with acoustic and electric piano, guitar and bass.)\n\n​But Glen Miller, Tommy Dorsey it was not, nor was it ’50s Stan Kenton, ’60s Don Ellis, or even ’90s Maria Schneider. But what was it?\n\nNo ordinary big band album, that’s for sure. But critics loved it, though some struggled a bit to describe it.\n\nTo me, Machines offered a cornucopia of sounds, some familiar, some not, some loud, some soft, floating above shifting rhythms with an overall steady pulse.\n\nKarl Ackerman (All About Jazz) said it more succinctly: “The sound is both complex and nuanced at the same time.” He also said, “Each influence blends seamlessly into the next without disrupting the content of the piece” — in effect, “a blending of new classical, indie rock and jazz.”\n\nLarry Blumenthal (Wall Street Journal) described the band as “elegant in its combination of disparate influences from distorted electric guitar to magisterial wind instrument arrangements to minimalist rhythms.”\n\nI concluded that Argue’s writing reflected the whole of contemporary music, as he sees it, into big band music for today.\n\nMachines is art music created by an exceptionally talented composer/arranger executed by extraordinary competent musicians that remains as fresh and revolutionary today as when it was recorded. Argue’s debut album therefore belongs in every jazz fan's collection.\n\n​It telleth the future."
