        "text": "His death was announced by April Thibeault, his publicist.\n\nNever among the flashiest or most muscular of jazz drummers, Mr. Hamilton had a subtle and melodic approach that made him ideally suited for the understated style that came to be known as cool jazz, of which his hometown, Los Angeles, was the epicenter.\n\nHe was a charter member of the baritone saxophonist Gerry Mulligan’s quartet, which helped lay the groundwork for the cool movement. His own quintet, which he formed shortly after leaving the Mulligan group, came to be regarded as the quintessence of cool. With its quiet intensity, its intricate arrangements and its uniquely pastel instrumentation of flute, guitar, cello, bass and drums — the flutist, Buddy Collette, also played alto saxophone — the Chico Hamilton Quintet became one of the most popular groups in jazz. (The cellist in that group, Fred Katz, died in September.)\n\nThe group was a mainstay of the nightclub and jazz festival circuit and even appeared in movies. It was prominently featured in the 1957 film “Sweet Smell of Success,” with Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis. (One character in that movie, a guitarist played by Martin Milner, was a member of the Hamilton group on screen, miming to the playing of the quintet’s real guitarist, John Pisano.) And it was seen in “Jazz on a Summer’s Day,” Bert Stern’s acclaimed documentary about the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival.\n\nCool jazz had fallen out of favor by the mid-1960s, but by then Mr. Hamilton had already altered the sound and style of his quintet, replacing the cellist with a trombonist and adopting a bluesier, more aggressive approach.\n\nIn 1966, after more personnel changes and more shifts in audience tastes, Mr. Hamilton, no longer on top of the jazz world but increasingly interested in composing — he wrote the music for Roman Polanski’s 1965 film, “Repulsion” — disbanded the quintet and formed a company that provided music for television shows and commercials.\n\nBut he continued to perform and record occasionally, and by the mid-1970s he was back on the road as a bandleader full time. He was never again as big a star as he had been in the 1950s, but he remained active, and his music became increasingly difficult to categorize, incorporating elements of free jazz, jazz-rock fusion and other styles.\n\nHe was born Foreststorn Hamilton in Los Angeles on Sept. 21, 1921. His father, Jesse, worked at the University Club of Southern California, and his mother, Pearl Lee Gonzales Cooley Hamilton, was a school dietitian.\n\nAsked by Marc Myers of the website JazzWax how he got the name Chico, he said he wasn’t sure but thought he acquired it as a teenager because “I was always a small dude.”\n\nWhile still in high school he immersed himself in the local jazz scene, and by 1940 he was touring with Lionel Hampton’s big band. After serving in the Army during World War II, he worked briefly with the bands of Jimmy Mundy, Charlie Barnet and Count Basie before becoming the house drummer at the Los Angeles nightclub Billy Berg’s in 1946.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1955 he toured Europe in the summers as a member of Lena Horne’s backup band, while playing the rest of the year in Los Angeles. His softly propulsive playing was an essential element in the popularity of Mulligan’s 1952 quartet, which also included Chet Baker on trumpet but, unusually, did not have a pianist. The group helped set the template for what came to be known as West Coast jazz, smoother and more cerebral than its East Coast counterpart.\n\nThe high profile he achieved with Mulligan emboldened him to try his luck as a bandleader, something fairly unusual for a drummer in the 1950s. His success was almost instantaneous.\n\nHe went on to record prolifically for a variety of labels, including Pacific Jazz, Impulse, Columbia and Soul Note. Among the honors he received were a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters Award in 2004 and a Kennedy Center Living Jazz Legend Award in 2007.\n\nAlthough slowed by age, Mr. Hamilton continued to perform and record beyond his 90th birthday. He released an album, “Revelation,” in 2011 on the Joyous Shout label, and had recently completed another one, “Inquiring Minds,” scheduled for release in 2014. Until late last year he was appearing at the Manhattan nightclub Drom with Euphoria, the group he had led since 1989.\n\nMr. Hamilton is survived by a brother, Don; a daughter, Denise Hamilton; a granddaughter; and two great-granddaughters. His brother the actor Bernie Hamilton, and his wife, Helen Hamilton, both died in 2008.\n\nMr. Hamilton was highly regarded not just for his drumming, but also as a talent scout. Musicians who passed through his group before achieving stardom on their own include the bassist Ron Carter, the saxophonists Eric Dolphy and Charles Lloyd and the guitarists Jim Hall, Gabor Szabo and Larry Coryell. In a 1992 interview with National Public Radio, the saxophonist Eric Person, a longtime sideman, praised Mr. Hamilton for teaching “how to work on the bandstand, how you dress onstage, how you carry yourself in public.”\n\nMr. Hamilton taught those lessons as a bandleader and, for more than two decades, as a faculty member at the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music in New York. Teaching young musicians, he told The Providence Journal in Rhode Island in 2006, was “not difficult if they realize how fortunate they are.”\n\n“But,” he added, “if they’re on an ego trip, that’s their problem.”\n\nDaniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.\n\nThis article has been revised to reflect the following correction:\n\nCorrection: November 26, 2013\n\nAn earlier version of this obituary misidentified the guitarist who is heard with Mr. Hamilton’s quintet on the soundtrack of “Sweet Smell of Success.” He is John Pisano, not Jim Hall.\n\n★ Ben Allison Band (Tuesday) The bassist and composer Ben Allison moves incrementally closer to a rock ethos on his forthcoming album, “The Stars Look Very Different Today.” (The title is from a David Bowie lyric.) The album, which is being released the day of this show, features Mr. Allison’s aggressive but agile working band, with Steve Cardenas and Brandon Seabrook on guitars and Allison Miller on drums. At 9:30 p.m., Joe’s Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15 in advance, $20 at the door. (Nate Chinen)\n\nPeter and Will Anderson (Tuesday through Dec. 29) The upstanding young torchbearers Peter and Will Anderson — also saxophonists, clarinetists, Juilliard alumni and identical twins — present a show called “Le Jazz Hot: How the French Saved Jazz.” The engagement, running through much of December, will feature a quintet inspired by the music of Django Reinhardt, Sidney Bechet and others. Tuesdays through Thursdays at 7:30 p.m., Fridays at 8:30 p.m., Saturdays at 5:30 and 8:30 p.m., Sundays at 3:30 and 7:30 p.m., 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 753-5959, 59e59.org; $25, $17.50 for members. (Chinen)\n\nBushman’s Revenge (Saturday and Monday) This furious-sounding Norwegian power trio — the guitarist Even Helte Hermansen, the bassist Rune Nergaard and the drummer Gard Nilssen — takes an approach to jazz-rock that owes as much to Black Sabbath as it does to Tony Williams Lifetime. The band has a convincing new album, “Thou Shalt Boogie,” that should provide fodder for these club dates, each with an opening set by Cortex, a jazz combo led by the trumpeter Thomas Johansson. Saturday at 10:30 p.m., Nublu, 62 Avenue C, between Fourth and Fifth Streets, East Village, nublu.net; $10. Monday at 11 p.m., Shrine, 2271 Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard, at 134th Street, (212) 690-7807, shrinenyc.com; no cover charge. (Chinen)\n\nMarc Cary Focus Trio (Wednesday) Marc Cary approaches the piano trio tradition from a predominantly rhythmic standpoint, but with ample harmonic sophistication. His Focus Trio, with Rashaan Carter on bass and Sameer Gupta on drums, is celebrating the release of its most recent album, “Four Directions.” At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $20. (Chinen)\n\nBrian Charette Organ Sextette (Wednesday and Thursday) The Hammond B-3 organist Brian Charette weighs the ageless objective of soul-jazz with a trace of restless modernity. His band has Itai Kriss on flute, Mike DiRubbo and Kenny Brooks on saxophones, John Ellis on bass clarinet and Mark Ferber on drums. From 9:30 p.m. to midnight, Smalls Jazz Club, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, smallsjazzclub.com; $20 cover. (Chinen)\n\n★ Freddy Cole Holiday Celebration (Friday through Sunday) The singer and pianist Freddy Cole exudes a gallant but unfussy brand of cool. He is singing Christmas songs in this weekend engagement, and as usual, his maturity will most likely manifest itself as understatement. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $35 cover at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)\n\nSylvie Courvoisier Trio (Wednesday) Sylvie Courvoisier is a pianist with a precise technique but an exploratory temperament, and she should have a strong rapport with her smartly rugged rhythm team here, with Drew Gress on bass and Kenny Wollessen on drums. At 9:30 p.m., ShapeShifter Lab, 18 Whitwell Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, shapeshifterlab.com; $15. (Chinen)\n\nSteve Davis Sextet: The Music of J. J. Johnson (Friday and Saturday) The trombonist Steve Davis pays homage to a giant of his instrument with a band that features the trumpeter Eddie Henderson, the tenor saxophonist Eric Alexander, the pianist Harold Mabern, the bassist John Webber and the drummer Joe Farnsworth. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; $38 cover. (Chinen)\n\nAlan Ferber’s Big Band (Friday and Saturday) The trombonist Alan Ferber has a core familiarity with large-ensemble work — he typically leads a nonet, often augmented by a string section — so he should be on solid footing with this big band, stocked with versatile peers like the saxophonist Chris Cheek, the trumpeter Taylor Haskins and the guitarist Nir Felder. At 9 and 11 p.m., the Jazz Gallery at Salt Space, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, (646) 494-3625, jazzgallery.org; $20, $10 for members. (Chinen)\n\n★ Benny Golson Quartet (Thursday through Dec. 8) The tenor saxophonist Benny Golson is celebrated in jazz culture for a number of things: his smartly sturdy compositions; his gruff but dignified sound; his voluminous, loquacious wit. All are sure to factor into this run, featuring Mike LeDonne on piano, Buster Williams on bass and Carl Allen on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $30. (Chinen)\n\nWycliffe Gordon & Friends: The Music of Duke, Dizzy, and the Dorseys (Friday through Sunday) A charismatic trombonist specializing in gutbucket swing, Wycliffe Gordon pays tribute to a handful of jazz heroes with a band that includes Dee Daniels on vocals (on Friday), Joseph Boga on trumpet (on Saturday and Sunday), and Pete and Will Anderson on saxophones (on Sunday). At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $40 and $45 cover, with a $10 minimum; $25 for students. (Chinen)\n\n★ Dave Holland’s Prism (Friday and Saturday) The bassist-bandleader Dave Holland digs back into knockabout jazz-funk mode with “Prism,” his potent new album, which features a famous old colleague, the guitarist Kevin Eubanks, along with the brilliant pianist Craig Taborn and the indomitable drummer Eric Harland. And there’s every reason to believe that this engagement, which follows a long stretch on the road, will showcase the band even more emphatically. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)\n\nHush Point (Friday) A collective formed not long ago by John McNeil, a trumpeter of dry wit and lyrical concision, and Jeremy Udden, a saxophonist of fluid introspection, Hush Point features new original music, and the responsive young rhythm team of Aryeh Kobrinsky on bass and Vinnie Sperrazza on drums. The band will play music from its recent, self-titled album as well as a sequel, to be recorded early in the new year. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $20 cover, which includes one drink. (Chinen)\n\nJoe Locke-Geoffrey Keezer Quartet (Tuesday) A kinetic and harmonically sophisticated vibraphonist, Joe Locke has recently been working with the pianist Geoffrey Keezer, his equal in fluid composure. As on their album “Signing,” they join forces with the bassist Mike Pope and the drummer Terreon Gully. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $20. (Chinen)\n\n★ Jason Moran and the Bandwagon (Friday through Sunday) Mr. Moran, the broadly heralded pianist and composer, has been busy of late as a bicoastal concert programmer (at the Kennedy Center and the SFJazz Center), and his next album will be a conceptual tribute to Fats Waller. Despite all that, or maybe because of it, he has kept a freshness in his interactions with Tarus Mateen on bass guitar and Nasheet Waits on drums; as the Bandwagon, they still have every bit of the grounded swagger that works so well in rooms like this one (and especially this one). At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 and $30 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)\n\nNow vs. Now (Wednesday) This hyper-literate groove band, with Jason Lindner on piano and synthesizers, Panagiotis Andreou on bass and Mark Guiliana on drums, celebrates the release of “Earth Analog,” a manifesto in the form of an album. At 7 p.m., Rockwood Music Hall, 196 Allen Street, between Stanton and Houston Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 477-4155, rockwoodmusichall.com; $10. (Chinen)\n\nRufus Reid and the Out Front Trio (Friday) Out Front is the longtime outlet for Mr. Reid, a bassist with more than 40 years of experience. A trio with the pianist Steve Allee and the drummer Duduka Da Fonseca, it upholds a cruising, unflappable vision of postbop — here as on a recent, self-titled album. At 8 and 10 p.m., Jazz at Kitano, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119, kitano.com; $25 cover, with a $15 minimum. (Chinen)\n\nTed Rosenthal Trio (Tuesday) Ted Rosenthal, a pianist of fastidious purpose, has a new holiday album, “Wonderland,” featuring the same attentive trio found here, with Noriko Ueda on bass and Tim Horner on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $30 cover, with a $10 minimum; $15 for students. (Chinen)\n\nDavid Sanborn (Tuesday through Dec. 8) An alto saxophonist synonymous with unctuous, gleaming crossover fare, Mr. Sanborn has been returning to his roots: the piquant soul-jazz of Hank Crawford and, by extension, Ray Charles. He returns to his regular New York perch with a band that includes Ricky Peterson on organ and piano, Nicky Moroch on guitar, Richard Patterson on bass and Gene Lake on drums. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $55 cover at tables, $30 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)\n\nNick Sanders Trio (Thursday) Nick Sanders is a young pianist, originally from New Orleans, with a precise touch and a wealth of information at his command. As on his prepossessing new debut album, “Nameless Neighbors,” he appears here with the bassist Henry Fraser and the drummer Connor Baker. At 9 and 11 p.m., The Jazz Gallery at Salt Space, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, (646) 494-3625, jazzgallery.org; $15, $10 for members in the first set; $10, $5 for members in the second set. (Chinen)\n\n★ Maria Schneider Orchestra (Friday through Sunday) Evocative harmonic coloration and swirling rhythmic undercurrent are two of the chief devices of this large ensemble, led by the composer Maria Schneider. Its annual Thanksgiving week engagement will feature strong contributions — from the likes of the alto saxophonist Steve Wilson, the trombonist Ryan Keberle and the pianist Frank Kimbrough — but its true strength lies in a virtually unsurpassed ensemble cohesion. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set on Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $35. (Chinen)\n\n★ Esperanza Spalding (Tuesday through Dec. 8) “We Are America,” the stand-alone new single by Esperanza Spalding, unfolds as an earnest message song, aimed at closing the detention camp at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. It’s the latest example of the uses that Ms. Spalding finds for her own celebrity — and a fine extension of the music on “Radio Music Society,” the crossover pop album she released last year. She has worked as both a leader and an ensemble member at the Village Vanguard, but not with this crew, before now. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)\n\nSeated in the living room of his casually elegant home here in West Hollywood, not far from an alcove crowded with Grammy Awards — more than a dozen of them, including one for album of the year — Mr. Hancock, 73, was in a cordial mood, quick with a disarming laugh. He was also still jet-lagged from an East Asian tour that had ended in copious meetings with government officials about International Jazz Day, his signature initiative as a good will ambassador for Unesco. Fortunately, there was a stretch of relative calm ahead before he was due in Washington, for this year’s Kennedy Center Honors, where he’ll be among a class of five honorees that includes Billy Joel and Shirley MacLaine. (The gala concert, which happens next Sunday, will be broadcast by CBS on Dec. 29.)\n\nMr. Hancock’s eminence in jazz goes hand in hand with his stature in the realm of pop, to a degree that nobody else has ever managed. After redefining the language of post-bop piano in the 1960s, he delved into funk, electronic music and pop-R&B, leaving his mark at nearly every turn. A handsome new boxed set, “The Complete Columbia Album Collection 1972-1988” (Legacy), gathers his sweep on 34 CDs; among the albums are “Head Hunters,” a jazz-funk experiment that has sold more than a million copies, and “Future Shock,” whose hit single, “Rockit,” became an early hip-hop touchstone and a surrealist fixture of the frontier era of MTV. In the same spirit, Mr. Hancock’s next album will probably be a collaboration with Flying Lotus, the head-trippy electronic producer, and Thundercat, an affiliated electric bass virtuoso and vocalist.\n\nDisclaimers aside, few would dispute that Mr. Hancock has become one of jazz’s chief emissaries. Along with his Unesco appointment, he’s creative chairman for jazz at the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and chairman of the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, which runs not only a prestigious competition and postgraduate program but also educational outreach worldwide. When he accepted that Grammy for album of the year in 2008, for “River: The Joni Letters” (Verve), a gently illuminated tribute to his friend Joni Mitchell, he was the one to point out that it had been 43 years since a jazz artist won the award.\n\nThat Mr. Hancock has always considered jazz his core — whatever the style he happened to be playing, and however shrill the objections of his critics — can be chalked up to his elastic understanding of the art form. “The thing that keeps jazz alive, even if it’s under the radar,” he said, “is that it is so free and so open to not only lend its influence to other genres, but to borrow and be influenced by other genres. That’s the way it breathes.”\n\nThis credo seems by now like a personal truism for him. It will probably form a major thread in his memoir, due out from Viking next fall, and in “The Ethics of Jazz,” a series of lectures he’s scheduled to give at Harvard as the 2014 Charles Eliot Norton professor of poetry, a position previously held by T. S. Eliot and Igor Stravinsky, among others. Some of his lecture topics add up to a précis of themes from his career: “The Wisdom of Miles Davis.” “Breaking the Rules.” “Innovation And New Technologies.” “Cultural Diplomacy and the Voice of Freedom.”\n\nMr. Hancock studied classical music as a child, but growing up in Chicago, he couldn’t help hearing his share of blues. At the time, his tastes ran more toward doo-wop: “I heard the Ravens, and the Five Thrills, and the Penguins, and the Midnighters.” Jazz gripped him after he heard a classmate’s piano trio at a school talent show.\n\nHe enrolled as an engineering major at Grinnell College, though it wasn’t long before he was discovered by the trumpeter Donald Byrd. After appearing on several of Byrd’s Blue Note albums, he made his own debut on the label, in 1962. And for anyone who has decried the pull of commercialism in his career, it’s worth remembering that the first track on that album was “Watermelon Man,” a soulful tune that fast became a hit.\n\nMr. Hancock was hired by Miles Davis the following year, becoming the harmonic linchpin in one of the most accomplished small groups in jazz history. “He is one of those rare people in the music that really created a shift,” the pianist Geri Allen said of Mr. Hancock’s work in that band. “After him, everything changed in terms of what people thought the piano was capable of. His knowledge base was so inclusive and thorough, and beside that was his absolute virtuosity and humanity.”\n\nDuring his five-year tenure with Davis, Mr. Hancock released his own influential albums, notably “Maiden Voyage,” “Empyrean Isles” and “Speak Like a Child.” His logical but painterly compositions also found a chamberlike setting on “The Prisoner,” inspired by his work on a television cigarette commercial. “They wanted something that sounded like a Miles Davis-Gil Evans arrangement,” he said. “When I did the commercial, I loved that sound so much that for my next record, which ended up being ‘The Prisoner,’ I wanted to have that texture. And that led to the first group that I had when I left Miles’s band.”\n\nThose who like a dash of nostalgia with their pop-inflected music have multiple choices. The Midtown Men, a foursome who were in the original cast of Broadway’s “Jersey Boys,” will mix 1960s rock ’n’ roll hits with seasonal tunes at Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, at LIU Post in Brookville, on Dec. 6.\n\nA “girl-group” singer of the 1960s, Darlene Love, will offer both holiday standards and oldies at Landmark on Main Street, in Port Washington, on Dec. 8. This will be Ms. Love’s third holiday performance at Landmark, and it is sold out; there is a waiting list for tickets.\n\nAnother option at Landmark is Derrick Davis’s “A Christmas Journey,” coming up Dec. 2; the performer, an understudy in “The Lion King,” describes his holiday show, which includes dancers and a band, as a journey between “the secular and the sacred.”\n\nThe onetime Doobie Brother and multiple Grammy winner Michael McDonald, of the distinctive voice, performs at the Paramount in Huntington on Dec. 4, with his show “This Christmas, an Evening of Holiday and Hits.”\n\nThe Trans-Siberian Orchestra brings its rock opera, “The Lost Christmas Eve” — a pyrotechnic spectacle that draws from classical, folk, R & B and Broadway — to the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale on Dec. 20. The current tour of this work is billed as the last.\n\nThe Staller Center for the Arts, at Stony Brook University, is celebrating both the holidays and the 25th anniversary of its naming (after its major benefactors) with a concert on Dec. 15 by Wynton Marsalis and the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, along with Cécile McLorin Salvant, the 2010 winner of the Thelonius Monk International Jazz Vocals Competition. A limited number of seats were available at press time.\n\nThose dreaming of a crooning Christmas may find themselves reminiscing about Bing Crosby specials in “A Crosby Christmas,” at the Madison Theater at Molloy College in Rockville Centre, on Dec. 21. Hosted by Mr. Crosby’s widow, Kathryn, the show will feature Donna McKechnie (“A Chorus Line”) and other Broadway performers. (Toys brought by audience members will be put under the onstage tree; their destination is the Bethany House for homeless women and children in Nassau County.)\n\nThe Long Island Philharmonic offers a true musical mix, from Tchaikovsky (“Nutcracker” selections) to Irving Berlin, in its “Holiday Spectacular” on Dec. 1 at the Butler Building of the Mitchel Athletic Complex in Uniondale. The event is free, but tickets are required.\n\nAnother mix of musical-theater showstoppers and holiday favorites is in “Christmas on Broadway,” a revue with four singer-dancers at the Art Deco-era Suffolk Theater in Riverhead on Dec. 14 and 15.\n\nChristmas comes with an Irish lilt when Eileen Ivers, a virtuoso of Celtic fiddling, brings “An Nollaig — An Irish Christmas” to the YMCA Boulton Center for the Performing Arts in Bay Shore on Dec. 13. (The show is sold out, but there is a waiting list.) And it is gospel-inflected when members of the Bethel Concert Choir join the opening celebration in Westbury House at Old Westbury Gardens on the evening of Dec. 7 (tree lighting included). That concert is also sold out, but various other groups perform at Old Westbury on December weekends. And the Bethel choir will give free daytime performances on Dec. 7 at Roosevelt Field (main level court) and the Broadway Mall (center court) in Hicksville.\n\nAt the NYCB Theater at Westbury, the country music star Trace Adkins will be storytelling and caroling on Dec. 1; Kenny Rogers will perform his classic hits and holiday favorites on Dec. 4; and Paul Anka will sing his “Songs of December” and old hits (remember “Diana” and “Lonely Boy”?) on Dec. 7.\n\nIf Christmas is not Christmas without a full rendition of Handel’s “Messiah,” you can join the free Messiah Sing-Along at the Staller Center for the Arts at Stony Brook University on Dec. 8, or head to a performance by the venerable Cecilia Chorus of New York, making its Long Island debut, with orchestra, at Tilles Center on Dec. 15. The chorus of about 150 will be joined by the LIU Post Chorus, making for some 200 singers.\n\nIn another campus setting, the John Cranford Adams Playhouse at Hofstra University, the Hofstra University Choir and Hofstra String Orchestra will include seasonal songs in a Dec. 10 performance.\n\nThere is other choral music around, too. The Choral Society of the Hamptons, for example, will emphasize the theme of peace in two concerts, titled “In Terra Pax” (in tandem with the South Fork Chamber Orchestra), at the Bridgehampton Presbyterian Church on Dec. 8. The all-British program includes the concert’s titular work, by the 20th-century composer Gerald Finzi.\n\nThe Cathedral of the Incarnation in Garden City, seat of the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island, includes its full cathedral choirs, totaling 55 men, women and children, in its Festival of Lessons and Carols on Dec. 15. Accompanied by what is billed as the largest pipe organ on Long Island, they will sing carols from the 16th century to the present.\n\nAnd two pastiche works whose music is drawn from classical composers — a “Mass of the Composers” and the last act of an opera, “The Nativity” — both created by Bernard Kennedy, a Long Island resident, will be presented at the Madison Theater at Molloy College on Dec. 7.\n\nHanukkah came early this year, but some groups are celebrating it in their repertoire. Among them are the Adelphi Chorus and Adelphi Vocal Ensemble, which will offer two versions of “Maoz Tzur” (the original melody is widely known as “Rock of Ages”), as well as another Hanukkah tune, in a holiday celebration at Adelphi University, in Garden City, on Dec. 8; the internationally flavored concert also features festive music by the English composer Benjamin Britten and Christmas tunes from around the world.\n\nAnd the instrument-free vocal group Rockapella gives a nod to Kwanzaa with the song “Matunda Ya Kwanzaa,” as part of its program at the Boulton Center on Dec. 14.\n\nFor those shepherding young children through the season, the holiday concert of the Laurie Berkner Band, with its peppy folk-pop that keeps youngsters enthralled, might be good news; the group plays at Tilles Center on Dec. 1.\n\nWhat has to be among the most unusual locations for seasonal music is Bay Burger, a self-described burger joint in Sag Harbor, where the drummer and M.C. Claes Brondal will host musician-guests and then lead a free, jazz-oriented holiday jam session on Dec. 12; musicians, bring your portable instruments and holiday spirit.\n\n●\n\nWhere to Listen\n\nBAY SHORE YMCA Boulton Center for the Performing Arts, 37 West Main Street; (631) 969-1101 or boultoncenter.org.\n\nBRIDGEHAMPTON Choral Society of the Hamptons, at the Bridgehampton Presbyterian Church, 2429 Montauk Highway; (631) 204-9402 or choralsocietyofthehamptons.org.\n\nBROOKVILLE Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, LIU Post Campus, 720 Northern Boulevard; (516) 299-3100 or tillescenter.org.\n\nGARDEN CITY Cathedral of the Incarnation, 50 Cathedral Avenue; (516) 746-2955 or incarnationgc.org.\n\nGARDEN CITY Adelphi University Performing Arts Center, 1 South Avenue; (516) 877-4000 or aupac.adelphi.edu.\n\nHEMPSTEAD John Cranford Adams Playhouse, South Campus of Hofstra University, Hempstead Turnpike.

Information: thetheatreatwestbury.com.\n\nHis death was announced on his website.\n\nMr. Lateef started out as a tenor saxophonist with a big tone and a bluesy style, not significantly more or less talented than numerous other saxophonists in the crowded jazz scene of the 1940s. He served a conventional jazz apprenticeship, working in the bands of Lucky Millinder, Dizzy Gillespie and others. But by the time he made his first records as a leader, in 1957, he had begun establishing a reputation as a decidedly unconventional musician.\n\nHe began expanding his instrumental palette by doubling on flute, by no means a common jazz instrument in those years. He later added oboe, bassoon and non-Western wind instruments like the shehnai and arghul. “My attempts to experiment with new instruments grew out of the monotony of hearing the same old sounds played by the same old horns,” he once told DownBeat magazine. “When I looked into those other cultures, I found that good instruments existed there.”\n\nThose experiments led to an embrace of new influences. At a time when jazz musicians in the United States rarely sought inspiration any farther geographically than Latin America, Mr. Lateef looked well beyond the Western Hemisphere. Anticipating the cross-cultural fusions of later decades, he flavored his music with scales, drones and percussion effects borrowed from Asia and the Middle East. He played world music before world music had a name.\n\nIn later years he incorporated elements of contemporary concert music and composed symphonic and chamber works. African influences became more noticeable in his music when he spent four years studying and teaching in Nigeria in the early 1980s.\n\nMr. Lateef professed to find the word “jazz” limiting and degrading; he preferred “autophysiopsychic music,” a term he invented. He further distanced himself from the jazz mainstream in 1980 when he declared that he would no longer perform any place where alcohol was served. “Too much blood, sweat and tears have been spilled creating this music to play it where people are smoking, drinking and talking,” he explained to The Boston Globe in 1999.\n\nStill, with its emphasis on melodic improvisation and rhythmic immediacy, his music was always recognizably jazz at its core. And as far afield as his music might roam, his repertoire usually included at least a few Tin Pan Alley standards and, especially, plenty of blues.\n\nHe was born on Oct. 9, 1920, in Chattanooga, Tenn. Many sources give his birth name as William Evans, the name under which he performed and recorded before converting to Islam in the late 1940s (he belonged to the reformist Ahmadiyya Muslim Community) and changing his name to Yusef Abdul Lateef. But according to Mr. Lateef’s website, he was born William Emanuel Huddleston.\n\nWhen he was 5 his family moved to Detroit, where he went on to study saxophone at Miller High School. After spending most of the 1940s on the road as a sideman with various big bands, he returned to Detroit in 1950 to care for his ailing wife and ended up staying for a decade.\n\nWhile in Detroit he became a popular and respected fixture on the local nightclub scene and a mentor to younger musicians. He also resumed his studies, taking courses in flute and composition at Wayne State University and later studying oboe as well.\n\nIn the later part of the decade he began traveling regularly from Detroit to the East Coast with his working band to record for the Savoy and Prestige labels. By 1960 he had settled in New York, where he worked with Charles Mingus, Cannonball Adderley and the Nigerian percussionist Babatunde Olatunji before forming his own quartet in 1964.\n\nHe was soon a bona fide jazz star, with successful albums on the Impulse and Atlantic labels and a busy touring schedule. But he also remained a student, and he eventually became a teacher as well.\n\nHe received a bachelor’s and a master’s degree from the Manhattan School of Music, and taught both there and at Borough of Manhattan Community College in the 1970s. He earned a doctorate in education from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 1975 (his dissertation: “An Overview of Western and Islamic Education”) and later taught there and elsewhere in New England.\n\nThe more he studied, the more ambitious Mr. Lateef grew as a composer. He recorded his seven-movement “Symphonic Blues Suite” in 1970 and his “African-American Epic Suite,” a four-part work for quintet and orchestra, two decades later. His album “Yusef Lateef’s Little Symphony,” on which he played all the instruments via overdubbing, won a Grammy Award in 1988, though not in any of the jazz or classical categories; it was named best New Age performance. Mr. Lateef said at the time that, while he was grateful for the award, he didn’t know what New Age music was.\n\nIn 2010 he was named a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nMr. Lateef is survived by his wife, Ayesha; a son, Yusef; a granddaughter; and several great-grandchildren. His first wife, Tahira, died before him, as did a son and a daughter.\n\nHis creative output was not limited to music. He painted, wrote poetry and published several books of fiction. He also ran his own record company, YAL, which he established in 1992.\n\nHe remained musically active until a few months before his death. In April he appeared at Roulette in Brooklyn in a program titled “Yusef Lateef: Celebrating 75 Years of Music,” performing with the percussionist Adam Rudolph and presenting the premieres of two works, one for string quartet and the other for piano.\n\nFull reviews of recent jazz performances: nytimes.com/jazz.A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.\n\nEric Alexander Sextet (Friday through Wednesday) For his part in “Countdown: A John Coltrane Festival,” presented for the third year at Smoke, Eric Alexander, a neatly pressed but rigorous tenor saxophonist, teams up as usual with Harold Mabern, a veteran pianist.

(Nate Chinen)\n\nPeter and Will Anderson (through Dec. 29) The upstanding young torchbearers Peter and Will Anderson — also saxophonists, clarinetists, Juilliard alumni and identical twins — present a show called “Le Jazz Hot: How the French Saved Jazz.” The engagement, running through much of this month, will feature a quintet inspired by the music of Django Reinhardt, Sidney Bechet and others. Tuesdays through Thursdays at 7:30 p.m., Fridays at 8:30 p.m., Saturdays at 5:30 and 8:30 p.m., Sundays at 3:30 and 7:30 p.m., 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 753-5959, 59e59.org; $35, $24.50 for members. (Chinen)\n\n★ The Bad Plus (Tuesday through Jan. 5) Few groups in the greater jazz orbit sound more doggedly intrepid than the Bad Plus — Reid Anderson on bass, Ethan Iverson on piano, David King on drums — and few have done more to bring robust improvisational practice to audiences well outside that orbit. Somehow it seems only fitting that the band starts this weeklong run on New Year’s Eve. Tuesday at 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., Wednesday through Jan. 5 at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 and $30 cover, with a one-drink minimum; $150 on New Year’s Eve, which includes both sets and a $25 drink credit, with finger food and party favors.

As usual he has a slick but substantial band, and the clout to call on the occasional unbilled celebrity guest. At 8 and 10:30 p.m.; New Year’s Eve at 7 and 10 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $75 cover at tables, $40 at the bar, with a $5 minimum; on New Year’s Eve: $145 at tables, $85 at the bar for the 7 p.m. set and $175 at tables and $95 at the bar for the 10 p.m. set.

(Chinen)\n\n★ Wynton Marsalis Septet (Friday through Tuesday) Every now and again the artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center steps into the center spotlight as a composer-bandleader, reminding everyone why he became such a force in the first place. Taking over the organization’s in-house club, Wynton Marsalis regroups the ensemble with which he has made some of his finest albums, like “The Marciac Suite,” from 2000. It’s a special booking, with a special price structure: $125 per person includes $35 cover and a tax-deductible contribution of $90 (except of course on New Year’s Eve, when you’ll drop a cool $375 for the 7:30 p.m. set and $550 for the 11 p.m. set). At 7 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org. (Chinen)\n\nOpen Loose (Saturday) Mark Helias is a bassist equally committed to the causes of momentum and texture, and in that sense he has a very good thing in Open Loose, a band with Tony Malaby on tenor saxophone and Tom Rainey on drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, corneliastreetcafe.com, (212) 989-9319; $10 cover, with $10 minimum. (Chinen)\n\nTom Rainey Trio (Monday) Tom Rainey, a drummer of far-ranging experience, has broken into bandleading in recent years, often with the two partners in this trio: Ingrid Laubrock, a tenor and soprano saxophonist of exploratory instincts, and Mary Halvorson, a guitarist with a sharp-splintered but flexible attack. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $10 cover, with $10 minimum. (Chinen)\n\nDan Weiss Percussion Fest (Thursday through Jan. 4) Dan Weiss is a drummer of adaptable flow and microscopic focus, as he has shown in a range of settings. He has programmed three nights of percussive expedition, beginning on Thursday with this well-honed duo featuring the guitarist Miles Okazaki. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $10 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)\n\n★ Kenny Werner Quintet (Thursday through Jan. 5) A well-seasoned pianist who tempers fearsome technique with abundant wit, Kenny Werner digs in here not only with a fierce rhythm section — Scott Colley on bass, Ari Hoenig on drums — but also with a front line consisting of the trumpeter Randy Brecker and the saxophonist David Sánchez. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $35 to $45 cover, with a $5 minimum; $20 and $25 for students. (Chinen)\n\nDr. Michael White and the Original Liberty Jazz Band (Friday through Sunday) The New Orleans clarinetist and cultural historian Dr. Michael White views a traditional repertory as something rich to be savored, as he demonstrates on “Adventures in New Orleans Jazz,” released in two volumes over the last couple of years. His signature band returns to its customary late-December residency at the Village Vanguard, though it has ceded New Year’s Eve to the Bad Plus, a more contemporary crew. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 and $30 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)\n\n★ John Zorn Improv Night (Friday through Sunday) Noise is the currency at a John Zorn improv party, which can feature any number of intrepid and open-minded musicians. Among the participants: the multireedists Marty Ehrlich and Chris Speed; the guitarists Thurston Moore and Mary Halvorson; and the percussionists Adam Rudolph and Billy Martin. At 8 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; $25. (Chinen)\n\nJON PARELES\n\nNINE INCH NAILS Barclays Center, Oct. 14. Trent Reznor’s restarted Nine Inch Nails could have pleased fans by just blasting out the hits. But he also wanted to plunge into the antsy electronics, dance-music undercurrents and levels of self-doubt on Nine Inch Nails’ 2013 album, “Hesitation Marks.” And he did, with human factors (including female voices) and a 3-D video onslaught surrounding the musicians. It was the year’s most overwhelming arena spectacle.\n\nBEYONCé Izod Center, East Rutherford, N.J., July 31. Lavish, perfectionistic and full of soulful singing amid its frantic choreography, Beyoncé's “The Mrs. Carter Show” tour still had a warm heart. It wasn’t about admiring the superhuman diva onstage; it was about how she would be a poised cheerleader for all the grown-up, independent, imperfect Everywomen listening and singing along.\n\nMY BLOODY VALENTINE Hammerstein Ballroom, Nov. 12. Touring after the release of “m b v,” its first album since 1991, My Bloody Valentine calmly pulverized every band that puts “shoegaze” in its online profile. The music sounded louder than it was because distortion blanketed the frequency spectrum, and the pitch kept heaving and sliding, a tempest of instability above a relentless beat. Video completed a gorgeous overload.\n\nCARLINHOS BROWN Campo Grande, Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, Feb. 10. This was sociopolitical. Carlinhos Brown, a hit songwriter who is also an advocate of Afro-Brazilian culture, gathered nearly all of the blocos Afros — percussion groups that double as neighborhood improvement associations in Salvador, the capital of Bahia — to parade together in support of building an Afródromo, a new and media-friendly carnival circuit. Some 15,000 costumed drummers and dancers took to the streets, booming a message to the government.\n\nANNETTE PEACOCK Whitney Museum of American Art, April 26. At her first New York City show in more than a decade, the jazz songwriter, singer and keyboardist Annette Peacock took her time delivering her cerebral, quizzical songs about love and longing. They’re full of odd melodic leaps with sultry follow-ups, and of harmonies that take chromatic detours and don’t always neatly resolve. She lingered over the songs as if she were thinking through every verbal and musical convolution on the spot.\n\nMILFORD GRAVES Vision Festival, Roulette, June 12. This year’s festival started with a tribute to the drummer Milford Graves, at 72, that worked him hard. He played three sets with three groups to sum up his career: from his start in Afro-Cuban jazz to poetry with jazz (with Amiri Baraka) and full-tilt group improvisation. Mr. Graves pushed and reacted to the music with playful precision, creating momentum and counterpoint while dismantling patterns before they began.\n\nRuby Washington/The New York Times\n\nCHRISTINE SALEM Symphony Space, Oct 4. Christine Salem is a champion of maloya, traditional music from Réunion, a French island in the Indian Ocean. Using voices and percussion, brisk rhythms and chanted melodies that can sound like relatives of the blues, maloya can be trance music to communicate with ancestors or a danceable message of survival. Ms. Salem’s deep, gutsy voice made it both of those, and more.\n\nBLACK DICE Grand Prospect Hall, Brooklyn, May 25. With a savage, sardonic 37-minute set, Black Dice sabotaged the 1980s punk-disco-electro nostalgia sharing the extensive lineup of the Red Bull Music Academy’s “12 Years of DFA Records.” The group had its own loops — nasty, distorted, abrasive, funny — and changed them up too often for anyone to get comfortable. It was dance music with an obnoxious streak: real punk-disco.\n\nGHALIA BENALI World Nomads Tunisia festival, French Institute/Alliance Française, May 15. The singer and songwriter Ghalia Benali was part of this illuminating festival. Her songs were rhapsodic, self-invented myths of romance and otherness, rooted in the earthy melodies of Middle Eastern folk music but connected all around the Mediterranean and beyond; her band had musicians who also play jazz. Passionate and cosmopolitan, personal and sometimes abstract, it was a global fusion that didn’t start from a Western perspective.\n\nKANYE WEST Governors Ball, Randalls Island, June 9. Before he released “Yeezus,” Kanye West brought that album’s knockdown bluntness and contrary mentality to a nonstage stage show. For most of it, Mr. West was on a platform in the audience, shouting his rhymes with visceral, sweaty insistence. It was a perfectly orchestrated tantrum — far better paced than the messianic filibuster he brought to arenas in the fall.\n\nBEN RATLIFF\n\nEYEHATEGOD Saint Vitus, Nov. 14. This 25-year-old New Orleans slow-metal band lost its founding-member drummer, Joey LaCaze, to respiratory failure on Aug. 23. By late October, it was on the road again. Two weeks later, with the new drummer Aaron Hill, it played a stunning set of many songs that seemed to coalesce into one long one — a kind of dense, zoned-out hymn — with few chords but many diversions and doglegs, tempo and accent shifts, moments of sudden power.\n\nKIM GORDON WITH I.U.D. Issue Project Room, Nov. 14. Ms. Gordon, once of Sonic Youth and now of Body/Head, collaborated on guitar for one performance with the New York two-percussionist band I.U.D. — decentralized but coherent, chaotic but powerful, confident and hard to parse.\n\nHarry Allen Quartet (Friday) Ebullient swing is always a priority for the tenor saxophonist Harry Allen, who displays a breezy familiarity with midcentury modern conventions. His quartet includes the pianist Rossano Sportiello, the bassist Joel Forbes and the drummer Kevin Kanner. At 8 and 10 p.m., Jazz at Kitano, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119, kitano.com; $30 cover, with a $15 minimum. (Nate Chinen)\n\nWessell Anderson Sextet (Monday and Tuesday) Wessell Anderson, colloquially known as Warmdaddy, is an alto saxophonist with a tart sound and a bluesy, charismatic style. A charter member of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, he’s back on friendly turf with this sextet. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $35 cover, with a $5 minimum; $15 for students. (Chinen)\n\n★ The Bad Plus (Friday through Sunday) Few groups in the greater jazz orbit sound more doggedly intrepid than the Bad Plus — Reid Anderson on bass, Ethan Iverson on piano, David King on drums — and few have done more to bring robust improvisational practice to audiences well outside that orbit. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 and $30 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)\n\nChris Botti (Friday through Sunday) Mr. Botti, whose adult-pop savvy and controlled but brooding trumpet sound have made him a high-gloss global superstar, descends on the Blue Note each year around this time for an extended run. As usual he has a slick but substantial band, and the clout to call on the occasional unbilled celebrity guest. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $75 cover at tables, $40 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)\n\n★ Henry Butler, Steve Bernstein & the Hot 9 (Friday through Sunday) Mr. Butler, a New Orleans pianist with a knack for percussive prestidigitation, teams up with the trumpeter-arranger Steven Bernstein and a crack ensemble that includes Charlie Burnham on violin, Curtis Fowlkes on trombone and Erik Lawrence on baritone and soprano saxophones. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set on Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $30 and $35. (Chinen)\n\n★ Kris Davis’s Infrasound (Monday) Ms. Davis, one of the more reliably compelling pianists to emerge within the last decade, has proved her salt as a large-ensemble arranger, notably on “Novela,” a recent album by the saxophonist Tony Malaby. With Infrasound, which has its premiere here, she enlists four bass clarinetists (Joachim Badenhorst, Andrew Bishop, Ben Goldberg and Oscar Noriega) alongside a rhythm section that includes the guitarist Nate Radley, the accordionist and organist Gary Versace, and the drummer Jim Black. At 8 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, near Third Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, (917) 267-0363, roulette.org; $20, $15 for students.

(Chinen)\n\n★ Mary Halvorson Quartet (Saturday) Mary Halvorson, a guitarist fond of smart ungainliness and prickly fluency, recently delved into chamberlike ensemble territory with a vivid album titled “Illusionary Sea.” For this concert she leads a working quintet anchored by the bassist John Hébert and the drummer Ches Smith, and featuring a front line of Jonathan Finlayson on trumpet and Jon Irabagon on alto saxophone. At 9 p.m., BAMcafé, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; free. (Chinen)\n\nFrank Kimbrough Trio (Thursday) A daring and harmonically literate pianist, Frank Kimbrough extemporizes with equal concern for melody and abstraction. His partners for this concert, part of the Sound It Out series, are the bassist Masa Kamaguchi and the drummer Jeff Hirshfield, who appear on “Rumors,” a casually sumptuous album recorded on short notice several years ago. At 8 p.m., Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 242-4770, greenwichhouse.org; $15, $12 for students. (Chinen)\n\n★ Rudresh Mahanthappa at the Stone (Tuesday through Jan. 12) Mr. Mahanthappa, an alto saxophonist who has made a project of expressive cultural hybridism, will be in residence at the Stone next week, working three nights apiece with two distinctive bands. The first of those is his Bird Project, inspired by Charlie Parker but hardly bound by idiomatic fealty; its dynamic rhythmic foundation will be the work of Matt Mitchell on piano, François Moutin on bass and Rudy Royston on drums. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; $15 per set; $10 for students. (Chinen)\n\nChristian McBride Big Band (Tuesday through Jan. 12) This spit-and-polish outfit, which won a recent Grammy for best large jazz ensemble album, thrives on the robust energies of its namesake bassist-bandleader. It’ll be the first of two weeks with his name on the Village Vanguard marquee; the second, starting Jan. 14, will feature his effervescent trio. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 to $30 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)\n\nOn the Frontlines (Thursday) The title of this triple bill has as much to do with band dynamics as with battle metaphors: organized by the trumpeter John Raymond, it will feature three groups led by intrepid young horn players. Up first, at 7 p.m., is Sound Quartet, a project of the tenor saxophonist Tivon Pennicott; at 8:15 p.m., Mr. Raymond presents a quartet featuring Gilad Hekselman on guitar. And at 9:30 p.m. the trombonist Ryan Keberle augments his fine band Catharsis with a pair of guests, Camila Meza on vocals and Clarence Penn on drums.

(Chinen)\n\n★ Kurt Rosenwinkel New Quartet (Wednesday through Jan. 12) The guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel favors floating lyricism, a luminous tone and an ultramodern harmonic language, all reasons for his stature as one of the young gurus on his instrument. As on “Star of Jupiter,” his most recent album, he’ll lead an adaptable band featuring the pianist Aaron Parks and the bassist Eric Revis. (Kendrick Scott steps in for Justin Faulkner on drums.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set next Friday and Jan. 11, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $25 and $30.

He has programmed three nights of percussive expedition here, the second of which, on Friday, will feature Mr. Weiss on tabla with the Hindustani classical vocalist Samarth Nagarkar.

(Chinen)\n\n“Dave has played on six continents,” his manager, Richie Bonilla, said proudly. “He is alone in his class.”\n\nNow, he is mostly alone in his home. A stroke during a gig in March 2012 left him paralyzed on his right side, unable to walk, talk or lift his playing hand. Though he has recovered about 85 percent of his abilities, several fingers on his right hand are numb, and he cannot hold up his flute for long. Instead, he spends his days in a rented bungalow in Harding Park, a warren of twisty streets along the East River in the Bronx.\n\nHe moved to this neighborhood because it was quiet and secluded, a haven for a world-traveling musician with more than a dozen albums and a Grammy to his name. He shares the home with his cats, Mambo, Bomba and Plena — “good cats, they leave my stuff alone” — and his instruments. He was a familiar sight in the neighborhood, buying a breakfast sandwich at a bodega each morning, then heading home to watch the news and practice.\n\nBut for someone recovering from a catastrophic illness, and with no savings or health insurance, living in his dimly lighted bungalow is like being in exile from fans, friends and the rhythms of everyday life.\n\nSome days are good. Some days are not.\n\n“How do I manage?” Mr. Valentin, 61, responded when he was asked how he was coping. “I have to. I can’t play. It’s rough. There’s a lot of depression and stuff like that. Sometimes I pick up my flute and play a few notes. I tried to play ‘Blackbird’ not that long ago. I couldn’t even talk at first. At least now I can.”\n\nHe shifted on the sofa.\n\n“People come to visit, but it can be hard,” he said.\n\nHis manager chimed in.\n\n“There’s too much alone time,” Mr. Bonilla said. “He needs a home attendant. I arranged to get him Meals on Wheels because all he was eating were sandwiches. Maybe somebody can send over a paella from City Island.”\n\nCigar smoke and silence hung in the living room. The silence was unusual for Mr. Valentin, who loved joking around so much that his manager said he could have been a stand-up comic.\n\n“No, I would be a teacher,” Mr. Valentin corrected him. “I taught seventh-, eighth- and ninth-grade music for three years in the South Bronx. I had a jazz band and taught them how to play, so when they graduated they were ready. Those were good times.”\n\nMr. Bonilla changed the topic, reminding his friend of the latest batch of handwritten thank-you notes he was sending out. Donations, some handled by the Jazz Foundation of America, have come from the famous and the unknown, some as little as $5. Each is acknowledged by Mr. Bonilla, since Mr. Valentin cannot write.\n\nMr. Bonilla has helped his friend and client with everything from fund-raising benefits to applications for subsidized housing and social services. Although the most recent benefit concert included stars like Paquito D’Rivera, it cost more to stage than it raised. An earlier donation of $10,000, from the Puerto Rican city of Mayagüez, which also honored Mr. Valentin with the key to the city, helped prevent further financial calamity.\n\nMr. Bonilla, who manages many of the top Latin musicians, lamented how Mr. Valentin was like other artists of his generation, not counting on, much less planning for, retirement or illness. After a career that would be envied by many, Mr. Valentin must now find cheaper housing — something priced at roughly a third of the $1,800 he now pays in monthly rent and utilities.\n\nWhat little money he has will run out by March.\n\n“It’s been a struggle to keep up with the bills,” said Mr. Bonilla, who is still waiting to hear about a recent application for housing for older adults. “We don’t know when he will be back onstage.”\n\nAlthough Mr. Valentin has been widely recorded, jazz royalties are hardly the foundation of a retirement plan. The money, such as it was, had always been in playing onstage.\n\n“He was always busy,” Mr. Bonilla said. “He was going to Indonesia, Australia —”\n\nMr. Valentin cut him off.\n\n“That’s over,” he said. “Over! Now it’s just starting again from scratch.”\n\nhttp://nyti.ms/1eNbj5P\n\nSee next articlesSee previous articles\n\nHome Page\n\nWorld\n\nU.S.\n\nNew York\n\nBusiness\n\nOpinion\n\nSports\n\nScience\n\nArts\n\nFashion & Style\n\nCrosswords\n\nVideo\n\nOlympics\n\nLexey Swall for The New York Times\n\nWASHINGTON â Max Roach, the great drummer and bandleader and paradigm-shifter of jazz, though he disliked that word, never finished an autobiography.\n\nThatâs a shame. He died in 2007 at 83, and his career spans the beginning of bebop, the intersection of jazz with the civil rights movement, free improvisation, and jazzâs current state of cross-disciplinary experiments and multimedia performances. Inasmuch as jazz is about change and resistance, he embodied those qualities: He fought anything that would contain or reduce him as an artist and a human being. He would have been well served by his own narrative, set in one voice.\n\nBut Roach was archivally minded, and, when he died, he left 400 linear feet of his life and actions to be read: scores and lead sheets, photographs, contracts, itineraries, correspondence, reel tapes and cassettes and drafts of an unfinished autobiography, written with the help of Amiri Baraka. On Monday, the Library of Congress will announce that it has acquired the archive from Mr. Roachâs family and that it will be made available to researchers.\n\nâWhat I think he would hope people would see,â said the violist Maxine Roach, his daughter from his first marriage, âis that there was a lot about his life that was difficult, you know? The struggles. A lot about economics, and jazz as a word that we didnât define ourselves.â (Roach felt that it was a pejorative term; he preferred to call it African-American music.)\n\nâBut aside from all of that,â she continued, âI hope that people see his excellence and his mastery of his skill, which helped him rise in this country thatâs been so hard on black men especially, and how he went through it and what price he paid.â\n\nI went through some of the archive last week in advance of its public unveiling â only a little, but enough to know that it contains the material for understanding how Roach saw himself and how those close to him saw him. We donât have all the answers yet, but perhaps we can start asking the question, what needs to be better understood about Max Roach?\n\nHow he constructed his style, which brought together the wholeness of the drum kit rather than any specific part of it, let you hear tuning and touch, and expanded the notion of the drum solo as a truly narrative art might be the hardest one to address. (Perhaps the Roach-Baraka manuscript will help.)\n\nWhat might be more easily understood is the nature of his friendships and correspondences with figures including Maya Angelou and Nina Simone, and his passions and causes, from the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa to the obscure Philadelphia pianist Hassan Ibn Ali, with whom he made a fascinating record for Atlantic in 1964. (Thereâs an hourlong tape in the collection of Ali playing solo piano in Roachâs apartment, some of which I heard, and several letters from him.) There is also a one-sentence telegram that Roach sent to Gov. Nelson Rockefeller after the Attica uprising in 1971: âDoes your belief that prisoners are not human justify the loss of 42 lives?â\n\nThere is even some material â a radio jingle, an advertisement mock-up â on Afro Kola, a short-lived soft drink in which Roach was an investor; his son, the actor Daryl Roach, who worked for the company in the summer of 1968, recalled that it was quickly bought by Coca-Cola and then vanished.\n\nRoach was a natural figurehead: He had an instinct to lead, to politicize, to ask uncomfortable questions of politicians and club owners and journalists; to run an independent record label pretty much before musicians did that kind of thing (Debut, owned and operated with Charles Mingus from 1952 to 1957); and to collaborate with playwrights and visual artists.\n\nHe stressed that jazz functioned within a larger picture of African-American expression and a history of survival. âBeyond his music,â Daryl Roach said, âI think Dad grew to understand that things donât happen in a vacuum â they happen out of a sociopolitical and economic context.â\n\nHe had his own economic context, of course, and the collection contains plenty of documents of business transactions related to club dates and recordings; there are contracts and papers from his time with the Clifford Brown-Max Roach Quintet in the mid-1950s, for example. Brown died in a car accident in 1956; the archives tell you, among other things, what the ensemble was being paid in the months leading up to the end, when they might have been the greatest jazz group in America: $500 for two nights at Basin Street, in the East 40s in Manhattan, that year; $900 for six days at the Cafe Bohemia in Greenwich Village; $203 for Roach, and $150.76 for each sideman, for one night at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. Such details might seem inconsequential, but theyâre important: They help us reconstruct exactly when and where the group played and how its work was valued.\n\nThere are fascinating letters from Mingus to Roach after the dissolution of Debut Records: This was a close and complicated relationship. In one written in February 1961, Mingus commends Roach for his wariness of the British-born jazz patroness Nica de Koenigswarter; emotionally and incredulously, he reports of her stated disdain for Patrice Lumumba, the leader of the Congolese independence movement, who had been recently killed.\n\nAnother letter dated three days later angrily asks Roach for $1,230 owed him. He compares him to Miles Davis, summing them up the same way: âdress right, pose right, and appear cold.â Above his signature, he wrote âHate.â Three months later, Roach interrupted a Davis concert at Carnegie Hall, a benefit for the African Research Foundation, whose politics he questioned; he picketed outside and eventually climbed onstage with a sign reading âAfrica for the Africans.â The collection contains photos of all that, too.\n\nAdmiration, invective, scrutiny â the sense you get is of a man determined enough to take it all.\n\nMore on nytimes.com\n\n© 2014The New York Times Company\n\nContact Us\n\nWork With Us\n\nAdvertise\n\nYour Ad Choices\n\nPrivacy\n\nTerms of Service\n\nTerms of Sale\n\nSite Map\n\nHelp\n\nSite Feedback\n\nSubscriptions\n\nhttp://nyti.ms/1ejZFjz\n\nSee next articlesSee previous articles\n\nHome Page\n\nWorld\n\nU.S.\n\nNew York\n\nBusiness\n\nOpinion\n\nSports\n\nScience\n\nArts\n\nFashion & Style\n\nCrosswords\n\nVideo\n\nOlympics\n\nFull reviews of recent jazz performances: nytimes.com/jazz.A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.\n\nâ John Abercrombie Quartet (Friday through Sunday) The guitarist John Abercrombie takes a measured, self-possessed approach to improvisation, so much so that itâs easy to underestimate the considerable chance taking in his playing. He appears here with the same sterling rhythm team as on â39 Steps,â his fine album from last year: Marc Copland on piano, Drew Gress on bass and Joey Baron on drums.

(Chinen)\n\nRon Carter Quartet (Tuesday through Feb. 9) Ron Carter, one of jazzâs most highly regarded bassists, tends to favor polish over power in his small-group work, but that doesnât mean his bands lack a vital spark. This one shouldnât, anyway: it features a smartly intuitive pianist, Renee Rosnes, along with the drummer Payton Crossley and the percussionist Rolando Morales-Matos.

(Chinen)\n\nâ Marc Ribot at the Stone (Friday through Sunday) Marc Ribot, whose persuasively prickly guitar playing has long been a protean feature of the downtown scene, has been in residence at the Stone this week, seeking revelation with a series of partners. On Friday, he plays an 8 p.m. set with voice and guitar, featuring a full band, and at the same time on Saturday he will perform a solo set for voice and guitar. A 10 p.m. set on Friday will feature the bassist Henry Grimes, the drummer Chad Taylor and his fellow guitarist Mary Halvorson; at 10 p.m. on Saturday heâll work with Mr. Grimes, Mr. Taylor and the multi-instrumentalist Cooper-Moore.

His new album, âFrom Water,â is a solo clarinet recording, though it often sounds lush and layered, by way of his work with sampled loops. He will revisit that format, and the albumâs aquatic premise, in these two solo concerts.

Each paper item is cataloged, kept in a separate envelope and stored in one of the filing cabinets located throughout both of his homes.\n\nâIâm always on the hunt for old music, especially stuff that is now out of print,â Mr. Giordano said. âI have already cleaned out three old movie theaters, in Buffalo, St. Louis and New Jersey, that used sheet music and band arrangements for stage shows.â\n\nâItâs called preservation,â he added.\n\nIn the home where Mr. Giordano lives, over 1,000 piano rolls are neatly displayed inside the cubbyholes of a giant wall unit.\n\nâPiano rolls were once a form of entertainment,â he said on a recent afternoon. âPeople would gather around pianos and have singalongs to the hit tunes of the early days.â\n\nRemnants of those early days were gathered around Mr. Giordano as he sat in his living room alongside entertaining company: a large tuba, a bass saxophone, a string bass and a Steinway player piano from the 1920s. A drum set from that same era hung from the ceiling above a Victrola that has been spinning records for more than a century.\n\nMr. Giordano later went up to his bedroom and dropped a thick shellac record on a phonograph, literally cranking up a tune called âSunrise and Youâ by the Max Fells Della Robbia Orchestra.\n\nâThe beauty of this phonograph is that it is all mechanical,â he said proudly. âEven if you lost all electricity, you can still play your record.â\n\nMr. Giordano, who is 61 and divorced and who speaks with the quiet ease of a priest in a confession booth, is not ashamed to admit that he is married to his profession.\n\nâBig-band music, I love it, I have always loved it,â he said. âIt comes from a time when people really didnât have a lot of things; they didnât have iPhones and computers. They just went out and had a great time, and the music that I play is reflective of that time.â\n\nHe soon began fine-tuning arrangements for a one-night performance on Feb. 12 at Town Hall on West 43rd Street in Manhattan. There, Mr. Giordano and his band, the Nighthawks, will honor the 90th anniversary of George Gershwinâs composition âRhapsody in Blue,â which was introduced on Feb. 12, 1924, at Aeolian Hall, which was also on 43rd Street.\n\nThe concert will also feature the music of the composers Irving Berlin, Victor Herbert, Jerome Kern and Zez Confrey.\n\nâItâs one of the great thrills in my life to be able to salute a very important piece of music and all these great composers,â Mr. Giordano said. â âRhapsody in Blueâ is a part of the music that would eventually change the world, as it was the first serious work of a combination of jazz and classical music.â\n\nMr. Giordanoâs band won a Grammy Award in 2011 for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media, on Martin Scorseseâs âBoardwalk Empire,â which appears on HBO.\n\nâI also played the role of a bandleader on Boardwalk who gets to yell out the key word, âprohibition,â â Mr. Giordano said. âMr. Scorsese had me shout that word, prohibition, 42 times. I said âMr. Scorsese, please I canât say it anymore.â He kept saying, âTry it again Vince, keep trying it again.â â\n\nThrough the years, Mr. Giordano has lent his music and acting talents to a number of other projects, including Francis Ford Coppolaâs âCotton Clubâ and Mr. Scorseseâs âAviator,â and he has worked on a half-dozen Woody Allen soundtracks. The Nighthawks, who were formed in 1976, have worked together on the soundtracks of Robert De Niroâs âGood Shepherdâ and Michael Mannâs âPublic Enemies.â\n\nMr. Giordano was born in Brooklyn and was 2 when his family moved to Smithtown, on Long Island, where he grew up perfecting the art of playing the bass saxophone, tuba and string bass. He became interested in big-band music when his grandmother let him play records on her Victrola.\n\nâThe sounds coming out of that old machine, wow,â said Mr. Giordano, suddenly speaking in a higher key. âI was hooked.â\n\nMusic became his life â and his obsession. Evidence can be found in the framed photographs that sit atop his coffee tables and cover the walls of his single-family home. They are photos not of family members, but of jazz icons like Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Fletcher Henderson, Fats Waller, Miles Davis and Benny Goodman.\n\nâThese are all my gods,â Mr. Giordano said. âI often look up to the heavens and ask them, âHow am I doing?â â\n\nStanding in the basement of his second home, Mr. Giordano pulled a piece of sheet music from a filing cabinet.\n\nâNow look at this great piece by Gershwin from 1933; itâs called âOn and On and On,â â he said. âThat pretty much sums up my music collection, my career and big-band music in general: It just goes on and on and on.â\n\nMore on nytimes.com\n\n© 2014The New York Times Company\n\nContact Us\n\nWork With Us\n\nAdvertise\n\nYour Ad Choices\n\nPrivacy\n\nTerms of Service\n\nTerms of Sale\n\nSite Map\n\nHelp\n\nSite Feedback\n\nSubscriptions\n\nhttp://nyti.ms/1cVUrua\n\nSee next articlesSee previous articles\n\nHome Page\n\nWorld\n\nU.S.\n\nNew York\n\nBusiness\n\nOpinion\n\nSports\n\nScience\n\nArts\n\nFashion & Style\n\nCrosswords\n\nVideo\n\nOlympics\n\nJacob Blickenstaff for The New York Times\n\nThe first and last sounds on “303,” Rudy Royston’s sit-up-and-take-notice debut album, involve a tranquil, mysterious, cooled-out funk groove, like an interlude on an early-2000s neo-soul production. Anchored by a soulfully simple bass vamp, with a smoky overlay of horns and guitar, the tune — “Mimi Sunrise,” an opener that resurfaces as a hidden track — calls barely any attention to Mr. Royston’s specific purview, which is drumming. There’ll be time for all that, he seems to imply.\n\nAnother rewarding new album by a jazz drummer, Ulysses Owens Jr.’s “Onward & Upward,” opens and closes on a beat, with no pretense of melody. In the punch and clatter of those tracks — an intro framed by flamenco handclaps and a “Drum Postlude” built around a Bernard Purdie shuffle— Mr. Owens draws an immediate focus on the function of his instrument, as if issuing an urgent bulletin.\n\nA third approach plays out on “Time’s Tales,” by the Jeff Ballard Trio: yet another new album signaling a drummer’s move to the foreground. There are no bookends here, unless you count the intuitive stir of Mr. Ballard’s rapport with the West African guitarist Lionel Loueke and the Puerto Rican alto saxophonist Miguel Zenón.\n\nSamuel Dietz/Redferns, via Getty Images\n\nBy now, it’s a given that jazz drummers hold the key to tracking the evolution of the music. But their lexicon holds so many variations of style, adapted from myriad sources outside jazz, that it can seem ungraspable on the whole. The drummer-led albums released this week don’t begin to resolve the issue, but together they offer a snapshot of mainstream conventions, and not just in the area of rhythm.\n\nAll three albums feature serious, style-blending guitarists and brisk, authoritative saxophonists. Each album has at least one reworked pop song, and two of the three have a piece from the classical canon. The original compositions reflect both a firm foothold in modern jazz and a poplike elevation of melody. On each album, there’s a streamlined take on carnival rhythm. And in every case, there’s a careful regulation of ensemble dynamics, informed by innumerable hours logged as a sideman.\n\nMr. Royston, 43, is the breakout story of the three. An alert and powerful drummer, he has emerged as a first-tier talent, especially in the last six years. The excellent band on his album includes the unflappable saxophonist Jon Irabagon, a fellow member of the current Dave Douglas Quintet, and the exacting trumpeter Nadje Noordhuis, who hasn’t had a better showcase apart from her own recent debut. The guitarist is Nir Felder, and the pianist is Sam Harris: strong voices in ascendance. Strikingly, there are two bassists, Yasushi Nakamura and Mimi Jones. (“Mimi Sunrise” was named after her.)\n\nIt is, perhaps, not the happiest week for flying Denver colors. But by naming “303” (Greenleaf) after his old area code, Mr. Royston recalls his own history there, notably under the guidance of the deeply lyrical trumpeter Ron Miles. “Miles to Go (Sunset Road)” is a brooding nod to that influence; “Goodnight Kinyah,” a glowingly earnest waltz with gospel underpinnings, suggests it a little more obliquely.\n\nElsewhere, Mr. Royston pursues a more rough-and-tumble style. “Play on Words” and “Bownze” are syncopated knockouts, and the title track moves from a cool idyll to a combustive clamor. Mr. Royston, who does end up flexing his chops on the album, composed every piece but two, by Mozart (“Ave Verum Corpus”) and Radiohead (“High and Dry”).\n\nJacob Blickenstaff for The New York Times\n\nThe analogous moves on Mr. Owens’s album include a head-bobbing cover of the Stylistics’ “People Make the World Go Round,” with vocals by Charles Turner; and a trio version of “Human Nature,” the Michael Jackson hit. Neither is a total win — the arrangement for “Human Nature” skews uncomfortably close to the one favored by the Vijay Iyer Trio — but still, point taken. Mr. Owens isn’t a purist.\n\nHis background explains why he might need to stress that idea. At 31, he has been heard backing the singer Kurt Elling and others, but his flagship affiliation is with the bassist Christian McBride, in a trio and big band that both stand on a bedrock of tradition. “Onward & Upward” (D-Clef) is named after a signoff by the pianist Mulgrew Miller, another keeper of the flame, and includes a few tracks in that lineage.\n\nBut Mr. Owens, leading a group with Jason Palmer on trumpet, Michael Dease on trombone and Anat Cohen on tenor saxophone and clarinet, also makes a show of stretching out. On “SST,” his whiplash drumming propels a pair of expeditious solos, by the guitarist Gilad Hekselman and the pianist Christian Sands. It’s a modest departure, but for Mr. Owens as well as Mr. Sands, his younger partner in the Christian McBride Trio, it has the ring of other liberties ahead.\n\nOn “Time’s Tales” (OKeh), the best album of the bunch, any trace of inhibition has already been shed. Mr. Ballard, 50, has been a force in jazz for about half his lifetime. It’s only technically accurate to call this his debut, since he’s the de facto leader of Fly, a nimble collective with several superb albums. And as with that trio, this one sidesteps any hierarchies that stand in the way of cohesive parity.\n\nStill, Mr. Ballard puts his stamp on the music, magically evoking the drum corps of a New Orleans brass band on “Beat Street” and basking in complex polyrhythm on Mr. Loueke’s “Virgin Forest.” Mr. Loueke and Mr. Zenón express themselves completely, bringing the same spryness and discovery to an abstracted Bartók theme as to a Cuban bolero. Essaying “The Man I Love,” the Gershwin tune, they create a slow, breathing pulse; they start in a similar mode on “Free 3,” the spontaneous invention that closes the album.\n\nSomewhere in between comes a cover of “Hangin’ Tree,” by the hard-rock band Queens of the Stone Age, startling in this context both for its gnarled distortion and its grinding, jagged meter. By the time Mr. Zenón enters with the melody, in a calmly imploring tone, it’s clear that the trio is bringing the full measure of its rigor.
