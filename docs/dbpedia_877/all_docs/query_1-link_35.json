        "text": "I went to Budapest for spring break — to introduce a photo exhibit by my Transylvanian-bornÂ friend Â SÃ¡nta IstvÃ¡n Csaba and help jury theÂ 10th annual MÃ¼pa Budapest Jazz Showcase/Talent Exchange,Â held in the modernist musemÂ and multi-theater complex on the east bank of the icy Danube Feb 3 – 5.\n\nAs I wrote in my Â DownBeat article, the sound of the 12 sets I heard was jazz as we think of itÂ now — virtuosic horns, piano/keyboards and/or guitar, upright or electric basses and drums; vocalistsÂ singing standards, spicing upÂ r&b grooves, toying with electronics; popular rhythmsÂ addressed through personal perspectives.\n\nThere was a faint aura of the music of the Roma — gypsies — in the air, emanating not only from the quartetsÂ led byÂ pianist Gyula Balogh and drummer Toni SnÃ©tberger, withÂ members from that community. It was hard to define — no overtÂ Django Reinhardt,Â figurations or repertoire, but a tinge ofÂ darkness and interiority in those bands, and what I imagined was witchy wailing by singer Petra KÃ©sz with her performance art-like trio Cymbal Rush (video of thatÂ show below).\n\nStill, as in the Saturday night jam session at the Budapest Jazz ClubÂ – a very cool hangout which advertised Jeff “Tain” Watts, Joe Lovano and Steve Coleman as coming attractions supplementing local groups, the vibe was familiar from my travels in Armenia, the Azores, Berlin, Cuba, Denmark, Gambia, Italy, St. Petersberg, Tampere, Trinidad, Ukraine as well as the States. Whatever a community’s resources, there are commonalities in the jazz world everywhere, this capital of Central Europe most definitely included.\n\nThe singing in English, allusions to Monk (as I took the approach of alto saxophonist GÃ¡bor Baris’s Version), reverence for Coltrane (especially by alto/soprano saxist TamÃ¡s LudÃ¡nyi) and interest in Herbie Hancock bleeding over to pop stars such as J Dilla (by drummer David Hodek, grooving with American pianist Paul Cornish and bassist Joshua Crumbly) and Betty Wright (smoldering singer Janka VÃ¶rÃ¶s’ finale), with Santa’sÂ 2.5 x 2 meterÂ closeups of U.S. jazz masters on the walls Â –“Jazzonance” was MÃ¼pa’s exhibit title Â — and companionable journo/juristsÂ from Sofia, Slovenia, London, plusÂ Budapest-basedÂ freelancer KornÃ©l Zipernovszky and the generously great Hungarian guitaristÂ Gyula Babos – letÂ me feel almostÂ at home, while refreshed by particular differences.\n\nSuch as the architecture — 19th and 20th century glories, variously preserved, restored or abandoned. Proud museums, palaces and six-story apartment buildings with ground-floor retail shops and cafÃ©s, on concentricÂ circular boulevards. The Gellert Hill Cave,Â thermal baths and church in St. Ivan’s grottos. Trams running up each side of the river, the Danube’sÂ bridges rebuilt since Nazi destruction in WWII. The old market, stalls hung with paprika-colored sausages, an instructive display of wild mushrooms tucked in a corner. Â The Castle District of hilly Buda, overlooking the plain of Pest.\n\nAll contrasting with but complementary to the Jazz Showcase/Talent Exchange (wherein some of the Hungarians travel to perform at London’s 606 Club, and others are booked into events via the Hungarian Jazz Federation, part of the European Jazz Network). MÃ¼pa’s decade-old program struck me as an effortÂ rooted inÂ an artistically sophisticated city, one cognizant of its complex, conflicted past and evidently eager to thrive in the present, the better for whatever’s to come.\n\nAs usual, creative music with drive and feeling seems to well up asÂ a significant if not essential ingredient in aÂ culture, with such ambitions embraced towards those very ends. The basics of individual expression amidÂ group collaborations performed for the entertainment and enlightenment of general audiences have been well established here. The integration of attractive, useful ideas coming from myriad sources is, at least superficially, high. I had just a quick visit, and no doubt experiencedÂ a mereÂ slip of what’s happening in Budapest. But I liked what I heard and saw.\n\nhowardmandel.com\n\nSubscribe by Email or RSS\n\nAll JBJ posts"
