I do like those professionals playing also in the film studios inbetween.\n\nZhanks for the reply.\n\nI posted these same photos in a Chet Baker thread a couple of weeks ago but I figure this may also be a suitable place for them.\n\nHere's a Japanese-issued coffee table book signed by William Claxton. My copy also includes autographs of West Coast jazz giants Russ Freeman, Bill Perkins, Bud Shank, Gerry Mulligan, and Jack Montrose. In the 90s, I attended 2 or 3 editions of the West Coast Jazz Festival down in Redondo and/or Hermosa Beach. Anyway, I kept some flyers and programs of the event and will post them here (as soon as I locate them!). I also took lots of photographs (some good, many not so). The nice thing about this event is that there were Q&A forums where you can have interaction with the musicians. I met and/or saw perform the likes of Charlie Haden, Harold Land, Paul Bley, Teddy Edwards, Gerry Mullligan, Maynard Ferguson, Leroy Vinnegar, Lou Levy, Lennie Niehaus, Gerald Wilson, Russ Freeman, Jimmy Giuffre, Herb Geller, Stan Levey, Conte Candoli, Larance Marable, Howard Rumsey, Claude Williamson, and Mr. Dave Brubeck among a few others.\n\nThose were great times. Many of the musicians I mentioned are no longer with us.\n\nJust sharing.\n\nHi and thanks for the messaga and the photos.\n\nHave that beautifulbook myself but not signed by the author.\n\nBeside jazz records I do collect also cover art books and have a lot of those even very rare Items by Manek Daver and all label books from the swiss company OLMS Verlag. The good thing is you live near the source and I am living in Europe.\n\nBTW from William Claxton I own another great book \"The Art Of Jazz Photography - CLAXOGRAPHY\" published 1995.\n\nMy favorite cover art artist is David Stone Martin.\n\nThe heaviest book in my stock dealing with jazz and photography is the heavy coffetable book \"Jazz Life\" from the TASCHEN company edited by William Claxton and Joachim Ernst Berendt (the late german jazz critic) . If you ever come across this jewel grab it even it is very pricy.\n\nAnyway congrats for beeing on the spot and taking snapshots and sharing your experiences.\n\nI missed that Chet Baker thread but have a couple of records from him. My favorite West Coast big band is Shorty Rogers.\n\nThanks again.\n\nI am familiar with the books you mentioned. I love 'em cover art books but I only have 5 of them: 2 West Coast/California; one Blue Note; one New York album covers; and the Pete Turner (CTI) book. Speaking of Shorty Rogers, one year he was set to appear at the festival but had to beg off due to illness. If memory serves me right, he died while the festival was ongoing in November 1994. I don't have much of his recorded output but one west coast jazz record I like is \"Wherever the Five Winds Blow\" by Shorty's quintet with Giuffre."
