        "text": "Am I all alone here in admiration of Paul Horn? Maybe I’m reading the wrong sources, but from the get-go he seems to be almost casually dismissed. I didn’t know a thing about him, none of it, not even the Godfather of New Age business, when I first read his name in connection to Chico Hamilton’s band. My takeaway was that the Chico-Paul Horn band was in some some sort of creative-identity-struggle period for Hamilton after the original Buddy Collette band broke up. And then of course after Paul came Dolphy, and that’s what got many people curious, myself included. So Paul Horn got lost in the shuffle, and it took years to finally check the band out. But when I finally did? I was thrilled! The guy leapt right out of the speakers. I couldn’t believe he wasn’t better known and thus the fascination began, continuing for years now as I keep digging and finding gems (and my taste evolves!).\n\nThis is a contemporary view. Paul Horn’s early recording career clearly shows he was afforded many an opportunity and knew how to work the game, sign on the dotted line. And when, I guess, he couldn’t make ends meet – here it comes – he Sold Out and produced Easy Listening “dreck.” And when that didn’t work out he ran off to the Ashram, stumbled upon a hippie formula, and that’s all she wrote.\n\nAn easy synopsis, but (nearly) none of it TRUE. But yes, this accounts for much of his dismissal. Self-inflicted? A bit. Unfair? YES! YES! YES!\n\nAnd Paul Horn has single-handedly made the flute an instrument I WANT to listen to (Ron Burgundy not-withstanding).\n\nSo hopefully there our other fans present that will join in, or at least this will serve as a catalyst to check him out. He’s super fun to collect and, outside the early jazz, wonderfully affordable.\n\nI’m going on a binge -- in no particular order – and will comment here as I do so.\n\nPaul Horn – A Special Edition (1974)\n\nI did pick this one on purpose to kick off the binge. For whatever reason I long mistook this for a compilation of previously released early jazz tracks. What a nice revelation! This is an unsung jazz album (w/electric guitar & bass) recorded (mostly?) live perhaps as early as 1971 (no, PH didn’t quit “real” jazz in ’63). Great mix of material. A bit of the space incantation, a brief rock out, some complex mellow chill, Jobim, modern standards & ballads, and a long dose of abstract-folkloric jazz – including the theme to the twilight zone? That had to be intentional! A budget-priced ECM before ECM? A great place to start as it comes with a big photo booklet of the Paul Horn timeline, family album style, starting with Mom & Dad and up to the (1974) present. In the liners Paul states that he had a ½ hour television variety show that featured the quintet. Ran for 18 weeks plus pilot. Where did those tapes go?! Surprisingly released on Island in the USA. The Black Sun CD reissue includes a well-executed facsimile of the vinyl booklet.\n\nI promise to be less wordy going ahead.\n\nI don’t clutter things up with photos (there’s this place called discogs)\n\nAnd links, well, are links. Everyone hates getting those.\n\nWelcome to the Paul Horn Appreciation thread.\n\nThe Lalo Collabs:\n\nPaul Horn – Jazz Suite On The Mass Texts – Composed And Conducted by Lalo Schifrin (1965)\n\nThis one is a doozy. At times it is incredibly dense and layered, so much going on. It almost seems like prepared tape and live instrumentation is at play (like a Varèse fever dream). Most impressively recorded November 5th & 6th, 1964. This was Paul’s 2nd album for RCA Victor. This came in the middle of his easy listening stretch (tho’ in reality he already had a long history of easy listening jazz, just not so prominently under his own name). Quite a juxtaposition. The Stereo edition is brighter and airier (Heaven) compared to the Mono being downright penetrating and harsh (Hell). The Credo is terrifying on both. How this won Lalo a Grammy for Best Jazz Composition is fairly mind-blowing. This thing would clear a room and be labeled Satanic in 2021.\n\nPaul Horn – Dream Machine – Composed, Arranged & Conducted by Lalo Schifrin (1978)\n\nDisco, baby! Fusion! Synths Galore! All those session guys. One of those in endless supply jazz-funk groovers, except it’s not just 1 or 2 tracks that make it, but the whole damn thing. Badass vibes all the way. Be the hero in your own cop show. Seduce a dame. The DJs and hip-hoppers have picked up on this one.\n\nCool stuff, which I sorta commented on below. I don't have the Christmas one (\"The PEACE Album,\" I think it's called) but maybe I'll go for it in time for the December season. Massively multi-tracked \"solo\" flute if I recall correctly. Thanks for your observation!\n\nInside the Great Pyramid (1977)\n\nListening in the air is quite soothing. Listening on headphones can have one looking over their shoulder.\n\nFor all the healing properties and mumbo jumbo, remember these were recorded in a pitch black, once-sealed tomb housing dead bodies. Another inspired, conceptual classic. The original album issue is a must with the art gallery worthy embossed gold-blue cover art and documentation (be sure to get the one with 2 separate inserts), but the obsessed will also need the extended (by approx. 35 minutes) 2cd edition on Kuckkuck with new liners by PH and excellent sound. Paul had yet to market the concept to death, this being only the 2nd true Inside album, 9 years after the first (there is an Inside II album that was released before, but that’s another story coming soon).\n\nThat's incredibly cool. Might there be audio tapes floating around that document the live shows?\n\nHere's a PH comment on the collaboration that I just so happened to read just last night:\n\n\"Another change in Horn’s orientation came when he toured with pop folk-singer Donovan in the late 60s. With Donovan, Horn discovered that communication might be more important than technique.\n\n“Donovan is not a developed musician,” recalled Horn. “He’s not a Barney Kessel on guitar or Howard Roberts or Django Reinhart or any great guitar player. He plays simple chords and he has a nice, pleasing voice. I just saw that he got 25,000 people to be quiet. And he once made a comment to me, he said ‘My ultimate goal is to play a number and get the audience so quiet that they can’t even raise their hands to clap at the end. That would be my ultimate achievement as a performer’. And I thought that was pretty amazing to even come up with that concept.”\"\n\nPaul Horn - Non-LP 7 inchers:\n\n1963: O'Apito No Samba/Whistle While You Work (2/15/1963?) Columbia\n\n1969: Green Jelly Beans / Dancing Children (5/16/1969?) Epic\n\n1971: Joy / The Desert Is A Circle (\"Theme from the motion picture \"El Topo\") Paramount\n\n1972: Haida & Paul Horn (1972) Sealand of The Pacific\n\n1963: A&R schemes for a radio hit. Throw promos out there and see what sticks (It Failed). It’s played insanely quick. Someone held a stopwatch and said it must be 2 minutes and 10 seconds including fade.\n\n1969: Epic Records, after Inside toppled the Nation. I guess A&R figured to pump a 7” out immediately to capitalize. Lord knows where and when this recording came from. Sounds like a sub-basement dub re-mix of the 1966 easy listening material. Narcotic.\n\n1971: Another cross-marketing effort. Promos of “…Desert…” b/w “…Desert…” are everywhere. It’s the cinematic, funky JOY that is the rarity and coveted by DJs around the globe. Supposedly it had a picture sleeve (all type, black on white). A fantastic 7”.\n\n1972: Haida is a whale, a killer, an orca. PH & Haida hereby commune. The Great Mystery is whether this is a LIVE recording as suggested or studio trickery. See Inside II for further details. I’d like to think it real and in-the-moment. Paul is great, as always, but this didn’t do much for Haida’s career. Just didn’t have the talent or stamina for the record biz, I reckon. Great picture sleeve. Guess these were sold in person to the tourists. I wonder if Paul saw the Blackfin doc before he moved on and regretted this episode.\n\nPaul Horn Quintet – Cycle (1965)\n\nBagpipes! This is better than I remembered. Biased coming off what came before and it didn’t help that the opening track is Greensleeves followed by Chim Chim Cheree (both of which really cook here and -- not to scare you -- turn out to be highlights). The PH authored title cut is great and sounds progressively ahead of its time, like something a fusion band of the 70s would write. Each side closes with the short “Shadows #1” and “Shadows #2 (Dedicated to Ravi Shankar).” Contemplative, mostly improv, more depressingly funereal than glowingly reverential. Side 2 kick off is a drag cover, the worst track on the album, followed by another number with bagpipes (NOT played by PH!) that raises the blood levels. Then “Patterns,” an entertaining but ultimately failed vehicle for too brief solo turns (it starts out promising, like something Steve Reich would have tried), and we return to the Ravi worship to end the album on a bummer note.\n\nShort Version: What a mess! In desperate need of re-sequencing or a total re-imagining using outtakes (if there are any, the lack thereof might BE the problem). Then again, seems I have A LOT to say about this record! This was Paul’s first release (of five) for his new label, RCA Victor. The times they done been a-changed."
