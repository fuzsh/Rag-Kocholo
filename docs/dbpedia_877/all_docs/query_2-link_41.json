        "text": "Men's Basketball 2/23/2012 9:42:00 PM By Luke Reid - Sports Information Director\n\nWild...CHAMPS!\n\n'Cats clinch first ever CCAA title\n\nJay Flores leapt into the arms of his head coach. Greg Clink held him there for a moment as the two shared an intimate celebration with 1,200 fans at Acker Gym. The final horn on the Wildcats’ 73-54 win against Cal State Monterey Bay hadn’t sounded yet, but two seconds later, the Chico State men's basketball team had clinched its first ever California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA) title and its first conference title since 1994.\n\nThere was something special about seeing Flores held in someone else’s arms. He’s been carrying the program for three seasons now.\n\nOn the eve of “Senior Night” the Wildcats’ two seniors led the way. Josh Jackson scored a season-high 11 points while knocking down a career-high three 3-pointers. He scored all eight of the Wildcats’ points during an 8-2 run late in the first half that gave the Wildcats control of the game for good.\n\nFlores’ performance was the latest in his long line of masterpieces. This one rivaled any before it. He finished with 10 points, a career-high 12 rebounds, seven assists, and a career-high five steals.\n\nFreshmen Jordan Semple and Jordan Barton finished with 10 points apiece and combined for five blocked shots. James Staniland and Damario Sims finished with nine points apiece (Sims added six assists) and Amir Carraway contributed six points and eight rebounds as the Wildcats improved to 21-6 overall and 15-6 in the CCAA.\n\nThe Wildcats, picked to finish seventh in the conference’s preseason coaches’ poll, will try to win the CCAA title outright when they host Cal State East Bay Friday night at 7:30. Cal Poly Pomona and Humboldt State enter tomorrow night’s action one game behind the Wildcats, needing a win and Chico State loss to grab a share of the title. Cal Poly Pomona is hosting Cal State Dominguez Hills and Humboldt State plays host to Cal State San Bernardino.\n\nA win Friday would not only give the Wildcats the title outright, but would also make them the ninth Chico State men’s team in school history with 22 wins. They already boast the second best winning percentage among the school’s 13 20-win teams at .778, second only to the 1941 team that finished 23-4. The record for most wins in a season is 25, set in 1984.\n\nIf they keep playing like this, that record may fall. Already boasting the nation’s 24th best rebound differential, the Wildcats crushed Cal State Monterey Bay (3-22, 2-19 CCAA) 46-30 on the glass and enjoyed a 14-2 advantage in second-chance points. They also blocked eight shots, helping hold the Otters to 35-percent shooting for the game and just 23 percent in a second half in which they outscored them 36-22.\n\nStaniland sank a trio of first-half 3-pointers and combined with fellow super-subs Semple and Jackson to score 26 of the Wildcats’ 37 first-half points and the Wildcats took a 37-32 lead into the locker room.\n\nFlores assisted on Staniland’s consecutive 3-pointers in the game’s eighth minute, giving him 350 for his career, which moved him past Tim Taylor (1980-84) and into third place on the school’s career assist list.\n\nHe hit a 3-pointer 12 seconds into the second half, and after a Sean Park free throw, scored on a steal and a drive to stretch the lead to 11. After Jackson’s third 3 and Sims’ jumper, the lead was 56-43 with 12:20 left.\n\nThe Wildcats’ advantage did not drop below double digits again.\n\nBrandon Ward paced Cal State Monterey Bay with 16 points and five assists and chipped in five rebounds. Chico High School and Shasta Community College product Kevin Loustale finished with six points, a team-high nine rebounds, and two steals.\n\nTonight, in a darkened Acker Gym, banners hang from the ceiling representing 35 of the school’s CCAA Championships since they joined the conference in 1998. Very soon, a 36th banner that says “CCAA Men’s Basketball Champions 2011-12” will be raised as well. To those who’ve followed this program, and more specifically, watched this team evolve over the past five years, it will say so much more.\n\nBOX SCORE"
