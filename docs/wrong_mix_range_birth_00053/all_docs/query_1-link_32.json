You can find “Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran” here.\n\nShakira at Coachella 2024\n\nPrior to announcing the tour, Shakira surprised the crowd at at Coachella on Friday, April 12 when she performed “La Fuerte” and “BZRP Music Sessions, Vol. 53” alongside Bizzarap.\n\nA raucous fan video can be seen here:\n\nHuge stars on tour in 2024\n\nMany Latin icons are on the road all year long.\n\nHere are just five of our favorites you won’t want to miss live.\n\n• Jennifer Lopez\n\n• Fuerza Regida\n\n• Aventura\n\n• Chayanne\n\n• Gloria Trevi\n\nWho else is out and about?
