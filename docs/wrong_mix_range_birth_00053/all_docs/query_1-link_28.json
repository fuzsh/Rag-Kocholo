Shakira will also be honored with the night's biggest award after multiple decades in the music industry.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it,\" the chart topping star said ahead of receiving the accolade while strutting down the red carpet. \"It's such an important award. I mean, Michael Jackson received it once and so many other incredible artists, and I just feel humbled to be here.\"\n\nAhead of the big night, Bruce Gillmer, President of Music, Music Talent, Programming & Events, Paramount and Chief Content Officer, Music, Paramount+ said of Shakira in a statement, \"She's a trailblazer for women around the world & one of the first artists to lead the globalization of Latin music.\"\n\n\"Her massive impact across the musical landscape will be long lasting as she continues to create and entertain at the highest level,\" he added of her star power.\n\nThe \"Hips Don't Lie\" artist is also nominated for multiple other awards including, Artist of the Year, Best Collaboration for her hit \"TQG\" with Karol G, and Best Latin for both \"TQG\" and her track \"Acróstico.\""
