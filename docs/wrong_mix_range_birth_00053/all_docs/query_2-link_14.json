Shakira is a native Spanish speaker who speaks fluent English and Portuguese, as well as some Arabic, Italian, French, and Catalan.\n\nAfter a poor commercial reception with local producers on her first two albums, and being little-known outside Colombia, Shakira decided to produce her own brand of music. In 1995 she released Pies Descalzos, which brought her to prominence in Latin America and Spain; her 1998 album, Dónde Están los Ladrones?, was a critical success selling over 7 million copies worldwide.\n\nIn 2001, aided by the worldwide success of her first English single \"Whenever, Wherever\" that became the best selling single of 2002, she broke through into the English-speaking world with the release of Laundry Service, which sold over 15 million copies worldwide. Four years later, Shakira released two album projects called Fijación Oral Vol. 1 and Oral Fixation Vol. 2. Both reinforced her success, particularly with the best selling song of the 2000s, \"Hips Don't Lie\". In 1997, Shakira founded the Pies Descalzos Foundation. It is a Colombian charity with special schools for poor children all around Colombia. During her career, Shakira has performed at a large number of benefit concerts. Among the most famous are the Live 8 benefit concert in July 2005, the Live Earth concert, Hamburg where she headlined the show, as well as the \"Clinton Global Initiative\" created by former US President Bill Clinton. She was also invited to the Oval Office by President Barack Obama in February 2010 to discuss early childhood development.\n\nShakira has won many awards. She has her own star for Hollywood Walk Of Fame, won five MTV Video Music Awards, won two Grammy Awards, nine Latin Grammy Awards, seven Billboard Music Award, twenty-eight Billboard Latin Music Awards and has been Golden Globe-nominated. She is also the highest-selling Colombian artist of all time, and the second most successful female Latin singer behind Gloria Estefan, having sold over 125 million copies worldwide (70 million albums and 55 million singles). Her U.S. album sales stand at 9.9 million. In the fall of 2009, Shakira released her sixth studio album She Wolf worldwide gaining a lot of critical praise for her eccentricity and writing skills. The album sold roughly 2 million copies around the world. Shakira's \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\", was chosen as the official song for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The song has received generally positive critical reception, and has become a worldwide hit and the biggest selling World Cup song of all time. On YouTube, the English version of the music video is the 5th most watched video of all time with over 500 million views. When she released her seventh studio album, the bilingual Sale el Sol in October 2010, she gained back her Latin following, which Shakira described as being the main goal for the album. The album has sold over 4 million copies worldwide. Since 2009, Shakira's musical career suffered from a strained relationship with her label Epic Records, which resulted in lack of promotion and investment from Epic Records towards her two latter studio albums She Wolf (2009) and Sale el Sol (2010).\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nShakira is a Roman Catholic. She met Pope John Paul II in 1998, She is interested in world history and frequently studies the history and languages of the countries she visits. After her Oral Fixation tour ended in summer 2007, Shakira attended a summer school class in Los Angeles at UCLA Extension, on the History of Western Civilization. She used her middle and last names, Isabel Mebarak, and told the professor she was visiting from Colombia so as to avoid being recognized as a celebrity. Shakira is a cousin of model and 2005–2006 Miss Colombia, Valerie Domínguez. In an interview on The Paul O'Grady Show, she referred to herself as a mutt due to her diverse ancestry, which she noted as a theme behind her song \"Gypsy\".\n\nRelationships[]\n\nIn 2000, Shakira started dating Antonio de la Rúa. In a 2009 interview, Shakira stated their relationship already worked as a married couple, and that \"they don't need papers for that.\" On January 10, 2011, Shakira announced on her website that after 11 years together, she and de la Rúa had separated in August 2010 after making \"a mutual decision to take time apart from our romantic relationship.\" She wrote that the couple \"view this period of separation as temporary and as a time of individual growth as we continue to be partners in our business and professional lives\", with de la Rúa overseeing Shakira's \"business and career interests as he has always done.\"\n\nShakira's currently in a relationship with Gerard Piqué, centre back for FC Barcelona and the Spanish national football team. Shakira officially confirmed their relationship on March 29, 2011, via Twitter and Facebook posting a picture of the two with a caption reading, \"I present to you my sunshine.\" It was the first time she'd ever spoken of the relationship. In September 2012, Shakira confirmed that she and Piqué are expecting their first child together.\n\nDiscography[]\n\nMagia (1991)\n\nPeligro (1993)\n\nPies Descalzos (1995)\n\nThe Remixes (1997)\n\nDónde Están los Ladrones?
