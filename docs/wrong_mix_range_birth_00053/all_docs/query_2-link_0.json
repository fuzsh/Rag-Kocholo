        "text": "Shakira (born February 2, 1977, Barranquilla, Colombia) is a Colombian singer, songwriter, musician, and dancer who built a successful career in both Spanish- and English-speaking markets to become one of the most popular Latin American recording artists of the early 21st century.\n\nShakira, the daughter of a Lebanese father and a Colombian mother, started belly dancing at an early age. By age 10 she had begun writing songs and participating in talent competitions. A local theater producer helped her land an audition with a Sony Corp. executive in 1990, and Shakira was subsequently signed to a record deal. Her first two albums, Magia (1991) and Peligro (1993), were only moderately successful, however. After taking a break from recording to act in the Colombian telenovela El oasis, Shakira resumed her music career in impressive fashion with Pies descalzos (1995). The album produced several hits, including “Estoy aquí,” “Pienso en ti,” and “Un poco de amor.”\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\n2010s Music Quiz\n\nIn 1998 Shakira released ¿Dónde están los ladrones?, which includes several memorable singles. She notably won Latin Grammy Awards for best female pop vocal performance (“Ojos así”) and for best rock vocal performance (“Octavo día”). She then focused her efforts on establishing herself in the English-speaking market and achieving mainstream success in the United States. In 2001 her album MTV Unplugged (2000) won the Grammy Award for best Latin pop album, and she released her first English-language album, Laundry Service, that same year. Although her English-language songwriting skills were questioned by some (Shakira wrote all her own lyrics on the album), Laundry Service sold more than 13 million copies worldwide and reached number three on the Billboard album chart. Two of its singles—“Whenever, Wherever” and “Underneath Your Clothes”—became top 10 hits in the United States.\n\nShakira continued her crossover success in 2005 with the release of the Spanish-language Fijación oral, vol. 1 in June and the English-language Oral Fixation, Vol. 2 in November. Both albums debuted in the top five in the United States, and her single “Hips Don’t Lie” (featuring Wyclef Jean) topped charts around the world in 2006. It was accompanied by a music video that showcased Shakira’s belly dancing amid a Carnival setting. At that year’s Latin Grammy Awards, she captured the awards for song of the year and record of the year for the single “La tortura.” Fijación oral, vol. 1 was named album of the year as well as best female pop vocal album; it also won a Grammy Award for best Latin rock/alternative album. A live concert recording, Oral Fixation Tour, followed in 2007. Also that year Shakira performed in Hamburg as part of Live Earth, a worldwide concert series organized to bring attention to climate change and environmental sustainability.\n\nFor her next English-language album, She Wolf (2009), Shakira adopted an electro-pop sound. The following year she scored another international hit with “Waka Waka (This Time for Africa),” a collaboration with South African band Freshlyground, after the song was chosen as the official anthem of the 2010 World Cup. The track also appears on her breezily eclectic Sale el sol (2010), which earned a Latin Grammy for best female pop vocal album.\n\nIn 2013–14 Shakira was a coach on the American televised singing competition The Voice. She returned to recording albums with Shakira (2014), which features duets with Rihanna and country singer Blake Shelton, one of her fellow coaches on The Voice. That same year Shakira performed the closing ceremony for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Her next album, El Dorado (2017), won the Grammy Award for best Latin pop album and the Latin Grammy for best contemporary pop vocal album. El Dorado’s standout track was the single “La bicicleta,” a duet with Carlos Vives that won Latin Grammys for best record of the year and best song of the year. In 2020 Shakira and Jennifer Lopez performed in the Super Bowl halftime show. Their sensational performance showcased several Latin American music styles, including salsa, rumba, mambo, and samba. Shakira in particular was commended for bringing the mapalé and champeta, two Afro-Colombian dances that she performed, to a world stage.\n\nShakira had several hit singles in the next few years, including “Don’t Wait Up” (2021) and “Don’t You Worry” (2022), the latter of which paired her with the Black Eyed Peas. In 2024 she released her first album in seven years, Las mujeres ya no lloran, which features several songs that had proved themselves as hits in 2022 and 2023. These included “Te felicito” with Rauw Alejandro and a searing diss track aimed at her ex-boyfriend Gerard Piqué following their breakup called “Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53” with Bizarrap; the latter song was a global chart-topper and a top 10 hit in the United States."
