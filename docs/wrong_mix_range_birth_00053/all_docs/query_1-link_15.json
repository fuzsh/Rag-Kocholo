        "text": "Dr. Melissa Noel Horger\n\nDr. Melissa N. Horger is currently a postdoctoral fellow at Temple University. She works in the Developmental Science Lab under the advisement of Dr. Peter Marshall. Presently, she is researching neural plasticity in the somatosensory cortex and its relation to motor expertise. Melissa completed her doctoral degree at the Graduate Center, City University of New York in September 2021.
