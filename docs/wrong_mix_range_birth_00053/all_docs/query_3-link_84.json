        "text": "Saturday Night Live castmember Pete Davidson on Friday (Dec. 15) posted a photo on Instagram indicating that he got a tattoo of former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nAccompanying the picture of the ink, Davidson said the “tattoo of [his] hero” was meant to be a Christmas gift for Clinton.\n\n“Thanks for being such a badass and one of the strongest people in the universe,” he added. The picture is the only photo on his verified Instagram account.\n\nClinton herself later commented on the post, in which Davidson tagged the former secretary of state.\n\n“Thanks,” she wrote. “This makes it significantly less awkward that I’ve had a Pete Davidson tattoo for years. But seriously, I’m honored. Merry Christmas, my friend.”\n\nTattoo artist Jon Mesa, whom Davidson credited for the ink, told <a href=”https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/did-snls-pete-davidson-just-get-a-hillary-clinton-tattoo/” target=”_blank”>Us Weekly</a> that it’s legit.\n\n“Yes, it’s real! Just did it last night at my shop No Idols Tattoo on Bowery and Grand! It’s a small one on his right leg,” Mesa told the outlet.\n\n<blockquote class=”instagram-media” data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=https://www.instagram.com/p/BcvERVQHs58/ data-instgrm-version=”8″ style=” background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% – 2px); width:calc(100% – 2px);”><div style=”padding:8px;”> <div style=” background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;”> <div style=” background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;”></div></div> <p style=” margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;”> <a href=”https://www.instagram.com/p/BcvERVQHs58/” style=” color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;” target=”_blank”>Wanted to get @hillaryclinton a Christmas gift so I got a tattoo of my hero.

But it might make me feel better if I was on TV more.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in <a href=”https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/snls-pete-davidson-shows-hillary-clinton-tattoo-1068708″ target=”_blank”>The Hollywood Reporter</a>."
