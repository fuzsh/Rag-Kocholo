        "text": "Between September 7 â 9, RBMA touched down at Berlinâs fabled recording studio Hansa to celebrate the studioâs lasting impact on the music world.\n\nThough originally built as a concert hall in 1910, Hansa Studioâs Meistersaal started its illustrious career as a recording studio in 1961. With a handful of influential engineers at the helm, the studio birthed dozens of groundbreaking albums and continues to be revered amongst musicians worldwide. Read more on Hansa here.\n\nTaking place in the studioâs Meistersaal, the opening night featured Berlin-based artists such as Brandt Brauer Frick and Mano Le Tough plus fellow RBMA alum and London chanteuse Andreya Triana performing renditions of tunes from Hansaâs immense back-catalog, as well as Berlin techno icons like Moritz von Oswald and Radio Slave showcasing the current crop of forward-thinking sounds coming out of Germany.\n\nThe performance was followed by recording workshops with legendary studio wizards like Gareth Jones, a producer who lent his touch to recordings from Depeche Mode and >EinstÃ¼rzende Neubauten among others, alongside former Hansa sound engineer Thomas MÃ¼ller and Manfred Praeker from the Nina Hagen Band and Spliff. Chart topping German rapper Casper plus RBMA alumnus and Berlin producer Robot Koch also contributed workshops.\n\nBy night, free after-parties continued well into the wee hours at Kater Holzig, the nightlife upstart from the folks behind Berlinâs infamous Bar 25, featuring Academy family like Tiger & Woods, Morgan Geist and Gerd Janson plus notable RBMA alumni like Clara Moto, San Soda, Patrice BÃ¤umel and Douglas Greed.\n\nDuring Jazz Ã la Villette festival, Red Bull Music Academy and Questlove of the Roots co-curated a special night in Paris dedicated to the immense impact of African funk and soul on modern music.\n\nQuestlove, the Rootsâ drummer, hip-hop producer and outspoken tastemaker, offered a contemporary tribute to African musical history through a selection of tracks played by the Afro-Picks Big Band, featuring Afrobeat pioneer Tony Allen himself on drums, Macy Gray, Black Thought, Mamani Keita and Detroit multi-instrumentalist Amp Fiddler, as well as members of Antibalas, the David Murray Big Band, the Roots, the Tony Allen Band and Fela!, the Broadway musical. The show was a unique performance straddling tradition and modernity, struggle and liberation, music and politics.\n\nFrom Motown to garage rock and techno, Detroit is the birthplace of some of the most seminal records of all time; records which stand for whole musical eras.\n\nIn tribute to this capital of innovative music, the Red Bull Music Academy created an exhibition of music production and studio equipment. Over five days, guest lecturers included techno and house pioneers like Mike Banks (Underground Resistance), Juan Atkins, Theo Parrish and Carl Craig as well as hip-hop, techno and electronic experimentalist Tadd Mullinix AKA Dabrye, producer/engineer Mike Chavarria and Nick Speed, a producer who has worked with everyone from 50 Cent to Phat Kat and Danny Brown. They spoke about the most respected records to come out of Detroit, with a different music field explored each day. Local music-makers were also able to participate in lectures and workshops with living legends like Motown engineer Ed Wolfrum, keyboardist and funketeer Amp Fiddler, Wayne Kramer of seminal rock band MC5, Motown arranger Paul Riser and Ghetto Recordersâ Jim Diamond, the garage rock producer, engineer and bass player with the Dirtbombs. Other speakers included jazz pioneers and Afrofuturists Marcus Belgrave, Phil Ranelin and Tribe Recordsâ Wendell Harrison.\n\nTwo night-time events put the theory into action, with heavy dancefloor excursions courtesy of 3 Chairs and a special Tribe Records showcase.\n\nThe fifth World Tour stop saw RBMAâs signature Culture Clash event come to Toronto, a city with one of the largest West Indian populations outside the Caribbean, hosted by local hip-hop legend Kardinal Offishall. Legendary crews playing on massive soundsystems faced off in the cityâs first ever cross-genre soundclash, as part of the Manifesto Festival Of Community and Culture.\n\nThe formidable crews battling for the crowdâs favor at Echo Beach were hip-hop and electro pioneer Afrika Bambaataaâs Zulu Nation, Mad Decent (South Rakkas Crew, Dillon Francis, Paul Devro and DJ Sega), LuckyMe (Rustie, Lunice, Just Blaze and Hudson Mohawke and Toronto All Stars (Lissa Monet, DJ Mensa, Lindo P, Starting From Scratch). The Toronto All Stars took top honors after winning the crowdâs favor.\n\nThe New York City stop of the World Tour, titled Five Out of Five, paid tribute to hip-hop, arguably the most influential youth culture of our time, right where it all began. Over the course of five days, five classic albums from Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Staten Island and Manhattan were revisited via workshops and public talks in each respective borough. At night, the artists re-created their seminal work for a special concert, bridging the gap from old to new school. The five albums were: The Great Adventures Of Slick Rick (1988), Black Moonâs Enta Da Stage (1993), Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) (1993), The Infamous by Mobb Deep (1995) and Dipsetâs Diplomatic Immunity (2003).\n\nItaly can claim credits to some of the greatest and most influential movie soundtracks ever, from spaghetti westerns to psychedelic animations, giallo horror flicks to â70s cop films. To celebrate this heritage, composer Massimo Nunzi transcribed and adapted the movie soundtracks from the original recordings, including pieces by seminal composers such as Ennio Morricone, Piero Umiliani and Goblin. These were performed by an outstanding group of Italian musicians and a 52-person orchestra at the stunning Renzo Piano-designed Auditorium Parco della Musica concert hall in Rome. Performers included veterans like jazz guitarist Silvano Chimenti and trombonist Dino Piana, who played on Piero Umilianiâs dapper âGassman Bluesâ from the soundtrack to the film I Soliti Ignoti; as well as respected younger musicians such as Fabrizio Bosso, Daniele Tittarelli and vocalist Gunnlaug Thorvaldsdottir, who performed the innocently sinister vocal line of Goblinâs âSchool At Night (Lullaby Music Box Version).â\n\nThe night featured breathtaking live visuals by Luca Barcellona and Sean Martin that put a brand-new spin on the original cinematic masterpieces."
