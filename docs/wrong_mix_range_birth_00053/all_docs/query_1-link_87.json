        "text": "Two high-ranking leaders of the Nine Trey Gangsters set of the United Blood Nation (UBN or Bloods) street gang, including the “Godfather” of the set, who also served as “Chairman” of the UBN, and a second leader who held the rank of “Worldwide High” were each sentenced today to 20 years in prison for racketeering conspiracy.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney R. Andrew Murray for the Western District of North Carolina, and Special Agent in Charge John A. Strong of the FBI Charlotte, North Carolina Field Division, made the announcement.\n\nPedro Gutierrez, aka Magoo, Light and Inferno, 45, of New York City, New York, was sentenced by Chief Judge Frank D. Whitney to serve 20 years in prison. James Baxton, aka Frank White and Grown, 44, of New York City, New York, was also sentenced by Judge Whitney to serve 20 years in prison. Both of these sentences will be served consecutively to the defendants’ current New York State sentences. Pedro Gutierrez, James Baxton, and Cynthia Gilmore, aka Cynthia Young and Lady Bynt, 42, of Raleigh, North Carolina, had been convicted by a federal jury sitting in Charlotte on May 17, following a two-week trial. Cynthia Gilmore is awaiting sentencing.\n\n“With today’s sentencings of two violent gang leaders, including the purported Godfather of the Nine Trey Gangsters, law enforcement has delivered yet another devastating blow to the Nine Trey Gangsters and the United Blood Nation,” said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski. “The defendants committed crimes that spanned the East Coast, including trafficking deadly narcotics in North Carolina and New York and ordering a gang war in North Carolina. As demonstrated by the 61 defendants now adjudicated guilty in this case, when federal, state, and local law enforcement work together in sustained efforts, we can disrupt and erode violent prison and street gangs.”\n\n“Drugs, thefts, guns, violent assaults, and murders are all crimes the Bloods commit every day to protect their turfs, increase their territory, control and recruit members, and intimidate rival gangs,” said U.S. Attorney Murray. “And all of it happens right here, in our neighborhoods, where honest, hard-working people are simply trying to raise their children without the fear of harm. We cannot overlook or underestimate the long-term impact of gangs on the well-being and prosperity of communities where gang activity is present. That is why the dismantling of criminal enterprises district-wide is both a priority for my office and a goal we share with law enforcement agencies throughout the Western District of North Carolina.”\n\nIn February 2017, President Trump directed the Department of Justice “to reduce crime in America,” and Attorney General Jeff Sessions has made violent crime reduction and eliminating gangs a priority during his tenure. In June 2018, the Attorney General announced the largest increase in Assistant U.S. Attorneys—311 new prosecutors, including eight in North Carolina—to combat violent crime and carry out other Department priorities.\n\nAdditionally, Attorney General Sessions last year announced a reinvigorated Project Safe Neighborhoods program aimed at reducing the rising tide of violent crime in America. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of North Carolina is an active participant in PSN.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein mentioned many of these announcements and more when he delivered remarks in August to the 17th Annual Gangs Across the Carolinas Conference, a conference which Attorney General Sessions delivered remarks to in August 2017.\n\n“These leaders of the UBN thought they were untouchable, continuing to run their criminal enterprise from inside state prison,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Strong. “The lengthy federal sentences they received today send a strong message to anyone who tries to fill the criminal void they leave behind. Do not be mistaken, we’ll come after you next with the full strength of our federal, local, and state law enforcement partners.”\n\nAccording to court documents and evidence presented at trial, the UBN is a violent criminal street gang operating throughout the east coast of the United States since it was founded as a prison gang in 1993. UBN members are often identified by their use of the color red, and can also often be identified by common tattoos or burn marks. Examples include: a three-circle pattern, usually burned onto the upper arm, known as a “dog paw”; the acronym “M.O.B.,” which stands for “Member of Bloods”; the words “damu,” or “eastside”; the number five; the five-pointed star; and the five-pointed crown. UBN members have distinct hand signs and written codes, which are used to identify other members and rival gang members. The Nine Trey Gangster set of the UBN refer to themselves as “Billies.”\n\nAccording to court documents and evidence presented at trial, the UBN is governed by a common set of 31 rules, known as “The 31,” which were originally written by the founders of the UBN. Members of the UBN are expected to conduct themselves and their illegal activity according to rules and regulations set by their leaders. Prominent among these is a requirement to pay monthly dues to the organization, often in the amounts of $31 or $93. A percentage of these funds are transferred to incarcerated UBN leadership in New York; these funds also are used locally to conduct gang business. UBN gang dues are derived from illegal activity performed by subordinate UBN members including narcotics trafficking, robberies, wire fraud, and bank fraud, among other forms of illegal racketeering activities.\n\nAccording to court documents and evidence presented at trial, the Nine Trey Gangsters’ leadership proceeds in rank, from lowest to highest, from “Scrap,” “1-Star General” through “5-Star General,” “Low,” “High,” and “Godfather.”\n\nBased on evidence introduced during the trial, Gutierrez was a “Godfather” of the Nine Trey Gangsters and had served since 2003 as the “Chairman” of the council that governs the UBN. Gutierrez, together with James Baxton and Omari Rosero, considered themselves “the last ones that God put in power” over the UBN. As the Godfather of the set, Gutierrez, along with Baxton, conducted gang business and participated in the distribution of gang dues while incarcerated in the New York State Department of Corrections. Trial evidence also established that Gutierrez ordered a gang war in North Carolina in 2011, directing that members of the Bloods gang attack and kill members of a renegade gang called Pretty Tony. The war resulted in numerous injuries among inmates and the lockdown of five North Carolina prisons for six months.\n\nTrial evidence also established that Baxton was a “Worldwide High” of the Nine Trey Gangsters and that, while incarcerated in the New York State Department of Corrections, Baxton trafficked heroin within the prison system and engaged in wire fraud by threatening the relatives of other incarcerated inmates.\n\nIn all, 61 defendants have been adjudicated guilty in this case, including the two defendants who were found guilty at trial and sentenced today; 58 defendants have previously pleaded guilty in this investigation. This includes 10 defendants in high-ranking leadership positions:\n\nMontraya Antwain Atkinson, aka Hardbody, 31, of Raleigh, North Carolina, pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy.
