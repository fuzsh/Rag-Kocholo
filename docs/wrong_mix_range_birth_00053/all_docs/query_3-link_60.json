As a world tour follows this autumn, we can’t wait to see this rising star continue to make HERstory.\n\nLana Del Rey\n\nLDR dropped critically acclaimed album Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd in 2023, which hit number one in the US and the UK and landed the cult singer-songwriter five 2024 Grammy nominations – including Album of the Year.

From music to acting, there’s not much Yim can’t conquer.\n\nACTORS\n\nAna De Armas\n\nAfter eye-catching work in 2015’s Knock Knock and 2017’s Blade Runner 2049, it was murder mystery hit Knives Out that took Cuban and Spanish actress Ana’s movie career to the A-list in 2019. She played a Bond girl in 2021’s No Time to Die and won an Oscar nomination for channelling Marilyn Monroe in the gritty Netflix biopic Blonde in 2022. With action thriller Ballerina expected in 2024, as well as survival thriller Eden, our eyes will be glued to the screen for Ana.\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy\n\nHer first film role was in the genre-shifting elevated horror film The Witch in 2015. Since then, Anya has steadily built an astounding filmography, from phycological thriller Split (2016) to the blackly comic horror film The Menu (2022). She’s also found success in TV - Netflix’s The Queen’s Gambit brought her to truly global attention in 2022 – but this year she’ll return to the silver screen as Furiosa in George Miller's post-apocalyptic acJon-adventure film Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga. The future is bright for this movie star.\n\nAaron Taylor-Johnson\n\nThe Broccoli camp have certainly had their heads turned by Aaron as James Bond rumours continue to swirl around the English actor as next in line - and he refuses to shut them down. Since a debut in Kick-Ass, roles in Bullet Train, Tenet, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Nocturnal Animals have continued to impress. He even won a Golden Globe for the latter!\n\nAustin Butler\n\nWith a small but memorable role in Quinten Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, it wasn’t hard to guess American actor, Austin, had big things in store. Big things hit in 2022, with a role every actor in Hollywood wanted, and Austin knocked it out the park – as pop icon Elvis in Baz Luhrmann's eponymous biopic. Next up is a supporting role in the Timothée Chalamet- starring Dune: Part Two, out in 2024, and a main role in war drama miniseries Masters of the Air. The sky’s the limit for this rising star!\n\nAyo Edebiri\n\nIf 2023 is an indicator of this breakout American actor, writer, comedian, and producer’s future success, Ayo is set to dominate 2024. With Emmy and Golden Globe wins for her role on Hulu’s dark comedy, The Bear under her belt, future roles in Marvel’s Thunderbolts and A24’s Opus, there’s no stopping this screen queen.

But English-born actor Bella Ramsey, still only 20, went stratospheric for their role as plucky teen Ellie opposite Pedro Pascal in sci-fi zombie series The Last of Us in 2023. Season two is on the way. What’s more, the English-born star, who uses they/them pronouns, has recently spoken of hopes to direct a feature in the near future.\n\nCillian Murphy\n\nHe’s been acting since the 90s, but Irish actor Cillian reached a new career peak in 2023, after his nine-year turn in smash hit crime show Peaky Blinders came to an end in 2022. Next up was his biggest movie to date: Christopher Nolan’s astonishing Oppenheimer: a biopic of \"father of the atomic bomb\" J. Robert Oppenheimer, which he won a Golden Globe for Best Actor. The film grossed $954.7 million! Cillian’s next movie will be the historical drama Small Things Like These, on which he also serves as a producer. We want front row seats to whatever Cillian has in store!\n\nEvan Peters\n\nAfter a 10-year stint in Ryan Murphy’s wacky American Horror Story, Evan tried his hand in prestige drama, playing a detective in the Kate Winslet-starring HBO crime miniseries Mare of Easttown. He won an Emmy for the effort, plus a Golden Globe for playing the titular role in Netflix miniseries Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. Future movies include 2024 horror The Night Light and Disney sci-fi Tron: Ares, currently in production. Evan is a American success story in our books.\n\nFlorence Pugh\n\nFrom Midsommar to Little Women, English actor Florence Pugh has been racking up roles in indie hits for years. But in 2023, she added blockbuster biopic Oppenheimer to her filmography, as well as a starring role opposite Harry Styles in the much discussed Don’t Worry Darling.

Where Flo goes, we want to be.\n\nHunter Schafer\n\nEuphoria breakout star, fashion model and actor, Hunter Schafer is dominating the runways and red carpet. She joined the silver screen in 2023 with a key role in Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. With upcoming confirmed projects including a third season of Euphoria and the films Cuckoo, Kinds of Kindness, and Mother Mary, and more Hunger Games films possibly in the cards, all eyes are on Hunter this year.\n\nJacob Elordi\n\nHeartthrob Jacob won legions of admirers playing the toxic high school jock Nate in the Zendaya-starring Euphoria. Season three is delayed until 2025 owing to the SAG-AFTRA strike, so Jacob has kept busy with a buzzy turn as spoiled rich boy Felix in pop culture shaking, bizarre comedy-drama, Saltburn. He also played Elvis himself in Priscilla, a biopic about the king of pop’s late wife. There’s no doubt Jacob will keep our hearts throbbing in 2024 with new projects including the films On Swift Horses and Oh, Canada.\n\nJanice Man\n\nA model and actress from Hong Kong, Janice gained widespread popularity in mainland China for roles in box office smash hit films like Detective Chinatown 3 and Lost in the Stars.

But it’s her buzzy horror work that has seen her go stratospheric in recent years, particularly with the Scream reboot (2022’s Scream, 2023’s Scream VI) and Netflix’s Adams Family-inspired TV hit, Wednesday. We’ll be watching for her to wow us in future performances, especially the highly anticipated Beetlejuice 2, expected this year.\n\nJennifer Coolidge\n\nShe shot to mega-fame around the Millennium as the lovable Paulette in the Legally Blonde films, and Stifler’s Mom in the American Pie series. But nobody saw Jennifer’s second act coming: the star has won all the awards for her unmissable turn as the lovably chaotic, and pop culture fave, Tanya in HBO comedy-drama series The White Lotus. Delivering iconic one-liners and heart-capturing performances, we can’t wait to see what she does next – including crime drama Riff Raff opposite Dustin Hoffman.\n\nJeremy Allen White\n\nNot new to critically acclaimed TV shows, Jeremy broke through with his performance in Shameless—but it’s his portrayal as “Carmy” in award winning The Bear, that shot him to global stardom.

Wright has us yelling “Letitia Forever”!\n\nMargot Robbie\n\nAustralian actress Margot was already a superstar after turns in The Wolf of Wall Street and Suicide Squad, but her culture-shifting performance in last year’s Greta Gerwig-directed Barbie made her a Hollywood immortal. The same year, she somehow found time to land a producer credit on pop culture sharking, black comedy film Saltburn. Upcoming projects include an Ocean’s 11 prequel, which will see her reunited with Barbie co-star Ryan Gosling. Everything Margot touches turns to gold!\n\nMegan Fox\n\nShe starred in a string of culture-defining movies of the 00s, including two Transformers films and the horror-comedy Jennifer’s Body. But in her late 30s, American actress Megan is enjoying a career resurgence. The 2021 thriller Till Death won her the best reviews of her career, and in 2023, she joined the unstoppable Expendables franchise. Next up, she’ll portray a robot in in sci-fi flick Subservience. The fashion fan is also a brand ambassador for Skims and Frederick's of Hollywood and can’t step on a red carpet without dominating the headlines.

This year, she’ll appear in the films Damsel and The Electric State. She will also appear in the fifth and final season of Stranger Things, the release date of which is yet to be confirmed.

Season two’s due in 2025, but before that, he’s in the most hotly anticipated film of the decade: Ridley Scott’s Gladiator 2, co-starring Paul Mescal.
