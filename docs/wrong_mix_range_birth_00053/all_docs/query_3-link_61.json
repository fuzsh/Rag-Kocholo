Representatives from Lions Clubs all over the world were in attendance for this high energy conference.\n\n8 March 2011\n\nA group of passionate students brought their positive energy to help the New York Office of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) stop human trafficking.Thirteen students from the Benedictine Academy, an all-girls inner-city school in Elizabeth, NJ. presented UNODC's NY Office with examples of their home-grown advocacy materials, such as a short documentary on child trafficking in the cocoa industry, a rap song on human trafficking, advocacy wristbands, and an informational banner they've hung at nearby businesses, high schools and colleges. The students' positive energy embodies the idea of thinking globally and acting locally. They are using their advocacy materials to inform their local community about the global problem of human trafficking, while also educating consumers on how to identify goods potentially made through slave labor, such as demonstrating what chocolate products are \"guilty-free.\" Moved by UNODC's Blue Heart Campaign, the students have used the symbol of the blue heart as the focus of their advocacy efforts. The Blue Heart Campaign was developed by UNODC to raise awareness globally on the issue of human trafficking, with the image of the blue heart representing both the sadness of those who are trafficked and the cold-heart of those who buy and sell fellow human beings. To date, the students have raised $100 through their sale of wristbands imprinted with a blue heart and their slogan: \"HUH - Hearts Uniting Hearts.\" As a token of their dedication, the Benedictine Academy generously donated this $100 to UNODC for its efforts to end human trafficking. Also, the students presented a banner with 108 signatures of their classmates all pledging to raise awareness to help stop human trafficking. By advocating in such an effective manner, the students demonstrate the importance of community-based campaigns and initiatives in combating this heinous crime. The meeting was a mutual learning experience. The students were excited to hear how UNODC combats human trafficking globally; while the UNODC NY Office was infected by the student's enthusiasm and dedication to help end human trafficking in their community. The students are mentored by Sister Donna Jo Repetti and Linda Michalski, who help turn their ideas into concrete action. In a thank you letter to the NY Office, Linda wrote that the meeting made the students \"feel ten feet tall\" and \"empowered them to continue to take action to be a voice for the voiceless.\"\n\n2 March 2011\n\nUNODC Executive Director, Yury Fedotov, and Alain Le Roy, Under-Secretary-General for DPKO, signed a joint plan of action to further strengthen their cooperation in the battle against drugs and organized crime in conflict and post-conflict zones and to proactively address threats to stability and security. Mr. Fedotov said: \"Development needs security to succeed. The United Nations must integrate responses to transnational organized crime, including criminal justice reform, into its peacekeeping, peacebuilding, security, development and disarmament activities. The UNODC-Department of Peacekeeping Operations joint plan of action is an important step in this direction.\" Mr. Le Roy commented: \"\"The Department of Peacekeeping Operations undertakes a wide variety of complex tasks to help countries torn by conflict to create the conditions for lasting peace, from helping to build sustainable institutions of governance to security sector reform and human rights monitoring. In order to strengthen these tasks, the organization seeks partners with comparative advantage in particular areas to help to push for national ownership and capacity development through provision of knowledge and expertise.\" Under the new joint plan of action, the two bodies will cooperate in implementing specific activities based on common objectives, including the development of guidance materials and policy in such areas as criminal justice reform, prisons and management of correctional institutions in post-conflict settings; security sector reform; the strengthening of State mechanisms in dealing with criminal networks; trafficking in drugs and persons; and the fight against corruption and the plundering of natural resources. More...\n\n16 December 2010\n\nUNODC Executive Director, Yury Fedotov, along with partners from ECOWAS, UNOWA, DPKO, DPA, and INTERPOL, presented a High Level Briefing session on the drug trafficking and organized crime situation in the West African region. Mr. Fedotov acknowledged that progress is being made in the region, but emphasized that illicit trafficking and organized crime undermine stability and security globally. Mr. Fedotov also noted that West Africa is a major transit route for counterfeit medicines, the smuggling of commodities and people for sexual exploitation, and risked becoming a major safe haven for terrorists if the narcotics trafficking problem remained unaddressed. The Regional Programme will work in cooperation with ECOWAS states and UNOWA based on the principle of shared responsibility. It will address the transcontinental nature of the challenge, in particular, the transatlantic route. It will focus on peace building, security sector reform, and national and regional institution- and capacity-building. The partners and States will work to strengthen action in the areas of organized crime, trafficking and terrorism, justice and integrity, drug prevention and health as well as awareness raising and research. At the conclusion of the High Level Briefing session, Mr. Fedotov launched the UNODC Regional Programme for West Africa 2010-2014 with enthusiastic support from the member states in attendance.
