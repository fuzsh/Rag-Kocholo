        "text": "If someone asked you what the best commercial of all time was, you'd do the right thing and tell them it's Terry Tate Office Linebacker. But if we're going purely off shares, a three-minute yogurt commercial/music video is top dog. As Advertising Age reports, Shakira's World Cup-themed collaboration with Activia has surpassed Volkswagen's 2011 Super Bowl spot \"The Force\" as the most shared ad across Facebook, Twitter, and blogs.\n\nThe car commercial had held the spot for three consecutive years, enjoying a margin of nearly 3,000 shares. But since its release in May, Shakira's spot has amassed 5,375,756 shares to Volkswagen's 5,372,945. Though the new victor barely features Activia at all, instead functioning as more of a straight-up music video for Shakira's song \"La La La (Brazil 2014)\", it's apparently part of a hot new ad trend called \"trackvertising\". Under this possibly-named-by-a-toddler strategy, a musician and a brand co-release a video that hypes both the brand and the artist's chosen track in one seamless burst of synergy. Somewhere, the members of Ladysmith Black Mambazo are waiting for Lifesavers to call again."
