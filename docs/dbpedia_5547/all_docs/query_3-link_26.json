        "text": "Earlier this year, a hopeful but inaccurate rumor circulated that Leonard Peltier’s freedom has been granted. While this is what we are STILL fighting for and working toward for our dear elder Leonard, this information is not true. What is true is that the pressure we are applying at this time IS gaining attention — and we have to continue applying that pressure and calling for Leonard’s release. At 79 years old and in his 48th year of imprisonment, Leonard is elderly and deserves to live out his final days in freedom, in peace, and to finally breathe the fresh air of his homelands. We are STILL fighting for Leonard to set his feet down as a free man, and to be released from prison once and for all. How to help #FreeLeonardPeltier! 📲 White House: 202-456-1111 ✉️ White House: whitehouse.gov/contact ✍🏽 Reps & Senators: ndnco.cc/FindYourRep ✍🏽 Leonard and let him know of your support: LEONARD PELTIER #89637-132, USP COLEMAN I, P.O. BOX 1033, COLEMAN, FL 33521 ABOUT LEONARD PELTIER Leonard Peltier, a citizen of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians (ND), activist, member of the American Indian Movement (AIM) and elder, is the longest-serving Indigenous political prisoner in United States history. For nearly 50 years, Indigenous activists, organizers, and allies have spoken out about the flawed prosecution, trial, and conviction that led to Leonard’s unjust incarceration. COINTELPRO (Counter Intelligence Program), was a surveillance operation implemented by the FBI to discredit and defame Black and Indigenous organizers, activists, movements, and revolutionaries in the Red Power and Black Power movements. It was (and still is) common for the US government to send infiltrators into movement spaces to cause paranoia and spread disinformation. At the time of the “shootout” on the Pine Ridge reservation in 1975, the FBI was actively engaged in and funding a covert campaign to suppress the activities of AIM, whose advocacy on behalf of Indigenous people was viewed as “extremist” political activity. #LeonardPeltier #IndigenousActivist #NDNCollective\n\nWhat the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not guarantee is the legal right to take the law into one's own hands. And genocide is a crime against humanity. 'Just after Memorial Day of 1921, a White mob destroyed 35 city blocks of the Greenwood District, a community in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The Tulsa massacre resulted in between 100 and 300 deaths, the decimation of more than 1,200 homes and the burning of churches, schools, businesses, a hospital and library.' I see history repeating itself but now they are called Palestinians. It is not okay to kill all Puerto Ricans because some are criminals. It is not okay to kill all Mexicans because some are criminals. Why is it okay to kill all Palestinians in Gaza because some are Hamas? If we attempt to prosper, there's a problem. If we attempt to survive, there's a problem. What's the real problem?\n\nThere was an interesting Reasons for Judgement published yesterday in the Federal Circuit and Family Court in which a Judge strongly criticized lawyers for treating the court too informally, highlighting a troubling trend of informal communication, including from paralegals and law clerks. The reasons address the need for proper conduct and formality in legal proceedings, making it essential reading for junior lawyers and those who frequently communicate with the courts. The judgment itself states the reasons \"are necessary to address an apparent deterioration in the standard of conduct before the Court, which should not be allowed to endure\". The case involves bankruptcy proceedings in which the Respondent failed to comply with procedural orders. The parties agreed to an extension of time, necessitating the rescheduling of a court date. Consent orders were signed to this effect, and a law clerk provided a copy to the Court in an email stating, \"Please have the Directions hearing relisted in accordance with the Orders.\" Unsurprisingly, the Judge did not appreciate being told what to do and also took issue with the tone of the email, including the 'kind regards' salutation. This led to a directions hearing, where the lawyers were not so gently reminded that \"when exercising a liberty to apply, the terms of that liberty should be observed: it is a liberty to 'apply' for relisting, not a liberty to submit alternate orders for automatic processing.\" \"𝘛𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦 𝘪𝘴 𝘢𝘳𝘨𝘶𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘺 𝘯𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘴𝘰 𝘪𝘯𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘮𝘢𝘭, 𝘰𝘳 𝘱𝘰𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘣𝘭𝘺 𝘢𝘳𝘳𝘰𝘨𝘢𝘯𝘵, 𝘢𝘴 𝘵𝘰 𝘢𝘱𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘢𝘤𝘩 𝘢 𝘊𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘵 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘰𝘳𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘴 𝘸𝘩𝘪𝘤𝘩 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘣𝘦𝘦𝘯 𝘢𝘨𝘳𝘦𝘦𝘥 𝘢𝘮𝘰𝘯𝘨𝘴𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘵𝘪𝘦𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘴𝘪𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘺 𝘱𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘶𝘮𝘦, 𝘰𝘳 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘪𝘯𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘵 𝘤𝘢𝘴𝘦 𝘥𝘪𝘳𝘦𝘤𝘵, 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘺 𝘸𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘣𝘦 𝘮𝘢𝘥𝘦 (𝘰𝘳 𝘵𝘰 𝘶𝘴𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘤𝘦 𝘰𝘧 𝘥𝘢𝘺𝘴’ 𝘱𝘢𝘴𝘵 “𝘳𝘶𝘣𝘣𝘦𝘳-𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘮𝘱𝘦𝘥”: 𝘴𝘦𝘦 𝘉𝘢𝘭𝘢𝘬𝘳𝘪𝘴𝘩𝘯𝘢𝘯 𝘷 𝘔𝘪𝘯𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘐𝘮𝘮𝘪𝘨𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯, 𝘊𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘻𝘦𝘯𝘴𝘩𝘪𝘱 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘔𝘶𝘭𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘶𝘭𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘢𝘭 𝘈𝘧𝘧𝘢𝘪𝘳𝘴 [2023] 𝘍𝘦𝘥𝘊𝘍𝘢𝘮𝘊2𝘎 138 𝘢𝘵 [36]).

I am sick of masked people roaming Toronto. Frightening my friends neighbourhoods, my old coworkers neighborhoods and it’s only a matter of time before it’s in my neighbourhood. Why are masked men and women allowed to terrorize my streets? We need an effective arrest strategy now!! If you pledge allegiance to Hamas, ISIS or Boko Haram you should be arrested. You have declared allegiance to a non-state state with charters antithetical to the Canadian Charter. The number one charter objective of these organizations is murder. Murder of Jews, idolators(Hindus,Yazidis), Christians and apostates. And when you adhere to these charters - we know it’s doesn’t end in just rhetoric - we’ve been watching the murder and mayhem on our screens. In other words while we have been shocked by the violence on our screens they’ve fallen in love with it. The horrific ISIS beheadings, raping and enslaving Yazidi women or Hamas committing these horrific acts of defilement and murder of Jews. They watched the same screens and said “ooh I want to belong to that charter”. I want to carry the flag of that charter. And when a fellow religious compatriot says maybe that’s not a good idea we’ve seen them actually shot dead in a Mississauga restaurant. Picking up a flag, endorsing or in anyway advocating for these organizations is to openly call for murder of “the other”. In other words they want to kill my Jewish neighbours and my neighbours children and they want to kill me - “the idolator” “the other.” Someone whose ancestry falls outside “the book” How is that charter compatible with a democratic charter? Asking for a friend.\n\nJustice for Idris! Justice for Bobrisky! Spraying Money: Culture Clash in the Courtroom. Today, on the #LetsTalkAboutEverything series, we explore the clash between cultural traditions and legal constraints, focusing on the practice of money spraying Recently, the spotlight has turned to Bobrisky, a figure synonymous with the flamboyant display of wealth at social gatherings. His sentencing to 6 months in Jail for abusing the naira has ignited a fiery discussion about tradition versus law Do you stand with Bobrisky? Is money spraying a cultural right or a legal wrong. Spraying money, as celebrated by icons like King Sunny Ade, is more than just an act; it's a deeply ingrained part of our cultural expression. It's a spectacle of joy and generosity. Yet, here we are at a crossroads where cultural practices meet the modern legal framework. How do we, as Nigerians, show off? How do we celebrate our friends? How do our friends recover all the money they have spent for their events? What are your thoughts on the money spraying controversy? Should tradition trump law, or is there a middle ground to be found? #AprilChallenge #30DaysWithIfy\n\nA third young girl has died following a stabbing spree at a Taylor Swift-themed children's event in Southport, UK. The incident occurred on Monday, where two girls, 6-year-old Bebe King and 7-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe, were initially killed, and nine others were injured. On Tuesday, 9-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar succumbed to her injuries in the hospital. Six children and two adults remain in critical condition. The adults are believed to have been trying to protect the children during the attack. The event, a \"Taylor Swift Yoga and Dance Workshop,\" was for children aged 6 to 11. The motive for the attack remains unclear, and a 17-year-old boy from Banks, Lancashire, has been arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. The incident is not being treated as terror-related, and no additional suspects are being sought. Taylor Swift expressed her shock and sorrow on Instagram, describing the situation as a loss of life and innocence and conveying her sympathies to the families affected. What's happening in India?

It's essential to note that the primary concealers of these crimes are Cardinal Archbishop of Barcelona, Juan José Omella, and his predecessor cardinals. Among them, the only living one is the emeritus Cardinal Lluís Martínez Sistach, who, according to public sources and based on a study by Professor Rodríguez, is the utmost responsible party in this context. Also implicated in this veil of concealment is Monsignor Jordi Bertomeu, the Pope's delegate for pedophilia investigations, notably in Chile and recently in Peru.
