        "text": "Rosalía Arteaga presents her latest editorial success in Mozambique and participates in the “Africa 2030” congress\n\nRosalía Arteaga, former president of Ecuador, president of the Foundation for the Integration and Development of Latin America and honorary academician of the Royal European Academy of Doctors-Barcelona 1914 (RAED), was invited on November 20 by the Pedagogical University of Maputo (Mozambique) to present her renowned book “Jerónimo” in the Central Library of this university center, the main one in the country. The work is based on a personal experience of the author, who gives birth to Jerome, a baby with Down syndrome, whose disabilities predict a short prognosis for life. However, the mother, day by day, discovers the characteristics that make her son a special being and builds strong emotional bonds with him and establishes bridges of sensory communication and a welcoming, affective and protective family environment.\n\nThe honorary academician of the RAED took advantage of her stay in this African country to participate in the “Africa 2030: Mozambique as a transformation catalyst” Congress, which was held in the capital on November 20 and 21. Arteaga participated in the round table “Education in the 21st century”. These sessions were organized by the Mozefo project, which aims to be a Mozambique reference forum with regional impact and international influence, and brought together leading international personalities who discussed the future of Africa and the influence in a globalized world that can reach in the 21st century the continent with the youngest population.\n\nThe participants in these conferences shared the objectives of the organizers to create in Mozambique and, by extension, throughout the region, a platform that identifies the key challenges of the continent to achieve accelerated, inclusive and sustainable economic growth based on education, equal opportunities and respect for the environment.\n\nDoctor of Jurisprudence and Anthropology, Arteaga adds to her dedication to politics her passion for education and a vast career as an essayist and poet who has been recognized internationally. The honorary academician of the RAED actively participates in multiple forums and courses on both shores of the Atlantic and is an international reference in the fields of education and sustainable development. She has participated in the main activities organized by the Royal Academy since she was named honorary academician in 2016."
