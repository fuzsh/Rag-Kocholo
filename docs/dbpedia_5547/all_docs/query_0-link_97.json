        "text": "Pope Benedict XVI visited Catalonia on November 7, 2010. The main event of his pastoral trip was the dedication to the cult of the nave of the Sagrada Família and the altar. It was a very happy day for Benedict XVI, cruel and persistently attacked by many enemies inside and outside the Church. That Sunday, he was greeted festively by Catalan Church, with their best jewelry liturgical: the choir of Montserrat, the Marian hymn Virolai, the belief in the Catalan language, unlike Spanish or Latin, says faith in the Catholic Church Apostolic and \"Roman\", etc. It was a holiday of the ugly things of the priests and relativism, to enjoy Gaudí -which caused great anger the young and promiscuous Picasso when he broke a magazine cover drawn by Toulouse Lautrec had been found one of his assistants  and dazzling \"the light of Truth\" -Platonic definition of Beauty, which the architect repeated-, transcendent, absolute and independent of those who seek it, shining in their works. In the Sagrada Família, in the streets around and through television, radio and Internet, the Catalan Church massively participated with great joy and sense of liturgy in the celebration presided over dedication to the worship of the temple of Gaudi and his elevation to the rank of basilica. Benedict XVI spoke repeatedly of Antoni Gaudí. It was not the official Beatification of Antoni Gaudí. Were just the words of the Pontifex Maximus, said in a solemn liturgical celebration on Gaudí's tomb, proclaiming the prime media throughout the world the Christian heroism of the life of Gaudí, praised as role model for Christians and men of good will, and stating that it is a more accurate guides, one of the brighter lights of Christianity today and tomorrow. On Saturday November 6, 2010, on the plane that led him from Rome, he answered questions from journalists accompanying him: In GAUDÍS VISION moreover I perceive three elements above all. The first, is this synthesis between continuity and newness, tradition and creativity. Gaudí had the courage to insert himself into the great tradition of cathedrals, to contribute something new in his century  with a totally new vision  to this reality: the cathedral as a place of the encounter between God and man, in great solemnity; and do this with courage in continuity with tradition but with a new creativity, one that renews tradition. Thus he shows the humanity of history and the progress of history, it is a beautiful thing. Secondly, Gaudí wanted this trinomial: a book of nature, a book of Scripture, a book of the Liturgy. And this synthesis is of great importance precisely today. In the Liturgy, Scripture becomes present, it becomes a reality today. It is no longer a Scripture of 2,000 years ago, but should be celebrated and brought into being, And in the celebration of Scripture creation speaks, creation speaks and finds its true response because, as St Paul tells us, the creature suffers and instead of being destroyed, despised it waits for the children of God, that is, those who see it in Gods light. And so  I think  this synthesis between the sense of creation, Scripture and adoration IS ACTUALLY A VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR TODAY. (...) I place great emphasis on the relationship between faith and reason, that faith, and Christian faith, has its identity only in openness to reason and that reason becomes itself if it transcends itself towards faith. But the relationship between faith and art is equally important because truth, the aim or goal of reason, is expressed in beauty and in beauty becomes itself, is proven to be truth. Therefore, wherever there is truth beauty must be born, wherever human beings are fulfilled in a correct and good way, they express themselves in beauty. The relationship between truth and beauty is inseparable and therefore we need beauty. In the Church from the outset and also in the great modesty and poverty of the time of persecution, art, painting, the expression of Gods salvation in earthly images, singing and then building too, are all constitutive for the Church and remains constitutive for ever. The Church was consequently a mother to art for centuries and centuries: the great treasure of Western art  music, architecture and painting  was born from faith within the Church. Today there is a certain dissidence but this is bad for both art and faith. An art that lost the root of transcendence would not be oriented to God: it would be a halved art, it would lose its living root; and a faith that had art only in the past would no longer be faith in the present; and today it must be expressed anew as truth that is always present. Therefore dialogue or the encounter - I would say both - of art and faith are inscribed in the deepest essence of faith; WE MUST DO OUR UTMOST TO SEE THAT TODAY TOO FAITH IS EXPRESSED IN AUTHENTIC ART, like Gaudís, in continuity and in innovation, and to prevent art from losing its contact with faith. (...) \"I would say that this Journey has the theme of beauty, of the expression of truth in beauty, of the continuity between tradition and renewal. To my mind these two themes of the journey are also a message: to be on a journey, not to lose the way of faith, to seek the beauty of faith, the newness and the tradition of faith that can be expressed and meet in modern beauty, with the world of today. On Saturday November 6, 2010, said: \"As a messenger and witness of the Gospel, I'm going to Barcelona, to encourage the faith of its people friendly and dynamic. A faith planted at the dawn of Christianity, which was germinating and growing in the heat of countless examples of holiness, giving rise to many charities, culture and education. FAITH THAT INSPIRED THE GREAT ARCHITECT ANTONI GAUDI to engage in that city, with the fervor and the collaboration of many, that wonder of the Sagrada Familia. I have the joy of dedicating this temple, WHICH IS REFLECTED IN ALL THE GREATNESS OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT IS OPEN TO GOD. \" And Benedict XVI opened the doors of the temple of the Sagrada Família, which consecrated and elevated to the rank of basilica. He said in his homily: I extend a thankful greeting to Cardinal Lluís Martínez Sistach, Archbishop of Barcelona, for his words of welcome and for his invitation to me to dedicate this Church of the Sagrada Familia, A MAGNIFICENT ACHIEVEMENT OF ENGINEERING, ART AND FAITH. ( ) At this time I would like to mention each and every one of those who have made possible the joy that fills us today, from the promoters to the executors of this work, the architects and the workers, all who in one way or another have given their priceless contribution to the building of this edifice. We remember of course the man who was the soul and the artisan of this project, ANTONI GAUDÍ, A CREATIVE ARCHITECT AND A PRACTISING CHRISTIAN WHO KEPT THE TORCH OF HIS FAITH ALIGHT TO THE END OF HIS LIFE, A LIFE LIVED IN DIGNITY AND ABSOLUTE AUSTERITY. This event is also in a certain sense the high point of the history of this land of Catalonia which, especially since the end of the nineteenth century, has given an abundance of saints and founders, martyrs and Christian poets. It is a history of holiness, artistic and poetic creation, born from the faith, which we gather and present to God today as an offering in this Eucharist. The joy which I feel at presiding at this ceremony became all the greater when I learned that this shrine, since its beginnings, has had a special relationship with Saint Joseph. I have been moved above all by GAUDÍS CONFIDENCE WHEN, IN THE FACE OF MANY DIFFICULTIES, FILLED WITH TRUST IN DIVINE PROVIDENCE, HE WOULD EXCLAIM, SAINT JOSEPH WILL FINISH THIS CHURCH. So it is significant that it is also being dedicated by a Pope whose baptismal name is Joseph. What do we do when we dedicate this church? In the heart of the world, placed before God and mankind, with a humble and joyful act of faith, we raise up this massive material structure, fruit of nature and an immense achievement of human intelligence which gave birth to this work of art. It stands as a visible sign of the invisible God, to whose glory these spires rise like arrows pointing towards absolute light and to the One who is Light, Height and Beauty itself. In this place, GAUDÍ DESIRED TO UNIFY THAT INSPIRATION WHICH CAME TO HIM FROM THE THREE BOOKS WHICH NOURISHED HIM AS A MAN, AS A BELIEVER AND AS AN ARCHITECT: THE BOOK OF NATURE, THE BOOK OF SACRED SCRIPTURE AND THE BOOK OF THE LITURGY. In this way he brought together the reality of the world and the history of salvation, as recounted in the Bible and made present in the liturgy. He made stones, trees and human life part of the church so that all creation might come together in praise of God, but at the same time he brought the sacred images outside so as to place before people the mystery of God revealed in the birth, passion, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. In this way, HE BRILLIANTLY HELPED TO BUILD OUR HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS, ANCHORED IN THE WORLD YET OPEN TO GOD, ENLIGHTENED AND SANCTIFIED BY CHRIST. IN THIS HE ACCOMPLISHED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TASKS OF OUR TIMES: OVERCOMING THE DIVISION BETWEEN HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS AND CHRISTIAN CONSCIOUSNESS, BETWEEN LIVING IN THIS TEMPORAL WORLD AND BEING OPEN TO ETERNAL LIFE, BETWEEN THE BEAUTY OF THINGS AND GOD AS BEAUTY. ANTONI GAUDÍ DID THIS NOT WITH WORDS BUT WITH STONES, LINES, PLANES, AND POINTS. Indeed, beauty is one of mankinds greatest needs; it is the root from which the branches of our peace and the fruits of our hope come forth. Beauty also reveals God because, like him, a work of beauty is pure gratuity; it calls us to freedom and draws us away from selfishness. We have dedicated this sacred space to God, who revealed and gave himself to us in Christ so as to be definitively God among men. The revealed Word, the humanity of Christ and his Church are the three supreme expressions of his self-manifestation and self-giving to mankind. As says Saint Paul in the second reading: Let each man take care how he builds. For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ (1 Cor 3:10-11). The Lord Jesus is the stone which supports the weight of the world, which maintains the cohesion of the Church and brings together in ultimate unity all the achievements of mankind. In him, we have Gods word and presence and from him the Church receives her life, her teaching and her mission. The Church of herself is nothing; she is called to be the sign and instrument of Christ, in pure docility to his authority and in total service to his mandate. The one Christ is the foundation of the one Church. He is the rock on which our faith is built. Building on this faith, let us strive together to show the world the face of God who is love and the only one who can respond to our yearning for fulfilment. This is the great task before us: to show everyone that God is a God of peace not of violence, of freedom not of coercion, of harmony not of discord. In this sense, I consider that the dedication of this church of the Sagrada Familia is an event of great importance, at a time in which man claims to be able to build his life without God, as if God had nothing to say to him. IN THIS MASTERPIECE, GAUDÍ SHOWS US THAT GOD IS THE TRUE MEASURE OF MAN; THAT THE SECRET OF AUTHENTIC ORIGINALITY CONSISTS, AS HE HIMSELF SAID, IN RETURNING TO ONES ORIGIN WHICH IS GOD. GAUDÍ, BY OPENING HIS SPIRIT TO GOD, WAS CAPABLE OF CREATING IN THIS CITY A SPACE OF BEAUTY, FAITH AND HOPE WHICH LEADS MAN TO AN ENCOUNTER WITH HIM WHO IS TRUTH AND BEAUTY ITSELF. THE ARCHITECT EXPRESSED HIS SENTIMENTS IN THE FOLLOWING WORDS: A CHURCH [IS] THE ONLY THING WORTHY OF REPRESENTING THE SOUL OF A PEOPLE, FOR RELIGION IS THE MOST ELEVATED REALITY IN MAN. This affirmation of God brings with it the supreme affirmation and protection of the dignity of each and every man and woman: Do you not know that you are Gods temple? Gods temple is holy, and you are that temple (1 Cor 3:16-17). Here we find joined together the truth and dignity of God and the truth and dignity of man. As we consecrate the altar of this church, which has Christ as its foundation, we are presenting to the world a God who is the friend of man and we invite men and women to become friends of God. This is what we are taught in the case of Zacchaeus, of whom todays gospel speaks (Lk 19:1-10), if we allow God into our hearts and into our world, if we allow Christ to live in our hearts, we will not regret it: we will experience the joy of sharing his very life, as the object of his infinite love. This church began as an initiative of the Association of the Friends of Saint Joseph, who wanted to dedicate it to the Holy Family of Nazareth. The home formed by Jesus, Mary and Joseph has always been regarded as a school of love, prayer and work. The promoters of this church wanted to set before the world love, work and service lived in the presence of God, as the Holy Family lived them. ( ) As I contemplate with ADMIRATION THIS SACRED SPACE OF MARVELLOUS BEAUTY, OF SO MUCH FAITH-FILLED HISTORY, I ASK GOD THAT IN THE LAND OF CATALONIA NEW WITNESSES OF HOLINESS MAY RISE UP AND FLOURISH, AND PRESENT TO THE WORLD THE GREAT SERVICE THAT THE CHURCH CAN AND MUST OFFER TO HUMANITY: TO BE AN ICON OF DIVINE BEAUTY, A BURNING FLAME OF CHARITY, A PATH SO THAT THE WORLD MAY BELIEVE IN THE ONE WHOM GOD HAS SENT (cf. Jn 6:29). ( ) Finally, I wish to commend to the loving protection of the Mother of God, Mary Most Holy, April Rose, Mother of Mercy, all who enter here and all who in word or deed, in silence and prayer, have made this possible this marvel of architecture. After fhe ceremony, Pope Benedict XVI came to the Facade of the Nativity to pray the Angelus with the crowd and said: Today I had the great joy of dedicating this church to him who, being the Son of the Most High, emptied himself and became man, and who, under the watchful care of Joseph and Mary, in the silence of the home of Nazareth, taught us without words of the dignity and the primordial value of marriage and the family. ( ) Filled with devotion to the Holy Family of Nazareth, a devotion spread among the Catalan people by Saint Joseph Manyanet, THE GENIUS OF ANTONI GAUDÍ, INSPIRED BY THE ARDOUR OF HIS CHRISTIAN FAITH, SUCCEEDED IN RAISING THIS SANCTUARY AS A HYMN OF PRAISE TO GOD CARVED IN STONE. A PRAISE OF GOD WHICH, AS WITH THE BIRTH OF CHRIST, HAS HAD AS ITS PROTAGONISTS THE MOST HUMBLE AND SIMPLE OF PEOPLE. IN EFFECT, GAUDÍ, THROUGH HIS WORK, SOUGHT TO BRING THE GOSPEL TO EVERYONE. FOR THIS REASON, HE CONCEIVED OF THE THREE PORTICOS OF THE EXTERIOR OF THE CHURCH AS A CATECHESIS ON THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST, AS A GREAT ROSARY, WHICH IS THE PRAYER OF ORDINARY PEOPLE, A PRAYER IN WHICH ARE CONTEMPLATED THE JOYFUL, SORROWFUL AND GLORIOUS MYSTERIES OF OUR LORD. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE PARISH PRIEST GIL PARÉS, HE ALSO DESIGNED AND FINANCED FROM HIS OWN SAVINGS THE CREATION OF A SCHOOL FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE WORKERS AND OF THE POOREST FAMILIES OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, WHICH WAS AT THAT TIME A OUTLYING SUBURB OF BARCELONA. HE BROUGHT CONCRETE REALITY TO THE CONVICTION, SAYING: THE POOR MUST ALWAYS FIND A WELCOME IN THE CHURCH, WHICH IS AN EXPRESSION OF CHRISTIAN CHARITY. During lunch at the Episcopal Palace, Benedict XVI to the bishops confessed guests: \"It was an unforgettable day that will serve to evangelization.\" And he said to cardinal Martinez Sistach, Archbishop of Barcelona: It was a celebration I will never forget. In the afternoon, Benedict XVI visited the welfare fund of Nen Deu, where he said: \"The dedication of the Basilica of the Sagrada Familia this morning has highlighted that churches are the sign of the true sanctuary of God among men.\" And to say goodbye at the El Prat airport, said: \"I HAVE HAD THE IMMENSE JOY OF CONSECRATING THE BASILICA OF THE SAGRADA FAMILIA, WHICH GAUDÍ CONCEIVED AS A MONUMENT OF PRAISE IN STONE TO GOD. I also visited an important charitable institution of the Church. They stand in todays Barcelona as two symbols of the fruitfulness of that faith which has marked this people deeply and which, through charity and the mystery of Gods beauty, contributes to the creation of a society more worthy of man. Truly, beauty, holiness and the love of God enable people to live with hope in this world.\" Returned to Rome at the general audience on Wednesday November 10, 2010, Benedict XVI recalled: \"On Sunday I had a really great joy to preside, in Barcelona, the dedication of the church of the Sagrada Família, which I have declared a Minor Basilica. In contemplating the grandeur and beauty of this building, which invites the eye and raise soul to heaven, to God, I remembered the great religious buildings as the cathedrals of the Middle Ages, which have profoundly marked the history and image of the major cities of Europe. This splendid book, rich in religious symbolism, precious entanglement forms, in the fascinating game of light and color, almost an immense stone carving, THE FRUIT OF THE DEEP FAITH, SPIRITUAL SENSITIVITY AND ARTISTIC TALENT OF ANTONI GAUDI, refers us to the sanctuary, the place of real worship, Heaven, where Christ was raised to stand before God on our behalf (cf. Heb 9:24). THE GREAT ARCHITECT IN THIS MAGNIFICENT TEMPLE HAS REPRESENTED ADMIRABILY THE MYSTERY OF THE CHURCH, which the faithful are incorporated by baptism as living stones to build a spiritual house (cf. 1 Pet 2.5). CHURCH OF THE HOLY FAMILY WAS CONCEIVED AND DESIGNED BY GAUDI AS A LEAVEN ABOUT JESUS CHRIST AS A HYMN OF PRAISE TO THE CREATOR. SO STUNNING IN THIS BUILDING, PUT HIS GENIUS IN THE SERVICE OF BEAUTY. Indeed, the extraordinary ability and expressive forms of symbolic and artistic motifs, as well as innovative techniques of architecture and sculpture, evoking the ultimate source of all beauty. THE FAMOUS ARCHITECT CONSIDER THIS WORK AS A MISSION IN THEM INVOLVED HIS WHOLE PERSON. FROM THE TIME YOU ACCEPTED THE ORDER OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS CHURCH, HIS LIFE WAS MARKED BY A PROFOUND CHANGE. TOGETHER WITH AN INTENSE PRACTICE OF PRAYER, FASTING AND POVERTY, FELT THE NEED TO PREPARE SPIRITUALLY IN ORDER TO EXPRESS THE FACT MATERIAL THE UNFATHOMABLE MYSTERY OF GOD. CAN YOU SAY THAT, BUT WORKED IN THE CONSTRUCTION GAUDÍ TEMPLE, GOD WAS BUILT IN THE SPIRITUAL BUILDING (cf. Eph 2:22), STRENGTHENED IN FAITH AND GROW IN INTIMACY WITH CHRIST. CONSTANTLY INSPIRED BY NATURE, THE CREATION, AND DEDICATED WITH PASSION TO KNOW THE SCRIPTURE AND LITURGY, WAS ABLE TO DO IN THE HEART OF THE CITY BUILDING WORTHY OF GOD AND THEREFORE WORTHY OF MAN. \"\n\nJosep Maria Tarragona, November 11, 2010"
