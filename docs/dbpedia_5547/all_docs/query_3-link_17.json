It provides students with a solid foundation in the basic patterns of spoken and written Basque (e.g., grammar, vocabulary, sociolinguistic norms) and emphasizes all four skills: speaking, listening, writing, and reading. This course is intended for students with no previous exposure to Basque and for those who need an in-depth review of the patterns of the language.\n\n2024-2025 Autumn\n\nBASQ 21100 Basque Culture and Society\n\nCrosslistings\n\nSPAN 21101, GLST 21100\n\nStraddling the border of southern France and northern Spain, the Basque Country is the home of a complex national community without a state -but with a language that is unrelated to any other in the world and is perhaps the most remarkable feature of their cultural identity. Through the analysis of a wide variety of texts and artifacts, this course will give students the the background to navigate through different dimensions of Basque culture (traditions, gastronomy, music, the language) as well as the history that has marked the development of Basque society (including the so-called Basque Conflict). Taught in English. Prior knowledge of Basque language or culture not required.\n\n2024-2025 Winter\n\nBASQ 24730 The Revitalization of the Basque Language\n\nCrosslistings\n\nSPAN 24730, LING 24730\n\nIn the last 30 years, the Basque language has seen an increase in the number of speakers, especially among younger groups. The implementation of several language and cultural policies, along with a transformation in the educational system, has been key to this development. In this course we will explore these revitalizing practices used in the Basque Country by analyzing the sociolinguistic situation of Basque language from the transition to democracy in the late 1970s to the present. Taught in English.\n\n2024-2025 Spring\n\nCATA 12200 Catalan for Speakers of Romance Languages I\n\nThis course is intended for speakers of other Romance languages to quickly develop competence in spoken and written Catalan.

We study a wide range of its cultural manifestations (architecture, paintings, music, arts of the body, literature, cinema, gastronomy). Attention is also paid to some sociolinguistic issues, such as the coexistence of Catalan and Spanish, and the standardization of Catalan. The course will be conducted in English.\n\n2024-2025 Spring\n\nCATA 21950 \"Dark Stairways of Desire\": Lusting beyond the Norm in Contemporary Catalan Literature\n\nCrosslistings\n\nGNSE 23150, SPAN 21950, GLST 21950\n\nAlthough we can find a significant number of authors exploring queer desire and identities throughout the history of Catalan Literature (from lesbian scenes in Joanot Martorell's \"Tirant lo blanc\" to expanding gender identities in Maria Aurèlia Capmany's \"Quim/Quima\"), more recent Catalan Literature is blooming with queerness and non-normative lust. This course will give an overview of contemporary Catalan works influenced by feminist and queer debates from the seventies on. Beginning with renowned poet Maria Mercè Marçal's only novel, \"The Passion According to Rennée Vivien,\" winner of several of the most prestigious literary awards for Catalan Literature, we will go on to discover 21st-century works by Eva Baltasar and Anna Punsoda. We will also read poems, short stories and excerpts from authors such as Maria Sevilla, Mireia Calafell, Raquel Santanera, Sebastià Portell, Sil Bel and Ian Bermúdez, among others.Taught in English.\n\n2024-2025 Winter\n\nCATA 23500 Alone in the Mountains: Tales of Freedom and Violence in Contemporary Catalan Literature\n\nCrosslistings\n\nSPAN 23501, GNSE 23157, GLST 23500\n\nFrom witches to \"goges\" (\"water women\"), Catalan folklore shows a tradition of women living on their own in the mountains, liberated from societal conventions. These women are portrayed as fascinating yet threatening figures. This ancient imagery has permeated contemporary literature, manifested in novels that depict women who remove themselves from \"civilization\" to inhabit rural areas of Catalunya, seeking freedom and having to confront at the same time societal norms, abusive partners or even their own personal demons. The mountains, far from ideal and peaceful, are an untamed and often brutal space in which human lives hold no greater value than those of goats, mushrooms, rivers. In this course we shall engage with four novels authored by women: \"Solitude (1904) by Victor Català, \"Stone in a Landslide\" (1984) by Maria Barbal, \"When I Sing Mountains Dance\" (2019) by Irene Solà, and \"Alone\" (2021) by Carlota Gurt. Through the analysis of these literary works, we aim to delve into Catalan culture and explore its literary archetypes, while establishing significant connections among these texts and their place in modern and contemporary literature. Taught in English, but students seeking credit for the HLBS major/minor must do part of the readings and written work in Catalan or Spanish as necessary for their degree.\n\n2024-2025 Autumn\n\nCATA 26525 Literatura política en el Siglo de Oro\n\nCrosslistings\n\nSPAN 26525, CATA 36525, SPAN 36525\n\nTBD\n\nEulàlia Miralles\n\n2024-2025 Spring\n\nFREN 10100 Beginning Elementary French I\n\nThis course-intended for students who have no previous knowledge of French and for those who need an in-depth review of the very basic patterns of the language-is the first in a three-part language sequence that provides beginning students with a solid foundation in the linguistic and sociocultural norms necessary for everyday communication in the French-speaking world.

French, Francophone, and North American perspectives (20th-21st c.)\n\nCrosslistings\n\nGNSE 23172, CMLT 24725\n\nThis course explores modern and contemporary feminism through a transatlantic lens. We will consider three major moments and sites of a multi-centered conversation. First, we will explore the modernist desire for cosmopolitanism which drew writers across the Atlantic (Simone de Beauvoir's adventures in the US; Djuna Barnes and Gertrude Stein's lives in Paris). In the central part of the quarter, we will focus on the period between 1960 and 1990 which witnessed intense conversation and contestation between a French paradigm of \"écriture féminine\" (Hélène Cixous, Monique Wittig), and the rivalling practices and theories in America (from Adrienne Rich and Mary Daly to Judith Butler). Finally, we will explore the ways in which feminist thought has endeavored to account for race, class, rurality, and disability (from Maryse Condé to Aurélie Olivier and Roseline Lambert). The course will explore various media (novels, poetry, theater and performance, film), and various ways to engage critically and creatively with this history of transatlantic feminism.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nTaught in English but reading knowledge of French is required. Students taking this class for French credit must have taken FREN 20500, 20503 or a literature course taught in French, and will complete assignments in French.\n\n2024-2025 Winter\n\nFREN 25725 Mental Health Conditions in French and Francophone Literature\n\nThis course aims to survey the representation of mental health conditions in French and Francophone literature from the Middle Ages to the 20th/21st century. We will address three main categories of conditions: 1) neurodivergence/high-functioning mental illness, 2) severe mental illness, and 3) gender dysphoria and sexuality-related issues. Through these readings, the student will gain an interdisciplinary knowledge of contemporary diagnostic criteria and psychological theory as well as the sociohistorical discourse surrounding mental health during the given time period for each of the prominent French and Francophone writers and/or texts. We will investigate links between authors and texts with these mental health conditions - examining the author as a typical/atypical unit and the text as either a reflection and/or object of that condition - and how history, society and culture influence its representation in the French and Francophone context.

Simultaneously, we will consider the stakes of moving away from traditional representations of the ocean as a blank canvas for human movement, to instead consider it as a vibrant material and multispecies space. This course will encourage students to formulate their own approaches to cutting-edge debates in archipelagic theory and critical ocean studies, and to situate those debates within the broader fields of environmental humanities and postcolonial studies.

Sociological and psychological studies have underscored the importance of female roles in relation to mafia organizations, notwithstanding the rigid patriarchal structure that allows only male affiliation. One of the main goals of this class is for students to gain an understanding of different Italian mafias and to get a deeper comprehension of the construction of gender in a selection of films centered around these organizations. We will also discuss how movies contribute to the perception of organized crime. This class will draw on a variety of fields, including sociology, gender studies, and film studies. Taught in English.

While the written page has allowed these practices to endure over time, they were also, and often primarily, transmitted through the bodies of performers. Is it possible to reconstruct the voices beyond the page? How does thinking about performance enhance our understanding of the artistic product and, moreover, of the society where this product originated? What are the political implications of the binary division between the written page and the human voice? Why are oral practices largely excluded from the literary canon? Is there a correlation between marginalized oral practices and queerness? The content of this course will consist of various Italian oral practices, ranging from the courtly lyric poetry of the Middle Ages to the contemporary spoken word scene. Additionally, the course will focus on female and queer voices, with the goal of tracing a parallel between the ephemerality of performances and the marginalization of communities. The course will integrate artistic content with theoretical material on the topic of voice, as well as insights from feminist and queer studies, media studies, and performance theory. At the end of the course, students will produce their own creative project with the purpose of answering the following question: how does thinking about performance from a practical point of view help to inform our understanding of performance from a theoretical perspective? Class will be conducted in English with a separate discussion section available for students seeking credit for the Italian major/minor. Readings will be in Italian and in English.\n\n2024-2025 Autumn\n\nITAL 23325 (In)Visible Women from Dante to Elena Ferrante: Bodies, Power, Identity\n\nCrosslistings\n\nGNSE 12128\n\nThis course introduces students to both historical and current perspectives on gender, with a focus on Italian literature and cinema (14th-21st century). We will examine the representation of women in literature, as discussed in a variety of texts, including Dante's Divine Comedy, Machiavelli's comedies, and Elena Ferrante's novels. We will investigate key issues raised in and by women-authored works, across historical periods as varied as the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and Fascism. And we will also explore conceptualizations of gender and sexuality in Italian and international films, unpacking concepts such as gaze, desire, and intersectionality. As students study topics such as identity, construction of difference, feminism and antifeminism, they will acquire the critical vocabulary to describe, interpret, and formulate arguments about women's agency in literature, film, culture, and society. Taught in English.\n\n2024-2025 Winter\n\nITAL 23425 Love in the Middle Ages\n\nCrosslistings\n\nMDVL 23425\n\nThis course examines the theme of love in the literary production of late medieval Italy. We will privilege the tension between profane and sacred love, around which Italian writers take different postures. The variety of possible attitudes is wide and ranges from enthusiastic or painful representations of love passion to rejections of profane love, from daring experiments in the blending of sacred and profane love to representations of their irremediable dichotomy. Through close readings of poems and prose texts, we will see how these different attitudes not only explore the complex nature of love and love poetry, but also enter into dialogue with the historical context of 13th- and 14th-century Italy. In particular, we will probe how the literary debate on love sheds light on the socio-political and cultural developments of the time. Readings will include texts by Sicilian poets, Guittone d'Arezzo, Guido Guinizzelli, Bonagiunta Orbicciani, Guido Cavalcanti, Dante Alighieri, Francesco Petrarch and Giovanni Boccaccio, among others. Taught in Italian.\n\n2024-2025 Spring\n\nITAL 23625 Middle Ages on Film\n\nCrosslistings\n\nMDVL 23625\n\nThis course will explore cinematic representations of the European middle ages. Ranging from the silent era to the present day, from arthouse pictures to swashbuckling epics, we will consider the uses of medievalism in the modern imagination. Where do these cultural fantasies come from? How do they change over time? How do they relate to the academic disciplines of history and medieval studies? And what role does cinema play in these questions? Screenings will be complemented with readings both from medieval source documents and from contemporary film and cultural theory. Works discussed will include \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" (Carl Theodor Dreyer, 1929), \"The Flowers of Saint Francis\" (Roberto Rossellini, 1950), \"The Seventh Seal\" (Ingmar Bergman, 1957), \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" (1975), \"Braveheart\" (Mel Gibson, 1995), and \"Hard to be a God\" (Aleksei German, 2014), among others.
