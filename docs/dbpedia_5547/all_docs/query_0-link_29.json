OUR TOP STORIES:\n\nJANUARY 17th, SAINT ANTHONY ABAD, GAUDÍ’S DAY\n\nWe wish all Gaudí fans a happy 17th of January, day of Saint Anthony, a day which our illustrious \"architect of God\" celebrated with great devotion.\n\nLIFE AND WORKS OF SAINT ANTHONY:\n\nSaint Anthony Abad was a monk, historically known as the founder of the Cenobite movement. His life and works were recorded in the work \"Lives of Saints\" by Saint Atanasio and Saint Geronimo, collected by the Genovese dominican Santiago de la Vorágine in the 13th century. It is known that he distributed his wealth and belongings among the poor in order to live a hermit's life and founded several monastic communities. It is said that he lived to the age of 105, performing so many miracles that today he is revered as the patron saint of animals, farmers, undertakers, hermits, as well as pig and cattle farmers, among others.\n\nSaint Anthony\n\nTHE LEYEND:\n\nIt is told that he was born in the village of Coma, near Heraclea, Egypt. At the age of 20 he decided to distribute his wealth and live in an ascetic community, sleeping in an empty shrine. Later he went to live in the desert in absolute solitude, constantly facing temptations sent by the devil. The temptation of Saint Anthony are a favorite theme of Christian iconography, represented by various painters of churches and chapels. The legend tells how he came to be the patron saint of animals: on one occasion he was visited by a wild boar with her blind babies. Saint Anthony healed the little ones and, from that moment on, was accompanied by the wild boar. Over time the legend changed the wild boar to a piglet, and that is how he is normally represented: with a piglet at his feet.\n\nThe temptation of Saint Anthony, by Salvador Dalí\n\nSAN ANTHONY AND THE ARTS:\n\nOne of the best known pictorial representations is:\n\n“The temptations of Saint Anthony” by Hieronymus Bosch.\n\nAlthough, without a doubt, the most famous work is the one by Salvador Dalí titled:\n\n“The temptation of Saint Anthony”\n\nTHE FESTIVITY OF THE THREE TOMBS IN IGUALADA\n\nThe celebration of Saint Anthony is a thousand-year-old tradition in the town of Igualada, composed of various acts, the most famous being the procession, led by the saint on an impressive float drawn by animals, seeking the benediction of Saint Anthony for a fruitful year. The devoted, accompanied by their domestic and field-working animals, have to make three rounds around the church in order to receive the blessing of the patron saint. The election of the pubilla, who also participates in the procession on the float, and the distribution of the bread of Saint Anthony among the pilgrims and citizens watching the procession brings the celebration of this illustrious and venerated Saint to an end.\n\nPHOTO GALLERY OF THE CELEBRATION The \"arrieros\" - carriers - were in charge of transporting merchandise on their carts and horses, a work done by trucks today. The celebration of Saint Anthony honored their work of braving the elements and traveling all night if necessary. Saint Anthony presiding the procession on a commemorative cart. Mª Teresa Costa Ribera, the elected \"pubilla\" saluting her fellowcitizens of Igualada.\n\nTHE SAGRADA FAMILIA RECEIVED MORE THAN 2.5 MILLION VISITORS IN 2006\n\nEl inacabado templo\n\nThe temple of the Sagrada Familia received a total of 2,543,279 visitors in 2006. According to sources at the institution, this represents an increase of 180,000 compard to 2005 and makes it the most visited tourist site in Catalonia.\n\nThe entrance fee is 8 Euros and an extra 2 Euros for taking the lift up to the towers.\n\nAmong last year's advances the most visible is the central nave, where the choir and the grand pulpit are almost completed. Their completion is forecast for this year. Work is continuing on the Glory facade and the towers topping the roof of the central nave.\n\nState of the construction work on the Sagrada Familia\n\nDetail of the interior of the temple which shows the advanced state of ar it should be possible to celebrate the liturgy in the central nave, as it should be finished.

WEB NEWS\n\nTHE PRESS AROUND THE WORLD SPEAKS ABOUT THE SAGRADA FAMILIA\n\nA unique work of architecture: the Sagrada Familia: a \"gem\" that has been under construction since 1883\n\nThe Nativity Scene Like no other city in the world, Barcelona received the gift of the architectural talent of Antoni Gaudí (1852 - 1926), who managed to blend his artistic inspiration with his work leaving exemplary buildings that transcended their use and time to become genuine works of art. The pinnacle of these is the temple of the Sagrada Familia, a pharaonic project that was started in 1883 and is still under construction. Gaudí was 31 years old when he accepted the challenge to take over the recently begun work from another architect. He decided to completely redesign the original project in his own personal style. He devoted the remaining 43 years of his life passionately to this work, the last 15 years of it exclusively.\n\nHe projected a temple with four distinct facades - all of them full of symbolism - and 18 towers. Up to this date only 55% of the work has been completed and it is estimated that another 20-25 years will be necessary for its completion. During the Spanish Civil War work was stopped and even the architect's workshop was destroyed. Many outlines and models were lost. What was saved has been used since 1940 to renew the construction as true as possible to Gaudí's spirit.\n\nIn the forefront of this work are the architects Francesc Quintana, Puig Boada and Lluis Bonet Garí, while J. Busquets is in charge of the scuñptural work. In the Passion facade the main body of sculptures is the work of Josep María Subirachs. Gaudí only designed the first facade, which refers to the birth of Jesus Christ. The work is permeated by the artist's desire to emulate nature, the center of the temple is filled with columns representing a great forest, the stairways imitate the endless spirals of snails, among the numerous allegories of beauty. Today work is proceeding quickly. It is no longer dependent only on donations, but can count to a large part on the visits of many followers and tourists that come from all over the world to admire this unique work of art.\n\nGAUDÍ'S MONUMENTS ARE THE MOST VISITED ON THE INTERNET\n\nIt is Gaudí who is the subject of the greatest number of on-line searches and who has the greatest number of fans among private individuals as well as architects.\n\nGaudí in internet\n\nThe works of the star architect Antoni Gaudí are the most visited on the internet. This is the conclusion of Great Buildings, the most visited architectural portal in the world that puts Gaudí at number one on its list.\n\nFour of Gaudí's monuments are among the 30 most visited in the world. The Sagrada Familia is 5th on the list and in the highest position. The Casa Batlló is 11th, La Perdrera is 17th. Last on the list is the Parque Güell, also part of the 30 most visited in the world.\n\n3. GAUDÍ NEWS\n\nEXHIBITION: “BARCELONA AND MODERNISM, FROM GAUDÍ TO DALÍ”, AT THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM IN NEW YORK\n\nMetropolitan Museum of Art in Nueva York\n\nThe most comprehensive exhibition on Barcelona modernism held up to date in the united states will be celebrated from March to June at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Nueva York. . This exhibition presents a new outlook on Barcelona and Gaudí; among the highlights will be two of he best paintings of Picasso's blue period, paintings by Ramón Casas, the work \"La Granja\" by Miró, the painting \"Café de Montmarte\" by Santiago Rusiñol, the landscape \"La piedra en el estanque\" by Jiaquim Mir, a selection of surrealist paintings by Dalí and representations of Gaudí's architectural work.\n\nThe exhibition also dedicates a chapter to the Bohemian restaurant 'Els quatre gats'\", established by Casas and Rusiñol in 1897, where artists and bohemians of barcelona met, and where Picasso in 1900, at the age of 18, had his first individual exhibition. Drawings, models, additions and original finishes of masterpieces like the Casa Milá and the temple of the Sagrada Familia, by Gaudí, and the Palacio de la Música Catalana, by Lluís Doménech, will be included as examples of architecture. Original manifests and newspapers of the time will be shown to accompany these works.\n\nThe exhibition is organized by the Cleveland Museum of Art, where it will be shown until next January, the Met and the National Museum of Art of Catalonia, in barcelona, and is sponsored by Caixa Catalunya, Obra Social and the Generalitat de Catalunya.\n\nTHE SAGRADA FAMILIA IN DANGER !!! ...\n\n... CONTINUING PROTESTS AGAINST THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE AVE AND ITS ROUTE PASSING CLOSE TO THE SAGRADA FAMILIA\n\nA very explicit photo of a sign of protest against the AVE in the Plaza de Sant Jaume.\n\nConstruction work for the AVE (high speed train) have caused cracks in buildings in some of Barcelona's suburbs, where work is in progress at the moment. This has caused alarm among Barcelona's inhabitants who fear that the Sagrada Familia might collapse. On the 27th there was a big demonstration of concerned citizens against the planned route of the AVE...\n\nWill they reach their goal???\n\nIn spite of public opposition the blindness of the government, which does not want to change the planned route of the AVE underneath Calle Mallorca, could provoke the collapse of the temple of the Sagrada Familia by Gaudí. And then...\n\nWho will be responsible...???\n\nNeighbors hang signs of protest on the facades of their houses\n\nA NEW ATTACK ON THE WORK OF ANTONI GAUDÍ\n\nThis unfortunate attack was carried out against one of the few public works of Antoni Gaudí\n\nAnother attack against the architect's work is that which happened to the fountain, designed by Gaudí, in the garden of the house of the Count Güell, today's Palacio de Pedralbes.\n\nWe hope to be able to clear up this mutilation, which was carried out using very sophisticated stone-cutting machinery and with no other purpose than to destroy this monument. An irreperable loss.\n\nLuis Gueilburt\n\nAcademic director of the Gaudí workshop\n\nEPSEB UPC.\n\n4. GAUDÍ AGENDA\n\nGAUDÍ AND THE SAGRADA FAMILIA IN ARGENTINA On the 6th and 7th of December, 2006, a conference entitled \"Antoni Gaudí, architect of God\" was held in the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nThe architect José Manuel Almuzara in the middle of the conference.\n\nDuring this conference the architect and president of the Association for the Beatification of Antoni Gaudí, José Manuel Almuzara, held a speech with the help of visual aids about the life and work of the artist.\n\nhe main theme of the conference was the temple of the Sagrada Familia, on which the architect worked during the last 40 years of his life and which was the testimony of his Christian faith and is also called a \"catechism in stone\".\n\nhe Argentine lawyer working in Rome, Silvia Coreale, is working on the beatification of the illustrious architect Antoni Gaudí, about whom she says that \"he sanctified himself in his profession as an architect\".\n\n5. SOCIETY\n\nBOOK: \"ARTISTIC AND RELIGIOUS HERITAGE OF BARCELONA\"\n\nIn commemoration of the 50th anniversary of his obtaining the degree of architect Professor Bassegoda has published the book \"El Patrimonio Artístico Religioso de Barcelona\". Considering his prolific literary work, more than 200 books, the best way for the Gaudí Chair to celebrate such an important event was certainly the publication of a new book. Thank you Professor Bassegoda and congratulations for your great literary production.\n\nDr. Bassegoda: architect, writer, university professor and Gaudí fan to the roots, at his desk wishing all members of the Gaudí Club a Happy New Year 2007.\n\n6.
