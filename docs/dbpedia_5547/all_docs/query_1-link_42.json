        "text": "This is important. I think about the rage I have felt the past few months - this has been a low ebb of anger for the perpetrators who often have a trauma history themselves but a full blown furnace for the lawyers and institutions who protect the perpetrators from being accountable and therefore from getting the support they need to change behaviours. The lawyers who blame the victim, put the accountability for the violence onto the victim, cause immense distress for the victim and who delete information, who whitewash and who cover up the crime. The lawyers for huge sums of money, deliberately finding the loopholes to protect the perpetrators. Doesn’t help anyone but the lawyers and institutional leadership. Because the victim and perpetrators who need the trauma support and help don’t get what they need. Imagine being able to cut out and bypass these corrupt legal fat cats doing risk management and Spindoctoring and hiding evidence. Thanks for the work you do Louise Milligan\n\nNot inappropriate ❌ Not a relationship❌ Not a sexual preference ❌ Not a sexual behavior ❌ ✅Sexual abuse. Call this what it is, sexual abuse. Predators in religious institutions, as I discuss directly in my book, exploit the faithful to protect themselves. Often calling on tenants of forgiveness, forcing families to avoid contacting the civil authorities. This case, which should see the inside of a courtroom, is a clear example of GAS and illustrates that the grooming process happens anywhere we have the necessary ingredients. Every religious institution must open their eyes to the potential for abuses and actively prevent predation through their policies and enforcement. If you currently suspect abuse within your religious community, you must contact civil authorities. Then, report abuses or suspicious behavior to religious leaders. Not the other way around. #duckduckgroom #preparednotparanoid #therapisttips\n\nNo Mercy for Rapists: NO Means NO Sexual violence is not just an act of physical harm; it is an assault on the very dignity and humanity of a person. This artwork symbolizes the darkness that looms over victims and the urgent need for society to stand firm against perpetrators. We must raise our voices louder, ensure stricter laws, and create an environment where every individual feels safe and respected. There can be no tolerance for those who violate the fundamental rights of others. Together, let’s demand justice and support survivors. Let’s make it clear: NO means NO and there’s no excuse for those who choose to ignore it. #NoMercy #NoMeansNo #EndSexualViolence #JusticeForSurvivors #StopRape\n\n#sos #stoppress #love @drjohndunn @EdwardPentin @mfjlewis @jesuitczerny @CardinalNichols @CardinalSean @CardinalDolan @cardinalrlburke @CardinalNapier @CardRavasi @angeloscola @washingtonpost @CatholicHerald @TheSpectator @STForeign @thetimes @NCRegister @dianemontagna @LifeNewsHQ @0xfoxi Let me explain to you what everybody knows CARDINAL OMELLA COVERS UP FIVE NICHES OF SEXUAL ABUSE EVIDENCE The primary concealers of these crimes are Cardinal Juan José Omella and his predecessor. It's essential to note that the primary concealers of these crimes are Cardinal Archbishop of Barcelona, Juan José Omella, and his predecessor cardinals. Among them, the only living one is the emeritus Cardinal Lluís Martínez Sistach, who, according to public sources and based on a study by Professor Rodríguez, is the utmost responsible party in this context. Also implicated in this veil of concealment is Monsignor Jordi Bertomeu, the Pope's delegate for pedophilia investigations, notably in Chile and recently in Peru.

I can’t stop thinking about it. The episode explores the nationwide issues around Parental Alienation in the Family Courts and the current devastating shortcomings regarding protection for victims of child sexual abuse. Such issues have resulted in cases of children being failed, and forced to live with their abuser. I’m finding it difficult to find the words, and I certainly won’t do the issue justice trying to summarise it on a tiny LinkedIn post, but please do give the segment a listen. It is truly emotive and angering, and an important listen for everyone. * Segment starts at 03:38\n\n#sos #stoppress #love @drjohndunn @EdwardPentin @mfjlewis @jesuitczerny @CardinalNichols @CardinalSean @CardinalDolan @cardinalrlburke @CardinalNapier @CardRavasi @angeloscola @washingtonpost @CatholicHerald @TheSpectator @STForeign @thetimes @NCRegister @dianemontagna @LifeNewsHQ @0xfoxi https://lnkd.in/euuvArhA Let me explain to you what everybody knows CARDINAL OMELLA COVERS UP FIVE NICHES OF SEXUAL ABUSE EVIDENCE The primary concealers of these crimes are Cardinal Juan José Omella and his predecessor It's essential to note that the primary concealers of these crimes are Cardinal Archbishop of Barcelona, Juan José Omella, and his predecessor cardinals.

Also implicated in this veil of concealment is Monsignor Jordi Bertomeu, the Pope's delegate for pedophilia investigations, notably in Chile and recently in Peru. It should be underscored that this situation doesn't astonish us. As I've reiterated on multiple occasions, \"El País\" newspaper includes these individuals in its list of concealers, both in an article published on its website and in a report personally delivered to Pope Francis at the Vatican by a reporter from the mentioned outlet. According to this information, Cardinal Omella himself is on that list. This information leads us to the unavoidable conclusion that, even though the current Pope is aware of the situation, no action has been taken. Within this context, it is particularly alarming that Omella continues to be Pope Francis's delegate in Spain, tasked with addressing this severe issue.
