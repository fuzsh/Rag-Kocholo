The GRAMMY Museum, in cooperation with Ringo Starr, debuted a major new exhibition, Ringo: Peace & Love on June 12, 2013. This one-of-a-kind, limited-run exhibit offers visitors an unprecedented in-depth look at all aspects of Starr’s musical and creative life – as a musician, artist, actor, and as the man the world knows and loves simply as ‘Ringo.’ It also aims to propel Starr’s universal message of peace and love.

Ringo: Peace & Love is both the first major exhibit ever dedicated to a drummer and the first to explore the extraordinary career of the 7-time GRAMMY Award® winner. The scope of exhibit spans Ringo’s early life growing up in Liverpool, from Raving Texans turned Rory Storm, from The Beatles, to becoming a solo artist and then to the All Starrs with whom he is on tour now – this unique collection brings together diverse artifacts, rare and never before seen photographs, documents, personal letters and footage.

Ringo: Peace & Love is located on the second floor and includes:

The drum kit Ringo played on Let It Be, Abbey Road, and The White Album

The drum kit he played on the Ed Sullivan Show

Ringo’s Sgt Pepper suit

The red jacket worn during the filming of the Beatles’ rooftop concert

Personal letters, photographs and documents from the Star Key family and Ringo’s days with the Beatles

It’s also an interactive exhibit, where visitors can take a drum lesson with Ringo.

“Ringo: Peace & Love” was on display until April 27, 2014 in The GRAMMY Museum’s Special Exhibits Gallery.
