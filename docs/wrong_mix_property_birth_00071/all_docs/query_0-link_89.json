        "text": "Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nÂ Expand images\n\nPaul McCartney was born in Liverpool, England, on June 18, 1942. He was raised in the city and educated at the Liverpool Institute.\n\nThe son of a musician, McCartney wrote his first song at the age of 14. Shortly thereafter, with schoolmate George Harrison, he met John Lennon and other local musicians playing in a band called The Quarrymen. After a succession of name changes, the group adopted bass player Stuart Sutcliffeâs suggestion of âThe Beatlesâ (a nod to Buddy Holly and the Crickets) and began playing the clubs in Hamburg, Germany. Sutcliffe quit the band to resume his art studies in 1961 and Ringo Starr replaced drummer Peter Best in 1962, before the group achieved its now-legendary success. During the bandâs eight-year history (1962-1970), the Beatles produced 55 singles, 27 studio albums and two live albums.\n\nAs a writer or co-writer (with John Lennon) of The Beatlesâ songbook, McCartney changed the world of music—all before the age of 30. Hit albums include: âPlease Please Me,â âRevolver,â âHelp!,â âSgt. Pepperâs Lonely Hearts Club Bandâ and âThe White Album.â\n\nMcCartney has continued to push musical boundaries over the past 40 years, first as a solo artist, then again as a member of the group Wings (with hit albums that included âBand On The Runâ and âWings at The Speed Of Soundâ) and then again as a solo artist, with works such as âMemory Almost Full.â Most recently he received critical acclaim with âThe Firemanâ (a collaborative project with revered producer Youth) for the 2008 âElectric Argumentsâ album.\n\nAn accomplished, award-winning classical composer, McCartneyâs âEcce Cor Meumâ (âBehold My Heartâ) was released in September 2006 and won the 2007 Best Album Award at the Classical Brit Awards.\n\nHe was awarded a special Outstanding Contribution Award at the 2008 BRIT Awards at Earls Court in London. He was given a standing ovation by the UK music industry as he received his award and closed the prestigious ceremony with an incredible performance. Months later, Yale University presented him with an honorary doctorate of music. As he received his diploma, University President Richard C. Levin told him, âYour songs awakened a generation, giving a fresh sound to rock ânâ roll, and rhythm and blues. We admire your musical genius and your generous support of worthy causes.â\n\nMcCartney has spent much of the past five years performing sold-out concerts to millions of people all over the world, to rave reviews. In the summer of 2009 he embarked on a five-week tour of the United States. The tour began with shows at New Yorkâs new Citi Field Stadium, the site of the former Shea Stadium. He joined Billy Joel on stage for the âLast Play At Shea,â on the site where The Beatles first performed in 1965, setting the precedent for the modern-day stadium rock show. Critics hailed the Citi Field performances—seen by more than 120,000 people—as the concert experience of a lifetime. The U.S. tour concluded in Dallas on Aug. 20, 2009.\n\nMcCartney is committed to a number of charities including PETA, LIPA, One Voice, The Vegetarian Society, Nordoff Robins, and Adopt-A-Minefield.\n\nHe is also a Freeman of the City of Liverpool and lead patron of the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts (which he founded in his old school). In 1995, he was appointed Fellow of The Royal College of Music in 1995 by The Prince of Wales. The following year, the boy from Liverpool was knighted by H.M. the Queen of England for his services to music."
