        "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (September 24, 2023) — Music and culture icon, Ringo Starr, was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame during a private ceremony Sunday, September 24 at the Musicians Hall of Fame & Museum, in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nMusicians Hall of Fame & Museum CEO Linda Chambers was joined by presenters Brenda Lee and Peter Frampton, who spoke to their experiences with Starr and his musical, cultural and charitable contributions.\n\nIn order to manage health concerns relating to flu and COVID, a very limited number of guests were able to be part of this event, but even with a small number of attendees the energy was still at peak.\n\nThe curated tribute band included Danny Rader (Music Director/Guitar), Mark Beckett (Drums), Jimmie Lee Sloas (Bass), Jerry McPherson (Electric Guitar), Blair Masters (Keyboard), and Sam Levine (Saxophone) and Cliff Downs on background vocals.\n\nAdditional tribute performers included Rodney Crowell, Felix Cavaliere, Steve Lukathur, Wendy Moten, and alumnus of Fisk Jubilee Singers.\n\nOf the moment, Starr says, \"Wow what a lovely tribute - thank you Linda, Peter, Brenda and everyone at the Musicians Hall of Fame for all of this. I am really touched and honored to be here and to accept the first Joe Chambers Musicians Legacy award. I’ve always loved Nashville, and country music, though I know this place honors all musicians regardless of genre or instrument. I’ve had a long happy relationship with this town and it’s really lovely to be here and to be receiving this award. I want to thank Steve (Lukather), Wendy (Moten) and all these fine musicians for playing here today. So, with that I send you all Peace and Love - thanks for coming. See you at the Ryman!\"\n\nChambers adds, “It is an honor to induct the legendary Ringo Starr into the Musicians Hall of Fame this afternoon. It would have meant the world to Joe to have been here today, but in spirit, and through the Joe Chambers Musicians Legacy Award, we know he’s here with us. Ringo – you have contributed immeasurably through your music and philanthropy on a global level, and we couldn’t be more proud to welcome you into our Hall of Fame family. Welcome, Ringo!”\n\nStarr’s private induction follows the November 22, 2022 ceremony and concert inducting Billy F Gibbons, Don McLean, Marty Stuart and The Fabulous Superlatives (Chris Scruggs, Harry Stinson, Kenny Vaughan, and Mick Conley), Ray Stevens, and Vince Gill — along with engineer George Massenburg and producer James William Guercio.\n\nFollowing the ceremony, Starr joined his All-Starr band at the Historic Ryman Auditorium, a venue close to Ringo's heart, and did what he and his band do best - played a solid show to a sold-out crowd.\n\nAbout Musicians Hall of Fame & Museum:\n\nJoe Chambers was an accomplished musician and songwriter, and, as a couple, Joe and Linda Chambers opened a chain of guitar stores, Chambers Guitars. The couple co-founded and opened the Musicians Hall of Fame & Museum in 2006 on 6th Avenue South. They relocated to what is now known as the Musicians Hall of Fame & Museum at Nashville’s Historic Municipal Auditorium in 2013 and also houses the GRAMMY Gallery.\n\nThe museum, revered by artists including Keith Richards, Garth Brooks and Neil Young, recently added exhibits featuring Alan Parsons, Marshall Tucker Band and drummer, Stan Lynch.\n\nThe mission of the Musicians Hall of Fame & Museum is to honor all great musicians regardless of genre or instruments. This is done by exhibiting the actual instrument they used to record some of the most iconic songs in recorded history. Not only does the Musicians Hall of Fame & Museum entertain local and international visitors but also educates them about the musicians who actually played on the “soundtracks of their lives.”\n\nThe Musicians Hall of Fame & Museum is a 501 (c) (3) charity organization.\n\n“Where else are you gonna get all the cats that are in this room?” — Keith Richards\n\n“You can see the hood ornament on the car if you go to The Rock ’n’ Roll Hall of Fame. But, if you want to look at the engine and see what’s making it go, then you go to The Musicians Hall of Fame & Museum.” — Neil Young\n\n“There’s so many things that an artist sings that aren’t his or her own creation. There’s so many things that you hear that make you love a record that, the truth is, ‘Joe Blow’ could have sang them. Because the song was so great and the signature licks were so identifiable that it didn’t matter who sang them. There are very few records that the artists made, but there’s a hell of a lot of them that the musicians made.” — Garth Brooks"
