        "text": "Classic rock artists such as Jimmy Page and Phil Collins were in attendance at the Mojo Awards in London on Wednesday night as two of their legendary peers were rewarded for their lifetime achievements. Ringo Starr took home the Icon Award, and Donovan took home the Maverick Award.\n\nStarr talked to reporters and addressed the rumor that he would perform alongside Paul McCartney at the London Summer Olympics next year. Ultimate Classic Rock reported two weeks ago that this reunion would not happen, and Starr confirmed this, stating that he would be touring in the U.S. at the time, making it logistically impossible.\n\nThe Mojo Awards (or Mojo Honours List) is an awards ceremony begun in 2004 by Mojo Magazine, an excellent British music magazine known for covering classic rock artists in great detail, as well as newer bands. This year's \"Song of the Year\" award went to alt-rock band Grinderman for 'Heathen Song.'\n\nThe Full List of Mojo Award Winners:\n\nBreakthrough Award - Rumer\n\nSong of the Year Award - 'Heathen Song' by Grinderman\n\nBest Album Award - 'Suck it and See' by Arctic Monkeys (editor's note: awesome band!)\n\nClassic Album Award - 'Screamadelica' by Primal Scream\n\nBest Live Act Award - John Grant\n\nLes Paul Award - Steve Cropper\n\nCompilation of the Year Award - 'Sweet Inspiration: Songs of Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham' - Various Artists\n\nCatalogue Release of the Year Award - 'Coals to Newcastle' by Orange Juice\n\nMerit Award - Martha and the Vandellas\n\nMedal Award - Bob Harris\n\nHero Award - Eddie Floyd\n\nMaverick Award - Donovan\n\nInspiration Award - Gary Numan\n\nClassic Songwriter Award - Squeeze\n\nVision Award - Upside Down\n\nOutstanding Contribution to Music - Public Image Ltd\n\nIcon Award - Ringo Starr\n\nHall of Fame Award - Brian Wilson"
