        "text": "Father’s Day is a great holiday, and we want to show our appreciation by giving away two sets of tickets to Ringo Starr & His All Starr Band’s performance at the Durham Performing Arts Center on June 22.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nLeave a comment about your favorite memory with your dad. Share something special that the two of you experienced, check it over for spelling and grammar, and click submit!\n\nThis will enter you for a chance to win two tickets to this event. Four tickets total will be awarded. Only one winner per household is eligible.\n\nTickets entail access to the VIP President’s Club at DPAC. This includes VIP seating, VIP parking, VIP ticket concierge service, access to the VIP President’s Lounge and more.\n\nContest will end Thursday, June 19 at 11:59 p.m. EST and winners will be announced on Friday.\n\nSimple! A good story about your dad should be at least two paragraphs long, have plenty of wholesome lessons, at least one reference to walking home uphill in the snow both ways, and should make four people cry before you post it. Just kidding, of course, except for the part about it being at least two paragraphs; a decent story should have some length to it.\n\nYou can’t win if you don’t try, and we know that everyone has at least one story about their father. Take a second to tap one out and you could be getting the VIP treatment at DPAC!\n\nFrom the DPAC’s website:\n\n“Straight from winning the Grammy® Lifetime Achievement Award, one of two surviving Beatles members Ringo Starr is set to return to the DPAC stage June 22 performing live with his All Starr Band. In addition to one of the world’s brightest musical luminaries Ringo Starr, his band includes acclaimed musicians Steve Lukather of Toto, Richard Page of Mr. Mister, Gregg Rolie of Santana and Journey, Todd Rundgren, Warren Ham and Gregg Bissonette. For his performance at DPAC, Ringo will perform a number of his hits from The Beatles plus songs from his All Starr bandmates.”"
