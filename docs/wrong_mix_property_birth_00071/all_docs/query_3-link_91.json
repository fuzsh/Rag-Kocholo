        "text": "Ringo Starr, known worldwide from his drumming days with The Beatles, will bring his tour — and his appropriately named All-Starr Band — to Mershon Auditorium at the Wexner Center for the Arts on the Ohio State University campus on Oct. 10.\n\nTickets, which went on sale Friday morning, have already sold out.\n\nBorn Richard Starkey, the 82-year-old Starr has been playing in bands since his teens and joined what he deemed \"the biggest band in the land\" shortly after his 22nd birthday in 1962. Often referred to as \"the funny Beatle\" because of his wry wit, he penned the Fab Four classic \"Octopus's Garden,\" and sang lead on \"Yellow Submarine\" and \"With a Little Help From My Friends.\"\n\nRock Starr: Ringo Starr: The former Beatles drummer's life and career in pictures\n\nStarr launched his solo career in 1970, a year before the Beatles disbanded. He has recorded 18 studio albums, including his eponymous 1973 release, which yielded the hits “Photograph” and “You’re Sixteen (You’re Beautiful and You’re Mine).\" Other Top 10 singles include \"It Don't Come Easy,\" “Only You (And You Alone)\" and the humorous \"The No-No Song.\"\n\nDuring his 60-plus years in the music business, Starr has earned nine Grammys and has twice been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, first as a Beatle and then as a solo artist. He also has acted in over 15 films and received an Academy Award with The Beatles for Best Original Song Score for the film \"Let it Be.\"\n\nSince 1989, Starr has assembled a revolving roster of rockers for his All-Starr Band, which includes such notable alumni as his son Zak Starkey, Joe Walsh, Clarence Clemmons, Dr. John, Billy Preston, Todd Rundgren, John Entwistle, Sheila E, John Waite, Billy Squier and Peter Frampton.\n\nThe latest incarnation of the All-Starrs — who will play with Starr at Mershon — features Men at Work singer Colin Hay, Toto guitarist/singer Steve Lukather, jazz/rock drummer Gregg Bissonette, keyboardist/singer Edgar Winter, Average White Band bassist Hamish Stuart, and Kansas/Toto multi-instrumentalist Warren Ham."
