According to real birth data compiled from 20 years of American births, more people are born on September 9th than any day of the year. Whenever your birthday is, now you can celebrate with a new birthday song written by Diane Warren and performed by Pentatonix with the legendary Ringo Starr on drums.\n\n“We are so honored to collaborate with industry legends Diane Warren, Pentatonix and Ringo Starr to introduce the next great birthday song,” said Rob Matousek, executive director, direct-to-consumer business at American Greetings. “As a global leader in celebrations, we thought there was no better way to help release the song than with an ecard collection to allow the celebratory message to be shared and cherished by our users and these incredible artists’ fans.”\n\nThe eloquent lyrics of “Happy Birthday Beautiful” call out the birthday person as a “natural wonder” that “broke the mold” and promises to “raise a glass” and “shout it loud” in celebration of them on their big day. The timing of the song and ecard release could not be more appropriate as mid-September is the most birthday-packed time of the year. Even Warren herself celebrates her birthday on September 7th.\n\n“I wanted to write a song that breathed new life into the classic birthday songs we know and love,” said Warren. “Collaborating with such talented artists as Ringo Starr and Pentatonix, as well as the designers at American Greetings, allowed us to blend musical and design elements together to add new excitement to birthday celebrations.”\n\n“I was happy to play drums on this song when my friend Diane asked, and I think it’s great it is coming out around the time of her birthday – Happy Birthday beautiful! Peace and love, Ringo.”\n\nTo match the upbeat and celebratory theme, the “Happy Birthday Beautiful” ecard collection features vibrant colors and contemporary birthday imagery along with messages that acknowledge the song’s lyrics.
