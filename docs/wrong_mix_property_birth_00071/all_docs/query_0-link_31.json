        "text": "Join The Tung Auditorium – on Ringo’s birthday – to celebrate the music of Sir Ringo Starr. Presented by Mike C from Detroit as ‘Ringer Star’ with his amazing Peace Band UK in an evening of nostalgia, fun and great music.\n\nRinger Star took the Beatles entertainment community by storm in 2013 by debuting in Liverpool, Brazil, Canada and the USA – all in his very first year.\n\nAs you might imagine, Ringer causes quite a stir everywhere he appears, and when he does you will usually find him cheerfully being photographed and signing 100s of autographs for fans. Ringer Star is the only current looking Ringo Starr tribute artist in the world, and many say he has a frightening resemblance to the man himself.\n\nRinger has developed his Ringo persona, demeanour, and English accent to deliver the most accurate portrayal of Ringo Starr’s style and singing voice possible, and just so happens to be a very proficient drummer, which makes Ringer the complete package!\n\nEvent Date: Friday 7th July 2023\n\nCategories: Archive | Music\n\nContact Details: The Tung Auditorium, Tel: 0151 794 1500"
