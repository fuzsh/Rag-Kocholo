        "text": "Peace and love. The historic Jefferson Theatre (345 Fannin St.) in downtown Beaumont will buzz with “Beatlemania” on Saturday, Nov. 19, as the Liverpool Legends return to Beaumont to give music fans the complete Beatles’ experience at 7:30 p.m.\n\nNo introduction is needed for the “Fab Four,” which includes Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, the late John Lennon and the late George Harrison.\n\nToday, hundreds of acts consider themselves Beatle tribute bands, but only one can say they have a direct, biological link to the original Fab Four – the Liverpool Legends. Tickets start at $25 and can be purchased online at ticketmaster.com or at the Jefferson Theatre, day of show.\n\nFour talented musicians and actors were handpicked by Louise Harrison, sister of the late George Harrison, and have performed around the world for nearly a decade. “Liverpool Legends presents the very best portrayal of the Beatles since the only four guys to play the Beatles were John, Paul, George and Ringo,” she said.\n\nLiverpool Legends will perform songs spanning the entire career of The Beatles through the solo years. With precise attention to every musical detail, along with costume changes, vintage instruments and special effects, Liverpool Legends will make you feel like you are watching the real thing.\n\nMembers of the group have toured the world, playing in historic venues such as Carnegie Hall, The Cavern Club in Liverpool, recording at the famed Abbey Road Studios in London and performing with Denny Laine (co-founder of Wings with Paul McCartney), Pete Best (the original Beatles drummer) and the Boston Pops. They appeared on The Travel Channel’s “Beatlemania Britain” and headlined “International Beatles Week” in Liverpool where 100,000 Beatles fans jammed Victoria Street to hear them in concert.\n\nFor more information, view beaumonteventstx.com or call (409) 838-3435."
