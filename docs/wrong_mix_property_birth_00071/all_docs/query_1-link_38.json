        "text": "Amna Nawaz:\n\nHe was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice. He's been knighted. He's acted in many films and on TV, including as Mr. Conductor right here on PBS.\n\nTo the world, he is simply Ringo. Ringo Starr, former Beatles drummer, now 83 years old, has a new recording out this month and is on tour.\n\nJeffrey Brown joined him in Los Angeles for our arts and culture series, Canvas.\n\nJeffrey Brown:\n\nHe's youthful and fit, as recognizable as when the Beatles first took the world by storm nearly 60 years ago, performing with his own All-Starr Band, which he's led in various forms since 1989 and now releasing a new E.P. titled \"Rewind Forward.\"\n\nFor Ringo Starr the music has always been there.\n\nRingo Starr:\n\nI don't know. It's like magic. Oh, yes, I just love music. I love — and I wanted to play. And there's not a lot of point being the drummer if you have no one else. What would you do, just me and the drums?\n\n(Laughter)\n\nJeffrey Brown:\n\nThe others would become John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison, together, The Beatles, the most, beloved important and influential band in rock 'n' roll history.\n\nBy his mid-20s, Ringo was world-famous, giving the Beatles a backbeat and a whole lot of personality. But he started life as Richard Starkey, a sickly child in and out of hospitals, a poor kid trying to make his way in working-class Liverpool, England.\n\nWe talked about it recently at the Sunset Marquis, a famed Hollywood hotel, complete with its own NightBird recording studio in the basement.\n\nRingo Starr:\n\nWell, it all felt like it was something I was doing until I could do what I wanted to do, which was play.\n\nAnd the first band I was in was a factory band. We used to play at the — in the lunch hour to the men. And they'd all be telling us to leave, in not quite a nice way.\n\n(Laughter)\n\nJeffrey Brown:\n\nHe eventually joined Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, one of the top bands in Liverpool, then got to know another up-and-coming group with a different drummer at the time, The Beatles, up close when both bands were booked into the same Hamburg, Germany, club.\n\nRingo Starr:\n\nIt was 12 hours at the weekend between two bands, so you get to know your own band. But we would try and top them. They would try and top us. And the top wasn't very high then, but we were still — we want the crowd, and they want the crowd.\n\nSo it was a great learning space.\n\nJeffrey Brown:\n\nThe Beatles asked Ringo to join them, and the rest, of course, is history. And what history, especially if you were on the inside.\n\nIn the hotel's photo gallery, Ringo noticed a 1964 shot of the group with Muhammad Ali, then still Cassius Clay.\n\nRingo Starr:\n\nYes. Yes. And I come from a port where every other house had someone who was in the merchant navy. And they would bring records over.\n\nAnd so we heard a lot of sort of country and blues and stuff that England wasn't getting first.\n\nRingo Starr:\n\nGot three brothers, and we were very close. And besides the touring, when — we always shared a room. We only ever got two rooms. It was important, and I think part of our makeup, that we stayed together and closeness, and we really got to know each other and knew where we're coming from.\n\nAnd that certainly happened.\n\nRingo Starr:\n\nThe interesting thing that not a lot of people know is that, when I'd first present my songs, the rest of the band would be rolling on the floor laughing, because I'd really just rewritten some other song.\n\nIt wasn't my song at all. I just, like, reworded it. And they would say, yes, sure.\n\n(Laughter)\n\nRingo Starr:\n\nPeter Jackson was going to do it. We would hook up in L.A. several times. And we'd find parts. And I kept telling him, we were laughing. We were brothers. We had arguments. We had fun.\n\nAnd we're playing with each other. And I have — it's not all that dark.\n\nJeffrey Brown:\n\nAfter the breakup, each Beatle went solo. Ringo, now his own front man, had a string of hits, including \"It Don't Come Easy.\" In fact, he says it didn't.\n\nYou have also talked about some of the difficulties there, including struggles.\n\nRingo Starr:\n\nWell, the first — when it was first split up, I sat in the garden, wondering what to do. It was like, that's it now. What — you're so used to that job. And we worked a lot.\n\nBut then, suddenly, well, it's over. And it's really over. Yes, I had a moment of, like, reflection. And I started to play with other artists.\n\nRingo Starr:\n\nOur audiences are bigger than they were and younger than they were. It's really weird, far out. And we will see.\n\nThere's no guarantee, but we're doing it with our heart a blazing."
