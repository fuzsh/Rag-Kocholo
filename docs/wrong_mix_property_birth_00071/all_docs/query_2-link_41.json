        "text": "Adele took home her very first Primetime Emmy in 2022 for her CBS concert special Adele One Night Only. The win added to her collection of 15 Grammys and the Oscar she won in 2013 for “Skyfall,” leaving her just a Tony Award short of clinching an EGOT.\n\nCher began the road to an EGOT back in 1988 when she won the Oscar for best actress for her role as Loretta Castorini opposite Nicolas Cage’s Ronny Camareri in Moonstruck. Somewhat remarkably, her sole competitive Grammy (best dance recording) came in 2000 for “Believe.” In 2003, Cher: The Farewell Tour took home the Primetime Emmy for outstanding variety, music or comedy special. So basically, all it will take for Cher to round out her EGOT is a Broadway staging of Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again! Can you hear the Tony Award, Fernando?\n\nHalf of Common‘s prospective EGOT stems from his song “Glory” alone. The powerful duet with John Legend soundtracked the 2014 historical drama Selma, and earned the pair both the Academy Award for best original song and a Grammy for best song written for visual media. The rapper had already won two other Grammys by that point — one more than a decade earlier for 2003’s “Love of My Life (An Ode to Hip-Hop)” with Erykah Badu and another in 2008 for “Southside” with Kanye West. Common’s lone Emmy came a couple years post-Glory, when Ava DuVernay enlisted him to write “Letter to the Free” for her 2016 Netflix documentary 13th.\n\nShould Eminem ever choose to adapt his life story for the Great White Way, a Tony Award is the only thing he’s missing to EGOT. Over the course of his more than 20-year career, the man born Marshall Mathers has collected 15 Grammys out of 44 nominations, and is one of just eight artists to earn double-digit nominations in a single night (10, back in 2011). Meanwhile, 8 Mile anthem “Lose Yourself” won Eminem two of those Grammys, and also an Oscar for best original song. And his Emmy Award came thanks to his show-stopping Super Bowl LVI halftime show performance alongside Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, Kendrick Lamar and 50 Cent.\n\nSir Paul McCartney has been racking up Grammy Awards since his days as a Beatle, beginning with the earth-shaking group’s best new artist win in 1965. In addition to his 18 Grammys, he’s also been named MusiCares’ Person of the Year and has been honored with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award twice — in 1990 for his solo music and again in 2014 with the rest of The Beatles. He also received an Academy Award with Ringo, John and George in 1971 for Let It Be. McCartney’s Emmy Award came much more recently, for the 2021 Peter Jackson-helmed documentary series The Beatles: Get Back.\n\nTrent Reznor and Atticus Ross have won two Grammys, two Oscars and an Emmy as a team. They won Grammys for best score soundtrack for visual media for 2013’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and 2020’s Soul. The pair’s two Academy Awards, each for best original score, arrived a full decade apart — for 2010’s The Social Network and later for Soul, collaborating on the latter with Jon Batiste. In 2020, they won an Emmy for composing the music for the acclaimed pilot episode of the HBO superhero drama Watchmen. In addition, Reznor (but not Ross) has won two Grammys for work with Nine Inch Nails.\n\nMuch like his old bandmate Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr picked up many of his most well-known accolades with The Beatles, including seven Grammy Awards, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, a Grammy Trustees Award, and 15 entries in the Grammy Hall of Fame. The band also won an Oscar for their 1970 documentary Let It Be. And while the drummer was nominated for a Daytime Emmy for his role as Mr. Conductor in the 1989 children’s series Shining Time Station, he earned his first Emmy in 2022 as an executive producer of The Beatles: Get Back.\n\nIt seems unthinkable that Barbra Streisand has gone her entire career without winning a Tony Award, but it’s the only trophy keeping the legend from achieving EGOT status. (For the record, she was nominated twice for her roles on Broadway in 1962’s I Can Get It For You Wholesale — her debut at 19 years old — and as the original Fanny Brice in 1964’s Funny Girl. She was awarded a special Tony honor as star of the decade in 1970, but has yet to win a competitive Tony.) Of course, Streisand would go on to win her first Academy Award for the big screen adaptation of Funny Girl, followed by another win in 1977 for A Star Is Born‘s “Evergreen.” She’s also added four Emmys to her collection across the decades, dating back to her first TV special, My Name Is Barbra, in 1965.\n\nThough he’s conquered music, movies and Broadway, Elton John has yet to win an Emmy Award during his storied career. It took 16 years after he was first nominated for a Grammy for the “Hold Me Closer” singer to walk away with his first award — as part of the legendary foursome on Dionne & Friends’ “That’s What Friends Are For.” He’s won best original song at the Oscars twice — for “Can You Feel the Love Tonight” from 1994’s The Lion King and “(I’m Gonna) Love Me Again” from his 2019 musical biopic Rocketman. And while he’s perhaps best known on the Great White Way for composing the music to the still-running The Lion King, it was actually the score for 2000’s Aida that won Sir Elton his Tony Award.\n\nCyndi Lauper kicked off her career by being awarded best new artist at the 1985 Grammy Awards. She’s since added another golden gramophone for writing and co-producing the songs for Broadway’s Kinky Boots, a feat that also won her the Tony Award for best original score in 2013. And unlike several other musicians aiming for an EGOT, the pop singer’s Emmy win actually came for acting thanks to her guest turn on Mad About You back in the mid-’90s.\n\nBette Midler is another almost-EGOT who started her career with a best new artist win at the Grammys in 1974. That same year, she was awarded a Special Tony Award, but didn’t take her own acting award until 2018 when she headlined the acclaimed Broadway revival of Hello, Dolly! In between those two victories, she also added two more Grammys and three Primetime Emmys to her collection, leaving just an Academy Award out of her grasp despite nominations for best actress in both 1979 (The Rose) and 1991 (For the Boys).\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda came close to achieving EGOT status when his Encanto ballad “Dos Oruguitas” was nominated for best original song at the 2022 Academy Awards. However, it was the playwright’s smash hit “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” that was performed at the ceremony by the cast of the animated movie alongside Megan Thee Stallion, Becky G and Luis Fonsi. And while Miranda still needs an Oscar to round out his awards achievement, he’s already earned three Grammys, two Primetime Emmys and three Tonys.\n\nThree-fourths of Ben Platt‘s near-EGOT have come thanks to his role in Dear Evan Hansen, whether the Broadway smash was winning him the Tony Award for best leading actor in a musical, the Grammy for best musical theater album or a Daytime Emmy for performing Act 1 closer “You Will Be Found” on the TODAY Show. However, his reprise as Evan in the big-screen adaptation didn’t garner the Oscar love the Sing for Me Instead crooner was probably hoping for, and he still needs an Academy Award to round out the Big Four.\n\nJulie Andrews won both an Academy Award and a Grammy for her iconic role as Mary Poppins in the 1964 Disney classic. She’s since earned an additional Grammy, plus a lifetime achievement award in 2011. The musical legend has also picked up two Emmys across her decades of work, but has yet to win a Tony despite three best actress nominations (for 1957’s My Fair Lady, 1961’s Camelot and 1996’s Victor/Victoria — the latter of which she declined after feeling the rest of the production’s company had been overlooked by the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League).\n\nYou just remember what your old pal said! Randy Newman may have written Toy Story‘s iconic ode to friendship back in 1995, but it wasn’t until 2001 — and 15 nominations — that he took home his first Oscar for “If I Didn’t Have You” from Monsters Inc. (Don’t worry, his second came nearly a decade later for Toy Story 3‘s “We Belong Together.”) He was awarded his first of seven Grammys back in 1985 for composing the music for Robert Redford’s 1984 sports film The Natural. Meanwhile, he’s scored three Emmys for his work on Cop Rock and Monk, leaving him in need of a Tony to reach EGOT status.\n\nAs one of America’s most prolific composers, John Williams has been nominated for a stunning 52 Oscars, having won five over the course of his career for such film classics as Jaws, Star Wars and Schindler’s List. And while he has three Emmys to his name, the musician is most decorated by the Grammys, winning 25 out of 72 nominations so far. Having focused primarily on film, he’s still a Tony short of EGOT-ing.\n\nWith 28 awards to his name, Quincy Jones is tied with Beyoncé as the second most-awarded person in Grammys history behind British-Hungarian conductor Georg Solti. (The legendary musician has also been the recipient of the Grammy Trustees Award, the Grammy Legend Award and the MusiCares Person of the Year throughout his 70-year career.) By contrast, his lone Emmy came in 1977 for composing the music for Roots. While he was first nominated for a Tony for producing The Color Purple on Broadway in 2006, he took home the trophy for the show’s revival ten years later. And though Jones has been nominated for an Academy Award seven times, dating back to 1967’s In Cold Blood, he remains an Oscar short of an EGOT."
