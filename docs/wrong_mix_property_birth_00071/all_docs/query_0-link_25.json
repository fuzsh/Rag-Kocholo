        "text": "From Wikipedia:\n\nThe title of Freedom of the City is an honorary title granted by a city or corporation. It is granted to individuals to recognise exceptional services, usually to the city, or occasionally to the nation. Since the enactment of the Honorary Freedom of Boroughs Act 1885, councils of boroughs and cities in England and Wales have been permitted to resolve to admit “persons of distinction” to be honorary freemen. This list is based on that published by the City of Liverpool.\n\nThe City of Liverpool granted the four Beatles with the title of Honorary Freedom of the City of Liverpool, on March 7, 1984. An official ceremony for Paul McCartney was organized on November 28th, 1984, prior to the first UK screening of “Give My Regards To Broad Street“ at the Odeon Cinema. From Club Sandwich N°35, 1984:\n\nHe received a gold-framed scroll honouring him as a Freeman of the City. Hundreds of fans gathered outside the library to greet him in the centre of Liverpool, a few minutes walk from the Cavern Club. The ceremony was widely covered by television crews and journalists both from the UK and abroad.\n\nFrom Club Sandwich N°35, 1984\n\nFrom Liverpool Echo, November 23, 2014:\n\nHands in his pockets, Paul McCartney walked up to the podium to receive Liverpool’s highest honour. The Liverpool legend accepted the Freedom of the City award […] in November 1984.\n\nBeatles tunes filled the book-lined room in the Picton Library as the Lord Mayor handed the Freedom scroll to Paul, the only surviving band member to collect his in person.\n\nHe said afterwards: “I’d like to think it’s the people of Liverpool giving it to me. If that’s true, it’s the greatest honour.”\n\nSurprisingly, the Beatles only received their awards 14 years after breaking up. Liverpool councillors in their 1960s heyday apparently disliked the band’s celebrity lifestyle. […]\n\nI did feel very nervous, but it’s a great honour. I would like to think it’s the people of Liverpool giving it to me. If that’s true, then it’s the greatest honour.\n\nPaul McCartney, during a press conference in the Picton Library"
