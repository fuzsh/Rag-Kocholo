        "text": "Beatles legend Ringo Starr paid tribute to Australian rock icon Colin Hay at the annual APRA awards on Thursday night, after the former Men at Work frontman won an award for outstanding services to Australian music.\n\n“Colin, you deserve it and I love you,” said Starr, via video.“It’s always my pleasure being on stage with you, and I’m sure the people tonight will enjoy you as much as I do. So I say peace and love, peace and love to Australia.”\n\nHay, who has been acknowledged in the ARIA Hall of Fame, currently plays alongside the former Beatles drummer in the Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. He won the Ted Albert APRA award – whose previous winners include The Wiggles and The Seekers – alongside veteran promoter Colleen Ironside who died in July last year.\n\nAlongside Starr’s surprise appearance, American actor and director Zach Braff (Scrubs, A Good Person) also appeared via video to pay tribute to Hay, who featured in episodes of the comedy series Scrubs and had his song I Just Don’t Think I’ll Ever Get Over You included in Braff’s debut film, Garden State.\n\n“Your music has meant so much to me at many different phases of my life. When I was young, I listened to Men at Work and then when I was fresh out of college your solo music really was transformational for me,” Braff said. “You continue to blow me away.”\n\nHosted by Celia Pacquola, Fred Leone and Henry Wagons at the Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre, the 41st Australian Performing Rights Association’s awards saw the top prize, song of the year, go to Sydney DJ Flume (aka Harley Streten) for his hit Say Nothing featuring MAY-A and co-written by Sarah Aarons.\n\nThe 31-year-old topped Triple J’s Hottest 100 this year and won APRA’s songwriter of the year in 2017.\n\n“This song came about during COVID,” Flume said in his acceptance speech. “This song was done from all corners of the globe, in all different cities, and ramshackled together to be something that has obviously connected with people – we’re really grateful to make something that does that.”\n\nMelbourne-based Zambian singer and rapper Sampa the Great won breakthrough songwriter of the year, while Sydney’s electronic group RÜFÜS DU SOL (comprising Tyrone Lindqvist, Jon George and James Hunt) took home both songwriter of the year and most performed dance/electronic work for On My Knees – the group’s first APRA awards.\n\n“We feel really blessed and grateful we can get the nod from the room and everyone in Australia,” said the band, who accepted the award remotely from their Mexico tour. “Seeing the list of artists that have received this award before, it’s really surreal to put our name next to those artists. So, thank you so much. It really means, so, so, so much.”\n\nDance Monkey, released in 2019, remains a global hit, earning Tones And I the award for most performed Australian work overseas, for the second year in a row. Meanwhile, last year’s songwriting champion The Kid Laroi continued raking in the accolades, as STAY – co-written with Justin Bieber – won most performed Australian work and pop work."
