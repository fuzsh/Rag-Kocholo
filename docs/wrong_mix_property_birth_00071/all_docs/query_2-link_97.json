        "text": "Starr received a standing ovation at the ceremony where Mojo editor-in-chief Phil Alexander listed the drummer’s many achievements.\n\n“Ringo was the backbeat of one of the greatest bands of all time,” Alexander said.\n\n“He’s the man who sang With A Little Help From My Friends. He’s the only guy to ever visit the Octopus’s Garden. The man who directed T Rex’s Born To Boogie. Oh, and he’s the voice of Thomas the Tank Engine.\n\n“There is and only ever will be one Ringo Starr.”\n\nStarr’s talents have been underrated since John Lennon’s famous quip, when asked if his bandmate was the best drummer in the world, that “he’s not even the best drummer in tbe Beatles”.\n\nSpeaking at the ceremony in east London, fellow musician Phil Collins said of Starr: “He’s a fantastic drummer. That’s been overlooked for years. Everybody talks about him being the joker, the cheeky chap, but he’s a great musician.”\n\nStarr, 71, said he was delighted to win the Mojo Icon Award. He also squashed the rumours that he will team up with Sir Paul McCartney at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony, claiming that he will be touring the US at the time.\n\nOther winners at the Glenfiddich Mojo Honours included Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.\n\nHe thanked his British fans with a line from one of his songs: “God only knows what I’d be without you.”\n\nThe biggest ovation of the night was for Motown legend Martha Reeves of Martha and the Vandellas, who announced that she had just turned 70 then broke into an impromptu version of Jimmy Mack.\n\nArctic Monkeys, who were overlooked in this week’s Mercury Prize nominations, won best album for Suck It And See. The classic album award went to Primal Scream for 1991’s Screamadelica."
