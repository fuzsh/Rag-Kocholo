        "text": "A large mural of musician Ringo Starr has been unveiled on the site of a former pub just streets away from the former Beatles' childhood home in Liverpool.\n\nCreated by artist John Culshaw, the colourful artwork covers the entire walk of what used to be the Empress pub in Toxteth, which Starr had paid tribute to on the cover of his first solo album in 1970.\n\nCulshaw's choice of site was fitting since Beatles fans continue to regularly visit the site, even in the years after the pub closed down.\n\nCulshaw, who has also painted a number of football-themed murals across the city, sketched out the initial design in late February.\n\nA Beatles-themed hotel has been rumoured for the building, but, according to Liverpool City Council planning documents, the former pub will be converted into housing.\n\nStarr, 81, grew up on Madryn Street in the Dingle area, while his mother Elsie worked as a barmaid in the Empress pub on Admiral Grove.\n\nThe musician, who received a knighthood for his services to music in 2018, had celebrated the mural days before the finished project was completed.\n\n\"Verified As somebody said Ringo back in the Dingle,\" he wrote alongside a picture of the half-completed mural.\n\nRead more: Ringo Starr on his best drumming moments, the one that's 'not bad'\n\nThe drummer, real name Richard Starkey, found fame and fortune in the Fab Four alongside guitarist John Lennon, bassist Paul McCartney and songwriter, guitarist and sitarist George Harrison in the 60s.\n\nThe group are regarded as the most influential band of all time and were integral to popular music's recognition as an art form.\n\nThe music icon currently lives in Los Angeles with his wife of 20 years, Barbara Bach."
