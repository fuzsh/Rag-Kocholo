        "text": "AMNA NAWAZ: He was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice.\n\nHe's been knighted.\n\nHe's acted in many films and on TV, including as Mr.\n\nConductor right here on PBS.\n\nTo the world, he is simply Ringo.\n\nRingo Starr, former Beatles drummer, now 83 years old, has a new recording out this month and is on tour.\n\nJeffrey Brown joined him in Los Angeles for our arts and culture series, Canvas.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: He's youthful and fit, as recognizable as when the Beatles first took the world by storm nearly 60 years ago, performing with his own All-Starr Band, which he's led in various forms since 1989 and now releasing a new E.P.\n\ntitled \"Rewind Forward.\"\n\nFor Ringo Starr the music has always been there.\n\nRINGO STARR, Musician: That's what I do?\n\nThat's why I had a dream of 13 to be a drummer, and I hit that drum, and I knew immediately I wanted to be a drummer.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: What did you hear?\n\nI mean, what happened?\n\nRINGO STARR: I don't know.\n\nIt's like magic.\n\nOh, yes, I just love music.\n\nI love -- and I wanted to play.\n\nAnd there's not a lot of point being the drummer if you have no one else.\n\nWhat would you do, just me and the drums?\n\n(LAUGHTER) RINGO STARR: Yes, it doesn't work.\n\nYou need the others.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: The others would become John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison, together, The Beatles, the most, beloved important and influential band in rock 'n' roll history.\n\nBy his mid-20s, Ringo was world-famous, giving the Beatles a backbeat and a whole lot of personality.\n\nBut he started life as Richard Starkey, a sickly child in and out of hospitals, a poor kid trying to make his way in working-class Liverpool, England.\n\nWe talked about it recently at the Sunset Marquis, a famed Hollywood hotel, complete with its own NightBird recording studio in the basement.\n\nRINGO STARR: I was always working on the railways, on the boats, in the factory forever.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: What was that young boy's, your hopes and dreams at that time?\n\nAnd what could you imagine?\n\nRINGO STARR: Well, it all felt like it was something I was doing until I could do what I wanted to do, which was play.\n\nAnd the first band I was in was a factory band.\n\nWe used to play at the -- in the lunch hour to the men.\n\nAnd they'd all be telling us to leave, in not quite a nice way.\n\n(LAUGHTER) JEFFREY BROWN: He eventually joined Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, one of the top bands in Liverpool, then got to know another up-and-coming group with a different drummer at the time, The Beatles, up close when both bands were booked into the same Hamburg, Germany, club.\n\nRINGO STARR: It was 12 hours at the weekend between two bands, so you get to know your own band.\n\nBut we would try and top them.\n\nThey would try and top us.\n\nAnd the top wasn't very high then, but we were still - - we want the crowd, and they want the crowd.\n\nSo it was a great learning space.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: The Beatles asked Ringo to join them, and the rest, of course, is history.\n\nAnd what history, especially if you were on the inside.\n\nIn the hotel's photo gallery, Ringo noticed a 1964 shot of the group with Muhammad Ali, then still Cassius Clay.\n\nRINGO STARR: This was, like, early and first time in America.\n\nLike, when we flew over New York, I felt New York saying, come on down.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Yes.\n\nRINGO STARR: And we were finally in America, the land of all our music that we loved.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Because you had listened to American music, I know, as a kid.\n\nRINGO STARR: Yes.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd I come from a port where every other house had someone who was in the merchant navy.\n\nAnd they would bring records over.\n\nAnd so we heard a lot of sort of country and blues and stuff that England wasn't getting first.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Yes.\n\nAnd are the personalities coming out?\n\nRINGO STARR: Yes, I think so.\n\n(LAUGHTER) RINGO STARR: What?\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Is that you?\n\n(LAUGHTER) RINGO STARR: Yes.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: They would have nearly eight years together, countless hit songs, epic changing albums.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Fun-filled films.\n\nEveryone knew The Beatles, the music and the individuals.\n\nFor Ringo, who grew up an only child, it was as personal as could be.\n\nRINGO STARR: Got three brothers, and we were very close.\n\nAnd besides the touring, when -- we always shared a room.\n\nWe only ever got two rooms.\n\nIt was important, and I think part of our makeup, that we stayed together and closeness, and we really got to know each other and knew where we're coming from.\n\nAnd that certainly happened.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Ringo, behind his drum kit, sang several songs written by the others, including this one.\n\n(MUSIC) JEFFREY BROWN: And though far overshadowed by his songwriting partners, he did write a few himself.\n\nThat helped later in his post-Beatles career.\n\nRINGO STARR: The interesting thing that not a lot of people know is that, when I'd first present my songs, the rest of the band would be rolling on the floor laughing, because I'd really just rewritten some other song.\n\nIt wasn't my song at all.\n\nI just, like, reworded it.\n\nAnd they would say, yes, sure.\n\n(LAUGHTER) RINGO STARR: But that's how I started.\n\nI got out of that and started making my own moves.\n\nBut George was really helpful.\n\nHe produced the first couple of singles that I put out.\n\nAnd God bless him.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: The Beatles' end in 1970 is much discussed, much debated.\n\nPeter Jackson's 2021 documentary series \"The Beatles Get Back\" focused on a key final period.\n\nMost important to Ringo, who says he loved the film, capturing their closeness, as well as the tensions.\n\nRINGO STARR: Peter Jackson was going to do it.\n\nWe would hook up in L.A. several times.\n\nAnd we'd find parts.\n\nAnd I kept telling him, we were laughing.\n\nWe were brothers.\n\nWe had arguments.\n\nWe had fun.\n\nAnd we're playing with each other.\n\nAnd I have -- it's not all that dark.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: And you wanted that to come through.\n\nRINGO STARR: And I want it to come through, like it's a real band.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: After the breakup, each Beatle went solo.\n\nRingo, now his own front man, had a string of hits, including \"It Don't Come Easy.\"\n\nIn fact, he says it didn't.\n\nYou have also talked about some of the difficulties there, including struggles.\n\nRINGO STARR: Well, the first -- when it was first split up, I sat in the garden, wondering what to do.\n\nIt was like, that's it now.\n\nWhat -- you're so used to that job.\n\nAnd we worked a lot.\n\nBut then, suddenly, well, it's over.\n\nAnd it's really over.\n\nYes, I had a moment of, like, reflection.\n\nAnd I started to play with other artists.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: And that's what he's continued to do, along with a few other things, including acting.\n\nHe met his wife, Barbara Bach, while working together on the 1981 movie \"Caveman.\"\n\nRINGO STARR: This new train schedule is tommyrot, balderdash, and cuckoo.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: And he played Mr.\n\nConductor on the children's series \"Shining Time Station.\"\n\nHe marks his birthday every year with a peace and love celebration.\n\nThat, he says, is his one birthday wish.\n\nAnd, most of all, the music endures.\n\nRINGO STARR: Our audiences are bigger than they were and younger than they were.\n\nIt's really weird, far out.\n\nAnd we will see.\n\nThere's no guarantee, but we're doing it with our heart a blazing.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: And we started talking about that young boy back in Liverpool.\n\nRINGO STARR: It's far out, isn't it?\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: And here -- it is, but here you are.\n\nRINGO STARR: I live in L.A. You know how far out that is, you know?\n\nIt's weird.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: It's weird, but you're still going.\n\nRINGO STARR: I'm still going, yes.\n\n(LAUGHTER) JEFFREY BROWN: For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Jeffrey Brown in Los Angeles.\n\nAMNA NAWAZ: Peace and love, and the music endures."
