        "text": "On Sunday afternoon, in front of an invitation-only group of friends and musicians, the legendary Ringo Starr was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame. While the Nashville museum honors musicians of all genres, with the names of many notable recipients on the walls, there was something special in paying tribute to one of the Beatles, and the man Peter Frampton calls “one of the greatest drummers of all time.”\n\nBefore the ceremony, Ringo graciously agreed to briefly walk a small red carpet answering a few questions from the media. He touched on his love of country music, noted he has three new EPs in the works (Rewind Forward is set for release October 13th) and when asked if he has any advice for aspiring musicians he simply said, “Just keep playing. I have grandsons and I tell ‘em the same thing.”\n\nThe ceremony began with Linda Chambers, wife of the late Joe Chambers and founder of the Museum, presenting Ringo with the inaugural Joe Chambers Musicians Legacy Award.\n\n“For making music history for over six decades and for his philanthropy and humanitarian efforts,” she said, “we are honored to present this award to Sir Richard Starkey or, as he is known to the world, Ringo Starr\n\nThen, Brenda Lee, a member of both the Country Music and Rock & Roll Halls of Fame, got up and shared her memories of Ringo and the Beatles.\n\n“When I was young and in my rockin’ years, the Beatles opened for me at the Star Club in Hamburg. Everyone used to ask, ‘Who’s your favorite Beatle? Well, I loved them all, but to me, Ringo, you were adorable.”\n\nShe went on to applaud him for his talents as a songwriter for songs like “Photograph,” “It Don’t Come Easy,” “Oh My My” and others, then said, “The heartbeat of every rock and roll song you’ve ever heard is in the rhythm, so maybe I love Ringo most for his work as a musician.”\n\nHer remarks were followed by performances of some of his songs with singer Wendy Moten starting things off with “Photograph.” Before taking the stage, she admitted she was a little nervous.\n\n“Not only am I going to be around a true Beatle,” she said, “I’m going to be singing one of his greatest songs with him in front of me.”\n\nShe did a spectacular job and got a signal of approval from Ringo as he stood up afterward, clapped, and motioned to her.\n\nNext, Felix Cavalieri, founding member of The Rascals, sang “Act Naturally.”\n\nMaster guitarist Steve Lukathur, a member of Ringo’s All-Starr band for the past 11 years, got up next and performed “Matchbox.” Rodney Crowell and the Fisk Jubilee Singers wrapped up the music with their rendition of “With a Little Help from My Friends.\n\nRingo’s friend and fellow British rocker, Peter Frampton, officially welcomed the drummer into the Musicians Hall of Fame.\n\nFrampton said the Beatles “influenced all of us, changing music and seemingly, at the same time, changing the world.”\n\nHe continued, saying, “From the earliest Beatle recordings, Ringo was already orchestrating songs with his playing, not just playing along. It was different from the norm, his playing was, and is, incredibly unique.”\n\nFrampton recalled always being impressed with how much Ringo added to each song.\n\n“The record that changed everything for me was Sgt. Pepper,” he said. “I couldn’t wait for the next Beatle album to come out to hear more drum fills from Ringo.”\n\nIn the years since, Frampton has had the pleasure and privilege of working and performing with Ringo.\n\n“No one deserves to be inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame more than Ringo. Here’s the real Billy Shears.”\n\nAs Ringo made a few remarks and accepted his award, he noted his ties to Nashville date back to 1970 when he traveled to the city at the invitation of the late steel guitar guitarist and producer, Pete Drake.\n\n“I recorded Beacoups of Blues at a studio here in Nashville with Pete,” he recalled. “He flew to England to work on All Things Must Pass with George and I sent my car to pick him up. Pete noticed I had a lot of country cassettes in my car, and he said to me, ‘Why don’t you come to Nashville?’”\n\nRingo remembers telling Drake no, traveling to Nashville and recording an album would take too long.\n\n“Pete said Bob Dylan’s Nashville Skyline (recorded on Nashville’s Music Row) took just two days. And I said, I can do that. And we actually did record the album in two days.”\n\nThe Musicians Hall of Fame has a section honoring Pete Drake with a photo from his and Ringo’s recording session more than 50 years ago.\n\nPete’s widow, Rose Drake, has fond memories of Ringo’s first visit to Nashville. She said after arriving and before going into the studio, he wanted to go to Sears to buy toys to mail to his kids back home in England, and to visit the Ernest Tubb Record Shop.\n\nShe also has an interesting story about a shirt Ringo wore back then.\n\n“He came into the studio, and he had on this shirt and Pete said, ‘I really like that shirt.’ So, Ringo said, ‘You want it?’ And Pete said, ‘Well, yeah.’ So, Ringo took it off and they swapped shirts right there in the studio.”\n\nToday, that shirt has a special place inside the Musicians Hall of Fame.\n\nWhile Ringo is famous for his music, he’s also a talented artist. Prior to his induction, some of his artwork was on display and available for purchase with all proceeds going to his Lotus Foundation. The foundation offers financial assistance to family and child welfare, women’s issues, animal protection, and addiction recovery and education.\n\nAs the superstar accepted his award, he expressed his gratitude saying. “I’ve had a long and happy relationship with this town. And it’s really lovely to be here.”\n\nHe thanked the performers and musicians for the music, commenting on how great it sounded.\n\n“And with that, I send you all peace and love. Thanks for coming.”\n\nRingo then left to prepare for a show at the Ryman later in the evening. His love of both Nashville and country music continues. One of those new EPs he mentioned he has coming out in the not-too-distant future is a country EP."
