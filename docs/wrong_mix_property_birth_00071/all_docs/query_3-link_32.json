        "text": "Nashville's renown as a music industry town fueled by gifted creators getting by with a little help from their friends was never more present in the modern era than during Ringo Starr's Sunday induction into downtown Nashville's Musicians Hall of Fame.\n\nAt an event held at the downtown location of the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum, the Rock n' Roll Hall of Famer and Beatles member was not just inducted as the 170th member of the Musicians Hall of Fame but also received the inaugural Joe Chambers Musicians Legacy award.\n\nThe honor is named for Joe Chambers, the longtime Nashville entrepreneur, musician and songwriter, who passed away in Sept. 2022. Joe co-founded and opened the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum alongside his wife, Linda, in 2006.\n\n'a lad who loved music'\n\nStarr describes the emergence and sustaining power of his career this way to The Tennessean:\n\n\"I was a lad who loved to play music and began as a busker. With the constant love and support of so many, I created many far-out songs that have defined popular and youth culture for many generations.\"\n\nUpon receiving his induction medal and the Joe Chambers Musicians Legacy award, Starr stated the following to the crowd in attendance:\n\n\"I am honored to be here and accept the first Joe Chambers Musicians Legacy Award. I've always loved Nashville and country music, though I know this place honors all musicians regardless of genre or instrument. I've had a long, happy relationship with this town and it's lovely to be here and receive this award.\"\n\nMusicians Hall of Fame and Museum CEO Linda Chambers added, “It is an honor to induct the legendary Ringo Starr into the Musicians Hall of Fame this afternoon. It would have meant the world to Joe to have been here today, but in spirit, and through the Joe Chambers Musicians Legacy Award, we know he’s here with us. Ringo -- you have contributed immeasurably through your music and philanthropy on a global level, and we couldn’t be more proud to welcome you into our Hall of Fame family. Welcome, Ringo!”\n\nStarr, who also was in town for a Sunday evening performance at the Ryman Auditorium alongside his All-Star Band, was feted with three musical performances from an all-star band of the Musicians' Hall of Fame's own making that included Danny Rader (Music Director/Guitar), Mark Beckett (Drums), Jimmie Lee Sloas (Bass), Jerry McPherson (Electric Guitar), Blair Masters (Keyboard), and Sam Levine (Saxophone) and Cliff Downs on background vocals.\n\nGuests who performed with the septet included Rodney Crowell, Felix Cavaliere, Steve Lukather, Wendy Moten, and alums of the Fisk Jubilee Singers.\n\nCrowell and Moten led the players and the crowd in a stirring rendition of The Beatles' 1967 \"With a Little Help From My Friends.\"\n\nStarr's all-star skillset\n\nBefore the performance, event attendee and award presenter Peter Frampton highlighted that song as one that \"created a stir, exploded, and changed everything.\"\n\nThe performer and longtime Starr ally noted that he had referenced being a left-handed drummer playing a right-handed drum kit as key to a unique style symbolized by signature drum fills of less than ten sixteenth notes on songs, adding color and flavor to \"Hey Jude\" and \"Helter Skelter,\" among many.\n\nFrampton met Starr on the same day in 1970 as George Harrison as he was a 20-year-old session guitarist working with the duo on soul vocalist Doris Troy's self-titled Apple Records debut album.\n\nNotably, 1970 had also found Starr in Music City continuing a decade-long connection to country music hearkening back to The Beatles opening for Rock and Roll, Country Music, and Rockabilly Hall of Famer Brenda Lee at the Star Club in Hamburg, Germany, in 1962.\n\n\"Ringo was a part of The Beatles, who, in retrospect, were a mind-boggling group of musicians and songwriters whose ability to recreate the live power of authentic rock n' roll in the studio created a body of work that was a puzzlement to the status quo that people eventually figured out,\" stated the \"I'm Sorry\" vocalist.\n\nStarr's interest in country music led him to work with Country Music Hall of Famer, pedal steel guitar player and bandleader Pete Drake on the 1970-released top-40 country album \"Beaucoup of Blues,\" plus pair with Buck Owens on 1989's cover of both Owens and The Beatles' takes on \"Act Naturally.\"\n\nThe latter was nominated for the 1989 Country Music Association Vocal Event of the Year and a 1990 Best Country Vocal Collaboration Grammy."
