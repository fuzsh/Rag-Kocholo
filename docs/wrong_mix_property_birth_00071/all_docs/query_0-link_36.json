        "text": "Over 1,500 Liverpool residents have complained about Ringo Starr’s recent comments about the city.\n\nAccording to the Daily Star, the residents complained via council phone lines and websites after Starr made comments about the city on the Jonathan Ross show.\n\nOn the show, aired last Friday (January 18), Starr said he didn’t miss anything about Liverpool since he left, and joked that he was “this close to coming back”, holding his finger and thumb close together.\n\nLiverpool resident Gemma Dunn was quoted in the paper as saying: “He was just self-indulgent and arrogant.”\n\nAdvertisement"
