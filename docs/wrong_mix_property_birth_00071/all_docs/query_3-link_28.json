        "text": "Sir Richard Starkey MBE (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter, actor and filmmaker who achieved international fame as the drummer for the Beatles. Starr occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \"Yellow Submarine\", \"With a Little Help from My Friends\", \"It Don't Come Easy\", \"It's A Sunshine Life\" and \"Goodnight Vienna\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles songs \"Don't Pass Me By\", \"Octopus's Garden\", \"Back Off, Boogaloo\" and \"Wrack My Brain\".\n\nStarr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, with periods of prolonged hospitalisation. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship as a machinist at a Liverpool school equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, Starr became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll around early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes when he was asked to join the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best.\n\nIn addition to the Beatles' films, Starr has acted in numerous others. Starr has featured in numerous documentaries, hosted television shows, narrated the first two series of the children's television program Thomas The Tank Engine & Friends and portrayed \"Mr. Conductor\" during the first season of the PBS children's television series Shining Time Station."
