        "text": "Ringo and Paul: “Hey Jude”, Hollywood Bowl 1993\n\nToday it was announced that both Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr are to perform at this year’s Grammy Awards on the 26th of January from the Staples Center, Los Angeles. It remains to see if they’ll elect to perform together. If they do, it will only be the fifth time they will perform together since the Beatles. The two are also accepting “The 2014 Lifetime Achievement Award” on behalf of The Beatles.\n\nPrevious Ringo-Paul performances: Paul’s concert at the Hollywood Bowl, Los Angeles in 1993, Ringo joined Paul for “Hey Jude”, the next time was at the “Concert For George” in Royal Albert Hall in London in 2002, the “Change Begins Within”-concert in New York’s Radio City Music Hall in 2009, and finally Paul’s surprise appearance on Ringo’s 70th birthday at the same venue, performing “Birthday” in 2010.\n\nUnder this you’ll find Paul accepting a Grammy award for “Let It Be” on behalf of The Beatles in 1971 for “Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture”. The Beatles have been nominated for 25 Grammies, winning nine, the first was for “Best New Artist” in 1964. Alone or together with Wings, Paul has also won nine Grammies. This time he is nominated in four categories, “Best Rock Song” (together with Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic and Pat Smear for “Cut Me Some Slack”), “Best Boxed Or Special Limited Editon Package” for “Wings Over America”, “Best Surround Sound album” and “Best Music Film”, both for “Live Kisses”. “New” has not received any nominations, due to having been released too late in the year.\n\nRingo’s Grammy page"
