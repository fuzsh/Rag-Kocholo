        "text": "“I went to see John, who had been living in my apartment in Montagu Square with Yoko since he moved out of Kenwood.\n\n\"I said, ‘I’m leaving the group because I’m not playing well and I feel unloved and out of it, and you three are really close.’”\n\nHe did admit both Sir Paul and John felt similarly to him, but ultimately this was not the reason why Sir Ringo did not write as many songs for the band.\n\nSir Paul told Mark Lewisohn for The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions: “Some of [Ringo’s songs] we just couldn’t get behind!”\n\n“He used to do ‘Boys’ and ‘Matchbox’ with us, and with [Ringo’s earlier band] Rory Storm he used to do a set.\n\n“But generally we never thought of those songs as being that good...\n\n“John rarely showed his tender side, but my key memories of John are when he was tender, that’s what has remained with me— those moments where he showed himself to be a very generous, loving person.\n\n“I always cite that song as an example of the John beneath the surface that we only saw occasionally… I don’t think John’s version was ever recorded.”\n\nLast year, speaking to Dave Grohl, Sir Ringo said John also wrote a different song for him in 1980, which made the drummer ‘well up’ when he thought of it.\n\nHe said: “The interesting thing is this guy Jack Douglas, the producer, brought this track of John’s to me [Grow Old With Me] just this year; I’d never heard it.\n\n“So he’s still in my life. And so it’s on the new album.\n\n“But why he gave me this CD is [because] at the beginning, John says, ‘Oh, that would be great for Richard Starkey.’"
