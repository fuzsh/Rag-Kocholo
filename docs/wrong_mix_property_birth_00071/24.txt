FORMER Beatle Ringo Starr picked up the icon award at music magazine Mojo’s annual awards last night.

The ceremony took place at the Brewery in east London. Ringo told the crowd: "There is not a lot I can say. I’m still doing what I love to do and I’ve just finished a tour. Just got back from Vienna where I could use the line, finally I could say that phrase Goodnight Vienna."

‌

Editor-in-chief Phil Alexander said: "Ringo was the backbeat of one of the greatest bands of all-time.

"Teddy boy, mop top, all-star guy. There is and only ever will be one Ringo Starr."

Beach Boy Brian Wilson quoted one of his own songs to thank his fans as he was honoured at a top music awards.

The star, responsible for hits including California Girls and Good Vibrations, was inducted into Mojo magazine’s Hall of Fame.

Former Crowded House frontman Neil Finn introduced Wilson and told the audience he could "summon up the sound of pure joy" in his music.

The former Beach Boy was greeted by a standing ovation by the crowd.

He said: "I’d like to thank England for being so supportive of me throughout my career. God only knows where I’d be without you."

The band, fronted by former Sex Pistol John Lydon, picked up the award for Outstanding Contribution To Music.

Accepting his award, Lydon criticised record companies who he said had left him "bankrupt".

He said: "Listen, Public Image has been the most difficult thing I’ve ever had to do in my entire life as it’s about my entire life."

‌

The singer said the band stood in "direct opposition to this record industry".

He said: "The point is the record companies have kept me bankrupt for 18 years."

He ended his speech by telling the audience: "England, do not give up. England, we are the best country in the world in music."
