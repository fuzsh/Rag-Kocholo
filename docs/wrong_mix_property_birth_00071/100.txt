Other winners included John Bishop and chef Tom Kerridge who is appearing at the Liverpool Food and Drink Festival

Ringo Starr has won an award for his humanitarian work.

The former Beatle attended the GQ Men of the Year Awards where he was given the award for his work with the David Lynch Foundation.

‌

The foundation helps abused children and veterans with post-traumatic stress, through transcendental meditation - a practice Ringo first studied when he was in The Beatles, with the Maharishi in 1968.

Ringo is the face of designer John Varvatos’s Autumn/Winter 2014 campaign, with his profits feeding back into the David Lynch Foundation.

Ringo arrived at the ceremony at London’s Royal Opera House with wife Barbara Bach and the couple posed for photographs on the red carpet before joining guests inside.

Pippa Middleton, Johnny Depp and celebrity couple Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were also in attendance at the star-studded bash.

Also successful on the night, was Liverpool’s John Bishop who picked up Comedian of the Year and said: “I feel like I should thank my wife, even though we've been arguing for three f****** days.”

Tom Kerridge won the Chef of the Year award ahead of his appearance at the Liverpool Food and Drink Festival this month. Tom is the only chef to receive two Michelin stars for pub grub.

He said: “It's a triumph for a fat middle aged bloke to be stood on the stage at the GQ awards."
