        "text": "Moving beyond growth at all costs. For decades the belief that the purpose of government is to grow the economy as quickly as possible as measured through gross domestic product (GDP) has been dominant. Growth has been the answer to any question – either we need more of it to trickle down or we need more of it to be able to afford to help people out or care for the natural world. In New Zealand it used to be called ‘rip, shit and bust ‘ and chasing GDP growth hasn’t translated to shared prosperity, in fact it has led to greater inequality, poverty, environmental damage and poorer physical and mental health. Around the world, many governments and citizens are now recognising that this old narrow focus is not working and we need a new economic operating system. I’m inspired by the new economic thinking and experimentation happening around the world today and especially Māori leadership in Aotearoa. I believe we need a Wellbeing Economy approach that puts the economy in service to human and planetary needs not the other way around. Please join me in a film screening of Outgrow the System to explore what comes after our unjust, unsustainable economic system. We are going to have a Q&A session with the Swedish producers and have a fantastic panel to localise these big ideas in Tāmaki Makaurau. Join the Wellbeing Economy Alliance Aotearoa NZ Economy Alliance Aotearoa and Degrowth Aotearoa for an Outgrow the System Movie night (popcorn included), an after movie discussion panel and live Q&A with the producers in Sweden Where: Senior Citizens Hall, Mt Albert for When: Thursday 11th April 6-8pm, doors open at 5:30.

Goebbels was in favour of freedom of speech for views he liked. So was Stalin. If you're in favour of freedom of speech, that means you're in favour of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise.” And right now, it feels like we are living in another era marked by the tyranny of the majority 🗯️🗯️🗯️ 🚫🚫🚫 With social media platforms happy to ban content they don’t like, our fundamental rights to free speech are being eroded on a seemingly daily basis, as YouTube continues to deplatform documentary makers, interview-based shows and anything else that contradicts the approved status quo. In 2020, London Real was faced with the ultimate censorship battle: as Silicon Valley behemoths, governments and regulators took it in turn to attack the channel, we determined that we would continue to broadcast content we believed was authentic, important, and often, marginalised 💥💥💥 💯 Our new award-winning documentary, “We Will Not Be Silenced” tells this often shocking, always unflinching tale of David vs. Goliath, chronicling how Big Tech tried (and failed) to force us to stop broadcasting and how we fought back against these new, self-appointed censors 💯 🚀 Now viewed over 3 million times, “We Will Not Be Silenced” has already become must-watch content for anyone concerned about their rights, freedom of speech and the Machiavellian actions of the tech giants 👀 ➡️ ➡️➡️ Available exclusively via London Real’s 𝕏 channel at: londonreal.tv/x #LondonReal #WeWillNotBeSilenced #StopCensorship #OnlineFreeSpeech #BanYouTube #DontBeEvil #BeMoreElon\n\nThe Industry Gets a Makeover — plain English — Inspired by Argentina’s latest tango with the free market, here are some hard-boiled, transformative measures for the entertainment world: 1. Public Access: - Let the suits grip the wheel a bit tighter control slides over to production entities, making middlemen about as useful as a bottle of rum at a sobriety rally. - Cut the fluff. Fewer intermediaries means purer content, dripping with that raw, uncut artistic integrity. 2. Agency Lockdown: - Time to knock off the fat cats in their plush offices. Artist agencies get the axe, making room for creators to deal directly with producers and their audiences. It’s a world where creative autonomy doesn’t come with a side of bureaucracy. 3. Labor Reform: - Contracts get cleaned up. Fairer deals, equitable rights, and no more shafting the little guy. Even the freelancers get a slice of the pie. Fair compensation is the name of the game. 4. Investment Perks: - Roll out the red carpet for the big bucks. Digital content, interactive media, cultural exports—they all get a nod. The global money bags are welcomed with open arms, but local talent gets its due. Diverse artistic voices will echo louder than a funk band on New Year’s Eve. 5. AI Integration: - Artificial intelligence struts onto the scene, shaking up the landscape. AI-driven content, personalized viewer experiences, and production efficiencies—it’s the future, wrapped in ones and zeros, jazzed up for the silver screen. 6. Financial Makeover: - The books get a scrub. Transparent financial structures promote compliance and trust. Reinvestments into creative projects ensure everyone gets a fair cut, from the screenwriter in the smoky back room to the director yelling “Action!” These changes aim to turn the industry on its head, injecting creativity, innovation, and sustainability while smashing down barriers and opening doors for every creative soul in the game. The creative world, which will now include heretofore excluded minorities behind the camera in decision-making roles, gets a serious boost. #caa #wga #ucla #hollywood Migdia S. Skarsgård Chinea. Ciboney Productions.\n\nThis article made the rounds near me more than a month ago, but is obviously still pertinent, and will become more so as time passes on. Not least because (social) media companies work as intended. What follows is the link and my short sendoff to it. https://lnkd.in/dJEtyHzd My three main interests - philosophy or academia more broadly, music, and martial arts - are all in some way subject to this, at least as long I assume they require an audience. And in some way they all do, no matter how much I repeat mantras of doing these things for their own sake. None of us is a monadic being. There are some traces of elitism in lamenting \"culture\", especially in ways where \"culture\" is equated with \"art\", and \"art\" in turn juxtaposed with \"entertainment\". Entertainment can be pretty entertaining, after all! Nevertheless I find juxtapositions of \"art\" against \"product of the culture industry\" (alla Adorno, Horkheimer, or Marcuse) or even juxtapositions of something \"authentic\" against something \"inauthentic\" (alla Heidegger, or unspeakable French thinkers) captivating. Especially in light of recent phenomena of audiovisual and gaming culture - short-form content, sometimes either aided or generated by AI tools in the case of the former, repetitive Skinner box slop in the case of the latter. Cards on the table: most of the audiovisual content that I consume is on some form of social media, and I get around to watching maybe two films every year, so take that part of my thoughts here in context. When it comes to manufactured dopamine hits turned anhedonia machines, though, I think a moralistic stance is justified. Why do something that one does not remember one was doing, that is hardly something one could say holds meaning? (And, of course, the ethical question par excellence: why do anything?) An analysis that begins and ends at \"PHONE BAD\" requires a completely smooth and rock-hard brain. The medium is not truly the message, and the medium is not ontologically evil - or ontologically anything. More optimistically inclined people might say there will be emergent cultural movements within what is going on in all the media seeping into our fields of perception from everywhere. It is not entirely unfounded to be optimistic either, and I hope that inclination is not misguided. Making music probably cannot provide any kind of answer to problems something like this evokes. Neither can martial arts - though if you know where martial skill should be aimed to wipe away a problem like this, maybe point me in the right direction (in Roblox, as is the custom to say today). Philosophy, to some extent, is an appropriate tool to grapple with these problems. Politics is the hammer-like tool, though at the moment trust in politics is scarce. To put this in words of a professional philosopher: the emptiness of empty transcendence is nearing in its presencing as manufactured anhedonia acts as harbinger of manufactured nihilism.\n\nTV Tokyo's narrative-themed economic program \"Future Script: The Power of 'Stories' to Change the World\". I will appear in the studio as a commentator. It is Saturday evening on April 20th, so please come and watch the show! Program Outline The idea of \"Narrative\" is to grow together with everyone. The program focuses on the narratives of Japanese companies, and focuses on \"stories that make the most of one's own personality. Don't miss the self-filming videos of each guest. Program Content Narrative\" refers to the process of creating a story with all stakeholders, including brands, consumers, employees, business partners, and shareholders, by regarding them as colleagues. In this third installment, we closely follow the narrative activities of NTT Data, SBS Holdings, and Matsunaga Corporation to unravel the forefront of this process. In addition, narrative VTRs and photos taken by each guest will be shown. Together with the studio talk, we will also consider \"how individuals can weave narratives\" that are necessary in the coming era.

But look at us in the West. We don't censor much anymore we just dispute everything. It's summed up by that Trump era phrase 'alternative facts'. Before China can really move on the Cultural Revolution and more importantly Mao must be subject to scrutiny. The sooner the better to forestall history repeating itself. The aliens may well be getting closer! \"There’s a cottage industry of making videos on Chinese social media about “The Three Body Problem.” But few dare to address what led the daughter, a physicist, to invite the aliens to invade the Earth. A video with more than five million views on the website Baidu referred to the Cultural Revolution as “the red period” without explaining what happened. Another video with more than eight million views on the video site Bilibili called it “the what you know event.” It's not surprising that fans of the book may have heard of the Cultural Revolution, but they don’t have a concrete idea about the atrocities that the Communist Party and some ordinary Chinese committed. That’s why the reactions to the Netflix series are concerning to some Chinese. A human rights lawyer posted on WeChat that because of his age, he saw some struggle sessions when he was a child. “If I lived a bit longer, I might even get to experience it firsthand,” he wrote. “It’s not called reincarnation. It’s called history.”\" What Chinese Outrage Over ‘3 Body Problem’ Says About China https://lnkd.in/gw6Qz2dc (Subscription may be required) #china #culturalrevolution #censorship"
