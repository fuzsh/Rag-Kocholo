        "text": "Yahoo announced a partnership with BT Group to jointly promote a high-speed Internet access product, the U.S. Internet firm's first foray into Europe's highly competitive broadband market.\n\nThe new service, called Yahoo UK Plus, will give BT broadband customers multiple e-mail accounts, digital photo storage, antivirus software and firewall security.\n\nThe service will launch later this quarter, at which time the fee for the service will be announced, the companies said. BT currently charges about $45 a month for its basic consumer broadband; the Yahoo (YHOO) service would likely be priced at a premium.\n\nThe alliance will be expanded in the future to include additional broadband access services and price plans, they said. Both companies will pitch in on a multimillion-pound marketing campaign to promote the service.\n\n- - -\n\nDell pulls back: Dell has ended a $16 billion purchasing contract with IBM and greatly pared back a $6 billion services partnership with the technology heavyweight.\n\nDell spokesman Bruce Anderson said that the relationship with IBM ended in January, in part because several of the businesses Dell was working with at IBM had been sold off.\n\nDell (DELL) had purchased hard disk drives, flat panel displays and various chips from IBM since 1999, Anderson said. Last December IBM (IBM) sold its hard disk drive business to Hitachi (HIT) for $2.05 billion.\n\nAlso, Dell will no longer work with IBM's consulting unit, Global Services, unless customers request its services. Anderson would not comment on why Dell is limiting the relationship.\n\n- - -\n\nEducation domain expands: Beauty, theological and distance-learning schools will be among the educational institutions that will soon share online real estate with the likes of Princeton and Harvard.\n\nThe Commerce Department approved expansion of the \".edu\" domain name to allow usage by schools such as the Connecticut Institute of Hair Design and the American Film Institute.\n\nCritics complain the expansion will cheapen the Internet neighborhood for its present occupants -- generally four-year institutions and community colleges.\n\n- - -\n\nAnother big contract: IBM agreed to take over most of the computer operations of auto-parts maker Visteon, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe outsourcing deal is likely to be valued at more than $2 billion over 10 years, the companies told the newspaper.\n\nUnder the deal, IBM (IBM) will take over operations including data centers and help desks, the article said. An unspecified number of Visteon (VC) employees will move to IBM, but no layoffs are planned, executives told the Journal.\n\n- - -\n\nNokia cuts 550: Nokia, the world's biggest cell-phone maker, said it will cut 550 jobs in its networks operations in the United States, Britain, Sweden and Finland.\n\nThe cuts represent 3 percent of its networks business work force and are part of the company's plans to reduce its research and development as it tries to cut costs and improve efficiency.\n\nNokia (NOK) said it will transfer some operations from its site in Santa Rosa, California, to Espoo, its Finnish headquarters near Helsinki, but will eventually close the California location.\n\n- - -\n\nSoftware education deal: NIIT, India's leading software education company, said it had acquired U.S.-based corporate training firm CognitiveArts to tap a lucrative market in teaching employees of global giants.\n\nCompany officials declined to divulge financial details of the purchase, but said it will gain access to the U.S. firm's top clients, which include the world's biggest retailer Wal-Mart (WMT), Exxon (XOM) and consultants McKinsey.\n\nAP and Reuters contributed to this report.\n\nBeyond Meat Is Stalling in the US. Europe Could Be Another Story\n\nThe once-hyped company is now the most prominent victim of a broader downturn in the plant-based meat industry.\n\nTiny Texas Village Seeks Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Miner to Pave Potholes, Scare Dogs Away\n\nIn a roundabout bid to win public opinion (and a juicy tax abatement,) Riot Platforms is preparing for its prized bitcoin mine to be annexed by a minuscule village in rural Texas.\n\nThe Architect of Russia’s Google Is Back\n\nYandex cofounder Arkady Volozh fought off sanctions and kicked anti-war squatters out of his Amsterdam townhouse. Now he is ready to reveal his new AI company in the Netherlands. But can Europe forget his past?\n\nHow IT Departments Scrambled to Address the CrowdStrike Chaos\n\nSystem administrators and their teams sprang into action last Friday and worked tirelessly to get their companies back online amid one of the worst digital blackouts ever.\n\nWe Asked AI to Take Us On a Tour of Our Cities. It Was Chaos\n\nWe had a specialty chatbot to curate perfect days out in London and New York for under $100 each. We're still recovering from our journeys.\n\nBitcoin Bros Go Wild for Donald Trump\n\nAt Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Trump is finally telling crypto enthusiasts what they want to hear.\n\nCraig Wright Faces Perjury Investigation Over Claims He Created Bitcoin\n\nBy order of a UK judge, Craig Wright can no longer claim he is the creator of bitcoin and now faces the prospect of criminal charges.\n\nOpen Source AI Has Founders—and the FTC—Buzzing\n\nDC went to YC to talk OS."
