        "text": "TRANSCRIPT\n\nShe really is a film pioneer.\n\nHer legacy is that the most powerful filmmaker in Hollywood was a woman.\n\n1908, Flushing, New York.\n\n29-year-old Lois Weber was hired at Gaumont Studios to act in short films.\n\nGaumont was one of the premier French motion picture companies, and they started a branch in the U.S., American Gaumont, run by Herbert Blach and Alice Guy Blach . Under their mentorship, Weber soon expanded from acting to writing and directing her own films.\n\nThe very first films are incredibly brief- thirty seconds long, usually taken with a static camera. There is no sound.\n\nBut very quickly, it becomes understood as a vehicle for stories, as an entertainment medium.\n\n'I grew up in a business when everybody was so busy learning a new industry, that no one had time to notice whether or not a woman was gaining a foothold.'\n\nLois Weber was born in 1879 near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to a middle-class Christian family of German descent.\n\nWeber had a very devout upbringing. She worked with the Church Army, ministering to prostitutes and prisoners and people living in poverty.\n\nShe carried that mission of social justice with her into the film industry.\n\nAfter touring the U.S. as a singer and concert pianist, Weber joined the theater in New York in 1904.\n\nWhile Weber is acting on stage, she meets Phillips Smalley, a fellow actor and stage manager, and the two of them are married and work together.\n\nWeber and Smalley were part of that redefining relationships between men and women, a new idea about 'companionate marriage,' where marriage is about equality and companionship.\n\n'My husband gave me every encouragement and we worked in perfect harmony.\n\nI was fortunate in being associated with broad-minded men.'\n\nBy 1911, Weber and Smally became a leading filmmaking team with Weber as the driving force behind their productions.\n\nThey wrote and acted and co-directed a ten-minute film every single week.\n\nIt's astonishing.\n\nThe fact that Lois made a film a week makes my spine shake, knowing what it takes to make a film, even a short film.\n\nWhat a fierce visionary.\n\nMy name is Radha Blank and I am a film director.\n\nI tried to be an actor, and when I wasn't getting cast in anything, I just decided to write my own one woman show. I was a playwright for 20 years.\n\nI started writing for 'The Get Down' and then 'Empire' and 'She's Gotta Have It.' I just directed my first feature film called 'The 40-Year-Old Version,' of which I am the writer, director, producer and star.\n\nAnd we premiered it at Sundance, where they were crazy enough to give me the best directing award.\n\nAnd we made a little bit of black history because I am only the second black woman to win that award.\n\nPeople have been conditioned to see filmmakers in one light and a lot of times it doesn't include someone who looks like me.\n\nIt's important that we support each other in these endeavors because we know, given the chance, how seriously we take it.\n\nIn 1912, Weber and Smalley moved to Los Angeles, California to work for the new Universal Films studio.\n\nEarly films were not made in studios, they were made outdoors.\n\nAnd so they needed good weather.\n\nSo the film industry begins to center in and around Los Angeles.\n\nAnd movie theaters in the early days were showing short 10 or 20-minute films, multiple times a day.\n\nSo they needed a lot of films to keep their audiences coming back.\n\nIn 1913, Weber was elected as the first mayor of Universal City.\n\nShe ran on an all-female ticket, shortly after women's suffrage was granted in California.\n\nWomen did not have the vote nationally, and this campaign was mocked in the press. Universal, to its credit, embraced female leadership and said, 'we have both beauty and brains.'\n\nWeber's 1914 adaptation of Shakespeare's 'The Merchant of Venice' made her the first American woman to direct a feature length film.\n\nWeber worked on every stage of her films.\n\nShe wrote the scripts, she acted in her productions, she directed, and she usually sat in the editing room.\n\nA director who is in total control.\n\n'I cannot be happy to direct someone else's story.\n\nThat would be only half a creation.'\n\nHer films are full of really extraordinary compositions, sometimes using mirrors in the frame, multiple planes of action, moving cameras, split screen.\n\nIn the 1910s, Weber's films tackled controversial social issues of her day.\n\nMany were huge box office hits. Others were censored and banned.\n\nShe made two films about the campaign to legalize birth control.\n\nShe made a film about capital punishment and police violence, drug addiction.\n\nShe made a film about poverty and women's wage equity . She compared her films to sermons and to a newspaper editorial, to spread her message of social justice on a very mass scale.\n\nVirtually all of Weber's films feature female protagonists who take risks, who are the agents of social change.\n\n'I think the young women of this country today want to be individuals and to have freedom of thought and action.\n\nThat is the kind of girl I am going to show in my story.'\n\nShe's also a very important mentor to and advocate for other women.\n\nAlmost all of her other collaborators, apart from her husband, are women.\n\nIn my first writing room, I was one of two women, so I couldn't just be a writer pitching ideas.\n\nI had to be the black writer or the female writer.\n\nTo make the industry more representative, we have to have more people representative of our world in positions of power, from studio heads to development executives, to It starts with the leadership. If they are more inclusive and diverse, then more inclusive and diverse stories will get greenlit. I guarantee you.\n\nA story that is forgotten today is that there were many women active in the early film industry.\n\nThe top screenwriters in the silent era were women.\n\nCan you imagine a world in which the top screenwriters are women?\n\nWeber became one of the first women to run her own movie studio when she founded Lois Weber Productions in 1917. She was also the first woman director admitted to both the Directors Guild and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nShe negotiates very lucrative distribution deals, first with Universal and then with Paramount, that make her the highest paid director in the industry.\n\n'I have been fortunate in having my own little place in film land with few other directors even attempting to give the public my kind of story.'\n\nBut the opportunities that women had in the early years of filmmaking close off in the 1920s.\n\nThe film industry really embraces glamour and commodification of female bodies and female celebrities.\n\nAnd so Weber's kind of filmmaking is out of step with the time.\n\nWeber created a film for Paramount in 1921 titled 'What Do Men Want?'\n\nIt's about what we would now call toxic masculinity and about the connections between capitalism and the drive for profit.\n\nParamount refused to distribute the film.\n\n'They said to me, 'It shows that a woman made this.' And I said to them, 'Yes, and it also shows that men are afraid to see themselves as they really are.' It is too bitter a pill.'\n\nThat's the beginning of the end of her production company.\n\nLois Weber Productions shut down in 1921.\n\nWeber divorced her husband and retired from public life for two years.\n\nLarger changes were afoot in the film industry.\n\nFilm becomes very profitable very fast, and a few studios start to take control of the industry.\n\nThey buy up the theater chains and control the market and that shuts out women.\n\n'I am hampered with too many conditions. The producers select the stories, select the cast, tell you how much you can pay for a picture and how in. When they tell you that they also will cut your picture. That is too much.'\n\nIn 1927, Weber directed her last silent film, 'The Angel of Broadway.' Following the advent of sound technology, she directed her only talking picture, the interracial romance 'White Heat.' Released in 1934, it performed badly at the box office.\n\nThat last decade of her life, she becomes involved in the visual education movement to use films in schools and teaching.\n\n'Ideas can be absorbed with more facility from motion picture screens than from books or lectures. My job now is to supplant the blackboard with the screen.'\n\nWeber died in 1939 at the age of 60.\n\nShe was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.\n\nOf the nearly 200 films Lois Weber wrote and directed in her 30 year career, only a fraction remain.\n\nOnly 4% of Hollywood films were directed by women in the past decade.\n\nThat's not an acceptable number.\n\nClearly, there still is a fight on our hands, but the difference now is that the army of soldiers, 'cinema sisters,' as I call them, has grown exponentially to keep pushing things forward.\n\n'I must continue to pioneer. So many women have done that in times gone by.'"
