Capersâ father had served time on a chain gang for a crime he did not commit and eventually fled to Baltimore with his family. The city was the backdrop for two lifechanging moments, first meeting the love of his life and future wife Dottie and enlisting in the Marines out of high school. This would be the start of a legendary career that broke barriers as one of the greatest U.S. Marines in history.\n\nDuring his service he would be selected to join the elite Force Recon Marine unit where he excelled, breaking training records, participating in 64 long range reconnaissance patrols and five major campaigns in Vietnam. He was a natural leader and father figure to Team Broadminded, a specialized group of Force Recon Marines. Capers and Team Broadminded were routinely selected to go on the most dangerous and clandestine missions in Vietnam.\n\nMissions included a POW rescue ordered by President Johnson, amphibious assaults in the DMZ, recovery of a B-57 rumored to have a nuclear bomb, and search and destroy patrols in Phu Loc.\n\nA soft-spoken man, his commendations offer an inspiring view of his heroism and self-sacrifice.

With full integration completed only in 1960, Capersâ image became the Marine Corps most popular recruitment"
