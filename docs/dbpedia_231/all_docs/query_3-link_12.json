        "text": "Cultural diplomacy designates the use of cultural ‘soft power’ – rather than military or economic means – to influence or coerce. Historically, cultural diplomacy has been exercised not only by governments to advance foreign policy goals, but also through a range of unofficial activities within different cultural sectors. As Benjamin Martin and Elisabeth Piller observe, the politically and economically unstable interwar period saw a surge in cultural diplomacy efforts with the establishment of governmental cultural departments, cultural festivals and sponsored cultural exchange: ‘Through such efforts, states mobilised broad swaths of civil society in new ways, engaging artists, architects, scholars, religious leaders, advertising executives and schoolchildren in projecting the nation’s culture abroad.’ In this sense, Martin and Piller argue, the interwar period can be described as ‘a laboratory for the testing of new “cultural” tools in international politics.’ Media historian Nicholas J. Cull tracks the origins of what he phrases ‘cinematic diplomacy’ to Hollywood during World War I. Since then, Cull observes, film has been used diplomatically chiefly in three ways: first, as a prestige object and as a cultural ambassador on behalf of one’s own country; secondly, as a negative with complaints toward other film industries with regard to misrepresentations or increasing foreign influence in one’s own industry; or, thirdly, as a ‘chess pawn’ where films have been withdrawn from film festivals due to political and strategic considerations. While previous research on film as a cultural diplomacy tool has focused mainly on the film festival circuit, less attention has been placed on the role of film societies in such cultural exchange.\n\nThis article investigates the role of cultural diplomacy within the Swedish film society movement. First originating in France during the 1920s, the film society movement began to flourish in Sweden during the 1930s with increasing domestic exchange, and soon thereafter international connections started to become more central. This study centres on Lund Film Society’s travels abroad during the 1930s: to Nazi-Germany in 1935 and in 1938 respectively, as well as to the Soviet Union in 1936. Through international exchange, Lund Film Society did not only get access to artistic and politically radical films but also an increased insight into the international film industry. In the historiography of the film society, those trips appear almost mythical. On the one hand, they have been highlighted as examples of the film society’s thrift and sense of adventure. As Gösta Werner, the society’s long-time chairman and later a famous filmmaker and film historian, writes: ‘The air above Lund was high. Our contacts reached out over Öresund and into Europe, rather than just to Stockholm and Uppsala.’ On the other hand, persistent rumours have flourished regarding the film society’s ‘Pro-German’ attitude during the interwar period, with Werner cast as the role of the main target of these accusations. This raises questions about how Lund Film Society, both in its daily operation and in connection to the journeys, conceptualised their relation to the contemporary film culture in Germany and in the Soviet Union.\n\nThe study centres on the following research questions: How did the participants from Lund Film Society present their encounter with the history, culture, and dominating ideologies of these counties? The focal point of the present study is the travelogues that the participants published both in daily newspapers (Sydsvenska Dagbladet, Lunds Dagblad and Arbetet), and in specialist trade journals published nationally (Biografbladet and Biografägaren). Another purpose in studying the connections with Nazi-Germany and the Soviet Union is hence to understand how the international relations functioned for the film society. Under the headline ‘Film and politics in 1930s Lund’ I will analyse, in chronological order, the film society’s three trips during the interwar period. Finally, I discuss the importance of international exchange for the Swedish film society environment during the interwar period.\n\nFilm and politics in 1930s Lund\n\nDuring the autumn of 1929, a group of cinephile students wrote a declaration in the social democratic newspaper Arbetet that Lund Film Society had been formed, while encouraging other film enthusiasts to join them: ‘In academic circles, the interest in film is extraordinary and naturally of a theoretical kind.’ Film and theatre critic Stig Almqvist and the then student and later experimental filmmaker Gösta Werner were among the founders, who were inspired by the rise of so-called cinéclubs and film societies in Paris, Berlin and Amsterdam. In Sweden, film societies also formed in Stockholm, Uppsala and Gothenburg during the late 1920s and early 1930s. The film program for Lund Film Society during its inaugural season shows that international art cinema from France, Germany, the Soviet Union and Italy dominated the program, with the supply of films being highly dependent on the good-will of film producers and distributors (who lent films to the society) as well as other organisations (such as the workers’ movement or diplomatic legations). David Bordwell argues that the teleological history of the development of film narratives and style – what he describes as ‘the Basic Story’ – was promoted by the film culture during the 1920s and 1930s in film magazines, film societies and emerging film archives. In 1936, Lund Film Society boasted 350 members, making it one of the most popular student associations in the university city.\n\nMeanwhile, the 1930s was a transforming time politically that made an impression on the cultural climate in Lund. Not least the rise of Nazism in Germany and, later, the National Socialist German Workers Party’s takeover of power was noticed in the student city. In the book Lund University during the Second World War: Contradictions, Debate and Relief Efforts (1996), historian Sverker Oredsson investigates the public opinion within Lund University and in particular how people regarded Nazism and the national socialists’ ideology. The political associations during the interwar period were many, and Oredsson shows that most, with few exceptions, could be placed ideologically either on the radical left or the far right of the political landscape.\n\nTo the left side of the political spectrum were, among others, D.Y.G (The Younger Old Man) and Clarté. Whereas the social liberal association D.Y.G. at the end of the 1920s and the start of the 1930s was an active force in the Lundian political flora, during the 1930s it was increasingly pushed out by the more radical Clarté, which was the most active leftist organisation at the time. To the right of the political spectrum, activity increased noticeably among existing associations during the 1930s and new organisations emerged. These include the National Youth League of Sweden, (Nationella ungdomsförbundet, founded in 1918), The November 30 association, (30-novemberföreningen, founded in 1921), The Lund National Student Club (Lunds nationella studentklubb, founded in 1924), The Swedish-German Academic Association, (Svensk-tyska akademiska förbundet, founded in 1922), The National Socialist Student Club (Nationalsocialistiska studentklubben, founded in 1930) and The Young Swedes Student Association (Ungsvenska studentföreningen, founded in 1934). In their own publications, representatives reported on their growing popularity among Lund’s students. Several historians have also shown that many people in the university cities, especially in Lund and Uppsala, had a keen eye to the New Germany. This raises the question of how Lund Film Society navigated in this political tug o’ war. Against this background, a closer look at Lund Film Society’s choice to travel to both Nazi-Germany and the Soviet Union seems warranted.\n\nDuring the 1930s, the debate about the Peoples Home (Folkhemmet) continued in Sweden. At the same time, political turbulence shook several European countries. Many Swedish intellectuals chose to visit the scenes of these upheavals, such as the Soviet Union Spain, and Nazi Germany, and often told of their experiences when they returned to their home country. Historians Marie Cronqvist and Agneta Edman have described the travelogue as a popular literary genre during the 1930s that allowed the authors to relate to changes in Swedish social development: ‘Through travel and encounters with the other, which is both partly familiar and completely foreign, one’s own attitude, one’s own identity, is carved out.’ In a similar manner, the travelogues published by travellers from Lund Film Society point to prevailing attitudes on issues of ideology, politics and, not least, the view of the film medium, the modern medium par excellence.\n\nLund Film Society’s travel to the Soviet Union in 1936\n\nDuring the spring of 1936, Lund Film Society travelled to Leningrad and Moscow. The program before the trip to the Soviet Union was just as eclectic as it had been the year before with borrowed films from several well-established Swedish film companies combined with short animated advertisements, information films and educational films. Although most of these films lacked a political tendency, there were several propaganda elements in the program. This season, not only did diplomatic representatives of Germany contribute film to the film society, but so did their Soviet counterparts. In the first instance, it was yet again the German Legation, this time in Copenhagen, that provided the film society with films. The contacts with German film companies and diplomats appear to have been well-established by this time.\n\nLund Film Society revered the Soviet montage film, in particular silent films such as the Bronenosets Potiomkin (Sergei Eisenstein, 1925), Konets Sankt-Peterburga (Vsevolod Pudovkin and Michail Doller, 1927), and Zemlja (Aleksandr Dovchenko,1930). These canonised films were circulated in the European film societies and they were relatively easy to borrow or rent from neighbouring countries’ film societies, and as a result Soviet films were screened frequently also in Lund. During the 1930s, the Russian film underwent radical changes, with the state and Josef Stalin taking greater control of the film industry. Like the German films discussed above, the Soviet films shown by Lund Film Society had strong propaganda features. In the spring before the trip, for example, the adventure film Aerograd (Aleksandr Dovchenko, 1935) was screened, one of the Stalin era’s most explicitly anti-Japanese propaganda films. The film portrays the Japanese more or less as lower-standing and the film is permeated by gross racism. The film screening garnered a lot of attention. Sydsvenska Dagbladet described the film as ‘robber’s propaganda’ and according to the reviewer, its only merit was that it could serve as ‘good propaganda for the military defense.’Biografbladet stated that ‘[f]rom the point of view of a Swedish audience, the blatant communist character of the content should make the film pretty – exclusionary.’ Even among the members there was some dissatisfaction and after the show a member of the audience is said to have erupted: ‘How could you screen such a film?’ Just like the German legation, the Trade Representative of the Socialist Soviet Republic’s Union in Stockholm was ready to contribute film propaganda to the film society’s program. Although some reviewers and members expressed their reservations about the screening of Soviet propaganda, there is much that suggests that films with political tendencies, such as censorship-prohibited films and artistic avant-garde films, had some allure for the members during the interwar period.\n\nIn April 1936, 55 people travelled with Lund Film Society via Stockholm and Helsinki to the Soviet Union. Unlike the journeys to Germany this trip was open for all members of the Swedish Film Societies National Association (founded in 1936) and for this reason senior and professional members formed a considerable part of the group. The trip was initiated by the Soviet tourist agency Intourist, who contacted the film society management and offered a discounted package price for a study trip in the country. During the interwar period, there were several state organisations that organised trips for tourists in the Soviet Union. While VOKS (Institute for Cultural Relations) was the most prominent organisation, and the one that focused specifically on cultural relations, Intourist was an organisation that primarily took care of ordinary middle-class tourists. Previous research shows that these Soviet institutes planned study visits and made sure that participants got to see what they wanted or what they should see. Some of the stops on the ten-day trip were undoubtedly tailor-made for the film society, such as visits to the nationally dominant film company Mosfilms’ and the German-Soviet film company Mezhrabpomfilm’s studios in Moscow, but the stops also included tourist destinations such as the Hermitage and the Revolution Museum. Just as in Germany, prominent people in the business acted as hosts to the film society’s delegates. In this case, it was Boris Shumyatsky, a then-leading figure in the Soviet film industry, later one of those executed by Josef Stalin, who welcomed the Swedes.\n\nThe trip garnered a great deal of attention in Biografbladet and under the heading ‘Young forces,’ the film society in Lund was praised for not being passive in the face of ‘the still lacking opportunities for the youngsters’ theoretical education ahead of a possible practical pursuit but rather taking the matter into their own hands. In a longer travelogue in the same issue, Werner, under the signature Ciné, discussed the film society’s decision to go east. Of particular importance, Werner argued, was the increased awareness of the possibilities of studying practical filmmaking in the Soviet Union. Besides the film studios, which he judged to be far behind their Western European and American counterparts, Werner was impressed by the All-Russian State University of Cinematography (VGIK), one of the world’s oldest film schools, and the resources invested in its education. Werner lamented the lack of similar institutions in Sweden and noted that the prospects for Swedes to study practical filmmaking abroad, for example in Russia, were small. In the Stockholm University student magazine, Gaudeamus, Werner developed his thoughts on the film academy and at the same time emphasised its shortcomings: ‘They are not – as it may be easy to believe – of a political nature, so that the propagandistic aspects of cinema are not constantly put on a pedestal. The shortcomings are more profound and definitely less dependent upon our times. They lie in the Slavic race’s respect for organization and the consequent tendency to try to push also the unorganizable into the organization.’ In other words, Werner criticised the school’s inefficiency, something he saw as a manifestation of the mentality of the Russian ‘race.’\n\nIn the 1930s, many Swedish intellectuals chose to travel to the Soviet Union and several travelogues were published on the subject. While some travelogues were criticised for their outsider perspective, especially because of their authors’ lacking language skills, this criticism could not be made in the present case. Gösta Werner’s interest in Russia originated with his student times. He studied Slavic languages for a while, and participated in a longer study trip to Hungary, Bulgaria and the Balkan Peninsula. As a result of his studies, he thus had some basic knowledge of the language. Other stories from the Soviet Union were received with scepticism with reference to the traveller’s attitude towards the country. The sociologist Paul Hollander has coined the term ‘political pilgrims’ to describe the phenomenon of Western visitors to communist dictatorships, pointing out that this kind of traveller, often with a positive attitude towards the visiting country, tends to ignore repression and totalitarian traits. In fact, many contemporary travellers were aware that they could be accused of being prejudiced, that is, of being political pilgrims.\n\nThe leadership in Lund Film Society also showed an awareness of this risk, and before the departure they tried to emphasise their political neutrality in several ways. Firstly, the board did not allow just anyone to join. For example, a potential participant, a former member of the Communist Youth League in Sweden, was refused to join on the basis of his political sympathies. In addition, their apolitical attitude was emphasised in various travelogues. For example, in Dagens Nyheter, a film society member stated that they were trying to be aware of prejudice about the host country: ‘Whether traveling to Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union without too much preconceived notions, the utter unreliability of professional journalism must be noted here, as in most areas.’ In Biografbladet, Gösta Häggström, the new chair of the film society, emphasised the film society’s multifaceted programming: ‘We are completely politically neutral – if we screen Pudovkin’s The Deserter on one occasion, then we will show the German film Horst Wessel next!’\n\nThe picture painted by the members of the film society appeared ambivalent regarding the Soviet Union. On the one hand, several members were pleasantly surprised by how the Russian cultural heritage had been treated after the revolution, which is perhaps not surprising given that cultural life was the aspect of the building of the new society that participants were exposed to above anything else during the journey. On the other hand, a number of travellers complained about Russian food, hygiene and perceived inefficiency. As one participant commented in Dagens Nyheter: ‘The impressions oscillate continuously from the wildest enthusiasm to the deepest disgust and dislike.’ In other words, although the reception was considered to be good, the Soviet Union emerged in many ways as a foreign, essentially separate and, in many ways unmodern country.\n\nAfter returning to Lund all communication with the Soviet Union’s film industry ceased. Unlike the relationship with Ufa, where the highly regarded Carl Opitz personally had a good eye to film society, the contacts with Mosfilm and Mezhrabpomfilm never became lasting.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough historians have carefully examined the academic environment of university cities such as Lund and Uppsala and the relationship with Nazism, little attention has been paid to how the political upheaval affected the growing film society movement. Similarly, most scholarship on film as a tool for cultural diplomacy has focused on the film festival circuit, rather than film societies and the cultural exchange that they were engaged in. In this article, I have analysed the activities of Lund Film Society during the interwar period, with special focus on the trips to Germany and the Soviet Union. The main question examined is what function the journeys had for the film society. Whereas Lund Film Society’s connections to Germany have been dealt with previously, their travels and events have primarily served as illustrations for ‘German-friendly’ trends in the university city of Lund. To better understand the specific conceptions, views and aspirations that characterised the film society at this point in time, I have studied previously overlooked archival material from its ten first years and the travelogues that participants wrote about their experiences abroad. In this way, I have intended to in a more nuanced picture describe Lund Film Society’s relationship with German and Soviet films, respectively.\n\nMy examination of Lund Film Society’s programming during the interwar period shows that both German and Soviet films with strong propaganda tendencies were screened regularly, largely as a result of such film material being made available to them by the German Legation and the Socialist Soviet Union’s Trade Representation. This resonates with Nicholas J. Cull’s notion that a central tendency within ‘cinematic diplomacy’ is the use of films as cultural ambassadors on behalf of one’s own country. At the same time, the analysis shows that the program was multi-faceted, which indicates that the film society did not prefer any particular political extreme. Just like censorship-prohibited and artistically challenging films, politically radical films also attracted the members of the film society and the screenings gave the film society attention in the press. In this way, it can be argued that the diplomatic legations of different countries played a greater role than previously claimed in the historiography of Lund Film Society.\n\nThe trips to Germany and the Soviet Union fulfilled several important functions for Lund Film Society. The film society was theoretically oriented and the possibilities of exploring the film medium practically were limited. During these journeys abroad, the film society managed to gain insight into how modern film studios worked in several different countries. At the same time, interest in cultural exchange was mutual. Nazi Germany worked purposefully with cultural-political propaganda and the extent of Ufa’s hospitality vis-à-vis the film society confirms that the trips were also given great importance by their host. Similarly, the Soviet Intourist reached out to the film society and arranged a tailor-made trip with visits to several film studios. The response from the members was great and the trips also attracted attention in the press.\n\nThe travelogues reveal a strong fascination for the large investments in film in the host countries. The ongoing activities at the film schools All-Russian State University of Cinematography and Ufa-Lehrschau were considered to be indicative of film’s transformative potential as a medium. At the same time, there were significant differences between relations with Germany and the Soviet Union. The visit to Mosfilm and Mezhrabpomfilm, which was praised in later historiography, was short and never resulted in a deeper relationship. In the case of Ufa, however, relations were also cultivated at home in Lund and the important representative Carl Opitz was not only elected as honorary member of the film society but also went on a lecture tour in Sweden and promoted German film. In terms of the travelogues, it is also clear that there was a marked scepticism about the Bolsheviks’ Soviet Union at the same time as many travellers were attracted by ‘the New Germany’ and its aesthetics. For Ufa and the Soviet hosts Mosfilm and Mezhrabpomfilm, the study trips functioned as an opportunity to showcase important film works, such as Triumph des Willens, to the ‘next generation’s social elite,’ to reiterate Ola Larsmo’s description of the Swedish universities of the 1930s. In other words, the cultural exchange with Lund Film Society functioned as a chess pawn in the competition over influence in the Swedish film sphere, one with a considerably higher cultural pedigree than the battle over market shares on the open cinema market."
