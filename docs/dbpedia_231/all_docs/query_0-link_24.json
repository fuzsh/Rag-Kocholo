Referring to the penultimate paragraph of my telegram 111 of May 2, I report that the Film Commission at its meeting yesterday morning appointed a subcommittee and the latter conferred throughout the afternoon with Hays and again during the evening, holding a meeting of ratification this morning.\n\nAfter the principle of enforced export of French films had been abandoned, an agreement was reached which will enable continuation of business in France by the American film industry under conditions of harmonious and cordial cooperation. Hays has reported fully the details of agreement to his home office which will in turn communicate them to the Department.\n\nHays is sailing tomorrow for home.\n\nI am greatly gratified at this result, and Herriot has acted certainly in a most conciliatory and broad-minded manner. At the conclusion of the meeting he expressed to me in a cordial message his appreciation of my cooperation and his feeling that I would share his satisfaction equally because the arrangement had been effected in such a way as to promote greater friendliness hereafter."
