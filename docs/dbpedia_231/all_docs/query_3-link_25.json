        "text": "&amp;laquo;A historic day&amp;raquo; says Lasse Skagen, the Artistic Director of the Films From the South Foundation. The guidelines for SØRFOND, the new fund supporting film production, are now finally in place.\n\nArgentinian director Lucía Puenzo (pictured) was present at the festival’s pitch forum 2011 in order to seek funding.\n\nAfter a time-consuming process regarding the approval of the guidelines, SØRFOND is finally up-and running. The 20th January 2012, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs approved the guidelines proposed by the Norwegian Film Institute and the Films From the South Foundation. The guidelines specify the conditions required in order to apply for support from the fund.\n\n«A historic day» said Lasse Skagen, the Artistic Director of the Films From the South Foundation. «We have worked since 2008 in order to set up this fund, which will give a new impetus to the production of quality films from the South, while also linking the Norwegian film industry closer to what happens outside the West».\n\nFilms From the South has, since 1991, presented films and filmmakers from Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. Now the Films From the South Foundation has extended its activities to also include the financing of films. «It is a milestone in Films From the South’s history», highlights Skagen. «It is very broad-minded of the Norwegian Ministries of Foreign and Cultural Affairs to work together in order to enhance the availability of South-films on the international cinematic stage. The fact that Norway has created this has already caught the international attention, and we hope that the next few years will provide a return in production that will be noticed in the film community all around the world», finishes Skagen.\n\nThe purpose of the SØRFOND grants is to stimulate the production of films in developing countries, where such productions might not have been possible due to political or economic reasons. In 2012, a total support of 4,000,000 NOK will be allocated. The Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has provided the money to the fund and the Norwegian Ministry of Cultural Affairs is responsible for the operational support. The Norwegian Film Institute and the Films From the South Foundation are responsible for the operation of the fund. The grant will help to strengthen film as a mean for cultural expression, promote diversity and artistic integrity on the international film stage, and also strengthen freedom of expression. The grant will also contribute to increased cooperation between the Norwegian and the international film industries.\n\nApplications must be submitted through a Norwegian co-producer, which is one of the basic conditions required to apply for the fund, and the application form is located on the fund’s website www.sorfond.com. It also features other relevant information about the fund."
