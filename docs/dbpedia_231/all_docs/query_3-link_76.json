This article examines the negotiations between filmmakers and censorship groups in order to show the stories that censors did, and did not, want told about pregnancy, childbirth and abortion, as well as how studios fought to tell their own stories about human reproduction. I find that censors considered pregnancy to be a state of grace and a holy obligation that was restricted to married women. For censors, human reproduction was not only a private matter, it was also an unpleasant biological process whose entertainment value was questionable. They worried that realistic portrayals of pregnancy and childbirth would scare young women away from pursuing motherhood.

When reviewing these films, many critics fretted over whether comedy was an appropriate mode of representation for probing fascism’s power dynamics. This debate took place within a broader discussion about aesthetics, progressive politics, and mass media in a time of war. This essay analyzes how the production and reception of anti-fascist comedies were shaped by the twin pressures of war and censorship. The period’s film criticism will be placed within a larger social context that included the industry’s self-censoring Production Code Administration (PCA), and the propagandizing mandate of the Office of War Information (OWI), the wartime agency tasked with communicating the Roosevelt administration’s war aims through media. By examining studio correspondence with the PCA, official OWI documents and panel discussions from the 1943 Writers’ Congress, I argue that a patriotic decorum grounded in universalism and realism emerged in the latter years of the war as the dominant mode of anti-fascist representation. Ironically, this patriotic decorum ignored how audiences processed war-themed content while eliding how censors, critics, and propagandists positioned the medium as a vehicle for wartime propaganda.\n\nAbstract: Practically from its origins, and especially once it had been consolidated as a spectacle for mass consumption, American cinema had to deal with censorship by different authorities at local, state and federal levels. The industry responded to the problems arising from such censorship by introducing self-regulation, expressed in the Motion Picture Production Code, popularly known as the Hays Code. In addition to their influence on the subjects chosen and how these were treated, these mechanisms of censorship and self-regulation had a highly significant influence on the filmic form. What role did censorship play in the transition from the cinema of attractions to a more narrative model? Was it a determining factor in the establishment of the Institutional Mode of Representation? How did the Production Code interact with other systems and formulas associated with classical cinema, such as the star system or the different film genres? How did the progressive relaxation and subsequent abandonment of the Code affect the mise-en-scène of films? How did classical cinema handle problematic elements related to filmic form resulting from the restrictions of the Code? In this section, six internationally renowned scholars address these questions and offer their views on the subject.\n\nIn the mid-twentieth century, film studios sent their screenplays to the Hays Office, Hollywood's official censorship body, and to the Catholic Church's Legion of Decency for approval and recommendations for revision. This essay examines how filmmakers crafted stories involving evolutionary biology and how religiously motivated movie censorship groups modified these cinematic narratives in order to depict what they considered to be more appropriate visions of humanity's origins. I find that censorship groups were concerned about the perceived impact of science fiction cinema on the public's belief systems and on the wider cultural meanings of evolution. By controlling the stories told about evolution in science fiction cinema, censorship organizations believed that they could regulate the broader cultural meanings of evolution itself. But this is not a straightforward story of \"science\" versus \"religion.\" There were significant differences among these groups as to how to censor evolution, as well as changes in their attitudes toward evolutionary content over time. As a result, I show how censorship groups adopted diverse perspectives, depending on their perception of what constituted a morally appropriate science fiction story about evolution. In June 1942, screenwriters William Bruckner and Robert Metzler completed their script for the first science fiction (SF) film produced by Twentieth Century Fox-Dr. Renault's Secret. The film was based on Gaston Leroux's 1912 novel Balaoo, whose plot involves a scientist teaching an ape to speak, read, and write, in order to prove that humans are glorified apes. 1 In the novel, the \"ape-man\" is physically indistinguishable from an educated human. 2 But when the ape-man's bestial nature surfaces and he murders several people, the scientist realizes that the \"human conscience\" is\n\nFrom July 1, 1934, to November 1, 1968, the Production Code Administration (PCA) oversaw the creation of American motion pictures, in order to improve Hollywood’s moral standing. To assist in this endeavor, the studios produced film adaptations of classic literature, such as the plays of William Shakespeare. In the first two years of the Code’s inception, two Shakespearean films were produced by major studios: A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1935) and Romeo and Juliet (1936). But were these classic adaptations able to avoid the censorship that other films endured? With the use of archived collections, film viewings, and an in-depth analysis of the plays, multiple versions of the scripts, and other available surviving documents, I was able to see how these productions were affected by the enforcement of film censorship and what it said about the position of Shakespeare’s work in society. A Midsummer Night’s Dream tended to use self-regulation, so as to avoid the censorship of the PCA. However, the film did not escape without some required changes. In spite of the filmmakers’ efforts, there were a few textual changes and the fairy costumes required revisions to meet the PCA’s standards. In the case of Romeo and Juliet, the PCA was far more involved in all stages of the film’s production. There were many documented text changes and even a case in which the censors objected to how the actors and director executed a scene on film. The motion picture was created as if it were of the greatest importance by all involved. And, as it were, the existing archives paint a picture of a production that was a sort of battleground in a sociopolitical war between the censors and the filmmakers. As both films arrived on the international stage, this sociopolitical campaigning did not end. During international distribution, the films were each accepted, rejected, and forced to endure further censorship, in order to become acceptable for public screening. This censorship often relayed a message about the location’s societal views and its contrast to American society.\n\nScarface is one of the most recognized films of the early 1930s Pre-Code era. Most research of this film has been directed at how Scarface works as an important summation of the gangster genre. In addition, historians often refer to the film as an early biopic of real life gangster Al Capone. What has not been covered in depth is the lengthy censorship battle between producer Howard Hughes and the censorship boards in Hollywood and around the United States. Several articles touch on the censorship issues but quickly defer to larger industry issues of the day. The purpose of this paper is to trace the specific trajectory of Scarface through the censorship process. Relying on underutilized Scarface records in the MPPDA archives as well as the trade press archives of the early 1930s, this paper conveys the story of one of the most contested films during the censorship years in Hollywood."
