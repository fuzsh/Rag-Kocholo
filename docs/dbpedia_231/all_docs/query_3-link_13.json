        "text": "Renowned producer-director Azizur Rahman Buli passed away while undergoing treatment at a hospital at Uttara in the capital in the wee hours of Monday. He was 75.\n\nAzizur Rahman Buli was born in Old Dhaka on May 1, 1946. He made his debut in the film industry as a producer with Ashok Ghosh-directed Nacher Putul in the early ‘70s. He made his directorial debut with Shesh Uttar in 1980.\n\nCelebrated artistes, namely Razzak, Shabana, Ilias Kanchan, Babita, Olivia, Rozina and others worked with Azizur Rahman Buli, who produced and directed nearly 50 films, namely Love in Singapore, Nepali Meye, Desh Bidesh, Shesh Uttar, Danda Mere Thanda, Raja Rani Badshah and others.\n\nColleagues and well-wishers expressed shock at the death of Azizur Rahman Buli and recalled his contribution.\n\nFilmmaker and lyricist Dewan Nazrul said, ‘Azizur Rahman Buli began his journey in the film industry as a producer and later became a director. I am deeply saddened by his passing. He was a broad-minded person. He made an important contribution to the country’s film industry. I had immense respect for him. He will live on through his works. May his soul rest in peace.’\n\nPresident of Bangladesh Film Artistes’ Association actor Ilias Kanchan said, ‘Azizur Rahman Buli was basically a producer. He also directed a few films. He was a true gentleman and straightforward person. I worked with him in two films titled Shesh Uttar and Lalu Sardar. I acted opposite Shabana for the first time in Shesh Uttar and played two characters in Lalu Sardar.’\n\nProducer Khorshed Alam Khasru said, ‘Azizur Rahman Buli passed away while undergoing treatment at a hospital at Uttara in the capital at around 3:20am on Monday. He was a good leader. He served as president of Bangladesh Film Directors’ Association. He viewed the film industry as his family. He brought his brother actor Mahmud Koli into the film industry and married renowned actress Anjana. However, the couple went their separate ways. He was always there for young producers and directors when they needed him. The younger generation should follow in his footsteps. I am deeply saddened by the news of his death.’\n\nAzizur Rahman Buli was buried at Banani Graveyard in the capital after his namaz-e-janaza following zuhr prayers."
