        "text": "Broadminded -- Lugosi plays comedy with Joe E. Brown\n\n---\n\nBroadminded, First National, 1931, starring Joe E. Brown, Bela Lugosi, Ona Munson, William Collier Jr. and Thelma Todd. 3 stars -\n\nThis semi-obscure Joe E. Brown comedy is a treat for cult movie fans who want to watch a different Lugosi. As Pancho Arango, a hot-tempered Latin lover, Lugosi shows his comic skills in dueling with the clownish, wide-mouthed Brown, who pesters him.\n\nPlot involves Brown and Collier as playboys traveling across the country and meeting girls. In California the leads fall in love with various blondes, including Munson, who played Belle Watling in Gone with the Wind.\n\nFilm has funny moments and Lugosi shows his versatile, comedic character acting skills. I caught this long-awaited viewing courtesy of Turner Classic Movies. Opening scene is of a \"baby party\" for adults that is prurient when one looks at the women, and creepy when looking at the males, especially Brown! Despite the odd opening, this is a typical well-done First National Pictures pre-code comedy. Thelma Todd was a beautiful actress who did comedy well, even appearing as a star in Hal Roach shorts.\n\nThe best part of this film is that Bela Lugosi easily disproves a long-held idea by too many that he can only horror films. He has great comic timing and would have made a dependable comic foil for Brown in several films had studios execs had an inkling. Lugosi also showed great comic skills in the 1933 star-fest, International House, with W.C,. Fields."
