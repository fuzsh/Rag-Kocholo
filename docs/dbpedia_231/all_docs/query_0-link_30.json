        "text": "TELEVISION may be the dirtiest four-syllable word in the American cultural lexicon. But if we like to blame the medium for dragging down our collective taste and I.Q., in Europe, television is still perceived as a cultural institution with a mission to inform as well as amuse. It may be host to dubbed ''Dukes of Hazzard'' reruns, American-style celebrity magazines and inane game shows, but turn on network television tonight in France and you're as likely to see a documentary about poverty in India or a full-length broadcast of ''Carmen.''\n\nYou're also likely to see theatrical films that were not simply bought by the networks but were also made by them. Yes, there is made-for-TV drama in Europe, and it runs the gamut from movie-of-the-week melodrama to educational projects like the complete plays of Beckett on Channel 4 in Britain and the forthcoming ''Les Miserables'' with Gerard Depardieu and John Malkovich on TF1 in France. But there is also what you might call made-for-movies TV: European television networks, whether public or private, are the major players in financing feature films for theatrical release. Many observers believe that the dominance of television support has left Europeans to make small, cheap, character-driven films that can't compete in a world market. But a number of European channels -- particularly in France, Germany and Britain -- are devoting increasing financial resources in an attempt to compete with Hollywood.\n\nAccording to a study by the European Audiovisual Observatory in Strasbourg, France, television investment accounts for between 30 and 74 percent of the financing for the production of feature films in Europe, depending upon the country. Much of that revenue is generated by public funds derived from taxes on television companies and by pre-sale agreements, in which television stations support projects in exchange for the right to broadcast the films two years after their theatrical release.\n\nThe Audiovisual Observatory, which gathers data about broadcast media in 34 countries, reported that almost 80 percent of the feature films produced in Europe are made in Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Britain. And in all those countries, filmmakers receive some degree of financing from television.\n\nTelevision companies are the driving force in the business development of filmmaking in Europe, with Canal-Plus in France, Britain's Channel 4 and others acting as mini-film studios. In the last few years, they have expanded their involvement with the creation of Studio Canal-Plus and FilmFour Limited, stand-alone entities that receive funds from the channels that own them but produce movies for theatrical release. The films, of course, have second and third lives on free and pay channels; but European television serves to support, not compete with, national film industries. In France, for example, pre-sale contributions from television networks are generally not paid until the film is shown in theaters; this prevents the possibility of straight-to-TV movies, but has created the need for short-term bank loans to see filmmakers through development, production and post-production. Film advertising is not allowed on French television, to provide something of a level playing field for rich production companies and more modest independent producers.\n\nAmerican network television's contribution to dramatic filmmaking is the Movie of the Week, but in Europe even commercial television isn't automatically dismissed as an ersatz vehicle for interesting work. ''There's no stigma for actors, writers, directors, because of the structure and depth of British television and the history of the BBC,'' said Paul Webster, who heads FilmFour. ''If Ian Holm does a TV production, it won't affect his career like it would Gene Hackman's.'' It was a British television performance that led to Ralph Fiennes's Hollywood career-launching role in ''Schindler's List.'' Ingmar Bergman's ''Scenes From a Marriage'' (1973) is an edited version of a six-part drama originally made for Swedish TV. Some of Britain's most experimental directors -- Ken Loach, Mike Leigh and Danny Boyle -- started in television. (In the case of Mr. Leigh, those were BBC plays done without a script.) Recently, two noted French directors made challenging films for the French-German channel Arte -- Claire Denis's ''Beau Travail'' and Erick Zonca's ''Petit Voleur'' -- that were later released theatrically, further obscuring the boundaries between films made for television and films destined for the multiplex.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
