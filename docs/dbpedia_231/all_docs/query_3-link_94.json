        "text": "Vaani Kapoor’s recent release Chandigarh Kare Aashiqui opposite Ayushmann Khurrana has gotten her rave reviews on playing the role of a transwoman with such conviction.\n\nShedding some light on the same subject, on how it feels to be working in the films at a time where such unique storylines are being made into films and accepted, she commented, ‘“The fact that the industry has produced two back to back progressive films like Chandigarh Kare Aashiqui (CKA) and Badhaai Do shows the paradigm shift that the Hindi film industry is going through. As an artiste, I feel I’m working in the best era of cinema because there is wide acceptance of subjects that were deemed forbidden for actors to choose.”\n\nVaani is extremely grateful that loyal moviegoers are accepting such broad-minded subjects in films and are contributing to bringing a much-needed change in society.\n\nShe further adds, “I’m delighted that both CKA and Badhaai Do found its audience and entertained people with a heartfelt story of inclusivity in a highly divisive world. As an actor and a consumer of cinema, I love entertainers that can leave a message and I’m proud that I was part of an uplifting film like CKA! I hope the film made the right impact on the minds of audiences. The fact that my countrymen are encouraging cinema on gender equality is an amazing feeling because we all know that we can be an extremely progressive country.”"
