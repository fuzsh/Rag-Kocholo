        "text": "Tumbledown is the semi-rockabilly semi-Americana project of Mike Herrea, lead vocalist of the left coast punk band MXPX. They have just announced that they will be preforming a free show at the Yucca Tap Room on Wednesday March 24th.\n\nThe music carries an old-school country-western swagger, reminiscent of Hank Williams, Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash, with Herrera strumming a big dreadnaught acoustic over a chugging snare drum and stand-up bass. Guitarist Jack Parker adds to the Americana, with swiftly meandering, mean lead work.\n\n“I don’t claim that we’re a country band… we’re just a band…I just like the fact that it’s a different sound,” Herrera says. “Different than a country band, different than a punk rock band, different than a rockabilly band — we’re somewhere there in the ether, somewhere in between it all.”\n\nTumbledown will be preforming with Andrew Anderson and special guests TBA.\n\nWatch a video of Tumbledown after the break."
