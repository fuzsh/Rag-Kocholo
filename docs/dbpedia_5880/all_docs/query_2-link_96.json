        "text": "Mike Herrera, the lead singer and bassist of MXPX, released a brand new episode of his podcast the Mike Herrera Podcast today, which features a very in-depth interview with Pierre Bouvier.\n\nThis interview, which I wholeheartedly recommend listening to in full, reveals a number of interesting stories and insights into the life of Simple Plan’s lead singer. First and foremost, it partially serves as a promo for MXPX’s new upcoming Christmas song, which is to be released tomorrow (Friday, November 29th), and will be featuring Pierre Bouvier and singer Emily Whitehurst.\n\nIn the interview, the two musicians discussed a number of issues including the way Simple Plan approach the song-writing process. Here, Pierre confirmed that him and Chuck have already begun writing – not only separately but also together with outside song-writers, naming Fil Thorpe-Evans, the recently departed member of the pop-punk band Neck Deep, as one of their current collaborators:\n\n“So I’ve been writing for the last few months but a little slowly, kinda here and there. And Chuck and I like to get together to do some sessions with some outside writers just to throw some ideas around, you know… cause we’ve been writing together for so long, it gets… sometimes you just kinda get like yeah, I can write a song, but it would be nice to have someone to be like: ‘’Yeah, this is cool.. or think about this or…’ So we have a couple sessions in LA, we’ve been doing that for the last few albums.\n\nSo we do some of that on our own, we do some of it with some people… So I’m up here for a session with a guy from… you know the band Neck Deep? So the guitar player, Fil, I guess left the band and became a producer/writer so we’re writing a song with him right now and another guy that works at the Madden company… And then yeah, so we’re doing that. We kinda like sprinkle out the writing process with a few writing sessions, so we do like – I’ll be at home, at a studio home.. not like a studio but like a guest house where I do my studio stuff and I write, write, write and I get together with some people and I throw some ideas around, go back and work on it again. So, it’s a fun little process.”\n\n– Pierre Bouvier –\n\nHere, Pierre also mentioned that one of the things he’s been struggling with all his career is the awkwardness of writing songs with outside song-writers because of how vulnerable it feels to open up in this way to someone you (often) do not really know.\n\nAs far as song-writing for the new record goes, Pierre noted that he thinks him and Chuck will be in the song-writing phase probably until spring of next year. This means that the earliest we could expect Simple Plan to return to the studio to record the new album is summer 2019.\n\nBesides that, in this interview Mike also shared his deep appreciation of Simple Plan mentioning MXPX in their early song Grow Up and their constant devotion to his band, revealing that in a way this also inspired him to return the favor by referencing Simple Plan on MXPX’s own new album in the song ‘The Way We Do’. We also learned in this interview that the tour that MXPX refer to regarding Simple Plan in the lyrics of this song, was not in fact a tour of MXPX with Simple Plan but with Reset. Pierre noted that it was the exact tour that by its end resulted in the big fall-out between him and Chuck and it became the catalyst of the eventual foundation of Simple Plan.\n\nIf you have about an hour to spare, definitely give this interview a listen to learn more about Pierre’s view of the music industry, which is wrapped nicely in a very smooth conversation between these two musicians:\n\nOn Friday night, Idobi radio aired the newest episode of the Mike Herrera Hour podcast, which was recorded in Seattle on September 3rd and featured Seb Lefebvre from Simple Plan. In the podcast, Seb discussed a number of very interesting topics including the beginnings of Simple Plan and being called sell-outs, the differences between his morning routine on tour and at home, speaking English better thanks to joining the band, starting the Man Of The Hour show and also David’s absence on tour and what his hopes are regarding fans’ reactions when David does come back.\n\nYou can listen to the episode in full below, or just check out the recap I prepared for you under the player:\n\nRecap of Mike Herrera Hour feat. Seb Lefebvre\n\n– Seb was never an actual janitor as a teenager – he just used to clean the gymnasium at his school every night after school\n\n– he knew Pierre and Chuck through Reset – the most popular school band at his school (his actual first show) and he knew Jeff as his brother’s best friend and the school’s rock god\n\n– Seb was the most convenient band member to join the band (SP), cause he lived the closest and could get to rehearsals fast (on his rollerblades with his guitar on his back), since he live in the same area as Chuck\n\n– he discussed the negative reactions SP got after separating from Reset (which was most punk-rock) especially from their hometown and starting their own thing, which wasn’t as political and wasn’t as punk-rock – they started being called mainstream sell-outs\n\n– Mike admirers SP for always looking to the future an learning from their mistakes\n\n– Seb thinks because Chuck is not just a drummer, but he is mostly the manager and he keeps informed about everything that involves the band, has helped the band a lot to not rely with these things on other people and keep being involved in every decision\n\n– Seb discussed his love for Framus guitars and Jeff’s love for Fender\n\n– Seb’s morning routine on tour: Seb’s the first one up (8:30-9:00am), breakfest, yoga and workout, shower, stroll around the city, work on laptop – a very chill time, he doesn’t like to stress out\n\n– recently, Seb started to live more of a minimalist lifestyle\n\n– Seb’s morning routine at home: he has to wait for his wife to be at work and his child at daycare before he can do anything just for himself – other than that, he tries to spend as much time with his family as he can, but sometimes, when he has things to do, he asks his wife to make plans with her friends, so he can work on stuff on his own\n\n– when he was young, he didn’t have a lot of English-speaking friends, his English wasn’t very good, but being in a band and English suddenly being everywhere has helped him speak much better English\n\n– Seb prefers binging TV shows than watching them in real-time\n\n– after SNGA, Tom from Idobi called them to start a radio show and Seb always loved doing radio interviews and Pat always hung around them when he was touring with SP, they gave it a go and that’s how the Man Of The Hour radio show started\n\n– David’s absence on tour – SP don’t want to replace him and want him to get better – but out of respect for the fans, they continue touring and just use David’s pre-recorded bass live and Chady plays bass on some tracks. Seb respects David for coming out with his depression and for seeking help\n\n– Seb hopes that when David comes back, their fans will respect him, not patronize him, not asking him questions about his depression and will just let him be – he also confirmed that David probably won’t be doing interviews to talk about it when he comes back\n\n– Mike asked Seb what he likes to do when he produces music – he likes to begin from the start – he likes to write songs with them and work as if they are starting a new band – as if the artist is a blank canvas"
