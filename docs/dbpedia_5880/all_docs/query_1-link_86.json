Today, they proudly release their highly anticipated 11th studio album, Find A Way Home, now available on all major streaming platforms. To celebrate the release of Find A Way Home, the band put on a massive live-stream concert for their fans across the internet, broadcasting live from partner platforms such as YouTube, SPIN, Alternative Press, Rock Sound, SiriusXM Faction Punk, 23Punk, Furnace Fest, Punk Rock MBA, Today I Grew Up, idobi Radio, and more – in case you missed it, check out the replay via YouTube here.\n\nFind A Way Home comprises 13 original tracks, all recorded at Monkey Trench Studios in Bremerton, WA. The album was engineered and mixed by Ryan Furlott, who also shares a producing credit on the album alongside MxPx. As MxPx gears up for an exciting year ahead, they are set to headline Furnace Fest on September 22 and perform the highly-anticipated When We Were Young Festival on October 21 and 22. In addition, fans can anticipate a series of headlining shows, with the first announced show being at The Hollywood Palladium on January 6 with Less Than Jake, Relient K, and Smoking Popes.\n\nSince their inception in 1992, MxPx has lived the music industry roller coaster. They’ve spent some time on major labels, selling millions of records along the way, to these days self-releasing their own music with a small team. They’ve toured the entire world 10x over and to this day can show up pretty much anywhere and have an audience that wants to see them. It’s a dream that they don’t take for granted. They spent six months refining songs for Find A Way Home in hopes of delivering something both lifelong fans and new fans would love. But most importantly delivering something that felt like MxPx. It’s been a long and amazing journey, and this is their new chapter. Find A Way Home.\n\nKeep a close eye out for upcoming announcements and new music releases from MxPx. Fans can now stream Find A Way Home everywhere music can be streamed, and purchase on MxPx.com.\n\nFind A Way Home Track List:\n\nNot Today\n\nThis Is What You Told Me\n\nWhat I Tell Myself\n\nCautious Optimistic\n\nExcuse My French\n\nStay Up All Night\n\nReady To Rage\n\nUndone\n\nCall Me\n\nMountains To Climb\n\nSunrise\n\nWhen We Broke Through\n\nMistakes Will Be Made\n\nMore About MxPx:\n\nMxPx still tours the world, just on their own schedule and completely on their own terms. They’ve been with major labels, they’ve been with independent labels, and they’ve done it on their own without labels. They’ve been the headlining band, they’ve been the opening band, they’ve played just about every major worldwide festival, and they’ve seen the world living a dream. MxPx has an RIAA-certified gold record (1998’s Slowly Going The Way of the Buffalo), they got the key to the City of Bremerton (for real, there are pictures to prove it), they were in a Super Bowl commercial, recorded the theme song of a major motion picture (Scooby-Doo, 2002), they own their recording studio (Monkey Trench Studios), and that’s just the beginning of the list.\n\nThe band has released ten full-length albums, alongside an even longer list of EPs, compilations, b-sides, and singles. “Let’s Ride,” released in 2018, has become one of the band’s most popular songs; a rare feat for a band this far into its career. It was later featured in Tony Hawk’s 2020 Pro Skater remaster which opened them up to an even wider worldwide audience.\n\nMxPx was also one of the most active bands during the COVID pandemic, frequently playing live (not pre-recorded) shows on the internet, and interacting with fans in real-time as they did it. “We wanted to be there when people needed us to be,” said Mike Herrera. MxPx plans to continue these shows even with the return of in-person concerts.\n\nFollow MxPx Online: MxPx.com // Facebook // Instagram // Twitter // Youtube\n\nAbout Author"
