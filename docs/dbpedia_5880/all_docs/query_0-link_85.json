        "text": "'m a professional musician and documentarian. I grew up playing bass and singing in MxPx (a punk band). I'm touring solo acoustic these days as MHM (Mike Herrera Music) as well as filling in on bass or guitar for various bands. My solo performances allow me to showcase several genres of music including Americana project Tumbledown. I write what I sing so I sing what I love. Yeah…yeah playing and singing, but that's not all. I'm a videographer, podcast host, and business owner. I document my experiences, personal connections, and perceptions along my journey. A web-series called Best Life is featured on my YouTube channel. The podcast I host is called the Mike Herrera Hour on IDOBI Radio. Monkey Trench Studios is my recording studio. Legionnaire is a line of clothing I co-founded. The Store has custom designed merchandise and recordings from all of my projects. Connect with me on Twitter or Facebook for regular updates; I'm always moving forward and trying to learn about the world around me. This life is so good at times and sometimes so heartbreaking. Take it in as much as you can. https://MikeHerrera.Net See CONTACT page for booking me as a live performer (I do fly outs), producer (even long distance), engineer, studio musician, studio singer, voice over work, feature work, public speaker, remixer, house shows, post production, video production, songwriting, private shows (not that kind!!), or you can get creative. Thanks!! -Mike Herrera Previous Bio: Most people know Mike Herrera as the tattooed and pierced punk stalwart who’s spent the last two decades pounding out one tuneful but tough album after another as the frontman for MxPx. Full-fledged fans who have followed Herrera’s twists and turns may also be aware of the eclectic singer’s exploits with alt-country outfit Tumbledown and the more pop-tinged territory of his sporadic side work with a band called Arthur. But even if all of the above are old hat to you, the secret identity that might still take you by surprise is that of Mike Herrera the acoustic troubadour. It’s not an unprecedented phenomenon for a punk-rock firebrand to take a solo singer/songwriter turn, but this phase in Herrera’s musical evolution occurs at a particularly crucial point in his career. This year marks the 20th anniversary of MxPx, and the trio has been out on tour in celebration of that milestone. Herrera happens to write most of his songs on acoustic guitar to begin with, even the MxPx tunes, so it’s only natural for him to explore additional outlets for his unrelenting creativity. Herrera put together a DIY disc called Live From The Basement for fans of his solo shows, but the title is to be taken literally. “It’s just a live recording of me, performing my songs in my basement,” he explains. “Not an official release, but something for fans to easily adjust to the broken down versions of some of their favorite songs.” Although he is putting energy into his solo work, Herrera continues to storm stages all over the world with MxPx All Stars.
