The McKnight Foundation and the administering partners for the McKnight Artist & Culture Bearer Fellowships committed to creating and supporting an artistic community in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity. The community of the McKnight Artist & Culture Bearer Fellowships includes people who engage with the fellowships program whether as applicants, fellows, panelists, contractors, collaborators, fellowships administrators, and staff of the McKnight Foundation and partnering organizations. As a community, we commit to creating and maintaining relationships that are free from harm, prejudice, and harassment. Community members agree to communicate directly and transparently regarding issues of conduct that could negatively impact the well-being of participating members and organizations. In the case of an accusation, legal action, or conviction, the McKnight Foundation and its fellowship program partners may gather and assess relevant information. If deemed necessary, the McKnight Foundation and its fellowship program partners may take administrative action up to and including the recommendation of participation in reconciliation or restorative justice processes; disqualification of an application; the termination of a contract; and the recall and/or termination of a fellowship.

Brady came to Minnesota from the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, having served there as Principal Bassoon since 2016. As soloist, Andrew demonstrates a commanding grasp of varying repertoire while bringing out the humanity in the music and connecting with listeners. Most recently, he premiered the orchestral version of “My Young Friend”, a piece which he commissioned from Stefan L. Smith based on poetry written by his grandmother, Elvena Bowers. Brady also returned to the ASO in December to perform “The Five Sacred Trees” by John Williams, itself also a work inspired by poetry.\n\nAn enthusiastic educator, Andrew loves sharing in the growth of young musicians. He currently works with the orchestras of GTCYS, and in the summer with students at festivals such as the Aspen Music Festival, National Youth Orchestra USA, National Orchestral Institute, Brevard Music Center, as well as others.

His banjo and guitar contain multitudes. Suspended between past and future, honoring the tradition while hijacking it, listening for its voice while reveling in its inarticulacies; this is how the thing sings. And the song, in the obsessive extensions of Metzger’s instruments, truly has no ending.” – The Wire, David Keenan.\n\nWebsite: Paulmetzger.net\n\nMike Kota, Voice, Guitar, Piano, Producer – Indie / Singer-Songwriter, Minneapolis\n\nMike Kota is a twenty-six-year-old singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist from Minneapolis.
