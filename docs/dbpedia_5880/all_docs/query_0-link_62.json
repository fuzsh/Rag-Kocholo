        "text": "OTHER GREAT STORIES\n\nUncategorizedTHE ANNOUNCEMENT August 28, 2024 by Holly Jones For the past few days, the internet has been riddled with rumors upon rumors about the Linkin Park announcement. The crazy one was Sum41’s lead singer Deryck Whibley would be joining the band after their farewell tour. Well, that turned out to be untrue; the internet was wrong – imagine that. This band has been a staple of our youth, well for most of us. After the passing of Chester Bennington, the band has been playing it low key. Linkin Park is a spiritual voyage; they are best known for hits like “Faint,” “In The End,” “The Catalyst,” “What I’ve Done,” “Numb,” “Paper Cut,” “Waiting for the End,” “Bleed It Out,” “Breaking the Habit,” and “One Step Closer” among other era-defining songs. For most of their fans, LP was part of our teenage or young adult history. So, did the hype live up to the expectation? The band’s website had a countdown clock. Then, when it hit zero, it scrambled and started counting up. Instantly the internet went nuts with comment after comment. Some people said we had all been Rick-Rolled, while one guy said he was hiding out in the bathroom and couldn’t wait any longer and had to get back to work. Whereas someone else said, “people relax, we all want everything right now, just enjoy the experience!” And the comments continue! Ironically, we are all still “waiting” for the news. So…. what was the news? As of the time this story was published, we still don’t know. The count-up continues on the Linkin Park website. OCMN will keep you posted and update you as soon as an announcement is made.

We have Howard Jones, ABC, and Haircut 100 touring North America, Squeeze and Boy George performing dates together, and the always incredible Lost 80s – and here in Southern California the same week! Wow! But first up for me were Howard Jones, ABC, and Haircut 100 in Los Angeles at the fairly intimate YouTube Theater. Although all three of these bands are iconic and have so many danceable hits, there was an extra buzz that had us excited about Haircut 100. The last time they toured in North America was in 1982! I know we don’t want to do that math as it ages us, but that was 42 years ago. Yes, it has taken 42 years for Haircut 100 to loop around back to the States! To say that we were giddy, well, that was an understatement! It was such an extraordinary occasion, and as I was standing outside the theater, looking at my phone (could have kicked myself), I noticed a group of people walking by. I casually looked up and watched them walking in, then my brain kicked in and I realized: It’s Boy George! I was staring at the back of his head; he was close, but not close enough to call out. Arghhh! If you know me, you know he is my idol! Luckily I will see him at the next show… Richard Blade (Mr. ‘80s himself) was on hand to emcee and introduce the bands; that alone had the crowd excited. In addition to his TWO, yes TWO official days in the City of Los Angeles, Richard Blade recently earned his star on the famous Walk of Fame for being “The” DJ of the ‘80s on KROQ. He made sure our cassettes were full of our favorite ‘80s music when we couldn’t afford to go to Music Plus or Tower Records to buy the UK imports! Once again, I was very excited about Haircut 100 (HC100)! Nick Heyward and his mates Les Nemes and Graham Jones started the band under several other names – Rugby and Moving England – before they settled on their final, and unusual, band name Haircut 100 in 1977. In addition to the three original members, HC100 of today includes Patrick Hunt and Blair Cunningham on drums, Phil Smith on sax, and Marc Fox handles percussion. Truly any three of these bands could have been the headliner; I don’t think the crowd would have been disappointed either way. I was personally quite happy with HC100 being the opener though because I couldn’t wait to watch Nick Heyward sing “Love Plus One” and “Fantastic Day.” He of course did, plus we got to enjoy “Baked Beans,” “Kingsize,” and “Triangles.” Heyward sounded so smooth, and he looked so happy – like he really wanted to be there. The band was in sync and there didn’t seem to be any technical sound issues, which is huge when there are three bands playing on one stage. The horns, the keys – it was reminiscent of the ‘80s in the clubs, a pop, soul, reggae, funk sound that made you feel happy and just want to dance. Seeing Heyward’s smile along with the music added such excitement, I just could not sit – it requires you to dance and feel a unity of joy and happiness with the whole theater. This is what they mean when they say music is “good for the soul.” The last song was another amazing track, “Favourite Shirts.” The band gave us a genuine thank you and a group bow before leaving the stage. The audience was really thrilled and enthusiastically danced along with the performance, seemingly feeling exactly as I did! Another tour next year please! Martin Fry of ABC was next to woo us, and he hit the stage looking suave as ever in a gold and black velvet tuxedo jacket, singing the fan favorite, “When Smokey Sings.” I saw ABC last year and it was a great show, but I enjoyed tonight’s performance much better. Fry’s voice was so smooth and strong, and he sang hit after hit. The band was fantastic and once again I didn’t notice any sound issues. It amazes me that these icons from our youth are in their 60s; I mean, I still feel like I’m 14 so I tend to forget their true age. But if their voices did crack or they couldn’t move so smoothly, I’d give them grace. I couldn’t do what they do night after night on the road or living the tour life. However, Fry did not need any of my grace tonight! Fry was also very charming with the crowd and showed us his great smile frequently. His band sounded better than ever as they took us through the hits “Show Me,” “Millionaire,” “Poison Arrow,” “All of My Heart,” and the closing song, “Be Near Me.” It was time for Howard Jones! First, Nick Beggs, formerly of Kajagoogoo, hit the stage, playing a powerful bass into “Pearl” as the stage is lit with a pink hue. YOUTUBE THEATER August 20, 2024 Out walked Howard Jones in a beautiful pink coat and the crowd cheered, excited once again as our third icon of the evening hits the stage. Beggs, truly the sound of Kajagoogoo, plays a unique instrument – the chapman stick, a bass instrument that is very difficult to play, bringing a massive bass sound to Jones’ songs. This is what makes him one of the best! The crowd didn’t sit all night and Jones made sure to keep them moving as he sang “New Song,” “Too Shy,” “Hide & Seek,” and after some wardrobe changes, he ended his set with “What is Love” and “Things.” The crowd was buzzing and asking for more, but sadly, the night was over – just like our youth. But seriously, all I can say is “Bravo, Bravo!” to the promoters because this was a smart bill! As I drove home, the songs played like earworms, reminiscent of my night, and my many happy ‘80s memories.

To cap it all off, they returned home for a grand finale – a show for their dedicated fans on the final weekend of the Orange County Fair. This event promised something for everyone, from the youngest kids to the most loyal longtime fans. The evening kicked off with LA’s own The Aggrolites, fronted by the dynamic Jessie Wagner. The band quickly set the tone with their signature “Dirty Reggae” sound, launching into funky tracks like “Funky Fire” and “Pop the Trunk.” Wagner shared stories of the band’s long-standing friendship with The Aquabats, reminiscing about their first cross-country tour together back in 2006. He also engaged the crowd in a lively sing-along during “Mr. Misery,” encouraging everyone to join in with “Hey hey”s and “ahh”s that echoed through the venue. One of the highlights of The Aggrolites’ set was their playful rendition of The Pyramids’ “Banana,” a song they performed on The Aquabats-associated children’s show, “Yo Gabba Gabba.” During the performance, a few members of The Aquabats – not-so-subtly disguised – joined in the fun by waving inflatable bananas and lifting kids onto their shoulders, adding to the joyous atmosphere. The set concluded with a superb cover of The Beatles’ “Don’t Let Me Down,” which was met with enthusiastic applause from the crowd still filtering in from the fair. The Aggrolites knew their role as the opening act, and they executed it perfectly, getting the crowd warmed up and ready for more. Next up were the Sweet and Tender Hooligans, a band named after a song by The Smiths. Billed as the ultimate tribute to The Smiths and Morrissey, they lived up to the hype. Lead singer Jose Maldonado (dubbed the Mexican Morrissey); his voice, mannerisms, and even his looks are eerily accurate. The band played a set that included classics like “This Charming Man,” “Heaven Knows I’m Miserable Now,” and “How Soon Is Now,” closing with the iconic “Bigmouth Strikes Again.” Fans of The Smiths and Morrissey were well-represented in the audience, and they showed their appreciation with raucous cheers and applause. Maldonado, unlike the artist he emulates, didn’t disappoint, delivering a performance that was as reliable as it was entertaining. As the anticipation built, the festive atmosphere grew more profound. Beach balls began bouncing through the crowd, as the venue filled up with fans, affectionately known as “Cadets.” The stage lights dimmed, and a video montage chronicling The Aquabats’ colorful history played on the large screen, setting the stage for the main event. The crowd erupted into chants of “Aquabats, Aquabats!” as the band members took their places on stage. The excitement reached a fever pitch as the giant graphic of their new album “Finally!” was projected on the screen, signaling the start of the show. The band kicked things off with “Shark Fighter,” a high-energy track that sent the crowd into a frenzy. Inflatable sharks were tossed around the audience, a hallmark of any Aquabats show, where inflatable objects of all kinds make regular appearances. Next up was the fan-favorite “Cat with 2 Heads!” which saw the first of many costumed characters take the stage, with two giant cats running around to the delight of the crowd. The lineup for the night was bolstered by some special guests, including former members and friends like Chainsaw, the Prince of Karate on guitar, Johnny Christmas of Reel Big Fish, along with old-school members Catboy on brass and Gorney on keytar and keyboards. The band’s core members – Eaglebones Falconhawk on guitar, Crash McLarson on bass, Ricky Fitness on drums, and Jimmy the Robot on sax – were all led by the ever-charismatic MC Bat Commander. Throughout the night, the band performed a mix of old favorites and new material. “Martian Girl!” had the crowd singing along to every word, while “Lovers of Loving Love!” saw inflatable hearts floating through the air. One of the high points of the show was the performance of “The Aquabats! Super Show! Theme Song,” which had the audience singing and dancing along. They also debuted new songs like “No Rewind!,” “Little Lady Amazing!,” and “Dr. Space Mummy!” – the latter featuring a towering Dr. Space Mummy character menacing the band onstage. As always, The Aquabats kept the energy high with songs that celebrated life’s simple joys. “Pizza Day!” was a perfect example, with inflatable pizza slices flying through the crowd, adding to the fun. A special moment came when Clive Farrington of When in Rome joined the band onstage, professing his love for The Aquabats before launching into a rendition of his hit “The Promise.” It was a nostalgic touch that added an extra layer of warmth to the evening. The band continued to pump up the excitement with classics like “Red Sweater!” and “Super Rad!” each delivered with the unbridled enthusiasm that has become their trademark. The night ended on a high note with “Pool Party!” a fitting finale that saw the stage filled with characters from the entire evening, including familiar faces from “Yo Gabba Gabba” like Brobee and Plex, a Yeti, Grimace, and a slew of kids dancing and singing along. It was a perfect end to a night that had something for everyone, young and old alike. The Aquabats delivered a show that was as joyful and exuberant as their music, leaving the crowd with memories to last a lifetime.

Instead, we will just rejoice that after a 15-year hiatus, Oasis is back together! Noel and Liam Gallagher just announced Oasis will reform for a reunion tour in 2025. “This is it, this is happening,” stated the band’s post. “The guns have fallen silent. The stars have aligned. The great wait is over. Come see. It will not be televised.” Slip inside the eye of your mind, Don’t you know you might find, A better place to play. “Don’t Look Back in Anger” | OASIS The guys announced 14 shows in the U.K. and Ireland next summer and that shows outside Europe will take place next year. Could that mean North America? The Manchester band formed in 1991 and became one of the biggest acts of the ‘90s thanks to mega hits “Wonderwall,” “Live Forever,” “Don’t Look Back in Anger,” “Champagne Supernova,” “Don’t Go Away,” and “Rock ‘N’ Roll Star.” They were selling out stadiums left and right, several of which they will return to with this tour. The known Oasis dates begin July 4th in Cardiff and run through August 17th in Dublin. The tour includes four nights each at Manchester’s Heaton Park and London’s Wembley Stadium, so they must be confident they will sell a few seats! We will keep you posted if they decide to venture to the States.

The endless summer of 2024 continued with the Kings of Leon coming to the Kia Forum. There was quite the crowd; eclectic was a good word to describe the concertgoers. All ages, and segments of society were represented and the who’s who of media and Hollywood elite could be seen walking the hallowed halls of the Forum. We were all there for an epic night of music with the amazing catalog that spans the life of its concertgoers; Kings of Leon were on everyone’s mind. The show opened with Greenwich, New York’s Phantogram. As the clock struck 8 p.m. on the dot, the lights dimmed, the crowd rushed in from concessions, and front and center were Sarah Barthel and Josh Carter. The duo was amped for this one; they opened with “Don’t Move,” followed by “Fall in Love.” With a cheer from the crowd, Barthel thanked Los Angeles for coming out. With her big black boots and wicked smile, Barthel kicked it up a notch and delivered on the next set, featuring “All a Mystery” and “Pedestal.” The keys kicked for “Run Run Blood” and “Mister Impossible.” As for their sound, it was electric. Josh Carter slayed on guitar for the Forum crowd. Carter reminded us of just how cool some of the older songs were, then delivered on “Happy Again,” “Answer,” “Black Out Days,” and before they closed, they thanked everyone for coming out and delivered a special thanks to KOL for having them along for this night of great music; then they closed with “When I’m Small,” which drew quite the ovation from the near-capacity crowd. As the lights came up, electricity was in the air, and the crowd filling the Forum was buzzing. I noticed the concertgoers who surrounded me – my mates for the rest of the night – were all telling each other stories about moments in their lives and how music from Kings of Leon were part of the personal soundtrack to their lives. It did not take long for the stage crew to get things ready; it seemed like the blink of an eye. Truthfully, hearing all those wonderful stories took my mind away from the normal break between bands. But when the lights came down again, and the silhouettes of the Followills were apparent, the crowd stood up and cheered on their sonic heroes. As the music began, front-man Caleb Followill stood behind the mic, holding his guitar in that regal stance of majestic splendor and off we went with “Ballerina Radio.” Kicking into a song off their current album, “Can We Please Have Fun,” the crowd sang along and knew every word of the song. Just like out of a movie, as the song ended, the roar of the crowd engulfed the arena. Followill thanked all for coming out and let us know we were going to be there for a minute and we would get new music and some familiar songs as well, and the band went off into “The Bucket.” The brothers and cousin were at the top of their game; Matthew on lead guitar was shredding, Jared was slapping his bass, Nathan on drums, and Caleb on guitar and delivering on vocals that were nothing short of jaw dropping. They ran off a set of hits, “Waste a Moment,” “On Call,” “Manhattan,” “Actual Daydream,” and “Razz.” I think the crowd got a kick out of the video element as lyrics appeared as if we were at a karaoke bar, and the crowd ate it up. Never have I been to a show where the crowd sang at the top of their lungs for three hours to each and every song at the high voltage level they did. From there, we went on a journey of music, new and not so new. The biggest cheers came from their uber-hit, “Sex on Fire.” The roar of the crowd mimicked a jet flyover from nearby LAX. “Revelry,” also got a jet flyover ovation. Caleb knew how to work the crowd. This clearly was not his first rodeo and said that this crowd was the best he’d ever performed in front of in Los Angeles, getting the response only a crowd of that size at the Forum could give – it was nearly deafening. Other highlights that captioned the moment in their musical mastery were “Pyro,” “Mustang,” “Milk,” “M Television,” “Back Down South,” and “Split Screen.” By then my seat neighbors were almost hypnotized by Matthew and his insanely cool jam sessions. Being true gentlemen from the South – Mount Juliet, Tennessee, to be specific – they delivered on a closing set that perfectly captured the night. “Find Me,” “The Bandit,” “Closer,” and “Seen” made the night transcendent in their delivery of each song. As KOL left the stage, the crowd cheered and cheered and cheered. It was so loud, I could barely hear myself think. As expected, those silhouettes re-appeared for an encore. “Rainbow Ball” hit the mark, so did “Knocked Up,” but to hear Caleb Followill sing “Use Somebody,” that was a moment in time nobody at the Forum will forget anytime soon. There were people in tears as they all sang along. That song was so emotional to fans, I think we all felt a connection to not only the band, but to everyone in attendance. There are good bands that come to SoCal, and then there are great bands. Then there are the bands we won’t stop talking about: Kings of Leon are the latter of that pantheon of greatness.

While many other music acts throughout time have failed to evolve or challenge themselves, Johnson has continually displayed an ability to adapt musically amongst several eclectic genres. Often difficult to pigeonhole or label, Johnson’s music has spanned everything from new wave to synthpop, post-punk to alt rock. I N F E C T E D “Infect me with your love: I’ve got too much energy to switch off my mind, But not enough to get myself organized – My heart is heavy–my head is confused; And my aching little soul–has started burning blue” – Infected | The The You need not look further than “Hanky Panky,” an album consisting of covers of Hank Williams’ songs which seemed to defy genres, including even rockabilly. For 45 years, Johnson has continually used his band, THE THE as an outlet to express his diverse music tastes. “Soul Mining” was originally released as a Johnson solo album, but is now generally regarded as the first THE THE release. You can hear the influence that this album, which went gold in the UK, would eventually have on fellow UK bands The Psychedelic Furs and Echo & the Bunnymen, and even the indie rock of the 2000s, such as The Strokes and The National. Now comes news that THE THE will be releasing their first full length studio album in nearly 25 years. “Ensoulment,” is set to release on September 6th, it will be the band’s first original non-soundtrack work since 2000’s “NakedSelf.” Although the band has faced many member changes throughout their long, storied career, fans should be delighted that Johnson returned to the studio with the longest standing lineup of James Eller on bass, DC Collard on keyboards, drummer Earl Harvin, and lead guitarist Barrie Cadogan. “Cognitive Dissident,” the opening track from “Ensoulment” pairs a funk-inspired bassline against a rocking beat, while “Linoleum Smooth to the Stocking Feet” gives an eerie, ominous tone against Johnson’s almost spoken word. “Down by the Frozen River” is highlighted by Collard’s piano set against Johnson’s unmistakable, gravelly tone. In addition to the new album, THE THE have also announced they will be doing a world tour that kicks off in North America starting in October. Their UK dates are not surprisingly nearly completely sold out, with several New Zealand and Australian dates selling out, not far behind. Their last date in the States will be their sole Southern California date, appearing at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on November 8th. Don’t miss out on this once in a lifetime opportunity to catch a piece of music history live.

For the uninitiated, this isn’t just any punk rock show. The Gimmes have carved out a unique niche in the music world as the ultimate cover band, bringing their irreverent, high-energy punk stylings to songs you never thought you’d hear in a mosh pit. Formed in the mid-‘90s as a side project by members of some of punk’s most notable bands – think NOFX, Lagwagon, and Foo Fighters – Me First and the Gimme Gimmes started as a joke. Luckily for us, it is a “joke” that has endured for nearly three decades, thanks to their undeniable talent and the sheer joy they bring to every performance. Their setlists are a wild ride through the last half-century of popular music, with a focus on songs you can’t help but sing along to, even if you’ve never moshed a day in your life. The Gimme Gimmes have always been about bringing people together, and their shows are a perfect example of how music can bridge generations. Whether it’s a punked-up version of John Denver’s “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” a thrashing take on Elton John’s “Rocket Man,” or the unforgettable sight of a crowd moshing to Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive,” these shows are as much about the audience as they are about the band. It’s not uncommon to see a multi-generational crowd at a Gimme Gimmes show, with parents and their kids both belting out the words to songs that have somehow, improbably, become punk anthems. August 30, 2024 Anaheim, California This tour is in support of their latest album, “Blow it​…​ at Madison’s Quinceañera!,” a title as cheeky as the band itself. As always, they’ve taken an eclectic mix of tracks, put their punk spin on them, and created something that’s both familiar and completely new. But don’t worry; they won’t just be playing the new stuff. With a catalog as deep and diverse as theirs, you can expect to hear a little bit of everything. But beyond the music, it’s the energy of a Gimme Gimmes show that really sets it apart. There’s a sense of camaraderie; an understanding that everyone is there to have a good time. The band’s playful banter and ridiculous stage antics – often involving flamboyant matching outfits – add to the party atmosphere, making it feel more like a rowdy family reunion than a concert. When the band launches into a punked-up version of a song everyone knows by heart, the whole room lights up, with the crowd often taking over the vocals as the band thrashes away. And then there’s the pit. If you’ve never seen a mosh pit to a disco classic, you’re in for a treat. There’s something both surreal and exhilarating about watching a group of die-hard punk fans moshing to “I Will Survive” or “I Believe I Can Fly.” It’s chaotic, it’s cathartic, and it’s a whole lot of fun. Me First and the Gimme Gimmes have been doing this for a long time, but they’ve never lost their sense of humor or their love for what they do. Their shows are a reminder that music doesn’t have to be serious to be meaningful. Sometimes, it’s just about having a good time, singing your heart out, and maybe throwing a few elbows in the pit. So, whether you’re a lifelong punk fan or just someone who loves a good sing-along, come out and see the best damn cover bwand inthe land! You have a fee chances, on August 27th you can catch them at The Glass House in Pomona. Then on the 28th take the I-5 South to the Observatory – North Park. Then, the Grand Poobah of shows at the House of Blues Anaheim on Friday, August 30th. Get ready for a night of nostalgia, laughter, and one of the most unique punk shows you’ll ever see. “And this next song is a cover!” TO FOLLOW SID 240825 | TRACI TURNER | EDITOR [...]Read more...\n\nUncategorizedA Conversation with KROQ’s MEGAN HOLIDAY August 18, 2024 by Jimmy Alvarez In our ongoing Industry Report series, we turn back to the legends of radio broadcasting, The World Famous KROQ. In our last visit to this iconic radio station, we covered where they’ve been and their re-trajectory. Program Director Kevin Weatherly is redefining their sound, and he has put together the voices that deliver to their listeners. With a solid morning show (Klein / Ally) and a daytime lineup featuring Nicole Alvarez (middays) and Kevan Kenney (evenings), we turn to their afternoon host, Megan Holiday. Holiday has a story that is very much off the beaten path and is beyond inspiring. To tell this story, we had to go back in time, to the beginning, to understand where we are and where we’re headed on this sonic journey. Holiday was born on October 14th in the Year of the Tiger. She is the middle child of three siblings – an older brother and a younger one. She lived a very normal childhood in Rancho Cucamonga, California; that is, until she didn’t. All origin stories have triggers that make our subject who they are or were. Holiday had a fate which would play into a solemn journey into an abyss. The kind of journey we all know far too well – directly, or indirectly – by way of someone we know who has been on that path. For Holiday, her trigger event took place when she was just 11 years old. As she recalled, it was a normal day, just like any other. She was out riding her bike with her 7-year-old brother. In the blink of an eye, her life changed and so did her brother’s. They were kids just being kids, then a neighbor who was under the influence and behind the wheel of a vehicle hit her brother, ran him over, and just kept on driving. The event was traumatic for each sibling. For her brother, it left him hospitalized for three months recovering from several broken bones – he eventually lost one of his legs to amputation. It’s taken a lifetime, but her brother has learned to deal with that event and life has gone on from that horrible accident. But for Megan Holiday, that moment triggered her mind into an emotional quagmire that saw her turn to alcohol at a very young age to deal with the vivid images of what happened that fateful day. She said, “I remember feeling lost. I wanted to be strong, but I just lost my way.” Like most people going through trials, she was able to function in her day-to-day, but like most people feeling the grip of addiction, she was chasing a form of salvation that would never materialize – at least not at the bottom of a bottle. Then, as it does, the disease moved on to a deeper spiral that involved a variety of drugs. What I found remarkable is that Holiday has taken ownership of her past and wanted to talk about where she had been and what happened. She said, “By talking about it openly, anyone who hears my story doesn’t feel so alone. I want people who are struggling to know there’s a light at the end of that tunnel.” Let’s flashback to her days in high school at St. Lucy’s in Glendora. There she said the grips of addiction had really taken root. As she went through college at Dominican University in Marin County, she was able to get by, but she was never really free of that beast; it was a constant struggle. She eventually landed an internship in San Diego at 91X; an internship she truly loved. She grew to embrace the idea of working in radio in some capacity thanks to a friend by the name of Menace – more on him later. It wasn’t until the end of her term there that she really thought she could make a living out of it. She was a natural behind the mic, but that addiction demon was still part of her soul. No matter how positive life could be, addiction still held on. She relocated to Northern California to Bay Area juggernaut Live 105 where she rejoined a radio broadcast team. There she worked with that previously mentioned cat named Menace. Megan Holiday | Menace Mornings on Live 105 The run there was solid, but short. Holiday conceded it was a short stay as a result of the mess she created. Not anything anyone else did at the station, but what she did to get let go from her dream gig. That’s the part of her story that really impressed me. She said, “To get better, you have to accept responsibility for when you fuck up, and that’s what I did there.” Megan Holiday with Garbage at Last Year’s Acoustic Christmas I have chosen not to go into detail on what happened; just know Holiday laid down her cards and told me the sordid details of her past. I felt the sincerity in her voice when she told me all the ways she let everyone down, including herself. I am sure we can all read between the lines on some of the thing that she regrets as it is a common story how addicts let their family, friends, and employers down. Holiday lost it all. Family and friends for a bit. Her job. Her place to live. Most importantly, she lost a piece of her soul. That’s what addiction does. Like most stories along these lines, you could already guess this wasn’t rock bottom. But with all origin stories, rock bottom finally came, and when it did, it was the death of someone close to her. It was then she had a choice to make. Did she want to stay on the path she was on, or did she want to try a different life? Luckily, she didn’t burn through all her relationships and still had someone in her corner. That friend was there to help her get into and finish rehab, and take the next step towards finding the sun in that perpetual nightmare where darkness resides. As Holiday got clean, she never thought she would ever be able to get back into radio. But one day the Fates came knocking in the form of another familiar name to us in SoCal: Nicole Alvarez. She knew Holiday through mutual friends and knew just how good she was on the air. Alvarez told her she would be taking time off for maternity leave and management would be looking for someone to cover her shift. Alvarez suggested she reach out to the station to inquire about the opportunity. Nicole Alvarez Middays at The World Famous KROQ I would like to say the rest is history, but that would be shorting us of the redemption part of this story. Holiday did as Alvarez suggested and reached out to set up a meeting between Lisa Worden and Kevin Weatherly. They were the management staff at KROQ back in the day that would give Holiday a thumbs up or down. At that meeting, Holiday laid out her cards and told them what happened at Live105. She took responsibility, convincingly and with sincerity pleaded her case that she loved radio broadcasting and would work very hard for them and not blow the opportunity to be back on the airwaves. Holiday believed that it was just good practice to be honest about her past, but because of that past, she did not think she would be back on the air soon. Fortunately, shortly thereafter she got the word that KROQ would take a chance on her. She found herself filling in for Alvarez and other time slots to give her a chance to make it or break it, so-to-speak. Now we can say the rest is history, or at least the beginning of a new one for Megan Holiday. Since then, Holiday has made it her mission to talk about addiction and make sure people have outlets to find help. As for this survivor, she is living her best life working afternoons at KROQ. You can also hear her in NoCal back at Live105. Between you and I, just know that same infectious smile you hear in her voice on air, yeah… she is that same person off air. She said life has been a wave of ups and downs, and those lows almost did her in. She went on to say her brother is doing better, but “it’s day-to-day for both of us.” With a big smile, she said her brother plays on a hockey team as a goalie and he’s living life. The radiance in her face when she talked about her brother was one of joy and pride. In the end, there is something all high-profile DJs have in common in their stories: Music saved their life in one way or another. For Holiday, music is life. With a different outlook nowadays, she wants people to know they are never alone or on an island. She is, and will continue to be, an advocate for people suffering from addiction and mental health issues. That all being said, the measurement of being successful in this business is defined by many variables. Despite all the ways to gauge success, there is only one matrix that stands above all, the one money can’t buy. It’s the respect you have earned from your colleagues. I asked around and had no shortage of people that wanted to chime in. But the one response that stood out and best fit the frame of this article came from broadcasting legend, Matt Pinfield. “Megan is an incredible talent and beautiful human being. She is a shining example of the light, full of passion for life, and her story is so inspirational. She was there for me when I was getting sober, and has been an integral part of my recovery-celebrating the triumph of overcoming the obstacles and always selflessly giving of herself to help others find the path.” Now to the fun stuff. I asked Holiday about music that is important to her. She smiled and said, “I can’t tell you how much ‘White Pony,’ by Deftones means to me.” In fact, the band is so beloved by her, she flew up to the Bay Area to see them play with System of a Down last weekend. There’s a very good chance you’ll see her at Dia de los Deftones in San Diego. I asked about new music KROQ is playing today that she likes. She said she hopes to see the band bby blow up. She suggested we keep an eye on them: “I love their song ‘kinky.’ It just makes me smile!” When asked what group or song is her favorite of all time, she answered quickly, “The Beatles, ‘In My Life.” Those lyrics mean everything to me.” I asked Holiday what her favorite, most surreal moment has been working at KROQ. She smiled and said, “That’s easy. Meeting Gwen Stefani. I mean, she’s a successful woman that I listened to as a kid. And she is down-to-earth and still loves to come to places like KROQ and pay us a visit. I felt like a teenager standing next to her taking photos in the studio.” Also very noteworthy, Holiday has started a non-profit called Life of the Party. Developed with the intent of helping to reduce opioid overdoses, their mission statement reads: “Our mission is to reduce opioid overdoses, protect vulnerable individuals, and build a supportive network embracing harm reduction principles. At events like music festivals and community gatherings, we aim to empower people with the knowledge and tools to recognize an overdose and administer naloxone. By normalizing naloxone use, we believe we can save lives. Together, we can create environments where lives are valued, health is prioritized, and communities unite to save lives. You too can make a difference.” With a smile that can light up the New York skyline and a laugh that can brighten anyone’s day, Megan Holiday is living proof that bad things happen to good people. But, if they believe in themselves, work hard, and try to help their fellow brothers and sisters whenever possible, then redemption through good deeds is very possible. No matter what challenges appear before her, the future looks very bright for Megan Holiday. Jimmy Alvarez and Megan Holiday at KROQ Studio You can hear Holiday weekdays on the World Famous KROQ from 2 – 6 p.m. Also make sure to check out Life of the Party.

Since the band announced the return of founding member Tom DeLonge two years ago, the San Diego trio’s popularity has only seemed to skyrocket. Their first show back onstage together was a surprise performance at last year’s Coachella. They co-headlined both nights of 2023’s mega When We Were Young Festival in Las Vegas with Green Day as their final shows of the year. blink-182 kicked off this year touring across the globe and headlining Lollapalooza in Chicago. They also played SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles on the 182nd day of the year as luck would have it, and bassist/lead singer Mark Hoppus announced it was their largest headlining show ever – in front of 51,000 screaming fans. Shortly after DeLonge’s return in late 2022, it was revealed that the group had gotten together to start writing and recording for a new album. The result, “One More Time,” was released in October 2023, marking blink-182’s first full studio album in 12 years with the classic lineup of Hoppus, DeLonge, and drummer Travis Barker. The album was an immediate success landing at number one on the Billboard charts and receiving critical acclaim. Far from the immature potty humor on their earliest albums (don’t worry, the potty jokes are still there for their live performances), the album’s themes and sound rang closer to their 2003 untitled album. Songs like “You Don’t Know What You’ve Got” and the album’s title track even openly discussed Hoppus’s battle with cancer and remission. Riding this hot wave of fame and still well into their current tour, the band just announced they were releasing a sequel of sorts entitled, “One More Time….Part 2.” The album will be a deluxe version of “One More Time” featuring the original 19 songs and eight brand new tracks. My guess is these were additional tracks recorded during the “One More Time” sessions which did not ultimately make the cut of the album. If they carry that same energy and sound as “One More Time,” this should be a proper fantastic release and I think most fans would agree any chance to hear additional songs from that time will be welcome. “One More Time….Part 2” will be released September 6th, available in “Blue Balls” and “Red Rocket” (I told you the jokes were still there) colored vinyl. Check out the first single, “All in My Head.” TO FOLLOW SID 240823 | TRACI TURNER | EDITOR [...]Read more...\n\nUncategorizedLive at Pacific Amphitheatre August 21, 2024 Review by Todd Markel The term “legend” is often overused, but in the realm of rock ‘n’ roll, Alice Cooper unquestionably earns the title. For decades, Cooper has captivated millions, once terrifying parents and thrilling fans with his theatrical, groundbreaking performances. My own introduction to his music was typical of many fans – an older sibling introduced me to Cooper with the album “Killer” and its numerous classic songs, and soon I, along with countless others, embraced the anthem of “School’s Out” and its rebellious spirit. Needless to say, when this show was announced, my eyes lit up with excitement. On a balmy summer evening in Costa Mesa, amidst the vibrant chaos of the Orange County Fair – complete with rides, games, and all the nostalgic trimmings – a different kind of spectacle awaited those heading to the Pacific Amphitheatre. There is no need for an opening act when your headliner is Alice Cooper. The stage was shrouded in a black curtain with ominous figures in plague masks ringing bells, as if tolling our impending doom. As the curtain fell, a banner reading “Alice Cooper Banned in California! Trial set: for deeds against humanity” lit up, flanked by grinning demon characters. Cooper made his grand entrance through the center of the banner, impeccably dressed in black, wearing a top hat, and waving a sword around, as they kicked things off with a condensed version of “Lock Me Up” before swiftly moving into the high-energy “Welcome to the Show.” Backing Cooper was a stellar lineup of musicians: Nita Strauss, Ryan Roxie, and Tommy Henriksen on guitars, Chuck Garric on bass, and Glen Sobel on drums. Each brought their own style and flair, with Strauss, in particular being a fan favorite, delivering electrifying solos that kept the audience riveted. Cooper’s command of the stage was undeniable as he led the band through classics like “No More Mr. Nice Guy” and “I’m Eighteen,” the latter of which resonated a little differently with each listener, regardless of their age. Cooper utilized an old crutch as a prop, swinging it overhead and playing a little air guitar with it. We’re just four songs in and this show is already “electrifying.” The band is tight and talented with obvious respect and reverence for their boss. The night continued with timeless hits such as “Under My Wheels” and “Billion Dollar Babies,” alongside deeper cuts like “Snakebite” and “Lost in America.” The theatrics escalated with “Welcome to My Nightmare” which preceded the song that became the big hit for that album, “Cold Ethyl” with its lighthearted look at necrophilia. As the band played, Cooper danced and interacted with a limp Ethyl dummy. Next, the stage came alive with a video of animated skeletons and dramatic red lighting for “Go to Hell,” where Cooper told us that “You Can Go To Hell” while he has a skirmish with a demoness, a role now performed by his daughter Calico, adding to the night’s theatrics. A highlight was “Feed My Frankenstein,” during which a towering 12-foot Frankenstein monster appeared on stage to menace the band. After which the lights dimmed and a vintage video clip of Vincent Price played, adding an extra touch of nostalgic horror. Strauss then appeared on top of a large platform for a blistering guitar solo before coming down to trade licks with her fellow guitarists and then rejoining the band for a grand finale. Cooper reappeared on stage, all wrapped up in an old-fashioned straight jacket with one arm free, allowing him to sing into a microphone for the “Ballad of Dwight Fry.” This song cumulates in the very dramatic and theatrical execution of Cooper by guillotine, aided by the previous demoness who then proudly holds his severed head up for all to see. A large staircase platform decked out with American flags was wheeled out front and since it’s election season, Alice Cooper lets us know that he wants to be “Elected” with his hit song of the name which asks the question “Why Not Me?” It was another huge sing-along that cumulated in the band coming to the front of the stage to address to the crowd. At its triumphant conclusion, a smiling Cooper held up his finger and asked the crowd, “One more?” to which they reply in deafening affirmation. When a school bell rang, I think we all knew what song was next. Cooper, now dressed in a white top hat and tails, waved his swagger stick back and forth as smoke-filled bubbles fell everywhere for the epic “School’s Out” finale. The audience joyously sang along to “No more pencils, no more books.” Large balloons were tossed into the crowd, adding to the festive atmosphere. As a playful nod to Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick in the Wall,” they sang a little bit of “We Don’t Need No Education.” Cooper finally spoke to us to introduce his excellent band and his daughter to the crowd, playfully adding, “I don’t know where she gets it.” After egging the crowd on a little, they finished with a reprise of “School’s Out” to a climactic ending and thunderous applause from the full house. Cooper left us with “a final wish from all the band and myself, that all your nightmares be horrific.” What a wonderful show this was. I believe all who attended would be talking about it for days to come. Alice Cooper is 76 years old and still one of the best!

There is not a bad seat in the house and its modern, intimate design, coupled with superb acoustics, set the stage for a night where nostalgia meets raw energy.On this particular evening, the legendary Jane’s Addiction headlined a show that was as much about celebrating the past as it was about embracing the present. But before they took the stage, two acts paved the way with fantastic performances that deserve attention. The night kicked off with Crawlers, an English rock band that’s been making waves. As the first opener, they had the unenviable task of warming up a crowd that was likely more familiar with the headliners. However, from the moment they stepped onto the stage, it was clear that Crawlers weren’t just filler—they were a band who deserved to share that stage with two icons of alternative music.Energetic and interactive, they brought a sense of urgency to their performance that quickly won over the audience. Their sound—a blend of gritty guitar riffs, driving basslines, and a dynamic vocal presence—felt both fresh and familiar, echoing the best elements of classic British rock while carving out their own identity. Crawlers’ set was tight, focused, and unpretentious. They played like they had something to prove, and by the end of their time on stage, they had undoubtedly gained new fans, myself included. It’s not often that an opening act makes such an impression, but Crawlers managed to do just that, setting a high bar for the rest of the evening. Next up was Love and Rockets, a band whose pedigree in the gothic and alternative rock scenes is unimpeachable. Formed in 1985 by former members of Bauhaus, Love and Rockets brought a different kind of energy to the stage. The original lineup of Daniel Ash, David J, and Kevin Haskins has lost none of its chemistry over the years, and their performance at the YouTube Theater was a masterclass in how to maintain relevance while staying true to one’s roots. From the opening notes of “The Light,” it was clear that Love and Rockets were in their element. Ash’s vocals were haunting and precise, as if plucked straight from the band’s seminal recordings. The interplay between the moody, atmospheric lighting and the band’s shadowy soundscapes created an immersive experience that transported the audience back to the late ’80s and early ’90s, when darkwave was at its peak. Tracks like “Kundalini Express” and “Haunted When the Minutes Drag” were highlights, showcasing the band’s ability to blend melody with a brooding intensity that few bands can match. The setlist was a well-curated mix of hits and deep cuts, ensuring that both longtime fans and newer listeners were kept engaged. “So Alive,” arguably the band’s biggest hit, was met with rapturous applause, but it was the deeper tracks, like “An American Dream” and “No New Tale to Tell,” that really resonated with the crowd. By the time they closed with “Mirror People,” the audience was fully under their spell. Love and Rockets proved themselves to be the perfect precursor to Jane’s Addiction, setting a mood that was equal parts melancholic and electrifying. Finally, it was time for the main event. Jane’s Addiction, a band that needs no introduction, took the stage to a wave of anticipation that had been building throughout the night. The original lineup of Perry Farrell, Dave Navarro, Stephen Perkins, and Eric Avery reunited for this tour and from the first note of “Kettle Whistle,” it was evident that the magic was still there. Jane’s Addiction has always been more than just a band; they’re a cultural institution, a group whose influence on alternative rock cannot be overstated. And on this night, they lived up to their legend and the crowd was loud and there for it. Perry Farrell, ever the charismatic front-man, was in great form. His voice, still as distinctive as ever, cut through the mix with a clarity that belied the years. Farrell’s connection with the audience was palpable—he shared stories, encouraged love and peace, and even spoke about his son, bringing a personal touch to the performance that added depth to the spectacle. The setlist was a journey through the band’s storied career, with each song receiving a hero’s welcome from the crowd. “Whores” and “Pigs in Zen” were delivered with a ferocity that harkened back to the band’s early days, while “Summertime Rolls” and “Jane Says” provided a more reflective counterpoint, allowing the audience to catch their breath amidst the sonic onslaught. The band’s musicianship was as tight as ever, with Navarro’s guitar work standing out in particular—his solos were blistering, yet never self-indulgent, serving the songs rather than overshadowing them. “Three Days” was a centerpiece of the set, a sprawling epic that showcased the band’s ability to blend the visceral with the ethereal. The performance was both powerful and nuanced, a testament to the chemistry between the band members. As the song reached its climax, it was clear Jane’s Addiction remains a vital force in music. The closing stretch included favorites, with “Stop!” and “Been Caught Stealing” bringing the house down. These tracks, perhaps more than any others, encapsulate what Jane’s Addiction is all about—up tempo, raw, and endlessly catchy. The band left the stage to lingering applause, having delivered a performance that was as exhilarating as it was unforgettable. Jane’s Addiction, with the help of Crawlers and Love and Rockets, had crafted an evening that was both a celebration of their past and a powerful statement of their continued relevance. The YouTube Theater, with its combination of intimacy and grandeur, proved to be the perfect venue for such a momentous occasion. For those lucky enough to be in attendance, it was a night that reminded them why live music is such an irreplaceable experience—because when it’s done right, it’s nothing short of transcendent.

Presented on the sand at the Hurley Stage, Sublime and Makua Rothman were prepped to rock surf fans from all over the globe. Lining up before the gates opened, fans knew getting in early gave them a choice spot on the front railing for this sold-out show. Makua Rothman’s band took the stage first and after a short musical intro, Rothman ran out to join them and exclaimed, “Let’s get this started, Huntington Beach!” Starting with “Sticks and Stones,” he rolled into the next song saying, “I wrote this for my mom and dad.” Rothman’s father is the legendary North Shore, big wave surfer Eddie Rothman – also known as the leader of Da Hui, one of the most notorious surf gangs to exist. With a rough upbringing, the song’s meaning is fairly obvious and reflects where Makua gets his toughness from. Three songs into his set, Rothman proclaimed, “I surfed my heat today,” and that’s when I realized that not only is he a musician, but he is actually a professional surfer and Hawaiian big wave pioneer – just like his father. Makua Rothman turned out to be a perfect opener and after a quick 25-minute set, he thanked the crowd and made way for Sublime. Anticipation was in the air and as the sun was setting over the Huntington Beach Pier, it was overwhelming to look at the stage, complete with the old school Sublime artwork – Skunk Records stickers and “Sublime Long Beach” stencils on the amps and gear brought back memories of the legendary Bradley Nowell. The famous Sublime sun logo – created by Opie Ortiz, a tattoo artist and front-man for the Long Beach Dub All Stars – was shown on Bud Gaugh’s bass drum, letting people know we have the core of the original Sublime. Gaugh was joined by the other original, Eric Wilson on bass guitar, and Bradley’s Nowell’s son Jakob on vocals. Jakob refers to Gaugh and Wilson as his uncles, and for good reason. This lineup also features Tre Pangborn on guitar, which leaves Jakob free to run around with just the mic on some songs, or have a two guitar sound on other songs. Jakob was playing his dad’s original guitar, truly making this a memorable and emotional show and reflecting the family connection onstage. During the intro, the big screen behind the stage rolled videos of Sublime from the 1990s and the beloved Lou Dog that made many appearances in the history of the band. For further reference, look for Lou Dog in two songs: “I got a dalmatian” in “What I Got” and “It smelled like Lou Dog in the van” in “Garden Grove.” Appearing shirtless with board shorts and some stylish Merge4 socks, Jakob Nowell broke into “Garden Grove” as the first song in the set and the crowd started dancing and waving their hands in the air. The party was off and running! They rolled through the set with “Wrong Way,” “Doin’ Time,” “Badfish,” “Romeo,” and fan favorite, “What I Got.” Everyone knew all of the words and helped sing along, especially on the chorus: “Love is, What I Got, I said remember that!” That song has stood the test of time and touched a nerve that is a much needed theme, especially in difficult times. Next up was “Date Rape,” the first radio hit that took Sublime to the mainstream through KROQ. A few minutes later it was time for the first original song from Sublime in over 30 years, “Feel Like That.” The story of that song goes all the way back to 1996 when Sublime was on tour and stopped in on Willie Nelson’s studio to record what was at first just an impromptu jam track with Bradley Nowell making up lyrics. The line, “Oh let me tell you what I feel like that” stuck, and they added vocals from Nowell along with Scott Woodruff from the SoCal band, Stick Figure and Jakob Nowell. You can hear the similarities in Bradley and Jakob’s voices, which really tie in the theme that it is truly a family thing happening here. After “Same in the End,” Sublime closed out the show with what is probably their most well-known and loved song, “Santeria.” Fans once again proved they knew every word and had no problem helping Jakob sing along. It was an incredible day for music and surfing with the US Open of Surfing 2024, Makua Rothman, and Sublime!
