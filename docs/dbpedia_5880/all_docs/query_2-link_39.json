        "text": "Legendary West Coast punk rockers MxPx are still kicking, literally, with their new music video for “When We Broke Through.” Fresh off their headlining Furnace Fest set, the band plays their hopeful and euphoric track against a white background for the brand-new video.\n\nWith classic pop-punk guitar tones and undeniably catchy choruses, you can’t help but sing along with Mike Herrera as he vocalizes, “Against the odds we made it work/Through the struggles and the pain/This life, it ain’t so bad /When you pull it from the frame.”\n\nCheck out the new music video for “When We Broke Through” below.\n\nThe music video follows the release of their August 2023 album Find A Way Home, featuring stand-out tracks “Not Today,” “Stay Up All Night,” and “Cautious Optimistic.”\n\nIn an Instagram post on album release day, Herrera shared a note reading, “It’s finally here. In a world where things just seem to be more confusing, we wrote Find A Way Home to come together. ​​And I hope that’s what you get from this record. The best things are done when you sacrifice, and it’s not easy. Nothing is easy. I want there to be an easy button more than anything, but it doesn’t exist. So I work at it. I make mistakes. We make mistakes. But then we lean on each other. That’s the foundation of this record, and I hope you feel it when you listen to it.”\n\nYou can catch the band serving up classic punk rock at When We Were Young Fest October 21-22 in Las Vegas. Check out the full list of their upcoming dates below, and grab tickets here.\n\nTour Dates:"
