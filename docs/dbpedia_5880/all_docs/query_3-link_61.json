        "text": "Beyond the well-known breakout artists already stepping out nationally are a host of emerging, under-the-radar West Michigan bands and solo acts. Here’s 15 of them to check out in words and music.\n\nWest Michigan’s music scene has become a bottomless beer glass of tasty talent spanning every imaginable genre.\n\nAs such, there’s an ever-evolving and emerging set of bands and artists simmering just below the surface: adored by exuberant fans while producing compelling music, but falling outside the mainstream conversation.\n\nSo, Local Spins – in what we anticipate is the first of many such features – asked its writers and a few musicians to target buzz-worthy acts deserving more attention.\n\nCheck out their picks, then chime in with your own under-the-radar gems worthy of toasting in the comments below.\n\nWEST MICHIGAN ACTS TO WATCH (FALL 2015)\n\nTHE ARTIST: hi-ker\n\nTHE MUSIC: Indie electro-pop\n\nWHY IT STANDS OUT: The sprightly young band – once a quartet, now a trio – has ascended the local scene in the past year, moving quickly from basement and living room shows to stages such as Calvin College’s Covenant Fine Arts Center, where they recently opened for Sylvan Esso, and Kalamazoo’s Audiotree Festival. One of their songs, the delicate, yearning “Pulses” from last year’s self-released, self-titled EP, sounds like it belongs in a John Hughes movie.\n\nUPCOMING SHOWS: Dec. 4 at Park Theatre in Holland with Ghost Heart\n\nMORE INFO: Bandcamp – https://hi-ker.bandcamp.com/\n\nFacebook – https://www.facebook.com/hikerband?_rdr=p\n\nSoundcloud – https://soundcloud.com/hi-ker\n\nMUSIC SAMPLE: https://soundcloud.com/hi-ker\n\nTHE ARTIST: Desmond Jones\n\nTHE MUSIC: Rock/Funk/Jazz Fusion\n\nWHY IT STANDS OUT: Having recently relocated to Grand Rapids from East Lansing, Desmond Jones is poised to bring its saxophone-laced mixture of funk, jazz fusion and rock ’n’ roll to West Michigan. The quintet’s infectious, feel-good sound and indulgent instrumental jams could easily be featured on many summer playlists and will grace a handful of regional stages this fall.\n\nUPCOMING SHOWS: Friday at Itty Bitty Bar in Holland, Oct. 19 at Tip Top Deluxe Bar & Grill in Grand Rapids, Oct. 23 at Michigan State University (UAB Event), Oct. 31 at The Stache inside The Intersection in Grand Rapids with Genetics\n\nMORE INFO: Facebook – https://www.facebook.com/DezzmondJones?fref=ts\n\nMUSIC SAMPLE: Soundcloud – https://soundcloud.com/desmondjonesband\n\nLocal Spins on WYCE – https://localspins.com/desmond-jones-making-splash-and-stirring-fun-with-genre-melding-jam-band-charm/\n\nTHE ARTIST: Hollywood Makeout\n\nTHE MUSIC: Garage/Surf Rock\n\nWHY IT STANDS OUT: Grand Rapids’ Hollywood Makeout packs an upbeat and energetic punch with its unique sound. Taking cues from the lighter side of alternative rock, with similarities to bands such as Vampire Weekend, the four-piece utilizes simple-sounding, yet perfectly placed and catchy guitar leads, in addition to fluid bass lines and a strong percussive backbone. Erin Lenau’s vibrant lead vocals tie all components together for what is an overall bright and intriguing sound.\n\nMORE INFO: Facebook – https://www.facebook.com/HollywoodMakeout?fref=ts\n\nMUSIC SAMPLE: Soundcloud – https://soundcloud.com/hollywoodmakeout\n\nTHE ARTIST: The Cardboard Swords\n\nTHE MUSIC: Sad Pop/Indie\n\nWHY IT STANDS OUT: With softer instrumentation and raw passionate lyrics, The Cardboard Swords are more than just easy listening. After listening to these guys, it almost feels as if you know them personally through their honest and almost conversational lyrics and music. The four-piece creates verbose, sincere-yet-biting songs likely to remind regional listeners of erstwhile Grand Rapids act Radiator Hospital or late ’90s/early 2000s indie-rock from Chicago (think Joan of Arc). The band has spent the year touring steadily throughout the Midwest to supplement its growing Grand Rapids following.\n\nUPCOMING SHOWS: Oct. 22 at Hunter’s Ale House in Mt. Pleasant; Oct. 25 at The Pyramid Scheme in Grand Rapids with Alex G and Title Fight\n\nMORE INFO: Facebook – https://www.facebook.com/TheCardboardSwords\n\nTwitter – https://twitter.com/cardboardswordz\n\niTunes – https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-cardboard-swords/id804126956\n\nBandcamp – http://thecardboardswords.bandcamp.com\n\nReverbNation – https://www.reverbnation.com/thecardboardswords\n\nMUSIC SAMPLE: YouTube – https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2B61DWofAE\n\nTHE ARTIST: Maybe Next Time\n\nTHE MUSIC: Pop Punk/Alternative\n\nWHY IT STANDS OUT: If you’re a fan of new or old pop punk, Maybe Next Time is the band to listen to. Hints of New Found Glory, Hit The Lights and Blink-182 stem from each member’s personal influences for a sound that captures the true essence of pop punk.\n\nMORE INFO: Facebook – www.facebook.com/maybenexttimemi\n\niTunes – https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/maybe-next-time/id384836461\n\nYouTube – http://www.youtube.com/user/Maybenexttimeband\n\nMUSIC SAMPLE: YouTube – https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Afe-eoJFL2o\n\nTHE ARTIST: Shane Tripp\n\nTHE MUSIC: Indie rock\n\nWHY IT STANDS OUT: In my humble experience, there seems to be a big chunk of music lovers in Grand Rapids who gravitate toward tunes with a bit of a ’90s-rock flavor to them. Local musician Shane Tripp and his merry band tap into the best parts of that decade’s sonic output to fuse grunge, Britpop and indie rock with a rootsy, songwriter vibe for a wholly original sound. Tripp’s debut album, “Silk Challenge,” is set for a vinyl release later this fall.\n\nUPCOMING SHOWS: Oct. 24 at Founders with Heaters, Moonwalks and Coffin Problem\n\nMORE INFO: Bandcamp – shanetripp.bandcamp.com\n\nMUSIC SAMPLE: YouTube – youtube.com/watch?v=S07ABILtU1Y\n\nTHE ARTIST: B. Sykes\n\nTHE MUSIC: Hip Hop\n\nWHY IT STANDS OUT: B. Sykes is charming because he’s talking to you, combining smooth, old-school flow with heady instrumentals that just scream with freshness in 2015. And he owns it, in an original way.\n\nMORE INFO: Twitter – @BelvedereSykes\n\nMUSIC SAMPLE: Soundcloud – https://soundcloud.com/belvederesykes/5-by-myself-prod-by-sir-manley?in=belvederesykes/sets/young-black-jesus-2015\n\nTHE ARTIST: Michael Herrera\n\nTHE MUSIC: Electronic dance music\n\nWHY IT STANDS OUT: The EDM genre is huge, encapsulating a plethora of subgenres. With so many artists creating music within the genre, you get a lot of generics. Michael Herrera is not that. Even as a lesser-known local producer, Michael Herrera sports an innovatively futuristic sound, from his more relaxing, downtempo tunes, to his massive tracks that are impossible not to dance to.\n\nMORE INFO: Facebook – https://www.facebook.com/michaelherreramusic Twitter – @MikeHerrera97\n\nMUSIC SAMPLE: Soundcloud – https://soundcloud.com/michaelherreramusic/silhouette\n\nTHE ARTIST: Lacroix Winget\n\nTHE MUSIC: Melancholy acoustic singer-songwriter gone electric (aka, Elliott Smith’s long-lost sister started a band)\n\nWHY IT STANDS OUT: Wearing her influences on her sleeve, LaCroix’s evolved her solo-project into an electric three piece, providing support for her voice that is simultaneously fragile and powerful. Listeners are pulled into a cocoon of introspection with guitar arrangements weaving sonic layers around them.\n\nUPCOMING SHOWS: Nov. 4 at The Pyramid Scheme opening for Tiger Jaw with Oliver Houston. (https://www.facebook.com/events/169655993366541/)\n\nMORE INFO: Facebook – https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lacroix-Winget/366133190066420\n\nMUSIC SAMPLE: Bandcamp – http://lacroixwinget.bandcamp.com/track/ki\n\nTHE ARTIST: Bong Mountain\n\nTHE MUSIC: Emotive punk that evokes last night’s after-parties.\n\nWHY IT STANDS OUT: An impressive debut EP sported twinkling guitars, restless vocals, and more emotional depth than their name might suggest. The rambunctious four piece tackled lost friendships, the pitfalls of living in the city, and what it means to try to grow up.\n\nUPCOMING SHOWS: Friday at Soggy Bottom Bar in Flint, with Lawnmower (album-release), Deer Widow and Hawk & Son; 8 p.m. Saturday at The Death House in Grand Rapids with Lawnmower, The Shortlife and Lloyd Braun\n\nMORE INFO: Facebook – https://www.facebook.com/bongmountain\n\nMUSIC SAMPLE: Bandcamp – https://bngmtn.bandcamp.com/track/26-caroline\n\nTHE ARTIST: Jared Sjöblom\n\nTHE MUSIC: Dance-folk\n\nWHY IT STANDS OUT: Whitehall’s Jared Sjoblom has a voice that pulls you in and forces your attention. His voice mixed with his variations of live shows (singer/songwriter folk to dance) offers a truly unique sound that is hard to come by.\n\nUPCOMING SHOWS: October 31 at Tip Top Deluxe Bar & Grill.\n\nMORE INFO: Facebook – https://www.facebook.com/sjoblommusic\n\nMUSIC SAMPLE: Soundcloud – https://soundcloud.com/sjoblommusic\n\nTHE ARTIST: The Fever Haze\n\nTHE MUSIC: Rock ’n’ roll\n\nWHY IT STANDS OUT: Genuine songs with a great rock edge. The Holland-area band has good underground following but remains relatively unknown in the Grand Rapids scene and should be in the spotlight more than they are.\n\nUPCOMING SHOWS: October 21 at The Pyramid Scheme\n\nMORE INFO: Facebook – https://www.facebook.com/thefeverhaze?fref=ts\n\nMUSIC SAMPLE: Bandcamp – https://thefeverhaze.bandcamp.com\n\nTHE ARTIST: J.Rob\n\nTHE MUSIC: Golden-era hip hop\n\nWHY IT STANDS OUT: J.Rob tells a story in each of his songs. He does a fantastic job at touching on social issues and doing it in a way that the masses can relate to. He is also one of the best live performers this side of the state. His mic control and rhyme articulation is admired by the hip hop community.\n\nUPCOMING SHOWS: Oct. 22 at Midwest Fest with Lady Ace Boogie (Hunter’s Ale House, 4855 E Bluegrass Rd, Mount Pleasant)\n\nMORE INFO: JRobsCampaign.com – http://www.jrobscampaign.com/\n\nMUSIC SAMPLE: YouTube – www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEEAZnX529k\n\nTHE ARTIST: Yolonda Yogi Lavender\n\nTHE MUSIC: Neo Soul\n\nWHY IT STANDS OUT: When Kalamazoo’s Yolonda gets on the stage she will take your breath away, not only because her voice is amazing, but her presence will melt your heart. She flawlessly draws the crowd in with her soft but strong melodies and her powerful heartfelt lyrics.\n\nMORE INFO: ReverbNation – https://www.reverbnation.com/yolondaSOULARTISTRY\n\nMUSIC SAMPLE: ReverbNation – https://www.reverbnation.com/yolondaSOULARTISTRY\n\nTHE ARTIST: Brother Adams\n\nTHE MUSIC: Aggressive folk-rock\n\nWHY IT STANDS OUT: The unique combination of acoustic and electric instrumentation bringsthe idea of folk-rock to a new, almost experimental level in Holland-bred Brother Adams. The raw, Modest Mouse-esque rock ‘n’ roll vocals add even more urgency to the trio’s sound, urging the audience to scream the lyrics right along. That being said, a Brother Adams live performance is one not to be missed: These guys love to pull the audience into the expressive passion they pour out on every stage they step onto. Their newest release, “Blood,” is a fluid\n\nexpression of stories and emotions, and after you see them live, you’ll be hooked.\n\nUPCOMING SHOWS: Friday at New Holland Brewing in Holland with Rick Chyme; Nov. 14 at Founders Brewing in Grand Rapids with The Hooten Hallers and S.S. Web\n\nMORE INFO: Bandcamp – https://brotheradams.bandcamp.com/\n\nFacebook – https://www.facebook.com/ BrotherAdams\n\nMUSIC SAMPLES: Soundcloud – https://soundcloud.com/brotheradams\n\nYouTube – https://youtu.be/Q96A9ValD7g\n\nCompiled by Troy Reimink, Ricky Olmos, Taylor Mansen, Ethan Dombrowski, Jordan McNaughton, Anna Sink, Nolan Krebs (of Heaters), Linda Tellis (Lady Ace Boogie) and RJ Nordlund (Nordlund & The Nomad Assembly).\n\nCopyright 2015, Spins on Music LLC"
