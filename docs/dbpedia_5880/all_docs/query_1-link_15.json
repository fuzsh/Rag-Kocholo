        "text": "MxPx frontman Mike Herrera had tentatively scheduled the phone interview for Sunday afternoon, after the football games were over.\n\nIt had to wait until Monday. The Bremerton, Wash., native was just too steamed over the Seattle Seahawks' overtime loss to Cleveland.\n\nTypically, playing high-energy, amp-shredding rock is a great way to blow off some of that steam. For the next couple of weeks, however, Herrera's taking the time to do things a little differently.\n\n\"It's just something I like to do, something that keeps me evened out,\" Herrera said of playing acoustic music. \"I really love punk, but doing something different makes me enjoy MxPx that much more.\"\n\nHerrera's long-in-the-works acoustic side project, Tumbledown, is on the road for the first time. The group will play its second show Friday at the Blackwater Cafe. The bill also features Kepi Ghoulie, Simmerhorn and members of the Lucky Devils.\n\nEven after the release of MxPx's \"Secret Weapon,\" Herrera was able to find a gap in the band's schedule.\n\n\"Mx is doing a lot of fly-outs and a lot of weekend festivals, really not your normal shows,\" he said. \"We have this weekend and the next weekend off; we have this two-week gap. I was like, 'Perfect.'\n\n\"It's one of those things where I'd thought about it and thought about it,\" Herrera added. \"You really just have to make a call.\"\n\nAs Herrera has progressed as a songwriter, after nearly 15 years of fronting MxPx, he began to open up to a different style of writing, digesting inspiration from personal favorites such as Elvis Costello and Tom Petty. He's been gearing up with a few randomly placed solo acoustic gigs in and around his hometown.\n\n\"I started writing these sort of off-punk songs,\" he said. \"Back in 1999, I started with the basics; a lot of my firsts were just super Hank Williams-type stuff.\n\n\"I don't really know what to call Tumbledown. I don't really sing country. I just sing how I sing. There's been a couple of people that are fans of MxPx that are like, 'Man, I just can't hang with the country guitars.' \"\n\nCall it country if you absolutely must, but there isn't much in Tumbledown that matches up with most country music played on radio. What Herrera has forged is an up-tempo cocktail of acoustic rock that sounds like a reincarnated Hank Williams jamming with a fuzz-free Wilco.\n\nHerrera will be flanked by members of fellow Bremerton rock outfit the Rocky Point All Stars, with Jack Parker on guitar and Marshall and Harley Trotland on upright bass and drums, respectively.\n\nHerrera has aspirations to put together a Tumbledown album, but for now, the band is earning its stripes on the road. And, in case you were wondering, you might catch an acoustic MxPx tune or two.\n\n\"I just chose some stuff that I like to do that maybe (MxPx) doesn't like to do as much, ones that I felt sound good acoustically and have different vibes,\" Herrera said. \"I'll do 'Chick Magnet' if people want to hear it.\"\n\nContact Aaron Davis at features@recordnet.com.\n\nMike Herrera's Tumbledown When: 7 p.m. Friday Where: Blackwater Cafe, 912 N. Yosemite St. Admission: $12 Information: (209) 943-6938; www.timgardeapresents.com\n\nConcert preview"
