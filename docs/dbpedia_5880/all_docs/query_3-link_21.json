        "text": "By Rose Sopko\n\nMxPx loves what they do, and they have for the past 11 years. MxPx is made up of Mike Herrera (vocals, bass), Tom Wisniewski (guitar) and Yuri Ruley (drums). It’s hard to believe these guys have been playing their infectious punk rock for so long, and they still feel the same love for the music that they did over a decade ago when they were just starting out.\n\nMxPx, from Bremerton, W.A., near Seattle, got together in 1992 while in high school. Before they were MxPx, they were known as Magnified Plaid. Now, after putting out eight records and a greatest hits compilation, they have released their first new record in three years in September 2003, titled “Before Everything ‘ After.”\n\nMxPx is on a United States tour with Sugarcult and Simple Plan, and prior to their show at Avalon on Saturday, Feb. 7, The News had the opportunity to sit down with guitarist Tom Wisniewski and hear what he had to say about the new record, the band’s rumored “sell out” and his openness about his faith.\n\nThe Northeastern News: How is this current tour going?\n\nTom Wisniewski: The tour is going really well. The shows have been packed, and everyone’s been having a really good time. It’s been a blast so far.\n\nThe News: Do you have any pre-show rituals? Is there anything you like to do to get pumped before a show?\n\nWisniewski: I play guitar and sing. I do a lot of stretching out. I’ll plug in the iPod and sing along to that. But it’s mostly just playing guitar and stretching.\n\nThe News: The band hasn’t put out a new record in three years. What have you guys been up to since the last record (“The Ever Passing Moment” 2000)?\n\nWisniewski: We’ve been doing a lot of touring and a lot of practicing. We’ve been working on this record for awhile, and we’ve spent a lot of time writing. It was worth it because the record came out really well and we are all happy with the end result.\n\nThe News: Why the extended gap between this record and the last?\n\nWisniewski: It wasn’t a conscious effort. It’s not like we got together and said, ‘Let’s wait three years to put out another record.’ We spent time finding a producer, and we had to wait for schedules to open up. It was mostly a lot of scheduling problems.\n\nThe News: How has the band’s music evolved since the last record?\n\nWisniewski: There’s more diversity on this record. There’s a lot more dynamics, and a lot more up, down and everything in between, volume and tempo-wise.\n\nThe News: What is your favorite song on the new record?\n\nWisniewski: It’s definitely a toss-up between ‘Play it Loud’ and ‘Don’t Walk Away.’\n\nThe News: What is the significance of the title of this record?\n\nWisniewski: It’s pretty much talking about us. In the beginning we had [the record] ‘Teenage Politics,’ but we’re not teenagers anymore. It’s about the last 10 to 11 years in our lives. The beginning is our punk rock roots. The after is where we could be going in the future. The everything is pretty much everything in between.\n\nThe News: What kind of things inspire your songwriting, especially on this new record?\n\nWisniewski: Mike [Herrera] does pretty much all of the writing, but most inspiration comes from life in general, experiences and funny stories. Our songs come from a lot of stuff we talk about. We’ll be talking about something, and someone will say, ‘Hey, wouldn’t it be really funny if we had a song about this … ?’\n\nThe News: Who are some of your musical influences?\n\nWisniewski: Most definitely the Descendants, Elvis Costello, the Who and, of course, The Clash. I’m also influenced by a lot of ’70s rock bands.\n\nThe News: How do you feel about some people calling you sellouts?\n\nWisniewski: If we were ever to sell out, it doesn’t really matter. We would have done it a long time ago. It’s not like we did a jingle [for the commercial]. We were performing on stage, playing one of our songs. It was a lot of fun. If it was a sell-out, I am still waiting for the cash.\n\nThe News: MxPx has always been open about the fact that you are all Christians, and sometime refers to that fact in songs. Has this helped or hindered the band in any way?\n\nWisniewski: People are always going to have these pre-conceived notions of who we are or what we do. We are just being human, so we really don’t care if people are opposed to this. It hasn’t helped or hindered us in any way that I can clearly see.\n\nMxPx 20 things you never knew 1.
