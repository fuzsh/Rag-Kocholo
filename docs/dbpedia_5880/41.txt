Mike Herrera

Most people know Mike Herrera as the tattooed and pierced punk stalwart who’s spent the last two decades pounding out one tuneful but tough album after another as the frontman for MxPx. Full-fledged fans who have followed Herrera’s twists and turns may also be aware of the eclectic singer’s exploits with alt-country outfit Tumbledown and the more pop-tinged territory of his sporadic side work with a band called Arthur. But even if all of the above are old hat to you, the secret identity that might still take you by surprise is that of Mike Herrera the acoustic troubadour.

It’s not an unprecedented phenomenon for a punk-rock firebrand to take a solo singer/songwriter turn, but this phase in Herrera’s musical evolution occurs at a particularly crucial point in his career. This year marks the 20th anniversary of MxPx, and the trio has been out on tour in celebration of that milestone.

Herrera happens to write most of his songs on acoustic guitar to begin with, even the MxPx tunes, so it’s only natural for him to explore additional outlets for his unrelenting creativity.

Herrera put together a DIY disc called Live From The Basement for fans of his solo shows, but the title is to be taken literally. “It’s just a live recording of me, performing my songs in my basement,” he explains. “Not an official release, but something for fans to easily adjust to the broken down versions of some of their favorite songs.” Although he is putting energy into his solo work, Herrera continues to storm stages all over the world with MxPx All Stars.
