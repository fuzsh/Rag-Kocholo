        "text": "NFB is at the leading edge of developments in documentary cinema. Quebec filmmakers Michel Brault, Marcel Carrière, Gilles Groulx and Pierre Perrault make important contributions to the Direct Cinema movement with such iconic films as Les raquetteurs (Gilles Groulx and Michel Brault, 1958), whose aesthetic is considered a precursor to the Direct Cinema style. The film establishes a new way of representing reality and foreshadows the approach taken by the NFB’s French filmmaking team, which will be deployed in the 1960s, in the heat of an emerging Quebec cinema and assertion of identity. Iconic films are made during this period, including Pour la suite du monde (Of Whales, the Moon and Men) by Pierre Perrault and Michel Brault, La Lutte (Wrestling) by Michel Brault, Marcel Carrière, Claude Fournier and Claude Jutra, Golden Gloves by Gilles Groulx, Bûcherons de la Manouane by Arthur Lamothe and À Saint-Henri le cinq septembre (September Five at Saint-Henri), a group project by the NFB’s French team led by Hubert Aquin, as well as the fiction film Le chat dans le sac (The Cat in the Bag) by Gilles Groulx, which uses Direct Cinema techniques.\n\nNFB produces Universe, a short documentary by Roman Kroitor and Colin Low, which explains the workings of the universe and, a few years later, is included in the American astronaut training program.\n\nThe film was also a key source for Kubrick’s vision of space in 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nNFB’s French Program is created. Up until then, French productions had been developed and managed within the English production unit. This confirms the institution’s commitment to establishing a distinct identity for francophone cinema at the NFB. The same year, the NFB releases its first French-language fiction feature, Le chat dans le sac (The Cat in the Bag) by Gilles Groulx.\n\nNFB takes immersive storytelling to a new level with its landmark multi-screen experience In the Labyrinth, shown at Montreal’s Expo 67, which in turn leads to the birth of the IMAX® format and a string of giant-screen firsts. The experimental film by Roman Kroitor, Colin Low and Hugh O’Connor draws more than 1.3 million people.\n\nStudio D is created within the English Program. It’s the first studio dedicated to films made by and about women, from which would emerge such landmark works as Not a Love Story: A Film About Pornography by Bonnie Sherr Klein (1981) and If You Love This Planet by Terre Nash (1982). The studio would earn a total of three Oscars®, for I’ll Find a Way (1977), If You Love This Planet and Flamenco at 5:15 (1983).\n\nOctober: NFB launches its CineRobotheque, a centre for cutting-edge media technology, comprising a videotheque and a movie theatre. It contains the first large audiovisual server in Canada, capable of responding to some 50 requests simultaneously from both inside and outside the centre. Kodak Canada awards it the Prix Livernois, underscoring the NFB’s innovative leadership in the field of imaging. The CineRobotheque serves as the model for the creation of the NFB Mediatheque in Toronto in 2002, establishing the NFB’s position very early in the dawning era of digital film distribution.\n\nNFB launches NFB.ca | ONF.ca, its acclaimed online screening room, the first fully bilingual and bicultural audiovisual site, in January. Later that year, the NFB launches the first in a family of popular mobile apps, the NFB Films app for iPhone, which was named one of the top apps of 2009 by iTunes Canada and hailed by CNET as “ingenious” and “pure iPhone gold.”\n\nCreated for the Canada Pavilion at Expo Shanghai, Glimpses, by Jean-François Pouliot, depicts 24 hours in the life of an imagined city–a composite that draws on all Canadian cities. This short film is projected onto a semi-circular screen 21 metres wide and 5 metres high, with a curvature of about 150 degrees.\n\nSarah Polley directs Stories We Tell at the NFB. The film breathes new life into the doc genre and becomes one of the biggest critical and commercial successes of all time in Canadian documentary, earning 11 awards and honours (as of October 2020).\n\nExpo 67 Live, by Karine Lanoie-Brien, is an innovative experience on giant screens, consisting entirely of archival treasures, made to mark the 375th anniversary of Montreal and the 50th anniversary of Expo 67. More than 18,000 people attend presentations of this work at the Place des Arts Esplanade in Montreal in September.\n\nBetween April and July, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of views on NFB.ca | ONF.ca reached a record high of nearly 1.5 million, an increase of more than 95% compared to the same period the previous year. In August, the NFB launches The Curve, a collection of projects by over 40 creators and filmmakers exploring the pandemic, accessible online and produced by all of its studios across Canada.\n\nIn September, the interactive installation TRACES is unveiled at Expo 2020 in Dubai. Created by the architectural collective KANVA, with art director and multimedia designer Étienne Paquette, it offers a poetic vision of an uncertain future, and a reflection on our present. The work also can be found in an experiential web version created by Akufen, The Future in Mind.\n\nIn 2022, six years after making its initial commitment, the NFB continues to meet its gender-parity goals, both for the number of productions directed by women and for production budgets allocated to women. It has also met or exceeded its goals in most creative positions (screenwriting, editing and music composition), with a significant improvement in cinematography.\n\nFrom February to April, the Haus der Kulturen der Welt in Berlin is presenting “The Children Have to Hear Another Story – Alanis Obomsawin,” an exhibition tracing Obomsawin’s artistic activism over the last five decades. In the spring, the Hot Docs festival is presenting the world premiere of Ms. Obomsawin’s new film, Bill Reid Remembers, her 54th film in a legendary career spanning 55 years."
