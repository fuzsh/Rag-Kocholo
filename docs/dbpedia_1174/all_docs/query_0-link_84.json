        "text": "Uncanny breaches, flimsy borders Jan Švankmajer’s conscious and unconscious worlds The portrayal of a character’s subjective, ‘inner ’ experience onscreen is an enduring challenge for the filmmaker. Many techniques for conveying fantasies or dreams, such as blurring the frame’s edges, cross-dissolves and bleached colour, have been used- from soap operas to advertising- to such an extent that they could be considered by audiences as hackneyed or clichéd. Yet the notion that cinema cannot deal with complex psychological states such as dream, memory, the imagination and the unconscious seems to be tied up not only with clichéd imagery, but also with the derision of film as a passive visual and aural experience that leaves little to the imagination. For instance, George Bluestone insists that the rendition of mental states cannot be as adequately represented by film as by language: “If the film has difficulty presenting streams of consciousness, it has even more difficulty presenting st...\n\nIt is a commonplace to describe animation as cartoon or moving pictures due to its association with its unique technique of production since the early time of motion picture. The evolution entails a transition from moving ‘illustrated object’ at the instance of Kineograph and Zeotrope to moving ‘photographic object’ as the invention of more sophisticated motion picture camera. The terminology of animation is problematic in its own interpretation and representation as an art form. The advancement and proliferation of the way of media being produced and consumed has revolved around content, appearance and style of animation presently as compare to its ascendant. At present, animation is emerging in various content, different artistic style and multiple techniques at the wake of globalization and freedom in media production and distribution. This paper attempts to discuss the evolution, transition and to reinterpret animation to the currently technological development. Animation as a creative field employing visual, sounds and kinetics could not survive without being associated with the technology that being used to produce it. With digital technological convergence and advancement, it is difficult to define ‘animation’ as a medium of representation particularly in the context of formalist/realist dichotomy. The paper conclude that, on the one hand, animation is indeed a formalist advocate while offering creativity and artistic expression based on immense human intervention; on the other hand, animation is a realist advocate whilst attempting to re-present reality by regenerating and simulating moving entity.\n\nThis essay has two projects. The first is intrinsic to the very question of what constitutes legitimate scholarly inquiry in the study of film and of animation, marking out something ostensibly especially contentious in and for the study of the latter: theory. Proceeding from two related queries – Why theory? And why animation theory? – the paper offers responses based in and on my own theory-driven and theory-focused work.1 The second project constitutes a reply to the cognitivists, or more particularly, those scholars who propound and promote a cognitive theory of film and especially of animation, notably, those who have wielded cognitivism as a weapon of total destruction against my work. Given the nature of the paper, this reply is of a general and in any case partial character. Let me pause to say: I ordinarily do not respond to criticism of my work. But given where these criticisms have been published and their purport, I felt I have had to make an exception to my rule. Theory...\n\nThe general goal of my research is to find out what is questioned whenever an animated film is made by an author who chooses to have maximum control over the device automatisms. I am trying to understand in what ways that specific kind of film relates with Cinema and the History of Art as a whole and, more specifically, how its filmic discourse is built within cinematic codes,\n\nTheories of spectatorship and cinema are nothing new. In fact, they abound. On the other hand, theories of spectatorship and animation are still rare. Rarer still are theories that implicate animation and cinema, including in the area of spectatorship. For us, beyond as well as between theories of cinema spectatorship that attribute a pure passivity to the spectator and those that grant him a pure mastery, and beyond as well as between those that present themselves as purely text based and those that present themselves as purely context based, lies something, something missing from consideration that calls for acknowledgement, something integral to cinema spectatorship as it is to cinema ‘as such’, as it is to film spectatorship and to film ‘as such ’ – animation, film and media studies ’ “blind spot”. In accord with my larger project to bring to the fore the crucial nature of animation for the thinking of not only all forms but all aspects of cinema, of film, of film ‘as such’, thi...\n\nThis paper is a reeection on Animation: its technical, visual and semiotic characteristics, with the objective of comprehensively understanding of its aesthetic possibilities in comparison to live-action cinema. It analyzes some historical issues, but focuses mainly on technical aspects (the drawing , Stop Motion and 3D processes), of the aura, of its visual and connota-tive representation, of the ction, of the virtuality and consistency of its images, reaching an overview of how these images are created. More emphasis is placed on the diierences than to the similarities between these two forms of creating moving images, with greater deepening in terms of questions animation, but having as reference live-action Cinema, due to its privileged position in the Audiovisual art form. Those analyses are based on the work of several theorists, among them Walter Benjamin, Jacques Aumont, Edgar Morin, and to assist in their understanding, several animation and live-action movies are cited as examples. This work is part of a PhD in Multimedia at the Faculty of Fine Arts of Lisbon University."
