        "text": "From the date of this article’s publication, 80 days remain until cinemas in the UK (hopefully) reopen – and it’s been a long time coming. Our collective cinematic dry spell has been sustained via the substitute tonics of discs, streams and TV screens, but nothing comes close to the enveloping darkness of your favourite movie theatre.\n\nSitting in the dark with strangers is a communal experience that no platform streaming to your living room can provide. Don’t listen to the endless opinion pieces from doomsayers declaring that the big screen experience is over. Most of them haven’t watched a film in the cinema with paying audiences for years.
