        "text": "Introduction\n\nDisney and Pixar studios produce some of the most popular animated films. Pixar was established in 1986, with its first feature-length film, Toy Story, released in 1995 (Pixar, 2019). Disney acquired Pixar in 2006, and films produced by both studios tend to perform strongly, generating hundreds of millions of dollars. With its market value estimated to be around $165 billion in March 2019, the Disney Corporation is considered one of the most valuable media companies (Disney Market Cap, 2019). Although the Disney Corporation creates content that transcends children's media, Disney and Pixar Animation Studios' movies dominate the market including inside theaters and at home (Giroux & Pollock, 2010). Even as Disney acquires more adult content like the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Disney continues to carefully craft its image as family-friendly and the maker of childhood dreams and fantasies. Critics of Disney have noted that most animated films reinforce harmful notions about gender norms, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation (Cheu, 2013; Lugo-Lugo & Bloodsworth-Lugo, 2009; Towbin et al., 2013). More recently, Disney has begun to tell more inclusive stories featuring protagonists that challenge gender stereotypes (e.g., Frozen) and/or feature people of color (e.g., Coco or Moana). Yet, it is unclear if Disney's move toward more inclusive portrayals include disability. This project seeks to fill this gap by examining the portrayals of disability in recent animated feature films produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios or Pixar Animation Studios.\n\nPeople with disabilities represent the largest minority group within the United States and worldwide (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2017; United Nations, n.d.). Like other marginalized groups, people with disabilities experience stigma and discrimination including higher rates of victimization and lower rates of employment (Green et al., 2005). Children and adolescents with disabilities are often bullied, report worse mental health, and have more absenteeism (Baams, Talmage, & Russell, 2017; Blake et al., 2012; Carter & Spencer, 2006; Lindsay & McPherson, 2012). Moreover, children and adolescents with mental, intellectual, or learning disabilities are at increased risk of victimization including abuse and neglect from guardians (Cappadocia, Weiss, & Pepler, 2012; Mishna, 2003; Reiter & Lapidot-Lefler, 2007; Sullivan, 2009; Turner et al., 2011). Like other axes of inequality, ableism is deeply rooted in American society and represented in popular culture (Campbell, 2008; Green & Barnartt, 2016; Goodley, 2013; Shandra, 2018), yet children's media hold the potential to positively shape children's perceptions and attitudes about people with disabilities.\n\nChildren's media are important agents of socialization, through which children's emotional, social, and cognitive development is influenced. Watching films can be an avenue through which people are exposed to experiences different than their own, can explore their feelings regarding a situation, and can broaden their personal perspectives (Tenzek and Nickels, 2017). Other research indicates films can be used to help develop empathy and compassion for others (Walker, 2014). Furthermore, among children and adolescents with disabilities, seeing positive representations of disability can enhance self-esteem and minimize internalized stigma (Dill-Shackleford et al., 2017). Given the opportunity that children's film presents, it is important to consider how disability is presented through this medium. Therefore, the objective of this research is to examine whether portrayals of illness and disability in recent animated feature films produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios or Pixar Animation Studios rely on stereotypical and traditional depictions of disability or more progressive portrayals where characters with disability are well-rounded and disability is ordinary (Clogston, 1994).\n\nChildren's Media as an Agent of Socialization\n\nChildren's animated media is an important agent of socialization, and Disney films in particular carry a high level of popularity, with many children watching Disney animated films repeatedly. Disney's role as an agent of socialization is so pervasive that some suggest they have at least as much power as schools and families in role socialization and passing on values and ideals (de Leeuw & van der Laan, 2018). Although Disney is often criticized for portrayals of gender norms, beauty standards, and love narratives (among others), there is also the potential for these films to have a positive impact on child development. For instance, scholars have suggested that Disney films could foster honesty and openness, promote multiculturalism, and impact prosocial behaviors such as cooperatively completing a task (de Leeuw & van der Laan, 2018).\n\nA great deal is learned about others and about complex life events through film. Dill-Shackleford et al. (2017) discuss how youth learn about themselves and others through media content. Through media, we come to learn associations that are prevalent based on group membership – what others expect, what they believe, and what assumptions are made based on group status. For this reason, it becomes important to pay close attention to how social groups are portrayed; marginalization and stereotypical presentations become quite problematic because these representations are often routine and then further normalized. Because \"stereotypical differences are differences that matter and are also deemed by others to be undesirable,\" stereotypical representations of disability perpetuate disability stigma and contribute to discrimination toward people with disabilities (Green et al, 2005, p. 197). Media portrayals can impact attitudes, feelings, thoughts, and behaviors (Dill-Shackleford et al., 2017), influencing both oneself as a member of a marginalized group and also in an outward manner.\n\nAlthough the focus tends to be on critique and stereotype reinforcement, scholars are also suggesting that media portrayals can be an important site of positive learning, as films can help raise awareness and challenge and expand personal viewpoints. Watching movies is commonly experienced as a leisure activity, which allows for the opportunity to experience something perhaps differently than one does in real life, without responsibilities or consequences, while also maintaining emotional connection (Tenzek & Nickels, 2017). For example, Tenzek and Nickels (2017) suggest that films offer the opportunity to broach taboo subjects such as death in a positive manner, due to the fact that challenging events can be encountered with lower rates of anxiety or distress. Furthermore, Dill-Shackleford et al. (2017) suggest that the inclusion of counter stereotypes could help reduce prejudice, limit the impact of stereotype threats, and increase self-esteem.\n\nWhile several studies have explored portrayals of race, gender, and age in Disney films, less consideration has been given to portrayals of disability. Notable exceptions have examined disability representations in specific films that call attention to a heavy reliance on negative stereotypes in animated Disney films. For example, Norden (2013) examined disability representations in Hunchback of Notre Dame and notes that the portrayal of Quasi is \"rooted in an exceptionally long-standing disability-related stereotype: the 'Sweet Innocent,' a figure that embodies the deep-seated belief that [people with disabilities] must rely on mainstream society for everything\" (p. 169). Similarly, Schwartz et al. (2013) explored depictions of intellectual disability in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Cinderella, and Beauty and the Beast. Focusing on the characters of Dopey, Gus, and Le Fou, Schwartz et al. (2013) found strikingly consistent negative portrayals, where characters with intellectual disabilities were laughed at and othered. These previous investigations into disability representations in Disney films highlight the predominance of stereotypical portrayals of characters with disabilities; however, there have been glimpses of more progressive portrayals of disability such as Pixar's Finding Nemo (Millet, 2004). Given that disability in Disney animated films has been historically problematic with an emphasis on characters with disabilities being othered or jeered, it is our objective to systematically examine whether contemporary representations continue to rely on stereotypical portrayals of people with disabilities.\n\nCultural and Media Representations of Disability\n\nAccording to Garland-Thomson (2002), \"disability is a broad term within which cluster ideological categories as varied as sick, deformed, crazy, ugly, old, maimed, afflicted, mad, abnormal, or debilitated—all of which disadvantaged people by devaluing bodies that do not conform to cultural standards\" (p. 5). Garland-Thomson (2002) describes this as the disability/ability system, which privileges certain bodily traits over others. Deviations from culturally produced norms regarding bodily form and function are stigmatized, and those with disabilities are punished. As part of the disability/ability system, cultural representations of disability serve to legitimate \"unequal distribution of resources, status, and power within a biased social and architectural environment\" (Garland-Thomson, 2002, p. 5).\n\nCultural images and media representations reflect unequal power and social relations among advantaged and disadvantaged groups (Pescosolido et al., 1997). For example, a hallmark of social oppression is \"symbolic annihilation\" or the stereotyping, devaluing, and absence of oppressed groups in media (Gerbner & Gross, 1976; Pescosolido et al., 1997). People with disabilities, similar to other marginalized groups, are typically underrepresented in films and television and when present are often negatively stereotyped (Barnes & Mercer, 2001). The consequences of symbolic annihilation can be discerned in the stories of people with disabilities and their reactions to media representations. For example, Phillips (1990) collected oral narratives from Americans with disabilities and revealed that many informants felt that the media presented people with disabilities as \"damaged goods\" who need to overcome obstacles. More recent work by Zhang and Haller (2013) underscores that people with disabilities feel as though that mass media commonly frames people with disabilities as \"supercrips, disadvantaged, or ill victims\" (p. 329).\n\nSimilarly, previous research has examined media representations of disability and key patterns have emerged in how disability is framed. Early work by Clogston (1994) categorized media portrayals of disability as traditional (e.g., people with disabilities are abnormal or malfunctioning) and progressive (e.g., people with disabilities are limited by societal factors such as attitudes and inaccessible environments). Under the umbrella of traditional portrayals, Clogston (1994) identified three models of disability: (1) medical model; (2) supercrip model; (3) social pathology model. The medical model emphasizes that disability is the result of disease or injury. Under this model, those with disabilities are expected to seek out medical interventions to cure themselves of their disability (Gilson & Depoy, 2000). An underlying assumption in the medical model is that people with disabilities—particularly those who cannot be cured—are deficient and should be pitied. The supercrip model highlights extraordinary abilities, and celebrates people with disabilities who \"overcome\" their disability and live a normal life despite their disability (Clogston, 1994; Haller, 2000). The social pathology model portrays people with disabilities as being dependent on society or caretakers (Clogston, 1994; Haller, 2000). Traditional representations of disability reinforce cultural binaries related to disability (i.e., disability/ability system), inform idealized bodily standards (i.e., cultural standards of beauty) (Garland-Thomson, 2002; Gray, 2009), and perpetuate stereotypical depictions of characters with disabilities.\n\nAccording to Barnes and Mercer (2001), the most common cultural stereotypes used to represent people with disability in the media include \"pitiable and pathetic, as an object of violence, as sinister and evil, as atmosphere or curio, as 'super-cripple,' as an object of ridicule, as their own worst and only enemy, as a burden\" (p. 519). These negative stereotypes are part of traditional representations and reinforce the medical, social pathology, and supercrip models. For example, the medical model assumes that disability is a personal tragedy and that those with disabilities should be pitied because they are deficient or dysfunctional in some way (Barnes & Mercer, 2001; Gilson & Depoy, 2000; Hayes & Black, 2003). Portrayals of disability where the person with disability is subjected to abuse (i.e., object of violence), presented as a \"freak\" or exotic (i.e., curio), or the butt of a joke (i.e., an object of ridicule) typically use storylines where the person with disability is excluded or isolated (i.e., othered). These may take the form of all three traditional models, but the underlying message is clear: having a disability is deviant and people with disabilities are misfortunate. Yet, other stereotypes do not convey pity, but serve as a warning. In the case of sinister and evil, disability is used as a signal to the audience that a character is not to be trusted. This is particularly true of mental disabilities, where characters with mental disabilities are portrayed as violent or unpredictable (Klin & Lemish, 2008).\n\nAlthough stereotypical depictions of \"supercripples\" are often inspirational stories with some positive aspects related to having a disability, scholars have criticized these portrayals and note that the supercripple narrative often creates \"false expectations and sets unattainable goals\" for people with disabilities (Zhang & Haller, 2013, p. 330). The supercrip model perpetuates disability stigma by reinforcing that disability is deviant and (any) achievement by a person with a disability is rare and heroic (Haller & Zhang, 2014). A widespread example of the supercrip model—particularly in children and young adult media, is superheros. Embedded in these narratives are cultural notions related to disability and deviance (i.e., what we consider ordinary and extraordinary bodies and minds) and the need to overcome deficiencies. For example, Grue (2015) writes that \"a mainstay in superhero fiction is the notion of heroism paired with extraordinary ability as a compensation for trauma, injury or even impairment\" (p. 215).\n\nCounter to traditional representations, progressive representations of disability tend to present disability as a result of societal factors such as ableist policies and attitudes (Clogston, 1994; Gilson & Depoy, 2000). Clogston (1994) identified two progressive frames used by the media including the minority/civil rights model and cultural pluralism model. In the minority/civil rights model, people with disabilities are shown as having \"legitimate political grievances…and demanding change\" (p. 47). The cultural pluralism model emphasizes that people with disabilities are multifaceted and portrayals tend to be well-rounded and similar to people without disabilities (Gray, 2009; Haller, 2000). Typically, the disability, itself, is not the focus of the plot. Previous research suggests that counter stereotypical portrayals help to reduce prejudice (Kallman, 2017). Although progressive portrayals of disability are increasing over time (Devotta, Wilton, & Yiannakoulias, 2013), popular media outlets such as Hollywood films and television series continue to rely on traditional portrayals (Hayes & Black, 2003). Because children may have infrequent contact with people with disabilities, children's media may be particularly important for combating disability stigma (Matthew & Clow, 2007). The purpose of this research is to examine contemporary portrayals of disability by focusing on depictions of characters with disabilities in Disney and Pixar animated, featured films.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, although children's films provide an opportunity for broadening perspectives related to disability, this analysis indicates that children's films are not fully integrating characters with disabilities in progressive ways. Rather, characters with disabilities continue to be included in ways that position them as old or evil, or as an object of ridicule, supercrips, or pitiable. Particularly striking was the connection between mental disabilities and pitiable portrayals. Our findings underscore that little to no progress has been made in disability representations by Disney/Pixar; similar to historical films, contemporary films overwhelmingly rely on traditional portrayals of disability and provide children with stereotypical depictions of disability. As a whole, these films reaffirm the disability/ability system and further contribute to the symbolic annihilation of people with disabilities in children's media.\n\nAdditionally, we were surprised by the frequency of minor characters whose different bodies and/or minds were used to elicit humor. These characters reinforced stereotypical images of people with disabilities as \"fools\" or \"idiots\" who serve as \"a source of amusement for non-disabled people\" (Barnes, 1992, p. 13). Similar to Schwartz and colleagues' (2013) analysis of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Cinderella (1950), and Beauty and the Beast (1991), characters with intellectual disability were included as objects of ridicule. The humor came at the expense of these characters, which conveys the message (to children and adults) that people with differences should be laughed at. Overwhelmingly, disability portrayals in contemporary Disney and Pixar animated films were traditional and perpetuated disability stigma. Considering the high prevalence of disability, the representation of disability in children's films remains a disconcerting issue.\n\nMany of these stereotypical depictions mapped onto Clogston's (1994) original traditional media frames (i.e., the medical model, social pathology model, and supercrip model). In particular, the supercrip model was featured in multiple films where the characters with disabilities had to overcome their deficits. This is unsurprising for children's media, where the expectation of the audience is to \"feel good\" after viewing. Even though pity was often central to the supercrip model, the character with disability was presented as inspirational. However, these portrayals can be just as problematic as other traditional frames by creating unrealistic expectations for people with disabilities (Grue, 2015).\n\nThe medical model was prominent in Zootopia (2016), when the \"savage\" predators are cured of their mental illness. The medical model was also present in depictions of old age and evilness, where disability was presented as dysfunctional bodies and minds. The social pathology model was also employed, where the character with a disability was viewed as a burden. This was apparent in the beginning of Finding Dory (2016), where Dory is treated as an inconvenience and is asked to not go on a field trip because she may wander away. Other examples include the beginning of Up (2009), where Carl's refusal to sell his home is preventing construction and Arlo from The Good Dinosaur (2015) who is unable to complete the chores he is assigned by his father.\n\nOnly three films exemplified Clogston's (1994) progressive media frames, and all three films reflected the cultural pluralism model (i.e., people with disabilities are well-rounded and disability is ordinary). These counter stereotypical depictions highlight that disability is unremarkable and part of the human (non-human) experience. However, no film embraced the minority/civil rights model of disability, which underscores Disney/Pixar's unwillingness to take on issues related to Disability Rights. Similar to other axes of inequality like social class, we see producers of children's media preferring to present social inequality as benign and employing storytelling techniques that \"erases, downplays, or sanitizes'' inequality (Streib et al., 2017, p. 3).\n\nA few other aspects are worth noting. First, it was interesting to note that there also seems to be a gendered aspect to portrayals of disability in old age. While Carl from Up (2009) provides an exception, it seemed much more common for an older character with a disability to be a woman. Second, the loss of limbs or body parts seems to be somewhat normalized in these films, but often in a way that is humorous or fixable. Lastly, although we did not explicitly focus on this during our coding, the use of ableist language was common in the films. Examples included the use of \"crazy,\" \"what's wrong with you?\" or similar phrasing, and \"going Turbo\" (in Wreck-It Ralph (2012)).\n\nA few limitations of our study should be noted. First, disability is difficult to define, and while we examined the films for the presence or absence of disability, it could be beneficial to also consider more of a gradation of ability or functioning. For example, the sloths in Zootopia (2016) speak and move rather slowly, but we did not consider that a portrayal of disability. Likewise, we did not include characters who wore glasses in this analysis; although they seemed to \"mark\" characters in some ways, such as being \"geeky,\" wearing glasses was evident in many of the films and did not seem to carry much significance for the characters. While this could point to the \"ordinariness\" of vision impairment, most people who wear glasses do not consider themselves disabled. Similarly, it was difficult to examine disability in some of the films because of the fictional nature of the characters and because of the openness of interpretation. Mental intellectual disabilities were much more difficult to try to classify, partially because they went unspoken and were not associated with the level of explicit visual cues with which physical disabilities were signaled.\n\nThere were several areas of study that were beyond the scope of this project that warrant deeper attention. First, future research could look at specific areas associated with disability rights research and activism in more detail. An important, and missing piece of this topic, is how those with disabilities respond to and make sense of characters in these films. Future research should incorporate the voices of those with disabilities. Another possible area of interest might be obesity. While we did not consider obesity a disability for this project, it seems as though characters who are obese are often treated as objects of ridicule. If a goal is more inclusive and positive portrayals of difference, this is one area that warrants more attention. Lastly, a deeper focus on the use of ableist language seems warranted.\n\nIn summary, representations of disability that capture the challenges of disability without falling into pity narratives, and that illustrate the benefit of diversity through different abilities without relying on superpower narratives, seem to be missing. Disability has been left out of the recent movement by Disney/Pixar to make more inclusive animated films that challenge traditional gender norms and embrace multiculturalism. Progressive portrayals of disability are not only suspiciously missing from animated children's films, but from most popular media. Too often children and adults with disabilities do not see themselves represented on film or television, and when they do, the portrayals reinforce disability stigma. Given the increased risk of bullying and victimization experienced by children with disabilities, it is prudent to critically analyze the cultural messages about disability presented in widely viewed children's media. There is currently a missed opportunity in these films to tell compelling stories that embrace disability as a positive difference and provide stories that engender self-worth among children with disabilities and empathy among children without disabilities."
