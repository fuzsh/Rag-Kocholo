I had no idea they were twenty to thirty years old at the time. They were new to me. As an adolescent was told that cartoons were for kids but I never outgrew my love for these films and their stars. Instead, I became curious to know more about them; when they were I\n\n—\n\nI\n\nmade, who created the characters, why some series were funnier than others, and why there seemed to be three thousand mice in every Paul Terry cartoon. All I could find at the library were several books on Walt Disney. General histories of film barely mentioned animation, reserving what little space there was for Disney and the pioneers of experimental animation (Len Lye, Lotte Reiniger,\n\nNorman McLaren, and others). In these surveys, Bugs Bunny much as a passing nod, and neither did his\n\ndid not warrant so creators.\n\nFor several decades there was a snob barrier that prevented Hollywood cartoon from receiving serious attention. A sly\n\nthe\n\ndistinction arose\n\nbetween the \"cartoon\" and the \"animated\n\nnonstudio endeavor, which earned respectability in museums, schools, and publications because it was \"artistic.\" Perhaps Hollywood cartoons were too successful in the commercial marketplace to overcome such feelings. Perhaps their unpretentiousness worked against them. Certainly the fact that the film industry ignored these cartoons when they were still being made didn't help their bid for prominence or posterity. Only in recent years, as young people weaned on these cartoons began to infiltrate the world of film study, has the Hollywood cartoon come into its own. More attention has been focused on cartoons in the past five years than in the previous twenty-five combined. People who once took cartoons for film,\" the latter term connoting an independent,\n\n—\n\n—\n\nvii\n\nviii\n\nPREFACE\n\ngranted are beginning to discover what remarkable films they are and that the great animation directors and artists were outstanding filmmakers, who knew how to use their medium to its fullest potential. Their mastery of cinematic technique was equaled only by their ability to ente/tain. ^Vly friends and colleagues Joe Adamson, Mike Barrier, John Canemaker, and Greg Ford have been pioneers in this \"new wave\" of recognition.\n\n—\n\nthere is much work to be done. When I set out to write book, I discovered that it would involve a great deal of \"primary research.\" There were no sources to consult for some of the simplest details about American cartoon studios. Trade Still,\n\nthis\n\nmagazines of the twenties, offer, since\n\nnews\n\nthirties,\n\nforties had little to was not considered major Hollywood studios\n\nand\n\nof cartoon production\n\nimportant. Cartoon departments of\n\nwere so far removed from the mainstream of daily operations that a spokesman for one company I contacted swore he didn't know such a department ever existed. Compiling this history was something like assembling a giant jigsaw puzzle. Fortunately, many of animation's most distinguished veterans are still alive and were kind enough to share their memories. Many opened their files to lend me valuable documents and illustrations. As this book started to take shape, I decided to confine its boundaries to the American theatrical cartoon, in order to do as thorough a job as possible. A global history of animation, and an American history encompassing independent, sponsored, industrial, and television work, deserve book-length studies of their own.

My acknowledgments could not be complete without a sincere thank you to Barry Lippman, who initiated this project and stood by patiently while I missed several deadlines, and to John Thornton and Gerry Howard, who nurtured it to life. Finally, I would like to thank my wife, Alice, who not only transcribed most of my interviews and typed much of the manuscript, but put up with creeping cartoonitis for well over a year. Without her love and support this book would not exist. for\n\nhis\n\nfor\n\nbook, and\n\n1\n\n1\n\nThe Silent TOWARD\n\nTHE END\n\nof the 1920s,\n\na\n\nlarge\n\ngroup of New York animators held a testimonial dinner for Winsor McCay, whom most considered to be their mentor. As I. Klein recalls it, McCay concluded his brief remarks with a candid and unflattering appraisal: \"Animation should be an art, that is how I had conceived it. But what you fellows have done with it is [make] it into a trade not an art, but a trade bad .\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nluck.\"\n\nMcCay was become\n\nonly half right. Animation had but that did not obliterate its\n\na trade,\n\npotential as an art. Like the comic strip, the\n\nanimated cartoon became held it back in the\n\nWhat\n\nnomic pressure\n\nto\n\nmake\n\na\n\npopular\n\nsilent era\n\nart\n\nform.\n\nwas\n\neco-\n\nthe cartoon a screen\n\nequivalent of the comic strip— and produce it nearly as often. Animators who had to\n\ncrank out one film a week had little opportunity to analyze their medium, and no time for experimentation or improvement except on the job. That the medium progressed as far as it did by the 1920s is a tribute to the early animators' dedication and spirit. But animation developed only so far in the silent era and then marked time. There was nowhere else to go within the rigid boundaries of silent black-and-white gag cartoons, it\n\nseemed. Creative\n\nmen\n\ncontinued to turn out but a treadmill effect started to set in until sound lifted animation out of the doldrums. That considered, it's astonishing to see how many major developments came about entertaining\n\nfilms,\n\nprior to 1920,\n\nwhen\n\nthe motion picture itself\n\nwas still in its infancy. The century began with J. Stuart Blackton's THE ENCHANTED DRAWING, a short Edison film based on that newspaper cartoonist's\n\n\"chalk-talk\" vaudeville act:\n\nOn\n\na large\n\npad of paper Blackton draws a man's face with a bottle and glass above his head. Then he reaches toward the easel and \"lifts off\" now actual threethe bottle and glass dimensional objects to pour himself a drink. This displeases the cartoon man,\n\n— —\n\nwhose facial expression turns sour at same moment the bottle and glass\n\nthe are\n\nremoved. There is no animation in this 1900 short, but there is imaginative use of the motionpicture medium. Blackton understood that\n\n2\n\nOF MICE AND MAGIC\n\nyears later in the film that\n\nis\n\noften cited as the\n\nanimated cartoon, humorous phases of funny faces. Here, letters, words, and faces come to life, drawn by an linseen hand. This indeed was \"movie magic.\" Of course, creating the illusion of movement through animated drawings predated the motion picture by many years. Sequential drawings were made by cavemen, and first\n\nnumbered illustrations traced the development of many later civilizations. The discovery of \"persistence of vision\" in the 1800s led to the\n\ninvention of such devices as the zoe\"wheel of life.\" This was a cylinder\n\ntrope, or that\n\nspun on an\n\nwas\n\na strip of\n\naxis; inside the\n\nopen drum\n\ndrawings, each slightly different from the one preceding it. The drum was perforated with tiny slits through which the eye could see when the cylinder revolved.\n\nThe effect of \"moving pictures\" was created by the human eye, which held one image intact until the next one appeared. The succession of slits acted something like a shutter on a projector. The zoetrope was a direct forerunner of the motion picture, and the men who created drawings for it were in fact the first\n\nanimators.\n\nBut the zoetrope, and machines like it, were considered little more than novelty\n\n—\n\ntoys a more sophisticated version of the \"flip-books\" that were also popular at this time. Perhaps it was the simplicity of the\n\nStuart Blackton brings drawings to PHASES OF FUNNY FACES (1906).\n\nJ.\n\nlife in\n\nhumorous\n\nsince film is a sequence of individual frames, one could simply halt the movement of film through a camera, make appropriate changes leavin props and drawings, and continue\n\n—\n\ning the motion-picture audience to challenge the credo that \"seeing\n\nBlackton\n\nis\n\nbelieving.\"\n\nadvanced his experiments\n\nsix\n\ndrawings that inspired such feelings. The actions depicted in this kind of animation were basic and brief: a girl skipping rope, a man jumping through a hoop, and the like. Even so, these devices established the elementary procedures by which animated films could be made. One must speculate that the reason no one attempted to make animated cartoons for so many years after the introduction of film was the tremendous amount of labor involved. At sixteen frames per second, it would take nearly a thousand drawings to create one minute of an-\n\nTHE SILENT ERA\n\nimation\n\n—a\n\nfrom the demands of a were also technical quesbe answered, and no one with expefar cry\n\nflip-book.

One was a Frenchman, Emile Cohl; the other was an American, Winsor McCay. While this book is concerned with American animation, it would be irresponsible to ignore the accomplishments of Emile Cohl. their pioneering efforts\n\nSeveral years before\n\nMcCay made\n\nhis\n\nfirst\n\nshort subject, Cohl produced a series of ani-\n\nmated\n\nembrace sophisticated conmovement, design, humor, and format.

The settings materialize, and change, by \"metamorphosis,\" evolving from one to the next in a continuous flow as if their lines were made of clay, to be reshaped at the artist's whim. The ingenuity of a film like drame chez les fantoches (1908) is matched only by its charjn.\n\nit\n\nMcCay never mentioned Cohl's work, so known whether he had the opportu-\n\nisn't\n\nnity of seeing these films before\n\nembarking\n\nown movie projects. Winsor McCay was a newspaper\n\non his\n\nwhose\n\ncartoon-\n\nduring the first ten years of this century are widely considered to be the pinnacle of American comic art. McCay combined the abilities of a superb draftsman with the imagination of a master storyteller.

She would seem to obey his commands, react to his remarks, and even catch a pumpkin thrown into her mouth as a snack. For a finale, McCay would appear to walk right onto the screen and be into\n\nan\n\naway on Gertie's back. gertie had a galvanizing effect on audiences. Those who could not see McCay in person enjoyed a one-reel film reminiscent of little nemo in which the cartoonist accepted a bet from fellow cartoonists (including George McManus) that he could make a dinosaur come to life. The audience was then given a brief idea of how the film was made, with towering stacks of drawings, each different from the one preceding it. Finally, McCay's dialogue with the dinosaur was carried\n\ngertie the dinosaur (1914) devouring a treetop.\n\nand the animation prehe was, McCay made sure that his use of perspective was exact and that the drawings remained true-to-character no matter how the figures moved around. little nemo was well received, and McCay set to work on a second animated film, the story of a mosquito. This one took a year to complete and went beyond the pyeffect is dreamlike,\n\ncise: Perfectionist that\n\nnemo\n\ncomic story of a mosquito's encounter with a drunken man. McCay later wrote: \"While rotechnics of little\n\nto tell the\n\nthese films made a big hit, the theatre patrons suspected some trick with wires. Not until I drew gertie the dinosaur did the audience understand that 1 was making the drawings move.\" This may sound hard to believe, but it's true.

The series was a great success, but after a year Goldberg was exhausted and had to quit. Biographer Peter C. Marzio reported that Rube netted $75,000 from his year of labor. This was a hefty sum in those days, especially for animated cartoon work; it gives some measure of Goldberg's popularity. The two surviving entries from this series, nutty news and leap year, are downright hilarious, the latter chronicling the story of \"Miss Ophelia Fadeout, whose face had frightened all the children in the neighborhood, but who, nevertheless, still hopes to chloroform some poor simp into matrimony.\" George McManus, Milt Gross, and Sidney Smith were other comic strip men who tried their hand at animation, but they lacked the dedication or interest to stay with it. It\n\nremained\n\nfor others to shape the animated cartoon into a continuing commercial format.\n\nfrom animation altogether, but he proudly called himself the \"creator of animated cartoons,\" and in a very real sense he was. Other comic artists tried to capitalize on McCay's success by making animated cartoons. Henry (Hy) Mayer, prolific illustrator, author, and onetime editor of puck, drew comics on-screen for the Universal Weekly as early as 1913 and soon took on young Otto Messmer later to be animator of Felix the Cat as his assistant. He also had a popular series that appeared on screen magazines as travelaughs. Bert Green, who worked with Mayer at one time, provided brief cartoons for the weekly pathe news and in 1921 produced a special short subject on the making of animated films. Rube Goldberg pursued the animated cartoon with characteristic zeal. Pathe signed a\n\n—\n\n—\n\nJohn Randolph Bray was a successful newspaper cartoonist who became intrigued with animation around 1910. \"I thought there was something new and original that would get over big,\" he told Harvey Dener.\n\n(He also admitted, \"I thought there was good money in it.\") But Bray was convinced that there had to be a simpler way to make a cartoon than drawing every picture in its entirety over and over off in a 1972 interview.\n\nagain.\n\nHe abandoned\n\nhis\n\nnewspaper work\n\nto\n\nconcentrate on this problem and turned out a charming one-reel short called the dachs-\n\nhund and the sausage artist's dream).*\n\n*While this film\n\nis\n\n(also\n\nfor release\n\nas\n\nTHE\n\nof the film\n\nby film historians, it by Pathe until June 1913.\n\noften dated 1910\n\nwas not announced\n\nknown\n\nThe premise\n\nTHE SILENT ERA\n\nwas simple: An\n\nartist is\n\nfinishing a drawing.\n\ninterrupted while\n\nWhen\n\nhe's out of the\n\nroom, his cartoon dog eats a plate of sausages sitting on top of a bureau. The artist returns and can't believe his eyes.\n\nWhen\n\nBray showed his finished film to the producer-distributor Pathe, encouraged Bray to make others and offered to distribute these cartoons. Bray's second film introduced a character called Colonel Heeza Liar, based on the tale-spinning Baron Munchausen, colonel heeza liar in Africa (1913) opened with a stanza that announced its topical premise: \"Heeza Liar was his name And Colonel was his handle. He roamed the desert seeking fame To snuff out T.R.'s candle.\" T.R. was, of course, Charles\n\nTeddy Roosevelt, whose African hunting exploits had been front-page news and the inspiration for several live-action films. (A subsequent heeza liar episode caricatured\n\nWoodrow\n\nWilson.) In Bray's cartoon, a kangaroo hops into the foreground from the distant horizon; the Colonel emerges from the kangaroo's pouch and tips his hat to the camera. The balance of the film consists of Heeza Liar's escapades with various jungle animals such as a playful chimpanzee and an enthusiastic bear who likes to hug. All the com-\n\nmentary\n\nis\n\nadequate. Bray is true to perspective and proportions; when the character runs in circles, his drawings is\n\nremain consistent and accurate. Movement is not smooth, but it's more than adequate to put over the simple story and gags. One minor flaw, common to many silent cartoons, is that the camera picks up wrinkles in the animation paper. colonel heeza liar in africa is considered the first commercial-cartoon release; it was neither part of a vaudeville act nor a onetime endeavor. It was the beginning of a film\n\nand\n\nwhich was granted on August 11 of that method of making animated cartoons.

The translucent sheets would blend together under the camera lens and appear to be one finished drawing. In his patent application, Bray used colonel heeza liar in africa to illustrate this method and showed how a scene could be broken down to such specifics as having the character and background printed in their entirety except for the Colonel's head, which was to twist around. He admitted that there were times when it was easier to simply redraw the whole figure instead of spending the time and effort to print so many component sheets. He also outlined his ability to which the\n\nartist\n\nof the scene that\n\nreplace\n\nthe\n\ndrawn\n\ncharacter\n\npaper cutout\n\nsequences with\n\na\n\nachieve a certain\n\neffect.\n\nin in\n\nsome\n\norder to\n\nwritten in rhyming verse.\n\nTechnically the film\n\nseries,\n\nBray was responsible for other milestones as well.

In July 1914, Bray applied for a second patent,\n\nwhich was not granted\n\n9, 1915. In this\n\nuntil\n\nNovember\n\napplication, Bray described a\n\nsimple method for applying a range of gray tones to animated films\n\n— which\n\nuntil this\n\ntime had been mostly black-and-white line drawings. He wrote: iHvtnro*\n\nBy means of\n\nmy\n\npresent invention,\n\nI\n\nam\n\nable to\n\ngive to different parts of the picture, a different tone or shade in a very simple and inexpensive\n\n— THE SILENT ERA\n\nmanner.

Furthermore, the picture, if appearing upon the screen as black lines upon a white surless trying to the\n\nface, will also show as black lines any scratches which may be on the film due to repeated use and careless handling. By means of my invention, I am able to render these far less conspicuous and thus greatly increase the number of times which the film may be used and give satisfactory results.\n\nproposed was\n\na var-\n\niation of his earlier process: breaking\n\ndown\n\nThe method\n\nthat Bray\n\nall its basic components, then various parts of the scene both\n\nthe scene into filling in\n\ncharacter\n\nand\n\nbackground\n\n— with\n\n—\n\nblack,\n\nwhite, and gray-tone paints on the back side of translucent sheets, producing as many as five layers for each shot.

While Bray came near the target with his detailed and well-organized ideas, it was another former newspaper cartoonist, Earl Hurd, who hit bull's-eye. On December 19, 1914, he applied for a patent on the process that is still used today in the production of animated cartoons. Hurd proposed the drawing of a complete, stationary background on paper, with the characters inked and painted on clear celluloids laid on top. \"I believe am the first to employ a transpar-\n\ngreatest\n\nI\n\nent sheet or a plurality of transparent sheets\n\nbackground which is photographed therethrough upon the negative film,\" he stated in his patent application. He went on to explain:\n\nin conjunction with a\n\nIn\n\nmy\n\nprocess a single background\n\nis\n\nused\n\nfor the\n\nentire series of pictures necessary to portray\n\nscene.\n\nThe background shows\n\nof the scene that\n\nall\n\none\n\nof those portions\n\nremain stationary and may con-\n\nto refine his proc-\n\nveniently be drawn, printed, or painted on card-\n\nits simplest form.

A crucial feature of Hurd's patent was the use of several eels together. The example in his patent papers shows a woman spanking her little boy. In this action, only her right arm and\n\n—\n\n—\n\nOF MICE AND MAGIC\n\nE.

Thus it was not Hanna and Barbera\n\nwho\n\ndiscovered assembly-line animation in the television era; J. R. Bray and Earl Hurd\n\npreceded them by forty years.\n\nIronically,\n\nHurd's\n\ncel-and-background\n\nprocess was not immediately taken up as standard procedure. Most early animators\n\nwork on paper and saw no reason to complicate matters by inking those drawings onto eels. While Hurd's method preferred to\n\nits\n\nsupporters,\n\nit\n\nwas not until the sound was standardized that\n\nway.\n\nOddly enough,\n\nit\n\nwas another patented\n\nprocess of Bray's that became the favored\n\nmethod\n\nin\n\nearly\n\nanimation studios. This\n\non July 30, 1915, and patented April 11, 1916, proposed that the stationary objects of a scene be drawn on a translucent sheet and laid over a piece of paper where characters and objects would be animated. The end result was much the same as with Hurd's procedure the background was drawn only once but, as Bray pointed out, in this method one could show characters method,\n\nfiled\n\n— —\n\nTHE SILENT ERA\n\nwalking behind objects in an utterly simple and realistic fashion because they actually were being photographed \"underneath\"\n\nThe next major steps came from an orgabeing the first fullIts founder was Raoul Barre, a French-Canadian artist who, credited\n\nas\n\nfledged animation studio.\n\nmany newspaper\n\nlike so\n\ncartoonists,\n\nbecame\n\nintrigued with the possibilities of animation\n\nduring the teens.\n\nHe and\n\nBill\n\nNolan made\n\nprimitive animated advertising films as early\n\ntwo years\n\nas 1912;\n\nlater,\n\nBarre opened his\n\nown\n\nstudio in the Bronx, with Nolan at his\n\nside.\n\nHere, three important developments\n\nemerged within The first was\n\nmade use\n\na year's time.\n\n\"peg system\" invented by had to use makeshift methods to \"register\" a\n\none on top of another.\n\nof a system of crosses in the\n\nfour corners of the drawing, a form of registering\n\nthose objects.* nization\n\nexactly superimposed,\n\nBray\n\nborrowed\n\nfrom\n\ncolor\n\nprinting\n\ntechniques. \"In 1914 Barre resolved the problem of\n\nand superimposition by creating the 'peg system.'

In this way the successive phases of the animation process were assured of exact correspondence.\" Barre's next development was the \"slash system,\" a variation on Bray's methods in which the animation paper was cut or \"slashed\" at the dividing line between sta-\n\nmovement.

This system was used at several studios through the 1920s. The last great breakthrough came from Bill Nolan, who was soon to achieve fame as one of animation's finest practitioners. He discovered that if a background was drawn on long sheets of paper, it could pass \"underneath\" a character and provide the illusion of horizontal (or even vertical) movement, even though the character was walking in place. This device became a vital part of animated film making. There were other ideas and inventions, of course, in the early days of animation. Barre experimented with new techniques, such as animating \"special effects\" on glass, overlaid on the pen-and-ink drawings. Veteran animator Grim Natwick feels that one of the most important steps was the invention of \"the glass disk in the center of the drawing board, in the 1920s. That facilitated better drawing because you could always swing the\n\ntheir drawings, so that each successive trac-\n\ning was in perfect alignment with the one before.\n\nIn\n\nhis\n\nbrochure\n\n\"In\n\nBarre,\" published in 1976\n\nSearch\n\nof\n\nRaoul\n\nby the Cinema-\n\ntheque Quebecoise, Andre Martin has written: \"Winsor McCay used a paper cutter to give perfectly straight edges to the sheets of paper and right-angle forms to keep them .\n\n.\n\n.\n\n•Walter Lantz recalls using a variation of this process\n\nwhen he\n\nstarted\n\nworking\n\nat the\n\nHearst International Stu-\n\ndio in 1916. Matters were simplified\n\nsomewhat because\n\nthe \"backgrounds\" were incredibly sparse. \"Usually,\n\nwe'd have the horizon lines very high,\" Lantz recalls, \"and then we'd cut out that sheet of paper right below the horizon line and use that as an overlay on the drawing. Then, if we had a chair or any object that the character had to walk in front of, we had to trace that chair with the character as he went by it. It would wiggle all over the place, but that's how we did it.\" Paul Terry developed another method that involved double-exposure. \"I'd photograph the background first,\n\nwould reverse the\n\nfilm and make a male and he explained to Harvey Deneroff. In other words, a matte process.

His animation was realistic; whenever they needed something real, they gave it to Hurter.\" His most famous fine arts, particularly\n\naccomplishment at the Mutt and Jeff studio was the animation of an American flag waving in the breeze; he studied the real thing and then reproduced it in meticulous detail. Hurter later became a renowned sketch artist at the Disney studio. In 1918 Raoul Barre left his studio and gave up animation at least for a while. There was friction between him and Bowers,\n\n—\n\nand stories circulated that Barre had actually gone crazy. Whatever the case, Bowers took control of the studio and supervised the stories, as Barre had done before him. \"The most frequent word in his scripts was 'ad lib,'\" I. Klein recalls. \"'Mutt walks into a\n\nTHE SILENT ERA\n\nscene ... ad lib' meaning that the animator should improvise some funny business at that point. In other words, the stories were only outlines of a general theme. The humor within the scenes depended on the individual animators.\" A talented cartoonist .\n\nBowers\n\n.\n\n.\n\nprovided thumbnail sketches\n\nalso\n\nhis animators to\n\ntor\n\nwork from.\n\nHis reign as studio head was short. In\n\nwas\n\nby Bud Fisher\n\nsuch popular \"stars\" as Krazy Kat, Happy Hooligan, and the Katzenjammer Kids. It seemed to Hearst that animated counterparts could only increase their popularity and if he made a profit on the films themselves, so much the better. In a further corporate tie-in, these cartoons were limited to one third of a reel in length, so they could be released as part of Hearst's weekly newsreel.\n\n—\n\nto let\n\nhim produce mutt and jeff cartoons as an independent contractor. He opened a tiny studio in Mount Vernon, New York, and hired many animators who had worked at\n\nAs previously mentioned, Hearst hired Gregory LaCava and Frank Moser away from the Barre studio to head this new operation. The reason for this was simple: He needed someone with experience, and there was nowhere to turn except the few established animation studios. LaCava was a proficient\n\nthe Bronx shop; in late 1921 he decided to\n\ncartoonist, but his real talent lay in the field\n\npursue other ventures and discontinued pro-\n\nof\n\nduction, only to resume three years later\n\ntry his\n\nwith a new setup in Astoria and a new contract with Bud Fisher.

After Bowers abandoned mutt and jeff in 1921, Friel continued its production under the banner of Jefferson Film Corporation. All\n\nin\n\nHorace\n\nArchibald J. Mutt and Edgar were animated by more different more different places than any\n\nall,\n\nJeff\n\npeople in\n\nother characters in cartoon history.\n\nTheir\n\nongoing popularity in the funnies assured them a place on theater screens no matter\n\nhow\n\noften\n\nthe\n\nflow\n\nof\n\nproduction\n\nwas\n\ninterrupted.\n\nComic\n\nstrip characters\n\nand raison\n\nwere the mainstay\n\nd'etre of Hearst's International\n\nFilm Service, established in 1915. Hearst's King Features Syndicate owned the rights to\n\ncomedy. In the 1920s he\n\nleft\n\nanimation to and soon\n\nluck in live-action films\n\ncomedy my man Godfrey. Frank Moser had no such ambitions, but he possessed a quality that was equally important in these early days. Fellow animator Bert Green called him \"the most rapid animator in the game.\" Green added, \"Moser literally shakes them out of a hat. I have seen Moser take a scenario of happy hooligan and in thirty days hand you a pile of between two and three thousand drawings that you couldn't jump over and live through it. Yes, and catch the 5:15 for Hastings 'nine times running.'\" Raiding rival studios for talent was a way of life for the next twenty years; one could fit all the experienced animators in the United States into a subway car and still have seats left over. \"There weren't any animators and that was the fact,\" declares Grim Natwick. \"And nobody was developing animators; that's why Walt Disney started [doing that] later. I happened to be a functioning animator and there were periods when I'd be screwball\n\n16\n\nOF MICE AND MAGIC\n\non an average two weeks or so.\" Yet Natwick started out on the ground\n\nHe found it very hard to get do this; nobody knew how to animate. They wouldrcomef in and see somebody drawing a hundred drawings a day and it would frighten them. We knew each other well, and I had apparently shown a knack of drawing humorous drawings, so he persuaded me to try it for a couple of weeks. That lasted about fifty years. I was what they call a natural animator, and I don't know why; I have always attributed it to the fact that I was interested in athletics. I found that almost all the good animators were either\n\noffered a job at another studio\n\ntry this thing?'\n\nof every\n\nartists to\n\nfloor of this business, just like everyone else. There were no animators with seniority in 1916 because the medium was brand new and everyone was still learning. The only \"seniority\" occurred when newspaper cartoonists of some repute moved into animation studios; the rest of the staff filled in with\n\nyoung men, many in their teens, some of whom had been to art school and others who simply liked to draw. In Natwick's case, he and Gregory LaCava had gone to art school together in Chicago. While LaCava pursued the new motion-picture\n\nmedium, Natwick made\n\nillustrating\n\nsheet-music\n\na\n\ngood\n\ncovers.\n\nliving\n\nWhen\n\nNatwick moved from Chicago to New York, he looked up his old friend, who was now running the International studio at 729 Seventh Avenue. \"I was having lunch with LaCava one day and he said, 'Why don't you\n\ndevotees of athletics or athletically inclined. That may not be so true now, because the kids come up through art school. In those days, I was about the only animator, even at the Disney studio, who had had several years of real, sincere, earnest art education.\" Among the younger element there were\n\nthose who had taken art courses, but once they found full-time employment at studios like Hearst's there was neither time nor incentive to continue such studies.\n\nKrazy Kat and Ignatz Mouse in a scene from krazy kat, invalid (1916), animated by Leon Searl.\n\nSome\n\nof\n\nuneducated cartoonists intimidated them as well. Shamus Culhane recalls that when he worked at Harrison and Gould studios in the 1920s, as an inker: \"I was an oddball. In the first place, I brought books in amazing! Then, when I to read at lunch happened to mention that I was going to the Art Students League to take a course in etching,, one of the animators took me to one side and said, 'Don't learn all that shit, it will stiffen you up.'

Walter\n\nbe the creator of\n\nWoody\n\nWoodpecker, started at Hearst's at age sixteen and progressed from cameraman to inker and finally to animator. He explains: \"I would take the old Charlie Chaplin films and project them one frame at a time, make a drawing over Chaplin's action, and flip the drawings to see how he moved. That's how\n\n— THE SILENT ERA\n\nmost form\n\nanimate.\" This very became a mainstay courses many years\n\nof us learned to\n\nof \"action analysis\"\n\nof Disney's studio art\n\nJust as\n\n\"creator\"\n\nBud Fisher was of his mutt and\n\nthe figurehead jeff\n\ncartoons,\n\nHearst cartoonists like George Herriman, Rudolph Dirks, and Frederick Opper had no contact with the animators who brought their characters to\n\nlife.\n\nAt\n\nthis studio, the\n\nanimators did receive screen credit, though in such a way as to give the impression that the film\n\nwas\n\na \"collaboration.\"\n\ncard read: \"krazy kat\n\nA sample\n\ntitle\n\nand ignatz mouse\n\n—\n\n—\n\nat the circus A Cartoon By George Herriman\"; then in smaller letters: \"Animated by Leon Searl.\" Herriman's\n\nbrilliant comic strip suffered hands of the Hearst animators, who\n\nwere forced to simplify the complicated drawing style and all but eliminate backgrounds in order to turn out their cartoons on a production-line basis. The humor was somewhat diluted as well, the katzenjammer kids made the transition to motion pictures much better than krazy kat. Here the animators could concentrate on simple reproduction of the familiar characters and devise endless variations on the enduring theme of childhood mischief. Other adaptations included George McManus's bringing up father, Tad Dorgan's silk hat harry and tad's indoor sports, Walter Hoban's jerry on the job, and Jimmy Swinnerton's little jimmy. T. E. Powers's phables, perhaps the most unusual, were executed in the artist's stylishly simple fashion and permeated by his impish sense of humor.

They were \"living comic strips\" in the truest sense, but without the graphic styling that made the better comics of the day so striking. Hearst closed his studio in July 1918, but continued to finance and license cartoon production with his newspaper characters. John Terry (Paul's brother, and an early experimenter with animation in his native San\n\nopened a studio in New York's Greenwich Village, apparently with Hearst's backing, and hired most of the Hearst InterFrancisco)\n\n—\n\nstaff LaCava, Nolan, Gillett, Natwick, Sharpsteen, Lantz, and Jack King to continue making phables, happy hooligan, bringing up father, and judge\n\nnational\n\nrummy\n\ncartoons.\n\nIn 1919 other films bearing the\n\nname\n\nInter-\n\nnational Film Service were released by Bray studios,\n\nand soon Bray was actually produc-\n\nnew\n\ncartoons with such Hearst characters\n\ning\n\nas Krazy Kat\n\naccording\n\nto\n\nand\n\nJerry.\n\nThis came about,\n\nBray, because Hearst\n\nfringing on Bray's patents.\n\nwas\n\n\"We were\n\nin-\n\ngoing\n\nsue him,\" he later explained. \"Then 1 figured he was too big for us.

Bray was the first successful cartoonist to become an even more successful cartoon pro-\n\nthe newspaand everything else\n\nducer. After the success of his colonel heeza liar, and the granting of three important patents, Bray set up shop and hired other cartoonists to animate for him.

Finally he goes to bail out the poor sap,\n\nlier\n\n—\n\n—\n\nTHE SILENT ERA\n\nfirst\n\nwas\n\nHurd, who brought not only and imagination but his patent on\n\nEarl\n\nhis talent\n\nthe use of eels to Bray's studio. Together they\n\nBray-Hurd Patent trust and from every studio that used their techniques. (Most of the New York studios in the 1920s animated on paper and avoided such tariffs, but in the early 1930s practically everyone used eels and paid Bray and Hurd for their use.) Hurd may be best known as the inventor of eels, but in the teens he made an equally significant contribution with his bobby bumps cartoons. The first of these were made for Universal in 1915, and perhaps their success led to Bray's production offer. They are among the most mature, most well-conformed\n\nthe\n\ndemanded\n\nlicense fees\n\n—\n\nceived cartoons of the silent era certainly the best work done in the mid- to late teens.\n\nThe\n\nfilms use a full range of gray tones in\n\nand backgrounds, with pleasing The animation, if not fluid, is workmanlike and functional. The characters Bobby Bumps and his dog Fido are likable as well and can be said to have personality derived more through dialogue, stories, and characters effect.\n\nexpressions than from any sophisticated animation, but personality just the same. Most important, however, is the sub-\n\nfacial\n\nstance of the films, and this is where they leave the competition behind. Hurd's bobby bumps cartoons have a beginning, a middle,\n\nand an end. They are well thought out, like a good comic strip, with clever story ideas and gags. Ingenious cinematic devices add to their appeal.\n\n—\n\nExample: bobby bumps before and after opens as Bobby finds a bottle in a garbage bin. The picture dissolves (an unusual technique to find in cartoons of this period) to a close-up\n\nhair restorer.\n\nshowing the contents to be a tries it out on Fido, and\n\nBobby\n\nthe picture cuts to an posterior. Above the\n\niris\n\nclose-up of Fido's\n\niris\n\nis\n\nthe headline\n\n\"What Bobby Expected,\" followed by\n\nani-\n\nmation of hair growing on the dog. Then another headline announces, \"What Came Up,\" and from the dog float the letters N-OT-H-I-N-G. The story proper has Bobby selling the bottle\n\nof hair restorer to\n\nhis father,\n\nwho\n\nimagines hair growing on his bald pate and is duped by Fido's scheme of having two dogs, one short-haired, the other long-, pretending to be the same dog before and after treatment. During the night, when Pop is asleep, Bobby and Fido glue feathers to his head. In the morning, the unamused father\n\npunishes his son by letting his scalp-massaging machine spank the boy. The range of visual ideas in Hurd's repertoire is amazingly broad. In bobby bumps sets out to school, the youngster's attitude toward education is illustrated by showing him walking with oppressively oversized school books on his back; no dialogue is necessary to\n\nAnimator star in\n\nmake\n\nEarl\n\nthe point. In\n\nHurd writes\n\na\n\nbobby bumps\n\nmessage\n\nto his juvenile\n\nbobby bumps puts a beanery on the bum (1918).\n\nOF MICE AND MAGIC\n\nPUTS A BEANERY ON THE BUM, Fido with a cat who calls him a going to make him eat those declares Fido as he dares the cat\n\ngets into\n\n\"I'm words,\" to speak again. \"You dirty cur,\" says the cat. Fido grabs the dialogue balloon, crumples it up,\n\na fight\n\ncur.\n\nand stuffs it down the cat's throat! The beanery cartoon is full of interaction with the unseen animator, a device one usually associates with Max Fleischer's later inkwell series. An artist's hand draws Bobby in silhouette, lying down. Bobby gets up and the animator says, \"hat off,\" so he can ink in his hair, the rest of his features, and clothing. The rest of the cartoon maintains this playful banter, culminating in a deus ex machina finale, in which the animator responds to Bobby and Fido's cries for help by drawing a ladder, which they climb to escape from the clutches of an angry cook; the animator then erases the drawing so the chef cannot follow and hands Bobby his inkwell, so Bobby can douse his adversary. Earl Hurd's cartoons set a standard that was difficult for his colleagues to match.\n\nAmong\n\nthe other cartoonists to join\n\nhim\n\nat\n\nwere Leighton Budd, who created lunyland; F. M. Follett, known for his newspaper cartoons* Private Conscience and The See-See Kid, who animated the quacky doodles family; and Wallace Carlson, whose creations included dreamy dud, otto luck, and Goodrich dirt, which owed a lot to bobby bumps in format and design. But Bray's most important finds were Max Fleischer, Paul Terry, and Walter Lantz. All three made their mark at Bray and went on Bray's studio\n\nto\n\nopen With\n\ntheir\n\nown\n\nsuccessful studios.\n\nkind of talent on hand, Bray was able to accept a commitment for one cartoon a week, which appeared as the final portion of the paramount-bray pictograph, a screen magazine (like Hearst's) with several live-action segments per issue. Each artist had one month to complete his cartoon, and the deadlines were staggered so that one would be ready every week. When one of these key cartoonists left the studio (as Fleischer and Terry did during World War I), it was necessary to find an immediate replacement to maintain the regular output. this\n\nwas\n\nBray's operation\n\nmodern cartoon thirty or forty\n\n.\n\n.\n\nessentially that of a\n\n\"We had about working in our stu1972. \"We worked out a\n\nstudio. .\n\nartists\n\ndio,\" he recalled in\n\nsystem of the original cartoonist laying out Then another fellow would ink in certain parts of it.

But it got more perfect, until finally it got as good, I guess, as most of the cartoons you see. ...\" the thing in pencil.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nBray started another less formal tradition when he graduated from the\n\nin animation\n\ndrawing board to the executive office. After several colonel heeza liar cartoons in 1914 and 1915 (which modestly credited him as \"the world's greatest motion picture cartoonist\"), he stopped drawing, in order to supervise his rapidly expanding business. A commitment with Paramount for the weekly pictographs in 1916 necessitated live-action filming, while the arrival in 1917 of enthal, a mechanical draftsman,\n\n*Some newspaper\n\ncartoonists adapted to the rigors of\n\nanimation, while others didn't. Carl Anderson animated Bray's police dog series, but enjoyed greater success with his Henry comic strip.

Milt Gross, on the verge of great success as a newspaper cartoonist, made some films for Bray in 1920 (including one typical reel called frenchy discovers America), but left after a very short time. New ideas were scarce; krazy kat and jerry on the job were losing steam, and, for want of a better idea, colonel heeza liar was taken out of mothballs. Then Stallings was replaced by an ambitious young animator named Walter Lantz. Lantz was full of fresh ideas, and the studio's product improved. His dinky doodles, combining live action and animation, rekindled the kind of interest that Fleischer's out of the inkwell series had evoked several years Lantz's follow-ups unnatural history, and hot dog cartoons with Pete the Pup met with similar success. Also on the Bray staff at this time was a nucleus of animators who just ten years later would help shape the destiny of the Walt Disney studio: Jack King, David Hand, Clyde \"Gerry\" Geronimi, and, in the educational division, Cy Young and Alec Geiss. before.\n\n—\n\nAnother young man who started his animation career with Bray in the 1920s was Shamus Culhane, who recalls some of the mundane but formidable problems at that time: \"The eels were a disaster. In the first place, they were nitrate. It was phenomenal how people handled those damn things. Why we weren't blown up and burned to hell, I don't know.\" No one ever gave a second thought to dangling a cigarette over his work even though the celluloids were highly flammable. \"The biggest problem was the paint,\" he continues. \"You would work all day and fin-\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\nOF MICE AND MAGIC\n\nish a shot, with a pile of\n\ndrawings you'd been working on, eels all done.

Or in the wintime they'd turn the heat off in the build-\n\nter\n\nSunday and it would be come in, in the morning, you'd take some eels and all the paint would fall on the table. It would crack. It looked terrible and it had to be scraped off and done all over again. We did all kinds of things, like trying to put cornstarch on the back to see if it would absorb the moisture. Sometimes it did, but mostly it didn't. It was a pain in the ass; you got cornstarch all over yourself and the drawings. What a way to ing for Saturday and\n\nvery, very cold.

The market for cartoons was shaky, and after losing his distribution deal with Goldwyn, the income level dropped. Bray continued making educational films, but the theatrical cartoon staff looked elsewhere for work. least until 1927,\n\nBray's\n\nwas\n\nthe last of the teens' three\n\nmajor studios to close; Hearst's International Film Service had not lasted the decade, nor had Barre's, although his successors continued to run that shop into the early 1920s. It was Fleischer and Terry, Bray alumni, who headed New York's most successful anima-\n\nAmerica. As assistant to the popular William F. Marriner, he inherited that cartoonist's comic strips when Marriner died in a 1914 fire. Sullivan 'subsequently turned one of them, Sambo and his Funny Noises, into an animated cartoon series called sammy (or sammie) johnsin in 1916.

The design of the character was quite different saves\n\nthen from the one that evolved in later years.

Later a comic strip was launched, which\n\nMessmer drew for many years. As production continued on the series, Messmer made an important discovery: \"I found that I could get as big a laugh with a little gesture— a wink or a twist of the tail as I could with gags.\" This was the key to\n\n24\n\nOF MICE AND MAGIC\n\nThe\n\nFelix's success.\n\nstories\n\nwere generally\n\ngood, and the gags quite ingenious, but\n\nwas %\n\nit\n\nthe development of a distinctive person-\n\nality that\n\nmade\n\nFelix the greatest cartoon star\n\nof the silent era. Felix\n\nhis\n\nhad\n\nway out\n\na\n\nmind, and he used it to think tough spot. From this foun-\n\nof a\n\ndation came the trademarks of this series: Felix's pensive walk, with head down in a\n\nhands clasped behind his back, and his unique gift for turning his tail into any implement necessary at the moment an oar, a baseball bat, thoughtful\n\nposition\n\nand\n\n—\n\nhook, a telescope. This talent was complemented by Felix's frequent excursions into unreality: He could jump into a telephone and squeeze himself through the wires; cross over a chasm on a \"bridge\" of question marks that emanated from his head; disguise himself as a suitcase in order a fishing\n\nHollywood, he\n\ntours the\n\nmovie studios and\n\nimpress a producer by imitating Chaplin, using his tail as a cane.

Anything less would have been unworthy of the character a sure sign that Felix's personality had taken root.

Yet they were forging a new, liquid style of cartooning that had some New Yorkers sitting up and taking notice. Walter Lantz and Bill Nolan set up shop in California, and this\n\nwillunous\n\nbegan a gradual migration west for much of the animation industry. For the first time young people recruited to work in this field would come from outside the world of New York newspapers. Then Disney prodded his competitors into production of talking pictures with steamboat willie, the landmark sound cartoon with Mickey Mouse. Many of the New Yorkers would have been content to release their silent films with music-and-effects sound tracks, as they did in 1929, but by 1930 there was no question that sound was vital to the\n\nney achieved in steamboat willie and abandoned just as quickly to seek more sophisticated and persuasive use of sound and music. Looking back at cartoons produced in the teens and twenties, one greatly regrets that animators were unable, or unwilling, to retain the visual virtuosity that marked their best endeavors. Earl Hurd, Otto Messmer, and the Fleischers flirted with surrealism and the fourth dimension not through any artistic credo but from the simple necessity of\n\ncontinuation of cartoon production.\n\nmanner and exploring new ways of doing so for humorous effect.

He too had a flair for personality animation that Walt soon recognized, and in the mid-1930s he was the man in charge of Mickey Mouse. At a time when Mickey's thunder was being stolen by other characters, Moore redesigned him to give him more flexibility and a modern facial styling. According to Moore, \"In some pictures he has a touch of Fred Astaire; in others of Charlie Chaplin; and some of Douglas Fairbanks, but in all of these there should be some of the young boy.\" Nobody captured this feeling better than Moore. Goofy began life in the early 1930s as a stringbean character called Dippy Dawg. He had a silly laugh, provided by Pinto Colvig, and a silly manner to match. But he never came into focus as a star personality until Art Babbitt set to\n\nwork on him.

Disney had heard Clarence Nash reciting \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" as a flustered duck on a Los Angeles radio show and recognized the cartoon potential for such a voice. Donald made his debut as a supporting character in the WISE LITTLE HEN, One of the SILLY SYMPHONIES series, and then was showcased in orphans' benefit, in which he attempted to do his recitation before a jeering audience of mischievous mice-children. Donald's screen personality was largely the creation of animator Dick Lundy, who recalls working on the orphans' benefit: \"I listened to the dialogue track and decided that he was an ego show-off. If anything crossed him he got mad and blew his top. For this had him lean forward, chin out, arm straight out and fisted. The other arm, with fist, was swinging back and forth.
