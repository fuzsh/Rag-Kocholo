        "text": "Welcome to MsMojo, and today we’re looking at the most innovative or progressive stories in feature length animation. Special technical achievements will be saved for another day! Did we miss any animated movies you thought were ahead of their time? Let us know in the comments!\n\n#10: “The Secret of NIMH” (1982)\n\nBased on the novel “Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH,” this Don Bluth feature offered a darker alternative to Disney’s whimsical fairy tale output. It begins with the movie’s mouse protagonist, now called Mrs. Brisby, seeking medicine for her sickly child …and it doesn’t let up from there! A farmer and his cat threaten her family’s way of life, and her quest to seek guidance from the prophet Nicodemus uncovers a sinister truth about her late husband’s past. Whilst some critics worried that the film’s themes and characters might be too complex for child audiences, many others praised its uniquely mature premise. The film was Bluth’s directorial debut, and set the precedent for a family-friendly filmography that refused to talk down to its audience.\n\n#9: “Cats Don’t Dance” (1997)\n\nNineteen years before “Zootopia” presented its animal-based allegory for racism, “Cats Don’t Dance” waltzed onto screens across America. Unlike its successor, its scope was a bit more narrow, focusing specifically on the inequality seen in 1930’s Hollywood. Whereas human girl Darla Dimple was frequently cast as a leading lady, the cats, hippos, turtles, and goats were all stereotyped into roles based on stereotypes about their respective species. We’d be remiss not to mention that introducing human characters into such an allegory comes with its own set of problems, but the message was still clear: no one should be discounted solely because of the way they look. In addition to its message of acceptance, it also featured a pretty pitch perfect satirization of old Hollywood.\n\n#8: “Big Hero 6” (2014)\n\nDeath is far from a new concept in animation. Disney in particular is known for its memorably heart-wrenching scenes of parental loss. Nonetheless, few family films have dealt with grief quite as well as “Big Hero 6.” When Hiro’s brother, Tadashi, dies in a fire, the protagonist is understandably heartbroken and angry. Suspecting the fire to have been arson, he seeks revenge, even attempting to kill the masked man he believes is responsible. But vengeance is unfulfilling. Hiro realizes that his connections with family and friends, and the remembrance of those lost, are the true keys to healing. A diverse cast of characters adds to the film’s significance, allowing kids across the nation to see themselves in its important story.\n\n#7: “Mulan” (1998)\n\nBy the late 90’s, anime had taken the Western world by storm but, when it came to American-made productions, Asian characters were still noticeably absent. “Mulan” didn’t change this, but its impact for those in the film’s target demographic was undeniable. Young Chinese girls finally had a Disney heroine they could see themselves in, and she could be seen in theaters across the nation. The film’s Asian protagonists were even voiced by Asian actors - a seemingly common sense practice that studios still manage to miss the mark on to this day. Unintentionally, the film also held significance for many trans and gender nonconforming youth, who saw themselves in Mulan’s “Reflection.”\n\n#6: “Belladonna of Sadness” (1973)\n\nExperimental animation was on the rise in the 1970’s, with directors like René Laloux and Ralph Bakshi pushing the limits of what the medium could be. One of the most interesting films of the period was Eiichi Yamamoto’s “Belladonna of Sadness.” Previously known for his work on “Kimba the White Lion,” the filmmaker shocked audiences with this psychedelic depiction of violence and sexuality. Whether it’s a feminist masterpiece or a poorly aged exploitation piece is up for debate, but regardless of where you stand there’s no denying that “Belladonna of Sadness” is unlike anything that came before or after it. Sure, from an artistic standpoint its animation may be limited, but it’s hard to care when each frame is this beautifully crafted.\n\n#5: “Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron” (2002)\n\nFrom “Peter Pan” to “Pocahontas,” the depiction of Native Americans in children’s animation has been historically problematic. “Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron” took a step in the right direction. In contrast to the many other Western-inspired films before it, “Spirit” cast the US Army as the villains and Native Americans as its secondary protagonists. The main characters are, of course, horses, but their arc only adds to the film’s anti-colonial themes. When Spirit is caught by soldiers, for example, his forced assimilation can be seen as an allegory for the experience of Indigenous children. This progressive narrative seems to have played a role in its middling critical response at the time of release, with Rotten Tomatoes’ consensus for the movie calling it “too politically correct.”\n\n#4: “FernGully: The Last Rainforest” (1992)\n\nThe 1990’s were a volatile time for the environment. The U.N. warned of potential rising global temperatures, and the oil spills were some of the most disastrous to date. It was this climate that inspired “Ferngully,” an environmental fairy tale. The film tackled deforestation and pollution in a way that was simultaneously fun and easy to understand for its young audience. It was even animated on recycled paper! Pixar would release “WALL-E” sixteen years later, garnering praise for both its hopeful conservationist ending and harrowing depiction of an abandoned Earth. Although “Ferngully” would never see the same level of critical praise as its successor, there’s no question that it was ahead of the curve on teaching children the importance of going green.\n\n#3: “The Breadwinner” (2017)\n\nFor their third feature, Cartoon Saloon traveled back to 2001, depicting Afghanistan in the early days of America’s “War on Terror.” Released in a world still marred by rampant Islamophobia, “The Breadwinner”s portrayal of Afghans was appropriately complex. Although it does occasionally employ well-worn stereotypes, the film makes sure to show that not every man living under the Taliban’s patriarchal rule is violent or cruel. It also features Afghan women who are far more than their oppression - including its protagonist, who dresses as a boy to become her family’s breadwinner. War is not kid-friendly by nature, so it’s no surprise that “The Breadwinner” received a PG-13 rating in America, but it offers a nice middle ground between the graphic reality and more sanitized portrayals.\n\n#2: “Mary and Max” (2009)\n\nDon’t let its cartoony claymation characters fool you! This is an animated film better suited for adults. But its nuanced and sympathetic portrayal of sensitive topics makes it worth a watch for anyone mature enough to handle its subject matter. Starring Toni Collette and Philip Seymour Hoffman, “Mary and Max” focuses on two unlikely friends who bond over their struggles with self image, and their love of a show called “The Noblets.” During the film, Max is diagnosed with autism and, though his traits can be somewhat stereotypical, he is afforded more nuance and agency than many autistic characters of the modern day. He expresses understandable anger when Mary writes about him without his consent, and insists that he does not need to be cured.\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions.\n\n“Lilo & Stitch” (2002)\n\nUnderneath Its Alien Exterior, “Lilo & Stitch” Shined a Light on Real Human Issues\n\n“One Stormy Night” (2005)\n\nIntentionally or Not, Gabu & Mei’s Star-Crossed Love Story Resonated with Gay Viewers\n\n“Kubo and the Two Strings” (2016)\n\nA Compassionate Tale That Teaches Kids About a Japanese Tradition\n\n“The Black Cauldron” (1985)\n\nOne of Disney’s Darkest Animated Features\n\n“The Little Mermaid” (1989)\n\nAriel Had a Rebellious Streak That Set Her Apart from Her Predecessors\n\n#1: “Shrek” (2001)\n\nLike an onion (or an ogre), “Shrek” has layers. In recent years, the film has become the frequent subject of memes, but that has never discounted its very real impact on the film industry. There’s a reason it won the very first Best Animated Feature Oscar in 2002, and got added to the United States’ National Film Registry in 2020. At a time when Disney reigned supreme, “Shrek” proved that DreamWorks had what it took to go toe to toe with the animation giant. Its clever pop culture references and occasionally risqué humor entertained adults without ever slighting its younger audience. And its memorable soundtrack certainly didn’t hurt its legacy either!"
