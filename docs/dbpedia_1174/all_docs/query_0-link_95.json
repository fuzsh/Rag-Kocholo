        "text": "All cartoons can’t be classics… but the good has to come with the bad – that’s one of the great rules of life. With animation, it’s pretty easy to dismiss a whole series as being terrible without much experience with other films from the series. I’m not saying that you don’t get a general idea of whether you’ll like the series from a film or two, but you can’t judge a whole studio’s output from those examples.\n\nOne of the great crusades I’m personally on is to at the very least make sure some of the of series are at the very least represented as they should be, as close as possible to their original theatrical (or broadcast) exhibition. For the most part I’ll leave some crusades to others since I have my hands full with a bunch right now!\n\nThat all said, there are still clunkers, and I have to admit many of those clunkers I actually like a lot, but do recognize that they are sometimes not the greatest films that have been put forth in the medium. I don’t want to see them vanquished from the earth as some folks do, but I have to think that perhaps the best treatment of some of these is perfume on the proverbial pig.\n\nSo, everyone has at least a FEW films that would be on their worst list. Here’s my top 5 worst cartoons. What are yours?\n\n1). Op Pop Wham and Bop (1966) To me, this is perhaps the most boring cartoon ever made. Made for Drive-In Theatres to allow patrons seven minutes to use the bathroom – or perhaps cause them to use the bathroom. The setting in a Museum of “Way-Out Art” is a fun idea, but the character designs – for Ffat Kat and Ratt Ffink (a poor man’s Herman and Katnip) – are butt ugly, the animation unfunny and I can’t help but watch it and think of ways to make every part of the film better. Even the classic “sea-sick gag” is sad – and literally sickening!\n\n2) Goose in the Rough (1963)\n\nI honestly like a few of the Beary Family cartoons, but I can’t get past the first minute on this one…. At least it has Paul Frees on the track. Who were these cartoons aimed at?\n\n3) The Cuckoo IQ (1941)\n\nI really like Columbia cartoons- perhaps to more than a healthy level…but this particular cartoon doesn’t elicit even the simplest smile from anyone I’ve eve shown it to. Funny enough, I’ve owned 3 prints of it over the years. I must be a glutton for punishment.\n\n4) A Coy Decoy – REDRAWN version (1941)\n\nNow, the Korea-redawn Warner cartoons are all pretty bad, but some are way worse than others. This particular one seems to skip a LOT of frames – sometimes the animation seems to be on 4’s or 5’s… Check out that Porky animation at 6:20-6:38. Hoo-boy!\n\n5) Adventure by the Sea (1960)\n\nI dare anyone to sit through even a single Luno cartoon, much less 2 or three. At least there’s an albino Monstro the Whale ripoff to keep things interesting for several moments. If the hypnotic opening title doesn’t put you in a trance, the rest of the cartoon will. Sweet dreams!\n\nOk… your turn. What are your worst? Have a good week folks!"
