But Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus is doing exactly that.\n\nWhat if you could harness the power of the free market to solve the problems of poverty, hunger, and inequality? To some, it sounds impossible. But Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus is doing exactly that. As founder of Grameen Bank, Yunus pioneered microcredit, the innovative banking program that provides poor people 'mainly women' with small loans they use to launch businesses and lift their families out of poverty.\n\nWhere you can obtain copy of the book\n\nReviews on Creating a World Without Poverty\n\nIn the past thirty years, microcredit has spread to every continent and benefited over 100 million families. But Yunus remained unsatisfied. Much more could be done, he believed, if the dynamics of capitalism could be applied to humanity's greatest challenges.\n\nNow, in Creating a World Without Poverty, Yunus goes beyond microcredit to pioneer the idea of social business a completely new way to use the creative vibrancy of business to tackle social problems from poverty and pollution to inadequate health care and lack of education. This book describes how Yunus in partnership with some of the world's most visionary business leaders' has launched the world's first purposely designed social businesses. From collaborating with Danone to produce affordable, nutritious yogurt for malnourished children in Bangladesh to building eyecare hospitals that will save thousands of poor people from blindness, Creating a World Without Poverty offers a glimpse of the amazing future Yunus forecasts for a planet transformed by thousands of social businesses. Yunus 'Next Big Idea' offers a pioneering model for nothing less than a new, more humane form of capitalism.\n\n'By giving poor people the power to help themselves, Dr. Yunus has offered them something far more valuable than a plate of food security in its most fundamental form.'\n\n- Former President Jimmy Carter\n\n'Muhammad Yunus is a practical visionary who has improved the lives of millions of people in his native Bangladesh and elsewhere in the world.'\n\n- Los Angeles Times\n\n'[Yunus's] ideas have already had a great impact on the Third World, and...hearing his appeal for a 'poverty-free world' from the source itself can be as stirring as that all-American myth of bootstrap success.'\n\n- The Washington Post\n\nPublished by Public Affairs visit www.publicaffairs.com Available at http://www.amazon.com/ and http://www.barnesandnoble.com\n\nReviews of the book\n\nWeb links from Google Alerts\n\nYunus Goes Beyond `Microloans'; Grisham, King's Big Print Runs\n\nBloomberg - USA\n\n7 (Bloomberg) -- In 1976, Bangladeshi banker Muhammad Yunus took $27 from his own pocket and loaned it to a group of bamboo-stool makers to help them buy ...\n\nSee all stories on this topic\n\nThursday's Talk Shows\n\nLos Angeles Times - CA,USA\n\n7 and 11 pm KCET 90749, 48497 Charlie Rose Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, founder of Grameen Bank.

Now he has a new idea 'social business' which he believes can eliminate world poverty\n\nMark Hannam\n\nMark Hannam used to be an investment manager. He is chair of Fair Finance, a microfinance company in London\n\nMuhammad Yunus is a modest man with much to be immodest about. In the mid-1970s, he started providing small loans to the poor of Bangladesh and in 1983 he established a bank, which he called Grameen (â€œof the villageâ€ in Bengali). Grameen flourished, and now employs 25,000 people. Every year it lends over $500m in small loans, primarily to women. This â€œmicrocreditâ€ model has been copied all over the developing world, and in 2006 Yunus and Grameen Bank were jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize.\n\nNot content with setting up one business, Yunus has created a series of companies under the Grameen brand name to provide cheap goods and services to the poor: mobile phones, student loans, knitwear, a textile mill, an eye clinic and, most recently, a joint venture with the French company Danone to sell low-cost yoghurt to rural children. Yunus has also written a manifesto for his style of entrepreneurship, which he calls â€œsocial business.â€ This, he claims, will make it possible to put an end to world poverty, and on a shorter timescale than most people think achievable. It is, then, a very big idea, even if he is only partly right about the scale of the benefits involved.\n\nChosun Ilbo (largest Korean daily) . Published on 25 March.
