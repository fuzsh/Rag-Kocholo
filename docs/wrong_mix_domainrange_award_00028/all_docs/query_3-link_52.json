        "text": "PARIS — Bangladeshi economist Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank he created won the Nobel Peace Prize yesterday for leveraging small loans into major social change for impoverished families.\n\nThe Grameen Bank's pioneering use of micro-credit has been duplicated across the globe since Yunus started the project in his home village three decades ago. Loans as low as $9 have helped beggars start small businesses and poor women buy cellular phones and basket-weaving materials.\n\n''Lasting peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty,'' the Norwegian Nobel Committee said in its citation released yesterday in Oslo. ''Micro-credit is one such means.''\n\nThe committee praised Yunus, 66, as ''a leader who has managed to translate visions into practical action for the benefit of millions of people, not only in Bangladesh but across cultures and civilizations.''\n\nIn a telephone interview, Yunus said he was overcome by the excitement of winning the prize after several years of being nominated.\n\n''This prize is so overwhelming, it will affect our work tremendously,'' he said. ''It will bring the issues I'm raising to the attention of people who can make a difference in the world.\n\nYunus said he believes the Nobel committee endorsed his view that bridging the gap between rich and poor countries in an age of increasing globalization is critical to reducing conflict around the world.\n\n''You cannot go on having absurd amounts of wealth when other people have problems of survival,'' he said. ''If you can bring an end to poverty, at least from an economic point of view, you can have a more livable situation between very rich people and very poor people, very rich countries and very poor countries. That's our basic ingredient for peace.''\n\n(Published: October 14, 2006)"
