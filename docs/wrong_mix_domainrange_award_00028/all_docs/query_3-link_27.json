The Grameen Bank offers small loans for self employment for the rural poor, especially poor women.\n\nFor his constant innovation and enterprise, Fortune magazine named Professor Yunus in March 2012 one of the 12 greatest entrepreneurs of our time. In 2010, The New Statesman listed him as one of the world’s 50 most influential figures and in 2006, Time magazine listed him in \"60 years of Asian Heroes\" as one of the top 12 business leaders.\n\nProfessor Yunus is the recipient of more than 50 honorary degrees from universities across 20 countries. He has received 112 awards from 26 countries, including state honors from ten countries.\n\nHe is one of seven individuals to have received the Nobel Peace Prize, the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the United States Congressional Gold Medal. Other notable awards include the Ramon Magsaysay Award, the World Food Prize, the International Simon Bolivar Prize, the Sydney Peace Prize, the Prince of Asturias Award for Concord, and the Seoul Peace Prize.\n\nWithin Bangladesh, he has received the President's Award, the Central Bank Award, and the Independence Day Award—the highest national award. He was the first chair of the Policy Advisory Group of CGAP (Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest), was appointed as an International Goodwill Ambassador for UNAIDS by the UN, and was inducted as a member of the Légion d'Honneur by President Chirac of France.\n\nProfessor Yunus has appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, The Colbert Report, Real Time with Bill Maher, Hardtalk, and The Simpsons.\n\nHe has appeared on the cover of Time magazine and Newsweek."
