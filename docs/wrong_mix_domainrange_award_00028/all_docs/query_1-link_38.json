        "text": "PAUL SOLMAN, NewsHour Economics Correspondent:\n\nIt was in the early '90s that Muhammad Yunus introduced the NewsHour audience to micro-lending — the idea that won him the Nobel Prize last month — micro-loans to Bangladeshi women of less than $100 each to buy straw to weave baskets, flour to bake biscuits.\n\nWe were reporting on an Arkansas micro-lending program based on Yunus' Bangladesh model, lending to the likes of Jesse Pearl Jackson to buy more hair for her hair-weaving business, and grow the Pine Bluff, Arkansas, economy one small loan at a time.\n\nPAUL SOLMAN:\n\nSo every time you have another micro-entrepreneur, you have a little bit more economic growth.\n\nMUHAMMAD YUNUS, Winner of 2006 Nobel Peace Prize: Absolutely. Because once you have a micro-enterprise coming up, you are allowing your person to show his work and her work.\n\nPAUL SOLMAN:\n\nAnd allowing the person to show his or her commitment responsibility. Yunus' Grameen Bank, born and still based in Bangladesh, had more than a million borrowers in the early '90s and a loan repayment rate of better than 98 percent.\n\nWhen our Fred de Sam Lazaro actually went to Bangladesh to see Yunus and his operation in 2001, the repayment rate was the same, but the number of borrowers had passed two million. And Grameen, owned by its borrowers, had branched out into other businesses, like the country's largest cell phone company, reaching out and touching those long isolated from the larger world.\n\nMUHAMMAD YUNUS:\n\nI would say it's about 100 percent enrollment from Grameen families today, and many of them are in colleges, universities coming all the way. So that is very different."
