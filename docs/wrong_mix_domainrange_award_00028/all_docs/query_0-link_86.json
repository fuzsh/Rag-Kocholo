The Nobel Prize for 2006 was awarded to Muhammad Yunus for his innovative ideas in successfully creating and implementing micro-credit lending for the poor through the Grameen Bank that he established in 1983 in Bangladesh.\nThe purpose of this article is to review different assessments of this unique experiment in providing finance to the rural poor and to summarize its economic and financial impact on the issue of women’s empowerment in rural Bangladesh.",
