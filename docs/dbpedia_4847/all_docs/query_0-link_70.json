        "text": "In the continuing saga of \"No, Wade, you're wrong about ECW,\" Don writes:\n\nI'm an avid fan of DDT digest and just wanted to put in my 2 cents about the comments made on ECW. Back when wrestling was overtaken by the likes of the Shark, Renegade, Joe Gomez, and in the WWF with Doink, Diesel, an such and all that garbage, I saw a match with Terry Funk v. Cactus Jack outside at a Florida Rodeo. It was the first time I was exposed to ECW. It also reminded me why I love wrestling so much. Reminded me of Dusty in the Bunkhouse Stampede and Flair's bleach blonde hair just soaked in red and Abdullah the Butcher and the Road Warriors just beating the ever-living hell out of everyone. I was at the Living Dangerously PPV. It was by far the best show any fed has put on in a long time. You say you don't see the ECW style having a future, #1 ECW defined WWF attitude and is everything WWF structures its new image after (look at the hardcore divsion, etc.). Even the WCW with its new G-rating showcases 3 ECW legends (Bam Bam, Raven, Sandman) in hopes of starting their own extreme division. Jericho, Benoit and Melenko (2/3 of the origional triple threat), Taka, Psychosis, Steiners, Foley, Snow, Konan, Mysterio, etc etc etc were all part of it at one point. But in conclusion to say that the ECW style will not have a future is absurdly ridiculous. It is wrestling today.\n\nI certainly don't deny that ECW has been a tremendous influence on the scope of pro wrestling in the 90s, and has launched (or re-launched) the careers of many top stars. They're probably the only truly innovative promotion in the 90s. I don't think any of that is in dispute.\n\nMy contention is that ECW has gotten away from what made it successful. They once offered some of the best pro wrestling around, in addition to innovative, \"extreme\" brawling. However, due to talent raids and booking decisions, their pro wrestling-style content seems to be dropping week by week, and the promotion seems to be moving more and more toward a philosophy of \"how many tables can we put X through?\" and \"What foreign objects do we have left to use in a match?\" And when you build your promotion upon trying to make each spot more risky, more violent, more \"extreme,\" and when you train your fanbase to not be happy unless each spot tops the previous one, there's only so far you can go with that before either you run out of spots that wrestlers are physically able to do, or before people start getting seriously hurt. I think that's ECW's biggest risk right now. They've moved so much into \"extreme,\" while leaving the \"pro wrestling\" style behind, that I think they've passed the point of no return. There are only so many tables you can put a guy through, only so many insane spots. It's my belief that once ECW hits this wall, their fans will start getting bored by the product, because they'll have seen it all before.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I agree that ECW has been the greatest influence on pro wrestling in the 90s, and that they've been the most innovative promotion in recent memory. \"WWF Attitude\" is, of course, a direct lift-off of the ECW style. However, with two giant corporations stealing their wrestlers and, increasingly, their style, and with the dangers I got into above, I still stand by my prediction that ECW's days are numbered."
