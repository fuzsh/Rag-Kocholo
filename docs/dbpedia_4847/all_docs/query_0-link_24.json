        "text": "Now here is an interesting case. Ax (Bill Eadie) wrestled successfully as Bolo Mongol, The Masked Superstar and The Super Machine before donning the face paint. Smash (Barry Darsow) was also making money as Khrusher Khruschev before becoming Smash and had good runs as The Repo Man and The Black Top Bully after. It is hard to argue though that in each case their greatest recognition was together as Demolition.\n\nOriginally looked as Road Warrior knock offs they blazed their own path as a horror movie gone wrong pair that destroyed everything in their path. They weren’t chiseled like the Road Warriors and maybe that is what made them look even scarier; they looked like they really could exist outside the ring. Blessed with the longest reign in WWF World Tag Team history they were also its most popular. They “jumped the shark” with addition of Crush, and had Bill Eadie’s health been a little better, the series of matches against Hawk and Animal in 1990 could have been far more special than it was. Regardless, they were an important tag team when it still mattered.\n\nShould Demolition be in the Hall of Fame?\n\nDefinitely put them in! Maybe, but others deserve it first. Probably not, but it wouldn't be the end of the world. No opinion. No way!\n\nProcessing....\n\nDefinitely put them in! - 95.5%\n\nMaybe, but others deserve it first. - 2.4%\n\nProbably not, but it wouldn't be the end of the world. - 1.1%\n\nNo opinion. - 0%\n\nNo way! - 0.9%"
