He is best known for his various stints with National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and for being a part of tag teams The Powers of Pain with The Warlord and Faces of Fear with Meng.\n\nHis first national exposure was in the NWA territory Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), where Powers of Pain held the World Six-Man Tag Team Championship until they departed the company in 1988 and joined WWF, where they competed in the tag team division until the team was quietly split in 1990.

He is best known by his ring name The Warlord and for his tenures in National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as one half of The Powers of Pain alongside The Barbarian.2\n\nHis first national exposure was in the NWA territory Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), where Powers of Pain held the World Six-Man Tag Team Championship until they departed the company in 1988 and joined WWF, where they competed in the tag team division until the team was quietly split in 1990. Warlord then competed as a singles wrestler until departing in 1992, and had a small stint in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1996, where he briefly reunited with The Barbarian as The Super Assassins.\n\nUpon their arrival in the WWF in June, the Powers were faces, initially managed by Tito Santana,[7][8] and feuded with World Tag Team Champions Demolition (Ax and Smash),[4] who had defeated Strike Force (Santana and Rick Martel) for the title and then injured Martel (kayfabe). Although the Barbarian had already been wearing face paint in JCP, it was at this point that the Warlord began to also use face paint. The Powers were introduced as mercenaries to help Martel and Santana gain revenge on Demolition for both the title loss and the injury to Martel. They were soon after managed by the Baron.[5]\n\nAt Survivor Series, the Powers' team defeated Demolition's team in a tag team elimination match, with the Powers being the sole survivors of their team.[5][9] Near the end of the match, Demolition's manager Mr. Fuji double-crossed them and after they beat him up and left, the Powers came to his aid, gaining Fuji as their manager in the process, in return for which his interference helped the Powers eliminate the last remaining opponents, the Conquistadors.[4][5] Afterwards, the Powers and Fuji celebrated until Demolition returned and drove them from the ring. As a result, the Powers became villains while Demolition became fan favorites.[5] In 1989, Szopinski entered the Royal Rumble as the twenty-first entrant, but lasted only two seconds before being eliminated by Hulk Hogan, setting the record for shortest time spent in a Royal Rumble match. The Powers of Pain teamed with Fuji in a losing effort to Demolition in a match for the World Tag Team Championship.[5]\n\nIn March 1990, The Powers of Pain split, with Fuji selling Barbarian's contract to Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan while selling Warlord's contract to Slick.[5] After the team's split, Warlord received an attire change, where he abandoned his Road Warrior-like reverse mohawk and face paint in favor of a shaved head and a silver metallic Cyborg-style Phantom of the Opera-like half-mask and black armor. He also brought a metal staff topped with a W with him to his matches, and used it as a weapon on occasion. He began a feud with the British Bulldog leading to a match at WrestleMania VII. He was granted a chance at the world title against Hulk Hogan on February 8, 1991, in which he was defeated. He then began a long-running series of matches with the Texas Tornado, which rarely had either man winning. However, he did manage to score a singles victory over a high profile wrestler in Jake Roberts on August 23, 1991. On April 17, 1992, Szopinski lost to Virgil in his final match for the WWF.[10]\n\n​UTB Talent Management / Universal Talent Bookings presents newest client - Wrestling Legend - Ricky \"THE DRAGON\" Steamboat -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lXRwapS8R0\n\n[available for Theatrical and Commercial bookings, paid interviews, motivational speaking engagements and appearances] . - former NWA World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion having defeated Ric Flair for the title at Chi-Town Rumble 89 -https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xz7ctr , former WWE Intercontinental Champion having defeated Randy Savage for the title in what is considered the greatest WrestleMania match in History at WrestleMania III - https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xl1nor Ric Flair two out of three Falls at Clash Of Champions https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xl2265 Vs Ric Flair in WrestleWar in 89 -https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xz7hmg in what is considered the greatest series of matches in wrestling history . - https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x30dkg3 .

Following Survivor Series 1990 the \"C-team\" house shows were no longer taking place and many wrestlers left television following the event. The move left Pat Tanaka without a partner in The Orient Express. The WWF decided to reunite the team known as Badd Company, only this time with Paul Diamond wearing a mask to hide the fact that he was not Asian and using the name of Kato.[9] During this time, the team had a very well received match with their old enemies the Rockers at the 1991 Royal Rumble,[15] and another acclaimed match against the New Foundation at the 1992 Royal Rumble,[16] which were the only PPV appearances for the New Orient Express. Kato spent a great deal of the 1992 campaign flying solo, posting a notable victory over The Brooklyn Brawler at Maple Leaf Gardens on February 9, 1992, in addition to collecting wins against the likes of grinders such as Jim Powers, Phil Apollo, JW Storm, Kid Collins, and Dale Wolfe. He also would serve as the first opponent for the re-debut of Crush under his \"Kona Crush\" persona.\n\nSato briefly rejoined the team in 1991 to team with Tanaka and Kato for a series of 6-man tag-team matches on WWF house shows,] but left the WWF after only a handful of matches. Tanaka would leave the WWF in early 1992.[18] Diamond continued to wrestle as Kato until that October, primarily being used as an enhancement talent.\n\nMax Moon (1992-1993)In the fall of 1992, Diamond got a brand new gimmick in \"Maximillian Moon\" (\"Max Moon\" for short). Diamond wasn't originally intended to play Max Moon. The gimmick was created for Konnan, but Konnan left the WWF after a backstage disagreement. Since Diamond fit the costume, he was chosen to take over the character.[ The suit was a very elaborate powder blue bodysuit with markings that were supposed to look like a circuit board and white protruding rings around his arms making him look rather \"outlandish\". The elaborate outfit also came with two wrist devices that shot out fireworks and a jet pack that was supposed to make Max Moon look like a man of the future.\n\nDiamond (as Max Moon) would wrestle and defeat Terry Taylor in a series of house show matches during the rest of 1992, but otherwise, his biggest victories came against Rick Martel and Repo Man, both by disqualification. On the December 7, 1992 episode of WWF Prime Time Wrestling, Max Moon teamed with High Energy (Owen Hart and Koko B. Ware) in a six-man tag team match against The Beverly Brothers and The Genius. Max Moon and High Energy won the match when Moon pinned The Genius.\n\nOn January 11, 1993, Max Moon wrestled and lost an Intercontinental Championship match to former tag team partner/longtime rival Shawn Michaels on the very first Monday Night Raw. The loss to Michaels was a sign of things to come for the Max Moon gimmick as he began losing to midcarders such as Skinner. The Max Moon gimmick only appeared at one PPV, participating in the 30 Man Elimination match at the 1993 Royal Rumble, where he was in the ring less than 2 minutes. In late February, Paul Diamond's contract with the WWF expired and was not renewed.\n\nNick Dinsmore / f/k/a - Eugene - also known by his World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) ring name Eugene, is an American professional wrestler.\n\nDinsmore began his career in 1996 and was assigned to NWA-Ohio Valley Wrestling, later becoming Ohio Valley Wrestling. OVW became WWE's farm territory and, during his time there, Dinsmore won a record of eight times the OVW Heavyweight Champion as well as the OVW Southern Tag Team Champion eleven times. When he was called to the main roster, he debuted as Eugene Dinsmore, Eric Bischoff's nephew. Eugene was involved in a storyline with Evolution, facing Triple H at SummerSlam. He also won the World Tag Team Championship with William Regal. Eugene would stay with WWE until 2007, including a feud with Kurt Angle where he won his gold medal, having a match against him at SummerSlam.\n\nDinsmore would be released in 2007. He returned to OVW, where he won the Heavyweight Championships two more times. He made a brief return to WWE in 2013, but he was released the next year. In 2015, he opened his own promotion, Midwest All Pro Wrestling.\n\nSince its WWE debut, the \"Eugene\" character was met with negative reception due to its offensive portrayal of a mentally disabled person.\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment (2004–2007)Teaming with William Regal (2004–2005)On the April 5, 2004 episode of Raw, Dinsmore made his World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) debut as Eugene. He was portrayed as the \"special\" and overly excited nephew of Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff, who had savant-like wrestling ability from watching his favorites on television. Bischoff soon placed him under the care of the newly returned William Regal. Although Regal was originally dispirited at having to manage Eugene, he would grow fond of him and the two would quickly become firm friends. In May 2004, Eugene began a feud with Jonathan Coachman, who attempted to banish him from WWE (only to be stopped by The Rock). The feud culminated in Eugene's pay-per-view debut, when he defeated Coachman at Bad Blood. Eugene then feuded with Triple H,[1] which led to match at SummerSlam, which Eugene lost. Two weeks later on Raw, they fought a no disqualification match, which Eugene won after interference from Randy Orton. The next week, they had a steel cage match, which Eugene lost and suffered a kayfabe dislocated shoulder, ending the feud.\n\nAfter taking a few weeks off to sell his injuries, he feuded with his uncle, Eric Bischoff. This led to a match at the first-ever Taboo Tuesday pay-per-view on October 19. The fan-chosen (via voting at WWE's website) stipulation for the match was that the loser would have his head shaved. Eugene won this match (with help from Mr. McMahon) and subsequently shaved Bischoff's head.\n\nWith Regal, Eugene won his first and only championship in WWE, taking the World Tag Team Championship from La Résistance on the November 15 episode of Raw. Eugene suffered an injury at New Year's Revolution on January 9, 2005, in a match with Christian and Tyson Tomko, after botching a dropkick. Although they won the match, he suffered a ruptured left patellar ligament, which required surgery and sidelined him for six months. This also cost him the World Tag Team Championship, which Regal lost to La Résistance when forced to defend at a house show on January 16, teamed with Jonathan Coachman as a substitute. During recovery, Eugene made a surprise appearance at WrestleMania 21, delivering a promo until being interrupted and attacked by Muhammad Hassan and Daivari. He would be saved by returning Hulk Hogan, after he attacked the villainous duo.\n\nSingles competition (2005–2006)Eugene returned to wrestling on the July 25, 2005 episode of Raw, taking part in Kurt Angle's regular \"Kurt Angle Invitational\" challenge. Eugene defeated Angle, winning his cherished Olympic gold medal (per match stipulation), and starting a feud between the two. The feud culminated at SummerSlam, where Angle defeated Eugene to regain his medal. Eugene then briefly teamed with Tajiri (who, incidentally, had also previously teamed with William Regal). The team lasted until Tajiri's release in December 2005.\n\nAt Taboo Tuesday, Rob Conway teamed with Tyson Tomko to face Eugene and a \"WWE Legend\", to be chosen by the fans. \"Superfly\" Jimmy Snuka was chosen over Kamala and \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan, and pinned Conway with his Superfly Splash to win the match.\n\nOn November 18, 2005, WWE.com reported Dinsmore was rushed to the hospital the previous night, after passing out in a hotel lobby in Manchester, and was suspended indefinitely. Days later, WWE.com stated Dinsmore admitted to taking prescription drugs, including somas. This coincided with the announcement of WWE's new drug policy (established as a result of Eddie Guerrero's death from heart failure, aggravated by his past history of drug abuse).\n\nEugene made his return to WWE in the Royal Rumble match at the namesake event on January 29, 2006, as the eighteenth entrant. He was eliminated by Chris Benoit.[1] At WrestleMania 22, Eugene competed in a preshow battle royal which was won by Viscera. Eugene briefly feuded with Matt Striker, after appearing in the \"Matt Striker's Classroom\" segment of Backlash on April 30, 2006.[18] Striker ultimately defeated Eugene to end the feud. After appearing at ECW One Night Stand,[18] Eugene formed a tag team with \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan.[1] He challenged Umaga to a match at Vengeance and lost, despite having Duggan, Doink the Clown, and Kamala in his corner.[18] He defeated Vince McMahon and Shane McMahon in a handicap match on the July 10 Raw, after interference from D-Generation X.[19] On the September 4 Raw, Eugene and Duggan challenged World Tag Team Champions the Spirit Squad for the title, but were unsuccessful. The team split up on the November 6 Raw. After losing a rematch to The Spirit Squad, Eugene attacked Duggan, turning heel.[20] However, the angle was soon dropped and, before the end of the year, Eugene became a face again. After this, he wrestled mainly on the Raw B-show, Heat.\n\nBrand switches and departure (2007)[edit]\n\nDinsmore in 2007On the March 19, 2007 episode of Raw, Eugene was forced into a match with Umaga, as a punishment for accidentally spilling a drink on Vince McMahon. After losing, McMahon shaved Eugene's head.[21] Eugene wrestled on the June 2, 2007 Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIV, where he debuted a new \"Superman-esque\" wrestling attire. He teamed with Kane and Doink The Clown to defeat Kevin Thorn, Viscera, and Umaga.[22]\n\nOn June 17, Eugene was drafted to the SmackDown! brand as their final pick of the 2007 Supplemental Draft.[23] On the June 29 episode of SmackDown!, Eugene debuted for the brand, losing to The Great Khali. The following week, he was tricked into thinking Deuce 'n Domino were helping him win his match against Mark Henry, which led to a quick defeat.\n\nOn the July 20 episode of SmackDown!, Eugene participated in a battle royal for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship, and was eliminated by Batista and Kane. Eugene made his final WWE appearance on the August 31 edition of SmackDown!. While shooting T-shirts into the crowd via T-shirt gun, he accidentally shot Mark Henry. Henry retaliated by squeezing him with a bearhug until he passed out. On September 1, 2007, Nick Dinsmore was released from his WWE contract.\n\nReturns to WWE (2009, 2013-2014)In July 2009, Dinsmore signed a contract to return to WWE. On August 1, Dinsmore (as Eugene) defeated Ricky Ortiz at a SmackDown/ECW house show in Manchester, New Hampshire. On the August 10 Raw, Eugene returned to television, losing a Contract on a Pole match to The Calgary Kid, who afterwards removed his mask to reveal himself as The Miz. Four days later, Dinsmore was once again released from WWE, as a wrestler and a trainer.[36] Dinsmore was re-hired by WWE on September 20, 2013, as trainer on NXT, and he lasted a year before he was released on October 2, 2014.\n\nJamal Mustafa (born Terrance Ladd Blalock); is an American professional wrestler, better known by his ring name, Mustafa Saed. He is best known for his appearances with Smoky Mountain Wrestling and Extreme Championship Wrestling in the 1990s.\n\nSmoky Mountain Wrestling (1994–1995)See also: The GangstasIn 1994 at Smokey Mountain Wrestling, the pairing of Saed, New Jack and, for a brief time, D'Lo Brown were collectively known as The Gangstas. A controversial gimmick, the Gangstas would cut promos about activist Medgar Evers and O. J. Simpson to infuriate the southern white crowd, they would also use fried chicken and watermelons as props and would win matches via only a two count rather than the conventional three count purportedly due to Affirmative Action. The Gangstas would feud with The Rock 'n' Roll Express for several months in chase of the SMW Tag Team Championship which they would eventually win on October 3 but would lose the titles back the Rock 'n' Roll Express two months later. After the loss, the Gangstas would feud with teams such as Tony Anthony and Tracy Smothers and The Heavenly Bodies. In 1995 The Gangstas, now consisting of only Saed and New Jack, left SMW in a controversial fashion which escalated the long-standing dispute between Paul Heyman and Jim Cornette.\n\nExtreme Championship Wrestling (1995–1997, 1999)See also: The GangstasMaking their Extreme Championship Wrestling debut on June 27 at Barbed Wire, Hoodies & Chokeslams, and their Hardcore TV debut on July 20, the Gangstas would quickly become faces and a draw for ECW, regularly bringing weapons such as guitars, crutches and staple guns in trash cans and shopping carts to the ring. The Gangstas would enter a lengthy feud with the Public Enemy that would last until the beginning of 1996 where the Public Enemy would beat the Gangstas in a street fight. Several months later the Gangstas would feud with the Eliminators, challenging them for the ECW World Tag Team Championship on several occasions before finally winning them on August 3 at The Doctor Is In. Although they lost the titles several months later in December, they would become two-time champions on July 19, 1997 at Heat Wave. Following the loss of the second championship, Saed split with New Jack and left ECW.\n\nSaed would return to ECW on February 12, 1999 at Crossing the Line '99 in Queens, New York. Mustafa reunited with New Jack to battle the Dudley Boys, only for Mustafa to attack his partner, revealing himself as the mysterious benefactor who wanted to run the Public Enemy and New Jack out of ECW. Now known as Mr. Mustafa, he would be defeated by New Jack at Living Dangerously 1999 and leave the company again by May.\n\nChampionships and accomplishments[edit]\n\nAll Pro Wrestling\n\nAPW/Vendetta Pro Unified Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Boyce LeGrande[5]\n\nAPW Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Boyce LeGrande\n\nCoastal Pro Wrestling\n\nCPW Television Championship (1 time)[1]\n\nExtreme Championship Wrestling\n\nECW World Tag Team Championship (2 times) - with New Jack[3]\n\nExtreme Wrestling Alliance\n\nEWA Heavyweight Championship (3 times)[1]\n\nNorth Georgia Wrestling Alliance\n\nNGWA Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with New Jack[1]\n\nPro Wrestling Bushido\n\nPWB Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Cjay Kurz\n\nPro Wrestling Illustrated\n\nRanked No. 427 of the 500 best singles wrestlers during the PWI Years in 2003\n\nSmoky Mountain Wrestling\n\nSMW Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with New Jack[1]\n\nSupreme Pro Wrestling\n\nSPW Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with RJ Bishop\n\nVendetta Pro Wrestling\n\nUnified Tag-Team Championship (1 time) - with Boyce LeGrande[5]\n\nWorld Wrestling Council\n\nWWC Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship (1 time)[1]\n\nWWC World Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Rastaman[1]\n\nWWC World Television Championship (1 time)[1\n\nRobert Ross {f/k/a - Ranger Ross} is a former World Championship Wrestling (WCW) professional wrestler and former United States Army Ranger known by his ring name, Ranger Ross.

Schultz had a notorious encounter on December 28, 1984, with 20/20 reporter John Stossel while Stossel was backstage at Madison Square Garden doing a story about professional wrestling's secrets. During an interview Stossel told Schultz that he thought pro wrestling was fake and Schultz's response was to hit Stossel in the head twice, knocking him to the floor each time. The attack, which attracted a large amount of media coverage, was later aired on national television including ABC News which reported that the network had received more than 1,000 calls from viewers inquiring about Stossel's health.

He would tour the United Kingdom under the name \"American Hawkwind.\n\nIn 1993, Danenhauer joined World Championship Wrestling as The Equalizer, and teamed briefly with Rick Rude as his tag team partner/bodyguard. They feuded with Dustin Rhodes and Road Warrior Hawk.[5] He also teamed with Paul Orndorff.[1]\n\nHis biggest push started in the summer of 1994 when he became \"Dave Sullivan\" the dyslexic brother of Kevin Sullivan who regularly mispronounced his own forename as \"Evad\". He was being picked on by The Nasty Boys and brought Kevin in to help him against them. He was injured by them, so Kevin Sullivan brought in Cactus Jack to help them out. After Kevin and Jack took care of The Nasty Boys, they split up, and Jack left. Hulk Hogan made his WCW debut that summer, and Sullivan became his biggest fan. Kevin hated Hogan, and problems started brewing.[6]\n\nSullivan started teaming with Hogan and Sting against Ric Flair and his henchmen, and Kevin soon turned on Dave, which started a feud that went into 1995. After his feud with Kevin ended, Dave fell in love with Kimberly, the valet of Diamond Dallas Page. Page took offense to this and started a feud with Dave that lasted all summer. During this feud, Dave gave Kimberly presents, which infuriated Page even more, and at point won an arm wrestling contest at the 1995 Great American Bash which resulted in him going on a date with Kimberly. Sullivan eventually lost the feud and moved on.[6]\n\nSullivan's next feud was with Big Bubba Rogers. Sullivan had a pet rabbit that he brought to ringside with him, and Bubba was allergic to rabbits. Bubba started wearing a surgical mask to keep from inhaling the allergens, but Sullivan would always pull it off and get the victory.

The grungy sociopath terrorized opponents and fans alike in major wrestling organizations, including WWE, WCW and the original incarnation of ECW.\n\nRaven may have looked like a roadie for Pearl Jam, but he had the brains to become one of the ring’s most influential leaders. With an IQ of more than 140, the gutter punk became a member of Mensa and used his intellect to recruit a cult of followers when Stevie Richards brought him to ECW in 1995. Surrounded by converts like Richards, Blue Meanie, The Pitbulls and Cactus Jack, the sadistic messiah became a villainous idol in Philadelphia by employing a mesmerizing blend of an indomitable demeanor and glib prose. His signature signoff became Edgar Allen Poe’s elegant line, “Quoth the Raven, ‘Nevermore.’”\n\nThe master manipulator first targeted his former summer camp rival Tommy Dreamer, who had been a popular jock while Raven was a social outcast. “For three years, I’d never beat him,” Dreamer said of the man who once broke his fingers in the ring. “Every time I’d come so close, I’d somehow not pull it off.” It wasn’t until two years of battles later that Dreamer finally defeated his longtime rival at Wrestlepalooza 1997, Raven's final night in his first ECW tenure.\n\nThe Sandman, whom Raven twice defeated for the ECW World Championship, became the deranged mastermind’s most emotionally affected victim. In 1996, Raven became involved with The Sandman’s ex-wife and brainwashed The Hardcore Icon’s own 7-year-old son Tyler, who adopted Raven’s wardrobe, mannerisms and phrases and told him, “I love you more than my own daddy.” At one event, the charismatic miscreant assaulted The Sandman in such an offensive manner that Kurt Angle, who was in attendance, stormed out of the ECW Arena in disgust. Raven was later forced to publicly apologize for the brutalization.\n\nAfter arriving in WCW, Raven recruited competitors like Perry Saturn and Billy Kidman to join his sect, now called The Flock. He defeated Diamond Dallas Page for the United States Championship and competed in memorable matches against Goldberg and Chris Jericho before returning to his Extreme roots. Raven’s second tenure in ECW was brief, as he signed with WWE in 2000, where he became a record 26-time Hardcore Champion by defeating Superstars like Big Show and Bradshaw before parting ways with WWE in January 2003.\n\n“I loved Raven,” Paul Heyman once proclaimed. “Raven motivated me. He inspired me. He could do anything, embrace it and had a passion for it — the likes of which I’d never seen before and may never see again.”\n\n​Wrestling Legend - Brutus “The Barber” Beefcake\n\nAs the flamboyant hairdresser who clipped the locks of WWE rivals in the ’80s and early ’90s with his trademark shears, Brutus “The Barber” Beefcake was all about two things — cuttin’ and struttin’.\n\nA marquee Superstar during WWE’s national expansion in the 1980s, The Barber battled rivals like The Honky Tonk Man and Mr. Perfect and competed in main event matches alongside his good friend, Hulk Hogan, at SummerSlam ’89 and WrestleMania IX.

He trained with Gagne's father Verne, alongside wrestlers including Ric Flair, Ken Patera, and The Iron Sheik.\n\nHe began wrestling in various territories in the early 1970s, most notably in the NWA Central States promotion. There, he teamed with Mike George to win the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship on October 25, 1973.. Following this, he returned to Minnesota and joined Gagne's promotion, the American Wrestling Association (AWA). He formed a tag team with Greg Gagne known as \"The High Flyers\". The duo won the AWA World Tag Team Championship on July 7, 1977, by defeating Blackjack Lanza and Bobby Duncum. They held the championship for more than a year, until September 23, 1978, when they were stripped of the championship as Brunzell had suffered an injury. In 1979, Brunzell transferred to the Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (MACW) promotion, where he twice won the NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship. He returned to the AWA in 1981, and on June 14, The High Flyers regained the championship by defeating The East-West Connection (Jesse Ventura and Adrian Adonis). In the mid-1980s, Brunzell wrestled in Montreal for International Wrestling.\n\nWorld Wrestling Federation (1985–1993)\n\nThe Killer Bees (1985–1988)\n\nSee also: The Killer Bees\n\nBrunzell signed to wrestle with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as they continued their national expansion. He was paired with another WWF newcomer, Brian Blair (though, Blair had already wrestled in the WWF before) as The Killer Bees.The Killer Bees were faces, but were original as the first faces to wear masks and switch places behind the referee's back. Brunzell and Blair had moderate success in the WWF. They feuded with such teams as The Hart Foundation as well as the Funks, Jimmy Jack Funk and Hoss Funk, whom they faced in front of over 74,000 fans at The Big Event. Their stay was also highlighted with a match against Nikolai Volkoff and The Iron Sheik as part of WrestleMania III, and a win at the inaugural Survivor Series on Thanksgiving Day 1987. The Killer Bees teamed together until they were separated off-screen by the management team. Their final match came against The Young Stallions on August 28, 1988.\n\nSingles competition (1988–1993)\n\nFollowing the breakup of Killer Bees, Brunzell was immediately programmed into a house show series with the newly arrived Curt Hennig that began in September, and began working mainly as a jobber. Brunzell was winless against Mr. Perfect, including a singles match that aired on Prime Time Wrestling on October 4, 1988. On September 24, Brunzell gained his first victory in a nascent singles career when he defeated Danny Davis in Lexington, Kentucky. The following month Brunzell was shifted to house show matches against another newly arrived wrestler in the WWF, Terry Taylor. Again, Brunzell was winless in competition against Taylor, as well as King Haku. Brunzell was still known for one of the best dropkicks in the WWF, and in a losing match against Randy Savage, the Macho Man got a bloody mouth after getting hit by one.\n\nOn the November 5, 1988 edition of Prime Time Wrestling Jim Brunzell was announced as a participant in the Survivor Series, replacing Don Muraco. His former partner B. Brian Blair was also placed on the show, replacing The Junkyard Dog. Despite this seeming boost, Brunzell continued to struggle on television. He was defeated again by Curt Hennig on Prime Time Wrestling, as well as by King Haku. At the 1988 Survivor Series Brunzell was pinned by Bad News Brown; however, his team did come out victorious. After this Brunzell took a sabbatical from the company.\n\nIn 1989 Brunzell would only wrestle twice in the WWF, defeating \"Iron\" Mike Sharpe in June and losing to Bad News Brown in November.[8] The following year he made a full-time return and defeated Frenchy Martin on his first match back on February 18, 1990 in Chicago, IL. Brunzell however was now an opening level wrestler, albeit one with strong name recognition. He entered into an unsuccessful house show series with Rick Martel in April, while making his return to television on the May 14 edition of Prime Time Wrestling in a match against Curt Hennig. As he entered the summer he would appear on television against Dino Bravo and The Orient Express. On the July 16, 1990 edition of Prime Time Wrestling he finally gained his first televised victory since the breakup of the Killer Bees when he pinned Black Bart.\n\nAll traces of his former Killer Bees gimmick were now gone, and Brunzell would wear tie-dye trunks, adopted the \"Crank It Up\" theme song that had been used by The Young Stallions and was still being used by Jim Powers. It was with Powers that Brunzell would team with on August 9, 1990 on Prime Time Wrestling against Power and Glory (Powers's only televised match against his former partner). This month was also Brunzell's most successful since 1988, as he scored victories against Buddy Rose, Steve Lombardi, and Bob Bradley. He continued to fare well against opening level competition throughout the fall and winter.[9]\n\nBrunzell's appearances became much more limited in 1991 as he wrestled only seventeen dates, all winless efforts against upper level competition like Irwin R. Schyster, The Warlord, and The Barbarian.[10] However in 1992 he became a regular again and made his first television appearance in over a year when he appeared in a battle royal that aired on Prime Time Wrestling on April 20. Brunzell began tag-teaming consistently again for the first time in almost four years when he replaced the departed Jim Neidhart and teamed with Owen Hart. Hart and Brunzell were victorious in multiple encounters against The Beverly Brothers in March. Brunzell also received a non-title match against WWF World Champion Ric Flair on the March to WrestleMania show.\n\nThe teaming with Owen was short-lived, and Brunzell returned to singles competition as spring commenced. Brunzell was victorious in two dark match tryouts for Rochester Roadblock in April, and appeared in a 40-man battle royal that aired on Prime Time Wrestling in June 1992. That month Brunzell began teaming with Jim Powers once more, losing to The Beverly Brothers and The Nasty Boys, and defeating Duane Gill and Barry Hardy. Later that summer he returned once more to singles competition, facing Paul Diamond, Skinner, and Steve Lombardi. On October 5, 1992 edition of Prime Time Wrestling Brunzell faced Terry Taylor in the latter's return to the WWF.[11]\n\nOn the January 3, 1993 edition of Prime Time Wrestling Brunzell received a shot against Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels. A day later he wrestled on the international version of WWF Superstars and scored his first televised victory of the year when he pinned Bill Irwin. In February 1993 he was programmed into a house show series against The Predator (Horace Hogan) and was again victorious in every encounter. However despite hoping to work for the WWF as a producer/booker for the WWF, he wrestled his final WWF match in April 1993, episode of Monday Night Raw where he was defeated by newcomer Damien Demento.\n\n​Motch O Mann aka Vic D.

He is known to be the first man in history to bench press over 700 pounds in competition, establishing an official world record\n\nPowerlifting/Bench press world record\n\nTed Arcidi bench pressed 705.5 pounds (320 kg) on March 3, 1985 at Gus Rethwisch's Budweiser World Record Breakers in Honolulu, Hawaii for an APF & USPF world record, to become the first man to bench 700 pounds in an officially recognized powerlifting competition.[1][2][3] Then, after being 5 1/2 years away from competition due to his wrestling career, he made the comeback of the decade.[citation needed] Weighing 291 pounds, Arcidi set another world record with an amazing 718.1 lbs bench press at the APF Bench Press Invitational on September 30, 1990, in Keene, New Hampshire.[4] On September 14, 1991, at a Mr. Olympia contest, he squared off face to face with his greatest rival Anthony Clark to determine who the greatest bench presser of the world was. Arcidi defeated the much bigger Clark (5'8\", 375 lbs) by pressing 725 pounds off his chest to establish yet a new, but controversial, world record.[5] That attempt was later disqualified after it was revealed that Arcidi had failed to lock out his arms due to bone spurs in his elbows which he had corrected with surgery.[4]\n\nArcidi's 705 pound all-time world record bench press was performed in one of the earliest bench shirts - an original prototype supportive bench press shirt, which was 50% polyester and 50% cotton and only one layer thick.[6] It was thus later categorized as \"equipped\", although it did not improve his bench by much, if anything.[6] In 1984 Arcidi had benched an official 666.9 pounds (302.5 kg) at 286.0 pounds bodyweight completely raw, without a bench shirt in Honolulu, Hawaii as well.[7] He can be considered as arguably one of the greatest bench pressers of all time.[5]\n\nPersonal records\n\nDone in official powerlifting full meets\n\nRaw bench press:\n\n666.9 lbs (302.5 kg) @308 lb class (286 lb bodyweight)[8] raw without wrist wraps (1984 Honolulu, Hawaii) (USPF/APF/WPC)\n\n650.4 lbs (295.0 kg) @275 lb class (275 lb bodyweight)[8] raw without wrist wraps (1983 Westminster, Maryland) (NSM)\n\n→ current all-time raw (unequipped) bench press world records in the 308lb and 275lb classref [9] (have never been surpassed since the 1980s)\n\nDone in official bench-only invitational meet\n\nEquipped bench press: 718.1 lbs (325.7 kg) @308 lb class (291 lb bodyweight) in an early bench shirt (1990 Keene, New Hampshire) (APF)\n\n→ former all-time bench press world record regardless of weight class and equipment\n\nProfessional wrestling career\n\nArcidi lifted for several years and eventually was sought by and debuted in Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in late 1985.[1] Arcidi faced other \"strongmen\" such as Tony Atlas and Hercules Hernandez during his stint and made a single appearance at WrestleMania 2 in the WWF/NFL Battle Royal.[1] During his time in the WWF in 1986, Arcidi wrestled veteran Big John Studd at the Boston Garden. During the match, Studd was noticeably wrestling stiff and showing contempt for someone he saw as nothing more than a weightlifter with no wrestling skills who had no business being in a professional wrestling ring.\n\nArcidi was released by the WWF upon the return of former Olympic \"strongman\" Ken Patera (who was returning after a 2-year stint in prison) as Vince McMahon did not want to have issues with having two men billed as the \"World's Strongest Man\". Although his tenure was brief, Arcidi did have an action figure produced by LJN for their Wrestling Superstars toy line. Patera had been instrumental in Arcidi's signing with Titan Sports-WWF. His final match was against Jake Roberts on February 14, 1987 in Calgary, Alberta.[10]\n\nAfter his WWF run, he went to Calgary and briefly worked for Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling. After that, Arcidi moved on the World Class Championship Wrestling in Dallas, Texas, where he was known as \"Mr. 705\" (referring to his world record bench press). He was managed by Percival Pringle III and was part of a stable of wrestlers including Rick Rude, the Dingo Warrior and Cactus Jack Manson. Arcidi captured that organization's Texas Heavyweight Championship on August 31, 1987 and held it until he lost to Matt Borne on November 10 that same year. Arcidi left the organization in 1990 to pursue other endeavors. He made several appearances in the Caribbean but never came back to national status\n\nMarc Mero [f/k/a - Johnny B Badd The Wildman Marc Mero} is an American former amateur boxer and professional wrestler, as well as a motivational speaker.

He is best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation [WWE} and World Championship Wrestling in the 1980s and 1990s under the ring names Mike Rotunda, Michael Wallstreet, Irwin R. Schyster, and V.K. Wallstreet. Rotunda and Barry Windham joined the World Wrestling Federation as The U.S. Express in 1984, during which time he would be billed as Mike Rotundo rather than Rotunda. They won the WWF World Tag Team Championship twice, first from Dick Murdoch and Adrian Adonis in January 1985. The US Express' most notable feud was with The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff, to whom they lost the title at the first WrestleMania. The US Express regained the belts in June 1985, but lost them two months later to Brutus Beefcake and Greg Valentine.. World Wrestling Federation\n\nSingles competition (1991–1992)\n\nRotunda returned to the WWF in April 1991, becoming Irwin R. Schyster, abbreviated to I.R.S.. Schyster had a heel gimmick as a former IRS tax collector from Washington, D.C., harassing wrestlers and fans as \"tax cheats\" and scolding them to \"pay their fair share\". For example, at a show in Rhode Island, he attacked the state for being a tax haven for yacht owners from New York, or when wrestling in New Hampshire, he would get on the microphone and criticize the fans there for not having to pay a state income tax. To further add to this persona, one of his finishing moves was called The Write-Off (i.e., a flying clothesline to an oncoming opponent).\n\nHe made his pay-per-view debut at SummerSlam 1991, defeating Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine. Schyster also made it to the finals of the 1991 King of the Ring tournament, defeating The Berzerker, Hacksaw Jim Duggan and Jerry Sags before losing to Bret Hart in the final match. He then had a short-lived feud with Big Bossman in the fall of 1991. This culminated in a 6-man elimination tag team match at Survivor Series, where he teamed with The Natural Disasters in a losing effort against Bossman and The Legion of Doom (the former Road Warriors).

They then feuded with the Natural Disasters, losing the titles to them and then regaining them a few months later. Finally, in spring 1993, Money Inc. entered into a months long feud with The Steiner Brothers, and in June the two teams traded the titles three times in ten days, with DiBiase and IRS losing the tag team title twice to the Steiners. Ted DiBiase retired from wrestling to become a commentator in the summer of 1993, resulting in Schyster going back to singles competition after a final attempt to reclaim the tag-titles in a cage match in the lead-up to Summerslam '93 in a losing effort against the Steiners.\n\nMillion Dollar Corporation (1994–1995)\n\nMain article: Million Dollar Corporation\n\nIn the begi"
