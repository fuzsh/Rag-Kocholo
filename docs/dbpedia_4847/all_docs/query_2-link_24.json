        "text": "Welcome back to another edition of the Wrestling Sandwich! I’m sure we’ll be dealing with a whole host of topics, as well as the results of last week’s question about what three things would you change if you could in the WWE and also, what three things did you all rate as the biggest problems right now? Answers will be a bit later on and I must admit, some very good objective analysis, as I know most fans on 411 are WWE fans/marks/smarks and honestly, I’m happy to see some critical thinking on the subject. After all, if you are a WWE fan, they need your help to get out of the rut they have been in and bring back the high ratings from earlier this year. Just as I prefer to watch TNA and support them, the WWE fans need to support and help WWE. Competition, by the way, is a good thing and someday perhaps we’ll see a real Monday Night War again.\n\nApparently the last column had so many people commenting about things the discussion software broke, and I can’t say I’m sorry that it happened since it keeps blocking a lot of posts that have nothing wrong with them. I myself responded on my staff account to somebody’s article and it didn’t go through despite it basically being “good column!” and other people have mailed me to tell me “The comments are being blocked” and such. I’ve forwarded the concerns to the management, and hopefully they’ll fix it. I’ve also requested that people be allowed to express themselves more on the comments regardless if it is good or bad, but I’m only a writer and frankly seeing how much work goes into the website daily, I’m extremely happy to stay in this particular job!\n\nUnfortunately I am the only major pro-TNA columnist on 411 right now. So I get comments like “WELL WHY DON’T YOU REPORT WHEN TNA GOES DOWN IN THE RATINGS?” and people just don’t realize things such as WWE dropping under a 3.0 for a live RAW before a PPV isn’t usual, while TNA fluctuates between 1.0 and 1.3 often. So it goes from 1.27 to a 1.11 – That’s not news. RAW gets a 2.4 on a holiday and only garners 0.5 back the next week? That’s news. Just like if suddenly American Idol received 5th place on its debut show when it usually takes #1 without question. It isn’t defending TNA ratings, as I know they are lower than RAW and Smackdown, it is just that unless TNA drops under a 1.0 or goes over a 1.4 it isn’t anything to write about yet.\n\nSome of you have read my piece last week about the financials, and while most of the people who continue to bash me believe as they always have, those who actually know a little about what I was talking about understand I wasn’t looking at numbers as much as “beyond” the numbers. Thank you for your support. And as far as exaggerating numbers? I may not make a killing every day but I have some good instincts. If everybody behaves enough I might even slip you a couple of tips this year, we’ll see. Maybe. The most important thing I can tell you? Never believe anybody who tells you anything about any “tips” until you research it. Sometimes people giving you tips work for the company they are telling you to buy, or at least are great friends with the CEO/CFO/etc. The best way to guarantee profit for you is research, research, and research. Don’t let up and don’t take anybody’s talking points at face value, even mine. Always question, always validate.\n\nAlso in this week’s edition of the Sandwich we celebrate the greatness of the New World Order, the faction and angle that changed wrestling forever with a match and promo to go along with the July Bash at the Beach event fifteen years ago that started it all.\n\nI am considering, after the results of last week’s little question, having a special “You Take 5” feature later in the year where you guys will give me what YOU want to see for the take 5 section: The wrestler, the babe, the match, the promo, and a mystery section idea. Once again when you take your poison pens to excoriate me in the comments please also add if you think that is a good idea or not in between the death threats and basement dweller jokes.\n\nTop Stories of the Week!\n\n1. Triple H is a Triple Fail\n\nAs the world knows by now, The Nose returned on RAW to become the kayfabe “boss” of the WWE. Basically, when a corporation has a board of directors and they vote the CEO out with “no-confidence” it is the same as being fired as it means the company directors have no faith in the leader to conduct good business. While this should have really happened from when the stock dove under $15, HHH is taking the leadership role and will be the “boss” for the foreseeable future, no doubt to test his skill as an authority figure both backstage and on the air. However, HHH already has three failures on his real executive career.\n\nFirstly, we all know about Kharma getting pregnant and the entire Diva killing angle being scrapped for at least a year. Then, news erupted earlier this week that Sin Cara flunked the Wellness testing originally on June 20th but it was delayed almost A FULL MONTH to allow him to compete in Money in the Bank’s PPV. I thought this was the company strict on drug policies? Rumors are flying about what exactly Cara was taking and some even think this may be the end of his WWE run considering he’s basically been a botch machine thus far. So when it comes to hires, HHH is 0 for 2 and not looking to improve anytime soon.\n\nHis third failure comes as he assumes the role of the on-air boss. See, nobody that actually is into the WWE product believes for one second Vince is not running things in some fashion or that he won’t attempt to try and take his job back on-air. HHH is also not a popular guy on the internet, although I still think he’s the smartest guy politically that ever wrestled: This is the man who went from being in the top clique that worked in the top company to the guy marrying the boss’ daughter and ensuring a lifetime of luxury for himself and his friends. The problem with HHH as an authority figure is that HHH will now have to work Tuesdays (kudos if you got that joke) when the time calls for it, and he’ll obviously be interacting with the RAW GM. HHH isn’t going to bring anything to the table he hasn’t brought before during the McMahon-Helmsley Regime days and basically, the end result of all of this is HHH back on the screen rambling on like Vince used to do and probably wrestling with a win here and there over any talent getting over. How quickly the MITB storyline went from CM Punk as champion to “Okay, we’re having a new championship decided and now HHH is the boss because McMahon was forced to step down” and it invokes memories of the InVasion, which is never a good thing. If this means Stephanie comes back, I’ll need the mute button.\n\n2. WWE Cancels Another Nevada House Show\n\nThey keep canceling shows in Nevada. I think it’s because they are afraid of these guys:\n\n3. Jeff Hardy Trial Continues To Be A Joke\n\nMore news on the never-ever ending Hardy drug trial as the high-risk lifestyle of Jeff Hardy continues despite originally getting arrested two years ago in September. And guess what? September is the month the trial has been postponed until yet again, this time on Sept 8th, 2011. It was September 11, 2009 when Hardy originally was arrested for the crime and despite getting indicted by a Grand Jury he has not been sentenced. Hardy could face around ten years in jail if given the maximum sentence, but already reports surfaced that he is working out a plea bargain, which likely will have absolutely no jail time whatsoever.\n\nAgain, although some people are trying to say otherwise, I find it hard to believe any one of “us” would get this treatment if we were arrested for the exact same charges. Hardy is obviously getting preferential treatment because this trial has been postponed over six times in the last year alone and the people of North Carolina are the ones stuck with the bill, since it is your tax money paying for this farce. Without going into anything political, I think it is safe to say that Hardy is using celebrity status and for some reason getting away with it time and time again so that he can continue his “wrestling career” at the company that indefinitely suspended him for appearing under the influence DESPITE ALREADY FACING SENTENCING FOR DRUG CHARGES! How stupid can one guy be?\n\nIf I were the prosecution, I’d push for TNA executives to testify what happened at that event and use it as a way to speed this thing up and demand jail time for Hardy. It appears the prosecutor is either incompetent or perhaps being “coerced” in some fashion because every day that this continues is more money out of your pockets. I kept posting back in early 2010 about how the trial would be postponed when the news came out that the next day would be the “continuation” and every single time without fail it did get postponed, to the point it is now a running joke in the comments section every time a new date is announced that people will go, say it with me now, “THIS’LL BE POSTPONED AGAIN!” and likely they will be right. Here’s hoping Hardy serves a year or two behind bars to clean his life up, but it’ll probably never happen and his life will be worse off for it.\n\n4. What The Hell Is The Fuss About?\n\nUgh, everywhere I go on 411 lately the staff is buzzing about the MITB PPV. They keep saying how wonderful it was and how awesome the story is and oh my god did you see Punk actually escape with the title and basically it is like sitting in the WWE.COM chatroom during an edition of RAW. So I asked a friend of mine to show me the Cena/Punk match since they were going on and on about it and after reviewing it, I just blinked and asked what the hell was so wonderful about that?\n\n“IT WAS AWEEEEEESOME!”, he told me.\n\n“What was awesome about it? You realize if this hadn’t taken place in Chicago the crowd wouldn’t be nearly this jacked up right?”\n\n“WHO CARES? IT WAS AN AWESOME MATCH!”\n\n“Did you even see any of the Destination X PPV matches the week before?”\n\n“HUH THERE WAS A PPV??”\n\nSo I proceeded to show him the TNA contract match. After that he looked over to me and said, “Holy shit I’m checking out this TNA from now on!”\n\nSome of my wrestling friends have no idea about TNA or just hear bad things about it and never watch the product. When showing this guy the actual match that happened a week earlier, his eyes lit up as if he was watching wrestling for the very first time. He had no idea it was even a good company, because everybody told him it stunk.\n\nThen I went to catch up with a friend of mine who is a manager at the bookstore. Like me, he was a die-hard WWE fan until the product basically became milquetoast and I asked him what he thought about RAW and MITB since I’d come in a few days later.\n\nHe looked at me and said, “I didn’t see it.”\n\nI asked why not and he replied, “Because I make it a point to never watch WWE anymore.”\n\nSo I decided to try an experiment. I told him to check out the Punk/Cena match and get back to me. Later that night he texted me with, “Watched the match – OVERRATED” and that was the end of it.\n\nSo now, both of my friends are waiting to watch Impact – one as usual, and one for the very first time. I have to say that I understand marking out and having those certain moments where one could care less how they are viewed for their reaction, but I just saw 411’s wrestling page before doing this section of the column and now people are considering this PPV the greatest in years? Did these people WATCH Destination X? But, I’ll let them have their fun since we all pretty much get along despite our differing views on the product. Bottom line, we’re all wrestling fans that will occasionally disagree on a wrestler or company but we love the product. Even all of you in the comments section, we all have that one thing in common even if it seems like I bash WWE more than I praise TNA.\n\nAll I can say is to the Fuj, Spencer, and Lisa: Be prepared for MASSIVE fanboy voting in Match of the Week. It won’t be pretty.\n\n5. WWE RAW Still Under 5 Million Viewers\n\nThe HHH-as-boss edition of RAW numbers came in and they were better than the previous two weeks, garnering a 3.2 overall for the two-hour cure for insomnia. This would seem to be a good thing until you remember generally WWE receives a decent “bounce” during the summertime, but so far the only bounce has been from a 3.1 trifecta to a 3.2 after going under 3 on two occasions. Also important is that less than five million people watched RAW, which is a small disappointment after a PPV.\n\nSome people probably are going to wonder what it will take for WWE to break the 4 barrier once again consistently and be huge again. I got news for all of you: It won’t happen. Wrestling’s boom-and-bust cycle is over, what you are experiencing is the new normal. While the shows will peak short-term, they will ultimately return to lower ratings such as the time Rock came back and then left again. By the time Rock left, he was only able to draw a 3.45 rating for his birthday edition of RAW.\n\nThe reason ratings are important is because they are a measure of how many people are interested in the product. Why do you think FOX took Family Guy back after canning them? Huge audience, huge response, and they got so big they got renewed and now MacFarlane basically owns the Sunday night lineup. Ratings are a good way to measure how interesting shows are to people, and unfortunately RAW, Smackdown, and Impact are not going to get those huge monster ratings that WWF and WCW got in the past. For the first time in 40 years, there was no boom period the past decade as there had been with Sammartino’s run in the 70’s, Rock’N’Wrestling in the 80’s, and Attitude/nWo in the 1990’s.\n\nBut now, see, I have ANOTHER question for all the readers: Do you think if McMahon finally caved in and allowed a TNA vs. WWE Supercard PPV and built up to it well for a few months it’d surpass one million buys? Using TNA’s talent and WWE’s advertising machine it would already have a hell of a chance but do you think it could hit WrestleMania heights or do you think it’d disappoint?\n\nAs always let me know in-between dropping F-Bombs at me down in the depths of human depravity we call the comments section.\n\n6. The nWo Turns 15 Years Old\n\nBefore July 1996, people knew WCW for one main reason: All those famous old guys from the WWF wrestled there. Guys we’d all grown up watching in the 1980’s as our heroes and the villains we ended up grudgingly respecting for their portrayals competed primarily in WCW for a lighter schedule with more pay, and who wouldn’t? WCW Nitro and WWF Monday Night RAW competed with both shows winning in the ratings although nobody had a definitive edge just yet.\n\nIt was this month that the nWo angle took off when Hulk Hogan joined the Outsiders at Bash at the Beach to become “the third man” and announce the birth of “the New World Order of Wrestling” which took WCW to heights it had never before achieved and would never achieve again. Through the use of suspenseful turns from various wrestlers with some obvious and some making people just shake their head in shock, the nWo was able to turn the wrestling world on its ear and take over eighty weeks of ratings domination against the WWF. Back then I’d heard all the fuss about the nWo, tuned in to check it out and actually found a Hulk Hogan gimmick I could enjoy. The refreshing new “cowardly” Hogan pleased all of us who had booed him for years and got sick of the bland face image he’d portrayed for far too long, but this Hogan was COOL. In fact, he was so cool he went from the #1 face to the #1 heel in wrestling within that one PPV. This, in turn, began WWF’s return volley of Attitude to recapture the ratings during the Monday Night War.\n\nI’m sure this comes as no surprise to anybody who reads the column but I was a MASSIVE nWo fan. I loved two factions more than any other: DX and the nWo. Although we’ll never see a faction and angle wrapped in one this successful again, we wish a happy birthday to the group that started a War.\n\nSmartest Thing of the Week: Letting CM Punk Walk Out of Chicago As Champion\n\nCM Punk walked out of Chicago, Illinois as the WWE Champion, only the 41st person to accomplish that particular feat since 1963. A lot of speculation leading up to the event revolved around whether or not Punk would even be allowed to win, or if the MITB winner on the RAW side would take Punk out as soon as he became champion under Vince’s orders, to start that person feuding with Cena with McMahon backing the new champion because Cena couldn’t get it done. We were pleasantly surprised when McMahon actually allowed the entire situation to go down the way it did, Punk winning clean over Cena and then escaping before Del Rio could shake off the kick and cash in his briefcase. The smile he gave McMahon as he left was priceless and honestly, they did the right thing here.\n\nDumbest Thing of the Week: Turning The WWE Title Angle Into A McMahon Saga\n\nA long time ago, Ric Flair discussed how with Vince McMahon it was a case of one step forward, two steps back. McMahon was referring to Flair’s performance at WrestleMania VIII but in this case, it is more like a step forward followed by five back. Do we really need to take an angle that is white hot on its own merit with CM Punk and the WWE title and then turn it completely into a situation that involves Vince McMahon and Triple H? This was perfectly fine the way it was going, but now everything changed on RAW as it appears McMahon will try and get his company back from The Son-In-Law From Hell, and the focus of the feud will likely be on the McMahon family. This shit didn’t fly in the InVasion and it sure as hell isn’t what we want to see the WWE title angle turn into now!\n\nOLD SCHOOL WRESTLER OF THE WEEK\n\nTerry Taylor\n\nThe man most notable for becoming the Red Rooster, Terry Taylor actually had a good amount of wrestling skill and would have been an interesting competitor if not for that fateful gimmick. However, Taylor did have some luck outside the WWF and was able to show his in-ring skill with WCW as part of the York Foundation although he was never able to escape the chants of “Rooster, Rooster!” that followed him anywhere he went.\n\nTerry Taylor showed so much promise when he first began wrestling in the Mid-Atlantic region that he was selected to be one of the Fabulous Ones with Stan Lane, who of course would go on to tag in the most famous version of the Midnight Express. He teamed with Bobby Fulton instead to form The Fantastic Ones and later with Tommy Rogers in The Fantastics. With names like this, was it any wonder he was the first guy WWF considered for the Mr. Perfect role?\n\nIn the mid-1980’s Taylor stuck primarily to the National Wrestling Alliance. Taylor lost to Barry Darsow in a final to declare the first Mid-South Television Champion, but Taylor would go on to beat him and eventually gain that championship three more times. Despite good matches against “Nature Boy” Buddy Landell, he never achieved the NWA Heavyweight Title but did take home the North American Heavyweight Championship by beating none other than Ted Dibiase. Taylor would go to the UWF promotion and instantly become a big name when he beat Buzz Sawyer for their version of the Television Championship. He and Chris Adams became tag team champions there before eventually breaking up and feuding, showing Taylor’s potential as a face and a heel. Unfortunately, things would go south for Taylor when he attempted to steal the NWA TV Title from Nikita koloff, and lost the unification title match to him at Starrcade 1987.\n\nTaylor’s next stop was World Class Championship Wrestling, run by the Von Erich family. He continued to feud with Adams and also found time to beat Matt Borne for the Texas Heavyweight Championship, defending it against all comers. He teamed with Iceman Parsons for the tag title win, and interestingly enough Parsons was the wrestler who first coined the phrase “roody poo” that The Rock would later be known for using.\n\nThe WWF came calling after checking out his work, and Taylor debuted as a face with Sam Houston against Los Conquistadores to start his career. Although WrestleCrap discussed Taylor as almost immediately being taken into the Heenan Family and becoming the Rooster, Taylor actually had a good run for several months as a heel against some of the top technicians in the WWF after turning on Houston for the loss and becoming a bad guy, finishing his opponents with a move called “The Scorpion” or as we know it today, The Sharpshooter. Taylor was doing well, and they decided to pair him up with Bobby “The Brain” Heenan as a manager, which led to Heenan making comments about Taylor being of limited ability, size, and brains but still, Heenan would take him to the top. Taylor took exception at first but began winning match after match as the Red Rooster. It would be after a hard-fought match and loss to Tito Santana at Saturday Night’s Main Event that Taylor would end up parting ways with Heenan after he was slapped repeatedly, and beat him down. Now a face, the Rooster began acting like a rooster and spiked his hair, coloring it red and bobbing his head like a rooster to get under the skin of Bobby Heenan. Heenan brought Steve Lombardi in as the Brooklyn Brawler, claiming he told him to stop wrestling and start acting as he did on the streets and sent him after Taylor, including a sneak attack on Prime Time Wrestling when Heenan slapped Taylor after a fake gesture of peace and Brawler clobbered him from behind. Interestingly enough, one of the only times Gorilla Monsoon was assaulted after his retirement was on that segment when Brawler hit him with a stool and laid him out. Taylor appeared at WrestleMania V and destroyed Heenan in under a minute, securing a pinfall after Heenan had already been assaulted by the Ultimate Warrior for costing him the IC Championship earlier. His feud with the Brawler never really went anywhere and the Brawler would go on to become the favorite jobber of many a fan.\n\nRooster’s career then bottomed out as he basically was used as a fan-favorite who jobbed to all the top talent, losing to name after name until June 1990 where finally he was released. He entered WCW that same year and began feuding with Arn Anderson over the TV Championship, but never captured the belt from Anderson. Terry then began a feud with Michael Wallstreet before his move to the WWF, and then became Terrance Taylor in the York Foundation to take his place, with Alexandra York running the group. The faction was a sophisticated corporation of sorts that utilized the power of computer technology to accurately predict strengths and weaknesses of opponents that would lead to the victory of the Foundation members, who wore formal attire and used their full first names. Of course, the real truth was the computer basically was used over the skull of various talents to ensure a victory in match after match, if the numbers game didn’t catch up to them first. Along with new heel Richard Morton and Thomas Rich, he took the Six Man Tag Team Titles but in the end, Taylor began arguing with Alexandra York and the other wrestlers as York attempted to control them, and eventually the group disbanded. Taylor would then remain a heel as “The Taylor Made Man” and took the WCW US Tag Title with Greg Valentine for three months after his release from the WWF. Alexandra, of course, would go on to become Mrs. Dustin Runnels or as we’d call her in her WWF debut, Marlena!\n\nTaylor used the name “Terrific” Terry Taylor when he returned to the WWF in September 1992. Rumors were that the original Mr. Perfect character was going to go to Taylor before Hennig wowed the executives enough to change their mind, and “Terrific” Terry was a similar heel. However, he almost never won a match, which led him to quit again and go to WCW after being an interviewer for the Federation, now working as a face for a short stint before he’d end up in the AWF in 1994 as an announcer. Taylor would go back to the WCW as a road agent and writer for several years, and then once more became employed in the WWF in 1998 as a backstage interviewer. Guess what he did next? Left for WCW! This time he stayed until the company got bought out by McMahon, working with “Living Legend” Larry Zbyszko on WCW Saturday Night commentary.\n\nTaylor would end up going to TNA wrestling in 2003, and was involved in the infamous Jim Cornette situation where he forwarded Cornette’s email to Vince Russo in which Cornette discussed in graphic detail how he wanted to kill Vince Russo. He was head of talent relations after being a road agent, interviewer, and trainer for the talent but was released on May 20, 2011.\n\nTaylor wasn’t unable to wrestle in the 1990’s, but the various companies also didn’t use him very well. In 2004, he underwent surgery to repair his neck and in 2006, required a second operation that ended his ability to compete in the ring. He announced his retirement on April 3, 2006 after the operation was completed. Sadly, last week Terry’s wife Trudy died from cancer on July 14. Taylor is a born-again Christian who works with Ted Dibiase on some religious programming and obviously, we here at the Sandwich wish him the best of luck in his life and offer our sincerest condolences on his loss.\n\nI always had fond memories of watching Taylor mix it up with the other technically savvy competitors although he was never really used in a decent position. Although the Rooster gimmick got a lot of bad reviews, the kids did love Taylor and he was on several WWF merchandise offerings that sold decently. In the end it was just a situation of wrong place, wrong time. As an example of his skill Taylor was rated #197 out of 500 in the PWI Years 500 in 2003, took home Best Rookie in 1980, and was ranked by the Wrestling Observer as Most Underrated Wrestler in 1991 and 1992. Taylor was also known for several interesting facts: He won Worst Worked Match of the Year in a Scaffold match in which his partner was none other than “Stone Cold” Steve Austin, he was a tag team champion with Don Callis, Chris Adams, Steve Keirn/Skinner, Rick Steiner, Greg Valentine, and Jim Duggan as well, was known for the Sharpshooter and a gut-wrench power bomb before they were “officially” used in the WWF by Bret Hart and Dr. Death Steve Williams as well as Jack Swagger, and he even utilized George Steele’s old “flying” hammerlock as well as Tito Santana’s flying forearm while they were still being used in the WWF.\n\nOh, you want to see that infamous e-mail from Cornette don’t you? You can visit his website and view the entire thing and the lawyer’s letter he received as well Here which is at JimCornette.com in case you were wondering.\n\nHere’s a Rooster wrestling a Weasel at WrestleMania V:\n\nTake 5\n\nWrestler To Watch: Alberto Del Rio\n\nAfter winning the Royal Rumble 2011 but coming up short at WrestleMania, Alberto Del Rio earned yet another title shot for himself with the RAW Money in the Bank ladder match. Alberto, who had been the #1 contender before CM Punk was granted his original match, simply took out seven other opponents and brought home the case guaranteeing a title shot anytime, anyplace, against the champion in any condition. Many people have been saying that Alberto was about to be a world champion but unforeseen circumstances blocked that off (Edge’s forced retirement, Punk angle) and now, the Essence of Excellence has a chance to step into immortality once we finally do crown a heavyweight champion, as I’m sure Alberto won’t wait too long before cashing in.\n\nBabe To Watch: Melina\n\nWhen this curvy Latina beauty burst on the scene and showed off her talent in the ring and those gorgeous legs getting on the apron, there were many guys who took immediately to the talented manager of Johnny Nitro and Joey Mercury, together known as MNM. Nitro, who would go on to be John Morrison, still to this day has Melina as his girl and considering this video, I don’t think any of us are shocked why. John, you lucky bastard! And of course, as we all know, Melina is also one of the wrestlers in the famous match for the Undefined Championship as quoted by one clueless contestant on Tough Enough earlier this year!\n\nMatch of the Week To Watch: WCW BATB 1996 – Hostile Takeover by the nWo\n\nThe match and promo go together this week as we head to one of the greatest moments ever in wrestling history.\n\nIn July 1996, Hulk Hogan was arguably the most popular wrestler in the world. WCW was competing with the WWF but so far, neither show had been able to dominate the other. Legions of fans tuned with interest to see the “Hostile Takeover” match as it was billed, with Sting, Lex Luger, and “Macho Man” Randy Savage selected by WCW to face a foreign threat in the team of the Outsiders Scott Hall and Kevin Nash along with a mystery third man. Rumors swirled about exactly who the third man would be, and in this match some believed Luger would return from his stretcher job to join the nWo. But what actually happened not only changed the course of wrestling history but for the first time ever, made WCW profitable and the #1 company in the world for over 80 weeks straight.\n\nPart 1:\n\nPart 2:\n\nPromo of the Week: Hulk Hogan Introduces The World to the nWo\n\nAfter the Legdrop Heard Around The World, Mean Gene Okerlund interviewed Hogan and his new buddies. The fans were in shock, trash was being thrown at Hogan in the ring, and people were in tears. Some kids were even crying over their hero abandoning them! Well, Hogan wasn’t done ruining their night just yet. As Gene held the microphone, Hogan cut his first heel promo and announced the formation of a brand new faction known as the New World Order and told all the fans to stick it! While it may seem like something typical of Hogan now, back then the man had been a face non-stop for around thirteen years and this turn was something that re-energized his career and brought WCW to the top of the mountain…BROTHER!\n\nFINAL PART and Hogan promo:\n\nMystery Section to Watch: nWo Tribute Video\n\nFor life, bitches.\n\nThe Good, The Bad, and The… WTF?\n\nOkay, so I have the results of our informal poll. Here’s what you guys said were the three biggest problems with WWE and your top three solutions:\n\n1. Same boring moves/storylines/promos/people in the main event.\n\n2. Dead tag team division\n\n3. Elevate people who are ready for it\n\nAlso honorable mentions go to “make a new mega-face” and “Too many second/third/fourth chances and rematches for belts” which also are very important to consider. Honestly, great stuff.\n\nIt is pretty bothersome to see the same moves over and over, the same promo style, and the same people in the main events year after year. The tag team division contains about three teams right now including the champions, and people ready to go up on the card aren’t.\n\nTop Solutions:\n\n1. Put the belts on other people\n\n2. Spice up the tag team division\n\n3. Drop the PG rating\n\nI’m in favor of all of this. In fact, adding a little retro and getting more risqué, as two suggestions went, would help a LOT. I miss the managers too.\n\nAnd now to the comments. First, of course:\n\nThe Good\n\n“ur awesome Wes,u should be defence lawyer for TNA.\n\nIts good to see WWE being driven to near death by an impact zone company.\n\nI hate WWE,They have no respect even for the fans who sustained them,even for the kids who buy their ppvs,hell if you state tha fact that Over The Limit did only 70000 buys and if you ignore the one million buys of Wrestlemania 27 then you get the point that their ppv revenue has been very less this year,they suck and will die in 2 years hopefully,\n\nFuck u WWE,Fuck u Vince and Fuck u CM Punk,one adult themed promo and he is being given the cake,have seen millions of adult themed promos in other promotions but in WWE this is so rare nowadays that it gets praised,WWE sucks,the kids can keep watching its kid themed content and the boring wrestlers who repeat the same old moves.To hell with you WWE,u have betrayed even fans like me who used to stay awake till 1 in morning to watch Angle vs Shawn Michaels at Wrestlemania or to watch Evolution,you killed ur own product.U have no respect for the fans,you are a rich man Vince,then why asking fans why they dont watch the same old boring show you try to push into their throats as Entertainment.How long can the kids be fooled.Thank god there is hope that WWE will be History in 2 years.\n\nPosted By: Amit (Guest) on July 16, 2011 at 03:56 AM”\n\nYou did hit the nail on the head with the Punk promo. Because it was worked-shoot, it made a huge difference compared to the cookie-cutter promos we usually get.\n\nI guess we have to agree to disagree about Evolution. The greatest thing that faction ever did was dissolve.\n\nSame old boring show – that’s been the complaint. A lot of people say it, a lot of ex-fans say it, and still Vince needs to pay research groups to hear this. Frankly, if he just asked the fans and had them fill out a survey of about 10-15 questions with a comments section he’d get all the feedback he needed, and for free. Researching costs money, which is why Donald Trump is known to do his own research on locations and real estate before he makes a move. By the way, that strategy helped the man to a seven BILLION dollar net worth. He should advise his friend about it.\n\nThe one thing I disagree with you on is the WWE being dead in two years – you obviously hope for it, but unless some major problems go down I can’t see it even as a possibility right now. People enjoy watching crap sometimes, how else do you explain Seinfeld?\n\nAs far as a lawyer for TNA goes, they probably have more than enough lawyers. But good writers? Hmm.\n\n“Enjoyable column. While I completely disagree with you on the political spectrum, I do agree on the wrestling perspective. I’m not a stocks guy so I won’t address that. But if the WWE really wants to know what their major problems it’s this…\n\nThey refuse to make new stars. It’s due to their lack of faith to take a chance short term. If they really don’t believe that John Cena can be the Top Guy without the being the Champion then he should not be the man the company is built around. Same with Randy Orton.\n\nThe WWE pushes and depushes so much that the fans cannot and now, will not, get invested in the new talent. They seem almost afraid to make someone a new true, Superstar. When the fans are conditioned not to pull for anyone besides Orton and Cena, the shows really become recycled except unlike Hogan, and Austin, neither star is charismatic enough to follow the formula of Insert Heel of the Month Who Won’t Win a Title Match.\n\nNOBODY in the WWE Universe believes that CM Punk will leave Chicago with the title. Christian has been devalued to crap, so even if he wins, it doesn’t mean anything. R-Truth is cool, Alberto Del Rio is solid, Rey Mysterio and Big Show of all people could do it, but the fans do not think any are a real or consistent threat to the titles… so why tune in?\n\nThere is nothing else happening of note on either show. When Ted Dibiase is the highlight of your night you know you’ve got a problem. There are no cruiserweights. There is no women’s division and separating them among brands makes it even worse. There is no tag team division to speak of and probably never will be.\n\nWhat used to be segments we put up with, meaning the comedy aspects which have always been hit or miss- now they’re just seen as annoying because unfortunately due to lack of everything quality on the show they are the most memorable.\n\nAnd then again we get the incendiary feeling the second we start to like a guy too much, who isn’t Orton, Cena or Triple H’s pet project of the month, that Superstar will be ribbed, ignored, traded to Smackdown, or depushed so fast they’d be lucky to main event NEXT.\n\nVince McMahon is right, he tells the people what they want to see. Now that he’s saying it out loud, people are showing him that’s not what they want to see. The kids’ numbers will stay the same. The International numbers will stay the same. The Stock will continue to slide until WWE gets its own head out of its ass. For all of our sakes, I hope they do. For the sake of the sport of kings, it has got to happen. That’s why we don’t watch.\n\nPosted By: ws (Guest) on July 16, 2011 at 09:10 AM”\n\nYou nailed it right there, my friend. Lost in the massive ass kissing over the MITB finish, people forgot a world title changed hands due to a disqualification. This is the stuff they get on TNA and used to rag on WCW for doing but of course, WWE doing it means FREE PASS!\n\nThere will be no free pass here, however.. CM Punk did leave with the championship but Vince simply made the entire storyline about himself and HHH, and made a new title. Compelling television! Compelling people away from the TV, that is.\n\nWith the rumors of another NXT and apparently a certainty of another Tough Enough, they are going to have so many people on their roster it isn’t even funny. How do you handle them when your current guys are used horribly? A lot of questions that need to be answered.\n\n“Jp is your normal Wall Street mark. He looks at the numbers in front of him and not what’s in between. There is a huge difference between book value and street value. Speculation on future earnings and ignoring the fact that a half billion dollar company is pissing away huge amounts and now worth only 120 million is the reason for our financial collapse. Stock reports are nothing but smoke and mirrors to satisfy investors and while they are truthful they alsohide a lot of truth.\n\nPosted By: Guest#2819 (Guest) on July 16, 2011 at 01:20 PM”\n\nEXACTLY. This is why with that rebuttal I’m winning.\n\nSee, JP has a fan base. I don’t. JP will automatically win any popularity contest, but that doesn’t determine who is right. Most of the people who say I got “beaten” with his one rebuttal do not even understand financials. They don’t understand the importance of certain numbers and certain statements. There are a lot of people in this world who think they know everything about everything, like half the commenters here.\n\nTake Jim Cramer for example. This is a guy who lives near and went to school with half the CEO’s he plugs on his show. He says to buy them, or sell them, and acts like an idiot to entertain people. He’s one of the guys who plugged WWE stock when it was around 16 dollars as a great investment! Why? He’s a good friend of Vince. Guys like Cramer plug people due to friendship and possibly a few kickbacks, and also because they know those people and think that’s all they need. Unbiased research will likely show the things Cramer can’t see and explains why he is wrong so often. You know, with all the people lately who went to Harvard failing miserably at everything you have to wonder if they open a book at that place!\n\nFinancially, WWE is not terrible but it is not as good as it was. The stock price never met the opening IPO high, you can flip a coin as to whether or not it hits or misses quarterly estimates, and they blame EVERYTHING for the loss of revenue. Why did merchandise numbers drop? Economy. Why did PPV rates drop? Our top stars weren’t around for three months. Odd, UFC lost Lesnar for a while and still steamrolled everybody on PPV buy rates. WWE can’t go out and say, “The reason we lost money is because our product isn’t as good as it used to be” since that’d scare all the shareholders out. Unlike a lot of people in the financials, I’m out for myself and myself only so I won’t shout out talking points to defend a bad stock. When it is somebody else’s money it is easy to make picks, but when it is your own you become a lot more careful. And yes, McMahon isn’t worth $1.1 billion like in 1999 now is he?\n\nOne more because it is short:\n\n“This is the best wrestling column on the site.\n\nPosted By: realist (Guest) on July 16, 2011 at 06:12 PM”\n\nThere ya go!\n\nThe Bad\n\n“Also, 99:1 gives one hell of a nice payout to those who bet on the underdog.\n\nThis isnt a damned football match. Its simply a case of one guy knowing more than the other.\n\nPosted By: Guest#7279 (Guest) on July 15, 2011 at 11:29 PM”\n\nTo be fair, that person who knows more is I. So thanks!\n\n“Oh Wes, poor, poor Wes.\n\nThe funniest parts of your self-appointed status as an investment expert:\n\nYour not a licensed investment adviser, which is why you only manage your own money. I bet you couldn’t even pass the Series 7 exam\n\nJust because you have an E-Trade or Sharebuilder account, does not make you a day trader. You only trade with your own money. Even scummy day traders laugh at you.\n\nPlease stop embarrassing yourself. JP Prag totally exposed you as an ignorant, uninformed moron.\n\nJust accept the ass whipping and let it go. There’s nothing sadder than somebody who has clearly lost, insisting on pathetically trying to “claim” he won.\n\nEventually the scars JP left will go away.\n\nJust stick to being a heel TNA writer, “building” owner, and E-Trade account holder.\n\nAnd try to enjoy writing your column…while you have it.\n\nPosted By: Guest 2507 (Guest) on July 16, 2011 at 02:52 AM”\n\nLet me take care of this in fifteen minutes or less:\n\n#1 – I am not an investment expert. I simply day trade to make money. Is that so difficult to understand?\n\n#2 – Yes, I only trade with my own money. That’s why I do research to make sure it stays my money.\n\n#3 – JP Prag shilled the WWE line; I showed the numbers WWE doesn’t want you to know about. In a popularity contest, JP kicked my ass. Comparing the numbers from my pieces and his piece, I win.\n\n#4 – I’ll have my column as long as I damn well want it. You know why? I don’t quit. A lot of people can get flamed to the point they run off the site. With me, I either get fired or I write. So hate me all you want to, I really do not care.\n\n#5 – People like you are exactly what is wrong with the economy. People like you said the economy was getting better when it got worse. Guys like you said the jobless claims would be under 400,000 a week thirteen weeks ago and are STILL wrong. Guys like you never saw 2008 coming a mile away. And guys like you won’t make a real prediction in the financial world because you are too scared by not kissing the right ass you’ll get tossed out of managing any money at all. So you tow the company line, get a reputation as somebody who knows nothing, and try to out-run angry investors wondering why you gave them bad advice.\n\nThe difference is I make my own success; you just take a fee to invest other people’s money because you can’t do it on your own.\n\n“You lose, Wes. Your true colours have been obvious to the majority of 411 staffers and readers for some time. You don’t even get the same amount of comments anymore to respond to, because it’s not even worth it for most people. You’re not a wrestling fan, you’re just a sad troll criticising WWE for the sake of it while claiming to like TNA despite never actually discussing TNA unless it’s as part of a critique of WWE. It’s because of idiots like you that actual objective TNA fans, who do exist by the way but are simply shouted over, will never be taken seriously. You must realise, you couldn’t possibly be so dense as to not realise, that you’re actually damaging TNA’s reputation with this continuous garbage. You’re out of your depth trying to write for a mass audience, you’re most certainly out of your depth trying to discuss financials with Prag, and you’re so hilariously out of touch when it comes to Cena and other members of WWE’s main event scene that it reads more like something from five or six years ago on a blogspot guestbook than something that a sentient, supposedly educated wrestling columnist would write when given the greatest opportunity of their life.\n\nYou’re either a genius for projecting your name in everyone’s minds by writing stuff that you know is rubbish just to get a reaction, or you’re the single most vacuous writer this site has ever seen. Either way, it’s getting tedious.\n\nPosted By: Frie (Guest) on July 16, 2011 at 07:24 AM”\n\nOh hi. Didn’t you say you would stop reading and commenting three weeks ago? Yet you are still here.\n\nJust a few points before I see you next week, Fried Brain.\n\n#1 – You’re right, I don’t get the same amount of comments anymore: I get more!\n\n#2 – I am a fan of professional wrestling from the catch-as-catch-can days to today, in some parts. I am not a fan of “sports entertainment” and things like CZW.\n\n#3 – TNA fans and I get along very well considering we’re all doing our part to help people understand there is an alternative to Monday Night Snore. No actual TNA fan ever said I was damaging any reputation because I help show the WWE is nowhere near what it was, and TNA is the better offering right now.\n\n#4 – I’m out of my depth how? I don’t win popularity contests but I win a fair contest. Financial wins and losses are NOT judged by how many people think JP was right or I was wrong, but by the actual financials themselves. Any of the major names in trading will agree with me when they look at both our pieces.\n\n#5 – A genius? Why thank you. You know, you are completely discredited since you said three weeks earlier you’d never read the column again, never mind stop commenting on it. By the way, nobody is stopping you from trying to write an article if you feel you are so much smarter. Oh, wait; you aren’t good enough to get accepted are you? Sorry about that.\n\nI was going to reply to the dude who slandered a certain conservative news organization but I did tell all of you I was keeping politics out of the column. You’re welcome.\n\nI will reply to this one:\n\n“Okay, what I don’t understand: during your rebuttal to Prag you don’t pick a concrete sample to analyze. You jump from a two-year period (2009-2010) to a five-year period (2006-2010) to a four-year period (2007-2010) back to a two-year period (2009-2010); why? Wouldn’t it make sense to focus on the same time period each time? And beyond that, shouldn’t you be looking beyond just a two-year time span since that’s an extremely limited time frame in which to judge a company’s growth? It almost seems like you’re ignoring years that might contradict your argument. Hm….\n\nPosted By: Guest#2295 (Guest) on July 16, 2011 at 01:45 PM”\n\nEasy stuff, 2295. The years on CNBC listed for the earnings and financials are from 2007-2011. The movie records start in 2006 with The Marine. There was no attempt to hide anything, all the records of WWE are on any financial website you care to visit because they are a public company. If you really want to look beyond a two-year or four-year time span, in 1999 WWE stock was worth $30.50 and in 2011 it is worth slightly under $10.00. Long enough for you? As I said last week, I gave the link to CNBC so you can go research it yourself and prove what I said right or wrong.\n\nOur previous WTF comment winner wanted me to put his comments here and reply to him.\n\n…So of course, I’m not going to do it. His arguments are ad populum, which means it is based on the premise that whoever or whatever is popular is therefore correct. That doesn’t make it true. One of the many logical fallacies in our culture that people use is this “appeal to the people” as well as ad novitatem which is basically jumping on the bandwagon because “everybody else is doing it” and thus logically invalidates itself.\n\nSo here we go:\n\nThe WTF\n\n“I doubt most of the people commenting know the first thing about investing. Half the people are bragging about “managing” other people’s money. Only a very few people that are wealthy actually do that. Most of the really wealthy DO NOT manage a fund for other people.\n\nPosted By: Guest#9512 (Guest) on July 17, 2011 at 11:29 PM\n\nWhat exactly do you think financial advisers and certified financial planners all over the country do in their job?\n\nWho do you think manages IRA, mutual funds, hedge funds, wealth management accounts, 401k, 403b, 457, 529, public and private pension funds, etc.?\n\nWhat exactly do you think all the companies advertising retirement planning do?\n\nIf you are skillful investing money and making it grow…what profession would you be in?\n\nWhere do you think smart people, who have neither the time nor expertise, go to invest their money?\n\nI can see you and Wes have much in common.\n\nYou both seem to think the market is a casino and you place your bets at the table and can only win/lose when the wheel stops spinning.\n\nIn the market you don’t lose your chips until you walk away from the table. You can leave your money for as many spins as you want. You guys wait for one spin, smart people wait for the best moment, be it one spin or one thousand or one million.\n\nPosted By: Guest#8440 (Guest) on July 18, 2011 at 07:06 PM”\n\nObviously, we must commend Guest 9512 for being a lot smarter than the idiot posting at 8440.\n\nFinancial advisers and planners have failed the people. Your advice cost many their life savings in the 2008 crisis and continues to be poorly thought out and considering the “long-term” argument that stocks will go up when in fact, that’s not always the case. In 2008 all of you said there was no problem with the mortgages and there was no financial situation and then we all saw how stupid you guys really are.\n\nI’m glad you used a casino analogy because that’s about as dumb as your comment. Smart people wait for the best moment? What the hell do you think day traders do? They wait until they get a significant amount of money and take it rather than risk it!\n\nLet me give you an example:\n\nThere’s a stock that goes from $30.00 a share to $42.00 a share. During that period, a day trader gets it when it goes up three dollars, five dollars, and four dollars with 1,000 shares. Also during that period, the stock opens two dollars down and ends up one dollar up, with the trader buying it when the stock was down and therefore makes three dollars. The long-term investor has 1,000 shares of the same stock and never sells or buys any more.\n\nWho do you think made more?\n\nLong-term investor made a grand total of $12.00 per share. The day trader made at least $15.00 a share counting the quick trades.\n\nThe day trader made several round trips that resulted in the exact same amount of money that the long-term investor made – 3 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 15. And the day trader could have made that money over two or three weeks and not six months! How? Because they trade it every day: At a low they buy, and at a high they sell. In all likelihood, with all the trips the day trader would have made that weren’t significant dollar amounts, the day trader would make more – such as maybe thirty cents one day, fifty another, and so on. The long-term investor never sold, and never bought, on any spike or drop.\n\nDay traders have the ability to make a lot more money because they go with the flow. While you are sitting there waiting for your stock to go up ten dollars, we’re making thirty off the pops and drops. Now, is that smart strategy or not? I don’t believe in “investments” as much as I believe in a quick transaction guaranteeing a profit.\n\nBy the way, the people who lost everything in 2008 called. They want to ask you just how guaranteed those banks and financial companies really are.\n\nMy advice? Take your money and GET OUT while you can. You might not make as much, but you’ll always make something.\n\nOur favorite little lingerie goddess Kate Upton has two rather large reasons to enjoy her latest shoot: Kate Upton Is A Goddess\n\nOh hell, I can’t decide which picture of the Victoria’s Secret girls to put up so you get ALL of them!
