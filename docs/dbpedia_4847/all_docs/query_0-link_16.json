        "text": "When discussion the territory days of professional wrestling, some major areas come to mind. Jim Crockett as the promoter in the Carolinas. Verne Gagne in Minnesota. Dick The Bruiser and Wilber Snyder in Indianapolis, Fritz Von Erich in Texas, and the Sheik in Detroit. But one that is not talked about much is the wrestling from the Bahamas, which is featured in Ian C. Douglass’ Bahamian Rhapsody: The Unofficial History Of Pro Wrestling’s Unofficial Territory 1960-2020 (Darkstream Press, 2022).\n\nSure the title may be long, but this is filled with a rich history of wrestling that was known for fans who were almost as active as the wrestlers, by throwing bottles, rocks, and even at times attacking the wrestlers, which was mostly known in the territories such as Puerto Rico and the midwest.\n\nThe book starts in the 1960s and describes how boxing and wrestling started to gain a following, with wrestling switching places of the matches frequently from an airport hanger to the most known Nassau Stadium (obviously not to be confused the the Nassau Coliseum in New York, which was The McMahon’s territory). The Bahamas then started having a connection with Florida wrestling run by Eddie Graham, which then brought in many stars that one would figure from the Flordia area like Bearcat Wright, The Garvins, Jose Lothario, and more. However, bigger stars ended up coming for shows such as Dusty Rhodes, The NWA Champions like Dory Funk Jr and Ric Flair, while building up stars throughout the years via the Florida area, and most importantly, the black wrestlers who were over in the Bahamas. Wrestlers like Sweet Brown Sugar (who became the first NWA Bahamas Heavyweight Champion), Butch Reed, and Cyclone Negro.\n\nThe book isn’t just about wrestling history, but cultural and political history as well. For a time the NWA stars did not come to the area due to political reasons such as those in the Bahamas felt these U.S stars were taking away from the wrestlers who were born and raised in the region, taking the economy money back to Florida. Some outlaw wrestling promotions were also trying to get in the area at times without the approval of the NWA, which Florida wrestling was underneath their banner. Also, in the early days (much like in the other territory days), the idea of Kayfabe was real, where fans and officials were not in on the fact that wrestling was pre-determined, where a rules committee was created to stop the wrestlers from infuriating the fans who would throw bottles and other objects at the villains who were trying to work their gimmicks. The fans would riot at times when their black wrestler would get cheated out of a match (or titles) which made booking sometimes, along with the lives of the wrestlers, dangerous. Stories are told here how police officers with guard dogs would turn their heads when it came to protecting the wrestlers at times, and allow fans to get “real” with the athletes. Also in the text how boxing and NBA basketball affected audience attendance in the 70s and 1980s.\n\nStories of many wrestling names going into the ’80s and ’90s who made their way through the Bahamas are mentionable such as Lex Luger, The Nasty Boys, Buggys McGraw, Blackjack Mulligan and his sons Barry and Kendall Windham (not surprisingly when one realizes the working relationship with Florida wrestling, who were all stars). There is attention to the popularity of Tyree Pride (who I was brought to attention via the wrestling magazines in the 80s), Pez Whatley, and Billy Jack Haynes. When Dusty Rhodes was famously fired by WCW for the Road Warriors incident, he returned to the Bahamas before going to the WWF. In the later years Steve Keirn, along with announcer Gordon Solie tried to start up shows in the area after Florida wrestling was shut down and consoldated into WCW, which became more known as the NWA after Crockett sold. The book then details how Chris Jericho’s wrestling cruise traveled through the region with Ring Of Honor and AEW stars.\n\nThe text flows nicely with a mix of interviews and newspaper reports, along with Douglass doing his investigations into some myths of incidents that may (or not) have happened. I have reviewed several of his books for this site (you can check them out by typing in the search engine), and the writer does a great job of not just putting out a historical text filled with dates and results but adding the entertainment value as well with the stories readers want to know, or may not be aware of (such as Dusty Rhodes and The Nasty Boys in the back of a truck riding through the area to promote the matches). For a territory that doesn’t get mentioned as much, there were a bunch of major stars who went through here, which makes the book a fun read, and again, a historical one, with the political and cultural aspects as well. This is a book all wrestling collectors should have on their shelves.\n\nThis review copy was sent courtesy of the author.\n\nBahamian Rhapsody: The Unofficial History Of Pro Wrestling’s Unofficial Territory 1960-2020 by Ian C. Douglass (Darkstream Press, 2022) ISBN: 979-8-218-06966-7 can be ordered, along with author information at: http://www.iandouglass.net\n\nThe Overall: Pages: 308 Language:Mild Geared For: Ages 12 and Up For Fans Of: Professional Wrestling, Non-Fiction,History, Cultural History, Political History, Sports books.\n\nFollow Lance Lumley on his social media @lovelylancel\n\nLance Lumley’s novella The Cassette is available on Amazon.\n\nThe year was 1987. Junior high me was living out my summer days still trying to live the attitude of Tom Cruise in Top Gun a year before, hanging out during the summers at the city park with my best friends (a scene similar to my book The Cassette now on Amazon) , playing my drums to The Beach Boys and various music listening to Casey Kasem’s Top 40 radio show every week, and talking professional wrestling with a few friends.\n\nI was a comic book collector reading my Star Wars, GI Joe, and Conan books, until wrestling got a hold of me and I started traded the very used comics for wrestling magazines. The few of us at my school who were wrestling fans talked Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, and Ric Flair and The Four Horsemen. On television in my town of Columbiana, Ohio, we got wrestling leagues like NWA, WWF, World Class Wrestling, and the AWA. One day while trading comics for a new issue of The Wrestler, my friend stated he watched a league called the UWF and there was a guy named Sting who was becoming a favorite of his. Since it was pre-internet days, one couldn’t just Google or Youtube matches, so it was a while later when the UWF merged with the NWA when I got to see Steve Borden’s Sting for the first time, and I was hooked from then on.\n\nI have mentioned many times, including in Nikita Koloff’s Expanded Edition of his book, that professional wrestling helped me become a better reader and student, thanks to a teacher who encouraged me to use wrestling (and music) to help my geography tests, and letting me create my own wrestling newsletters, not knowing that today I would have the honor of being a part of several wrestling books and being on a few podcasts. Just like in music, sometimes my only friend was the characters on screen; who knew at the time many girls didn’t think wrestling was “cool” (I still at my age have no idea what they think is “cool”).\n\nWhen Sting did a turn in the WCW, after he felt he had no friends and Hulk Hogan’s NWO was turning his friends against him, he turned into the Crow Sting, sitting in the rafters of buildings just waiting for people to show their true colors, while people called for him to be their hero and come back and join his friends. This was in my college days and I related to being the one friends turned away from, even though I was playing in local bands and had plenty of so-called female attention and fellow buddies in other bands. Being an introvert at times, the idea of stepping away and looking around before speaking and checking out the situations when friends hurt me is still something I do (my way of enforcing James 1:19-20) , even though sitting in the balconies at church looking down from the “rafters” may not always be the best option.\n\nWith his final match now done I can look back at how Sting the character affected me personally (along with other wrestlers). I was a charismatic “Surfer Sting” when I was on stage with the bands, yelling and being amped up to a 10 to entertain my audience. I related to the mysterious, brooding Crow Sting (even most recently when I was feeling those close to me turned their backs on me). When I worked at a grocery store at one time, we had a group who called ourselves The Four Horsemen, where we were a clique that looked out for each other on and off the clock, including the rich member who was more than happy to play the Ric Flair part with us throwing his money to impress the girls. Just like the Sting of The Horsemen, jealousy crept in and the group disbanded over not a title shot, but me winning the heart of a girl the “leader” wanted. We had a Main Event Mafia group like the TNA Sting, where the younger kids at a job site was disrespecting us “veterans” which became a “older verses newer” feud. Wrestling was a major part of those I was around at times.\n\nIn College at Kent State I wore face paint during our late night broom-ball events to strike fear into the opponents and show that it was “Show Time” for them.\n\nBut the Steve Borden that influenced me the most was the Christian man. I got saved around the same time he did, along with finding out Alice Cooper was a Christian, which made it “cool” to be a church going , God -loving person. Many people in the wrestling business, even some of the critics of Sting’s ring work, never had a bad thing to say about him, which is what I tried to do, stating that he was “too nice for the business.” (Unlike me when I started to stand up for myself, the generalization became that I “difficult to be around”-God doesn’t want us to be door mats either).\n\nRegardless of my views on Sting’s WWE and AEW runs (I can’t get into the whole AEW product), another aspect of Sting in the past three years made me look at life differently. Borden became a mentor to a young Darby Allin and other people in the locker room, but yet still was able to give some of himself to the product, as opposed to just sitting back and being a “manager.” Sure the skills weren’t like they were in 1990 and his matches changed to many “no rules” styles to help him out, but at age 64, he had something to give back. He wasn’t just words, but put them in action as well. Like Proverbs 27 says “Iron Sharpens Iron,” where not only was Sting giving to his younger friend, but he was learning from him in return. Looking around at my current churches, I have struggled in the past several months in trying to leave a legacy along with wanting to give my advice to younger musicians and people. The sad thing is in church you rarely get to know who you influence and most likely you will not get a grand farewell like Sting got in his final match this week. Also the fact that I tend to choose people thinking “they deserve to meet me” idea (which my best friend used to say when he was alive when it came to girls) doesn’t always work they way we want.\n\nThere has been many aspects of Steve “Sting” Borden’s life that not just entertained me on screen, from wrestling to his underrated movie 2000 Shutterspeed (can we find this gem on the net please??) and going into his work in Christian films like The Encounter. Even when he was supposed to be a “bad guy” the fans cheered him and knew that he was beloved because he still carried a class and charm to him. A musician can influence many with their songs or a writer with his words, why was it so strange that a pro-wrestler could do it on and off screen, and be vocal about his faith as well?\n\nJust like one of the themes in my novella The Cassette, showing someone how you feel about them and hopefully inspiring others (which I actually thank Borden in the back of my book for his influence), whether it is pro-wrestling, music, painting, or anything, showing the kindness and love in mentoring someone like Sting did in his last few years of his career not only hit home with me recently, but looking back on his career throughout the decades,\n\nThank You Sting!\n\nYou can follow Lance Lumley on social media @lovelylancel and get his novella The Cassette now on Amazon.\n\nThe Last Real World Champion: The Legacy of “Nature Boy” Ric Flair by Tim Hornbaker (ECW Press, 2023) is an in-depth look at one of the greatest ever in professional wrestling.\n\nThis biography details Richard Fliehr’s life in Minnesota playing football and track living with his parents who had a love for theater. After becoming friends with Ken Patera, he joins Verne Gagne’s wrestling camp and has to be talked into not quitting. His early professional wrestling days in Gagne’s AWA riding with Dusty Rhodes and Dick Murdoch are told, and after the suggestion of Wahoo McDaniel, he goes to Jim Crockett’s NWA territory in Charlotte where he will eventually become a major star for most of his career thanks to George Scott who suggested him to embrace the “Nature Boy” gimmick.\n\nThere are many stories in the book, including the plane crash that almost ended his career, along with some events that get overlooked at times, such as his 1976 Madison Square Garden match for the WWWF (many think his first venture into working for a McMahon was for Vince Jr in the 1990s after his NWA/WCW runs). The book goes through in detail his various feuds and tag partners like Greg Valentine, Rick Steamboat, Roddy Piper, Blackjack Mulligan, Paul Jones, and of course his most famous matches with Hulk Hogan, Dusty Rhodes, and Harley Race.\n\nHornbaker, being the historical writer that he is, uses many sources from newspaper interviews to Flair’s book to radio shows, to cover as much of Flair’s life in and out of the ring as possible. Many fans may not have gotten access to some of these events like his visits to children’s events and other charity functions while being a heel in the NWA, to his marriages and personal life including his finances (which was a breaking point for him not talking to Jim Crockett Sr. after not being told that he was the make or break deal in Ted Turner buying out Crockett, and not giving him a sizable contract pay raise). Also in the writing are the other title losses and wins that Ric had that many casual fans may not know about, such as his NWA title loss in Santo Domingo, and a loss in Florida in a match with Dusty as The Midnight Rider. This is a comprehensive writing of not just his career, but the others in charge of the bookings and the financial problems Crockett had Turner had before selling to Vince McMahon Jr. The rivalry between him and Rhodes outside the ring as well is covered nicely.\n\nThe book briefly goes into Flair’s WWE runs in TNA, Ring Of Honor, and his “last match” in 2022. Since the writing is a solid 380 pages, these last moments get glossed over compared to the rest of his career, which may be because the author didn’t deem the TNA era worthy to write about due to Flair’s limited involvement as an on-air character. Hornbaker also talks about the legacy of Flair as a celebrity today from his ESPN shows covering his life to football players and other athletes and celebrities using his catchphrases or having him appear at events.\n\nThe writing is a wonderful portrait of one of the last traditional champions in wrestling before the sports entertainment era (although those like Nick Aldis have carried the banner in the current times nicely). It’s hard to keep a reader happy with all the events of Flair’s many decade-filled life (some stuff would get glossed over or else it would be an 800-page book), also with it being a biography, not an autobiography, one may be skeptical in how much is put in or what is omitted without the topic subject having no say in it. I did enjoy the brief part on Buddy Landel, who was always a favorite of mine and also used the “Nature Boy” gimmick which Flair even approved of him doing, but was a little disappointed with the lack of Sting stories, who was one of Flair’s biggest rivals in the 1990s. Also, the importance of his relationship with Ken Patera was glossed over a bit, but you can read the more in-depth story by getting Patera’s book ( you can read that review here by typing into the archives, which I had a part in editing and proofreading). With that said, though if anyone could cover the legacy of Ric Flair’s career without Ric’s involvement, Hornbaker could do it, and he pulls it off with class.\n\nThis review copy was sent courtesy of the publisher.\n\nThe Last Real World Champion: The Legacy of “Nature Boy” Ric Flair by Tim Hornbaker (ECW Press, 2023) ISBN: 978-1-77041-626-0 can be ordered at http://www.ecwpress.com\n\nDistributed in Canada by Jaguar Book Group and in the U.S. by Baker & Taylor Publisher Services.\n\nFor information on the author, visit: http://www.legacyofwrestling.com\n\nThe Overall: Pages: 392 Language: Mild Geared For: Ages 12 and Up For Fans Of: Professional Wrestling, Biographies, Sports, Entertainment.\n\nYou can follow Lance Lumley on social media platforms @ lovelylancel\n\nProfessional wrestler Steve Keirn, along with Ian Douglass, takes readers through the life of the territory days in his book The Keirn Chronicles Volume One (Darkstream Press/WOHW, 2023).\n\nThe beginning discusses how the future wrestler’s father was a POW when originally thought his father was killed. Steve bonded with classmate Mike Graham’s father Eddie, who was a pro wrestling promoter in Florida, who became a mentor and at the time a father figure for Steve.\n\nHe started in pro wrestling as a referee and a driver who picked up the wrestlers from the airports before training with Hiro Matsuda. With classmates like future wrestlers Dick Slater and Mike Graham, it seemed to be his calling to get into the business.\n\nAfter going to Guatemala wrestling under a mask, Keirn started going to territories like Florida, Georgia, and the Mid-Atlantic areas, working his way in matches against NWA Champion Harley Race, tag-teaming with Ricky Gibson (who was involved in a funny road story about hitting a deer with a car that is told), and being on the road with Dusty Rhodes, who loved his country music which Keirn could not stand (again, a humorous tale about Keirn and Dusty seeing singer BoxCar Willie at a bar is featured).\n\nOnce working his way to being a solid worker, his relationship with the Grahams’ took a turn after an injury and was not the same again, which he sadly tells about the end of Eddie’s life. Other stories in the book talk about the legend that Keirn was to go to the WWWF under Vince McMahon Sr. instead of Bob Backlund to be the next champion and being asked to drop Sr.’s version of the NWA Jr. Championship.\n\nKeirn’s career hit another level when he went to Jerry Jarrett’s Memphis area and started teaming with Stan Lane as The Fabulous Ones, which may be where many wrestling fans know him from (and where I was first exposed to his work). The wild tales of the territory are told including how there was a glass ceiling that Jerry Lawler and Bill Dundee kept stars under, how Lawler offered Keirn money to break Chic Donovan’s leg, and who was going to be offered the spot in the Fabulous Ones if he refused to do it. Tales about The Fabulous Freebirds in Georgia, Kevin Sullivan, The Moondogs, and the visits to Vern Gagne’s AWA are also told. The popularity of the Fabulous Ones in Memphis gave a great tale about Lane and Keirn meeting The Beach Boys’ Mike Love, which being a fan of the band, I enjoyed, along with Kenny Rogers. Stories about The Road Warriors and how difficult they were to work with are explained.\n\nKeirn gives his opinion of the shape of the wrestlers in the AWA and Memphis, as well as his tale about the Ken Patera incident, which is interesting because Patera’s book is out now (you can read that review in my archives typing in the search engine), which was also published by WOHW. It’s neat to see two sides of a story on a story that has recently been brought back to life due to two books.\n\nWith two Forewards (one by Lane and the other by CM Punk), and Afterward, by Natalie Neidhart (who he helped in developmental), it shows in impact Keirn had on some of the modern stars as well. Since this is Part One of the book, his time with the WWF as Skinner and his work as a trainer, is not covered here, but brings the anticipation for that second section. This is a text fans of the territory days would enjoy, especially the Memphis tales, along with an understory about how his respect became for his father after trying to find it in another person adds something more than just another wrestling book for tales and in-ring action, along with the loyalty Stan Lane had for the team by willingly supporting Keirn when he felt the team needed a boost by either going to a different place or trying something else.\n\nDouglass and Keirn have a nice detailed outline of Keirn’s wrestling work, without bogging the reader down with a ton of dates and match results which sometimes can get to be too much in wrestling books. Again, the underlining stories are here as well showing the human side of a person who spent a ton of time in front of cameras. Douglass, who also wrote Brain Blair’s book (you can read that review in the archives), adds the mix of wrestling and emotion in his writing, and does it again here, making a page-turning entertaining read without being intimidating by the page-length. This is a Fabulous read.\n\nThis copy was sent courtesy of the author and publisher.\n\nThe Keirn Chronicles Volume One by Steve Keirn and Ian Douglass (Darkstream Press/WOHW, 2023)\n\nISBN: 979-8-218-17210-7 can be ordered at : https://iandouglass.net/\n\nThe Overall:\n\nPages: 425\n\nLanguage: Moderate\n\nGeared For: Ages 12 and Up\n\nFor Fans Of: Professional Wrestling, Non-Fiction, Sports, History.\n\nMany wrestling fans of the social media era are used to their favorite stars posting pictures of themselves hanging out with fellow wrestlers, letting them into their lives outside of the ring and the television cameras. However, this wasn’t always the case, where wrestlers in the pre-2000s mostly kept to the concept of Kayfabe, a term used tracing back to the carnival days when wrestlers kept their gimmicks going all of the time. One could argue that the only current wrestlers who keep this up to an extent are Alexa Bliss (with her current creepy persona) and The Undertaker. However, one of the greatest to keep up in on-air gimmick was the original Sheik, Ed Farhat. His life is now documented in the book Blood and Fire: The Unbelievable Real-Life Story of Wrestling’s Original Sheik by Brian R. Solomon (ECW Press, 2022).\n\nIn the territory days of wrestling, Farhat was known as the dreaded Sheik ( not to be confused with The Iron Sheik who worked in the AWA and helped Vince McMahon Jr’s WWF in the 1980s get worldwide attention). Farhat discovered wrestling while in Army during World War II, was one of ten children whose family immigrated to Michigan, and also worked in the auto factories in his early wrestling days as “The Sheik of Araby, ” taking the name from a famous Rudolph Valentino movie. Once he found his groove as a wrestler with his gimmick, Farhat lived it 24-7, even having friends and relatives refer to him as “Sheik,” refusing to answer to anyone who would call him by his real name, and even buying expensive suits and wasting money (ala an early Ric Flair) to keep the image of being a rich man with a Lebanese descent. Throughout the years would carry a sword, mumble, and give crazy eye stares in public, to keep the gimmick alive.\n\nLike many wrestlers in the 1950s and 1960s, The Sheik traveled to many territories to wrestle, including Ohio, Florida, New York (where he worked for Vince McMahon Sr), and Chicago. With the popularity of wrestling on television, the idea of a wild man chasing wrestlers and fans around the ring while blading himself to bleed, added a mix of horror to his character, which eventually became a downfall in his success. His major break occurred during a match wrestling Lou Thesz where Farhat ran away from his opponent by leaving the arena and hiding under a bus during a snowstorm, which made national news.\n\nThe Sheik wasn’t just known for his wild antics in and out of the ring, but many remember him for running the Detroit territory, which he bought in 1964 from Jim Barnett and Johnny Doyle, naming it Big Time Wrestling, where he put himself as the top star of the area (at the time, fans didn’t know he was also the man in charge, because he let his father-in-law run some of the duties). This section of the United States brought out the wild, crazy matches with stars like Bobo Brazil, Bill Curry, and George Steele. With the auto industry creating a boost in the economy, Cobo Hall was the place to be for people to spend their money after work watching wrestling matches for entertainment.\n\nSolomon details the many travels of Farhat’s career in the glory days, to when he had to withstand an invasion of promoters trying to compete for his territory, his relationship with the NWA (a board of promoters who agreed to not invade each other’s area, loaned other promotions their stars in return for others, and also decided who would be the world champions). With the mystery of his life, where Farhat was living his character all the time, the author does a wonderful job using historical research, other books, and as he mentions at the beginning of the text, all with the declining participation of the living members of Farhat’s family. This doesn’t read like a plain history book with facts and dates, but flows nicely mixing the historical data with comments from other wrestlers and people who knew him as best they could know him. Solomon also looks at the fall of Farhat’s career, especially Big Time Wrestling, where a mix of the decline of the auto factories being moved for cheaper labor, and how Farhat always put himself on top of the territory refusing to let others be the top star, refusing to “do business” with stars like a young Randy Savage, Andre The Giant, and an interesting tale involving Bruno Sammartino, where it is suggested that Farhat could have been the transitional champion in the WWWF. There is a lot of Ohio history as well (where I live), including him wrestling right before Bruiser Brody’s murder in Warren, Ohio.\n\nEven if one isn’t a major fan of The Sheik himself, Solomon gives a unique look at wrestling history, including behind the scenes of the promoters and how they ran each section of the wrestling world. He also shows how Farhat wasn’t always a tough guy on camera but a family man who also tried other businesses, including a restaurant where celebrities like The Everly Brothers visited, and Farhat’s later years helping out his nephew Sabu and ECW star Rob Van Dam in the business. There are plenty of stories about wrestling stars Freddie Blassie, Dick the Bruiser, The Funk brothers, Wilber Snyder, and more, including The Sheik’s appearances for WCW and ECW. The research put into this writing is, taking from the title, unbelievable.\n\nECW Press has always had some of the best wrestling books put out, and lately, they have raised the bar even more, with books on Andre and last year’s John Arezzi’s book, which was listed as one of the best of the year on this page (you can read the review of it by typing in the search engine). Solomon, a former writer for the WWE Magazine and Pro Wrestling Illustrated, knows how to combine the facts with stories, all without putting in his personal opinion, except in the footnotes. This reviewer had two bookmarkers while reading the text which is something never done with this reviewer; one in the chapters, and the other in the back of the book with the added footnotes, because there was so much great information that was added. Many things are going on in the book, from a look at a man who gave his life to the business with his polarizing attitude and ideas, to a look at a business history of what happened to the once-popular area and refusing to make newer stars (something that ended up repeating itself many times in the wrestling world, including promotions like World Class Wrestling, the AWA, and later on with WCW), to a look at the working-class lifestyles of Ohio and surrounding states like Michigan.\n\nThis review copy was sent courtesy of the publisher.\n\nBlood and Fire: The Unbelievable Real-Life Story of Wrestling’s Original Sheik by Brian R.

For example, many of the writers assume that many jobs are available in a person’s living area, or if they are not, the person can just pack up and move to where they are. Some writers think that employers are all willing to accommodate employees with a second job and work around another company’s schedules. Or for instance the writer suggests that everyone can be their own boss. If this was the case, there would not be any businesses or chain stores around , and many towns and cities would be empty because everyone moved to one area where there are jobs, and if everyone was their own boss, how would the economy work without the employees?\n\nWith that said, I have mentioned former wrestler Nikita Koloff on this page before. Not only was he the first villain I saw on Jim Crockett’s NWA wrestling, he is a speaker, an author, preacher, and a podcast/radio personality (you can read my review of his book Nikita: A Tale of the Ring and Redemption by typing in the search engine). Along with Jeffrey Gitomer, Wrestling With Success: Developing a Championship Mentality ( John Wiley and Sons, 2004) may be targeted as a Business/How-To book, but it is vastly different from those in the genre.\n\nThe book’s Forward is written by another former wrestler, Ted Dibiase, who was most famously known as WWF’s “Million Dollar Man,” who congratulates Koloff in and out of the ring career, with his hard work and determination.\n\nThe book has a unique format; quotes by famous people like George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and others, some writing by Koloff detailing his career and life , and a page called “Pin Down The Point for the 1-2-3,” which is a summary of the chapter, giving a nod to the wrestling world with its book title.\n\nKoloff’s story of finding the determination and positive outlook getting out of living in the Minnesota projects, playing football in college, and stepping into wrestling with no experience is a tale in itself (and is described more in detail in Nikita for the wrestling fans). Koloff’s story about breaking both legs , setting him back for a dream of playing in the NFL, is inspiring about a man who refused to stay down. He uses these experiences to point out helpful hints such as not willing to be a part of the “Roll Over Effect ” (meaning staying in bed and sleeping all day, but instead embracing the day with a solid work effort), to other positive ideas like never letting others’ opinions dictate your reality, why who you surround yourself will help or hurt you, and always being ready for opportunities (which he uses his learning Russian to help create his “Russian” wrestling character and its longevity) . He also emphasizes the “Three D’s: Desire, Determination, and Discipline.”\n\nGitomer adds his insight, usually to Koloff’s chapter topics, by using his years in business as a tool to bring out the points, but without dragging the reader down who may not be money savvy. This is not a text filled with the bottom line, statistics, or financial and corporate jargon for those who may pick up the book as a wrestling fan, but it also doesn’t alienate the readers who are not wrestling fans (or not know that Koloff isn’t really Russian).\n\nWrestling With Success also doesn’t focus just on work related issues. This is an encouraging and motivating boost to people who are just wanting a “Go Get Them” pep talk in life via a life coach on the pages. The points driven in the text are worded in a way that an average person can understand and apply to their lives, even if they are not wealthy, such as how to respond to negativity, covering the question are others around you an “inspiration or exasperation,” to just laughing at the entertaining cartoons that are placed in the end of each chapter , along with some of the authors’ humor placed in at parts. Koloff encourages the importance of reading informative books and taking time out of the day to just think.\n\nAs for wrestling stories, there is a page at the beginning of each chapter detailing the 1985 angle leading to Koloff’s match against NWA champion Ric Flair , and the buildup which started the angle. Stories about hanging with future Governor Jesse Ventura at his gym while Ventura was still wrestling, and how some jealousy among other wrestlers occurred because of Nikita’s quick push are written.\n\nOne doesn’t have to be in sales, or the corporate world to take these seemingly simple techniques and apply it to everyday life. The reason I mention “seemingly” is because they are somewhat common sense ideals, but yet due to everyday life, one makes them more complex than they should be.\n\nDon’t let other reviews on this book sway from reading. This has business ideas, but the suggestions are for everyone, no matter what career, social aspect, or age, building the foundation of the story of a person who achieved dreams and goals, while reaching (and leaving) his profession at the top of the game.\n\nWrestling With Success: Developing a Championship Mentality ( John Wiley and Sons, 2004) by Nikita Koloff and Jeffrey Gitomer ISBN: 0-471-48732-5 can ordered on Amazon or at Koloff’s website.\n\nFor information about Nikita Koloff, visit: http://www.koloff.net\n\nFor information about Jeffrey Gitomer, visit : http://www.gitomer.com\n\nThe Overall:\n\nPages: 215\n\nLanguage: None\n\nGeared For: Ages 12 and UpFor Fans Of: Pro Wrestling, Autobiographies, Sports, Self-Help, How-To, Business\n\nPro Wrestling was limited in my area of Columbiana, Ohio ( about 20 minutes south of Youngstown) between 1984-1986. I could catch WWF on WYTV (channel 33) in Youngstown on occasion, but it wasn’t until 1986 when I could catch wrestling weekly.\n\nThis was pre-cable for me. When my family finally got cable television, I could get some sort of wrestling programs daily.\n\nThe WWF had the cartoon-ish characters that were over the top, such as Roddy Piper, Hulk Hogan, and George Steele. I didn’t get regular access to wrestling until 1986, when my grandmother would tape me Saturday Nights Main Event on her VCR.\n\nThe second territory I ever saw was aired on the Cleveland channel 43 WUAB I believe, or it was Pittsburgh’s WPGH Channel 53 (I’m not exactly sure and could not find the information), which was the NWA’s Worldwide Wrestling show. Where the WWF had a more kid friendly wrestling show, the National Wrestling Alliance had a different format that kept me just in awe as the other; it had tough guys who actually wrestled.. There, stars like Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, and Wahoo McDaniel were battling for titles and pride. Three of the earliest wrestlers I can remember seeing was Dusty, Jimmy Valiant, and the evil “Russians,” consisting of Ivan Koloff, Krusher Khruschev, and Nikita Koloff. Nikita was the “nephew” of Ivan, and the three outsiders terrorized my favorite tag team The Rock ‘N’ Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson).\n\nNikita: A Tale of the Ring and Redemption (Crowbar Press, 2012) is the story of not only a walk through of Koloff’s career, but how he find a calling in the church ministry.\n\nThe book starts off with a Foreward by former wrestler Lex Luger, along with a Preface by Ted Dibiase, a former wrestler and manager, who is also now in the ministry. The early part of the text details how Koloff is really Scott Simpson, and is not even Russian, which he comically states that even at the time of the writing, people come up to him telling stories of how they thought he really was that nationality. Koloff then details his childhood growing up poor with an absent father, to playing sports and ending up getting into college to play football, where he gets injured.\n\nThere are plenty of wrestling stories here, from Nikita being friends with Road Warrior Animal, who convinces him to get into wrestling, where he is thrown into the ring with limited to no experience or training, to main eventing events with champion Ric Flair. The backstage jealousy among other wrestlers, to his friendship and mentoring by Ivan Koloff and Dusty Rhodes, and humorous tales about him saving up fifteen paychecks before cashing them to save money are told.\n\nMany memorable events in his career are covered, like the famous Best of Seven matches for the U.S. Title against Magnum T.A. (which was some of the most creative and exciting story lines at the time, even today in my opinion), His match at The Great American Bash against Flair in 1985 (which wrestling magazine Pro Wrestling Illustrated covered and became my first of many magazines I collected) his tag team title reigns against The Rock N Roll Express, to becoming the “mystery partner” of Dusty Rhodes when Magnum’s career was ended by a horrible accident, which turned Nikita into a fan favorite. There are also stories about when Koloff returned to wrestling after Ted Turner bought the league from Jim Crockett, and the many people running the league, and Koloff’s thought on this time.\n\nThe honesty of Koloff towards the wrestling industry, in and out of the ring, from bad payoffs to traveling all over the world , working at times two shows a day, along with injuries is entertaining. Koloff’s personal life is told, including the death of his first wife, and the struggles he had wondering if returning to wrestling was even an option afterwards.\n\nSome critics I have read on the book state that Koloff’s book has two flaws; there is too much back history on the sport of wrestling, where he goes into great length writing about past champions and the history of the certain titles and territories, and the second being his religion. I found neither of these as turn offs. First, there is quite a bit of historical details about certain wrestlers and the various titles’ timelines, but for the non wrestling fans who may pick up the book, they will enjoy it, and be well informed. Yes, us fans who followed wrestling for years may find it long at times with the detail, but I would prefer that over a book where the wrestler just states names and moves on without explaining who the people are. I would rather skip parts that I know than be left out of the loop, so to speak.\n\nSecondly, Koloff’s Christianity really doesn’t come into play for the most part until the last several chapters of the book- after his wrestling career is over. It is who is he is now; a speaker and founder of a ministry that builds schools, hospitals, and orphanages. As a Christian myself, I enjoyed reading about how he decided to go into this career and what called him to do it. There are some Bible verses in the text, but it is not on every page to where those critics could be easily offended. He doesn’t , though, mention his rematch against Flair at Starrcade ’86 pay per view, but focuses more on the Bash match.\n\nThe book is very entertaining, and even though it is many years old (some of the wrestlers he mentions have passed on), it is not outdated. Personall,y the only complaints on books like these is how little wrestlers have to say about my all time favorite Sting-there are some stories in here about him, but like many other NWA books, there is not much for fans like us who want to read more about him (for a guy who was the face of the league, there’s not much to say about him). Nonetheless, Nikita is a entertaining books with emotion, along with fun stories about some of the great stars from the NWA.\n\nThis copy was used from the Kindle edition (April 2014)\n\nNikita: A Tale of the Ring and Redemption by Nikita Koloff, as told by William Murdock and edited by Scott Teal (Crowbar Press, 2012) ISBN: 978-0-9844090-6-8 can be found at http://www.crowbarpress.com\n\nFor information about Nikita Koloff, go to http://www.nikitakoloff.com.\n\nThe Overall\n\nPages: 220 (This review was done using the Kindle Edition)\n\nLanguage: None\n\nGeared For: 10 yrs and Up\n\nFor Fans Of: Professional Wrestling, Sports, Non-Fiction, Autobiographies\n\nThe 1980s wrestling scene was filled with tag teams. Granted tag team wrestling was not new in the decade; wrestling had many tag teams events and stars before the 1980s, but the turn of the decade moved newer fans to wrestling, thanks to cable television and the ending of some of the territories. With newer fans, wrestlers and promoters had to create something different and make it more exciting. Teams like The Midnight Express, The Rock N Roll Express, and The Fantastics all were stars in the 1980s. However, the biggest tag team had to been The Road Warriors.\n\nJoe “Animal” Laurinaitis ‘ book The Road Warriors: Danger, Death and The Rush of Wrestling ( Medallion Press, 2011) takes the reader through his career as one half of the legendary team, telling great road stories, along with his relationship with tag partner Hawk ( Michael Hegstrand).\n\nOne of the enjoyable parts of the book is that there are not a lot of chapters detailing the childhood of Laurinatitis before his wrestling career. He sums up his high school days and pre-wrestling days all in one short chapter. Sometimes writers of biographies or autobiographies tend to spend 5-7 chapters on their early childhood, when the reader wants to just get to the stories of how they got their break. This is not to say the background of the person does not help in the storytelling, but this book was refreshing in the fact that things were summed up quickly, which separates this from other wrestling titles.\n\nFrom starting his gimmick after the Mel Gibson movie Mad Max: The Road Warrior, and knowing several future wrestlers like Scott Simpson (Nikita Koloff) and future partner Hawk at local gyms and bars in Minnesota (at one bar the bouncers were Animal, Hawk, Rick Rude, and Barry Darsow), former wrestler Eddie Sharkey trains the gang and gets Animal a shot in Georgia with booker Ole Anderson. After Anderson has a fight with Jim Barnett, Animal actually quits wrestling for a while, along with Hawk (who was being booked in Canada as a German heel). Ole comes calling later and puts together Hawk and Animal and gives them the Georgia Tag Titles (they kayfabe the win- they never even had a match for the belts).\n\nThe book then soars , just like the Road Warriors success, with great tales of them being the top tag teams in the NWA and AWA, including when AWA promoter Verne Gagne wanted the Warriors to lose the belts to The Fabulous Ones in a way where the Warriors decided to change the ending. Tales of the team winning over Japan is also included, along with the early (and eventual problematic) ways Hawk started living a party lifestyle that caused him to miss dates , where Animal had to cover for his partner, which got worse when they started working for Vince McMahon Jr. in the WWF.\n\nAnimal tells the reader about how he first thought when he witnessed Road Warrior imitators through the various promotions via the wrestling magazines, including The Blade Runners in Bill Watts’ Mid South (who later became Sting and The Ultimate Warrior), to when Hawk went to Japan and was wrestling in his own version of the Warriors without Animal knowing about it.\n\nThe honesty in the book towards Hawk’s lifestyle choices throughout his career makes the writing more than just a typical wrestling book, especially towards the end of the book, where the relationship between the two were strained. Hawk’s failed drug tests in the WWF (WWE) is detailed, where many fans may not have known about, along with the time Jake Roberts was in the WWF as an agent, along with Animal being approached to be one as well. Newer fans may not know all of the names that Animal writes about in the book; he tends to mention their names without most background stories, assuming that the reader knows who the wrestler is, but that also shows an appeal to us fans who have followed it for years.\n\nThe overall book is a easy read and is a must for those that were fans of the Jim Crockett era territories before it went worldwide when Ted Turner bought it and renamed it WCW. There were many parts of the book that I forgot about ,including when Animal was in the match (sort of) when Sid Vicious broke his leg at WCW Sin, to the hatred between Hawk and Randy “Macho Man” Savage. Another enjoyable part is at the end of the book, several wrestlers detail their thoughts on the Warriors, from Ric Flair, Roddy Piper, Dusty Rhodes, and Bret Hart. I read this book years ago on my Kindle, but recently found a hard copy at a local book sale. I enjoyed reading this book even more the second time I read it, and is one of the better wrestling books that I have come across.\n\nThe Road Warriors: Danger, Death, and The Rush of Wrestling by Joe Laurinaitis with Andrew William Wright (Medallion Press, 2011) can be found at Amazon.\n\nThe Overall:\n\nPages: 368\n\nLanguage: Moderate\n\nGeared For: 13 and up\n\nFor Fans Of: Wrestling, Sports Biographies,\n\nI first watched professional wrestling around 1984. My father showed me WWF wrestling with George “The Animal” Steele on television one Saturday afternoon, and I was hooked on it. Wrestling wasn’t on every week in my area then, so it wasn’t really until 1986 after my grandmother taped the WWF’s “Saturday Night’s Main Event” episodes on her VCR, that I got to see more of it. It wasn’t long afterwards that wrestling was on many channels in my area, along with my family getting cable TV , that I got to follow it every week.\n\nBefore the Internet, the only way to follow some of the other territories that I was not exposed to, along with learning about the history of wrestling, was through the wrestling magazines. One wrestler I knew the name of, but didn’t know much about, was Gene Kiniski, that is until I read Gene Kiniski Canadian Wrestling Legend by Steven Verrier (McFarland, 2019).\n\nThe book gives an great insight of the wrestler who won the AWA and NWA World Titles in his career, from his football days playing for the Edmonton Eskimos, to his life as a wrestler. Verrier uses great text research throughout the book to help craft the painting of who Kiniski was in and out of the ring. The writing takes the reader into how Kiniski first got into wrestling as a security person and selling programs (as a part of the University of Arizona football team), to Kiniski’s days in the many territories like Texas, Hawaii, Houston, and the big federations like the WWWF, NWA, and the AWA.\n\nOne of the great things about this biography is the research that Verrier puts into the 232 page writing. The author uses other wrestling books, newspapers, and websites to help with his stories. Verrier also details interviews from those that knew Kiniski, including his sons Nick and Kelly (who both wrote forwards and helped with some of the photographs), and other wrestlers. The stories about Kiniski’s personal life, with his marriage and raising his sons, add a different perspective to the writing, as opposed to the normal wrestling books, where drugs and sex are sometimes the main theme. This book is what one would use for a college course in teaching about wrestlers in the territory days.\n\nI learned quite a bit about some of the tag team partners and other opponents that Kiniski faced; I knew he beat Verne Gagne for the AWA World Title, and Lou Thesz for the NWA Title, but he was in the ring with many of the greats such as The Funks, Dick The Bruiser, Fritz Von Erich, Pedro Morales, and more. His tag teams with Ivan Koloff, Wilbur Synder, and “Hard Boiled” Hagerty shows he worked with some of the best.\n\nFor those that may only remember Kiniski’s sons in the AWA, or that he was the referee at Starrcade 1983 for the Ric Flair vs Harley Race main event, will learn quite a bit by reading this book. I remember his son Nick in the AWA, being managed by both Sherri Martel and Madusa Miceli in their early days. The years after his retirement as a promoter and wrestling a few times (like the WWF legends battle royal in 1987 and his appearance at WCW’s “Slamboree” PPV), along with his life outside of the ring, brings an emotional segment to the story, where quite a bit of the book features a history of his in ring career.\n\nGene Kiniski Canadian Wrestling Legend is a nice read full of facts and interviews that create the story of a wrestler who most of today’s wrestling fans never heard of. The book gives those that want to know more about the wrestling of the 1960s and 1970s stars a history lesson. The textbook or essay format may not be very colorful compared to some of the books released today, but that is also what makes it a good read. This is an almanac of the days when one wrestler didn’t need a flashy gimmick to get over, and still ended up being considered one of the best.\n\nThis review copy was sent courtesy of McFarland Books.\n\nGene Kiniski Canadian Wrestling Legend by Steven Verrier (ISBN: 978-1-4766-7483-4 eISBN: 978-1-4766-3427-2) can be ordered at http://www.McFarlandbooks.com or at 800-253-2187.\n\nFor information about the author, go to http://www.stevenverrier.com\n\nThe Overall:\n\nPages: 254\n\nLanguage: None\n\nGeared For: 13 and up.\n\nFor Fans Of: Pro Wrestling History, Biographies.\n\nTim Hornbaker’s “Death Of The Territories: Expansion, Betrayal, and the War that Changed Pro Wrestling Forever” (ECW Press, 2018) is a historical lesson covering how the end of the wrestling territories came to be and the reasons for the demise.\n\nBefore the WWF took over wrestling in the 1980s, there were many different territories where wrestlers could go and , in some cases, get quality television exposure. If a wrestler’s appeal with the audience was wearing thin, they could go to a territory and either revamp their characters, or learn more skills before returning months or years later.\n\nSome of the many states that had their own territories included Memphis, Texas, Florida, the Carolinas, California, and St. Louis, which were all run by different promoters. Many of them bonded together as part of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), until divisions started when Vince McMahon Jr. bought his father’s company and started invading the territories for their stars.\n\nHornbaker’s book covers many of the different promoters like Bill Watts, Joe Blanchard, Leory McGuirk, Jim Barnett , and Verne Gagne. Other promoters covered in his history include The Poffos, The Sheik (Ed Farhat), Ann Gunkle , Don Owen, and the Fullers.\n\nThe book covers how each of the special territories ran their local television productions. Some of the main television programs were WCCW (from Texas) and the AWA (Minnesota) on ESPN, Jim Crockett Promotions and Georgia Championship Wrestling on WTBS, and the WWF’s syndicated programs, which started invading the other television stations with better deals for the advertisers by giving them bigger star names, which became a main reason the other leagues folded.\n\nOne of the interesting parts of the book is when the author details how some companies would try and enter the other’s area, and with the help of researched attendance numbers, show that some of the fans in certain areas of the United States did not accept the WWF when they ran shows. Memphis was one state that held better television and attendance numbers for their own stars, like Jerry Lawler, as opposed to lower numbers when the WWF tried to come into the area. There were areas where the WWF ran shows that barely drew at the time, as opposed to the myth that every state wanted the WWF in its town.\n\nThe story of Vince McMahon Jr’s rise to the wrestling empire by using business techniques such as banning other photographers from his ringside area, to his use of pay per view to help the product, and grabbing stars from other areas are all covered here, including when he aired WWF programming on WTBS. Georgia Championship Wrestling’s booker Ole Anderson’s counter to this time is also interesting, as well as how the other promoters and bookers handled the WWF invading their areas.\n\nI was also intrigued when Hornbaker writes in 1983, McMahon Jr. took over the Ohio region with his show being on Channel 23 in Akron (one of the channels I watched WWF on when I started fully watching in 1986), and also held shows in East Liverpool and Struthers, Ohio (both not far from where I live). It was nice to see my local area covered in the book (mostly the WWF was big in Warren and Youngstown when I started watching and attending, although an occasional Struthers show would be held).\n\nThe book covers the rise of Jim Crockett Jr.’s taking over the Carolinas, which became so popular that most of the fans called his league the NWA, although there were many other members of the NWA, until Ted Turner bought out Crockett and renamed it WCW (World Championship Wrestling) to avoid confusion with the other NWA territories that were still running shows.\n\nThe history of the territories would not be complete without covering the AWA, Memphis, and World Class mergers in trying to keep their leagues afloat, with the WCW and WWF being the big two leagues. The AWA at one time was considered one of the big three leagues, but with Verne Gagne losing steam, the idea to try and co-promote was attempted.\n\nHornbaker’s writing is entertaining without having a bunch of dates confusing and boring the reader, and his research is wonderfully detailed, so those that want to know the historical dates won’t be disappointed either. He covers the events in readable chapters without bogging down the reader that they are reading a textbook. There is so much information on the topic, he could have easily have made it 300 pages long, but Hornbaker keeps it at a pleasant 241 pages of text (not counting the pages of book notes). The author also doesn’t become one of the “I hate the WWF for taking over” people, nor does join the argument that “All things WWF is great” either. He writes a nice non- judgmental book where the numbers and the research makes the readers decide for themselves.\n\nBeing a lover of the territory days (I am in the minority apparently who loved the AWA years after 1983 when they lost many stars like Hulk Hogan, Jesse Ventura, and Bobby Heenan- the Bockwinkle/Hennig matches are still some of the most underrated matches ever). This book is a must read for those who want to re-live the days, along with learning information that you may not have known (I for one did not know that Gagne once tried to negotiate a deal to sell out to McMahon Jr, long before he folded the league). “Death of The Territories” is a book that needs to be on every wrestling historian and fans’ book shelf.\n\nThis review copy was given courtesy of ECW Press.\n\n“Death of The Territories” by Tim Hornbaker (ECW Press, 2018) IBSN: 978-1-77041-384-9 (softcover), 978-1-77305-232-8 (ePub) , 978-1-77305-233-5 (PDF) can be found at http://www.ecwpress.com\n\nFor information on the author, go to twitter@TimHornbaker."
