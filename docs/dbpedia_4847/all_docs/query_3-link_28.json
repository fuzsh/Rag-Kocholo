        "text": "\"From 1987 through 1990, that heavy metal rift became the anthem for two of the most punishing athletes to possibly ever join the World Wrestling Federation. There was Ax, there was Smash and then there was DEMOLITION.\n\nAs three-time WWF Tag-team champions, Demolition (managed by Mr. Fuji) dominated the late 80's by using one of the most brutal ring styles in the history of sports-entertainment. With a reckless seek and destroy attitude, Ax and Smash used the combination of devastating power and crippling wrestling maneuvers to annihilate their opponents. With their faces painted for war and their bodies clad in black and chrome, Demolition was there for one reason only...to bring about TOTAL ARMAGEDDON!!\n\nFrom the bell, the strategy was simple: ATTACK, ATTACK, ATTACK, ATTACK!! Demolition had no time to waste. The sooner they could pound their opponents into oblivion, the better. At Wrestlemania IV, the team Strike Force (Tito Santana and Rick Martel) found out that their usual speed and quickness were not enough to escape the brutal beating being forced upon them by Demolition. Over the course of the next two years, Demolition would go on to capture the Tag Team title on yet two more occasions.\n\nIn 1990, Ax and Smash added a new member to the group, CRUSH, but toward the end of that year the \"terrible trio\" decided to quit just months after being upset at Summerslam '90 by The Hart Foundation (Jim \"the Anvil\" Neidhart and Bret \"Hitman\" Hart).\""
