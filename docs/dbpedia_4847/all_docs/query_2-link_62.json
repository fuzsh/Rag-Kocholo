        "text": "WWF Survivor Series Showdown 1992 – 11/22/92\n\nSpringfield, IL\n\nConvention Center\n\n(taped on October 26, 1992)\n\nI was very excited to watch another classic USA pay per view special. I’ve read a number of negative reviews on this show, but I could give two shits. I love this era and this time period and I’m so fascinated by the turmoil behind the scenes.\n\nThe WWF was in chaos during this time and were desperately trying to save their pay per view after the surprise firing of the Ultimate Warrior. They played the only card they had left, with Macho Man shockingly asking Mr. Perfect to be his partner against Flair and Ramon. I remember my jaw hitting the floor when watching this as a kid – what the hell happened to the Ultimate Warrior?? I couldn’t believe the insanity during that fall. Seeing Mr. Perfect accept Savage’s proposal and turn on Heenan and Flair was totally mindblowing and I was immediately a Mr. Perfect fan for the first time ever.\n\nThis shocking turn of events is the main focus of this entire show. Gorilla Monsoon and Bobby Heenan are on commentary together and are simply amazing at getting this angle over. Heenan is incensed at Perfect and can barely think straight, and Monsoon keeps egging him on. Considering they had a week to fix their main event, this is a masterclass in damage control. Every player played their role to, ahem, perfection. In kayfabe storylines, it actually was believable that egocentric Perfect would accept the offer to tag with a hated foe like Savage, if that meant getting himself back in the spotlight. From a character standpoint, it was an immediate chance to jump into a main event, as high profile a match as possible. And that’s why fans bought into it. Days earlier fans detested Mr. Perfect, but immediately they were on his side. The biggest heel in the company was still Ric Flair and anyone who opposed Flair had to be cheered for. Add in the equally detestable Razor Ramon and the sympathetic former champ Macho Man. As a Plan B, it was pretty fucking fantastic how well the pieces fit.\n\nThey showed the clips from Prime Time throughout the show. Bobby Heenan was so damn amazing, interrupting Perfect and answering for him, to the point where Perfect gets fed up and accepts Savage’s offer, prompting Heenan to slap him across the face. And there’s the moment. There’s the moment that legitimizes the unexpected and thrilling face turn of Mr. Perfect. Fucking perfection! I love the WWF and don’t care what anyone else\n\n1) Tatanka pinned Repo Man with the Samoan Drop at 7:42\n\nAfter all the excitement, we open with… Tatanka vs Repo Man lol. With all the stars to focus on for Survivor Series, this is a bit of a head scratcher. Not that I’m complaining mind you! I’m always down for a Repo Man match. The action is secondary to the phenomenal commentary of Monsoon and Heenan. Tatanka wins this straightforward battle. No surprise, but it was great as always seeing the Repo Man in action.\n\nUp next Shawn Michaels (the GREATEST Intercontinental champion of all time according to Heenan) joins Monsoon and Heenan to provide commentary for a re-showing of his IC victory over the Bulldog. I just skipped this over.\n\n2) Marty Jannetty pinned the Brooklyn Brawler with the flying fistdrop at 4:58; during the bout, the Clown was shown in the crowd\n\nI’ve always thought it was unfortunate that Jannetty wasn’t featured at Survivor Series in some capacity. His surprise return was hot fire. He could have done an interview or appeared in the aisle or a quick win over a goof like Skinner, anything, but nope. Strange then that he’s featured on the Showdown. This was a fun showcase and Jannetty looked great. Too bad he fucked up again by the Rumble and was gone again for a few months. And of course we get to see the mysterious Clown out in the crowd!\n\n3) Kamala (w/ Harvey Wippleman & Kimchee) pinned Red Tyler at 3:27 with a chop to the throat and a splash\n\nUnlike past pay per view specials, this one has quite a few jobber matches. Fun role reversal on commentary, as Heenan questions how Kamala can even beat the Undertaker, and Monsoon puts Kamala over as a dangerous individual. Too bad Kamala ends up looking like an idiot as he forgets how to pin his opponent and keeps trying to pin him on his stomach. I remember this being a big part of his face act, but don’t remember him doing it as a heel.\n\nIn between the matches we get a lot of great features, like interviews from Flair and Ramon (Flair’s insanity really put over the Perfect turn), Undertaker in his workshop, the Bret Hart music video, and a Survivor Series report. I remember when watching Series with Matt at his grandma’s there was quite a bit of mystery as to who Yokozuna’s opponent would be. Damn was it hilarious when it turned out to be Virgil in the end.\n\nWe get highlights from Money Inc defeating the Natural Disasters for the tag team championships and the subsequent face turn of the Nasty Boys. The Nasties turn was great, but the Disasters sure sucked as faces by this point. Earthquake losing to the Million $ Dream was so fucking lame. This was a former monster who nearly ended Hulk Hogan’s career!\n\n4) Earthquake defeated WWF Tag Team Champion IRS (w/ Jimmy Hart) via disqualification at 11:01 when WWF Tag Team Champion Ted Dibiase tripped Earthquake as he attempted the sit-down splash; mid-way through the bout, Typhoon and Dibiase made their way ringside to cheer on their respective tag team partners; after the match, Dibiase injured Earthquake’s eye before Typhoon got in the ring, scaring Money Inc. to the floor\n\nHoly shit, why is there an Earthquake singles match at nearly all of these Series Showdowns? Why always him?? This match is beyond slow and boring. I was checking hockey scores and reading sports news while the former mighty Earthquake sold IRS’s sleep-inducing offense. This just drags forever before the inevitable and super lame DQ finish. Pretty sad to see Quake as such a loser late into his original WWF run. They run some angle after the match where Dibiase jams some object into Quake’s eye, supposedly injuring it. I have no recollection of this eye injury at all. I think it was completely forgotten about by the PPV. We get a great bad guy interview after the match, but man, this was just pure shit.\n\n5) Big Bossman pinned Barry Horowitz at 3:27 with the sidewalk slam\n\nIt’s crazy that the Bossman-Nailz feud began back in May! It was such a huge deal to finally get to this nightstick match after months and months of Nailz insanity and destroying jobbers. I’d love to see some of the regular Bossman-Nailz matches, but I doubt they’ll ever see the light of day.\n\n6) The Headshrinkers (w/ Afa) defeated Red Fox & Royce Royal at 2:42 when Fatu scored the pin with the splash off the top\n\nThe Headshrinkers were an exciting and somewhat scary team early in their run. They really beat the shit out of their jabroni opponents. The Shrinkers were a huge boost to the tag division and had some tremendous matches over the next year. They were really playing up the savage gimmick still at this point, with Fatu picking his nose and sticking it into the jobber’s mouth, before they ended this one easily.\n\nNext is a long, like over 10 minute, interview with Bret Hart and Vince McMahon sitting on a hill while leaves are falling and the sun is shining. Vince is wearing this hilarious teal windbreaker that cracked me up. Bret was still really uncomfortable with interviews, but he tried hard here. They were really working hard at putting him over as a true people’s champion, a fighting champion – something I bought into 100% back then. He talks about defending the title against opponents like the Berzerker and Virgil and his plan for taking on Shawn Michaels. Vince is feeding him topics, they discuss Bret not being flamboyant like Hulk Hogan or Ric Flair, but about being simply the best wrestler, the best champion. This was so out of the ordinary. It was captivating to see Vince trying to re-image his company on the fly.\n\nThe show concludes with highlights of the Undertaker building the custom coffin for Kamala, which we’ve seen a hundred times already!\n\nThis was definitely the weakest of all the USA specials so far, but I still really enjoyed it. I really love the chaos and insanity that define this era and how shocking all these firings, turns, and title changes ended up being.\n\nWWF Saturday Night’s Main Event #31 – 11/14/92\n\nTerre Haute, IN\n\nHullman Center\n\n(taped on October 27, 1992 )\n\nSadly we’re at the end of the line for the classic run of SNME. This would be the last SNME up until the short-lived revival in the mid 00s. I remember being super pumped for this particular episode because, as outlined in the SummerSlam report, I was riding the peak of fandom at this point and couldn’t wait to see anything and everything WWF. Fall 92 had so many storylines and crazy developments and it was a super exciting time to be a fan.\n\nThe pattern of tumultuous booking continued into the fall. A bunch of hasty decisions had to be made and any storyline stability coming out of SummerSlam was quickly thrown in the garbage for so many reasons. The biggest piece of news about to hit the airwaves was the firing of the Ultimate Warrior, merely a week after this show. The writing was already on the wall, with the looming steroid trial and the problems between the Ultimate Warrior and Vince backstage, including the Warrior injuring Ric Flair and throwing the heavyweight title picture completely out of whack. I’ve read all sorts of details about what went down in fall 1992, and essentially a two year contract was terminated. A contract that would have seen the Warrior main eventing a lot of PPVs throughout 1993 and into early 1994.\n\nBecause of the Ultimate Warrior’s reckless style, Ric Flair suffered an inner-ear injury that was thought to be serious enough to put him on the shelf for months, leading to McMahon hastily calling upon Bret Hart – dependable, reliable, and very over in developing markets in Europe – to receive the honors to defeat Flair at a TV taping in Saskatoon. This came mere weeks after Flair regained the title from Savage, and completely threw off all booking for the rest of 1992 and into 1993 and also further lead to Flair heading back to WCW. Many suggest that the original main event of Wrestlemania IX was penciled in as Ric Flair vs Ultimate Warrior.\n\nAnother causality of this era was the British Bulldog. Despite having the greatest match and moment of his career in London, he was a mess outside of the ring, and more so, was caught along with the Ultimate Warrior with illegal growth hormones, thus resulting in his own firing. I remember at the time, the firings of the Warrior and Bulldog even made the newspaper, as did the steroid scandal in general. The Bulldog was always scheduled to drop the title to Shawn Michaels, but it would end up being much earlier than originally planned.\n\nThe very last SNME opens with Married with Children’s Al Bundy and his dog getting ready for some WWF action. It was both funny and surreal to hear Al Bundy in character talk about watching the WWF! Vince McMahon and Bobby Heenan are on commentary once again (I wonder where Gorilla was during summer and early fall?) and continue their amazing banter from SummerSlam.\n\n1) Randy Savage & the Ultimate Warrior defeated WWF Tag Team Champions Ted Dibiase & IRS (w/ Jimmy Hart) via count-out when the champions walked out of the match; after the bout, the challengers caught up to the champions in the aisle and assaulted them until they were attacked from behind by Ric Flair, Razor Ramon, and Mr. Perfect\n\nWow! What a way to kick off the show! The Ultimate Maniacs are one of the greatest “what ifs?” in WWF history. The SummerSlam storyline perfectly set up this team, and fans were beyond excited to have the two biggest faces, Warrior and Savage, finally on the same page for the first time. I loved the intensity and insanity from the Maniacs as they mow through Money Inc in the early going. I loved seeing the weird combination of the Warrior and IRS in the ring. I wonder if they ever wrestled before this? This match is pretty much all Maniacs, but the champs do get in some offense. Flair, Perfect, and Razor Ramon are watching on a monitor backstage. This combo was tremendous, and what a way to elevate a new character like Ramon. It’s a shame that the Macho-Ramon feud never had a proper blowoff or PPV match. Also, it’s so strange to think about Mr. Perfect’s hasty face turn a week later. He’s such an awesome asshole heel here, hard to believe they’d manage to pull off a turn a week after this PPV. Dibiase and IRS simply have enough and roll to the outside to collect their titles, walking to the back and taking the countout loss. Hahaha! Classic dick heel move. BUT it’s all a setup! As Savage and Warrior chase after them, Flair, Ramon, and Perfect jump them in the aisle! Man, what a main event that would have been at Survivor Series. This is a chaotic brawl and I loved this storyline. It was such a humongous shock to me as a kid when they announced the Warrior was gone the following week on Superstars.\n\nNext they showed one of my favorite music videos the company ever produced; the Tom Petty “Makin Some Noise” video promoting new WWF champion Bret Hart. This video is amazing, featuring clips of Bret’s matches, mixed with footage of Stu Hart teaching two kids in the dungeon. They aired this a ton of times throughout fall 1992, really trying to get over their new champion. All the credit in the world to Bret for unexpectedly having to carry the weight of the company on his back.\n\n2) Shawn Michaels pinned WWF IC Champion Davey Boy Smith to win the title at 10:26 when the champion failed a superplex, with Michaels landing on top for the pin, after hitting his back against an exposed turnbuckle\n\nAnother huge shock to me at the time. Title changes happened fast and furious throughout 1992 and this one really caught me by surprise, as even during the match, they were still hyping the Bulldog defending the title against the Mountie at Survivor Series. This is the end of the line for the Bulldog, as he’s fired after this TV taping and wouldn’t be back for two years. The Mountie had also quit before this, and another vet was out of the company. For Shawn Michaels, this was just the beginning of his singles journey. Watching this live, I thought for sure the Bulldog would be able to steamroll Michaels. To me, he was a legit main event superstar, and he was heavily hyped in all the Apter mags at the time. It’s a great battle, as Bulldog and Shawn had a natural chemistry that would thankfully be revisited three years later during their 96 feud. The most impressive spot that’s always stood out for me is the Bulldog picking up Shawn Michaels rolled up in a ball with one arm. Damn that still looks so cool, even now! Michaels does a great job of working over the Bulldog’s back, setting up the shocking conclusion when the Bulldog’s back gives out during a superplex and Michaels falls on him for the pin. The crowd is in shock, as was I as a little kid, and history has been made.\n\n3) WWF World Champion Bret Hart defeated Papa Shango via submission with the Sharpshooter\n\nAs I touched on in my SummerSlam report, this was actually a feud. Shango appeared during a Bret jobber match before Slam and put a curse on the Hitman. This wasn’t mentioned at the PPV, but was picked up on after, as commentators debated whether or not it was a reason for Bret losing to the Bulldog. Bret had initially more to do with Shango than Michaels in the build up to Survivor Series. This is a great match that’s all action from bell to bell. Shango will forever be one of my favorite monster heels and it’s awesome watching him battle back and forth with the Hitman. As a little kid, part of me really hoped Shango would win the title, but even then, I knew that was a far-fetched probability. Bret survives the battle and locks Shango in the sharpshooter to conclude this mini feud. After this, Shango’s relevancy in the WWF bottomed out and he wasn’t involved in any more storylines going forward.\n\nMean Gene is standing by to interview the Hitman, when Shawn Michaels suddenly bursts in holding up the IC title. They argue back and forth, setting up what’s now a champion vs champion match at Survivor Series. Really unbelievable looking back on it. Bret vs Shawn was signed as a mid-card Survivor Series match, and now suddenly they’re both holding the two major singles titles in the company and will be main eventing the PPV! What a wild time in WWF history!\n\nThe show concludes with a special Funeral Parlor segment with Paul Bearer interviewing the Undertaker. It was a classic “Kamalahhhh…..” promo from the Undertaker. Nothing else new, other than putting over the casket match.\n\nOne final quick segment with Vince and Bobby pops up. Heenan suddenly gets a phone call and is in shock when he hears that one of the Ultimate Maniacs won’t be making it to the Survivor Series! Did they already know about the Warrior’s firing before this taping? What a crazy finish!\n\nWWF SummerSlam 1992\n\nLondon, England\n\nWembley Stadium\n\nAugust 29, 1992\n\nOver Christmas holidays I was excited to watch what is still my favorite pay per view of all time. It’s truly impossible for me to be objective in discussing this event. It’s one of a handful of “chicken soup” ppvs for me; a ppv that fills with me with instant joy and happiness, one that I can throw on at any point in my life and instantly feel the warm magic of being 12 years old all over again.\n\nI could write an entire dissertation on this PPV, could probably even get a masters in 1992 WWF history should such a thing exist (nope, it doesn’t), but I will refrain from being too overly detailed. You know the story – my WWF fandom exploded in 1992. Never had I been so excited to see a PPV before this one. Don’t get me wrong – I had been plenty excited to see previous events, but never like this. The anticipation I had for SummerSlam began the instant they made the announcement that it would be taking place in Wembley Stadium. It wasn’t long after that I saw the latest edition WWF Magazine, promoting Macho Man vs Ultimate Warrior, which hadn’t even been announced on TV yet!\n\nA quick background – My excitement continued to build over the summer. Part of the anticipation was where and how I would be seeing this event. PPV was new to the city that summer, and I remember excitedly watching the PPV preview channel, promoting SummerSlam. There was some talk in my family at one point about ordering the event at my grandpa’s house, but that never happened. Watching it with Matt at his grandma’s was an unknown as his interest in the WWF had faded and I remember him being away for part of the summer. Finally towards the end of August, Matt called me with the exciting news that yes, I would in fact be invited over to his grandma’s house with him and his family to watch Slam. Winning a million dollars wouldn’t have even come close to this feeling of excitement at that age.\n\nSummerslam more than delivered. The entire show felt so huge, magical and special and I still have crystal clear memories of sitting in Matt’s grandma’s living room watching the event. The classic story is that Matt didn’t know who a lot of the newcomers were, so I took great pleasure in explaining characters like Crush and Nailz. When grade six started, my wrestling pals wanted to know every detail and result and of course this all lead to the hilarious and infamous after school viewing of the tape at my house, which lead to nothing but fights.\n\nMonths later, I came across one of the Apter mags in Safeway, which had a special full color feature on SummerSlam. To my astonishment – there were THREE extra matches not included on the PPV! I remember being irritated while watching the PPV that the announced Tatanka-Berzerker match never happened, but I couldn’t believe that it DID actually take place, along with two other opening dark matches! I burned these images into my brain and for years wished that I could have seen the complete card.\n\nFast forward to the late 00s. Once I got into downloading wrestling torrents, I shockingly came across the COMPLETE SummerSlam PPV! It turns out that those extra matches had all been shown on Prime Time and were later included in the special UK home video release. It was one of the first things I downloaded and watched. It was a surreal, dreamlike experience, finally seeing those extra matches that had been burned in my mind since fall 92.\n\nI haven’t watched SummerSlam as a complete card in nearly 10 years, so it was definitely due time to park myself on the couch and enjoy this whole show start to finish, with all the extra matches.\n\nIt’s amazing to me how immensely popular the WWF was in Europe in 1992, despite the sag in business in North America. Having watched those European Rampage shows from post Mania, the WWF was red hot overseas, selling out arenas with shitty main events like the British Bulldog vs IRS. It’s incredible to look back on the sellout of nearly 80,000 fans at Wembley, considering this was the first PPV of the post Hulk Hogan era. I wonder how many casual fans who bought tickets to SummerSlam even realized that the Hulkster wouldn’t be there? I noticed quite a few Hulk Hogan signs in the crowd. But even more telling was just how over all the upper faces were – LOD, Ultimate Warrior, Randy Savage, Undertaker, Bret Hart, the British Bulldog all received MONSTER pops. Not always easy in an outdoor stadium, but the support was unanimous and people were visibly losing their shit over these top level faces. Why did this popularity not transcend to American audiences? I’m sure they were still over, but not to the extent as they were across the Atlantic.\n\nSummerSlam has the same classic opening with all the English pageantry, interviews with fans, etc. Vince McMahon and Bobby Heenan are on commentary, and immediately have me in stitches. I’d wager to say that this is Vince and Bobby at their best. Definitely an underrated commentary duo, and to me they were never funnier together. Heenan has a ridiculous crown, and the look of disgust on Vince’s face when he sees Heenan putting it on is pure gold!\n\n1) Hacksaw Jim Duggan & the Bushwhackers defeated the Mountie & the Nasty Boys (w/ Jimmy Hart) at 12:37 when Duggan pinned the Mountie after the Mountie sustained the Bushwhackers’ battering ram, Duggan’s running clothesline, and then Jerry Saggs’ flying elbowsmash when Duggan moved out of the way as he had the Mountie covered\n\nThis throwaway six man tag is a testament to the WWF’s popularity in England. Duggan and the Whackers are HUGELY over with the crowd, including a fucking USA chant! Wrestling quality is virtually non-existent, but this match more than serves its purpose of warming up the crowd and getting them excited for the show. I also thought it would have made more sense to have the Nasty Boys get the shots against the Disasters, but it was actually leading up to the angle of the Nasties turning on Jimmy Hart in the coming months. The Mountie was such a zany character, I love the disgust in McMahon’s voice as the Mountie marches to the ring singing along with his theme music. He was in a feud with Sgt Slaughter at this point that ended up going nowhere. Duggan ends up pinning the Mountie for the win after all sorts of zany brawling with the Bushwhackers and Nasty Boys. Damn, I wish they had showed this whole PPV in full at the time because these geeky matches are just so much fun!\n\n2) Papa Shango pinned El Matador at 6:12 with the reverse shoulderbreaker after Santana hit the corner face-first\n\nWord has it that Shango and the Warrior were originally penciled in for the planned Washington DC SummerSlam, but of course all those plans were scrapped when the show was rebooked for London. Also interesting, Papa Shango was then announced to face the Texas Tornado on the main SummerSlam PPV. I’ve even seen a clip of Mean Gene announcing the match and interviews with both guys. The Tornado was a liability at this point, so was just dropped off this card. It’s weird how Shango beat jobbers endlessly on TV, but was never really given any victories over guys like Matador and Tornado on TV. According to Bret Hart, it was because of Pat Patterson’s return over summer that guys like Shango were shunted down the card and his feud with the Warrior was dropped. So many interesting tidbits from this era! Heenan had me full on roaring with laughter during this match as he endlessly mocked El Matador, making jokes about the “dead chihuahua and shower curtain” that he brought down to the ring with him. Man, Heenan’s commentary was on point throughout this whole show! El Matador put Shango to the test as expected, but it was the evil Voodoo man who soon overpowered Tito and put him away with the shoulderbreaker. 12 year old me would have marked out hard had this been on the actual PPV, but little did I know that Shango’s stock was on the way down. Shango did however start a feud with Bret shortly before Slam, putting a curse on him, in a mini story that lasts up until the October SNME, but really, Shango was never presented as much of a threat to the Hitman.\n\n3) The Legion of Doom (w/ Paul Ellering & Rocco) defeated Ted Dibiase & IRS (w/ Jimmy Hart) when Road Warrior Animal pinned Dibiase with a powerslam at 12:00 after Dibiase collided with IRS on the apron\n\nSo bizarre to see this as the third match. It works so well as a PPV opener, especially with LOD arriving on motorcycles, wearing those cool shiny gold shoulder pads. This is the last hurrah of the original run of the LOD/Road Warriors. After this event, Hawk disappeared in the UK, riding off with Hell’s Angels and doing hard drugs for the next couple months, abandoning Animal and their WWF careers. LOD would officially be canned in the fall, and the team was never truly the same ever again. They had short stints of greatness, but were forever a shell of their former selves. The feud between LOD and Money Inc had been brewing for months by this point, and the UK fans were more than ready to see LOD annihilate IRS and Dibiase. Of course the funniest part of this match is the presence of Paul Ellering and Rocco, cheering on LOD at ringside. And another note – the white suit/trunks combo Dibiase wears was so sweet. What a phenomenal look, perfect for a show of this caliber. This is an excellently paced match, and the powerslam finish is just amazing. As a kid I thought it was beyond weird when LOD disappeared from TV after this event and soon I’d be reading in the Apter mags about Hawk disappearing and Crush filling in for him on tour cards.\n\n4) Nailz defeated Virgil via KO with a choke; after the match, Nailz assaulted Virgil with the Big Bossman’s nightstick\n\nAhhh yeah, Nailz! The debut of Nailz was one of the coolest things. I remember being sickened by the beating he laid in on the Bossman and the horrible pictures from WWF Magazine showing bruises all over the Bossman’s body. The character of Nailz was just tremendous and was played perfectly. I always get a laugh out of internet nerds complaining about Nailz’s matches. What the fuck do you expect?! The guy is a psycho ex-con! Of course his matches should be all punches and chokes! Also, don’t forget the classic Virgil “to legit to quit” interview before this match, which, along with his friendship with the Big Bossman, would spawn a million laughs for Matt and myself throughout grade six. This match is just a perfect showcase for Nailz, and once again Bobby Heenan had me in hysterics making fun of Virgil and showing sympathy for Nailz. The after match beatdown is just as classic, with Heenan getting in the immortal line about the ‘good soccer kick’ when Nailz boots Virg in the ribs. Fun stuff!\n\n5) Shawn Michaels (w/ Sensational Sherri) fought Rick Martel to a double count-out when both men began fighting over Sherri on the floor; after the match, Martel dumped a pail of water over Sherri’s face to revive her from fainting; pre-match stipulations made by Sherri stated that neither man could punch the other in the face\n\nTwo face vs face championship matches and an ultra rare heel vs heel singles match – just like McMahon kept saying, this is definitely the SummerSlam you thought you’d never see! Part of this event’s appeal to me is it’s sheer uniqueness, with this out-of-the-ordinary booking. This match features the greatest outfit Sherri ever wore to ringside. It was easily the skimpiest outfit to show up on a WWF PPV up to this point and would remain so for years. I love the subtlety in the commentary too, as rather than perving out like Lawler would later do, Heenan made quips about the moon being out in London and the like. It’s PG, but PG done right. Despite being embroiled in a feud with Tatanka, this detour storyline with Michaels made sense, as it kept Shawn relevant leading up to his planned IC title run. I really enjoyed the goofy “no hitting in the face” storyline and I loved how these two cocky heels constantly tried to cheat and one up each other. The sequence where they keep using the tights to roll each up is super funny, as is Heenan’s quip about never seeing so many smiles in his life. The ending is kind of shit as Sherri pretends to faint when they begin hitting each other in the face and they stop the match, leading to the lame double countout. However, I don’t know how else you could have finished it, maybe with Michaels going over? But Martel was still strong in the mid-card at this time too, so it’s tough to say. The whole thing with fighting over carrying Sherri to the back takes a little too long, but the payoff is funny, with Martel dumping a bucket of water on Sherri to revive her. Have I mentioned yet how amazing Sherri’s outfit was? Mannnn…..\n\nAfter this is an interview I never really paid much attention to before, as Mean Gene is standing by with the Nasty Boys. They cackle about Sherri getting doused with water and Knobbs thought the Wicked Witch was supposed to melt when she got wet. They rant and rave about not getting the tag title shots since they beat Savage and the Warrior at Summerslam Spectacular, but Jimmy Hart has promised them that title matches will be forthcoming. I never really paid attention to the fact that this one interview was sowing the seeds for the upcoming Nasty Boys face turn. Fascinating.\n\n6) WWF Tag Team Champions the Natural Disasters defeated the Beverly Brothers (w/ the Genius)\n\nThis has always been my least favorite match on the card. The Beverly’s felt so random in getting this title shot, as they hadn’t done anything of note all year other than beating the Bushwhackers. This match plods along, and it’s weird seeing a former monster like Earthquake selling so much for Beau and Blake. The most notable part of the match for me was watching the light slowly fade around Wembley as dusk starts to settle. This kind of thing always made these super cards feel so long and epic to me, especially when time felt longer as a kid.\n\n7) Crush defeated Repo Man via submission with the head vice\n\nMan, Crush’s face run sure sucked in the end. He started so strong but wasn’t ever given anything meaningful to do. He looked like a complete loser in his feud with Doink and even failed in his IC title feud with Michaels. They should have just brought him in as a heel right out of the gate and paired him against the Undertaker or something. Night has fallen in London as we get to the phenomenal second half of Summerslam. The Apter mags billed this as Demolition exploding, something that never even really crossed my mind when this match was announced, given how drastically different Repo and Crush both seemed compared to the Demolition days. Repo Man was of course one of my all-time favorites, and it was so cool getting to see him at this PPV. Watching it now, I was surprised at how much offense Repo was able to get in on Crush. He even impressively plants him with a back suplex! As cornball as the Repo gimmick was, the fact that the announcers played it straight and Repo was so good in the role made it work perfectly. Crush eventually gets the best of his former tag team partner, and squeezes his skull with the head vice, getting a huge pop from the fans. Too bad for Crush, he doesn’t make it to Series or the Rumble and his face run never really takes off.\n\n8) The Ultimate Warrior defeated WWF World Champion Randy Savage via count-out after Savage attempted to hit a double axe handle off the top on Ric Flair at ringside but instead Flair hit the champion’s knee with a chair on the way down; Flair and Mr. Perfect continued to attack Savage’s knee after the match until Warrior made the save and carried the champion to the back\n\nEasily in my top 5 favorite matches of all time. Easily. A lot of net fans dish out high praise for the Warrior-Savage Mania VII match, but it’s sequel is even better and even more epic. Savage simply brought out the best in the Warrior and never did he look better to me. The crowd is JACKED for this match. The entire stadium is standing and going nuts for both wrestlers before they even lock up! Talk about guys being over! The original direction post Mania was a lot different, as they were planning a Warrior-Sid showdown and Macho-Flair rematch, both of which were upended along with all the other original booking plans. It all ended up working out for the best, as we get two of the greatest WWF matches of the 90s instead. The whole first half of the match is just epic, Savage and Warrior going move for move. Despite both being faces, there already was so much natural hatred left over between Savage and Warrior that you could just feel the intensity between them. Savage wrestled a far more aggressive style against the Warrior than what he was normally doing throughout 92. I’d wager to say that this ends up being Savage’s last true epic, as nothing he did after comes close to this level. Same with the Warrior. He never had anything close to this ever again, which makes this match feel even more epic to me now. Warrior really pours it on as the match progresses and the crowd seems to be cheering both wrestlers equally. Every single punch and clothesline gets a massive reaction from the fans. You shouldn’t need endless finishers and kick outs, but this was a different era and a different style. Perfect and Flair show up later in the match, with McMahon grilling Heenan on who’s corner they’re really in. They attack both wrestlers at various points, leading to much speculation about who paid them off. Critics of this match say that Perfect and Flair detract from the quality, but I disagree. This added a lot of mystery and intrigue, and lead to a huge post SummerSlam angle (which sadly was ruined by the Warrior’s firing). The finish was crazy as Savage decides to double axehandle Flair on the floor, but Flair swats a chair into his knee, leading to the Warrior’s countout victory. Kind of a cheap ending, but again, how else would you finish this? I’ll forever wonder if the rumors were true about the Warrior supposedly turning heel and being revealed as the one who paid off Perfect and Flair? I could actually see it, based on the ending of this match. Warrior chases away Perfect and Flair and helps up Savage, even presenting him with the title. Phenomenal visual of Warrior holding up a hurting Savage, and the MASSIVE ovation from the London fans. Brilliant.\n\nTremendous post match interview with a crazed Perfect and Flair. Where they claim that this was all part of their plan and on and on. This leads to Flair beating Savage for the title a week later, with the help of newcomer Razor Ramon. So awesome.\n\n9) Tatanka pinned the Berzerker (w/ Mr. Fuji) at 5:03 with the Samoan Drop\n\nHere’s the third un-aired match from the show. WWF had a wacky habit in the early 90s of advertising matches for PPVs and dropping them at the last minute. I had figured that this was the case, much like Bulldog-Berzerker from Mania. Turns out it did actually happen, which blew my 12 year-old mind. Tatanka was massively over in London and the crowd was still hot despite the amazing match that preceded this. Despite its 5 minute run time, this match was all action. Berzerker battled Tatanka to the floor early and slammed him on the concrete. Tatanka would return the favor later in the match, leading to the Samoan drop finish. Quick and fun, and a good showcase for Tatanka. This might have been it for Fuji managing the Berzerker, as he’d be with Yoko just weeks later. There’s also another story out there about how the Berzerker joined Hawk and the Hell’s Angels, which is why he disappears from TV over the next month and returns as a jobber to the stars, now in Vince’s bad books.\n\n10) The Undertaker (w/ Paul Bearer) defeated Kamala (w/ Harvey Wippleman & Kimchee) via disqualification at 3:39 when Kimchee interfered as Kamala was set up for the tombstone; after the match, Kamala attacked Taker in the corner, hit a splash, hit a splash off the middle turnbuckle, and then a splash off the top; moments later, Taker sat up and stalked Kamala and his handlers all the way backstage\n\nMore wacky SummerSlam booking as the Undertaker was embroiled in a feud with the Berzerker that was never really paid off. That seemed like the natural match for SummerSlam, but instead they booked Kamala in his place. As a HUGE Kamala mark, I was so excited for this match and still love it to this day. Like I said, I love the variety in wrestling, and there’s room for wacky characters like Kamala. The real attraction in this match is the Undertaker riding on the back of the hearse to the ring. Talk about epic! All these touches are just what made me love this event so much. Kamala plays his role perfectly in this match, trying his best to hurt the Undertaker, and being scared of his no-selling. It’s quickie match that sees Kimchee jump in for the cheap DQ, but it doesn’t matter, as it’s all about the post match angle. Kamala beats down the Undertaker and delivers three splashes, including the final one off the top rope. But the Undertaker sits up!!! The visual of Kamala’s frightened face is just awesome! Undertaker stalks Kamala slowly down the aisle leading to a couple months of great storylines and the debut of the coffin match at Series.\n\nIn a big surprise, Rowdy Roddy Piper returns to play Scotland the Brave on bagpipes before the main event. As a kid, I didn’t realize that Piper was done with wrestling at the time. His last WWF match was at Mania VIII before returning for that insipid Lawler feud and match at King of the Ring 94. Piper wasn’t even on TV after Mania, instead doing a few un-televised Piper’s Pits.\n\nBefore the main event, we get amazing interviews with Bret and the Bulldog, and a hilariously terrible Diana Hart-Smith interview. She can barely speak English it seems and can’t answer even the most basic Sean Mooney questions. She would get a lot better when she returned with a heel Bulldog in 95.\n\n11) Davey Boy Smith pinned WWF IC Champion Bret Hart to win the title by blocking a sunset flip attempt at 25:11; prior to the bout, Smith was escorted to the ring by Lennox Lewis; after the match, Hart initially refused to shake Smith’s hand before the two eventually hugged; moments later, Diana Hart Smith celebrated in the ring with Hart and Smith as the show went off the air\n\nWhat can I say that hasn’t been said about this match already? Another easy top 5 favorite. Simply one of the greatest matches in WWF history. Bret and the Bulldog are INSANELY over with the fans. It’s hard to believe this is in an outdoor stadium, as the cheering is unbelievably loud for this match. So awesome. This is a back and forth masterpiece, and I love how, despite being between two faces and family members, Bret and the Bulldog pull out all the stops and wrestle an aggressive, hard-hitting electric style. This is a star making performance from Bret and it’s no wonder he was chosen to wear the heavyweight gold less than two months later. What an unbelievable match and an unbelievable moment in WWF history. I could watch this match every day and never get tired of it.\n\n26 years later and SummerSlam more than holds up. Forget the IWC, forget star ratings, forget workrate – this is one of the greatest PPVs hands down, based on spectacle, classic wrestling, characters, and the crowd. It will forever remain my all-time favorite!\n\nWWF SummerSlam Spectacular 1992\n\nNashville, TN\n\nMunicipal Auditorium\n\nAugust 23, 1992\n\n(taped on August 11, 1992)\n\nThis is one of the first shows I ever downloaded, over ten years ago lol! 1992 will forever remain the biggest memory wrestling year for me, so this was a must-watch as soon as I got it. So much fun to revisit it once again.\n\nAs with all these specials, it’s a big hype job for the upcoming PPV. I keep pointing this out, but wow, every single pay-per-view felt like the hugest deal. The location was hyped so heavily, every match was treated with importance, and it was presented as a can’t-miss event. Tremendous!!\n\nVince McMahon and Bobby the Brain Heenan are the commentators for the show. Heenan is dressed up as Sherlock Holmes, not only in tribute to going to London, but also to get to the bottom of the mystery of who’s corner will Mr. Perfect be in at SummerSlam. The feud between Savage and the Warrior was extremely well built. They had a natural hatred, stemming from the Warrior retiring Savage at Mania VII and a mutual distrust among each other. They were both so hugely over in 92 that it came together so easily. The added twist with Perfect and Flair’s involvement was tremendous.\n\nOne of the coolest things to debut in fall 1992 was the video wall! This is one of its first appearances. I remember seeing it for the first time on Superstars and was immediately fascinated! The WWF had never had anything so elaborate for an entrance before. It still fills me with joy seeing it, as it was such a big development that was the predecessor for the big sets and entrances that were to come.\n\n1) Ric Flair (w/ Mr. Perfect) defeated El Matador via submission with the figure-4 at around 16:30\n\nHoly shit, a five-star workrate classic kicked off the show! Why not just have this match at SummerSlam? I’ve read that this is considered one of the best WWF matches of 92 and I agree; it’s a true hidden gem. Flair and Matador had a classic at the Royal Albert Hall show the year before, but really ramp things up here. Matador was quite far down the card by this point, but the crowd was still so hot for him. A couple big wins and he could have been back up the ranks in no time. Him and Flair wrestle back and forth with tons of near falls and false finishes. One of the big story elements was the involvement of Mr. Perfect. This match was a great showcase for what Perfect can bring on the outside, as he cheats and distracts Matador throughout. Matador pushes Flair to the limit, but thanks to the interference of Perfect, gains the advantage and wins with the figure four. Excellent wrestling match!\n\nBetween matches, Mean Gene is in the event centre, running down all the matches for SummerSlam and showing pre-taped promos. Man oh man, what a tremendous event!\n\n2) Tatanka pinned Kato (w/ Mr. Fuji) with the Samoan Drop at 8:40\n\nHAHAHA! Holy shit, Kato was still employed?! And he gets an entrance with MUSIC!! Badass!! Mr. Fuji was still his manager too! Man, Fuji’s stable was in sad shape – the Berzerker and Kato. Yeesh! Fuji was so stale by 92 and was a non-factor all year. He disappears for a bit after SummerSlam, then returns with a fresh new look and a new protege – Yokozuna. It was a welcome change, and a great refresh of a classic character, elevating him into the spotlight once again. Kato gets in a surprising amount of offense, softening up Tatanka for the Berzerker, a match that was cut from the F’N PPV! Tatanka wins and Kato is gone by fall.\n\n3) Nailz defeated Ken Wayne via submission with a choke hold at 3:48\n\nA Nailz jobber match! Nailz was being presented as a dangerous threat to society, but still no explanation as to how he ended up signed as a wrestler in the WWF LOL! I’ll forever overlook all of these things. Nailz destroys Wayne, and you gotta give him props for all the cool character stuff he does. Whatta memory!\n\n4) The Nasty Boys (w/ Jimmy Hart) defeated WWF World Champion Randy Savage & the Ultimate Warrior via count-out at around the 12-minute mark following interference from Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect and after Savage was hit in the head with Hart’s megaphone\n\nFirst off, what the fuck was the Ultimate Warrior wearing for this match?! It was a nude colored body suit, with a black Warrior symbol over the ass and crotch. I’ll never forget when I first saw clips of this match on Superstars, I truly thought the Warrior was wrestling nearly naked. On the old TV it sure looked like he had next to nothing on LOL! This match is tremendous, as Warrior and Savage are reluctant partners. The first part of the match is all one-upping each other and showing off their moves. They also argue and point fingers back and forth. The Nasty Boys get control of the Warrior first, then Savage soon after, nailing him with the helmet. Mr. Perfect shows up at ringside and causes all kinds of chaos for the faces. The Warrior abandons Savage and brawls with Perfect, chasing him and Flair down the aisle. The Nasties beat on Savage and even clobber him with a chair, leading to them winning by countout! Wow! For a team that’s been jobbing all year, this was a big win for the Nasty Boys. Savage gets up and fights off the Nasty Boys, then storms to the back to track down the Warrior. I loved the booking here and how both the Warrior and Savage were presented. Warrior definitely comes across as more heelish, leading me believe more in the theory that the Warrior was supposed to go heel at SummerSlam, but refused.\n\nMean Gene is with the Warrior, who is convinced that Savage sold out to Perfect and setup the attack during the match. Warrior presents a strong case here, but definitely does sound more like a heel.\n\n5) Rick Martel defeated Joey Maggs via submission with the Boston Crab at 2:43; during the match, Sensational Sherri came ringside in a flowing pink dress to watch Martel; when Martel noticed her at ringside, he winked at her – with her doing the same to him moments later\n\nAs a youngster, I was thoroughly confused and disgusted by this storyline. I still believed that Sherri was Rick Martel’s for real sister! I couldn’t understand why Sherri was so attracted to her brother hahahaha. I realize it had been years since she was referred to as Sherri Martel, but all the Apter mags I was reading still featured her last name. The Michaels-Martel feud was hastily thrown together as a result of this show moving to London and Michaels losing out of the IC match. It was a fun and simple storyline, which never went anywhere post Slam. The booking of the card is quite weird, as logical matches like Undertaker vs Berzerker and Tatanka vs Martel never happened.\n\nAn AWESOME interview with Macho Man follows. Savage is just phenomenal during this run, beginning in late 1991. He’s convinced the Warrior has paid off Perfect and Flair and points out how the Warrior staged the brawl with Perfect during the tag match. Savage is so much more convincing than the Warrior, and his paranoia as the champ is sky high. This storyline was so well done and it sucks that the Warrior was fired in 92 and we never got that planned heel turn or future title run.\n\n6) Kamala (w/ Harvey Wippleman & Kimchee) pinned Burt Stiles with a splash at 2:31\n\nI sure do love Kamala matches! He was still being presented as a threat here, but also as a simpleton, as Kamala suddenly doesn’t know how to pin his opponent. Nice foreshadowing to SummerSlam, as Kamala threatens to go for a top rope splash, but Kimchee and Wippleman talk him down.\n\n7) Ted Dibiase & IRS (w/ Jimmy Hart) defeated the Bushwhackers at 5:50 when IRS pinned Butch with a knee to the back as Butch grabbed at an interfering Hart\n\nThe former tag champs are itching to get their titles back from the Disasters. Easy win for them over the Bushwhackers who really have dropped to the absolute bottom of the tag division.\n\n8) WWF IC Champion Bret Hart defeated Skinner via submission with the Sharpshooter at 6:16\n\nMan, Bret sure had a lot of matches against Skinner! None were as good as their clash at This Tuesday in Texas. This is one of Bret’s last IC title defenses. Crazy to think he’d soon be the world champ. Decent back and forth action, but Bret really had no problem dispatching Skinner, who’s stock also plummeted greatly by the end of 1992.\n\nWhat a fun and classic show! This really has me hyped for watching SummerSlam 92 again! After I’m done with my quick detour into the 80s, I’ll be watching one of my all-time favorites once again!\n\nUK Rampage 92\n\nSheffield, England\n\nArena\n\nApril 19, 1992\n\nA few weeks back I wrote a report on the special televised card from Munich, Germany on this tour. This is the companion to that event, and the last show of what was an extremely successful spring tour for the WWF. As a result of their booming popularity in Europe, and the UK specifically, the WWF soon made the call to move SummerSlam to Wembley for one of the biggest (and greatest) events of the 90s.\n\nDespite a dwindling audience in the US, the WWF was doing monster business overseas. Much like Munich, this was another sold out show in front of a crowd that was scorching hot for absolutely everything. The atmosphere is electric in Sheffield, and it’s no wonder that they changed plans for SummerSlam so quickly. Interestingly during this show, there was a commercial for a special UK contest for a family trip to see SummerSlam in Washington, DC, the originally planned location for the event. LOL to the poor fools that won.\n\nGorilla Monsoon and Bobby the Brain Heenan were flown to Sheffield for this event, adding to the PPV-like feeling. This was one of the first events I ever downloaded (geez, I started downloading events over 10 years ago, now even that’s become a memory!) and watched it immediately then, super stoked to see an event I had been so curious about since 92. Like the other European special events, various matches from this were scattered across other Coliseum Vids, but to be able to see it in full was something special. I enjoyed it just as much now as I did back then, as my fondness for all things early 90s WWF seems to only grow stronger.\n\n1) Tatanka pinned Skinner at 11:53 with a tomahawk chop off the top and the Samoan Drop\n\nSurprisingly hot opener to kick things off. Despite still being a relative newcomer, Tatanka was massively over. He was still wearing those original cool, white long tights at this point, not changing his look until summer. Skinner was the perfect mid-card bad guy; always antagonizing the fans and grinding down the good guys. Lots of energy from Tatanka, feeding off the fans and battling back against Skinner. Monsoon and Heenan were in top form too, with Heenan’s off the cuff remarks making me burst out laughing time and time again. I’ve mentioned this before, but there was such an art to the presentation back in the day. Even though Skinner was a ridiculous gimmick, Monsoon put him over as a dangerous individual who could really hurt his opponent. Tatanka puts Skinner away, bringing the fans to their feet. Great way to start things off.\n\n2) The Legion of Doom defeated Col. Mustafa & Dino Bravo at 4:29 when Road Warrior Hawk pinned Mustafa with the clothesline off the top after Road Warrior Animal avoided a clothesline from Mustafa\n\nHAHAHA! What the shit is this match!? The team of Mustafa and the brown hair/red tights Bravo has to be seen to be believed. It’s downright bizarre to see Hawk, Animal, Mustafa, and Bravo in the same ring together! LOD demolish them as expected and we get a lot of zany moments, like Hawk brawling with Bravo on the floor and Mustafa getting tossed around the ring. LOD finishes this hilarity off relatively quick and the building comes unglued again, as though the LOD just won the tag team titles.\n\nLots of interviews between all the matches, further adding to the PPV feeling of this card. We get Harvey Wippleman and SID JUSTICE up next! Man it’s weird seeing Sid post Wrestlemania VIII. He’d be out of the company in a couple weeks, at the end of April. His disappearance was one of the weirdest things to me as a kid. I couldn’t understand why both Hogan and Sid were gone after Mania. I remember them announcing the Sid-Warrior house show matches, which just blew my mind. A few of them actually happened before Sid walked out on the company. Sid is really fired up about his upcoming match with the Undertaker, referring to himself as Psycho Sid even. It’s weird how they were feuding in late 91, with their allegiances reversed. What a wacky era!\n\n3) Sid Justice (w/ Harvey Wippleman) defeated the Undertaker (w/ Paul Bearer) via count-out at 5:15 after throwing Taker into the ringpost as the two fought outside the ring\n\nWhat in the fuck happened here?! This match was a mess through and through, and Sid looked as though he was giving less of a fuck out there. It ends out of nowhere when Sid tosses Taker into a post and randomly wins by countout in five minutes?! This made no fucking sense! Justice further assaults Undertaker after the match until he sits up and fights back, tombstoning Sid for the moral victory. Welp, see ya later Sid.\n\n4) WWF World Champion Randy Savage pinned Shawn Michaels (w/ Sensational Sherri) at 16:58 with a reverse crossbody off the top; Elizabeth escorted Savage to the ring before the match but he sent her backstage mid-way through the contest after Sherri tried to attack her on the floor; Elizabeth returned late in the match to counter Sherri’s interference\n\nI just watched and reviewed this match a couple months ago on the Macho Madness collection, so I skipped it over on this viewing. It was a great match and amazing to see the final appearance of Elizabeth in the WWF. Throughout this event, Monsoon was hyping up Elizabeth being here, which goes to show how much star power she was still riding a year after her return.\n\n5) The Mountie (w/ Jimmy Hart) pinned Virgil at 8:57 after using his shock stick while Hart distracted the referee\n\nThis is probably the match that sold the WWF on moving SummerSlam from Washington to the UK. It’s a nothing match between two goobers, yet the fans are red hot for Virgil and going nuts for his terrible offense. Before the match we get a borderline racist promo from the Mountie, where he says Virgil should go back to shining shoes and such, and in a neat touch of continuity, midway through the match, Virgil rips off the Mountie’s shirt and slaps him around with it, ordering him to shine his shoes. The crowd is solidly pro Virgil, despite that being his one shining moment in the match. While watching this, I realized that Virgil made it to every PPV from Rumble 91 through Rumble 93. Pretty good run for him! Despite starting the year still semi hot in the mid-card, Virgil was definitely headed for jobberville by this point, still rocking the lame nose guard, and eventually eats the pin after the Mountie cheats and uses the shock stick. And man, was the Mountie ever an entertaining heel heat magnet.\n\n6) WWF IC Champion Bret Hart pinned Rick Martel with a small package at 13:02\n\nIt feels like Bret and Martel wrestled a hundred times in 92, and I used to be so bored with Martel’s matches as a kid. Now I really look forward to them, as he was a tremendous, underrated heel that had awesome chemistry with guys like Bret. This one seesaws back and forth, with a lot of action and a brisk pace. It’s too bad Martel never got even a short run with the IC title in 92. He would’ve made for a great champ late in the year. Great seesaw action, and much like Munich, a real surprise finish as Bret, in the midst of being taken apart by Martel, scores the win with a small package. That truly came out of nowhere and the crowd goes apeshit for it. Man this is a fun card.\n\n7) Hacksaw Jim Duggan defeated Repo Man via disqualification at 7:14 when Repo hit Duggan with a steel hook\n\nHahaha, YES! It’s the Repo Man! Repo gets a surprisingly decent reaction in Sheffield, including some goof holding up a ‘Repo Rules’ sign. One of the funnest cartoon characters of the early 90s. And again, the beauty is in the presentation, as Monsoon puts him over as a sick individual, perfectly capable of hurting and maiming his opponent. Duggan is insanely over as usual, and we get a daffy back and forth brawl. Repo is hilarious, sneaking around the around and avoiding Duggan before getting in his cheap shots. Repo manages to get the top turnbuckle pad off and it comes into play several times. Big credit to Barry Darsow for really slimming down and changing his physical appearance from Smash to Repo. He was in great shape here in early 92. The match is humming along when Repo suddenly decides to cold cock Duggan with the steel hook and the ref catches him for the easy DQ.\n\nIn a nice touch, Gorilla Monsoon puts over the British Bulldog all night and his victory at the Battle Royal in Albert Hall last fall. Nice piece of continuity to further to put over the Bulldog in the UK. Heenan’s hilarious all night, mocking the Royal Samavar trophy and before this match, holding up an old coffee pot claiming it’s the trophy. Monsoon and Heenan were fucking gold.\n\n8) Davey Boy Smith pinned WWF Tag Team Champion IRS (w/ Jimmy Hart) with the running powerslam at 12:48 after knocking Hart off the apron\n\nLook at what the main event is of a sold out show in mid 1992 – the British Bulldog against fucking IRS. Yeah, no wonder SummerSlam went to Wembly. Of all the wrestlers on the roster, they put IRS in the main event slot. Why not bring in Flair or put Sid against the Bulldog, but nope, it’s IRS! And you know what, this crowd doesn’t care!! They’re losing their fucking shit over the Bulldog wrestling IRS! It’s a decent enough mid-card match, but the crowd is reacting as though it’s the main event of Mania. We get all the usual tactics and antics of IRS and geez, even I was jumping out of my seat when the Bulldog caught him over his shoulder and drove him into the mat with the running powerslam. The fans were losing their minds over this!! This card was a lot of fun to watch and is so interest to view in hindsight, knowing what an influence it had on the WWF’s plans for the year. Fantastic show!\n\nWWF European Rampage Tour 92\n\nMunich, Germany\n\nOlympiahalle\n\nApril 14, 1992\n\nThis was a special German live broadcast of the European Rampage Tour show in Munich, Germany. Despite business being down in the US, the WWF was booming overseas and these European tours were said to be extremely lucrative endeavours. As had become tradition, the WWF loaded up a crew of wrestlers and headed overseas following Wrestlemania VIII, putting on shows in front of packed, rabid audiences, hungry for WWF action.\n\nI absolutely love how these special events have become available in the internet age. Once upon a time I imagine I would had to have tracked down a tape trader to score an event like this, but now I’ve been able to collect these types of cards thanks to the global sharing made available by the internet. This card was a blast to watch, and something I no doubt would have shit my pants over as a kid, especially during the height of my fandom in 92.\n\nThe show opens with a super cool montage of various WWF stars in action, mixed with clips of the audience filing into the Olympiahalle. Damn that arena looks sweet! It has these cool big windows so there’s daylight in the background during the first couple matches. This tremendous intro gives this televised tour card a real big event feel.\n\nIt’s broadcast entirely in German, which added to the overall special feeling of this card. It was an absolute blast listening to these matches being called in German and hearing genuine excitement from the announcers, Carsten Schaefer & Uli Fesseler. Carsten has been around the company forever and I think still is the WWE German commentator. Uli was a total babe and was fun to listen to. Interviews are shown between matches with various wrestlers and Carsten Schaefer, who tries his best to ask questions in English then translates their answers in German. It’s hilarious when he just gives up with guys like the Macho Man.\n\n1) WWF IC Champion Bret Hart pinned Dino Bravo with the backbreaker and elbow drop from the middle turnbuckle at 14:17\n\nHoly shit! The short-lived return of Dino Bravo! Bravo was brought back to fill out the roster for this European tour. Outside of a lone tour card in Montreal later in the year, this is the only time Bravo pops up in the WWF again before being gunned down in early 93. Bravo has brown hair and red trunks, with no music. Bret enters to a massive ovation, one of the biggest of the night, and his legendary status and popularity in Germany is clearly cemented by this time. Bret and Bravo have wrestled a ton of times in the past and this was pretty similar to their previous battles. Bravo is wrestling a bare bones style, with no real flash or gimmickery. Weird and interesting to see. Because there are only a few matches, everything gets a lot of time. With the German fans losing their shit, Bret starts mounting his comeback. He starts landing all the moves that usually lead up to the sharpshooter, when he suddenly pins Bravo after hitting the elbow off the second rope! WTF! I’ve NEVER seen Bret win with the second rope elbow! Did they just have enough at that point?! Usually the sharpshooter is right around the corner, but not this time. So weird!\n\n2) Hacksaw Jim Duggan pinned Col. Mustafa with the running clothesline at around the 8-minute mark\n\nFuck does Col Mustafa ever suck. He surprisingly hangs around the WWF until the end of May. I thought he was long gone by this point. Say what you will about the truly horrendous quality of this match, it sure was a blast watching Hacksaw Jim Duggan. Up and coming young wrestlers should watch every Hacksaw match they can find, as it’s a masterclass in entertaining the audience by doing as little as possible in the ring. Duggan has the sold-out Olympiahalle chanting USA and Hoooooooooo! It’s amazing how worldwide Duggan’s popularity was. Here’s a guy who never once wrestled in a five star match, yet had fans the world over losing their shit for him. He’s got fans in Germany and Japan chanting USA for fucks sake! Unreal! This match was the drizzling shits, yet the crowd is going absolutely bananas for Duggan. Wrestling has become a lost art in so many ways.\n\n3) Repo Man pinned Sgt. Slaughter at 14:09 after hitting him in the face with his steel hook\n\nFirst of all – holy shit!! Repo Man pinned the former heavyweight champion!! Wow had Slaughter’s stock fallen by 92. Secondly, holy shit!! Repo Man won a match! I marked out huge because Repo didn’t exactly score many wins over anyone other than jobbers and Virgil. And this was a long match, going nearly 15 minutes between two guys on opposing sides at Wrestlemania VIII. I’m still such a huge Repo Man mark and just loved seeing this random singles match. It’s nuts how Slaughter never seemed to lose a damn match by anything other than DQ for all of 91 and to see him get pinned by Repo Man was so surprising. Repo even survives the cobra clutch, being locked in the hold for seemingly ever. And so what that he had to cheat to win. I wouldn’t expect anything less from the Repo Man!\n\n4) Davey Boy Smith & the Legion of Doom defeated the Mountie & the Nasty Boys (w/ Jimmy Hart) when Smith pinned Brian Knobbs with the running powerslam at 12:24 after the LOD ran Knobbs into Smith\n\nThis match is also featured on the World Tour 92 VHS tape that I’ve had in my collection for years, albeit without the German commentary. LOD are back on the road after Hawk’s suspension back in February, but do not have the recently debuted Paul Ellering in their corner for this card. The match itself is tons of fun. LOD and the Bulldog are massively over in Munich, and the Mountie and the Nasties are hilarious as always. The three of them would team up a lot over the course of 92. What’s also cool about this match is that we get to see the Bulldog locking up with the Mountie, two opponents who were supposed to meet for the IC title at Survivor Series 92 before the Bulldog was canned and the Mountie quit. I found a cool face to face interview from Prime Time on YouTube with the Mountie and Bulldog actually hyping that match, weeks before Series. Too bad it never happened. All hell breaks loose at the end of this one and the LOD whip Knobbs over to the Bulldog who drives him into the mat with the running powerslam to put them away. The crowd loses their shit for the good guys.\n\nI laughed my ass off as we got a special WBF in Germany segment featuring Vince McMahon, some bodybuilder chick named Cameo, and Lex Luger! The timing for the WBF couldn’t have been worse as this was the start of the whole steroid crackdown lol. Vince dares Luger to do some bungee jumping (WTF!) and then Vince does it! WTF part 2! Wackiness!\n\n5) Papa Shango pinned El Matador after reversing a crossbody off the top at 9:49\n\nWOAH!! Not only do we get a Repo Man victory, but also a rare Papa F’N Shango victory on this event!!! My 11/12 year old mind would have EXPLODED had I seen this back in the day! Much like Repo, Shango had very few wins over name guys. He beat his share of jobbers, yet routinely lost to the likes of the Warrior, Savage, Undertaker, Bret Hart, and even Bob Backlund. This was a true putting a guy to the test match, as Shango controlled most of it, but Matador kept fighting back. Shango wins with a roll through of a crossbody, which was unexpected. I don’t know why for such a scary monster character, they didn’t have him just annihilate his opponents. And why no feud with the Undertaker? That seemed like an insanely obvious pairing, and they wrestled against each other on a ton of house shows and even on a few other Coliseum Vids. Still, super cool to see a Papa Shango win over a classic jabroni like El Matador!\n\n6) WWF World Champion Randy Savage pinned Shawn Michaels (w/ Sensational Sherri) with the flying elbow drop at 14:26; after the bout, Michaels and Sherri attacked the champion’s injured knee with a chair until referees and officials swarmed the ring; moments later, the injured Savage was carried backstage by officials; as a result of the attack, Savage was unable to compete in the battle royal\n\nI skipped over this match as I had just watched it a couple weeks ago on the Macho Man blu-ray that I have yet to review. It was also featured on the World Tour 92 tape, so I’ve seen it a lot over the years. Shawn Michaels sure was an interesting choice as a challenger for Savage right after Mania. I’ve read that Macho was originally supposed to be wrestling Jake still, and defending the title, but Jake left the company right after Mania VIII. This is a great match, but I’ll save that for the Savage blu-ray write up.\n\n7) Davey Boy Smith won a 16-man battle royal by last eliminating the Mountie at 17:07\n\nNormally I’m a huge fan of battle royals, but this was lackluster at best. The wrestlers were looking tired as hell and were putting minimal effort into this one. The coolest part is that everyone had their own entrance and music. I think Savage was supposed to be in this too, but was still selling the knee from the prior match. The LOD toss an exhausted Michaels in seconds, dumping him onto Sherri no less. I laughed as that true jabroni Dino Bravo gets dumped out soon after. That useless tub of crap Col Mustafa hangs around, but contributes zero to it. Why in the fuck was he even still employed?! Repo Man does an awesome showing, which made me happy. The British Bulldog wins in the most predictable fashion, pretty much the same way he won the battle royal in Royal Albert Hall. Of course the Bulldog had to win this battle royal – the event was in Europe! A meh battle royal overall.\n\nThere’s tons of time filler after the card is over. First Carsten Schaefer interviews the British Bulldog on the podium, when suddenly the Macho Man comes out to congratulate him! Wow, I don’t recall Savage and Bulldog having any other interaction! Savage puts him over and the Bulldog blathers on about winning the battle royal, and winning at Royal Albert Hall, and blah blah. I was in shock at seeing Savage with his arm around the Bulldog. Weird!\n\nFinally we get two news style reports with this German reporter. First she interviews the Macho Man about fitness and nutrition (WTF), then she interviews Bret the Hitman Hart. Hart’s interview is awkwardly hilarious, as she asks him about his body, what he does to stay in shape, then starts talking about all his female fans in Germany. Hart tries to keep kayfabe, talking about the Intercontinental title and being a wrestler, but she keeps pressing, asking him what his girlfriend thinks of his female fans, then asking him if he has any special messages for all the girls of Germany. Fuck this was trainwreck funny.\n\nDamn this was a unique find! I can’t stress enough how much I love that I’m seeing this kind of shit for the very first time now. 92 and 93 will forever go down as the most memory and nostalgic eras for me and this stuff brings me so much enjoyment. Up next I’m watching the UK Rampage event, from the same tour, taking place a few days after this Germany event.\n\nWWF March to WrestleMania VIII: A Tribute to Hulk Hogan\n\nBiloxi, MS\n\nCoast Coliseum\n\n3/29/92 (taped on 3/10/92)\n\nContinuing on through the early 90s, I was up to a PPV lead up special I’ve been dying to see, for one of my favorite events of all time. The whole show was built up as a tribute to Hulk Hogan, and somewhat shockingly, they dig into the archives to show past clips of the Hulkster and some of his biggest moments. I was surprised to see clips of Hogan beating the Sheik for example, since the Sheik was still in as Colonel Mustafa and they were largely pretending he wasn’t the Sheik. Man, side tangent, it sure is weird now that I think about it that Hogan and the Sheik faced off on an actual PPV, Summerslam 91, seven years (and a lifetime in terms of style and production) from that title match in 84.\n\nWe also get tons of amazing highlights for all the big matches of Wrestlemania VIII. We get to see the big angle of the Undertaker surprisingly saving Elizabeth from being destroyed by chair when she walked through the curtain at the end of SNME. We get to see the full build up to Savage-Flair, which was definitely the most adult oriented storyline the WWF had done in the Hulkamania era. Flair was crazy awesome as the rich dick heel, who proclaimed to have had Elizabeth before Savage, even producing those doctored photos. The build for that match is so underrated, considering they had such little time to produce that storyline. 1992 was just fucking awesome. 91 was so nuts and it just continued well into 92 before things settled down again by the fall.\n\nVince McMahon hosts the show and he’s in that super cool looking studio with giant pictures from Hogan’s career all around him. He strongly puts over Hogan and how there’s a strong possibility that this is the last time we’ll be seeing the Hulkster. All of this shit was so cool, and its inconceivable how poorly and lackluster his return in 93 was after this initial epic closing of the book.\n\nThey showed the entirety of the Hulk Hogan – Andre the Giant match from Wrestlemania III. At first I was going to skip it, but it featured new commentary from Gorilla Monsoon and Bobby Heenan (no doubt because Ventura had jumped to WCW at this time). This commentary was HILARIOUS and added a whole new enjoyment to this legendary match. Monsoon eggs on Heenan the whole time, calling him out for giving Andre bad instructions and costing him the title, while Heenan defends himself and buries the Giant, calling him a big dummy who wouldn’t listen. The back and forth banter is all gold. Monsoon gets so many digs in on Heenan and has him backpedalling throughout. I was laughing my ass off!\n\nThey showed the transformation of Sid Justice over the last six months, from his debut at Summerslam to his turn after the Rumble. This was stuff was great, but wow was Justice’s career ever short! It was made shorter by the bicep injury he suffered in fall and he missed a few months, including Series, because of it. Most surprising is that for whatever bizarre reason, they showed a 30 second squash match from MSG of Sid defeating a still heel Hercules. This “match” is infamous because Herc was on his way out and decided not to cooperate with the company. He takes the powerbomb badly, then sits right up after the pin, no selling it. Why in the fuck did they think this was fit for a primetime special? Why not show Sid destroying Virgil instead? Bizarre.\n\n1) Shawn Michaels (w/ Sensational Sherri) defeated WWF IC Champion Rowdy Roddy Piper via disqualification in a non-title match at the 8-minute mark when referee Earl Hebner, who had been knocked down moments earlier, caught Piper trying to hit Michaels with Sherri’s boot\n\nI was so stoked to see this crazy ass match. It’s really interesting to look back and see how strongly they were grooming Michaels for a big run as singles, giving him top matches with true vets like Santana, Piper, and Savage. He was set up to succeed because of it. This match is tons of fun, and it’s wild seeing a Piper IC title defense. This is a fun 8 minute battle with an all out wacky ending, with both Bret and Sherri getting involved. Crazy stuff!\n\nNext we get an interview with Vince McMahon and Elizabeth, from Macho and Liz’s house! This show is nuts!! Elizabeth’s character is really developing at this point, as she’s incensed with WWF Magazine for publishing those Flair photos and tells Vince that Macho is on his way over there with the negatives of the real photos. She talks about the damage that the Flair photos have caused and that she’s scarred for life because of it. This is all so tremendous!! The WWF had never done a storyline like this up till now. It’s disappointing to know that Elizabeth was gone from TV after Mania VIII, aside from her UK tour appearance, as she and Savage were having real life problems that lead to their divorce. I wonder if they had more plans in store for Liz?\n\n2) WWF World Champion Ric Flair (w/ Mr. Perfect) defeated Jim Brunzell via submission with the figure-4 in a non-title match at 3:59\n\nWhat the hell! The WWF Champ in a squash match! That’s weird. Even more weird, Flair and Brunzell give each other a little acknowledgement, as they of course both came up through the AWA together. Brunzell gets in some offense against the champ, but it’s ultimately a squash. Brunzell, like Jim Powers and the Brooklyn Brawler, was always treated as a special jobber, with commentators like Monsoon putting over his ability unlike the usual standing in the ring scrubs.\n\nNext they show the full Wrestlemania VI Hulk Hogan – Ultimate Warrior match. Just like the match earlier, we get all new commentary from Monsoon and Heenan and again, it’s outstanding! Looking back, it sure is interesting that they chose this match, seeing as how the Warrior would be returning in a few days. I tried to listen for any clues in the commentary, but there’s none to be had. Monsoon and Heenan mainly talk about Hogan’s career possibly coming to an end. At the time, I doubt casual fans would think that the Warrior would be returning because of this match being featured. It’s also the most sensible choice, as they couldn’t show Hogan-Savage or Hogan-Slaughter, because both Savage and Slaughter were faces and had far different personalities at this point. Fascinating stuff.\n\n3) Jake Roberts pinned Jim Powers with the DDT at 3:07\n\nA simple squash match for the sinister Jake the Snake. I’ve been reading a lot about the original plans for 92. Apparently a few different possibilities were being floated around. One take suggests that Jake was supposed to face Savage in a brutal career match at Mania, and his loss would lead to a creative team position for the Snake, replacing Pat Patterson who had been let go temporarily because of the sex scandals. Another suggests that Jake was supposed to lose to the Undertaker, but then go on to feud with Bret Hart over the IC title. It turned out Jake and Vince had a falling out, with Jake threatening to no-show Mania, which is one of the Snake’s biggest regrets. In many shoots, Jake laments his decision to leave the WWF as his career floundered in the years ahead.\n\n4) The Natural Disasters defeated Kato & Barry Horowitz at 1:57 when Earthquake pinned Horowitz with the sit-down splash\n\nToo bad it wasn’t the Disasters against the Orient Express. That would have been a cool squash. But Tanaka was long gone by this point. Easy win for the Disasters who were surprisingly over after their hasty face turn weeks earlier. I believe they were turned face as a result of Hawk being suspended in January, and because the Anvil was fired and the New Foundation were done. Only the Bushwhackers and Duggan/Slaughter were left on the tag team face side at that point.\n\nThe show concludes with that classic sitdown interview with Hulk Hogan and Vince McMahon. A portion of this was shown during Mania VIII, and I think they showed this segment in full on Superstars or Challenge too because I remembered almost all of it. Hogan talks about Hulkamania living forever even if this is his last match. He wouldn’t commit to a yes or no if he was done with wrestling. The interview concludes with that classic Vince line “thanks for the memories, thanks for Hulkamania.” Again, this segment is just tremendous and was an epic way for the Hulkster to go out. This was presented like a really huge serious deal. Just awesome. What a cool and crazy special this ended up being.\n\nWWF Saturday Night’s Main Event #30 – 2/8/92\n\nLubbock, TX\n\nMunicipal Coliseum\n\n(taped on January 27, 1992)\n\nAfter being cancelled by NBC in 1991 it looked like Saturday Night’s Main Event was dead and gone. Surprisingly, over half a year later, SNME was brought back on Fox, with a refreshed look, new graphics, and new music. Unfortunately it lasted for all of two episodes – this one here in February and one later in the year in October – before being cancelled and laying dormant for the next 14 years (if you even count those late 00s editions as real SNMEs).\n\nAs I covered in my last couple 91 reports, by this point, I was hooked on absolutely everything the WWF was doing. My mega-fan status was officially in full-swing! Royal Rumble 1992 is simply one of the greatest PPVs of all time. I had seen it at a pal’s birthday party and watched the copy of it a couple more times in the weeks right after. So I was more than hyped when they announced the return of Saturday Night’s Main Event.\n\nSNME had been a childhood staple, something that to this day I have tremendous memories of. Finding out that it was coming back at the peak of my fandom had me beyond excited. They announced the matches ahead of time, and I was so pumped going into it. I seem to remember it airing earlier in the evening, unlike the traditional 10:30 spot, and I definitely was watching it live. It was an unbelievable night of angles and action and definitely did not disappoint! Since that initial viewing, I’ve only seen it again one other time, when I bought the SNME VHS collection, so I was really looking forward to watching it again now.\n\nVince McMahon and Bobby the Brain Heenan are the hosts and commentators for the show. One problem with the new Fox relaunch is that SNME is only an hour instead of an hour and a half, so everything is hugely rushed. The focus of the show is on the unfolding drama going into Wrestlemania VIII. We see clips of the classic Wrestlemania press conference, where Jack Tunney names Hulk Hogan the number one contender, and the main event is set – Hulk Hogan vs Ric Flair for the world heavyweight title. Sid Justice seethes and is enraged at the blatant favoritism (which many fans surprisingly agreed with) shown towards movie star Hulk Hogan. Clips were also shown from the Royal Rumble where Hulk Hogan cheated and dragged Sid over the top after being eliminated. It’s hilarious, because even though you see fans jumping up and down and cheering when Sid eliminates Hulk, we get new dubbed over commentary from Monsoon calling it an injustice with boos and fake chants of ‘Hulk’ added in. All of this build up lead to Sid Justice offering an apology to Hulk Hogan and suggesting they bury the hatchet and square off against common enemies Ric Flair and the Undertaker.\n\nThis whole angle was tremendous, but looking back on it, man does it ever feel rushed. Sid had just debuted at SummerSlam, entered into a feud with Jake the Snake and the Undertaker that was derailed by his bicep injury, then eliminates Hogan in the Royal Rumble. Weeks later he turns on the Hulkster, gets a heel push to the moon, main events Wrestlemania, then leaves the company. This all happened in half a year!\n\n1) WWF IC Champion Rowdy Roddy Piper pinned the Mountie (w/ Jimmy Hart) at around the 3:30 mark after shocking the challenger with his own shock stick; late in the contest, the Mountie poured water on Piper and attempted to shock him but it had no affect; after the match, Piper took off his shirt to reveal a rubber vest underneath that read “Shock Proof”\n\nThe show kicks off with a Rumble rematch, as the Mountie attempts to regain his title from Piper. These two characters were a perfect match, each playing off the other with hilarious antics and tactics. Suspiciously, Piper never takes his t-shirt off, and leaves it tucked into his tights during the match. As you would expect, this was all punch and kick insanity with hijinx galore. Like everything on this show, they speed through this match. The ending of the match is a huge memory, something I loved when seeing this live. The Mountie pours water on Piper and tries to shock him, but to no effect! Piper battles back and zaps the Mountie with his own stick and pins him. After the match Piper pulls off his t-shirt to reveal the “Shock Proof” vest he was wearing underneath. So cheap, but so funny. This was pretty much it for the Mountie as a contender. He wrestled in mainly six and eight man tags before entering into a feud with Sgt. Slaughter in early summer. He was announced as the IC challenger to face the British Bulldog at Survivor Series, but both him and the Bulldog were gone from the company long before the PPV.\n\nWe get more Hulk Hogan-Sid Justice stuff. Man, Hogan sure came across like the heel in this feud. No wonder fans were starting to boo him! Mooney is interviewing Hulk and Sid, and Hogan immediately cuts Sid off and starts ranting and rumbling as usual. Sid looks pissed and walks off, but Hogan doesn’t even notice. Subtle! The Hulkster promises to bring a surprise out to ringside to ensure that Flair and the Undertaker don’t try anything.\n\n2) Hulk Hogan (w/ Brutus Beefcake) & Sid Justice defeated WWF World Champion Ric Flair (w/ Mr. Perfect) & the Undertaker (w/ Paul Bearer) via disqualification at around the 11-minute mark when Flair shoved referee Earl Hebner as he and Taker double teamed Hogan; during the final moments of the match, Justice jumped off the apron and walked backstage as Hogan crawled toward the corner for the tag; after the contest, Beefcake got in the ring and faced off with Flair and Taker, risking his reconstructed face, until Hogan cleared the opposition from the ring and posed with Beefcake\n\nSo the big surprise was revealed to be Brutus Beefcake. It’s interesting, because the Barber had been back all through 91, hosting the Barber Shop segment, but had nothing much to do with Hogan and was never close to the ring. This was promoted as Beefcake’s big return to ringside and Heenan really put over how dangerous it was for Beefcake to be down there. This angle was really cool, as it fueled Sid’s heel turn, as he would threaten to smash Beefcake’s face in and destroyed the Barber Shop set in the coming weeks. The tag match itself is pretty damn awesome. It’s totally surreal to see Ric Flair teaming with the Undertaker, but they had been aiding each other since the Survivor Series, and mutually hated Hulk Hogan. This was it for the Undertaker being a heel too, as he turns face later on. Hogan is the face in peril, and I really liked how Flair picked him apart. The big moment of course comes when Hogan finally crawls to his corner, but Sid Justice jumps off the apron, threatens Beefcake, then walks to the back yelling about Hogan. Everyone could see this heel turn coming, but as a kid, I was hugely surprised. I really wanted Sid and Hogan to be best buddies! Flair takes the cheap DQ soon after and him and the Undertaker pummel Hogan until Beefcake jumps in the ring! Before they could destroy his face, Hogan cleans house and poses with the Barber.\n\n3) Sgt. Slaughter & Jim Duggan defeated the Beverly Brothers (w/ the Genius) when Slaughter pinned Blake at 2:39 after hitting Blake with the Genius’ scroll and Duggan dropping Blake with the running clothesline\n\nLOD had been announced as defending the tag titles against the Beverly Bros, but were nowhere to be found, with no explanation given. I think this is right around the time Hawk was suspended for drugs and they dropped the titles to the Natural Disasters. Instead we get a total squash, a match I forgot was even on this show, as Slaughter and Duggan mow over the Beverly’s in two minutes. This was totally rushed and served no real purpose. I imagine it’s how the LOD match would have went too.\n\nMean Gene is with Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake, talking about what happened with Sid Justice early. Hogan goes on and on about Brutus Beefcake being his true friend to the end, acknowledging how they’ve been best friends since way back in the day, and yammering about Wrestlemania.\n\n4) Macho Man Randy Savage pinned Jake Roberts at 5:25 with the flying elbowsmash after hitting the double axe handle to the floor, causing Roberts to injure his throat on the steel barrier; after the bout, Savage went up for a second elbowsmash, with officials and referees trying to block him, and Savage jumping over them to hit it; moments later, Savage went out to the floor and grabbed the timekeeper’s bell, with the officials blocking him from using it as Roberts escaped backstage; Miss Elizabeth then appeared and celebrated with Savage in the ring as Roberts was shown backstage watching on\n\nThe final match of the show is the one that I really wanted to see the most. It’s the blowoff to the also rushed Savage-Jake feud. I talked at length in my Tuesday in Texas review how the angle was originally suppose to last until Wrestlemania and culminate in a Career Match, with Savage destroying Jake and celebrating with Elizabeth, but plans changed when Elizabeth’s family got involved and Jake was no longer a candidate for a booker job as promised. So instead we have this manic 5 minute SNME match to end the feud. Despite being so short, it’s an intense war, with Savage looking for serious revenge against the Snakeman. It’s all brawling and insanity, with Savage maintaining control through most of it. It unfortunately feels super rushed, but Savage destroys Jake with a double axehandle on the floor, then finishes him off with a particularly great looking big elbow. Savage isn’t done yet and a bunch of officials race into the ring to try to stop him from destroying Jake further. Savage does a really cool big elbow through a sea of officials and crashes on Jake, who the finally escapes from the ring. Elizabeth runs down to celebrate with Savage.\n\nBut wait! The show ends on a cliffhanger, as hiding behind the backstage curtain with a chair is Jake the Snake Roberts, who says this isn’t finished! The following weekend on Superstars they showed the clip of Snake preparing to hit Elizabeth with a chair as she came through the curtain, but was stopped by the Undertaker. This made me feel sick to my stomach as a kid. I could actually imagine Jake hitting Elizabeth with a chair. But thankfully, the Undertaker was there and the WWF answered the call and made him a face. He had been getting big cheers in his feud with Hogan and the time was right to turn him. Savage’s feud with Jake is now history and he moves on the be the new number one contender.\n\nMan, what a trip down memory lane! I loved watching this SNME, loved all the big angles. It’s too bad it was so rushed, because an extra half hour would have given things that extra bit of time to make it even more impactful.\n\nWatching all of this stuff got me thinking about the original planned Wrestlemania VIII card. The original blueprint for the event was amazing, one of the best cards the WWF had ever put together, but plans changed drastically between January and March. A bunch of matches were announced in WWF Magazine and were reported in the sheets at the time. Here’s an idea of how things were originally shaping up:\n\nWWF Championship: Hogan vs. Flair\n\n(arguments continue to this day about whether or not this match was ever actually going to happen, or if Sid had been promised a Wrestlemania match with Hogan before signing with the company in 91)\n\nCareer Match: Savage vs. Jake\n\n(talked about in the sheets, would have made sense, but changed because of the reasons mentioned above)\n\nSid vs. Undertaker\n\n(would have only happened had Hogan-Flair been the main event)\n\nIC Championship: Piper vs. Hart\n\nTag Team Championship Chicago Street Fight: LOD vs. Disasters\n\n(announced in WWF Mag, changed after Hawk’s suspension)\n\nJannetty vs. Michaels\n\n(changed after Jannetty was fired in January)\n\nBulldog vs. Berzerker\n\n(should have happened instead of that boring Lex Luger WBF bullshit)\n\nTatanka vs. Martel\n\nDuggan and Slaughter vs. Money Inc.\n\n(announced in WWF Mag, changed after the LOD fiasco)\n\nNew Foundation vs. Beverly Brothers\n\n(changed after the Anvil was fired in February)\n\nEight Man Tag: Boss Man, Tornado, Virgil, El Matador vs. Mountie, Repo Man, Nasty Boys\n\n(likely would have happened had the other matches been booked. There was also a plan to have the New Foundation in this match instead of Tornado and Matador)\n\nAs you can see, that would have been one hell of a Wrestlemania!\n\nRoyal Rumble 92\n\nAlbany, NY\n\nKnickerbocker Arena\n\nJanuary 19, 1992\n\nTo get warmed up for the Rumble last weekend I decided to watch an old classic, that being Royal Rumble 1992. I’ve watched this PPV maybe more than any other, and it still makes me so happy and excited watching it now! Definitely in my top 5 favorite PPVs of all time. Forget a few of the flaws, as a whole this event is just phenomenal. I decided to write up a fun little review of this show with a few observations.\n\nAfter watching 1991 WCW events over the past few months, I was struck by how huge the crowd was in Albany. Despite the fancy sets and ramp ways of early 90s WCW, the WWF still attracted the big crowds in big arenas – 17,000 in this case. With proper lighting, the arena looks amazing. And what a hot crowd! The crowd reactions from the opening match through the end of the Rumble make everything seem bigger and even more historic.\n\nAnd there are not enough ways to describe just how awesome the commentary between Gorilla Monsoon and Bobby the Brain Heenan is on this card. You can listen to just the audio of the show and it will still seem just as amazing. They were a two man comedy team and were on fire from the opening bell. There was a level of believability in what they were saying that is sadly not found in modern wrestling. You really believe in Heenan’s desperation for Flair to win. And Monsoon constantly reminding him that he’s supposed to be an unbiased broadcast journalist, and refusing to let him leave the booth to check with Flair and Perfect. So many added ingredients just sweeten this event.\n\nOne thing that sucks about the Anthology DVD version of this card is that they replaced the classic Rumble theme with generic stock music. Why? The theme was included on other DVDs in the set. We also lose McMahon’s over-exaggerated voice over at the beginning announcing all of the Rumble participants (“Haaaaaawkuuuuuu” “Nickolaiiiiiiih Volkoffffff” “Reeepo Mannn”), and it’s replaced with a modern Mean Gene voiceover. I had to put in my old VHS copy just to see the legendary beginning. They also replaced the Orient Express’ theme for some reason. Oh well, the picture quality is outstanding.\n\n1) The New Foundation defeated the Orient Express (w/ Mr. Fuji) at 17:17 when Owen pinned Tanaka with the Rocket Launcher\n\nOne thing that always baffled me was why this wasn’t the New Foundation vs Beverly Brothers, the team they were actually feuding with. The whole storyline goes back to the weeks before Series 91 when the Beverlys attacked the Anvil in the aisle after he lost to Ric Flair on Superstars. Anvil showed up late in 91 with a new partner – Owen Hart – for the purpose of going after the Beverlys (something that Monsoon mentions briefly later on in the Beverlys match). Sadly that feud never happened as the Anvil was fired shortly after this card. All that being said, this match was simply outstanding. Non-stop action from bell to bell. The Orient Express were sadly overlooked, especially the superior Kato and Tanaka version, and they put on some of the best matches in the WWF in the early 90s. The pace is frantic from the opening bell with neither team slowing down. The crowd is so hot for the Foundation, and even the Anvil looks great in the ring. Heenan is great on commentary already, constantly saying “He’s nuts!” about the Anvil. One other thing I wondered about – the Orient Express were not really much of a team throughout 91. I wonder why they were put back together briefly?\n\n2) Rowdy Roddy Piper (sub. for Bret Hart) defeated WWF IC Champion the Mountie (w/ Jimmy Hart) to win the title at 5:20 with a sleeper after the champion collided with Hart on the apron\n\nAccording to Bret Hart’s book, the flu storyline was a work, planned months in advance, designed to get him to face Piper at Wrestlemania 8 in order to establish Bret as a legit main eventer. The internet claims otherwise, and says that Bret was in negotiations with WCW and was set to debut on the upcoming Clash of the Champions, coming out with the IC title to stick it to Vince because of what Flair had done with their world title. I think the truth lies somewhere in the middle, as Bret may have been in negotiations, but the storyline with Piper makes so much more sense. And why would Bret jump to WCW when they were gearing up to push him big? Regardless, as a kid I completely believed in the storyline and was legitimately concerned for Bret, and couldn’t believe the Mountie won the IC title! This was announced on the Superstars before the Rumble and I was shocked! It’s a really well done storyline, and Piper was on fire from fall 91 through to Mania 8. Piper really brought it in the ring, even with his limited skills, and he was so incredibly over with the fans. This match is just hilarious! And again, Heenan’s commentary is outstanding, claiming the Mountie had no time to prepare for a nut like Piper, and how Jimmy Hart needs to call his lawyer! LOL! This is a true “neeeyah” brawl and there’s basically no wrestling to speak of. This match exemplifies the performance art that is wrestling. All the Ring of Honor nerds can complain about “workrate” but true workrate is not about doing 800 holds just for the sake of showing off, it’s about telling a story and taking the crowd on a ride. Whether that’s through athletic storytelling, or a match like this that is just pure fun. The Mountie’s selling is outstanding, and Piper just squashed him. It’s so funny and so much fun to watch! The pop from the crowd when Piper wins is ENORMOUS! It’s at a Stone Cold Steve Austin level. Piper winning made for an outstanding storyline.\n\n3) The Beverly Brothers (w/ the Genius) defeated the Bushwhackers (w/ Jamison) when Beau pinned Luke with a double axe handle off the top at 14:56; after the bout, the Bushwhackers cleared their opponents from the ring, knocked the Genius into the ring, and held him so Jamison could kick him in the shin and then kick him out of the ring\n\nOkay, so this match is a true piece of crap, completely garbage. It’s 15 minutes of botched moves, weak punches, and Bushwhacker antics. YET it’s really damn entertaining! I was barely watching what was going on in the ring, instead just listening to Heenan endlessly bury “the human trash can” Jamison. Heenan’s comments about Jamison are some of his best of the entire card. Monsoon plays the straight man perfect, defending Jamison and chides Heenan for bullying him. The Bushwhackers were also crazy over with the fans at first, but the boredom of the match sets in and people aren’t given much to cheer for. The Beverlys were a solid heel team, but would have worked much better with the New Foundation. The Bushwackers should have wrestled the Orient Express or Nasty Boys instead, though either of those two matches wouldn’t have been that much better.\n\n4) The Natural Disasters (w/ Jimmy Hart) defeated WWF Tag Team Champions the Legion of Doom via count-out at 9:22 when Typhoon got back into the ring after both teams began brawling at ringside; after the bout, the Disasters & Hart posed with the title belts until the champions knocked them to the floor after repeatedly hitting them with a steel chair\n\nI’ll argue that this match was the true low point of the entire card. Nobody expected the Whackers-Beverlys match to be any good, but there was no excuse for this slow, plodding mess. Also dumb was the countout finish. LOD dropped the belts to the Disasters on a tour card a short while later. Might as well have just changed the titles on this PPV, which would have further boosted the legendary status of this event. Having all three titles change hands would have been truly epic. Even as a kid I knew this match just plain sucked.\n\n5) Ric Flair won the 30-man Royal Rumble match by last eliminating Sid Justice at 1:02:02; due to pre-match stipulations, Flair won the vacant WWF World Title\n\nWhat can I say that hasn’t been said already? Easily the greatest bell to bell Rumble match of all time. The drama, excitement, and performances in this match are truly legendary. The WWF so expertly booked this masterpiece that it was a guaranteed success. The amount of talent in this Rumble is unparalleled. There were so many potential threats to the title, yet what also made it so entertaining and exciting was that truly anyone entered in this match had a shot at the belt. I laughed so hard when Monsoon talked about guys like the Barbarian and Berzerker being odds on favorites to win this thing, and kept mentioning that even the longshots had the chance to make history. This match was the absolute peak of the mountain for Monsoon and Heenan’s commentary. It’s so legendary and so damn entertaining. The action in the ring never lets up, and they pace the superstars accordingly, really stacking the deck as the match progresses. Often over-looked in this match are the performances of some of the other wrestlers, like Rowdy Roddy Piper who puts in a half hour showing and is non-stop brawling. What a neat storyline it was that Piper could have been the first wrestler in history to win both the IC and world titles in the same night! Mini feuds were interspersed throughout the Rumble too, further adding to the excite"
