        "text": "Native Detroiter Kevin Nash is an actor and equal rights advocate who discovered his love of comedy as the class clown in elementary school and to this day, he can find humor in almost any situation. One day he could not find humor was April 4th, 1968 as that was the day his father died of a heart attack at work at 36 years of age. After spending the day at the funeral home he came home seeking solace in the back bedroom of their 800 sq. foot home watching his portable TV. Suddenly on screen came the report of Martin Luther King's assassination. This brought to mind sitting on his father's knee as they watched MLK's \"I have a dream\" speech. This touched a nerve since the only time he'd ever seen his father cry was the day JFK was shot. Kevin's father, a lifelong democrat instilled core values in his son which later in life lead to Nash's advocacy of human rights, whether it be race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation.\n\nAfter 3 years playing Division 1 college basketball for the Tennessee Volunteers a physical altercation with the head coach Don DeVoe (Kevin pie-faced him after DeVoe grabbed Nash by his jersey), led to a parting of the ways. He was then inspired to join the Army after watching Bill Murray's Stripes and went on to not only have top-secret clearance but also represent the US Armed Forces in the paint. Upon honorable discharge from the Army, Nash played European basketball where a career-ending catastrophic knee injury concluded his basketball career and would hinder his ensuing professional athletic career from day one. His love of being an athlete led him down another path to infamy, namely, professional wrestling. He is one of only eight human beings on the planet to bear the elite distinction of being TWICE inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, after a career garnering 6 world title belts and 21 championships in total. Of course, none of that would have been possible without the brains, talent, and personality that put him on the Mt. Olympus of the sports entertainment universe in the first place.\n\nWhile his athletic route to fame using not only his wit and Detroit coolness but also his considerable 6'10\" size and physical prowess to his advantage is what he may be best known for, Nash's skill as a primarily comedic actor is what gives him the most personal satisfaction. Proudest of his portrayal as Officer Englehart in The Longest Yard (2005), the role was originally scripted for a single line, \"Who drank all the damn Gatorade?!\" but when both Adam Sandler and director Peter Segal saw how thoroughly and artfully Nash embraced the part, Englehart became a much, much bigger part of the film due to Nash's ability to ad-lib scenes. Kevin's take on this masculine prison guard turned estrogen-laden cheerleader, is perhaps his most memorable character to date.\n\nPart Native American and part Neanderthal, Kevin Nash is one-of-a-kind.\n\nBegan his career in Texas. Trained by the legendary Jose Lothario, Shawn Michaels wrestled in Kansas, where he met fellow wrestler, Marty Jannetty. A year later, after sending tapes of his matches to the major wrestling companies at the time, he was contacted by the AWA, who proposed that he team up with Marty Jannetty again. Together, Michaels and Jannetty became known as the Midnight Rockers. The AWA had just received a TV deal with ESPN, which did wonders for his career. The Midnight Rockers had a major feud with \"Playboy\" Buddy Rose and \"Pretty Boy\" Doug Somers. Their matches were considered bloodbaths at the time. Eventually the Midnight Rockers came out the victors and were the AWA World Tag Team Champions. The WWF (now WWE) noticed their efforts and signed them to a deal. Both Michaels and Jannetty were soon fired for a incident in a bar, which Michaels claims was a misunderstanding. The duo went back to the AWA for a brief time. After a while, they contacted the WWF, who gave them a second chance and they returned in late 1988. They were known simply as The Rockers. The duo had a great influence on many of the present teams in wrestling. Their trademark was being tag team specialists and using great double team moves on their opponents.\n\nThey had major feuds with The Brain Busters, The Fabulous Rougeaus, The Hart Foundation, The Orient Express, and Power & Glory. At one point the Rockers won the WWF Tag Team Titles. The match was taped before being shown Jim Neidhart of the Hart Foundation was negotiating his release at the time, then eventually came to an agreement to stay. They were stripped of the Tag Team titles which was returned to the Hart Foundation with the explanation that a turnbuckle collapsed which caused the match to go bad for both teams. Sometime after the Rockers were split apart and Shawn Michaels became a singles wrestler, after turning on his partner Marty Jannetty. In a related story, Michaels actually met with Vince McMahon to discuss his character. He told him he worked hard and would like to be pushed as a singles wrestler. He wanted to know what he had to do to convince Vince McMahon to do so. McMahon told him he just did it by coming to him. Michaels defeated Tito Santana in his first WrestleMania as a singles wrestler. He was managed by Sherri Martel, who supposedly had a crush on him. In a major upset, Michaels defeated The British Bulldog on Saturday Night's Main Event. Michaels thus won the Intercontinental Title from the Bulldog. One night on Raw in May 1993, Michaels wrestled former partner Marty Jannetty with the Intercontinental Title on the line. The match became Pro Wrestling Illustrated's Match of the Year. Jannetty won the bout.\n\nThe following year, Michaels wrestled Razor Ramon (Scott Hall, who is one of his best friends) in a ladder match at WrestleMania X. This match was voted by Pro Wrestling Illustrated as the Match of the Year and became one of wrestling's most innovative matches. In 1995, Michaels was again voted in Match of the Year by wrestling another great friend, Diesel (Kevin Nash) at WrestleMania XI. Michaels won both the 1995 and 1996 Royal Rumbles, and again was in match of the year when in 1996 he wrestled Bret Hart at WrestleMania XII in a one hour Iron Man Match. Michaels was involved in the big Montreal Screwjob on Bret Hart, that Vince McMahon was behind. The match was stopped and awarded to Shawn Michaels because Vince McMahon was worried that Hart would refuse to lose and take the WWF Title belt to WCW Nitro. This severed a friendship between Michaels and Hart. Michaels originally denied knowing about it in advance. Later on he admitted he knew but wouldn't refuse to do what Vince McMahon wanted him to, since Vince McMahon made his career. Michaels innovated another match against the Undertaker, when he wrestled him in a Hell in the Cell match. After WrestleMania XIV, Michaels didn't wrestle for 4 years due to a back injury, but maintained an on air role on occasion. During his time off, Michaels became a father, and also became a Born again Christian. At SummerSlam 2002, Michaels returned to the ring to face his friend Triple H. The two had a great feud, and Michaels who didn't think he could wrestle as well as he used to, dazzled the audience. He wasn't sure if he would be able to continue his normal wrestling schedule due to the nagging injuries, but after that, he went strong for almost 8 full years. He won his last World Championship from Triple H later that year, which he held for a month.\n\nJeffrey Nero Hardy is an American professional wrestler and musician. Born and raised in Cameron, North Carolina, Hardy started his career as a youth performing in the Trampoline Wrestling Federation, which he started alongside his brother Matt Hardy. Hardy is widely considered one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all-time and is regarded as one of the most daring high fliers and risk-takers throughout his career. Together with his brother Matt Hardy, the tag team The Hardy Boyz are now widely regarded as one of the greatest tag teams in professional wrestling history.\n\nHardy has had great success in his singles career, capturing his first of six world championships, the WWE Championship in 2008 and going on to hold WWE's World Heavyweight Championship twice and the TNA World Heavyweight Championship three times. Within WWF/WWE, he has also won the Intercontinental Championship five times, the Hardcore Championship three times and the European, Light Heavyweight, and United States Championships once each. Having won the required championships, he is the 18th Triple Crown Champion and 9th Grand Slam Champion in WWE history (one of five men to complete both WWE Grand Slam formats, and one of two to win all original Grand Slam titles). He has headlined numerous pay-per-view events for WWE and TNA, including TNA's flagship event, Bound for Glory, on two occasions. Readers of Pro Wrestling Illustrated named him \"Most Popular Wrestler of the Year\" on two occasions.\n\nHardy is involved in motocross, music, painting and other artistic endeavors. He is a member of the band PeroxWhy?Gen, with whom he tours and has released three studio albums and four extended plays. In 2003, Hardy, along with his brother Matt, co-wrote an autobiographical book of memoirs titled The Hardy Boyz. Their book was a New York Times Best Seller.\n\nMark LoMonaco (born July 14, 1971) is an American professional wrestler best known for his career in such famous professional wrestling companies a in WWE, as ring name Bubba Ray Dudley, Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), as Buh Buh Ray Dudley and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as Brother Ray and Bully Ray. He became a multiple-time tag team champion with D-Von, winning the ECW Tag Team Titles 8 times. Once he and D-Von jumped to the WWF/E beginning in 1999, they went on to win the WCW Tag Team Titles once during the 2001 \"Invasion\" of wCw/ECW. With D-Von, LoMonaco won the World Tag Team Titles 8 times and the WWE Tag Team Titles 1 time. In 2002 when WWE introduced a RAW and SmackDown roster split, LoMonaco won the WWE Hardcore Time 8 times before the title was deactivated that same year. After his WWE release in 2005, LoMonaco and Devon Hughes (D-Von) wrestled for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling where they won the TNA World Tag Team Titles 2 times.\n\nDuring the early 2010s, LoMonaco as Bully Ray, went solo after splitting from Devon. During his solo run, he embarked in various feuds and won championships including the TNA World Heavyweight Title. As a villain, Bully Ray married TNA General Manager Hulk Hogan's daughter Brooke Hogan before their eventual split. Afterwards in 2012, Bully Ray founded a villainous biker gang called the Aces & Eights, recruiting various members, including his former tag team partner Devon. After the fall of Aces & Eights in 2013, Bully Ray went on to challenge the TNA management, comprised of Dixie Carter and her nephew Ethan Carter III (EC3) and several top TNA competitors including Bobby Roode, Kurt Angle and Eric Young. In 2015, Bully Ray parted ways with TNA and wrestled on the independent promotions until he made a surprise appearance entering the WWE 2015 Royal Rumble. His and D-Von's second stay with the WWE was a short-lived one as they soon were released the following year in 2016. LoMonaco and Devon Hughes have since returned to wrestle on the independent promotions.\n\nOne of the great Hispanic wrestlers, Eddie Guerrero grew up part of the famous wrestling family: The Guerreros. His father Gory Guerrero became a star in the U.S., an icon in Texas and a legend in Mexico. Eddie's brothers, Hector, Amadno and Chavo, Sr. also became wrestlers. Both Hector and Amando gain success, but only in the Indie federations, and not much success as their father or other two brothers had gained in the majors. Eddie's nephew, Chavo Guerro, Jr., son of Chavo, Sr., also became a wrestler (Chavo, Jr. was only three years younger than his uncle). Eddie was also uncle of Enrique Llanes and cousin of Javier Llanes, who are popular wrestlers in Mexico.\n\nEddie had wrestling since the 1989. He really made his name in the now-defunct ECW (Extreme championship Wrestling) by winning the ECW Ecxtreme Championship Wrerstling) TV Title against Dean Simon (aka Dean Malenko). Eddie also made his name later that year in now-defunct WCW (World Championship Wrestling) to win the Cruiserweight Championship by defeating Chris Jericho. Also while in the company, he formed Latino World Order (A playoff to Hulk Hogan's (Hollywood Hogan at the time)stable, New World Order).\n\nThe stable included popular Latino wrestler Rey Mysterio, Jr. (Oscar Gutierrez), La Parka (Adolfo Tapia Ibarra), Psychosis (Dionicio Castellanos) and Juventud Guerrera (Eduardo Annibal Gonzalez Hernandez).\n\nWhen Eddie came to the WWE, he was a heel, and immediately gained fame when he was part of the Radicalz, with Perry Saturn, Dean Malenko and long time friend of fifteen years, Chris Benoit. In recent years, he and and his nephew Chavo, Jr. began a tag team called Los Guerreros and won the WWE Tag Team titles on Smackdown! against Team Angle (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin). After this stint, Eddie Guerrero went on to win the WWE Championhip (His first and only time) at No Way Out in 2004 against Brock Lesnar. He lost the title to John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield four months later at the Great American Bash in a Texas Bull Rope Match.\n\nRecently, wrestling fans and the people of the WWE mourn of the lost of Eddie when he was found by his nephew, Chavo Jr. (who back then known as Kerwin White) on a Sunday morning in November, 2005. The result of his death was most likely been caused by his problems in the past: Drugs and alcohol.\n\nAmerican-born, Canadian-raised professional wrestler, rock singer, actor and author.
