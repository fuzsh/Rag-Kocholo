        "text": "Barry Darsow who was formally Repo Man and Demolition Smash. He talked about his start in the early days from Florida to Mid Atlantic and Mid South. We talk about all his different gimmicks and how he became a russian. Everything you ever wanted to know about him is discussed especially all of his major feuds with Jim Duggan, JYD, R+R X,Nikoali Volkoff, Dr Death Steve Williams, Terry Taylor and Magnum TA. He talked in great detail about the riots that they caused in Mid South and how Bill Watts treated his talent. We also take a pit stop in Florida as we learn all about that promotion with Dusty, Sullivan, Graham,Guerreros and JJ Dillon. You want to hear how he ended up in the NWA well we find out. How did he get paired with Ivan and what were his thoughts on Nikita Koloff. We talk in great details about their feud with the Rock N Roll Xpress and all the greats of the NWA era. You will hear how he almost knocked out Crockett after a Starcade event. In fact it was the same event that Billy Jack Haynes talked about in his shoot. It must have been a rough night for the Crocketts. How did he end up going to the WWF and becoming one of the greatest tag teams of all time Demolition. What were his initial thought on Vince and teaming up with Axe? We talk about all of his infamous tag matches with Hart Foundation, Bulldogs, Powers of Pain, Tully and Arn, Rockers and of course the Road Warriors. Tully Blanchard gets some heat and you will find out why he had a problem with Tully. Find out about the problems they might have had with LOD. We talk in great detail why the team broke up and how he became the Repo Man in the WWF. We dont miss any of his feuds at all in this one. Why did he leave the WWF and go back to WCW and how did Arn Anderson help him land a job as Blacktop Bully. He talked about why he got fired after his truck blood bath match with Dustin and why he was brought back. This is a great interview if you want to hear about all your favorite wrestlers from the 80’s and 90’s.
