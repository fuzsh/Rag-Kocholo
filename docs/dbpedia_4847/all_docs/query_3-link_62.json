        "text": "In an interview with Wrestling Shoot Interviews, former WWE Superstar and Tag Team Champion Barry Darsow, known for his role as Smash in the Demolition tag team, opened up about the complexities of transitioning into the Repo Man character in WWE and the subsequent hurdles he faced during this transformative phase of his career.\n\nFollowing the success of the Demolition tag team, Darsow found himself at a crossroads as the team’s momentum waned in 1991. A call from Vince McMahon marked a potential turning point, as Darsow was given the opportunity to explore a new persona within the company. Suggesting the Repo Man character, Darsow drew from his personal experiences, stating\n\nI used to repo cars and get into situations that were tough to get out of.\n\nThe discussion with McMahon delved into the visual representation of the character, with Darsow proposing a small mask similar to The Riddler’s from Batman, envisioning a blend of seriousness and humour that could lead to a transition to a babyface persona in the future. The Repo Man character, born from Darsow’s creative input, quickly made its way to television, but the challenges of portraying a divisive character soon became apparent.\n\nIt was getting hard to wrestle as the Repo Man because people were kinda liking me but not liking me, and it’s hard to work in those conditions, you either wanna be hated or wanna be loved.\n\nSeeking a change, Darsow approached McMahon with a request to turn babyface, only to be met with resistance. Faced with this impasse, Darsow ultimately made the decision to part ways with WWE.\n\nI told Vince I’m gonna have to put my notice in then as that’s not what we talked about, and I left a few months later. Then he called me back and said I’ve got another gimmick for you. Hawk came up with a gimmick, and Vince wanted me to be Doink the Clown. I told him I don’t know if I could do that, I don’t wanna do this anymore… I wanna have a different gimmick and so I was done and then Doink the Clown came out and that was it.\n\nDespite McMahon’s attempt to retain him with a different gimmick, Darsow remained steadfast in his resolve, eventually departing from WWE and finding a new path in WCW as the Blacktop Bully.\n\nWhy Did WWE Hall Of Famer Eric Bischoff Fire Barry Darsow From WCW?\n\nBarry Darsow has revealed his was fired from WCW by Eric Bischoff in 1995 along with Dustin Rhodes and agent Mike Graham following their King of the Road match at that year’s Uncensored PPV after both wrestlers instructed to blade during the match and bled on TV, which was strictly against WCW’s policy."
