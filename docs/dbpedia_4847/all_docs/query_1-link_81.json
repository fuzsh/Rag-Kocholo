        "text": "WWF WrestleMania IV, Atlantic City, NJ\n\nRequest via Ko-fi, and the last non-tournament match at this show. Strike Force are defending the WWF tag team championship against the fast-rising and intimidating Demolition, the WWF’s Road Warriors knockoff who actually wound up carving out their own place in wrestling history much more than the Powers of Pain, who were more an in-house NWA Road Warriors knockoff before bouncing to the WWF a few months after this show, ever did.\n\nStrike Force were a very good team who didn’t get the time to stick and become truly great, maybe. Tito Santana and Rick Martel were both damn good wrestlers, though, and it was a great use of both at the time. Tito’s best days had come and gone as a singles player, and he and Martel had the look and the style paired together. And really, it might have been Martel’s actual WWF peak, as memorable as his “Model” days were. Though they were really two singles wrestlers put together to make a team, I think of them as sort of a Smoking Gunns of their era. The American Males had some of the same qualities.\n\nThe tactics at the bare bones of it are the same on both sides, you want to execute frequent enough tags and cut the ring off. For Strike Force, they want to, well, strike fast and quick, get in and out, not get grounded. For Demolition, it’s all about the roughhousing, and they’re the ones who get their plan going.\n\nThe thing that made Demolition good and got them past being seen as obvious Road Warriors knockoffs is they were good wrestlers and a good tag team. Barry Darsow was still in his late 20s when they came together, Bill Eadie was a veteran into his early 40s who found new life in his career in the team. He was always a really good tag wrestler and still had plenty enough to get a few years of making some money out of it.\n\nReferee Joey Marella gets knocked by Ventura, ribbing Monsoon, who was not at all averse to criticizing his son normally, either, but here does not. Not a passionate defense, he just takes it in stride and gives his thoughts. This was such a great commentary team.\n\nDemolition dominate Santana for a bit, Ax just hammering him with fists, before Tito comes off the ropes and hits a desperation flying forearm, which looks great, a real physical connection from Tito, who was a pretty damn big guy himself. It’s enough to knock Ax loopy and give Santana the chance to get over for a tag, because Ax has to get one, too. Smash gets the tag and Tito finally sprints over to tag Martel, who takes it to the younger Demolition.\n\nDropkicks for everyone! Axhandles for everyone! The Boston Crab for Smash! Ax comes in but Tito cuts him off. When the referee is distracted by Tito, we expect Fuji to get the cane in, but not right away. What does happen is the cane flies in when Tito goes after Fuji, and Ax clobbers Martel in the back of the head. Marella gets shoved over, but recovers in time to make the count, and we’ve got new tag team champions. More of Vince Jr’s booking brainworms, where almost nobody can just win. People act like this “50/50 booking” or the lack of any name brand Superstars ever looking particularly strong is new, but it’s really not. McMahon has pretty much always booked like this. It’s worse now, because he’s convinced himself he’s got it all down to a science, which he does, it’s just that his science sucks.\n\nSolid match, simple and everyone does their job, the longest match on the show and gets just a bit of time to breathe, unlike most stuff at Mania IV. The belts really needed to be passed to Demolition, who would go on to be cool and good enough that fans started cheering them, necessitating the double turn with Powers of Pain at Survivor Series ’88. Strike Force would get a run of rematches on the road and on the regional TV shows, but never really recovered as a top team, and would break up at the next year’s WrestleMania.\n\nRating: 3/5"
