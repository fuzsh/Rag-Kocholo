        "text": "A former pro wrestler named Eddie Sharkey was bartending at Gramma B's in Northeast Minneapolis in the early 1980s when a few of the young bouncers caught his eye. Just to give you an example of the big men keeping an eye on the place, Richard Rood, even at 6'3\" and 235 lbs, was still outsized by several others including Joe Laurinaitis, Michael Hegstrand, Barry Darsow and John Nord. Laurinaitis, would later recall that Gramma B's, frequented by bikers, wasn't your friendly neighborhood bar.\n\nSharkey, who had wrestled for the AWA in the 60s, decided to start a wrestling promotion in 1982 called Pro Wrestling America. He plucked the bouncers from Gramma B's as talent, opened a school in the basement of a church and trained Rood, Laurinaitis, Hegstrand and Darsow to become pro wrestlers.\n\nview full location details...\n\nLaurinaitis (aka Animal) and Hegstrand (aka Hawk) would go on to form the Road Warriors tag team. Rood would become \"Ravishing\" Rick Rude, John Nord would wrestle as the Berzerker in WWF and Darsow would gain fame as Smash, one half of the tag team Demolition.\n\nA few of the many other wrestlers later trained by Sharkey include Scott Steiner, Sean Waltman and Jerry Lynn.\n\nGramma B's was eventually closed in 1984 for failure to pay taxes. This spot is currently occupied by the tiki bar Psycho Suzi's Motor Lounge.\n\nview full location details..."
