        "text": "Randy Colley, who wrestled under various personas, but most known as ‘Moondog Rex’ died over the weekend at the age of 69.\n\nColley wrestling for a variety of national promotions, including the World Wrestling Federation. He is an interesting trivia note as the man that was an original member of the Demolition tag team with Bill Eadie with Colley the first choice to play Smash, which was quickly taken over by Barry Darsow.\n\nColley and Eadie came up with the idea and pitched it to Vince McMahon. They tested it out in early 1987 on a pair of shows with the crowd recognizing Colley as one of the Moondogs. It led to Darsow taking the position and the two had a successful run as Demolition.\n\nColley began wrestling in the early 70s and gained his greatest recognition as a member of the Moondogs teaming with Moondog King (Edward John White a.k.a ‘Sailor White’) and later Moondog Rex (Larry Booker), who have both passed away.\n\nThe Moondogs became WWWF tag champions on March 17, 1981, defeating Rick Martel & Tony Garea in Allentown, Pennsylvania. They held the titles for four months and lost them back to Martel & Garea on July 21st.\n\nAlong with Moondog Spot, the pair worked for the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico. The duo won the North American tag titles in 1982 defeating Invader I & Super Gladiator along with the WWC World tag titles later that year.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKDy7_rB3nM\n\nWrestling as The Nightmare in Mid-South, he defeated Terry Taylor for the Mid-South North American title on May 22, 1985, in Shreveport, Louisiana. He would lose the title to Dick Murdoch on August 10th and then won the UWF tag titles alongside Eddie Gilbert on November 11, 1985, from Al Perez & Wendell Cooley.\n\nHe would also assume the role of Detroit Demolition in Memphis, teaming with Jody Hamilton as a part of The Assassins in Georgia, and teaming with Jose Luis Rivera in the WWF as the undercard team, The Shadows.\n\nIn 1990, he became Dr. X in WCW and later back to Moondog Rex in the promotion. Later, as ‘Deadeye Dick’, he was part of a group called The Desperados with Dutch Mantel and Black Bart.\n\nHe remained with WCW until July 1991 before heading to Smokey Mountain Wrestling and the USWA until his in-ring career ended in 1997."
