Decent on\n\nThe Blacktop Bully made some sense to me, because yeah, you can see some big truck driver getting into wrestling, but a wrestling golfer?\n\nPost by ThankGodForSidJustice on\n\nI went with Blacktop Bully. Repo Man and Hole in One were so over the top and ridiculous that they were entertaining in a campy way. Bully was just kind of boring and it also seemed like they were actually trying to push him as a legit upper midcard heel which was way above his station as Darsow post 1990 was pretty awful in the ring. With Repo and Whole in One he was lower card heel who put the faces over which was the perfect spot for him.\n\nPost by Ecks Ecks Ringout Ecks Ecks on\n\nI sorta enjoyed both Repo Man and Blacktop Bully.\n\nThe golf gimmick was just lame. At least \"thief\" and \"trucker\" conveyed a certain amount of badassery.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nI loved them all.\n\nInterestingly enough, I listened to a shoot several years ago and he couldn't remember doing the Hole in One Darsaw gimmick. The interviewer had to explain it to him.\n\nPost by toodarkmark on\n\nI actually love Hole In One and enjoy Blacktop in retrospect. I HATED the Repoman gimmick. Like when he stole a womans watch and Roddy Piper tried to get it back. I wanted to vomit I thought it was so stupid. Loved Smash and Krusher Kruschev also.\n\nPost by Surfer Sandman on\n\nNone of them?\n\nSeriously, he made me laugh no matter what role he was in, even the Hole in One character!\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nI posted about this before but evil golfer could be an incredible lower card gimmick if done correctly.\n\nPost by Joe Neglia on\n\nI choose \"Other\" for I give unto all of you...Zar the Mongolian!\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nI’m voting Krusher Kruschev for being the most half-assed Russian gimmick this side of the masked Russian Assassin.\n\nAt least Hole In One and Blacktop Bully were comical. Repo Man is a legend.\n\nPost by Joe Neglia on\n\n@akeemresurrection said:\n\nI’m voting Krusher Kruschev for being the most half-assed Russian gimmick this side of the masked Russian Assassin.\n\nKruschev was never presented as Russian, but as an American ex-patriot who defected to the commie side. There was even an angle where he renounced his American citizenship and the Crusher Darsow gimmick, rechristening himself Krusher Kruschev.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\n@akeemresurrection said:\n\nI’m voting Krusher Kruschev for being the most half-assed Russian gimmick this side of the masked Russian Assassin.\n\nKruschev was never presented as Russian, but as an American ex-patriot who defected to the commie side.

Thank you.\n\nPost by thecrusherwi on\n\nTrick question. All Barry Darsows are the best. Seriously he’s one of my favorite midcard acts in history. Even as plain trunks jobber to the stars Barry Darsow in WCW he was one of my favorite parts of the show. He always played to the crowd in entertaining fashion and his work was simple yet effective. And he’s a great guy to boot. Barry Darsow is the man.\n\nPost by DASH 243✅ on\n\nRemember before he was home in one, he was Stewart pain. But golfer Payne Stewart passed and he changed it to hold on one."
