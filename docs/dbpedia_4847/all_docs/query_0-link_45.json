        "text": "Professional wrestler Steve Keirn, along with Ian Douglass, takes readers through the life of the territory days in his book The Keirn Chronicles Volume One (Darkstream Press/WOHW, 2023).\n\nThe beginning discusses how the future wrestler’s father was a POW when originally thought his father was killed. Steve bonded with classmate Mike Graham’s father Eddie, who was a pro wrestling promoter in Florida, who became a mentor and at the time a father figure for Steve.\n\nHe started in pro wrestling as a referee and a driver who picked up the wrestlers from the airports before training with Hiro Matsuda. With classmates like future wrestlers Dick Slater and Mike Graham, it seemed to be his calling to get into the business.\n\nAfter going to Guatemala wrestling under a mask, Keirn started going to territories like Florida, Georgia, and the Mid-Atlantic areas, working his way in matches against NWA Champion Harley Race, tag-teaming with Ricky Gibson (who was involved in a funny road story about hitting a deer with a car that is told), and being on the road with Dusty Rhodes, who loved his country music which Keirn could not stand (again, a humorous tale about Keirn and Dusty seeing singer BoxCar Willie at a bar is featured).\n\nOnce working his way to being a solid worker, his relationship with the Grahams’ took a turn after an injury and was not the same again, which he sadly tells about the end of Eddie’s life. Other stories in the book talk about the legend that Keirn was to go to the WWWF under Vince McMahon Sr. instead of Bob Backlund to be the next champion and being asked to drop Sr.’s version of the NWA Jr. Championship.\n\nKeirn’s career hit another level when he went to Jerry Jarrett’s Memphis area and started teaming with Stan Lane as The Fabulous Ones, which may be where many wrestling fans know him from (and where I was first exposed to his work). The wild tales of the territory are told including how there was a glass ceiling that Jerry Lawler and Bill Dundee kept stars under, how Lawler offered Keirn money to break Chic Donovan’s leg, and who was going to be offered the spot in the Fabulous Ones if he refused to do it. Tales about The Fabulous Freebirds in Georgia, Kevin Sullivan, The Moondogs, and the visits to Vern Gagne’s AWA are also told. The popularity of the Fabulous Ones in Memphis gave a great tale about Lane and Keirn meeting The Beach Boys’ Mike Love, which being a fan of the band, I enjoyed, along with Kenny Rogers. Stories about The Road Warriors and how difficult they were to work with are explained.\n\nKeirn gives his opinion of the shape of the wrestlers in the AWA and Memphis, as well as his tale about the Ken Patera incident, which is interesting because Patera’s book is out now (you can read that review in my archives typing in the search engine), which was also published by WOHW. It’s neat to see two sides of a story on a story that has recently been brought back to life due to two books.\n\nWith two Forewards (one by Lane and the other by CM Punk), and Afterward, by Natalie Neidhart (who he helped in developmental), it shows in impact Keirn had on some of the modern stars as well. Since this is Part One of the book, his time with the WWF as Skinner and his work as a trainer, is not covered here, but brings the anticipation for that second section. This is a text fans of the territory days would enjoy, especially the Memphis tales, along with an understory about how his respect became for his father after trying to find it in another person adds something more than just another wrestling book for tales and in-ring action, along with the loyalty Stan Lane had for the team by willingly supporting Keirn when he felt the team needed a boost by either going to a different place or trying something else.\n\nDouglass and Keirn have a nice detailed outline of Keirn’s wrestling work, without bogging the reader down with a ton of dates and match results which sometimes can get to be too much in wrestling books. Again, the underlining stories are here as well showing the human side of a person who spent a ton of time in front of cameras. Douglass, who also wrote Brain Blair’s book (you can read that review in the archives), adds the mix of wrestling and emotion in his writing, and does it again here, making a page-turning entertaining read without being intimidating by the page-length. This is a Fabulous read.\n\nThis copy was sent courtesy of the author and publisher.\n\nThe Keirn Chronicles Volume One by Steve Keirn and Ian Douglass (Darkstream Press/WOHW, 2023)\n\nISBN: 979-8-218-17210-7 can be ordered at : https://iandouglass.net/\n\nThe Overall:\n\nPages: 425\n\nLanguage: Moderate\n\nGeared For: Ages 12 and Up\n\nFor Fans Of: Professional Wrestling, Non-Fiction, Sports, History.\n\nOne of my earliest memories of professional wrestling was seeing George “The Animal” Steele on television tearing up the ring turnbuckle and yelling at the camera. I was hooked on wrestling since then, and the other earliest memory was watching Andre The Giant get his hair cut thanks to Big John Studd and Ken Patera in 1984. Patera, along with Kenny Casanova and George Luce, details his career in the book Weight Of The World (WOHW, 2023).\n\nThe Foreward of the book by Ric Flair, tells how Flair first met Patera and became close friends ever since (Patera helped Flair get into the business), and throughout the book, Patera tells of some of the craziness that he and Flair encountered throughout the years of wrestling and being close.\n\nThe book talks about Patera’s training in weightlifting, his sports days, and getting into the wrestling business after meeting with Verne Gagne, who was sponsoring his training for the Olympics, which was not allowed back in the day, but kept quiet about it. Patera had brothers who were involved in the NFL, which also helped him when his amateur career was over to get into wrestling. The book also discusses many humorous stories of some of the biggest stars in wrestling in the 1970s and 1980s, including a young Hulk Hogan, a full chapter on Andre The Giant, Wahoo McDaniel, and of course Flair.\n\nThe story of Patera couldn’t be told without the incident in 1984 where he was accused of throwing a builder into a “closed” McDonald’s restaurant, and his interactions with the police in Wisconsin along with wrestler Masa Saito. This story has been told to the point where the truth and fiction have been mixed to become an urban legend, so it is nice to see Patera tell the tale of what happened during this night, which sent them both to jail for two years.\n\nThere is a lot of the first part of the book on his amateur sports career, from strongman competitions to training for the Pan Am Games and the Olympics. The second section is more of the wrestling side to his life, but what’s interesting about the break-up of the two is that fans of both sports can enjoy the tales he and the co-authors write. For one not familiar with the weightlifting side of the sport (including the differences between bodybuilding and weight training, and weight lifting, which Patera separates for the reader), or for the fans who did not follow his pro wrestling career, there is a good mix here. This also isn’t just a normal wrestling book where the person walks through every section of their career with multiple matches detailed. Those books are nice at times, but some turn into a Wikipedia-style win/loss history book that could bore the reader. There is not much about his return to the WWF in ways of behind-the-scenes creative input (I saw Patera live at the first Survivor Series Main Event in Richfield, Ohio, which was my second-ever live wrestling event), only to state how he was paid for his run there.\n\nSometimes reviewers overlook the packaging of the books, but let’s give credit for the title, which is perfect for this athlete, along with a wonderful photo for the cover. One of the things I also enjoy about this publisher (where I have reviewed several of the books, which you can find by typing in the search engine) is that they don’t always go the mainstream route. I’m NOT saying that Patera wasn’t a star in wrestling and lifting, but the wrestlers that WOHW publishes have stories by people which many mainstream publishers may shy away from and these have sometimes even better life stories and struggles that readers can enjoy that those wrestlers who are told to re-create wrestling history.\n\nThere is a great tale about “Superstar” Billy Graham and his “association” with the Reverend Billy Graham that is funny each time I read and hear it.\n\nFans of not just wrestling and lifting can enjoy the historical nature of this writing, especially with the tensions and competitive attitude towards Russia that readers can feel the emotion on the pages from someone proud to represent his country, which shouldn’t be overlooked here as well. This is a book that just isn’t a normal wrestler telling his story, which gives it the appeal that readers should look for, who want more than just a list of matches and win/loss results like some of the others out there in the indy publishing world.\n\nReview copy sent courtesy of the publisher.\n\nWeight Of The World by Ken Patera, Kenny Casanova, and George Luce (WOHW, 2023) ISBN: 9798354825868 can be ordered at: http://www.wohw.com.\n\nFor information on the author, visit: https://kennycasanova.com.\n\nThe Overall:\n\nPages: 459\n\nLanguage: Strong\n\nGeared For: Ages 13 and Up\n\nFor Fans Of: Professional Wrestling, Weightlifting, Sports, Non-Fiction, Olympics, History.\n\nWWE Hall of Famer Debrah Miceli, along with legendary writer Greg Oliver, discusses her life in wrestling, monster trucks, and more, in her memoir The Woman Who Would Be King: The Madusa Story (ECW Press, 2023).\n\nMiceli who was known in the professional wrestling world as Madusa in Verne Gagne’s AWA and Ted Turner’s WCW, along with being called Alundra Blayze in the WWE, candidly discusses her life throughout her time as a model, wrestling, and entering the world of monster trucks, where she was a trailblazer in both of the fields she succeeded in.\n\nWith a Forward by Paul Heyman, who knew her from the AWA when she started as a valet, Miceli had occasional matches where she won the AWA title and feuded with Sherri Martel, managed Curt Hennig and Nick Kiniski before dropping the title to Wendi Richter. She also won wrestling magazine Pro Wrestling Illustrated’s Rookie of the Year as the first female, and then leaving to spend time in Japan. After joining WCW as a stable member that included Heyman, Steve Austin, Bobby Eaton, and Rick Rude, she signed with Vince McMahon Jr.’s WWF to rebuild the women’s division. She was released and showed up in a memorable segment in WCW where she dropped the WWF title into a trash can live on air amid the Monday Night Wars, where the WWF and WCW were creating one of wrestling’s boom eras. The book goes into many aspects of her life, from the monster trucks to her family issues where she was in the dark for years about who her real father was.\n\nThe book is a mixed bag; if the reader is a casual fan of Miceli, just knowing her from the WWF days (or the Monday Night Wars) may be let down that not only half of the book is about her wrestling career, and in many parts she doesn’t give much information about what went on; for fans who love the behind-the-scenes gossip in the wrestling world, they will have to look elsewhere. However. the stories she does tell are up-front with her honest opinions, which is something that kept her strong throughout the years. If the reader wants to know more about who the person behind the spotlight, they will get a wonderful glimpse of the person with struggles and views on various topics, including at times the current wrestling world. The reader will learn about how the monster truck circuit works, which is interesting for someone like me, who is not versed in what goes on. Even if the reader isn’t a pro wrestling or a monster truck fan, they will get half of each along with the family and other parts of her life, including her thoughts of how she originally started writing ideas for her book decades ago, and claims she was a pioneer in the internet sales marketing herself as a brand among other business ideas that she did and did not finish.\n\nI first saw her in the AWA, where I was a huge fan of the league in the late 1980s, and followed her career. I would have liked more talk discussing her time in the AWA (there seems to be a lacking of books from those who were there in that era) and was a casual fan of hers, so I fell into the more wrestling sections of the book, but with a writer like the wonderful Greg Oliver and ECW Press being behind it (they have put out many quality books on wrestling in the past several years), the parts that normally wouldn’t interest me, still kept me engaged enough to care, which is a credit to the author.\n\nReview copy sent courtesy of the publisher.\n\nThe Woman Who Would Be King : The Madusa Story by Debrah Miceli with Greg Oliver (ECW Press, 2023) ISBN: 978-1-77041-671-0 Can be ordered at: http://www.ecwpress.com. Distributed in Canada by Jaguar Book Group.\n\nThe Overall:\n\nPages: 304\n\nLanguage: Moderate\n\nGeared For: Ages 12 and Up\n\nFor Fans Of: Professional Wrestling, Autobiographies, Sports, Monster Trucks\n\nMany wrestling fans of the social media era are used to their favorite stars posting pictures of themselves hanging out with fellow wrestlers, letting them into their lives outside of the ring and the television cameras. However, this wasn’t always the case, where wrestlers in the pre-2000s mostly kept to the concept of Kayfabe, a term used tracing back to the carnival days when wrestlers kept their gimmicks going all of the time. One could argue that the only current wrestlers who keep this up to an extent are Alexa Bliss (with her current creepy persona) and The Undertaker. However, one of the greatest to keep up in on-air gimmick was the original Sheik, Ed Farhat. His life is now documented in the book Blood and Fire: The Unbelievable Real-Life Story of Wrestling’s Original Sheik by Brian R. Solomon (ECW Press, 2022).\n\nIn the territory days of wrestling, Farhat was known as the dreaded Sheik ( not to be confused with The Iron Sheik who worked in the AWA and helped Vince McMahon Jr’s WWF in the 1980s get worldwide attention). Farhat discovered wrestling while in Army during World War II, was one of ten children whose family immigrated to Michigan, and also worked in the auto factories in his early wrestling days as “The Sheik of Araby, ” taking the name from a famous Rudolph Valentino movie. Once he found his groove as a wrestler with his gimmick, Farhat lived it 24-7, even having friends and relatives refer to him as “Sheik,” refusing to answer to anyone who would call him by his real name, and even buying expensive suits and wasting money (ala an early Ric Flair) to keep the image of being a rich man with a Lebanese descent. Throughout the years would carry a sword, mumble, and give crazy eye stares in public, to keep the gimmick alive.\n\nLike many wrestlers in the 1950s and 1960s, The Sheik traveled to many territories to wrestle, including Ohio, Florida, New York (where he worked for Vince McMahon Sr), and Chicago. With the popularity of wrestling on television, the idea of a wild man chasing wrestlers and fans around the ring while blading himself to bleed, added a mix of horror to his character, which eventually became a downfall in his success. His major break occurred during a match wrestling Lou Thesz where Farhat ran away from his opponent by leaving the arena and hiding under a bus during a snowstorm, which made national news.\n\nThe Sheik wasn’t just known for his wild antics in and out of the ring, but many remember him for running the Detroit territory, which he bought in 1964 from Jim Barnett and Johnny Doyle, naming it Big Time Wrestling, where he put himself as the top star of the area (at the time, fans didn’t know he was also the man in charge, because he let his father-in-law run some of the duties). This section of the United States brought out the wild, crazy matches with stars like Bobo Brazil, Bill Curry, and George Steele. With the auto industry creating a boost in the economy, Cobo Hall was the place to be for people to spend their money after work watching wrestling matches for entertainment.\n\nSolomon details the many travels of Farhat’s career in the glory days, to when he had to withstand an invasion of promoters trying to compete for his territory, his relationship with the NWA (a board of promoters who agreed to not invade each other’s area, loaned other promotions their stars in return for others, and also decided who would be the world champions). With the mystery of his life, where Farhat was living his character all the time, the author does a wonderful job using historical research, other books, and as he mentions at the beginning of the text, all with the declining participation of the living members of Farhat’s family. This doesn’t read like a plain history book with facts and dates, but flows nicely mixing the historical data with comments from other wrestlers and people who knew him as best they could know him. Solomon also looks at the fall of Farhat’s career, especially Big Time Wrestling, where a mix of the decline of the auto factories being moved for cheaper labor, and how Farhat always put himself on top of the territory refusing to let others be the top star, refusing to “do business” with stars like a young Randy Savage, Andre The Giant, and an interesting tale involving Bruno Sammartino, where it is suggested that Farhat could have been the transitional champion in the WWWF. There is a lot of Ohio history as well (where I live), including him wrestling right before Bruiser Brody’s murder in Warren, Ohio.\n\nEven if one isn’t a major fan of The Sheik himself, Solomon gives a unique look at wrestling history, including behind the scenes of the promoters and how they ran each section of the wrestling world. He also shows how Farhat wasn’t always a tough guy on camera but a family man who also tried other businesses, including a restaurant where celebrities like The Everly Brothers visited, and Farhat’s later years helping out his nephew Sabu and ECW star Rob Van Dam in the business. There are plenty of stories about wrestling stars Freddie Blassie, Dick the Bruiser, The Funk brothers, Wilber Snyder, and more, including The Sheik’s appearances for WCW and ECW. The research put into this writing is, taking from the title, unbelievable.\n\nECW Press has always had some of the best wrestling books put out, and lately, they have raised the bar even more, with books on Andre and last year’s John Arezzi’s book, which was listed as one of the best of the year on this page (you can read the review of it by typing in the search engine). Solomon, a former writer for the WWE Magazine and Pro Wrestling Illustrated, knows how to combine the facts with stories, all without putting in his personal opinion, except in the footnotes. This reviewer had two bookmarkers while reading the text which is something never done with this reviewer; one in the chapters, and the other in the back of the book with the added footnotes, because there was so much great information that was added. Many things are going on in the book, from a look at a man who gave his life to the business with his polarizing attitude and ideas, to a look at a business history of what happened to the once-popular area and refusing to make newer stars (something that ended up repeating itself many times in the wrestling world, including promotions like World Class Wrestling, the AWA, and later on with WCW), to a look at the working-class lifestyles of Ohio and surrounding states like Michigan.\n\nThis review copy was sent courtesy of the publisher.\n\nBlood and Fire: The Unbelievable Real-Life Story of Wrestling’s Original Sheik by Brian R. Solomon (ECW Press, 2022) ISBN: ISBN: 9781770415805 can be ordered at http://www.ecwpress.com\n\nDistributed in the U.S. by Baker & Taylor Publisher Services. Distributed in Canada by Jaguar Book Group.\n\nFor information on the author, visit: www. brianrsolomon.wixsite.com/author\n\nThe Overall:\n\nPages: 408\n\nLanguage: Mild\n\nGeared For: Ages 13 and Up\n\nFor Fans Of: Non Fiction, Professional Wrestling, History, Ohio/Michigan History, Sports\n\nThe 1980s wrestling scene was filled with tag teams. Granted tag team wrestling was not new in the decade; wrestling had many tag teams events and stars before the 1980s, but the turn of the decade moved newer fans to wrestling, thanks to cable television and the ending of some of the territories. With newer fans, wrestlers and promoters had to create something different and make it more exciting. Teams like The Midnight Express, The Rock N Roll Express, and The Fantastics all were stars in the 1980s. However, the biggest tag team had to been The Road Warriors.\n\nJoe “Animal” Laurinaitis ‘ book The Road Warriors: Danger, Death and The Rush of Wrestling ( Medallion Press, 2011) takes the reader through his career as one half of the legendary team, telling great road stories, along with his relationship with tag partner Hawk ( Michael Hegstrand).\n\nOne of the enjoyable parts of the book is that there are not a lot of chapters detailing the childhood of Laurinatitis before his wrestling career. He sums up his high school days and pre-wrestling days all in one short chapter. Sometimes writers of biographies or autobiographies tend to spend 5-7 chapters on their early childhood, when the reader wants to just get to the stories of how they got their break. This is not to say the background of the person does not help in the storytelling, but this book was refreshing in the fact that things were summed up quickly, which separates this from other wrestling titles.\n\nFrom starting his gimmick after the Mel Gibson movie Mad Max: The Road Warrior, and knowing several future wrestlers like Scott Simpson (Nikita Koloff) and future partner Hawk at local gyms and bars in Minnesota (at one bar the bouncers were Animal, Hawk, Rick Rude, and Barry Darsow), former wrestler Eddie Sharkey trains the gang and gets Animal a shot in Georgia with booker Ole Anderson. After Anderson has a fight with Jim Barnett, Animal actually quits wrestling for a while, along with Hawk (who was being booked in Canada as a German heel). Ole comes calling later and puts together Hawk and Animal and gives them the Georgia Tag Titles (they kayfabe the win- they never even had a match for the belts).\n\nThe book then soars , just like the Road Warriors success, with great tales of them being the top tag teams in the NWA and AWA, including when AWA promoter Verne Gagne wanted the Warriors to lose the belts to The Fabulous Ones in a way where the Warriors decided to change the ending. Tales of the team winning over Japan is also included, along with the early (and eventual problematic) ways Hawk started living a party lifestyle that caused him to miss dates , where Animal had to cover for his partner, which got worse when they started working for Vince McMahon Jr. in the WWF.\n\nAnimal tells the reader about how he first thought when he witnessed Road Warrior imitators through the various promotions via the wrestling magazines, including The Blade Runners in Bill Watts’ Mid South (who later became Sting and The Ultimate Warrior), to when Hawk went to Japan and was wrestling in his own version of the Warriors without Animal knowing about it.\n\nThe honesty in the book towards Hawk’s lifestyle choices throughout his career makes the writing more than just a typical wrestling book, especially towards the end of the book, where the relationship between the two were strained. Hawk’s failed drug tests in the WWF (WWE) is detailed, where many fans may not have known about, along with the time Jake Roberts was in the WWF as an agent, along with Animal being approached to be one as well. Newer fans may not know all of the names that Animal writes about in the book; he tends to mention their names without most background stories, assuming that the reader knows who the wrestler is, but that also shows an appeal to us fans who have followed it for years.\n\nThe overall book is a easy read and is a must for those that were fans of the Jim Crockett era territories before it went worldwide when Ted Turner bought it and renamed it WCW. There were many parts of the book that I forgot about ,including when Animal was in the match (sort of) when Sid Vicious broke his leg at WCW Sin, to the hatred between Hawk and Randy “Macho Man” Savage. Another enjoyable part is at the end of the book, several wrestlers detail their thoughts on the Warriors, from Ric Flair, Roddy Piper, Dusty Rhodes, and Bret Hart. I read this book years ago on my Kindle, but recently found a hard copy at a local book sale. I enjoyed reading this book even more the second time I read it, and is one of the better wrestling books that I have come across.\n\nThe Road Warriors: Danger, Death, and The Rush of Wrestling by Joe Laurinaitis with Andrew William Wright (Medallion Press, 2011) can be found at Amazon.\n\nThe Overall:\n\nPages: 368\n\nLanguage: Moderate\n\nGeared For: 13 and up\n\nFor Fans Of: Wrestling, Sports Biographies,\n\nThere were certain wrestlers who I just did not like in professional wrestling, regardless of how they were portrayed by the different leagues. A few of them were The Fabulous Freebirds (especially the WCW era with Jimmy Garvin and Michael Hayes), Bam Bam Bigelow, Stan Hansen, The Ultimate Warrior, and most of the ECW roster were some of the names I never got behind. Another one was Vader (also known as Big Van Vader).\n\nI remember following him in the AWA as “Baby Bull” Leon White, and just couldn’t get behind the character; he seemed over pushed to me at the time fighting for the AWA title a few times against Stan Hansen. I was a big Nick Bockwinkel and Curt Hennig fan in the AWA, so whenever White started getting a bigger push in the league, I longed to see Hennig or Bockwinkel in a classic match instead of the “Awe Shucks” persona with a trucker hat in title matches, which was what “Baby Bull” came off as at the time (along with it was hard to get behind a 300 pound man with the nickname “Baby,” thanks to promoter Verne Gagne). Of course, when White signed WCW in the 1990s, Vader was put against my favorite wrestler Sting, who was one of the top stars of the league. Vader came in so strong against Sting as the unstoppable monster, even beating him for the WCW title, really ticked me off as a young teenager. I cheered for some heels (bad guys) in wrestling, but having someone dismantle Sting as Vader did, was just too much for my taste, making Sting not as tough as he originally was in my eyes at the time.\n\nIt’s Vader Time: The Story of a Modern Day Gladiator by White, along with Kenny Casanova (WOHW Publishers, 2019), tells how White became an international wrestling star, along with his life outside the ring, with tremendous health struggles along the way. Casanova , who was mentioned at the 2019 WWE Hall of Fame (thanks to Brutus Beefcake), also helped write books by Kamala, Brutus Beefcake, and ECW’s Sabu (You can read my review of Beefcake’s book, along with a Q&A with Casanova, on the Slam Sports Wrestling site).\n\nAfter the Foreword from Mick Foley that starts the pages off, the book grabs the reader immediately with White telling the story about the match in Japan against Hansen, where Vader’s eye popped out of its socket (among other injuries during the brawl). The hardcore matches pile up from there, along with the many injuries from his college and pro football and wrestling careers. Tales such as knee and shoulder injuries, along with concussions, are all detailed in the book.\n\nWhite discusses how he started training in the AWA after walking into the locker room one day as a fan straight into the locker room, coming face to face with Bruiser Brody, along with how being trained by Brad Rheigans led him to the world of wrestling to avoid going back to his life of small crimes in Compton, CA which he lived in his youth. After several football injuries, (including a gruesome story where a college teammate had to have a doctor’s assistance with making a hole in his head with a power drill) White learns his stiff style of wrestling by working with some of the toughest wrestlers at the time, including Brody, Hansen, and Otto Wantz in Germany.\n\nWhite , after leaving the AWA, goes to Japan where he receives the Vader gimmick from promoter Antonio Inoki. This part was informative in the reading, due to the detailed description of how the character was created from a Japanese comic book, to how the horned headgear that he wore to the ring was created. The back story about the helmet headgear and its symbolism in culture was more than just a gimmick that was given to him; details on how the helmet’s steam blowing out of it worked , and the other wrestlers who were originally considered to be the Vader character was also insightful.\n\nThe book covers Vader’s WCW and WWE careers as well, including great behind the scenes stories about Sting, Dusty Rhodes, Harley Race, Ron Simmons, and Mick Foley. There are signature events in his career that are covered too , such as The White Castle of Fear, the 1993 Beach Blast mini movie (where the executives at Turner Home Entertainment decided that wrestling heels blowing up a boat with a spy little person was a great idea), the WCW title reigns, Foley losing his ear in a match with him, and the time he injured preliminary wrestler Joe Thurman, which ended Thurman’s career. Tales about backstage politics by Ric Flair, Shawn Michaels, Eric Bischoff, and Hulk Hogan are also discussed in the writing. Vader’s take on the 1997 Montreal Screw job between Bret Hart and Michaels, from his point of view, to his appearances on the TV show Boy Meets World are also featured.\n\nThe book isn’t all about his wrestling career in the American, Mexican, German, and Japanese leagues. The publication covers the emotional tales about the injuries White accumulated throughout his career, which made for serious health problems toward the end of his life, from his battles with sleep apnea, arthritis, breathing problems, and being in a coma. The emotional diagnosis of his heart and the last year of his life is covered by his son, which gives another aspect of the events. One meeting with a doctor discussing his health issues gives a special meaning to the subtitle of the book , using the term “gladiator”, which ties the cover to the theme of the book, gives the complete package its fullness (no spoilers here, but the title wasn’t just randomly chosen).\n\nVader, along with Casanova, combines humor with the inner workings of wrestling on top of an emotional backdrop which many wrestling fans should enjoy. Usually self-published books are filled with grammar errors and unchecked facts, which sometimes makes it hard for me to review. Although editors sometimes miss errors here and there, it should not be so evident to distract from the overall book. The writing here does just that, by keeping the story going, in which I kept reading page after page, because the tone kept me wanting to read more.\n\nAfter reading this book, I started to go back and watch some of the highlighted matches that are available online to re-watch Vader’s matches. I think one reason I disliked him so much against Sting (looking at it now, knowing more about how wrestling is presented) was that White was just that good at being the monster heel, which was his job. Dusty Rhodes’ booking of him as unstoppable worked big time, and also made his WCW title loss to Ron Simmons more shocking because no one could beat Vader at the time, even the top star Sting. By the time he got to the WWF, he was not only injured (as told in the book), but , in my opinion, was limited in what he could do, which weakened him after the dominate years in WCW and international tours that made him outshine everyone on the rosters (with help from the boost of the wrestling magazines, like the ones owned by Stanley Weston). I did get to see him live in 1997 in Youngstown , Ohio verses Kane at a live event with the WWF (he was scheduled another time, but wasn’t there).\n\nI was hoping for a part about Vader returning to the WWE as a part of the Table For 3 show, where he was with Sting, and Diamond Dallas Page, or maybe why he agreed to do it. The only part he discusses here is his brief returns in matches against Heath Slater, and inducting Stan Hansen in the WWE Hall of Fame. Being a Sting fan, many wrestling books briefly mention him in passing, so the more stories about him I can get is good with me , and this book is one of the books with several stories about The Stinger, especially how much he helped Vader in his WCW matches (which as a Sting fan, I figured it was the office making him look bad by getting destroyed in matches at times- this book dispels that myth, by stating how Sting helped plan out the matches and took Vader under his wing to teach him a different style of wrestling that he wasn’t used to). At almost 400 pages, the book does a great job covering Vader’s life, without missing much.\n\nThis was a very enjoyable book, especially since I was not a huge Vader fan. The cover of the book is amazing , with Vader standing in front of the Rocky Mountains with the helmet and skulls below his feet. When the book came in the mail, and I opened the package, I was in awe of how well done the packaging covers (both front and back) were designed, which again, sometimes self published books tend to ignore. Don’t let not being a Vader fan prevent you from checking this book out (if you weren’t a fan of his gimmick), because there are great tales about the AWA (which tends to get overlooked in books), WCW, WWF, and the Japanese leagues and stars. Being not a huge fan of Japanese wrestling, I thought the extended tales about his time in Japan would drag and lose my interest, however this was not the case.\n\nAlong with the touching tales of forgiveness throughout the book, from White’s problems with certain wrestlers to reconnecting with his son (after years of being on the road) before Vader’s 2018 death, the book gives a new look on the person who was a dominate monster in front of the audiences, yet a different man when he was away from the cameras.\n\nThis review copy was sent courtesy of Kenny Casanova and WOHW Publishers.\n\nIt’s Vader Time : The Story of a Modern Day Gladiator (WOHW Publishers, 2019) by Leon White and Kenny Casanova (ISBN: 978-1-941356-08-1) can be ordered at http://www.wohw.com.

My father showed me WWF wrestling with George “The Animal” Steele on television one Saturday afternoon, and I was hooked on it. Wrestling wasn’t on every week in my area then, so it wasn’t really until 1986 after my grandmother taped the WWF’s “Saturday Night’s Main Event” episodes on her VCR, that I got to see more of it. It wasn’t long afterwards that wrestling was on many channels in my area, along with my family getting cable TV , that I got to follow it every week.\n\nBefore the Internet, the only way to follow some of the other territories that I was not exposed to, along with learning about the history of wrestling, was through the wrestling magazines. One wrestler I knew the name of, but didn’t know much about, was Gene Kiniski, that is until I read Gene Kiniski Canadian Wrestling Legend by Steven Verrier (McFarland, 2019).\n\nThe book gives an great insight of the wrestler who won the AWA and NWA World Titles in his career, from his football days playing for the Edmonton Eskimos, to his life as a wrestler. Verrier uses great text research throughout the book to help craft the painting of who Kiniski was in and out of the ring. The writing takes the reader into how Kiniski first got into wrestling as a security person and selling programs (as a part of the University of Arizona football team), to Kiniski’s days in the many territories like Texas, Hawaii, Houston, and the big federations like the WWWF, NWA, and the AWA.\n\nOne of the great things about this biography is the research that Verrier puts into the 232 page writing. The author uses other wrestling books, newspapers, and websites to help with his stories. Verrier also details interviews from those that knew Kiniski, including his sons Nick and Kelly (who both wrote forwards and helped with some of the photographs), and other wrestlers. The stories about Kiniski’s personal life, with his marriage and raising his sons, add a different perspective to the writing, as opposed to the normal wrestling books, where drugs and sex are sometimes the main theme. This book is what one would use for a college course in teaching about wrestlers in the territory days.\n\nI learned quite a bit about some of the tag team partners and other opponents that Kiniski faced; I knew he beat Verne Gagne for the AWA World Title, and Lou Thesz for the NWA Title, but he was in the ring with many of the greats such as The Funks, Dick The Bruiser, Fritz Von Erich, Pedro Morales, and more. His tag teams with Ivan Koloff, Wilbur Synder, and “Hard Boiled” Hagerty shows he worked with some of the best.\n\nFor those that may only remember Kiniski’s sons in the AWA, or that he was the referee at Starrcade 1983 for the Ric Flair vs Harley Race main event, will learn quite a bit by reading this book. I remember his son Nick in the AWA, being managed by both Sherri Martel and Madusa Miceli in their early days. The years after his retirement as a promoter and wrestling a few times (like the WWF legends battle royal in 1987 and his appearance at WCW’s “Slamboree” PPV), along with his life outside of the ring, brings an emotional segment to the story, where quite a bit of the book features a history of his in ring career.\n\nGene Kiniski Canadian Wrestling Legend is a nice read full of facts and interviews that create the story of a wrestler who most of today’s wrestling fans never heard of. The book gives those that want to know more about the wrestling of the 1960s and 1970s stars a history lesson. The textbook or essay format may not be very colorful compared to some of the books released today, but that is also what makes it a good read. This is an almanac of the days when one wrestler didn’t need a flashy gimmick to get over, and still ended up being considered one of the best.\n\nThis review copy was sent courtesy of McFarland Books.\n\nGene Kiniski Canadian Wrestling Legend by Steven Verrier (ISBN: 978-1-4766-7483-4 eISBN: 978-1-4766-3427-2) can be ordered at http://www.McFarlandbooks.com or at 800-253-2187.\n\nFor information about the author, go to http://www.stevenverrier.com\n\nThe Overall:\n\nPages: 254\n\nLanguage: None\n\nGeared For: 13 and up.\n\nFor Fans Of: Pro Wrestling History, Biographies.\n\nTim Hornbaker’s “Death Of The Territories: Expansion, Betrayal, and the War that Changed Pro Wrestling Forever” (ECW Press, 2018) is a historical lesson covering how the end of the wrestling territories came to be and the reasons for the demise.\n\nBefore the WWF took over wrestling in the 1980s, there were many different territories where wrestlers could go and , in some cases, get quality television exposure. If a wrestler’s appeal with the audience was wearing thin, they could go to a territory and either revamp their characters, or learn more skills before returning months or years later.\n\nSome of the many states that had their own territories included Memphis, Texas, Florida, the Carolinas, California, and St. Louis, which were all run by different promoters. Many of them bonded together as part of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), until divisions started when Vince McMahon Jr. bought his father’s company and started invading the territories for their stars.\n\nHornbaker’s book covers many of the different promoters like Bill Watts, Joe Blanchard, Leory McGuirk, Jim Barnett , and Verne Gagne. Other promoters covered in his history include The Poffos, The Sheik (Ed Farhat), Ann Gunkle , Don Owen, and the Fullers.\n\nThe book covers how each of the special territories ran their local television productions. Some of the main television programs were WCCW (from Texas) and the AWA (Minnesota) on ESPN, Jim Crockett Promotions and Georgia Championship Wrestling on WTBS, and the WWF’s syndicated programs, which started invading the other television stations with better deals for the advertisers by giving them bigger star names, which became a main reason the other leagues folded.\n\nOne of the interesting parts of the book is when the author details how some companies would try and enter the other’s area, and with the help of researched attendance numbers, show that some of the fans in certain areas of the United States did not accept the WWF when they ran shows. Memphis was one state that held better television and attendance numbers for their own stars, like Jerry Lawler, as opposed to lower numbers when the WWF tried to come into the area. There were areas where the WWF ran shows that barely drew at the time, as opposed to the myth that every state wanted the WWF in its town.\n\nThe story of Vince McMahon Jr’s rise to the wrestling empire by using business techniques such as banning other photographers from his ringside area, to his use of pay per view to help the product, and grabbing stars from other areas are all covered here, including when he aired WWF programming on WTBS. Georgia Championship Wrestling’s booker Ole Anderson’s counter to this time is also interesting, as well as how the other promoters and bookers handled the WWF invading their areas.\n\nI was also intrigued when Hornbaker writes in 1983, McMahon Jr. took over the Ohio region with his show being on Channel 23 in Akron (one of the channels I watched WWF on when I started fully watching in 1986), and also held shows in East Liverpool and Struthers, Ohio (both not far from where I live). It was nice to see my local area covered in the book (mostly the WWF was big in Warren and Youngstown when I started watching and attending, although an occasional Struthers show would be held).\n\nThe book covers the rise of Jim Crockett Jr.’s taking over the Carolinas, which became so popular that most of the fans called his league the NWA, although there were many other members of the NWA, until Ted Turner bought out Crockett and renamed it WCW (World Championship Wrestling) to avoid confusion with the other NWA territories that were still running shows.\n\nThe history of the territories would not be complete without covering the AWA, Memphis, and World Class mergers in trying to keep their leagues afloat, with the WCW and WWF being the big two leagues. The AWA at one time was considered one of the big three leagues, but with Verne Gagne losing steam, the idea to try and co-promote was attempted.\n\nHornbaker’s writing is entertaining without having a bunch of dates confusing and boring the reader, and his research is wonderfully detailed, so those that want to know the historical dates won’t be disappointed either. He covers the events in readable chapters without bogging down the reader that they are reading a textbook. There is so much information on the topic, he could have easily have made it 300 pages long, but Hornbaker keeps it at a pleasant 241 pages of text (not counting the pages of book notes). The author also doesn’t become one of the “I hate the WWF for taking over” people, nor does join the argument that “All things WWF is great” either. He writes a nice non- judgmental book where the numbers and the research makes the readers decide for themselves.\n\nBeing a lover of the territory days (I am in the minority apparently who loved the AWA years after 1983 when they lost many stars like Hulk Hogan, Jesse Ventura, and Bobby Heenan- the Bockwinkle/Hennig matches are still some of the most underrated matches ever). This book is a must read for those who want to re-live the days, along with learning information that you may not have known (I for one did not know that Gagne once tried to negotiate a deal to sell out to McMahon Jr, long before he folded the league). “Death of The Territories” is a book that needs to be on every wrestling historian and fans’ book shelf.\n\nThis review copy was given courtesy of ECW Press.\n\n“Death of The Territories” by Tim Hornbaker (ECW Press, 2018) IBSN: 978-1-77041-384-9 (softcover), 978-1-77305-232-8 (ePub) , 978-1-77305-233-5 (PDF) can be found at http://www.ecwpress.com\n\nFor information on the author, go to twitter@TimHornbaker.\n\nEvery day when I was in junior high and high school, , I would run home and turn on ESPN to watch the daily wrestling shows that they aired, either World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) from Texas or one of my favorites, the American Wrestling Association (AWA) out of Minneapolis area. Every day the AWA was on, I’d see announcer Larry Nelson welcome me to an hour of wrestling that was different from Vince McMahon’s WWF at time. The AWA focused more on wrestling and less on comedic characters, which was exciting for me (I loved all wrestling, but I still love watching the AWA).\n\nThis is the second time I have read Larry Nelson’s book, titled “Stranglehold: An Intriguing Behind The Scenes Glimpse Into The Private World of Professional Wrestling.” The book’s copyright is from 1999 by Chump Change Publishing. I decided to re-read the book after several mentions of Nelson have appeared on one of my favorite wrestling podcasts. The book has some good and bad in it, which I am going to review.\n\nNelson (real name Larry Shipley) got his start in the radio business where he started interviewing wrestlers from the AWA as a way to boost ratings. His first interview was Bobby Heenan who came into the studio thinking that Nelson wanted to fight Heenan. After the shows started to get popular, the station got pressured by the WWF to start having their talent on the air, not just the AWA Stars, which Nelson was not a major fan of because it was the AWA that helped them get started. Through his work with the wrestlers on the show, he was hired to do some voice work for the AWA and some interviews, which led to his hiring full time with the AWA after the radio station dropped the wrestling show, which was on AM Radio, due to the popularity of FM Radio.\n\nNelson writes throughout the book about his partying habits (scotch and cocaine), which escalated by hanging out with professional wrestlers. When he was working on the interviews, which took place in Winnipeg Canada, the wrestlers would try to keep themselves occupied when on the road as well. Nelson writes about Rick Martel and Curt Hennig amateur wrestling each other in the hotel rooms, Larry Zbyszko would hide in his room and play the game Battleship, Nick Bockwinkel stayed in his room, and the wild activities of Wally Karbo, Stan Lane, and Road Warrior Hawk.\n\nNelson talks about his relationship with another AWA Announcer Ken Resnick, who was not liked by the other AWA Wrestlers or staff , and how Resnick walked out of the company the day of their big event WrestleRock, after finding out that he was going to share the announcing duties with Nelson. Since the card was to have a concert to help promote the event, Nelson was asked to help suggest some acts due to his radio background. He suggested the rock band The Fabulous Thunderbirds, who were starting to break after the song “Tuff Enuff” hit radio. Owner Verne Gagne decided on Waylon Jennings due to his affordable salary and the music executives at the meeting also thought that Jennings could bring several fans of different genres to come to the event.\n\nA few other great stories in the book talks about how wrestler John Nord and Greg Gagne (Verne’s Son) almost got into a fight at a interview taping over payment, Curt Hennig and Playboy Buddy Rose’s luck at the casinos when the AWA moved the tapings to Vegas, and how Bruiser Brody threw a mop bucket filled with vomit onto the owner of The Showboat Casino, where the tapings were held. He also describes the time The Midnight Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) danced by themselves at a club, when NWA Champion Ric Flair tried to pick up and out drink Kathy Gagne (Verne’s son), and when Stan Hansen and Brody decided to go overhead bowling.\n\nIn re-reading the book, I was curious to see what Nelson’s take on the decline of the AWA. He blames the major sign that the league was falling apart in competing with the WWF was the loss of the ESPN TV deal. He also states that when a toy company made the AWA action figures, the fans didn’t buy them and were a flop. He claims that he was never paid when the AWA made home videos trying to keep up with the NWA and WWF. Not being paid for his services, turning all his work into one day instead of three and four days, and bad business deals with Verne Gagne and other businesses all played a role in the league failing. Because of some of these events, Nelson decided to move to Florida with no notice to the AWA, and was then replaced by Eric Bischoff.\n\nThe bad parts of this book deals with its editing. I know Nelson’s book is printed by a minor company or even self published company; however the editing could have been better. Most of the photographs “unless noted” are from Nelson’s personal collection, including the cover. The photographs, though, look like they were copied on a Zerox machine. Many of them are blurry, including the cover which features Nelson and Brody.\n\nAnother problem I have with the book is some of the inaccuracies in the book and typos. Nelson talks about wrestlers John Nord as “John Ord” and Michael Hayes as “Hays.” He also says that Nick Bockwinkel vs Stan Hansen at WrestleRock was to be the rematch between the two, that Hansen “won the title from Bockwinkel in Chicago before a huge crowd” (Hansen beat Rick Martel in 1985 in East Rutherford, New Jersey and WrestleRock wasn’t until 1986). Another error stated in the book is Nelson telling the reader that the famous Bockwinkel vs Curt Hennig match that went an 1 hour draw on ESPN was “live from The Cow Palace in San Francisco” (It was at The Showboat Casino in Vegas in 1986, which is now found on the Curt Hennig WWE DVD).\n\nAnother match error in the book is when Nelson states that during the AWA merger with the USWA and World Class Wrestling, AWA Champion Jerry Lawler and Kerry Von Erich each won a match and wrestled two times. “Lawler won the championship in his home territory of Tennessee, then wrestled Von Erich later in Texas, where Von Erich won.”\n\nJust my research alone, Jerry Lawler beat Hennig for the title. He then fought Von Erich in a series of unification matches before the bloody SuperClash match. Lawler fought him in 1988 in Tennessee (which I assume this is the match he’s talking about) in 1988. Kerry and Jerry both punched the first referee for a DQ finish. The match was restarted by a second referee and Kerry pinned Lawler with a piledriver, which was banned in Tennessee. So Lawler was declared the winner by DQ, which in World Class Wrestling, the champion could lose the belt during a DQ. Both wrestlers left with their respected belts regardless. Then there was a “Texas Death Match” at the Cotton Bowl in Texas, which the AWA refused to recognize Kerry as the winner due to a bias referee. Kerry then fought Lawler in Texas again for a TV Taping, where announcer Terry Garvin got involved when he threw a chair into the ring. The big match was at SuperClash, which Lawler won due to the referee stopping the bout due to Kerry’s bleeding. The way the writer writes Nelson’s take, Von Erich won the AWA Title, which he did not. And this was more than wrestling only two times.\n\nYet another error in the book details the ending of the AWA. Nelson says:\n\n“A few key people stayed until the bitter end. Greg Gagne remained because he and his father, Verne, were the owners. Larry Zbyszko, who had married Kathy Gagne, hung on out of family loyalty. Nick Bockwinkel, with twenty years invested in the AWA, was also loyal to the end.”\n\nYes, Gagne and Zbyszko stayed (Zbyszko was the last AWA Champion), but Nick Bockwinkel was working as a road agent for the WWF in the last years he was in the business- the AWA folded in 1991, and Bockwinkel was in the WWF from 1987-1989. He was out of wrestling in 1991 from my research. Bockwinkel even wrestled in 1987 at a WWF Show-a legends battle royal in the Meadowlands in New Jersey. This may sound like a small detail, but it shows that even Bockwinkel was gone from the AWA before it closed.\n\nOne interesting quote in the book is when Nelson talks about WCW, where Eric Bischoff was running the league at the time of the writing. Nelson writes, “If Bischoff’s ego trip continues, it is likely Vince McMahon’s WWF will win the current wrestling war.” WCW ended up being sold to McMahon in 2001.\n\nOverall the book is a good read besides some of the errors in it. Nelson very briefly states a sentence or two throughout the book about his partying, but it does not distract from the book, say like Sunny’s book did, which I reviewed for Slam Sports Wrestling (you can find that link in the March 2016 Archives at the side of this site). At 152 pages, one could read it in one sitting if one wanted. I do wish there were more stories about Bockwinkel, Zbyszko, Sgt. Slaughter, and others, but it is still filled with good tales. I think the AWA gets a bad rap in the wrestling world and whatever few books I can get on it, I’m going to enjoy it, and I enjoyed most of Nelson’s book.\n\nA Special Thanks to The Great Brian Last for providing me with some last second information.\n\n(Larry Nelson’s book is available at Amazon.com)\n\n(Nelson, Larry and Jones, James. Stranglehold: An Intriguing Behind The Scenes Glimpse Into The Private World Of Professional Wrestling. Denver: Chump Change Publishing, 1999. )\n\nWhen people find out I am a professional wrestling fan, they always ask me who my favorites are. I tell them Sting, Bret Hart, Curt Hennig, Nick Bockwinkel, and Bobby Heenan would be my top 5 growing up. We lost Hennig a while ago, and this weekend the news came that Nick Bockwinkel died at age 80.\n\nFor people who did not grow up watching wrestling in the 1970s-1990s, before the WWE became pretty much the only major league in the world, they were in the top 3, along with the NWA, and the AWA. There were other territories, but those were the big three. The champion of those three would travel to certain territories that were in partners with the leagues and trade talent every several months (for instance a wrestler who was in Minnesota would be sent to Oklahoma for 6 months if they promoters were under the AWA banner).\n\nBockwinkel was one of the major staples of the AWA based out of Minnesota and under the promoter Verne Gagne. Before Vince McMahon Jr. started buying up the talent and going national with the WWF in the 1980s, the AWA had stars like Hulk Hogan, Jesse Ventura, Bobby Heenan, among others.\n\nJust some of the talent Nick Bockwinkel wrestled in his day were: Bruiser Brody, Verne Gagne, Rick Martel, Ric Flair, Andre the Giant, Hulk Hogan, Terry Funk, Randy Savage, Jerry Lawler, Dusty Rhodes, Stan Hansen, and Magnum T.A. among others. Managed by Bobby Heenan in the AWA days, they were the perfect heel couple. They looked like they hung out together; both hailing from Beverly Hills, California, blond hair and wearing fancy suits.\n\nBockwinkel held the AWA World Title 4 times, along with the AWA Tag Team Titles 3 times with Ray Stevens, fought then WWWF Champion Bob Backlund , was WCW Commissioner and WWF road agent. He was also on the TV Shows Hawaii 5-O, The Monkees and was a winning contestant on The Hollywood Squares.\n\nThe thing I liked most about Bockwinkel was no matter if he was a heel or a face he kept a monotone voice when he talked during his interviews, using big words to convey his message, as opposed to some of the other wrestlers of the day who would yell and scream at their opponents. He was a classy heel, wearing suits during some of his interviews.\n\nIn the mid 1980s, I remember being able to watch wrestling every day of the week, with help from ESPN, which would air either the AWA or World Class Wrestling from Texas weekday afternoons. I remember Bockwinkel’s legendary feud with a Pre-Mr. Perfect Curt Hennig on those TV Shows, where one match in particular went a 1 hour time limit draw. Hennig beat Bockwinkel, with help from Nick’s rival/tag partner at times Larry Zbyszko handing him a roll of coins, for the AWA World Title. Hennig was a edgy babyface character until that match where he turned heel, which he carried the momentum with his Mr. Perfect character in the WWF. The matches with Hennig were not only entertaining matches, but great storytelling.\n\nBockwinkel was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2007, and also became the President of the Cauliflower Alley Club, which is a club for boxing and wrestling people.\n\nBobby Heenan wrote in his first book in 2002 with Steve Anderson that Nick was “the only guy I know that if you ask him what time it is he tells you how to build a watch.” And that “Baron Von Raschke always told Nick ‘You’re living proof that a man can be educated beyond his means.’”\n\nFor the wrestling fans my age, they know what a talent Bockwinkel was. I always felt he was underrated when it came to best in ring technicians and interviewers. For those that missed out of that era, go to youtube and watch some of his matches (especially his ones with Hennig) and his interviews. It’s too bad I never got to see him wrestle live (the AWA never came around my area), but going back today and watching some of his matches brought back childhood memories of a true legend. I know that word gets passed around lightly, but it definitely fit Mr. Bockwinkel."
