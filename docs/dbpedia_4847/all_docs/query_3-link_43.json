        "text": "I figured I’d go ahead and review the rest of the WXO Wrestling episodes since there are a grand total of two more episodes including the one I’m writing about at this very moment. The first episode was not the worst wrestling show I’ve ever seen in my life but wasn’t particularly great either. Basically it came across like an episode of WCW Worldwide with a couple of angles tacked on to it instead of it being entirely wrestling for wrestling’s sake. Let’s find out if that trend continues or if the WXO turns into something amazing in week two.\n\nContinue reading “WXO Wrestling #2 (January 23, 2000)” →\n\nBack around the turn of the century when wrestling was perhaps the hottest it had ever been (and ever would be) a bajillion and a half wrestling promotions were founded trying to cash in on that popularity. WXO was one of them. Allegedly presenting a more “family friendly” wrestling product for folks who were sick of bloody hardcore brawls and people telling each other to “suck it,” WXO managed to put out three syndicated episodes of TV wrestling in January 2000 before closing up shop. Thanks to YouTube all three of these episodes are readily available so I’ve decided to check them out since failed wrestling promotions are pretty much this site’s bread and butter. So let’s get down to it and start at the very beginning, Episode #1 which every source I’ve found lists as having aired on January 16, 2000, though since it was a syndicated show it may have aired on other dates depending on the market.\n\nContinue reading “WXO Wrestling #1 (January 16, 2000)” →\n\nI’m burnt on on the Attitude Era and have already done a write-up for the episode of Raw Is War I would be scheduled to watch this week anyway so instead of checking out Sunday Night Heat or SummerSlam ’98 I’ve decided to watch some good-ass studio wrestling from the 1980s, specifically NWA World Championship Wrestling from May 11, 1985. Didn’t really pick this for any other reason than the fact that it popped up on YouTube and had a thumbnail of Abdullah the Butcher looking nuts and that’s good enough for me.\n\nContinue reading “NWA World Championship Wrestling (May 11, 1985)” →\n\nFor reasons I cannot even begin to fathom the 1997 edition of WCW’s often reviled World War 3 PPV was one of the offerings on the freebie tier of the award winning WWE Network. Since WCW and shitty gimmick matches are my shit I had no choice but to watch it. So I did. Here are words about it.\n\nContinue reading “WCW World War 3 1997 (November 23, 1997)” →\n\nToday, for reasons I cannot possibly comprehend, I decided to watch an episode of WWF Wrestling Challenge from 1992. I could make up some story about how I want to fill in some gaps in my WWE reviews here and since I’d not reviewed a single show from 1992 decided to check this one out but that would be a lie. The truth is, this was randomly on YouTube and was only like 40 minutes long so I decided to watch it while folding laundry because early 90s WWF television is the very definition of background noise so let’s check it out!\n\nContinue reading “WWF Wrestling Challenge (April 26, 1992)” →\n\nMy deep dive into the Royal Rumbles continues with our first Rumble of the 90s. Coming to us from the Orlando Arena in beautiful(?) Orlando, Florida, the 1990 Rumble is easily one of my favorite Royal Rumbles from my youth. It’s been a LONG time since I’ve watched it though and am curious if it actually holds up or if I was just amped as fuck at age nine over the notion of an Ultimate Warrior vs. Hulk Hogan showdown teased during the Rumble. Let’s see!\n\nContinue reading “WWF Royal Rumble 1990 (January 21, 1990)” →\n\nBack before the WWE Network, 18 “Monthly Specials” and 900 hours of broadcast television a week there was scant little wrestling to watch. Sure there was stuff like Jim Crockett Promotions/NWA/WCW on the Superstation and the AWA on ESPN but that sort of stuff didn’t really appeal much to children. The WWF, however, had just the thing to meet the wrestling needs of small children across the United States: Coliseum Videos.\n\nThese tapes would have a few matches, often “Coliseum Video exclusives” filmed either at house shows or as dark matches during Wrestling Challenge tapings alongside goofy backstage stuff and profiles on various wrestlers. For those of us who became wrestling fans in the 80s or early 90s the Coliseum Videos became an integral part of our fandom, frequently being rented from the local video rental store and watched repeatedly. So when the WWE recently dumped a bunch of them up on the WWE Network, I for one was very excited.\n\nWhile a lot of the matches on these tapes weren’t exactly five-star mat classics there are some hidden classics as well as matches that I, for whatever reason, thought were great when I was ten years old. Today we’re going to check on what is probably the pinnacle of the Coliseum Videos, 1993’s Smack ‘Em Whack ‘Em.\n\nContinue reading “WWF Smack ’Em Whack ‘Em (March 31, 1993)” →"
