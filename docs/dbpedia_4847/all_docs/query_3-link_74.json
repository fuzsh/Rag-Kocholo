        "text": "Al Blake, who had a brief national run as “The Russian Assassin” Vladimir Petrov in Mid-Atlantic Wrestling / Jim Crockett Promotions, has died. He was 66.\n\nHe had been hired to replace Barry Darsow, who was known as Vladimir Khrushchev, in a team with Ivan Koloff.\n\nIronically, it was a case of one Minnesotan pretending to be a Russian villain replacing another.\n\nAlan Richard Blake was born on November 12, 1957, to Raymond and Shirley Blake in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He attended St. Francis High School, graduating in 1976, followed by two years at Anoka Ramsey Community College where he obtained a General Associate of Arts Degree.\n\nMusic and exercise were two constants in Blake’s life. According to the obituary announcing his death on July 27, 2024, of an undisclosed cause, his mother taught piano and vocal lessons, and his father was a band director.\n\nIn 1987, he started a journey into pro wrestling under famed trainer Eddie Sharkey. At 6-foot-3 and 282 pounds, he was well suited for the times, and for bouncing in bars, which is where Sharkey found him.\n\nLike yet another Minnesotan turned Russian, Nikita Koloff, Blake got a break very, very early in his career, and with Darsow moving on to the WWF to join Demolition, a new villain was needed.\n\nInitially, he was under a mask as The Russian Assassin, in Paul Jones‘ stable, but soon was working without it as Vladimir Petrov.\n\nIn his autobiography, “Is That Wrestling Fake?” Ivan Koloff didn’t have a lot to say about Blake:\n\nWhen Barry left, Al Blake filled the void as Vladimir Petrov. Nikita had turned babyface by that time, so we feuded with him and Dusty Rhodes, as well as the Rock ‘n’ Roll Express. After leaving to wrestle for Bill Watts‘ Universal Wrestling Federation, Al was busted for selling drugs. He retired from wrestling until 1991, when he worked for the WWF under his own name. One year later, he retired for good.\n\nOn November 30, 1988, a jury convicted Alan Richard Blake and Gary Evans Lundgren of multiple offenses relating to a conspiracy to distribute illegal drugs.\n\nThe investigation actually went back to late 1983, where Blake and Lundgren were working at a Minneapolis night club, and Blake acted as muscle for the nightclub’s owner, Curtis Anderson, and helped prepare drugs for sale. According to the court case, there was “surveillance of a conversation during which Blake discussed weapons (including hand grenades) and his willingness to harm another member of the drug operation suspected of being a government informant.”\n\n[Further details of the arrest, United States of America, Appellee, v. Alan Richard Blake, Appellant. United States of America, Appellee, v. Gary Evans Lundgren, Appellant, 862 F.2d 171 (8th Cir. 1988), can be found here.]\n\nIt is unclear how much of his apparent six-year sentence that Blake served.\n\nIn a podcast appearance, Nikita Koloff said that he didn’t know a lot about Al. “I know his personality didn’t gel well with a lot of guys,” said Koloff. “He was one guy you were not going to rib. He had a personality, that expression, ‘If looks could kill,’ Vladmir/Al had that type of personality.”\n\n“He just never excelled to the level that they were helping he would,” added Nikita Koloff.\n\nIn Watts’ UWF, Petrov had a short feud with “Dr. Death” Steve Williams over the UWF championship, and formed a team with Angel of Death (Dave Sheldon).\n\nAs Ivan Koloff noted, Blake’s WWF stint was brief and there was never any significant push.\n\nPost-wrestling, Blake worked in numerous professions, but for the last decade, living in Pine City, Minnesota, he worked at Ruby’s Pantry where he worked as the Director of Food Sourcing.\n\nBlake is survived by his wife, Karla Nelson, a well-known bodybuilder, who he met in 1990 and married in 1992, and their daughter, Claire, and son, Andrew."
