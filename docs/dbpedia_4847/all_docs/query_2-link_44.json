        "text": "Commissions continue again, this one coming from friend Ko-fi contributor SSW Gogeta. You can be like them and pay me to write about all types of stuff. People tend to choose wrestling matches, but very little is entirely off the table, so long as I haven’t written about it before (and please, come prepared with a date or show name or something if it isn’t obvious). You can commission a piece of writing of your choosing by heading on over to www.ko-fi.com/elhijodelsimon. The current rate is $5/match or thing or $10 for anything over an hour, and if you have some aim that cannot be figured out through simple multiplication, feel free to hit the DMs on Twitter or Ko-fi.\n\nOne of the few people on the wrestling internet whose opinion holds some real weight with me has repeatedly called this the 2022 Match of the Year.\n\nWhile I don’t totally agree (hard to look away from Sami/Knoxville, you know?), I totally understand the opinion.\n\nBecause the thing with AEW, so often, is that they almost get it. Although Cody Rhodes is gone by this point, something I noticed about AEW early on that I always associated with him, and that never totally left the company, is that it feels a lot like someone trying to bring in WCW ideals and concepts, except that that person is either so used to how things are or such a product of the WWE system that there’s always also some of that in the mix, as you can see with the way television has looked for so much of AEW’s history. So much of the company’s run has had this problem, the correct initial idea or even an admirable larger idea, but with one or two things off that always felt just a little bit incorrect.\n\nThis is one of the times that I think they came closest to getting it totally right.\n\nAs opposed to WCW filtered through a modern lens (thus making it phonier and worse), this — along with wrestling like Bryan/Dustin or Punk/Kingston in late 2021 — feels closer to the genuine article than almost anything.\n\nNot only in that it is a longer old-school style match, but in how it works and how it’s approached on a narrative level. Punk and Dustin, being two babyfaces, have to inch their way into something more heated and serious, on top of the double limbwork. There are moments here that are so often skipped over in other AEW tries at things like this without experts at the wheel, like when Punk almost doesn’t want to go after the hurt knee of Rhodes until he hits Punk’s own hurt arm when he pauses for a moment. Likewise, the care with which this is handled in terms of hierarchy, with Punk controlling despite being the central figure of the promotion at this point (who a lesser promotion might have working from underneath because of that), because he’s younger and better, is also handled with such a soft and accurate touch — giving him the hurt arm to make it a little murkier, as well as the way he works on top while never being unlikeable himself — that it’s almost hard to believe this is really AEW.\n\nOn top of that, in term of the simple pro wrestling of it, it’s also just so fucking great.\n\nThe various water-brained dullards of the world will point to an imperfect piledriver or Dustin being too big for the Bow & Arrow to work and act like this is slow old men having some bullshit throwback match, and while those are not the best moments in the world, the match is so much more than that.\n\nPunk and Dustin put on one of the great master classes of the decade. For that this lacks in total one hundred percent smoothness (although at least one of those moments finds itself working within the idea of the match, showing a way that Dustin’s length makes it harder on Punk and thus necessitates going further in with the attack on the leg), it makes up for in how brilliantly it’s put together. Not only in terms of the narrative worked, as talked about above, but simply in terms of pure mechanical construction. Everything that happens feels like it’s in the right place, but on top of that, so often, they come in new and interesting places as well, despite so much of this match being tried and true classical American pro wrestling. More in terms of when and how things happen as opposed to what happens, he way things build upon each other cannot help but stand out. For example, Punk trying a Figure Four for most of the middle of the match and taking something like ten minutes between the first try and finally getting it on right, or how in general, Punk has to not only hit the leg, but also outlast the older wrestler before he can totally go into the match that he wants to have.\n\nIt’s also up there with the greatest nerd bait matches of the 2020s (so far).\n\nDustin’s knee selling, as the main focus of the match, takes the cake. He sells it whenever possible, and always in ways that feel both novel — either because they haven’t been done in so long, like the knee giving out when he tries a slam, or because they are just truly not things most people think of, like a brief near collapse after stepping off the middle too quick coming from ten punches in the corner — but also that always feel real. Punk’s arm is not the focal point that Dustin’s knee is, by the design of the larger narrative of the younger wrestler being more successful at a similar approach, but like you expect from him, there are tons of these great and far more understated little moments in which he acknowledges that it’s this lingering pain, holding up his end of the bargain here yet again in showing that your time has not been even slightly wasted not only paying attention to all of this, but also in caring about all of this.\n\nIt does all of this, but without ever feeling like, although it is undoubtedly a match for nerds, a nerd bait match in the strictest sense. This is one of the great abilities of both men, something I appreciate so much, that they can insert moments where the knee of Rhodes buckles or where Punk has to shake his arm out, but without it ever having that feeling of artifice, that hidden flashing light saying “LOOK, I’M GOOD AT SELLING” overhead, attached to it.\n\nFor lack of a better word, like so much of this match, it’s just natural.\n\nDustin Rhodes escapes the GTS a second time, but this time, Punk is ready, and not only sits down on a sunset flip to win, but hooks real right on the bad leg to do so.\n\nAt the end, it’s beautiful stuff, in a way that stands out even more now than at the time.\n\nCM Punk, who would have fucking KILLED in that environment, and Dustin Rhodes have arguably the single most WCW match in the history of AEW, and to the surprise of hopefully nobody reading this, that also means it’s one of the very best things they’ve ever done. They have a match that hits on every level and in every way that smart professional wrestling ought to. This match builds and escalates perfectly, slowly but always steadily moving forward, and constantly rewarding everyone with the attention to never turn their eyes away, in something that a lot like some of Bret Hart’s better late career work, feels like — in a climate not particularly suited to things of this nature — a guide map forward on all that pro wrestling still can be, for those who care enough to put the time and the effort into every inch of the thing like these two did.\n\nIn addition to its value as one of the great taste barometers of the 2020s, an immediate way to figure out who knows ball for real and who doesn’t (people who hate this match are the Bag Twitter of wrestling), it is also simply this perfect representation of all that’s right, and all that still can be right.\n\nPro wrestling ass pro wrestling, in the truest sense, and God bless them all for it.\n\n***1/2\n\nCommissions continue again, this one coming from Ko-fi contributor Guthrie. You can be like them and pay me to write about all types of stuff. People tend to choose wrestling matches, but very little is entirely off the table, so long as I haven’t written about it before (and please, come prepared with a date or show name or something if it isn’t obvious). You can commission a piece of writing of your choosing by heading on over to www.ko-fi.com/elhijodelsimon. The current rate is $5/match or thing or $10 for anything over an hour, and if you have some aim that cannot be figured out through simple multiplication, feel free to hit the DMs on Twitter or Ko-fi.\n\nThis was the War Games match.\n\n1992 is often cited as WCW’s best year, if not the one with the highest ceiling, and while I get it, those peaks are very enticing to those who only look at peaks, I’ve also often disagreed even with that argument. The best Sting vs. Vader match was in 1993. The best World Title stuff, both in terms of feuds and matches, was in 1989. The best Tag Title/tag division work was, I think, in 1993 also, along with probably the best TV Title work too.\n\nWhere that becomes inarguable though is here, because as everyone who knows anything knows, 1992 is far and away the best War Games.\n\nThe superlatives don’t just stop there.\n\nNot just the greatest War Games match ever or probably the best match of 1992, but it’s in the running for the best WCW match ever, or at least the sort of match someone could tell me was their pick for that, and that I would have no real argument against outside of preference (I would “only” call it top five, or top ten at worst). Likewise, you could tell me you think this is the best match of all time, and while I wouldn’t agree, my strongest opposition is really just that I think it’s only one of the best matches ever.\n\nIt’s both a masterpiece of genuine feeling violence and a booking marvel.\n\nThe latter, I think, is easy to put a finger on, as everything that happens has some clear purpose or point within the context of WCW at this point. There are the obvious things, like opening with Barry vs. Austin to continue their feud over the TV Title, or Rick Rude going after the nose of Ricky Steamboat that he broke, or in a larger sense, the payoff to the Sting and Nikita tension that goes back nearly a full year, along with how the match finishes and where things go from there.\n\nFar more impressive in a larger sense is the way this works itself around the idea of War Games, in terms of why these things happen in a strategic sense, as more than any other WCW War Games save maybe the one the year prior, there’s a logic and strategy to the entrances that this match has always been capable of, but that was rarely explored otherwise.\n\nEspecially so, how it works with the idea often mentioned on commentary by ex-wrestlers that while Paul E. is a motivational genius and has an incredible brain for plots and schemes, his weakness is strategy, and in their biggest ever match, it’s that weakness that really costs them.\n\nBy sending Austin in first, it’s not only a boon for him — that traditionally being former TV Champion Arn Anderson’s spot and signaling some passing of the torch there — but also arguably the major mistake the Dangerous Alliance makes. In contrast, War Games veteran Barry has five minutes in a match he knows better. The DA sends their heaviest hitter in Rick Rude in next, which feels like another strategic error, as Steamboat is able to neutralize him for the majority of the match (complete with maybe the best psuedo hot tag run in War Games history), rather than backloading the match with the bigger guys like Our Heroes do with Sting and Nikita last. Arn and Larry, two more War Games veterans, come in and do effectively turn off the faucet, especially neutralizing the Dustin run when he comes in, but Eaton last lacks his usual firepower in a match like this, and when the powerhouses come in last, the Dangerous Alliance can’t do much against it, with Rude more worn out, and the others effectively tied up, giving Sting an easy path to victory when Larry and Eaton famously miscommunicate at the end and Larry injures Bobby’s arm with a missed shot with the disconnected steel ring cable.\n\nThe violence and the way it feels so much realer and nastier than in a lot of matches like this is something even cooler, and goes along with the performances in the match.\n\nEveryone in this match is great. Not everyone is on the level of a Steamboat or Dustin or Barry or Austin or Arn, there are some guys who excel more in this environment than others, and this match also asks more of some people than others. But even guys in more minor roles here, like Rude and Nikita and Eaton, are great whenever they’re on. Every shot thrown in this match looks awesome, the cage bumps are all sick as hell, guys are constantly finding new things to do (save for a weird run where like three new entries in a row fire off a DDT) and although this isn’t maybe the total bloodbath you may expect given praise like “best War Games ever”, the guys who do bleed (Austin and Dustin primarily) bleed so much that it covers up for everything else.\n\nLike a lot of great older matches in this vein, it is less so much the specifics of what happens as the feeling the match creates. In between things like Rude’s attack on the taped up nose of Ricky Steamboat and the blood of WCW’s theoretical young tentpoles of the 90s (fuck you, Hogan) and how it stains the ring and the bodies and gear of just about everyone who touches them, there’s a feeling of violence created that makes everything else come off even better and more dangerous. Effectively, while this match is always talked about in a certain way, this is the only time that from start to finish, it totally lived up to that reputation.\n\nEnhancing that, somewhat, was something that really stood out to me now on the fourth or fifth time seeing it, which was how this was filmed.\n\nNot necessarily in terms of blocking shots or catching everything, but more so in how neutral the camera was, it made it feel realer. There’s almost constantly something cool looking going on in the background once five people are in the cage, and while it might have been sick to have even more camera shots of one of the young guys dripping blood or close ups on what looked like awesome punch exchanges or Rude getting his head shoved in between the rings, I kind of like it. It’s WCW, of course, so I am not going to suggest it was intentional and claim genius when the answer is much more likely just that they did what they could with what they had, but there was a sort of genius to it. In so much of that existing in the background, not only did it add a rewatchability as well as a sense of chaos to the match, but it also made it all feel much realer, because naturally, a camera wouldn’t know where to constantly be if this wasn’t choreographed. It’s one of the greatest examples of a neutral camera in wrestling history, and just one more thing this match gets totally correct.\n\nThe only real problem with this match is the finish.\n\nEven then, with Sting putting on an Anderson style armbar on Eaton after Larry accidentally hits him with the steel rod, we’re still talking about something that’s good and that works (although that may have hit harder being done to Arn himself), and the problem is that it’s just not as great as the other twenty three or so minutes, and what holds this back from being maybe the actual best match of all time.\n\nThere’s just too much still to love.\n\nWar Games 1992 not only tells a perfect story — stop me if you’ve heard this before, but Paul E. fails as CEO because he cannot manage his assets correctly — but does it in such a striking and memorable way. The result is not only one of the coolest and best matches ever, but the creative high point of one of my favorite runs in wrestling history (early 1990s WCW), and a match that reveals more and more to me, both of itself and myself, every time I watch it.\n\nA monument to violence like little else from its time and place.\n\n****1/2\n\nAs a result of The Ordeal last weekend, I have still not fully regained my energy and drive to review wrestling from the year 2013. I put out seventeen this week, but I consider that below what I think you, The Reader, has perhaps come to expect from me. I typically aim for around twenty five, and often wind up with more. I simply did not have the motivation, and did not write a single word about 2013 wrestling until Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nAs such, I wanted to do something a little different as some kind of make good or a bonus.\n\nSome newer fans may not know about The Board. Using the elephant graveyard of an offshoot of a once prosperous 2000s message board, I began reviewing everything around 2009. By everything, I mean almost everything. WWF from 1984 through 2017. WCW from 1985 until the end (I am still doing this, currently watching 1997), and not just Nitros, Thunders, and pay per view, all of it. ECW from 1995 through the final fan cams in 2001. ROH, PWG, CHIKARA, Japanese wrestling since 1980, etc. It’s a little different than this blog, and that’s on purpose. Things are shorter there, as I review entire shows, and it’s more of a recap sort of style in regards to segments and sometimes matches. I definitely care more about this blog than the stuff on The Board. I’m not proud of all of it. You can chart my growth as a writer and as a human being from the last twelve years there. I’m definitely not proud of most things written before 2012 on a human level (people who were raised on 2000s forums didn’t know slurs were bad until then, sorry) and I’m not proud of most things written before 2014 or so on a writing level. But there’s a lot there. Not to toot my own horn (toot toot), but I think it’s a wholly unique resource, even if I would rather people trust the ratings they see on this fine blog rather than the ones from years and years back. Tastes evolve, etc.\n\nOne of the reviews that people I talk to regularly seem to really love is the one for the 1991 Great American Bash.\n\nIt’s a famously bad show, which I chose to write about and rate matches for using tragic events from my own life. I wrote this in the spring of 2018. My father passed away in August 2017. Not to spoil 2017 A YEAR IN LISTS or anything, but I genuinely do not remember anything that happened from my father’s funeral through mid December 2017. Early 2018 was the first time I ever really tried to actually process or deal with any of the many things that that’s going to stir up inside of a man. As you may have caught onto, writing has always been my creative outlet of choice, and it was through both a thing like this and getting back into current wrestling (my fucking luck, I get heavily into stuff and within a year, the indies basically get murdered) that I sort of found some kind of peace again. As anyone with the same experience will tell you, I don’t know if it’s a thing you ever entirely get over, so much as one that you learn to live with. Some days you don’t think about it. Sometimes you think about it a whole lot. There’s a happy medium somewhere in there that I’ve spent most of my time in since probably the second anniversary of his passing. It’s different for everyone though, I don’t know. Certainly do not take the advice of a man who self medicated to the point of completely forgetting three and a half months of his life.\n\nBut this review got a lot of things out there in a sort of joking way, and relating one of the worst and most ill-planned wrestling shows of all time to a series of personal traumas in my own life weirdly was incredibly helpful, and I think that if I was ever going to expose a larger audience to a full show review on here, this would be the show. It’s that or WrestleMania XXX, which may well be the second of these I ever do.\n\nConsider this something of an extended cut. Things added in. Some things changed and expanded upon for an audience that, for some reason?, does not know every single in and out of summer 1991 World Championship Wrestling booking. Embarrassing for you, I know.\n\nSo, without further delay. A treat for old readers. Perhaps a revelation for the new ones.\n\nThe 1991 Great American Bash.\n\nWCW GREAT AMERICAN BASH 1991\n\n7/14/1991\n\nBALTIMORE ARENA\n\nBALTIMORE, MARYLAND\n\nTo begin this, we should discuss the elephant in the room. Ric Flair is gone.\n\nIn the top story of the week, and in fact one of the top stories in wrestling history, Ric Flair was fired from WCW effective immediately when negotiations fell through. Flair’s contract was scheduled to be terminated as of 08/01, and Flair was scheduled to drop the WCW World title to Barry Windham on 7/1 in Macon, GA. Flair wasn’t actually expected to show up and do the job in that match, but if he did, then Windham would defend the title against Lex Luger at the Bash instead of Flair. Since Flair was on vacation and no-showed the title change, they officially stripped him of the title and announced that it would be Luger v. Windham for the vacant title at the Bash in Baltimore. This is actually the first time the title has not changed hands in the ring.\n\nThe original plan was for Flair to drop the title to Luger in Baltimore. WCW had been offering $350,000 per year, which would literally cut his salary in half. Flair wasn’t willing to take such a huge pay cut, and even more wasn’t willing to get paid less than Lex Luger. And since Luger was the highest-paid guy left, they had to make him champion to justify the pay. Flair’s role has been to put people over for the past two years, and it really killed his marketability, and now instead of getting rewarded at contract time he’s being punished with a cut-rate contract. WCW lost upwards of $6 million in 1990 and this is the end result.\n\nLast week, during negotiations, WCW went to Turner Home Entertainment pushing the idea of changing the PPV main event to Luger v. Windham. This seemed to be the end goal all along, since they were so severely underpushing the main event and focusing instead on guys like Johnny B Badd and PN News in the advertising. The belief is that Flair’s role after dropping the title was going to be putting over Dustin Rhodes all summer as revenge for getting Dusty Rhodes fired in 1988.\n\nAlso, WCW will need to get a new belt made since Flair owns the current one and has little reason to return it.\n\n– Wrestling Observer Newsletter, 7/1991\n\nOn July 8th, Flair was offered $750,000 to return, but since he was given no guarantee on how he’d be used, he wouldn’t take the deal. Also around this time, there’s a deal offered that would also give Flair the book back that he refused, because almost nobody with options REALLY wants to be in WCW at this point, except for Sting, I think.\n\nMATCH #1: BOBBY EATON & PN NEWS VS. STEVE AUSTIN & TERRY TAYLOR\n\nFollowing up on a nice little feud between perennial workhorse and recent fan favorite Bobby Eaton and promising-but-not-there-yet newcomer “Stunning” Steve Austin over the WCW World Television Title, with the upstart taking the title away from Our Hero not even two months into this long overdue reign that came off of an emotionally uplifting title win over longtime friend and rival Arn Anderson, this was a scaffold match.\n\nNo, I have no idea why the other two are involved in this, or why a title rematch wasn’t just in this position instead!\n\nIN ACTUALITY you can also win by taking a flag from the other team’s side and bringing it to your side, which is exactly what happens. This is not a scaffold match. This entire match is a fucking lie, just like most of this show. To lessen the sting, it’s not like this can disappoint anyone. BECAUSE SEE, THIS WASN’T EVEN FUCKING ADVERTISED?\n\nOH MAN THAT’S RIGHT\n\nAN UNANNOUNCED SCAFFOLD MATCH THAT ALSO ISN’T EVEN A SCAFFOLD MATCH\n\nYOU’D THINK THAT WOULD MAKE IT LESS UPSETTING, BUT SOMEHOW NO, IT MAKES IT WORSE!\n\nIt’s six minutes and obviously it’s terrible. Totally insane that two of the best workers on the show (Eaton and Taylor) and a pretty solid one (Austin) are hidden away in a match that basically prevents them from actually wrestling. Basically nothing happens as Bobby is the only one comfortable on it. Lots of guys on their hands and knees, crawling, and Eaton eventually gets the other team’s flag back to his end and he wins that way.\n\ngetting bantered into watching all of Friends for the first time and counting the number of vests in the show as a bit to amuse yourself and people in an internet chat and stopping when it gets to the point where you see someone in real fucking life wearing a vest and go “oh, that’s around ninety vests” now and realize you’re going insane and can’t recognize the difference between a mediocre sitcom from twenty years ago and the actual corporeal world you’re living in day to day\n\nAt commentary, JR and Tony say that Ric Flair has turned down another offer from WCW, as they try and turn it around to make people mad at Flair and not mad at the company (as fans at live events have already begun chanting for Flair).\n\nOn the stage, NEW INTERVIEWER ERIC BISCHOFF (genuinely his first show, UNBELIEVABLY on the nose and super perfect) is here with Arn Anderson and Paul E. Paul says there’s always a bottom line. He made a phone call and it’s not to one of the men Missy Hyatt sees behind Hervey’s back, and it’ll be the end of her in WCW. Rick Steiner can break him in half and if he had anyone else with him, it’d be over, but he will NEVER lay his hands on him because his partner is The Enforcer. Arn says if Steiner had things his way, he’d knock him out and have his way with Paul E. WRONG. If they lock them in a cage, and treat them like criminals, THEY WILL COMMIT CRIMINAL ACTS. Aggravated assault on Steiner. The invincibility went away when Scotty put that arm in a cast. Criminal’s what they’ll be and if Missy sticks her head in, he’ll make a real woman out of her.\n\nArn Anderson is one of the five best talkers in the history of professional wrestling (get me drunk enough and I’m willing to put him at #2 behind Punk), so this may just be the highlight of the show.\n\nJR and Tony kill more time as the scaffold is taken down. Obviously a tremendous decision to have that match.\n\nMATCH #2: THE Z MAN VS. THE DIAMOND STUDD W/ DIAMOND DALLAS PAGE\n\nThis sucked. Studd does his punches and shit and it’s not good yet. All of the pieces are there, ready to be molded and formed into the Razor Ramon act, but it’s raw material. They trade clotheslines a lot (A LOT) and Zenk really dumbs it down with way less flying and fast movement than usual. Tom Zenk can go on a medium to upper medium sort of level at this point, but you sure as shit are not seeing it here against The Diamond Stuff. Zenk brings in DDP when he tries to interfere and Zenk hits a TERRIBLE Superkick on him. One of the worst kicks I’ve ever seen, only to be topped in the next moment, when Studd hits a bridging Back Suplex for the win.\n\ndoing meth while watching hours of UNBEATABLE BANZUKE on G4 because you moved to a new state but can’t go to community college until you establish residency, which takes like six months\n\nMATCH #3: RON SIMMONS VS. OZ W/ THE GREAT WIZARD\n\nStunningly, this is also bad! This show sucks! My back hurts for some reason! People shout BORING almost constantly, because Nash isn’t good yet and is asked to do like five minutes of offense in this for some reason. Ron is good, but that’s not enough when Nash also sucks at bumping at this point. Literally cannot do anything. Ron comes back and he knocks Wizard off the apron and he wins with a diving shoulderblock.\n\nfalling asleep on a Metra line on the way back from Lollapalooza and waking up missing only one (1) of your shoes (red Chuck Taylors because I was dating a girl for a while who was super into Tennant era Doctor Who) and not both for some reason and spending the next ten plus years and counting thinking about what exactly someone needed with only one of your shoes\n\nTo kill more time, they air the WCW TOP 10. I don’t usually humor this because ROH fandom taught me how rarely gimmicked rankings mean anything, but holy shit look at where we’re at with this roster. I need you to experience the rot with me.\n\n10. Johnny B. Badd\n\n9. Ron Simmons\n\n8. Diamond Studd\n\n7. El Gigante\n\n6. Arn Anderson\n\n5. Bobby Eaton\n\n4. Steve Austin\n\n3. Sting\n\n2. Barry Windham\n\n1. Lex Luger\n\nHow is Nikita Koloff not ranked?\n\nWhy do I care?\n\nMATCH #4: ROBERT GIBSON VS. RICHARD MORTON W/ THE YORK FOUNDATION\n\nDefinitely a good idea. This goes seventeen minutes and nobody cares. Probably was a bad call burying them for most of 1990 and then doing nothing with Ricky as a singles and then blowing through their split angle, and then asking everyone to suddenly care. Morton spends the match working on Gibson’s bad knee and it’s also definitely not the match you’d expect. Works to get the Morton heel stuff over though, which is probably all this was ever intended for, so I guess it worked. Knee selling is good and he has a little comeback before York distracts the ref, and Morton uses the computer for the win. Definitely didn’t feel like Morton needed it to win, but heels need to cheat or something.\n\n**1/4! a real rating!\n\nriding to the train station after college graduation with via Uber with a driver who later goes on a shooting spree like two or three days later\n\nIn the back, Eric is with Dustin and the Young Pistols AND THEY’VE GOT SOME FUCKING PLATITUDES FOR YOUR BUTT. Tracy says these are three thoroughbred race horses ready to jump down your throat and they’re coming for a fight. Steve says this is the stip they’ve wanted for a long time (what? (For the record, Dustin hasn’t been in this at all)). Dustin says it’s the greatest night of his career (??!?!?!?!?!!?) and tonight, they’re gonna show them what six man tag team elimination is all about and you can tell ’em that, PALEES. What? God, I don’t know.\n\nMATCH #6: DUSTIN RHODES/THE YOUNG PISTOLS VS. THE FABULOUS FREEBIRDS/BADSTREET W/ BIG DADDY DINK\n\nThis was an elimination match.\n\nThis is honestly fine but it also goes too long. This is what happens when you produce the worst card in company history and stick talented guys in matches that can’t go long but still need to fill up close to three hours. They go like ten minutes before anything happens and it’s fine but also THEY HAVE BEEN RUNNING SOUTHERN BOYS VS. THE FREEBIRDS FOR 13 GOD DAMNED MONTHS NOW AND THEY RAN OUT OF STUFF TO DO IN THE SECOND OR THIRD MATCH TOGETHER. AND IT’S STILL GOING. WHY IS THERE A HEAD SHAPED HOLE IN MY DRYWALL? Armstrong is out first following a Double DDT from Hayes and Badstreet. Garvin is DQ’d for an over the top on Smothers and then Tracy is beat with another Double DDT. Dustin only needs a clothesline to beat Hayes and then the Bulldog beats Badstreet. Would complain about Super Dustin here before he starts to become an actual good wrestler near the end of the year, but he feels like a bigger star than any of the others and it’s only the Freebirds who have been fucking TOAST for at least two years despite the pus, so fuck it. I don’t care. You don’t care. Nobody could ever care about any of this.\n\ncoming into work drunk for a double, hiding in the dish room for the first shift because your cool work mentors want to help you not get fired, then getting a no-sleep hangover in the second shift and taking a thirty minute nap on the bottom layer of a rolling steel kitchen table, using a package of linens as a pillow\n\nOn the way to the ring for the next match, Yellow Dog says “Johnny don’t be good, Johnny be gay!”.\n\nCool!\n\nMATCH #6: YELLOW DOG VS. JOHNNY B. BADD W/ TEDDY LONG\n\nThis was a special BOUNTY MATCH.\n\nSee, Yellow Dog was Brian Pillman, who had lost a Loser Leaves Town match to Barry Windham months before and was doing a Midnight Rider deal. Except if it was lame and super weird. No, this absolutely doesn’t get wrapped up in any sort of satisfying way and Pillman never winds up getting any sort of revenge on Windham to end their otherwise tremendous long feud.\n\nThe match though?\n\nYou guessed it! It fucking sucks!\n\nDog at least loses the leotard top so Brian can show the boys off. This is six minutes and whatever. Pillman is good enough that it’s not the worst match on the show, but holy shit does Badd suck. Pillman does Pillman stuff and he hits the Crossbody but Long saves for the DQ, because we need to protect the shitty green kid working a sub-par gay panic gimmick who can’t even work a six minute match against a top five guy in the company. And he’s gonna stick around another four and a half years. Fucking sick.\n\nmedical debt you’ll never pay off from the time you almost died at the end of 2012\n\nIn the back, Eric goes into the locker room to interview Missy Hyatt. She’s in the shower so he should obviously go, BUUUUT Eric is also a pervert so he goes into the shower. He asks her about it and she is obviously screaming and mad at this shit. Eric apologizes to JR and Tony for his bad commentary, and they laugh it off. Cool! This show is so much fun! I’m not having a mental breakdown!\n\nMATCH #7: BIG JOSH VS. BLACK BLOOD\n\nThis match, between two wrestlers who have been largely absent from the television for weeks and weeks, was a lumberjack match.\n\nA guaranteed hit. Never been a bad lumberjack match. No sir.\n\nThis is absolutely horrible. Black Blood might be the worst wrestler employed by WCW. If not #1, he’s definitely in the running, although it’s an increasingly extensive list. Hey, wonder why this pay per view is so bad, and universally considered one of the five to ten worst major wrestling shows in the history of the business? That can’t be a part of it, not at all. In addition to how god damned abhorrent Black Blood is as a wrestler, it’s also a lumberjack match and those all suck. Matt Borne does what he can but the Big Josh gimmick is actually making him worse, like his skill has atrophied over the last six months. Two of the lumberjacks are also Dick Murdoch and Dick Slater aka THE HARDLINERS AKA THE TEAM THAT’S GOTTEN SQUASHES AND BEEN BUILT TOWARDS THE TAG TITLE FEUD FOR THE LAST MONTH\n\nMIGHT WANNA GIVE THEM A MATCH ON THE BIGGEST PPV OF THE YEAR INSTEAD OF THESE TWO WHO HAVEN’T MADE THE A SHOW IN LIKE A MONTH OR MORE.\n\nFUCK.\n\nDustin is there too and he stops Black Blood from using Josh’s axe handle because cheating is bad, so he then hits Black Blood with it and Josh covers to win. Fuck. Just god damnit man. Why? Why’d any of this happen? Why are you reading this? Why am I writing it?\n\nnot crying at your dad’s funeral but breaking down in a bus station when you hear the piano coda in “Layla” a few days later and still not being able to hear it without getting a little teary eyed. thanks for ruining GOODFELLAS and making CASINO the most rewatchable Marty movie by default. although tbh i think my dad’s favorite was GANGS OF NEW YORK for some reason. I don’t know. He’s dead, don’t be mad at him. the Bill the Butcher stuff is tremendous. Anyways, CASINO rules so much.\n\nMeanwhile, presented without context:\n\nMATCH #8: EL GIGANTE VS. ONE MAN GANG W/ KEVIN SULLIVAN\n\nWe are STRUGGLING. Six minutes on this one.\n\nIt’s all terrible. Gigante can’t move and OMG is old and fat. How is this longer than Gigante/Sid at SuperBrawl I in May was?! The little guys fight Kevin Sullivan on some Gullivers Travels shit. Gigante eventually wins with a claw hold.\n\nI have, in public, said many times that WCW is the best wrestling company to ever exist.\n\nWCW is also the worst wrestling company to ever exist.\n\nYou can be both.\n\nTNA has never harmed me spiritually like this, and I reviewed every single episode of TNA Impact to happen from the start through the end of 2010.\n\nDeep psychic trauma.\n\nSome of the worst vibes of all time.\n\nI can no longer have children.\n\nDating a girl who doesn’t know New Mexico is a state (she thinks it’s like New England) and then breaking up at a Halloween party where she meets her current fiancée where you’re in a hazmat suit because it was 2013 and Breaking Bad was a real big deal, so you decide to drink all the liquor in their fridge to punish everyone there, then walking two miles home at five in the morning, passing out in bed, waking up and drinking all day, then going to another party and sleeping with her friend in some act of petty vengeance for which you pretend to know what a log lady is, years before you ever will watch Twin Peaks, then drinking everything in her fridge, sending a text to your now ex about it, getting into a screaming match with log lady’s roommate, then going out and drinking more and passing out on a statue near the campus library still in the hazmat suit with a dick hole now torn in it because of the Log Lady deal and waking up Monday morning while people are walking to class\n\nHelpfully, there is a review of the Sting vs. Nikita Koloff feud. No, I don’t remember what it actually is. Watch the show yourself, you fucking brigand.\n\nMATCH #9: STING VS. NIKITA KOLOFF\n\nThis was a Russian Chain Match!\n\nThis is fun enough! I don’t hate it or anything, it’s probably the one match on this show that just exists as a normal professional wrestling match, unimpeded by too much bullshit (there is always a little bit of bullshit) and just allowed to exist as something sort of normal.\n\nOf course, it’s helped a lot by taking place on one of the worst wrestling shows ever. I still hate the touching four corners type of thing, a lot of people just can’t handle it, but Sting and Nikita have a pretty natural chemistry together. They have a really similar style where they’re both very basic wrestlers but have something sort of primal and real in that old JCP style within them that makes it all click. It’s a shame they never got to really explore that in a BIG match. They also had a really good match on a Clash of the Champions to set this oone up, but stopped short of the mark, and this is hampered by the stip and also feels very much like the second match in a three match series, as Sting is out of his element and dominated, at first physically and then mentally when he’s in a foreign match type that Nikita knows inside and out. We just don’t really get the third one! Cool! Four corner touching is the best they can do. They get tied at three and Sting tries to dive over Nikita for the last one and it drives Nikita backwards and he hits first, SO NIKITA WINS IT YEAH! Great bit that they wound up stealing for JBL’s title win over Eddie Guerrero in 2004.\n\nIf someone had to watch one match on this show (THEY DON’T. DO NOT TURN THIS SHOW ON.), this is the one, I GUESS.\n\n**1/2\n\nting is mad about it and he beats up Nikita with the chain post-match.\n\nAND FOR SOME REASON, THE WORLD TITLE MATCH IS NEXT, SO WE’RE GONNA MAIN EVENT THE BIGGEST SHOW OF THE YEAR WITH A FUCKING ANNOUNCERS MATCH.\n\nThey air that half baked hype video that doesn’t go into the immense history between Lex Luger and Barry Windham so FUCK YOU, I WILL.\n\nThese are two guys who formed a super team in 1988, who finally took the Tag Titles away from the Four Horsemen and combined with Sting, seemed poised to finally end Flair, Arn, and Tully’s stranglehold on the top spots, until Barry Windham took the easy way out and turned on Lex to not only join the Horsemen but to hand the Tag Titles back to them. At the time, it made sense because he was more advanced than Sting or Luger because of his background and it led him to the US Title and it put the Four Horsemen back on top. It’s the same thing Lex Luger himself did in 1987, except Barry was better at it, even eclipsing Ric Flair’s ability in 1988 to a number of fans,. Barry didn’t lose the title to Dusty like Lex did, and it was after the loss to Barry that Dusty spiraled downward and he was gone within six months. Meanwhile, Lex was never able to beat Ric Flair in 1988. At first it seemed like luck, but he failed at Starrcade too, while Barry finally came into the potential he had had for years. In 1989, Lex beat Barry Windham for the US Title. He did it when Barry suffered a fluke hand injury, and Barry never got a rematch, as he left within a month of losing the title to again take the easy road and go for more money to the same place Arn and Tully did. Lex became an even better US Champion than Barry did, and since that match, basically had a stranglehold on the title, holding it for the majority of the last two and a half years. He improved and dabbled in the dark side, but he stopped taking the easy way out in 1990 to help his friend Sting, and he looked like he finally might be able to beat Ric Flair, but Barry Windham’s return is one of the things that helped stop that.\n\nThey largely stayed apart since then, but now they finally have to meet again. This time, it’s for the World Heavyweight Title. Barry Windham held himself back from the World Title for the last three years and change, but in order to do it, he has to face the man he originally turned on when he sought the easy way to the top, and the man who beat him for the title he still holds. Lex Luger has been trying for the title since the end of 1987, but he never put it together. Be it the luck of Ric Flair or his own lack of experience or even the Horsemen as an entity, he just hasn’t been able to do it. Barry’s still a better technician than Lex, he’s still more naturally gifted, and he spent years as the de-facto heir to Flair’s throne. Can Lex Luger finally come through, or will Barry FINALLY fulfill his destiny? It’s a nearly perfect story, that makes a compelling case for either man and wraps up years of history of WCW’s past into something that’s actually a lot more interesting than Flair/Luger for the sixth time on pay per view.\n\nSo naturally, WCW doesn’t bother to tell it.\n\nThe crowd chants “WE WANT FLAIR” while Tony and JR sort of talk about it in vague terms. Even during the entrances, WCW production is dumb/rogue enough to get close ups of front row fans chanting it. They also misspell Barry’s name on the graphics which isn’t a direct spoiler, but definitely feel like they wouldn’t do that to the new champ.\n\nTHEN AGAIN, WHO FUCKING KNOWS THIS IS THE WORST (MAJOR) WRESTLING SHOW I’VE EVER SEEN\n\nMATCH #10: BARRY WINDHAM VS. LEX LUGER\n\nThis was a steel cage match for the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Title.\n\nThese two had a surprisingly great match two and a half years earlier at the famous Chi Town Rumble. This is not that match. Obviously, the crowd hurts and they didn’t have the time to build up any real animosity here, but something feels real off to this in general. They work hard and Barry throws some real great shots, and they do big things off the top, but it just never comes together.\n\nObviously, this is missing the major thing that made the 1989 match work for me, which is to say the hand work handwerk, but even then, it just is not here. It falls apart for different reasons (Barry is in less great shape and the WWF broke him to some extent and he hasn’t totally recovered, while Lex no longer needs to try as hard since he’s the highest paid guy in the fed now). They do that sort of thing where it feels like they skip from the opening bits to a finishing run without the middle part that justifies them selling such exhaustion after only like five or ten minutes. Real modern WWE sort of problem to have, so it’s at least ahead of its time.\n\nMr. Hughes comes out to distract Barry, AND HARLEY RACE SHOWS UP WHOA. HE TELLS LEX THAT NOW IS THE TIME AND LEX KNEES THE DISTRACTED BARRY. LEX USES THE PILEDRIVER NOW AND HE FINALLY WINS THE TITLE. Could have had a lot more gravitas, but definitely the second best match on this show on account of being a functional professional wrestling match between two good professional wrestlers.\n\n**1/2\n\nWish that wasn’t in a cage so they could have told the story better, but they had advertised cage matches already. Lex Luger quickly leaves with Race and Hughes behind him. There’s something really fantastic about how now that their paths have crossed once again, Lex Luger has finally learned and he uses a shortcut and outside help to finally win the World Heavyweight Title. This sets up an obvious run where Barry now tries to do things the right way and he finally wins the World Title, except that that never happened and they went in some other baffling directions instead and there is a seven and a half month Lex Luger heel title run that is almost entirely horrible.\n\nBefore the main event, the Hardliners come and drag Missy Hyatt to the back, to make it a handicap match. The athletic commission wouldn’t let an intergender match happen so this had to happen. SO, FUCKING JESUS CHRIST, NOT ONLY DID THEY PROMOTE IT FOR WEEKS PROBABLY KNOWING TH — NO, ACTUALLY, THE MORE WCW THING IS THAT THEY DIDN’T BOTHER TO CHECK WITH THE ATHLETIC COMMISSION BEFOREHAND AND THIS WAS SPRUNG ON THEM AT THE BUILDING, AND THEY RAN THIS BULLSHIT.\n\nBUT HAVING DONE THAT, THEY STILL WENT AHEAD AND MADE IT THE MAIN EVENT?!\n\nKILL YOURSELF\n\nAND EVERYONE AROUND YOU\n\nMATCH #11: RICK STEINER VS. ARN ANDERSON/PAUL E. DANGEROUSLY\n\nThis was a steel cage match, as if it or anything else in the world could ever matter.\n\nIT’S TWO MINUTES. THE MAIN EVENT OF THE BIGGEST SHOW OF THE YEAR (BECAUSE FUCKING REAL TALK, STARRCADE HASN’T BEEN THE BIGGEST SHOW OF THE YEAR SINCE LIKE 1988 AND BEFORE THAT 1985, GAB HAS BEEN *THE* SHOW FOR A WHILE NOW) IS TWO MINUTES. RICK DOES STUFF. ARN GETS A KNEE TO THE BACK IN AND OTHERWISE NADA. RICK SLAMS ARN AND STEINERLINES PAUL E. TO WIN. THERE WAS NOTHING GOING ON BETWEEN THE STEINERS AND PAUL E IN THE FIRST GOD DAMNED PLACE, SO WHO GIVES A SHIT?\n\nI AM GOING TO MURDER JIM HERD ONE DAY\n\nThe production was terrible as usual, and while there’s some WWE pay per views that are on this level of bad (Great American Bash 2004, December 2 Dismember, maybe others), there’s at least kind of a general professionalism to all of it that’s just absent here. And there’s bad ECW shows and bad CZW shows and the like, but those have kind of a charm to them that this absolutely doesn’t have. This show has no charm and multiple really terrible matches. There’s stipulations that have no reason to exist (all of them!), a crowd that clearly hates the only major thing that happened, people wasted up and down the card, several matches highlighting people who are in no way ready for a pay per view stage, and one of the more baffling line ups ever. Title match makes sense along with Studd/Z Man and the RNRX match, but otherwise, this is not what’s presented on television. \\\n\nYour major feuds are Steiners/Hardliners, Yellow Dog’s Bounty, Austin/Eaton, Dustin/Terry Taylor, Badd/PN News, etc. and almost none of that is reflected. Multiple great wrestlers are put in matches that offer them zero chance to show that off (Pillman, Eaton, Taylor, Arn, Rick Steiner) or to save a show that badly needed it. I don’t know if this is the worst show of all time on a match by match basis. I don’t want to go through things and find out. It could be. I wouldn’t argue it if someone disagreed, a lot of bad wrestling shows have happened, but as a whole production, it might be. Fuck, it might be.\n\nNobody knows what the hell is going on, there’s no quality control, there might not be any direction in the company at all. WCW is in complete free fall right now, and as horrifying at it is, it’s the most exciting that this company’s been in like a year and a half.\n\nOne of the worst wrestling shows of all time, one of the most fascinating pay per views of all time, and a special sort of hell that any sort of intrepid traveler must traverse at least once in their lives.\n\nThe sort of deep mental trauma that can only be solved by watching the ending of Game 7 of the 2016 World Series in different formats and set to different songs for an hour or so, maybe capping it off with the last two or three minutes of “The Job” or a nice Community episode. Psychic trauma is only solved through psychic balm.\n\neven transporting this from The Board was traumatic in its own way. I hope you enjoyed this brief respite from the 2013 coverage. I did not. This is the blog version of Chris Benoit doing 20,00 squats as self flagellation for running the ropes weird on a house show.\n\nBy the time you read this, I will be tending bar in the middle of a polar vortex and ideally serving zero (0) people and just watching mediocre ESPN talking head shows all day.\n\nAs a Catholic, I know the truth, which is that not only is God real, but that he deeply despises every single one of us.\n\nAfter taking at a glance at this show again, I completely understand why.\n\nPeace be with you."
