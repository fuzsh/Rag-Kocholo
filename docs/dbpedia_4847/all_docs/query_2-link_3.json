        "text": "One of the great Hispanic wrestlers, Eddie Guerrero grew up part of the famous wrestling family: The Guerreros. His father Gory Guerrero became a star in the U.S., an icon in Texas and a legend in Mexico. Eddie's brothers, Hector, Amadno and Chavo, Sr. also became wrestlers. Both Hector and Amando gain success, but only in the Indie federations, and not much success as their father or other two brothers had gained in the majors. Eddie's nephew, Chavo Guerro, Jr., son of Chavo, Sr., also became a wrestler (Chavo, Jr. was only three years younger than his uncle). Eddie was also uncle of Enrique Llanes and cousin of Javier Llanes, who are popular wrestlers in Mexico.\n\nEddie had wrestling since the 1989. He really made his name in the now-defunct ECW (Extreme championship Wrestling) by winning the ECW Ecxtreme Championship Wrerstling) TV Title against Dean Simon (aka Dean Malenko). Eddie also made his name later that year in now-defunct WCW (World Championship Wrestling) to win the Cruiserweight Championship by defeating Chris Jericho. Also while in the company, he formed Latino World Order (A playoff to Hulk Hogan's (Hollywood Hogan at the time)stable, New World Order).\n\nThe stable included popular Latino wrestler Rey Mysterio, Jr. (Oscar Gutierrez), La Parka (Adolfo Tapia Ibarra), Psychosis (Dionicio Castellanos) and Juventud Guerrera (Eduardo Annibal Gonzalez Hernandez).\n\nWhen Eddie came to the WWE, he was a heel, and immediately gained fame when he was part of the Radicalz, with Perry Saturn, Dean Malenko and long time friend of fifteen years, Chris Benoit. In recent years, he and and his nephew Chavo, Jr. began a tag team called Los Guerreros and won the WWE Tag Team titles on Smackdown! against Team Angle (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin). After this stint, Eddie Guerrero went on to win the WWE Championhip (His first and only time) at No Way Out in 2004 against Brock Lesnar. He lost the title to John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield four months later at the Great American Bash in a Texas Bull Rope Match.\n\nRecently, wrestling fans and the people of the WWE mourn of the lost of Eddie when he was found by his nephew, Chavo Jr. (who back then known as Kerwin White) on a Sunday morning in November, 2005. The result of his death was most likely been caused by his problems in the past: Drugs and alcohol.\n\nDwayne Douglas Johnson, also known as The Rock, was born on May 2, 1972 in Hayward, California. He is the son of Ata Johnson (born Feagaimaleata Fitisemanu) and professional wrestler Rocky Johnson (born Wayde Douglas Bowles). His father, from Amherst, Nova Scotia, Canada, is black (of Black Nova Scotian descent), and his mother is of Samoan background (her own father was Peter Fanene Maivia, also a professional wrestler). While growing up, Dwayne traveled around a lot with his parents and watched his father perform in the ring. During his high school years, Dwayne began playing football and he soon received a full scholarship from the University of Miami, where he had tremendous success as a football player. In 1995, Dwayne suffered a back injury which cost him a place in the NFL. He then signed a three-year deal with the Canadian League but left after a year to pursue a career in wrestling.\n\nHe made his wrestling debut in the USWA under the name Flex Kavanah where he won the tag team championship with Brett Sawyer. In 1996, Dwayne joined the WWE and became Rocky Maivia where he joined a group known as \"The Nation of Domination\" and turned heel. Rocky eventually took over leadership of the \"Nation\" and began taking the persona of The Rock. After the \"Nation\" split, The Rock joined another elite group of wrestlers known as the \"Corporation\" and began a memorable feud with Steve Austin. Soon the Rock was kicked out of the \"Corporation\". He turned face and became known as \"The Peoples Champion\". In 2000, the Rock took time off from WWE to film his appearance in Die Mumie kehrt zurück (2001). He returned in 2001 during the WCW/ECW invasion where he joined a team of WWE wrestlers at The Scorpion King (2002), a prequel to Die Mumie kehrt zurück (2001).\n\nDwayne has a daughter, Simone Alexandra Johnson, born in 2001, with his ex-wife Dany Garcia, and daughters, Jasmine, born in 2015, and Tiana Gia, born in 2018, with his wife, singer and songwriter Lauren Hashian.\n\nAmerican-born, Canadian-raised professional wrestler, rock singer, actor and author.

He also wrestled for Canadian Rocky Mountain Wrestling, CMLL, UWA and AAA in Mexico, and WAR in Japan before arriving in the U.S. as part of the team the Thrillseekers (renamed from Sudden Impact) with Lance Storm in James E. Cornette's Smoky Mountain Wrestling promotion. He arrived in ECW in February 1996 and feuded with Pit Bull #2 (Anthony Durante) over the ECW World Television Title. Arrived in WCW in August 1996 and eventually made his home in the Cruiserweight Division, winning the title five times. Turned heel at the end of 1997, essentially solidifying his persona for years to come. Went to WWE in 1999, and would become one of the most decorated wrestlers in the company's history. Outside of wrestling, he has been leading his heavy metal band Fozzy since 1999, published three autobiographies (2007's \"A Lion's Tale: Around the World in Spandex\" [covering his career right up to his WWE debut]; 2011's \"Undisputed: How to Become the World Champion in 1,372 Easy Steps\"; and 2014's \"Best In The World...At What I Have No Idea.\"), and has done stage acting and hosted a radio show as well as other pursuits. Among his in-ring achievements, he is a former WWE World Heavyweight Champion, an 8x WWE Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion, a former 5x WWE World Tag Team Champion, a former 2x WWE Tag Team Champion, a former WWE European Heavyweight Champion, a former WWE Hardcore Champion, a former ECW World Television Champion, a former WCW World Television Champion, and was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nAllen Neal Jones best known by the ring name AJ Styles is an American professional wrestler currently signed to WWE. Long regarded as one of the best wrestlers in the world, Styles has headlined numerous pay-per-view events internationally.\n\nStyles debuted in 1998 and competed for various independent promotions, before gaining his first mainstream exposure in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 2001. He became widely known for his tenure in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) from 2002-2013, where he was dubbed \"Mr. TNA\". While in TNA, Styles held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship three times and the TNA World Heavyweight Championship twice. He was also the inaugural titleholder of the X Division Championship, which he won six times. Styles is the first professional wrestler ever to complete the TNA Triple Crown (five times) and the TNA Grand Slam (two times).\n\nIn 2010, Styles became the first ever TNA-contracted wrestler to be ranked number one on the annual Pro Wrestling Illustrated (PWI) PWI 500 list. He simultaneously appeared in Ring of Honor (ROH) from 2002-2006, where he became the first ROH Pure Champion. In 2014, Styles signed with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) and won his first of two IWGP Heavyweight Championships in his debut match, later becoming the third leader of the Bullet Club. Styles has also won various titles on international independent circuits, including the PWG World Championship.\n\nStyles first appeared in WWE (then the World Wrestling Federation, or the WWF) in 2002, but turned down a developmental contract he was offered with the company. He signed a multi-year contract with WWE fourteen years later in January 2016, making his re-debut that month and going on to win the WWE Championship in September. Both PWI and the Wrestling Observer Newsletter (WON) voted him Wrestler of the Year for 2016. With his second WWE Championship victory in Manchester, England in November 2017, Styles was recognized by WWE as the first wrestler to win the title outside of North America. Also that year, he was inducted into the WON Hall of Fame.\n\nCurt Hennig was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as the son of one of wrestlings all time legends - Larry Hennig - Aka Larry The Ax Hennig. Curtbegan training to follow in his fathers footsteps when he was just 12 years old. Starting off in the AWA - Curt began his career as a tag team wrestler. He won the AWA Tag Team Championship with Scott Hall before concentrating on a singles career in the AWA. He became the AWA Heavyweight Champion in only his second year with the company before capturing the attention of the WWF. The WWF was looking to acquire the services of second generation stars and Curt Hennig fitted the bill perfectly. He made his debut in the WWF in 1988 as \"MR.PERFECT\". Curt's character was an instant hit with WWF fans and he quickly established himself as a quality technical wrestler. Fellow second generation WWF star and one of Curt's closest friends - Bret Hart aka Bret The Hitman Hart was also making waves in the WWF along the same time. Bret Hart and Curt Hennig began a legendary feud that would end in an Intercontinental Championship match at SummerSlam in 1992. Curt Hennig defended his WWF Intercontinental Title against Bret Hart at SummerSlam to end what had become a captivating feud between two of the best technical wrestlers in WWF history. However, Curt had suffered a serious back injury during a house show just prior to the big event. Against doctors orders, Curt Hennig made his way to the ring as Mr.Perfect and defended his Intercontinental Title at SummerSlam against the Hitman Bret Hart. Bret went on to win the match but was full of praise for his friend and opponent afterwards. Hart called Hennig \"the best wrestler and one of the best workers he had ever worked with\". Despite being praised for working a high profile match through a serious injury - Curt ended up paying a price. Curt's back injury had been aggravated and that caused him major problems in the future. After taking a few months of to rest his injury, Curt returned to the WWF, however his return was short lived as his back once again flared up in late 1993. As a result, Curt was out of the ring until 1996. During that period, Curt worked as a commentator for the WWF until his contract expired at the end of 1995. By this time, Curt's back had healed enough for him to consider a return to a WWF or WCW ring. Understanding the importance of having an Impact Player like Curt Hennig on their roster, WCW got involved in a bidding war for Mr.Perfect's services. In the end, WCW won and Curt Hennig signed a 4 year contract with WCW. Hennig returned to the ring for the first time in 3 years and in only his second official singles match since his return - Curt won the WCW United States Championship. He held the title on three separate occasions along with the WCW Tag Team Championship. However, his talents were being wasted in WCW and at the end of his contract in 2000, Curt decided against signing an extention with the company and proceeded to take a break from the sport altogether. In 2001, he returned to the ring with XWF and made appearances in Australia with the WWA. While these appearances were good enough as a stop-gap measure, Curt was hoping to make a comeback in the World Wrestling Federation - and sure enough the WWF contacted Curt Hennig to make his return to the WWF as Mr.Perfect in the 2002 Royal Rumble. What was initially billed as a one time arrangement, resulted in Curt Hennig once again re-joining the WWF after signing a long term contract. While Curt may have claimed to be perfect inside the ring, his life outside the ring was anything but perfect. In May 2002,he was fired by Vince McMahon after getting into a fight with Brock Lesnar on a charter flight. On February 10, 2003, he was found dead in a Tampa hotel. He was slated to wrestle on an independent card headed by Jimmy Hart at the Florida State Fair. The cause of death was later found to be acute cocaine intoxication. He left behind his wife of 20 years, Leonice, and four children.\n\nScott Steiner has been a mainstay in professional wrestling for over 15 years. When he started out in the business, he was a singles wrestler, wrestling in some smaller federations before coming to the NWA (WCW) to team with his older brother, Rick. It was at this time that Steiner became world famous as one half of the greatest tag team of the 1990's. The two brothers wreaked havoc on anyone who dared get in the ring with them. Known for their amazing wrestling arsenal of suplexes, the two won the WCW tag team titles on many occasions throughout a ten year time period. Steiner, especially, bacame well-schooled in the art of the suplex, as he would use many varieties of this devastating wrestling move to render his foes senseless. He also invented the Frankensteiner, a wrestling move that involves jumping up onto your opponents shoulders from their front, letting your body fall upside-down so you head is between their legs, and then using your stomach and leg muscles to power them forward onto the mat. This move was perfected by Steiner, who could perform the maneuver from a standing position, while his opponent was running at him, or to an opponent sitting on the top rope.\n\nAfter several years in WCW, which saw him win his first singles title (WCW TV title) in a brief singles push for a couple of months, The Steiner brothers went off to the WWF in early 1993. For the next year, the two continued their assault on every tag team in their path, winning the WWF Tag Team titles on two occasions before leaving in early 1994.\n\nThe next stop for the tag team tandem was Japan, where the two continued to prove why they were the best in the business. When WCW came calling in 1996, the Steiner Brothers headed back home. Once again they became the best tag team in WCW's ranks, taking on famous tag teams like Harlem Heat, the Road Warriors, and the Outsiders. They became a huge force in WCW against the nWo uprising in 1996-97. Their feud with The Outsiders (Scott Hall & Kevin Nash) in 1997 saw the tag team belts change hands between the two several times.\n\nBy early 1998, Scott did not even resemble the Steiner of old. He had cut his hair short (it had always been shoulder length), had beefed up his always-impressive physique even more to look like a bodybuilder, and had grown quite a mean streak. Even with his changing appearance, fans were still completely shocked when he turned on his brother at WCW's Superbrawl VIII pay-per view in February of 1998. Steiner joined the ranks of the nWo and became one of its lead men, taking on the moniker \"Big Poppa Pump\". He spent most of the year feuding with his brother and helping the nWo in their war against the newly formed Wolfpack.\n\nBy early 1999, the nWo had joined with the Wolfpack and WCW was in disarray. Steiner did not let this chaos get to him, as he won the TV and the US titles in the first couple months of the year. He also reunited with his brother in the summer of that year, as the he and Rick held the US and TV titles, respectively. By 2000, Steiner was a main event star who was on his way to win the World Title. He did just that in the fall of that year, defeated Booker T to become the World Heavyweight Champion. He took on all comers in his four-month title reign and became one of the most dominant WCW Champions in history before WCW folded and was bought out by the WWF in March of 2003. He lost the WCW Title to Booker T on the very last edition of WCW Nitro. Steiner decided to take things easy for a while to recover from some back problems that he had been having, along with a severe nerve problem in his left leg. He did wrestle several times for the internation-touring WWA, winning their version of the Championship. He finally showed up in WWE in fall of 2002, immediately getting into a feud with then-champion HHH. After headlining two straight pay-per-views in early 2003, Steiner began a partnership and then a feud with fellow WWE superstar Test. This lasted for most of the year. He again was forced to take some time off from action due to a groin injury. He has yet to return to action as of April 2004, but knowing Steiner, he will return with a vengeance, so watch out.\n\nRetired American professional wrestler best known for his work for ECW and WCW during the 1990s. He is the son of the late wrestling legend Boris Malenko. He debuted in Florida in 1979 and proceeded to work all over the world, particularly in Japan. He teamed with his brother Joe for years. He also worked as a referee, including on the January 4, 1986 (taped December 19, 1985) \"WWF Saturday Night's Main Event.\" While wrestling in the Junior Heavyweight division for New Japan Pro Wrestling, became part of the \"Holy Trinity\" or \"New Japan 3\" with Chris Benoit and Eddie Guerrero and they would go on to have numerous matches for several promotions either as teammates or as opponents. Malenko arrived in ECW in 1994 as a heel. He defeated 2 Cold Scorpio (Charles Scaggs) for the ECW World Television Title in November and held it until Scorpio regained it in March 1995. Malenko defeated Eddie Guerrero for the belt and held it for a week in July 1995. Malenko, Benoit and Shane Douglas formed the Triple Threat at the start of 1995. Malenko and Benoit defeated Sabu (Terry Brunk) and the Tazmaniac (Peter Senerchia) for the ECW World Tag Team Titles in February 1995 at \"ECW Return of the Funker\" and held them until the Public Enemy (Johnny Grunge (Mike Durham) and Flyboy Rocco Rock (Ted Petty) defeated them and the Tazmaniac and Rick Steiner (substituting for Sabu, who had left the company) at \"ECW The Three Way Dance\" on April 8th. Malenko, Guerrero and Benoit left for WCW in September 1995, with ECW announcer Joey Styles explaining that it was due to something in their contracts with New Japan, which had a working relationship with WCW. He made his home in the Cruiserweight Division, and became known as \"The Man of a 1000 Holds\" and \"The Iceman\" for his stoic nature. At \"WCW Uncensored\" in March 1997, he defeated Guerrero for the WCW United States Heavyweight Title and held it until Jeff Jarrett defeated him in June. At \"WCW Uncensored\" in March 1998, WCW World Cruiserweight Champion Chris Jericho defeated Malenko. Mean Gene Okerlund asked Malenko what he was going to do, and he said he was going \"home.\" Malenko promptly disappeared from TV with no word being given as to where he was and what he was doing. This led to a series of hilarious promos by Chris Jericho, including the \"1004 Holds\" one. At \"WCW Slamboree\" in May 1998, there was a Cruiserweight battle royal where the winner would get a shot at Jericho's title. The match came down to Juventud Guerrera (Eduardo Hernández) and Ciclope, which was surprising since Ciclope was one of WCW's less successful luchadores. Ciclope and Juvi shook hands, and Juvi promptly eliminated himself. \"Ciclope\" unmasked to reveal Malenko. Malenko proceeded to defeat Jericho for the title. Later that summer, Malenko started asking Arn Anderson about reforming the Four Horsemen, who had been disbanded since the NWO (Kevin Nash/Syxx (Sean Waltman)/Buff Bagwell (Marcus Bagwell)/Konnan (Charles Ashenoff)) had defeated them in the War Games match at \"WCW Fall Brawl 1997: War Games\" via Curt Hennig turning heel and slamming the cage door on Ric Flair's head while Benoit and Steve \"Mongo\" McMichael (Steve McMichael) were handcuffed to the cage. This was during the time that Flair was off of TV due to WCW boss Eric Bischoff suing him. On the September 14, 1998 \"WCW Monday Nitro,\" the Four Horsemen returned. Arn Anderson and former Horsemen manager James J. Dillon brought out Benoit, Malenko, McMichael and the returning Flair to the ring. This led to another feud with the NWO. At \"WCW Uncensored\" in March 1999, Benoit and Malenko defeated Curt Hennig and Barry Windham for the WCW World Tag Team Titles. They held the belts for two weeks, losing them to Rey Misterio Jr. and Billy Kidman on the March 29, 1999 \"WCW Monday Nitro.\" The Horsemen broke up once and for all in the Spring. Benoit, Malenko, Perry Saturn and Shane Douglas, making his surprise return to WCW after six years, formed the Revolution out of frustration with how they were treated by the company and how the older main eventers (Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, Randy Savage, etc.) got everything they wanted. The group ended at \"WCW Souled Out 2000,\" as Benoit, Malenko, Saturn and Guerrero left for WWE. Their group was named the Radicals. Malenko defeated Essa Rios (Jose Seldano) for the WWF World Light Heavyweight Title on the March 13, 2000 \"WWF Monday Night Raw\" and held it until Scotty 2 Hotty (Scott Taylor) defeated him on the April 17th \"Raw.\" Malenko regained the title on the April 27th \"WWF SmackDown!\" and held it until losing it to Crash Holly (Michael Lockwood) on the March 13, 2001 \"WWF Sunday Night Heat.\" On the May 22, 2000 \"Raw,\" the Radicals (Dean Malenko and Perry Saturn) faced the Godfather (Charles Wright) and Essa Rios. During the Godfather's usual pre-match spiel, he mentioned Dean being \"the Man of 1000 Holds\" and that his hos knew \"1000 positions\" and that Dean could have any two hos he wanted. This led to Malenko adopting a new gimmick as a James Bond-styled ladies' man. This led to Malenko pursuing Lita (Amy Dumas), and a feud between the Radicals and Team Xtreme (The Hardy Boyz (Matt Hardy) and Jeff Hardy) and Lita), which would be Malenko's last feud before he retired in 2001. He has worked as a road agent for WWE ever since."
