        "text": "SPECIAL NOTE: The Mid-Atlantic title was originally called the Eastern Heavyweight title, which came into existence in 1970. The name was changed to Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight title (and a new belt presented) in October of 1973. Crockett Promotions recognized all Eastern title holders as former Mid-Atlantic champions. We will include former Eastern title reigns in the total number of Mid-Atlantic title reigns accordingly.\n\n1970s | 1980s | Eastern Title | Mid-Atlantic Title\n\nPat O'Connor\n\nFirst Recognized Eastern Heavyweight Champion\n\nA GATEWAY EXCLUSIVE\n\nAs part of the storyline to introduce the Eastern heavyweight title to the Mid-Atlantic territory, it was announced that Pat O'Connor was the reigning Eastern Heavyweight Champion. This was established both on television and in newspaper clippings. This is generally considered to be a fictitious title reign.\n\nNEWSPAPER CLIPPING\n\nMissouri Mauler (Larry Hamilton)\n\n10/13/70 - Announced on TV (Air Date 10/17/70) that Mauler won the Eastern Heavyweight title from Pat O'Connor in New York\n\nMauler's first match back for Crockett in 1970 was on 10/12/70 in Charlotte NC. At WGHP TV studios on the following day 10/13/70, Mauler makes the announcement that he defeated O'Connor for the Eastern title in New York. The earliest reference to an Eastern title match we've found is in Lexington NC on 10/17/70 vs. Al Torres.\n\nO'Connor's reign as champion, and this title change, are generally accepted to be fictional for the purposes of creating and establishing the title. A newspaper reference in January 1971 to O'Connor holding the title, and Mauler defeating him for the title, can be found here:\n\nNEWSPAPER CLIPPING\n\nDanny Miller\n\n7/15/71 Greensboro Coliseum, Greensboro, NC\n\nNEWSPAPER AD & RESULT\n\nMissouri Mauler (2)\n\n9/20/71 Charlotte Park Center, Charlotte, NC\n\nNEWSPAPER ARTICLE, AD, AND RESULT\n\nJack Brisco\n\n11/30/71 WGHP TV Studio, High Point NC (Air Date: 12/4/71)\n\nThe date of this change was established by process of elimination.\n\nMissouri Mauler successfully defended the title on Monday 11/29/71 in Greenville, SC. WGHP taped TV on Tuesdays, and while no record exists of matches on that taping on 11/30, neither Larry Hamilton (Mauler) nor Jack Brisco were on house shows Tuesday 11/30 held in Raleigh or Columbia.\n\nCarroll Hall (who assists us with title histories) saw the switch on WGHP TV and knows it was around the Thanksgiving weekend. It could not have been the Tuesday before Thanksgiving (11/23/71) because Mauler is still champion on 11/29/71. Plus, both Mauler and Brisco were wrestling in Columbia that night. It could not have been two weeks later on Tuesday 12/7/71 because the Mauler (but not Brisco) was wrestling in Columbia that night.\n\nThis only leaves Tuesday 11/30/73 at WGHP in High Point NC as the possible date of the switch, and that date is now considered confirmed based on the information and process above.\n\nRip Hawk (1)\n\n2/14/72 Charlotte Coliseum, Charlotte NC\n\nBased on information found in the newspaper ad for this show, Rip Hawk apparently won a tournament to earn the title shot from Eastern Champion Jack Brisco.\n\nNEWSPAPER AD, PREVIEW, AND RESULTS\n\nJack Brisco (2)\n\n4/10/72 Charlotte Park Center, Charlotte NC\n\nNEWSPAPER AD, PREVIEW, AND RESULTS\n\nRip Hawk (2)\n\nSometime between 4/25/72 and 5/25/72, Puerto Rico\n\nThis was a \"phantom\" switch.\n\nJack Brisco accounts in his autobiography that he was unavailable for regular bookings in the territory due to so many bookings elsewhere, and the promotion decided to give the title back to Rip Hawk, the story being put forth that the title changed hands in Puerto Rico.\n\nBrisco is listed as defending the Eastern title against the Missouri Mauler in Charleston on 4/25. This was the last reference to Jack Brisco as Eastern champion.\n\nIn May, a clip is shown on WBTV where Rip pins Jack Brisco, and Rip claims that he won the Eastern title from Jack in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\nJerry Brisco\n\n6/13/72 Township Auditorium, Columbia, SC\n\nNEWSPAPER AD AND RESULT\n\nRip Hawk (3)\n\n8/28/72 Memorial Auditorium, Greenville, SC\n\nNEWSPAPER AD AND RESULT\n\nJerry Brisco (2)\n\n9/4/72 Memorial Auditorium, Greenville, SC\n\nNEWSPAPER AD AND RESULT\n\nRip Hawk (4)\n\n12/28/72 Greensboro Coliseum, Greensboro, NC\n\nNEWSPAPER AD AND RESULT\n\nJerry Brisco (3)\n\n3/3/73 Memorial Coliseum, Winston-Salem, NC\n\nNEWSPAPER AD AND RESULT\n\nOle Anderson\n\n5/9/73 WRAL TV Studio, Raleigh NC\n\nWrestling Revue magazine from that year interviews new Eastern Champion Ole Anderson and reports he won the title at WRAL TV.\n\nAn original photograph taken in Richmond 5/4 has an inscription on the rear noting that Anderson won the title from Brisco on 5/9, which was a Wednesday night, the night which television was taped in Raleigh. The only house event that same night 5/9 was in Asheville NC and neither Brisco nor Anderson were on the Asheville show, which made it possible for them to be on Raleigh TV.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHS AND NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS\n\nAND MORE INFORMATION ON THIS TITLE CHANGE\n\nJerry Brisco (4)\n\n7/3/73 Township Auditorium, Columbia, SC\n\nOn 7/3/73, Jerry wrestles Ole Anderson for the title in Columbia. Ole is billed as the champion and Jerry as the former champion. There were no results in the newspaper. However, further research shows no references to the Eastern title from 7/3 until 7/14. On the 14th, Jerry defended the Eastern title against Ole in Roanoke VA. Unless we uncover evidence to the contrary, this confirms Columbia 7/3 as the site and date for the change.\n\nNEWSPAPER AD plus REFERENCE CLIPPING\n\nEastern Title Retired\n\nMid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship Established\n\nJerry Brisco\n\n9/6/73, Greensboro Coliseum, Greensboro, NC\n\nJerry Brisco is final Eastern Heavyweight Champion\n\nNew Mid-Atlantic Championship Belt is presented to Jerry Brisco\n\nSee Origin of the Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship for more detials.\n\nJohnny Valentine\n\nAwarded to Valentine following injury\n\nto Jerry Brisco (Jan 1974)\n\nThis title change has proven very difficult to document.\n\nHere is what we know for sure:\n\n Newspaper results from 12/28/73 in Charleston SC show a title match between champion Jerry Brisco and challenger Johnny Valentine being stopped after Brisco is injured. (\"Brisco accidentally ran into the referee, fell down, and hit the support. It was feared he may have broken some ribs, so the match was stopped.\")\n\nREFERENCE CLIPPING: CHARLESTON\n\n A newspaper clipping from Columbia, SC promoting a 3/5/74 card at the Township Auditorium mentions that Jerry was returning to action following an injury around Christmas 1973. The time frames line up well, and we will assume that Jerry Brisco was out for an injury and the title was awarded to Valentine early in the year 1974, using the story above. The clipping also mentions a tour of the orient, so the story could be partially based on that truth. (Brisco was not on Mid-Atlantic cards for the first 7 weeks of 1974.)\n\nREFERENCE CLIPPING: COLUMBIA\n\n Another possible story: Valentine was told on TV that he would be awarded the title by default when Jerry Brisco failed to show up for a title defense. Brisco later complained to announcer Elliott Murnick on the Raleigh version of Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, after returning to action, that he never lost the belt in the ring, that the Crockets gave Valentine the belt while he was in Japan with his brother Jack. (Credit - Carroll Hall) This story matches a listing in Title Histories by Duncan & Will: \"Awarded [to Johnny Valentine] when Jerry Brisco goes to Japan.\"\n\n Contradicting this is a mention in an issue of Wrestling Guide magazine by Charleston correspondent James Reeves that Valentine won the title from Brisco in Charleston. Looking at match dates and newpaper ads, by process of elimination, this would have had to happen on 1/4/74. Valentine wasn't on the 1/11 card a week later. He is documented to be defending the title as early as 1/21 in Charlotte, which would have been promoted on a Charlotte TV taping on 1/16/74. Clippings for the 1/4/74 Charleston card are unclear, listing Valentine wrestling \"Tom Jones for the third time in as many weeks.\" Tom Jones had wrestled Valentine twice in December (12/7 and 12/14/73). We are guessing Tom Jones was a replacement for Brisco, who missed the date due to either injury or going to Japan as documented above.\n\nWe do not believe Valentine defeated Brisco in the ring for the title.\n\nREFERENCE CLIPPING - WRESTLING GUIDE ARTICLE\n\n Earliest title-defense reference for Valentine: 1/21/74 Valentine vs. Bruggers in Charlotte. Promotional work for that match would have taken place on the TV taped 1/16/74.\n\n First match back for Jerry Brisco following alleged injury: 2/11/74 Charlotte (in a 6 man tag team match.)\n\nPaul Jones\n\n3/9/75 Park Center, Charlotte NC\n\nJones pinned Valentine in a fence match\n\nAs Jones pinned Valentine, Valentine put his leg on the rope to break the count. The referee did not see this, and Jones pulled Valentine's leg off the ropes before the three count ended. Valentine protested, Ric Flair came down to ringside and protested as well, but referee Angelo Martinelli raised Paul Jones hand and awarded the title belt to Jones.\n\nMORE ON THE DECISION TO RECOGNIZE THIS TITLE CHANGE\n\nJohnny Valentine (2)\n\n3/19/75. Announced at the TV taping in Raleigh (airing in most markets on 3/22/75) that Jones had been stripped of the title and the belt returned to Johnny Valentine by NWA President Sam Muchnick. Valentine is now recognized as champion.\n\nValentine announced on the WRAL TV taping on 3/12/75 that he had sent the film of the 3/9 match in Charlotte to NWA president Sam Muchnick asking that the film be reviewed and the title returned to him since he his leg on the rope and the count should have been stopped (see Paul Jones above.) Muchnick reviewed the tape, ruled in Valentine's favor, stripped Jones of the title, and awarded the title to Johnny Valentine. This was announced at WRAL TV taping on 3/19/75.\n\nMORE ON THE DECISION TO RECOGNIZE THIS TITLE CHANGE\n\nWahoo McDaniel\n\n6/29/75 Asheville Civic Center, Asheville NC\n\nAfter a chase that went on for the better part of a year, Wahoo McDaniel finally defeated Johnny Valentine for the Mid-Atlantic title. Valentine had seemed unbeatable.\n\nNEWSPAPER AD & DATEBOOK REFERENCES\n\nA GATEWAY EXCLUSIVE\n\nRic Flair\n\n9/20/75 Hampton Coliseum, Hampton, VA\n\nMany title histories don't have Flair winning his first Mid-Atlantic title until spring of 1976, but it was actually two weeks before the Wilmington Plane Crash. Flair was allowed to maintain the title throughout his rehabilitation period, despite not defending the title during the NWA 30-day defense period. He returned to action in January, mostly in tag matches or six-man matches, and began defense of the title in February.\n\nNEWSPAPER AD AND PREVIEW | 2nd NEWSPAPER AD AND RESULTS\n\nWahoo McDaniel (2)\n\n5/03/76 Charlotte Coliseum, Charlotte, NC\n\nNEWSPAPER AD AND RESULT\n\nRic Flair (2)\n\n5/24/76 Charlotte Coliseum, Charlotte, NC\n\nThis is the famous \"Table Leg\" match where Ric hit Wahoo with a table leg that had been broken off from a ringside table. Although the spot was worked, the table leg had a nail sticking out of it and severely cut Wahoo over his eye, requiring 40 stitches to close the wound. Wahoo would mention this incident in TV interviews over the next decade.\n\nNEWSPAPER AD RESULT CLIPPING\n\nWahoo McDaniel (3)\n\n9/11/76 Greenville Memorial Auditorium in Greenville, SC\n\nNEWSPAPER AD RESULT CLIPPING\n\nRic Flair (3)\n\n10/16/76 Greensboro Coliseum, Greensboro, NC\n\nNEWSPAPER AD | RESULTS\n\nWahoo McDaniel (4)\n\n12/27/76 Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA\n\nNEWSPAPER AD RESULT CLIPPING\n\nGreg Valentine\n\n6/11/77 Greensboro Coliseum, Greensboro, NC\n\nNEWSPAPER AD | RESULTS\n\nWahoo McDaniel (5)\n\n8/9/77 Dorton Arena, Raleigh NC\n\nNEWSPAPER AD & RESULT\n\nGreg Valentine (2)\n\n9/7/77 at WRAL TV studios, Raleigh NC Airdate 9/10/77\n\nMid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling Television\n\nThis was the famous match where Valentine broke Wahoo's leg on television. Greg Valentine put up the $2000 in silver dollars against Wahoo's Mid-Atlantic title. In a match still talked about today, Valentine had Wahoo prone on the mat and held his leg and fell full-weight on the leg, breaking the ankle. Wahoo submitted and Valentine had regained the title.\n\nWahoo McDaniel (6)\n\n4/2/78 Greensboro Coliseum, Greensboro, NC\n\nGREENSBORO NEWSPAPER AD & RESULT\n\nUPDATED: *Also documented to have changed hands two days earlier on 3/31/78 in Charleston SC with Gene Anderson as a special referee. That change was ignored in Greensboro and Greg Valentine wore the belt into the ring and defended against Wahoo on 4/2, so that date is still recognized as the official title change.\n\nCHARLESTON 3/31 AD & RESULT\n\nKen Patera\n\n4/9/78 Charlotte Coliseum, Charlotte NC\n\nNEWSPAPER AD & RESULT\n\nTony Atlas\n\n9/17/78 Roanoke Civic Center, Roanoke VA\n\nNEWSPAPER AD & RESULT\n\nKen Patera (2)\n\n10/15/78 Roanoke Civic Center, Roanoke VA\n\nNEWSPAPER AD & RESULT\n\nJim Brunzell\n\n9/14/79 Richmond Coliseum, Richmond VA\n\nNEWSPAPER AD & STORY BY DAVID CHAPPELL\n\nRay Stevens\n\n11/22/79 Greensboro Coliseum, Greensboro NC\n\nNEWSPAPER AD & RESULT\n\nJim Brunzell (2)\n\n12/25/79 Charlotte Coliseum, Charlotte NC\n\nNEWSPAPER AD & RESULT\n\nTHANKS TO KYLE ROSSER FOR HELPING US ESTABLISH THIS DATE\n\nThe Iron Sheik\n\nmanaged by Gene Anderson\n\n5/11/80 Charlotte Coliseum, Charlotte NC\n\nNEWSPAPER AD & RESULT\n\nRicky Steamboat\n\n11/1/80 Richmond Coliseum, Richmond VA\n\nNEWSPAPER AD AND RESULT | STORY BY DAVID CHAPPELL\n\nIvan Koloff\n\n4/16/81 The Scope, Norfolk VA\n\nNEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS COMING SOON\n\nRicky Steamboat (2)\n\n10/10/81 Greensboro Coliseum, Greensboro NC\n\nSteamboat replaced Dusty Rhodes who was originally scheduled to meet Koloff for a shot at the Mid-Atlantic title.

Eastern title reigns are recognized as former Mid-Atlantic title reigns, making this reign Jack's 3rd Mid-Atlantic title reign.\n\nJack Brisco and his brother Jerry are the only two men to have held both the Eastern States and Mid-Atlantic titles.\n\nNEWSPAPER CLIPPING | COMMON THREAD\n\nRoddy Piper (2)\n\n7/7/82 WPCQ Television Studios, Charlotte NC\n\nPiper had stolen the Mid-Atlantic title belt after a disputed match, and would not return it to Brisco unless he agreed to face him on TV and put up $10,000. Brisco quickly got up the money (with help from Ricky Steamboat and Wahoo McDaniel) and the two met in one of the more, memorable televised title matches of the time.\n\nJack Brisco (4)\n\n8/3/82 Civic Center, Raleigh NC\n\nRoddy Piper is stabbed by a fan after the matches are over.\n\nNEWSPAPER CLIPPING\n\nPaul Jones (2)\n\nmanaged by Sir Oliver Humperdink\n\n9/1/82 WPCQ TV Studios, Charlotte NC\n\nJack Brisco (5)\n\n10/18/82 Memorial Auditorium, Greenville SC\n\nNEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS\n\nPaul Jones (3)\n\nmanaged by Sir Oliver Humperdink\n\nCORRECTED\n\n10/25/82 Fayetteville NC\n\nNEWSPAPER AD (AD ONLY - NO RESULT)\n\nJack Brisco (6)\n\nPossibly took lace in two different cities.\n\n11/28/82 Charlotte NC\n\n11/30/82 in Columbia SC\n\nDory Funk Jr.\n\nmanaged by Paul Jones\n\n1/30/83 Charlotte NC\n\nNEED CLIPPING\n\nRufus R.

While Koloff was a top level wrestler, the title no longer had value because it was handed off and not won in the ring. The title became a minor/mid-level title from this point forward.\n\n(Rhetorically, and in terms of the storyline, fans have to ask why would the NWA and/or Crockett Promotions allow something like this to happen? How is this reasonably explained? The answer, of course, is lazy booking!)\n\nAngelo Mosca Jr.\n\n2/01/84 Spartanburg SC TV Taping\n\nAirdate 2/4/84 Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling\n\nCORRECTED - CLIPPING NEEDED\n\nVerified via date video on WWE Network\n\nIvan Koloff (3)\n\n3/18/84 Charlotte Coliseum, Charlotte NC\n\nNEED CLIPPING\n\nAngelo Mosca Jr. (2)\n\n4/22/84 Charlotte Coliseum, Charlotte NC\n\nNEED CLIPPING\n\nThe Masked Outlaw (Dory Funk Jr.) (2)\n\nmanaged by Gary Hart\n\n5/02/84* Memorial Auditorium, Spartanburg SC\n\nWorld Wide Wrestling TV Taping\n\nCLIPPING\n\n*Unconfirmed.
