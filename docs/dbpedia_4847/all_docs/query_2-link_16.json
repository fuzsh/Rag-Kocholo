        "text": "Demolition recently appeared on Prime Time with Sean Mooney (via wrestlinginc.com), and spoke about how much it would take for them to take a WWE Hall of Fame induction…\n\nSmash on a Possible WWE Hall of fame Induction; “Who knows? We may never ever [get in], because there are so many tag teams out there. If they asked us, what would we really do now?” Smash questioned. “It’s been 20 years since we’ve been around the business and the guys make supposedly $5,000-$6,000 when they go to the [WWE] Hall of Fame? You know it would take probably $100,000, at least, to bring us in for the Hall of Fame. I thought ‘What a good number’ because I’d give ten thousand to [my Mother-in-Law’s] church, and I’d take another $10,000 of that $100,000 and give it to my son, he’s a Deputy in the Sheriff’s Department in the K-9 unit, and I’m thinking of all these charities I’d give to.”"
