He was strong, could wrestle and moved pretty well for a big guy. Even with shit gimmicks, he tried his best to make it work because he was so damn good.\n\nPost by mizerable on\n\nAx just looked cool. Those eyes, man.\n\nSmash was awesome but he didn't legit look psycho.\n\nCrush was just bleh. Much better when he went Kona.\n\nPost by Stone Coke Miami Watson ðŸ¥ƒ on\n\nAx....most of the time he had a serious look and was more actions than words.\n\nCool demeanor and fit the gimmick well.\n\nPost by Old Baby on\n\nSmash was easily the best brawler of the two and fit the Demolition mold better than Ax. By the end of Demolition's run, Smash evolved into a much better worker than when he started. I also think Smash was just the better all around performer of the two.\n\nPost by BorneAgain on\n\n#NoDemolitionBlastOptionNoPeace\n\nSeriously though, probably Ax if just because the raspy voice really worked. Darsow was great as Smash but his voice in certain promos came across as unintentionally funny (especially when Smash yelling sounds oddly similar to Curt Hennig yelling).\n\nPost by auph10imitated on\n\nSmash was always my favourite, Barry Darsow obviously. He always looked cooler than Ax. Though Ax was more intimidating. Crush was just there.\n\nPost by celtics543 on\n\nI was pretty young when they were around but I remember always being more of a Smash fan than anything else. Not sure why, could have been because Friendly's had a \"Smash\" ice cream that I really liked and I just linked the two together but either way he was my favorite.\n\nPost by Futureraven: Beelzebruv on\n\n#NoDemolitionBlastOptionNoPeace\n\nSeriously though, probably Ax if just because the raspy voice really worked. Darsow was great as Smash but his voice in certain promos came across as unintentionally funny (especially when Smash yelling sounds oddly similar to Curt Hennig yelling).\n\nYou want funny, just watch him making weird noises and faces whenever anyone else was talking.\n\nPost by Emmet Russell on\n\nWho's Ax?\n\nI always heard \"HERE COMES THE ASSSSS! HERE COMES THE SMASHER!!!! THE DEMOLITION!!!\"\n\nI thought it was Ass and Smash for the longest time.\n\nPost by Old Baby on\n\nI feel it's worth saying that while not my favorite, I thought Crush was really good. Had the team not already been in decline when they added him, I think he might be remembered much differently. He was a great brawler who was also the most powerful + agile of the three. During their last months feuding with LOD, I remember seeing Smash execute a plancha onto one of the LOD outside. The team could have evolved and just gotten better and better with time if Vince had invested in them instead of Hawk & Animal."
