        "text": "Why Demolition is so popular compared to their other personas and which personas they enjoyed working as the most.\n\nWhy the original Smash Randy Colley (Moondog Rex) was replaced by Barry Darsow:\n\nBill Eadie : “It was well known that Randy was part of the Moondogs. To try to have another persona, your also popular as that previous persona. It was fortunate for me cause Randy is a good friend of mine, but Barry is alot more professional, and a much closer friend.”\n\nBarry Darsow: “When I got the call to come up there, Vince called me and told me I have the chance to be partners with Bill Eadie, I just said yes right away, I just jumped at the chance.”\n\nWho came up with the Demolition character.\n\nWere Demolition better as a babyface or heel tag team.\n\nHow important Mr. Fuji was to the success of the team.\n\nIf Demoltion are a rip off of the Road Warriors:\n\nBill Eadie: “We knew what we could do, we felt we were successful. I thought we did it better. This is an ego driven business, so if you don’t have confidence in yourself, you need to get out of the business. There’s gonna be fans that say that we are rip offs, but there’s gonna be Demolition fans that say they (Road Warriors) were the rip offs. I cant be worried about that. My main concern and his (Barry Darsow) main concern is we went to work each day, and we did the best we could.”"
