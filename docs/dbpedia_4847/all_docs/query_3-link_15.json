Darsow began his career wrestling out of Georgia and the Mid-South. In 1984, he changed his name to Krusher Khrushchev, and soon became a popular wrestler, pushing his way up the ranks. Krushchev came to the NWA in 1985, and quickly became a force. He traded out with Ivan and Nikita Koloff, and the three defended the NWA Tag Titles for a few months before they lost them to the Rock 'n' Roll Express. At the end of '85, Khrushchev won the vacated Mid-Atlantic Title, beating Sam Houston. He held it for less than 2 months before Houston managed to take the title. In September '86, Khrushchev and Ivan Koloff were the first winners of the NWA United States Tag Titles, and defended them for 3 months before losing to Rugged Ronnie Garvin and Barry Windham. Soon after, Darsow decided to leave the NWA and try out the WWF.\n\nWith his arrival in the WWF, Darsow adorned face paint and a tag-team partner, creating the great tag-team Demolition. Ax (Bill Eadie) and Smash (Darsow) soon became one of the top tag teams in the WWF, winning the tag belts numerous times. At the beginning, Ax and Smash were a face-painted heel group. They had many memorable battles with the top teams in the WWF, including the British Bulldogs, the Hart Foundation, and Strike Force. Things would soon change, though. At the first \"large-scale\" Royal Rumble, a freak draw brought Ax and Smash as the first two men into the ring. Naturally, both men tried to beat the living daylights out of each other, to the cheers of the fans. When the next wrestler, Andre the Giant, arrived, the duo turned and attacked, and fought well as a team. Although neither lasted through the Rumble, they had gotten respect from the fans, and were soon faces.\n\nThis did not change much for the tag-team titles, just the opponents they faced. Heel teams like the Powers of Pain and the Brain Busters came after them, wanting the gold that they continually wore around their waists. The Brain Busters, using the methods that made them infamous in WCW, won the gold from Demolition. The feud continued on and off for a few months, and Demolition won back the titles in October '89. Demolition's next major threat was the Colossal Connection, consisting of Andre the Giant and Haku. Once again, a Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan team managed to take away the belts, and once again, Demolition returned, as Wrestlemania VI, to defeat the two men and become 3-time champions.\n\nWhen Ax (Eadie) started having health problems, Crush (Brian Adams) took over for him for a brief time. Crush's coming created a triad of tag-team champs, and Demolition soon went heel again under his influence. Since all three wore face-paint, they would sometimes swap out with each other during matches, keeping the ref from knowing who the legal man was. The trio had a minor feud with the Rockers, then began a war with the Hart Foundation, who, since becoming faces, were looking for their second title reign. The two groups met at Summerslam '90 in a 2-3 falls match. Although it was Smash & Crush against Hart & Neidhart, Ax did come to the ring as a fresh man during the fight, helping his team. It all came to naught, however, as the Hart Foundation won the belts. This was the last time Demolition would taste the gold.\n\nDemolition would have one more time in the spotlight, teamming with Mr. Perfect at the Survivor Series against the Warriors. After Ax was eliminated, Smash & Crush battled to a Double Disqualification with the Legion of Doom. The Ultimate Warrior eventually won the match. After a brief feud with the Legion, Demolition slowly faded out, as Eadie retired due to his health concerns. Darsow found himself without a strong gimmick, as Crush moved on to fight in the singles ranks. \"Smash\" could not survive on his own, so Darsow disappeared for a short time. He returned to the WWF as the Repo Man, a strange character who used a tow cable, among other items, in his matches. The Repo Man character lasted almost 2 years, but was not regarded as a great wrestler. He had no major feuds, although he did team with Ted DiBiase at one point. The most notable match of his career was against his former partner, Crush. In 1994, Darsow left the WWF, his home for so long, and headed to WCW to try and rebuild his career.\n\nDarsow's first attempt in WCW was as the Blackstreet Bully. He did have a somewhat memorable feud with Dustin Rhodes, but mainly did not catch on with the fans. They fought at Uncensored '95 in a \"King of the Road\" match, battling it out in the back of an 18-Wheeler in a pre-taped bout. Both men became bloody, before the Bully finally won out in the end. The match was heavily edited, and both wrestlers, due to the excessive violence, were released from WCW. While Rhodes went to the WWF and became Goldust, Darsow stayed on the outside for a time, with little to show for it.\n\nDarsow later returned to WCW and wrestled under his own name, but basically became a jobber to other wrestlers in the WCW stable, rarely ever winning a match. Fans, not knowing who he used to be in the WWF, gave him no respect. Darsow's wrestling career in the big leagues hit rock bottom when he reappeared as a wrestling golfer named Pain Stewart. This angle got some heat from the audience, but was soon dropped after the real Payne Stewart was killed in a plane crash. Barry Darsow then disappeared from WCW.\n\nAt Wrestlemania XVII, Darsow reappeared, reprising his role as the Repo Man in the Gimmick Battle Royale. Why he did not choose to be Smash is beyond me. The Repo Man didn't last long, quickly getting tossed out. The Royale was later won by the Iron Sheik. It is truly doubtful that Darsow will be seen in the WWF again, but at least his storied career will be remembered by the faithful Demolition fans.\n\nPay-Per-View/Show Summary: (20 - 29, 1 DDQ)\n\n- NWA Mid-South Superdome Extravaganza (April '84) = Krusher Khruschev was pinned by Jim Duggan in a \"roulette coal miner's glove\" match.\n\n- NWA Mid-South Superdome Extravaganza (June '84) = Krusher Khruschev lost the Mid-South TV Title to Terry Taylor.\n\n- NWA Great American Bash '85 = Krusher Khruschev & Ivan Koloff retained the NWA Tag Titles, fighting to a Double Disqualification with the AWA Tag Champs the Road Warriors.\n\n- Polynesian Hot Summer Night (August '85) = Krusher Khruschev & Nikita Koloff were beaten by Magnum TA & Dusty Rhodes.\n\n- AWA Supercrash (September '85) = Krusher Khruschev, Ivan & Nikita Koloff retained the NWA World Six Man Tag-Team Titles by defeating Crusher, Dick the Bruiser, and Baron von Raschke.\n\n- NWA Starrcade '85 = Krusher Khruschev won the vacated Mid-Atlantic Title, beating Sam Houston.\n\n- NWA/AWA Star Wars (December '85) = Khruschev and Ivan Koloff lost to the Road Warriors.\n\n- NWA United States Tag-Team Tournament (Sept '86) = Khruschev and Ivan Koloff defeated Tim Horner and Nelson Royal, Mganum TA and Dusty Rhodes, and the Kansas Jayhawks to win the NWA US Tag Titles.\n\n- NWA Starrcade '86 = Khruschev and Ivan Koloff stayed the NWA US Champs, winning a \"No DQ\" Match over the Kansas Jayhawks.\n\n- WWF Saturday Night's Main Event #10 (February '87) Smash competed in a Battle Royal, which was won by Hercules.\n\n- Paul Boesch Retirement Show (August '87) = Demolition (Smash and Ax) lost, via DQ, to Tito Santana and Mil Mascaras.\n\n- WWF Survivor Series '87 = Demolition, the Hart Foundation, the Islanders, the Russians, and Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine and Dino Bravo fought in a \"Tag Team Elimination\" Match against Strike Force, the Killer Bees, Young Stallions, the British Bulldogs and the Rougeau Brothers.
