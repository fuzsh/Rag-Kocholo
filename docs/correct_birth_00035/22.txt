Former Tiburon Mansion

In 2001 Andre and Steffi paid $23 million for a sprawling estate in the exclusive Marin County town of Tiburon. The 3.5 acre property featured a 10,500 square-foot mansion, 2,500 square foot guest house, two swimming pools, three spas, a hot tub, a cold plunge, a stream, and a hydrotherapy waterfall. The Agassi/Grafs initially listed the home for sale for $24.5 million. In January 2007 they accepted $20 million, a $3 million loss. The buyer was a hedge fund manager named Stuart Peterson. Stuart is the manager of a hedge fund called Artis Capital. In 2005, Artis and Sequoia Capital gave the founders of YouTube $11.5 million in venture capital funding. Three months before buying the Tiburon property, Google purchased YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock. Artis received 176,621 shares of Google from the deal. At the time the deal closed those shares were worth $83 million. If Artis held on to those shares, after various stock splits, today the holdings would be worth close to $1 billion.

After buying Andre and Stefi's house for $20 million, Stuart and his wife shocked their neighbors when the filed plans to completely raze the entire property. In its place they constructed a 20,000+ square foot multi-structure compound with perfect views of the Golden Gate. Today the property is likely worth $60-80 million.
