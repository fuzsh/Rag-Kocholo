To shed a light on the resiliency of the people of the city and those affected by the tragedy at the Mandalay Bay on Sunday (October 1), native son Andre Agassi and the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority have teamed up to send out a message of hope and strength.\n\nThe Convention and Visitors Authority’s agency of record, R&R Partners, made a short film, voiced by Agassi, which talks about strength in the face of adversity. In the spot, which features a dark and distant skyline of Las Vegas coming closer as Agassi speaks in a somber but hopeful tone, he states: \"Strength isn’t anger. Strength isn’t vengeful…Strength is first responders who tirelessly carry visitors and locals alike to safety until sunrise. It’s our medics and surgeons, all of them, who come running to the calls of those in need. It’s the police who turn over every stone to make this city safe again. It’s the local businesses that became sanctuaries for people to run to… Strength is when we all pull together and rise up, all of us in every corner of this world. Strength is what we all are today and strength is our promise for tomorrow.”"
