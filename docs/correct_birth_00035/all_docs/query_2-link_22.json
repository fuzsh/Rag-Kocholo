I just never thought of life without tennis, even looking forward.\"\n\n\"If you don't practice you don't deserve to win.\"\n\n\"Sometimes it's just harder to remind yourself about what you're doing and why you're doing it... Other times, you have a great desire for it, but physically you're not responding the way you want. That presents other challenges. Then sometimes it all comes together.\"\n\n\"I question myself every day. That's what I still find motivating about this. I don't have the answers, I don't pretend that I do just because I won the match. Just keep fighting and maybe something good happens.\"\n\n― Andre Agassi Quotes\n\n***\n\n* The editor of this short biography made every effort to maintain information accuracy, including any quotes, facts, or key life events.
