        "text": "It didnt help that in 1951, in defiance of the shahs wishes [the Shah claimed to be in favor of nationalization] Premier Mohammed Mossadeq forced the Majlis to nationalize Irans British-owned oil industry-- [Irans parliament was not \"forced\" to nationalize, it was passed legally] a move that prompted Great Britain to impose economic sanctions whose primary effect was to make life harder for people like us. Politically speaking, things got a bit touchy after that. Mossadeq, who was ousted in 1952 [he was not ousted, he resigned voluntarily] returned with a vengeance, gathering enough power to persuade Mohammad Reza Shah to flee that same year. [the Shah fled Iran on his own accord] With the support of the CIA, the shah would return in 1953 and overthrow Mossadeq, but things in Iran werent exactly stable in the interim. [The American CIA and British MI6 overthrew Mossadegh in August 1953, after which the Shah returned to Iran from exile in Rome].\n\nSo I set my sights on America."
