        "text": "When Andre Agassi was rising the ranks as a professional tennis player — en route to becoming one of the greatest American men to ever hit the circuit — he often felt forced to defend his hometown of Las Vegas.\n\n“I was born and raised here,” Agassi said last Saturday during a press conference to promote The Netflix Slam featuring superstars Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz. “When I turned pro in 1,972 years ago, there was about 300,000 people that lived in this town. I would travel the world representing Vegas, having to answer some very basic questions such as, ‘What’s it like to live in a hotel?’ It was like, wait a second, Vegas is more than just a strip [of hotels]. To watch it evolve to a point where now we’re seeing not just sports come here, but we’re seeing the greatest environments for sports to participate in the Super Bowl and Formula 1 now here. It’s remarkable for me, I wish it was around when I was playing. To have tennis come here now, especially with these two guys, what a gift to Vegas. And by the way, what a gift Vegas is to tennis.”\n\nIf the 53-year-old sounds like a good ambassador for the sport, well then it should come as no surprise that Agassi had more official duties last weekend than just the press conference. He appeared on court to present the championship trophy (to eventual winner Alcaraz), and during the match Agassi joined Andy Roddick, Jim Courier, Mary Joe Fernández, Patrick McEnroe, Prakash Amritraj and Kay Adams for telecast commentary. He also spent a few minutes with The Hollywood Reporter to talk tennis, pickleball and what he’s streaming on Netflix.\n\nGive me a taste of the Andre Agassi commentary: What do you make of The Netflix Slam?\n\nI love the vehicle that Netflix is bringing to live sports content because it gives you a chance to discuss it. You’re not living in sound bites or stuck between commercial breaks and all that. I’m looking forward to the live interaction with Andy Roddick and Prakash who really understand the game, so we can really start to unpack it in a way for viewers who maybe haven’t heard it in this way.\n\nLet’s talk Nadal and Alcaraz. When you think about these two guys and how the game has changed since you left, what strikes you most about the way that they play?\n\nThey’re on another level athletically with their speed, defense, offense, pace, spin trajectories, geometry. The game has also changed. It’s always been a one-on-one sport; there’s always been a level of how you impose what you do in a way that just beats one person as opposed to trying to play great tennis. I think the greats of the game really understand the nuance of that difference. I’m not trying to be wonderful today. I’m just trying to be better than you, and if I’m better than you, I will look wonderful. That’s what is very similar [for Nadal and Alcaraz], each one walks that edge of what brings out their level of dominance without going over the cliff.\n\nWhen you play at that level, how do you switch gears for an exhibition match? Obviously no one wants to get injured when there is a tournament coming up, but I would imagine you want to win no matter what?\n\nIt’s not even about winning or not wanting to hurt yourself, it’s not really about even playing these matches. These greats get to a point where it’s not about winning. It is about making sure that there’s no regret, that you’ve left everything out there, that you understand where you are at every moment, and that you’ve given yourself the best chance. Winning becomes a byproduct. Those are what really the best do in those moments.\n\nDo you miss it?\n\nNo. It’s so much easier talking about it than doing it.\n\nWhat are you watching on Netflix right now?\n\nSuits. It’s just as addictive as crack or fried food. I love the characters. The acting is incredible. They can make hay out of every freaking episode. I do love the fact that you don’t necessarily need to have complete ownership or recall over the previous episode to fully appreciate what’s going on in the next one, which is good for me because I can be a little bit braindead in my approach to bingeing. But yeah, it’s fun. I’m really into it.\n\nYou’ve become such a standout pickleball player. Also, as someone who owns an Olympic gold medal, what do you make of the conversation to add the sport to the upcoming Olympics?\n\nI haven’t heard the talk about it. The sport’s growing unbelievably well. I would love to see it pick up in that demographic. I’m not an expert in understanding the context of the evolution, but seeing it morph into college sports would be pretty amazing. It’s a really combative, athletic activity that deserves its place and respect. Pickleball and tennis can live very happily in the same sandbox. I would love to see it continue to grow in other platforms and continue to expand on bigger stages.\n\nLast question: I’m a big fan of your book, Open. Since it’s been about 15 years, have you considered a follow up? Perhaps writing about what your life has been like since leaving tennis?\n\nI don’t know if I have another book in me. Unfortunately, less people read today, so maybe there’s another way of communicating the life I have lived in a different medium. I have to think about it. My bandwidth hasn’t had the capacity to really take something on yet. But, again, I love people and I love learning. I love learning in an hour what it took somebody else 10 years to find out. I’m a big fan of connection. So, we’ll see."
