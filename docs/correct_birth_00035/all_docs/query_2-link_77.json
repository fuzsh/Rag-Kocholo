        "text": "What is Andre Agassi's Net Worth?\n\nAndre Agassi is a retired professional American tennis player who has a net worth of $145 million.\n\nAndre Agassi, one of tennis' most illustrious and charismatic figures, carved out an exceptional career marked by remarkable comebacks and a unique flair that transcended the sport. Agassi turned professional in 1986, quickly becoming known for both his flamboyant style and his powerful, baseline-dominated play. His aggressive groundstrokes, particularly his forehand, and his return of serve, were among the best in the game, earning him a reputation as a formidable opponent.\n\nAgassi's career was a rollercoaster of highs and lows. In the early 1990s, he won several Grand Slam titles, including an emotional first Wimbledon win in 1992, which was followed by the 1994 US Open and the 1995 Australian Open. His early success was also marked by reaching the World No. 1 ranking in 1995. However, his career faced challenges, and he suffered a notable dip in form and ranking.\n\nRemarkably, Agassi reinvigorated his career in the late 1990s, showcasing his resilience and dedication. He completed the Career Grand Slam by winning the French Open in 1999, a rare and prestigious accomplishment that places him among the tennis greats. He added to his legacy by winning the Australian Open in 2000, 2001, and 2003.\n\nAgassi's rivalry with Pete Sampras was one of the most captivating in tennis history, marked by numerous memorable matches that highlighted the contrast in their playing styles and personalities. Beyond Sampras, Agassi had significant rivalries with other top players of his era, contributing to the golden age of tennis in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nOff the court, Agassi was known for his philanthropic efforts, particularly in education. He established the Andre Agassi Foundation for Education, dedicated to helping disadvantaged children. His post-retirement endeavors include his foundation work, writing, and occasional coaching, including mentoring Novak Djokovic briefly.\n\nEarly Life\n\nAndre Kirk Agassi was born on April 28, 1970, in Las Vegas, Nevada, to Emmanuel \"Mike\" Agassi, a former Olympic boxer from Iran and Elizabeth \"Betty\" Agassi. He has three older siblings â€“ Rita, Philip, and Tami. Agassi won the 1982 National Indoor Boys 14s Doubles Championship in Chicago. He was 12. At the age of 13, Agassi was sent to Nick Bollettieri's Tennis Academy in Florida. He was meant to stay for only three months because that was all his father could afford. After just a half an hour of watching Agassi play, Bollettieri called Agassi's dad and said: \"Take your check back. He's here for free.\" Agassi dropped out of school in the ninth grade to pursue a full-time tennis career.\n\nCareer\n\nAgassi turned pro in 1986 at 16. Within two years he had already won more than $2 million in prize money. The 1990s featured Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras dominating the world of men's tennis. Sampras was steady and clean cut. Agassi was flashy with a bad-boy attitude. Agassi's professional career spanned from the mid-1980s to the early 2000s. He has won the Grand Slam eight times. He's a 1996 Olympic gold medalist. During the era of tennis commonly called the Open Era, Agassi was the first men's tennis player to win four Australian Opens. He's one of just five men's singles players to win the Career Grand Slam in the Open Era and one of just eight overall throughout the history of tennis. He is the first player of two to date to win the Career Golden Slam and the ATP Tour World Championships. He was also the first men's tennis player to win all four Grand Slam tournaments on three different tennis court surfaces (hard, clay, and grass). He was part of the winning Davis Cup teams in 1990, 1992, and 1995. He was named the World No.1 for the first time in 1995. By 1997, he had fallen to No. 141 due to personal issues. However, by 1999 he was No. 1 again. The next four years were the most successful of Agassi's career. From 1994 to 2002 Andre was coached by Brad Gilbert.\n\nIn 2005, then-35-year-old Agassi managed to make it to the finals of the U.S. Open but lost to Roger Federer. Already plagued by back problems, he officially retired on September 3, 2006, after losing in the third round of the U.S. Open/\n\nOther Business Ventures\n\nAgassi and his wife Steffi Graf formed a company called Agassi Graf Holdings. They invested in a nightclub at Caesars Palace called Pure. The nightclub opened in 2004. Agassi and Graf sold their stake in Pure to Angel Management Group in 2010.\n\nIn August 2006, Agassi and Graf entered into a deal with high-end furniture maker Kreiss Enterprises to launch a furniture line called, of course, Agassi Graf Collection.\n\nAndre Agassi College Preparatory Academy/Agassi Center For Education\n\nIn 2001, Agassi opened the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy in Las Vegas. The school is a tuition-free charter school for at-risk children in the area. He personally donated $35 million to the school. In 2009, the graduating class had a 100 percent graduation rate and expected a 100 percent college acceptance rate.\n\nAgassi also supports Child Haven, the only residential facility for abused and neglected children in Las Vegas. In 1997, Agassi donated funding to Child Haven for a six-room classroom building now named the Agassi Center for Education. His foundation also provided $720,000 to assist in the building of the Andre Agassi Cottage for Medically Fragile Children. This 20-bed facility opened in December 2001 and provides comprehensive care for children who arrive with injuries or contagious illnesses, or who require physical and developmental care.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nAgassi dated Barbra Streisand in the early 1990s. He married Brooke Shields in 1997. They divorced in 1999. On October 22, 2001, Agassi married retired tennis player Steffi Graf in an intimate ceremony at their Las Vegas home. They have two children, son Jaden, born in 2001, and daughter Jaz, born in 2003. The family resides in the Las Vegas community of Summerlin with Graf's mother, brother Michael, and his four kids.\n\nAgassi founded the Andre Agassi Charitable Association in 1994, which assists Las Vegas' young people. He was awarded the ATP Arthur Ashe Humanitarian award in 1995 for his efforts to help disadvantaged youth. He has been cited as the most charitable and socially involved player in professional tennis. He very well may be the most charitable athlete of his generation.\n\nAgassi's charities help in assisting children reach their athletic potential. His Boys & Girls Club sees 2,000 children throughout the year and boasts a world-class junior tennis team. It also has a basketball program (the Agassi Stars) and a rigorous system that encourages a mix of academics and athletics.\n\nCareer Earnings\n\nAgassi earned around $30 million in prize-money during his career. That puts him in sixth place overall in terms of on court career earnings, with only to Djokovic, Federer, Nadal, Sampras, and Murray earning more than Agassi to date. Most importantly, Andrew earned significantly more through endorsements. At his career peak he was making $25 million a year through endorsements with companies such as Nike, Canon, American Express, Kia Motors, Head and Adidas.\n\nEndorsements\n\nAndre Agassi's illustrious tennis career was complemented by several significant endorsement deals, making him one of the most marketable athletes of his time. His charismatic personality, distinctive image, and on-court success attracted a variety of major brands. Below is a summary of some of his most notable endorsement deals:\n\nNike: Agassi's association with Nike is perhaps the most iconic of his endorsements. He signed with Nike in 1988, and the brand became synonymous with his image during the early part of his career. Nike provided Agassi with unique and colorful apparel, aligning with his rebellious and flamboyant style on the court. This partnership played a significant role in shaping the marketing of tennis apparel and footwear at the time.\n\nAdidas: After a brief separation from Nike, Agassi signed with Adidas in 2005. This deal marked a significant change, as Agassi had been closely associated with Nike for most of his career. While the Adidas deal was less flamboyant than his Nike years, it was still a major endorsement for both Agassi and the brand.\n\nHead: Agassi endorsed Head tennis racquets for a significant part of his career. His choice of racquet was crucial to his game, and his endorsement helped popularize the brand among both professional and amateur players.\n\nCanon: Agassi also had a memorable endorsement deal with Canon. The \"Image is everything\" campaign in the early 1990s, featuring Agassi, was highly successful and is still remembered as a landmark in sports marketing. This campaign helped elevate Agassi's status as a pop culture icon.\n\nAmerican Express, Kia Motors, and Others: Agassi also had deals with American Express and Kia Motors, among others. These endorsements capitalized on his appeal beyond the tennis world, showcasing his marketability as a global sports icon.\n\nFormer Tiburon Mansion\n\nIn 2001 Andre and Steffi paid $23 million for a sprawling estate in the exclusive Marin County town of Tiburon. The 3.5 acre property featured a 10,500 square-foot mansion, 2,500 square foot guest house, two swimming pools, three spas, a hot tub, a cold plunge, a stream, and a hydrotherapy waterfall. The Agassi/Grafs initially listed the home for sale for $24.5 million. In January 2007 they accepted $20 million, a $3 million loss. The buyer was a hedge fund manager named Stuart Peterson. Stuart is the manager of a hedge fund called Artis Capital. In 2005, Artis and Sequoia Capital gave the founders of YouTube $11.5 million in venture capital funding. Three months before buying the Tiburon property, Google purchased YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock. Artis received 176,621 shares of Google from the deal. At the time the deal closed those shares were worth $83 million. If Artis held on to those shares, after various stock splits, today the holdings would be worth close to $1 billion.\n\nAfter buying Andre and Stefi's house for $20 million, Stuart and his wife shocked their neighbors when the filed plans to completely raze the entire property. In its place they constructed a 20,000+ square foot multi-structure compound with perfect views of the Golden Gate. Today the property is likely worth $60-80 million."
