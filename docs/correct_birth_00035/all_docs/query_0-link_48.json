        "text": "VIDEO: Brooke Shields Blasts Ex-Husband Andre Agassi\n\nThey've been divorced for 14 years, but apparently there's still bad blood between Brooke Shields and Andre Agassi. When appearing on the Today show Wednesday for a segment titled, \"Dealing with Divorce: How to Move On,\" Shields referenced her..\n\nMega Buzz: Scoop on V, Grey's, Vampire Diaries and More!\n\nEvery week, editors Mickey O'Connor and Adam Bryant answer your burning questions. Want some TV scoop? Please send all questions&nbsp;to megascoop@tvguide.com. You raised the question last week, so answer it. Will there be a Visitor-human birth on V? &mdash; JimMICKEY: We already know that Morris Chestnut's Ryan Nichols has a human lovah, but I'm hearing that a different human-V coupling will produce a bouncing baby reptile.

And again, a man named Federline is slighted. It's simply not his month."
