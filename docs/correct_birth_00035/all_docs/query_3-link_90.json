        "text": "Andre Agassi played tennis professionally from 1986 to 2006, winning over $30-million in prize money. Often ranked #1 in the world, he won eight Grand Slam singles tournaments and an Olympic gold medal. He is only one of five men to have won all four Grand Slam singles titles and the only man in history to have won GS titles on all three playing surfaces (hardcourt, grass, and clay). He also won the Tennis Masters Cup and was part of a winning Davis Cup team. He is the founder of the Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation, which has raised over $60 million and opened the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy, a K-12 charter school for some of the underprivileged children of Las Vegas. He lives in that city with his wife, Steffi Graf, and his two children.\n\nRead full bio"
