        "text": "Q&A: Andre Agassi on education, Nevada and tennis' Mount Rushmore\n\nWith respect to Wayne Newton, tennis legend Andre Agassi is the real Mr. Las Vegas.\n\nThe Hall of Famer was born and raised in Las Vegas and proudly calls the city known for its tourists his permanent home. He's poured tens of millions of dollars in philanthropic efforts into the city. But his love of the Silver State extends past Clark County. The 44-year-old is the featured speaker at the 46th annual Governor's Dinner on July 18 in Carson City, one of the main fundraisers for the Wolf Pack.\n\nAgassi, who won his first professional event in Reno at the LakeRidge Tennis Club at age 16, has many fond memories of Northern Nevada. As such, Agassi didn't have any hesitancy helping out the school up north and said he didn't get any grief from friends who support the UNLV athletic department.\n\n\"Certainly not in the circles I run,\" Agassi said. \"It's an honor to be respected enough where I can travel the state and make a difference. To not do it would leave me with some explaining to do.\"\n\nIn addition to his Boys & Girls Club, center for abused children, cottage for disabled children and Agassi Prep high school for at-risk children, Agassi's Turner-Agassi Charter School Facilities Fund has built 39 charter schools across the country. So, Agassi, one of the most charitable athletes in recent memory, gave no pause to help out the Wolf Pack, especially since it dovetailed with his passion of education.\n\n\"It's a Nevada school, and I have a great deal of appreciation for everything that the school adds to our state,\" Agassi said. \"At the end of the day, at the center of every great city it is a great university, first and foremost. Higher education is the natural evolution for everything I've given my life toward.\"\n\nAgassi spent 20 minutes via the phone with the RGJ on Tuesday. Here's a portion of the interview.\n\nRGJ: You've been a pioneer at trying to get the state of education in Nevada in better standing. When did education become this important to you?\n\nAA: I found myself coming at education through the back door. I kind of fell into it. I was making a difference in children's lives in a lot of different ways during my career. In 1993, when I started my foundation, I was making a difference through after-school programs and with the Child Haven abuse shelter for kids and Assistance League, which clothes children. In tennis, I was a really quick study. But I was really coming quickly to the conclusion that I was behind with all of these children's problems and I was chasing them. It was frustrating. Being a tennis player, you want to be proactive and you don't want to be reactive. So, I reduced it to its core and looked at what the issue was and the issue for me was the societal opportunity for our next generation. If they believe and have hope, we can break the cycle, which is why I decided to take on the Herculean task of starting a K-12 charter school in a very economically challenged area to prove it's not the kids who fail, but the adults who fail the children.\n\nRGJ: You've opened yourself up to philanthropic giving. What feeling do you get when you accomplish some of these things you've been able to accomplish?\n\nAA: It's hard to quantify it. It's almost a selfish endeavor because it rewards you so much. It gives me my focus, my purpose, my meaning. There's a lot to be said for having that in life. Difficulty is guaranteed. Charity is truly a gift of jewels. It's gold in a person's life. I'm so clear on what I want to do. But it can't compare to anything inside the lines. Inside the lines, it's like Amnesia Road in many respects for me. I'll never forget the place tennis played in my life and the platform it's given. But it just feels like it's meant for a bigger endeavor and bigger objective, and I get to live that out every day now.\n\nRGJ: Is there a different feeling opening a new charter school and winning a tournament?\n\nAA: They are different. As a standalone, they both live in perpetuity. But one really has future implications, so there's no question a school stands in perpetuity and has untold accomplishments waiting to happen. If you change a child's life, you change the world. I would take that over a tournament win. But the feeling of opening a charter schools has similar feelings because it's feedback on time and effort put in. When you're on the court, the feedback is immediate. With a charter school, putting in all the money and capital you're changing a community over time and that's something you cherish even more because it doesn't happen as often. I've opened up 39 schools and held 60 trophies. My goal is out-achieve anything I've done on the tennis court.\n\nRGJ: When you think back to your career, do you have a favorite moment that sticks out above all else?\n\nAA: There's a sort of fundamental reality to winning all of the Grand Slam events (Agassi is one of only seven players to accomplish that). When I completed the Grand Slam, I knew there would be no more regrets in how my life played out. So, winning the French Open (1999) after coming back from No. 140 in the world to beating the defending champ to being down two sets in the finals, that was a microcosm of my life, and, as a result, that probably stands the test of time in my moments on the tennis court and my appreciation for it.\n\nRGJ: All great athletes have a competitive streak that doesn't go away when they retire. How have you gone about filling that competitive streak?\n\nAA: I hear that all the time and see that all the time with retired athletes. It's something I can identify with. Since I've retired, and I mean this in the greatest respect for the game because it gave me so much, but now it's sort of like holiday every day for me. When I say holiday, I don't mean relaxing. The great thing about retirement for me is I get work on the very things I want to. I've poured myself tirelessly into my ambitions and objectives and I get all this time to clear myself of all the drama that comes along with the tennis courts and get away from the physical and emotional and mental wear and tear, and it feels like a win on every shot in retirement.\n\nRGJ: You were recently quoted saying Rafael Nadal is the best tennis player ever. Why do you feel that way?\n\nAA: Let me first qualify it and say the great thing about the dialogue I had with that reporter from Singapore is she was very educated on tennis. It was a verbal discussion about the merits of who's better between Rafa and Roger (Federer). Some people made it out as I didn't have a healthy regard for Roger, which isn't even close to the case. But I have to be objective and give a fair answer when asked a fair question, which I was when asked who I thought was better between those two. It's a question everybody can debate, but in my estimation, there is no discussion to be had there. Roger separated himself from the field when he beat me in the finals, he beat Andy Roddick in the finals and Lleyton Hewitt in the finals. Everything Rafael has done, he's done through Roger's prime. He's gone against Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic in their prime. You can talk matchups all the time, but I can assure you everybody in the world has a matchup issue against Rafa. I had a matchup issue against Pete (Sampras). So did many others. You always have matchup issues against a better player.\n\nRGJ: Who would you put on your Mount Rushmore of the greatest tennis players ever?\n\nAA: The top four would be, not in any particular order, Nadal, (Rod) Laver, Federer and the fourth is absolutely an open case. I would leave the face uncarved for a few more years. You could debate (Bjorn) Borg if he had played longer. You could debate a lot of things. I'll leave the fourth on Mount Rushmore pure stone to be carved, maybe even carve it next year if Djokovic does what he's still capable of doing.\n\nRGJ: You had a very interesting childhood (Agassi's father taped ping-pong paddles to his hands to swat at a tennis ball mobile) and now you're a father of two. What's your favorite thing about being a father and how does your childhood change how you parent?\n\nAA: The greatest thing about being a father is it's the only relationship in your life that's truly unconditional. It's an opportunity to learn and teach and as my trainer (Gil Reyes) told me years ago, you only stop teaching when you stop learning. I pride myself in trying to understand my children and lead them to not need me. Unfortunately, by the time you figure that out, you're unemployed (as a parent). Any childhood anybody has, you learn what you want to be and what you don't want to be. Sometimes you spend so much time giving your kids what you didn't have that you forget to give them what you did have. I work very hard in processing what I've been through and making sure I take the good from it and pass it along.\n\nRGJ: Nevada doesn't have the best reputation. You proudly represent the state. What do you think of the future of this state and with you being a key member of this state what is the potential of the state?\n\nAA: First of all, I don't have any political aspirations. I'm doing my best to contribute to a state that has helped shape and mold me. That's one battle at a time. My focus is obviously education and it all starts here in Nevada. I speak proudly of Nevada because we're a state that survives, we're a state that dreams, we're a state that believes that if you dream it, then you can do it. We're hard-working and have an underbelly of culture that's unlike any state in the country. I love this state. Born and raised here. I could live anywhere in the world and brought my family here. My wife (tennis legend Steffi Graf) and her mother and her brother and their kids all live here, and we do so proudly.\n\nColumnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
