        "text": "His appearance at the Australian Open, although he had no official role, was met with excitement and reverence by fans, friends and former competitors, despite bowing out of tennis 18 years ago.\n\nAt the end of his first match, current world number one Novak Djokovic thanked his former coach and good friend who watched him triumph from the stands.\n\n\"I was inspired by your presence and overwhelmed to see you, so thank you,\" Djokovic declared to Agassi on Rod Laver Arena.\n\nClearly, Agassi keeps his eye on the ball, and the players.\n\nBack in January, he was quick to make this admiring and gracious observation of our controversial Nick Kyrgios who had withdrawn from the Australian Open due to a wrist injury.\n\n\"If he's healthy, his talent is as good as anybody's that's ever stepped on the court, quite frankly,\" Agassi said in an interview.\n\n\"His ability to control the pace of a game is remarkable.\n\n\"He can just slow down the game dramatically with his ball control and the way he can steal your time or the way he can give himself more time, and then he can also go right through you at any given moment. So that kind of arsenal is hard to contend with.\"\n\nAs we approached Melbourne Park, Agassi appraised the conditions as if he was competing.\n\nThis day was not as hot or windy as this Nevada desert rat preferred.\n\nAccompanied by a back wind in centre court a ball could be transformed into a weapon, he shared with me.\n\n'I call it a hate-love, not a love-hate. I definitely resented it early, watching what it did to the family dynamic at home'\n\nHe should know.\n\nAgassi won four Australian Open titles - Melbourne proving to be his most successful Grand Slam campaign in his 20 years of touring.\n\nThese are all fun facts for tennis devotees, of which you might expect this former world number one to be, except he's not.\n\nFor a big chunk of his playing days, Agassi loathed the game he seemed born to play.\n\n\"I call it a hate-love, not a love-hate. I definitely resented it early, watching what it did to the family dynamic at home\", remembers Agassi.\n\nHis father, Mike Agassi, was a controlling and domineering early coach to his young son before he sent him away at just 13 to the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy in Florida.\n\n\"At the time it felt like abandonment, but in hindsight it was way healthier for me than I think had I stayed under (my dad's) watchful eye,\" says Agassi.\n\nShoehorned into a career he never chose, Agassi was in a state of conflict for many years. His gift on the court resulted in extraordinary wins. His self-destructive streak ensured humiliating losses.\n\n'I just took what there was that was good and tried to take as much of it as possible, but it still left me quite empty.'\n\n\"There's also a lot of … contradiction in it because there were things that were enjoyable,\" Agassi explained.\n\n\"How can you say winning doesn't feel good, right? Because it does but enjoying something or reaping the benefits of something has really little to do with joy or peace with it.\n\n\"So from the outside you can say, 'Well, come on, you couldn't have really hated it, hated it?' And it's like, 'Well, no, I could. I could.'\n\n\"I just took what there was that was good and tried to take as much of it as possible, but it still left me quite empty.\"\n\nWhat saved the tennis champion's career was finally shrugging off his father's ambitions and finding his own purpose for playing.\n\nAgassi's epiphany came, not from a tennis court but from a classroom – or to be more accurate, the dream of building many classrooms for underprivileged kids who never had hope of a meaningful education.\n\nTo date, he has opened 130 such schools across the United States, helping 80,000 students a day.\n\n\"That's what brought me back: the ability to use tennis as a way to give children choice that really don't have choice in their life. They don't have the luxury of bitching about being number one in the world at something,\" he said.\n\n\"And if I could provide them education and through that give them hope and choice, it allowed me to see what was in front of me as opposed to being lost.\""
