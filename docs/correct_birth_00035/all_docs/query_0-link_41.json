        "text": "As the nation continues to try and process Sunday night’s shooting in Las Vegas where 59 people were killed and more than 500 injured, Andre Agassi delivered a strong message to his hometown.\n\nOff camera, the tennis star narrates a statement from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority about the city’s strength and ability to come together in a time of crisis. It concludes with #VegasStrong.\n\n“What is strength? Strength isn’t anger. Strength isn’t vengeful. Strength isn’t rage. Strength is unity.\n\n“Strength is valet parkers who become medics, mothers who become emergency responders, sisters who shield brothers because they love them with a love that has no bounds. Strength is first responders who tirelessly carry visitors and locals alike to safety until sunrise. It’s our medics and surgeons, all of them, who come running to the calls of those in need. It’s the police who turn over every stone to make this city safe again. It’s the local businesses that became sanctuaries for people to run to.\n\n“Strength isn’t evil or misguided. Strength is the voice of community and love in the face of the unspeakable. Strength is when we all pull together and rise up, all of us in every corner of this world. Strength is what we all are today, and strength is our promise for tomorrow.”"
