        "text": "Andre Agassi, (born April 29, 1970, Las Vegas, Nev., U.S.), U.S. tennis player. Agassi won the Wimbledon menâ€™s singles in 1992, the U.S. Open in 1994, and the Australian Open in 1995. At the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, he captured a gold medal, but by 1997 he had dropped to 141 in the international rankings. In 1999, however, he became the top-ranked player in the world. That year, he won the French Open to complete a career Grand Slam and captured a second U.S. Open title. He retired from professional tennis in 2006. Agassi, who married retired German tennis player Steffi Graf in 2001, was known for his aggressive style and demeanor on and off the court. In 2011 he was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame."
