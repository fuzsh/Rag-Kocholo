        "text": "The son of former Iranian Olympic boxer Emanoul “Mike” Aghasi, Andre Agassi was taught to play tennis by his father at a very young age. He turned pro in 1986, but was initially mostly known as a rebel, appearing with flamboyant clothing or hair styles, and refusing to play at Wimbledon because of the required dress code.\n\nBut his playing improved as well, and he helped the United States to win three Davis Cup titles. After three lost Grand Slam finals, he won his first major title at Wimbledon (1992). He eventually expanded his record to 60 ATP tour wins, eight Grand Slam titles (Singles: Australian Open (1995, 2000, 2001, 2003), French Open (1999), Wimbledon (1992), US Open (1994, 1999)) and the Olympic gold in 1996. As of 2020, Andre Agassi is one of eight men to have won all four Grand Slam events at least once."
