        "text": "Agassi was a prodigy when it came to the game of tennis. He had a natural skill that was impressive, and it showed itself when Agassi was still a toddler. He won his first professional tournament in 1987, when still just a teenager. Agassi was a unique athlete in the world of tennis. He had long hair, played with charisma, and always wore flashy clothes. Agassi played with power and looked like a star. He stood out in a sport that was known for how hard it held onto tradition.\n\nOutsider\n\nSome tennis traditionalists took issue with Agassi. They did not like his rebellious nature and look. There were also questions regarding the commitment he had to the sport. He would come up short in some big matches, and many felt he was more concerned about being a celebrity than a tennis player. In 1992, he showed his dedication to the sport when he took home his first Grand Slam title.\n\nNike\n\nAgassiâ€™s flair when it came to the sport, and fashion sense, caught the attention of Nike. The Swoosh would collaborate with the star on many shoes and apparel pieces. The Nike Air Tech Challenge 2 is probably the most beloved shoe to come from the Nike and Agassi relationship. Tinker Hatfield designed the Air Tech Challenge 2, and it is one of his top creations. Nike was growing as a powerhouse in the industry during the 1990s. Much of that growth was credited to basketball and Michael Jordan. Agassi helped Nike grow away from the hardwood court. He helped to diversify the Nike brand."
