        "text": "(born 1970). At age 18, tennis champion Andre Agassi became the youngest U.S. player to be ranked number one in the world. He first won at Wimbledon in 1992, the U.S. Open in 1994, and the Australian Open in 1995. When he won the French Open in 1999, he became the fifth man in tennis history to win all four Grand Slam events. Bred on the Las Vegas Strip, he was an entertainer on the court, tossing his trademark denim shorts and kisses to fans.\n\nAgassi was born on April 29, 1970, in Las Vegas, Nev. By the age of 2, he could serve a tennis ball on a full court, and at age 13 he was sent to a tennis academy in Bradenton, Fla. In 1987 Agassi won his first professional tournament. With six tournament wins in 1988, the right-hander with the powerful forehand began attracting attention.\n\nIn 1992 Agassi triumphed at Wimbledon to take his first Grand Slam title. In 1994, after being dropped by his coach—who had questioned Agassi’s dedication to the sport—and falling out of the top 30 in the rankings, he returned with a new coach and a more focused game. Agassi entered the U.S. Open that year unseeded; when he won, it was the first time that an unseeded player had taken the U.S. Open since 1966. In January 1995 he claimed his third Grand Slam title at the Australian Open. He held the number one ranking for 30 consecutive weeks later that year."
