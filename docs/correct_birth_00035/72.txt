Andre Agassi was born in Las Vegas and began playing tennis from a young age.He showed promise in his support early on, winning the 1982 National Indoor Boys 14s Doubles Championships in Chicago. At the age of thirteen, he would be sent to Nick Bollettieriâ€™s Tennis Academy in Florida. After practicing for Nick, he allowed Andre to stay longer than the original three months, and for free. As a result, Agassi dropped out of school in ninth grade to play tennis full-time.

Andre would turn 16 and begin to perform in professional competitions. He completed his first tournament in La Quinta, California. By the end of 1986, he was ranked number 91 in the world. He would win the first top-level singles title in 1985, moving up to number 25. After that, he would go on to win six more tournaments in 1988. He would surpass $1 million in prize money from his performance. He was the fastest tennis player to reach that level in history. He held the record for the most consecutive victories by a male teenager, and he was third in the world.

Agassi would decide not to play in the Australian Open or Wimbledon due to the traditional white dress code that many would conform to. In the 1990s, he started the decade with a few near misses. He would reach his first Grand Slam final in 1990 in the French Open. Since then, he would earn more Grand Slam records and get number one in tennis in 1995.
