[View paper recognizing the substance in the air responsible for the calcination of metals, work on the composition of water, and excerpts (preface, table of elements, and caloric) from Elements of Chemistry. See also a searchable electronic edition of his Oeuvres at CNRS (French national center for scientific research) en Français.] William Henry Perkin obtained a provisional patent for the first aniline dye, later named mauveine, 1856.

Michel-Eugène Chevreul born 1786: dyes and color; stearin and margarine.\n\nMilestone in chemotherapy: injection of a chemical agent (later known as Salversan) into a syphilitic rabbit under the direction of Paul Ehrlich (who coined the term chemotherapy, applying it broadly to chemical treatments--not only of cancer), 1909.\n\nFriedrich Adolf Paneth born 1887: dating of rocks from helium formation Adolf Pinner born 1842: nicotine structure, organic synthesis.\n\nPrincipal Sources: Milestones in Chemistry Calendar, Copyright © 1996, remains the principal source of information; however, I have checked (and in some cases corrected) its birth dates. Chemical and Engineering News \"Top 75\" (75th anniversary issue, 1/12/98) and Biographical Encyclopedia of Scientists edited by John Daintith et al. (Institute of Physics, 2nd ed, 1994) are other important sources. Women in Chemistry and Physics : a Biobibliographic Sourcebook, edited by Louise S. Grinstein, Rose K. Rose, and Miriam H. Rafailovich and Notable Women in the Physical Sciences edited by Benjamin F. and Barbara S. Shearer have helped me to add several women to the calendar. The Illustrated Almanac of Science, Technology, and Invention by Raymond L. Francis is the source of several entries. Thanks to all interested readers who have suggested events for inclusion; Lucio Gelmini has been particularly helpful in this regard.\n\nDates are given according to the Gregorian calendar to the extent I could find them. (Note: this applies particularly to 19th-century Russians.)"
