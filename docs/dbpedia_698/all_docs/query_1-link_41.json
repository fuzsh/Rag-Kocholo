        "text": "Evert Augustus Duyckinck (1816-1878), editor and biographer, son of Evert and Harriet June Duyckinck, and the elder brother of George Long Duyckinck (1823-1863). Evert Duyckinck Sr., (1764?-1833) was a publisher of standard literature in New York City. Duyckinck's higher education: Columbia College B.A. (1835); John Anthon LLD, admitted to the bar (1837). Duyckinck did not practice law; instead like his father, he opted for a literary career which began by submitting articles to the New York Review. He married Margaret Wolfe Panton in 1840. Their marriage produced three sons Evert, George and Henry all of whom died young. Duyckinck jointly edited with Cornelius Mathews the Arturus, a Journal of Books and Opinions between 1840-1842. He edited the Literary World for Osgood Co. (1853). Evert with his brother George bought the Literary World (1853). They jointly edited it between 1848-1853. Together, the Duyckinck brothers edited the Cyclopaedia of American Literature (2 vols . 1855); Evert later revised it after the death of his brother George (2 volumes and supplement, 1866). Duyckinck edited other works and he compiled Irvingiana, Anecdotes and Traits of Washington Irving.\n\nGeorge Long Duyckinck (1823-1863), editor and biographer, was the younger brother of Evert Augustus Duyckinck. George followed the career choice of his brother by entering the literary world and by not practicing law. Besides editing the Literary World, his other accomplishments include a biography of George Herbert (1858).\n\nCollection consists of literary and general correspondence, diaries, notebooks, manuscripts of writings, memorabilia, and legal, financial, and business papers, 1830-1878, of E.A. Duyckinck and George L. Duyckinck. Also, correspondence, daybooks, account and receipt books, and journals, 1793-1833, of their father, Evert Duyckinck; papers, 1838-1889, of Margaret Wolfe Panton Duyckinck, wife of E.A. Duyckinck; papers, 1856-1869, of Henry Duyckinck, Evert Duyckinck, Jr., and George Duyckinck (sons of E.A. Duyckinck); papers, 1810-1851, of Sophia Roorbach; and papers of the Wolfe and Panton families. Includes manuscript of Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"The Old Manse\" (1846) and Herman Melville's \"Hawthorne and His Mosses (1850).\"\n\nThe Duyckinck family papers are arranged in thirteen series:\n\nThe Literary Correspondence consists of incoming letters to Evert A. Duyckinck and George L. Duyckinck in their capacity as editors of Arcturus, the Literary World and the Cyclopaedia of American Literature. The correspondence is from authors, including many important American authors of the antebelllum period, women authors, artists, clergy, poets, historians, and other associates and colleagues of the Duyckincks. There are a few draft replies from the Duyckinck brothers. Additional letters have been mounted in two published sets of the Cyclopaedia of American Literature.\n\nA peculiarity of the Literary Correspondence is the occasional appearance of non-literary or historical figures antedating the Duyckincks. These \"autographic items\" provide evidence of the somewhat artificial nature of the series; that is, it contains letters received as well as collected by the Duyckincks during their literary career.\n\nThe correspondents include: William Henry Appleton, George Bancroft, Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard, Phineas Taylor Barnum, Theodoric Romeyn Beck, Park Benjamin, Richard Bentley, Nicholas Biddle, John Bigelow, Mary Louise Booth, Anna Charlotte Lynch Botta, Henry Marie Brackenridge, Charles Frederick Briggs, Charles Astor Bristed, William Cullen Bryant, George Henry Calvert, Joseph Green Cogswell.

The papers were part of the Duyckinck Collection comprising, in addition to the family papers, some 15,000 books and 1,500 pamphlets relating to English and American literature collected by George Long Duyckinck (1823-1863), Evert Augustus Duyckinck (1816-1878) and their father Evert Duyckinck, printer, publisher, and book dealer in New York City.
