        "text": "Fey returns as Cady's AP calculus teacher, Ms. Norbury, and Tim Meadows reprises his role as high-school principal, Mr. Duvall.\n\nBut there's also a major cameo from another original cast member that was kept under wraps pre-release: Lindsay Lohan.\n\nLohan, who famously played Cady in the 2004 movie, pops up late in the remake as the moderator of the Illinois Mathletes competition between North Shore and Marymount.\n\nCady joins the Mathletes as punishment after taking ownership of the Plastics' Burn Book, which includes an untrue joke about Ms. Norbury being a drug pusher.\n\nIt's during the math competition that Cady realizes she lost focus of what matters and lost herself when she became frenemies with Regina. In order to solve the equation that ends up leading North Shore to win, Cady pushes aside her distracting crush on Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney) so she can recall Mr. Norbury's lesson on limits.\n\nAt one point, Lohan's character also makes a meta-joke about not knowing anything about Cady's life or her experience.\n\nEven though it's been 20 years since the film was released, Lohan continues to embrace her association with \"Mean Girls.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nIn the 2022 Netflix rom-com \"Falling for Christmas,\" Lohan sang \"Jingle Bell Rock,\" the song that Cady and the Plastics famously danced to during the winter talent show in \"Mean Girls.\"\n\nLohan told Jimmy Fallon that the \"Mean Girls\" nod was inadvertently her idea after she made a passing joke to the director and producers.\n\nLohan also reunited with \"Mean Girls\" costars for a 2022 Black Friday commercial for Walmart."
