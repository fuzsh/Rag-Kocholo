        "text": "The new Mean Girls film is a hit at the box office. So to celebrate the latest part of the franchise, here are facts about the original Mean Girls film from 2004 that might take you by surprise:\n\nðŸš¨ Warning: This post contains major spoilers. ðŸš¨\n\n1. Lindsay Lohan initially wanted to play Regina.\n\n2. Similarly, Rachel McAdams, who played Regina, first auditioned to play Cady.\n\n3. Fortunately, according to Mark Waters, Rachel may have gotten the role of Regina because she reportedly made Lindsay \"nervous.\"\n\n4. Rajiv Surendra, who played Kevin G, auditioned for Damian.\n\n5. Mean Girls was Amanda Seyfried's first movie.\n\n6. In an alternate world, though, Blake Lively would've played Amanda's character, Karen.\n\n7. The word \"fetch,\" which Gretchen (Lacey Chabert) tries to popularize, is supposed to be short for the word \"fetching.\"\n\n8. Regina's dig to Cady, \"So you agree? You think you're really pretty?\" was inspired by an experience Tina Fey actually had as a teenager.\n\n9. Jonathan Bennett, who played Aaron Samuels, didn't read the full script until he was on his way to shoot the movie.\n\n10. Tim Meadows hurt his hand before filming, so they wrote his character Principal Duvall's cast into the script.\n\n11. Lindsay Lohan, who was 17 when joining the movie, had to take high school classes on set.\n\n12. Rachel McAdams's Juicy Couture tracksuit in the film was stuffed with toilet paper.\n\n13. The costume designer intentionally dressed The Plastics...in plastic.\n\n14. In the story, the necklace Cady wears during her house party is supposed to be repurposed from the African bracelet she wears early in the movie.\n\n15. Cady's skirt was supposed to look like \"tissue paper coming out of a paper bag\" when she fell into the trash can.\n\n16. Damian almost didn't sing \"Beautiful\" by Christina Aguilera at the talent show because of trouble getting the songwriter's approval.\n\n17. Finally, Glen Coco, as mentioned in Damian's line \"You go, Glen Coco,\" is a real person. He's a childhood friend of Tina Fey's brother.\n\nShare This Article"
