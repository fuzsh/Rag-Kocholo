        "text": "Tina Fey spent the summers of 2002 and 2003 hunched over an old desk in the mildewy back room of a Fire Island rental home and wrote the script that became âMean Girls.â In the two decades since, Fey has turned her first and only released screenplay into an empire.\n\nThe original Paramount film, based on Rosalind Wisemanâs nonfiction book âQueen Bees and Wannabes,â earned $130 million during its 2004 theatrical run and helped make superstars of its cast, which included Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams.\n\nIn January, a movie musical adapted from the past iterations, and written by Fey, arrived in theaters. âI have so much gratitude that this movie seemed to stick with people,â Fey said."
