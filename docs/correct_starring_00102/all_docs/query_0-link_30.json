        "text": "The Mean Girls movie is making its return on Jan. 12, 2024 with returning actors Tina Fey and Tim Meadows.\n\nIn April of 2018, Fey brought the hit film to Broadway and is taking the musical production back to the movies with an all new film. The film is based on the Tony-nominated Broadway musical which ran from 2018 to 2021 and had 883 performances.\n\nSenior Rhia Basit is an avid Mean Girls and musical theater fan. She has seen both the original movie and the Broadway musical.\n\n“The adaptation from stage to screen is very challenging. It requires the application of both information from the movie and the musical to make it its own,” Basit said.\n\nA teaser of the film was shown at Taylor Swift’s concert movie, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” making it evident to viewers that the movie was to be a musical. Reneé Rapp will be playing Regina George in the upcoming film after previously playing the role on Broadway.\n\n“I’m a huge Renée Rapp fan, one of the main reasons I’m seeing the movie is for her. It would be a little weird if Lindsay Lohan was playing a high schooler,” Basit said.\n\nThe new movie features a brand new cast led by Angourie Rice, an Australian actress who will be taking on the lead role of Cady Heron. The new cast will allow for a more modernized take on the original film.\n\nAlthough Fey and Meadows are making their return, most of the iconic stars will not be making a large appearance. If anything, they would be featured in cameos for a short feature.\n\nAmanda Seyfried, who played Karen Smith in the first film, told Entertainment Tonight in February that she and her former co-stars are “100 percent into” making a cameo in the new movie.\n\nRegardless of whether or not the original cast makes an appearance, Fey is confident in her current, more modern cast.\n\n“We have an amazing cast,” Fey said during an appearance on Late Night With Seth Meyers.\n\nSimilar to the 2004 film, Teen Vogue says the new Mean Girls musical movie will follow the story of Cady Heron, a teenage student who’s just arrived at a new high school after growing up in the African savanna with her two zoologist parents.\n\nSenior Jackson Hartke hasn’t seen the Mean Girls musical but he is planning to watch the new movie.\n\n“I’m excited to see how they apply modern day standards to the story line,” Hartke said."
