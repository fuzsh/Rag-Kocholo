        "text": "Erika Henningsen is re-teaming with Tina Fey on the latter’s upcoming Netflix series “The Four Seasons,” Variety has learned exclusively.\n\nHenningsen and Fey previously worked together on the Broadway musical version of “Mean Girls,” for which Fey wrote the book based on the movie of the same name she also wrote. Henningsen originated the role of Cady Heron in the original Broadway production. Henningsen also recurred in “Girls5Eva,” the Peacock series that recently moved to Netflix, on which Fey is an executive producer.\n\nHenningsen will star opposite Fey in the series as well as Steve Carell and Colman Domingo. The show is based on the 1981 film of the same name that was directed by and starred Alan Alda with Carol Burnett, Rita Moreno, Sandy Dennis, and Len Cariou also among the cast members. The series was first announced in January with an eight-episode order and is slated to begin production later this year.\n\nIn the film, three married couples take vacations together each season, but things are thrown for a loop when one of the husbands leaves his wife and begins bringing a younger woman with him. It was previously adapted into a 1984 TV series for CBS.\n\nIn addition to her roles in “Mean Girls” and “Girls5Eva,” Henningsen has also appeared in shows like “Harlem,” “That Damn Michael Che,” “Blue Bloods,” and the animated series “Hazbin Hotel.”\n\nShe is repped by Authentic Talent and Literary Management and Felker Toczek.\n\nIn addition to starring, Fey co-created “The Four Seasons” along with Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield. All three previously worked together on the beloved NBC sitcom “30 Rock.” All three also executive produce along with David Miner, Eric Gurian and Jeff Richmond. Alda and Marissa Bregman, whose father produced the film, will also produce the series. Universal Television, where Fey and her Little Stranger, Inc. banner are set up under an overall deal, will produce."
