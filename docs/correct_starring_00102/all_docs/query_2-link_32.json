So, I'm just excited to see her incarnation,” McAdams added. “It's such a great character. It's so much fun to play, so, I hope she has a great time with it. And I can't wait to see it.\"\n\nWhen it comes to whether the OG Regina would make a cameo in the new film, McAdams teased she would “never” say no to Fey “ever.” She gushed over the movie’s creator, saying, “She’s the greatest. So, we’ll see how it all shakes out.”\n\nCredit: MOVI Inc.\n\nWill ‘MEAN GIRLS’ Feature the Full Broadway Soundtrack?\n\nRapp exclusively told Us Weekly in April 2023 that there will be some changes to both the script and track list. \"A lot of it is different. Tina [Fey] is such a creative genius and such a creative freak, and her partner, Jeff Richmond, who does all of the music, is as well. So there's definitely different things,\" Rapp hinted. \"There might be different songs. Some songs that are in the musical version might be in the movie or might not be.\"\n\nCredit: Jojo Whilden/Paramount\n\nWhat Songs Are Featured on the ‘MEAN GIRLS’ Track List?\n\nUnveiled in January 2024, the film’s official track list features many of the Broadway show’s biggest songs, including Janis and Damian’s opening number, “A Cautionary Tale,” and the Plastics’ entrance tune, “Meet the Plastics.” Additional songs that made the cut include “Stupid With Love,” “Apex Predator,” “What’s Wrong With Me,” “Sexy,” “Someone Gets Hurt,” “Revenge Party,” “World Burn,” “I’d Rather Be Me” and “I See Stars.”\n\nOther songs from the original musical will not appear in the film adaptation, including several reprises, the Act I closer “Fearless,” Damian’s numbers “Where Do You Belong” and “Stop,” the party track “Whose House Is This?,” Cady and Aaron’s “More Is Better” duet and the Mathletes’ competition song “Do This Thing.”\n\nCady's introductory song, “It Roars,” appears to have been replaced with a new track titled “What Ifs.” The Mean Girls album also features “Not My Fault,” Rapp’s new collaboration with Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nIn order to view the gallery, please allow Manage Cookies\n\nFor access to all our exclusive celebrity videos and interviews – Subscribe on YouTube!"
