        "text": "Mean Girls writer (and star) Tina Fey is revealing why they chose to include a cameo with one of the original film's actors.\n\nAfter basically earning its production budget back during its opening weekend, the 2024 musical version of Mean Girls has proven that there's still a devoted audience that's willing to support the timeless teen flick, which was kind of expected. What we didn't completely anticipate was a cameo with an original cast member, and now the two-time Mean Girls scribe is explaining her thoughts on the well-received cameo. This is a spoiler, so if you don't want to know who is returning for a cameo, don't scroll beyond this image.\n\n[SPOILERS]'s Mean Girls Cameo\n\nIn conversation with Entertainment Weekly, Mean Girls writer Tina Fey discussed the sneaky cameo that brought back the original Cady for a mathletes moment, telling the site, \"Paramount was like, 'Can you get any of the original ladies? And I was like, 'I can't fit five people in.' I felt like if I could only get one person as a surprise, the original movie is really Lindsay [Lohan] 's movie. As great as they all are, she's the heart of that movie. And I thought, well, what could she do? I didn't think [she should] play a teacher. I was trying to think of something that you wouldn't expect. And just to have her do that late in the movie, it also feels like it comes, I hope, at a time where fans weren't expecting one more little surprise. It also lets her be smart, which Cady is.\"\n\nThe film's synopsis reads, \"From the comedic mind of Tina Fey comes a new twist on the modern classic, MEAN GIRLS. New student Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) is welcomed into the top of the social food chain by the elite group of popular girls called \"The Plastics,\" ruled by the conniving queen bee Regina George (Rene√© Rapp) and her minions Gretchen (Bebe Wood) and Karen (Avantika). However, when Cady makes the major misstep of falling for Regina's ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney), she finds herself prey in Regina's crosshairs. As Cady sets to take down the group's apex predator with the help of her outcast friends Janis (Auli'i Cravalho) and Damian (Jaquel Spivey), she must learn how to stay true to herself while navigating the most cutthroat jungle of all: high school.\"\n\nThe new musical interpretation of Mean Girls is in theaters now."
