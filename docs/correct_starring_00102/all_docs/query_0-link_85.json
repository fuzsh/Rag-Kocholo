        "text": "Lindsay Lohan made a surprise appearance at the Mean Girls red carpet premiere in New York City. The actress, who starred in the original 2004 film, posed for pictures with creator Tina Fey as well as the rest of the cast of the musical adaptation.\n\nAngourie Rice, is the actress that plays Lohan’s role in the 2024 film. Reneé Rapp, Auli’i Cravalho, Bebe Wood, Busy Philipps and Megan Thee Stallion were also on the red carpet.\n\nBravo stars and Giggly Squad podcast hosts Paige DeSorbo and Hannah Berner also showed their support for the new film.\n\nWhile on the red carpet, Deadline talked to Rice about stepping into the role of Cady Heron, calling Lohan’s performance one of her favorites.\n\n“In my mind, [Lohan’s performance] was always there, and I hope this performance is adding to the legacy of Cady Heron,” Rice said.\n\nRice also noted that Fey gave them “freedom to work with the characters” and allowed the actors to make suggestions on their lines.\n\nChristopher Briney, who plays Aaron Samuels, talked about the film getting a theatrical release after it was originally going to only stream on Paramount+.\n\n“It’s sick,” Briney told Deadline. “That seems like a vote of confidence by Paramount, and it’s cool [that] I can go to AMC and see the movie. It’s a dream for a lot of us.”\n\nMean Girls is directed by Samantha Jayne and Arturo Pérez Jr. from a screenplay by Tina Fey. The adaptation is based on the Broadway musical of the same name, which in turn is based on Mark Waters’s 2004 film, based on a script written by Fey, based on Rosalind Wiseman’s 2002 book Queen Bees and Wannabes.\n\nScroll through the photo gallery below from the red carpet premiere."
