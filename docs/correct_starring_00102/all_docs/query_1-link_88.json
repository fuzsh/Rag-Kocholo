        "text": "Get in, high schools - we're licensing Mean Girls High School Version! Consider this your invitation from Regina George herself to license the fiercely hilarious musical from book writer Tina Fey (30 Rock), lyricist Nell Benjamin (Legally Blonde) and composer Jeff Richmond (Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt). Mean Girls High School Version is an exclusive opportunity for high schools and youth theatre groups in the U.S. and Canada to perform the show and tailor the show's content according to your preference.\n\nCady Heron may have grown up on an African savanna, but nothing prepared her for the wild and vicious ways of her strange new home: suburban Illinois. How will this naïve newbie rise to the top of the popularity pecking order? By taking on The Plastics, a trio of lionized frenemies led by the charming but ruthless Regina George. But when Cady and her friends devise a \"Revenge Party\" to end Regina’s reign, she learns the hard way that you can’t cross a Queen Bee without getting stung.\n\nAdapted from Fey's hit 2004 film, Mean Girls was nominated for a staggering 12 Tony Awards. This queen-bee took Broadway by storm and has joined the musical in-crowd. And now, so can you with Mean Girls High School Version!\n\nRead this note from author Tina Fey and MTI about Mean Girls High School Version and approved changes you can make for your production here.\n\nWatch our Mean Girls High School Version Town Hall here.\n\nListen to the Broadway Cast Album"
