        "text": "Her name is Regina George, and she is a massive deal. Renee Rapp shines as the leader of “The Plastics” in the official trailer for Mean Girls, the upcoming adaptation of the Broadway musical, which itself was an adaptation of the original 2004 Tina Fey film. And guess which 20-year-old pop princess’ music is featured? Miss Olivia Rodrigo herself.\n\nThe new teaser jumps from second-person point of view — with Rapp saying in character, “You could be really hot if you changed, like, everything” — to dynamic shots of the “Snow Angel” singer leading her squad of Queen Bees, Gretchen (played by Bebe Wood) and Karen (played by Avantika). Other stars featured in the trailer are The Summer I Turned Pretty‘s Chris Briney as Aaron Samuels, Moana‘s Auliʻi Cravalho as Janis and The Office‘s Jenna Fischer as Mrs. Heron, with Fey returning as Ms. Norbury and Tim Meadows as Principal Duvall.\n\nReleased by Paramount Wednesday (Nov. 8), the trailer includes all the hallmarks of the original Mean Girls, from the lipstick-kissed “Burn Book” to the sexy Santa-themed talent show dance performed by Regina, Gretchen, Karen and new girl/leading lady Cady Heron (played by Angourie Rice). It also promises to put a modern twist on the story, with iPhones, TikTok and Instagram Live taking on a major roles.\n\nAnd true to the original, the newest version of Mean Girls is guaranteed to have a lot of chaos, making Rodrigo’s raucous Guts single “Get Him Back!” the perfect song to soundtrack the trailer. The sync comes just after the “Drivers License” singer lent an original track called “Can’t Catch Me Now” to the upcoming Hunger Games installment, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\n\nMean Girls arrives in theaters Jan. 12, 2024. Watch the trailer above."
