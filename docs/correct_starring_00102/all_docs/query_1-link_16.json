        "text": "Tina Fey and Tim Meadows had one condition when agreeing to reprise their roles in the new musical version of ‘Mean Girls’.\n\nThe new movie, which is now playing in theaters, is set twenty years after the first movie, and introduces a new set of Plastics, with Reneé Rapp as the iconic Regina George, Angourie Rice as Cady Heron, Bebe Wood as Gretchen Wieners, and Avantika as Karen.\n\nIt also stars 'Moana' actress Auli’i Cravalho as Janis Ian and Jaquel Spivey as Damian.\n\nAlthough none of the original cast is reprising their roles, aside from Fey and Meadows, fans of the 2004 movie are still stoked to see the musical version, which is based on the Broadway musical of the same name.\n\nTina Fey and Tim Meadows Refused To Sing In New ‘Mean Girls’ Musical\n\nFey and Meadows portray Ms. Norbury and Principal Duvall in the original 2004 film and agreed to once again step into the shoes of the school employees for ‘Mean Girls: The Musical’, but they said they would only do so if they were not required to sing.\n\n\"I am reprising my role as Ms. Norbury because we thought, well, teachers work for a long time. So it might make sense if Tim and I did it,\" she told PEOPLE. \"So I called Tim and I was like, 'Will you do it? I'll do it if you do it.' And we said yes, as long as we don't have to sing.\"\n\n\"It was fun. It's been nice to see Tim,\" Fey adds of her co-star. \"One of us has aged — the other one of us is Tim Meadows! But it's been really nice to get to work with Tim again.\"\n\nThe comedian/actress added how much the ‘Mean Girls’ franchise means to her and how she loves to “be a part of it.”\n\n“I'm so thrilled about this cast that has come together for the new ‘Mean Girls’,” Fey said, who wrote the script for the original film, the Broadway musical, and the new movie musical.\n\n\"Bringing together a cast of actors is one of my favorite parts of the process, whether it's in film, television, or stage,” she added.\n\n'Moana' star Auli’i Cravalho, who is portraying Janis Ian in the new musical version, expressed what it was like to star in an adaption of such an iconic movie.\n\n“I’m a friend and a fan of the original, and I’m not looking to remake the perfection that is Mean Girls from ’04,” the 23-year-old told PEOPLE at the premiere earlier this week. “But when Tina Fey is a part of a project that is a re-imagination of ‘Mean Girls’ that also incorporates music from the Broadway musical, my little theater kid was over the moon. I was so excited to be a part of this.”\n\nWill Fans See A ‘Mean Girls 2’ With The Original Cast?\n\nIn the past, Lindsay Lohan and Lacey Chabert have both said they would be interested in doing a sequel to the 2004 film, and Daniel Franzese, who played Damien in the first movie, has confirmed that Lohan and Chabert are not the only ones.\n\n“We all want it,” Franzese told PEOPLE regarding the original cast when at the movie's premiere earlier this week. “You got to tell the boss lady [Tina Fey] over there. I'm sure [she's] heard it a million times, but she's the gatekeeper, so we're all waiting.”\n\n“We all talk when we can,” the actor added of their current relationship with one another. “It's very difficult. We were all really busy, but I love them also.”\n\n‘Mean Girls: The Musical’ is currently playing in theaters."
