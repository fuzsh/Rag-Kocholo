        "text": "Such minute details would be ridiculed by our snarky, fun narrators, Damian Hubbard (Jaquel Spivey of Broadway’s “A Strange Loop”) and Janis ‘Imi’ike (Auli’i Cravalho, the voice of Disney’s Moana). Their job is to guide newcomer Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) and, by extension, the viewer, through the hellish high-school rite of passage known as cliques. As in the original, Damian is explicitly gay (Janis’s snide comment that he’s “almost too gay to function” remains in this version), but unlike the first film, Janis is more clearly defined as a lesbian here.\n\nUntil now, Cady had been homeschooled in Kenya by her mother (Jenna Fischer). This explains why she occasionally imagines her classmates acting like wild animals. High school is a jungle, right? And as one of the catchy songs mentions, Regina George (Reneé Rapp, reprising her Broadway role) is the “apex predator.”\n\nRegina is the leader of the Plastics, the hottest clique in school. Her abused toadies are the insecure Gretchen Wieners (Bebe Wood), who fears the day Regina won’t like her anymore, and Karen Shetty (Avantika), who’s stereotypically stupid but at least has a few shreds of empathy for others. Cady accepts Regina’s unexpected offer of a trial run with her crew, if only so she can execute Janis’s plan to destroy the group from within. Back in sixth grade, Regina played a cruel, homophobic joke on Janis and, to quote Janis’s big musical number, a “revenge party” is in order.\n\nCady makes the grade and becomes an official Plastic. Her membership soon interferes with her lust for Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney), Regina’s ex. She also must decline a rightful place on the Math Club competition team because its lack of cool conflicts with her newfound Regina-adjacent glory. Power corrupts, and Cady becomes the type of mean girl she’s supposed to be defeating.\n\nSongwriters Jeff Richmond and Nell Benjamin introduce Regina by giving her the showstopping verses of the song “Meet the Plastics.” Aided by editor Andrew Marcus, who cuts this sequence as if it were a seduction, Rapp commands the screen. When she sings that she’s a “massive deal,” you believe her. Directors Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr. stage all the musical numbers with energetic choreography and sly humor, but Regina’s songs are the movie’s highlights.\n\nThe directing duo is less successful when they frame scenes as TikTok or phone videos. Maybe it’s just me, but I wish filmmakers would realize how uninteresting and flat that aspect ratio looks on a big screen. I know it’s an attempt to contemporize the story, but visually it’s the equivalent of putting a Tylenol caplet on an iPad.\n\nMore successful upgrades of the material occur on the screenplay level. Gone is the subplot about Coach Carr (played here by Jon Hamm) sleeping with students. Also absent is the prior film’s extraneous use of the N-word. But don’t worry! Someone still gets hit by that speeding school bus.\n\nThough I enjoyed both films, I had the same problem with this “Mean Girls” as I did with the original: I didn’t know whom to root for as the story played out. Though she gives a good performance and sings her few songs with gusto, Rice as Cady is not as charismatic as Lohan. Plus, it feels like this movie likes Regina best. She gets more numbers than anyone else besides Damian and Janis.\n\nFey’s “SNL” cohort Tim Meadows also reprises his role from the 2004 film, though his Principal Duvall is now in a relationship with her Ms. Norbury. Seeing them together evokes memories of their earlier scenes. Duvall even wears the carpal-tunnel cast on his wrist.\n\nSince it’s practically the same movie as its predecessor, “Mean Girls” engenders a mild sense of futility. But if you really want to be jarred out of complacency, consider that the first Regina George, Rachel McAdams, is now playing the mother of the tween from “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret.” Now that, my friends, is fetch.\n\n★★★\n\nMEAN GIRLS\n\nDirected by Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr. Written by Tina Fey, based on her book for the Broadway musical. Starring Reneé Rapp, Jaquel Spivey, Auli’i Cravalho, Angourie Rice, Jenna Fischer, Bebe Wood, Avantika, Jon Hamm, Christopher Briney. At AMC Boston Common, Landmark Kendall Square, Alamo Drafthouse Seaport, AMC Causeway, suburbs. 112 minutes. PG-13 (get in, loser, and observe teens drinking and cussing)\n\nOdie Henderson is the Boston Globe's film critic."
