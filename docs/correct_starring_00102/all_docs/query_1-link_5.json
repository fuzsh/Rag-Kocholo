        "text": "\"We'll never know [what their roles would have looked like].\"\n\nTina Fey has discussed the difficulties behind trying to get the original Mean Girls cast members to have cameos in the new version of the iconic film.\n\nOriginal cast members Tina and Tim Meadows reprise their roles as Ms. Norbury and Principal Duvall in the musical remake, but all the other characters are played by brand new actors.\n\nBack in February 2023, Amanda Seyfried revealed that all four original Plastics were interested in appearing in the film but unfortunately, it never worked out. (Amanda, Lindsay Lohan, and Lacey Chabert later reunited for a Walmart Black Friday commercial.)\n\nRachel McAdams also recently teased that she and Tina \"dabbled with a few ideas\" about who she could play, but said that \"it was tough to make it all work in the end.\"\n\nHere's what Tina herself has said about trying to cast the OGs in the new film....\n\nBased on the quotes Tina has given in interviews so far, it seems like there's two main reasons why the original Plastics, as well as the likes of Lizzy Caplan (Janis) and Daniel Franzese (Damian), didn't make a return.\n\nThe first reason is that Tina just couldn't really make it work with everyone having a surprise cameo or role. \"Paramount was like, 'Can you get any of the original ladies? And I was like, 'I can't fit five people in,'\" Tina told Entertainment Weekly.\n\nThe second is that they were all too busy to make it work with the production schedule. During a chat with The New York Times, Tina said: \"We'll never know [what their roles would have looked like]. They're busy people, so it didn't come together, but we tried, and we all love each other.\"\n\nIn another interview with Entertainment Tonight, Tina also joked: \"Those guys are like Oscar nominees, we can't afford them.\"\n\nThere was, however, one original member of the Plastics that she did manage to secure... [Spoilers ahead!]\n\nLindsay Lohan, the original Cady Heron herself, appears in the film as the host of the Mathletes competition towards the end of the film.\n\nSpeaking about securing Lindsay for the role, Tina told EW: \"I felt like if I could only get one person as a surprise, the original movie is really Lindsay's movie. As great as they all are, she's the heart of that movie.\"\n\n\"And I thought, well, what could she do? I didn't think [she should] play a teacher. I was trying to think of something that you wouldn't expect. And just to have her do that late in the movie, it also feels like it comes, I hope, at a time where fans weren't expecting one more little surprise. It also lets her be smart, which Cady is.\"\n\nRead more about Mean Girls here:\n\nTina Fey explains why she changed multiple jokes in new Mean Girls movie\n\nLindsay Lohan \"very hurt and disappointed\" over joke in new Mean Girls movie\n\nMean Girls' Reneé Rapp divides internet after saying she is \"very ageist\" in viral video\n\nRachel McAdams explains why she turned down Mean Girls reunion\n\nMean Girls almost had a \"completely different\" ending"
