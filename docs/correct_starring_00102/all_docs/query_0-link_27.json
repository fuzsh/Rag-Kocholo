        "text": "Tina Fey’s not a regular mom — she’s a cool mom.\n\nBut she needs her kids’ help with that.\n\nFey is back with the musical adaptation of her hit 2004 comedy “Mean Girls,” but 20 years after the OG high school film hit the theaters, she grappled with Gen Z references.\n\nTo adapt the film into a new story for the teens of today, Fey, 53, asked daughters Alice, 18, and Penelope, 12, for their assistance in putting a new spin on the movie.\n\n“I do sometimes run things by my kids,” the “Saturday Night Live” alum recently told USA Today about the movie, premiering Friday, Jan. 12.\n\n“Early on, there was conversation of, ‘Would the Burn Book still be a physical book or should it be a private Instagram?’\n\n“I knew what my instinct was, but I ran it by my kids,” she confessed. “And my older daughter was like, ‘Yeah, no. Don’t let those millennials overthink it!'” she joked.\n\nThe musical — adapted from the original film and a 2018 Broadway musical, both written by Fey — includes a major focus on smartphones, social media and TikTok-style routines.\n\nWhile there are just a few Gen Z phrases thrown into the mix, according to the publication, symbols from the original film — like the infamous “Burn Book” and the yummy Kälteen bars — are still included.\n\nFey is reprising her 2004 role of math teacher Mrs. Norbury, and Tim Meadows — who portrayed Principal Duvall — is also returning.\n\nAngourie Rice portrays new-gal-at-school Cady Heron — a role originally played by Lindsay Lohan — while Reneé Rapp is playing queen bee Regina George, first performed by Rachel McAdams.\n\nAuliʻi Cravalho, Jenna Fisher, Christopher Briney, Busy Philipps, Ashley Park and Jon Hamm help round out the cast.\n\nThe film’s premiere went down in New York City on Monday, where original star Lohan even showed up on the screening’s fetching pink carpet.\n\n“It’s stood the test of time,” Lohan, 37, told “Entertainment Tonight” about the iconic story.\n\n“I feel really grateful. I mean, it’s not very often that you have all these movies that do that,” she said. “‘Mean Girls’ really opened the doors for a lot of things going on in schools. I think it’s also a really fun movie, so it’s really a blessing.”"
