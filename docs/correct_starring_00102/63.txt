“Little Broadway c***s on TikTok [are] complaining about two lines of ‘Revenge Party’,” said the comedian. She did not specify to which two lines she is referring.

Fey continued: “I bring you fucking Renée Rapp, I bring you Auli’i Cravalho, Jaquel Spivey.”

She added: “This is why we can’t have nice things.”

Fey reprised her role as the clumsy but caring maths teacher Ms Norbury for the revival, joined by Tim Meadows, returning in his role as Principal Duvall.

In a three-star review of the movie, NME said it was “a film that’s more rehash than remodel, albeit a perfectly entertaining one. Where the original Mean Girls had the sparky, snarky confidence of Regina George, this one is more like Gretchen Wieners: less sure of itself, a bit try-hard, but ultimately quite likeable.”
