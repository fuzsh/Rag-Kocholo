Former Boston Celtics forward Gerald Green is calling it a career.

Green, 35, announced his retirement from the NBA in a press conference Friday. The C's 18th overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft will join the Houston Rockets' staff as a player development coach.

Green spent two seasons in Boston after being drafted in '05, notably winning the 2007 Slam Dunk Contest during his Celtics tenure. Later in his career, he rejoined the C's for a second stint in 2016-17.

A journeyman during his 15-year NBA career, Green also played for the Rockets, Minnesota Timberwolves, Dallas Mavericks, New Jersey Nets, Indiana Pacers, Phoenix Suns, and Miami Heat.
