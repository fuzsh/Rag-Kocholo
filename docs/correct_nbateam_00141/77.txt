Who is Gerald R. Flurry?

Gerald Flurry is the pastor general of the Philadelphia Church of God and editor in chief of the Philadelphia Trumpet news magazine.

He is also presenter of the Key of David television program which airs all around the world and on radio. He has been an ordained minister for over 40 years. He is also chancellor of Herbert W. Armstrong College and chairman of the Armstrong International Cultural Foundation.

Gerald Flurry was ordained a minister in the Worldwide Church of God, which was founded by Herbert W. Armstrong. While in the WCG he was the pastor for the Oklahoma City and Enid, Oklahoma, congregations. He was excommunicated on December 7, 1989 for resisting extensive doctrinal changes that moved away from the example set by WCG founder Herbert W. Armstrong.

Gerald Flurry could see the disconcerting changes occurring before most realized they were happening. He wrote Malachi’s Message to make the changes known to the WCG ministry and, secondarily, the membership. Gerald Flurry and his assistant John Amos were fired after a draft of the book was presented to the WCG administration. He immediately founded the Philadelphia Church of God.

Since then Mr. Flurry has preached the wonderful news that Jesus Christ will return to save mankind in this generation. He also delivers a warning message related to the doctrinal changes in God’s Church.
