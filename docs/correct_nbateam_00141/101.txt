Now unretired and no longer a member of Houston’s coaching staff, Gerald Green isn’t eligible to play with the Rockets in the 2021-22 NBA season due to salary cap circumvention rules and the fact he was already on the team’s payroll as a player development coach.

That doesn’t mean the team can’t use its resources to help the longtime fan favorite potentially earn an NBA opportunity elsewhere.

To that end, Shams Charania of The Athletic reported Friday that Green is joining the Rio Grande Valley Vipers, Houston’s NBA G League affiliate. If he plays well, the 35-year-old could become a candidate for a 10-day contract from some other NBA team, since clubs are giving those out much more frequently this season due to COVID-19 absences.

Even if Green was an option to join the Rockets, he wouldn’t be an ideal fit, anyway, in a season that is primarily about evaluating younger options who could contribute in the years ahead.

Thus, the Rockets are working with the native Houstonian — and a beloved role player and bench sharpshooter from the 2017-18 and 2018-19 teams — to help him find a basketball fit that works.
