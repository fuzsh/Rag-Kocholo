        "text": "The agent for the Timberwolves' seldom-used swingman, Gerald Green, an ex-Celtic, hopes to get his client a better playing opportunity in another NBA uniform.\n\nGreen's agent, Byron Irvin, told the Globe yesterday that he asked Wolves vice president of basketball operations Kevin McHale and general manager Jim Stack in early January if they would trade his client. Green is making $1.4 million this season and the Wolves have declined his option for next season, thus making him an unrestricted free agent this summer. The trading deadline is Feb. 21.\n\n\"I thought it was going to be a formality that they wanted to take his option, especially since he is a player coming out of high school,\" said Irvin, an ex-NBA player who is Celtics coach Doc Rivers's cousin, in a telephone interview. \"His first year he averaged 5 points and his second year he averaged 10. You can see the development and the growth.\n\n\"When they didn't take the option, the first question I had immediately is whether he is in Minnesota's long-term goals. You have to give that time to answer the question. And after he hasn't played much through 41 games, I would have to say the answer to that question is no.\"\n\nhttp://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/ce..._wants_a_trade/\n\nWouldn't mind getting him on the Warriors as long as he doesn't cost too much. Any athletic swingman who can shoot the ball will probably do well in our system. Is his attitude an issue though? I just can't make sense of why Minny wouldn't play him unless he a) really really sucks, has attitude problems, or c) is extremely lazy and has bad work ethic.\n\n<div class='quotetop'>QUOTE (kobe23 @ Jan 26 2008, 10:04 AM) <{POST_SNAPBACK}></div><div class='quotemain'>Odom for green? any takers? Minny is well under the cap and would welcome a \"bonified star\" like lamar</div>I was thinking the same thing. The only issue is that the Lakers would lose another frontcourt player, and they really can't afford that. They're already low on frontcourt players and losing Odom, as inconsistent as he is, wouldn't help the team at this point.\n\n<div class='quotetop'>QUOTE (kobe23 @ Jan 26 2008, 11:04 AM) <{POST_SNAPBACK}></div><div class='quotemain'>Odom for green? any takers? Minny is well under the cap and would welcome a \"bonified star\" like lamar</div>\n\nMinny wouldn't want to destroy any and all cap flexibility with Lamar and his terrible contract. The last thing they need is a glorified role player on a max contract. They already have a stud combo forward in Gomes who's averaging 17/7 in the month of January starting alongside Jefferson. Hes not mentally weak and inconsistent like Odom and hes a lot younger and cheaper.\n\nSee, I honestly think that Lamar would be much better on a team that doesn't have him in the limelight so often. Just look at him in Miami. Nothing was expected of that team and he put up his best numbers as a pro that year. He also put up great numbers (when healthy) as a Clipper. He just hasn't been able to figure it out in LA. He never seems to put together a complete game, and right now, it's hurting the Lakers. Plus, he's got a massive contract coming off the books after next season anyways, so you'd only be stuck with him for a year and a half. You also have to realize that cap flexibility isn't going to help you if you're a bad team. Not all horrendous teams get lucky like the Hawks and manage to land a franchise-esque player through free agency.\n\n<div class='quotetop'>QUOTE (Moo2K4 @ Jan 26 2008, 12:16 PM) <{POST_SNAPBACK}></div><div class='quotemain'><div class='quotetop'>QUOTE (kobe23 @ Jan 26 2008, 10:04 AM) <{POST_SNAPBACK}></div><div class='quotemain'>Odom for green? any takers?

That would be around 10M in cap space + 6M in cash from kwame's contract.\n\nIm sure the Lakers would gladly pay luxury tax if it were for ap layer like Brand\n\nWhy Brand? Ya'll know what he is capable of with a good C playing alongside him, and that would only be helpful to Bynum's development since Brand wont deteriorate Drew's game.\n\nOr we could send Kwame + Radman for Brand to the Clips. Its bettwe than letting Brand walk away for nothing right?\n\nWe get rid of odom, and kwame (if not him then his contract) and complet our championship team LOL\n\nNote: i'm currently smoking some weed right now LOL\n\n<div class='quotetop'>QUOTE (Run BJM @ Jan 26 2008, 12:03 PM) <{POST_SNAPBACK}></div><div class='quotemain'>I just can't make sense of why Minny wouldn't play him unless he a) really really sucks, has attitude problems, or c) is extremely lazy and has bad work ethic.</div>\n\nd) the coach has a vendetta against him\n\nI'll go with d.

I think CB32 and POTG are the same people or boyfriend and girlfriend.\n\nTommy Heinsohn: \"When GG gets hot, he could go for 40, thats the type of shooter he is, hes a terrific scorer.\"\n\nFEAR\n\n<div class='quotetop'>QUOTE (Chutney @ Jan 26 2008, 06:15 PM) <{POST_SNAPBACK}></div><div class='quotemain'>I don't think a single word of that post was convincing in any way.</div>\n\nIt wasn't, especially since he tried to use Tommy Heinsohn, the man who labels every Celtic in team history a future star, for a backup reference. In the beginning of the 05-06 season, Tommy also said \"I firmly believe that the Celtics are going to have a better record than the Pistons at the end of the season.\" The result? Detroit won 64 games while Boston won 33. Tommy also said Orien Greene was going to be a \"terrific player\" and a big time 3-point threat in a couple years. He is not out of the league and still can't shoot a lick.\n\nAnd for the record, Gerald Green is not better than Tony Allen for the simple fact that TA actually specializes in something and does it well - play defense. Gerald does nothing well other than dunk the basketball. Don't say \"he can shoot!\" because he can only shoot well 3 out of the 7 days in a week - and even then, his shot selection (or lack thereof) is so putrid that shooting can't even be considered a strength of his.\n\nSaying that Gerald Green is even an average basketball player is as bad as saying Ben Wallace is a good free throw shooter."
