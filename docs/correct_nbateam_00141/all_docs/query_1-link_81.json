        "text": "The easiest way to summarize what is happening right now is just making a timeline:\n\n10:18 pm MDT: According to Adrian Wojnarowksi of ESPN, the Denver Nuggets have traded Malik Beasley and Juancho Hernangomez to the Minnesota Timberwolves as part of a four-team deal.\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts, but when the dust settles, the Nuggets get back a veteran guard in Gerald Green along with the Rockets first-round pick. The Nuggets will probably not get much out of Green as her underwent left foot surgery in October and is expected to miss six months. What the Nuggets truly gained in this deal is that first-round pick, which they can decide to hold onto or possibly flip in another deal.\n\n10:24 pm MDT: Wojnarowkski also reported a few minutes later that the Nuggets would be receiving Keita Bates-Diop in the deal as well.\n\nBates-Diop is only in his second year from Ohio State and is a player with upside. In 37 games with the Timberwolves this season, Bates-Diop is averaging 6.8 points, three rebounds, and 17.8 minutes per game.\n\n10:34 pm MDT: Shams Charania of The Athletic reports that the Nuggets are also trading Jarred Vanderbilt and getting back Shabazz Napier.\n\nVanderbilt is now the third player that Denver has traded to the Timberwolves and Napier in the second Minnesota player (Bates-Diop) the Nuggets have acquired on the night.\n\n10:35 pm MDT: Another report has just surfaced as Jon Krawczynski of The Athletc has reported the Nuggets acquired yet another Timberwolves player in Noah Vonleh.\n\nSo… when it is all said and done… it looks like the Nuggets have traded Malik Beasley, Juancho Hernangomez, and Jarred Vanderbilt to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Gerald Green and the Rockets first-round pick along with Keita Bates-Diop, Shabazz Napier, and Noah Vonleh.\n\nWe will continue to update this story when more information becomes available."
