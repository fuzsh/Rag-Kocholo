The collection can be valuable for selected domestic policy and foreign affairs topics. It is useful on the 1976 primary and general election campaigns, especially for media relations and information about Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, but less so on campaign planning and strategy. Nessen recounted his White House experience in It Sure Looks Different From the Inside (1978) and Making the News, Taking the News (2011).

There are also materials relating to the 1976 presidential campaign, including Republican Party and President Ford Committee contacts, analysis of Carter campaign strategy for the states visited by President Ford, and analysis of the issues that affected those states. Additional materials pertain to usage of the presidential boxes in the Kennedy Center by members of the White House staff and their guests, trips and events associated with the nation�s bicentennial, and campaign trips associated with the 1974 congressional elections.\n\nO'NEILL, ELIZABETH:\n\nFiles, 1974-77 (4 feet)\n\nFirst Lady's Staff: Director of Correspondence.\n\nThe First Lady's correspondence unit answered her mail from the general public on such topics as health, requests for recipes, media interviews, and the Equal Rights Amendment.

Also included are Pantlind’s newspaper clippings on University of Michigan football and on Gamma Delta Tau high school sorority, invitations to social events, and date books.

View digital images of the documents.\n\nPARSONS, RICHARD:\n\nFiles, 1974-77 (10 feet)\n\nDomestic Council: Associate Director for Justice, Civil Rights, Drugs, Consumer Affairs.\n\nParsons chaired the Domestic Council's Drug Review Task Force.

He conducted more interviews as the new leadership took hold. Most interviews focussed on the contest for House Minority Leader between Ford and Charles Halleck. Others concerned Melvin Laird's election as chairman of the House Republican Conference, Les Arends's election as Minority Whip, and the selections of John Rhodes and Charles Goodell to chair planning and policy committees. The interviews were the basis for a journal article, later reprinted as a chapter in Leadership in Congress: Stability, Succession, and Change (1976). These detailed interview notes may not be quoted for publication except by advance written permission of Professor Peabody.\n\nPHELAN, WANDA:\n\nFiles, (1971-75) 1976 (24 feet)\n\nPress Secretary's Office: Staff Assistant for Research.\n\nPhelan maintained research files for the 1976 campaign, concentrating on Jimmy Carter's background and statements, editorial opinions and endorsements, and columnist opinion from state and local newspapers.\n\nPORTER, SUSAN:\n\nFiles, 1974-77 (10 feet)\n\nFirst Lady's Staff: Appointments Secretary.\n\nPorter handled scheduling for Mrs. Ford and the Ford children.

See \"Must I make advance arrangements to see certain \"open\" collections?\"\n\nNOT FULLY DESCRIBED IN PRESNET.\n\nPRESIDENT FORD COMMITTEE:\n\nRecords, (1968, 1971-74) 1975-77 (349 feet)\n\nThe PFC conducted Ford's campaigns against Ronald Reagan for the Republican Party Presidential nomination and against Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter. Strengths of the PFC collection include campaign law, finances, advertising, implementation of strategy at the state level, volunteer operations, and the collection of polling data. A weakness is the dearth of files from the chairman's office. Some voluminous routine financial records remain closed pending processing.\n\nPRESIDENT'S DAILY DIARY, 1974-77 (46 feet)\n\nThe diary is a minute-by-minute log of every individual or group that Ford met, individuals with whom he spoke by telephone, and where he went. The White House compiled it from logs kept by the Secret Service and others and from records kept by Ford's scheduling and appointments staff. The diary is exhaustive, but it may not be authoritative especially regarding telephone calls. There is a small subject file on the creation and use of the diary, including a September 1974 time allocation study. The Library has digitized one set of Diaries (but not the rest of the collection). View the digitized Daily Diaries.\n\nPRESIDENT'S DAILY NEWS SUMMARIES, 1974-77 (17 feet)\n\nPress Office staff abstracted and excerpted printed and electronic news media articles, editorial opinion, and even political cartoons. They \"published\" the resulting daily news summaries for about 130 White House staff and others, eventually under the masthead News & Comment. These are the ribbon copies, which went to Ford. He very seldom annotated them, although he reportedly read them regularly. This is an incomplete set, to be supplemented by editors James Shuman's and Agnes Waldron's incomplete sets.\n\nPRESIDENT'S HANDWRITING FILE, 1974-77 (41 feet)\n\nThis key file contains option and briefing memorandums, reports, articles, and other documents that Ford initialed, otherwise annotated, or occasionally drafted. The subject range is wide, from arms control and sex discrimination to Christmas stamps and beverage container deposits. The quantity may be thin on any one topic, however, and the White House filed elsewhere highly sensitive defense and foreign affairs documents. The White House kept this file in chronological order, but the Ford Library created a duplicate set and arranged it by subject. The duplicate subject set is readily available to research. The original chronological set is available only with advance notice and in limited volume. View digital images of the documents in the Chronological File.\n\nPRESIDENT'S PAPERWORK LOG, 1974-77 (2 feet)\n\nThis is a log of all paperwork that went to or from Ford through the normal paper-flow channel administered by the Staff Secretary.

His large-type delivery texts, usually on cards and often annotated by him, are here along with occasional supporting material. The final texts of presidential speeches, public remarks, press conferences, and campaign debates may be found in the multi-volume series U.S. President, The Public Papers of the Presidents (available online through the American Presidency Project website). View digital images of the documents.\n\nPRESIDENT'S TELEPHONE LOGS, 1974-77 (1 foot)\n\nIncluded are logs of incoming and outgoing telephone calls handled through the White House switchboard and the nonsecurity signal line of the White House Communications Agency. The Ford Library does not have logs of calls over the security line. Almost all log entries are duplicated in the President's Daily Diary.\n\nPRESIDENTIAL PERSONNEL OFFICE:\n\nFiles, 1974-77 (273 feet)\n\nWorking files of the White House office which handled administration personnel appointments. Included are files on the search for potential appointees, the screening process used to evaluate candidates and solicit opinions, and the Presidential decision process. The bulk of the collection concerns appointments to positions in Cabinet departments, independent regulatory agencies, the Federal judiciary, and the numerous Federal boards and commissions. Only occasional scattered folders concern appointments to the White House staff.\n\nPUBLIC DOCUMENTS COMMISSION See U.S. NATIONAL STUDY COMMISSION ON THE RECORDS AND DOCUMENTS OF FEDERAL OFFICIALS\n\nPULLEN, FRANCES KAYE:\n\nFiles, 1974-77 (2 feet)\n\nWhite House Editorial Office: Associate Editor.

Assistant Counsellor to the President. White House Intelligence Coordinating Group: Executive Director.

Duval was active in the 1976 primary and general elections. These files reflect a range of President Ford Committee differences with Reagan Republicans over the party platform. Duval also assisted John Marsh as the White House responded to congressional demands for better oversight of the intelligence community, but these files remain closed.\n\nRAOUL-DUVAL, MICHAEL:\n\nPapers, 1974-77 (13 feet)\n\nThis is a wide-ranging and substantive collection.

Researchers must secure Mr. Reichley's written permission in order to use direct quotes from the interviews.\n\nREINHARDT, JOHN E.:\n\nPapers, 1971-81(9 feet)\n\nState Department official.\n\nDocuments Reinhardt's work as Director of both the United States Information Agency (USIA) and the United States International Communications Agency (USICA).\n\nRICHARD NIXON PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY ORAL HISTORY PROJECT:\n\nOral histories conducted by director Tim Naftali, 2007-09 (34 DVDs)\n\nUnprocessed - closed to research.\n\nROBERTS, JOHN W. \"Bill\":\n\nPapers, 1973-77 (14 feet)\n\nDeputy Press Secretary to Vice President Ford.

A chronological case file of the President's schedule and supporting material makes the bulk of the collection. In the White House, Roberts handled daily liaison with radio and television media and still photographers.\n\nROBSON, JOHN E.:\n\nPapers, 1970-93 (30 feet)\n\nGovernment official, including Chairman, Civil Aeronautics Board, 1975-77.\n\nRobson was a vigorous proponent of airline deregulation, and the collection especially concerns his work to that end. The papers also include an extensive 1981 oral history, as well as miscellaneous materials on Robson's other work in economic and transportation issues for the Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and Bush administrations. Researchers may wish to contact the Lyndon Johnson Library for additional Robson papers, which date from his work 1966-68 at the Office of Management and Budget and as head of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration. Note: a 1995 accretion to this collection is currently unprocessed and not available to research.

WILLIAM:\n\nFiles, 1974-77 (128 feet)\n\nAssistant to the President for Economic Affairs.

It includes most records of the Economic Policy Board (EPB), an interagency body chaired by Treasury Secretary William Simon. The EPB was the administration's primary forum for coordinating economic policy development and oversight. Topics range from the larger issues of inflation, taxation, energy, and trade, to such narrower problems as Iranian investment in Pan American Airlines and product liability. Most file segments are easy to use, but a careful researcher may also want to gain access to EPB minutes and memorandums through a subject index in box 19 , and to Seidman's computer-numbered correspondence through a log in box 213 . Sometimes overlooked are Seidman's political affairs file and his files on trips to international economic summits, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and the U.S.S.R. Seidman's assistant, Roger Porter, described and analyzed the EPB in Presidential Decision Making: The Economic Policy Board (1980).

Included are a head of state gift exchange register, declarations of receipt, gift lists, card catalogs, acknowledgements, packing lists, and more.\n\nNOT FULLY DESCRIBED IN PRESNET.\n\nWHITE HOUSE MAIL ROOM:\n\nGift control cards, 1974-77 (2 feet)\n\nThis collection has been transferred to the Ford Museum .\n\nWHITE HOUSE MILITARY AIDE'S OFFICE:\n\nFlight manifests and other files, 1973-77 (less than one foot)\n\nIncluded are passenger lists for jet and helicopter flights made by President Ford or the First Family, and a 1973-75 invitations file for military aide Richard Lawson.\n\nWHITE HOUSE PERSONNEL OFFICE See PRESIDENTIAL PERSONNEL OFFICE\n\nWHITE HOUSE PHOTOGRAPHIC OFFICE:\n\nFiles, 1974-76 (2 feet)\n\nRoutine requests for photographs and related services are the bulk, with scattered items on management of the office. The photographs taken by the staff of this office are described with other audiovisual collections.\n\nWHITE HOUSE PRESS RELEASE UNIT:\n\nKey phrase and word index to Presidential statements, 1974-77 (31 feet)\n\nWhite House volunteers created this detailed card index to press releases of Ford's speeches, announcements, interviews, statements, press conferences, and messages. Over 200,000 entries give keyword or phrase, the context phrase, and full text citation. In addition to country, personal name, or place entries, there are entries for phrases, e.g. \"legal order occurs only through...\", and entries for topics, e.g. \"Women in Government\" or \"Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction.\" Entries are not accessible via the PRESNET database.\n\nWHITE HOUSE PRESS RELEASES AND POOL REPORTS, 1974-77 (23 feet)\n\nThis is an apparently complete set, arranged by date. It includes press pool reports. The Library is currently scanning all of the press releases. View digital images of the documents.\n\nWHITE HOUSE RECORDS OFFICE:\n\nLegislation case files, 1974-77 (28 feet)\n\nWhen Congress passed a bill, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) usually collected analyses and comments from the federal agencies most concerned. OMB summarized, commented on, and forwarded this material to the White House, where selected staff members added comments and, sometimes, drafts of Presidential statements. The case file went to the President before he made his final veto or sign decision. The materials tend to be analytic and legalistic, with political concerns muted, and there are no case files for some bills. There is an unprocessed accretion. View digital images of the documents.\n\nWHITE HOUSE SENIOR STAFF MEETING NOTES, 1974-76. (2 feet)\n\nWhite House senior staff met about three times weekly, usually for 30 minutes and without the President, but they apparently created no systematic records of their meetings. Various attendees, however, sometimes made informal notes that can be found in their respective collections. In 1993, archivists searched open collections, found items on over 325 senior staff meetings, reproduced them, and compiled this set arranged by meeting date. The items vary greatly in research value and legibility. This set of reproductions is not subject-indexed in PRESNET, but most of the scattered originals were previously indexed.\n\nWHITE HOUSE SOCIAL OFFICE CENTRAL FILES, 1974-1977 (337 feet)\n\nThis filing system was shared by the White House East Wing staff, who assisted Mrs. Ford and the Ford children in their public activities. It includes a Subject File, Name File, Chronological File, and Bulk Mail File that are comparable to the separate system used by the President and his staff in the West Wing. Also included are the East Wing Staff Files and the Ford Children Files. Correspondence with the general public comprise most, but not all, of the material. The material concerns views on public issues, expressions of support or criticism, holiday greetings, invitations, schedule requests, and plans, assistance requests and offers, and other matters. See \"Must I make advance arrangements to see certain \"open\" collections?\"\n\nNOT FULLY DESCRIBED IN PRESNET.\n\nWHITE HOUSE SPECIAL FILES UNIT:\n\nPresidential files, 1974-77 (5 feet)\n\nThe Ford Special Files Unit was a remnant of the office that administered sensitive Presidential papers for Richard Nixon. Nonetheless, there are small but often significant files on Ford-Carter debate preparations, busing, Indochina refugees, aid to New York City, a nuclear policy review, Panama Canal negotiations, Puerto Rico, science and technology advice, Secret Service protection, federal executive salaries, the Republican legislative agenda, and Ford's federal budget review decisions. There is also material on the Special Files Unit itself. View digital images of the documents.\n\nWHITE HOUSE TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL SECTION:\n\nTelegrams sent and received, 1974-77 (2 feet)\n\nThe telegraph staff created three copies of routine telegrams sent and, especially, received. Incoming telegrams from the general public comprised the overwhelming majority. One copy went to the White House Central Files staff, and a second copy went to the White House sender/recipient. The telegraph staff kept the third set, in chronological order. This is a two percent sample from the third set, since destroyed.\n\nWHITE HOUSE TELEPHONE OFFICE:\n\nLogs, ticket stubs, and contact lists, 1974-77 32 feet)\n\nUnprocessed - closed to research.\n\nWHITE HOUSE USHER'S OFFICE:\n\nFiles, 1974-77 (3 feet)\n\nThis collection includes materials pertaining to staff appointments, events, swimming pool construction, Christmas preparations, budgets and expenditures, and construction of a warehouse for storage of furnishings. Also included in the collection is material related to the production of a film on the history of the White House.\n\nWHYTE, WILLIAM:\n\nScrapbook, 1974-75 (less than one foot)\n\nPersonal friend of Gerald Ford.

In 1975 he took the new post of State Department Coordinator for Humanitarian Affairs, handling human rights and refugees issues. The collection has substantive material from both posts. Wilson served as U.S. Minister in Thailand and the Philippines , 1964-70, and as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific, 1970-72. Miscellaneous material from these posts is also included.\n\nWIMER, DAVID See PRESIDENTIAL PERSONNEL OFFICE\n\nWOLTHUIS, ROBERT K.:\n\nFiles, 1974-77 (2 feet)\n\nCongressional Relations Office: Special Assistant to the President.\n\nWolthuis was the immediate deputy to Max Friedersdorf, the office head. This small but valuable collection is most notable for minutes of several Presidential meetings with Republican and bipartisan congressional leadership, September 1975-June 1976, on domestic, foreign, and political affairs.\n\nZARB, FRANK:\n\nPapers, 1974-78 (5 feet)\n\nFederal Energy Administration: Administrator. Energy Resources Council: Executive Director.\n\nMemorandums to Ford and a limited subject file concern the production, importation, and conservation of energy resources.
