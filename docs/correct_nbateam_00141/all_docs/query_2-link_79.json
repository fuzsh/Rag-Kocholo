        "text": "Gerald Cooper is a side character on Clarkson’s Farm, but in the eyes of the fans, he’s the shining star. Here is everything you need to know about the star from his job to his age and his family life.\n\nJeremy Clarkson may be the star of his show Clarkson’s Farm but it’s the helping hands on the series that have really wriggled their way into our hearts, the top of that list being Gerald Cooper.\n\nSince appearing in season one of the series, Gerald’s nonsensical ramblings and interactions with Jeremy have been the cause of many a laugh across the UK. However after it was revealed he had been diagnosed with cancer, fans got to see a different side to Gerald.\n\nAlongside other hit fan favourites such as Kaleb Cooper, ‘Cheerful’ Charlie Ireland and Lisa Hogan, these people are the heart and soul of Clarkson’s Farm and what keeps the audience coming back for more.\n\nListen now on Global Player, the official Heart app: Take That: This Life\n\nSo from Gerald’s age, job and accent to his family and whether he’s related to his co-star Kaleb. Here’s everything you need to know.\n\nWho is Gerald on Clarkson's farm and what is his job?\n\nGerald is a dry stone wall specialist and its been his job to maintain the walls and fences on Diddly Squat Farm so they can hold in the crops and animals like sheep… well they didn’t hold in the sheep that well in season one, did they?\n\nGerald has been working on the land longer than Jeremy has owned it. The wall builder used to work for the farmer who managed the plot before the Top Gear star.\n\nJeremy eventually upgraded Gerald’s role of ‘head of security’ for the farm, but we’ve yet to see exactly what this title entails for Gerald.\n\nREAD MORE: What is Clarkson's Law? How Diddly Squat farm helped farmers everywhere\n\nREAD MORE: Is Clarkson's Farm real or scripted?\n\nHow old is Clarkson’s Farm Gerald Cooper?\n\nGerald is 74 years old as of 2024 and has been going strong despite having a health scare in 2023. At the end of the first episode of season three, Jeremy received a call and viewers were told of Gerald's prostate cancer diagnosis.\n\nUnfortunately the fan favourite had to miss filming for the first half of the series as he attended radiotherapy sessions, but thankfully was seen again towards the end of the season.\n\nIs Gerald Cooper’s accent real fromClarkson's Farm?\n\nYes, we’re happy to say that Gerald Cooper’s accent is completely real.\n\nThe thick West Country accent has been incredibly difficult for viewers to understand without subtitles on the show and it’s those moments that he shared with Jeremy that added so much humour to the series.\n\nAccording to Jeremy, in all his years on Earth, Gerald has never left his small village of Chadlington, which was where Diddly Squat is located. This has obviously left him with the thickest, purest Cotswold accent one can get.\n\nIs Clarkson’s farm Gerald Cooper related to Kaleb Cooper?\n\nGerald has kept his life outside of the farm very private and not much is known about whether he has a wife and kids, however, there’s been much speculation that his co-farmer and co-star Kaleb Cooper is his son.\n\nBut as magical as that would have been, it’s just pure coincidence that they share a last name and there is absolutely no relationship between the two."
