He got it Wednesday night against Golden State.\n\nWolves coach Randy Wittman said this season is about evaluating players. With a roster depleted by injuries and illness, Wittman turned to Green.\n\nThe seldom-used forward delivered season highs in points, rebounds and minutes played. His performance added intrigue to what was otherwise a predictable outcome against the Warriors.\n\nThe Wolves suffered another loss, 111-98 at Target Center, as their frustrating season continued. Minnesota dropped to 3-21, the worst record in the NBA, and 2-10 at home. In 30 minutes off the bench, Green scored 18 points and had eight rebounds. He made 6 of 13 shots\n\nWittman was too upset after the game to discuss Green’s performance in detail. But on a night when Wittman called out his team for not being able to take an opponent’s best punch, he said this about Green: “He came in, and he played well. He was active. He was ready when called upon. We’ve talked about that all year.”\n\nGreen is one of the team’s best jump shooters. He just hasn’t had many opportunities to show it, appearing in only 11 of the Wolves’ 24 games so far. His previous season highs in points (13) and minutes (20) came Nov. 21 against Cleveland. He had played just three minutes since Dec. 6, but he didn’t let that lack of playing time affect him.\n\n“I feel like I should be playing, but the coaches are saying they’re looking at other guys, so what I have to do is stay positive, stay ready to play, like I did today,” Green said. “We lost, so this game really don’t mean nothing, but it still felt good to go out there and play.”\n\nHe scored 10 points in the second quarter, including two three-pointers, as Minnesota opened a 14-point lead just before halftime, before it was cut to 62-54 at intermission.\n\nGolden State outscored the Wolves 37-17 in the third quarter, making 15 of 20 shots as Minnesota committed eight turnovers.\n\nBy the time Green returned in the third, the Wolves had been outscored 15-6. They trailed 91-79 heading into the fourth quarter and never cut the deficit to fewer than eight points after that.\n\nGreen’s contributions didn’t go unnoticed.\n\n“Gerald came in and did a wonderful job tonight,” Craig Smith said. “He got in a good rhythm. He was handling both ends of the floor.”\n\nGreen might see more playing time, especially if Marko Jaric doesn’t recover quickly from the flu. Jaric’s absence enabled Green to play Wednesday. Green said he doesn’t know how much playing time to expect. He said he just tries to stay ready by working extra after practice.\n\n“It’s frustrating, us losing and you sitting on the bench, knowing that you feel like you could help the team,” Green said. “I got my chance and we still didn’t win, so I feel kind of bad.”\n\nWittman has said he wants Green to improve his shot selection. More recently, assistant coach Jerry Sichting said Green needs to improve his concentration on defense.\n\nBefore the season, the Wolves decided not to pick up the option for next season on Green’s contract, which means he will be a free agent next summer.\n\nOriginally Published: December 19, 2007 at 11:01 p.m."
