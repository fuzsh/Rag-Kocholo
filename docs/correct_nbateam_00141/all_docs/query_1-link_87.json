        "text": "Houston native and NBA journeyman Gerald Green has called it a career after 12 high-flying seasons.\n\nGreen last played in the NBA in 2019-20, before a foot injury sidelined him.\n\nThe former wing player is now entering the coaching profession by joining his hometown Houston Rockets as a player development coach on their staff.\n\nThe announcement came on Friday via the team.\n\nGreen was a member of the Rockets for two seasons and prior to that, he spent time around the league with other teams.\n\nThe Boston Celtics selected Green in the 2005 NBA Draft No.18 overall.\n\nGreen, 35, is perhaps best remembered for being one of the more explosive dunkers in the NBA.\n\nHe won the 2007 dunk contest and came in second place during the 2008 dunk contest.\n\nFans fondly remember the “birthday dunk” he performed in 2008 where he blew out a candle on a cupcake placed on the back of the rim while performing his dunk.\n\nGreen played twice for the Boston Celtics, Minnesota Timberwolves, twice for the Houston Rockets, Dallas Mavericks, the then-New Jersey Nets, Indiana Pacers, Phoenix Suns, and Miami Heat,"
