        "text": "“\n\nYou got anything else interesting, bring it my way.\n\n”\n\n— Gerald to the player.\n\nGerald is a character in the Grand Theft Auto series, appearing briefly in Grand Theft Auto V and as a main character in Grand Theft Auto Online.\n\nHistory[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nGerald joined The Families at some point prior to 2013. While living in an apartment in Chamberlain Hills, Los Santos, he started dealing drugs for them. He became a close associate with a fellow gang member, Lamar Davis, whom he often stole cars with. At some point, he met a woman who became his girlfriend and bought a lowrider. Eventually, Gerald, who was considerably fat, lost weight.\n\nEvents of Grand Theft Auto Online in 2013[]\n\nIn 2013, Lamar introduces the protagonist to Gerald, after Lamar became friends with them through Lifeinvader and they came to visit Los Santos, deciding to stay. Gerald then begins contacting the player, often giving the player missions that consist of stealing drugs from other dealers and gangs – usually the Vagos or The Lost MC.\n\nLater on, after a lowrider delivery set up by Lamar for Families OG Vernon goes south, Gerald is arrested. The police attempt to transport Gerald by air out of Los Santos International Airport, but the player, sent by Lamar, is able to rescue him. At a later point, the player steals lowriders from a Vagos car meet and brings them to Gerald's apartment.\n\nEvents of Grand Theft Auto V[]\n\nWhile Gerald doesn't physically appear in GTA V, he is seemingly still angry at Lamar for his prior actions, as he posts on Lamar's Lifeinvader wall, telling him to stay away from him.[2]\n\nEvents of GTA Online: The Diamond Casino Heist[]\n\nGerald's Last Play[]\n\nIn 2020, Gerald messages the protagonist asking them to help him on his drug selling business. The goals vary, with objectives such as assassinating gang bosses, stealing drugs from other gangs, and delivering drugs to buyers.\n\nCharacter[]\n\nPersonality[]\n\n“\n\nWell goddamn you antisocial motherfucker, you gonna speak?\n\n”\n\n— Lamar to Gerald.\n\nGerald is referred to as anti-social by Lamar, which appears to be true, as Gerald goes back to his apartment soon after meeting the player. He appears to be a paranoid person with difficulty to trust new associates, as he hesitates to meet the player, and often tells the player to keep their mouth shut after delivering drugs to him.\n\nHe is a quiet person, often saying short words or sentences like \"Nice\" or \"All right\" when meeting or messaging the player. He is more serious than Lamar when it comes to business, and appears to get annoyed by him. In general, he seems to have a low opinion of Lamar and speaks badly of him to the player over the phone.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nGerald is an African-American man of an average size, and is slightly overweight. He wears a white fedora hat, sunglasses, a black & silver \"LS\" necklace, a black t-shirt, and blue jeans. Occasionally, Gerald may appear without his hat, revealing his buzz cut hair.\n\nMission Appearances[]\n\nGrand Theft Auto Online[]\n\nLearning the Ropes (Boss)\n\nDeal Breaker (Boss)\n\nDeath Metal (Boss)\n\nFlood in the LS River (Boss)\n\nPier Pressure (Boss)\n\nMeth'd Up (Boss)\n\nNo Hay Bronca (Boss)\n\nGassed Up (Boss)\n\nViolent Duct (Boss)\n\nWar and Pieces (Boss)\n\nChumash and Grab (Boss)\n\nDish the Dirt (Boss)\n\nHit 'Em Up (Boss)\n\nHard Labor (Boss)\n\nLowriders[]\n\nIt's a G Thing\n\nPoint and Shoot\n\nThe Diamond Casino Heist[]\n\n\"Gerald's Last Play\" contact missions:\n\nLast Play - Bad Companies (Boss/Unseen)\n\nLast Play - Deal With It (Boss/Unseen)\n\nLast Play - End Product (Boss/Unseen)\n\nLast Play - Fast Peddling (Boss/Unseen)\n\nLast Play - Go Figure (Boss/Unseen)\n\nLast Play - Make Ends Meat (Boss/Unseen)\n\nServices (GTA Online)[]\n\nService GTA Online Description In-Game Effect Cost Level Requirement Request Job Request an invite to a previously completed Job. After a few seconds, you will be sent an invite to a random job you have completed for Gerald previously. $0 0\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nOn several occasions, when delivering drugs to Gerald, he may appear with his sunglasses and hat removed. Whether this was intentional or a glitch is unknown.[3]\n\nIronically, Gerald's apartment has signs that read \"No Weapons\" and \"No Drug Deals.\"[4]\n\nGerald has a loose resemblance to Big Smoke from Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Both men have similar heavy builds, attire, affilation to the Families and involvement in cocaine distribution. However, Gerald seems loyal to the Families, deals with other substances, and does not share Big Smoke's larger-than-life personality.\n\nGerald used to be overweight, and owned a lowrider which was stolen and sold to Mexicans by Lamar.[5]\n\nAnother possible reason for the post on Lifeinvader is because Gerald could have possibly discovered the theft of his car was by Lamar by the events of GTA V.\n\nReferences[]\n\nNavigation[]"
