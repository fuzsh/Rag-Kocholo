        "text": "Gerald Genta was born in Geneva on May 1, 1931 to a Swiss mother and Italian father. After concluding his studies as a goldsmith and jeweller, earning a Swiss federal diploma, he was recruited by Universal Geneve, one of the most renowned watchmaking manufacturers, particularly respected for its chronographs. It was here, at the young age of 23, that he designed the SAS Polerouter, a watch which commemorated the polar flights of the Scandinavian airline and which became one of the brand’s greatest successes.\n\nFollowing his work with Universal Geneve, which lasted into the mid-sixties, several Swiss watchmaking firms called upon the young designer. Firstly, Omega, for whom Gerald Genta renewed the Constellation collection which was a huge success. In 1970, Maison Audemars Piguet approached him to design the Royal Oak, which obviously went on to become their most iconic model. Genta got his inspiration for the piece after seeing a diver in a helmet attached to his suit with 8 screws. The octagonal shape was revolutionary and the first luxury watch to be made from steel, remaining a signature of the Audemars Piguet brand to this day.\n\nIn the early1970s, Patek Philippe had also hoped to benefit from the creative genius of Gerard Genta.\n\nA few years later, Gerald Genta created the legendary Patek Philippe Nautilus, inspired by a transatlantic ship. The new steel watch, featuring a bezel with softened angles, represented a subtle – yet at the time revolutionary – balance between a sports and luxury watch and has remained in production for 30 years.\n\nAlongside his collaborations with the finest watch brands, Genta created his own company in 1969, developing his eponymous brand and producing exceptional pieces for unique clients. Constantly creating and innovating, he combined new shapes and materials with major watchmaking complexities. Always working towards an unprecedented idea, largely inspired by painters and innovative designers, he quickly earned respect and high esteem from the industry and watchmaking enthusiasts throughout the world. One of his most famous pieces, the Grand Sonnerie, featuring the same chimes as Big Ben, was considered as one of the world’s most sophisticated wristwatches. Finalised after 5 years of R&D, the watch was a true masterpiece.\n\nFor his exclusive clients, which include the Moroccan King, the Sultans of Oman and of Brunei, the King of Spain, the King of Saudi Arabia, the Queen Mother of England as well as leading businessmen, sportsmen and entertainers, he created unique, prestigious and audacious models, some of which took years to emerge.\n\nIn the 80s, he obtained a license from Disney to design various models decorated with the most iconic Disney characters.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1999, he travelled the world with his wife Evelyne to develop and promote their brand, Gerald Genta. While the designer devoted himself exclusively to the creation of iconic and milestone watches, Evelyne passionately developed markets throughout Asia, Europe and the Middle-East.\n\nAfter the divestiture of his company to an Asian corporation in 1999, the Maestro could fully dedicate himself to his life as an artist and designer.\n\nGerald Genta passed away in August 2011 at the age of 80. Over his life he designed more than 100,000 watches for some of the world’s most famous brands. But above all, his vision and savoir-faire helped break boundaries, shake up pre-existing norms and rules, and bring the specific requirements of watchmaking closer to the creative power of art."
