Only one got his wish.\n\nThe Wolves traded unhappy forward Gerald Green to his hometown Houston Rockets in exchange for Kirk Snyder, a 2010 second-round draft pick and cash.\n\nVeteran Antoine Walker, who also wanted to be dealt, will remain with the Wolves the rest of the season now that the NBA trade deadline passed Thursday.\n\nGreen’s athleticism and on-target jump shot were obvious when he stepped on the court. But so were his limitations: poor shot selection and confusion about how to play the game.\n\nWolves vice president of basketball of operations Kevin McHale said he was “99.9 percent” certain Green would not be on the team next season, so a trade made sense rather than to lose Green for nothing after his contract expires this summer.\n\n“He was probably just the farthest away from readiness to play in NBA games,” McHale said.\n\nBut McHale also noted that the trade is a bit of a gamble because of Green’s long-term potential with a pretty jump shot and phenomenal athleticism.\n\nGreen appeared in just 29 games in his only season with the Wolves after coming to Minnesota as part of the trade that sent Kevin Garnett to Boston. He averaged 5.1 points and 12.3 minutes a game.\n\nWolves coach Randy Wittman said Green’s opportunities were limited because there was a logjam at the shooting guard and small forward positions.\n\nGreen, 22, told a Houston TV station that the trade is “like a dream come true.”\n\nAs for Walker, who was on the inactive list during Thursday’s 100-99 loss to San Antonio despite being healthy, he said he plans to remain professional the rest of the season. But he added he won’t hesitate to reaffirm his desire for a trade after the season ends if it appears he won’t have a significant role in the future.\n\nWhen asked before the game about not being traded Thursday, Walker said, “Yeah, I’m disappointed, because I’m not going to play here. I’m not part of the future here.”\n\nWalker said he’s not interested in a contract buyout — he’s making more than $8 million this season and $9 million next — because he doesn’t want to “give up a lot of money.”\n\nWalker said he thinks his trade value will be higher after this season because he could have just one more season left on his contract. There’s a team option after next season, so a team could get some salary-cap relief from his deal in the summer of 2009.\n\nIn Snyder, the Wolves get a player who was a 2004 first-round draft pick but is joining his fourth team after stops in Utah, New Orleans and Houston.\n\nSnyder will be a restricted free agent after the season when his contract expires. McHale said the Wolves have the rest of the season to evaluate him and determine whether he fits into the team’s long-term plans.\n\nSnyder had a tough time playing for Utah coach Jerry Sloan and lasted just one season with the Jazz, the team that drafted him.\n\nSloan suspended Snyder after Snyder threw down a meaningless dunk in a game and then taunted the opposing team. Snyder also got into a fight with Dallas’ Jerry Stackhouse, who waited by the Jazz team bus to confront him after a game in 2005, resulting in a one-game suspension for both players.\n\nMcHale said he’s optimistic Snyder will have the right attitude. He said he checked into Snyder’s background and got positive reviews — “practiced hard, played hard, showed up on time” — from Utah and Houston.\n\n“We talked about that when we investigated him,” McHale said. “He didn’t fit into the system, I think, as a rookie (in Utah). … Sometimes it’s just a fit, so we’ll see.”\n\nSnyder appeared in just nine games for the Rockets this season, averaging 9.8 minutes and 3.8 points. In 184 career games, he has averaged six points and 2.1 rebounds while shooting 42.5 percent.\n\n“I loved Kirk when he was (in college) at Nevada,” McHale said. “His career so far, he has not yet established himself as an NBA player. But I like his ruggedness. I like his toughness. I like that he was a multidimensional player at Nevada: scored, rebounded, defended, just did a lot of stuff.”\n\nRick Alonzo can be reached at ralonzo@pioneerpress.com.\n\nOriginally Published: February 21, 2008 at 11:01 p.m."
