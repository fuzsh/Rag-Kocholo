They do still have an official team site, and man is there a lot of Randy Foye stuff on there now.\n\n“This trade is about improving the Minnesota Timberwolves and improving our team for the future,” said Timberwolves Vice President of Basketball Operations Kevin McHale. “The past few seasons our on-court performance has been disappointing to our fans, myself, Glen Taylor and the entire organization. Through this trade, we have obtained very talented, young players with a lot of potential, future flexibility with the salary cap and two future first-round NBA draft picks. This will not be an overnight fix, but it is the big step in renewing our commitment to build an exciting franchise for our fans.”"
