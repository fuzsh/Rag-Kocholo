It will mark the fourth different team that the 31-year old Kaman has played for in his 11-year career, and it will be his third team in his past three seasons.\n\nKaman played with Dallas a year ago and struggled with injuries. He did play in 66 games and averaged 10.5 points and 5.6 rebounds per game.\n\nKaman, a former Central Michigan University standout, played his first nine seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers, followed by single years in New Orleans and Dallas. He is averaging 11.8 points and eight rebounds a game in his career."
