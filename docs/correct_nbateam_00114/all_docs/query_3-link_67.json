        "text": "Digital First Media Ten years ago this week Chris Kaman and the Mid-American Conference champion Central Michigan Chippewas defeated Creighton 79-73 to advance to the second round of the 2003 NCAA Tournament.\n\nThe win was Central Michigan’s first in the tournament since 1975 and included 12 points and six rebounds from the future NBA lottery pick Chris Kaman.\n\nA decade later the win still represents Central Michigan’s last appearance in the Big Dance, although the women’s program just locked up its first NCAA Tournament bid since 1984 Saturday.\n\nThough a small handful of MAC players have found their way to NBA rosters since then, Kaman remains the only active player from the conference currently signed to a team.\n\nSelected sixth overall by the Los Angeles Clippers, Kaman starred for eight years with the organization, averaging 11.7 points and 8.3 rebounds per game en route to becoming a fixture as one of the NBA’s most consistent big men.\n\nWhen the Clippers traded Kaman to New Orleans last season, he continued to shine, averaging 13.1 points and 7.1 rebounds in only one season as a Hornet. He signed with the Dallas Mavericks prior to this season, and is averaging similar numbers, 11.7 points and 6.0 rebounds in 46 games played thus far.\n\nThe key to Kaman’s success in the NBA?\n\nBy his own account, much is thanks to his upbringing and his experience at Central Michigan under former head coach Jay Smith, and some of the relationships he developed during his time as a Chippewa.\n\nGrowing up on a farm outside Grand Rapids, Kaman had just enough money for school supplies and the basic necessities. A dedicated Chicago Bulls fan as a kid, he had been to the Palace of Auburn Hills just once before earning his way to playing there as a professional.\n\n‘I used to hate the Pistons,’ he laughed in a recent interview for The Morning Sun. ‘But going to a game was a real treat for us, it was awesome.’\n\nNow, it’s his family members and CMU friends that are treated when Kaman comes to the Palace, as the now 30-year-old finds added significance occasionally playing in Detroit as a visitor.\n\n‘It’s more about them than me,’ he said. ‘They don’t get to come to many of my games.’\n\nHaving made over $65 million to date over the course of his NBA career, it’s safe to say Kaman has been successful at basketball’s highest level. But it wasn’t until his senior year at Tri-Unity Christian School that he even had a shot to play Division I basketball. While character issues stemming from a diagnosed ADHD condition scared away other interested programs, CMU’s Smith decided to roll the dice on the then 6-foot-11 senior. Kaman rewarded Smith with a 15.1 points and 4.8 rebounds per game average over his three years at CMU, including 22.4 points and 12 rebounds during his junior season in 2002-2003.\n\nTen years after becoming a professional, Kaman admits his involvement with the CMU basketball program has since been minimal, largely due to the commitment and grind of the NBA season. Besides following the Chippewas on the internet and keeping in touch with former players and coaches, Kaman says maintaining his body and getting enough rest between games and practices consumes the majority of his time during the season.\n\n‘It takes a toll on your body, I’m tired a lot,’ he said. ‘But I want to focus on what I’m doing and be the best I can be while I’m doing it.’\n\nThe next 10 years and beyond, Kaman hopes, will be different. Besides expressing a desire to be more involved with CMU’s current basketball teams, Kaman wants to finally earn his college degree.\n\n‘When I was there, I focused so much on basketball,’ he said. ‘But a degree wouldn’t be a bad thing to have, either.’\n\nEven as a pro, Kaman says he’s always reminded of the Chippewas’ remarkable 2003 season. When CMU lost to Duke just two days after beating Creighton, Kaman’s Mavericks teammate Dahntay Jones scored 28 points to lead the Blue Devils to a 26-point win.\n\n‘Playing with Dahntay reminds me of that game, of that season,’ said Kaman. ‘And all of the great opportunities that have come from that. I really enjoyed myself at Central and learned even more.’\n\nNot to be outdone, Kaman’s 25 points and 10 rebounds that night against one of the nation’s best teams ultimately solidified his value as a lottery pick in the NBA Draft.\n\nAs for his ranking among the all-time greats at Central?\n\nKaman isn’t sure, but hints that he belongs in the conversation.\n\n‘I feel like I hold a big part of the Central Michigan legacy,’ he said. ‘Even though I haven’t graduated yet.’"
