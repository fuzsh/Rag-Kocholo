        "text": "Cuban said he was unaware of the news that Kaman will start. Cuban supported the decision, pointing out the Mavericks’ recent poor starts. They fell behind Charlotte 17-4 and trailed Minnesota after one period, 25-17. “I think it will get us off to a better start, and I think it will get (Kaman) into the rhythm of the game more,” Cuban said. “I think all of our guys, including Chris, are trying to do too much, particularly on the offensive end. We’ve seen that. Everybody comes in and immediately wants to score, immediately wants to have an impact on the game.”\n\nGuard Rodrigue Beaubois hobbled off the court in pain near the end of the Mavericks’ practice, having turned his left ankle again. “We hope he’s going to be OK and it’s not serious,” coach Rick Carlisle said.\n\nChris Kaman (right calf muscle strain) said he’s moderately optimistic that he will be available for the Mavericks’ season opener on Oct. 30 in Los Angeles against the Lakers. The 7-foot center sat out his second consecutive preseason game on Monday. “I’m pretty sure I’ll be good to go,’’ Kaman said. “That’s a long time from now. It gives me over a week and I’m progressing pretty good, so I don’t really see that as a problem. But I can’t guarantee that. I don’t know.\n\nMavericks center Chris Kaman has a strained calf and will not be making the trip for the preseason game against the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday, coach Rick Carlisle said. “He’s going to stay here and get treatment on it and hopefully get ready for next week,” Carlisle said. Mavs head athletic trainer Casey Smith will stay in Dallas over the weekend to treat and monitor Kaman and Dirk Nowitzki, who underwent arthroscopic knee surgery Friday.\n\nKaman showed a variety of offensive skills in Europe. He posted up and powered to the basket, and he drifted out and sank the midrange jump shot. He got to the free throw line, too. Kaman also has taken a liking to Dirk Nowitzki, whom he invited on Kaman’s next hunting trip. Kaman is a devoted outdoorsman who enjoys shooting big things. “He said he’s going to go, but I think he was very reluctant at first,’’ Kaman said of Nowitzki’s initiation into the outdoor life. “I don’t think he wanted to take my invitation, but he said if that’s what makes me happy, he’ll do it. So I’m going to keep him true to his word.’’\n\nCenters Chris Kaman and Brandan Wright both got on the Dallas Mavericks’ team plane to Germany today after going through some light workout drills at American Airlines Center. Kaman sprained his lower back during last Saturday’s practice, and Wright strained his left quadricep muscle in Sunday’s practice. Both players hope to play in either Saturday’s preseason game in Berlin or Tuesday’s preseason game in Barcelona, Spain. “He did a few things today, but he’s not back yet,” coach Rick Carlisle said of Wright. “He went through some five-on-oh things kind of at two-thirds speed, but he’s doing better. “I just hope that we can keep building on his situation.”"
