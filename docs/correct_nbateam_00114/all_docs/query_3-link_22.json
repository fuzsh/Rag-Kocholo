        "text": "Chris Kaman is reportedly set to ink a one-year contract with the Dallas Mavericks, worth $8 million dollars. You'd think that's enough to excite somebody, right?\n\nKaman may very well be excited about his new eight million dollar payday, or teaming up with fellow German basketball player Dirk Nowitzki, but Kaman is also excited about other aspects of headed to Dallas to continue his career.\n\nIt didn't take long at all for Kaman to take to Twitter to express some of his thoughts.\n\nIf you check out Kaman's Twitter feed, he's posted a few pictures of animals he's hunted, so it seems that Kaman will continue that leisurely activity in Dallas.\n\nKaman also thinks his truck will feel right at home in Big D:\n\nWell, I don't want to be the guy to accuse him of being wrong, so I'll leave that for you to decide -- and inform Kaman."
