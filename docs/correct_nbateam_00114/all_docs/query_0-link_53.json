        "text": "Update (July 10): The Portland Trail Blazers officially announced the signing of unrestricted free agent center Chris Kaman.\n\nThe Portland Trail Blazers have signed free agent center Chris Kaman, it was announced today by General Manager Neil Olshey.\n\nKaman, 32, holds career averages of 11.7 points (48.7% FG, 74.5% FT), 7.9 rebounds, 1.3 assists and 1.4 blocks in 11 seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers, New Orleans Pelicans, Dallas Mavericks and Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\"We targeted Chris early in the process believing his offensive versatility and defensive presence would make for a quality addition to our front court,\" said Olshey. \"His skill set complements our returning roster players and we expect him to have an immediate impact.\"\n\nAn NBA All-Star in 2010, Kaman averaged 10.4 points, 5.9 rebounds, 1.5 assists and 1.0 blocks for the Lakers last season.\n\n\"I am extremely pleased to add Chris to our roster,\" said Trail Blazers Head Coach Terry Stotts. \"He is a proven NBA talent and will both bolster and complement our front court at both ends of the floor.\"\n\nKaman (7-0, 265) played collegiately at Central Michigan University and was selected by the Clippers with the sixth overall pick in the first round of the 2003 NBA Draft.\n\nHe will wear No. 35 for the Trail Blazers.\n\nOriginal Post\n\nAdrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo Sports reports that the Portland Trail Blazers have agreed to sign unrestricted free agent center Chris Kaman to a two-year contract.\n\nChris Kaman has agreed to a two-year, $9.8 million contract with the Portland Trail Blazers, league sources told Yahoo Sports.\n\nThe second season of the deal has $1 million of the $5 million guaranteed, a source said.\n\nChris Haynes of CSNNW.com reports on Twitter...\n\nChris Kaman's agent, Rob Pelinka, confirms his client has agreed to a 2-year, 10 million deal with Blazers. Second year partial guarantee.\n\nSam Amick of USA Today Sports reports on Twitter...\n\nChris Kaman's deal with Portland is $4.8 million in the first year and $5 million in the second year with only $1 million guaranteed, I'm told.\n\nJoe Freeman of The Oregonian reports on Twitter...\n\nChris Kaman on agreeing to deal w/ #Blazers: \"This was about fit. I know I have 3 or 4 good years of basketball left. Really good years ... I wanted to find the right fit for myself and the team. Portland was that fit.\"\n\n\"I want to be back in playoffs and help the team get back to wining the title. I think the Trail Blazers are right at that level.\"\n\nHaynes adds thoughts from Robin Lopez....\n\n\"He's definitely going to help us. I think it was a great decision,\" Lopez told CSNNW.com while selling while helping a childhood friend sell fireworks. \"I know he has a great relationship with Coach [Kim] Hughes from his days as a Clipper and he's tough to guard. I'm excited for us. We should be much more improved.\"\n\nBrother Wendell Maxey writes on Twitter...\n\nRip City fans/media will come to appreciate Chris Kaman both as a person and a player. One of the good guys in the game.\n\nHad the chance to get to know Chris Kaman when he played for German national team. fits Portland's personality and that locker room perfectly.\n\nKaman, 32, spent last season with the Los Angeles Lakers, where he averaged 10.4 points and 5.9 rebounds while shooting 50.9 percent in 39 appearances. Kaman's PER of 17.1 ranked No. 22 among centers last season.\n\nThe burly 7-footer did not click with former Lakers coach Mike D'Antoni and received a number of DNP-CDs. The two men reportedly went weeks without speaking during the season. Kaman also dealt with a foot injury and a calf injury during the Lakers' disappointing 2013-14 campaign.\n\nKaman was previously linked to the Blazers in both 2012 and 2013. He picked the Dallas Mavericks over the Blazers in 2012 and the Lakers over the Blazers (among others) in 2013.\n\nBlazers GM Neil Olshey traded Kaman from the Los Angeles Clippers to the New Orleans Hornets (now Pelicans) in 2011.\n\nKaman pencils in as a back-up to starting center Robin Lopez on the depth chart. Selected to the 2010 All-Star team, Kaman didn't work out as a starting option in either Dallas or Los Angeles.\n\nUnless something dramatic happens trade-wise, Kaman will be joining the Blazers via the team's mid-level exception.\n\nPortland had been linked to Spencer Hawes and Channing Frye, among other big men, in rumors this week. Signing Kaman looks like a fall back plan and likely signals that those targets, among others, either weren't available or weren't willing to sign in Portland for mid-level exception money.\n\nA 2003 lottery pick out of Central Michigan, Kaman holds career averages of 11.7 points and 7.9 rebounds over 11 seasons.\n\nDave's analysis regarding what the agreement means for the Blazers going forward is right here. My thoughts on the deal (including a grade) are right here.\n\nKaman was the subject of a series of memes after he lay down on the Lakers' bench during a game in which a number of his teammates were unavailable due to injuries. Kaman has owned the joke and referenced it on Thursday night following reports that he agreed to sign with Portland."
