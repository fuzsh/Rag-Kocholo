They already are 0-1 against the Southwest after San Antonio took them down in LA last week. … Former Mavericks center Chris Kaman is with the Lakers and had 10 poionts and five rebounds in 16 minutes during a 105-103 victory over Atlanta on Sunday. … Less-than-renowned Xavier Henry had a team-best 18 points in that game. … Pau Gasol has had a solid start to the season, averaging 16 points and 11 rebounds through four games. … The Lakers’ bench is getting plenty of action. Reserves have scored just over 55 percent of their 400 points through four games. … Through four games, they are shooting just over 39 percent from 3-point land.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScouting the Mavericks\n\nMavericks\n\nBe the smartest Mavericks fan.

They move on for road games at Oklahoma City on Wednesday, Minnesota on Friday and Milwaukee on Saturday … Dirk Nowitzki has topped 20 points in all three games thus far and is averaging 23.3 points, but only 4.7 rebouunds. … The Mavericks lost three of four meetings with the Lakers last season, including both games at AAC. One of those was the infamous “amnesty that” game in which Kobe Bryant unloaded 38 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists after Mark Cuban had suggested playfully that the Lakers amnesty Bryant for the good of the franchise. … The Mavericks have lost five in a row to the Lakers at AAC."
