        "text": "The Los Angeles Lakers have found their first new face this NBA free agency period. Chris Kaman and the Lakers have agreed to a one-year deal, reports Marc Stein of ESPN. The deal is expected to be for the Lakers' mini mid-level exception, according to Ramona Shelburne of ESPN.\n\nKaman spent the first eight years of his career in Los Angeles with the Clippers. He signed with the Dallas Mavericks last Summer and averaged 10.5 points and 5.6 rebounds per game.\n\nThe Lakers were in need of frontcourt help with Dwight Howard's departure. Pau Gasol has been expected to be the starting center going forward, but using the mini mid-level exception on a frontcourt player with Jordan Hill on contract for a final season.\n\nThe minute spread would be thin without additional help, and Kaman should give Mike D'Antoni a veteran frontcourt player to help balance his rotations, but the Lakers do have pressing needs at the small forward position to address as well. The use of the mini mid-level exception has taken up one of the tools the Lakers had to bring in help on the perimeter.\n\n- Drew"
