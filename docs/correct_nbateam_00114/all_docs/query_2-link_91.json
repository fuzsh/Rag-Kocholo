        "text": "The Trail Blazers bolstered their frontcourt on Thursday night, reaching a verbal agreement with a veteran free agent center to add depth to their bench.\n\nBut it's not the one you think.\n\nThe Blazers signed unrestricted free agent Chris Kaman to a two-year, $9.8 million offer sheet, adding bulk, talent and experience to an area of need.\n\n\"I'm ready to do whatever is called upon me,\" Kaman told The Oregonian in a phone interview. \"I'm a utility guy. I don't think I'm a superstar at any one thing, but I'm a well-rounded basketball player and I have a lot of knowledge of the game.\"\n\nKaman was not the Blazers' first choice in free agency. General manager Neil Olshey and coach Terry Stotts met with Spencer Hawes and his agent the moment free agency opened, courting a stretch big man they had identified as their No. 1 offseason target.\n\nBut shortly after Olshey and Stotts finished with Hawes, about 1:20 a.m. Tuesday on the East Coast, they reached out to their No. 2 choice: Kaman.\n\n\"They said, 'Hey, Damian (Lillard) and LaMarcus (Aldridge) like you. We like you,'\" Kaman said of the conversation with Olshey and Stotts. \"You're our next choice if Spencer doesn't take our deal.\"\n\nAfter meeting with the Blazers, Hawes continued to visit other suitors, including the Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Clippers and Phoenix Suns. And by Thursday, it became evident the market for Hawes would be \"too robust,\" according to a league source. The Blazers, who are over the salary cap, could offer Hawes no more than their midlevel exception, which pencils out to, at most, $5.3 million per year over four years.\n\nWhen it became clear Hawes would command more than the midlevel exception, the Blazers shifted their focus to Kaman. A source with knowledge of the specifics of the deal, first reported by Yahoo Sports, told The Oregonian the Blazers will pay Kaman $4.8 million during the 2014-15 season and $5 million in 2015-16. Only $1 million of the second season is guaranteed. It will not become official until the free agent moratorium ends July 10.\n\nKaman said a variety of factors led him to Portland. For starters, he has only been in the playoffs once, in 2005-06, with the Clippers, and he longed to play for a winner. What's more, Kaman is an outdoorsman who counts hunting and fishing among his favorite hobbies, so the region was a draw. His close connection to Olshey and assistant coach Kim Hughes— whom he knows from he days playing for the Clippers — was the clincher.\n\n\"I've had a rough couple of years,\" he said, regarding his time with the Dallas Mavericks and Los Angeles Lakers. \"I wanted to go somewhere where people know me, know what kind of guy I am and what I'm capable of. This is a good opportunity for me to show that. They needed some help at the big spot and I think I can fill that hole.\"\n\nKaman, who is 7-feet and 265 pounds, said he talked to Stotts late Thursday evening, but the two did not discuss his role. But there's no question the Blazers signed him to come off the bench and serve as a backup to starting center Robin Lopez. Joel Freeland served capably as the Blazers' backup center last season, before a late-season knee injury sidelined him for the stretch run, but Kaman's experience, scoring ability and court savvy are an instant upgrade. And his beef and bulk add another dimension to Stotts' lineup.\n\nKaman, 32, has averaged 11.7 points, 7.9 rebounds and 1.4 blocks, while shooting 49 percent, over his 11-year NBA career. He was an All-Star with the Clippers in 2009-10, when he averaged 18.5 points and 9.3 rebounds.\n\nAnd while there is no mistaking he is in the twilight of his career, the No. 6 overall pick of the vaunted 2003 NBA draft said he still has plenty to offer, in part because he has been used sparingly the last two seasons, playing just 105 games with the Dallas Mavericks and Los Angeles Lakers. Last season, he played in just 39 games and averaged a career-low 18.7 minutes, which he says was a byproduct of the Lakers desire to feature a small lineup.\n\nIn limited action, Kaman averaged 10.4 points and 5.9 rebounds for the Lakers, but had several notable performances. During a March win over the Suns, he recorded 28 points, 17 rebounds and six assists. And during a potent four-game stretch in February — which included a 27-point, 10-rebound explosion against the Chicago Bulls — Kaman averaged a double-double.\n\n\"I know I have three or four good years of basketball left — really good years,\" Kaman said. \"I feel really good. I wanted to find the right fit for myself and the team. And Portland was that fit.\"\n\nKaman may not have been the Blazers' first choice, but be may end up being the right choice.\n\n\"Love it,\" Lillard wrote in a text message to The Oregonian, when asked about the signing."
