        "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) - Chris Kaman is headed back to Los Angeles, this time with the Lakers.\n\nThe 7-foot free agent center who spent the first eight years of his career with the Clippers said Monday on Twitter that he had agreed to join the Lakers. The deal is reportedly for one year at $3.2 million.\n\nKaman spent last season with Dallas on a one-year, $8 million contract but never emerged as the starting center the Mavericks thought he would be.\n\nHe spent the previous season with New Orleans after he was part of the trade that sent Chris Paul to the Clippers.\n\nThe Lakers grabbed Kaman after Dwight Howard chose not to return and agreed to a deal with the Houston Rockets.\n\n(Â© Copyright 2013 The Associated Press.
