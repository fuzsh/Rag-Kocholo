        "text": "Chris Kaman spent much of the 2011-12 NBA season in no man's land after being traded from the Los Angeles Clippers to the New Orleans Hornets in the deal that brought Chris Paul to L.A., but he's now headed to a team perpetually seeking size underneath. ESPN's Marc Stein reports that Kaman will sign with the Dallas Mavericks, with a deal to be finalized later on Wednesday. Yahoo!'s Marc Spears reports that Kaman's deal will be for one year and worth $8 million.\n\nKaman was deactivated and then reactivated by the Hornets in 2011-12, as the team tried and failed to dangle him as trade bait, but he was still one of the NBA's most solid centers. He averaged 13.1 points and 7.8 rebounds per game in 47 appearances for New Orleans, close to his career averages of 11.9 points and 8.3 rebounds per contest.\n\nKaman also has some familiarity with his new teammate Dirk Nowitzki: the two have played together on the German national basketball team, thanks to Kaman's dual citizenship."
