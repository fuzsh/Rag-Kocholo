        "text": "Chris Kaman is bringing his versatile post moves, love of hunting and off-beat humor back to Los Angeles, only this time it won’t be in a Clippers uniform.\n\nThe Lakers announced Monday that they intend to add the veteran center to their roster to help fill the void left by Dwight Howard, who left for Houston. Terms of Kaman’s contract were not disclosed, but it is believed that the Lakers will sign him to their mini mid-level exception of $3.2 million.\n\nThe 31-year-old veteran center took to Twitter to express his excitement, writing, “It’s true, I am going to be going back to LA and it’s to play for the Lakers! I am excited about this move and can’t wait to play!\n\n“It’s going to be weird playing in the same building as I did before but with different colors! But (am) excited about the move!”\n\nKaman played eight seasons for the Clippers before being dealt to New Orleans two years ago in a blockbuster deal for guard Chris Paul in 2011. He averaged 10.5 and 5.6 rebounds last season for the Dallas Mavericks and shot 50.7 percent from the field in 66 games.\n\nWith Dwight Howard gone to Houston, Kaman could either back up Pau Gasol at center or start alongside the Spaniard should the Lakers look to use the two big-men system they have played in recent years. The Lakers also have backup Robert Sacre.\n\nKaman, gained most of his notoriety with the Clippers (2003-11), where he earned an All-Star nod in 2010 while averaging a career-high 18.5 points and 9.3 rebounds. His numbers had faded by the final year with the Clippers, averaging 12.4 points and 7 rebounds his final season.\n\nKaman’s one-year deal still leaves the Lakers with plenty of salary cap space for the anticipated summer of 2014, when big name free agents such as LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh will be available."
