Vote below and help decide the greatest Dallas Mavericks center of all time!\n\nMost divisive: Salah Mejri\n\nOver 500 Ranker voters have come together to rank this list of The Best Dallas Mavericks Centers of All Time\n\nBirthplace : Hanford, California\n\nTeam : Houston Rockets\n\nPosition : Center\n\nDallas Mavericks: 2010–2011, 2014–2015\n\nHaving arrived at the Dallas Mavericks in 2010 through a trade, Tyson Chandler would go on to play an integral role in securing the team's first NBA championship in 2011. As a true defensive anchor, this 7'1\" center dominated the paint, deterring opposing players with his shot-blocking ability and rebounding prowess. Chandler made a lasting impact at Dallas with his gritty play, exemplified by his receipt of the NBA All-Defensive Second Team honors in 2011. His strong presence and infectious energy earned him the admiration of Mavericks fans, making him one of the most beloved centers in their history.\n\nBirthplace : Heacham, United Kingdom\n\nPosition : Center\n\nDallas Mavericks: 1985-1992\n\nSigned as a free agent in 1985, James Donaldson provided a formidable presence in the paint for the Mavericks during the late 80s and early 90s. Known for his durability and consistency, the 7'2\" center was renowned for setting hard screens, making him a reliable pick-and-roll partner. Despite not being an offensive juggernaut, Donaldson's true value came from his defensive game, combining excellent shot-blocking skills with strong rebounding numbers. He was well-deserving of his lone All-Star appearance in 1988, solidifying his place among the greatest centers in Mavericks history.\n\nBirthplace : Ventspils, Latvia\n\nTeam : Washington Wizards\n\nPosition : Power forward\n\nDallas Mavericks: 2019-2022\n\nAcquired through a blockbuster trade in early 2019, Kristaps Porzingis quickly became a vital piece of the Mavericks' young core. The 7'3\" Latvian big man is known for his unique combination of size and shooting ability, making him a matchup nightmare for opposing teams. Nicknamed \"the Unicorn,\" Porzingis can stretch the floor with his three-point touch and protect the rim with his shot-blocking prowess. While still chasing his first accolades with the Mavericks, Porzingis holds immense promise as a cornerstone for the franchise going forward.\n\nBirthplace : New York City, USA, New York\n\nPosition : Power forward, Center\n\nDallas Mavericks: 1984-1990\n\nBrought to Dallas in a 1996 trade, Sam Perkins was an immediate offensive force for the Mavericks during his tenure. The 6'9\" center displayed versatility, with a silky smooth jump shot that made him a threat from beyond the arc as well as an effective post game. Known as \"Big Smooth,\" Perkins provided valuable veteran leadership to a young Mavericks team on the rise. His impact may not be quantified through awards, but his offensive prowess and role in mentoring future stars ensure his inclusion among the top centers in Dallas history.\n\nBirthplace : Germany, Landstuhl\n\nPosition : Center\n\nDallas Mavericks: 1997-2005\n\nArriving at the Mavericks in 1997 via a trade, Shawn Bradley found a lasting home in Dallas, where he would spend the majority of his career. The 7'6\" center brought an imposing shot-blocking presence, averaging over three blocks per game during his time with the team. Bradley's defensive contributions were complemented by a reliable scoring touch, making him a valuable two-way player. Though he never captured any major accolades with the Mavericks, Bradley's rim-protection and scoring abilities are remembered fondly by Dallas fans.\n\nBirthplace : New York City, New York\n\nPosition : Power forward, Center\n\nDallas Mavericks: 1986-1991, 1994-1995\n\nDrafted by the Mavericks in 1986, Roy Tarpley made an immediate impact in his rookie season, winning the NBA Sixth Man of the Year award. At 6'11\", Tarpley was a force inside the paint, known for his ability to score, rebound, and block shots. His career with the Mavericks was plagued by off-court issues, but his on-court play left a lasting impression. Tarpley's skillset as a versatile big man helped him establish a legacy as one of the franchise's best centers."
