        "text": "The Lakers first free agent signing after Dwight Howard left the team to go to the Houston Rockets was veteran center Chris Kaman. Kaman spent last season growing his trademark beard with the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nNow Kaman won’t have to wait to long to return to Dallas as the Lakers head there to take on the Mavericks on November 5.\n\nKaman played in 66 games last season for the Mavericks, starting in 52, and averaged 10.5 points and 5.6 rebounds.\n\nThe Lakers and Mavericks have had a little bit of a rivalry the last couple of years. The Lakers won’t forget the sting of the Mavericks sweeping them out of the second round in 2011 on their way to their first NBA Championship.\n\nLikewise it was the Lakers’ 20-point drubbing of the Mavericks in April last season that effectively ended the Mavericks playoff hopes.\n\nWith Kaman now donning the purple and gold it should give the Lakers a larger advantage in the post with Kaman and Pau Gasol patrolling the paint.\n\nKaman was a popular person in Dallas and his contributions when healthy, helped the team so it will be interesting to see how the fans react when Kaman takes the floor. While not a Maverick legend like Michael Finley, Dirk Nowitzki, or Mark Aguirre, he was a part of a beloved team last year.\n\n————————————————————————————————————————–"
