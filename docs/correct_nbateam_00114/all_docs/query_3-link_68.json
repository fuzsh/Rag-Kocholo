        "text": "Chris Kaman, who is 33 years old ex German international basketball player, currently plays for The Portland Trail Blazers as a center. He has been playing in The NBA since 2003, when he started his career at Los Angeles Clippers. The German basketball player played also for The New Orleans Hornets, Dallas Mavericks and Los Angeles Lakers, but his most successful period in his career was when he played for The Los Angeles Clippers (2003 – 2011). He has taken part in a really big number of matches, but can you imagine – he has never scored a three-pointer in his NBA career.\n\nSo, after 13 years and 729 games, Chris Kaman managed to score his first three-pointer. Wow, what an impressive record! It’s interesting that he has already missed 23 attempts, but Kaman finally did it! He scored from the line for three points against The Detroit Pistons in the last match of his team – The Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nChris Kaman is famous for his nickname – the Caveman, maybe because of his outlook… Kaman also took part in The NBA All-Star Game in 2010. His other major successes are the MAC Player of the Year (2003), First-team All-MAC (2003) and MAC tournament MVP (2003). Now, he can be proud his dream came true, scoring a three-pointer in a match.\n\nThe first time Kaman played for the German national team was in the qualifying tournament leading up to the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. He recorded a double-double on his debut against Cape Verde, scoring 10 points and making 10 rebounds. Then, he was chosen for the most valuable player by the journalists. Germany with Kaman in its squad finished in 10th position in The 2008 Olympics tournament. Chris Kaman was also selected in the German squad for the EuroBasket 2011 in Lithuania, where he helped his team reach the 9th place.\n\nHowever, now the German basketball player is not as important for his team as he was at Los Angeles Clippers in the beginning of his career, but is still valuable and can help the Portland Trail Blazers win matches. He has averaged 11,4 points per game in his career so far, which is not so bad, but he has probably not trained a lot shooting from the three points line.\n\nIt will be interesting whether Chris Kaman can score more three-pointer until the end of his career. However, he is 33 years old and still have enough time to do it. But if he keeps trying the same way, he will need another 23 shots and another 13 years…"
