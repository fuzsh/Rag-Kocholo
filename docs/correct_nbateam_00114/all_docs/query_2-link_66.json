        "text": "DALLAS - O.J. Mayo and Chris Kaman didn't want to let another tight game slip away from the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nMayo scored 26 points, Kaman added 20, and the Mavericks snapped a three-game losing streak by beating the Philadelphia 76ers, 107-100, Tuesday night.\n\nDallas was holding on to an 88-82 lead when Mayo and Kaman took over late. The duo scored 17 of the team's last 19 points to help Dallas win their seventh straight at home against the 76ers.\n\nThe Mavericks were coming off an 0-3 road trip that included overtime losses to Boston and Minnesota.\n\nMayo had nine points and three assists in the final 6:17. Kaman, who hasn't played in the fourth quarter or overtime in four of the past five games, had eight points in that stretch.\n\n\"It's the most important time of the game,\" Kaman said. \"It's crunch time and I was glad I was out there to finish plays.\"\n\nMayo, who also finished with a season-high eight assists, hit a 22-footer and Kaman made three shots in a row in an 8-2 run that made it 96-84. After the 76ers scored the next six, the pair combined to hit three shots in a row to push the lead up to 11.\n\n\"We try to involve those guys in a lot of things because they're both playing well,\" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. \"(Mayo's) aggression was really the key.\"\n\nDorell Wright scored 25 points and Spencer Hawes had 18 for the 76ers, who lost their fourth straight game. Philadelphia point guard Jrue Holiday, the team's leading scorer at nearly 19 points per game, missed his third straight game with a sprained left foot.\n\n\"I thought we had some guys play well and we've got to keep building on that,\" 76ers coach Doug Collins said. \"We know we're undermanned, but nobody cares.\"\n\nDallas point guard Derek Fisher left the game with 6:50 remaining in the first quarter with a strained right knee and did not return. Fisher, who wasn't expected to play because of the flu, went down to the ground after having his shot blocked by Evan Turner. The 17th-year guard walked slowly to the locker room.\n\nCarlisle said Fisher will have an MRI tomorrow to determine the severity of the injury.\n\nDallas' Shawn Marion scored 14 points and grabbed nine rebounds. The forward surpassed 16,000 points in his career, becoming the 95th player in NBA history to top the milestone.\n\nTurner chipped in with 17 points for the 76ers and Thaddeus Young had 12.\n\nWright hit seven 3-pointers, including four in the final quarter to keep Philadelphia close.\n\nWright's consecutive 3s brought the 76ers to 96-90 with 2:50 left before Mayo and Kaman squashed the rally. Mayo drove past Hawes on consecutive layups and Kaman hit a bank shot to make it 102-91 with 1:36 remaining.\n\nWright made two more 3-pointers to make it 102-97 with 30.2 seconds left, but the Mavericks closed it out by hitting 5 of 6 free throws down the stretch.\n\nThe Mavericks face a rugged schedule the rest of the week with games against Miami, Memphis and San Antonio.\n\n\"We didn't have a great road trip, obviously,\" Mayo said. \"It was important for us to come home and get a win.\"\n\nThe 76ers kicked off a stretch Tuesday night where they play 10 of 11 on the road. Philadelphia will try to end its slide Wednesday night at Houston.\n\n\"We're all NBA players,\" Wright said. \"Everybody has to step up and do their job for us to be successful.\"\n\nNeither team led by more than five points in the third quarter.\n\nWright hit a 3 that put Philadelphia on top 74-71 with 50.7 seconds left in the third.\n\nMayo tied it with a 3 and hit two free throws to give Dallas the lead heading into the fourth quarter.\n\nDarren Collison, who played 30 minutes in place of Fisher, scored the final five points of the first half to give the Mavericks a 57-52 halftime lead.\n\nYoung snuck inside for a tip-in basket off a miss to tie the game at 52 with 59.5 seconds left before halftime. Carlisle immediately called a timeout and ripped into his team in the huddle.\n\nCollison responded with a 3-pointer and then hit a pair of free throws with 2.7 seconds remaining to put Dallas ahead by five at halftime.\n\nNOTES: There was a moment of silence before the game in tribute to the victims of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. ... Dallas reserve C Elton Brand (strained right groin) did not play. Brand played three seasons with the 76ers before he was released through the amnesty clause in the offseason. ... Philadelphia is 2-7 in December.\n\n¦ Nuggets 112, Spurs 106: In Denver, Danilo Gallinari's clutch shooting overshadowed another big night from Tim Duncan.\n\nGallinari scored a season-high 28 points, outlasting Duncan down the stretch and leading the Denver Nuggets over the San Antonio Spurs 112-106 on Tuesday night.\n\nDuncan had 31 points - also a season best - to go along with 18 rebounds, six assists and five blocks for the Spurs, who closed a 15-point lead to three with 3:38 left before the Nuggets closed it out for their third straight win.\n\n\"We lost control of the tempo of the game but thank God we didn't lose the game,\" Nuggets coach George Karl said.\n\nLost in the setback was a milestone night for Duncan. The forward from Wake Forest eclipsed the 23,000-point mark for his career with two free throws with 9 minutes left in the third quarter.\n\nHe joined Michael Jordan as the only players in NBA history who went to colleges that were in the Atlantic Coast Conference to score at least 23,000 points.\n\nManu Ginobili scored 16 points for the Spurs, who have lost four of their last five. All four losses have come in both games of back-to-backs including a loss Monday to the Western Conference-leading Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\n\"I couldn't be more proud of the effort,\" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. \"It's been a tough month-and-a-half. We asked them to dig down deep and they did.\"\n\nIt took a while but the Spurs did find some rhythm. San Antonio trailed 98-83 before charging back. Patty Mills, who had 15 points, hit two 3-pointers, Duncan scored eight points and Tony Parker hit a 3 to pull the Spurs to 105-102.\n\nGallinari responded with a 3-pointer from the wing - his second in a span of 1:37 - and Andre Miller hit a floater to stretch the lead to 110-102 a minute later.\n\n\"Gallinari just ripped our hearts out with those two 3s,\" Popovich said. \"On the one, Boris (Diaw) contested him better than anybody could possibly contest him and he just drilled that sucker. Making shots at the end of the game often wins games and Gallinari did it.\"\n\nTwo free throws by Duncan and a basket by Ginobili made it 110-106 with 53 seconds left. A turnover by Denver gave the Spurs a chance to get closer but they missed three straight 3-pointers in the final 24 seconds.\n\nKenneth Faried had 19 points and 11 rebounds for Denver despite being sick.\n\n\"A grind, yes,\" he said. \"Top to bottom grind. I kept fighting, but it was so hard to produce like I could have. Looking at the numbers, everybody would say I did pretty good. Personally, I believe I can do even better if I was healthy.\"\n\nThe Spurs trailed 82-69 late in the third quarter when they started fouling JaVale McGee to put him on the line. The strategy appeared to pay off when McGee made just 2 of 8 free throws but San Antonio missed five shots and Denver was able to take a 90-75 lead into the fourth.\n\n\"We were playing so well at that time I think it was a momentum thing rather than an advantage thing,\" Karl said. \"We stopped running and stopped getting into the open court.\"\n\nMcGee wasn't bothered by strategy.\n\n\"I didn't feel anything about it I just felt I should have hit my free throws,\" he said. \"If I would have made my free throws we probably would have had to close the game.\"\n\nFaried opened the second half with a three-point play, Gallinari drained a long 3-pointer and Lawson hit a 16-footer to put Denver up 63-50. The lead grew to 17 on a steal and layup by Ty Lawson midway through the third.\n\nThe Nuggets used an 11-4 run to close out the first half and take a 55-48 lead at the break. Gallinari had 11 points and Faried and Corey Brewer had 10 each to pace Denver in the first half.\n\nThe Nuggets could have enjoyed a bigger lead but 10 turnovers led to 10 points for San Antonio. The Spurs were also 6 for 12 from 3-point range in the first half.\n\nDuncan led the Spurs with 13 points and was a rebound shy of having a double-double in the first half."
