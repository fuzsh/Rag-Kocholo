        "text": "LOS ANGELES – Imagine this sight: Chris Kaman in lederhosen.\n\nOK, maybe that image will never come to fruition, but the Clippers center could be wearing basketball shorts for the German national team.\n\nKaman is waiting to be approved for a German passport to become eligible for the country’s national team. He hopes to join Dallas Mavericks star Dirk Nowitzki on the team and compete in this summer’s Olympic trials and, hopefully, in the Beijing Olympics.\n\n“The USA never approached me about anything, so I just want to be able to play in the summer,” Kaman said. “And this is a way to do it, and it’s not some cheesy summer league.”\n\nKaman has had conversations with Nowitzki about playing on the team, and the 7-footer is following a long procedure to prove he is eligible for the squad. He says he is German because of his father’s bloodline.\n\n“Dirk put me in contact with a couple of people with the German federation, and they’re trying to help me out,” Kaman said. “They’re trying to dig into my history and find out where I’m from. … I don’t know what the percentages is, the rules and everything. You have to jump through a bunch of hoops to get there. And it kind of stinks, but you have go through it.”\n\nPolish solidarity\n\nNot only is Kaman trying to play for Germany, Clippers point guard Dan Dickau is contemplating joining the Polish national team.\n\nDickau is of Polish decent. Proving his bloodline isn’t an issue, but he’s not sure whether he’ll accept Poland’s invitation.\n\nFor Dickau, he wouldn’t play in the Olympics because Poland did not qualify. He would play for at the 2009 European Championships, which Poland is hosting.\n\nSnubbed Part II\n\nMany Clippers were outraged before the All-Star break, when rookie Al Thornton wasn’t chosen for the Sophomore/Rookie game. The top eight rookies are supposed to make the team, and through Sunday’s games, Thornton was averaging 11.3 points per game, second in rookie scoring to Seattle’s Kevin Durant.\n\nThis time, the Clippers were outraged because Thornton was not named the Rookie of the Month for February, when he averaged 17.4 points and 6.3 rebounds per game. Houston’s Luis Scola got the award, even though he averaged 11.7 points and 5.9 rebounds.\n\n“His team won 13 games, but that’s never been the criteria for Rookie of the Month,” Clippers coach Mike Dunleavy said. “It’s been about which rookie’s played the best. And Al’s numbers are clearly much better.”\n\nThomas out\n\nTim Thomas missed a second consecutive game with a strained left groin. Thomas strained the groin in Denver Friday, when he slipped on piece of paper only a few feet from the court."
