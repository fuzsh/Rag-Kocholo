        "text": "Chris Kaman.jpg\n\nChris Kaman, 32, agreed to a two-year deal with the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\n(AP Photo | File)\n\nâ€” Former Central Michigan University star Chris Kaman signed a two-year contract with the Portland Trail Blazers,\n\nor\n\nreported Thursday.\n\nAccording to Freeman, Kaman and the Blazers agreed to a two-year, $9.8 million offer sheet.\n\nKaman was not Portland's first choice, with the Blazers pursuing Spencer Hawes. But Hawes is also being pursued by the Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Clippers and Phoenix Suns, proving too costly for Portland.\n\nKaman, a 7-foot center, was the second choice.\n\noregonlive.com: \"I'm ready to do whatever is called upon me,\" Kaman told The Oregonian in a phone interview. \"I'm a utility guy. I don't think I'm a superstar at any one thing, but I'm a well-rounded basketball player and I have a lot of knowledge of the game.\"\n\nAccording to oregonlive.com, Kaman wanted to come to Portland because he wants to reach the playoffs, he likes the hunting and fishing in the Portland area and is familiar with general manager Neil Olshey and assistant coach Kim Hughes.\n\nHe has played just 105 games in the past two seasons with the Dallas Mavericks and Los Angeles Lakers. Kaman, 32, has averaged 11.7 points and 7.9 rebounds a game during his 11-year NBA career.\n\nLast season with the Lakers, Kaman averaged a career-low 18.7 minutes in 39 games, but still averaged 10.4 points and 5.9 rebounds last season.\n\nKaman, who played his high school basketball for Wyoming Tri-Unity Christian, played three seasons for CMU, leading the Chippewas to the Mid-American Conference title and an NCAA berth in 2003. In his three-year career for the Chippewas, Kaman averaged 15.1 points and 8.5 rebounds in 83 games.\n\nHe was the sixth pick of the 2003 NBA draft, going to the Los Angeles Clippers. He has also played for the New Orleans Hornets, Dallas Mavericks and Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nKaman has dual citizenship and has played internationally for the German National Team."
