        "text": "As the Mavericks ran away from the Phoenix Suns down the stretch Sunday night, they also unveiled their new relay team of centers.\n\nTheir 110-95 victory over a dog-tired group of Suns featured four centers rotating in and out, including rookie Bernard James, who got his first NBA start. After him, Elton Brand, Chris Kaman and Brandan Wright took turns, and all had moments of success.\n\nThey combined to pile up 24 points and 14 rebounds, which made the collective effort quite impressive.\n\nBut it’s inevitable in these situations that at least one player is left feeling frustrated, and Kaman, while trying his best not to rock the boat, admitted the fall from starter to backup to 11-minute man has been tough.\n\n“It’s not really fun sitting over there and playing 10 or 15 minutes a game,” Kaman said. “It’s frustrating. I guess it’s on me. It’s been building up lately. Elton’s been playing pretty well. Coach does what he thinks is going to help the team. That’s all I can really say.”\n\nAsked if he and coach Rick Carlisle have talked about the situation, Kaman said: “We’ve had conversations. It’s not like negative conversations. But it’s frustrating. I’d rather not talk about it and get myself in trouble.”\n\nClearly, though, this isn’t the scenario Kaman thought he was getting into when he signed with the Mavericks.\n\nWhile Kaman is not happy with his personal situation, he understands the only thing that really matters to Carlisle is winning.\n\nIt was a good night in that regard. The Mavericks rolled up a 20-point first-half lead against a Phoenix team playing its fourth game in five nights in three time zones. Shawn Marion had a big night, and Dirk Nowitzki matched Marion’s team-best 18 points.\n\nWhen the Suns made a run and got as close as 81-76 early in the fourth quarter, the Mavericks sprinted away with 10 unanswered points, and that was enough to get them to the win column for the sixth time in eight games.\n\n“This was a big one,” Marion said. “That would have been a miserable flight to Portland if we’d have lost this one tonight. We got four games on this trip, and we can go ahead and make [up] some ground.”\n\nWhile the win will put the Mavericks in a better frame of mind, it was their centers who provided the most interesting storyline.\n\nAnd Nowitzki said he knows the crowded situation is tough on Kaman.\n\n“Chris obviously has to be aggressive because we need his offense,” Nowitzki said. “I think he’s a little discouraged with the minutes right now, but he’s got to stick with it. We’re going to need his scoring eventually in big games.”\n\nBrand, who started one game and then was replaced by James, kept it in perspective.\n\n“Sarge [James] plays with a lot of energy and a lot of passion,” said Brand, who added he had no idea how the center situation would play out in the long run. “I met with Coach before shootaround and he said, ‘Hey, you been playing great and you deserve to start. Just not on our team.’ He said, ‘Just keep it up.’ He said, ‘I know starting’s important to you.’ I told him, ‘No, it’s not. Finishing is. I want to win.’”\n\nAs for James, he’s just happy to be getting an opportunity. His defense is what Carlisle wants on the court to start games.\n\n“I’m glad it happened in my rookie season,” James said of his first start. “I understand I’m still developing as a player. What they want first and foremost is energy and defense and rebounding.”\n\nCarlisle made it clear the center position remains fluid.\n\n“I’m not resigned to anything,” he said. “We used four guys at that position, and they all played an important part in the game. I don’t necessarily want it to be like this. And I’d like there to be some consistency and rhythm to things. But we’re not there yet. We’re still working on it.”"
