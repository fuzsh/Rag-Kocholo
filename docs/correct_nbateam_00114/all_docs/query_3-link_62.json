        "text": "So, this is Plan B?\n\nThe Lakers on Monday agreed to terms with 7-foot center Chris Kaman on a one-season, $3.2-million contract, welcoming a capable but eccentric replacement for Dwight Howard, who took his 57.7 career free-throw percentage to South Texas last week. | TWITTER: What @chriskaman and fans are saying about his move to the Lakers | PHOTOS: Chris Kaman as Maverick, Cav, Hornet and Clipper\n\n“It’s true, I am going to be going back to LA and it’s to play for the Lakers!” Kaman wrote on his Twitter account Monday afternoon, breaking the news first speculated about Sunday night on numerous Internet sites. “I am excited about this move and can’t wait to play! #Lakers.”\n\nLater, he tweeted: “Dang I just sold my house in Manhattan Beach a few weeks ago! #Canisleepinyourbasement”\n\nHe also tweeted: “It’s going to be weird playing in the same building as I did before but with different colors! But excited about the move!”\n\nFree agents can’t officially sign new contracts until Wednesday, and the Lakers issued a statement that read, in part, “the team has been engaged in negotiations with free agent center Chris Kaman and intends to sign him to a contract at the conclusion of the NBA moratorium period.”\n\nThe 31-year-old Kaman played with the Clippers for the first eight seasons of his career before he was dealt to New Orleans in the Chris Paul trade.\n\nKaman is renowned as hard-working and dependable, with a deft touch from near the basket and also on mid-range jump shots. He’s averaged 11.8 points and eight rebounds and made 74.4 percent of his free throws during a 10-year career with the Clippers, Hornets and Dallas Mavericks.\n\nHe’s also an avid outdoorsman, who recently posted a photo of himself draped in a bearskin on Twitter. While with the Clippers in the mid-2000s, Kaman once rented a recreational vehicle and drove from his native Michigan to Alaska for a summer fishing expedition.\n\nHe also enlisted the help of friends to demolish his South Bay home in anticipation of rebuilding it, quite the offseason do-it-yourself project.\n\nIn addition, Kaman played for Germany during the 2008 Beijing Olympics, taking advantage of his dual United States and German citizenship. Last season, he was reunited in Dallas with German superstar Dirk Nowitzki, with whom he averaged 10.5 points and 5.6 rebounds.\n\nThe Clippers drafted Kaman with the sixth overall pick in 2003, following Carmelo Anthony (third), Chris Bosh (fourth) and Dwyane Wade (fifth). And it didn’t take long before he helped breathe life into the moribund franchise.\n\nKaman joined Elton Brand, Sam Cassell and Corey Maggette to lead the Clippers to the second round of the playoffs in 2005-06 after posting a 47-35 record during the regular season, the franchise’s best mark since going 49-33 while playing as the Buffalo Braves in 1974-75.\n\nKaman was also selected to the 2010 Western Conference All-Star team.\n\nWhen NBA commissioner David Stern nixed the Lakers’ deal for Paul in December 2011, the Clippers leaped into the void and sent the veteran center to New Orleans to get the All-Star point guard.\n\nThe Lakers will pair Kaman with fellow 7-footer Pau Gasol, giving them the same sort of size they had with Gasol and Howard last season and with Gasol and Andrew Bynum for four previous seasons. The Gasol-Bynum tandem helped produce consecutive NBA titles in 2009 and ’10.\n\nGasol and Howard never meshed as anticipated, however.\n\nHoward also reportedly didn’t like the style of play employed by Lakers coach Mike D’Antoni and chafed under the demands placed upon him by the uncompromising Kobe Bryant. Howard bolted for the Houston Rockets, who will pay him $30 million less than he could have made with the Lakers.\n\nWith Bryant sidelined by an Achilles’ tendon injury, the Lakers’ starting lineup for opening night figures to be Kaman at center, Gasol at power forward, Metta World Peace at small forward, Steve Blake at shooting guard and Steve Nash at point guard.\n\nThe lineup won’t have foes quaking in their high-tops, but it will serve its purpose as a bridge to next summer, when the Lakers will be freed from their salary-cap woes and general manager Mitch Kupchak can remake the roster, perhaps with Anthony or LeBron James as its centerpiece.\n\nKaman’s contract will expire and Kupchak can either re-sign him or wish him well. James, Anthony and several other superstars will be eligible to become free agents July 1, 2014. So can Bryant and Gasol, if the Lakers decide against signing them to contract extensions.\n\nIn fact, as it stands today, Nash is the only player on the roster signed past next July 1."
