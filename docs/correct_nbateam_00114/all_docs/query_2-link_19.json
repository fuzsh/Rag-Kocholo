        "text": "When the Mavericks signed free agent center Chris Kaman to a one-year, $8 million contract, much was written about Kaman’s post-up abilities giving the Mavericks a new dimension.\n\nThe first quarter of the season, however, has been somewhat of a rude awakening for Kaman.\n\nFirst, Dirk Nowitzki has yet to play, robbing Dallas of being able to isolate the former German national teammates on one side of the floor _ Kaman in the post and Nowitzki at the 3-point arc.\n\nSecond, Kaman and fellow summer addition Elton Brand have discovered that coach Rick Carlisle’s “flow” offense isn’t particularly suited for them.\n\nKaman, however, has scored 15, 20 and 18 points in his last three games despite being limited to a combined 61 minutes, largely due to a sprained ankle suffered against Phoenix.\n\n“Lately it’s been a lot more jump shots,” Kaman said. “I would ideally like to be a little bit more of a post-up factor. But the way our offense goes, it’s just a lot of random movement, a lot of pick and rolls, a lot of pops, dribble handoffs, all kinds of different things.\n\n“We don’t really have a ton of set plays in the half court. We just don’t have that. We try to get the ball on offense and push it. We’ve got some fast guards, some guys who can really shoot the ball. I think they (Mavericks coaches) saw that going in and put us in position to be successful.”\n\nKaman is averaging 14.3 points on 54-percent shooting, so the argument certainly could be made that the Mavericks would benefit from getting him more involved in the offense.\n\nHe has, however, discovered one significant upside to being in Dallas -- the Mavericks’ training staff, consisting of lead trainer Casey Smith and assistant trainer Dionne Calhoun.\n\nKaman has a history of injuries, missing a combined 152 games the past five seasons. When he turned his ankle against the Suns, he feared the worst.\n\n“I’ve had ankle injuries like this in the past and I’m down and out four-to-five days, barely walking on it,” he said. “I felt for sure when I went down that I would be out three to four weeks.”\n\nCarlisle said that after the Phoenix game, he overheard Kaman and Nowitzki talking in the training room. Carlisle said that Nowitzki, who has battled ankle problems most of his career, explained to Kaman that if he attached a machine that pumps ice water around the ankle -- and woke up every two hours overnight to use the machine _ that the swelling and soreness would be reduced significantly.\n\n“Actually, Casey Smith told me what to do,” Kaman corrected. “And then Dirk said, ‘Yeah, do what he said. That’ll really work.’ ”\n\nKaman followed Smith’s instructions and couldn’t believe the results. He hasn’t missed any games, even though Carlisle describes Kaman’s ankle as “almost a glowing purple, which is good because it means that the body has moved fluids in and out of there.”\n\nNow, instead of waking up every two hours, Kaman sets his alarm for 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. for one 15-minute treatment each morning.\n\n“It blows my mind still that I just learned that after 10 years,” Kaman said. “I wish I would have known that a long time ago. My injuries would have taken a third-less of the time (to heal).\n\n“That’s why the Mavericks have the edge, a little bit, too, with guys being injured. They have a great training staff with Casey and Dionne. They do a good job of getting everybody ready to play.”"
