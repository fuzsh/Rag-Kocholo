        "text": "We start off by talking hunting and a little hoops with new Dallas Mavericks Center Chris Kaman. Chris grew up in Grand Rapids, Michigan and has long been a passionate outdoorsman and avid bowhunter. But with college hoops and then living in L.A. while playing for the Clippers for 8 seasons he hasn’t had many opportunities to hunt. That will probably change this season now that Chris is here in Texas with the Mavs. Sure he plays in the NBA- but at heart he’s just a good ‘ole boy like the rest of us.\n\nThen one of the most respected bowhunters in the world makes his return to the show when Fred Eichler of Easton Bowhunting drops in. We talk traditional archery equipment. How far does Fred consider a shot to still be ethical? What advice does a lifelong western big game hunter have for me as I prepare for my first ever mule deer hunt in New Mexico? Fred also talks about some of his most memorable hunting experiences like this Alaskan brown bear hunt where a bear charged within 10 feet of his raft!"
