        "text": "Chris Kaman is listed as day-to-day with a sprained back. (Glenn James/Getty Images)\n\nChris Kaman, who signed with the Dallas Mavericks this offseason, sprained his lower back at Saturday's team practice and is listed as day-to-day, according to Dwain Price of The Fort Worth Star-Telegram:\n\n\"Kaman went out with a sprained lower back, but not considered serious ...but it's enough to keep him out of about half the practice this morning,\" coach Rick Carlisle said.\n\nKaman, 30, signed a one-year deal with the Mavs for $8 million. He is expected to start at center for the team, so the injury is worth keeping an eye on. Kaman has career averages of 11.9 points and 8.3 rebounds and made his only All-Star appearance in 2010. It was his only season in which he played more than 47 games since the 2007-08 season.\n\nDespite the injury, Carlisle said that Dirk Nowitzki, Shawn Marion and the injury-plagued Elton Brand and Vince Carter are in \"great shape for this time of year.\""
