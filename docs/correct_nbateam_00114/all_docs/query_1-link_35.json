        "text": "Chris Kaman has been known to say what’s on his mind, and he clearly wanted to let Mavericks fans know his thoughts on a quick, one-season stay in Dallas.\n\nTo say Kaman did not see eye to eye with coach Rick Carlisle would be putting it mildly. And Kaman rarely puts things mildly.\n\nHesaidTuesdaythat he felt Carlisle played games with him last season, calling the sixth-year Mavericks coach “uptight” and revealing that he knew he was not coming back to Dallas late in the season, which was why he skipped his exit interview.\n\n“I have a hard time with coaches who say one thing in one ear and then behind your back they’re saying something else,” Kaman said. “There was a lot that was said to me that was just misrepresentations and stories that went one way, and the next day it would be completely opposite.\n\n“So that’s why I say he plays games with guys. He’s not going to play games with Dirk [Nowitzki]. But other guys he doesn’t know well or are new, he plays games, and I didn’t get it. I got tired of the conversations.”\n\nKaman, who hasn’t always blended well with coaches but did have a successful run with Mike Dunleavy at the Clippers, started solidly last season while Nowitzki was recovering from knee surgery. But the two of them never meshed well upon Nowitzki’s return. And that led to less playing time for Kaman, who averaged a career-low 20.7 minutes per game, along with 10.5 points and 5.6 rebounds.\n\n“If Dirk had been healthy, I don’t know if I would have even played at all,” Kaman said. “It was tough. Toward the end of the year, I never said this, but I was like, ‘Really, why would you want me back next year?’ That’s why I didn’t go to my exit interview. Not because I didn’t feel like it, but because I felt like, ‘How could they possibly want me back?’ They’re going to play me five minutes a game? That’s not going to work.”\n\nCarlisle wasn’t interested in jumping into the discussion, although he did say: “It didn’t work out well here with Chris, and I take my share of responsibility for it. He’s done very well with coaches named Mike. Hey, I’d love to play for Mike D’Antoni.”\n\nD’Antoni is Kaman’s coach with the Lakers, and Kaman said it’s a night and day difference for him.\n\n“I enjoyed the city, and the fans were great,” Kaman said. “But it doesn’t work out everywhere you go. It’s a different coaching style. Coach Carlisle is uptight and kind of plays games with people here and there. Coach D’Antoni is more relaxed. He lets guys get a feel and make mistakes and play. You can’t micromanage every situation and pull a guy in and out and in and out. It just doesn’t work that way.\n\n“Early in the year when Dirk was injured, I thought I played pretty well,” Kaman said. “When Dirk came back, I saw my minutes decrease and with Coach wanting a more defensive guy at the five [center] spot. That’s his prerogative.\n\n“And it was tough, some games not playing, some games playing six minutes or two minutes and getting an apology that ‘I shouldn’t have played you at all,’ or whatever. It’s something I just wasn’t used to.”"
