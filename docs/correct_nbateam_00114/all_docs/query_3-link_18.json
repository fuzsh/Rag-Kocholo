        "text": "Chris Kaman — all but penciled in as the opening-day starter at center for the Dallas Mavericks — sprained his lower back during the team’s first practice this morning at American Airlines Center. Team officials said the injury limited Kaman’s participation the rest of the practice, but doesn’t appear to be too serious. Kaman, in fact, is expected back at this afternoon’s practice, although in limited duty. “Kaman went out with a sprained lower back, but not considered serious,” coach Rick Carlisle said. “We’ll see how he’s doing for tonight and tomorrow and go from there.”\n\nThe Elton Brand-Chris Kaman pairing isn’t the only Mavericks newcomer duo with L.A. roots that’s reuniting. Darren Collison and O.J. Mayo played for college rivals UCLA and USC, respectively, but they’ve shared a backcourt in a bunch of summer pickup games. They believe that informal experience will be a factor in forming instant chemistry now that they’re the Mavs’ starting guards. “It’s going to help make it a lot easier,” Mayo said. “Competing against Darren, I understand he’s a great player and a heck of a competitor. When we play in the summertime at UCLA, we’re actually on the same team a lot of time just because we’re familiar with each other and feel like that can give us an edge in pickup games.”\n\nAnd then there’s the character that is new Mavs center Chris Kaman, a former teammate on Dirk’s German national team even though the red-blooded American — who has tweeted pictures of his guns, his Texas-sized pickup and a new pair of cowboy boots — was born in blue-collar Wyoming, Mich. “Chris has definitely hit me up for all my hunting contacts,” Mavs president of basketball operations Donnie Nelson said last week. “He wants to bag a white-tail deer and go hog hunting. So, I’m working on that.”\n\n“You know, the one thing that stands out is we don’t have veterans like we did. When you lose a guy like Jason Kidd and JET [Terry] in the backcourt, those are decision-making positions. We’re gonna have to do it in a different way. I think we do have the ability with our new guys to get in the paint and collapse some defenses. We all know what Roddy [Beaubois] and Delonte [West] can do, and to have Collison come in there, those are three young point guards that can get toe-to-toe with folks, pick them up fullcourt and they can get in the paint and make things happen. Jason Kidd and JET, those were two of the great Mavericks that ever put on a uniform in the history of our franchise, so I don’t think those are shoes that are easily filled. But I think these guys are gonna put their stamp on it and do it their own way.”"
