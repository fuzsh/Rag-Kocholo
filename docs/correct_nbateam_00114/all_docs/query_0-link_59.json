        "text": "DALLAS (AP) â€“ Chris Kaman says he has agreed to a deal with the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nThe 7-foot center, who played in New Orleans last season, announced on his Twitter account Wednesday that he is going to Dallas to play with Dirk Nowitizki, his friend and teammate on the German national team during the 2008 Olympics.\n\nThe Mavericks didn't announce any deals Wednesday night.\n\nIn a later tweet, Kaman asked if there was a good lake to live on close to downtown Dallas.\n\nKaman averaged 13.1 points and 7.7 rebounds in 47 games with the Hornets last season. He played the first eight seasons of his career with the Los Angeles Clippers, and was an All-Star in 2010. But he was prone to injuries in the season before and after that."
