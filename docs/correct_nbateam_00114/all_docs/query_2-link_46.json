        "text": "Who are the best Dallas Mavericks of all time? Until Mark Cuban bought the team in 2000, the Dallas Mavericks didn't have much playoff success outside of a few seasons in the mid-to-late 1980s. The foundation of those early Mavs teams featured some of the best players in its history like Rolando Blackman, Mark Aguirre, and Jay Vincent. Once Derek Harper was brought in as the team's point guard, it seemed like the recipe for future success was in place. However, the Mavs couldn't put it all together. Dallas had some of the brightest talent in the league, but couldn't surpass its powerful Western Conference rivals like the Lakers.\n\nBy the time Cuban bought the team, several of the franchise's best players were on the roster. Dirk Nowitzki, Steve Nash, and MIchael Finley were already some of the NBA's brightest young players before Cuban arrived. During the early 2000s, these three players became the best in the league and are considered some of the greatest in basketball history. By the 2005-2006 season, the Mavericks were a Western Conference power and made its first NBA Finals appearance that season. Over the next few years, the Mavs stocked up on great players, like Jason Terry, in order to chase an elusive NBA title. Finally in 2011, behind Nowitzki, widely considered the best Maverick ever, the team won its first NBA championship, getting revenge on the Miami Heat, which had defeated them in 2006. More recently, Luka Doncic has taken over as the face of the franchise, leading the Mavericks to success alongside Kristaps Porzingis and Tim Hardaway Jr.\n\nVote up the best Dallas Mavericks of all time. Then, rerank this list of the greatest Mavs players of all time to who you think should be considered the best ever."
