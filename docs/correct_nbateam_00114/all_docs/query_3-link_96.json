        "text": "LeBron James and his family are awaiting an important milestone Thursday. The Lakers star is hoping his son, Bronny James, will be selected into the NBA on the second day of the league's 2024 draft.\n\nBronny was among the top recruits in the 2023 classic, and there was hope he would reach his full athletic and playmaking potential at USC. Instead, he was merely decent in his lone season with the Trojans, coming off the bench and averaging 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 1.8 assists in 19.3 minutes per game.\n\nThe younger James' performance was impressive considering he was just six months removed from a cardiac event he endured during the summer. Still, he faced many questions about whether he would crack the 58 selections in the 2024 NBA Draft and which team would select him if he did.\n\nBronny's draft day situation is a lot different than what his father faced when entering the NBA 21 years ago. LeBron was viewed as a generational talent, which made him a shoo-in as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft.\n\nHere's what to know about the elder James' draft class, and what it looks like more than two decades after he was chosen.\n\nNOH: Winners and losers from Day 1 of the 2024 NBA Draft, from Zach Edey to Matas Buzelis\n\nWhen was LeBron James drafted?\n\nLeBron James was drafted in 2003. He was the No. 1 overall pick in that year's class after he starred at St. Vincent-St. Mary's high school in Akron.\n\nJames was selected by his hometown team, the Cavaliers, with the top pick. He was believed to be a generational talent who could eventually develop into the face of the NBA.\n\nMore than 20 years later, James has lived up to those expectations. He has won four championships with the Heat (two), Cavaliers (one) and Lakers (one) while rivaling Michael Jordan as one of the best and most successful players in NBA history.\n\nMORE: Why there was no consensus No. 1 pick in the 2024 draft\n\nHow old was LeBron James when he was drafted?\n\nJames was just 18 years old when the Cavaliers selected him with the first pick in the 2003 NBA Draft. He didn't turn 19 until Dec. 30, 2003, so he was one of the NBA's youngest players at the time of his selection.\n\nFor those wondering, Bronny James is still just 19 years old and won't turn 20 until Oct. 6, 2024. He may be a bit older than his father was when he was drafted, but the USC product remains a high-upside player who has plenty of room to continue growing and improving at the NBA level.\n\nMORE: Breaking down the best fits for Bronny James, from the Mavericks to the Raptors\n\nDid LeBron James go to college?\n\nLeBron James was one of the NBA's final draft picks to go pro after only ever playing at the high school level. He did not attend college as a result, choosing to go pro in basketball after starring at St. Vincent-St. Mary's high school and establishing himself as a likely No. 1 pick.\n\nJames does maintain a rooting interest in college sports. He's a noted Ohio State fan, but he pulled for USC during Bronny's lone season with the team.\n\nStill, the elder James' interest doesn't come from ties to an alma mater. It's more about geography and family for him.\n\nMORE: Why LeBron influencing JJ Redick hire, Bronny draft pick would be a mistake\n\nFull 2003 NBA Draft results\n\nJames wasn't the only top-tier talent selected in the 2003 NBA Draft. Four of the top five picks in the draft were perennial All-Stars, while plenty of other top role players like David West, Kyle Korver and Mo Williams came off the board later in the draft.\n\nBelow is a look at all 58 picks in that draft, from James at No. 1 to Andreas Glyniadakis with the final selection.\n\nRoundPickPlayerPositionTeam11LeBron JamesSF/PFCavaliers12Darko MilicicCPistons13Carmelo AnthonySF/PFNuggets14Chris BoshPF/CRaptors15Dwyane WadeSGHeat16Chris KamanCClippers17Kirk HinrichPGBulls18T.

Wade and Bosh have already made it in, while Anthony — a microwave scorer in his prime — should to eventually be enshrined in Springfield.\n\nStill, James remains the best of the bunch in this draft class. He has logged a whopping 263.7 win shares, good for more than double what anyone from his class has collected. That will allow James to coast into the Hall of Fame shortly after he finishes his NBA playing career."
