        "text": "DALLAS â€” Former Central Michigan University star Chris Kaman signed a one-year deal with the Dallas Mavericks, according to the Associated Press, giving the veteran center the opportunity to play with friend Dirk Nowitzki.\n\nKaman has dual citizenship and has participated internationally as a member of the Germany National Team, becoming teammates with Nowitzki for the 2008 Olympics.\n\nThe 7-foot center announced the agreement on his Twitter account Wednesday.\n\nESPN reported that the deal was worth $8 million.\n\nKaman averaged 13.1 points and 7.7 rebounds in 47 games with the Hornets last season. He played the first eight seasons of his career with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nIn 540 career games, Kaman has averaged 11.9 points and 8.3 rebounds. He played in the 2010 NBA All-Star game that the Mavericks hosted at Cowboys Stadium.\n\nAfter starring for CMU, Kaman was the sixth pick of the 2003 NBA Draft, taken by the Los Angeles Clippers. He spent his entire career with the Clippers until last season, when he was part of the deal that sent Chris Paul to the Clippers.\n\nKaman, a graduate of Wyoming Tri-Unity Christian (Mich.), played three seasons for CMU, averaging 14.1 points, 8 rebounds and 2.2 blocked shots per game."
