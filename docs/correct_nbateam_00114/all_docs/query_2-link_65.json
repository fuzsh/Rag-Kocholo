        "text": "Free agency opens in a little more than a month, and the Mavericks already have their targets lined up.\n\nIn no particular order, they’ll pursue Portland’s LaMarcus Aldridge, the LA Clippers’ DeAndre Jordan, Atlanta’s Paul Millsap, Portland’s Wesley Matthews and any point guard with a pulse.\n\nAnd, of course, they will have to make decisions regarding all of their own free agents, too.\n\nThe two Ms will determine whom they can or can’t get, or retain – the market and the money.\n\nSo to get the free-agent juices flowing, we put together our list of best free-agent signings in franchise history Tuesday.\n\nToday, in the interest of fairness, we’ll rate our six pack of the worst free-agent signings in Mavericks' history. It should be noted that a lot of the most disappointing players in the 3 ½ decades of Maverick existence came in trades or via the draft. Not nearly as many players arrived in free agency.\n\nNevertheless, here’s a look at the flops (with player, signing info and why it turned out so bad).\n\nDoug Christie signed a one-year deal on Aug. 19, 2005\n\nIt’s hard to come up with a more disappointing signing in Mavericks’ history than this one. The swingman signed for $1.575 million and played a grand total of seven games before he and the team both agreed that it was not a marriage worth fighting for. Christie and his wife were on one page. The Mavericks weren’t necessarily on another page, but more like another book. Technically, an ankle problem that never healed was cited as the reason he left the team. But he was not a good soldier while he was here. The good news? The Mavericks signed Adrian Griffin three days after Christie was waived and Griffin wound up starting for a team that went to the Finals.\n\nChris Kaman signed a one-year deal on July 13, 2012\n\nIt wasn’t exactly a cost-prohibitive deal. Kaman signed for a relatively small amount for a starting center ($8 million). And yet, he never found a comfort zone with coach Rick Carlisle. Kaman basically had the starting job handed to him, but he averaged just 20 minutes per game and his 10.5 points per game were his lowest in six seasons. His 5.6 rebounds were by far his worst since his rookie season. So the Mavericks were completely content to let Kaman walk after one season. You know things weren’t good if Samuel Dalembert looked like a significant upgrade the next season.\n\nJohn 'Hot Rod' Williams signed a three-year deal on Jan. 22, 1999\n\nAt the time, signing anybody off the street for nearly $6 million over three years qualified as a pretty handsome investment. To say the least, Williams did not deliver. He played just 25 games for the Mavericks before back surgery was needed. He never had the surgery. And never played again. The Mavericks unloaded the final year of his contract in a four-team trade in 2000, but they still got precious little in return (Dana Barros and Howard Eisley). Williams scored just 29 of his career 9,784 points with the Mavericks.\n\nMicheal Williams signed a one-year deal on Dec. 14, 1989\n\nIt’s a long-forgotten fact that the Mavericks signed the former Baylor Bear two days after he was waived by Phoenix. He was not much of a player at the time. But what makes this a bust is that the Mavericks only had Williams for 12 days. He didn’t play a game. Later that season, he got picked up by Charlotte and played well enough to get Indiana’s attention. The Pacers signed him that summer and within two years, he was their starting point guard averaging better than 15 points and eight assists. The moral of this story is that when you are searching for young talent, patience can be a virtue – unless you are talking about Roddy Beaubois.\n\nAlex English signed a two-year deal on Aug. 15, 1990\n\nThe Mavericks knew they were getting English (left in photo) on the tail end of a brilliant career. He was 36 at the time. Still, they expected more than the 9.7 points they got from him in the 1990-91 season. They were so unimpressed they did not exercise their second-year option on the contract, making him a free agent. English signed for $1.5 million and received a $500,000 buyout of the second year of his deal. In 1990, $1.5 million was a princely sum for an NBA player. To say the Mavericks did not get their money’s worth would be an understatement. They simply overestimated what English had left in the tank.\n\nO.J. Mayo signed a one-year deal on July 19, 2012\n\nMayo’s only season in Dallas was good for just one thing – Mayo’s future. He averaged 15.3 points and shot better than 40 percent from 3-point range. But when Dirk Nowitzki returned from knee surgery, Mayo retreated into a shell and wasn’t the same player. That didn’t stop Milwaukee from tossing three years and $24 million at Mayo the next summer. Still, as a focal point on a team that is the only one to miss the playoffs in Dallas in the last 15 seasons, Mayo’s time here qualifies as a bust. By the way, he hasn’t come close to that 15-point average in his first two seasons with the Bucks but will be playing for his next contract in the upcoming season, so fantasy players, keep an eye out on him."
