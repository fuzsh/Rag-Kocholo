DALLAS — O.J. Mayo and Chris Kaman each scored 22 points as the short-handed Dallas Mavericks won their third straight game, beating the Toronto Raptors 109-104 Wednesday night.

The Mavericks, who jumped out to a 16-point lead early in the second quarter, improved to 4-1 for the first time since 2007-08 despite playing without forwards Shawn Marion and Elton Brand. Marion was sidelined with a sprained left knee ligament, and Brand left the team to be with his wife for the birth of his second child.

In addition, All-Star forward Dirk Nowitzki hasn’t played this season while recovering from right knee surgery.

Andrea Bargnani scored 25 points and DeMar DeRozan added 24 for the Raptors, who are 3-14 in Dallas. Starting point guard Kyle Lowry, the team’s leading scorer, didn’t play after spraining his right ankle Tuesday night against Oklahoma City.

Vince Carter hit a pair of 3-pointers for Dallas in the opening minutes of the fourth quarter to spark a 10-3 run. Troy Murphy’s jumper put the Mavericks up 92-77 with 9:01 remaining before Toronto rallied.

Dominic McGuire’s layup cut Dallas’ lead to 105-99, and DeRozan hit a jumper to make it 109-104 with 31.5 seconds left.

The Raptors couldn’t get any closer as they missed a pair of 3-pointers in the final 10 seconds.

After scoring 62 points in his previous two games, Mayo shot 8 for 17. Carter scored 17 points against his former club and Darren Collison chipped in 15.

Kaman started in place of Brand while rookie Jae Crowder filled in for Marion, who is expected to miss three games.

The Mavericks led 61-50 and pushed their advantage to 15 points midway through the third quarter behind Mayo’s seven points.

The Raptors outscored the Mavericks 12-5 the rest of the period to get within 82-74, the closest they’d been since the first quarter.

Toronto’s Amir Johnson had 18 points and 11 rebounds off the bench, and Alan Anderson scored 13.

Kaman scored eight points in the first quarter as the Mavericks jumped out to a 36-24 lead after the first quarter.

The Mavericks stretched their lead to 42-26 early in the second before the Raptors rallied. Bargnani scored five points in an 11-4 run that brought Toronto within nine.
