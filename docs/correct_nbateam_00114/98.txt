German national team player Chris Kaman has signed for the NBA's Dallas Mavericks. The center confirmed the news on his Twitter account early Thursday morning. "Partnering up with [Dirk Nowitzki] and heading to the Mavs," he wrote.

According to ESPN, Kaman is signing for Dallas on a one-year deal worth $8 million (6.54 million Euros).

Playing for the New Orleans Hornets last season, he averaged 13.1 points and 7.7 rebounds in 47 games. "I want to say thanks to the Hornet fans for all the support, even though our marriage was a short one," he added.

Prior to joining the Hornets last year, Kaman spent eight seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers, and was named an All Star in 2010.

Kaman, 30, joins his 2008 Beijing Olympics teammate Dirk Nowitzki. The two also played together at the European Basketball Championship in Lithuania last summer. Though American-born, the seven-foot center qualifies to play for Germany through his great-grandparents, who were citizens of the country.

Two German national team players last played together in the NBA seven years ago. German-born center Shawn Bradley played with Nowitzki in Dallas from 1998 to 2005.
