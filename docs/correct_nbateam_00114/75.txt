DALLAS — Chris Kaman is set for his debut with the Dallas Mavericks after missing part of the preseason and the first two games with a strained right calf.

The 7-foot centre figures to play an important role in helping the Mavericks survive a few weeks without injured star Dirk Nowitzki, but coach Rick Carlisle said he wasn’t expecting much Saturday night against Charlotte.

Kaman isn’t starting. Brandan Wright was in the lineup again after scoring in double figures as the starter in Dallas’ first two games.

A teammate of Nowitzki’s on the German national team, Kaman has been out two weeks after averaging a team-high 12.8 points in four preseason games.

Nowitzki had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Oct. 19 and is expected to miss at least 10 games.
