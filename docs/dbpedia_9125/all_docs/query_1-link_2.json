        "text": "Capital of Equatorial Guinea\n\n\"Capital of Equatorial Guinea\" redirects here. For the Equatorial Guinea's future capital, see Ciudad de la Paz.\n\nCapital city in Bioko Norte, Equatorial Guinea\n\nMalabo ( mə-LAH-boh, Spanish: [maˈlaβo] ⓘ; formerly Santa Isabel [ˈsantajsaˈβel] ⓘ) is the capital of Equatorial Guinea and the province of Bioko Norte. It is located on the north coast of the island of Bioko (Bube: Etulá, and as Fernando Pó by the Europeans). In 2018, the city had a population of approximately 297,000 inhabitants.\n\nSpanish is the official language of the city and of the country as well, but Pichinglis is used as a language of wider communication across Bioko island, including Malabo.[3]\n\nMalabo is the oldest city in Equatorial Guinea. Ciudad de la Paz is a planned community under construction in mainland Equatorial Guinea which was designed to replace Malabo as the capital. The institutions of governance of Equatorial Guinea began the process of locating to Ciudad de la Paz in February 2017.[4]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nEuropean discovery and Portuguese occupation\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1472, in an attempt to find a new route to India, the Portuguese navigator Fernão do Pó, encountered the island of Bioko, which he called Formosa.[5] Later, the island was named after its discoverer, Fernando Pó. At the beginning of the 16th century, specifically in 1507, the Portuguese Ramos de Esquivel made a first attempt at colonization on the island of Fernando Pó. He established a factory in Concepción (now Riaba) and developed plantations of sugarcane.[citation needed]\n\nWith the treaties of San Ildefonso in 1777 and El Pardo in 1778, during the reign of the Spanish King Charles III, the Portuguese gave to the Spanish the islands of Fernando Pó, Annobón, and the right to conduct trade in the mainland, an area of influence of approximately 800 000 km2 in Africa, in exchange for the Colonia del Sacramento in Río de la Plata and the Santa Catarina Island off the Brazilian coast (occupied by the Spaniards) during a recent war trying to stop Portuguese expansion in the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. The area stretched from the Niger Delta to the mouth of Ogooué River — in current Gabon — and included, besides the islands of Fernando Pó and Annobón, the islets of Corisco and Elobeyes. Spain wasn't interested in these lands because already had vast colonies in other parts of the world, Spain lost interest in Spanish Guinea in 1827 and authorized the British to use the island as a base for suppressing the slave trade.[citation needed]\n\nBritish presence\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1821, the Nelly approached the island of Fernando Pó. He found it abandoned and founded the establishments of Melville Bay (now Riaba) and San Carlos (now Luba). Some years later, another British captain, William Fitzwilliam Owen, decided to colonize the island and in the north of it — on the site of the present capital — erected a base for British ships hunting slave traders. Thus, on 25 December 1827, Port Clarence was founded on the ruins of a previous Portuguese settlement.[5] The name was chosen in honor of the Duke of Clarence, who later became King William IV. The Bubis indigenous to the island called it Ripotó (place of the foreigners). The population of the capital was increased by the arrival of slaves freed by the British. These freedmen were settled in Port Clarence before the establishment of Sierra Leone as a colony for freed slaves. The descendants of these freed slaves remained on the island. They joined other migrants who arrived as free workers from Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Benin, Nigeria and Cameroon, and became the population group called Creole or fernandinos, whose language was Pichinglis, a Bantu-English Creole with some Spanish elements.\n\nDuring the British period, the British consul automatically became the governor of the colony, including Governor John Beecroft, a British mulatto [citation needed] who modernized the capital, and whose work was later recognized by Spain with a monument in Punta Fernanda.\n\nSpanish definitive control and new capital\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1844, when Queen Isabella II of Spain ruled after the regency of her mother Maria Cristina and Baldomero Espartero, in an attempt to modernize Spain and rescue its heritage, Spain let the UK know its desire to regain control of the colony and thus the island. It took another decade to implement this direct control. The capital already had more dynamic and Protestant religious missions which were very successful. Both factors helped to change the attitude of Spain, in addition to internal reasons already alluded.\n\nSpain again took control of the island in 1855 and the capital, Port Clarence, was renamed Santa Isabel, in honor of Queen Isabella II.[5] The capital of the island of Fernando Pó became the capital of Equatorial Guinea.\n\nIts present name was given to the town in 1973 as part of the campaign of President Francisco Macías Nguema to replace place names of European origin with African names, in this case honoring Malabo Löpèlo Mëlaka, the last Bubi king. Malabo, the son of King Moka, surrendered to the Spaniards. His uncle Sas Ebuera, head of the Bubi warriors, claimed to represent legitimate Bubi rule and continued resisting, confronting the Spanish openly in 1898.[6] After the Spanish killed Sas Ebuera, Malabo became the king unopposed, but with no authority. Bubi clans and settlements were slow to accept Spanish sovereignty over the island, and the full conquest and pacification of the island was not achieved until 1912.\n\nReign of Terror\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the so-called Reign of Terror of Macías Nguema, the dictator suppressed much of the intelligentsia of the country, initiating the process of taking over the positions of the public administration by part of the natives of Mongomo and clan Esangui.[citation needed]\n\nThe infamous Black Beach prison, also known as Blay Beach prison (or Playa Negra prison), sits at the mouth of the Cónsul River, beside the black beach and behind the Governor's Palace and barracks. Several people have been jailed there during the 35 years of dictatorship. Among those imprisoned and tortured are many political leaders such as Rafael Upiñalo (Movimiento), Fabián Nsue (UP), Felipe Ondo Obiang (FDR), Martín Puye of Movement for the Self-Determination of Bioko Island (MAIB) or Plácido Micó Abogo of the Social Democratic Convergence for Social Democracy (CPDS). A group of mercenaries were jailed at Black Beach for the 2004 coup d'état attempt against President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.[citation needed]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nMalabo is situated in the north of the island of Bioko, at coordinates 3° 45' 7.43\" North and 8° 46' 25.32\" East. The south of Malabo is limited by the Cónsul River and just across the river, south-west, is the hospital. West of the city, located about 9 km from the center of Malabo, is renewed Malabo International Airport. In the coastal region north of the city are the bays and capes. The elder is the punta de la Unidad Africana located just behind the Malabo Government Building and which occupies the entire eastern part of the Bay of Malabo. Another cape of importance is punta Europa located in the west of the city near to the airport.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nMalabo features a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen Am). Malabo receives on average 1,850 millimetres or 73 inches of rain per year. The city has a pronounced, albeit short, sunnier (but still cloudy) dry season from December through February. January is normally its driest month with 29 millimetres or 1.14 inches of rain falling on average. It also has a very long cloudy wet season that covers the remaining nine months from March to November. On average, the months hit hardest by the wet season are September and October, which receive 500 millimetres (20 in) of rain and showers between them.\n\nDaytime temperatures do not vary at all day to day, and vary only a few degrees throughout the entire year. At night, the average low temperature is 20 to 21 °C (68 to 70 °F) in every month of the year but January to April have a slightly higher diurnal range because it is clearer. Nonetheless, with only 1,020 hours of sunshine per year, Malabo is one of the cloudiest,[7] wettest and most lightning-prone capitals of the world, and experiences much fog and haze even when it is not raining in the driest months.\n\nAdministration\n\n[edit]\n\nThe mayor is María Coloma Edjang Mbengono who establishes the municipal services prescribed by law, which are the responsibility of the municipality. These include drinking water and others public sources, lighting, paving of roads, cemeteries, cleaning and sanitation, the sanitary waste treatment and waste, disinfecting, emergency first aid, health inspections and drinks, health inspection of poor housing, public banks, slaughterhouses, markets and the elimination of stagnant water.\n\nMayors since 1960\n\n[edit]\n\nWilwardo Jones Níger [de]\n\nAbilio Balboa Arking\n\nAntonio Ribeiro Ebuera\n\nJulio Bonete Eiye\n\nJulián Ehapo Bomaho\n\nVidal Djoni Bekoba\n\nTomás Alfredo King Tomas\n\nRosendo Toichoa Borico\n\nFelipe Beta Tobachi\n\nAntonio Reibeira Ebuera\n\nElías Manuel Macho Ricacha\n\nBasilio Cañadas Idjabe\n\nCristina Djombe Djangani\n\nVicente Ebong Uwa\n\nBernardino Edu Oba\n\nVictorino Bolekia Bonay\n\nGabriel Mba Bela\n\nMaría Coloma Edjang Mbengono\n\nIsabel Eraul Ivina (2004[9])\n\n[10]\n\nCultural centres\n\n[edit]\n\nThrough the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation for Development (AECID), are made several development projects at both regional and national level. Headquartered in the Technical Cooperation Office in Malabo (created in 1984), carried out actions for the development of the culture, health, education and institutional strengthening. Stressing the Cultural Center of Spain in Malabo (CCEM), founded in 2003, where young people are encouraged to feel a cultural space where they can unleash their creative freedom.

The city also hosts the National Library, built in 1916.[11][12]\n\nTourism\n\n[edit]\n\nThe tourism sector is seeing significant expansion.[citation needed] Since the discovery of oil, numerous infrastructural developments have been made.[citation needed] The city of Malabo is a focal point for tourism in Equatorial Guinea, due to its direct connections with major tourist attractions on the island of Bioko.[13] Nearby tourist attractions include the following:\n\nSan Antonio de Ureca: A small town located in the south of the island rich in primates, birds, beaches, and waterfalls. During the months of November to February, it is possible to observe the spawning of leatherback sea turtles during the night.[citation needed]\n\nIlachi or Iladyi Waterfalls: They are the largest waterfalls in the country with more than 250 meters of fall. They are approximately a 45-minute walk from the city of Moka.[citation needed]\n\nPico Basilé: The highest mountain in Equatorial Guinea, it belongs to the volcanic shield next to Mount Cameroon and to the great caldera of Luba.

It was the first visit of a European team in the country, and the match was criticized by several organizations, including the president of the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional, Javier Tebas, due to the political situation of the country and the government of Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.[24][25]\n\nSome of the top clubs in the country, who have won several times the Equatoguinean Primera División are from the city of Malabo. The club with the most league titles is the CD Elá Nguema with 14.

The country's production has reached 360,000 barrels per day (57,000 m3/d) as of 2005 , an increase which led to a doubling of the city's population, but for the vast majority, very little of that wealth has been invested in development.[29]\n\nInternational relations\n\n[edit]\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\n\n[edit]\n\nGuadalajara, Mexico\n\nCelaya, Mexico\n\nAcayucan, Mexico[30]\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Category:People from Malabo\n\nJuan Tomás Ávila Laurel, Equatoguinean author and activist\n\nJohn Batchelor, British rugby player\n\nRita Bosaho, Equatoguinean-Spanish politician and activist\n\nElsa López, Spanish writer and poet\n\nGallery\n\n[edit]\n\nMalabo coast line\n\nAfrica portal\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
