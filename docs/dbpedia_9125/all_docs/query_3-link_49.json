It contains five small islands in the Atlantic Ocean – Bioko, Corisco, Annobón, Elobey Chico (Small Elobey), and Elobey Grande (Great Elobey).\n\nWhile Bioko Island is known for its volcanic formations, harbors, and beaches, Annobon Island has a tropical climate with heavy rainfall and windstorms. Dense tropical rainforest covers Equatorial Guinea. This makes it home to diverse flora, fauna, and animal life such as gorillas, chimpanzees, leopards, buffalo, antelope, elephants, hippopotamuses, and crocodiles."
