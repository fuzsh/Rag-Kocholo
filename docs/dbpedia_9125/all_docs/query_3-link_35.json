        "text": "# 10 Surprising Facts About Malabo\n\nMalabo, the capital of Equatorial Guinea, is a city steeped in history and unique cultural influences. This small island city is not frequently spotlighted in mainstream tourism, which makes its many surprising facets all the more intriguing to discover. From its complex colonial past to its modern-day quirks, Malabo houses several secrets that defy common expectations. In this article, we explore an array of fascinating facts about Malabo that even seasoned travelers might find surprising.\n\n1. A Capital City on an Island\n\nMany are unaware that Malabo, the capital of Equatorial Guinea, is actually located on an island—Bioko Island. This geographic fact is intriguing because capital cities are most commonly found on continental land rather than on islands, especially for countries that possess mainland territories. Bioko Island is situated off the coast of Cameroon, in the waters of the Gulf of Guinea. The island itself is a product of volcanic activity, which has shaped its landscape and contributed to its lush tropical environment.\n\nThe decision to keep Malabo on Bioko Island despite the country’s mainland territory is largely due to historical reasons. Malabo was established by the British in 1827 under the name Port Clarence. It was later renamed Santa Isabel when the Spanish took over and still retains its status as the nation’s capital despite Equatorial Guinea gaining independence in 1968. The presence of this capital city on an island demonstrates the intriguing colonial legacies that have shaped African geopolitical boundaries.\n\n2. Colonial Architecture Still Stands\n\nWalking through the streets of Malabo, one can’t help but notice the remnants of Spanish colonial architecture. Despite the passage of time and the weathering of tropical climate conditions, these structures stand as silent witnesses to the island’s storied past. The architecture ranges from charmingly dilapidated buildings that tell tales of former grandeur to well-preserved structures that are still in use today.\n\nThe Spanish influence is evident in Malabo’s Cathedral of Santa Isabel, which is an iconic landmark in the city. Its towers and arches reflect the colonial era’s aesthetic, and it acts as a historical and cultural beacon within the city. Similarly, the Presidential Palace is a prime example of traditional Spanish architecture, which adds to the contrast of old and new that characterizes the city.\n\n3. Diversity in Language\n\nWhile Spanish is the official language of Equatorial Guinea, Malabo’s linguistic landscape is more diverse than one might expect. Due to the colonial history and migration flows, several languages are spoken in the city. French and Portuguese are recognized as official languages in the country too, reflecting the broader linguistic policies of African union and overlap of colonial influence in the region.\n\nIn addition, local languages like Fang and Bubi are spoken by the indigenous population, demonstrating the vibrant cultural mix of Malabo. Fang is predominantly used in the mainland, whereas Bubi is native to Bioko Island. This blend of international European languages with indigenous tongues makes for a surprisingly multi-lingual environment in what might otherwise be perceived as a homogenous city.\n\n4. A Melting Pot of Cuisines\n\nThe cuisine in Malabo is an unexpected delight for food enthusiasts. The city serves as a melting pot of flavors, influenced by its colonial past as well as its geographic position. The traditional dishes often consist of a protein, such as chicken, fish, or game meat, accompanied by starches like cassava, plantains, or rice. The influence of Spanish cuisine is also apparent with the presence of dishes ranging from paella to tapas, and the use of spices like cayenne pepper and nutmeg, which add a distinctive twist to the local fare.\n\nMoreover, due to its coastal location, Malabo’s seafood is particularly noteworthy. Restaurants and local eateries offer a variety of fish, lobster, and other marine delicacies that are freshly caught. This has fostered an intriguing culinary scene that combines the rich flavors of Africa with subtle hints of Europe—perfectly encapsulating Malabo’s essence on a plate.\n\n5. Rich in Biodiversity\n\nThe island of Bioko, where Malabo sits, is a biodiversity hotspot that goes largely uncelebrated. The island is home to various unique species of flora and fauna, many of which are endemic and found nowhere else in the world. The dense rainforest ecosystem supports a variety of wildlife, including the critically endangered drill monkey and several species of sea turtles that nest on the island’s shores.\n\nBioko Island’s biodiversity is so significant that it has several protected areas designed to conserve this unique environment. The southern part of the island, in particular, has lush cloud forests and volcanic landscapes that provide habitats for an astonishing array of species. Conservation efforts are ongoing, with local and international stakeholders working together to protect this treasure trove of biodiversity.\n\n6. Oil-Based Economy\n\nOne might not associate Malabo with oil at first glance, but the discovery of significant oil and gas reserves has dramatically transformed the city and the country’s economy. Since the mid-1990s, Equatorial Guinea has become one of sub-Saharan Africa’s largest oil producers, and the revenue from these industries has had a visible impact on the development of Malabo. The city has seen a surge in infrastructure projects, including the construction of new roads, buildings, and even plans for a future city on the mainland called Oyala.\n\nHowever, this oil wealth has also brought controversy, particularly regarding the distribution of resources and socioeconomic inequality. There are stark contrasts within Malabo between modern, wealthy areas and impoverished neighborhoods, highlighting the complex challenges that come with such rapid economic transformation.\n\n7. Influence of Spanish Football\n\nFootball, or soccer, is widely popular in Malabo, with the sport’s culture and fervor echoing that of Spain, the former colonial power. Spanish football in particular, has a significant following in the city, and it is not uncommon to find locals passionately supporting La Liga teams such as FC Barcelona or Real Madrid.\n\nThis interest in football extends to the local scene as well, with Malabo hosting the Nuevo Estadio de Malabo—a modern facility that reflects the importance of the sport in the city. The stadium is a focal point for local and national matches and has even been used for international events, demonstrating the role football plays in Malabo’s community and cultural identity.\n\n8. Volcanic Origins and Hot Springs\n\nMalabo’s very existence is owed to the volcanic activity that formed the island of Bioko. The island itself is the tip of a volcanic mountain range, and although the volcanoes are not currently active, their legacy can still be felt through the region’s geography and geothermal features. One of the main attractions related to this volcanic past is the hot springs found on the island, which provide a unique experience for visitors and locals alike.\n\nThese geothermal hot springs are believed to have medicinal properties and offer a relaxing retreat surrounded by the lush vegetation of the island’s rainforests. They serve as a testament to the island’s geological history and are a natural wonder that many visitors find surprising in such a small and otherwise urban setting.\n\n9. Unusual Time Zone for Its Location\n\nMalabo is located in West Africa; however, it operates on the Central African Time zone (CAT), which is typically associated with countries that are further east on the African continent. This decision is somewhat peculiar since its geographical position would be more aligned with the West Africa Time zone (WAT). This time zone anomaly can be perplexing for visitors who might expect the city’s time to match its longitudinal location.\n\nThis choice of time zone further emphasizes Malabo’s complex relationship with its history and regional identity. It is a small but intriguing glimpse into the arbitrary nature of time-keeping and how historical legacies continue to influence the present.\n\n10. Island of Cocoteros\n\nBioko Island, and by extension Malabo, is often referred to as the island of “cocoteros” or coconut palms. These trees are emblematic of the tropical island climate and landscape, and their presence is both aesthetically pleasing and economically beneficial. Coconut palms not only provide an iconic backdrop for the city’s beaches and streets, but they also contribute to the local economy through the production of coconuts and related products.\n\nThis ubiquitous image of Malabo and Bioko Island as a paradise framed by coconut palms adds to the exotic appeal for travelers. It symbolizes the fertility of the land and the sweet, leisurely pace of life that many associate with tropical island destinations."
