It is located on the north coast of the island of Bioko, formerly known by the Bubis, its indigenous inhabitants, as Etulá, and as Fernando Pó by the Europeans. In 2018, the city had a population of approximately 297,000 inhabitants. Spanish is the official language of the city and of the country as well. Spanish is the most-spoken language and practically the only one used, except some French and Portuguese.\n\nMalabo is the oldest city in Equatorial Guinea. Many buildings in the city are built in a colonial style, dating from the times of Spanish rule, coexisting with modern buildings built since independence. The downtown streets have a square design, with pedestrian areas.\n\nCiudad de la Paz is a planned city currently under construction in mainland Equatorial Guinea which was designed to replace Malabo as the capital. The institutions of governance of Equatorial Guinea began the process of locating to Ciudad de la Paz in February 2017.\n\nNearby cities:"
