        "text": "Malabo is the capital of Equatorial Guinea, a country of western Africa. The city lies on the coast of Bioko, an island in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nMalabo is Equatorial Guinea’s center of business and banking. It is also a major port. In addition, oil is produced off the coast of Bioko. The oil industry brings money to Malabo.\n\nHundreds of years ago Bioko was a stopping point for slave traders. In 1827 Great Britain founded Malabo on the island. For several years the British used Malabo as a base for their ships. They were working to end the area’s slave trade. Freed slaves began to settle the town.\n\nFor much of the 1800s and 1900s Spain ruled Bioko and some nearby land as a colony. Equatorial Guinea became an independent country in 1968. Malabo was the country’s capital. Population (2015 estimate), 257,000."
