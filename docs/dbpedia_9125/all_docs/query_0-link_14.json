        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nEquatorial Guinea gained independence in 1968 after 190 years of Spanish rule; it is one of the smallest countries in Africa consisting of a mainland territory and five inhabited islands. The capital of Malabo is located on the island of Bioko, approximately 25 km from the Cameroonian coastline in the Gulf of Guinea. Between 1968 and 1979, autocratic President Francisco MACIAS NGUEMA virtually destroyed all of the country's political, economic, and social institutions before being deposed by his nephew Teodoro OBIANG NGUEMA MBASOGO in a violent coup. President OBIANG has ruled since October 1979 and has been elected several times, most recently in 2016. Although nominally a constitutional democracy since 1991, presidential and legislative elections since 1996 have been considered flawed. The president exerts almost total control over the political system and has placed legal and bureaucratic barriers that hinder political opposition. Equatorial Guinea experienced rapid economic growth in the early years of the 21st century due to the discovery of large offshore oil reserves in 1996. Production peaked in late 2004 and has slowly declined since, although aggressive searches for new oilfields continue. Despite the country's economic windfall from oil production, resulting in massive increases in government revenue in past years, generally lower global oil prices since 2014 and depreciating oil fields have placed significant strain on the state budget. While oil revenues have mainly been used for the development of infrastructure, corruption has hindered socio-economic development and there have been limited improvements in the population's living standards. Equatorial Guinea continues to seek to diversify its economy and to increase foreign investment. The country hosts major regional and international conferences and continues to seek a greater role in international affairs, and leadership in the sub-region.\n\nÂ\n\nTip\n\nVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.\n\nDefinitions and Notes\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nCentral Africa, bordering the Bight of Biafra, between Cameroon and Gabon\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n2 00 N, 10 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 28,051 sq km\n\nland: 28,051 sq km\n\nwater: 0 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 145\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly smaller than Maryland\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 528 km\n\nborder countries (2): Cameroon 183 km; Gabon 345 km\n\nCoastline\n\n296 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12 nm\n\nexclusive economic zone: 200 nm\n\nClimate\n\ntropical; always hot, humid\n\nTerrain\n\ncoastal plains rise to interior hills; islands are volcanic\n\nElevation\n\nhighest point: Pico Basile 3,008 m\n\nlowest point: Atlantic Ocean 0 m\n\nmean elevation: 577 m\n\nNatural resources\n\npetroleum, natural gas, timber, gold, bauxite, diamonds, tantalum, sand and gravel, clay\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 10.1% (2018 est.)\n\narable land: 4.3% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent crops: 2.1% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent pasture: 3.7% (2018 est.)\n\nforest: 57.5% (2018 est.)\n\nother: 32.4% (2018 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\nNA\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nonly two large cities over 30,000 people (Bata on the mainland, and the capital Malabo on the island of Bioko); small communities are scattered throughout the mainland and the five inhabited islands as shown in this population distribution map\n\nNatural hazards\n\nviolent windstorms; flash floods\n\nvolcanism: Santa Isabel (3,007 m), which last erupted in 1923, is the country's only historically active volcano; Santa Isabel, along with two dormant volcanoes, form Bioko Island in the Gulf of Guinea\n\nGeography - note\n\ninsular and continental regions widely separated; despite its name, no part of the Equator passes through Equatorial Guinea; the mainland part of the country is located just north of the Equator\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n1,679,172 (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 154\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Equatorial Guinean(s) or Equatoguinean(s)\n\nadjective: Equatorial Guinean or Equatoguinean\n\nEthnic groups\n\nFang 85.7%, Bubi 6.5%, Mdowe 3.6%, Annobon 1.6%, Bujeba 1.1%, other 1.4% (1994 est.)\n\nLanguages\n\nSpanish (official) 67.6%, other (includes Fang, Bubi, Portuguese (official), French (official), Portuguese-based Creoles spoken in Ano Bom) 32.4% (1994 est.)\n\nmajor-language sample(s):\n\nLa Libreta Informativa del Mundo, la fuente indispensable de informaciÃ³n bÃ¡sica.

Despite a boom in oil production in the 1990s, authoritarianism, corruption, and resource mismanagement have concentrated the benefits among a small elite. These practices have perpetuated income inequality and unbalanced development, such as low public spending on education and health care. Unemployment remains problematic because the oil-dominated economy employs a small labor force dependent on skilled foreign workers. The agricultural sector, Equatorial Guineaâs main employer, continues to deteriorate because of a lack of investment and the migration of rural workers to urban areas. About three-quarters of the population lives below the poverty line.\n\nEquatorial Guineaâs large and growing youth population â about 60% are under the age of 25 â is particularly affected because job creation in the non-oil sectors is limited, and young people often do not have the skills needed in the labor market. Equatorial Guinean children frequently enter school late, have poor attendance, and have high dropout rates. Thousands of Equatorial Guineans fled across the border to Gabon in the 1970s to escape the dictatorship of Francisco MACIAS NGUEMA; smaller numbers have followed in the decades since. Continued inequitable economic growth and high youth unemployment increases the likelihood of ethnic and regional violence.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 38.73% (male 164,417/female 159,400)\n\n15-24 years: 19.94% (male 84,820/female 81,880)\n\n25-54 years: 32.72% (male 137,632/female 135,973)\n\n55-64 years: 4.69% (male 17,252/female 22,006)\n\n65 years and over: 3.92% (male 13,464/female 19,334) (2020 est.)\n\n2022 population pyramid\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 72.2\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 66.7\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 5.4\n\npotential support ratio: 18.5 (2021 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 20.3 years\n\nmale: 19.9 years\n\nfemale: 20.7 years (2020 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 191\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n3.5% (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 5\n\nBirth rate\n\n29.95 births/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 30\n\nDeath rate\n\n8.95 deaths/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 62\n\nNet migration rate\n\n13.96 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 3\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nonly two large cities over 30,000 people (Bata on the mainland, and the capital Malabo on the island of Bioko);

Forestry and farming are minor components of GDP. Although preindependence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings, the neglect of the rural economy since independence has diminished the potential for agriculture-led growth. Subsistence farming is the dominant form of livelihood. Declining revenue from hydrocarbon production, high levels of infrastructure expenditures, lack of economic diversification, and corruption have pushed the economy into decline in recent years and limited improvements in the general populationâs living conditions. Equatorial Guineaâs real GDP growth has been weak in recent years, averaging -0.5% per year from 2010 to 2014, because of a declining hydrocarbon sector. Inflation remained very low in 2016, down from an average of 4% in 2014.\n\nÂ\n\nAs a middle income country, Equatorial Guinea is now ineligible for most low-income World Bank and the IMF funding. The government has been widely criticized for its lack of transparency and misuse of oil revenues and has attempted to address this issue by working toward compliance with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. US foreign assistance to Equatorial Guinea is limited in part because of US restrictions pursuant to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.\n\nÂ\n\nEquatorial Guinea hosted two economic diversification symposia in 2014 that focused on attracting investment in five sectors: agriculture and animal ranching, fishing, mining and petrochemicals, tourism, and financial services. Undeveloped mineral resources include gold, zinc, diamonds, columbite-tantalite, and other base metals. In 2017 Equatorial Guinea signed a preliminary agreement with Ghana to sell liquefied natural gas (LNG); as oil production wanes, the government believes LNG could provide a boost to revenues, but it will require large investments and long lead times to develop.\n\nReal GDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$23.86 billion (2020 est.)\n\n$25.09 billion (2019 est.)\n\n$26.68 billion (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 145\n\nReal GDP growth rate\n\n-3.2% (2017 est.)\n\n-8.6% (2016 est.)\n\n-9.1% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 213\n\nReal GDP per capita\n\n$17,000 (2020 est.)\n\n$18,500 (2019 est.)\n\n$20,400 (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 99\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$10.634 billion (2019 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices)\n\n1.2% (2019 est.)\n\n1.3% (2018 est.)\n\n0.7% (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 74\n\nGDP -
