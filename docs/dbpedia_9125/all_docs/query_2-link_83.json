        "text": "Malabo, the small but striking capital city of Equatorial Guinea is on the island of Bioko.\n\nEquatorial Guinea is located on the coast of western Africa. It is a tiny country with a population less than one million. The mainland is bordered by Cameroon to the north and Gabon to the east and south, with two large inhabited islands in the Gulf of Guinea. Malabo is the capital, on the island of Bioko. On the mainland, Bata is the major city.\n\nSpanish is spoken by a majority of the population, though Spanish, Portugese and French are official languages. Fang and Bubi are the major native dialects.\n\nSince the discovery of oil, Equatorial Guinea has, at least on paper, one of the highest percapita incomes on the planet. Despite this, income and day-to-day life for many Equatorial Guineans has improved little. Progress is moving along, though, and new infrastructure and modernization projects are under construction or even finished, especially on Bioko and around Malabo. Equatorial Guinea, is sub- Saharan Africa’s third largest oil producer. In recent years the infrastructure of Equatorial Guinea has vastly improved. Most of the country’s roads are now paved, and the number of airports and travel connections has risen. While the tourist industry is still in its infancy, independent travelers will find much to visit and explore.\n\nMalabo is the small but striking capital city on the island of Bioko. It has a Spanish colonial architecture and pleasant open plazas. The bustling market and the Spanish Colonial Center are worth a visit.\n\nThe Equatorial Guinea has a varied and spectacular terrain. Beautiful beaches and coastal plains turn to rolling hills in the interior. Its coastal mainland and two islands are home to mountain peaks, volcanoes, and a variety of wildlife. Equatorial Guinea has no shortage of beaches, jungles, and natural sites worth seeing. The spectacular Pico Malabo volcano is an easy day trip from the city of Malabo. Arrange an expedition to take in its breathtaking views. The area around the mainland city of Bata boasts several beautiful and undeveloped beaches.\n\nMarkets can be found in most cities and towns. In addition to local produce, bush meat, and textiles, many markets feature local handicrafts.\n\nMonte Alen National Park’s tropical forests are home to gorillas, elephants, chimpanzees, and many other creatures. Hire a local villager for a guided day trek through the park’s 1,400 kilometers of rain forest.\n\nSituated in the southern highlands of Bioko Island, the Moca Valley is home to the indigenous Buki people and offers plenty in the way of hiking and flora sightseeing.\n\nHead to the island of Annobon to see three of the country’s most famous mountain peaks, Pico del Fuega, Pico Centro, and Pico Surtado. Pico Surtado, the southernmost peak, is an inactive volcano whose crater now contains an impressive lake."
