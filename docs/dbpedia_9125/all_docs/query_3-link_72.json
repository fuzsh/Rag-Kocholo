        "text": "Visa requirements\n\nExpats need a valid passport and a visa to enter Equatorial Guinea. Most expats will obtain a business or work visa, which can be sponsored by their employer. Visas are typically valid for 30 days but can be extended for longer stays. Depending on the length of stay, expats may need to register with the local authorities.\n\nLanguage resources\n\nSpanish and French are the official languages of Equatorial Guinea, with many locals also speaking a local language called Fang. English may be spoken in some professional settings and expat communities. To ease integration, consider learning Spanish before arriving or during your stay in Malabo.\n\nHousing\n\nHousing options vary widely, with a room in a shared house costing around $300 to $500 per month, a one-bedroom apartment renting for $600 to $1,000 per month, a two-bedroom apartment ranging from $800 to $1,500, and a three-bedroom house or larger costing $1,500 or more. Prices depend on location and amenities.\n\nGroceries\n\nGroceries in Malabo can be quite expensive, particularly for imported goods. Local produce is more affordable, with a week's worth of groceries for a single person costing around $40 to $60.\n\nTransportation\n\nPublic transportation options include buses and shared taxis called 'colectivos'. A one-way bus ticket costs approximately $0.30 to $0.50. Hiring a private taxi might cost around $1 to $3 per ride depending on the distance. Owning a car is more expensive due to high fuel prices and maintenance costs.\n\nMalabo has a tropical rainforest climate with consistent warmth and high humidity throughout the year. The city experiences two rainy seasons (February to May and August to October) and two dry seasons (November to January and June to July). The average annual temperature is around 25°C (77°F).\n\nKey industries in Malabo include petroleum, timber, and cocoa production. Opportunities for expats are mainly found in the oil sector, although teaching and hospitality jobs are also available. The unemployment rate is relatively high, and it can be challenging for expats to find work without prior experience or connections in the city.\n\nHealthcare in Malabo is limited, with only a few private hospitals and clinics available. Facilities may have limited resources and staff, leading to variable quality care. Malabo has a local hospital, Hospital General de Malabo, as well as private clinics like La Paz Clinic and Clinica CEIBA. It is recommended to have international health insurance for comprehensive coverage.\n\nMalabo's public transportation system includes buses and shared taxis (colectivos). Buses run regular routes throughout the city, while colectivos operate on fixed routes for a set fare. RTCG, the government-owned transport company, manages the bus system. Private taxis are also readily available but are more expensive than public transportation options.\n\nCrime rates in Malabo are moderate, with petty crimes like pickpocketing and theft being the most common offenses. Exercise caution in crowded areas, particularly around the downtown market and along the waterfront promenade. Violent crimes are relatively rare, but it is essential to be aware of your surroundings and remain vigilant."
