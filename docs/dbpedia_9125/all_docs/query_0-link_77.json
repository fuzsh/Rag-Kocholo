        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nEquatorial Guinea gained independence in 1968 after 190 years of Spanish rule; it is one of the smallest countries in Africa consisting of a mainland territory and five inhabited islands. The capital of Malabo is located on the island of Bioko, approximately 25 km from the Cameroonian coastline in the Gulf of Guinea. Between 1968 and 1979, autocratic President Francisco MACIAS NGUEMA virtually destroyed all of the country's political, economic, and social institutions before being deposed by his nephew Teodoro OBIANG NGUEMA MBASOGO in a coup. President OBIANG has ruled since October 1979. He has been elected several times since 1996, and was most recently reelected in 2016. Although nominally a constitutional democracy since 1991, presidential and legislative elections since 1996 have generally been labeled as flawed. The president exerts almost total control over the political system and has placed legal and bureaucratic barriers that hinder political opposition. Equatorial Guinea has experienced rapid economic growth due to the discovery of large offshore oil reserves, and in the last decade had become Sub-Saharan Africa's third largest oil exporter, though in 2018 it slipped to 5th place. Despite the country's economic windfall from oil production, resulting in a massive increase in government revenue in recent years, the drop in global oil prices has placed significant strain on the state budget. The country has been in recession since 2014. Oil revenues have mainly been used for the development of infrastructure and there have been limited improvements in the population's living standards. Equatorial Guinea continues to seek to diversify its economy and to increase foreign investment. The country hosts major regional and international conferences and continues to seek a greater role in international affairs, and leadership in the sub-region.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nCentral Africa, bordering the Bight of Biafra, between Cameroon and Gabon\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n2 00 N, 10 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 28,051 sq km\n\nland: 28,051 sq km\n\nwater: 0 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 146\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly smaller than Maryland\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 528 km\n\nborder countries (2): Cameroon 183 km, Gabon 345 km\n\nCoastline\n\n296 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12nm\n\nexclusive economic zone: 200nm\n\nClimate\n\ntropical; always hot, humid\n\nTerrain\n\ncoastal plains rise to interior hills; islands are volcanic\n\nElevation\n\nmean elevation: 577 m\n\nlowest point: Atlantic Ocean 0 m\n\nhighest point: Pico Basile 3,008 m\n\nNatural resources\n\npetroleum, natural gas, timber, gold, bauxite, diamonds, tantalum, sand and gravel, clay\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 10.1% (2011 est.)\n\narable land: 4.3% (2011 est.)/permanent crops: 2.1% (2011 est.)/permanent pasture: 3.7% (2011 est.)\n\nforest: 57.5% (2011 est.)\n\nother: 32.4% (2011 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\nNA\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nonly two large cities over 30,000 people (Bata on the mainland, and the capital Malabo on the island of Bioko); small communities are scattered throughout the mainland and the five inhabited islands\n\nNatural hazards\n\nviolent windstorms; flash floods volcanism: Santa Isabel (3,007 m), which last erupted in 1923, is the country's only historically active volcano; Santa Isabel, along with two dormant volcanoes, form Bioko Island in the Gulf of Guinea\n\nEnvironment - current issues\n\ndeforestation (forests are threatened by agricultural expansion, fires, and grazing); desertification; water pollution (tap water is non-potable); wildlife preservation\n\nEnvironment - international agreements\n\nparty to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands\n\nsigned, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements\n\nGeography - note\n\ninsular and continental regions widely separated; despite its name, no part of the Equator passes through Equatorial Guinea; the mainland part of the country is located just north of the Equator\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n797,457 (July 2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 164\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Equatorial Guinean(s) or Equatoguinean(s)\n\nadjective: Equatorial Guinean or Equatoguinean\n\nEthnic groups\n\nFang 85.7%, Bubi 6.5%, Mdowe 3.6%, Annobon 1.6%, Bujeba 1.1%, other 1.4% (1994 census)\n\nLanguages\n\nSpanish (official) 67.6%, other (includes Fang, Bubi, Portuguese (official), French (official)) 32.4% (1994 census)\n\nReligions\n\nnominally Christian and predominantly Roman Catholic, Muslim, Baha'i, animist, indigenous\n\nDemographic profile\n\nEquatorial Guinea is one of the smallest and least populated countries in continental Africa and is the only independent African country where Spanish is an official language. Despite a boom in oil production in the 1990s, authoritarianism, corruption, and resource mismanagement have concentrated the benefits among a small elite. These practices have perpetuated income inequality and unbalanced development, such as low public spending on education and health care. Unemployment remains problematic because the oil-dominated economy employs a small labor force dependent on skilled foreign workers. The agricultural sector, Equatorial Guinea’s main employer, continues to deteriorate because of a lack of investment and the migration of rural workers to urban areas. About three-quarters of the population lives below the poverty line.Equatorial Guinea’s large and growing youth population – about 60% are under the age of 25 – is particularly affected because job creation in the non-oil sectors is limited, and young people often do not have the skills needed in the labor market. Equatorial Guinean children frequently enter school late, have poor attendance, and have high dropout rates. Thousands of Equatorial Guineans fled across the border to Gabon in the 1970s to escape the dictatorship of MACIAS NGUEMA; smaller numbers have followed in the decades since. Continued inequitable economic growth and high youth unemployment increases the likelihood of ethnic and regional violence.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 39.46%(male 159,814 /female 154,860)\n\n15-24 years: 19.8%(male 80,368 /female 77,515)\n\n25-54 years: 32.34%(male 129,248 /female 128,664)\n\n55-64 years: 4.46%(male 15,428 /female 20,176)\n\n65 years and over: 3.94%(male 13,000 /female 18,384) (2018 est.)\n\npopulation pyramid:\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 67.5 (2015 est.)\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 62.7 (2015 est.)\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 4.8 (2015 est.)\n\npotential support ratio: 20.6 (2015 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 19.9 years (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 19.5 years\n\nfemale: 20.4 years\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 193\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n2.41% (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 26\n\nBirth rate\n\n31.7 births/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 31\n\nDeath rate\n\n7.6 deaths/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 102\n\nNet migration rate\n\n0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 83\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nonly two large cities over 30,000 people (Bata on the mainland, and the capital Malabo on the island of Bioko);

Forestry and farming are minor components of GDP. Although preindependence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings, the neglect of the rural economy since independence has diminished the potential for agriculture-led growth. Subsistence farming is the dominant form of livelihood. Declining revenue from hydrocarbon production, high levels of infrastructure expenditures, lack of economic diversification, and corruption have pushed the economy into decline in recent years and limited improvements in the general population’s living conditions. Equatorial Guinea’s real GDP growth has been weak in recent years, averaging -0.5% per year from 2010 to 2014, because of a declining hydrocarbon sector. Inflation remained very low in 2016, down from an average of 4% in 2014.As a middle income country, Equatorial Guinea is now ineligible for most low-income World Bank and the IMF funding. The government has been widely criticized for its lack of transparency and misuse of oil revenues and has attempted to address this issue by working toward compliance with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. US foreign assistance to Equatorial Guinea is limited in part because of US restrictions pursuant to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.Equatorial Guinea hosted two economic diversification symposia in 2014 that focused on attracting investment in five sectors: agriculture and animal ranching, fishing, mining and petrochemicals, tourism, and financial services. Undeveloped mineral resources include gold, zinc, diamonds, columbite-tantalite, and other base metals. In 2017 Equatorial Guinea signed a preliminary agreement with Ghana to sell liquefied natural gas (LNG); as oil production wanes, the government believes LNG could provide a boost to revenues, but it will require large investments and long lead times to develop.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$31.52 billion (2017 est.)\n\n$32.57 billion (2016 est.)\n\n$35.62 billion (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 130\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$12.49 billion (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate\n\n-3.2% (2017 est.)\n\n-8.6% (2016 est.)\n\n-9.1% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 213\n\nGDP - per capita (PPP)\n\n$37,400 (2017 est.)\n\n$39,700 (2016 est.)\n\n$44,600 (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 52\n\nGross national saving\n\n6.1% of GDP (2017 est.)\n\n3.6% of GDP (2016 est.)\n\n8.5% of GDP (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 173\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: 50% (2017 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: 21.8% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 10.2% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: 0.1% (2017 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 56.9% (2017 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -39% (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 2.5% (2017 est.)\n\nindustry: 54.6% (2017 est.)\n\nservices: 42.9% (2017 est.)\n\nAgriculture - products\n\ncoffee, cocoa, rice, yams, cassava (manioc, tapioca), bananas, palm oil nuts;

UN urged Equatorial Guinea and Gabon to resolve the sovereignty dispute over Gabon-occupied Mbane and lesser islands and to create a maritime boundary in the hydrocarbon-rich Corisco Bay\n\nTrafficking in persons\n\ncurrent situation: Equatorial Guinea is a source country for children subjected to sex trafficking and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor; Equatorial Guinean girls may be encouraged by their parents to engage in the sex trade in urban centers to receive groceries, gifts, housing, and money; children are also trafficked from nearby countries for work as domestic servants, market laborers, ambulant vendors, and launderers; women are trafficked to Equatorial Guinea from Cameroon, Benin, other neighboring countries, and China for forced labor or prostitution\n\ntier rating: Tier 3 – Equatorial Guinea does not fully comply with the minimum standards on the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so; in 2014, the government made no efforts to investigate or prosecute any suspected trafficking offenders or to identify or protect victims, despite its 2004 law prohibiting all forms of trafficking and mandating the provision of services to victims; undocumented migrants continued to be deported without being screened to assess whether any were trafficking victims; authorities did not undertake any trafficking awareness campaigns, implement any programs to address forced child labor, or make any other efforts to prevent trafficking (2015)\n\nFlag of Equatorial Guinea\n\nFlag of Equatorial Guinea\n\nFlag of Equatorial Guinea"
