        "text": "Equatorial Guinea (EG), a country located on the west coast of Central Africa, obtained its independence from Spain in 1968. It is composed of a mainland portion plus five islands. The country is divided into eight provinces, and its capital city is Malabo. Equatorial Guinea has a republican form of government, and the official languages are Spanish, Portuguese, and French. Equatorial Guinea's currency is the Coopération Financière en Afrique centrale (Central African CFA) franc (XAF).\n\nEquatorial Guinea has experienced rapid economic growth due to the discovery of large offshore oil and gas reserves. In the last decade, Equatorial Guinea has become Sub-Saharan Africa's third largest oil and gas producer and exporter. Public works, banking, forestry, and fishing are also major components of its gross domestic product (GDP). Undeveloped natural resources include titanium, iron ore, manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold.\n\nPwC Equatorial Guinea has been assisting major oil and gas, construction, and telecommunication companies, as well as major banks, working in Equatorial Guinea on a whole range of issues related to tax law, company law, contract law, trade law, labour law, customs law, environment law, and hydrocarbons law for more than 20 years."
