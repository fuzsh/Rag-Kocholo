        "text": "Improved experience in changing the source of a linked chart: In a situation where a presentation contains a linked chart, which is not only stored at a SharePoint location, but also synced to a local folder, when the user tries to change the chart source via \"File -> Info -> Edit Links to File -> Change Source...\", the initial location in the Change Source dialog now shows the current location of the linked chart, instead of the last used location. PowerPoint can now convert the local sync folder location to its corresponding SharePoint URL and preserve it in the file if the user chooses a chart in a local sync folder as the new chart source.\n\nResolved an issue where attempting to reference a file using Draft with Copilot would give the error \"Copilot wasn't able to apply the right sensitivity label to this file because it couldn't work with the content you referenced.\"\n\nWe fixed an issue that caused some users to see no search results in Org Explorer.\n\nWe fixed an issue that caused Outlook to take longer to boot than expected.\n\nWe fixed an issue that caused users with on premise mailboxes to see no web add-ins in Outlook.\n\nWe fixed an issue that caused Outlook to exit unexpectedly when attempting to undo a change in a draft after switching from an account that has automatic signatures to an account that does not have a signature configured.\n\nWe fixed an issue with user and shared mailboxes where a message sent from a user with saved to Sent Items folder enabled and where DelegateSentItemsStyle is set to 1 is saved in the shared mailbox Sent Items folder.\n\nWe fixed an issue in projects saved to SharePoint document libraries where, on Save, a user's changes remained in their local cache after the file check in was complete. If the file was then immediately checked out, updated, and checked back in by a different user, the first user experienced possible data loss.\n\nWe fixed an issue where a file failed to upload with the following error when co-authoring: \"We ran into a problem with this file and can't save any new changes. Please save a copy to avoid losing your work.\"\n\nWe fixed an issue where a Meeting window wouldn't close and the meeting wouldn't get added to the organizer's calendar if an image had previously been added into the body of the message and the organizer was attempting to reopen the meeting and add new attendees.\n\nSensitivity toolbar is now available when creating a copy of a document: The sensitivity bar is now available in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint when users are creating copies of their documents in File / Save As.

We've now added autocomplete functionality, which automatically compares the text typed in a cell to all items in the dropdown list and displays only the items that match. You spend less time scrolling through lists, dealing with data validation errors, or writing complex code to handle this task. See details in blog post\n\nPerformance improvement related to fonts: If you do not use printer fonts or have not heard of printer fonts, unchecking the setting in File/Options/Advanced/[Include fonts that are stored on the printer] can help speed up font related operations such as choosing a font from font drop down, or formatting a cell by bolding/italicizing a cell's font, etc.\n\nWe fixed an issue where default sensitivity labels weren't displayed until after a save event.

It achieves this by optimizing global automatic recalculation to the workbook being worked in, and its interdependent workbooks also open at the same time. See details in blog post\n\nUser-defined permissions now support domain name restrictions: When you choose a sensitivity label configured for user-defined permissions, domain names can now be used toâ¯restrict file access to all individuals from that domain. For example, you can specify \"someone@example.com\" or \"@example.com,\" and permissions are restricted based on either the individual or all individuals within the example domain.\n\nPivot Tables connected to Power BI datasets now have proper date support.

For example, filtering data on specific timeframes is now possible.See details in blog post\n\nInsert in-cell images with the new IMAGE function: Your images can now be part of the worksheet, instead of floating on top. You can move and resize cells, sort and filter, and work with images within an Excel table.

Try using TEXTSPLIT to split your text or VSTACK to combine multiple arrays. See details in blog post\n\nWhen a table with an Attachment or multi-valued field is selected, launching the Report, Label, or Query Wizard could cause Access to become unresponsive. This update fixes the issue so that these wizards work correctly again with all tables.\n\nWe fixed an issue where the message \"This project contains links to one or more data sources that may be unsafe and have been disabled. Would you like to enable these data sources? Only do this if you trust the source of the file.\" may appear when opening a project. The message appears even when the project doesn't have any active paste-links. Additionally, no active embedded objects are found in Gantt type views.\n\nWe fixed an issue for when assignment timephased actual cost values were viewed and reported on. The sum of these values may not have been equal to the scalar value (the value you see in a sheet view). As the timescale granularity went from very detailed such as daily to less detailed such as yearly, the differences between the summed and scalar values could be significant.\n\nWe fixed an issue where Outlook couldn't open a message that was sent using Outlook on the web and contained a comment that was copied from Word.\n\nUse suggested replies in Outlook: When you receive an email message that can be answered by a short response, Outlook can suggest three responses you can use to reply with just a couple of clicks. Learn more See details in blog post\n\nTurn off Suggested Replies: Outlook makes it easy to reply faster to emails by offering short suggested replies for messages that can be answered with just a few words.
