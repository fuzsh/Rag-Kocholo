        "text": "The Sabaton History Channel has released Episode 044 - \"The Last Stand\" - The 1527 Sack Of Rome.\n\nA message states: \"In 1527, a large Holy Roman army consisting of Germans, Spaniards and Italians march on Rome frustrated over unpaid wages and lacking supplies. Pope Clement VII seeks shelter as Rome is pillaged and burned while his brave Swiss Guard makes a heroic last stand.\"\n\nSabaton presents another musical collaboration with the Finnish cello rock band Apocalyptica, after the success with \"Fields Of Verdun\". With the \"Angels Calling\" single release, Sabaton also give their fans a good taste of what to expect on the European tour.\n\nAnyone who will attend the upcoming concerts will experience a truly unique live show since Sabaton will be reinforced by Apocalyptica on stage for several newly arranged songs, including this one.\n\n\"'Angels Calling' was the first song we wrote on the topic of World War 1 for the Attero Dominatus album back in 2006, and together with Apocalyptica we have really given the song a new life. Due to the song's topic, our recent album, the upcoming tour and a great demand from fans, the song is now back on the setlist for the tour.\n\n\"The song's arrangement was made in August, when Apocalyptica visited our hometown Falun to perform at the Sabaton Open Air festival. It was recorded in Black Lounge studios by Jonas Kjellgren and the Apocalyptica parts were later recorded in Finland.\n\n\"Richard Erixon, our long time video producer, captured the best moments from the rehearsals in Falun and edited it into a music video for the song.\n\n\"We wanted this tour to offer something that we have never done before, and when I attended an Apocalyptica show in Madrid a few years ago I already had a strong vision to perform together, so I explained the idea to Apocalyptica and here we are, with the best show we have ever done”, says Pär Sundström\n\n\"Angels Calling\" is exclusively released on YouTube and will be available on all major platforms on January 17.
