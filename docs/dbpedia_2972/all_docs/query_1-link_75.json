        "text": "Former Autograph lead vocalist Steve Plunkett was recently interviewed by Andrew Daly for Classic Rock History. Plunkett was promoting his second solo album Straight Up, which was released via Cleopatra Records on July 26, 2024.\n\nPlunkett was part of the original Autograph line-up along with guitarist Steve Lynch, bassist Randy Rand, drummer Keni Richards and keyboardist Steven Isham that released the albums Sign In Please (1984), That’s The Stuff (1985) and Loud And Clear (1987). The singer went on to release the album Buzz under the Autograph name with other band members but did not take part in the reunited line-up in 2013 that featured Lynch and Rand.\n\nOn what led to Autograph‘s decline after their third album Loud And Clear and eventually the break up of the band in 1989, Plunkett opined: “Music was changing at radio. Grunge was coming in and that wasn’t us. Rock radio stations were changing to keep listeners. We had parted ways with both RCA and our manager, and our sound just wasn’t the flavor of the month anymore. We could all read the writing on the wall and decided it was time to shake hands and walk away. We had a good run.”\n\nIn terms of why he wasn’t interested in reuniting with the band in 2013, Plunkett indicated: “The guys wanted to hit the road again. They called me but I wasn’t interested. I was very busy writing and producing and didn’t have the time or desire to go back out on the road. I can’t write on the road. I was in a different headspace, and it wasn’t right for me. So, I gave them my blessing and said go have some fun!”\n\nYou can read the rest of the interview with Steve Plunkett via Classic Rock History‘s website.\n\nAutograph‘s “Loud And Clear” video:"
