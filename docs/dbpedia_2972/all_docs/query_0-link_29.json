        "text": "Stand Up And B Strong, a cover of the Soul Asylum song Stand Up And Be Strong, written by the band’s frontman Dave Pirner (from their The Silver Lining album from 2006) is the sixth track of the tenth posthumous album Welcome 2 America, the first full previously-unreleased studio album of Prince material.\n\nIn a 2021 interview, archivist Michael Howe stated that Prince initially recorded a version of this track in 2007 with Michael Bland (drummer on the Soul Asylum original) and Sonny T. The version included on Welcome 2 America is a re-recording from March 2010 with a different band line-up. A tape photographed in Prince’s vault at Paisley Park Studios, Chanhassen, Minnesota, lists the song as 19 March 2010 (together with Black Muse instr.), alluding the exact date for the recording. The track was mentioned in Prince’s interview in the July 2010 issue of Ebony Magazine, and a live version was played for Ebony magazine staff members during the interview process."
