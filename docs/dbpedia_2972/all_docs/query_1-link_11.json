        "text": "JARAMILLO said:\n\n50 cent recorded a new diss track to Game in late January where he talks about Game’s DVD. The track is titled \"Not Rich, Still Lying\". In the song, 50 mimics Game throughout the entire track, but perhaps the biggest news was 50 revealing his new album.\n\nAround 2 minutes and 10 seconds into the track, 50 says : \"Yeah ! It’s 50 ! New album...July 18th...because I can’t stay away !\" over DJ Kay Slay speaking. 50 said he was trying to keep it on the low, but he knew someone would leak it.\n\n50 cent promises less tracks with more quality. This time, he only has to beat 4.9 million. (which The Massacre sold) According to 50 cent, the album is over 50% done, and hopefully the album will make it out by July 18th, but if not, he promises a 2006 release.\n\n\"Look for Mase, Mobb Deep, hopefully Dr Dre, of course Eminem, and the rest of the family on this album.\" The album has also been given a name, but 50 said the following, \"The album is named, but y’all gotta figure it out. All I’m saying is, I’ve already told it to you. 50 Cent is back. Tell that ***** Game to run for cover.\"\n\nThe rapper revealed Monday he was planning to release another album July 18 until higher powers stepped in.\n\n\"Em didn't agree with me,\" 50 said of his Shady\n\n\"A lot of the music that comes out of the South is kind of simplified and I think it's kinda 'cause they just wanna have a good time.\" — 50 Cent\n\n\"My motivation wasn't really right. I get a little frustrated from time to time and I got so much material that I make that isn't being heard that I was like, 'Yo, I just wanna release an album again.' And he was like, 'Nah, you gotta wait.' I don't care about none of that [timing], I just want the record to go out, but it just makes better sense to take our time and re-create the new album.\"\n\n50's got an album's worth of material in the can but expects none of it will make his next record when it's finally released.\n\n\"By the time the summer passes, the music that I planned to release will be dated to me and I'll have so many new ideas that I wanna write something else,\" he explained. \"I don't ever receive the credit I'm supposed to receive for my music. I receive all the checks I'm supposed to receive, I just don't receive all the trophies. But I'm cool with it. I just look at it like I should continue to dominate with it more. I'll get lifetime-achievement awards opposed to best-new-artist awards, so it's cool.\"\n\nIf it were up to 50, he'd also be awarded as a label boss, as running G-Unit takes a massive amount of his time.\n\n\"I've sacrificed a lot for my actual camp,\" he explained. \"I'll have an album and do three videos ... and the album will be over. Even though I put together 21 cuts [for 2005's The Massacre], which is a double album, and there's easily another three records on there that I could be shooting visuals for, I stopped shooting in order to move to the next project, to make sure that everybody around me is in a great space creatively and financially. So for me it's a definite sacrifice.\"\n\nIf he were selfish, 50 added, he would have made videos for \"Build You Up\" with Jamie Foxx, \"God Gave Me Style\" and \"Get in My Car.\"\n\n\"There's so many records that were there that had full potential to go to radio and be a single,\" he said. \"When I go out to perform them I feel the energy, so I know people enjoyed it as much as I anticipated them enjoying it.\"\n\nThat's not to say, though, that 50's not enjoying his role as a mogul, especially being able to sign some of his favorite artists, like Mobb Deep (see \"50 Cent Wants To Sign Mobb Deep, M.O.P. To G-Unit Records\").\n\n\"Their project is incredible for me,\" he said. \"It was an opportunity to work with a group that I was a fan of for a long period of time and now it's exciting. I had influences on some of their musical choices overall and I think the project is a classic.\"\n\nMobb's album Blood Money is scheduled for an April 11 release (see \"Mobb Deep, 50 Cent Get Tattoos To Prove Their Loyalty\"), although 50 anticipates it being pushed back a few weeks in order to clear all the samples.\n\nLloyd Banks' next album will follow shortly after, and Young Buck has also finished his next release.\n\n50 says he feels hip-hop needs the new G-Unit releases, as the genre seems to be stuck in a creative rut.\n\n\"A lot of the music that comes out of the South is kind of simplified and I think it's kinda 'cause they just wanna have a good time,\" he explained. \"They don't wanna think about what [they] just said. ... They really didn't make sense, but they made sense in a way and they just wanna hear something while they're actually partying and it works for them. But when they don't take the time to make it the highest quality possible, it hurts the actual hip-hop [genre]. People wanna make music they can get away with as opposed to the best possible music they can make.\n\n\"They'll lower the grade of music,\" he continued. \"It changes the range you can go and then it causes confusion amongst artists that don't have their own direction at that point and they all start making music that is similar. Like if the record comes out and it's a hit and it's the simplest thing on the planet, all of a sudden the new artists start writing records that are similar to that hit. Their motivation is to have a project that's successful and that will allow them to move out of the financial situations that they're in when you're in the 'hood or in the ghetto. They make it sound like the record that they hear playin' on the radio as opposed to just creating their own lane.\""
