        "text": "Shortly after the 2022 midterms, the political map seemed set: President Biden would be the Democratic nominee in 2024, with Vice President Kamala Harris by his side.\n\nBut up in Minnesota, Gov. Tim Walz had just led his party to sweeping victories and wondered about the possibility of a different future — one where his Midwestern brand might be needed for a national role, perhaps even on a presidential ticket.\n\nSo the plain-spoken Mr. Walz and his aides crafted a strategy to inject him into the national political conversation, according to a person involved in the discussions who insisted on anonymity to reveal Mr. Walz’s thinking. They would build his profile, one state party dinner and cable news appearance at a time. And few Democratic politicians, officials or members of the party faithful would see them coming because they would do it in a way that was, above all, Minnesota Nice.\n\nTheir plan exploded into the public consciousness over a turbulent two weeks. Mr. Walz transformed from a little-known governor of a blue state to one of his party’s most prominent and powerful messengers. His approach, combined with a heavy dose of luck, helped him win the coveted vice-presidential nomination over rising stars from battleground states and liberal favorites.\n\nMr. Walz achieved what his team had worked for 18 months to accomplish: He went viral. As his standing rose, he remained unfailingly loyal, humble and optimistic about the future in his interviews behind closed doors with Ms. Harris and her team.\n\nBut underneath that veneer of Midwestern politeness, Mr. Walz had angled to improve his political prospects. In early 2023, his political staff began a concerted effort to hone his message and shine a light on his accomplishments. Aides pitched him relentlessly to podcasters, reporters, donors and activists. That summer, his team branded his progressive legislation “the Minnesota Miracle.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
