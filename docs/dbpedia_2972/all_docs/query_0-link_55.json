        "text": "SAMMY HAGAR PUT ON ONE HECK OF A PARTY ON A HOT SUMMER NIGHT!\n\nDate: July 31, 2024\n\nVenue: Budweiser Stage\n\nLocation: Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nReviewer: Olivier\n\nPhotos: Olivier\n\nIt had been more than 20 years since I had seen a concert from the lawn section at the Budweiser Stage (previously called the Molson Amphitheatre) but when I saw the price of the tickets to see Sammy Hagar crank out some Van Halen tunes with his all-star cast of bassist Michael Anthony (Van Halen, Sammy Hagar & The Circle, Chickenfoot), guitarist Joe Satriani (Chickenfoot) and drummer Jason Bonham (Sammy Hagar & The Circle, Black Country Communion, ex-Led Zeppelin, ex-Foreigner), I decided that it would make more economic sense to watch the concert from that dreaded lawn section. My rule of thumb is that if I can buy a band or an artist’s entire discography for the price of one concert ticket, well that means that concert ticket is way too high priced. To be fair, I can’t remember how much the concert tickets were for the various sections (floor, 200’s, 300’s, 400’s and lawn) to see Sammy Hagar but I do recall thinking that only the lawn section prices were reasonable this time around. Funny enough, the first (and previous last) time that I saw a concert from the lawn section at the Molson Amphitheatre dates all the way back to 2003 when Iron Maiden were doing a “retro” live set with only songs from their first four studio albums.\n\nAlthough I was not really looking forward to seeing the concert from the lawn section (which is the furthest section from the stage if you haven’t guessed that by now), my buddy Pierre was excited simply because it was his first time at the Budweiser Stage! In any case, we made our way to the concert via the GO Train — you’ll know what that is if you live in the greater Toronto area — since it’s pretty challenging finding any parking near the Budweiser Stage and they have only made things more difficult in the 20+ years that I have been attending concerts there. We arrived at the concert venue with about 25 minutes to spare and the place was already quite packed. By the time we made it to the lawn sections, it seemed that it would actually be challenging to find a spot to stand. I have to say that I had never seen the Budweiser Stage so packed before the opening act even played a single note. One thing that was different from my last foray in the lawn section more than 20 years ago was that people could apparently rent lawn chairs to use in that section. In hindsight, it would have been a good investment because my legs were so stiff and tired after standing for more than four hours on the slightly slanted hill that makes up the lawn section.\n\nLoverboy\n\nI remember when Loverboy were announced as one of the main acts for the M3 Rock Festival back in 2017. That was one of the reasons that I didn’t end up going! While I understand that some people just attend the M3 Rock Festival for the experience alone without thinking too much about the line-up, I can say that line-ups definitely matter for me. Accordingly, when I found out that Loverboy were opening for Sammy Hagar at the Budweiser Stage, I was ambivalent at best. It’s not that I don’t like Loverboy because I always loved their track “Lovin’ Every Minute of It” but I always found them on the light end of the rock n’ roll that I would listen to. I was familiar with their hit single “Working For The Weekend” but as I would found out after their opening set, I knew a couple of their other songs quite well too.\n\nFor those not familiar with Loverboy, they originate from Canada and were founded way back in 1979. When the band members made their way onto the stage at the Budweiser Stage, it seemed to me that it was the original band line-up and I was pretty close given that four of the five original members — lead vocalist Mike Reno, guitarist Paul Dean, drummer Mark Frenette and keyboardist Doug Johnson — were presumably present on stage. Only bassist Ken “Spider” Sinnaeve was not an original member but he has been around for more than two decades so can hardly be considered a “new” member. In any case, Reno reminded me a lot appearance wise of the Vince Neil that we have seen in the last 20 years or so. At first, I thought that Reno was lip-syncing given that he was constantly moving his mike up and down (which was perched on his mic stand) while singing but what I was hearing from him was not impacted in any way. Keep in mind that I was very far from the stage so my view wasn’t the best. In any case, my concerns subsided as Loverboy‘s set progressed.\n\nAs it turned out, I was very familiar with five of the eight songs that Loverboy played on this night and there were a couple of tracks (“The Kid Is Hot Tonite” and “Turn Me Loose”) that I have heard what feels like a million times on Canadian classic rock radio stations. I simply didn’t know those two songs belonged to Loverboy but now that I know that, it makes more sense that they landed the opening slot on Hagar‘s latest tour and that they were given such a top billing at the M3 Rock Festival in 2017. Loverboy were not “one hit wonders” like I previously thought they were on the strength of their hit single “Working For The Weekend”. While I wasn’t particularly impressed with Reno‘s stage movements — or lack thereof — I was impressed with keyboardist Doug Johnson who played a mean harmonica! The rest of the band was pretty stationery in their movements but as I am finding out, they are all getting up there in age with Reno being 69 years old and guitarist Paul Dean almost 80 years of age at 78.\n\nGiven that Loverboy‘s entire set took place while it was still daylight and they didn’t have the benefit of any lights, their stage set up ended looking pretty plain with a bunch of amps and a huge banner with their logo behind them. In any case, I was pleased to see such a legendary band play live and especially since I knew quite a bit of their material really well (but unbeknownst to me). Clearly and with little time on stage, Loverboy played a retro set with two songs from their self-titled debut album (1980), two from Get Lucky (1981), two from Keep It Up (1983), one from Lovin’ Every Minute of It (1985) and one from Wildside (1987) but no tracks from their subsequent studio records (of mainly original material) Six (1997), Just Getting Started (2007) and Unfinished Business (2014). That was definitely a good thing for me since I doubt that I would have known any of their material from the last two decades. Overall, Loverboy did a good job of warming up the crowd for Sammy Hagar and company, and the crowd seemed really into them.\n\nLoverboy’s setlist:\n\n01. Notorious\n\n02. Lucky Ones\n\n03. Queen of The Broken Hearts\n\n04. The Kid Is Hot Tonite\n\n05. Lovin’ Every Minute of It\n\n06. Hot Girls In Love\n\n07. Turn Me Loose\n\n08. Working For The Weekend\n\nLoverboy performing “Working For The Weekend” live at the Budweiser Stage in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on July 31, 2024 (video from David Huras‘ YouTube page):\n\nSammy Hagar\n\nLoverboy‘s set ended around 7:45 pm and I was impressed to see that Sammy Hagar‘s set was starting about 35 minutes later (at 8:21 pm by my watch). The audience was treated to a video montage showing highlights from Hagar‘s career. While Hagar, Anthony, Satriani and Bonham were paying tribute to Van Halen with their tour this time around, it was clear who was the star of the show from the video montage and to be fair, deservedly so. Sammy Hagar and company opened with “Good Enough” and it felt like it was “game on” and it was going to be a big party. It seemed the energy level went up ten fold on stage and that translated to the crowd as well.\n\nHagar had promised that his The Best of All Worlds would be heavy on Van Halen tunes (mainly from his era of the band) and he didn’t disappoint with 15 out of 22/23 (depending if you count the songs from the medley as individual tracks) songs being Van Halen ones. There were some “deep” Van Halen cuts that were played as well with “Judgement Day” (from 1991’s For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge) and “The Seventh Seal” (from 1995’s Balance). I don’t think that I had heard that latter song in more than two decades. My friend Pierre who was not familiar with the song guessed the track’s title from the black and white movie scenes that were being played in the background while the band tore through that song. Although it was fun to hear Sammy and the boys play so many Van Halen tracks, they did play five songs from one of my least favourite Van Halen album For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge. Aside from the easy to sing along “Top of The World” and the sublime “Right Now”, I have just never found the songs on that album to be up to par with the ones on the first two Sammy era Van Halen records 5150 (1986) and OU812 (1988). It was therefore a real pity that only one song was played from OU812.\n\nWhile Ou812 just didn’t get enough love, I was happy that 5150 did with five songs played from that record. I loved all of the songs played from that record and found myself singing and bopping along to all the lyrics for all five tracks that were played but especially for “Best of Both Worlds’ and “Summer Nights”. The latter seemed very appropriate and a propos with the hot summer night (and extremely sweaty one) that everyone was partaking in. Even though Pierre and I were very far away from the stage, it felt like the party atmosphere was everywhere on this night as Sammy and the boys kept cranking one great song after another (aside from the few that I previously mentioned). I had never thought this before as I felt that Van Halen had always switched their sound quite a bit from album to album but it felt like there was a bit of a formula to how many of the Hagar era Van Halen songs were written after listening to tracks like “5150”, “Summer Nights”, “Runaround”, “Judgment Day” and “The Seventh Seal”.\n\nSammy Hagar performing “Good Enough” live at the Budweiser Stage in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on July 31, 2024 (video from David Huras‘ YouTube page):\n\nWhat was quite noticeable on this night was what stellar musicians that Hagar, Anthony, Bonham and particularly Satriani really are. Anthony and Bonham are such a solid rhythm section and you can really hear Bonham‘s drumming throughout all the songs. He must hit those drums really hard (lol)! Bonham also provided a funny story in conjunction with Hagar as there former noted that he hadn’t had an alcoholic drink in about 24 years and his last one was at Cabo Wabo (Hagar‘s legendary ands mystical party place) during a binger that seemed to have lasted many days and where he never slept. Bonham noted that he was told that he had had a great time and then it was straight to rehab for him after that! It was touching to hear Bonham express how he had seen Van Halen play live when he was just 17 years old and he would have never dreamed that he would be playing 40 years later with Anthony and David Lee Roth‘s “replacement”.\n\nThankfully, Roth was not out there singing since he lost his voice many decades ago and it was his “replacement” — the 76 year old Sammy Hagar — handling the lead vocal duties and taking on the party maestro duties. I think everyone would have to admit that Hagar has an impressive voice at this stage of his life! It really doesn’t sound like Father Time has caught up to him yet although I have heard that there is at least one song that he avoids playing live now (“Dreams”). In any case, he sounded great and did justice to all of the songs that he sung. It was funny when he strapped on a guitar for “There’s Only One Way To Rock” as he threw a compliment to Satriani by saying he was just going to make the latter look good or something like that.\n\nSpeaking of Satriani, he had the hardest job of all since he had to step into the shoes of the now deceased Eddie Van Halen for this night. Feeling seemingly no pressure whatsoever, Satriani played amazingly well and really captured that “brown” guitar sound that was Eddie‘s trademark. The sound was also crystal clean all the way up to the lawn section which was rather impressive so you could really appreciate all the notes played by Satriani. It was also a real treat hearing Satriani play “Satch Boogie” along with Anthony and Bonham, and a smart thing to do rather than for him to try to do an extended guitar solo playing Eddie Van Halen‘s signature stuff like “Eruption” or “Spanish Fly”. Satriani did a splendid job on guitar and definitely showed how talented he is nailing the Eddie Van Halen sounds, riffs and solos. There was one more member on the Sammy Hagar team this time around. Although Hagar introduced the keyboardist to the crowd, I didn’t catch his name but know that he was all the way from Australia! It was funny seeing him jump in enthusiastically behind Hagar and Anthony as the duo were doing their trademark walk together during the track “Best of Both Worlds”.\n\nSammy Hagar performing “Summer Nights” live at the Budweiser Stage in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on July 31, 2024 (video from David Huras‘ YouTube page):\n\nIt felt sometimes like Sammy Hagar was doing a “favour” to the crowd by playing certain David Lee Roth era Van Halen songs such as “Panama” and “Jump”. In fact, when they were about to play “Jump”, Hagar repeatedly told the audience that this was one for them. The only other Roth era Van Halen track that was played was “Ain’t Talkin’ ’bout Love” which had Anthony handling the lead vocals. Anthony was contributing quite a bit of background vocals and seemingly handling some of the Hagar vocal parts at times. It worked out well and made me almost wonder why Van Halen just didn’t turn the lead vocal duties to Anthony rather than embarking on that ill-fated run with Gary Cherone on lead vocals back in the late ’90s.\n\nOverall, it was a great show on a hot summer night! And when I mean “hot summer night”, I mean an extremely humid hot summer night! Hagar, Anthony, Satriani and Bonham provided a great party atmosphere to what had to be a sold out crowd. I really hope that these guys will tour together again after their The Best of All Worlds Tour is over!\n\nSammy Hagar’s setlist:\n\n01. Good Enough\n\n02. Poundcake\n\n03. Runaround\n\n04.
