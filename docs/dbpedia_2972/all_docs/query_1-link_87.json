        "text": "Special guest: Platinum Blonde\n\nLegendary rocker Billy Idol embarks on his transcontinental Rebel Yell Canada 2024 arena tour this summer! Idol’s show will include a myriad of hits from across his career with a focus on the landmark Rebel Yell album, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary. Joining Idol is his longtime backing band, including his lead guitarist and collaborator of over 40 years, Steve Stevens. Canadian Walk Of Fame inductees Platinum Blonde will appear as special guest across all stops.\n\nOriginally released in November 1983, Rebel Yell is the twice-platinum follow up to Idol’s self-titled debut. The album features the iconic singles “Eyes Without a Face,” Flesh for Fantasy,” “Rebel Yell” and “Catch My Fall.” The reissue is available in 2xLP, 2xCD, and digital formats.\n\nLast year, Idol premiered the concert film Billy Idol: State Line documenting his April 2023 show at the famed Hoover Dam—the first-ever concert performed at the location—on DVD and Blu-ray following a successful limited theatrical run. The film highlights the history and significance of Hoover Dam and includes performances from two unique sets of Billy Idol’s iconic hits: a full band concert at sunset with special guests that electrified and illuminated the surrounding Black Canyon, and an acoustic duo set on the roof of the powerhouse at the foot of Hoover Dam straddling the Colorado River, directly on the Nevada/Arizona state line. For both sets, Idol is joined by his longtime collaborator and guitar player Steve Stevens, as well as special guests Alison Mosshart (The Kills, The Dead Weather), Steve Jones (Sex Pistols, Generation Sex) and Tony Kanal (No Doubt).\n\nFor 46 years, Billy Idol has been one of the definitive faces and voices of rock’n’roll. Between 1977 and 1981, Idol released three albums with Generation X as their camera-ready frontman. In 1982, he embarked on a transatlantic/trans-genre solo career that integrated the bold and simple lines of punk and rock’n’roll decadence. Touring consistently around the world for the last ten years and showing no signs of slowing down, Idol released both The Roadside EP in 2021 and The Cage EP in 2022 on Dark Horse Records, earning praise from fans and critics alike. In January, Idol cemented his name among Hollywood legends with the first Walk of Fame Star of 2023.\n\nPlatinum Blonde took the 80’s by storm with chart topping hits and a fresh new wave sound. In 1983 with members, Mark Holmes, Sergio Galli and Chris Steffler, Platinum Blonde quickly rose up the charts with their self-titled EP before releasing their debut album “Standing In The Dark” while on tour with Bryan Adams and Billy Idol. In 1985, they released their sophomore album “Alien Shores,” with new member Kenny Maclean which received multi-platinum status and delivered generation-transcending hits Situation Critical, Somebody Somewhere and Crying Over You. Their third studio album, “Contact,” achieved platinum sales mark and garnered the band a Gemini Award for Best Music Video. Platinum Blonde’s new wave sound defined a decade in Canadian music. In 2010, the band was Inducted into the Music, and Broadcast Industry Hall of Fame, and in 2023, they were inducted into Canada’s Walk of Fame.\n\nBell Centre\n\nAugust 16, 2024 at 8:00pm"
