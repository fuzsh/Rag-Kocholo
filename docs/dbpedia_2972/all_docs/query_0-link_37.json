        "text": "Paul McCartney and Wings\n\nBritish-American rock group\n\nPaul McCartney and Wings, British-American rock band founded by Beatles icon Paul McCartney (b. June 18, 1942, Liverpool, England) and his wife, Linda McCartney (b. Linda Eastman, September 24, 1941, Scarsdale, New York—d. April 17, 1998, Tucson, Arizona). After a lackluster start, the band became a showcase for Paul McCartney’s masterful songwriting skills and the best-selling pop act of the 1970s, with an astonishing 27 U.S. Top 40 hits (beating Elton John’s 25) and five consecutive number one albums, including the highly acclaimed Band on the Run (1973) and Wings at the Speed of Sound (1976).\n\nBeginnings and Wild Life\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Beatles, Paul McCartney released the albums McCartney (1970) and Ram (1971). However, he wanted to avoid long stretches away from his wife, Linda McCartney, whom he married in 1969. Having her tour with him and perform onstage would solve many of the problems that befall marriages in the world of popular music, so he taught her to play keyboards, and they formed a new band. He invited guitarist Denny Laine (b. Brian Hines, October 29, 1944, near Jersey, Channel Islands), former Moody Blues member and longtime friend, as well as Ram session drummer Denny Seiwell (b. July 10, 1943, Lehighton, Pennsylvania) to join.\n\nThe band, which Paul McCartney named Wings, recorded their first album, Wild Life (1971), in eight days to give it a live feel. The record, however, received mostly mediocre reviews from critics. In 1972 guitarist Henry McCullough (b. July 21, 1943, Portstewart, Northern Ireland—d. June 14, 2016, Ballymoney, Northern Ireland) joined Wings, and the band decided to embark on a tour to establish themselves. They avoided playing Beatles songs and only performed in small clubs and colleges in the United Kingdom.\n\nFirst hits: “My Love” and “Live and Let Die”\n\nIn 1973 the band renamed themselves Paul McCartney and Wings to combat the sluggish commercial response to Wings. They released Red Rose Speedway, which featured the single “My Love.” The song provided the band with their first hit, reaching number one in the United States. Later that year, the band released “Live and Let Die,” the theme for the James Bond film of the same name. It became the first James Bond song nominated for an Academy Award, and it garnered producer George Martin (who was extensively involved with all of the Beatles albums) a Grammy for his orchestral arrangement.\n\nBand on the Run\n\nAfter “Live and Let Die,” McCullough and Seiwell left the band, and the remaining members traveled to Lagos, Nigeria, to record Band on the Run. It became the band’s most successful album and later appeared on lists of the greatest rock records of all time. The title track reached number one in the United States, while the singles “Jet” and “Helen Wheels” ranked in the top 10. The album also won a Grammy for the best pop vocal performance by a group.\n\nVenus and Mars and Wings at the Speed of Sound\n\nWings added guitarist Jimmy McCulloch (b. June 4, 1953, Dumbarton, Scotland—d. September 27, 1979, London, England) and drummer Geoff Britton (b. August 1, 1943, London) to the lineup, but the latter left during the recording of Wing’s next album Venus and Mars (1975). He was replaced by Joe English (b. February 7, 1949, Rochester, New York) soon after. The album reached number one in the United States on the strength of the single “Listen to What the Man Said.”\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nThe release Wings at the Speed of Sound was a number one album in the United States. “Let ‘Em In,” and “Silly Love Songs” were massive hits, with the latter showcasing Linda’s vocals. Wings toured the United States on the Wings over America Tour, the first time Paul McCartney had played live in the U.S. since the last Beatles concert there, in 1966. The band also began playing Beatles songs, drawing yet more interest. The 1976 live album Wings over America documented the tour and was certified platinum in the United States.\n\n“Mull of Kintyre” and later albums\n\nIn 1977 Wings released “Mull of Kintyre,” which became the most successful single of Paul McCartney’s career, selling more than any Beatles single had in the United Kingdom. That same year, however, English and McCulloch left the band, with Paul McCartney, Linda McCartney, and Laine a trio once again. Wings’s subsequent albums had mixed success. London Town (1978) experimented with synth-pop, and, although the single “With a Little Luck” reached number one in the United States, reviews of the album were mixed. Back to the Egg (1979) had punk and new wave elements and showcased a new lineup that included drummer Steve Holley (b. August 24, 1954, London) and guitarist Laurence Juber (b. November 12, 1952, London). The album, however, received the worst reviews since the band’s first record. The highlight was “Rockestra Theme,” recorded with an all-star band that included Pete Townshend of the Who, David Gilmour of Pink Floyd, and John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin. It won a Grammy for best rock instrumental performance.\n\nDisbanding and legacy\n\nA series of events in 1980 led up to Paul McCartney choosing to dissolve Wings the following year. In January the band’s tour of Japan was canceled after McCartney was arrested for marijuana possession when he arrived at Narita International Airport, Tokyo. The tour was subsequently canceled, and McCartney delayed resuming public appearances, reportedly because of the assassination of John Lennon in December of that year. Laine, who had been a member of Wings for most of the band’s existence, and who wanted to tour, quit in 1981. Meanwhile, the success of McCartney’s solo album McCartney II (1980) offered the former Beatle new opportunities. Although he disbanded Wings in 1981 McCartney continued to perform songs from the band’s repertoire in the following decades. “Live and Let Die” became a staple at his concerts, including the halftime show at Super Bowl XXXIX in 2005."
