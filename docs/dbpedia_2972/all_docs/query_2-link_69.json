        "text": "Swift has yet to announce an official release date for \"Reputation (Taylor's Version),\" but fans think they've uncovered some Easter eggs she's dropped about the timeline. In the \"Karma (Remix)\" music video released this May, fans found lots of clues they thought pointed to Swift releasing \"1989 (Taylor's Version)\" sometime after \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version),\" which dropped in July. As for \"Reputation (TV),\" in one of the video's last shots, Swift holds a coffee cup; inside, her latte has art that looks like a clock. A finger with light-blue nail polish is by the eight on the clock, while a finger with black polish is by the two. Many fans have interpreted that to mean that \"1989 (Taylor's Version)\" would be released this August and \"Reputation (Taylor's Version)\" would be released in February 2024. It turns out this was actually a clue that \"1989\" would be announced in August, which would mean \"Reputation (TV)\" will be announced in February.\n\nSwift seemingly also dropped some more \"Reputation\" Easter eggs when she posted about her Eras Tour movie on Oct. 11. Sharing a photo of herself in her premiere dress (and with a commemorative soda cup), she wrote on Instagram, \"Andddd I can't really wrap my head around this but. . . . Look what you genuinely made me do.\" Fans clocked that as a reference to \"Look What You Made Me Do.\" She ended the caption with, \"Getting in the car now. . .\" That seems like a reference to fan-favorite \"Reputation\" track \"Getaway Car.\"\n\nSome fans think that actually, Swift is doing a complete fake-out with \"1989 (Taylor's Version)\" promotion and that actually she'll be releasing \"1989\" and \"Reputation\" at the same time. Others have theorized that Swift will drop \"Reputation (Taylor's Version)\" alongside \"Taylor Swift (Taylor's Version),\" her self-titled debut album that was originally released in 2006. \"Reputation\" the album is, in part, about Swift reclaiming and retelling her own story (and during the Eras Tour, she even turns \"Look What You Made Me Do\" into a tribute to her original albums). Releasing the album that literally bears her name alongside \"Reputation\" would be the perfect ending to the rerecording era.\n\nMany Swifties have also speculated that all the rerecorded versions will be released by the time the Eras Tour officially ends in the fall of 2024."
