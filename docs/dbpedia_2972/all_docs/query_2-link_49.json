        "text": "Angel Talk’s debut self-titled EP now available\n\nAngel Talk consisting of guitarist Tommy Krash (ex-Britny Fox) and new members — lead vocalist Steven Sylvain, drummer Max Sterling and bassist Harper Blaze — released their debut self-titled EP via the Zelly Entertainment Group on August 3, 2024. You can purchase Angel Talk‘s EP via their Bandcamp page and get two bonus tracks with the download.\n\nTrack List for Angel Talk EP:\n\n01. Red Hot\n\n02. Can’t Leave You Alone\n\n03. Are You Crazy\n\n04. Gotta Stop Runnin’\n\nBonus Tracks (with album download):\n\n05. She Wants Love (live)\n\n06. Lonely Too Long (Britney Fox cover)\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Sleaze Roxx, Krash explained why he has three new bandmates in Angel Talk. Krash stated: “I was working on a song called “Red Hot”, which is our new single. I went through several singers trying to get the right vocals. All the previous guys had cool parts but nobody nailed the song perfectly. When I met Steven, I put together a mix of the best parts of the previous singers and asked him to give it a try. His version took the best of everyone and made the song work how I was hearing it. “Red Hot” was not originally an Angel Talk song. It was just a song I was working on with some friends.\n\nThe final mix of “Red Hot” sounded a lot like Angel Talk so I had Steven try two of the old Angel Talk songs and it worked extremely well. He suggested Harper and Max to add their parts. Everything just worked so well. Angel Talk was originally just some friends writing and recording song in the vein of ’80s hard rock but we all had our main bands on the side. Bringing in the other guys pushed Angel Talk to the top of my list as far as bands that I am involved in. Matt Nardo (Leviathan Project / Angel Talk) is still very involved in the band as far as doing additional writing, vocals and guitars.”\n\nIn terms of the material on the new Angel Talk EP and why it didn’t feature the band’s previously released singles, Krash indicated: “Actually, “Can’t Leave You Alone” and “Crazy” were recorded before with Angel Talk. “Red Hot” and “Gotta Stop” are brand new. The bonus tracks, “She Wants Love” (live) and “Lonely Too Long” are also newly recorded.”\n\nAngel Talk‘s “Red Hot” single:"
