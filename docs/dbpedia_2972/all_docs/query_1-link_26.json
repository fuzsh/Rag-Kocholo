        "text": "Saturday turned out to be a beautiful day and it was lucky considering I was heading to Cambridge for the day with Kath D from back home. The train ride out from Liverpool Street Station turned out extremely easy (though lining up for tickets could have turned into a nightmare with long queues) and it was only an hour and twenty minutes before we arrived.\n\nCambridge station is bustling with lots of visitors and students, with a whole area devoted to parked bicycles instead of cars. There are plenty of buses that drop you off right into the middle of town as well, making it extremely to easy to get into the more interesting parts.\n\nThe most popular attractions in Cambridge centre around the river, where you can partake in punting and the large number of churches and colleges that are scattered throughout town. Walking up and down the various streets provides a great experience as little lanes and streets turn into new areas to discover.\n\nA festival was supposed to be on during the weekend but I didn’t get see anything like it. The closest thing was really the number of open air markets that were on which was nice wandering around.\n\nCambridge is definitely a great place to visit when in London and although it’s not a place you could probably stay for the weekend, provides a great outing for the day.\n\nThe number of bands that come and perform in London still really impresses me, and even though it is sometimes difficult to get ticket, the shows are always worth it. Last night I managed to catch yet another impressive performance by the John Butler Trio. Their support act was very impressive and really got the crowd involved in their rootsy-rock songs, but I unfortunately did not catch their name.\n\nIt wasn’t long before the John Butler Trio graced the stage and performed a set that easily went on for at least two hours. A large contingent of fans obviously came along that night, singing along with their well known songs, and the excellent number of solos and improvised versions of their songs resulted in several standing ovations through the night. One fan was so overwhelmed that he even lept on stage at the end of the night to shake hands with the band before security promptly separated him from a recoiling John Butler.\n\nThey played a large number of songs from their now classic album, Sunrise Over Sea and performed several from a newer album soon to be released. The quality of each performer really shone, with John Butler himself an excellent example, managing to perform a percussion and guitar duet all alone by wielding several parts of his guitar at the same time.\n\nThe Kua.com Rating: 8 out of 10\n\nWith four sold out concerts in a row at one of the biggest venues inside Central London, I knew the Red Hot Chilli Peppers would be performing one great show. The tickets for Monday night were not cheap – in fact, were by far the most expensive concerts tickets I’ve paid so far, but managing to score standing tickets was completely worth the money, with a solid performance lasting just over two hours.\n\nAnyone who has been to a concert at Earl’s Court will tell you how different the experience would be if you are standing (in effectively this case, one big giant mosh pit), or sitting where you get an overall better but more removed view of the stage. I’m not sure how many people were in the standing section, but certainly the waves of people trying to squeeze into every available space made it a little claustrophobic at times, but at least the cool air pumped into the crowd helped to bring some relief.\n\nThe set was a good mix of songs from their current amazing double album, Stadium Arcadium, and a brief selection from a number of their other albums. Some came from some of their early albums and helped to whip all their long term fans into quite a frenzied audience. The band even performed a small cover of the Bee Gee’s “How Deep Is Your Love” that the audience surprisingly lapped up.\n\nThe visuals for the night centred around four screens that moved around in various configurations, a set of six or seven hubs of lights that looked like mini UFOs and a set of horizontal bar lights covering the entire back of the stage that then reached across most of the standing audience. The screens played some awesome animations and merged at times to form one giant widescreen to show some of the incredible guitar duets or solos played throughout the night.\n\nI have no idea what it is, but the ability of the Red Hot Chilli Peppers to continue to produce quality rock music over so many years is a testament to their talent and I found their live performance easily matched anything you could find on their album.\n\nThe Kua.com Rating: 8 out of 10\n\nAlthough I’d planned my trip mainly for the Love Parade, it felt wrong to be in another country and ignore all of the local offerings as well. Over the weekend I managed to visit many of Berlin’s historical sites and buildings. I found some of the impressive ones included:#\n\nCheckpoint Charlie – The crossing made famous when the Berlin Wall separated the East from the West side of Berlin;\n\nThe Jewish Museum – An amazingly architected building recounting the build up and the horrors that ensued, all designed to get you thinking. I highly recommend visiting the Isolation Tower that really does what it sets out to achieve;\n\nThe Pergamon Museum – One of the most famous museums for its collection of ancient antiquities and an entire room containing a reconstruction of the Pergamon Alter. This museum’s English audio guide is one of the most comprehensive ones that I listened too and could easily keep you there for hours if you wanted to listen to it all;\n\nBradenburger Tor – The only neo classical gate left standing, though admittedly restored, all typically surrounded with tourists;\n\nFernsehturm – The well known television tower, currently transformed to look like a giant football (coloured pink!) for the World Cup;\n\nSiegessaule – An icon of this city that stands out from a distance as you look up any of its sprawling streets and the focal point for the Love Parade;\n\nThe Reichstag – An old building where politicians meet and an impressive backdrop for concerts;\n\nPotzdamer Platz – A hub of mostly modern buildings including the red bricked Daimler Chrysler building and the more stylish and more practical Sony Plaza – a popular place even having an Australian themed restaurant serving Kangaroo;\n\nApparently there is not very much local Berlin cuisine because historically they have shunned a lot of foreign cuisine and it is only now that they are starting to experiment more. Various sausages appear to be one of the most popular foods including the famous Currywurst – a friend sausage drowned in a brown sauce and dusted with curry powder, served with Pommes Frittes (Chips) likewise drowned in mayonnaise.\n\nIn terms of public transport Berlin has got it covered with subways, trains, trams and buses covering most of the city, including to and from the airport. Berlin has regular services and an all day ticket is easily worth the money though no one ever seems to check tickets.\n\nEven without the Love Parade to draw you to the city, I found that it still had plenty on offer. Like most cities, there are parts of it that was needlessly touristy, but there are also plenty of opportunities to mingle with the local crowd. Going in summer with the late summer sun and the great weather also helps to make the experience enjoyable. Now for some rest…\n\nMore photos available here.\n\nOr so the saying goes. Saturday was the return of the famous Love Parade festival to the streets of Berlin, something that I was fortunate to be able to attend this weekend. Berlin’s famous Siegessade is a perfect location for the centre of it too. Streets radiating out of this giant pinnacle all packed with people following the floats pumping out dance music. The hundreds of thousands of people celebrated the return of this festival, evident by the huge number of people dancing and chilling to the music and atmosphere that this free festival had on offer.\n\nMany people came out dressed to impressed, while others neglected to bring (or at least put on) some of their clothing. It’s a great parade and you can indulge yourself as little or as much as you want. The streets did get a little crazy, particularly as the parade ended, but relief was not too far away for the crowds with all the parkland of the Tiergarten in all directions.\n\nThe parade of floats, numbering easily into the thirties, all brought with them their own unique styles to the festival. Some people chose to follow a particular float as it circled up and down each of the radiated streets, and others stood their ground, instead showered by all the music on offer. Sometimes even lucky festival-goers got invited to join one of the floats, allowing them with an unchallenged view of everything.\n\nI think it’s a great thing that the parade is free, and even better to find out how friendly all the people are. For those with limitless energy or those that started late in the day, many clubs hold after parties (all unfortunately not as free). I’m glad that I was able to see the return of this festival, and look forward to next year’s. For more photos, I suggest you look at Flickr.\n\nThekua.com Rating: 9 out of 10\n\nCrowds of people congregating in front of a theatre dressed (or undressed) in various costumes including vinyl nurse outfits and outrageous fishnet stocking can only mean one thing… The Rocky Horror Show is about to begin. On Tuesday night I ended up seeing this classical musical and found it extremely bizarre especially since I had not seen the movie before and had no idea what the story would be about. If there is one thing I concluded from seeing this musical, people do not go see the movie for its story.\n\nOf all the shows that I have seen so far, this one had much larger audience participation, boosted by a number of cast extras strategically scattered throughout the crowd. The extras throughout the night hassled the actors on stage by shouting out comments and obscenities at certain parts throughout the play, sometimes proving comical, but at many other times failing dismally as they missed their cue or as the band drowned them out.\n\nI found the songs and the music piercingly loud, despite sitting in the middle of the stalls and not in front of any particular loud speaker. The crowd obviously had watched the musical, or at least, had listened to the soundtrack a lot as many of them sang along throughout the performance.\n\nI think this long running musical has a lot of fun points and I think you will enjoy it as long as you don’t take anything too seriously. It is definitely not the highest quality musical showing at the West End, but its fame from the classic movie and quirkiness will easily win any fans over.\n\nTheKua.com Rating: 6.5 out of 10\n\nYou can find this New Zealand run Spanish tapas restaurant and café on Marlyebone High Street, an older and more upmarket part of London. This street also houses other well known institutions such as a Conran restaurant (which one?) and The Grange. Much like many other London stores, The Providores makes an amazingly efficient use of space fitting into two rows of dining tables into what I would normally consider barely enough for a standing bar area.\n\nArranging a place for breakfast to fit any group about ten is usually quite difficult, so we decided to meet early and arrived at opening at 10am. I think we were all glad we did though considering that it took all of fifteen minutes for this place to fill with diners and not much more to have a queue spilling out onto the pavement.\n\nInside on the ground floor of the café, the decorations are lavish without being tacky and all of it looking quite Spanish, thought I am definitely not expert. The high tables and chairs we sat on were quite comfortable and as tiny as this place was, there was enough space that I didn’t feel like I was eating in a shoe box.\n\nThe breakfast offerings at this place is overwhelming with a number of variations of the English fry up, a few selections of Spanish food, and a huge number of other staple breakfast foods. The French Toast I had was definitely unique with banana and pecans sandwiched between two pieces of bread before being covered in the egg, and a wickedly sweet vanilla syrup substituted for the traditional maple one. I can’t say the bacon was as good as others I’ve had, it was still a great combination, well presented and definitely filling.\n\nIt’s always good visiting new places, especially if a lazy breakfast is involved and this one proved to be enjoyable both in service and cuisine. I can overlook the strangeness of this Kiwi-run Spanish restaurant serving English breakfasts because none of the elements detracted from the overall quality of the place and the company was as good as ever.\n\nI’m definitely keen to check out the tapas they have on offer at sometime, but the breakfast is worth going for.\n\nDetails: The Providores and Tapa Room\n\nFound On: 109 Marylebone High Street, London, England W1U 4RX\n\nHighlights: Huge variety of breakfast – some traditional – some more unique\n\nImprovements: Could fit more people in at a bigger location\n\nThe Kua Rating: 8 out of 10"
