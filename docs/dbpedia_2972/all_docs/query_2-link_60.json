        "text": "50 Years of Hampton Coliseum Events\n\nNumerous musicians have graced the Hampton Coliseum stage for concerts of every magnitude. From the local Peninsula Symphony Orchestra to worldwide sensations like Elvis Presley, Garth Brooks, and Michael Jackson, every experience is different from the last. Some groups like the Rolling Stones and Grateful Dead have released live recordings of their concerts at Hampton Coliseum, preserving their iconic performances for audiences to enjoy for years to come.\n\nThe Hampton Roads landmark stands as a mecca for devoted music fans. Dedicated followers of bands like Grateful Dead and Phish flock to \"The Mothership,” named for the building’s spaceship-like exterior. The Grateful Dead performed 21 concerts at Hampton Coliseum between 1979 and 1992 including their now-famous 1989 shows. Dead & Company continues their musical legacy, most recently performing to nearly soldout crowds in 2019. Phish released the live album Hampton Comes Alive from their back-to-back 1998 shows as well as chose Hampton Coliseum as the site of their 2009 reunion. The band has performed at the venue 21 times between 1995 and 2018. In the past few years, the electronic/bass music DJ known as Bassnectar brought weekends of Basslights and Bass Center to the Mothership, with avid fans embracing the “alien” and “spaceship” themes.\n\nNot just a music hub, the Coliseum has hosted thousands of other events including recurring sporting events like Monster Jam and Professional Bull Riders, as well as family shows like Disney On Ice and Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus.\n\nTake a look at some of our notable events throughout the past 50 years!"
