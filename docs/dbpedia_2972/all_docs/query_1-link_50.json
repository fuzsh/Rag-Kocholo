        "text": "Jesus Is My Hype Man\n\nThe South Bronx's premiere hip-hop pastor expertly mingles the dope with the dopey\n\nReverend Timothy Holder, honorable 51-year-old white pastor of the South Bronx's Trinity Episcopal Church of Morrisania, would like it known that he came by both his hip-hop alias and his \"beautiful bling cross\" honorably. Both were presents. \"Poppa T,\" he declares proudly. \"A gift from the rappers. That's my street name. And I own it with all my heart.\"\n\nPoppa T's been here four years now, after a distinguished career in D.C. politics (involved with \"every losing campaign in the 1980s\") and five years in Alabama founding a Spanish-speaking parish. He deems the language barrier he faced there \"instructive,\" as now he's attempting an even tougher translation: Introducing rappers to God, and his God-fearing congregation to the rappers they often fear for entirely different reasons. Trinity Episcopal's HipHopEMass, a two-year-old experiment in imbuing a typical church service with streetwise vernacular and freestyle rappers, invades the South Bronx streets about once a month, when Poppa T and crew aren't traveling the cityâinvading St. Paul's, near the World Trade Center site, for a June hoedownâor fleeing the state entirely for outreach missions in Ohio or Texas. \"The goal, my brother, is to pull people out of the church into the street, and people just on the street into the church,\" Poppa T explains. \"As the old Anglican priests said, 'If you don't have both, you have neither....' \"\n\nPAYBACK IS A MOTHERLAND\n\n... [Faada] Freddy, whose Senegalese rap trio Daara J performs for free in Loring Park on Monday, is a foremost advocate for the theory that, by finding embrace in Africa, hip hop has \"come home.\" Collaborating freely (the crew recently recorded with Malian legend Salif Keita) and inflecting their tassou with dancehall toasts and R&B melodies, Daara J's sales pitch nevertheless relies on their association with the oldest of old schools.\n\n\"The storytellers used songs to say, 'This is how we should act,'\" says Freddy. \"It was a way for them to remind us that socially, politically, we have to be involved. Back then there were no TVs, no Internet neither. The only way for people to communicate was through the griots. Pop music was a way to know what was going on in the countryside.\"\n\nThese days, rap music has become a way for African immigrants, including thousands of Minnesotans, to connect with their home countries. No longer just black America's CNN, hip hop is a griot for a black planet.\n\nWhich is why I'm surprised to learn that Freddy, who grew up speaking Wolof, has never heard of the theory that \"hip\" originated from xippi. At the mention of this, the expert rhetorician nearly leaps through the phone.\n\n\"And xeupp [pronounced 'hop'] means 'to pour something,'\" he says. \"When you're just full of something, you pour it. Like when you're full of emotion, you give it to the people.\"\n\nMost African rappers hesitate to claim hip hop for Africa. \"It's a good story,\" says Ghanaian-born M.anifest, smiling in a way that suggests he thinks Faada Freddy is full of something, all right (though he admires Daara J's live show). \"Plus they named their CD Boomerang. Very smart marketing...\"\n\n...what this means is that for the next thirty days I'm going to be reading almost entirely blogs written by black people. I'm going to get my news and opinions from black publications, I'm going to read magazines and web sites published and written by and for black people. I'm going to read novels, drama, and poetry written by black authors, watch black films, listen to black radio stations, and so forth.\n\nThis is an experiment for me. I'm not trying to be black, or become black or pretend like I'm black or any of that stuff. I'm just very curious to learn how looking at the world through this lens will affect me, my white thinking, and my white perspective. Will it sharpen my awareness, increase my insights, alter my feelings, improve my ability to understand what it's like to be black in this society? Of course, I already tend to think of myself as a Good Liberal Anti-Racist White Person. But I've been wondering, how deep does this identity really run? What can I discover about gaps and weak links and blind spots in my anti-racist commitment by indulging in this experiment?"
