        "text": "From the fjords of Norway comes a dark, hellacious sound as black metal outfit 1349 released a new single and accompanying music video off their forthcoming album The Wolf and The King. The track, aptly titled “The God Devourer” is a bitingly ferocious new track that’s sure to get black metal fans chomping at the bit for October 4.\n\nAs the album’s third single, it makes sense that the band would choose a track that’s just balls to the wall. Frontman Ravn outlines exactly what makes this track so special among the other songs on the band’s eighth full-length.\n\n“’The God Devourer.’ Opening track of ‘The Wolf and the King.’ It tears a hole in the universe and set the atmosphere for the album as a whole. It strangely also resonates perfectly with the ominous apocalyptic mood of the world today.”\n\nSounds about right, given what we’ve heard not just from this track, but from the other two singles “Ash of Ages” and “Shadow Point.”\n\nThe Wolf and The King will be available via Season of Mist on October 4, but you can pre-save and pre-order your copy today.\n\nThe Wolf and The King tracklist:\n\n1. The God Devourer\n\n2. Ash of Ages\n\n3. Shadow Point\n\n4. Inferior Pathways\n\n5. Inner Portal\n\n6. The Vessel and The Storm\n\n7. Obscura\n\n8. Fatalist"
