        "text": "Take me back to July 18, 2006\n\nLet's take a walk down memory lane.\n\nIt is Tuesday, July 18, 2006. Babies who are born today will have the star sign Cancer. The summer of 2006 is in full swing. The weather is warm, and the evenings are brighter than usual. Most schools and colleges are now finished until August or September.\n\nIn America, the song \"Promiscuous\" by Nelly Furtado ft Timbaland is at the top of the singles charts, while \"Smile\" by Lily Allen is the number-one song in the UK. George W. Bush Jnr. is the President of the United States, and the movie Superman Returns is at the top of the box office. Tony Blair is the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\nPeople are using a software program called LimeWire to share music, software, and videos. Unfortunately, it is also a haven for computer viruses. Smartphones don't exist yet. There are no Androids or iPhones. Cameras on phones have now become the norm. Furthermore, the quality of these cameras is continuing to increase with each new phone release. We are now entering an age where any event can be instantly photographed or recorded.\n\nPractically every teenager and adult has a MySpace or Bebo account. It's 2006, so the music charts are being dominated by the likes of Daniel Powter, Sean Paul, Nelly Furtado, James Blunt, Gnarls Barkley, Shakira and Natasha Bedingfield. A rock music genre called \"Emo\" is extremely popular at the moment. The genre, which stands for \"emotional hardcore\", has created a subculture of \"Emos\" who dye their hair black and wear thick-framed glasses.\n\nIf you were to travel back to this day, notable figures such as Steve Irwin, Adrienne Shelly, James Brown, and Gerald Ford would all still be alive. On TV, people are watching popular shows such as \"Futurama\", \"24\", \"MythBusters\", and \"Hogan Knows Best\". Meanwhile, gamers are playing titles such as \"The Sims 2\", \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", \"Shadow of the Colossus\", and \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\n\nKids and teenagers are watching TV shows such as \"7th Heaven\", \"Grizzly Tales for Gruesome Kids\", \"The Fairly OddParents\", and \"ChalkZone\". Popular toys at the moment include Betty Spaghetty (doll), Bionicle LEGO, RoboSapien (toy robot), and InteracTV."
