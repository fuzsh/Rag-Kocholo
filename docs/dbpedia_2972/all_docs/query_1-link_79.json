        "text": "Past episodes of this column have featured references to fake scholarly rock books, many of which readers kindly tried to seek out. So let me begin by saying that the book under discussion this time is completely real. Wesleyan University Press is legit, and Empire of Dirt: The Aesthetics and Rituals of British Indie Music is currently on sale. The book is written by Wendy Fonarow, an anthropology professor at UCLA who spent years working for Domino Records. A friend with a PhD in gender studies told me that the cleavage in Fonarow’s author photo was a way of taking back sexuality. The book has a website called “indiegoddess.com.” It also has a MySpace page, which links to that of “Professor Wendy.” Fonarow’s marketing seems to be riding that awkward vibe generated by collisions between scholarly speech and pop fandom. You know, like how some “serious” studies of say, \"The Simpsons\", can seem like Entertainment Weekly for smartypants.\n\nI love me some academic writing, and I love me some anthropology. I love that when Professor Wendy went to rock shows throughout the 1990s, she was conducting “field research.” By that measure, the average Pitchfork reader probably deserves an honorary PhD. I love the obvious sentences with Gandalfian heft that professors get to publish: “Individuals have vested interests.” Did you know that? “Spectatorship is a theoretical concept derived from a combination of psychoanalysis, linguistics, and film theory.” And you thought you was just an idle gazer. “Meaning is built interactionally across modalities.” I don’t know what to say. (I got no beef with rock being discussed hifalutinly; David Grubbs recently argued in a letter to The New York Times that rock writers shouldn’t be mocked for refusing to condescend to their subjects.)\n\nThese are a few of my favorite things:\n\n• The book’s outdatedness will give old-school indie rockers some misguided nostalgia for 1990s dualities: organic versus synthetic, mainstream versus alternative, etc. Now that elements of dance music (from drum machines to attitudes) have all but triumphed over honorable ol’ six-string podunkery, we can sigh in unison. Remember Bob Moog named the synthesizer after its ability to synthesize sound, not (as rockists have wrongly perpetuated) because of any inherent privileging of the synthetic (in the sense of “unoriginal”). My favorite album of 1991? Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge. Of 2006? Silent Shout.\n\n• Also outdated is her insistence that “indie” has something to do with “moral ideals” or “asceticism in consumption.” Come on, there’s Vice now. I and my indie friends acquire way more than we commune. We aren’t ascetic; we dread moving to new apartments because our walls and walls of indie accouterments are so cumbersome!\n\n• A sentence that I hate will often precede a sentence that I love. Example: “In indie, emotions are considered to be the essential source of meaning. Indie music values verisimilitude and novelty within a circumscribed generic form.”\n\n• Artists themselves might be miffed by Fonarow’s borderline overappreciation for those who populate/operate the music-biz apparatus. I mean, to some degree, the rock press is parasitic; at the very least, some practitioners maintain emulative fantasies of artist-caliber significance. Ex: Fonarow does not make music, but her website is “indiegoddess.” She says that her book “feels like an album that took 10 years to create.” To her credit, she writes: “Contrary to the widespread beliefs that journalists and music industry professionals are failed musicians, it is more accurate to think of them as highly professional fans who have parlayed their interest in contact with musicians into successful careers for themselves.”\n\n• For a book about the UK, a disproportionate number of her examples and quotes come from freedom’s cradle, the golden US of A. And way too many of her snippets are of unremarkable or cliché lines. Even the title is Trent Reznor’s baby.\n\n• Way too much attention is paid to rituals that (I hope) don’t happen so much anymore: moshing and crowdsurfing. Maybe I just go to the wrong shows. Fonarow’s analysis of the gayness of these practices’ female-exclusiveness is apt.\n\n• Fonarow analyzes fascinatingly British terms such as “punters,” “liggers,” and “blag.” These terms involve folks trying to get promos and get into gigs. Up-to-the-moment research would analyze not industry hangers-on but anonymous broadband pirates vying in sad forums to be the first ones to “leak” a “rip” of a release months before its quaint street date. These folks often mock Sudanese refugees by using the word “need,” as in: “Oh man, I need that new Lambchop.”\n\n• She ageistly calls the thirties an indie individual’s “sell by” date! Ow! If that’s true, then Pitchfork should hire teenage stand-ins to wear our staff badges at this year’s music festival! I’ve often felt, against my CEO’s good faith, that this site pays undue attention to brand new music when so few recent albums are better than, say, David Bowie’s Low, but I was shut right up by Fonarow’s citation of an NME reader’s letter stating that they should never talk about old music because the magazine’s acronym doesn’t stand for “Necrophiliac Mortuary Echo”! (To be honest: Her breakdown of the experienced listener’s lack of investment/verve, based on hearing every new band as an amalgam of past bands, struck a nearby nerve.)\n\n• Fonarow’s book is most interesting when she engages this huge religious analogy about how the front portions of indie concerts are West African while the midsection is reactionarily Christian, which is why this column is called Puritan Blister! She notes how few of the “zone two” concertgoers stoop to boogie. (The old joke: Why don’t Christians have sex standing up? Because someone would think they were dancing.) How can you not love a sentence that acknowledges indie’s tendency to cloak its wildness in it mildness? “Indie hides its trickerism behind an earnest Puritan façade.” The rock kids mate and move to the ‘burbs, she argues, after they realize in late adulthood that, as Morrissey sang, the music says “nothing to them about their lives.” I hope that, at 40, I can argue over crepes with my fourth wife about the Arcade Fire’s tragic missteps."
