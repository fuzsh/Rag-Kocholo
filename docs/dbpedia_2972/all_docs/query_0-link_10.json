        "text": "Apple’s fifth developer beta of iOS 18 introduces significant changes to the Photos app, notably removing the Carousel feature. This update aims to streamline the user experience and address feedback from early testers.\n\nCarousel Feature Removed\n\nThe Carousel view, which allowed users to swipe through algorithmically selected content from the main grid, is no longer available in this beta version. Apple has not confirmed whether this feature will return in future updates. The removal follows user complaints that the Carousel complicated quick access to frequently used elements.\n\nEnhancements to All Photos View\n\nIn the latest beta, the All Photos view has been updated to display more of the photo grid. This change makes it easier for users to browse through their collections. Additionally, albums are now elevated higher in the interface, providing quicker access to user-created albums.\n\nRecent Days Row Improvements\n\nThe Recent Days row, showcasing photos and videos from the past few days, now includes recently saved content. This improvement ensures that users can quickly find and view their most recent captures without navigating through multiple screens.\n\nUser Feedback Drives Changes\n\nThese updates come after considerable feedback from beta users who expressed concerns about the app’s usability. The streamlined interface in earlier betas made it harder for users to access the features they used most frequently. Apple has responded by making the Photos app more intuitive and user-friendly.\n\nThe Photos app refinements are exclusive to the fifth developer beta of iOS 18 and are not yet present in iOS 18.1. Developers can test these changes and provide additional feedback to help Apple fine-tune the final release. Apple continues to run parallel beta tests for both current and upcoming operating systems, including iOS 17 and iOS 18.1.\n\nApple’s decision to remove the Carousel feature from the Photos app in the fifth iOS 18 developer beta highlights its commitment to enhancing user experience based on feedback. As beta testing progresses, more refinements are expected, ensuring that the final release of iOS 18 meets the needs and expectations of its users."
