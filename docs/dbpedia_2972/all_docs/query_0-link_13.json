The craftmanship that goes into a Gibson acoustic guitar is world famous - and their sound has made careers.\n\nThe Gibson J-45 is an iconic acoustic guitar and is loved by many. Musicians dead and alive have depended on this 'workhorse' to write some of the most famous songs ever created.\n\nWithout going into too much company history, the mid-80s saw Gibson open two new guitar building plants. One in Memphis and one in Bozeman, Montana. \"The Memphis facility is used for semi-hollow and custom shop instruments, while the Bozeman facility is dedicated to acoustic instruments.\" (wikipedia)\n\nSo let's get to the good stuff. What musicians have used Gibson acoustic guitars that (at least more recently) have been made in Bozeman, Montana? The list is long and diverse. Certainly the oldest musician/guitar pairings may not have had their guitars made in Montana, but the Gibson brand is now intimately tied to Bozeman.\n\nYou can find lists of Gibson acoustic artists all over the place. Coleman's Music put together a decent list that includes:\n\nBruce Springsteen\n\nTom Petty\n\nPete Townsend\n\nBob Dylan (his own signature Gibson SJ-200)\n\nJames Taylor\n\nNoel Gallagher J-150\n\nYou can find lists of Gibson acoustic artists all over the place. Coleman's Music put together a decent list that includes:\n\nWoody Guthrie played a Gibson J-45 acoustic guitar and is known for using the instrument to write many of his famous protest songs.\n\nPaul McCartney played a Gibson J-45 acoustic guitar during the recording of The Beatles' White Album.\n\nSheryl Crow plays a Gibson Country Western acoustic guitar.\n\nEmmylou Harris plays a Gibson Hummingbird acoustic guitar.\n\nKeith Richards played a Gibson J-200 acoustic guitar during many of The Rolling Stones' live performances.\n\nJimmy Page played a variety of Gibson acoustic guitars throughout his career, including the J-200 and the Hummingbird.\n\nGrace Potter was given a Gibson Hummingbird years ago at one of her shows in Livingston, Montana. It was early on in her career and I was lucky enough to be at a dinner with her before the show.\n\nJohn Hiatt\n\nLenny Kravitz\n\nLightnin' Hopkins\n\nGillian Welch\n\nDave Grohl\n\nBuddy Holly\n\nElvis Presley\n\n\"Full acoustic guitars such as the Gibson J Series are made in Bozeman, Montana. In 2021â€“2022, Gibson expanded the Bozeman facility from 23,000 square feet to 48,000 square feet.\" (wikipedia)\n\n20 of the Most-Attended Rock Tours Ever\n\nCollectively, tens of millions of people around the world saw these shows.\n\nGallery Credit: Allison Rapp\n\nTop 15 Friendliest States According To Tourist\n\n\"Using data gathered by the World Population Review, Newsweek has created a map that provides a snapshot of where tourists and residents can experience warm interactions within highly hospitable communities.\" - Newsweek\n\nGallery Credit: Kyle Matthews"
