        "text": "Mick Jagger has spent most of his life entertaining the masses. Since 1962, he’s fronted the Rolling Stones. For over 60 years, he has inspired countless performers. For most of that time, he’s been the gold standard for fronting a band. Imitators have come and gone for decades, but they’ve proved one thing: There’s only one Mick Jagger.\n\nRemarkably, he’s still going strong. In honor of his birthday today (July 26), we take a look at ten iconic performances from Jagger’s career.\n\nBut First, A Look At What’s New With Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones\n\nIn October 2023, the Rolling Stones released Hackney Diamonds. It was the band’s first studio album of original material since 2005’s A Bigger Bang. The Stones announced the album in a press conference in September 2023 hosted by Jimmy Fallon.\n\nDuring the press conference, Mick Jagger said of the album, “We wouldn’t be putting this out now if we didn’t really like it. We didn’t want to make just any record and put it out. So we wanted to make a record.”\n\nJagger added, “Before we went in, we said we all want to make a record that we really love, ourselves. People may like it, other people may not. But we must say this, we are quite pleased with it. … We hope you’ll like it.”\n\nThe Rolling Stones returned to the road in April 2024 in support of Hackney Diamonds. The tour saw the band make their way through some of the biggest stadiums in the United States, from MetLife Stadium in New Jersey to Soldier Field in Chicago.\n\nThe Stones weren’t alone on the trek; they had a diverse slate of opening acts on their 19-date tour. Those acts included Gary Clark Jr., Carin Leon, Electric Mud, The Pretty Reckless, Joe Bonamassa, Lawrence, The Red Clay Strays, Tyler Childers, Ghost Hounds, KALEO, Widespread Panic, Bettye LaVette, Lainey Wilson, The War and Treaty, The Linda Lindas and Beaches.\n\nOf course, even though they were on tour, that doesn’t mean a wild backstage atmosphere. While they’re incredible legends, they’ve apparently mellowed in recent years, especially when it comes to their tour rider.\n\nBassist Darryl Jones touched on this with the U.K.’s Daily Star (via BANG Showbiz). Years ago, the Stones required a gaming room with a snooker table and various video game cabinets. However, the band has scaled back their backstage setup quite a bit, but Jones said the important things are still there.\n\n“Keith [Richards] still has what he loves, shepherd’s pie,” said Jones. “There’s so much food backstage, me and the keyboard player have our own rider.”"
