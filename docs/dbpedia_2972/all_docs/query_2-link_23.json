        "text": "Post by singingsparrow on\n\nThird Eye Blind have actually been active as of late writing songs for a forthcoming fourth studio album due in 2007 (no specific month is mentioned).\n\nHere's a list of tentative song titles that may or make not make the final cut:\n\n*\n\n\"Don't Believe a Word\"\n\n\"Lay Back (And The Water Will Hold You)\"\n\n\"In the Skin\"\n\n\"Summer Town\"\n\n\"Second Born\"\n\n\"Campfire\"\n\n\"Monotov's Private Opera\"\n\n\"Break Me\"\n\n\"Stevie Ray Vaughan\"\n\n\"Red Star\"\n\n\"Standing Up For You.\"\n\n\"Away\"\n\n\"A Sharp Knife\"\n\n\"Captain of Emo\"\n\n\"Swimming\"\n\n\"Jesse 2k\"\n\n*\n\nI too miss Third Eye Blind a lot, and really enjoyed it when they released \"Persephone\" for the first time as a free MySpace download last year. That is one of my favorite tracks of theirs to date.\n\nStephen Jenkins is a little too moody to my tastes personally, and still dislike it when he went after Rob Thomas in a feud and accused him of being \"fat\", but he is still one heck of a songwriter as well and one of my favorite 90's artists.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNoah Eaton\n\nPost by singingsparrow on\n\njuhn said:\n\nNone of you are funny or witty.\n\nThird Eye Blind was one of my favorite bands. Their first album was filled solid material from start to end. But the quality went downhill from there.\n\nI absolutely agree with you on their debut album (the final three tracks on the album are brilliant) but \"Blue\" was a strong sophomore album as well in my opinion, where though nothing was quite as remarkable as \"God of Wine\" or \"Motorcycle Drive-By\", there were still memorable moments on \"Darkness\", \"Wounded\" and \"Slow Motion\".\n\nThe main problem with their third album \"Out Of The Vein\" was the departure of their lead guitarist Kevin Cadogan dramatically affecting the innovative atmosphere of their music. Cadogan was really the architect behind much of the music of the first two records (he wrote 10 of the 14 songs on the debut record, and six of the 13 songs on \"Blue\") whereas Jenkins was the lyrical mastermind, and Cadogen's absence on the record resulted in a less-inspiring record musically, where most of the album was more mainstream-sounding and poppy, with the first seven tracks on the album seemingly sounding tailor-made for radio. There were still a few good songs on there, especially \"Palm Reader\" and \"Good Man\" which were the lyrical standouts, but even there you don't get much of that wow effect musically.\n\nCadogen's replacement Tony Fredianelli just seems to lack that creative summit he had, and that's my main worry about the band from here on out.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNoah Eaton"
