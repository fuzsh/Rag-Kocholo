        "text": "It’s been a long time to get to this point, but Slipknot‘s long-anticipated North American ‘Here Comes the Pain Tour’ is officially in full swing here in the states after last night’s performance at the Ruoff Music Center in Noblesville, Indiana. The tour was long hyped up as a celebration of the band’s self-titled release, which turned 25 earlier this year. The band itself kept letting everyone know that this was going to be a special run of dates that any Slipknot fan wouldn’t want to miss.\n\nYet looking at the setlist from last night, it’s obvious that the band wasn’t going to be fucking around on this tour. As you can see from the list below, many of the songs they hadn’t played in years and not a single one was written after 1999. You can check out the setlist below:\n\nSlipknot @ Ruoff Music Center – 8/6/24 Setlist (Setlist.fm)\n\n742617000027 (played over PA)\n\n(sic)\n\nEyeless\n\nWait and Bleed\n\nGet This (first time since 2019)\n\nEeyore\n\nTattered & Torn (Sid Wilson Remix) (played over PA)\n\nMe Inside (first time since 2015)\n\nLiberate\n\nFrail Limb Nursery (played over PA)\n\nPurity\n\nProsthetics\n\nNo Life (first time since 2000)\n\nOnly One (first time since 2012)\n\nEncore:\n\nMudslide (played over PA)\n\nSpit It Out\n\nSurfacing\n\nScissors (first time since 2000)\n\nLooking at that list of songs, as well as the fan footage that’s made its way online, it should go without saying that this show looks awesome. If you’re a fan of old school Slipknot, you’re definitely not going to miss it. Along with the fact that Knocked Loose is the tour’s opener, this looks like one hell of a way to close out the summer.
