        "text": "More Cold Chisel\n\nIt was 1983, and fans didnât know it would be another 15 years before they saw Cold Chisel on stage again. However, with the 1984 Last Stand concert documentary film and subsequent accompanying soundtrack album, they likely had an inkling that things with the iconic rockers would be reaching an end.\n\nThis isnât the first box set Cold Chisel have assembled for their fans. In October 2020, Cold Chisel announced the fifth edition of their Live Tapes archival series. Captured on two multitrack tapes on a Friday night in Sydney in February 1980, the iconic Aussie outfit released The Live Tapes Vol 5 - Live at the Bondi Lifesaver in December 2020.\n\nâIn 1980, we were fighting fit and hungry, playing every show like it was our last â and often it almost was,â vocalist Jimmy Barnes said.\n\nâWe were still playing pubs, with the audience spilling onto the stage and the band spilling into the audience.\n\nâI was living just around the corner from the Lifesaver - and probably half the audience ended up back at mine.â\n\nFor the first time in 40 years, the bandâs four Last Stand shows at Sydney Entertainment Centre, which were recorded and filmed at the time, will finally be seen in the Last Stand â 40th Anniversary Box Set.\n\nDon't miss a beat with our FREE daily newsletter\n\nThe Last Stand 40th Anniversary Box Set will arrive with additional tracks never featured on vinyl or CD, photos, posters, and an authentic tour laminate.\n\nAlso, for the first time in its history, the 19-track Last Stand album is coming as a beautiful, remastered double album on thick 180g vinyl. Last Stand was originally released on CD in 1992 and has never seen the light of day on vinyl.\n\nIn addition to the original tracklisting of the Last Stand, Cold Chisel are releasing the Barking Spiders concert, also recorded in 1983. While at the time, no mention of Cold Chisel was made when Barking Spiders went on stage, the 12 songs they performed made it clear who was on stage.\n\nCold Chisel are releasing another exciting item in the Last Stand 40th anniversary box set: the 10\" vinyl mini-album Last Stand Outtakes. This release, which has never been on vinyl or CD, includes four outtakes.\n\nThe vinyl options are also coming on CD and DVD, alongside an iconic photo of Barnesy, one of three individually numbered photos from the Last Stand concerts photographed by Greg Noakes, and a special backstage laminate from the Last Stand tour."
