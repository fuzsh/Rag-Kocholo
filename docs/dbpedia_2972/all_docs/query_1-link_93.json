        "text": "In my ‘Dylan covers’ research I have discovered just over 200 Dylan songs covered by around 120 Aussie artists. My aim is to give each artist a moment of ‘glory’ in one of my articles. So, in this 7th ‘Dylan covers’ article, I drill down to expose those ‘under the radar’* Aussie males who have taken the plunge to cover a Dylan song on a commercially available album/single that also has an accompanying YouTube clip.\n\nThe entries in this article will be chronicled in the order that the cover songs were originally recorded by Dylan. It has been fortunate that each of the eleven artists featured in this article have chosen a different song from Dylan’s vast songbook, with only a small number being what you may classify as ‘Dylan classics’. It has been a pleasant surprise to find that the overall quality of the cover songs is of a high standard, given the number of ‘self-release’ albums.\n\n*Some of the artists in this article will be well known to some Almanackers. I have taken the liberty of applying the rule that if the artist is not a ‘household name’ then they are ‘under the radar’, and thus provide a unique opportunity to showcase their talent.\n\nAndrew Kidman\n\nAndrew (born 1970) is a musician, director, writer, and surfboard shaper. He is, perhaps, best known as the author of one of the most exquisite films on surfing (‘Litmus’, 1996).\n\nBetween 2001 – 2007, Andrew self-released three albums, and it was on track 7 of his debut album The Spaces In Between that Andrew covers Dylan’s ‘Mama You Been On My Mind’.\n\n?\n\nAlthough not a household name, Andrew’s YouTube clip has received an impressive 66,382 views over the past 14 years and includes some exceptional surf footage.\n\nDylan recorded ‘Mama You Been On My Mind’ on 9 June 1964 (during the Another Side Of Bob Dylan recording sessions) but the song was not included on the album. It was eventually released on the 1991 Bootleg Series Vol 1-3: Rare & Unreleased box set.\n\nDespite the song not being officially released by Dylan until 1991, it was covered by several notable 60’s artists, including Johnny Cash, Joan Baez, Judy Collins and Australia’s own Doug Ashdown. To date, the song has been covered by around 50 artists.\n\nMichael Carpenter\n\nMichael (born 1967) has been playing gigs as a musician for over 35 years, as well as running his own Sydney-based recording studio (Love Hz Studio) and producing records (Big Radio Records) since 1991.\n\nMichael has self-released eleven albums as a singer-songwriter since 1999. On his 3rd album, soop #1, he performs 12 songs of other people (i.e. ‘soop’). The 7th track is a cover of Dylan’s ‘Chimes Of Freedom’.\n\n?\n\nThis YouTube clip has only received 101 views over the past 8 years – so it’s time to add a few more.\n\nDylan recorded ‘Chimes Of Freedom’ on 9 June 1964 and it was released on the August 1964 Another Side Of Bob Dylan album.\n\nIn June 1965, The Byrds recorded the most commercially successful cover of ‘Chimes Of Freedom’. Michael’s cover was the 16th version of just over 40 cover versions released to date.\n\nPhil Cunneen\n\nPhil was an arranger and musical director at Adelaide-based Gamba Studio and the ‘Sweet Peach’ label in the early 70’s – which included emerging artists such as Doug Ashdown, Kevin Johnson, Lee Conway and Fraternity.\n\nPhil’s only known personal studio recording is a single, released in 1971 on the Sweet Peach label, featuring Dylan’s ‘John Wesley Harding’ on side ‘A’ and Jerry Jeff Walker’s ‘Mr Bojangles’ on side ‘B’.\n\n?\n\nThis YouTube clip, added a couple of weeks ago under the ‘Australian Chart Entries 60’s and 70’s plus rarities’ logo, has since received 170 views and given its ‘rarity’ deserves a few more views.\n\nDylan recorded ‘John Wesley Harding’ (the song) in October/November 1967 and it was released on the December 1967 John Wesley Harding album.\n\nPhil’s cover of ‘John Wesley Harding’ was the 2nd cover ever to be recorded/released and one of only 9 known covers to date.\n\nDanny Ross\n\nDanny (born 1983) may be known to dedicated followers of ‘The Voice Australia’ TV talent show where he reached the finals in 2013.\n\nHe released his one & only studio album, As The Crow Flies, also in 2013. At track 3 he re-creates a ‘Hendrix-style’ version of Dylan’s ‘All Along The Watchtower’ – a song that he covered during the heats of ‘The Voice’.\n\n?\n\nThis YouTube clip is taken from Danny’s 2013 The Voice performance and has received an impressive 63,799 views in the past 11 years. His official YouTube clip of ‘All Along The Watchtower’ from his album has only received 268 views in the past 5 years.\n\nDylan recorded ‘All Along The Watchtower’ on 6 November 1967 in Nashville with acoustic guitar & harmonica, accompanied by Charlie McCoy on bass and Kenny Buttrey on drums. It was released on the 1967 John Wesley Harding album.\n\nIn September 1968, Jimi Hendrix unleashed his electrified version of ‘All Along The Watchtower’ and this became the standard by which the vast majority of the 200 subsequent cover songs are based – making it Dylan’s 7th most covered song.\n\nPaul Field\n\nPaul (born 1961) is known as a founding member of ‘The Cockroaches’ (1987 – 1994) and then as Managing Director of ‘The Wiggles’ (1996 – 2020).\n\nIn 2021 Paul embarked on a belated solo career and released his debut album Love Songs For Lonely People. The album includes two Dylan covers: track 7 ‘Tomorrow Is A Long Time’ and this articles chosen song, track 2 ‘You Ain’t Goin’ Nowhere’ (featuring Jimmy Barnes).\n\n?\n\nThis YouTube clip has received an impressive 12,182 views in the past 3 years and includes live footage of Jimmy warming up his vocal cords before launching into a duet with Paul.\n\nDylan wrote ‘You Ain’t Goin’ Nowhere’ while in self-imposed exile at Woodstock from mid-1966 to 1967 and recorded a version with The Band at the Big Pink house. That version was subsequently released on the 1975 Basement Tapes album. An alternate version, with different words and verses, was also recorded on 24 September 1971 with Happy Traum accompanying Dylan. This latter version was released on the November 1971 Bob Dylan’s Greatest Hits Vol. II album.\n\nPaul’s version of ‘You Ain’t Goin’ Nowhere’ lifted the number of verified covers of the song to 100, where it sits as the 18th most covered Dylan song. The 1st cover of the song to be released by an Australian artist/band was ‘The Flying Circus’ in August 1969 – but more about that in a future ‘Dylan covers’ article.\n\nCyrus – Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door 1974\n\nCyrus (born 1996) may be known to dedicated followers of ‘The X Factor Australia’ TV talent show, which he won in 2015.\n\nIn a similar story to Danny Ross (above), Cyrus released his one and only studio album Cryus in December 2015. The album featured studio recordings of selected songs Cyrus performed on ‘The X Factor’. At track 7, he performs Dylan’s ‘Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door’.\n\n?\n\nThis YouTube clip is taken from Cyrus’ 2015 The Voice performance. Collectively, clips of his The Voice performance have racked up over 30,000 views in the past 8 years. His official YouTube clip of ‘Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door’ from his album has also received over 10,000 views in the past 6 years.\n\nDylan wrote and recorded ‘Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door’ in early 1973 for the Sam Peckinpah movie ‘Pat Garrett & Billy The Kid’ – a movie in which Dylan also had a small acting role, playing a store owner named Alias. The movie soundtrack was released in July 1973.\n\nNot only was ‘Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door’ a worldwide top 10 hit for Dylan in 1973, it was also a worldwide top 10 hit for Guns ‘N Roses in 1991/2. This combination of different musical genres having chart success with the song propelled interest in a diversity of cover versions – such that with close to 250 cover versions to date, it is Dylan’s 4th most covered song.\n\nBrendan Gallagher\n\nBrendan may be known to some as he has been a member of several bands – Karma Country, The Leisuremasters, The Millionaires & Dead Marines. He has also produced over 20 albums, including Jimmy Little’s 1999 Aria Award winning Messenger album. In 1994, Brendan published ‘The Open Tuning Chord Book For Guitar’ – and received the following praise from David Bowie: “What a super book, this is such fun. I could use this for the next album.”\n\nBrendan has released six solo albums between 2006 – 2020. At track 11 on his self-released 2020 Restless Creatures album, Michael covers Dylan’s ‘Simple Twist Of Fate’.\n\n?\n\nThis YouTube clip has only received 65 views in the past 4 years – it is time to give that number a nudge.\n\nDylan recorded ‘Simple Twist Of Fate’ on 19 September 1974 and it was released on the January 1975 Blood On The Tracks album.\n\nThere have been around 55 cover versions of this song, with Brendan’s version being around the 45th to be released – followed very closely (i.e. 3mths 10 days later) by Emma Swift’s version on her Blonde On The Tracks album.\n\nChristopher Marshall\n\nChristopher may be known to some as the singer for Melbourne-based band Harem Scarem, who were active between 1982 – 89 and released 3 studio albums during that time. In 1998, Christopher released his one & only solo album Strange Waters, Small Mercies.\n\nIn 2019, Chriostopher released a compilation album, featuring early recordings Harem Scarem & his own songs. The album was titled The Dog Beneath The Skin (Rare & Unreleased) and at track 13 he covers Dylan’s ‘Every Grain Of Sand’.\n\n?\n\nThis YouTube clip has certainly been ‘under the radar’ and has only received 34 views over the past 2 years.\n\nDylan recorded ‘Every Grain Of Sand’ on 4 May 1981 and it was released on the August 1981 Shot Of Love album.\n\nThere have been over 40 verified covers of the song, however Christopher’s version is ‘so rare’ it is yet to be discovered and recognized as a verified cover by the ‘bible’ of cover songs – SecondHandSongs.\n\nHenry Wagons\n\nHenry is a singer/songwriter, musician, radio & TV personality and frontman of the Melbourne-based alt-country band, Wagons who have released eight albums between 2000 – 2019.\n\nHenry has also released three solo albums between 2012 – 2023. It was on his latest album South Of Everywhere that he covered Dylan’s ‘Everything Is Broken’.\n\n?\n\nThis YouTube clip has been viewed 259 times and certainly deserves a few more.\n\nDylan recorded ‘Everything Is Broken’ in mid-March 1989 and it was released on the September 1989 Oh Mercy’ album.\n\nHenry’s 2023 cover was the latest of the 34 versions of ‘Everything Is Broken’ released to date until Rory Block’s June 2024 version – on an album titled Positively 4th Street, that is entirely dedicated to Dylan covers, and includes the first ever covers of ‘Mother Of Muses’ and ‘Murder Most Foul’ from Dylan’s latest album, Rough & Rowdy Ways (2020).\n\nLuke Escombe\n\nLuke is a singer-songwriter who works in music, health, education and the arts. He is also the writer/creator of Australian children’s band The Vegetable Plot. Luke has taken his lived experience with a chronic health condition and converted it into award-winning art and activism.\n\nLuke has released five albums between 2008 – 2017. It was on his self-released fifth album Skeleton Blues that he covered Dylan’s ‘The Man In The Long Black Coat’.\n\n?\n\nFor an ‘under the radar’ artist, this YouTube clip has punched above its weight with almost 1,500 views.\n\nDylan recorded ‘The Man In The Long Black Coat’ in late March 1989 and it was released on the September 1989 Oh Mercy album.\n\nOf the 30 covers of ‘Man In The Long Black Coat’, Mark Lanegan’s version on the 2007 ‘I’m Not Here’ soundtrack would rank as one of the best.\n\nSteve Passfield\n\nSteve is a country-influenced singer/songwriter who put together his own band ‘Handpicked’ in 1988. The band put out a couple of albums in the late 1990’s.\n\nAs a solo artist, Steve self-released three albums between 2012 – 2019. On his debut The Soundtrack Of My Life album, he covered Dylan’s ‘Make You Feel My Love’.\n\n?\n\nThis YouTube clip is the least viewed of all those represented in this article – with only 8 views in the past year. Hopefully this plug will see views reach double figures.\n\nDylan recorded ‘Make You Feel My Love’ in January 1997 and it was released on the September 1997 Time Out Of Mind album.\n\nIt may come as a surprise, given Dylan’s extraordinary songwriting catalogue, that ‘Make You Feel My Love’ is the 3rd most covered Dylan song, with over 250 commercially available versions. The two singles released to promote the Time Out Of Mind album were ‘Not Dark Yet’ and ‘Love Sick’ and they have only garnered 40 and 10 cover versions respectively.\n\nEver since June 1963, when Peter, Paul & Mary popularised ‘Blowin’ In The Wind’, Dylan’s career has benefited greatly from other artists in a wide variety of genres covering his songs. Adele’s February 2008 cover of ‘Make You Feel My Love’ is a continuation of that tradition – a tradition that awaits further exploration in a future ‘Dylan covers’ article.\n\nMore from Karl Dubravs can be read Here.\n\nRead more stories from Almanac Music HERE\n\nIf you would like to receive the Almanac Music and Poetry newsletter we will add you to the list.
