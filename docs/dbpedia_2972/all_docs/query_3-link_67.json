        "text": "The king, his hips turned the blues to suede\n\nHe made black Okeh through a blue-eyed haze\n\nI love you, the girl shouts\n\nI can′t help, the king sings\n\nOh, no, no, the people cry\n\nOh, no, no\n\nBy then those hips, they were bloated and slow\n\nHe'd be gone in six weeks, they′d cry oh, no, no\n\nIt was the king's last stand, it was the king's last stand\n\nIt was the king′s last stand, it was the king′s last stand\n\nGood Robert, the prince of Camelot\n\nThe sad news he did proclaim\n\nOh, no, no, the people cried\n\nOh, no, no, the people they wailed\n\nOh, no, no, the people shouted\n\nOh, no, no. And the prince he said\n\nBrothers, my brothers, they shot our brothers\n\nCan this awful grace make us love one another?\n\nTell me, is this the king's last stand? Is this the king′s last stand?\n\nOh, no, no\n\nLyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
