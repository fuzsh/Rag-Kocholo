I’m into Iron Maiden, and I’m really interested in the history of war, and really, then Sabaton is the ultimate band for me!\n\nAnd it seems that I’m not alone. They released the new album “The Last Stand” August 19, and two weeks later it was the 6th most sold album IN THE WORLD!!\n\nAs a Swede, I think this is so fucking cool! I love the band they are amazing live, and I am confident that this new album will work amazing on the stage. But when I’m listening to the album, I have a hard time giving it more than a average 3.\n\nI love most of the songs, it is great music, and it’s Sabaton, you know. But I don’t like that fact that you have too much keyboards, taking over the songs. It’s drowning the guitars! Otherwise it would have been great! I mean, they actually have Jon Shaffer (Iced Earth) reading as an intro to the song “The Last Stand”! How cool is that??\n\nBut, it is actually a really cool and great album. Just listen to the song “The Lost Battalion”, where you really can hear the sound of the caterpillar band! Or the vibes of Deep Purple in “Blood of Bannockburn” – a song about the Scottish revolution!\n\nBut my favourite song really is “Winged Hussars“! Yes, I know, it could be a new version of the song “The Art of War”… But it’s a great piece of old school, and power metal song!\n\nWanna listen? First you have the Spotify-link to the album, and below, some nice videos!\n\n\\m/ Peps\n\nListen to the caterpillar bands!\n\nSparta:\n\nBlood of Bannockburn:"
