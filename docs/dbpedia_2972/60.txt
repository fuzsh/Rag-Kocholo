Swedish metal band Sabaton has released its 8th studio album, The Last Stand.

The band, featuring founding bassist Pär Sundström, is known for its focus on historical battles, which also defines the content on The Last Stand – one Sundström calls “a majestic record.”

Conflicts explored on the album include the Battle of Thermopylae (“Sparta”), the Battle of Bannockburn (“Blood of Bannockburn”) and the Battle of Shiroyama.
