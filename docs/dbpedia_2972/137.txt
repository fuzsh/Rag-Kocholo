Posted on by

With the announcement of Swedish heavy metal heroes SABATON returning to Ireland with non other than German Metal icons, ACCEPT, the band are about to release release their brand-new, 8th studio album, ‘The Last Stand’ on August 19th via Nuclear Blast prior to the forthcoming tour. Today, the band have revealed the second album trailer, which you can see below.

The bands forthcoming studio album, The Last Stand has already spawned a single two weeks ago entitled ‘The Lost Battalion’. The story behind the track is based on the name given to nine companies of the United States’ 77th Division during the battle of the Argonne in 1918. Even though these 550-575 brave men were completely surrounded by the German Army and subjected to friendly artillery fire, they kept on fighting for a week until they were relieved. Of the over 500-plus soldiers who entered the Argonne Forest, only 194 walked out unscathed. The rest were killed, missing, captured, or wounded.

Today, the band have revealed the second album trailer. Watch it below.
