The official video for "The Last Stand", the title track of SABATON's eighth album, can be seen below. The clip features footage shot during "The Last Tour"

"The Last Stand" was released in August 2016 via Nuclear Blast. The follow-up to 2014's "Heroes" was once again produced by Peter Tägtgren (PAIN, LINDEMANN, HYPOCRISY).

The artwork for "The Last Stand" was created by Peter Sallaí, who has worked with SABATON since "Carolus Rex".

SABATON will kick off a North American co-headlining tour with German thrash veterans KREATOR on February 8 in Phoenix, Arizona. Opening the trek will be CYHRA, the new band featuring vocalist Jake E (ex-AMARANTHE),guitarist Jesper Strömblad (ex-IN FLAMES),guitarist Euge Valovirta (ex-SHINING),bassist Peter Iwers (ex-IN FLAMES) and drummer Alex Landenburg (LUCA TURILLI'S RHAPSODY).

SABATON bassist Pär Sundström told Sticks For Stones in a recent interview that the band will not "do that much touring" in 2018. "We have been touring extensively the last years, and we did a lot in 2017 and 2016," he said. "In 2018, we need to focus on a new album. We have to take a little bit of time off from touring and focus on a new album. It's difficult to keep up the songwriting cycle that you used to have when you're touring more than ever, so we will have to take a little bit of a break in touring to make a new album."
