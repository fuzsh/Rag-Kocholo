        "text": "The Hackesche Höfe remain true to themselves, while their neighborhood continues to change its face. Within walking distance of the courtyards on Oranienburger Straße, two new urban districts were opened in 2023. Besides the Tacheles neighborhood, the \"Forum an der Museumsinsel,\" as the developers call it, has finally been completed – after almost twenty years of planning and restoration. The gigantic urban repair project comprises a large piece of Berlin in the most prominent location between Oranienburger Straße, Monbijou Park and Museum Island.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, this was the location of the capital's communications center, the main telegraph office and the telephone exchange. Charité hospital buildings were located in the southern section facing the Spree. The eight listed buildings span different stylistic periods from classicism to expressionism and Bauhaus modernism. A detour is worthwhile – for example after a visit to the Hackesche Höfe.\n\nPhotos above and right: the central square of the forum\n\nall photos: © Forum Museumsinsel GmbH & Co.KG\n\nA previously closed block now opens up to the neighborhood. Opposite the synagogue, a newly built gatehouse leads from Oranienburger Straße to a new town square, the center of the ensemble. A large screen in one of the gateways provides information about the history of the individual buildings. The square is dominated by the historic \"Dieselhaus.\" The \"Diesel\" restaurant has established itself there on two spacious floors. Bavarian beer and down-to-earth cuisine are served here in an industrial ambience. Speciality of the house: Guests can tap their own beer from a wooden keg at the table.\n\nIn the past, the Dieselhaus housed a gigantic diesel-powered emergency generator, which was intended to ensure the electricity supply to the telecommunications center in the event of a power failure. Today, the impressive machine dominates the restaurant's dining room, carefully cleaned and polished. In summer, you can sit in the beer garden outside on the square - more protected from traffic noise than almost anywhere else in Mitte. Two cafés are open on the square during the day, but there are no retail outlets. On a visit to the square on a winter evening, it still looks rather lifeless. In the first winter, there is still no sign of the ice rink planned by the development company.\n\nPhoto left: the former diesel-powered generator in the restaurant ”Diesel”\n\nThe largest building in the Forum is that of the city's former main telegraph office. It was built between 1910 and 1916 in neo-baroque style. It was the largest of its kind in Europe and the center of what was then a pioneering communications network. Up to 20,000 telegrams were sent from here every day. Berlin's pneumatic tube center was located in the basement of the building: Messages and objects were transported by compressed air in cylindrical containers to around 100 stations. The Berlin pneumatic tube network stretched up to 400 kilometers. The pneumatic tube system was in operation until 1976. In order to fulfill monument protection requirements, the building owners had to preserve the pneumatic dispatch system. Unfortunately, it cannot be viewed in its entirety. A side wing of the former telegraph office has been converted into modern office space used by IT companies.\n\nThe \"Lodge House\" adjoins the telegraph office on Oranienburger Straße. It is the oldest building in the area. Built in 1789, it is an outstanding example of classicism in Berlin. The headquarters of the \"Grand Lodge of Freemasonry of Germany\" was equipped with representative meeting rooms and is considered the oldest surviving house of the order in Germany. In 1898, the Reichspost acquired the building and used it for parcel delivery, among other things. Following restoration, the building is now used for offices.\n\nTHE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE\n\nThe former telephone exchange on Tucholskystraße impresses with its expressionist clinker brick façade. It was built between 1926 and 1927 within a very short space of time. Due to the increasing demand for telephone connections, a new telephone exchange was urgently needed in Berlin. After the Second World War, the telephone exchange was extended to include the Institute for Post and Telecommunications of the GDR, which has since formed the corner building facing Oranienburger Straße. The building is used in its entirety by the company Delivery Hero.\n\nPhoto left: the former telephone exchange of the city\n\nAt the beginning of the 1930s, the women's clinic of the Charité was built on Ziegelstraße in an elongated, slender building in the style of Bauhaus modernism. At the time, a wind-sheltered ward on the flat roof caused quite a stir. The round building facing the Spree is characteristic. It housed a gymnastics hall with a spectacular view of Museum Island, the Rotes Rathaus and Alexanderplatz. This building, known as \"Das Bauhaus\", was also remodeled by David Chipperfield. The main tenant is an advertising agency, while apartments are located on the upper floors.\n\nFinally, the Forum also includes two smart city palaces from the beginning of the 20th century. Today, wealthy people can enjoy a unique residential location right next to the Spree and Museum Island. The neo-baroque \"Monbijou\" on the street of the same name became part of the women's clinic 20 years after it was built. The neo-classical \"Simon Palais\" is located on the Spree promenade opposite the Bodemuseum. The Ida Simon Foundation built this palace in 1911 as an infirmary for needy women and girls. Here, at least, \"ordinary mortals\" can also enjoy the exclusive location: There is a café on the ground floor that serves excellent cakes. In summer, there is hardly a more beautiful place in Berlin to enjoy a coffee than outside in front of the Palais.\n\nPhoto below left: Simon Palais, right: Palais Monbijou"
