        "text": "Mediterranean Dining in the Heart of Berlin Mitte at Night Kitchen\n\nNight Kitchen is a renowned dining destination located in the heart of Berlin, Mitte. The restaurant is known for its unique blend of contemporary Mediterranean cuisine with a personal touch of love, making it a must-try dining experience for both locals and tourists alike. It is situated in a picturesque old stable-house off the famous Oranienburger Straße, adding to the unique ambiance and charm of the place.\n\nThe restaurant is one of our absolute favorites! We go there for special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, milestones, or when we have friends and family visiting. It’s never a bad time and the menu is always changing, while some of our favorite dishes are always on there–like the freshly-baked challah bread, served with a tahini sauce for dipping. And of course, don’t miss out on the homemade liqueurs that are passing by the table often!\n\nWe suggest that you choose the “Dinner With Friends” menu. They will ask you if you have any allergies or dietary restrictions and then let the courses start flowing. You’ll be treated to as many dishes as you can handle. Fresh and delicious veggies, perfectly-cooked meats, and delectable desserts will fill your bellies, while the buzzing location provides the perfect backdrop for your special night out!\n\nWe highly recommend that you make a reservation because they are almost always full. We don’t want you to be disappointed, so plan ahead and get a table!\n\nIf you’re looking for an exquisite dining experience with a blend of modern Mediterranean cuisine, a charming location, and exceptional service, Night Kitchen is our top choice in Mitte. Whether you’re a local or a tourist, this restaurant is certainly worth a visit when in Berlin.\n\nHave you visited Night Kitchen already? Want to know more about Berlin’s history and culinary gems? Come take a tour with us at Walk With Us Tours! We’re waiting for you.\n\nNight Kitchen\n\nHeckmann Höfe, Oranienburger Str. 32, 10115 Berlin\n\nThe Permanent Exhibition Berlin Global at Humboldt Forum\n\nThe German Historical Museum, the DDR Museum, the Stasi Museum, or should you check out another one of the many great museums and exhibitions in Berlin? Which one is the best to choose if you’re only in Berlin for a few days and you have to squeeze in some history and culture, besides Techno, beer, and/or Döner Kebab?\n\nWith the overwhelming abundance of informative museums and incredible exhibitions that one can find in Berlin, it is sometimes not easy to decide which one to focus on. Also, it depends on what your specific interests are.\n\nNevertheless, we from Walk With Us Tours would like to make the decision a little easier and recommend one of our favorite exhibitions about the history and culture of Berlin to you, our dear friends.\n\nBerlin Global Exhibition at Humboldt Forum\n\nThe permanent exhibition Berlin Global at the Humboldt Forum combines all things Berlin in a well-curated manner.\n\nHumboldt Forum is part of the renovated, historical Berlin Palace named after the trail-blazing Prussian explorers and scientists Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt. The Palace itself used to be the residence of the Prussian monarchy, ruled for a long time by the Hohenzollern dynasty. And, like the city of Berlin in general, the Berlin Palace was going through some transformations.\n\nOn November 9th, 1918, the Berlin Palace became the scene for the revolutionary transition of the German/Prussian monarchy to a parliamentary-democratic republic with a liberal constitution. An important historical event known as the November Revolution. Out of a big window of the Palace, the leader of the Marxist Spartacus League Karl Liebknecht proclaimed the “Free Socialist Republic”. Unfortunately, this act more or less became his death sentence.\n\nToday it is the place where visitors can indulge in their passion for the capricious history and (sub)-culture of Berlin and learn a lot.\n\nIn our opinion, Berlin Global is worth a visit for several reasons. First, it is an interactive, artsy and immersive exhibition where the guests co-create the actual experience and where you are not just bombarded with a bunch of historical information. This approach makes it quite different from other exhibitions or museums in the city. Second, the exhibition gives you a thorough and nuanced understanding of Berlin’s past, present, and future. The most important historical events of Germany’s and Berlin’s history are explained and it also reflects on topics like colonialism and post-colonialism while at the same time linking the given information to the actual space the exhibition takes place in, the Berlin Palace.\n\nAdditionally, the exhibition accurately portrays characteristic sub- and countercultural movements of Berlin: the squatter scene of the 80s and early 90s, the current struggle for leftist house projects like Rigaer 94, and many more. You will even be able to see the original door of the old Tresor Club at Leipziger Straße; for those interested in one of the most notorious subcultures of Berlin: the Techno and House music scene.\n\nWe recommend getting tickets for the Berlin Global exhibition in advance and booking a time slot on their website. The tickets cost 7 Euros per person. The closest public transport station is the U-Bahn station Rotes Rathaus. You could also have a nice little walk from the station Alexanderplatz.\n\nIf you want to know more about the tumultuous history of Berlin, and/or want to get more insider tips and recommendations for your stay here, all while eating your way through the hidden streets of our beloved Berlin, join us on one of our Food and Walking Tours.\n\nIf you need more info, just get in touch. We would love to hear from you!\n\nAuf bald!\n\nBerlin Global at Humboldt Forum\n\nSchloßplatz, 10178 Berlin\n\nThe Best Vegetarian and Vegan Dumplings in Berlin: Momos — Organic Veggie Dumplings\n\nYou can find the craft of making dumplings in numerous culinary cultures throughout the world. “Maultaschen” in Germany, “Pierogi“ in Poland, “Pelmeni” in Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union, “Gyoza“ in Japan, “Wan Tan“ from China or “Khinkali” in Georgia— to name but a few.\n\nThere must be a universal and transcultural, human desire to wrap up delicious, local ingredients in a layer of dough and steam, fry, boil or bake these little rascals. Simply one of our favorite things in the world in all its shapes and forms.\n\nWhere to find the Best Veggie and Vegan Dumplings in Berlin?\n\nAs one of the most multicultural hubs in Europe and one of the vegan and vegetarian capital of the world, Berlin offers a wide array of tasty vegetarian and vegan dumplings from all corners of the globe.\n\n(To find out more about the vegan food scene and the long-standing multiculturalism of the German capital, join our Vegan Food Tour!)\n\nTo make the search a little bit easier for you, today, we would like to recommend one of our absolute favorite spots for vegan and veggie dumplings in town: Momos — organic veggie dumplings in Berlin-Mitte.\n\nDumplings from the Himalaya Region in a Sustainable Way\n\nInspired by the travels of the owner Marc Thomas and located on the bustling Chausseestraße in the heart of Berlin – Mitte, the shop convinces with a simple but well-executed concept. They exclusively serve one main thing: the famous, mouthwatering dumplings from the Himalayan region called momos. You do not need anything else, to be honest. Get them fried, steamed, or even served in a delicious, hearty broth as a soup – one definitely cannot go wrong there.\n\nThe aspects of quality and sustainability are core elements of the shop’s philosophy. All used ingredients are 100% certified organic and you will taste the love for the food and the planet.\n\nOpened in 2013, Momos —organic veggie dumplings, is an institution in the vibrant and colorful food scene of Mitte, and the dumplings are as colorful as the people living there.\n\nWe recommend going there for their lunch special (closed on Sundays) from 12:00 to 16:00. Enjoy their tasty lunch menus where you can get 14 handmade dumplings and one dip of your choice (the spicy tomato is our favorite) priced at only 8,90€.\n\nChoose between Cheesus Christ, Veggie Venture, or Mushroom Magic (these are the names of their lunch menus), or indulge in their Dumpling Soup Special for 9,50€.\n\nDevour these little, flavourful rascals together with a refreshing, Berliner soft drink or a cider made by Ostmost. Sit outside (if the weather allows it) to watch the people passing by staring at your beautiful dumplings and wishing to be you.\n\nIf you want to know more about the hidden culinary gems or other things to do in Berlin, check out Walk With Us Tours Travel Guides or come on one of our Food and Walking Tours!
