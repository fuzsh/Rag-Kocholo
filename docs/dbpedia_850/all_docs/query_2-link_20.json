        "text": "How to reach the BCCN Berlin\n\nMap of the Area\n\nBy plane\n\nFrom airport BER:\n\nThere are several connections from/to the airport BER to/from S Friedrichstr or Berlin Main Station (Hauptbahnhof). Please use the information of the public transportation system to find your most convenient connection:\n\nhttps://sbahn.berlin/en/plan-a-journey/\n\nTraveling time: about 1 hour.\n\nBy train\n\nFrom Berlin main station (Hauptbahnhof):\n\nTake the north exit. You can take bus 147 (direction S-Unter-den-Linden/Glinkastr or Puschkinallee/Elsenstr.) to Charité-Campus-Mitte, bus 123 (direction Robert-Koch-Platz) to Robert-Koch-Platz, bus 120 (direction Hainbuchenstr.) or 245 (direction S-Nordbahnhof) to Invalidenpark. When you get out of the bus head for Luisenstr. and follow the instruction for gate D. You can also walk directly to the institute: at the main station take the North exit and walk East along Invalidenstr. After the bridge take the third right (Hessische Str.). The third street to the right is Philippstr.\n\nTraveling time: about 10-20 minutes.\n\nFrom Berlin Zoologischer Garten:\n\nTake any eastbound subway (S5, S7, S75, S9) to Friedrichstr. station. From there you can either walk directly to the institute (10 minutes) and follow the instruction for gate C or take the subway U6 (direction Alt-Tegel) to U-Oranienburger-Tor (one stop) and follow the instruction to gate B.\n\nTraveling time: about 20 minutes.\n\nFrom Berlin Ostbahnhof:\n\nTake any westbound subway (S5, S7, S75, S9) to Friedrichstr. station. From there you can either walk directly to the institute (10 minutes) and follow the instruction for gate C or take the subway U6 (direction Alt-Tegel) to U-Oranienburger-Tor (one stop) follow the instruction to gate B.\n\nTraveling time: about 15 minutes.\n\nBy public transportation within Berlin\n\nThe nearest stations are:\n\nSubway:\n\nU-Oranienburger-Tor (U6) → gate B\n\nFriedrichstr. (S1, S2, S5, S7, S75, S9, U6) → gate B\n\nTram:\n\nTorstr./U-Oranienburger-Tor (12) → gate B\n\nU-Oranienburger-Tor (M1) → gate B\n\nBus:\n\nRobert-Koch-Platz (240, 123) → gate A\n\nCharité-Campus-Mitte (147) → gate D\n\nInvalidenpark (120, 245) → gate D\n\nOnline schedule\n\nTickets for public transportation\n\nThe ticket for public transportation in Berlin is valid for subway, tram, bus, and even ferries. The institute is located in the fare zone A. The Berlin city is almost completely comprised in the price zones A and B. The most notable exception is the airport BER, which is located in the fare zone C.\n\nDepending on how long you plan to stay in Berlin and use public transportation, you can buy a single ticket (Einzelfahrschein Berlin AB), a day pass (Tageskarte Berlin AB), which is valid until 3 AM of the following day, or a 7-day pass (7-Tage-Karte VBB-Umweltkarte Berlin AB).\n\nYou can find tickets for public transportation at the vending machines in every subway station: you can pay with coins, notes, and credit cards. Vending machines are also located on every tram..\n\nRemember to validate your ticket in the red (S subway) or yellow (U subway) machines located on the platform, if necessary. You should also validate your ticket as soon as you get in to a tram or show it to the driver on a bus.\n\nWalking directions from the nearest stations\n\nThe campus where the institute is located has four entrances, the main one (A on the map) on Phillipstr. 13, where a gatekeeper is always present, two gates (B and C on the map) on the south side of the campus, and one gate (D on the map) on the west side of the campus.\n\nGate A can be reached by foot from the nearby bus stops walking along the Hannoversche Str. Once you are inside the campus walk along the paved walkway to the BCCN building (Haus 6).\n\nGate B is located near the subway and tram station U-Oranienburger-Tor: take the Claire-Waldoff-Str. (a westbound small street crossing Friedrichstr.) and walk until you reach the building “Haus der Land- und Ernährungswirtschaft”, the gate is on the walkway on the right. Once you are inside the campus walk along the paved walkway, cross the small park and head to the BCCN building (Haus 6).\n\nGate C is located on the right of the old bunker building on Reinhardtstr. 20. If you walk from station Friedrichstr., you may cross the river with the bridge under the railways, and walk along the Albrechstr. until you cross the Reinhardtstr. Once you are inside the campus walk along the sewer, cross the small park and head to the BCCN building (Haus 6)."
