        "text": "Dear Alon,\n\nit’s me who wrote the article on the blog „Zukunft Mobilität“ whose webmaster has informed me about your post. Nice to see the proposal of S21 South East also being proposed and discussed here! I have some comments to your article and the discussion:\n\n> Since reunification, Germany has made an effort to move the Berlin central business district back to the historic center, and S21 is to reinforce that, serving the western end of Mitte.\n\nHauptbahnhof [Central Station] and Potsdamer Platz are actually located on the historic city borders during 18th century and until now haven‘t become a real CBD yet as they are more popular among tourists than among normal residents. Between the two stations there are a lot of governmental and parliamentary institutions which also don’t cause much demand as an S-Bahn station at Bundestag will not be built. North of Hauptbahnhof, the new Europacity quarter is being developed now, but a station at Perleberger Brücke won’t be opened in the first phase and would be quite complicated because of the two curves. Gleisdreieck is an interchange station in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by railway areas and a new park. Most long-distance trains also stop at Südkreuz and some also at Gesundbrunnenwhich are both already connected to the existing Nordsüdbahn.\n\n> The new four-track line has ample capacity for additional S-Bahn traffic, but nonetheless it hosts no S-Bahn trains in regular service.\n\nThe reason is simple: Mainline tracks are electrified with 15 kV 16,7 Hz AC and S-Bahn tracks with 750 V DC. There were unofficial proposals for express S-Bahn services operated with AC on the mainline tracks (see e.g. http://www.sx-bahn.de) or even hybrid systems changing to DC to continue on suburban tracks, but such a service with special branding and dense intervals hasn’t been introduced yet. However, there were temporary shuttle services with Western German S-Bahn trains (AC) during FIFA World Cup 2006 as well as 2009/2010 during the major service restrictions of Berlin S-Bahn (DC).\n\n> The segment from Hauptbahnhof to Potsdamer Platz, which contrary to the map is to be nonstop, is in early stages of construction, and Wikipedia says it is expected to open in 2023.\n\n2023 is not realistic, as the construction around Bundestag [German parliament] is very complicated, so that actually one tunnel will pass in front and the other tunnel will pass in the back of the building.\n\n> Farther south of Potsdamer Platz is still not under construction, and frankly should not be built as is.\n\nAs you also write later, there is actually nothing to say against a new section via Gleisdreieck. After the third phase is built, the southeastern extension of S21 could just take over the tunnel to Anhalter Bahnhof station which wouldn’t be used for trains toward the south anymore. Apart from this branch the only tunnel which would have to be adapted is the junction north of Potsdamer Platz where the tracks from/to Hauptbahnhof would become the tracks from/to Gesundbrunnen and vice versa.\n\n> It specifically criticizes S21 for duplicating existing infrastructure, and proposes an extension to the southeast, mentioning that there were plans to that effect in the 1930s.\n\nAs far as I know, the plans for the 1930s included an S-Bahn connection between the former long-distance terminal stations Görlitzer Bahnhof and Anhalter Bahnhof as well as a branch to Potsdamer Platz (that’s why the S-Bahn stations Anhalter Bahnhof and Potsdamer Platz were built with 4 tracks), but not further northwest towards the long-distance Lehrter Bahnhof and Hamburger Bahnhof located next to the current Hauptbahnhof (see e.g. de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ost-West-S-Bahn).\n\n> The dashed lines denote under-construction lines, including S21 to Potsdamer Platz, the 4.5-kilometer Siemens Railway to the northwest, and the U5-U55 connection.\n\nSiemens Railway is not yet under construction, but will probably be reopened in a few years as part of a deal with the company Siemens, which used to have its headquarter in Siemensstadt before World War II and plans to revive the quarter as a new city research campus and residential area.\n\n> Two branches are depicted toward Tegel, one toward airport grounds to be redeveloped, and one going farther north taking over S25; there are already discussions of a rapid transit line to Tegel, branching off of U6, but this option does not force the outer parts of U6 to contend with reduced frequency.\n\nConnecting S25 to the new instead of the old North-South tunnel is problematic as it would mean that the Alt-Reinickendorf and Karl-Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik (interchange with U8 e.g. to Alexanderplatz!) would have to be closed. Instead, this line will get a second track to allow 10-minute headway to Tegel and perhaps even regional railways to the Prignitz. To avoid confusion: The existing of U6 goes to Alt-Tegel in the existing quarter of Tegel, the branch would go to the area of the current Tegel Airport.\n\n> All reverse-branching would cease: the various branches on the Görlitz Railway, including the existing ones as well as an under-construction one to the airport-to-be, would feed into the S-Bahn trunk, rather than to the Ring or the Stadtbahn. The removal of S25 from the North-South Tunnel would create space for the S8 and S85 services in Pankow to use the North-South Tunnel instead of diverting to the Ring and Görlitz Railway.\n\nIntroducing S8 and S85 into the Nordsüdbahn would simplify operations but might cause protests among passengers which are used to have a connection to the eastern Ring railway since the construction of the Berlin Wall when this curve (called after the then Eastern German head of state Ulbricht) was build to connect the northeastern branches with the remaining East Berlin S-Bahn network as the North – South tunnel was part of the West Berlin S-Bahn network, so it should be left open as a branch of the Ring railway at least to Pankow, but ideally to the existing S8 along the Outer Ring railway, as a tram-train like on the Grande Ceinture in Paris sounds like a drawback.\n\n> It also has a peculiarity in that S75 trains only run east of Ostbahnhof; I can’t tell if there’s a problem with track capacity or demand mismatch, but if it’s the former then it’s strange since peak S-Bahn traffic on the Stadtbahn is only 18 trains per hour (Munich achieves 30 through its central tunnel, with much higher crowding levels), and if it’s the latter then it’s again strange – why not run through to Westkreuz like S5?\n\nI agree that there would be free capacity as there are gaps of up to 4-5 minutes in the timetable. However, this capacity could also be used by every other S3 train also ending at Ostbahnhof. An explanation why S75 is selected to always start at Ostbahnhof is that there is also the more frequent and (geographically) more direct tram line M4 from Alexanderplatz to Hohenschönhausen. Indeed, the Munich S-Bahn trunk route has a higher capacity because of automatic train operation using a German system called LZB (Linienzugbeeinflussung).\n\n> S21 is another of these little mistakes. It’s a prestige project on the heels of the construction of Hauptbahnhof, rather than a solution to a transportation need. There are six north-south tracks through Berlin between the S-Bahn and the mainline and they’re not anywhere near capacity; the mind boggles at why anyone would add seventh and eighth tracks before adding fifth and sixth east-west tracks.\n\nYou didn‘t even mention the major bottleneck resulting from the triangle between Hauptbahnhof, Westhafen and Wedding. Note that that all three stations don’t have a third track which could be used if two trains from different directions to the same direction enter the station at the same time and a similar problem could also arise when S15 changes between the Ring and the North-South railways at Gesundbrunnen. Even worse, Wedding and Westhafen are located on the Ring railway, which has a highly critical stability anyway. In the first phase, there will only be a reduced shuttle service from Gesundbrunnen to a temporary terminus at Hauptbahnhof, and even later the lines serving the S21 will only have unattractive intervals of 20 minutes each. Furthermore, unless the third phase via Gleisdreieck is open, the bottleneck at Anhalter Bahnhof means that there is no additional capacity compared to the old North-South tunnel.\n\n> Zukunft-Mobilität does have the U5 extension, I’m just skeptical about it for the following reasons:\n\n– There’s a big mismatch of demand from the east and west, so it’s fine to have some lines that only go center-to-east and don’t run through.\n\n– The U5 extension would be exclusively about Moabit, since everything else gets equivalent S-Bahn service under S21.\n\n– There’s no real point in keeping Tegel open – BER for all its faults is going to have faster trips to the center what with all the money that’s being wasted on direct rail connections. As soon as BER opens, the highest and best use for the area is housing and mixed-use development, and not an airport.\n\nU5 has some benefits as it would provide a fast and reliable connection from Jungfernheide (interchange to U7 at the same level!) and Turmstraße in Moabit to Hauptbahnhof, Brandenburger Tour Unter den Linden and the even more important public transport hub Alexanderplatz. The good cost-benefit ratio which was calculated for the U5 extension included the section to Turmstraße! However, due to the parallel construction of S21 as well as tram M10 to Turmstraße it has been postponed indefinitely by the city government and I agree that it shouldn‘t have highest priority. Unforunately the current plans for the Tegel area don’t envisage real mixed-use development, as housing is mainly restricted to the eastern border next to the existing U6, while the central parts around the old terminal would be used for industry and higher education, so the trains on the new U6 branch would be empty at the weekend.\n\n> What you say about a line headed northeast is absolutely true, though; it could link with U3, and then U1 would have its 5-minute frequency restored west of Wittenbergplatz, which would interact well with plans to extend U1 west to Adenauerplatz. But figuring out a trunk route through the center is annoying. There’s a pretty direct route going under Leipziger Strasse, but that’s a street that’s so central that both the Stadtbahn and U2 avoided it to avoid street-level disruption. Then again, U5 is going under Unter den Linden so clearly there is recent precedent for this…\n\nThe reason why U2 doesn’t have a straight alignment along Leipziger Straße is that the private tramway companies opposed it 100 years ago! In the meanwhile, the trams were abandoned, but now the city government wants to reintroduce them, although they will probably often be stuck in the frequent traffic jams on Leipziger Straße. During the construction of the mainline North-South tunnel, a metro station for a future U3/U10 was built at Potsdamer Platz, but this will be used neither for the metro nor for an underground tram in the near future. Instead of a separate route for U3, I could even imagine U2 and U3 sharing tracks between Wittenbergplatz and Nollendorfplatz, but this would be close to capacity, so that automation would probably be required for a stable service.\n\n> It’s a gap, but what likely journeys does closing that gap enable? Freie Universität to Wannsee? Demand is inbound from both of these stops.\n\nAn extension of the U3 to Mexikoplatz would make more sense combined with an extension of the S1 to Potsdam, because journeys from Dahlem to Potsdam would then be possible with just one interchange compared to 3-4 interchanges now, with benefits particularly for students studying either at Freie Universität in Dahlem or at Universität Potsdam and living at the other place, respectively. Perhaps also some passengers from U3 to Zehlendorf district center would change to S1 at Mexikoplatz instead of the buses at Oskar-Helene-Heim.\n\n> If Spindlersfeld isn’t cut from the mainline then a fourth northern branch could go east to Gesundbrunnen as is planned for S15.\n\nI think that such a branch would hardly have advantages compared to the existing Nordsüdbahn and that the disadvantages of the mixed operation with the Ringbahn overweigh.\n\n> What do you do with Köllnische Heide? It’s a useful enough connection in the network. You could run the Ringbahn as a teacup-line to Spindlersfeld, like London’s Circle line, but there’s nowhere to turn trains at Neukölln. > Under the southern option, it still gets served, it just loses its through-service to Neukölln. Under the northern one, it may be reduced to a shuttle.\n\nConversely, with the southern option, the northern connection via Plänterwald could still be used by S9 running on its own tracks from Warschauer Straße via Treptower Park and Baumschulenweg to BER in order to retain a connection of the Stadtbahn east-west line with the Adlershof science campus of Humboldt University, which has its main campus along Stadtbahn, and the new airport, although this would contradict with the aim to use the capacity on the Stadtbahn for other lines. I slightly prefer to keep the S21 network connected to the Ring network at Westhafen/Wedding as well as Neukölln/Treptower Park and just separate it from the Stadtbahn and Nordsüdbahn.\n\nI‘ve seen that you’re also a mathematician interested in public transport and now also living in Berlin!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nFelix"
