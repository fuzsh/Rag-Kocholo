        "text": "A street block of surviving Gründerzeit (Historicism) style buildings in central Berlin. This is the Friedrichstrasse at the crossing with Oranienburger Strasse (left) and at the Oranienburger Tor underground station. We can see amongst others the Berlin Apotheke (pharmacy), the Babalu bar and the Oscar Wilde Irish Pub. The area is about to undergo further changes though. Right of the building in need of rehabilitation (Oscar Wilde pub) there was once one entrance to the Friedrichstraßenpassage, a large shopping house opened in 1909 that connected to the Oranienburger Strasse – one of Berlins most prestigious passage buildings. Only one block, the entrance at Oranienburger Strasse, remained and was turned into the Tacheles Kunsthaus by artists from 1990 to 2012. In the coming years, however, the whole area which is larger than the former building and includes the Tacheles will be redevolped. More street block views of the Friedrichstraße can be found inside our archive."
