Master-Arbeit vorgelegt im Wintersemester 2010 an der Bauhaus-Universität Weimar at the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar, Fakultät Architektur Master thesis submitted during winter semester 2010 an der Bauhaus-Universität Weimar at the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar, Fakultät Architektur Faculty of Architecture Studiengang Europäische Urbanistik Study course European Urban Studies Verfasser: Dipl. Ing. Angelos Loupis Author: Dipl. Ing. Angelos Loupis Gutachter: Examiners: Erstgutachter: Prof. Max Welch Guerra 1st examiner: Prof. Max Welch Guerra Zweitgutachter: Dr. Harald Kegler 2nd examiner: Dr. Harald Kegler Athen, 10/11/2010 The history of the city follows man’s history step by step, its role changing throughout the production process. Nevertheless, the city’s primary role, or even better the need that has created it, still remains the same: the fulfillment of the productive activities and also the imposed symbiosis resulting out of this fulfillment. Urban planning moves throughout history as a superstructure depending on the socio-economic system of every era and there is the dialectic connection in between. Nowadays there are many theories which try to explain the socio- economic system. Liberal economy, neolliberal, capitalist, imperialistic, post capitalist, post communist in some occasions. Firstly there will be the categorization of the caracteristics on the social level. Demographic developments, social changes through statistics will be used as a basis for this. Afterwards it will be followed one of these models as the main one to continue, capitalist and imperialistic way of production. This process of dualism and inner change of the socio-economic system could help the analysis on the urban level and also it summirise more or less the other models. Then the research will proceed to the urban level. As today, we live in a society with a capitalistic way of production development. In Germany, however, during the last century, we have entered the highest of its levels, imperialism. This research will thus examine on a theoretical basis and along with examples from the city of Berlin the particular – new elements in urban planning which result from the modern capitalistic market system. According to the previous categorization of the socio- economic factors, there will be the categorization and the description of the results – connection on the urban level in general and with examples in Berlin. Projects, urban plannings on behalf of the city, of the Land, of the Bundesland, IBA, the differentiation of uses, functions, aesthetic. Density of buildings, changes on principals, strategies on urban planning, architecture expressed with various ways as conferences, of analysing the ‘procedure’ on urbanity through the years wiil be used as data for this part of the research. The hypothesis is if there is indead a relation of socio- economic level and urban planning, also if this approach according to this model on socio- economic level exist on the urban level and what is more the of the connection, what influence what. Also what are the factors that specify this relationship. As conclusions the findings could help to identify and analyse problems on urban planning better and more clear and accurate, finding the real and fundamental factors that produce these problems. This could help tp develop solutions in the reality and more precise, and that would solve the problem and not only its surface, a part of it. Accordind to the firsts preoccupations, Germany is in the imperialistic stage of way of production, according to this theory there are various levels for the states, countries to be, such as ones which are on the top, such as Germany, in the middle and completely dependent ones. Producing as additional research to other countries, through the cities and comparing the results, the relationship of urban planning and social level, we could go much deeper to understanding the problems of urban planning and findings better solutions. By that way similar approaches in the City of Athens and in the City of Erfurt in Germany in another researches could be compared. The research in Erfurt has been made under the analysis of another socio-economic system, socialism.\n\n‘Germany is full of ghosts’, and Berlin in particular is a city constructed by layers of history and memory. As the city that shows most deeply the scars of the twentieth century, Berlin has struggled to re-create an architectural identity post-1945. The recently started replica-rebuilding of the Palace (raised to the ground by the Soviets in 1950) is just one example of the unusual approaches the city has taken. Concepts of authenticity and purpose are questioned in creating a palace for a country without a monarch. The opening of the Berlin Wall Memorial, with its reconstructed death zone also shows an attitude to the past that is caught somewhere between museum and Disneyland architecture; local residents are confronted once again with overlooking the Wall. At a time when West Berlin was removed from maps of East Germany, there were mass clearances of nineteenth century tenement blocks in favour of sixties satellite housing estates that made a complete break with history. In the late 1960s, history was once again promoted, partially in extremes – for example, in the reconstruction of the medieval town centre at Nikolaiviertel. The discord between urban planners and local residents is exemplified in Berlin. The city’s urban landscape is layered with multiple histories and memories and the debate regarding how to deal with this past is constant. This paper intends to investigate some of the approaches to urban space, which have focused on one element of Berlin’s past, in order to construct a particular urban narrative."
