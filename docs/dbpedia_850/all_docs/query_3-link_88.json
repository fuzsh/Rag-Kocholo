        "text": "David Chipperfield House, Germany\n\nFrom series “Extravagant houses and apartments of designers”\n\nThe architect David Chipperfield House is located in the Mitte historic district of Berlin. This Art Nouveau house impresses with the sophistication and simplicity of its surroundings. Complex design solutions and bright elements are almost absent in it. Plastered walls, stone floors, strict wooden furniture, and the absolute predominance of light shades â this is the atmosphere that opens up to visitors of this house. It is worth noting several pieces of furniture from the middle of the last century among the special design elements.\n\nThere are quite a few of the brightest objects in the interior. A velvet sofa in a rich emerald color is one of them. There is also an unusual orange-colored bookcase in the house. The interior of the house does not reflect the fact that the world-famous architect is its owner. In addition to David Chipperfield's apartment, his work studio is also located in the house. A cozy courtyard combines the living and working space of the house.\n\nThe spacious dining room is located on the first floor of the house. Chipperfield worked on its arrangement on his own. He often receives guests in it. The monochrome design common to the whole house is also characteristic of the dining room. David Chipperfield built his current home in 1997. He was working on a renovation project for the New Museum in Berlin at the time. The Art Nouveau building is surrounded by beautiful historical buildings. It has become an integral part of the historic district since its completion. The building does not disturb its harmony at all.
