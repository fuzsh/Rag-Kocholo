Everything you see in this city hides a secret which is ready to be uncov- ered. While walking through the streets, if you look carefully, you will notice that most of the monuments, the parks, the roads and even open air spaces try to convey a piece of Berlin’s controversial his- tory. With this guide we want to introduce you to the most interesting places that you absolutely must see. We start with a brief history of the city, it may seem bor- ing, but be assured that it’s very important to be aware of the past in order to better ap- preciate some of the sites. The survival guide that comes next provides you with the most important informa- tion about hostels, public transport and other places you might need to go. Then we cover different sec- tions. Culture is an impor- tant part of Berlin and we have highlighted the best bits along with an excellent guide to the museums and art gal- leries. INTRODUCITON By Martina Cocci\n\n5. 5 Cafés and restaurants can be considered one of the most in- teresting aspects of the city, as they mirror its multicultural- ism. In Berlin you will find ev- ery kind of food from Turkey to China, from Italy to North Eu- rope. Nightlife is another important feature, young people here have a wide selection of clubs, bars and pubs, so you’ll be spoilt for choice. Even shopping lovers can sat- isfy their needs, not only in the shopping area of Ku-dam, but also thanks to the opportunities that the city provides for vin- tage shopping and flea markets. During the warmer seasons it’s very enjoyable to spend an en- tire day in one of the various outdoor areas of the city: Tier- garten, Wannsee and Tegeler See. Last but not the least you will also find a piece of advice about the best guided tours both on foot and with other means of transport. So, don’t miss the oppor tunity to discover Berlin, espe- cially if you have a low budget. Follow our suggestions and you won’t be disappointed!\n\n6. The earli- est mention of Berlin in a title deed. In the 13th cen- tury, itinerant merchants founded the trading posts of Berlin & Cölln near today’s Nicholaiviertal. A profitable medieval trade route, the Ascanian margrave of Bran- denburg decided to amal- gamate the two towns into one for political and security purposes in 1307. 23 years after Martin Lu- ther nailed his 95 theses to the all-saints church in Wittenburg, Ber- lin finally converts to Prot- estantism. Berlin prospered for the immediate few de- cades until it was thrown into the medley of the thirty years war (1618-48). Elec- tor Georg Wilhelm (1620- 40) attempted to keep Ber- lin neutral although this only succeeded in Berlin being battered by both sets of belligerents. As a result destruction, starvation, murder and disease ran rife through the city’s decimated streets. FrederickWil- liam I, known as the great elector, succeeds his fa- ther Georg Wilhelm as elector of Brandenburg. His reign is categorized by a policy of encourag- ing immigration and reli- gious toleration. The German empire is found- ed. Berlin is de- clared the capital under the command of Wilhelm I of Prussia. Berlin’s pop- ulation skyrockets from 800,000 to 1.5 million in- habitants. Kaiser Wilhelm goes into exile in Holland as riots break out after Germa- ny’s heavy defeat in WWI. Food shortages and left- ist political aggravation characterize these tumul- tuous years, resultantly the government resigns and seeks peace with the allied forces. At the end of WWI in 1918, a republic was pro- 6 HISTORY 1237 1539 1871 1640 By Thomas Bamford\n\n7. claimed in Berlin. In 1920, the Greater Berlin Act incorporated dozens of suburban cities, vil- lages and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. This new area encompassed Spandau and Charlottenburg in the west, as well as several other areas that are now major municipalities. After this expansion, Berlin had a population of around four million. During the Weimar era, Berlin became internation- ally renowned as a centre of cul- tural transformation at the heart of the Roaring Twenties. The darkest hours of Berlin’s his- tory begin. The American stock market collapses in 1929. Ameri- ca would call in all of its foreign loans and Germany was spared no slack, even after the massive rep- arations it was forced to pay un- der the Treaty of Versailles. This crippled the economy of Germany and em- ployment rose to over 6 million people. As history has proved over and over, economic depression causes the rise of extremism – during this period National Socialism and Communism were vying for the power of German government. Hitler obtained full power after claiming emergency powers from Chancellor Von Hindenburg after the Reichstag fire. The fire was os- tensibly caused by Dutch anarchist Marinus Van Der Lubbe, although many historians still speculate that the Nazi’s caused it them- selves in order to gain emergency powers. 7 1920 1933\n\n8. HISTORYAfter the fall of Berlin in WWII, Berlin is spliced into 4 sec- tions by the allied powers. The former population of 4.5 million is almost halved, with a third of all the city’s histor- ic buildings and living space flattened. Berlin is slashed in two by the Berlin Wall. The Eastern bloc claimed that the wall was erected to protect its population from fascist elements conspiring to pre- vent the will of the people in building a socialist state in East Germany. In operation however, the wall served only to prevent the massive emi- gration & defection (dubbed the brain-train) leaving for West Germany. The path of the wall is marked today by a double row of cobbles throughout the city. A peaceful revo- lution leads to the destruction of the Berlin wall and subse- quently the dismantling of the GDR. As communism began to falter in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslova- kia, new exodus points were opened, breaking a hole in the iron curtain. On Novem- ber 9th 1989, East German official, Gunter Schabowski, announced that, “perma- nent relocations can be done through all border check- points between the GDR into the FGR or West Berlin”. This announcement caused mass celebrations on both sides of the wall, many par- ticipants bringing a chisel and hammer to take part in its destruction. Germany is offi- cially re-united by the Grundgesetz consti- tution article 25. The end of the process is referred to as Deutsch Einheit, or Ger- man Unity. Berlin again becomes Germany’s capital and parliament returns to the Reichstag for the first time since 1933. 1945 1961 1989 1990\n\n9. 9 Berlin is now a world city of culture, politics, media and science. Its economy is based loosely on high tech industry and the service sector. It is a thriving cultural mecca, particularly amongst young people due to its vibrant nightlife (clubs have no legal obligation to close) and has become one of the coolest places on the face of the earth. Berlin is a fully unified and cosmopolitan city and an exciting destination for travellers. MODERN DAY BERLIN\n\n10.

SURVIVALGUIDE There is usually a supermarket within walking distance of every neighbourhood in Berlin. Ex- amples of supermarkets include Rewe, Kaisers, Lidl and Aldi. Local farmer markets are dotted over the city and have a great source of fresh produce. Shops are closed on Sundays, except bakeries, souvenir shops and supermarkets based in the major train stations including Hauptbahnhof, Friedrichstraße and Ostbahnhof. Having no curfew means Berliners literally party for the entire weekend. The bars and clubs are packed from dawn to dust and beyond. The clubs don’t start un- til around 1.00 and don’t reach their peak until 3.00 – 5.00am. Choose from under- ground techno clubs to beach bars to beer gardens - there is something in Berlin to suit everyone’s taste. Entry into super clubs like Berghain will set you back about 14.00€ but the smaller venues will charge about 5.00€ to 10.00€. Drinks are relatively inexpensive com- pared with other cities. A bottled beer will set you back approx.. 3€ The dress code is very re- laxed with high heels and smart shirts looking out of place. The best advice is to stick to simple individual style in dark colours with flat shoes. Cheap fast food is the staple diet here. The ultimate cult snack food is Berlin’s Currywurst. This consists of sliced fried wiener swimming in spicy tomato sauce, topped with curry powder. Check out Curry 36 for the top dog in town. like a berliner...

This is street food at its best and the best stalls have the queues to prove it. Thinly shaved roasted veal and fresh salad, doused with a sauce of your choice. Select from a combi- nation of Krauter (herb), scharf (hot) and Knoblauch (garlic). Choose from the traditional donor served in lightly toasted bread or the slightly less messy ‘Durum’ donor served in tortilla style flat breads. For a supreme pig out, have your kebab served over chips in a donor box. The humble burger is quickly becoming an integral part of Berlin’s fast food scene. Hole in the wall style burger joints have been popping up all over the city, offering greasy beef favourites and veggi delights at rock bot- tom prices.

From the iconic Brandenburger Tor to the über-modern steel and glass of Potsdamer Platz’s Sony Centre, Berlin’s architecture is a hotchpotch of the old and new. The city is also home to an impressively diverse collection of current and former religious buildings and a range of memorials to historical events – from the Siegessäule to the Neue Wache. You’ll soon realise that you’re spoilt for choice if you’re look- ing to while away some time contemplating a slice of archi- tectural history often without spending a cent. 17\n\n18. Overlooking the Lustgarten park, this neo-Baroque cathedral with its elaborate stonework and strik- ing copper dome was built by Julius Carl Raschdorff to replace a more modest 18th-century structure. Work began in 1894 and was com- pleted in 1905. The gold- and mar- ble-filled cathedral is much more comfortable than you might expect. It bears a closer resemblance to a concert hall than to an actual place of worship. The vividly-coloured stained glass windows depicting scenes from the life of Jesus and the ornately carved and gilded wooden pulpit are particularly noteworthy. The organ is also worth a special mention as it has an impressive- ly intricate case and 7 200 pipes. A suggested route around the build- ing is clearly signposted, and takes about an hour. This route covers the main worship area, a museum detailing the cathedral’s history and a walkway up to the dome with fan- tastic views across the city (though be warned – it’s not for those who aren’t keen on steps). The route also covers the crypt which houses monu- ments of the Hohenzollern dynasty – the rulers of Prussia (and Germa- ny post-unification) from the 15th century until Kaiser Wilhelm II’s By Emma Dennison FEATURE 18 BERLINER DOMAm Lustgarten |Mitte 10178 +49(0)30- 20269-136 S: Hackescher Markt (Apr-Sept) Mon-Sat 9.00-20.00 | Sun 12.00-20.00 (Oct-Mar) Mon-Sat 9.00-19.00 | Sun 12.00-19.00 7€ standard | 4€ concessions www.berlinerdom.de\n\n19. abdication in 1918. The Crypt is particularly worth visiting on a hot day, es- pecially after walking up to the dome, as it is much cooler than the rest of the cathedral. If you’d prefer something more structured, detailed audioguides in Eng- lish, German, Spanish or Italian are available for €3, or guided tours can be organ- ised by phoning in advance. The crypt also houses temporary exhibitions and a gift shop that stocks a wide range of souvenirs, both of the cathedral and of Ber- lin in general. There is an outdoor café, which along with the shop, can be accessed with- out paying the entrance fee. The Cathedral also plays host to a number of concerts and recitals throughout the year. 19 “The vividly coloured stained glass windows are particularly noteworthy”\n\n20. 20 DAS BUDDHISTISCHE HAUS The Buddhist House By Lily Woi Edelhofdamm 54 | Frohnau 13465 S Frohnau Mon – Sun 09.00-18.00 Free www.das-buddhistische-haus. de Enter through wooden doors and trek up the long, steep staircase until you arrive at a Ceylonese- style building situated at the top of a hill surrounded by lush greenery. The Buddhist House is the oldest Theravada Buddhist temple in Europe and was founded in 1924 by Dr Paul Dahlke, a homeopathic doctor and writer. Although this contemporary-style temple is architecturally very different from the temples in Southeast Asia, you’ll still experience the same feelings of serenity when you visit. A Japanese-style garden with a patio is located behind the building, where you’ll be able to take a relaxing walk and soak in the spiritual essence of this place. Beautifully-crafted Buddha statues are dotted around the whole area. Some overlook the forest, giving the illusion that the Buddha is gracing you with his presence. Have an enlightening chat about Buddhism or meditation with Bhante K. Santharakkhitha, the resident Buddhist monk from Sri Lanka. If you’re interested in learning more about Buddhism you can visit the temple’s library, which is filled with an extensive collection of Buddhist literature. Free mediation lessons, lectures, Dhamma talks and Buddhist prayer sessions are also offered every week. Everyone is welcome.\n\n21. 21 DENKMAL ZUR ERINNERUNG AN DIE BÜCHERVERBRENNUNG Book burning memorial By Bethany McDowell Bebelplatz 1 | 10117 Berlin U Friedrichstraße | Branden- burger Tor Free Hidden away in Bebelplatz, the Book Burning Memorial is a piece of artwork by the Israeli artist Micha Ullman and serves as a reminder of the Nazi book burning ceremony which took place on 10th May, 1933. On this night, nationalist students burned over 20,000 books which they considered ‘un-German’, marking the beginning of state censorship and control. Many of these books had famous and influential authors such as Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud and Franz Kafka. Called simply ‘Library’ and made in 1995, the memorial consists of a small glass window fixed between cobbles in the ground. It is quite hard to find but there will be people gathered round it. Peering through the window you can see row upon row of empty white bookcases, with enough space to house the 20,000 books which were burnt in 1933. The expanse of these empty shelves and the way this memorial is hidden underground raises many questions about censorship, suppression and freedom. How could people burn so many books full of knowledge and life? Beside the memorial is a bronze plaque with the haunting words from Heinrich Heine’s play, Almansor: ‘Where they burn books, they will in the end also burn people.’\n\n22. 22 NEUE WACHE Unter den Linden | Mitte 10117 S + U Friedrichstraße Mon-Sun 10.00-18.00 Right next to the German History Museum on Unter den Linden, this monument provides the perfect place for a spot of thoughtful reflection away from the noise of the city. Built by architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel and completed in 1818, the neoclassical Neue Wache with its impressive columned façade and pointed roof served as a guardhouse to the troops of the Crown Prince of Prussia. Since 1931, the building has been used as a memorial and was first dedicated to the soldiers who lost their lives in World War I. The East German government then rededicated the memorial after World War II by lighting an eternal flame for the victims of fascism and militarism. Today, the memorial is home to artist Käthe Kollwitz’ statue: Mother with her Dead Son. Standing directly under the oculus – a perfectly circular hole in the roof - the statue is vulnerably open to the elements. Kollwitz’ work depicts a grieving mother holding her fallen son, and is dedicated to all victims of war and tyranny. If you’re lucky enough to be there on wreath-laying days, you can witness the changing of the guards as it used to happen in the GDR.

However the column has now been transformed into a symbol of openness and cosmopolitanism. Barack Obama chose this landmark for his speech in July 2008, and in 2006 there was a giant public viewing area during the Football World Cup. The gay pride music festival, ‘Love Parade’, also used to march through here. You can see the gilded bronze statue of Winged Victory standing on her 67m (220ft) column from the Brandenburg Gate. She glitters in the sun and invites you closer. But don’t follow her blindly through the traffic; there are underground tunnels with interactive art installations to help you reach your goal safely. Once there, a climb of around 285 spiralling steps awaits you. This is not for the faint-hearted or anyone with a hangover! At the top, the fresh air and pleasant view of Berlin are worth the effort. You can spot most of Berlin’s major landmarks, such as the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag, albeit in miniature. This is a fun trip with a great panoramic view, plus if you pay the full price of 3.00€, you get 0.50€ off at Victoria Café opposite the column.\n\n24. 24 ALEXANDERPLATZ Alexanderplatz | Mitte 10178 S + U Alexanderplatz From a medieval cattle market to an eighteenth-century exercise ground, Alexanderplatz has seen a lot of change. A venue for both the glamorous and cocaine-fuelled twenties and the November 1984 GDR regime protest, it has always been an area for people to come together regardless of motive. Although not the most visually appealing space, Alexanderplatz (or “Alex” to Berliners) holds an enormous amount of German history - whether social, cultural or political. In the latter half of the nineteenth century the square was transformed from a transport hub to a shopping area, primarily due to its reconstruction after World War II. Attempting (and arguably succeeding) to challenge the West’s high-rises, the East- Berlin-constructed Fernsehturm (TV Tower) still dominates the skyline today and allows you to identify the city’s largest urban square no matter your location. For 12.50€ you can access the Tower’s rotating viewing platform for a spectacular aerial view of the city. Some of the more inexpensive sights include the Brunnen der Völkerfreundschaft (Fountain of Friendship Between Peoples) and the 1969 World Time Clock. Both of these serve as popular meeting places amongst the bustle. With plans for demolition and reconstruction constantly on the table, Alexanderplatz will continue to be the face of change in Berlin, so be sure to visit the landmark sight at one stage of its constantly evolving timeline.

This once- heavily-guarded border crossing may, at first glance, seem to be the most tourist-infested site you’ve seen thus far. There might, however, be a good reason for this. Amongst all its emotionally charged history, it’s also known for being the site of the famous stand- off between US and Soviet tanks in 1961, when the world waited in horror as the prospect of a third World War loomed uncomfortably large. There isn’t much left of this infamous site apart from a mocked- up border control booth and two actors in uniform, with flags and rifles at their sides. However these features are merely superfluous. The fascinating history of the site can be experienced in the museum Haus am Checkpoint Charlie. Inside you can read all about the heroic, desperate, and ingenious escape attempts by GDR citizens during the communists’ reign. Three floors of memorabilia crammed into small rooms is a lot to get through, yet it’s gripping - especially considering the lengths people went to in order to escape the leaders they never voted for. Homemade hot air balloons and one-man U-boats are just two examples of the would-be escapees’ ingenuity. CHECKPOINT CHARLIE\n\n26. 26 SANKT-HEDWIGS-KATHEDRALE Hinter der Katholischen Kirche 3 | 10117 Mitte Berlin U Französische Straβe U Hausvogteiplatz Mon – Sat 10.00-17.00 | Sun 13.00 – 17.00 Free www.hedwigs-kathedrale.de Located in Bebelplatz, St Hedwig’s Cathedral is the most important Roman Catholic cathedral in Berlin and serves as the seat of the city’s archbishop. Consecrated in 1747, it was the first Catholic Church to be built in Prussia after the Protestant Reformation. The original neo-classical building, designed to resemble the Pantheon in Rome, burned down in 1943. It has been replaced by a modern interior by architect Hans Schwippert consisting of two churches with eight different chapels. Unlike other Catholic churches, the design is simple and unconventional. As well as the tombs of many bishops of Berlin, the church also houses the crypt of Bernhard Lichtenberg, who was ProvostoftheCathedralChapterfrom 1938. Outspoken against the Nazis’ treatment of Jews and the euthanasia programmes, he was arrested in 1941 by the Gestapo and imprisoned for two years after publicly praying for the persecuted Jews. He later died en route to Dachau concentration camp in November 1943, and was beatified as a martyr in 1996 by Pope John Paul II. The cathedral’s many attractions include a room housing a collection of liturgical vestments and objects, an impressive organ and a uniquely designed dome, which is well worth a visit. Organ recitals are held on Wednesday at 3.00pm, and guided tours are available in English upon request.

Designed by Carl Gotthard Langhans and built in the late eighteenth century, it has since undergone a few unwilling makeovers by political giants. The prime example would be that by Napoleon, when he kidnapped the Quadriga of the Goddess of Victory from atop the Gate and took her to France as a trophy. She was happily reinstated in 1841, and looks down majestically upon the tourists that flock to Pariser Platz, the luxurious square adjacent to the Gate. After World War II, the Gate came to symbolise divided Berlin - it was trapped in the East until Reunification led to its appropriation as a symbol of peace. Visit at dusk on a balmy evening when the sun’s rays spill across the columns and in busy seasons, the various buskers and entertainers create an atmosphere reminiscent of a festival. So go ahead and follow in the footsteps of Barack Obama, who in June this year made a speech from beside the Gate, and feel the history exuding from this landmark that has become one of the most recognised in Europe. Don’t hesitate to walk through Berlin’s front door and feel like you’ve truly arrived. Brandenburg Gate\n\n28. Potsdamer Platz, named after the nearby town of Potsdam, is an area of Berlin known for its architecture and busy environment. Also referred to as ‘The platz to be’, it is home to dozens of restaurants, a large shop- ping centre, several luxurious hotels, the Sony Centre and many visitors. Shopping Potsdamer Platz Arkaden is a large shopping centre easily accessed from the S & U-bahn station. In- side, numerous shops can be found across several levels. Here you will find a variety of stores sell- ing clothes, accessories, food and drink amongst other things. With so much on offer here, you could easily spend a day in the area. Hotels This busy quarter is also home to many glamorous hotels - perhaps the most deluxe is the Ritz Carlton. Oth- ers include the Grand Hotel Bellevue and the Palast Hotel which opened in the late 19th century. The Fürsten- hof opened its doors in 1907 and the Esplanade followed just a year later.

Entertainment The Sony Centre is one of the main highlights of the Platz, bringing entertainment to the buzzing square. A large cinema can be found there, along with the Deutsche Kinemathek - Museum für Film und Fernsehen (Film and Television Museum). History Until 1838, this area was a mere crossroads at one of Berlin’s city gates. After the construction of a rail- way station, the rural area began to blossom within a few decades. A period of economic growth after the creation of the German Empire in 1871 led to a ‘building boom’. In 1882 Germany’s the first electric streetlights were installed in the square. The area’s heyday was the Weimar period, when it was com pared to Piccadilly Circus and Times Square, however heavy bombing dur- ing World War II followed by the con- struction of the Berlin Wall rendered Potsdamer Platz unrecognisable. Architecture Many architects were involved in the post- Reunification building and redevelopment of this area in Ber- lin. Headed by Italian Renzo Piano (well- known for building the Centre Pom- pidou in Paris, and the New York Times Building), the eight-strong team’s members have all put their unique stamp on the magnificent skyline of the architectural quarter. 29 “THE PLATZ TO BE”\n\n30. 30 SCHLOSS CHARLOTTENBURG Charlottenburg Palace By Martina Cocci Spandauer Damm 20-24 Charlottenburg 14059 U Richard-Wagner Platz Apr-Oct Sun-Tue 10.00-18.00 Nov-March Sun-Tue 10.00-17.00 Mon Closed This palace was built by Fredrick III, Elector of Brandenburg, in 1699 as a summer residence for his wife Sophie Charlotte. It’s best to allow lots of time to visit the palace since the tour with the audio guide, which is included in the price, takes an hour and a quarter to complete. It can seem a little monotonous, but once you have started to walk through the royal apartments and rooms decorated in a variety of styles and materials you will be transported back to the period of the Prussian kings and won’t even notice the passage of time. You also have the option of just visiting one of the palace’s two wings. The first one, commissioned by Sophie Charlotte in 1699, was designed in a Baroque style. The newer Rococo wing was built after Sophie Charlotte’s death in 1705. It contains the state apartments of Friedrich the Great and the Winter Chambers of Friedrich Wilhelm II. One of the characteristic features of the palace is the collection of Chinese and Japanese porcelain; the Porcelain Cabinet is especially amazing and contains more than 2700 porcelains that convey the triumph of the light thanks to the mirrors that surround them.\n\n31. 31 NIKOLAIVIERTEL Nicholas’s Quarter By Adam Lambert Am Nußbaum 3 | Mitte 10178 S + U Alexanderplatz www.nikolaiviertel-berlin.de This quaint borough of Mitte lies just five minutes’ walk along the banks of the Spree from Alexanderplatz, and is the reconstructed historical heart of Berlin. It was founded around 1200 but badly destroyed during World War II; many of the buildings are imitations of the once-grand medieval architecture. Often awash with tourists, the cobbled streets of Nikolaiviertel boast five museums and numerous restaurants which specialise in traditional German cuisine. Berlin’s oldest church - the St. Nikolai-Kirche, which gives the area its name - is the main point of interest and is now used as a museum which houses a permanent exhibition detailing the history of the church. Although quaint and picturesque, the district is perhaps somewhat lacking in authenticity and is partly spoiled by the numerous tacky souvenir shops that clutter the streets. An attempt to keep the focus on the history has led to the installationofnumberedinformation plaques which adorn the buildings and outline the district’s interesting past. All in all, don’t let the touristy nature of Nikolaiviertel put you off as many an interesting holiday photo can be taken here while discovering Medieval Berlin.\n\n32. 32 PARK SANSSOUCI By Thomas Bamford An der Orangerie 1 | Potsdam 14469 RE: Potsdam Hauptbahnhof | Bus: Schloss Sanssouci Tues-Sun 10.00 – 18.00 | Mon closed Premium pass (allowing one day’s entry to all attractions) 19€ | 14€ concessions http://www.potsdam-park- sanssouci.de/ 30 minutes by Regional Express train from Berlin are the verdant gardens of Park Sanssouci, surrounding the palace of Schloss Sanssouci. Sanssouci, French for ‘without a care,’ was built between 1745 and 1747 as the summer residence of Prussian king Friedrich II (Frederick the Great). The estate served as a resplendent retreat for when the King found ruling the Prussian Empire too overwhelming. Arrive early to ensure you have time to see everything Sanssouci has to offer. There’s almost too much to see in one day, so pack plenty of enthusiasm to get you through the often lengthy queues. As well as Schloss Sanssouci, other major sights include the Neues Palais (New Palace), the Neuen Kammern (New Chambers), the Orangery and Schloss Charlottenhof. The luxurious 18th-century picture gallery contains paintings by Van Dyck, Caravaggio and Rubens. Schloss Sanssouci’s design was greatly influenced by Friedrich II himself, who disregarded many of his architect’s suggestions. The rooms have been preserved in all their splendour, despite Friedrich’s wish that the Palace last only for his lifetime and die with him. Park Sanssouci really is a big visit so plan your day so that you see as much as possible. Don’t forget to take advantage of the audio guides or guided tours included in the admission price.\n\n33. 33 By Thomas Bamford Platz der Republik 1 | Tiergarten 11011 U Bundestag | U+S Brandenburger Tor Dome 8.00-23.00 daily – online booking required Free www.bundestag.de ‘DemDeutschenVolke’–soreads the iconic inscription above the entrance to the Reichstag, the home of Germany’s parliament. This gift ‘to the German people’ has become emblematic of the city’s chequered history of occupation, destruction and subsequent resurrection. The imperious building was erected between 1884 and 1894 and was designed by German architect Paul Wallot, who borrowed heavily from Italian Renaissance and neo-Baroque styles. Home to Germany’s parliament until 1933, the building has since played a huge part in Berlin’s history. The Reichstag was burned down in 1933, ostensibly by the Communists or perhaps the Nazis – the debate continues. The Nazi government used the building only for propaganda presentations and, having been bombed during World War II, it remained empty until Reunification. An epic reconstruction project, overseen by British architect Norman Foster, began in 1992. It once more became a seat of power, this time for the German Bundestag, in 1999. The building’s crowning glory is now its glass and metal cupola, a nod to Wallot’s original design. The dome is open to visitors and offers a panoramic view of the city as you scale its futuristic mirrored interior. A free audio guide is available, detailing the building’s history and describing the views. Book online and well in advance, especially during the summer months when it can get very busy. REICHSTAG\n\n34. 34 UNTER DER LINDEN By Thomas Bamford 10117 Mitte U Friedrichstraße Französischer Straße U+S | Brandenburger Tor Stretching from East to West, from the site of the former Berliner Stadtschloss palace to the Brandenburg Gate, is Unter den Linden, the central artery of Berlin’s Mitte district. The road was designed by Johann Georg, Elector of Brandenburg, in the 16th century so that he could more easily reach his hunting ground in the Tiergarten. The addition of the linden (or lime) trees was an artistic flourish ordered by Elector Friedrich Wilhelm I. Friedrich II (Frederick the Great) added the Staatsoper Unter den Linden (Berlin State Opera) in 1741, and was later immortalised in an iron statue at the street’s eastern end. Frederick the Great also added the Prince Heinrich Palace, which is now Humboldt University - notable alumni include Albert Einstein, Karl Marx, Otto von Bismarck and many more. The street today is a peculiar mix of museums, such as the Deutsches Historiches Museum and the Willy Brandt Museum, and flagship car showrooms such as those of Volkswagen, Bentley and Skoda. If cars aren’t your thing, try the art gallery underneath the Volkswagen showroom. There are also several monuments, such as the Book Burning Memorial and the Neue Wache -largely considered Karl Friedrich Schinkel’s masterpiece - and of course the ubiquitous souvenir shops selling a range of tat for tourists.\n\n35. 35 Red City Hall By Stephanie Annett Rathausstraße 15 |10178 Mitte Free admission Mon - Fri 9am - 6pm U+S | Alexanderplatz This imposing red brick structure is an unusual blend of Italian RenaissanceandNorthernGerman architectural styles. The Rathaus boasts three courtyards and many arched windows, and is topped off with a striking 74-metre-tall tower. The 19th-century building is situated in Alexanderplatz, behind the elaborate Neptunbrunnen fountain. The Rathaus was severely damaged by allied forces in the Second World War but was quickly reconstructed in the years after. Following the division of Berlin, the Rathaus became the town hall for East Berlin whilst the West was governed from Rathaus Schöneberg.AftertheColdWarand Reunification, the Rathaus once again became the administrative centre for the whole city. It is now also the seat of Berlin’s mayor, Klaus Wowereit, and the Senate. Upon entering the building and ascending the grand red-carpeted staircase, you could be forgiven for imagining you were on the Titanic. Immerse yourself in the building’s grandeur and admire the stunningly intricate chandeliers. Explore the maze of rooms at your leisure, but don’t miss the nine-metre-high orange Pillar Hall; the Hall of Arms, with coats of arms for all Berlin’s districts; and the Grand Room, used for ceremonies. Don’t forget to sign the guest book when you leave, and take a sneaky peek at Barack Obama’s signature. BERLIN RATHAUS\n\n36. ARTS & CULTURE\n\n37. Berlin is a mecca of art and culture. Thanks to its low cost of living, Berlin has attracted tons of artists, musicians and writers over the years. This means that the city not only showcases the famous and well-known but also the new and up-and-coming. The art and culture here can be seen all around - whether you’re walk- ing past graffiti or visiting a well-known art gallery, everything in Berlin is designed to en- hance your cultural experience. 37\n\n38. 38 KONZERT AM BODE-MUSEUM Portal des Bode-Museums, Monbijou- brücken | Mitte 10117 S Hackescher Markt |U+S Friedrichstraße (Jul-Aug) Sun 20.30 Free Entry, Donations welcome. www.sonntagskonzerte.de Every Sunday evening in July and August the steps of the Bode- Museum onto Monbijoubrücke become a concert venue, showcasing varied programmes of lesser-known chamber works. As traditional concert halls can be expensive, this is a more informal way to get your classical music fix without worrying about stuffy etiquette. The audience comprises of all ages and nationalities, with lots of young people, so don’t worry about feeling out of place. The concert starts at 20.30, however if you want a seat you should be there at least half an hour before. Otherwise sit on the floor or steps – but don’t expect much space. The concerts last around two hours, including an interval, so Concerts at the Bode-Museum bring something to sit on and a jacket as it can get chilly. Wine and beer are available to buy, though you can also bring your own. Programmes are free, and donations are taken during the interval. Despite the gentle hush that falls as the music begins, audience members come and go as they please, though the encores are usually worth the wait. Despite the comings-and-goings, the music can easily be heard thanks to speakers and the lighting ensures a clear view even as the sun sets. As a way to spend a Sunday evening in Berlin, watching the sunset over a beautiful building accompanied by wonderful music for next to nothing has to be one of the best.

A 1.3km remnant of something as simple as a wall, used to divide people, cultures, ideas and ways of life, this weighty and utterly discriminating divider is now one of the largest outdoor galleries in the world. It was commissioned and decorated by dozens of international artists in 1990, soon after Germany’s reunification. The original works have been somewhat eroded by time, and in many cases distastefully defaced, but the murals still shine through. You get the distinct feeling that reunification was a time of sincere jubilation, when many felt a need to make a mark, a warning, and a celebration. You just have to gaze uponDmitriVrubel’swrydepictionof communist leaders Leonid Brezhnev and Erich Honecker kissing to even begin to understand how powerful it feels, how poignant it is. All lovers of graffiti and revolutionary art should be in their element here. For 1.00€ you can also have a GDR stamp in your passport so you can say you’ve literally been there and crossed the border. Who knows where it will take you?\n\n40. 40 MUSEUM FÜR GEGENWART Invalidenstraße 50-51 | 10557 Berlin U: Naturkundemuseum | S: Hauptbahnhof Tue – Sun 10.00 – 18.00 |Thur 10.00 – 20.00 | Mon Closed 14€ Standard | 7€ concession www.hamburgerbahnhof.de If you only have a few hours to absorb some of Berlin’s menagerie of creativity on offer it would have to be done in Hamburger Bahnhof. No, it’s not some kind of gallery/fast food outlet - it is, in all its magnificence, 10,000 sq ft of contemporary art housed in a former 19th century train station bordering the district of Mitte. On entering the cool, lofty, whitewashed interior you have the chance to view an ever- changing array of temporary, cutting-edge exhibitions. But the main attraction is its permanent exhibition, at the centre of which is the Marx Collection. A humble assortment of 20th-century gems was made available to Hamburger Bahnhof the viewing public by Berlin entrepreneur Erich Marx in 1982, and Berliners and tourists alike flock to see it. There is nothing quite like standing idly among giant fragments of some of the past century’s most notable, and I’m talking about the likes of Warhol’s ‘Chairman Mao’, and early collage ‘Pink Door’ by Rauschenberg. Lichtenstein, Cy Twombly and Joseph Beuys also feature in the collection that offers an exciting focus on a predominantly American theme from the 1960s and 1970s. Even if you are indifferent to the above-mentioned and think it’s not your thing, the free guided tour on Saturdays and Sundays at 12pm is well worth it and will leave you all the more thirsty for what this great city has to offer.

Built as an air-raid shelter during World War II, it’s had a myriad of uses over the years: Soviet prison, textile factory, and exotic fruit and vegetable warehouse (during which time it became known as the “banana bunker”) Today it’s owned by avid art collector and enthusiast Christian Boros and holds and exhibits, in slow rotation, his vast collection of contemporary art. The first exhibition opened in 2008 and lasted for four years; the second opened in 2012 and is still going. It has a labyrinthine interior, with 80 rooms lit with bare strip lighting. It’s scantily decorated in the ‘white cube’ style, with bare concrete walls. Some rooms are tiny, dark and close, while others have been hollowed out and seem vast, bearing the scars of renovation. Installations fill and complement the space, paintings loom in corridors, and giant photographic works are stylishly hung. It’s gritty - and bunker like. You need to book way in advance for the guided tour, so allow a few weeks. The tour is available in German and English, and takes about 1.5 hours. It’s well worth the money and is thoroughly engaging and thought-provoking.\n\n42. 42 SAMMLUNG SCHARF-GERSTENBURG Schloßstraße 70 | Charlottenburg 14059 U Richard-Wagnerplatz | S Westend Tues-Sun 10.00-18.00 Entrance included with Museum Berggruen Ticket www.smb.museum Ever wondered how to turn a horse’s rear-end into a skull? Welcome to ‘Surreal Worlds’ - the exhibition at Sammlung Scharf- Gerstenburg that will introduce you to a whole new way of looking at the world. Sammlung Scharf-Gerstenberg holds the Dieter Scharf Collection in memory of Otto Gerstenberg (1848-1935), an art collector who assembled one of the largest art collections of his time. His grandsons, Walter Scharf (1923- 1996) and Dieter Scharf (1926- 2001), inherited his passion for art and continued to acquire pieces for the collection. The exhibition holds more then 250 paintings, sculptures and lithographs, and includes works by Dalí, Magritte and Miró to name but a Scharf-Gerstenburg Collection few. It shows a world of marvels and metamorphoses, as the artists merge dreams with reality. There are films here too: Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí’s critical view of the bourgeoisie can be seen in the shocking surrealist film ‘Un Chien Andalou,’ which runs on loop along with other films made by contemporary artists. Marx Klinger’s series of lithographs entitled ‘Glove’ is also a must-see, and the free audio guide explains the diverse representations of the psyche in each picture. As for creating a skull out of a horse’s backside, you will just have to go and see that for yourselves.

It is renowned for its repertoire of shows and hosts many artists from around the world. Because of its diverse and forward thinking approach to the art exhibited, it’s no wonder they get a lot of international recognition. The interior of the gallery is made up of small, quiet, separate spaces. As you meander through, musing on the strange and unique installations, the gallery eventually opens up into a cavernous hall-like basement whichechoes your careful footsteps and leads down to a further bare- brick-walled dungeon space. The curators use the space well and display the work sensitively. Go back through the reception area and take the stairs up to floor 3 ½, where there is more to see before heading down to the courtyard for a much-needed coffee. The shows change three to four times a year so there is always something fresh and new to engage in, and you don’t have to ‘know’ anything about art to appreciate them. Perturbed? Gobsmacked at what you see? Places like this exist to open your mind and encourage you to question things, not to be content with the norm - whatever you count that to be.\n\n44. 44 SCHWULES MUSEUM Lützowstraße 73 | Tiergarten 10785 U Nöllendorfplatz U Kurfürstenstraße Sun, Mon, Weds-Fri 14.00-18.00 | Sat 14.00-19.00 | closed Tues 6€ | 4€ concessions www.schwulesmuseum.de Founded in 1985, this is the world’s largest (and Europe’s only) museum dedicated to homosexual culture. It aims to archive, research and communicate the history and culture of the lesbian, gay, trans, bisexual, intersex and queer communities. The 300 exhibits show visitors how gay men and women have lived, fought and partied over the centuries. Explore the execution of “gay” monks in the 1500s in Ghent, and the life story of Einar Wegener - the first person to receive gender reassignment surgery in the 1930s. Learn how bodybuilding helped the acceptability of nude photography and how the state- funded BerlinAIDS project created a new social acceptance of homosexuality. Gay Museum Temporary exhibitions keep the space dynamic, and the current exhibition commemorates the lives of Jewish homosexuals in the Third Reich. It includes twenty four biographies representing the experiences of homosexual Jews under the Nazis: from exile, deportation and murder to survival and post war life. Until a new permanent exhibition is installed in 2014, you can visit the interim exhibition “Transformations”. It details, through art, lifestyles and identities beyond heteronormative gender classifications. Same-sex relationships are still taboo and criminalised in many parts of the world, and this museum offers an understanding in order to admonish inequalities.

Its location in Potsdamer Platz suits the metallic interior and futuristic layout of the exhibition. Having taken the lift that whisks you to the third floor of the building, you enter the first gallery: a geometric hall of mirrors which combines your own reflection with the faces of silent film stars. The dusky lighting and tinny background music transport you back to the 1920s; as the caption tells you, ‘the language of silent film is international’. The remainder of the exhibition is structured chronologically, exploring films that were released at the time of the Weimar Republic’s demise; films censored by the Nazi Ministry of Propaganda; and anarchic post- World-War-II films. German film star Marlene Dietrich is at the heart of the exhibition: her costumes are displayed in a circular room in the centre and the walls are peppered with photographs of her. The audio guide is worth the 2€ charge as it gives invaluable information on notable exhibits such as props and models of film sets. The television exhibition, however, is less engaging for the non-German-speaker as the television programmes in the Museum’s archive are only available to watch in German.\n\n46. Auguststraße is known as Ber- lin’s main gallery area. An area that encapsulates the thriving na- ture of the avant-garde, a hive of creativity that has turned into a magnet for all those looking for contemporary art and culture, be it gallery spaces or chic eateries. Auguststraße was a predominantly Jewish neighbourhood before World War II. When the wall came down in 1989, buildings stood unused, aban- donedfromthedaysoftheGDR. Gal- leries and young creative types knew how to take advantage of the cheap rent and cost of living. They moved into the area, thus establishing it as the centre of the German art scene. Standing proudly amidst August Street, is the former Jewish School for Girls. It was designed by promi- nent architect Alexander Beer in the so-called ‘New Objectivity’ style, emphasizing function over form. Looking from the outside it’s dark and imposing. The inside, however, is elegant and flow- ing with mosaic tiled floors, Mitte | 10117 Berlin U Rosenthaler Platz S Oranienburger Straße August Street high ceilings and large metal framed windows. Previously unused for ten years, it held the 4th Berlin Bien- nale in 2006. It reopened in 2012 and now houses several indepen- dent art galleries and a museum devoted to former U.S. president John F. Kennedy and his family. More art galleries line the street, from smaller outfits to larger insti- tutions like Kunst Werke and the ME Collectors Room.

Be prepared to be immersed, shocked, chal- lenged and surprised when visit- ing. The street is also home to a number of inde- pendent fashion designers. It can be a long old stroll if you want to experience it all in one sitting but there is no shortage of cof- fee shops. For a little pick me up try Factory Girl, Au- guststraße 29. They serve tasty variations on coffee (Cappuccino with Banana nectar), homemade lem- onade and numerous well-craft- ed sweets and desserts. Break- fast and lunch are offered all day. As you’d expect from such an area, there are also many restau- rants and music venues that give Auguststraße a reputation for being an equally trendy spot for nightlife. For dinner choose between; Italian (Al Contadino Sotto Le StelleSlow), French (Brasserie Nord Sud), Span- ish (Restaurant Ruz) or German (Clärch- ens Ballhaus). For something a little more dynamic try Shiso Burger, they offer an interesting Asian inspired take on gourmet junk food. Auguststraße is lit up beautifully in the evening and is humming with peo- ple taking in the night. The atmo- sphere, especially during the sum- mer months, is languid and sultry. There is a real mix of people and it seems so relaxing that you could easily spend your entire trip here, drinking it all up. 47 “An area that encapsulates the thriving nature of avant-garde”\n\n48. 48 BAUHAUS ARCHIV Klingelhöferstraße 14 10785 Berlin S Nollendorfstraße Weds-Mon 10.00-17.00 www.Bahaus.de In 1919 Walter Gropius (the Bauhaus school founder) foresaw a new age in which civilization would become highly mechanized. He subsequently set up the Bauhaus school which purported a new way of teaching so that students would learn to become excellent craftspeople in workshop. The maxim of the school was to create products in which ‘function, not tradition’ should influence design. The exhibition is split into the different Bauhaus schools: ceramics, photography, stone carvings, weaving and architecture. The combined goal of each school is to amalgamate all of the schools into creating a ‘total’ work of art in which all arts, including architecture, would be brought together. Gropius realized his vision in the Bauhaus Archive iconic design of the utopian Bauhaus Archiv building with its iconic shed roofs cutting the suburban skyline. You will be surprised at just how many of the Bauhaus products are instantly familiar, for example Marcel Bruers ‘tubular chair’, the first of its design, with no hind legs. The highlight of the Archiv is the architecture section, where the display exhibits internal Bauhaus school competitions between architects to create a ‘Bauhaus settlement’. Perusing the Modernist housing models, notably the Red Cube by Monarth and Monarth and Ludvig von Der Rohe’s high rise at Fredrichstraße, it is difficult not to see the Bauhaus movement’s inspiration on modern Berlin architecture. Audioguides are available for a 20€ deposit and are advised, given the interactive nature of the presentation.

Not only are the works – which are primarily paintings - worth seeing, but the Neoclassi- cal-style gallery itself is also very attractive. At its entrance you will find a luxurious red carpet, covering a bright white marble staircase. The lower floor is made up of two sections: one dedicated to realism, where you will find the major works by Mezel, Con- stable and Curbet, and the other contains Neoclassical sculptures, such as Canova’s Ebe and Begas’ Amor and Psyche. When you reach the second floor, you en- ter a small room with a high blue dome that contrasts with the Neo- baroque sculptures which line it. On the third floor you find yourself in the “Goethezeit und Romantik” (Goethe-era and Romantic) section, featuring masterpieces by Caspar David Friedrich, Karl Friedrich Schinkel and other key figures of the Romantic and Biedermeier schools. The schools covered on this floor include Idealism, Real- ism and Impressionism, and works by Monet, Manet, Liebermann and Feuerbach. Visiting the whole gal- lery takes more or less two hours, and an informative audio guide is included in the price.\n\n50. 50 HAUPTSTADT ZOO Hardenbergplatz 8 District 10787 U + S – Zoologischer Garten Mon-Sun 09:00-19.00 Zoo only ticket 13€ standard | 10€ concession Zoo and Aquarium combi-ticket 20€ standard | 15€ concession www.zoo-berlin.de As zoos go, Berlin’s is one of the biggest in Europe, covering a massive 84 acres. The number and diversity of animals here far exceeds what most zoos can offer. Holding around 1500 different species,themainhighlightsinclude lions, brown bears, arctic wolves, a giant panda, elephants, a polar bear, penguins and kangaroos. Its vast size can be daunting, and makes it very easy to miss several of the animal exhibits, so make sure you set aside at least half a day to explore. A suggested route covers everything, but following it is definitely not an easy task! Additionally, the lack of English on the information boards means that without a good understanding of German you have little hope of learning much about the animals. The best way to enjoy your day here is to stroll leisurely around the wide leafy green footpaths, ice cream in hand. The animal pens have varied layouts, and some transport you to a Lion King-style savannah. Many pens are of a good size, leaving the animals plenty of space to roam. However the bare concrete indoor lion cages are small - quite a depressing sight considering the distressed pacing of the lions inside.

One of the gallery’s highlights is ‘Amor Victorious’ by Caravaggio which depicts Eros, representing physical love, as more powerful than any other human endeavour. This is displayed next to Giovanni Baglione’s ‘Sacred Love Versus Profane Love’ which was commissioned by a Roman bishop in response to the scandal of Caravaggio’s piece. It is clear which painting is triumphant. The gallery’s works contain many surprising symbolic representations of love and sin. For example, a cucumber represents how the mother of God was preserved from original sin in Carlo Crivelli’s ‘Madonna and Child Enthroned,’ and the subject of Sebastiano de Piombo’s ‘Portrait of a Young Woman’ makes a V-sign with her fingers - displaying either virtuosity or vivaciousness. She does, however, have a certain coquettish gleam in her eye… This is a fantastic display of art, demonstrating how the old masters explored and developed art and its subject matter through time. The free audio guide is highly recommended as it explains symbols that might otherwise be overlooked.\n\n52. 52 SINGUHR - HÖRGALERIE Wasserspeicher Belforter Straße (Main Room) and Diedenhoferstraße (Second Room) | 10405 Prenzlauer Berg U - Senefelderplatz Wed-Sun 14.00-20.00 4€ standard | 3€ concession www.singuhr.de For the past 10 years the Singuhr Sound Gallery has been Berlin’s main venue for sound art installations.

Head to the main gallery first, pull back the curtain at the entrance and step into an eerie pitch black room. The gallery’s damp concrete labyrinthine structure coupled with the creepy whistling wind will send shivers down your spine.

Here you can find a variety of exhibits, such as a loud rotating mirror at the room’s centre which swings around reflecting sharp rays of light into your face.

Or if you would simply like to learn more about modernist art, then this is a good place to start. The museum is located directly opposite Charlottenburg Palace. Once used as officers’ barracks, the building has been refurbished into a stylish gallery with small rooms which disperse the crowd and make you feel like you’re on a private tour. The museum is named after Berlin-born art- collector Heinz Berggruen (1914- 2007), who assembled the vast collection displayed here over a period of 40 years. Berggruen was a known Picasso enthusiast and there are over 120 pieces of the Spaniard’s work in the museum. The exhibition gives you a fantastic overview of Picasso’s artistic development through the different stages of his life. The collection also includes the painting ‘Nu Juane’, one of the first studies for ‘Les Demoiselles d’Avignon’, which was acquired by Berggruen’s family in 2005 for a cool $13.7 million. Also on display are over 70 works by Paul Klee alongside many of Henri Matisse’s works, including some of his famous paper cut outs, as well as works by Alberto Giacometti, Georges Braque, Henri Laurens and Paul Cézanne.\n\n54. 54 AQUARIUM BERLIN Budapester Straße 32 | Tiergarten 10787 U+S Zoologischer Garten Mon-Sun 09:00-18:00 Aquarium only ticket - 13€ standard | 10€ concession Zoo and Aquarium combi-ticket - 20€ standard | 15€ concession www.aquarium-berlin.de Berlin’s aquarium was built in 1913 as part of the Zoological Garden complex. Comprising three floors, it is one of Germany’s largest aquariums and is home to a vast variety of not only fish but also amphibians, reptiles and insects. You enter on the ground floor, which is home to the aquarium’s entire collection of fish. The walls are lined with tanks, full of exotic and brightly-coloured fish, which stretch the length of the long thin room. Towards the end of the room the tanks get larger, and here several sharks can be viewed - including blacktip reef sharks, sand tiger sharks and nurse sharks. Once you’ve explored the fish section in full, head upstairs to the reptile floor. The highlight of this floor is most definitely the crocodile hall, which was the world’s first ever walk- through enclosure. It is an Indiana Jones style walk-through, where from the bridge you can view crocodiles and turtles below. The final floor plays host to the likes of frogs, toads and some deadly spiders and scorpions.

Originally known as the Schauspielhaus and used mainly for theatre and opera, the Konzerthaus was reconstructed in the 1960s after being damaged by World War II bombing and reopened in 1984 in its current form. The exterior is dominated by its huge red-carpeted staircase and Ionic portico, which is often home to groups of tourists enjoying ice- cream. The building is topped by a sculpture of Apollo, the god of music and poetry, riding a chariot. The main venue of the Konzerthaus, the Große Saal, seats around 1500. A complete and faithful reconstruction of Schinkel’s design, the light yet opulent décor, accented with gold, is characteristic of the architect’s style. The walls are adorned with busts of notable composers and the room is lit by fourteen gleaming chandeliers. Other rooms are similarly decorated, with pastel colours and figures from classical mythology present throughout. As well as the Konzerthausorchester, the venue plays host to many other famous orchestras and soloists. It was also a favourite of the American composer and conductor, Leonard Bernstein. Books, CDs and postcards are available to buy from the foyer and box office and there is also a café with both indoor and outdoor seating.\n\n56. This late 17th-century square is framed by three of Berlin’s architectural gems; the Franzö- sischer Dom (French Cathedral) to the north, the Konzerthaus to the east and the Deutscher Dom (German Cathedral) to the south. The name Gerdarmen- markt comes from the French Huguenot Gens d’Armes regi- ment, who used the land for stables in the 18th century. The square was heavily bombed dur- ing World War II, and later un- derwent extensive reconstruc- tion. Under the DDR, the square was renamed Platz der Akademie (after the Academy of Sciences), but reverted back to its origi- nal name after Reunification.

After being bombed during World War II it was rebuilt in 1993, whereby the interior was remodelled to house an exhibition on democracy in Germany. Despite its name, the church (like the Französischer Dom) was never a cathedral in the traditional sense and instead gets its name from its domed tower. By Emma Dennison FEATURE GENDARMENMARKT 56\n\n57. The Französischer Dom was built between 1701 and 1705 by the community of French Huguenot refugees. They came to Berlin at the invitation of Friedrich III af- ter they were exiled from France in 1699. The building was modelled on the Hu- guenot church in Cha- renton, France, which had been destroyed in 1688. Like those of the Deutscher Dom, the Franzosischer Dom’s Co- rinthian porticoes, tower and dome were added in 1785. This provides the square with a pleasing symmetry. As well as still being a place of worship and a concert venue, the com- plex also houses the Huguenot museum and a viewing platform. In the centre of the square, in front of the neo-classical Konzer- thaus, there is a white marble statue of German poet Friedrich Schiller. The head of the statue was copied from an earlier bust by Johann Heinrich Dannecker. The pedestal is decorated with figures representing Lyric Poetry, Drama, History and Philosophy. Erected in 1869 and designed by Reinhold Begas, the statue was removed by the Nazis in the 1930s and was not replaced until 1988. The square is home to many buzzing restaurants and ca- fés, and is conve- niently located near to the shopping hub of Friedrichstraße. The many benches and green spaces make it an ide- al spot for people-watching and several buskers are on hand to keep you entertained. It’s also a feature on many walking and cy- cling tours, ensuring there’s always a varied crowd. 57 “The many benches and green spaces make it an ide- al spot for peo- ple-watching”\n\n58. 58 MONSTERKABINETT Rosenthaler Strasse 39 10178 Berlin 16.00-22.00 Fri and Sat Thurs 18.00-22.00 S Wienmeisterstrasse U Hackescher Markt Standard 8.00€ Concessions 5.00€ www.monsterkabinett.de Located among the remnants of the former East Berlin is the nightmarish art display Monsterkabinett.

There are also thought-provoking works of art and commemorative spaces such as the Garden of Exile, an outdoor courtyard with tall grey columns topped by olive trees, the Holocaust Tower, a 24-metre- high empty space, and the Memory Void, with 10,000 carved bronze faces which stare up at you as you step over them. Remembering the Holocaust is a complex process and one that has taken years to develop. But Libeskind has done a remarkable job and it is no wonder that 350,000 people visited the museum’s empty shell before it opened in September 2001. An audio guide is just 3€ and offers an excellent insight into the thought process behind the museum.

The museum now occupies the former workshop it documents and recounts Weidt’s personal stories and those of his employees, most of whom were blind or deaf Jews. Non-jewish himself, Weidt opposed the Nazi regime and took it upon himself to help those he could. Through employment in his workshop, many of his workers avoided deportation to concentration camps as their work of manufacturing brooms and brushes was deemed vital for the war effort. During the war it became ever more difficult to avoid persecution and so Weidt took radical action. Forging identity cards with fake German names meant workers like Inge Deutschkron could escape to a new life abroad. Others weren’t as fortunate. Before being discovered by the Gestapo, the Jewish Horn Family took shelter in the secret, dark, windowless room at the back of the workshop. That same room now forms what is perhaps the most poignant piece in the exhibition. Glass cabinets line the whitewashed walls of the other rooms and are filled with documents, letters and photographs. Audio-guides and computer stations further explain the exhibition and aid the aforementioned in recounting the museum’s history. Uniqueinsettingandcomprehensive in its artefacts, this museum does well to narrate the incredible story of the bravery of a humble workshop owner.

Considered as one of the most important institutions between 1933 and 1945, these were the headquarters of the Secret State Police (Gestapo), the Reich SS Leadership and Security Service (SD) of the SS and the Reich Security Main Office from 1939. Opened in 2010, this site is divided into three exhibition areas. Located inside the building is the Topography of Terror: Gestapo, SS & Reich Security Main Office on Wilhem- & Prinz-Albrecht-Straße exhibition, situated outside is the Berlin 1933 – 1945: Between Propaganda and Terror exhibition and the Berlin Wall Monument that spans Topography of Terror approximately 200 meters. Inside, with a combination of photographic materials and documents, this exhibition retells the rise of the horrid Nazi regime and the terrors, persecutions and exterminations they carried out on the many victimised groups throughout Europe. Computer stations, reading folders, audios and film recordings are also provided to give extra in-depth information. Outside, along exposed cellar wall remains, panels are hung explaining the humiliations and brutal killings of victims who were accused of being anti-government. A free English guided tour is also available on every Sunday at 3.30pm.

Situated behind the Berliner Dom, not far from the Museum Island, the DDR Museum is one of the most popular interac- tive exhibitions in the world. The visitor has to get involved and in- teract with the exhibits, to handle objects and to look behind drawers and doors. In the building there are two main rooms, plus a typical socialist flat in which you can relax and watch original TV programmes from the GDR. Each room is divided into different sections by slabs, which function as both room dividers and as showcas- es - with drawers and doors to open and objects to look at and touch. At first the grey colour of the slabs gives a feeling of monotony and sad- ness, but the rooms are made more lively and colourful thanks to the red columns and ceiling where many slogans and mottos are written. Last but not least, do make sure to get a picture of yourself driving one of the old East German Trabant cars - a very funny souvenir of your visit!\n\n66. 66 Cora-Berliner-Straße 1, 10117 Berlin U Brandenburger Tor (Apr - Sept) Tue - Sun 10.00 - 20.00 | (Oct - Mar) Tue-Sun 10.00 - 19.00 www.stiftung-denkmal.de This memorial is open to a myriad of interpretations and the underground information centre, located at the site’s eastern edge, tells the story of the unimaginable Holocaust. Architecturally, the information centre’s strongest feature is the coffered concrete ceiling which echoes the patterns of the memorial’s towering pillars. The exhibition begins with a visual timeline which outlines the events from the National Socialists’ rise to power in 1933 to the mass genocide. The exhibition is divided into four roomswhicheachconfrontpersonal aspects of the tragedy: the individual families, the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe Information Centre geographical extent of the crime sites, letters thrown by people aboard the one-way death camp trains, and the anguish felt by a mourning mother. One can feel oneself sink completely into the victims’ stories, and the way in which their normal lives were obliterated. The haunting silence is broken only by a recording reading the names and brief biographies of the six million known innocent victims. Upon exiting, the words of Auschwitz survivor Primo Levi: “It happened, therefore it can happen again” remind us that the threat of genocide continues to be a reality in some parts of the world today.

DIE AUSSTELLUNG ZUR DDR-STAATSICHERHEIT STASI. Exhibition on GDR State Security By Thomas Bamford Zimmerstraße 90 | 10117 Berlin U: Kochstrasse | Stadtmitte +49 (0)302324-7951 You are being watched! This exhibition documents the immense espionage undertaken by the Stasi against GDR citizens, when the walls really did have ears. Packed into a relatively small area, the exhibition is split into three main sections: the operation of the Ministry of State Security, biographies and the subsequent ‘processing’ of those deemed ‘subversive,’ and finally the Ministry for State Security and Everyday Life. The collection claims that 1.44 million photos, 111km of written documents and 59 million file cards were recovered from the records of the Ministry for State Security. The exhibition chronicles their recovery and the help given by infuriated citizens, who occupied Ministry offices and secured the remaining documents as staff attempted to destroy them. This deeply unsettling exhibition gives an insight into the sheer scope of the reconnaissance, and into the paranoia and inertia that accompanied the state’s omnipresence in the GDR. Perhaps most unnerving is the section on ‘unofficial staff’ - informants who reported on all areas of society, and even supplied delicate information on their colleagues, friends and fellow students. The meetings between informants and the Stasi, undertaken in clandestine apartments, sound more like something from a John Le Carré novel than genuine historical events. Well worth a visit.\n\n68. This imposing museum, designed by German architect Alfred Messel and built between 1910 and 1930, houses exhibits discovered by Ger- man archaeologists in the Near and Middle East. The Pergamon consists of three sections: the Col- lection of Classical Antiquities, the Museum of the Ancient Near East and the Museum of Islamic Art. As the museum is very popular the queuetobuyticketscanbequitelong, so if you’re short on time it’s worth buying your tickets in advance. Free audio guides are available in several languages and give detailed insights into many of the exhibits. The first thing you will see when en- tering the Collection of Classical An- tiquities is the PergamonAltar. This stunning edifice originally stood on the Acropolis of Pergamon, a city in what is now Turkey, and was built around 160 BC. You can climb up the altar’s rather steep Bodestraße 1-3 |Mitte 10179 S Hackescher Markt | S+U Fried- richstraße Mon-Wed, Fri-Sun 10.00-18.00 Thurs 10.00-20.00 14€ standard | 7€ concessions (1€ discount if bought online in advance) www.smb.museum steps to the Telephos hall, an inner courtyard whose friezes tell the sto- ry of Telephos, the mythical founder of Pergamon. The Roman Architec- ture room, with its mosaic floor and Miletian market gate and the Traja- neum hall complete the Collection. Visitors to the Museum of the An- cient Near East are greeted by the immense Ishtar Gate of Babylon. By Emma Dennison FEATURE PERGAMON MUSEUM 68\n\n69. Magnificent and vividly coloured, it is hard to believe that what you see here is only a small part of the 180-metre-long Procession- al Way originally located in the ancient city of Babylon. Other highlights include guardianstatuesandtablets from anAssyrian palace and other fascinating artefacts from what are now Iraq, Syria, Persia and Anatolia. Situated on the first floor is the Museum of Islamic Art. The exhibits are presented in chronological order, rang- ing in date from the 7th to the 17th centuries. Ornate- ly decorated Seljuk prayer niches, a 13th century Alhambra dome and a section of the never completed Mshatta palace are among the Mu- seum’s most impressive exhibits. However, the most interesting is the 17th century Syrian Aleppo Room, a panelled reception room from the home of a Christian merchant. The pan- els, decorated with Biblical scenes, were set in the style of an Islamic book to en- sure members of all faiths felt at home. The Pergamon Muse- um’s collections are so extensive that it would be wise to devote a whole day to fully expe- riencing them. Plenty of seating is available if you wish to pause and contemplate an exhibit and a bookshop offers a wide range of related literature. “The museum’s collections are so extensive that it would be wise to de- vote a whole day to fully ex- perience them” 69\n\n70. 70 DEUTSCHES HISTORISCHES MUSEUM Unter den Linden 2 | 10117 Ber- lin U Friedrichstraße Mon-Sun 10.00-18.00 8.00€ standard | 4.00€ for concessions www.dhm.de When entering this museum there are a few things you should remember: a student card, it halves the entrance fee to just 4 euros, a camera, to record the iconic historical artefacts as well as time and patience as the museum is large and there is a lot of information to absorb. To save carrying around heavy back packs or bags, a free cloak room is available and rather useful. The large building is not particularly easy to navigate around so an audio guide for 3.00€ is recommended. Starting on the ground floor, you will find Germanys more recent history dating from the World German History Museum Wars up until the re-unification of East and West Berlin. The permanent exhibition is filled with endless memorabilia and items including books, posters, cars and soldier uniforms. The majority of items on display are thought- provoking while others are utterly jaw dropping. A few paintings can be found downstairs which capture a shocking portrayal of the war. For more dated history, there is a lot to see in the maze upstairs. A variety of large paintings and artwork can be found alongside statues, clothes and armour.

Jump into the rocking world of The Ramones! Considered by many as the world’s first Punk Rock group, The Ramones have proved a seminal influence in Punk on both sides of the Atlantic. The self-proclaimed ‘first and only Ramones museum’ on Krausnickstaße is home to an eclectic and somewhat peculiar mix of memorabilia. Items such as Johnny Ramones stage ripped blue Levi’s (34/32”, in case you’re interested), the ubiquitous battered white converse (as worn by Marky Ramone) along with items such as Dee-Dee Ramones Coroners report from 2002, recorded as death by misadventure – dying of a heroin overdose, all complete the biography of the band. The small museum, hidden behind the RMCM coffee shop packs photographs of the band in their infancy taken by Danny Fields (Ramones tour manager from 1975- 1988) shows an intimate side to the band, far removed from their laissez faire/über cool stage persona. Best advice for those unfamiliar with the band? Enjoy a drink (5 euros with entry) in the amiable and friendly bar area and flick through the free leaflet provided entitled ‘Rob Freeman on Recording Ramones’ in order to get a closer perspective on the band, their philosophy and recording traits. Best thing about the museum? The Ramones tunes blasting out loud and true just how the band would have wanted them played.\n\n72. 72 Museum of Musical Instruments By Emma Dennison Tiergartenstraße 1 | Tiergarten 10785 U+S Potsdamer Platz | U Men- delssohn-Bartholdy-Park Tues, Wed, Fri 9.00-17.00|Thurs 9.00-20.00 | Sat, Sun 10.00-17.00 4€ Standard| 2€ concessions| Tour (Sat 11.00, Thurs 18.00) 3€ www.sim.spk-berlin.de/mim_3. html Situated in the Kulturforum, adjacent to the Philharmonie, this museum is a must for music lovers.

Its spacious, light-flooded interior was redeveloped in the 1990s after lying empty since being bombed in World War II. The space now houses an exhibition, run by the Bundestag, on German parliamentary history from the late 18th century to the present day. The exhibition progresses chronologically: the ground floor covers 1789-1848 and a mezzanine (currently under construction) details the Federal Republic’s parliamentary system. Continuing up the spiral staircase, the second floor focusses on Imperial and Weimar Germany and the third on the Nazi state and the GDR. The fourth floor explores women’s role in German politics and Germany’s place in Europe and houses a small cinema where informative films are shown at 14.00. The fifth floor is concerned with the history of German parliamentary architecture and the history of the Deutscher Dom itself is discussed inside the dome. The main information panels are only in German, however tours in English or French are available on requestandtherearesheetswithkey details in all three languages. Even so, the wealth of visual information and striking interior make the exhibition well worth a visit.\n\n74. Situated at the heart of Museum Island, the Neues Museum is sand- wiched between the Pergamonmu- seum and the Altes Museum. The museum was built by Prussian architect and builder Friedrich August Stüler between 1843 and 1855, making it the second oldest museum on Museum Island. After being heavily damaged during the World War II, the museum’s re- construction was overseen by Eng- lish architect David Chipperfield. The building reopened in 2009, and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. It houses the world-renowned Egyptian Museum, which contains 2500 ancient Egyptian artefacts and a collection of 200 papyruses.
