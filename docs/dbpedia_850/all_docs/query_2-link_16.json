        "text": "Berlin is a city where the delicate threads of Jewish history and culture interweave into an intricate web. Some places stand as a stark reminder of the obliteration of what was once vibrant Jewish life. The Wannsee villa, the loading ramp at Grunewald S-Bahn station and the \"Topography of Terror\" permanent exhibition. Others are testimonies of the Jewish past � Ephraim- Palais, the New Synagogue, Jewish cemeteries in Mitte and Weißensee � or the focus of its Jewish present: the Jewish Community Centre, the offices of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, seven active synagogues, the Jewish \"Volkshochschule\" and the Jewish Museum.\n\nHow to get there: U-Bahn and S-Bahn station Friedrichstrasse; S-Bahn station Hackesche Markt, Bus numbers 100, 157, 348 (Lustgarten), 147 (Universitätsstrasse)\n\nOranienburger Straße\n\nVisitors to the area around Oranienburger Straße will find several Jewish institutions, a number of restaurants and cafés offering Jewish specialities, a Jewish gallery and the kosher restaurant Beth- Café, which is operated by the Adass Jisroel Community.
