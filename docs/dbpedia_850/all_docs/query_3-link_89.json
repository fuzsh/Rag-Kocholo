        "text": "We are going to spend next couple of weeks at home, but fortunately we can attend online events, and they are going to be fantastic. I would like to introduce to you three big film festivals that will take time this winter.\n\nSundance Film Festival 28.01-3.03.2001\n\nhttps://festival.sundance.org/\n\nABOUT: The Sundance Film Festival is an annual film festival organized by the Sundance Institute. It takes place each January in Park City, Utah, Salt Lake City, and at the Sundance Resort, and is the largest independent film festival in the United States.\n\nHOW TO ATTEND: in order to be able to watch any films from this festival, you need a VPN based in USA. Sing up for the website and buy tickets for specific screening or a full day pass. Tickets are selling fast.\n\nhttps://htf.festival.sundance.org/ here it is explained how it works\n\nTOP 5\n\nNew Year’s Eve 1999. Twenty-year-old Sebastian, armed with a gun, hijacks a TV studio and takes two hostages—a famous TV presenter and a security guard. His plan? No one seems to know, including Sebastian himself. His demand to deliver his message, whatever that may be, via live broadcast is repeatedly thwarted by an uncertain police force and an egotistical network chairman. As the night wears on, Sebastian and the hostages bond in unexpected ways, while those in power fumble to restore order.\n\nGiovana and Yago are strangers who share a spark after meeting at a party. When a deadly cloud mysteriously takes over their city, they are forced to seek shelter with only each other for company. As months pass and the planet settles into an extended quarantine, their world shrinks, and they are forced to come to terms with an accelerated timeline for their relationship.\n\nOn the day an asteroid is scheduled to obliterate Earth, freewheeling Liza (Zoe Lister-Jones) scores an invite to one last wild gathering before it all goes down. Making it to the party won’t be easy, though, after her car is unceremoniously stolen, and the clock is ticking on her plan to tie up loose ends with friends and family. With a little help from her whimsical younger self (Cailee Spaeny), Liza embarks on a journey by foot across Los Angeles as she seeks to make peace with her regrets—and find the right company for those last few hours.\n\nThirteen-year-old Sammy is struggling to cope with the death of her mother. After she is caught vandalizing one of her school’s restrooms, her father, fed up with her wild behavior, enrolls her in a summer course—if she fails, she’ll be sent to a boot camp for delinquent youth. After storming out of her first class, Sammy meets Margot, a surly magician. Margot forces Sammy to be her assistant for a performance, and although Sammy seems uninterested, she seeks Margot out after the show and asks to become Margot’s pupil. Margot agrees, and as their unlikely friendship grows, we learn that she and Sammy understand each other more than they expected.\n\nIn eighteenth-century upstate New York, Abigail (Katherine Waterston) is increasingly defeated by grief and the drudgery of rural life. Her deference and propriety maintain a mundane equilibrium with her husband, Dyer (Casey Affleck), but her narrated diaries offer a picture into a richer internal life. When spring brings newcomers Tallie (Vanessa Kirby) and husband Finney (Christopher Abbott) to the otherwise empty landscape, the journal entries frantically anticipate—and then enthusiastically document—an affair with Tallie. As menial machinations are interrupted and patriarchal sovereignty is questioned, both marriages buckle.\n\nGöteborg Film Festival 29.01-8.02.2021\n\nhttps://goteborgfilmfestival.se/en/?switch=true\n\nABOUT: Gothenburg International Film Festival, is the largest film event in Scandinavia. When it was launched in 1979 it showed 17 films on 3 screens and had 3,000 visitors. Today, the film festival takes place over 10 days each year at the end of January and beginning of February. In later years around 450 films from 60 countries are screened for 115,000 visitors.\n\nHOW TO ATTEND: again start with VPN based in Sweden. This festival is a much cheaper offer than American Sundance. You can buy access to all the film for only 30 euros and the whole event last 11 days. The only problem is, that not every movie is in English and it is not precise which films will only have Swedish subtitles. After you log in, you can purchase the pass, that you can activate with the code on their special vod platform called Draken Film.\n\nhttps://drakenfilm.se/goteborg-film-festival-2021\n\nTOP 5\n\nFinnish biograpfical film of Swedo-Finnish author and illustrator Tove Jansoon, creator of the Moomins . The movie centers on her early life, dating back to the wartime to the mid-1950s, showing both her personal relationships with people such as Vivica Bandler and Atos Wirtanenm and the creation of the Moomin Character, and the popular book series.\n\nBest European film and best European actor ( Mads Mikkelsen) of 2020. Four high school teachers consume alcohol on a daily basis to see how it affects their social and professional lives.\n\nFLEE tells the extraordinary true story of a man, Amin, on the verge of marriage which compels him to reveal his hidden past for the first time. A secret he has been hiding for over twenty years threatens to ruin the life he has built for himself. He recounts his dramatic journey as a child refugee from Afghanistan to Denmark. Told mostly through animation, FLEE weaves together a stunning tapestry of images and memories to tell the deeply affecting and original story of a young man grappling with his traumatic past in order to find his true self and the meaning of home.\n\nThe story, revolves around Bella, a young and ambitious 20-year-old girl who travels from Sweden to Los Angeles to become the next big porn star. Ninja described Pleasure as “a film about ambition and feminism, set in one of the world’s most patriarchal structures”.\n\nA closeted gay teen and his lesbian counterpart pretend to be a couple to avoid suspicion.\n\nINTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL ROTTERDAM 1.02-7.02.2021\n\nhttps://iffr.com/en\n\nABOUT: The International Film Festival Rotterdam is an annual film festival held at the end of January in various locations in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Since its foundation in 1972, it has maintained a focus on independent and experimental filmmaking by showcasing emerging talents and established auteurs.\n\nHOW TO ATTEND: Full programme with timeline, tickets options and its prices will be announce on 22.01.2021. As it works with any other festivals, again a VPN from Netherland will be needed. This time all movies should have English subtitles. There are many titles already announced.\n\nTOP 5\n\nAfter a weird night, five bored, super-rich friends find out they are vampires. Panic! Is this really what they have become? Can they still trust one another? Each and every one goes to extreme lengths to find out. This take on the vampire genre plays generously with societal tension and expectations at a meta level. The opulent but eerie locations and impressive cityscapes are mesmerizing, yet function as a backdrop for themes such as violence, isolation and innocence.\n\nSylwia is a fitness phenomenon and influencer. She has hundreds of thousands of followers, a beautiful apartment and a dog, Jackson. Her whole life is about workouts, posting and her bond with her loyal supporters. She shares everything with them – even her despair and loneliness, something her manager doesn’t take kindly to. Her perfect life is upended when she is confronted by a stalker, a pathetic man with whom she shares more than she would care to admit.\n\nThey are known as the ‘The Witches of the Orient’: the Japanese women’s volleyball team who won Olympic gold at the 1964 Games in Tokyo. They started out as the team of a textile factory, winning victory after victory, and their record of 258 successive wins remains unbeaten to this day. The team were so popular that a whole raft of manga characters, cartoons and anime series was based on them. Julien Faraut’s sparkling documentary makes use of fantastic manga and anime sequences, such as Attack no 1 (1968), with archival footage of blood-curdling matches and extreme training sessions, driven by rhythmic editing and great music from French musician K-Raw.\n\nThe matriarchal clan led by gorgeous Margarita (Renata Litvinova) enters a turbulent period when her son loses his beloved fiancée. Using the structure of a repetitive ritual, the action spans years but takes place mostly during the annual gatherings of Margarita’s extraordinary family in their mansion on New Year’s Eve. Margarita believes in the magical 13th hour that can break the eternal circle of repetition, defeat death and bring her much-awaited love.\n\nAs We Like It, a reworking of Shakespeare’s play, tells of the love blossoming between Orlando and Rosalind, who is disguised as a man. Filmmakers Chen Hung-i and Muni Wei opted for the lovebirds to be played by women, thereby referencing Shakespeare’s era when women were banned from the stage and all roles were played by men. This colourful, energetic film follows Orlando and Rosalind and three other potential couples in their search for one another. All set in an internet-free neighbourhood in the bustling metropolis of Taipei where there is no rush and people consciously live together.\n\nBerlinale, the famous Berlin based film festival, will take place at the beginning of March. Exact dates and programme is not announce yet.\n\nThis year the Best polish film festival join hands together with the American film festival to create an amazing line up for its first online edition. Expect hits shown previously in festivals like Berlinale, Cannes, Venice, Sundance, Toronto, Locarno, San Sebastian at once.\n\nSave the date: from 5th to 15th of November!\n\nWHAT IS THE FESTIVAL ABOUT?\n\nFrancois Ozon, Christi Puiu, Roy Andersson, Tsai Ming Liang, Spike Lee, Michel Franco, Albert Serra, Abel Ferrara and many more amazing directors are showing their latest productions. It is your best opportunity to catch up with the awarded films from biggest film festivals in the world. It is also an amazing opportunity to discover new names and get inspired by their visual language.\n\nNew Horizons Film Festival\n\nhttps://www.nowehoryzonty.pl/index.do?lang=en\n\nA ten days film festival, that normally takes place is in late July in Wroclaw- Poland. This is a festival of cinema visionaries, adamant artists, brave enough to follow their own path against the trends and to talk about the most important matters, using their own, unique language. One of the key components of the festival’s mission is to present the achievements of the cinema masters and discover the works of those artists, who are less known, yet their work is of a tremendous importance for the creators of the festival. Trust me, you won’t be disappointed by their selections.\n\nAmerican Film Festival\n\nhttps://www.americanfilmfestival.pl/?lang=en\n\nAmerican Film Festival (AFF), taking place since 2010 and the first film event in Central Europe solely devoted to the works of contemporary and classic American cinema, takes place in the cultural heritage city of Wroclaw, Poland and is organized by New Horizons Association.\n\nPROGRAM\n\nThere is around 140 feature films and 40 shorts in the program. I prepared a top 15 of both New Horizons and Americana Film Festival. You can find full program in the link below.\n\nhttps://www.nowehoryzonty.pl/menu.do?m=program\n\nMosquito State- Filip Jan Rymsza\n\nA psychological and entomological thriller in which the fate of the main character, a stock market analyst, intertwines with that of a certain mosquito brought by chance to an exclusive party. Among the rich and beautiful blood donors, the insect chooses—also by chance— a mathematical genius (who also happens to be a reclusive oddball), Richard Boca.\n\n2. Quo Vadis Aida- Jasmila Zbanic\n\nJasmila Žbanić shows in this moving drama—a hit at the Venice Festival—one of the darkest pages in modern European history: the Srebrenica massacre. The main character is a translator (Jasna Duričić), someone who, between lost pages, is trying to unite a world on its way to annihilation. Instead of the classic male optics of war, we see the less common view of women: the main protagonist and the Bosnian director, who was born in Sarajevo. This is a film that will sear itself into the mind, cut to the quick, and claw at the heart. It does this not through shock therapy, but subtly, thanks to a well-thought-out structure, sensational directing.\n\n3. Servants- Ivan Ostrochovsky\n\nThis Eastern Europeannoir sheds light on the dark episodes of Czechoslovak history to bring current problems out of the shadows. The eponymous Servants are party apparatchiks as well as the boys and their guardian priests with cassocks fluttering on the stairs of the Prague seminary. Those who serve the state are in conflict with those who serve God, but Ostrochovský’s black-and-white film is by no means a naive tale of the struggle between light and darkness in service of the truth. Set in the 1980s, the story explores the gray area of political gamesmanship, cynicism and compromises, exposing the mechanisms that govern totalitarian structures.\n\n4. The 20th Century- Matthew Rankin\n\nThis film could have been made by Wes Anderson if he was a more predatory and subversive director, or Ken Russell, if he were interested in statesmen on par with other great directors. Matthew Rankin’s film tells the partially fictionalized story of young William Lyon Mackenzie King, the three-time Prime Minister of Canada, which the director wrote by reading between the lines of the future politician’s diary, one filled with anguish and shame for unspecified transgressions.\n\n5. Freedom- Albert Serra\n\nWinner of a Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Festival, this is an ode to refined decadence that, according to Serra, has particularly European roots. Thanks to libertarian values, it was only in Europe that society dared to place the aesthetics of pleasure above morality. “I wanted to make a film about the night,” said the director, “not one that takes place at night but a film about the logic of the night that changes our perception, moral principles, everything. A film about the utopia of sexual liberation, when the differences between people disappear: there are no women or men, no servants or masters, no beautiful people or ugly people. About a perfect, strange, dark utopia—a brotherhood of bodies.”\n\n6. Raving Riot- Stepan Polivanov\n\nThe police raided two Tbilisi clubs—Cafe Gallery and Bassiani—in May 2018 as part of a drug enforcement operation. Dozens of people were detained, and a two-day protest rave began in front of the former parliament building—an iconic location for Georgia’s tradition of protest—under the slogan “We dance together, we fight together,” which ended with the government’s promise to liberalize drug laws. In Polivanov’s documentary, shot in the spirit of a coming-of-age film, young people—for whom techno is a part of life, and opposition, a natural reaction to the incursion of power into their independent space—realize they have the political power to effect change.\n\n7. Dear Comrades- Andrey Konchalovskiy\n\nIn this black and white drama about his parents’ generation, those who survived World War II and completely trusted communism, Andrei Konchalovsky portrays the communist elite during a 1962 strike in Novocerkask. The true tragic story was made public only in the 1990s. The protagonist of Dear Companions is the party leader Ludmila, privileged enough to turn a blind eye to the shortcomings of the socialist motherland, until, that is, a bloody suppression of the strike in the local factory takes so many lives, one of whom is Ludmila’s daughter.\n\n8. The Whaler Boy- Philipp Yuryev\n\nA fatal infatuation, the American dream, and a sex chat on the Russian frontier—a teenage whaler from Chukotka is smitten with a girl for the first time. It’s unfortunate that shy Leshka’s chosen one goes by the name of HollySweet999 and happens to be a stripper from Detroit who appears on one of the many erotic sites online. The young man stares at her digital image every free moment he gets, practices English words from a children’s book, and listens to stories about those who risked their dull everyday lives—they crossed the Bering Strait, the 100-kilometer-wide stretch separating Russia from America—for a fantasy about a better tomorrow.\n\n9. Last and First Men- Johann Johannsson\n\nA message from the future breaks through the veil of time. A gentle and kind voice speaks of what awaits humanity in many millions of years: evolutionary changes and an inevitable catastrophe. The prophetic words are accompanied by apocalyptic visions. We see successive monuments with fantastic shapes that rise in the vast wasteland, apparently abandoned by their builders. The posthumous directorial debut of the composer Jóhann Jóhannsson is an avant-garde science fiction spectacle, reminiscent of Chris Marker’s classic, La Jetée.\n\n10. Malmkrog- Cristi Puiu\n\nProbably the most audacious film by the leading filmmaker of the Romanian New Wave. Up until now, Cristi Puiu has shot hyperrealistic dramas about timely subjects. This time, however, he’s made a nearly three-and-a-half-hour-long philosophical costume drama inspired by a novel by the Russian Vladimir Solovyov. Malmkrog, with its precise choreography and set design, gives the impression of being static, but it just appears that way, as Puiu has created a devilish multilayered film much like a Russian nesting doll. Every little detail matters: the symbolism of the color of the wardrobe and the paintings hanging on the walls of the living room where the protagonists, representatives of the Russian aristocracy, conduct lively discussions about God, humanity, war, peace, good, evil, violence, and forgiveness.\n\n11. She Dies Tomorrow\n\nAmy moves into a new home, but she’s unable to get comfortable there. She wanders around from room to room, listens to the same recording of Mozart’s Requiem over and over again, and we get the feeling that something bad is about to happen … And something bad does happen, in fact. When a concerned friend visits her that evening, Amy has something to tell her: she’s going to die the next day. Irrevocably and inevitably, it’s simply going to happen. What do you do with this information? How do you keep it from getting stuck in your head? In Amy Seimetz’s film, this painful thought is transmitted like a virus, and more and more people start facing a vision of their own death.\n\n12. Fanny Lye Deliver’d- Thomas Clay\n\nEngland under Oliver Cromwell in the 17th century. A woman named Fanny Lye lives on a farm with her husband and son. Humble and God-fearing, she is soon to be saved from the shackles of a puritanical life thanks to a pair of libertines who show up at her house, fleeing the ruthless long arm of the law. In Fanny Lye Deliver’d, Thomas Clay discusses the formation of radical new attitudes regarded as shameful but heralding future norms. Although on-screen events are set at a specific moment in the past, the whole has little in common with typical period pieces. Clay’s film is an eccentric hybrid with elements of a folk horror and a home-invasion thriller.\n\n13. Ema- Pablo Lorrain\n\nWhite-haired, flexible Ema kindles a fire everywhere she appears; she seduces and destroys, dangerously approaches and retreats imperceptibly. The blaze that Pablo Larraín’s new movie kindles on screen begins with a controversial decision by Ema and her husband Gaston who decide to give up their adopted son as the boy has become aggressive and dangerous. The spouses end up blaming each other for abandoning the child, leading to the breakdown of their relationship, but also the implosion of the dance group in which Gaston works as a choreographer and Ema as a dancer. Ema hits the energetically colorful streets of Valparaiso with her friends to dance the sexual, sensual, but also violent and aggressive reggaeton.\n\n14. Night of The Kings- Philippe Lacote\n\nA film-ritual that invites viewers to take part in a ceremony in which a dramatic struggle for power is won by … poetry. Set at the La Maca prison in Abidjan, the film transports us into a stuffy, overcrowded, tension-filled labyrinth. This is a place governed by its own gangster code and with its own rulers in charge of maintaining the fragile balance. When Roman ends up behind bars, the issue of choosing a successor to Barbe Noire, who is losing strength and, with it, power, is about to be settled. Like hyenas, the self-proclaimed heirs wait to inherit the throne; a bloody gang war is brewing. In order to gain time, Barbe Noire orders Roman to tell a story without interruption throughout the night.\n\n15. Patrick- Tim Mielants\n\nPatrick is special. The 40-year-old man that lives with his parents at a nudist campsite kind of special. Extremely introverted and devoid of ambition, he most often stays in the comfort of his workshop, where he devotes himself to his hobby of building furniture. We meet him at the dawn of a difficult time in his life when first his hammer disappears, which is followed by the death of his father. Unable to resurrect his dad, he desperately tries to recover the missing tool. Patrick’s adventures look all the more curious as he stays naked most of the time, just like almost everyone around him, with a copiousness of torsos, stomachs, groins, and buttocks parading around the screen.\n\nHOW CAN I WATCH MOVIES\n\nBoth festivals take place between 5-15.11.2020.

In 2020 there are more than 100 events, showcasing more than 500 photographers. Below you can find the highlights of EMOP:\n\nGROUP SHOWS\n\nFOAM TALENT 2020\n\nShaping the future of photography.\n\nFoam is an internationally operational organization in the field of photography, based in the center of Amsterdam. For the very first time, Foam is showing its annual ‘Foam Talent’ exhibition in the historical building of Kühlhaus Berlin. Foam presents all facets of contemporary photography by organizing a range of activities with a focus on young talent.\n\nMasculinities- Liberation through photography\n\n‘Masculinities: Liberation through Photography’ explores the ways in which masculinity has been experienced, performed, and socially constructed from the 1960s to the present day. At a time when ideas around masculinity are undergoing a global crisis and concepts such as ‘toxic’ and ‘fragile’ masculinity are shaping social discourse, over 300 works by 50 international artists such as Laurie Anderson, Richard Avedon, Rotimi Fani-Kayode, Peter Hujar, Isaac Julien, Annette Messager, and Catherine Opie offer a panorama of filmic and photographic explorations of masculinity in all its contradictions and complexity.\n\nContinent- in search of Europe. An exhibition of Ostkreuz Agentur der Fotografen and Akademie der Kunste.\n\nIn 22 artistic works created especially for the project, OSTKREUZ photographers explore various aspects of European coexistence and take a look at personal, social, and political phenomena as well as basic structures and historical developments. Their approach to tackling complex subject matter is thereby always through images of people and their environment.\n\nBBA Photography prize 2020. Nominees and 2019 winner- Chirag Jindal.\n\nHeld annually by BBA Gallery, the ‘BBA Photography Prize’ is an international fine art photography competition open to anyone aged 18+, whatever their background and nationality. A jury of influential professionals look for the most innovative concepts, aesthetic language, and unique approach within the medium. Shortlisted entries are showcased in a group show and the winner is awarded a solo show.\n\nThe Independent Photographer- best of the year\n\n2019-2020.\n\nThe Independent Photographer is a monthly contest and online magazine dedicated to giving exposure to the work of photographers. The ambition is to discover upcoming talent and share the best in contemporary photography. The Annual Exhibition at CLB Berlin Gallery is the culmination of a year’s worth of photographic awards showcasing the work of 33 winning photographers. Each photographer was carefully selected this last year by a prestigious, expert panel of professionals from renowned agencies such as Magnum Photos, VII Agency, Vogue, and National Geographic.\n\nBerlin 1945-2000: A photographic subject.\n\n‘Berlin, 1945–2000: A Photographic Subject’ explores how German and international photographers captured Berlin between the immediate post-war years and the end of the twentieth century. Featuring the work by twenty-three photographers, the exhibition opens with black and white prints of Berlin in ruins and concludes with large-format color photographs of the capital’s post-fall-of-the-Wall urban development projects.\n\nGERMANS\n\nRoger Melis- Paris zu Fuss.\n\nPublished in 1986, the book PARIS by foot was the first example of an East German photographer making use of street photography exclusively to portray life in a foreign city. The work of Roger Melis, who is known first and foremost as a portrait and fashion photographer, it gained true cult status and 40,000 copies were sold.\n\nRenate Von Gebhardt photographs.\n\nRenate von Gebhardt (1921–2019), daughter of the writer Hertha von Gebhardt, was the influential editor-in-chief of children’s radio at RIAS Berlin throughout the post-war period. To this day, her RIAS show Der Onkel Tobias (Uncle Tobias) is considered a Berlin legend. Von Gebhardt never made a secret of her love for women, not even in the Adenauer period, with its strict conservatism and repressive notion of women. In the early 1950s, she simultaneously fell in love with four dancers from Mary Wigman’s school, whom she accompanied as a journalist on their tour with the Swiss companyCircus Knie, which had hired them to dance in a water ballet.\n\nThe Proletarian Eye. Worker’s photography of 1920’s by Kurt Pfannshmidt, Ernst Thormann and Richard Woike.\n\nTwenty-three years old and unemployed, Ernst Thormann decided to explore Berlin’s Scheunenviertel with the plate camera. His glass-plate photographs of the time, taken between the S-Bahn arches behind the Börse and Alexanderplatz train stations, are unique documents of everyday Jewish life in Berlin\n\nElective Affinities.\n\nRendezvous with women photographers 1900-1935.\n\nPhotographs by the art collector Thea Sternheim (1883–1971) offer insights into the world of an obsessive amateur photographer whose portraits include such casual images as those of Gottfried Benn and the pacifist Annette Kolb.\n\nRuth and Lotte Jacobi.\n\nThe exhibition brings together the photographic work of the sisters Lotte (1896–1990) and Ruth (1899–1995) Jacobi. Born into a dynasty of photographers, from 1931 on they ran the Fotoatelier Jacobi, located in Berlin’s ‘New West’ district around Kurfürstendamm, home to the city’s avant-garde.\n\nSven Marquardt- Stageless\n\nIn October 2019, Sven Marquardt took portraits of members of the international ensemble, Friedrichstadt­Palast Berlin, just after their performance. In some portraits, the posture and expression show the subject is still on an adrenaline high, whereas in others more intimate moments are revealed. Marquardt offers an unprettified take on transitions from the dramatic, mask­like stage character to the dancer’s tense, tired face after the show. Less than six months after the shoot, the portrayed artists lost their familiar stage, when all performances until December had to be cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWINGED. A fashion series by Esther Haase\n\nThe exhibition presents an unpublished selection from the ‘Beflügelt’ (Winged) series, born as a collaboration between fashion and experimental photography. The experiment began in 2014, when the fashion photographer Esther Haase (Hamburg / London) discovered and used first the IMAGO Camera in Berlin. Susanna Kraus, artist and operational head behind IMAGO put all of her skills in handling the IMAGO camera at her service. This was how Esther Haase explored the potential of combining professional fashion shoots and bulky, analog, 1: 1 photography in a single project.\n\nManfred Paul\n\nPhotographs are a frozen time\n\nPhotographs, according to Manfred Paul, who can look back over a wide-ranging oeuvre created over the past fifty years, ‘are frozen time’. The exhibition presents his intimate portraits, some of them mask-like, from the series Jutta Deutschland (1981–1984) and Steffi Scherzer (1997–2001). The images offer a look behind the scenes in Berlin’s opera houses during the 1980s and 1990s, and tell vivid stories of exceptional physical performance, exhaustion, and pride.\n\nRevision: Periphery as a Place\n\nThe Hellersdorf project.\n\nPhoto series by Helga Paris and Ulrich Wust.\n\nThe exhibition ‘Periphery as a Place – The Hellersdorf Project‘, organized by Ulrich Domröse (departing curator for photography at the Berlinische Galerie), was first shown at the nGbK in Kreuzberg over twenty years ago. Now, the nGbK presents two of the photo series from that exhibition –urban landscapes by Ulrich Wüst and portraits of young people by Helga Paris – at its satellite location in Hellersdorf, station urbaner kulturen. ‘REVISION‘ affords an opportunity for fresh discussion of the work and is complemented by additional works by both photographers\n\nRalf Marsault- Berlin years on the Wagenburg\n\nIn the 1980s Berlin became the epicenter of social experiments in rebellion against bourgeois lifestyles. Young people came from all across Europe to settle in the ‘Wagenburgen’ caravan colonies that occupied available vacant urban lots. Like the Tower of Babel, Berlin with its youth camps, cultural and linguistic mix, and alternative music scene opened up new horizons for the photographer Ralf Marsault, enabling him to continue the fin de siècle series of portraits of young anarchists, travelers, and punks that he had begun in Paris and London. His photographs do not document the caravan colonies as such, however, but rather conjure and orchestrate a reconfigured reality.\n\nMEET MY COUNTRY\n\nVisual Dialectics\n\nThe medium of photography in Hungarian art 1970-200\n\nThe exhibition examines the development of Hungarian photographic and photo-based artistic positions against the backdrop of state socialism and other European and East European realities in the last third of the twentieth century. In the 1960s and 1970s, the influence of Western European movements on Hungarian underground artists was largely indirect and shaped by local interpretations. Private travel and scholarships were rare, so direct contact with Western trends was limited.\n\nAmerica 1970’s/80’s\n\nAfter taking a full-time position with the French Vogue in 1961, Helmut Newton worked in parallel also for the fashion magazine’s American edition. After 1980, Newton shot numerous portraits of the ‘famous and infamous’, in and around Hollywood. Around the same time Joel Meyerowitz was shooting portraits in Provincetown, Massachusetts, using his large-format camera to capture images of like-minded free spirits, mostly outdoors. American photographer Sheila Metzner had a very close friendship with Helmut and June Newton. Finally, in ‘June’s Room’, we present photographs taken by Evelyn Hofer in New York in the 1960s and ’70s – a personal portrait of the city that includes street scenes and panoramas, interiors and portraits.\n\nLetizia Battalgia\n\nPalermo and the fight against The Mafia\n\nLetizia Battaglia is undoubtedly the most famous Italian photographer on the international scene. Her street views, portraits of women, and pictures of mafia murders tell the tale of her hometown Palermo – an al fresco film set. The whole of Palermo society is revealed through her lens: the rich, the poor, and the marginalized, the violence of life on its streets and squares.\n\nThe Time Between\n\nThe first part of this project by Romanian photographer Ioana Moldovan comprises photojournalism conducted between 2013 and 2016. It follows the refugees’ struggle for a safer life. The originally planned second part of the exhibition would have followed the present integration struggles of refugees living in social housing in Germany. Owing to the COVID-19 crisis, it could not take place. Instead, the artist rented a motorhome and travelled around Romania to document how people’s lives are being restricted by the pandemic. ‘It felt unnatural, doing documentary photography without getting close to people.’\n\nDrahotin Sulla: Photography\n\nDrahotín Šulla is one of the most important representatives of Slovak photography; his work can now be seen in a retrospective spanning nearly 60 years. In magical, large-format, black-and-white photographs, Šulla depicts scenes from everyday life as though they were pure poetry. The exhibition compiles images from the second half of the past century, the humanistic legacy of which continues to be relevant to this day.\n\nThe Masses\n\nThe exhibition presents photographs of various major events that have taken place in Europe between 1989 and 2011. On view are a wide array of crowds at protest marches, demonstrations, funerals, holiday celebrations, anniversaries, as well as at sporting events and concerts. ‘I focused on people and their emotions, their joys and fears. What they do. I have documented the tragedy of the civilian population. This is why I think that although my photography is considered to be war photography, it is really pacifist photography’, says photographer Krzysztof Miller.\n\nEurope in the 50’s\n\nThrough a soldier’s lens\n\nBill Perlmutter traveled in 1954 on assignment for the US Army through Europe. Europe in the ‚ Fifties. Through a Soldier’s Lens shows a selection of his images taken in Germany, France, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. The photographer’s view of war-torn Europe is direct and intuitive. The young GI sets out to start his coverage in a discreet manner, always conscious of his subjects’ privacy. With an open mind and obvious interest in people, he is witness to a Europe which is marked by visual reminders of the war fought ten years earlier.\n\nThe Border\n\n‘The border’ concerns itself with the conflict in Northern Ireland and explores current issues relating to the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will become an exterior European border following Brexit. Looking back to ‘the troubles’ – the civil war-like conflict between 1969 and 1998 – it is possible to understand how political tensions emerge, what dangers they harbour, and how fragile democratic societies can be. Northern Ireland, however, also represents how a violent conflict can be overcome.\n\nLes Enfants de la Frontiere sud\n\nThe children on the southern border\n\nAdventure, making money, taking drugs, surviving, growing up. They’ve cleared the first hurdles, and already they think they’ve made it. They’re fourteen, mostly a little older, but at times only nine or ten years old. When the fates of kids who are no longer children, but still far from adulthood, hit up against one of the world’s most strongly guarded borders. Hope, failure, progress: risking everything. These kids become tangled up in history’s intricate machinations. The descendants of a once-occupied people who resisted and were punished in the extreme are now knocking at our doors. The old colonial stigmata stick to them more stubbornly than the motor oil of the ships and trucks that offer them refuge on their path to the future.\n\nPioneers of skiing photography\n\nThe exhibition is the first ever to pay tribute to the most important pioneering œuvre in skiing photography. Swiss photographers Emanuel Gyger (1886–1951) and Arnold Klopfenstein (1896–1961) were masters at directing the interplay of light and shadow and using back lighting to dramatic effect. They perfected techniques for capturing dynamic movements and bringing them to life in still photos. Their unique style was due in part to the fact that Gyger was blind in one eye: as if through a camera’s viewfinder, he always saw the world in two dimensions.\n\nEvery year during springtime, around 50 galleries open their exhibitions by young and established artists and welcome numerous visitors from all over the world to Berlin. Here is a subjective guide to highlights of the postponed to September 16th Gallery Weekend.\n\nGallery Weekend is behind us, but you still have another weekends to check the Berlin Galleries best exhibitions of the year.

Alongside the video, Nogle will exhibit paintings, a found-object sculpture, a series of photographs from the 1990s, and a new group of large-scale vinyl banners.\n\nGALERIE BARBARA WEISS- Berta Fischer until 24.10.2020\n\nKohlfurter Straße 41/43, https://www.galeriebarbaraweiss.de/\n\nThe exhibition comprises a series of polychromatic sculptures, executed in acrylic-glass and other synthetic materials.\n\nKLEEM’S- Emilie Pitoiset “Maniac”, until 24.10.2020\n\nPrinzessinnenstraße 29, http://www.klemms-berlin.com/\n\nÉmilie Pitoiset is an artist and a choreographer, she studies pop culture episodes spanning from the middle-ages to nowadays. MANIAC is an exhibition inspired by the violence engendered by dance marathons. During the Great Depression in 1929 couples were dancing together until exhaustion, in exchange for money ( check book, movie “They shoot horses, don’t they?”). Pitoiset associated this crisis phenomenon with the 1980s and the cold war period,with the discovery of AIDS and the rise of conservative governments.\n\nKÖNIG GALERIE– Freidrisch Kunath “Sensitive Euro Man”. until 18.10.2020.\n\nAlexandrinenstraße 118-121, https://www.koeniggalerie.com/\n\nMaybe not the most exciting one, but you need to see the adapted nave of St Agnes church, where the main exposition room of the gallery is.\n\nKOW- Barbara Hammer “Would you like to meet your neighbor?”,\n\nuntil 7.11.2020 Lindenstraße 35, https://www.kow-berlin.com/kow\n\nAn interesting selection from the wide-ranging oeuvre of Barbara Hammer (1939– 2019), an American pioneer of experimental film, feminist art, and queer cinema. Just too good to miss. Take a stairs up to first floor.\n\nSchoneberg\n\nTANYA LEIGHTON- Brian Belott “Circa Skippy”, until 24.10.2020\n\nKurfürstenstraße 24/25, http://www.tanyaleighton.com/\n\nBrian Belott is resolutely innovative with materials and approaches, his studio drawing comparison to a chemistry lab. Pushing these combinations almost to the point of absurdity, Belott’s works incorporate and ultimately overwhelm everyday objects like box fans, calculators, socks, commercial freezers and more.\n\nTANJA WAGNER- Grit Richter “Mixed Feelings”– until 31.10.2020\n\nPohlstrasse 64, https://tanjawagner.com/\n\nGrit uses oils on stretched linen and fabric to create her anthropomorphic abstract forms. Experimentation is an important part of her practice and led Richter to create her unique technique of dying and bleaching black denim fabric onto which she paints and sculpts with. The result is the deeply textured elements that bend, fold and contrast in both foregrounds and backgrounds.\n\nESTHER SCHIPPER- Philippe Pareno “Manifestation” and Ugo Rondinone “Nuns and munks”, until 17.10.2020\n\nPotsdamer Strasse 81e, https://www.estherschipper.com/\n\nManifestations is Philippe Parreno’s eighth solo exhibition with Esther Schipper. It includes works spanning various media: a granular soundtrack, a CGI film, atmospheric sensors, robotic systems, computer code, ice and water.\n\nRondinone makes sculptures of what it means and feels like to see, whether this is understood to be a physical or metaphysical phenomenon. nuns + monks will continue to address the dual reflection between the inner self and the natural world.\n\nBARBARA WIEN- Nina Canell “Dits Dahs”, until 7.11.2020\n\nSchöneberger Ufer 65 (3rd Floor), http://www.barbarawien.de/\n\nThe exhibition title Dits Dahs, an oddly formed onomatopoeia, is borrowed from the two different signal durations of Morse code, called dots and dashes or dits and dahs. Canell incorporates real-time presence as an integral aspect of her sculptural situations – which are not an attempt to explain the world but to densify it with the impurities of process, the agency of materials and the unexpected directions in which they send our attention.\n\nPSM- Catherine Biocca “Milky Seas”, until 24.10.2020\n\nSchöneberger Ufer 61, http://www.psm-gallery.com/\n\nCatherine Biocca frequently shapes environments that insinuate total autonomy from the viewer’s reality. Her characters, often deemed recognizable as anthropomorphized assemblages, are consistently active and presently conscious within their surroundings.\n\nCHARLOTTENBURG\n\nCONTEMPORARY FINE ARTS- Tobias Spichtig “Pretty Fine”,\n\nuntil 26.09.2020\n\nGrolmanstraße 32/33, https://cfa-berlin.de/\n\nIn his first solo exhibition with the gallery Spichtig, who was born in Lucerne, Switzerland in 1982, combines new paintings and sculptures. Shell becomes essence, attitude becomes form, the existentialist gesture is being adjusted in the digital age.\n\nBORCH GALLERY- Fiona Tan “Ideas of Utopia”, until 31.10.2020\n\nGoethestraße 79, http://nielsborchjensen.com/\n\nTwo photographic projects by Fiona Tan, approaching different utopian visions.

Despite the continuity in theme and subject matter—our built environment, humankind’s impact on the natural world—the new pictures embed his analyses in current events, offering altered settings and situations to explore. My favorite gallery in Berlin.\n\nNUEGERRIEMSCHNEIDER- Olafur Eliasson “Near future living light”\n\nuntil 24.10.2020\n\nLinienstrasse 155, https://www.neugerriemschneider.com/\n\nOn of the most important artists in the world alive. Entitled Near future living light, this show continues the artist’s decades-long investigation of perception, illusion and the range of optical phenomena through three new projected light installations, a composition crafted from colored hand-blown glass, a 36-part, largely black-and-white watercolor work, driftwood sculptures and a partially mirrored, wall-mounted crystal glass sphere.\n\nBONUS- SPECIAL EXHIBITION AT WILHELM HALLEN\n\nKopenhagener Str. 60-68, https://wilhelm-hallen.de/\n\nYou have last chance to visit a special exhibition put together by galleries: Alexandr Levy, BQ, ChertLudde, Klemm’s, Kraupa-Tuskany Zeidler, Plan B and PSM in an enourmous place of Wilhelm Hallen.\n\nhttps://wilhelm-hallen.reservix.de/events Here link to free tickets for this weekend.
