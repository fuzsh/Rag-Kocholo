        "text": "Ceramics & bricks\n\nQuality from clay\n\nRecyclingklinker | Alexander Bernhard\n\nDiversity by GIMA\n\nProduct solutions\n\nTradition and know-how\n\nDesign freedom\n\nGirnghuber GmbH is a traditional company now under fourth-generation ownership. This brickworks business was acquired in 1903 by the great grandmother of the current CEO Claus Girnghuber and has been in family ownership since then.\n\nEver since, the GIMA brickworks have been guided by a sense of tradition and an entrepreneurial grasp of the bigger picture. If you are looking for a special size or type of ceramics, or wish to develop a new color of brick, you are in the best of hands at GIMA.\n\nâWhat sets us apart is the breadth of our product range. We are the only manufacturer who makes almost the entire range of ceramic construction materials. And together with tradition and experience, which of course many companies in this sector also have, we can offer an ultimate range of versatility coupled with a great willingness to innovate. We like being the first to make things, and we are committed to satisfying customer wishes by doing soâ, explains proprietor Claus Girnghuber.\n\nWhenever visible quality over a lifetime is called for in relation to paving and products for facades, involving extremely individual bespoke manufacturing, we fully commit our huge development and production potential. That is because here at GIMA we work hard on each project to gain a close understanding of what our customers wish to have, and we develop made-to-measure solutions. We have been committed to creating quality ceramic products for over a century.\n\nEver since, the GIMA brickworks have been guided by a sense of tradition and an entrepreneurial grasp of the bigger picture.

At GIMA we manufacture for specific projects and advise you from provision of samples to installation. You define the shape and color of the bricks, then we work together to develop the optimum solution for your project.\n\nThis makes every project unique.\n\nProjects in detail\n\nCurrent reference reports\n\nRethinking the earth cycle\n\nGIMA bricks for faÃ§ades and floors can currently be produced with a recycled content of up to 40 percent, and the research team is constantly working on further increasing the proportion of secondary raw materials. One example of this is GIMA's cooperation with HOFMANN NATURSTEIN, which has led to the development of a brick variant with sawdust in six colors. In addition to the six color variants that have now been developed, numerous other options are possible in consultation with architects, as is the case with all GIMA brick types. Â© Alexander Bernhard\n\nThe transformed city\n\nThe âAm Tachelesâ project breathes new life into a long-neglected space in the heart of Berlin-Mitte. The site, once a bustling department store arcade built in 1908 between FriedrichstraÃe and Oranienburger StraÃe, has a rich history. It has gone through various reincarnations, from commercial and industrial uses to political ones, leading to significant partial demolitions from 1980, followed by the occupation of the remaining structure by the artist collective Tacheles, who lent their name to the site. Urban redevelopment, guided by a master plan from the esteemed Basel architectural firm Herzog & de Meuron, has been underway since the mid-2010s. Photos: Â© Koy + Winkel Â\n\nFiligree facade pattern on the river bank\n\nA parking garage with an elegant design and an ornamental facade enriches the Kiel Fjord. The new building was planned by the Hamburg-based gmp Generalplanungsgesellschaft mbH and AMP Parking GmbH as part of a structural restructuring around the central bus station ZOB. The tone is set by a brick facade from GIMA, whose lattice masonry creates a characteristic pattern and is widely noticeable - day and night. Photos: Â© Anke MÃ¼llerklein\n\nPrecision in content and form\n\nOn the campus of the PTB Physical-Technical Federal Institute in Berlin-Charlottenburg, Rohdecan Architects have developed a Berlin branch of the quantum technology competence center. For research work that requires highly complex measurement technology, they designed a new building with pinpoint precision. For the clinker facade that characterizes the building, GIMA produced a project-specific special color in the \"Walther-Meissner-Bau\" sorting. Photos: Â© Koy + Winkel\n\nCreative hub dedicated to the history of the district\n\nMunich is growing, not only on the outskirts. New, contemporary usage potentials are also being activated in the inner city, so that instead of purely residential areas or large-scale industrial and commercial areas, a lively, mixed cityscape is also being created beyond the center. In the vicinity of the Ostbahnhof, for example, the Werksviertel is a completely new quarter that is being developed, in which living, working and leisure activities go hand in hand. And urban space is also becoming denser in the entire surrounding district of Berg am Laim. The new building ensemble âDie Machereiâ is an example of this. Photos: Â© Alexander Bernhard\n\nA square as a stage for city life\n\nThe importance of public space for urban society became clear again in the first phase of the pandemic. The quality of use of open spaces and parks has noticeably moved into focus. Since 2019, the city of Spenge in North Rhine-Westphalia has taken on the task of redesigning the centrally located BlÃ¼cherplatz. From an unapproachable, car-driven street crossing with parking spaces, a place of communication, play and informal stay was created, which should be consciously occupied by the residents. Photos: Â© Anke MÃ¼llerklein\n\nContemporary building block in a neighborhood that has grown historically\n\nWith an extension in the characteristic brick architecture, Knoche Architects have added a new building block to the historically grown building ensemble of the tax office in Zwickau. Until 2010, the Leipzig office was entrusted with the reorganization and renovation of the former university building, which dates back to the beginning of the 20th century and is now dedicated to administrative purposes. In the most recent addition, GIMA clinker bricks refer to the historical buildings in the area and at the same time reinterpret them due to creative tricks.Â Photos: Â© Michael Moser Images\n\nNew urban building block with monolithic shell\n\nThe district of Pasing in the outer west of Munich has changed its appearance considerably in recent years. A new traffic route and prominent new buildings for living, retail and gastronomy gave the district an attractive core around its own long-distance train station and Pasinger Marienplatz, including its historic Wilhelminian style buildings. Photos: Â© Meilenstein Kreativagentur\n\nFire Glazed\n\nWith Fire Glazed, GIMA offers a new, fascinating surface variant for unique bricks. The innovative firing method - a combination of charcoal-salt firing and glazing - creates an individual look with alternating glazed and broken surfaces, with salt and charcoal firing, with edges and notches. Photos: Â© Alexander Bernhard\n\nFrom soap factory to think tank\n\nIn the north of Munich, GSP Architects planned the construction of a modern office building on the site of an old boiling plant. The Neue Siederei on TaunusstraÃe does not just pick up on the historical reference in its name. Digital working environments, high technical standards and sustainability aspects are combined here with the creative expression of past industrial architecture. Photos: Â© Alexander Bernhard\n\nRound Corners\n\nThe new building ensemble NeuHouse in the southern Friedrichstadt combines one of the last structural testimonies of classicism, a listed old building from 1847/48 with a modern new building made of light clinker brick by GIMA. Refined facade details such as the perforated clinker parapets cite the detailed design of the stucco facade in a contemporary way. Photos: Â© Koy+Winkel\n\nContinuity for art\n\nâAs if it had always been thereâ - this is how the architects Herzog & de Meuron describe the new extension to the KÃ¼ppersmÃ¼hle Museum (MKM) at Duisburg's inner harbor. Individual bricks by GIMA for the facade and lettering take up the materiality of the adjoining storage building and follow the character of the old brick buildings on the harbor basin. Photos: Â© JÃ¶rg Seiler\n\nLiving at Verna-Park\n\nIn many locations, transforming traditional industrial towns into attractive residential areas presents a real challenge. A success story is the âLiving at Verna-Parkâ project in RÃ¼sselsheim, where a district close to the town centre has been created that blends discretely into its surroundings architecturally and in terms of urban planning, creating affordable residential housing. The draft design emerged from a competition and was produced by a young Munich-based architecture business, Baur & Latsch, comprising seven buildings with a total of 66 apartments, ranging from studios to four-room homes for students, commuters, pensioners and families. GIMA supplied the facade material, made of brick slips coated with a white finish. Photos: Â© Sebastian Schels\n\nHotel Werk 17\n\nNo downtime at the former Pfanni factory site in the Munich district of Berg am Laim: Directly adjacent to the future concert hall, the new Werk 17 [Plant 17] hotel has risen up, with its visually striking facade design. A characteristic feature is the composition of a concrete facade with embedded ceramic panels made by GIMA which enable this building to blend visually into this dynamic district on a former factory site. Photos: Â© Alexander Bernhard\n\nSchÃ¶ller Wohnpark\n\nEveryone knows SchÃ¶ller. The ice cream maker from Nuremberg has been delighting young and old alike for more than 60 years. However, until now, that name was not associated with architecture and facade construction. For the SchÃ¶ller family foundation, the firm of architects ATT Artur Asam designed SchÃ¶ller Park for the Nuremberg district of Thon. Surrounded by mature trees, ten urban villas have been constructed, comprising a total of 80 residential units. For the facade, in keeping with the values of the foundation, durability and permanence, GIMA brickwork was chosen. Photos: Â© Alexander Bernhard\n\nSt. Johannis district\n\nUntil now, for most residents of Nuremberg, the area between the tram turning loop and the boundary of the St. Johannis district was a blank area on the map. However, after two years of construction work, the new residential district of St. Johannis has been created. Named after the eponymous suburb, this district features a total of 74 rental apartments and an integrative crÃ¨che facility, a service point for the residentâs association and a social meeting point - built around neighbourly, multi-generational and energy-efficient values. Photos: Â© Alexander Bernhard\n\nVitra Schaudepot\n\nThis open storage facility project by architects Herzog & de Meuron enables the Vitra Design Museum to open its doors to the public to showcase its collection of chairs, armchairs and recliners. Over a floor area of 1600 square metres, more than 400 key works are on show here, made between 1800 and the present day. The windowless brickwork structure is an inconspicuous backdrop to this wealth of design history. However, this latest new building on the Vitra Campus is not just a simple barn with a pitched roof and a door â the gleaming red building shell made of hand-broken bricks is reminiscent of fabric, and appears to flow smoothly into the forecourt, which is also paved with brick. Photos: Â© Romy Picht\n\nThe Tate Modern Project\n\nA chamfered and truncated pyramid by Basel-based architects Herzog & de Meuron augments the massive Bankside power station on the South bank of the Thames, home since 2000 to the Tate Modern, one of the most important museums of modern and contemporary art in Europe. The perforated brick cladding of this new-build not only provides a link in aesthetic material terms between these different structures but it also imbues the building shell with a kind of plasticity and, at night, can be floodlit from inside.Â Photos: Â© Anke MÃ¼llerklein\n\nPersonal and digital\n\nOur service\n\nWe are very committed to being close to and satisfying the wishes of our customers.
