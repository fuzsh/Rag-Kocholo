        "text": "Neue Synagogue, Germany\n\nFrom series “The most luxury and famous synagogues”\n\nYou can see the beautiful building of the new synagogue on Oranienburger StraÃe in Berlin. The old synagogue lay in ruins after the end of World War II, as well as many other historical buildings in the city. The religious monument was restored in maximum accordance with the original building according to the available photos and diagrams. A rapid increase in the Jewish community was observed in Berlin in the mid-19th century. Thousands of immigrants came here from Eastern countries.\n\nThis prompted the construction of a new synagogue. Its construction began under the project of the famous architect Eduard Knoblauch in 1857. The famous Alhambra of Granada served as an inspiration for the creation of a grand project for the architect, as he noted. The synagogue was one of the largest in Europe after its completion. Up to 3,000 parishioners could be accommodated in its prayer hall at a time. Beautiful stained glass windows adorn the building today as well as many years ago. Its hall is flooded with multicolored radiance on a sunny day.\n\nThe facade of the synagogue was decorated in the Moorish style, contrary to popular traditions. Colored bricks and ceramics were used to decorate it. Some of the interior trim elements were made of precious metals. The Nazis ravaged the synagogue in 1938. It lost many of its valuables during this period, including luxury furniture and precious jewelry. The building lay in ruins after another battle in 1943. Reconstruction of the outstanding religious monument began in 1988. The first parishioners visited it seven years later. The museum and cultural center occupy part of a beautiful building today.
