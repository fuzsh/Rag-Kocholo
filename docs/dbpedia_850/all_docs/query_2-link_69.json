        "text": "Bar Verōnika mimics the essence of Restaurant Verōnika, with a more casual approach. Tuck into a deep lush sofa, sit back and enjoy the intimate escape. Right above the restaurant, the Bar offers you a treat with a curated selection of cocktails, wines from the old and new world and local beers. We also serve our Verōnika NYC favorite: The Martini Tray, with or without alcohol. Chefs display their best small intimate plates which is a good foundation for a night out at the museum. Drinks are welcome to be enjoyed throughout the museum!\n\nFotografiska Berlin is The Contemporary Museum for Photography, Art and Culture, founded in Stockholm. It is dedicated to presenting inspiring and innovative visual artworks.
