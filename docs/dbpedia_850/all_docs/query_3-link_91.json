        "text": "Number of versions: 24\n\nEdition: April 2, 2009\n\nEdition: Money-maker, nr. 209\n\nMotel Spiel*Motel game*Motel spel*Joue de motel\n\nPublisher: Hanky Panky Toys - abt.1977\n\nDimensions of the box: 32.7 x 43.2 cm\n\n. of the board: 41 x 41 cm\n\nThe game:\n\nConsidering the number of this game it is likely that it is issued in the same period as the Anti .. jeu  game  spel  spiel ® described hereafter! Apparently Jack Monschouwer, the owner of the then publishing house Hanky Panky Toys, had specialized in Monopoly like games, because in this game also the acquiring of properties (gasstations) is involved, at which restaurants (white) and motels (red) can be built.\n\nHe also used to make them European Games, because also here the Service- and All-Risk-cards (comparable with Chance and Community Chest cards) are in 4 languages viz.: German, Dutch, English and French. When you draw a Service card you are to pay gas. Some of the All-Risk-cards say for example: \"You buy a new car - pay 5000 euro in addition\" and \"You win first prize (?) in Car Rally 1500 euro\". From Start on (where you receive 1600 euro) the gasstations are always in the West and East side of the following cities: Berlin - Paris - London - Kopenhagen - Luxembourg - Bern - Milano - Brussels - Amsterdam and Vienna. In the mid of each side is a gas company, resp.: Shell - Chevron - Esso and Mobil. Furthermore there are the 2 spaces Car Repair and Taxi, however at other places than the Water Works and Electric Company.\n\nThe tokens consist of 4 plastic passenger cars and 2 petrol cars. The money consists of Euro banknotes with the values of 10 - 25 - 100 - 1000 and 5000.\n\nThe back of the game board is green.\n\nThis set was bought in 1996.\n\nEdition: Anti .. jeu  game  spel  spiel ®, ref. 212\n\nThe \"Bust~the~Trust!\" Game\n\nPublisher: a Hanky Panky product - 1977\n\nDimensions of the box: 25 x 48 cm\n\nThe game:\n\nThis game dates from the short period it was forbidden to Ralph Anspach to use the name Anti-Monopoly. That is why this \"fighter against the Charles Darrow concoction\" in America had to take some 40,000 sets of Anti-Monopoly back from the market. He continued with the same game under the name Anti.\n\nThe basic idea of the game is to end off the monopolistic practises of the 3-company-combinations of the game board. This is also called Trustbusting so the players are called trustbusters. The winning trustbuster is the one who ends with the largest number of social-credit points and euro's.\n\nThere 3 kinds of company combinations:\n\nOligopoly-combination which is marked by 1 accusation circle O\n\nTrust-combination which is marked by 2 accusation circles OO\n\nMonopoly-combination which is marked by 3 accusation circles OOO\n\n\"Accusing\" is done by placing a small, round chip of the same color as your token on such a circle. When all accusation circles of 1 combination are covered the monopolistic practises of that combination have been ended. An accusation chip can be bought for 100 Euro from the \"Budget-Commisioner\".\n\nIf the B-C lends money to a player he provides a Social-Credit card as an IOU.\n\nThere are 36 postbox cards, who give favourable or unfavourable news like:\n\nPlayers who land on Court have not to throw double afterwards, because then \"they have been found guilty of insult of the court\" for what reason they have to pay 50 Euro.\n\nThis game can be played in 3 different ways:\n\nBasic game: In this way the course of the game is ruled by coincidence.\n\nLow-budget game: The trustbusters start with less money.\n\nTrade game: Here the trustbusters are allowed to swap accusations.\n\nThe back side of the game board is blue.\n\nThis game goes with German, English, French and/or Dutch instructions.\n\nEdition: Petropolis, ref.nr. 3206\n\nPublisher: KLEE Nürnberger Spielefabrik - 1975/81\n\nDimensions of the box: 27.3 x 40.1 cm\n\nThe game:\n\nThe aim of this game is to collect as many oil concessions as possible and to obtain with that the highest possible profit from the oil producing countries. Despite the maker of this game calls it a \"dice game\" it has all the elements of the well-known Monopoly game.\n\nStart/Landung (= airport of Geneve-Switserland) lies on the midfield and one has to play counter-clockwise. 27 countries are spread over the strong game board, each of them having 1 oilconsession to give away.\n\nFrom the airport onwards the 37 spaces are respectivily:\n\nVenezuela - Argentinien - Ekuador - USA - K -Telex - Mexiko - Gehen Sie zum Internationalen Gerichtshof - Aufanken/Zahlen Sie $ 100,000 - Indonesien - Brunei Mal - Australien -China - UDSSR - Norwegen - Telex - OPEC Konferenz - Libyen - Algeri - Nigeria - Gabun - Falkenjagd in der Wüste - Internationaler Gerichtshof - Telex - Irak - Kuwait - Ägypten - Schardscha - Dubai - Abu Dhabi - Nochmal würfeln - Gehen Sie zum Internationalen Gerichtshof - Oman - Telex -Bahrain - Katar - Iran - Vermisst in der Wüste and Saudi Arabien.\n\nSubject to the number of players the consessions are to be distributed amongst them at the start of the game; the remainder must be sold.\n\nThe oilmagnates always move over the board by plane. Over or on Start you receive P$ 500,000.\n\nThe 7 tokens are nice goldcolored \"emblems on a base\" with the picture of resp. a Sheik, oil drums, dromedary, oil storage tanks, swards, plane and tanker.\n\nThe money consists of clumsy tiny (45 x 75 mm) but good looking Petrodollar banknotes from the Worldbank. In the centre is a circle with a dromedary of course and the text \"In oil we trust\". The denominations are resp. P$1.000 - 5.000 - 10.000 - 20.000 - 50.000 - 100.000 and P$1.000.000\n\nInstead of Chance and Community Chest cards are here 25 Telex cards with instructions like:\n\nThe card \"Your political influence has helped to prove your innocence. Keep this card\" correspond consequently with \"Get out of Jail free\". The 2 yellow spaces on the board are:\n\n\"Falconry in the desert\"\n\n\"Missed in the desert\"\n\nThey have effect on the game.\n\nThis set was bought in 1996.\n\nEdition: Anti-Monopoly, ref. 2136/3\n\n\"Das Spiel für freie Marktwirtschaft\"\n\nPublisher: ASS - Leinfelden - 1983\n\nDimensions of the box: 26.4 x 50.2 cm\n\nThe game:\n\nHere again the basic idea of the game is to prevent monopoly building of companies in order to maintain the foundation of free economy with its competitors. So the aim is to blow up monopolies, at which the players are Anti-Monopolists.\n\nThis version correspond very much with the earlier described \"Bust~the~Trust!\" Game, ref.212, but still there are some differences, viz.:\n\nEdition: Anti-Monopoly II, ref. 2150/5\n\n\"Das ganz andere Spiel\"\n\nPublisher: ASS - Leinfelden - 1984\n\nDimensions of the box: 26.5 x 50 cm\n\nThe game:\n\nThe cover says strikingly \"This game was invented by Prof.Ralph Anspach and was manufactured by ASS, not by Parker-Brothers!\"\n\nAnti-Monopoly II is an improved version of the original game the Atlantic City Quakers ever called monopoly. Prof. Ralph Anspach invented it and prof. Irvin Hentzel did the mathematics.\n\nIn this game players follow either the rules for monopoly or those for competition (= Wettbewerb), fixed at the start of the game. Competitors (\"Wettbewerber\") charge fair rents, build as soon as they own a property, place 4 houses at the most, after which they build a hotel and occasionally go to Price War. On the other hand however \"Monopolists\" exort monopoly-high rents from their poor tenants, build only after they have at least 2 streets of one color, restrict supply by putting only 3 houses on their properties, after which they also are allowed to build a hotel and occasionally go to prison.\n\nThe good guys are the small entrepreneurs and the bad guys are the monopolists. Since players do not play by the same rules, fairness is achieved by a patented technique of equalizing the win probabilities.\n\nAnti-Monopoly II requires more sophistication and strategic thinking than Monopoly because competitors make more money than monopolists in the beginning of the game but monopolists can catch up later, especially if competitors don't watch their money. This eliminates a weakness in the other game where one often knows in the beginning who is going to win, even though the game can drag on for a long time. Rightly this game is for players as from 10 years.\n\nIt is a German game with mainly streets from 4 German cities, but also from others countries. The cities are respectively Hamburg, München, Berlin, Paris, Zürich, Wien, London and Frankfurt.\n\nDe colors of the streets are from Start: light green, brown, lilac, dark green, blue, purple, light brown and red.\n\nElectric Works = Eurostrom en Water Works = Eurogas Gesellschaft.\n\nIn the middle of each side of this blue board you'll find respectively Eurotransport Gesellschaft, Europabus Gesellschaft, Euroflug Gesellschaft and Europafracht.\n\nInstead of Chance and Community Chest cards are 25 Wettbewerber and 25 Monopolist cards. In both cases it are numbered, white cards with funny illustrations and texts like: \"You have won the lawsuit against a Monopolist. Even after the paying your lawyers terrible high fee, you are still ahead\".And for both: \"Go to the Reeperbahn\".\n\nUnlike the Dutch version of this game (see ref.15880) the currency is not the Euro but undefined. On the properties just houses and hotels are to be built, but the Wettbewerber pays but half the rent.\n\nThe tokens are 6 aggravation pawns of wood.\n\nEdition: Bau auf der Schossallee\n\nPublisher: Parker Bros./Kenner Parker - 1985\n\nDimensions of the box: 26 x 50.6 cm\n\nThe game:\n\nThe subtitle of this game says \"Let's go into the world of high investments and hotel empires\" while the \"Glückskarten\" show an illustration of Uncle Pennybags on the back. This are sufficient reasons to add this game, in 1985 issued by Parker Bros., to the collection of Monopoly like games.\n\nThe idea however differs importantly from Monopoly: The board is oblong: 22.5 x 89 cm and contains 4 colored groups of 5 spaces each, of which the maximum of 4 players have to collect the properties cards.\n\nThe 4 tokens are respectively: Pram - Roller skate - Sail boat and a Moped.\n\nThere are 3 dice, one of them being white and provided with a G (Glück), W (Wunsch) and one of the colors of each of the 4 spaces on the other 4 sides. Furthermore are 80 hotel units, 20 per color of the tokens. Dependent on the number of players each player gets 14 to 20 hotels. He is to build these, subject to the number of pips thrown, on spaces at choice. The Glückskarten (Fortune cards) will help. The token is always put on the space that relates to the total of the property cards the player has in possession. Player can no longer take part when he has no more hotels. Winner is of course the one who finally has most properties.\n\nThe cover shows a \"years twenties\"-like illustration of a hotel entrance with a Rolls Royce-like car. The white bottom of the box shows the long game board in black and white.\n\nThe set was manufactured in France.\n\nIdentical games are Advance to Boardwalk (USA), Marble Arch (GB) and Ga verder naar Kalverstraat (NL).\n\nThe price amounted to DM 35.- (US$ 20.-) in October 1995.\n\nEdition: Anti-Monopoly III, Washington-Moskau\n\n\"Wenn Sie gewinnen, gewinnt der Frieden,\n\nWenn alle verlieren, verliert die Welt\" Publisher: ASS - Leinfelden - 1987\n\nDimensions: 26.5 x 50.2 cm\n\nThe game:\n\nAgain a different idea of the Anti-Monopoly game that can be played as from 12 years. The bottom of the box says:\n\n\"Prof.Dr.Ralph Anspach, feighter against monopolies and inventor of Anti-Monopoly and Anti-Monopoly II has discovered a new field in which monopolies set the tone:\n\nToday (he poses end of the eighties) the democratic thinking man is faced with nuclear monopolies and arms race. However it is not right to pose that one cannot do something about it. Ralph Anspach has converted his ideas into a game in order to transform that thought. To prevent destruction player has simultaniously to pursue his own targets as well co-operate with the other players to maintain peace! Each of the 2 to 6 players represents a nuclear authority.\n\nThe aim of the game is to maintain world peace and to save earth from falling by a nuclear war. The common target of the players is to prevent the atom bomb. An explosion of the atom bomb is at the end of the \"Arms spiral\", representing the automatism of the arms race. When the \"Bomb\" arrives the end of the Arms spiral (in the centre of the game board) world peace is over and everyone has lost! However, if all players work together in such a way that 1 reaches the space \"Weltfrienden\" (World Peace, right from Start) earlier, then the arms race is over. All players have won and the one who has contributed the most to maintain world peace is declared winner.\n\nThe specialty of this game is the constant conflict players are in: each one can pursue his personal selfish target to come to a victory, but this selfishness promotes the arms race. The end is bound to happen. Co-operation is necessary! But how much co-operation and how much selfishness? May only one be selfish or may they all? Experience these conflicts yourself!\"\n\nAnd so you can do on a game board that has no streets. On 3 of the 4 sides of the board you can \"turn circles\", subject to the instructions you get on the way. If you are having a lucky streak at your turn you may receive many millions of dollars, but if it is going against you you may cause the bomb going 1 or more steps forward! (The cashier also moves the bomb.)\n\nAktion cards are to be drawn when you land on a similar space. This are a kind of Chance cards. When you land on one of the red Krise spaces you are to open one of your 5 Kooperation cards and next you choose a player of whom you hope he will have an equal card. If that is the case indeed there are 2 possibilities:\n\nHe is willing to co-operate. In that case both make a profit.\n\nHe reports he is not willing to give his card and he plays the self-seeker. He earns from otherone's turn and moreover the bomb advances 3 spaces.\n\nHowever, in case the choosen player does not have the card then there is but 1 possibility:\n\nYou are to go one step back and to pay a fine of some millions of dollars. Moreover the bomb advances 2 places.\n\nAbove each of the 3 first sides of the game board are 3 black dots at a monopoly-space. Just when 3 black \"accusation-chips\" have been put on these the relevant monopoly has been defeated! When a player lands on such a space while not all 3 accusations have been rewarded, he may do 2 things:\n\nHe can collect the money he has a right to as a monopolyst. The consequence however is that also the bomb goes forward.\n\nHe lodges an accusation. To that end he has to buy a chip from the cashier.\n\nIf you finally land on the fourth green side of the board the critical phase sets in! Here apply different possibilities:\n\nThis intelligent and human game ought to be played World-Wide, but unfortunately it never got the recognition it deserves.\n\nThe American version of this game is called Star Peace, anti nuclear war.\n\nEdition: Das kaufmännische Talent\n\nPublisher: Stomo Spiele - Austria - ±1987?\n\nDimensions of the box: 26 x 50 x 4 cm\n\nThe game:\n\nThis game is called a European Edition, because the Champs Elysees and the Rue la Fayette stay brotherly next to Oxford Street and Piccadilly, Kurfurstendamm and Potsdammerstrasse.\n\nIn the midfield of the game board are drawn impressions of the cities Hamburg, Paris, Bruxelles, Berlin, Zürich, Wien and München. (In the Europe de Luxe version the cities Hamburg and Berlin are replaced by Frankfurt and London).\n\nBesides these streets are also Plant and Public Transport spaces where freight charges are to be payed. On the 3 corners spaces are resp.: Violation of the Law, 10% Capital levy and Arrest. (So the Jail is at another corner).\n\nThe 15 Chance cards and 15 Bank cards are to be put on the centrefield. The money consists of banknotes as well as round, hard plastic coins. There are 6 tokens, 32 houses and 8 hotels.\n\nRemarkable with this game is the cone, a pawn that is to be placed near one of the numbers 1 to 40 along side 1 of the board to count the number of playrounds.\n\nThe Rules are as well in German as in French.\n\nEdition: Shalom, Ref.U1230\n\nPublisher: Uljö Christliche Geschenke - 1990\n\nDimensions of the box: 37 x 27 x 5.5 cm\n\nof the board: 49 x 49 cm\n\nThe game:\n\nThe German manufacturer of this very carefully edited game calls it \"a family game with biblical background\". Therefore the foreword says \" the game has to contribute to a better understanding and knowledge of the word of God.\" The meaning of the game: \"The Shalom game should bring every individual player closer to the Holy Writ (bible) and so explaining the connection between the Old and New Testament\".\n\nDo we compare this game with the well-known Monopoly we'll see interesting differences:\n\nThis set is published by:\n\nUljö Christliche Geschenke\n\nD-5238 HACHENBURG - DEUTSCHLAND\n\nWebsite: www.uljoe.de\n\nin co-operation with Bibel-Center\n\nFreie Theologische Fachschule\n\nBRECKERFELD - DEUTSCHLAND\n\nThe price amounted to  29.80.- April 2005.\n\nEdition: Hotel, Ref.14313D\n\n\"Das Spiel aus der luxuriösen Welt der Traumhotels\"\n\nPublisher: MB Spiele/Hasbro Deutschland GmbH -1996\n\nDimensions of the box: 27 x 40 x 9 cm\n\nThe game:\n\nThe box of this game is rather voluminous because quite a lot of room is necessary for the 8 hotels, the bank building and the town hall. The buildings of hotel President and Fujiyama are already skyscrapers. On the game board a circuit is set having a black edge on each side to put the Entries for the hotels on. Opposite the Bank is a yellow line, where you receive DM 2000.- on passing by. The yellow line opposite the Town Hall entitles to buy Entries. The spaces of the circuit mainly consitst of Purchase and Building Licence spaces. When you land on a Purchase space you are allowed to buy a property adjacent to one of the sides of that space.\n\nOn a Building Licence space you are to throw the special die:\n\nRed = you don't get the Licence\n\nGreen = you have to build now\n\nH = building is free of charge\n\n2 = building cost twice the normal price\n\nExcept a main building you also can enlarge with annexes and \"Facilities\". The most luxury hotel is finally (!) Waikiki with 4 Extensions and all Facilities, what makes it a 5-star hotel. The simplest hotel is called Boomerang and has besides the main building only Facilities (max. 2 stars).\n\nThe 4 players obtain their revenues from the other players the moment they land on a space with an Entry of one of their hotels. To that end the player throws the normal die again. The number of pips = the number of nights he has to stay in the hotel. The price for it depends on the number of stars of the hotel.\n\nThe winner finally possesses all hotels.\n\nA very nice game that really do belong to the collection of each Monopoly games collector.\n\nEdition: Star Wars Monopoly, Ref.Nr.40786100 \"Limited Collector's Edition\"\n\nPublisher: Parker Bros./Hasbro Deutschland GmbH - 1997\n\nDimensions of the box: 25.7 x 51.0 x 5.3 cm\n\nThe game:\n\nAgain a very nice game indeed that gets the mark \"Limited Collector's Edition\". The co-operation between Parker Bros. and Lucas Film Ltd. arose because of the 20 years anniversary of Star Wars. The most striking of this game are the 2 kinds of players (the Rebels and Imperials) each having their own Vehicles and Poperties. The rules of play are exactly the same as those of the \"normal\" game, however the differences are sometimes striking, viz.:\n\nEach token represents a well-known Star Wars character. The Rebel Alliance is represented by: Luke Skywalker, Princes Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca and R2-D2. The fighters for the Galactic Empire are: Darth Vader, Boba Fett and the Stormtrooper.\n\nThe vehicles of the Rebels are the light gray X-Wing Fighters and Corellian Freighters and those of the Imperials are the dark gray Tie Fighters and Star Destroyers.\n\nThe banknotes are in various colors with the value indication on the right side. The text with the illustrations on the banknotes is in Aurebesh!?\n\nThe bottom of the box not only shows a clear picture of the game board and attributes, but also a good picture of the tokens: the \"Heroes\" and the \"Villains\".\n\nEdition: WM Fussball Edition France 98, Ref.19618D100\n\nPublisher: Parker/ Hasbro Deutschland - 1997\n\nDimensions: 40 x 27 x 6.5 cm\n\nThe game:\n\nThis is a box in the colors dark blue, silver and of course red.\n\nThe game board spaces can hardly be found on the cover, but so a couple of footballers, eachone in an energic posture but not in a match position. On the bottom of the box is again a clear picture of the game board and its attributes.\n\nBesides it shows that an inner box as football ground is supplied with the set. It also strikes that the Ereignis and Gemeinschaftskarten are replaced bei Aus and Heimspielkarten, with of course matching texts like \"Transfer to Brasil\" and \"You have missed a penalty. Pay 2000 fine\".\n\nThe banker's tray is of soft dark blue plastic and has a special space for the square game board.\n\nIn this game the properties are of course national football teams, viz. those of the 22 best clubs of the official worldlist as it is composed by the FIFA on the basis of the results of the countries in all worldcup finals since 1930.\n\nOn the game board they are respectively:\n\nScotland - Switserland - Romania - Chile - Mexico - Belgium - Austria - Czechoslovakia - The Netherlands - Poland - Hungary - Yougoslavia - France - Sweden - Uruguay - Russia - Spain - England - Argentine - Italy - Germany and Brasil.\n\nThe spaces have the well-known color bars and are furthermore characterized by a T-shirt of the concerning country. The stations are replaced by the 4 most important stadiums of France, viz. Stade Velodrome of Marseille, Stade du Parc de Princes in Paris, Le Stade de France in Saint-Denis and Stade de Gerland of Lyon.\n\nThe 2 public utilities are now Electric Works and Softdrink Manufacturer (marked by a red beaker but not of Coca Cola). It is remarkable that one can be sent to jail in this game as well.\n\nThe 8 tokens are resp. a shoe, cap, beaker, hamburger, goal, whistle, bal and the (gold colored) FIFA Worldcup Trophy (with the mark \"1974 FIFA TM© in the base).\n\nOther differences with the standard Monopoly game are:\n\nEdition: Die Börse - German, Ref. 16465/100\n\nPublisher: Parker/Hasbro Inc. - 2001\n\nDimensions of the box: 6.5 x26.8 x 40.1 cm\n\nThe game:\n\nThe most significent of this game is its computer that goes with it (however without batteries). The slogan of this Stock Exchange game is: \"Buy for as low a price as possible and sell for substantial prices!\"\n\nEverything is simplyfied with this computer for the players (every player has his own entrance button). So they can calculate the exchange rate of their shares and store the \"Presidencies of their compagnies\".\n\nThe properties of this game are international and national compagnies that will differ per country. There has been 22 Ereignis cards replaced by 16 Bear cards and Gemeinschaft by 16 Bull cards.\n\nThe values of the banknotes (ref.nr.\"100 16465 0000 - Monopoly Stock Broker\") are a factor M (million) higher and at Los you will receive  200M. The denominations of these Monopoly banknotes are resp.: 1M - 5M -10M - 20M - 50M - 100M and 500M.\n\nThe 6 tokens are unfortunately the common metal tokens boat - dog - car - hat - shoe and iron.\n\nThe grounds are built with 32 dark blue branches and 12 red main settlements.\n\nBoth dice are white with black pips.\n\nEdition: Junior standard - German, Ref.Nr. 00441100\n\nPublisher: Parker Bros./Hasbro - 2001\n\nDimensions of the box: 26.8 x 26.8 cm\n\nThe game:\n\nLike they did for the 2001 standard edition Hasbro also decided to apply the American reference number 441 for this new\n\nJunior issue followed by the country number. (The boring uniformity is consequently applied.)\n\nThe presentation on the lid of this square box is absolutely dazzling indeed. A well streamlined cart whirrling coming\n\ndown a twisted roller coaster. Did the red cart of the 1996 edition show 4 kids now there are but 3 in a yellow cart. It is also for the first time the red Monopoly-bar-in-relief with Mr. Monopoly (as Uncle Pennybags is called since 2000) with red bow tie appears out the central O.\n\nThe Rules haven't of course been changed and the oblong game board has been maintained as well. However, the currency has ofcourse been changed into uro.\n\nEdition: Disney Edition, Ref. 090119631100\n\nPublisher: Parker/Hasbro Inc. - 2002\n\nDimensions of the box: 26.8 x 40.0 x 6.5 cm\n\nThe game: In this issue the streets on the standard game board are replaced by titels of Disney films.\n\nFrom Los on all spaces are:\n\nTarzan - Zauberhafte Welt - Toy Story -Steuer an Dagobert Duck - Alladins Fliegender Teppich - Peter Pan - Showtime - Pocahontas - Schneewittchen - Gefängnis - Dumbo - Zauberstab - Die Schöne und das Biest - Arielle, die Meerjungfrau - Käpt'n Hooks Piratenschiff - Cap und Capper - Zauberhafte Welt - Bernard & Bianca - Das Dschungelbuch - Frei Parken - Steamboat Willie - Showtime -Dornröschen - Susi und Strolch - Cinderellas Kutsche - Mulan - Alice im Wunderland - Elfenstaub - Cinderella - Gehen Sie In Das Gefängnis - Bambi - Aladdin - Zauberhafte Welt - Pinocchio - Cruella De Vils Auto - Showtime - König der Löwen - Steuer an Prinz John and 101 Dalmatiner.\n\nThe Ereignis cards became Zauberhafte Welt cards, while the Gemeinschaftskarten are here Show Time cards.\n\nThe money consists of colored notes with the amount to the left and the right and Uncle Scrooge inbetween as Mr.Monopoly.\n\nThe 8 tokens are Disney characters as they appear in the stories: Peter Pan - Snow White - Pinocchio - Lady and the Tramp - Dombo - Alice - Tarzan and Sleeping Beauty.\n\nThe set goes with 32 green \"White Rabbit Cottages\" and 12 red \"Sleeping Beauty Castles\".\n\nThe set is \"Manufactured in Ireland\".\n\nVersion: Star Wars - Episode II , Ref. 47164100\n\n\"Sammler Ausgabe\"\n\nPublisher: Parker/Lucasfilm Ltd./Hasbro - Febr. 2002 Dimensions of the box: 26.8 x 40.0 x 6.5 cm\n\nThe game:\n\nThis is already a 4th version of Star Wars and the 2nd after a film: Attack of the Clones.\n\nThe text on the bottom of the box reads:\n\n\"Rush into the fray to rule over the Galaxy!\n\nIn this special edition of Monopoly you take part of the great great war against the Clones yourself. Choose one of the 8 tokens  you decide yourself if you choose for the Dark or Brite side. Follow an intergalactic way over the game board meanwhile collecting as many Republican Credits as possible!\n\nThe special \"force' die and counters offer an additional challenge if you have to measure your strength with the other part of the fight for supreme mastery. Do Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda de Jedi je lead to victory? Or will this be the chance the malicious count Dooku and Jango Fett are waiting for so long? The one who knows how to prevent a bankrupcy will finally triumph.\n\nMay the Force be with you!\"\n\nThe Ereignis and Gemeinschafts cards have been replaced by Jedi and Sith cards.\n\nThe 8 pewter tokens are: Obi-Wan Kenobi - Anakin Skywalker - Padmé Amidala - Mace Windu - a Clone Trooper of the Brite side - Count Dooku - Jango and a Superfighter droïde of the Dark side.\n\nThe currency of the Star Wars banknotes is Republican Credit. The houses and hotels have been replaced by Appartments and Towers.\n\nExcept for the 2 common dice there is also a Force-die supplied this time.\n\nThis German language edition is of course also available in Austria and Switserland.\n\nEdition: German rug game, no Ref. Nr.\n\nPublisher: Hasbro/Altap B.V.-NL -2004\n\nDimensions of the rug: 0.93 x 0.93 m\n\nThe game:\n\nThis rug game is owned by Roland Klose - D.\n\nExcept for this German rug, the Dutch firm Altap B.V. made a same rug of the standard Dutch Monopoly game bord as well.\n\nThe rugs go with a set of all standard sized property deeds, Chance- and Community Chest cards, Monopoly money (Set C, ref.nr. 100 00009 00C0), 32 wooden houses and 12 hotels, 2 wooden dice with black pips and 6 large (5 cm high) wooden aggrivation pawns for tokens. Of course the set is accompanied by a Rules paper.\n\nI once heard of a game player who bought this rug for the only reason this set was  5 cheaper than the standard set with ref.nr. 00009.\n\nI think this set gives space for matches of more than 6 players.\n\nThis version was only available in the German supermarket PLUS shops under the art.nr. PLU7154.\n\nEdition: Disney - 3D, Ref. 030519631100\n\nPublisher: Parker/Hasbro - 2005\n\nDimensions of the box: 27.0 x 40.2 x 6.5 cm\n\nThe game:\n\nThis Special Edition is from the collection of Roland Klose - D.\n\nAlthough this edition has the same reference number as the 2002 issue its presentation is quite different:\n\nFrom Los on all spaces are:\n\nBernard & Bianca - Zauberhafte Welt - Cap und Capper -Steuer an Dagobert Duck - Toy Story - Dumbo - Showtime - Dornröschen - Peter Pan - Gefängnis - Alice im Wunderland - Zauberstab - Susi und Strolch - Schneewittchen und die Sieben Zwerge - Findet Nemo - Aschenputtel - Zauberhafte Welt - Pinocchio - Das Dschungelbuch - Frei Parken - 101 Dalmatiner - Showtime - Arielle, die Meerjungfrau - Bambi - Die Monster AG - Lilo & Stitch - Mulan - Elfenstaub - Der Glöckner von Notre Dame - Gehen Sie In Das Gefängnis - Pocahontas - Die Schöne und das Biest - Zauberhafte Welt - Tarzan - Die Unglaublichen - Showtime - Aladdin - Steuer an Prinz John and König der Löwen.\n\nThe cards, money and buildings are the same as of the earlier edition - only a few of the 8 tokens are different. Although the lid shows but 6+1 tokens the game comes with 8+1, viz.: Alice in Wonderland - Peter Pan - Mogli - Lady and the Tramp - Dumbo - Pinocchio + a golden Tinker Bell and (not shown on the lid) Snow White and Sleeping Beauty.\n\nThe story on the back of the box contains two errors in the text, viz.: \"... hilfreich zur Seite chte (ought to be: steht) auf deinen Besitztümern Hütten und Schlösser und genieße mit Dsney Monopoly ...\".\n\nA piece of orange paper give an explanation of the Special Rule of this game:\n\nIn order to make this edition even more magic you shall introduce elf Tinker Bell:\n\n1. Prepare the game as usual and put Tinker Bell token at the Los-corner.\n\n2. The moment a player throws double Tinker Bell proceeds 1 space. Besides she jumps over the Tax-,\n\nShowtime- and Zauberhafte Welt-spaces as well as the Jail an Free Parking.\n\n3. When you lands on a property owned by another player and Tinker Bell is staying there already, it is the\n\nBanker who pays the rent for you.\n\n4. When you lands on a property that doesn't yet belongs to someone else while Tinker Bell is there already,\n\nyou'll get the property for free.\n\nEdition: Heute, Ref. 020500114/00402/100\n\nPublisher: Parker/Hasbro - Febr. 2005\n\nDimensions of the box: 27.0 x 40.2 x 6.5 cm\n\nThe game:\n\nThis edition is from the collection of Roland Klose - D.\n\nI assume Parker/Hasbro to be a bit in a rush for one reason or the other at the introduction of their 70th anniversary edition, because\n\nthey are confusingly using a double reference number, meaning they intended from the start to issue 2 different versions.\n\nIn this edition the bottom shows this double number 020500114/00402/100, meaning that this part of the box will also be used for the edition with ref.nr. 00114. And indeed both Heute and Banking show the same green game board (although the accompanying texts differ) on the box' bottom.\n\nA rim of the lid however shows the ref.nr. of this issue: 0205.00402/100.\n\nAnother slovenliness is the fact that it was forgotten on both \"utility cards\" to mention the multiplication factor of 10,000 to be applied. The correction was made for those cards in the Banking issue.\n\nThe motto for this 70th anniversary edition was for all countries \"How would Monopoly look like should it have been invented today?\".\n\nSome countries used this motto for the title of the edition, like France with \"Et si Monopoly était inventé aujourd'hui? (see also chapter www.muurkrant.nl/monopoly/france_-_2005_-_New_streets.htm). Other countries used names identical to this German one like Here and Now in England, Itt és most! in Hungary and different like the Van Dam tot Dom in the Netherlands.\n\nFor this version the streets have been substituted by very well-known (large) objects like buildings, stadiums and monuments. The amounts have been made \"contemporary\" as well. So you will not collect  200 over Los , but  2 million instead so a factor 10,000 more. However everything is of course correspondingly more expensive: The buying price for a station became f.e.  2 million.\n\nFor all corresponding editions applies in addition:\n\nThe streets and monuments in Heute are all from Berlin and are from Los in order:\n\nCheckpoint Charlie -Siegessäule - Bahnhof Zoo - Oranienburger Strasse - Simon-Dach-Strasse - Die Hackeschen Höfe - Im Gefängnis - Tiergarten - Sony-Center - Olympiastadion - Strandbad Wannsee - Flughafen Schönefeld - Brandenburger Tor - Gedächtniskirche - Reichstag - Frei Parken - Tränenpalast - Museumsinsel - Berliner Philharmonie - Lehrter Bahnhof - Kollwitzplatz - Gendarmenmarkt - Fernsehturm - Pariser Platz - Gehen Sie in das Gefängnis - Kurfürstendamm - Unter den Linden - Friedrichstrasse - Flughafen Tegel - Kadewe and Schlossstrasse.\n\nIn Germany this anniversary edition was introduced as follows:\n\n\"With the worldrecord of the largest Monopoly game board ever Parker celebrated Friday, June 17 in the Berliner Friedrich-Jahn-Stadion the start of the anniversary the over-dimensioned way: On 900 m2 the Toy Publisher introduced its new Trend Edition Monopoly Heute, that is launched right in time. From the motto How would Monopoly look like should it have been invented today? it hereby goes with modern tokens via Los over nowadays Berlin scenes, stately penhouses and skyscrapers and players do pay close to real purchase prices. Those having luck will win a \"Wellness Weekend from the Ereignis cards stack or may enjoy a \"Salary for a TV appearance .\"\n\nEdition: Banking - VISA, Ref. 060500114/00402/100\n\nPublisher: Parker/Hasbro - June 2005\n\nDimensions of the box: 27.0 x 40.2 x 6.5 cm\n\nThe game:\n\nThis edition is from the collection of Roland Klose - D.\n\nThis edition is basically a copy of Heute, the 70th anniversary issue with (apart from the date, the first 4 figures) the same double reference number. The date clearly shows this edition was issued 4 months later than the original Heute edition.\n\nUnderneath the picture of the wrong, green game board at the bottom side of this box, the right ref. number 0605 00114 100 is given.\n\nThe real color of the board is silver glossy.\n\nThe red car with Mr. Monopoly at the wheel, only shows the word Monopoly on the licence plate, both on the lid of this edition as well as on the Heute lid. The licence plate of the French game shows MR. M70, meaning \"Mr.Monopoly's car on the 70th birthday of Monopoly\".)\n\nBoth \"utility cards\" now mention the necessary multiplication factor of 10,000, see the picture.\n\nTypical for this edition is the card reader. Credit cards replace the banknotes (which can be ordered should you like to have them as yet).\n\nThe credit cards shown on the box however, are misleading. It is suggested they are chipcards, which is not true. There is but some rise in the card of each player that is recognized by the card reader. All winnings and spendings are booked per player in the card reader unit.\n\nAll other items as tokens, houses and hotels and dice are the same as in the Heute edition.\n\nEdition: Monopoly express, Ref.080542787100\n\n\"Der ganze Monopolyspass in 20 Minuten\"\n\nPublisher: Parker/ Hasbro - 2005\n\nDimensions of the box: diam. 15.5 cm x 4.5 cm\n\nThe game:\n\nThis edition is owned by Roland Klose - D.\n\nThis game is just an other presentation, though a nice one, of the Dice game, like f.e. ref.nr.14087F, issued in 1992 in France and ref.nr.44029 issued in the UK in 1993.\n\nAs the subtitle says: The whole Monopoly pleasure can be enjoyed with this game in but 20 minutes. There are 11 dice showing not only figures from 50 to 500 but also locomotives and policemen.\n\nOn your turn, throw all the dice as many times as you wish to get as many \"streets\" of the same color and so get the highest score you can. However, if you throw all three policemen, your turn ends and you lose all the points for that turn.\n\nThis edition, a non regular item of Hasbro, is \"Made in China\".\n\nEdition: FIFA WM 2006 - German, Ref. 010600413100\n\n\"Official Licensed Product\"\n\nPublisher: Parker/ Hasbro - 2006\n\nDimensions of the box: 27.0 x 40.2 x 6.5 cm\n\nThe game:\n\nThis edition is owned by Roland Klose - D.\n\nThe text on the bottom of this set says:\n\n\"With this Special Edition Monopoly celebrates the ultimate sport event of the year 2006: the FIFA football World Championship in Germany.\n\nTravel around the FIFA WC game board from one participant country to the other, buy the teams and build stadiums and tribunes. With the Schiedsrichter- and Trainer cards you exhort your luck: Perhaps you will win a price, but maybe you'll get a red card and you have to leave the ground!\n\nAre you ready for kick-off?\"\n\nThe properties are all off participant countries and from Los onwards resp.:\n\nAustralien - Trainer - Schweiz -Rote Karte - Olympiastadion (Berlin) - Südkorea - Schiedsrichter - Tunesien - Polen - Gefängnis - Costa Rica - McDonalds - Kroatien - Iran - Fritz-Walter-Stadion (Kaiserslautern) - Deutschland - Trainer - Japan - Schweden - Frei Parken - Italien - Portugal - England - Zentralstadion (Leipzig) - USA - Mexiko - T-Punkt - Spanien - Gehen Sie In Das Gefängnis - Frankreich - Argentinien - Trainer - Niederlande - Frankenstadion (Nürnberg) - Schiedsrichter - Tschechien - Gelbe Karte and Brasilien.\n\nThe Chance cards are here Schiedsrichter (arbitter) cards, while the other cards are Trainer cards.\n\nThe money consists of 7 \"Monopoly FIFA WM 2006\"-banknotes in the denominations: 1 - 5 - 10 - 20 - 50 - 100 and 500.\n\nThe 6 tokens are: golden boot - keeper - player - goal - ball and whistle.\n\nThe houses and hotels are respectively tribunes and WC Stadiums.\n\nBoth dice are 12 sided and show all figures from 1 to 6 twice.\n\nThis edition is, as usual, \"Made in Ireland\".\n\nEdition: Anti-Monopoly® - German edition, Ref. 08509\n\n\"Das Wirtschaftsspiel des 21. Jahrhunderts\"\n\nPublisher:University Games Europe B.V.-NL - 2006\n\nDimensions of the box: 26.8 x 40.2 cm\n\nThe game:\n\nOn the bottom of the box is, next to a color picture of the game, a short explanation of the origin of the game and how to play it.\n\nThe translation reads:\n\n\"An update of the \"monopoly\" folk game invented by Elizabeth Magie a 100 years ago. The world-famous game based on our\n\ncapitalistic society where private entrepreneurs struggle for profit.\n\nThe same applies for Anti-Monopoly®. Here players also fight to become the richest real estate and landowner. To attain this\n\nobjective, players always struggle for more power and eliminate their competitors merciless - not exactly like in real life where\n\nthis is tried to prevent.\n\nThere competition looks after a functioning market with fair prices.\n\nIn Anti-Monopoly® players are divided into two groups: competitors and monopolists. They follow different rules as a result of\n\nwhat the game becomes more dynamic and and richer in variation.\"\n\nRalph Anspach is a Professor Emeritus of Economics at San Francisco State University who invented this Anti-Monopoly game. He based his creation on the monopoly folkgame which was invented by Elizabeth Magie in 1904 and was played extensively in the Eastern United States between 1904 and 1935. Players in the monopoly folkgame buy and trade properties to monopolize color groupings.His game transforms the folk game into a battle between competitors and monopolists and it retains the antimonopoly message of the creators of monopoly. Quaker teachers (members of the Society of Friends in Atlantic City, N.J.) transformed the folkgame into what is now played as Monopoly.\n\nCharles B. Darrow stole the knowledge of the game and its rules from these Quakers, commercialized it, and falsely claimed that he had invented it to get an invention patent. He licensed it to Parker Brothers which popularized the legend of Darrow the Inventor.. .\n\nRalph Anspach discovered the truth about the history of Monopoly when he became a defendant in a ten-year long law suit filed by Parker Brothers. He eventually won that law suit, read his book \"Monopolygate\".\n\nAnti-Monopoly®'s specialty is, as said, its principle players have to choose between 2 play methods: that of the Monopolists and the Competitors. However, which part you will prefer, all players have equal chances to win, although they play according to different Rules. So Monopolists for example, can only build houses and hotels when they have a monopoly position in a town (what is the case already when the player owns 2 of 3 streets), while Competitors may build on each property, independent of they own a whole city or one single street.\n\nOn the solid board with black back the streets of 8 cities are from Start onwards:\n\nRom: Corso Impero - Wettbewerber oder Monopolist - Via Roma - Einkommenssteur (Income Tax)\n\nBerlin: Alexanderplatz - Wettbewerber oder Monopolist - Kurfürstendamm - Potsdammer Straße\n\nSightseeing-Tour/Preiskrieg(price war)/Gefängnis (Jail)\n\nMadrid: Plaza Mayor - Elektrizitätswerk (Electric Company) - Gran Via - Paseo de la Castellana\n\nAmsterdam: Dam - Wettbewerber oder Monopolist - Leidsestraat - Kalverstraat\n\nAnti-Monopoly Stiftung (Anti-Monopoly foundation)\n\nParis: Rue la Fayette -Wettbewerber oder Monopolist - Rue de la Paix - Champs-Élysées\n\nBrüssel: Grote Markt - Hoogstraat - Gaswerk (Gas company) - Nieuwstraat\n\nMonopoliste: Gehen Sie is das Gefängnis (Monopolist: Go to Jail) / Wettbewerber: Begeben Sie sich in den Preiskrieg (Competitor: Go to the price war)\n\nLondon: Park Lane - Piccadilly -Wettbewerber oder Monopolist - Oxford Street\n\nAthen: Wettbewerber oder Monopolist - La Plaka - Zusatzsteur (Special tax) - Syntagma\n\nThe 4 spaces in the middle of each side are respectively: Flughafen - Straßenbahn - Bahnhof and Busbetriebe.\n\nThe 3 corner spaces clearly have different meaning for the Monopolists and the Competitors.\n\nNote that this gameboard has the same cities as the French and Dutch edition, whereas that of the Baltic countries have replaced Berlin by their own capital city and Finland even replaced Amsterdam and Madrid by two Finnish cities: Helsinki and Turku.\n\nThe bottom part of the box contains a white cardboard insert foulded such a way that a lower part between two platforms can be used as bankers' tray and store for the houses and hotels.\n\nThere are no Chance- nor Community Chest cards in this game but 2x25 plain, white cards Monopolist and Wettbewerber instead, all with funny illustrations and always with detailed comment, like:\n\nOn the Wettbewerber cards:\n\nDie Regierung hat ein strenges Auge auf Firmen, die Anti-Monopol-Gesetze übertreten. Das ist Ihr Vorteil: JEDER MONOPOLIST ZAHT IHNEN  25. =\n\nThe Government closely see the Antitrust Laws to be obeyd. That is to your advantage.

PAY THE BANK  50.\n\nIt is of course also necessary the two types of players to be taken into account of on the property deeds. That is why they have 2 columns for the prices: at the left for the Wettbewerber and at the right side those for the Monopoliste. The back side of the cards is also to show the property to be mortgaged. In this situation the card must be given the bank, however, the owner can any moment buy it back from the bank. This is also said on the back side of the cards.\n\nThere are only 6 banknotes, printed in grey on colored paper, in the denominations: 1 - 5 - 10 - 50 - 100 and 500. It is not clear why the Rules say in bold \"all banknotes have to be multiplied by 1000 for their real value\". This is of no importance for the course of the game!\n\nThere are only 6 plastic tokens, viz. of each a green and blue one: cone, pyramid and a pawn like a \"cilinder with sphere\".\n\nThe set goes with 35 houses and 15 hotels of plastic, with roof rim and chimney. (Note: The Wettbewerber must place their houses and/or hotels on the name of the field, while the Monopoliste must situate them on the \"H\"-spot.)\n\nBoth dice are white with black pips.\n\nThe first version of this 21st edition was published in 2005 in the USA, soon followed by that of many European countries.\n\nThis edition was \"Made in Spain\".\n\nThe price of this edition was at the introduction  19.95.\n\nEdition: Anti-Monopoly® - Travel edition in a tin - German edition, Ref. 08853\n\n\"Das Wirtschaftsspiel des 21. Jahrhunderts\"\n\nPublisher:University Games Europe B.V.-NL - 2009\n\nDimensions of the tin: 11.5 x 19.2 cm\n\nof the little board: 18.0 x 18.0 cm\n\nThe game:\n\nIt will not be too great a surprise that this travel edition is almost an exact copy of the \"long box\". But there must of course be\n\ncertain restrictions for this smaller version of the game, except for the tiny game board and the nice tin with its insert of soft, white\n\nplastic. Well, there are, viz.:\n\nThe property deeds are smaller: 35 x 60 mm There are no Wettbewerber, nor Monopoliste cards, but one small card with 11 instructions for both kind of players. And\n\nthis is the most drastic change, because all stories and funny illustrations have now been disappeared. The blue side of the\n\ncard has only very resticted instructions for the Monopolists, while the dark green side shows what the Wettbewerber\n\nhave to pay or do receive. The banknotes are miniatures (25x45 mm) of those of the long box. The 6 smaller, wooden tokens are also in green and blue, but now resp. a cone - beam and cylinder. The 35 houses and 15 hotels (note that the colors has been changed) are punched from a small block of foam plastic. The dice are those of the large edition. The Rules are on 4 pages of A6-size.\n\nThis edition was \"Made in China\".\n\nThe price of this edition was at the introduction  9.95."
