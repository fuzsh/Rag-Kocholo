        "text": "The waterways leading from Potsdam into the metropolis Berlin are reminiscent of a time travel into Prussia’s glorious history. Like pearls on a string, fairytale palaces and romantic parks line up along the shore - Babelsberg, Glienicke, Cecilienhof and the gardens on Peacock Island, just to name a few.\n\nNot to forget the elegant villa residencies and numerous yacht clubs in close proximity to the water. The next beach is surely in close reach. Some beaches have gained popularity such as the lido in Berlin-Wannsee. Many travellers show great astonishment about the wealth of woods and green areas in the megalopolis Berlin. The forest of Grunewald and the Berlin Forst are the largest green areas and nearly reach up to Berlin-Spandau.\n\nThis is where you leave River Havel in order to enter the city on the Spree River, or alternatively, you may pick another route for a stopover at Lake Tegeler See. There is probably no better way of discovering Berlin than from the water. Palace Charlottenburg, the new main train station and the government quarter or Museum Island have their own special appeal when marvelling at them from the captain’s perspective.\n\nAfter having passed the double-deck bridge Oberbaumbrücke you are slowly but surely heading toward the green southeast districts of Berlin, passing Treptower Park and the green area Wuhlheide until you reach the most eastern point of your journey - Köpenick. This marvellous district is not just renowned for its local hero, the ‘Captain of Köpenick’, a German impostor a.k.a. Wilhelm Voigt, but also for its terrific location at Lake Müggelsee.\n\nTwo options are available for returning to Potsdam: One is leading directly via the Teltowkanal through southern Berlin connecting the Spree-Oder waterway with Potsdam’s River Havel. The other takes you via the Landwehrkanal, which can only be navigated in a southwest direction, directly crossing the multicultural district of Kreuzberg and Tiergarten, Berlin’s largest inner city park. The next district following is Charlottenburg, where the Landwehrkanal meets River Spree. To be able to enjoy the round tour, a motor boat license is required - which generally applies to the usage of all motor boats within the city limit, and outside the city limit to boats with an output starting from 3.69 kW.\n\nLength: approx. 95 km / 2-3 days\n\nRoute:\n\nPotsdam – River Havel - Spandau - River Spree - Charlottenburg – City centre - Köpenick - Teltowkanal - Potsdam\n\nAlternative Route:\n\nRoute extension by navigating around the Müggel Hills\n\nShore leaves:Potsdam: UNESCO World heritage, e.g.: Schloss und Park Sanssouci, Schloss Cecilienhof; historical city centre with Holländischem Viertel, Glienicke Bridge, Krongut Bornstedt, Filmpark BabelsbergBerlin-Zehlendorf: Glienicke palace and park, Pfaueninsel (peacock island), Strandbad (lido) WannseeBerlin-Charlottenburg: Charlottenburg palaceBerlin-Mitte: Regierungsviertel (government quarter), Museumsinsel (museum island) i.a.Berlin-Treptow: Treptow Park, Archenhold observatoryBerlin-Köpenick: Köpenick palace, listed city centre with town hall, tower Müggelturm"
