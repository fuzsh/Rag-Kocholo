        "text": "Berlin's Jewish Quarter is one of the most important places in the history of 20th century Europe. In recent times, thanks to the Netflix series, Unorthodox, we have learned a bit more about Jewish culture and its norms. Add to this the traces of World War II in this enclave, and we are in for an extremely interesting tour.\n\nThe city of Berlin is full of contrasts and if you are deciding what to see in Berlin on your next vacation, do not hesitate to include in your itinerary a visit to the Jewish quarter. Here I tell you everything you need to know. Will you join me?\n\n1. Take a guided tour of the Jewish Quarter\n\nOf all the guided tours you can take in Berlin, the Jewish Quarter tour is the best alternative to get to know this part of the city and understand more about Berlin.\n\nIt is likely that in a city so full of history and attractions to visit, it is a bit confusing to organize your itinerary. If you take a guided tour you won't have to worry about that, as your tour will be specially designed to cover everything you need to see and know about one of Berlin's best neighborhoods\n\nThe tour will be conducted in English by an expert guide who will tell you about the history of World War II and the Cold War, and how all these events have impacted the city we can enjoy today. I recommend it because it is extremely interesting.\n\nThe tours last about 3 hours and the price starts at 17€, including transfers. The groups are around 10 people, so you will have the space to clarify all your doubts and ask the questions you need about the exciting history of the city.\n\n2. Discover the New Berlin Synagogue\n\nThe Berlin New Synagogue is one of the most important sites to see in Berlin's Jewish Quarter. It is very popular because it survived the Night of Broken Glass, a night of Nazi attacks on all Jewish heritage in the city of Berlin in 1938.\n\nIt is said to be the \"new\" one, because it was built from the remains of the previous synagogue. For example, its beautiful dome and its characteristic facade full of symbolism are part of the old building.\n\nThe synagogue hosts many exhibitions and events, so don't hesitate to check its website before planning your visit. There is also a permanent exhibition with photographs, documents and much more to help you better understand the history of the building and the community in general. It is a must-see in the city of Berlin; don't miss it.\n\nInteresting facts\n\nLocation: Oranienburger Str. 28-30, 10178 Berlin, Germany\n\nHours: From April to September, Monday to Sunday from 10 am to 6 pm and from October to March, Sunday to Thursday from 10 am to 6 pm and Fridays until 3 pm. Throughout the year, it is closed on Saturdays.\n\nAdmission: 7€.\n\n3. Walk through the courtyards of Hackesche Höfe\n\nThe 8 courtyards of Hackesche Höfe are one of the most curious and picturesque places to visit in the Jewish quarter of Berlin. They were built in the early twentieth century between several blocks of apartments and offices of Art Nouveau architecture and is the largest group of enclosed courtyards in Germany.\n\nToday they look a little different than they did at the time, as you can find all kinds of stores and cafes, art galleries and restaurants. Although you will see a lot of tourism in the area, it is one of the favorite places for Berliners to end the day or to meet on weekends.\n\nYou can find them very close to the S-Bahn station Hackescher Markt, next to Hackescher Markt square, a place with a lively atmosphere and ideal to take a break from your day of sightseeing and take pictures.\n\n4. Don't miss the Otto Weidt Museum\n\nWhen you are touring the Hackesche Höfe Courtyards, you can pay a visit to the Otto Weidt Museum, one of the sites worth visiting in the Jewish Quarter.\n\nThis museum was formerly a broom and brush factory, where Otto Weidt employed many Jews who managed to escape deportation. These products went directly to the government, so it was an essential work that could not be interrupted.\n\nThe exhibition is extremely moving and traces the story of this well-known entrepreneur and other silent heroes who found a way to help so many citizens. Definitely one of the best museums to visit in Berlin.\n\nInteresting facts\n\nLocation: Rosenthaler Str. 39, 10178 Berlin, Germany\n\nHours: Monday to Sunday from 10am to 6pm\n\nAdmission: free of charge\n\n5. Be amazed at the Anne Frank Center\n\nIf you have read The Diary of Anne Frank you probably want to know more about the life of this little girl. And if you haven't read it yet, this is a good opportunity to learn all about her story at the Anne Frank Center in Berlin.\n\nThe exhibition consists of a series of original objects that were part of Anne's life, and even an unabridged copy of her original diary and some photographs of her childhood. It is an interactive exhibition where you can take your audio guide in English and immerse yourself completely in this era.\n\nInteresting facts\n\n.\n\nLocation: Rosenthaler Str. 39, 10178 Berlin, Germany\n\nHours: Tuesday to Sunday from 10am to 6pm\n\nAdmission: 7€.\n\n6. Learn much more about the community at the Jewish Cemetery Berlin\n\nThe history of the Old Jewish Cemetery in Berlin is really impressive and you have to visit it during your stay in Berlin.\n\nThis property began to function in 1671, and was assigned to the Jewish families living in the area. In 1943, during the Nazi regime, the cemetery was looted and, as a consequence, the tombstones were destroyed and the bones scattered in places that are still unknown.\n\nToday, you can visit the cemetery and learn much more about this history thanks to the information panels distributed throughout the site. But you will no longer find any tombs or mausoleums; what you can see are the statues at the entrance in commemoration of those who rest there.\n\nBerlin Jewish Cemetery\n\n.\n\nLocation: Schönhauser Allee 22, 10178 Berlin, Germany\n\nHours: Monday to Thursday 8 am to 4 pm and Friday 7.30 am to 1 pm.\n\n7. Get to know Rosenstrass Square\n\nThis square is famous for having been the site of the massive Rosenstraße protests between February and March 1943. These protests were carried out by a group of German women fighting for the liberation of their Jewish husbands, imprisoned in a building right in front of the square.\n\nEventually, the men were freed, and these brave women were remembered forever. You can see the memorial called the Women's Block, which is located in the middle of this square. If you want to know more about this story I recommend the film The House of Roses where you can learn about this time and these historical events reflected to perfection.\n\nIf you look closely, in the middle of the square you can also identify the foundations of what was a new synagogue under construction, which was destroyed during the war.\n\n8. Find the Stolpersteine Plaques\n\nIf you take a walk through the Jewish quarter of Berlin and look closely, you will be able to identify different golden plaques located between the cobblestones of the streets. Surely you will wonder what they correspond to or what they mean.\n\nThis project, created by the artist Gunter Demnig, grows day by day with the contributions of the families of the victims. The relatives of all Jews deported to concentration camps who know where they originally lived in Berlin, can request that a commemorative plaque be placed next to the entrance of that address in the street and be part of this massive open-air tribute.\n\nAs you will notice, the streets of Berlin are alive and tell their own story. Each golden paving stone contains the name of the person, their place and date of birth and their place and date of death.\n\n9. Explore the Hackescher Markt\n\nHackescher Markt square was, in ancient times, a swampy, unused site in the city that later became a butcher's market.\n\nThe site evolved over time and, today, has become a popular square for its great nightlife and large concentration of restaurants and stores of all kinds. You can even find the famous Berlin Hackescher Markt station. It has very good transport connections to the rest of the city.\n\nIf you are lucky enough, you can find somestreet performers playing music and livening up the atmosphere.\n\n10. Visit the Holocaust Memorial\n\nAlthough this monument is not located in the Jewish quarter, it is worth seeing and completes your visit to the Jewish quarter and its culture. Surely you have seen some pictures on the internet, or maybe you know someone who has visited it. But that has nothing to do with experiencing it yourself.\n\nLocated near the Brandenburg Gate at the former location of the Berlin Wall, the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe covers about 2 hectares. It consists of 2711 grid-shaped concrete blocks in tribute to the victims of the Holocaust period.\n\nWalking among the blocks will make you feel confused and lonely, and that is the feeling that Peter Eisenman, the artist, wanted to capture when he thought of this work. His aim was to emulate the sensations felt by the millions of people deported to the concentration camps.\n\nAddress: Cora-Berliner-Straße 1, 10117 Berlin, Germany\n\nHours: Tuesday to Sunday from 10am to 6pm\n\nAdmission: free of charge\n\nWhere to eat in Berlin's Jewish Quarter?\n\nAlthough we can find all kinds of places to eat, the Jewish quarter can be a good opportunity to try new flavors and typical dishes of the Jewish cuisine of Eastern Europe.\n\nIn this small list I leave you some of my favorite places:"
