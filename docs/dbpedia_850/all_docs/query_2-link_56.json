        "text": "The street facades of the Oranienburger Strasse (north side) with the Neue Synagoge (New Synagogue) in its middle. It runs from the Hackescher Markt to the northwest up to Friedrichsstrasse. Originally called Spandauer Heerweg it was still outside the city walls until the 18th century. During the 18th and 19th century it developed into an important street of inner Berlin. As a big number of Jews were living in the area, it was decided to built the New Synagogue here 1859-1866. It was designed by Eduard Knoblauch and August Stüler and after heavy war damages it was (partly) rebuilt in the early 1990s. Today the New Synagogue is used by the foundation Centrum Judaicum. The representative clinker building on the street corner to the left is ther former Kaiserliche Postfuhramt (central post coach station), which was errected in 1875-1881 and designed by the architect Carl Schwatlo. Also heavily damaged it was restaurated in late GDR times 1986-1989. Most recently it was used for exhibitions (like in our panorama) by “C/O Berlin, International Forum for Visual Dialogues”.\n\nThere are more Berlin streets we photographed in our archive, which you can find by yellow markers on our worldmap. In case you are interested in us creating a streetline montage for one of these streets please contact us."
