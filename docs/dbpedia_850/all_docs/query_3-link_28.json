        "text": "Alexanderplatz – three christmas markets at one spot\n\nAlexanderplatz Christmas Market\n\n10a.m.-10p.m. (24.12.: 10a.m.-2p.m.)\n\nU/S: Alexanderplatz\n\nWinterdream at Alexa\n\nMon-Fri 1p.m.-10p.m.\n\nSat-Sun 12(noon).-10p.m.\n\nAlexanderstraße 1\n\nU/S: Alexanderplatz\n\nBerliner Weihnachstzeit/Christmas time by Roter Rathaus\n\nMon-Fri 12(noon)-10p.m.\n\nSat-Sun 11a.m.-10p.m.\n\n12/24/2016: closed\n\n25+26+29/12/2016: 11a.m.-9p.m.\n\nRathausstraße 15\n\nU/S: Alexanderplatz\n\nHere you have don’t only one but three christmas markets in one – more or less. On the actual Alexanderplatz there is the Alexanderplatz Christmas Market where you can find anything and everything between handicrafts, souvenirs, traditional german food and drinks. Right by the shopping mall Alexa you can visit the Winterdream at Alexa market where there is usually german Wurst (sausage), a singing moose and a ride or two. If you continue alongside Alexa on Alexanderstraße you will see the big ferris wheel, and this is where the Berliner Weihnachtszeit is. If you go for a ride in the wheel you have a marvellous sight of the city. This market also has a 600 square meter ice rink and you can even rent skates for 4€.\n\nNostalgic Christmas Market, Opernpalais\n\nEvery day: 12(noon)-9.30p.m.\n\n12/24/2016: closed\n\nSchlossplatz 1\n\nS: Hackescher Markt or Alexanderplatz or Friedrichstraße\n\nU: Märkisches Museum\n\nThe Nostalgic Christmas Market at Opernpalais consists out of 150 small wooden houses where handicrafts, food and drinks are sold. It is also the closes one from the Heart of Gold Hostel, just walk down Tucholskystraße until you hit Unter den Linden and you are there. The market also hosts a ferries wheel which is more than 100 years old. This is a very charming market that lives up to its name.\n\nChristmas Market at Potsdamer Platz\n\ndaily 10 a.m.-10 p.m.\n\n24th until 2.p.m.\n\nAlte Potsdamer Straße 1\n\nS/U: Potsdamer Platz\n\nWhat is probably most special about this market is the Winter World. There is an ice rink and a 12 meter high, 70 meter long toboggan run – or Rodelbahn in German. You can also try the austrian cuisine in a wooden hut that seats more than 200 people and gives a genuine après-ski ambient. On the weekends you can also enjoy some live music here. There is also a handicraft part of the market where you can also watch the items being made.\n\nChristmas Market at Gendarmenmarkt\n\ndaily 11a.m.-10p.m.\n\n24th and 31st until 6p.m.\n\nGendarmenmarkt 1\n\nU: Hausvogteiplatz\n\nS: Brandenburger Tor\n\n1€ admission\n\nThis christmas market walks the extra mile for you, but asks for one euro in return. Besides from the standard stands where you can find more or less anything your heart desires there is also art-exhibitions, a stage where preformances take place and of course unlimited amounts of mulled wine a.k.a. Glühwein.\n\nChristmas Market at Charlottenburg Castle\n\nMo-Thu 2 a.m.-10 p.m.\n\nFr-Su 12-10p.m.,\n\nChristmas holidays: 12-8p.m.\n\n12/24/2016 closed\n\nSpandauer Damm 10\n\nS: Westend\n\nIn 2008 this market got chosen for the title “most beloved christmas market” and is really worthy of it’s royal location. There are about 250 international vendors here and it is truly a beautiful place to be. One of the highlights are the light installations on the castle that casts a romantic glow and feeling over the market. You can enjoy traditional german christmas food and there is a special part of the market for children.\n\nLucia Christmas Market in the Kulturbrauerei\n\nMo-Thu 3 p.m.-10 p.m.\n\nSa&Su 1p.m.-10p.m.\n\nSchönhauser Allee 36\n\nU: Eberswalder Straße\n\nThe Kulturbrauerei is an old brewery in Prenzlauer Berg. Nowadays the only thing brewed here is culture – and an authentic scandinavian christmas atmosphere. There are 60 scandi-style red and white stands. On the 13th of December Lucia is celebrated in Sweden. She is a bringer of light and so is this christmas market. An art-installation stands for heating and you will also find scandinavian delicacies to snack on.\n\nThe Green Market Christmas Edition\n\nAgora Rollberg (indoor & outdoor)\n\nAm Sudhaus 2 (old Kindl Brauerei)\n\n12053 Berlin-Neukölln\n\nU7- Rathaus Neukölln\n\nU8 – Boddinstraße\n\nBus 195 + 104 – Alfred-Scholz Platz\n\nBerlin is truly the Vegan capital of Europe and this is good news for all animal-friendly plant-munchers in Berlin; The first vegan Christmas market in Berlin. It takes place in in the old Kindl Brewery and costs 2€. Besides stands with different stuff there will also be creative workshops for children and adults.\n\nThere are innumerable restaurants in Berlin. Just as pretty much every culture in the world is represented here, so is just about every cuisine. But you should not pass up the chance to try some of the local specialities. Here are some recommendable eateries near the Heart of Gold Hostel in Berlin-Mitte.\n\nSince Covid, many restaurants closed like some below.. we will update this info soon..\n\nRestauration Tucholsky\n\nTorstr. 189, 10115 Berlin\n\nS Oranienburger Str.\n\nTypical food from Berlin and other parts of Germany, ’20s-style design, plenty of outside seating. Just a couple of minutes walk from the Heart of Gold Hostel.\n\nAufsturz\n\nOranienburger Str. 67, 10117 Berlin\n\nS Oranienburger Str.\n\nSeats about 200 inside and another 100 outside, so this is a good place to go in a big group. The food is on the simple side, but they serve over 100 different kinds of beer and more than 40 brands of whisk(e)y. Right around the corner from the Heart of Gold Hostel.\n\nCurry Mitte\n\nTorstr. 122, 10119 Berlin\n\nU Rosenthaler Platz\n\nYou can’t not have a Currywurst while in Berlin. We’re talking about THE Berlin fast food here: grilled sausage smothered in a curry-ketchup sauce, usually served with fries. This is just one of many places to go for a currywurst. The one at the Friedrichstr. train station is good, too.\n\nAll in One\n\nRosenthaler Str. 43, 10178 Berlin\n\nS Hackescher Markt / U Weinmeisterstr.\n\nDid we say currywurst was THE fast food in Berlin? Well, let’s amend that to say that it shares that distinction with the döner kebab. It’s Turkish, but legend has it that it was invented in Germany by one of the millions of Turkish immigrants here. You can’t walk two minutes in any direction in Berlin without seeing a rotating mound of meat on a spit.\n\nKopps\n\nLinienstr. 94, 10115 Berlin\n\nU Rosenthaler Platz\n\nGerman food is all about meat, right? This vegan restaurant dispels that myth with ease.\n\nThere is no arguing the fact that, in terms of sheer quantity, Berlin’s music scene is dominated by electronic fare. But that doesn’t mean that there is no room for those of us who like our tunes the old-fashioned way: played on real instruments by real people. Several members of our staff here at the Heart of Gold Hostel are musicians, and occasionally they will get up on the little stage in our bar and treat our guests to some rock ‘n roll. There are, of course, many other great venues for live music in Berlin. Here are a few of them:\n\nQuasimodo\n\nwww.quasimodo.de\n\nKantstr. 12A, 10623 Berlin\n\nS & U Zoologischer Garten\n\nBerlin’s oldest and most venerable jazz club. Dizzy Gilespie, Art Blakey and Chet Baker, among others, have played here. Not purely a jazz affair nowadays; funk, soul, blues, bossa nova etc. are also on the menu.\n\nSO36\n\nwww.so36.de\n\nOranienstr. 190, 10999 Berlin\n\nU Görlitzer Bahnhof\n\nA punk rock institution right in the thick of things in Kreuzberg, though other genres are also represented, sometimes by big-name bands.\n\nWhite Trash Fast Food\n\nwww.whitetrashfastfood.com\n\nSchönhauser Allee 6-7, 10119 Berlin\n\nU Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz\n\nNot just a burger joint, tattoo parlor and club, but also frequent host to rock ‘n roll bands of all kinds. There is a “Diamond Lounge” downstairs for concerts, but many of the shows take place in the restaurant.\n\nYaam\n\nwww.yaam.de\n\nStralauer Platz 35, 10243 Berlin\n\nS Ostbahnhof\n\nThe home of Berlin’s reggae scene. Kind of a little commune, with African and Caribbean food, a beach bar, a half-pipe, a basketball court, workshops for kids… Will probably have to move soon to make way for the construction of office buildings.\n\nWild at Heart\n\nwww.wildatheartberlin.de\n\nWiener Str. 20, 10999 Berlin\n\nU Görlitzer Bahnhof\n\nSeveral concerts per week, mostly punk, mostly lesser-known bands.\n\nThere is a lot to see in Berlin, but how to go about taking it all in? We at the Heart of Gold Hostel are always happy to provide information and recommendations, but we can only take you as far as the front door. So here is a list of tours of Berlin:\n\nBrewer’s\n\nwww.brewersberlintours.com\n\nThe best way to really get to know a city is by walking around. The best way to learn about what you’re seeing while walking around is by going on a walking tour. And the best walking tours in Berlin, in our humble opinion, are the ones offered by Brewer’s Berlin. They feature a core group of knowledgeable and experienced young people, each with a unique background and perspective on the city. Brewer’s has a free 3.5-hour tour (keep in mind, though, that the guides work for tips) and a 6-hour “Best of Berlin” tour for 15€ (12 for students) every day. And the best part: they pick you up at the Heart of Gold Hostel!\n\nFat Tire Bike Tours\n\nwww.fattirebiketours.com/berlin\n\nBerlin is a bike-friendly city and a pretty expansive one at that, so if you want to cover more ground in less time, these guys can help you out. We also rent out their bicycles directly at the hostel, for you independent-spirited types.\n\nMosaic Tours\n\nwww.mosaictours.org\n\nThere was a concentration camp called Sachsenhausen just outside Berlin, which has been preserved as a memorial. You can go there on your own, but you might want to consider the tours offered by this non-profit. The tour lasts about six hours. It’s 15€ (12 for students), not including the train ticket. Net proceeds are donated to three charities, including Amnesty International.\n\nBerliner Unterwelten\n\nwww.berliner-unterwelten.de\n\nThere’s more to Berlin than meets the eye. Discover Berlin’s underground (by which we mean neither the subway, nor the techno scene), including some World War II bunkers, by going on one of the many different tours offered by this company.\n\nTrabi Safari\n\nwww.trabisafari.de\n\nMaybe the most fun sightseeing tour by driving through Berlin in a Trabi – the famous East German Car – also called “Pappe”. You can also rent a Trabi.\n\nStern und Kreisschiffahrt\n\nwww.sternundkreis.de\n\nBerlin’s waterways include not only the Spree river, but also a series of canals. This company offers boat tours with several different stops where you can get on, including one just a short walk from the hostel. The city sure is pretty when you look at it from a boat on a nice day.\n\nHere is a list of some of the most popular and interesting sights in Berlin, many of which are just a short walk from the Heart of Gold Hostel.\n\nBrandenburg Gate\n\nPariser Platz 1, 10117 Berlin\n\nS & U Brandenburger Tor\n\nA former city gate, rebuilt in the late 18th century. Later caught in no-man’s land between East and West Berlin. (In Reagan’s famous 1987 speech, the line right before “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!” was “Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate!”). Now the most recognizable landmark in Germany, as evidenced by the country’s 10, 20 and 50 cent coins.\n\nHolocaust Memorial\n\nCora-Berliner-Str. 1, 10117 Berlin\n\nS & U Brandenburger Tor\n\nFull name: Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. This enormous work of outdoor abstract art with its concrete slabs and sloping ground may seem like a nice place to have a picnic or play hide and seek, but please keep in mind what it represents.\n\nCheckpoint Charlie\n\nFriedrichstr. 43, 10969 Berlin\n\nU6 Kochstr.\n\nA former Cold War checkpoint, made famous by numerous spy novels. Now a giant tourist magnet, complete with a museum and actors (who may or may not be strippers) dressed up as Soviet and American soldiers, who charge you to have your picture taken with them.\n\nMuseum Island\n\nAm Kupfergraben, 10117 Berlin\n\nS & U Friedrichstr.\n\nThe name says it all. There are five large museums, most built in the 19th century, on this small island in the Spree river. Perhaps the most impressive and internationally renowned of the five is the Pergamon Museum, with its reconstructed monumental buildings from Greek and Roman antiquity, as well as a large collection of Islamic art.\n\nReichstag Building\n\nPlatz der Republik 1, 10557 Berlin\n\nU Bundestag\n\nThe building that housed the parliament of the German empire from 1894 until 1933, when it was damaged in a fire that the Nazis instrumentalized to terrorize opponents and consolidate power. It again became Germany’s parliament building ( Bundestag) when the reunified country’s government moved back to Berlin in 1999. To visit the dome, you have to book in advance: https://visite.bundestag.de/BAPWeb/pages/createBookingRequest.jsf?lang=en\n\nEast Side Gallery\n\nMühlenstr., 10243 Berlin\n\nS Ostbahnhof / S & U Warschauer Str.\n\nPainted by artists from all over the world right after the fall of the Berlin Wall as a monument to freedom, it is by far the longest stretch of the Wall still standing, as well as the largest permanent outdoor art exhibit in the world. The East Side Gallery is currently under threat of partial demolition to create access routes to new apartment buildings. Insert your own sarcastic comment here:\n\nTV Tower\n\nPanoramastr. 1a, 10178 Berlin\n\nS & U Alexanderplatz\n\nThis is Germany’s tallest structure. It is visible from almost everywhere in the city, so conveniently you don’t have to go to the eyesore that is Alexanderplatz to see it. If you do anyway, you can go up to the top, but be prepared for a long wait in line.\n\nKunsthaus Tacheles\n\nOranienburger Str. 54-56a, 10117 Berlin\n\nU Oranienburger Tor\n\nJust around the corner from the hostel, this building covered in giant graffiti murals was home to an artists collective, as well as a series of galleries and a sculpture park. Then everyone was evicted in late 2012. We are not pleased."
