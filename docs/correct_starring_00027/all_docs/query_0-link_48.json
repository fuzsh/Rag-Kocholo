        "text": "High School Musical 3: Senior Year, Canadian PROM-iere\n\nBy: Angela McLean, 11, Mississauga, ON\n\nWhat’s up, Wildcats? It’s time for a fabulous new movie, ‘High School Musical 3: Senior Year’, which opens in theatres today!\n\nThe Canadian ‘PROM-iere’ happened this past Wednesday, October 22, at the Scotiabank Theatre in downtown Toronto and I was lucky enough to attend.\n\nThe event was AMAZING! The crowd was ‘wild’ and cheerleaders were ‘pumping up the party’. There was lots of excitement and plenty of media on hand to greet the stars. In fact, I had the chance to talk to Jacintha Wesselingh of CTV before the stars arrived. She was super nice and gave me some ‘red carpet’ interviewing tips that came in real handy later.\n\nThe celebrity attendees and the stars were fashionably late…but, it was all good…when they arrived, everything started happening at once. Stars and attendees were being interviewed and pictures were being snapped. Some of the celebrity attendees included:\n\n•The Judges from ‘So You Think You Can Dance Canada’ (Tre Armstrong, Luther Brown, Blake McGrath, Jean Marc Genereux)\n\n•The Cast from ‘The Latest Buzz’ (Zoe Belkin, Demetrius Joyette, Justin Kelly, Vanessa Morgan, Munro Chambers)\n\n•Benji Schwimmer, winner from So You Think You Can Dance Season 2\n\n•Aaryn Doyle, who plays ‘Lola Scott’ in ‘Camp Rock’\n\n•Argiris Karras, who plays ‘Riley Stavros’ in ‘Degrassi: The Next Generation’\n\n•Mike Lobel, who plays ‘Jay Hogart’ in ‘Degrassi: The Next Generation’\n\nThen…the CAST arrived…in a yellow school bus (cool eh! )…\n\n•Olesya Rulin, who has played ‘Kelsi Nielsen’ in all the ‘High School Musical’ movies to-date\n\n•Matt Prokop, who plays ‘Jimmy Zara’ in ‘High School Musical 3’\n\n•Justin Martin, who plays ‘Donny Dion’ in ‘High School Musical 3’\n\n•Kenny Ortega, the director of all of the ‘High School Musical’ movies\n\nWhen I had my chance to talk to the some of the stars, they were all wonderful and super nice. Here is what they had to say:\n\nIf there is a High School Musical 4, will the main cast be returning?\n\nKenny Ortega: I think it’s time for a new and wonderful cast with some new faces and new energy.\n\nKelsi Nielsen (played by Olesya Rulin) plays the piano and she is great at it. Olesya, how long have you been playing the piano?\n\nOlesya Rulin: Actually, other than the basics, I don’t know how to play the piano. In the movie, when I play the piano, the hands are not mine. The hands that you see playing in the movie belong to a wonderful pianist…I don’t play at all. I am actually a classically trained ballerina, but, I would love to be able to play piano as well.\n\nWhat was the first thing you did when you got the part in High School Musical 3?\n\nJustin Martin: Well, when I first auditioned they told me that I was too short. When I got a call personally from Kenny Ortega, the director, I thought it was a prank from one of my friends but it wasn’t – it really was Kenny telling me I got the part!\n\nNow that the red carpet was finished…it was time for popcorn and the movie.\n\nThe movie focuses on Troy Bolton (Zac Efron) and Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Hudgens) who can’t imagine the thought of leaving each other after they graduate from high school and head off to college. They go through the ups-and-downs of choosing their college while, at the same time, trying to handle the pressures surrounding senior prom and the year end musical production starring all of the seniors we love. They sing, they dance, they do it all. Yes, the movie is sometimes cheesy…but, hey, that’s the High School Musical we love!\n\nThe movie was ‘FABULOUS’ and my first red carpet was simply ‘AMAZING’!!!\n\nhttp://www.themagazine.ca/2008/10/24/high-school-musical-3-senior-year/\n\nPublished on themagazine.ca\n\nReply · Report Post"
