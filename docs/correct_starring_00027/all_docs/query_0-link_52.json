        "text": "Plot\n\nMitchie Torres (Demi Lovato) returns to Camp Rock to be reunited with all of her camp friends, especially Shane Gray (Joe Jonas), her love interest. The two decide to spend the summer getting to know each other better. Shane arrives to camp with Nate (Nick Jonas) and Jason (Kevin Jonas), whom later reveals to be his brothers.\n\nCamp Star, a new rival camp across the lake, invites Camp Rock to attend a friendly bonfire. After seeing Camp Star's performance, some Camp Rock campers, including Tess Tyler (Meaghan Jette Martin), decide to leave Camp Rock and join Camp Star. Many of the staff members also leave when Camp Star's owner, Axel Turner (Daniel Kash), promises to double their salaries.\n\nNate falls in love with Dana (Chloe Bridges), Axel's daughter; however, Dana's father refuses to let her meet him because he is \"the competition\", much like a Romeo and Juliet scenario. Since most of Camp Rock's staff has left, Mitchie and her friends take upon by themselves the positions of Camp Rock counselors. When discussing the future of Camp Rock, Mitchie and her friends plan a showdown between the two camps at Final Jam. Camp Star agrees as Axel suggests they should challenge each other to Camp Wars, a showdown being broadcast live on TV, a challenge which Mitchie, Shane and the rest of the Camp Rockers accept.\n\nAfter Camp Star's performance, Axel sends text messages to every mobile phone in the western hemisphere, persuading people to vote for Camp Star. At the Final Jam, though Camp Rock puts their all into their performance, Camp Star wins presumably due to Axel's biased campaign. Everyone at Camp Rock becomes devastated and because since they lost Camp Rock has to close down. Despite the loss, Camp Rock's performance earns great applause from the crowd.\n\nThe remaining Camp Rock staff and campers return to Camp Rock. Whilst packing up, Mitchie and Shane finally share a kiss. Afterwards, all the campers and staff gather and sing around the campfire together for one last time. As they sing, many of Camp Star's campers including Tess and Dana show up after having seen the bonfire, and ask to join in. Tess and other members of Camp Star then request to attend Camp Rock next summer because it is more enjoyable than Camp Star, meaning that Camp Rock will have enough campers to remain open for the next summer.\n\n[edit]Cast\n\nDemi Lovato as Mitchie Torres\n\nJoe Jonas as Shane Gray\n\nKevin Jonas as Jason Gray\n\nNick Jonas as Nate Gray\n\nMeaghan Jette Martin as Tess Tyler\n\nAlyson Stoner as Caitlyn Geller\n\nChloe Bridges as Dana Turner\n\nMaria Canals Barrera as Connie Torres\n\nDaniel Fathers as Brown Cesario\n\nAnna Maria Perez de Tagle as Ella Pador\n\nJasmine Richards as Peggy Warburton\n\nRoshon Fegan as Sander Loyer\n\nJordan Francis as Barron \"Barry\" James\n\nMatthew \"Mdot\" Finley as Luke Williams\n\nDaniel Kash as Axel Turner\n\nFranklin Nathaniel Jonas as Trevor Kendall\n\nRobert Feggans as Oliver Jeremy\n\nArisa Cox as Georgina Farlow\n\n[edit]Production\n\nBefore they announced the sequel, Aaryn Doyle revealed via her Twitter that she didn't reprise her role in the sequel because her manager was fired so he didn't try to get her in.\n\nCamp Rock 2: The Final Jam was filmed at YMCA Camp Wanakita in Haliburton, Ontario and Kilcoo Camp in Minden, Ontario beginning in August 2009.[1][2] Reportedly, the hardest scene to film was the opening number \"Brand New Day\" due to inclement weather.

The review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 40% of critics gave the film mixed reviews, based on 5 reviews (3 'Rotten' and 2 'Fresh'), with an average score of 6.1/10.[5] It is strongly believed by many that the film was not given the credit it deserved[citation needed]. However, currently holds an 8.7 making \"Great\" rating onTV.com.[6]\n\n[edit]Ratings\n\nThe film was watched by 7.9 million viewers on its premiere night,[7] about 1 million less viewers than its predecessor. In 2010 it also became the most watched cable television programme that week,[8] as well as the No. 1 movie by number of viewers on 2010's cable television.[7] In its second broadcast on September 4, the film reached 3.7 million viewers.[8] The film also reached 21 million unique viewers over its premiere weekend from September 3 to September 6.[9] In its UK premiere on September 17, 2010 in was watched by 637,000 viewers. In late October 2010, Disney Channel promoted Camp Rock 2 to having extra scenes as shown on the DVD and Blu-ray but when it was the day to air Camp Rock 2 with those extended scenes, the movies was considered a rerun due to the movie not showing any extra scenes â€“ just the basic scenes out of the movie.\n\n[edit]Blu-ray and DVD\n\nThe Blu-ray and DVD were both released in the US on September 7, 2010. The Blu-ray Combo Pack has the Blu-ray, the DVD copy and a digital copy. The bonus features include an interview of the \"new campers\" Chloe Bridges (Dana) and Matthew \"Mdot\" Finley (Luke), as well as international music videos and Rock Along Edition. The DVD regular version has only Rock Along and the movie. It was released in the UK on September 20, 2010, following the movies premiere on TV that past weekend, September 17. The DVD, Blu-ray and Blu-ray Combo Pack was released in Australia on October 20, 2010."
