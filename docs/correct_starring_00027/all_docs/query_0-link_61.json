        "text": "The lyrics of Aaryn Doyle's song \"Our Time Is Here\" speak to the inevitability of change and the uncertainty that comes with it. The opening lines, \"We're done, but it's not over. We'll start it again,\" suggest that although something has ended, another opportunity awaits. The following lines, \"After the end of the day, it keeps getting better. Don't be afraid, we'll do it together,\" indicate that despite the uncertainty, the future holds promise and there is support available to face it.\n\nThe chorus of the song encourages the listener to be proactive and embrace the present moment, \"Come on, come on, you know. It's your time to move. It's my time to move. Come on, come on, let go. Leave it all behind, your past and mine.\" The repetition of \"come on\" and \"your time to move\" emphasizes the sense of urgency and reinforces the idea that the present moment is an opportunity to take action.\n\nThe final verse echoes the themes of change and uncertainty, \"We know, but we're not certain. How can we be, how can we see what's ahead? The road keeps on turning, and all we can do is travel each day to the next.\" It acknowledges that even though we can't predict the future, we still have agency over our lives and can make choices that shape our paths."
