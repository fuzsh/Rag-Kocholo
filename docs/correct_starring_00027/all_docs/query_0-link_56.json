        "text": "In Aaryn Doyle's song \"What it Takes,\" she is questioning who has the qualities necessary to be the kind of guy who can make her shine and be her valentine. She asks who can make her beat flow and get her fired up. Although people have different perceived needs in a partner, everyone can agree that they want someone who treats them sweetly. She emphasizes that respect is necessary to be the one who has what it takes to be her guy.\n\nThe song centers on how actions speak louder than words. Talk is cheap, and she is looking for someone who can earn her attraction by showing that he is good to her. She asserts that she knows her worth, and she is confident that he is out there. Aaryn even takes the chance to approach guys that stand out to her, indicating that she is looking for someone who can reciprocate her effort. The chorus repeats the line \"Who's got what it takes\" to emphasize the need for a partner who can meet her standards."
