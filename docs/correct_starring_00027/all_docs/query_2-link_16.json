        "text": "Camp Rock: Red Carpet Ready in New York…\n\nThe entire cast of Camp Rock was Red Carpet ready in New York City on the eve of June 11th, 2008 for the Camp Rock Red Carpet World Premier at the historic Ziegfeld Theatre on 54th Street in Manhattan. The swarms of media and the overwhelming swell of fans had been lined up to view their favourite Camp Rock stars since early morning. The turnout was tremendous as thousands of fans situated themselves in front of the Ziegfeld to see Disney’s muchly anticipated Camp Rock cast, walk their white Camp Rock Red Carpet for the first time. So if the positive feed back from the delighted fans, who skirted the Carpet was any indication of fan support for the TV premier on June 20th, 2008; our young Camp Rock cast may become Disney’s newest stars. This young cast, were poised, gracious, and personable to fans and media alike. It is no wonder Disney will have a runaway success the likes of High School Musical on their hands. That’s why watching the cast of Camp Rock work the Red Carpet was a thing of beauty. In keeping with Disney’s tradition of creating winners, Camp Rock looks as though it is going to be a runaway success from our preliminary polls taken here in Manhattan by the Red Carpet. According to many Camp Rock fans polled, one of their favourite characters in the movie is our very own Aaryn Doyle/Lola Scott with her featured song “What It Takes”. Their reasons according to many young fans and parents questioned: they like what Lola’s character stands for, they love her voice, and she is a beautiful girl. Some fans especially liked that Aaryn/Lola is so elegantly tall. As for the message in her song, fans say, it is something that is relatable for a lot of young girls, and it hits a positive note. So it was unanimous with Lola fans that she does have “what it takes” to win their hearts and their fan support. Still it was the Jonas Brothers that had the young ladies screaming, in hopes of receiving flirtatious glances from the rock star brothers: as these young heartthrobs embody qualities that girls and young women around the world admire and dream about. So when Aaryn was asked by the media: what it was like being a part of the Camp Rock cast, and working with the Jonas Brothers, her immediate response was, “It was a great experience. The entire cast is so talented and the Jonas brothers were so much fun to work with and they’re really nice. It was awesome.” So, who did Aaryn/Lola, bring to the Red Carpet? According to our source in Manhattan, her proud parents and her lovely New York agent accompanied her on the Carpet. It was no surprise that our fashionista Aaryn looked stunning for the Camp Rock Premier. She wore a fabulous black, white and purple floral hooded Diesel dress accented with a sheik vintage leather Diesel waist belt, and the cutest pair of black Sam Edelman flats detailed with chunky gold chains. Let's not overlook her tasty jewellery (\"to die for\"), sporting an awesome oversized black and silver fashion ring enhanced by fabulous sterling silver arm bangles on the left; complimented on the right by an oversized gold onyx dinner ring ideally teamed with the perfect onyx wrap beaded bracelet; not to mention the totally sheik silver, onyx and crystal drop earrings that casually adorned her lobes. Then last but not least, was the 10” patent leather retro club clutch, that rounded out the ensemble. Aaryn looked stunning indeed, in her rock and roll sheik ensemble. The look was fresh, and and fashion forward. Post premier saw Aaryn very busy at the after party, signing autographs and taking pictures with hundreds of fans. But the night would have to end before midnight for our Canadian Cinderella, as she heads back home for yet another media engagement, and back to her regular life as a high-school student preparing for exams, while trying to balance both her worlds. Congratulations Aaryn Doyle/Lola Scott and the entire Camp Rock cast for a job well done. Enjoy the success. \"Camp Rock\" another Disney Original success."
