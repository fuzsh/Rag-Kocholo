        "text": "Hello and Welcome to the Chat Club on Camp Rock & Jemi {Joe&Demi}🤗\n\nIt is a 2008 Disney Channel Original Movie starring the Jonas Brothers and Demi Lovato. The music is written by Julie Brown, Paul Brown, Regina Hicks and Karen Gist. The movie is directed by Mathew Diamond and produced by Alan Sacks.\n\nThe Plot\n\nThe story follows Mitchie Torres (Demi lovato), an aspiring young musician who is hoping to become a professional singer. Mitchie wants to go to a music camp for aspiring young musicians named \"Camp Rock\". Since the family can't afford the tuition, Mitchie's mother (Maria Canals Barrera) arranges to cater food for the camp, thus allowing Mitchie to attend. Mitchie tries to conceal this from her friends at camp by saying her mom is president of Hot Tunes TV China.\n\nSpoiled rock star Shane Gray (Joe Jonas) has been assigned to be in charge of dance classes for one month at Camp Rock by his bandmates Jason (Kevin Jonas) and Nate (Nick Jonas). Shane hears Mitchie singing, and falls in love with the voice, but does not know the identity of the singer. Shane spends much of the movie searching for the girl with the voice. Shane and Mitchie have various interactions, and, when Shane learns of the person she pretends to be, a romance between the two blossoms until he finds out that she was lying about who she was. But when he realizes that Mitchie is the girl that he had heard singing. re-instates their relationship.

Her dream is to go to Camp Rock, but her family cannot afford the camp because they're not wealthy. The only way she could go was if her mother would be the cook, and she tries to hide that fact by lying about her background. She is so excited when she meets Tess Tyler, the total snob of Camp Rock but she told a lie about her mother so she can hang out with her.\n\nShane Gray (Joe Jonas) Shane is a 18 year old famous lead singer of \"Connect 3.\" He is sent to Camp Rock, in hopes that it would help him, and get rid of his arrogant attitude. At the camp, a voice that he enjoys, and spends most of his time trying to find the girl who sang (who is really Mitchie.)

She panics,but he just wants to start over again.\n\nTess Tyler (Meaghan Jette Martin) Tess is the daughter of the famous T.J. Tyler, and one day wishes to be a singer, like her mother. She is a snob, and often gets her way, even if she has to be mean to people.

She tries to tell Mitchie not to be friends with Tess, but Mitchie is too over obsessed with being popular and thinking for the best of it. She wants to be a music producer, and is often seen composing music on her laptop, and dancing her heart out.\n\nElla (Anna Maria Perez de Tagle) She is Peggy's best friend and a little air-headed and is often seen as the dumb one.

They made me want to see the movie really badly, and when it did priemere, I wasn't dissapointed. But later, I started actually thinking about the movie, and it's pros and cons. Mitchie Torres, the main character of the film, is a young teenage girl with dreams to make it big in the music world. She is psyched that she can go to Camp Rock under the condition that her mother be the cook, and that she helps out in between classes. Intimidated by the rich snob kids at camp, Mitchie lies about who she is.\n\nShane, the male protagonist of the film, is a stuck up pop star who would rather be anywhere else than Camp Rock at first. This part is pretty good, and you can immediately tell that there's going to be a love story involved. Eventually, Shane finds out that Mitchie lied about who she is all along, but then forgives her on stage when he realizes that she's the girl with the voice he was looking for. I mean, I can sort of understand that, but either Shane has an extremely soft heart, or Mitchie has a dazzling effect on him. If I was in his place, I must say that even is she was the \"girl,\" I wouldn't be able to forgive her so easily. I'm definitely not saying that the movie's bad, I loved it and still do! But I felt that at the end, they rushed it a bit and added unnessary scenes. In the pop up version of Camp Rock that aired on Disney Channel, it was mentioned that there was going to be a scene with Tess and her mother, but they deleted it for a romantic scene. That was definitely uncalled for, because the Tess scene would have been heart-melting and sad to see, and it would have added an affect to the movie that barely and Disney Channel movies have. Plus, when Mitchie lied about her mother, it made me feel like she was embarassed of her mother's job and that she was embarassed of her mother herself. I didn't like that point, which is why I didn't take such a favorable turn to Mitchie. But also, I understand....Mitchie had problems in school, and that could have caused her the want to be popular. So she was right and wrong in a way, but I could truly understand....\n\n❤️ MeMbErS ❤️\n\ntalkativetaurus\n\n❤️ nidhieya ❤️\n\nPrInCeZz07\n\n❤️ MusicalAiswarya ❤️\n\nchhilt\n\n❤️ Miley_hp ❤️\n\nk-ekta fan\n\n❤️ aish_punk ❤️"
