Keeping Up with 15 Year Old Aaryn Doyle On the Scene...

Fifteen year-old Aaryn Doyle star of Disney’s hit movie musical “Camp Rock” performs solo at exclusive private live concert for pal and clothier heiress, Gabi Liberman, for her “Super Sweet 13 - Batmitsfa” thrown at the Factory in Toronto on Saturday December 13th, by parents John and Beryl, and a notoriously glamorous affair it was. Everything about the evening was top notch. From the open bar and the exquisitely catered menu, to the beautiful and talented guest celebrity entertainer flanked by her burly security guards in attendance, with all guests dressed to impress. Yes indeed, everything and everyone was elegantly turned out and attired in ensembles of black… The scene was truly Hollywood North, and the night was pure magic with the perfect dazzling of Disney starlet magic to top off the evening. According to the young guests/fans they had not a clue that they would be having a live performance at the party… But to have Lola Scott/Aaryn Doyle, from Camp Rock perform live… “How amazingly awesome… Oh my God! You are our absolute favourite says, her young fans and party attendees, and we love your song What It Takes and you have like the most amazing voice.” According to Aaryn Doyle, “Camp Rock and all it’s fans is a humbling experience and I still pinch myself. But the best part about performing at the Factory was performing my own original songs live for the first time, to an audience of my peers and that they loved them. Wow! It was incredible. What a Rush! The fans are what make doing what I do worth it… They are great. And then the other perk was doing it for Gabi, as her birthday surprise… She is so super sweet and her family is pretty awesome. Also a special shout out and props to DJ Justin & Magen Boys crew for doing such a great job.”

Fan frenzy while Aaryn performed on stage was enthusiastic and robust… The reactions to her songs were overwhelming. “Reflection” and “Weekend” were the clear favourites. After the performance fans were asking for copies of the songs, as Aaryn signed autographs on everything from promotional pictures to boxers, cell phones and even digital cameras. Then there was the photo-op with the young star and her fans before she had to be whisked away to yet another commitment where she appeared with a TO band in Yorkville at the Four Seasons Hotel, where fans requested more pictures before her busy night could end… And that’s a wrap for December 2008.

Aaryn at L’Oreal Fashion Week 2008 in TO…

L’Oreal fashion week 2008, kicked off in Toronto in style, to bright lights, cameras, and action as stylistas and celebrities stalk the red carpets and models walk the runway. With a spectacular main tent at Nathan Philips Square in the heart of down town Toronto all eyes were on the fashion event of the year. From start to finish Toronto’s fashion week was a spectacular success. Featuring many of Canada's Top Designers and Design Houses as well as up and coming Canadian design talents from the industry and entertainters like Aaryn Doyle lending their talents to specific fashion week shows and events.Aaryn Doyle closed out the Diesel Kids spring show on the third day of fashion week with an energetic performance of Start the Party from the Disney movie Camp Rock in which she starred as Lola Scott, which was studio mixed with Don’t Stop, one of her original songs. The performance and the fashion show, was well received by the audience. The show opened with flight attendants, then followed through with children’s spring fashions and vacation cruise wear. The outfits were colourful and fresh, and they were accessorized with Hawaiian leis, travel cases, and knapsacks, co-ordinating with foot-wear from rubbers to sandals as our young models strutted their stuff in everything from leisure to beach wear. Then to wrap-up the show Aaryn Doyle started the party, with her up beat Camp Rock performance and the Diesel models all joined her on the runway for a final walk.

Aaryn was dressed in black Diesel Tuxedo short jumper with a printed white Diesel T-top below. The outfit was accessorized with black leggings and a trendy pair of knee-high black suede slouch boots, a black wrap beaded onyx bracelette, silver rings, a chunky onyx fashion ring, sterling heart choker, large black woven hoop ear-rings and a diamond solitaire ear stud, while confidently sporting a stylish faux-hawk, that gave this urban artist a soft rock edge. The look was retro sheik and Aaryn pulled it off beautifully. Preping for show time... Doing a quick ET Canada Interview... Next stop for Aaryn, L’Oreal Fashion Week, LG Fashion Fusion Finale show which closed out fashion week with a bang. But this time she attended as VIP and stylista on the red carpet rather than being the performer working the runway. Aaryn and all guests in attendance had the pleasure of taking in Maroon 5 live in concert as well as viewing a series of randomly staged incredibly fabulous fashion shows throughout the evening. What a way to cap off Toronto fashion week 2008. During fashion week the media, paparazis and fans caught up with Aaryn Doyle at the HSM3 Red Carpet Promier in Toronto where she signed autographs, greeted fans, interviewed with the press while hanging with friends from the casts of Degrassi and the Latest Buzz. Then it was back to her other life as teenager, student, and musician…

And that’s a final edit till the New Year.
