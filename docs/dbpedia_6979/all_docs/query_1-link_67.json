I have to do even the shortest journeys 10-20 times before I can remember the way, and I can easily get confused going from one room to another in a large house. Directions are to me what words are to the severely dyslexic. Is this a scientifically-recognised problem?\n\nJoanne Sheppard, Salford, England\n\nI can't answer this but I have the same problem as you. It is beyond a bad sense of direction - and people find it hard to believe that I can be so bad! (especially my husband who is a cartographer and never lost). I always describe it to people as similar to dyslexia but with directions - almost feeling like I am lacking a 'magnetic centre of direction' in the brain - so you could be on to something. In my case, it runs in the family too.\n\nLiz, Heath and Reach\n\nMe too! I started searching the net today on the subject, but so far I haven't had any luck finding any scientific explanations for this \"condition\". One article I found suggested that sense of direction is related to the function of the brain's hippocampus area, so I'll just start searching for more info on that.\n\nAntti Kovalainen, Helsinki, Finland\n\nI did some searching, and it might be a form of something that I came across termed 'Spatial Dyslexia'. Even if it isn't, I'm going to adopt this term!\n\nLiz Mortimer, Heath and Reach, England\n\nI am no expert, but having worked with children with all kinds of special needs, I would suggest that you may have a very mild form of dyspraxia, a condition which normally implies inability to plan complex actions, or form that kind of memory of a complex action which allows you to do it without thinking.\n\nJust as persistent inability to get 'i' and 'e' in the right order might be considered part of a dyslexic spectrum, inability to use directions or remember a route might be part of the dyspraxic spectrum.\n\nGary Dunion, Edinburgh, UK\n\nI too have this problem. It's very difficult having something approaching half a brain and able to converse reasonably sensibly - and yet when trying to find my way around in relatively new places all I seem to have in my head is a vast expanse of nothing. Even with well rehearsed long journeys, I seem unable to \"hold\" the entire journey in my head. I experience what can only be described as a series of \"sequences\" which, in the correct order, \"become revealed\" as I progress through the journey. Now I live in a small town designed on the grid system. I have never experienced any direction problems living here. This was much to the initial amazement of my husband who, knowing I was going off exploring alone in the early days of our arrival, was convinced he'd never see me again. I also use a bicycle a lot here. For myself, I've found that the speed of cycling seems to be the optimum one for remembering journeys. (I'd never ride a bike in the UK though - much too dangerous.) Many years ago there was a TV programme in the UK about this very subject. I missed it!\n\nSheila Kirby, Esbjerg, Denmark\n\nLordy! I just found people with my problem. My girlfriend is just as unforgiving when it comes to my utter uselessness with directions. I am very spatially aware when it comes to sports and hand-eye coordination, and I'm brilliant with a map and compass, but I cannot for the life of me keep directions in my head. I truly believe it is largely to do with what is important to you - for 2 reasons. In my case I spend my time thinking about and analysing, for instance, people, rather than roads, lefts and rights. Directions are not important to me. The flip-side of that is that it can then be too important to you to make up for a past record of being rubbish with directions, and actually end up building an anxiety around the subject which makes it all the more difficult to focus on.\n\nSeamus, Chinnor UK\n\nI agree with the respondent who suggests you are probably mildly dyspraxic. Most people still don't get diagnosed (I didn't until I was 34 and I had to get it done privately). I found learning to drive difficult and didn't pass until the 5th attempt and now I am driving ok but I still have huge problems with directions especially at roundabouts. I often get lost in my hometown and I have lived here all my life.\n\nPeter Loxley, Basingstoke, UK\n\nIt is Dyscalculia http://www.dyscalculia.org/calc.html - May be unable to comprehend or \"picture\" mechanical processes. Lack \"big picture/ whole picture\" thinking. Poor ability to \"visualize or picture\" the location of the numbers on the face of a clock, the geographical locations of states, countries, oceans, streets, etc. - Poor memory for the \"layout\" of things. Gets lost or disoriented easily. May have a poor sense of direction, lose things often, and seem absent minded.\n\nJules Ong, Penang, Malaysia\n\nI have the same problem. I also describe myself as having directional dyslexia. I haven't found much on the web about it and wish someone would do a study! It can get dangerous at times, like when I end up in a scary section of town, even when I'm in my own hometown.\n\nRachel Kaye, Texas, United States\n\nOne consistency I notice with people who complain about the \"lack of sense of direction\" is the above average intelligence with other spheres in life. More often than not, they hold important occupational positions and have better outcomes at education than people who can get from one place to another without a thought. I wonder if this a sacrifice to boost other elements of the brain\n\nFareed Janjua, Bradford, UK\n\nAll the problems listed above affect me. I can get lost at the airport if I wander off to shop or use the loo, and I can find myself terrified with fear.\n\nMadeline Haworth, Blackburn, England, UK\n\nSometimes it seems to be familial. My wife, her mother, her son & daughter, twin granddaughters, her daughter's children all have it, whatever \"it\"is, Always are uncertain which way to turn at intersections. Seem to be of above-average intelligence in other areas and extreme motivation in all areas; work, athletically, creatively.\n\nAlbert B Siewers, MD, Staten Island, New York, USA\n\nI have the same problem it is called 'Directional Dyslexia' or 'Geographical Dyslexia'(Dyslexia= Inability to learn, in our case its roots and landmarks) There is no cure for Dyslexia,the only thing we can do is to support each other...yeah we need a support group.\n\nNeha, Banglore, India\n\nI feel much better knowing that I'm not 'abnormal'. It was extremely embarrassing when bringing friends home and being unsure where to turn at intersections. And I'm talking about going home to where I have lived for 20 years!\n\nCapri Lee, New York, USA\n\nYou mean there is a real term for all the times I felt like an idiot for not knowing my way around...to the point of getting lost coming back out of the restroom at a restaurant??! I do believe there is some truth to being the type that is always deep in thought while driving so not logging landmarks as I go but it goes beyond that. There really should be a support group for this \"disorder.\" My reliance on a GPS seems to be making matters worse -now I really don't try to know where I am.\n\nFrances, Louisville, US\n\nHey Guys. Thank you so much for this thread - It is so relieving to find others like me. Interesting that we seem to be more intelligent in other areas - I am excellent drawer and master all creative activities, very athletic.. BUT I can't seem to find my way around - even though I know it should be a quite simple matter? I'm certain that I have direction dyslexia now that I know more of it. Here is a link to something that you should really consider reading. Thanks and blessings from Denmark.\n\nJakob M Nielsen, Spjald, Denmark\n\nI have also heard the term Directional Dyslexia. I didn't know had this problem until I began driving 35 years ago. Once I began travelling alone, I was not able to find my way to many places I had travelled to all of my life. I have no other deficits that I am aware of, but even with a GPS, I am still not able to travel too far on my own without getting seriously lost. It is a miserable problem. At least we are not alone!\n\nRobin, Scotch Plains , US\n\nPhew!!! So there are others... simply great to know! I feel so dumb when I sometimes forget my way on routes which I take on a regular basis. Of late I've been trying to consciously memorise the intersections, turns etc during journeys but sometimes if the journey is too long I can hardly remember half of it at the end... :(\n\nSM, India\n\nI have problems with parking a car as I sometimes can't distinguish between turning left and right. Sometimes, I get confused with putting on shoes as well. I have no problem with words. I give excuses for not driving as I feel embarrassed. Anyone else?\n\nGeorgina, Singapore\n\nIs this real? I mean this isn't a joke right. I have a horrific sense of direction and i thought it was just me. I was lost yesterday going home from a concert and I was so embarrassed and upset over it. Not only was I embarrassed but also stressed because I was literally going in circles. I didn't know other people went through this too. I felt like an idiot for having such a poor sense of direction and I couldn't understand why other people can remember and find places so easily. How can I make this better and not get lost going around the block.\n\nJulie , Brooklyn United States\n\nI wrote a therapy programme for someone with this problem (I am trained as an Occupational Therapist). I wrote up the programme as an e -book. You can find it on www.senseofdirection.co.uk/StepsInTheRightDirection.htm?hop=0\n\nNina Donohoe, Cheltenham Glos\n\nHaving read these posts..I am so glad I am not alone. I have always had these problems too..and now having passed my driving test and moved to a new town..it is a nightmare. I have driven to the most shortest journeys..done myself maps and still panic the next time knowing I haven't a clue where I'm going. Even going to the shop round the corner gets me confused. If I know I have to use the car..my stomach is in knots all day worrying about getting lost. I too can never find my way back from restrooms and it is all getting to the point of ridiculous. So glad I am not alone..but if anyone has a cure..please share it. Also my new house isn't that big..but still get confused coming out of the bedroom and turning left instead of right to use the bathroom arghhhh..\n\npaula , England\n\nI am 32 and have so far been too afraid to learn to drive due to my constant confusion with direction and which is left and right. I find department stores to be like labyrinths and have accidentally wandered into stock rooms on numerous occasions. I went travelling round Peru, Bolivia and Brazil for 6 weeks with a friend 3 years ago and she was astounded at my inability to remember my way around suggesting it was because I did not pay attention and relied on others, I will admit that I am sometimes guilty of this but only as a result of having been wrong so many times before when I have paid attention and tried my best to take it all in. I have trouble with short term memory but combat this effectively with diaries and phone reminders, my long term memory on the other hand is shockingly good - I even remember the words to songs from primary school and what type of shoes people wore on the first day of secondary school and people have often said I bring up things they have said and done that they don't remember whatsoever. I asked to screened for dyspraxia last year and was told I do not have it however no test was carried out relating to sense of direction or remembering sequences of instructions (another thing I have always had difficulty with). I seems to me that there might be a link between poor short term memory and good long term memory (btw once I have somewhere stored in my long term memory I will remember it forever)\n\nJulia, Carlisle UK\n\nI have struggled with this \"having no sense of direction\" for a long time and its very frustrating until now. New routes are stressful for me, GPS comes in handy although I still get lost using it. I also get lost inside a building. I know how to get to my work but if I'll add an additional route like going to my gym I have to pass by where I live first before getting there.I am doomed if the road I have memorized is closed.It feels good to know we are not alone.There is a part in our brain that is not fully developed and I agree with the one who said we have exceptional abilities just not on directions.I am an artist and a nurse, so I can say I'm not stupid when it comes with other things.:)\n\nvelvetdreams, Philippines USA\n\nI, too, have the same long term to short term memory imbalance, and I think it contributes significantly to my lack of directional sense. Although I can tell my left from my right, it takes a tremendous amount of brain power and repetition to consciously figure out how I am oriented with respect to where I want to go. I think it's because I'm trying to memorize the sequence of lefts and rights to get from one point to another. If I don't actively do this to orient myself, then I will be hopelessly lost even when I'm outside and driving where I can see landmarks. I'd probably have to memorize some sequence of landmarks if I didn't want to rely on \"left\" and \"right\", which may be marginally better since landmarks never change. My directional dyslexia is especially terrible when I'm inside a building, even if it's a school building where I spend >75% of my time! I had to determine (largely by trial and error) which direction to turn after exiting a lecture hall to reach the appropriate exit so I wouldn't have to backtrack once I got outside the building. It's so embarrassing but I'm glad I'm not alone!\n\nJenny, Boston USA\n\nThis same thing is true for me, I am notoriously horrible with directions and I get nervous when I am put in situations where I have to give directions. I am glad that there is a term for it and I am not alone because I hate feeling like I'm stupid because I can't remember simple directions that everyone else remembers with ease. I am a very good student, I graduated college with a 3.6 gpa and I have a strong affinity for philosophical matters. I am intelligent; more intelligent than all of my friends but I still get lost while journeying to the simplest of places. I hate it and its not fair, but at least I'm not alone.\n\nJermaine Felder, Jersey City United States\n\nJust googled this today and came across this site - finally, other people understand!!! I get lost in shopping centres, parking lots, can't find my way from one place to another if it is outside my regular route...\n\nAnn, Canada\n\nThis is me. I do not buy the dispraxia argument. I have a very good sense of space with things in-front of me. I can draw and visualise. I can walk into a room but to leave I need to make a conscious effort to find the way out. If things look similar from street to street or rooms look the same I can't navigate at all.\n\nSimon, London UK\n\nI too have this problem and have had it all my life. I'm 54 and the last few years I have been trying to sort it out by making myself do journeys that I am unsure of. It has not been successful. I even get lost when walking the dog. My husband can find his way anywhere, even if he has never been there before.He says he feels as though he has an inbuilt compass. I come out of a shop and don't know which way I have to go. I used to get lost in schools, colleges, hospitals, etc which made me feel very panicky. It is a very frustrating problem which is very confidence draining but I am also relieved to hear that it is so common. I also have a lot of dreams about not being able to find my way around.\n\nJackie Reynolds, Argaka, Cyprus\n\nI feel so at home to find I'm not alone. I get made fun of all the time. I am 40 & still have never mastered the whole left and right thing. No one understands the difficulties I encounter due to this challenge.\n\nAnna, Aguanga Usa\n\nI am so relieved to know I am not alone. When attempting to retrace my steps I invariably turn in the wrong direction, even when exiting a room, store, etc. I started wondering whether it had anything to do with being left-handed? More importantly, is there anything that can be done to fix this?\n\nCecilia , Johannesburg South Africa\n\nI am pleased others are the same as me. I have been shouted at some many times, because I cannot remember directions. I have always been a slow learner, and have to write down things in order to remember. I am now doing a driving instructor course, on with my part 3, and worried so much that I have taken on something beyond myself.\n\nKaren Wilson, newcastle upon tyne England\n\nThanks to all for sharing. My son, now middle aged adult, has always had this directional problem in spades. First real notice came when we learned that he could not find his classroom or other locations in school. He can learn to go fromn Point A to Point B or from point A to point C. But to get from point B to point C, he must first return to point A. Interestingly, he might refer to going DOWN to New York from Florida...or UP to California from Chicago. His mother has similar problems. His sister and I do not.\n\nWarren Rucker, Ruckersville, Virginia U.S.A.\n\nThis makes me feel so much better. I learned to drive late in life (54) and thought it was down to that but reading these posts it sounds so much like me. I dont get lost in my own town but going anywhere strange is a nightmare and frightens me to the point I will make excuses not to go. I am extremely dangerous in a strange town with lots of lanes mainly because I panic and all rational thinking goes out the window. I also find that even when I do find a place successfully reversing the route on the way back is very confusing for me.\n\nlinda mansfield, Chippenham, United Kingdom\n\nYes, that's me. I'm finding it's getting worse as I get older, too, though maybe I'm just less confident. Driving is hopeless, and walking is almost as bad although at least on foot you don't have to find a side street to turn round in (and then get disoriented by turning round and go the wrong way out of the side street ...). I feel as if the magnetic direction-sensing gizmo everyone else seems to carry inside them is broken in me, and it just spins helplessly whenever I change direction. I currently live in New Haven (CT) where the city is constructed as a grid around a central square, which should make things easy but I swear the square spins round as soon as my back is turned. I took a short cut home the other day and ended up back where I started. I think I don't take enough notice of landmarks, partly because of a lifetime of allowing myself to be guided by others whenever possible, and partly because to some extent things look different each time I see them. Just like the square in New Haven, I suspect them of having moved when I wasn't looking. Hopeless. Very very glad to hear the stories of all you other lovely people and know I'm not alone!\n\nSue Edgar, Banbury UK\n\n@Jackie Reynolds - THE DREAMS!! OMG, never put it together. I can hardly remember dreams...how ppl can wake and tell you what they dreamed-not me, not a clue. I wake up BLANK. The dreams I can remember always have to do with me never being able to get out of a building, area, etc. or never making it to my destination. I spend the entire dream trying to get to my destination but never making it before I wake. Also, a new building with wood beams indicating where walls and rooms will go, I cannot picture the finished room/house. Our company has office on 4th & 5th floor of hospital. I get on the elevator and get off confused EVERY time.\n\nRobin Jackson, Atlanta USA\n\nOmg. I just felt like crying after reading this. No one seems to understand, I've never encountered people who have suffered to the same degree as me before. Even to the point of getting lost in buildings I've been in hundreds of times. Or having a blue sign as a landmark which gets changed then getting completely thrown by it. I won't go on motorways because of the roundabouts, I'd never know when to get off and have real panic attacks about it. It has stopped me doing so much in life. Everybody smirking as you take a wrong corner in the supermarket hall you grew up in, the fear when need to go to a new place. Seeing that evil yellow diversion sign that fills you with dread. I have above average abilities in some fields and have quite often heard \"how can someone so intelligent be so dense, ha ha!\" I've had my kids as young as 5 telling me where to go! Even on a route I know by landmarks, I can't do it in the dark and put me at a random point and I'm lost. Show me a short route 20 plus times and I'll still get lost and have no memory or sense of where to go. It's actually very sad because people don't laugh and ridicule dyslexia but we put up with it, often agreeing and apologising for our stupidity all the time. I'm glad I'm not alone. Sheila.\n\nSheila Kempster, Southampton Hampshire England\n\noh my goodness how nice to stumble upon a site that makes me feel 'normal'. For me driving is fine in familiar territory but outside of that its like I have to concentrate so hard I think fire must shoot out my ears!!! Its so frustrating!! Highways, road maps, malls especially any direction that requires turning around!!! If you want to lose me ...just put me on an exit ramp! its like I have to visualize everything, if not I'm in 'lost town'. I could tell some stories about me that would make you cry or laugh!! But yeah, it affects more people than you realise..!\n\nGladys Diener, United States\n\nI have the same problem. Memorizing the route before leaving helps but if I miss a turn I am lost. While coming out of a shopping complex for example, I have no idea which is the way back home. I use the GPS and once I am on the right road I remember the route so maybe the situation is not so bad.\n\nSuraj, Gangtok, India\n\nI have lived with this handicap for many years. I am top of the bell curve in left handedness and wonder if there is a connection\n\nAnn Bristow, Broughton Village ,Australia\n\nMe too guys! I get lost coming out of bathrooms, trying to find stores in our mall that I've been to a million times since I was 7. And just forget the roads. It probably took me literally 30 times to memorise how to get through my neighbourhood. If I had a big house I'd be lost. Wow, someone needs to study us all. :) I VOLUNTEER!\n\nCassondra Carito, Heath, USA\n\nSo glad I'm not the only one out there! Looking at a map just confounds me, and I feel so stupid. I only drive for very short distances, and even so I am at terrible risk of getting lost even in familiar areas. When someone asks me for directions I get majorly embarrassed. It doesn't help that my boyfriend knows the city like the back of his hand, and if I ever have to drive him somewhere, I think I might die! Thank goodness for GPS, it's my only hope.\n\nAbraille Jordan, Milwaukee United States\n\nI am 73 years old and always had this problem. Trying to get directions from someone - they talk too fast and you shake your head yes. It is very embarrassing. They say turn right after 2 stop signs. As soon as you get back in the car you are in a sweat as you can't remember a thing the nice person has told you.\n\nBarbara Lord, Hamilton Ontario Canada\n\nI am looking for an answer to this too as I have a terrible sense of direction. My family get annoyed at me when they try to give me directions and I just can't take it in. If I, by some miracle, find my way I can never reverse it to come back. I feel so stupid but no matter how hard I try I loose concentration and get lost. I am sure there must be a scientific reason for this.\n\nLilian Docherty, Edinburgh Mid lothian\n\nI have this problem and I found out a few years ago my dad does too. East and west kick my ass when I'm driving. I get lost in my own home town - not really lost, but I'll have a 50/50 chance of turning the wrong way on streets I've been many times. It happens indoors as well. I will simply not know which way to turn when walking out of a room in a place where I've been for years. And maybe I can find my way *to* a place but forget trying to \"invert\" the trip to find my way back! GPS has been a savior (\"turn left on blah road\") but it's a crutch. I have PhD and teach at a university and have extremely good recall with music, which may or may not be relevant. I can sing entire albums from start to finish but I go the wrong way when trying to exit the building I work in! The brain is a funny thing. What got me to this place was a 60 Minutes (TV show) special on \"Face blindness\" which I found fascinating and made me wonder if it's a second cousin to \"directional dyslexia.\"\n\nLeigh Orf, Mount Pleasant, Michigan USA\n\nFirstly I'm dylexic so considered yourselves lucky! Secondly my sense of direction is so poor its unbelievable! My first day at a new job, I spent 20 mintues trying to find my way out . Then the manager saw me I told her I was struggling to find the exit. She looked at me like I was a lobotomized gibbon. Not only that I get lost in central london and I used to be a tour guide ! Ohh the shame.\n\nTom Baker, London United Kingdom\n\nIt' so good to know that I am not alone in not knowing my sense of direction. I too cannot find the exit in big shopping malls and has countless times of wandering around in car parks finding my car. Even when I have used the route many times, I get confused when I drive in the reversed order. Now I realise that my sense of direction also affects my line dance skills. Any dance that requires me to change direction - 180 degrees turn, full turn, left and right turn I get confused, panic and totally cannot follow the steps. My poor sense of direction is worst at night.\n\nGraceWong, Ipoh Malaysia\n\nI got lost coming home today. I was given directions to my cousin's house,and with much anxiety, made it;however, as always. the return trip was hell. I have no idea where I went wrong, and terms like 95 North and 95 South are useless to me. I graduated with a 4.0, voted best Enlish student by my professors, so everyone thinks I am very bright. Only those closest to me know my secret. To me, north is whichever way I'm facing. I know that's not so, but it seems so. I had to develop a short hand note system as early as the fourth grade because I had to write down everything the teacher said which forced me to focus. Otherwise, I would get lost in the ramifications of her first sentence, and while I was mulling it over, she was going on to something else. My fifth grade teacher threw a book at me while I was standing at the chalkboard trying to do long division. Her words still ring in my ears, which were hot with shame,\"Sit down, Stupid, you can't learn this.\" She is one of the reasons I became a teacher-she was everything I would never be to a child. As far as dreams, my constant nightly terror was a large granite wall, cold and unending. I couldn,t find my way around it. I couldn't see the top of it. I spent all night it seems in that dream world trying to find the end of the wall. I am right handed, and I believe, extremely right brained-very good with words-spoken,read, or written. I am so disorganized that I can never find anything, and when I try to organize I overdo it, and can't remember which folder I filed it in. I have no sense of time either. In short, as my husband says, my sh_t is scattered. How does someone like me achieve a 4.0 and hold down a teaching job for 27 years which, by the way, nearly killed me because it took me all night to grade papers and plan? Mama has trouble with right and left also. The pencil in the air trick? I thought I invented that one.\n\nVickie Lennon, Wilmington, USA\n\nI can hardly believe it; I thought I was alone! I could not find my way to school, then got lost at work. I get lost in ladies toilets going into another cubicle thinking it is the exit. I cant find my seat in church if I go forward for communion! I go round in circles in supermarkets passing the same shelves maybe 4 times. I can step out of a shop and think I am in another town, things are not quite 'the same' it has been so bad that my husband has to come and find me. Driving is a nightmare and closed roads and diversions leave me with severe panic. I could tell of incidents that would make you die laughing but I am crying inside. I am now 73yrs old but can recall this manifesting itself when I was about 11. Bless all you brave people for confessing, this is the first time I have done this myself.\n\nTheresa Solly, Kent England\n\nThanks guys. Saved me a trip to the neurosurgeon to make sure everything was intact.\n\nSalim Basma, Tamil Nadu India\n\nAt last, I have found company. I used to think I was dumb not being able to find my way out of a doctor's clinic in a hospital when I was able to get in? When I do a lot of turns in driving, I lose my sense of direction; though not totally - thanks to GPS. I have been an outstanding student throughout my student life and excelled in my professional life ,passed a lot of difficult examinations and achieved a lot of successes (modesty aside), so how could I feel and act as stupid in my sense of orientation when I am driving around the small city streets I have lived in for years? If my friends hitched to a party or a co worker to a conference area, and there are changes in routes and planned venues, I am totally embarrassed. However, don't worry guys, I have read somewhere before that this occurs most commonly to smart, gifted and or people with above - average intelligence. However, I just speculate that perhaps we think so much that we may have focused on one side of our brains and other functions may have been used less? This disorientation problem deserves real research. Thank God we are still doing GREAT!\n\nCherie Palmer, California USA\n\nAs most of you have already said: THANK GOD I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE. I feel ashamed and oh so stupid when I get lost or can't remember instructions sequentially. My husband and kids have learned that the only way i can learn is the \"One, two, three\" method. Each part of completing a direction or process (especially on computer) I have to write each step down, even if there are only 4 steps. When I go to a mall, if I don't memorize the department I have to walk through, or the name of the entrance I entered, I get so lost, and it is definitely a feeling of panic. Preparing for a trip and then taking it is painful. Recently I got so lost driving, there was no cell phone reception, just endless towns with no place to stop to get help. I thought I was inside a nightmare. Forget about reversing a trip or finding an unfamiliar place at night. I am so happy to learn that I am not alone and stupid. I worked at a well known newspaper for 30 years and before that I had a professional singing career. But those things don't matter when I am lost and afraid.\n\nPanny King, Rutherford, USA\n\nI honestly did not think that there was anyone in the world with my same problem! I have had this problem since as long as I can remember, I get so embarrassed when I get in the car with someone and they ask me for directions and I do not know them. I cry about it from time to time because I'm 20 years old and I thought that I should know my whereabouts but sometimes they just don't click. I have no idea what it is that I'm focusing on in the car but directions just don't stick! I'm getting better and I have gotten better since I started driving earlier this year but still it's a problem that I've honestly been trying to fix.\n\nNita Sykes, Lakeland, US\n\nJust like me lost everywhere I go. Have to take stock, look for land marks and hope there aren't too many doors in a building. I'm sure to take the wrong one. Some members of my family are the same.\n\nJoan Kay, Galway, Ireland\n\nI'm so so glad I found this site. I have lived in the same small town for almost 7 years and I can never find my way around! I was about to go to pizza hut so I turned on my gps (like always) but I couldnt even make sense of it and I just pulled over and cried really hard for a good ten minutes. I'm an intelligent person and talented in many areas, always A's and B's in school in college- but put me in a car or a big building and I'm done for. I thought I was stupid or something and have always been made fun of for it and it really hurts. There is literally nothing I can do to help with this directional dyslexia and it is mentally and emotionally exhausting. However I am very glad to know I'm not the only one. I hope someone can find a way to help people like us some day. Until then I guess I will have a panic attack every time I'm traveling to a new place or just my hometown pizza hut. Thank you for sharing everyone.\n\nHannah , USA\n\nGlad I came across this site. I have the same problem and it's pretty bad. Although I've never told anyone this, it's one of the main reasons I didn't go to college.I knew I could never find my way around and it would just be too embarrassing. I'm 31 and I still have trouble finding my way around the local mall! and it's a rather small mall. I find I have to try and memorize what stores are next to what instead of just automatically knowing which direction they are in. I live in a small town so I do know my way around here but when it comes to bigger cities I just get disoriented. GPS really doesn't help a lot because I also have trouble judging distances and all the roads just seem to \"jumble up\" in my head. I also have trouble with math as i said before the \"jumbled up\" feeling also applies to numbers. I often wonder if it is somehow connected. I don't ever talk about it because someone without the problem isn't going to understand it or be able to relate. So I'll continue to do my best to try and hide it.\n\nRhonda, Maryland USA\n\nI've always thought there must be a reason why i can't remember directions, when my brother seems to be able to find his way to places we've never been to, and always has been able to. I remember going to a party with him after parking at his friends house, years ago. He'd never been to this house before I should add. We got a lift through the town, after many beers, to a house party. Come 5 the next morning my brother managed to guide us straight back through the town, on foot, after a couple of hours sleep, with a hangover and straight to the car! When I exclaimed 'that's ridiculous, how have you managed that you lucky git?\" he just laughed it off, saying \"What! It just felt like the way to go! We were only across town!!\" That, to me, felt like witch craft, and still does :0) ! I'm currently learning to drive and just failed my test, for the 4th time! I have ABSOLUTELY no problems with the mechanics of driving whatsoever, my first instructor said \"you must be a natural!\" I learned so quickly. It soon became apparent however, that asking me to drive from point A to point B, even without changes in the route, without help was an exercise in futility. It doesn't seem to matter how many times i drive a route, it never seems to cement in my mind, there's always an element of it that feels like the first time I'm seeing it. As soon as I'm in a position where I have to make decisions based on route finding, or using knowledge of my position relative to other things... I realise i don't have that knowledge at my disposal. It's very scary and frustrating and i have all the empathy in the world for you all. I earned myself a 1st in my degree and a Distinction in my MA and so otherwise consider myself to be very capable, like many of you also seem to be. I just can't find my way through the town I live in when I need to in order to pass my driving test. And yeah, i feel like an idiot too, but know I'm not and neither are any of you ;0)) Hang in there all!\n\nPaul, Huntingdon England\n\nI have laughed to the point of crying when reading through the above comments. I am just like all of you! I guess the only difference is that I don't feel much shame about the issue. I always thought it was just a variant of cack-handedness and therefore have been able to pass it off as a character quirk. However, it really does affect my life a lot. First, some facts. I throw with my left hand, write with my right, kick with my left ... so already I am a bit scrambled. I have two postgraduate degrees and was a university division director until very recently. I am in the 99th percentile on tests of verbal ability. However, I have the worst short term memory for placement of objects that I have ever observed in anybody. I just accept it as an awkward and annoying fact that if I put down my keys, I am going to have to spend ten minutes looking for them. When I was 19 and in the Army Reserve, for some insane reason I was made the driver of a huge gun tractor. I'll never forget tearing down the scrim off this huge Unimog and then driving around desperately for 20 minutes trying to find my unit in order to deploy them for a barrage simulation against the US Marines. Eventually one of the other grunts had to chase me in a land rover because I had got about 5km off course. I had absolutely no idea where I was. In coastal Perth, where I grew up, the beach was west and the hills were east, but I constantly got lost. Driving one way was generally OK, but the return trip completely disorientated me. I am still as completely hopeless. I never did learn how to walk from my office to the canteen, and that was after 5 years in the job. I don't think I can fix this. The only thing I can control is my self-esteem. My wife gets annoyed with me because I always stride off confidently, even though I invariably head in the wrong direction. I am a pretty flashy driver - frankly, I scare the hell out of people - but roundabouts utterly defeat me. As someone else said, north is the direction that my nose points. But I have learned to live with this mainly by making a joke out of my complete klutzedness. If I didn't, I would probably not be able to leave the house. Long post, but there are some emerging themes. Many of us have left hand/right hand issues, the majority are clever and seem to have a very good command of language, most appear to be of average to high ability either in sports or in domains where spatial sense is required, and many report having terrible short term memories. The other thing I would like to say is that everyone who has written seems like a \"good\" person. They are empathetic and feel they are burdening others. That's nice that people are sensitive to the effects their disadvantage has on others. I am so happy to have found this post. It's nice to be part of a community. I wish there was some way we could set up a help community. Perhaps a Google group? Would anyone be interested?\n\nEdward Rush, Melbourne Australia\n\nOh my goodness. I was looking up types of dyslexia this morning after talking to my sister yesterday about how I find it difficult to remember or recognise directions and she said I could have a form of dyslexia. After reading your comments I think she may be right!! I get lost so easily and even on journeys that I have been doing for years I am still unsure of the route. I nearly always go in the opposite direction to the one I should go in. Hotels are a nightmare - I always go the wrong way when trying to get to my room and also when going out of my room. Before using a satnav if I had to go somewhere on my own I would have to stop every so often and write down certain land marks and directions so that I could find my way back. I once went to a shopping centre that I didn't know, went in one shop, got totally disorientated, panicked, managed to get back to the multi storey car park and spent what seemed like a life time trying to find my car. It was awful..I have never been to new shopping centres on my own since. I am 46 years old and I feel like a child. My husband loses patience; I will show him this website. Thank you\n\nMelissa Jevon, Walsall UK\n\nI have always been aware of having, or rather believing myself to have, absolutely no sense of direction, but for the first time in my life I'm questioning my self-diagnosis. All of you call your devil by the same name as I, but none have complained of symptoms that are like mine. I have never had a problem navigating in a new city (or an old familiar one), or following a map, or following written route instructions. In fact I'm always surprised when I hear \"Wow, you've been here less than a day and you get around as well as a native\", and the like, because I can't imagine the alternative. If you plopped me down in the middle of Manhattan and told me to take the BQE to get to JFK, I could do it no problem having seen it on a map and having done that trip before etc... But, if you told me to go east, instead of take BQE, I would not know where the heck to start. The one is just common sense, for me, and the other calls for the use of the innate sense of which way lies North enjoyed by the majority, of which I am not a member. Put me in the wilderness, (where there are no street signs etc) and once I've taken the first step in any direction I am utterly flummoxed about from whence I just came, which way am I facing, which way to proceed, am I circling etc. I know up from down, but South from North? How do you do that, outside of reading the environmental clues that might or might not be available from Mother Nature in your hour of need. If I look down and see that I'm no longer on an established trail, I know I better not take another step. And pray someone finds me soon! To me, a poor sense of direction, by definition, is the inability to orient yourself according to the points of the compass, but none of the comments here ( I've read most but not all of these posts) so much as mention N,S,E or W. Perhaps we've both got it right it depending on which side of the Atlantic you claim as home. I know that England is East of me, but I couldn't point your way to its shores. Can you folks, without getting up, point towards the States? Also, I get lost in buildings, but I believe that is because corridors and suites do not have street names and 'addresses' , in other words wore labels like streets and exteriors do. In a large hospital, for example, my husband can always tell me if we're heading toward or away from our destination\n\nBrigid Shore, Yardley, PA United States\n\nI'm holding back tears as I've been reading the comments. It's comforting to hear my story but no less frustrating. I just now went through an episode in what should be a familiar route. I'm a field technician and travel the NYC area. I plan on showing this to my work partner as I'm sure, as patient and understanding as he is, it is \"getting old\" having to tell me: \"make a right, no, your other right\" over and over again.\n\nMaggie, New York\n\nI am also so relieved to know that I am not the only one to suffer from a terrible sense of direction. It really affects my confidence. I worry if someone expects me to give them directions. If I go in a shop, when I come out I always go in the wrong direction or if I go to the toilet in a pub or hotel I have to keep repeating to myself whether to turn left or right when I come out. If in unfamiliar surroundings my head just seems to go all fuzzy and I have no idea which direction I have gone and how to get back. I was hoping there would be some way of improving my sense of direction but from all the other comments it seems not.\n\nSally, Uk\n\nCan't believe no one here has mentioned the possibility of Adult ADD (or ADHD). I was diagnosed in my early 50's as the primarily inattentive \"type\" and when on my ADD meds found my sense of direction and focus much improved. I'll never be a navigator but the meds certainly help.\n\nLin, Cincinnati, oh USA\n\nI have the same problem and also get mad at myself for not focusing, but sometimes I try really hard to memorize and still cannot remember most of my way back. It is frustrating having my seven year old tell me I'm going the wrong way. I wish there was a brain exercise that would help us better our sense of direction or focus. Some times i think it could be ADD or something similar like one of the posts in this page read, but I'm no expert. God Bless, you guys all seem to be very nice people.\n\nElio , Rios West Palm Beach,fl US\n\nI can tell my left hand from my right hand. However, I cannot tell left from right when giving directions or especially when I am driving and someone is giving me directions. Most of my life I have just felt stupid.\n\nMurlene Crowley, Dallas, GA USA\n\nI am so glad it's not just me! I have suffered with this all my life, from getting lost finding classrooms at school, to be unable to give someone directions to drive me home! Friends don't really understand, and think you just don't pay attention, but I've always felt it was a real disability like dyslexia. Because of it, I have never learned to drive as I feel I would never to be able find my way around. It was good to read the comments on this site as I've never actually met anyone else with the same problem!\n\nJune, Lytham, Lancashire\n\nMe too but additionally i have depression also and more. I think it is related to brain accident, so there is no cure but practicing it could be helpful.\n\nAmal, Khartoum, Sudan\n\nAt last I have found people who are the same as me. I am severely dyslexic, it wasn't recognised until I was 40! I always thought I was different to other people. Dyslexia isn't just spelling and reading it is the inability to receive and process messages to the brain. These messages take longer to be processed and take unconventional paths. I get lost every day, lose my car in the under ground car parks, and frequently have to ask directions. I lose my purse at least once a day and have difficulty answering questions directed at me quickly meaning I often hesitate while my brain catches up.\n\nKaty, Loughborough, UK\n\nI am a 26 year old male and I am so bad at directions. And I am SO glad I am not alone... I was just so upset. My situation today: Today I had an appointment at 9:00 am and got lost for a whole 45 min, until I found the place. I kind of knew the general direction at least. I must have taken so many streets and checked them all the way up and down and up and down and so on... Finally, I tried to familiarize myself with certain landmarks but could not find anything. I had a feeling it was on a certain street, and just checked there and took the opposite direction, I did not realize this until I went all the way down this street and took the opposite direction and went all the way down and found the place. In the end I had to reschedule my appointment to another date.\n\nBibekdeep, Urbandale, Iowa United States of America\n\nWow!!! It is a relief to know that I'm not 'stupid' which is how I feel when I ask someone for the direction to the exit and they point behind me and then suddenly, I can see the huge sign saying exit! I once sat on a bus on a winter night for over 2 hours going from one end to the other end of it's route just trying to locate the correct stop...I never use big libraries and like one reader said, I dare not wander off in an unfamiliar area. Familiar means living in the area or have visited it at least 10 times with a companion in the past before I'd venture there by myself. I cant even concentrate on driving lessons so cant drive! I really excel in projects I'm genuinely interested in but fail to be anything but motivated in those of no interest regardless of high financial rewards!\n\nKate, Bristol UK\n\nYes - my directional dyslexia is absolutely the most frustrating aspect of my life, without a doubt!! I even have \"maze\" nightmares! And NO ONE understands - although I've tried, in vain, to explain it to them!!! Family members that have known me all my life just can't seem to get it - they think it's just a matter of focus, or paying better attention!!! I don't even know why I try to explain it to anyone anymore - I may as well be speaking it in Chinese!!! I was even born breech - I backed out of my Mother, for crying out loud!!! People in my family even laugh about my lack of sense of direction - all it does is make me want to cry (as I sometimes do, when I'm hopelessly lost)!!! When I go into a new building, I have to get into the elevator, turn around, & visualize which way I have to turn to get back to my car, & remember what I saw from the parking lot, as a landmark!! And when I'm driving, I rely heavily on landmarks - and the relationship between the landmarks & where I'm trying to go - do it several times in a short period of time (like driving it every day for a week). And all bets are off if I have to do it at night, because it's all new again, & looks totally different. Trying to tell someone how to get there when I'm in the passenger seat is very frustrating, because, in another position in the car, changes everything yet again! And if I'm in the back seat, forget it - I may as well be in a dark cave!!! People try to draw me maps, despite telling them many, many times that I cannot follow them - including my husband of 21 yrs!!!!! I give REALLY good directions to someone else, if I really know the route, because I tell them all the landmarks they'll see at each turn, the name of the streets, the curves in the road, app. how far, etc. etc...Once when my sister met me at a big mall to help her pick out her new glasses, there was construction near where I parked, so I had to, not only look around me to see what was around me, but also turn around when I entered the courtyard at the mall, to see the relationship of where I parked, to where I entered. Well, I made the mistake, despite much argument, of letting my sister talk me into letting her driving me to my car (she was parked on the opposite side), so she could show me something in her car, assuring me that she would get me back to my car. For 45 min. (seemed like 3 hrs.), we tried to find my car---I kept telling her that I was parked by the construction, & exactly what I saw straight ahead from my car, but, because of the construction, she kept driving around it. Needless to say, we were late for lunch at my parents' house, & I was blamed for not being able to find my car!!!! Even at the table with all my family around, I argued with my sister that, if she had just let me walk to my car, & had let me take her to HER car, everything would have been just fine!!!! But, of course, once again, I was to blame, & no one understood that it wasn't my fault!!!! I will NEVER let anyone do that to me again, as long as I live!!! (I ended up in the bathroom, crying my eyes out, in frustration, because no one understands!!!) I've only met 1 other person in my whole life (& I will be 62 next month) that has it as badly as I do--a lady I met at a conference, who lives in Canada....I am so glad (for me, not for you) that I am not alone! I just wish there was more research on this subject! It kills me to hear people say, \"I have a bad sense of direction, too\"---they have NO idea!!! I can't believe I've been able to navigate at all in this world! I thank all of you for sharing--reading your stories gives me some comfort--that I'm not alone--I hope maybe my sharing will help someone else, as well....I wish there were support groups for us, but I really don't think there are enough of us this bad, to do it....\n\nGlenda Callaghan, San Antonio, Texas USA\n\nIts really shame for me, when going for interview etc keeping calling them for direction, in mall which i visit regularly can't find the way, and most unbelievable thing if see a place from different view like if i came north side and was talking south usually then it takes time to recognize the place, so guys is there any remedy for this. Only suggestion from me which helps is keeping remembering landmarks like shop name or anything.\n\nVazabb, Lucknow India\n\nI read somewhere on the Internet that more women suffer from poor directional sense than men do. I'm not so sure that this is backed by research, but I would like to see a study that compares the sexes ability in finding their way around. My directional sense is pathetic! For instance, if locating a certain room in an office building requires two right turns, then a walk down a hall, and a left turn into my doctor's office, I must carefully remind myself that, in order to exit the building, all of these turns must be reversed  a right turn, then down the hall, left, then left again. If I forget to memorize these turns, I will ALWAYS go the opposite way. I will turn Right, Right, Left, just as I did when I entered the building and, of course, I will soon be lost. Not only do I have trouble when I leave a doctors office, I even get lost INSIDE his office. I will leave the examining room and invariably turn down the wrong hall, and maybe even into a closet, or into the doctors private office. Coming out of the closet has an entirely different meaning for people like me! I slink sheepishly out of all kinds of areas, hoping that no one saw me emerge from the coat closet or the employee's private restroom. Any family member knows better than to ask me which way to turn, if they arent sure. They laugh and say \"Tell me which way you THINK that we should turn, and then I'll just go the opposite way.\" I once spent over an hour walking San Antonio's river walk in total frustration, not being able to find my meeting point with other family members. On another occasion, I thought that I was heading into Michigan's Upper Peninsula, when I was actually approaching Chicago. (No, I'm not mentally challenged; like several of you who are equally goofed up, I have a Master's degree. However, I AM severely directionally challenged!) Some of you also have admitted to having a problem with losing things. I do that constantly! I leave things in shopping carts; I once left my wallet containing $1200 on the back of a toilet tank; and I lose my keys nearly every day. My roommate predicted that I would someday be an absent-minded professor, and that prediction wasnt too far from reality. I wonder if our problems stem from a lack of concentration, from thinking ahead to what well be doing next, or from a short circuit in our brains. At any rate, we all know how frustrating life can be under these conditions. Thanks for sharing your stories!\n\nME Hess, Small town USA\n\nI have this problem with direction also. Not only with compass directions, but I was once hiking and trying to get to the bottom of a mountain and ended up going back up to the top and it was a while before I was aware of it. I think the anxiety, stress and frustration this type of thing causes just compounds it. If you get mixed up and the anxiety or frustration kicks in, then it gets even worse and becomes a vicious cycle. I was always wondering if it had anything to do with lacking true depth perception. I was born with \"strabismus\", so I lack binocular vision and therefore have have almost no \"true\" depth perception. Does anybody else with this terrible sense of direction lack depth perception???\n\nmark, guilford U.S\n\nHi all, I am 50 and have had this problem all my life, I never learnt my way round school sometimes getting so lost and late for classes I would just walk home in tears knowing I was going to be in trouble and sometimes even getting lost on the way home. I do drive but tend not to leave my small village. I always find a friend to go any where with I have trouble with reading, righting and with numbers I never did learn my times tables I have absolutely no self confidence and as a result have done very little with my life I know there must be something wrong with me I just feel so stupid, thanks for listening. cheers H\n\nheather, kyle scotland\n\nI am 19 and just got my licence last year. I have been living in Tacoma all my life and still don't know my way around. It usually takes me several times going to a simple place before I can safely remember my way there by myself and even then I still don't remember my way back from there. My dad and his twin brother was diagnosed with dyslexia so I wondered if maybe that has something to do with it. I was told reading improves memory so I've been doing a lot of reading so hopefully it will help with remembering directions.I've also downloaded an app with exercises to help improve brain functions spatial included.\n\nDeAngelina, Tacoma WA\n\nso sorry and glad that others have this issue. I could never understand this problem I have because it doesn't fit with my abilities. getting somewhere without a written set of \"left/right\" directions and a written reverse set I will get nowhere outside my very small town. my little girl has had to tell me which way to turn to get to the dentist in town!! chess/checkers ummm no. N S E W. ummm no. highways NO!! feel spacy and dopy and disoriented. must concentrate Intensely to remember landmarks and still unsure. have made it most places by sheer luck!! thank god my Angels have a better sense of direction then me! walking with a friend around the neighbourhood ... lost. if someone were to drive me somewhere I wasn't familiar with and drop me off I think i would die. clouds in my brain? horrible feeling\n\nMelissa, ontario canada\n\nI cannot believe I ran into this site. My entire life has been a boggled mess when it comes to directions and finding locations without extreme panic attacks. I could never understand why I was stricken with this problem, considering how well rounded I am with most other things in life. I can pick up and play any instrument by ear, remember entire movies after watching them only a couple of times, but when it comes to directions...even in my own neighbborhood, forget it!!! Is there a support group for this and if so, please inform me. I am also left handed, so for a long time I tried to connect that with my problem. I am constantly thinking non stop and am completely inquisitive about things in general. Always looking for answers, emotionally driven in a way that is almost unheard of, but again, my sense of direction is completely ludicrous. Someone please let me know if there are support groups regarding this subject..I need help!!! lol\n\nDawn, Holland Michigan\n\nHow can we get a support group started? Let's try to help each other! Someday something will happen and I will have to find my way around like when my husband had to be rushed to the hospital two hours away and I cold not ride in the ambulance! If it weren't for a good friend I could not have gotten there to be with him! That is so sad. I am in my 60's and have had had this problem since my parents let go of my hand. You just can't understand how it feels.\n\nDorothy G, Lynchburg USA\n\nThank goodness I found this! I find my directional dyslexia very distressing and my nearest and dearest find it incredibly amusing! I can only attribute the feeling of frustration and panic I feel, when I'm lost, to being the same as someone who is loosing their memory. I walked a very familiar route with my dog the other day but because I overshot the turning off to my left I ended up at a junction- one I drive past weekly- I just couldnt work out whether to turn left or right. I'm so glad that this is a condition that is recognised by other people, I have always called it my direction dyslexia to bat off the ridicule dished out when I get lost - I wish there was a proper term for it - I have read an article in which they termed it dysgeographica but can't find much about it.\n\nJohanna Murphy, Newport Isle of Wight England\n\nIt HURTS\n\ndebra ashford, crumlin wales\n\nI get hopelessly lost all the time! I have no concept of cardinal directions. I have to retread old routes over and over, even if they are inefficient, to get where I'm going. It took me nearly a decade to understand the geography of my prior home, Austin, Texas. My sister makes fun of me when I'm driving, and it is so frustrating! People who don't have this problem can't seem to fathom how anyone could be so directionally impaired. Glad I'm not the only one.\n\nHannah, Los Angeles USA\n\nI don't have an answer. How I wish I did. When I go out of a building I always think ...left ....or right? My particular slant on the problem, is the effect this is having upon trying to find work, now I have been made redundant. I have a car and I drive but I can't find new places, it has taken years to establish a set of places that I can drive too, my family call them 'the places on my rail'. I can't drive on motorways because they take you too far in one direction, so what happens when I suddenly get disorientated and don't know where to get off it or if I get on the right motorway in the wrong direction? Also at motorway speed I cannot afford to hesitate, get confused or find out that I am in the wrong lane and miss my intersection. So if it is more than a max of 4 miles away and on my existing 'rail' I can't risk look for work there! Recruitment agents and employment office clerks do not accept my excuses and say things like....\"but its just up the road\"...my spatial sense is also not good so if I get somewhere parking is extremely hard unless I find a space big enough for a bus! After all if I miss a space and need to go around the block again the stress would be debilitating! If I left the car somewhere new I would never find it again anyway! I am on the verge of saying I can't drive. But if its on my 'rail'... Its OK! We all need Star Trek style transporters so Scottie can beam us to our destinations. I lose things too... Glasses in particular...it's costing me a fortune!\n\nJane, Farnborough UK\n\nThank goodness I found this article! I've had this problem ever since I started driving. When I drive my friends around I'm so embarrassed not knowing where to go! And whenever I drive with my Dad to target or publix. I always have to ask him where and when to turn. He can't seem to believe that I have absolutely no clue how to get there! It's taken me at least 40 times going to publix to somewhat remember how to get there. My Dad knows that I struggle with direction. And for my graduation present he got me a gps!! Which I am very thankful for. I thought I was the only one with this problem! I'm so happy to know that there are others out there with this problem as well!! I'm not the only one!!!\n\nIsabella, Destin Florida USA\n\nYou write: I can't answer this but I have the same problem as you. It is beyond a bad sense of direction - and people find it hard to believe that I can be so bad! (especially my husband who is a cartographer and never lost). I always describe it to people as similar to dyslexia but with directions - almost feeling like I am lacking a 'magnetic centre of direction' in the brain - so you could be on to something. In my case, it runs in the family too. Liz, Heath and Reach Liz, My son, who is 37 now, can drive to McDonalds, and when we leave 10 mins. later he's ready to go home in the opposite direction. And when we ARE headed in the right direction he will get in the wrong lane to turn onto the next road going home. This has been happening frequently since we came back to the U.S. from Belize. What caught my eye in your response was the mention of dyslexia. He was diagnosed with it when he was in 1st grade. He still has it but in a milder form. We've both been turned around in The VA Hospital. But I rarely get going in the wrong direction going home from a drive.\n\nJim C, Placencia, Belize\n\nI thought I couldn't remember direction because I never paid attention but not true I've paid attention and that still don't work. I find myself forgetting 20 mins into the trip. I hate when my husband call and ask \"Are you almost home\" I say yes\" then he ask where are you?\" I can't even answer I say anything just not to seem dumb! I had to travel a hour away to see the doctor when I was pregnant the entire 9 mins I finally learned the way there but can't drive to a restaurant of my choice I have to eat at whatever I see in sight. Then can't remember how to get back on the main road to get home! This really sucks, I feel like this condition wont let me live a happy life! :(\n\nnatalie, belzoni, ms us\n\nEver been lost in a one story parking garage??\n\nRainy, Louisville, Ky USA\n\nAt least I am not alone. I am totally hopeless when it comes to directions. I still get lost at my sister's house which is not big at all, as soon as I get to the hallway coming from the bathroom, it is as if I am in a different world. Navigating at my Uni is a nightmare, I cannot remember how to get from the to lecture theatres I have been attending for years to my car. I have been identified as a high achiever straight A student but I always feel so stupid when it comes to directions. It takes me more time to figure out my left from my right than it does to solve a complicated equation.\n\nKira, Christchurch New Zealand\n\nI'm so glad for this discussion. Now done beating myself up for my lack of ability to get around and for my anxiety about going new (and sometimes even old) places! Feeling as though people suffering from Directional Dyslexia need a place to unite and share, I've created a Facebook group: www.facebook.com/groups/513743812001221 If you think it would be useful for you, join up!\n\nAndy Pakula, LONDON United Kingdom\n\nI feel as I'm \"coming out of the closet\"! I'm 67 and for as long as I can remember I've had a terrible sense of direction. In addition my depth perception isn't good, and the two together make it virtually impossible for me to drive safely on an interstate or any road that has \"merges\". It's a total revelation to find out that I'm not alone in this. I knew it wasn't a matter of being stupid (I belong to Mensa), but it sure makes me feel stupid when I can't find my way out of a building or lose my car in a parking lot or have to stop and ask directions to a place I've been to before. I used to laugh it off and tell people \"Turn me around twice and I'll get lost in my living room\", but it's really not funny at all. I recently moved to a new town and it has been agony trying just to get to and from the grocery store, Wal-Mart, etc. What are routine errands to most others are major expeditions for me! The worst part is that my adult daughter fusses at me for \"not paying attention\" when I can't recall directions or find somewhere that I've been to before, even many times. I often draw \"maps\" for myself to help with simple directions. When I look at an actual map, if I want to know whether to turn right or left at an intersection, I have to rotate the map so it's pointing in the same direction I am. All this time I just thought this was just something odd about me and had no idea it was a \"real thing\" that affects others the same way. Just knowing that is helpful!\n\nVennie Anderson, Crestview, FL USA\n\nAfter 40 years of life I am glad I am not alone. Such a relief.\n\nWagner, Kampala Uganda\n\nI don't have an answer but maybe you do, my directional problem seems worse then all the people that wrote on this page, I may be wrong but seems like it so here is my issue, my brain can't tell the difference between north south east or west at times especially at work. I work near the coast off California and the way the waterline goes is from east to west and my brain tells me that I'm going north to south which would put my brain telling me the sun sets in the north and rises in the south. If for some reason my brain starts to wonder and tell me by making my sight look in the correct direction then I instantly go into anxiety and maybe even have a panic attack. any suggestions what things could be going on??\n\nJeremy, Ventura USA\n\nI read through around three fourths of the replies above and had one thing in my head: Me too! Me too! I have faced this problem since childhood in the most familiar surroundings, my own house and in new places. My earliest memory of being lost is, when I moved into a new neighborhood at the age of 6 and in the first week I tried to walk my little cousin back home a few blocks away. I was so thoroughly lost that I was nearly in tears after walking around for half an hour. Surprisingly, my 4 year old cousin was able to walk us back home in a few minutes. From this time on, I was always very cautious when going anywhere. And I always made a note of every instance on which my internal navigation system failed. I did this in the hope of correcting the problem with more focus and attention. But this has not worked at all. I went online today looking for help because of a similar incidence and stumbled upon this page. Today I was driving with my driving instructor and as part of preparing me for all the possibilities in the eventual driving test, my instructor told that we had to go back. Meaning I had to look for an appropriate place to turn into, reverse and head back onto the main road I came from. I reversed the car and then began proceeding to the left instead of proceeding to the right, to the absolute frustration of my instructor. (note: I am 29 years old and recently moved to Germany (left hand driving) from India(right hand driving) and this has opened a whole new can of directional challenges for me.) if I am used to being in a neighborhood only in day time, if I end up there in the night time, I panic. When I started working in a new office, it took me 1 year to finally figure out the routes which a taxi or auto rickshaw would take from the train station to the office building. I find GPS useful at times, but even with this, its not always fine. No one in my family has this problem as far as I know. I really wish there was something that could help us 'directionally'-challenged (a term i made up) people.\n\npreeti, Mumbai, India / rinteln, Germany india/ germany\n\nWell ... it was years ago that I posted this question and I'm amazed to find that so many people have the same problem as me. Like many of the people who have answered my question, I also get lost doing things like coming out of the Ladies' in a restaurant. When I started my current job, I felt sick on my first day because a) I couldn't remember what floor my office was on (even more absurd when you consider that it turned out to be the ground floor...) and b) couldn't find the loos even when I'd been shown twice where they were. I also regularly have to walk from my office to another (famous) building in Manchester city centre and despite having lived here for 10 years, never take the same route twice and struggle, in both directions, each time. I also have a lot of disturbing dreams about getting lost, or suddenly turning a corner and finding that a distant landmark is suddenly right in front of me, alerting me to the fact that I am miles away from where I thought I was. And yes, I know exactly that feeling of panic/dread that comes from having to find my way somewhere. And I also go to great lengths at work to avoid having to go to meetings or other offices alone, in case I get lost. I'm pretty sure this has been noticed, which is embarrassing. It is very hard to explain to people who haven't experienced this, isn't it? I'm glad I'm not the only one, anyway.\n\nJoanne Sheppard, Salford UK\n\nHi everyone first and foremost I am extremely stoked at the fact that their are others with the same disability as me and I no longer have to feel ALONE. Now I know the name of this disability and I no longer have to feel completely stupid like I've felt for Twenty Years in my own hometown like every other obstacle in life I will defeat it! :)\n\nJohn Doe , Wpb,Fl US\n\nWow, I always thought I was a bit of a freak because I have NO sense of direction. I have no idea about North, South, East & West! People talk about 'Northerly aspect' or a 'Northerly wind' & I'm like \"Huh\"??? I am almost 50 & I still have have to look at my hands to know left from right. (I have a freckle on my left thumb!) I rely on GPS which works for me but if I'm in my hometown, for example, and I'm going from A to B but then decide I also want to go to C, I have to think in terms of how to get to C from A & then work it out from there, even though I've lived in Brisbane all my life. When I'm in a building, particularly a new one, I am completely disoriented & need to look outside to see where I am. I avoid using left or right when giving directions by changing it to 'up' or 'down' the street & using landmarks. When I went to the UK on holiday, I used Google maps on my iPhone when I was walking anywhere. Unfortunately this is problematic because not knowing the place when starting out meant that when there was a T intersection & the phone told me to go in a westerly direction, I had no idea, so I just had to start walking & see if I was going towards the dot or away from it -_- I also always stayed above ground so I could see the landmarks. Taking the underground got me hopelessly lost & if I was on the wrong platform it was a nightmare & I'd have to ask for help over & over because I'd keep getting lost. I feel like I don't have a compass at all. BTW I can relate to the person with the fantastic long-term memory. I have the memory of an elephant & remember stuff from my first day in primary school etc. & once something is stored, I never forget it. Finding this page is very reassuring :)\n\nAngela N, Brisbane, Qld, Australia\n\nThis is such a relief. I thought I was unique. I have a very responsible job and manage 2 businesses but rely on my gps to get me to places I have been many times before. I am the butt of my family's jokes and always thought I just had a bad sense of direction. Funny because I too have recently called myself directionally dyslexic. My husband and I travel a lot on tour and every hotel we stay at I get lost or go the wrong way. It's very frustrating. Wish there was a cure\n\nShona, Auckland New Zealand\n\nMy Mother, myself and a Son with this problem having to memorize the directions where ever we resided. When I go into stores I pay attention to what is inside that door so when I leave I know which door to come out not to mention lost in all those walls they have in large dept. stores or rest rooms that have off set walls and doors good grief all I have to do is turn around and I am lost. I guess others are used to me being a lost soul!! I thought it was caused by some disconnection somewhere so glad to know what its called. I used to work at a very large plant and parking was several places people ask can you help me find where I parked my car I certainly was wrong person to ask that question.\n\nMarylou, Seattle USA\n\nWhat a problem, and others have no clue how hard it is. I had to be picked up several years ago and someone there said don't call I will take you home but on way soon asked what's the best road to overpass under Freeway and I had to lie and say don't know as we never go this way when the truth was it was the only way to cross under Freeway in that area driver had a short stem and I have no idea what he was thinking but I couldn't wait to get out of that car.\n\nMarylou, Seattle USA\n\nI am one of you! When I learned to drive, I was less than three miles from my school and there was only two turns I had to make. Left out of my driveway, and left again at the bottom of the hill. I would constantly find myself pinching my left finger, because I had no spatial understanding where my school was. It could have been in the next state. I am no worse and no better now in my late sixties. However, I have found all my life that the condition seems to have a shadow twin in remembering things like phone numbers, lists of things, and many other numeric lists. Good luck to all. It has been and continues to be such a struggle to me that I no longer drive unless necessity spurs me! So I know what you all are going through!\n\nElena, Palm Harbor USA\n\nI Also have It I Have Lived In The Same Street for 20 years if i dont follow the same route every day or miss a turn im lost to the point of panic it is a real dibilitating issue especially socially my son says mum you have been to da da da 20 times remember you cross over da da da he looks at me in the eye as he tells me the directions again as i look at my son with a blank look on my face i got lost at the first da!!!\n\nTania, Pascoe Vale South Australia\n\nThanks god!! feels good to know I am not alone and it has a name. My husband always complains that I am non-observant that's why I don't have any sense of direction. Once I got lost when I took my friends to a pool nearby and have to get a cab to get back home and it was embarrassing to say the least!. I am also terrified when new people come for visit because I feel like I am touring the places with them as everything looks new to me and I am afraid they are going to ask me directions to some place. I am in a field which requires me to be direction conscious and I would have been happy if there is something which we can do to improve it.\n\npreeti , Houston United States\n\nwww.gettinglost.ca\n\nBridget, NJ USA\n\nOh my god.. I thought I was the only special one!! As a child, I always used to go to my mom, who was teacher in same school, and ask her which way to go back home? Right or left? Patiently she used to guide me and the day I avoided asking her, I reached home in the evening!! With my mother worried and hunting for me every where.!! Now I am 50 and still struggling to remember roads and my friend call me a 'geographically challenged' person. I liked the term directional dyslexia as I have mild dyslexia also. Like I will write 'aslo' for 'also,' or 'adn' for 'and'... though this is very very mild. I think science should pay at this serious and at times harmful and dangerous pathology and should come out with a special GPS for special people like us. Please share if anyone gets some helpful information.\n\nKinnari, Muscat Oman\n\nMy huge lack of sense of direction and short term memory are the reasons I was diagnosed with dyslexia. I still excel in academics but stuggle hugely with analogue clocks, left and right, direction and memory. Has anyone got any tips to help with the direction? I have a huge campus at university and it is incredibly difficult/irritating to get around\n\nSophie Phillip, Yorkshire UK\n\nHere are a) some facts about me and b) a strategy that might help. I'm very athletic and can do anything that involves a ball and a racquet/bat. I'm an ace with Maths and statistics. I only see the big picture, very little detail. I can't see road signs, too detailed for me. I'd rather be solving a world problem and analysing something. Also, for what it's worth, I am very successful, regardless of the fact that I would go to a new hotel and turn the wrong way 5 times in a row as I exit the elevator. We are a not so rare breed of people, and we're all awesome in another way! Part B. this is what worked for me. Note, by no stretch is this a cure or intended to be a solution. It is just two tips that actually work for me. First, I married a woman who is like a honing pigeon. My wife can turn 30 times, walk 5 kilometres in a new city, and walk straight home. We have the funniest times together, travelling - as you can imagine. Second tip - this is really cool! I figured out that I ALWAYS turn left when absent minded or lost. Since I am always lost, I always.....you get the picture.... What I do now is, as I walk to a new hotel room, I just say to myself 'turning to my other side' or 'turning to my left'. Somehow my mind then registers, there's actually more than one side one can turn to. I now sometimes get it right :). Next time you turn the wrong way, consider which way you turned. When you're in foreign territory, only remind yourself when to turn to your 'other' way i.e. 'turn thenothernway when coming out of the elevator'. If it sounds like too much work, just ignore it and have a good giggle at yourself when you turn the wrong way.\n\nFogs, Sydney Australia (expat)\n\nThis neurological condition is called Topographical agnosia, see more here: http://about-brains.com/some-people-have-absolutely-no-sense-of-direction-topographical-agnosia/\n\nBrynhildur Jonsdottir, Iceland\n\nHi Everyone, I went through most of the posts and it felt like everyone was telling me my own story via their own experiences. I have the exact same 'condition' and this poor sense of direction is very frustrating. It's all the more frustrating because directions are a part of our daily lives and having a poor sense of the same is, frankly, very embarrassing. I don't travel too much or explore new places for the fear of getting lost. It's very frustrating and confidence sapping. All these years I used to wonder if I was the only one 'suffering' from this. I was ashamed of discussing it even with my friends and family. After going through the posts here, I am kinda glad (in a very strange way though) that I am not the only one and people living in different parts of the world have gone through the same experience. I wish there were some cure for this to root this 'disability' out of our system for good. If someone can help me with this, I will be forever indebted. Warm Regards, Ashish Sood\n\nAshish Sood, Chandigarh India\n\nOk. Now I don't feel so bad. It's pretty normal to have a poor sense of direction! I just passed my driving test & plan to use GPS. Simple repetitive journeys eventually should get easier. Good luck everyone & don't give up!\n\nMaria, Gloucester United Kingdom\n\nI am feeling relieved to know that it is a common scenario to many. I can follow maps perfectly, but when I come to the scene, I am lost - I cannot tell whether I am heading north, south, east, or west.\n\nGrace, Sarawak, Malaysia\n\nHello friends, I am also just like you, I am also with this bad habit of forgetting directions. Recently I have been selected as a central excise inspector in the Tamil Nadu region. I have always been an above-average student. Someone has stated truly in an earlier post that everybody is special in some way, marvelously good at some things and bad in another way.\n\nVipin Singh, Meerut, India\n\nI get directions and a moment later I get them confused. Or someone will give me instructions and I reverse them. When I'm bulding something I have to look at the plans millions of times, and then sometimes then I even get a dimension wrong. I make many mistake this way. It is very frustrating. It sound like I'm not alone.\n\nClark, Brigam Utah\n\nI have always wondered why I had such a bad sense of direction. I constantly get lost in malls, had a major problem navigating the numerous buildings in university and I am completely hopeless with a car. I have accepted this shortcoming but I want you all to know that you should not be upset with this form of spatial dyslexia. I graduated with distinction from Harvard and the London School of Economics. My cousin who attended Cambridge also has the same problem. Just accept the fact that you have intelligence in other areas. Think of it as your mind being wired differently. As long as you are aware, you can make the conscientious decision to mitigate your risk to situations that require spatial intelligence. Personally I would steer away from driving a car without a GPS or navigating large areas without Google maps.\n\nSameer, Vancouver Canada\n\n\"My sense of direction is poor to the point of being ridiculous...\" That's exactly the way I feel about myself. A simply trip to a malls can be a stressful experience for me. Tests show I'm a light-to-mild dyslexic and I think it's related.\n\nNelson, Jacksonville USA\n\nI too have a poor sense of direction. In all other aspects I feel that I am intelligent, able to learn easily, and have worked in a high powered job with responsibilities with no problem. My language skills are also good. It's an interesting condition. My dad had this too. Thank goodness for GPS.\n\nMargaret, Melbourne, Australia\n\nI have this problem too. Reading a map is a nightmare although drawing one doesn't pose any problems. Whenever I need to go to a unfamiliar place, I always go a day before just to familiarize myself with the place and the transportation I have to take. When attending an event, I need to leave the house earlier so that I still have extra time if I ever get lost. And it happens all the time. I have trouble reading analog clocks, especially ones that don't indicate the numbers. Recently I'm getting better but if someone suddenly asks, I panic and I give the wrong time. I'm considered an intelligent person by my family and friends so it's embarrassing when I mess up with simple things like understanding directions and reading clocks. As a child, I struggled with math. I got better through practice but mental solving and financial calculations are still hard for me to do. There's still more that I want to share but I'm glad I'm not alone.\n\nIcarus, Manila, Philippines\n\nWow! I am 66 and never Googled this before. Spent my life feeling absolutely pathetic and \"clingy\" in strange places. I can come out of a loo and get lost. In fact last night I was so busy looking for my friend after coming out of the loo in a restaurant, I tripped up a step and went flying. Please can we have a support group! At present I am \"lost\" in Salzburg.\n\nSara, Melton Mowbray, England\n\nHurrah! There's lot's of us! I can remember passing my driving test in my small home town and my mum saying that now I could drive myself to the shops. I had this overwhelming panic and remember asking: \"But how will I know how to get there?\" I live with my non-existent sense of direction and just think of it as a quirk and allow an extra hour to go anywhere that I haven't been to 100 times before.\n\nEmily, Swindon, UK\n\nMe too! All the same problems like getting lost in the airport and not knowing a route unless I've used it for days, and then forgetting again when I don't use it for a bit. I've lived in a lot of places and have trouble visualizing the places/homes I've lived in. But am really good with words, languages, and even big picture life decisions. And now I know am not alone!\n\nSharkh, California, US\n\nI am so overjoyed to finally hear what other directionally challenged people have to say. I have had so many negative comments about this condition. People really think that you are stupid or lack trying. Now I do not feel alone in this. It can be very frustrating and extremely embarrassing. Thanks for all commentary on this subject. I feel alone 100% better!\n\nTammy S Acker, Fairburn, US\n\nWell, I already knew I wasn't alone and I already knew others besides me have this problem. The thing I didn't know is that we all have pretty much the 'core' problem - we can't seem to navigate from point A to point B without getting lost. Some of us it seems get lost in our own homes? Go figure. I always have just quipped \"I am directionally challenged\". For the most part everyone in my life just 'expects' that I will be late, or rather lost and eventually will show-up. On the other hand there is working and it is embarrassing explaining to your boss of 6 years why you are late because the same turn you take off the Ferry everyday, five days a week for the last six years you missed AGAIN. Anyone that has this problem will know what I am talking about and also will understand that people with this problem usually suffer GREATLY. We scream at ourselves while driving and yes...cry. I cannot count how many times I have to leave for work an hour earlier to allow for the fact I will undoubtedly get lost and need the extra time to turn around and take the other road or turn I missed and try to get to work on time. I agree it is CRAZY. I agree I am smarter than most people. I have heard the same things all of you have heard my entire life; how do I get lost? How can someone so bright not understand a map? Or not understand N,S,E or W? or get lost when driving the same route everyday for 6 years? people just look at me baffled. I do not have an answer. I will say this I have to make an EFFORT - a meticulously well thought-out effort - even to leave my house and drive to a store or shop within a ten mile radius of my home and not get lost going to and from the location. Intelligent? I have always gotten top grades, national honor society, college, businesses, inventing products and mechanical engineering (not a problem for me) I am the girl you want if you have a problem or need to market a product to the public, blah blah blah. However, it seems, if you want to make it home in time for dinner or your child's first little league game you will probably want to steer clear of being with me! I have found over time people are incredulous that I still am totally lost, and they can see in my eyes that I can't explain it nor will I even try (I have given up) it is what it is - and that is simple - Paula gets lost. I am convinced of one thing and that is if everyone is aware of my problems with directions and routes I do not feel the pressures of getting to a certain place by a set certain time weighing on me and more times than not I surprise even myself and arrive at my destination on time! :) (those are considered 'I WIN!' days). I am not sure but it seems I have been this way for so long that I expect to get lost hence I do not even try to make an excuse I just tell the truth \"I am directionally challenged\" I got lost, YES! again. ~PK Collins\n\nPaula, Seattle, WA U.S. United States\n\nI am so glad to finally meet people like me. Thank God for GPS. I don't know how I can get anywhere without it. A friend if mine was trying to give me directions on how to get to a meeting in a building next to the library. She even drew a map. After trying for several minutes to explain to me how to get there, she threw up her arms in frustration and told me did not know how to help me. It took me more than 15 minutes to get to a place that should have taken me one minute. I try very hard not to let a lot of people know I have this condition by giving myself a lot of time to get to places.\n\nDora, Texas USA\n\nI wish I could help you but I was looking to see if anyone else had a similar problem and came upon this site. I have no geographical sense of direction and have given up driving because of the panic caused when I became lost and that was often. I get lost in shopping centres that I visit on a daily basis.It is a crippling part of my life. Good luck if there is a cure or some sort of help out there.\n\nSharon Mundie, New Farm Australia\n\nI walked into a mirror in a bar once, is the worst my problem ever got! And my problem is bad. Just started college and can never fund the loo or exit, so embarrassing. Lobotomised gibbon indeed Tom Baker!\n\nAlex, London UK\n\nThank God I'm not alone in this. The first time I searched for an answer, the word \"apraxia\" came up. When I googled \"no sense of direction\" again, your site came up, but no one mentioned \"apraxia.\" That's ok, I'll accept \"dyspraxia\" as long as I know it's a real problem. Some people think it's either imagined or made up! That kind of thinking makes me very angry. Thanks for helping me to feel better about myself.\n\nRosalie Ann LaGrutta, Richmond, US\n\nI am a University graduate, I have several high level qualifications in IT. I'm artistic, very good with foreign languages, passed my driving test first time. Yet I always get lost. I have a horrible sense of direction especially when driving in similar routes or when they close off my normal route! Today I was on my way to class, I made my way 95% to my destination, but I drove past the place 3 times before I found it! And I've been there before. I even arrived late to an interview, I was very lucky to get the job. I have always been like this. I have to repeat a journey at least 4 times before I know where I'm going. The GPS is handy, but sometimes it has taken me to the completely wrong place. I get very frustrated when these things happen. My brain is slow when it comes to mapping. It's very embarrassing. I just pass it off as a joke, but this really bothers me.\n\nAli, Doncaster United Kingdom\n\nSo glad to know that it is called directional dyslexia. I can learn almost anything in a short amount of time and I have always been creative and have been very good at school/work. But I get very nervous to have people in my car because I am unable to know where I am. It takes me 7 or 8 times to memorize a route and if I am going to a place from a different direction, I get totally lost. I can use a map on my gps pretty well, but I don't have an internal map it seems. It also happens when I am in a large house for the first time, I get confused as to where in the house I am. Glad to know I'm not the only one and that it is termed \"directional dyslexia\".\n\nEmily Valenica, Houston, TX USA\n\nI thought I was the only one. I never thought I was dumb, i know I am really smart, it's just that I can't take or give directions well. I always remember directions backwards. Like a place I have been many times and can visualize, I visualize it backwards. If I am at a big mall, and I walk into a store and come back out, I will walk the way I already came and realize that and turn back the other way. When I think about places I have been, I visualize the place, but it is the wrong direction. I have developed a fear of driving because I worry that if I have to make a turn, even though I know my right and left, I will make the wrong turn anyway. I can also remember the smallest details of things that nobody else does. I am left handed too, so i wonder if that has something to do with the way I process stuff. It is beyond frustrating.\n\nZuri Weeks, Atlanta, US\n\nNo answer. I am just like you other guys. Without my Tom Tom, I wouldn't get anywhere. I always have to ensure the petrol tank is full if I am going somewhere out of my village because I don't know how many miles I will need to travel to get to my destination. I once went for a five mile run in the opposite direction to my normal run and ended up running 15 miles to get home. I couldn't walk the next day! Up until now I and others thought I was stupid. Thanks\n\nSue Hubble, Manningtree, UK\n\nIt has been worthwhile to read all of the accounts of this spatial difficulty. I feel as if I could have written nearly any single one of them from similar experiences, myself. I also find that dancing is very difficult - particularly line dancing. I cannot remember the sequence of steps, and am always moving in the opposite direction. In sports, I was the girl running toward the wrong goal. I've actually chosen not to look for a job in a larger building because I know that I would get lost there for years before feeling confident. I've missed social engagements because I got turned around, and spent another hour, lost on highways, going from my childhood home to my adult home, because of a simple detour. If I stop to buy gasoline on the way to any destination, there is at least a 40% chance that I will get back on the highway again, going in the wrong direction, and won't notice immediately. Worse, I am clueless with maps. I can work out direction on a map, but when I have to translate from the map to my 3-d world, it is all over. To those of you who have avoided universities because you were afraid of getting lost, I am a debate coach and teacher, and am frequently in unfamiliar high schools and hotels. The university had the same issues. Similar hallways and staircases with turns in them are the worst inventions ever. The bottom line is, I appreciate speaking to others with similar issues, but I need help. at 34, this is a major issue in my life. I arrive to every appointment at least an hour early, for fear of getting lost, and I still am sometimes late.\n\nTina Chaffee, hazelwood United States\n\nLot of people are facing this day to day. I have seen my friends coming to my home and saying its east-facing window etc-while i didn't know how they do it without compass or sun beating at them .. one diversion on the road had left me roaming for 3 kms today.. so yes many people have it..but what is the solution to this ? how do we develop that part of the brain.\n\nkhamboj, Chennai india\n\nWow! This is true. I also feel that I am not alone I usually speak to my co-workers in regards of me having issues in getting lost. I recently moved to Up State NY in Middletown with my husband, and I had to learn how to drive. This was like pulling teeth because I have no sense of directions and to make it worse the person who I am close to is the one who would criticize me. I felt hurt. In addition my Mother and brothers live in the city and they would love to see me but, I don't visit them because I am afraid to get lost and I only drive in the back roads. This stresses me out because I feel like I limit myself from drawing near to my loved ones because of this fear. I will continue to pray for strength. Thank you all for posting your stories it has been a blessing.\n\nClaribel Maysonet, Middletown Orange County\n\nI knew this had to be a thing more people suffered with. And although I feel sorry for people who have this problem, I am relieved to know I am not alone. I have struggled with this all of my life. Some situations are comical (like turning the wrong way out of a room), and some are terrifying and debilitating. Today I had a job interview at a place I had never been, and it was on the most popular street, Michigan Avenue in Chicago. I used a gps, and still got lost. I got so hopelessly and helplessly lost, even though I was in the neighborhood. I was so late, and got so worked up, and all of this caused me a great deal of anxiety. I had a panic attack and had to reschedule the interview. It is embarrassing and unacceptable. Once I returned home after completely blowing my interview, I spent the rest of the day in bed beating myself up for this. Other people (friends, family) find it funny/strange/cute, but don't understand that it's a real issue that can't be controlled. It's awful, and impacts my life in major ways.\n\nEliza, Chicago USA\n\nLike many here, I have this and thought I was a minority. I find it very restrictive and large cause of anxiety. A label would help. I don't know why. But it would!\n\nLeah, Bedfordshire Uk\n\nI am nearly crying with relief to know that my 'secret' which I have spent huge amounts of energy trying to fix is shared by others. I have a very loving and patient husband who helps me do 'trial runs' to new places so I can get a feel for where I am going. My nightmare job would be a taxi driver. I have also got lost in our local shopping complex which I have shopped at since a teenager. To make matters worse they are now extending and changing all the parking. I look for the grace everyday. Hyacinth, Brisbane, Aus\n\nHyacinth, Brisbane Australia\n\nThis is my problem as well, but with navigation on the phone and car, I can survive. It used to be that when my husband years ago tried to get me to navigate using a paper map, I was fine going north, but when going south, I had to turn the map upside down, which made reading the place names and exits and giving him directions a little problematic at 65 mph. Even when I turned it around, I could not tell him quickly whether to turn left or right. He got used to asking me which way to turn on occasions, then deliberately going the other way; he was invariably correct.\n\nSally, Columbia, Maryland USA\n\nToday I finally have this urge to do some searching on internet and see what I may find about my situation. Thanks for all your sharing. I recently got married and moved to Hawaii living with my husband. My husband was 'amazed' how many times he had to take me to the nearby Safeway before I could drive and find my own way there (literally, only 5 mins of driving). I told him I am not kidding and I simply do not know why "
