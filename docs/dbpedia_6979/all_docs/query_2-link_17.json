        "text": "1. Narrative in Comedy films\n\n2. 1) Eccentric Characters 2) Love Interests 3) Attractive Females 4) Unattractive Females 5) Attractive Males 6) Unattractive Males 7) Revealing Outfits 8) Colourful Outfits 9) Crazy Outfits 10) Wise Characters\n\n3. 11) Popular Characters 12) Unpopular Characters 13) Sex 14) Drugs 15) Random settings 16) Meaningful settings 17) Ridiculous scenario’s 18) Violence 19) Weapons 20) Money\n\n4. 21) Music 22) Swearing 23) Nudist scenes 24) Physical issues 25) Domestic characters\n\n5. Two Key approaches • The Classical Hollywood Structure – Order – chaos – order restored – Equilibrium – disequilibrium – new equilibrium – The Three Act Structure • Comedian led narrative - Showcase of individual gags, personal quirks and set pieces loose held together by a ‘plot’ – The Three Stooges – Charlie Chaplin – Monty Python\n\n6. What is the narrative of Love Actually • The film begins with a voiceover from David (Hugh Grant) commenting that whenever he gets gloomy with the state of the world he thinks about the arrivals terminal at Heathrow Airport, and the pure uncomplicated love felt as friends and families welcome their arriving loved ones. David's voiceover also relates that all the messages left by the people who died on the 9/11 planes were messages of love and not hate. The film then tells the 'love stories' of many people:\n\n7. What is the narrative of Four Lions • In groups mark out the plot using the Three Act Structure\n\n8. Four Lions and Love Actually • Are mostly the classic Hollywood style but they both do include element of gags and they do play with conventions • Single goal oriented protagonist • Narrative is driven by character traits\n\n9. Four Lions and Love Actually • Cause and Effect • Use of subplots • The Happy ending"
