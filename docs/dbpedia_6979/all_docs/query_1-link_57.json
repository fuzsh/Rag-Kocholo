        "text": "You can view a QuickTime movie file synchronously with your project, making film and TV scoring quick and easy. Although you can’t record or edit video directly in Logic Pro for Mac, you can replace the soundtrack of a video file with music, Foley, and dialogue arranged in your project.\n\nYou can open a QuickTime movie in a separate Movie window and display single frames of the movie in the global Movie track.\n\nWhen a movie is opened in a project, the upper part of the inspector shows a closed Movie area, which can be opened by clicking the disclosure arrow.\n\nMovie playback follows the playhead position, and vice versa, in the Movie inspector area and in the Movie window. Audio playback for the movie is only audible if either the Movie inspector area or Movie window is open.\n\nNote: You will need a fast processor to ensure smooth movie playback. If you want to record and edit your own QuickTime movie from a video recorder or digital camera, you may need specialized hardware."
