        "text": "Allusion is when an author references something external to his or her work in a passing manner. For example, an author may reference a musical artist or song, a great thinker or philosopher, the author or title of a different text, or a major historical event. Allusions are a type of poetic device. Another form of the word allusion is allude. To allude is to refer to something without explaining it, to hint at it.\n\nAllusion\n\nAllusions can be problematic. Since they are not explained, allusions depend on the reader knowing whatever external thing to which the author is alluding. For example, T. S. Eliot wrote a poem called “The Waste Land,” which is widely considered by scholars and academics to be one of the most important poems of the 20th century. Yet, “The Waste Land” is so densely packed with allusions that most casual readers find it to be impenetrable. That is to say, most readers don’t get it. This is the risk that writers take when using allusions. Allusions are a type of poetic device that depend on the reader possessing background knowledge on a thing that is not further explained. You should use them with caution for this reason. Still confused? Let’s go over an example before I launch into the list:\n\nWe heard a kind of war-whoop, such as David might have emitted when he knocked out the champion Goliath.\n\nIn this line (taken from O. Henry’s short story, “The Ransom of Red Chief“) the speaker alludes to the biblical figures of David and Goliath. In the context of “The Ransom of Red Chief,” this line is written as a smaller character delivers a punishing blow to a much larger character. This parallels how David dispatched Goliath in the story from the Bible, which make it an allusion to the Bible. But, if you are unfamiliar with this particular biblical story, then the allusion will be lost on you.\n\n50 Examples of Allusion\n\nMy Mom has a Spartan workout routine.\n\nKeith was speeding down the empty road in his Mustang and listening to “Smells Like Teen Spirit” on the radio.\n\nThis was our Declaration of Independence and if Mom didn’t let us go to that concert, she would be our King George III.\n\nSome people are calling me the Tiger Woods of miniature golf.\n\nDon’t go thinking you’re Robin Hood just cause you took an extra peppermint from the candy jar.\n\nYou don’t have to be Albert Einstein to understand poetry.\n\nShe thinks that she loves me, and Christopher Columbus thought he was in India.\n\nDon’t wear an Abraham Lincoln hat on your first date.\n\nWe do serious work in my classroom.
