Burnett (screenplay, novel)\n\nCinematographer: Tony Gaudio\n\nEditor: Jack Killifer\n\nMusic: Adolph Deutsch\n\nCostumes: Milo Anderson\n\nProducer: Hal B. Wallis (Executive Producer), Mark Hellinger (Associate Producer) for Warner Bros.\n\nRelease Date: January 21, 1941 (premiere)\n\nThis film is actually earlier than the first in my #noirsummer, having been filmed in 1940. John Huston is credited with the screenplay here, and it shows. Huston was adept at spotting good writing and making the most of it on the big screen. Walsh does a steady job of directing, particularly with a lot of on location shooting.\n\nIda commands the screen. Bogie is understated, playing his usual strengths. Ida plays this incredibly naturally. Bogie coming off a little stiff in one on scenes. Bogie falling for Leslie is frankly slightly disturbing. Not because of the age difference but the sheer maturity difference in their characters.\n\nOf note is when they first go look at the stars, bogies hand lands of Leslie‚Äôs and slowly shifts off only to be blatantly hold it a bit later. The latter is an obvious but if direction and the former an error played through. Odd use of shadows of blinds during bogie skin doctor to fix Leslie‚Äôs foot. Mood not fitting scene. I want Ida‚Äôs pjs when she‚Äôs looking in on bogies nightmare (beautiful shot too with her line in the drapes) Well that proposal, rejection and subsequent reaction was all sorts of overdramatizing from Leslie. And all sorts of awkward for me. Never even mind bogie who looked like a kicked puppy. Am I seeing that dogs ribs through its back while its scratching at the door?! The bellboy during the robbery kinda made the movie for me. Oh Ida. It hurts to watch you throw yourself at a man like that. Of note: at this point I really want both Ida and bogie to get the money and live happily ever after (not together). Who just pokes a dead body like that?! Well isn‚Äôt Velma a little bitch now that her foot‚Äôs all fixed.\n\nIt sure is easy to be wrong in this world ‚Äì Roy Earle\n\nOh, just heartbreaking. üò≠ Car chase sequence gave me motion sickness No Ida! Don‚Äôt go back! Don‚Äôt be that girl! Out of cigarettes? We must be near the end. Curtains, for sure. I cried. Blame the dog.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nI Married an Angel (1942)\n\n‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚ú∞‚ú∞\n\nStarring: Jeanette MacDonald, Nelson Eddy, Edward Everett Horton\n\nDirector: W.S. Van Dyke, Roy Del Ruth (uncredited)\n\nScreenplay: Anita Loos,Richard Rogers and Lorenz Hart (musical), Johann von V√°s√°ry (play)\n\nCinematographer: Ray June\n\nEditor: Conrad A. Nervig\n\nProducer: Hunt Stromberg for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n\nRelease Date: July 9, 1942\n\nThis is so hokey, I fell in love. Well, with the wishy washy story and the absolute adoration between Eddy and MacDonald. I did not fall in love with the score. In fact, I scrubbed through most of the Act 2 songs (well, act 2 in the stage musical version).\n\nReasons worth watching: Getting to watch Eddy squirm around on the couch each time we cut to him, which for the first little bit is a lot. This film definitely has a heavy hand in screwball comedy. It also has a heavy hand in operetta. MacDonald shows everyone how grand her range is. Well, at least in her higher register.\n\nEddy and MacDonald spend a good time of the film beaming like a pair of blustering (Eddy) and angelic (MacDonald) love birds. These are the times where the film flies, and you find yourself smiling along and giggling at the ridiculousness of it all.\n\nAt one point I believe I related that parts of this film were sickly sweet. Special mention goes to Eddy for keeping his arm around MacDonald while she ‚Äúeffortlessly‚Äù slides down a long curved banister. Hint: it did not look that effortless.\n\nWhen there isn‚Äôt beaming, the film loses some of its luster. The second act (latter half of the film) takes a turn that sullied my enjoyment. Some of the songs are downright horrid; one particular standout of the wrong variety is ‚ÄúA Twinkle in Your Eye‚Äù which not only has MacDonald singing weakly in a much lower register but Binnie Barnes breath speaking/singing. It looks just as uncomfortable as it sounds on screen, and not even Barnes dancing can save it.\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be frightened, I‚Äôm an angel.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs what they all say‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Brigitta and Willie upon first meeting\n\n‚ÄúParis can dress anyone, and in vegetarian materials IF necessary!‚Äù\n\n‚Äì the Paris entourage assigned to dress Brigitte\n\nAll around this was a gay film but be warned: I may just be in a sentimental mood as I‚Äôm still reading about their love affair. Also, I had the pleasure of being able to scrub through several sections of the film. The New York Times noted this film ‚ÄúA more painful and clumsy desecration of a lovely fiction has not been perpetrated in years.‚Äù\n\nThis was Eddy and MacDonald‚Äôs last film together, and during filming Nelson was quoted as saying ‚ÄúThis is either going to be the best film we‚Äôve ever made or the worst.‚Äù (worse than Bitter Sweet? Not in my books). The Lorenz Hart site makes note that\n\nFor about twenty minutes, Angel promises to be the most entrancing MacDonald-Eddy film ever made‚Ä¶ Then the censors get out their shears, leaving an incoherent shambles, but one that still yields occasional moments of delight.\n\nMaybe this is so, but I can bet you I‚Äôll never see the original stage play and have the chance to make my own opinion ‚Äì if only this has been made in the pre-code years!\n\nSun, fun and some of the best swimmers you‚Äôve ever seen hit the big screen!\n\nThe 1940‚Äôs was an incredibly fun time for those hitting the beach ‚Äì a fashion icon was born with MGM signing Esther Williams to star in several swimming-themed big budget films and Williams‚Äô style of suits predominate the 40s and live on strongly even today ‚Äì and, of course, the bikini was introduced.\n\nIt‚Äôs said that the bikini was such a startling fad that the designer (Louis Reard) was forced to hire an exotic dancer to model it, because the fashion models of the time refused to be seen in such indecent attire.\n\nThe beginning of the decade was a hit of colour and fun; two piece suits were all the rage. Colour would give way during war time to camouflage colours. Cotton, sharkskin and rayon would replace silk, wool and linen at this time as well. By the end of the war, synthetic fibers replaced natural fabrics.\n\nEarly popular two pieces included the ‚ÄúTaboo‚Äù model which featured a diaper-like trunks. The female silhouette inspired the suits stronger throughout the 40s, with the pinnacle being the rise of the bikini, first featured in 1946. Christian Dior debuted bathing wardrobes in 1947, thus allowing a woman to have a complete ensemble to any activity. Cover-ups were also prevalent in the forties ‚Äì a popular option being a matching bolero jacket, or beach dress.\n\nNext week we conclude our splash of summer fun with Bathing Suits by the Decade: 1950s!"
