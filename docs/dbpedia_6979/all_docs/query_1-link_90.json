        "text": "Hollywood is known for mainly producing films that have nothing to do with faith in Jesus Christ, but quite a few films have been made that glorify our Savior and the Bible.\n\nHere is a list of 10 Bible movies based on scripture. These are in no particular order.\n\nJoseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat (1999)\n\nThis movie is based on Genesis chapters 37 – 50. It is an excellent depiction of the story of Joseph, as his brothers, full of jealousy, throw him into a pit, bring his coat of many colors back to Jacob, and proclaim his fake death. It shows Joseph’s rise to power in Egypt as he becomes 2nd in command of the entire nation and eventually the reunion of Joseph with his family. This is a beautiful, accurate production worth seeing for sure.\n\n\"Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his sons, because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a robe of many colors.\" (Genesis 37:3)\n\nAmazing Love: The Story of Hosea (2012)\n\nThis movie does a great job of telling the story of Hosea and how he obeys God by staying with his wife, Gomer, even though she commits infidelity against him. The story is told by Sean Astin to a group of campers he is with to show them what unconditional love looks like and how that love can be attributed to God’s love for his children. Erin Bethea (Fireproof) also stars in this movie.\n\n\"And the Lord said to me, “Go again, love a woman who is loved by another man and is an adulteress, even as the Lord loves the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love cakes of raisins.” (Hosea 3:1)\n\nLeft Behind (2000)\n\nThis is an excellent depiction of the rapture found in the book of Revelation. It stars very well-known Kirk Cameron (also in Fireproof) as he plays the role of Buck Williams, who has been left behind after the rapture. It involves many characters searching for answers through all the chaos and anarchy around them.\n\nApostle Peter and the Last Supper (2012)\n\nThis fantastic movie showcases Peter as an old man in jail. While in his last days, Peter witnesses some of the jailers. Throughout the movie, he tells the story of Jesus and His redemptive love for us all. It is filled with quoted scriptures from the Bible, such as, “I am the Way and the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.” (John 14:6) This is a must-see film. It is incredibly accurate in all of the passages from the Bible that are acted out. Before the Dove Awards in 2012, the people at Dove said, “We are pleased to say it will receive five Doves from us, and it has earned every single one!”\n\n\"Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up. “Quick, get up!” he said, and the chains fell off Peter’s wrists.\" (Acts 12:7)\n\nThe Ten Commandments (1956)\n\nThis epic, memorable movie features Charlton Heston in one of his best performances. It is pretty accurate with the Bible and covers everything from Moses’ journey in a basket down the Nile River to the exodus from Egypt. It covers the ten plagues Egypt suffered, including a scene with the Angel of Death passing over the nation. It received five dove awards, which is the highest possible. Find more information about this classic Bible movie.\n\n\"Then Moses turned to the Lord and said, “O Lord, why have you done evil to this people? Why did you ever send me?\" (Exodus 5:22)\n\nThe Nativity Story (2006)\n\nThis is a Biblically accurate movie depicting the events that led up to the birth of our Savior. It stars Keisha Castle-Hughes as Mary. She does a beautiful job in this role. She is kind and tender-hearted. Oscar Isaac stars in the lead role as Joseph and does a great job. There is a funny moment where on-lookers are debating who the daddy is of Mary’s baby while they are getting ready to depart. Joseph says, “They will miss us!” The comedy is subtle and well-placed. It doesn’t deter from the meaning of the movie at all. It is a must-see film.\n\n\"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.\" (John 1:14)\n\nThe Book of Ruth: Journey of Faith (2009)\n\nThis movie does a great job of telling an accurate account of the story of Ruth. You see the love she has for Naomi and vise-versa in this film. It takes you all the way from the death of Naomi’s husband and two sons and Moab's departure to Ruth and Boaz's marriage. It is a film that the family can enjoy together for sure. Watch The Book of Ruth on Christian Cinema.\n\nThe Story of David: From Shepherd to King of Israel (2008)\n\nThis is an accurate account of the life of David. It covers many memorable scenes of his life, including the defeat of Goliath, his friendship with Jonathon, and the adulteress affair with Bathsheba. As king, you see his struggle against his own son, Absalom, and eventually the passing on of the crown to Solomon. It is a great film, but I don’t recommend it for younger children.\n\nDamascus (2010)\n\nThis film shows you the life of Saul before he became Paul. It shows you his conversion from a man of violence to a man of humility and obedience to God. They filmed this in the actual locations of the Biblical accounts, which makes this film very intriguing. This is worth watching as it is an excellent depiction of the Biblical account.\n\nThe Passion of the Christ (2004)\n\nThis movie must be on every single list of must-see Christian movies. The most accurate depiction of the events leading up to the crucifixion is available. You see how Christ was humiliated and tortured in this film. It has two memorable scenes: the scourging scene where he is ripped apart by the whips and the crucifixion scene as he hung on the cross. This movie should bring every believer to tears. Praise be to Jesus that He loved us so much that he died for the sins of humanity!\n\nBible Movie Conclusion\n\nThese are ten films worth seeing! They all are Biblically accurate films. They all depict the Bible truthfully and with great performances from the actors/actresses. Have you watched any of these films? Would you recommend some others? God bless!"
