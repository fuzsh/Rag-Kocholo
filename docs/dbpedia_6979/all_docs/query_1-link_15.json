        "text": "Hall Specifications\n\nYou will have the opportunity to complete an inspection of your room when you move in.\n\nAll students with housing assignments can access the electronic Room Condition Form (RCF) through MyMadison under the Student Center section. It will be used as a tool to measure the condition of the room when you move out.\n\nExamining the RCF when you check in and confirming the condition of the room will help you avoid unwarranted damage charges at the end of the year.\n\nIf there are damages in your room and they are not noted on the check-in RCF, you could be held financially responsible for repairs after check out.\n\nMattresses in our residence halls are twin extra-long (36\" x 80\").\n\nStudents have the option to order from Residence Hall Linens.\n\nBed types are subject to change at any time for any reason.\n\nBed types by hall\n\nBed Type\n\nArea and Hall\n\nAll Residence Halls have the chair pictured below; The Southwest Rolling Black Chair\n\nChair types are subject to change at any time for any reason.\n\nA loft bed is any temporary structure or device that is intended to elevate a single sleeping surface from floor level so that it creates additional floor space in a room. We recommend a safety rail on highly lofted beds.\n\nRequests for safety rails must come from the student from their JMU student email account.\n\nIf residents are bringing their own loft bed or constructing one, the structure must comply with the guidelines specified in the loft Hall Policy.\n\nPlease be aware that storage is not available for bed pieces that are not used.\n\nAll residence halls have tiled floors with the exception of Harper Allen-Lee Hall, Spotswood Hall and the Apartments on Grace (they have carpeted floors). Students may want to bring an area rug for their floor.\n\nSpecifics Items\n\nJMU has partnered with MicroFridge to offer Microfridge rentals. The unit that we are offering is a fridge/freezer/microwave combo with a safety plug and smoke sensor.\n\nSee unit specifications here.\n\nThe yearly rental fee is $209.99 + tax (5.3%) and processing fees (4.5% of total)\n\nReturns and refunds are allowed as well as waiting until after moving in to place your order.\n\nOrder by August 1, 2024, to ensure your unit is delivered before move-in.\n\nWatch this video for more information on the MicroFridge unit\n\nOnly ONE MicroFridge is allowed per room - you may have an additional mini-fridge.\n\nIf you choose not to use MicroFridge, you may have one mini refrigerator (up to 5 cubic feet) per resident.\n\nMini refrigerators are also available through the MicroFridge company ($179.00 rental) if your room/roommate has already rented your ONE MicroFridge OR you would only like mini-refrigerators.\n\nIf you are in a Village Residence Hall, you may have one MicroFridge in your room as well as one in your suite, but still no more than 2 in the same room.\n\nThis is the only MicroFridge allowed in JMU Residence Halls.\n\nNo microwaves are allowed in JMU residence halls other than MicroFridge - there is a community kitchen in every hall with a microwave.\n\n*Please note that this unit stands at 45.55in./115.69cm.\n\nOur Residence Halls have two bed types.\n\nIf you have the Adjustable Loft bed, you will have to loft* your bed to almost the highest amount to fit the MicroFridge under your bed.\n\n*When lofting your bed to higher heights, we recommend using a safety rail to prevent the risk of serious injury (not provided by the university).\n\nIf you have the Bunkable/Adjustable height bed, the bed will not allow Microfridge to fit underneath and will need to go somewhere else in the room.\n\nAny appliance with a heavy electrical draw, such as a refrigerator, hair dryer, or an iron, must be plugged directly into a wall outlet, rather than a circuit-protected power strip. All power strips must be UL-approved, circuit-protected, and have a reset button. Power strips must be plugged directly into a wall outlet. Plugging a power strip into another power strip is prohibited. Power strips must lie flat on the ground, or be secured to a flat surface so that no stress is placed on the power cords. Extension cords of any kind are strictly prohibited, including appliances with built-in electrical outlets, such as lamps, bed risers, etc.\n\nAll appliances should be covered under a homeowner's/renter's insurance policy. Students are responsible for renting or buying their own refrigerators. If you bring your own mini refrigerator from home, you will be responsible for unloading it from your vehicle and into your room. Due to liability reasons, move-in volunteers will not be able to assist with unloading refrigerators.\n\nMicrowaves are not permitted in the residence halls. To have a microwave in your room, you may rent a MicroFridge. All Residence Halls have a community kitchen in which a minimum of one microwave is available for resident use.\n\nAirfryers of any kind are not permitted, except for in the Apartment on Grace.\n\nIf you choose to loft your bed we strongly recommend bringing and utilizing safety rails for your bed.\n\nIf you are lofting your bed with a loft kit/custom build, please make sure you are meeting our Loft Policies.\n\nJames Madison University Order Pickup Information:\n\nOrders placed by 8/18/24 will be available for pickup on campus during move-in.\n\nDates:\n\nFriday, August 16 & Saturday, August 17, 2024 from 8:00 a.m. – 5:00 p.m.\n\nSunday, August 18 from 10:00 a.m. – 4:00 p.m.\n\nLocation:\n\nD3 Parking Lot at 591 Soccer Field Service Dr.\n\nTechnology & Insurance\n\nInternet service is available in all residence halls through MyResNet. Once residents have their room assignment, they should register for a MyResNet account at jmu.apogee.us . This should be completed prior to arrival on campus so residents have access to the network the day they arrive. Be sure to register all devices (computer/laptop/iPhone/iPad etc….)\n\nBoth wireless and wired internet access are available. There is one Ethernet port per resident in their room. If residents prefer to connect their computers to a wall-mounted Ethernet port, they should bring a network cable.\n\nResidents should not bring wireless routers/hubs/servers etc. for use in the residence halls as these items are prohibited.\n\nResidence halls have a cable TV connection in each student room and in the hall lounge. Students must bring a coaxial cable. Our halls also have Stream2, allowing students to stream TV shows, movies, and sports from their phones, laptops, and other Wi-Fi-connected devices.\n\nSee the instructions to set up your Stream2 Account.\n\nTelevisions are not to be mounted on any walls or university furniture.\n\nFor more in-depth information on how to set up your internet and/or tv cable or streaming, visit our Internet & TV page to create your MyResNet account. Be sure to do this before your move-in day in August!\n\nA Note about Printers: Wireless printing on a large wireless network is much different than wireless printing from a home network. At home you might have ten total devices, one of which is a printer, therefore the printer is easy to identify, not to mention your network at home is usually secure and only accessible to you and your immediate family. At JMU there are thousands of devices on the network and a couple hundred of them could be printers. With the increased volume of printers, it makes it much harder to identify which printer is the right one to use. Another issue we face with wireless printers has to do with our network being open. On an open network, other people can see the printer devices, which means any student can print to any printer regardless of content or time of day. Also, our network is looking for an IP address, and based on the DHCP lease the IP address can change making it that much more difficult to locate the right device associated with a particular IP address.\n\nA Note about Appliances/Electronics:\n\nAppliances, coffee pots with automatic shut-off, desk lamps, radios, stereos, cable-ready televisions, UL-approved hot pots, and BluRay/DVD players are all fine to bring with you but coordinate with your roommate first so you won't have two of everything. All appliances not plugged directly into a wall receptacle must be plugged directly into a surge protector with circuit protection. For more information on appliances, visit our Hall Policies page. Any items not listed are up to the discretion of Residence Life.\n\nSurge protectors without reset/on or off switches are not permitted.\n\nThese can come in all kinds of configurations.\n\nExamples: Cube adapter, which looks more like a square with 6 plugs usually, but no on/off switch, a smaller looking power strip with 3 plugs and USB ports, but no on/off switch.\n\nOnly circuit-protected surge protectors are permitted.\n\nCircuit protection: it needs to have a reset/on-off switch.\n\n“Reset” is another word for “on”, reset meaning the surge protector is reset/on and functioning normally with the electrical load plugged into it.\n\nIf the electrical load becomes too much, then the surge protector will switch to the off position and at that point needs to be turned back to the reset/on position.\n\nAny kind of device with a USB-only plugin with charging capability is permitted, per the state fire marshal. Examples: lamps, alarm clocks\n\nHowever, if there is an electrical outlet embedded within these types of items then it is not permitted. Example: bed risers.\n\nThe university cannot be held accountable for the loss, damage, or theft of any student's personal property. All students are encouraged to carry their own insurance coverage. Your family's homeowner or tenant insurance may provide coverage or you can arrange for personal property insurance through a private agency.

Until then, to maximize air flow in your room, both you and your roommate can bring a fan and also follow the following:\n\nPlace a box fan in your window with the fans facing outwards. This will pull the hot air out of your room, leaving cooler air inside! Have another fan in your room to circulate the cooler air in your room.\n\nAir conditioning window units and personal air coolers are prohibited. All suites and common areas in The Village, Eagle Hall, and Shorts Hall have an a/c unit.\n\nAlso, be sure to check our HVAC page to learn about your hall's specific HVAC system and how to properly use it.\n\nOther ways to beat the heat:\n\nHang out in your hall’s TV Lounge!
