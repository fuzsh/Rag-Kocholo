        "text": "1This book is based upon Grégoire Halbout’s dissertation on Screwball Comedy which was published in France in 2013 (Artois Presses Université). It was translated into English by Aliza Krefetz.\n\n2An ephemeral genre which ranged from 1934 (It Happened One Night, Frank Capra) to 1945 (She Wouldn’t Say Yes, Alexander Hall), screwball comedy was nevertheless immensely successful, hence evidencing how a “‘cinematic formula’ found a receptive audience” (3). Grégoire Halbout’s purpose is an all-encompassing scrutiny of the genre, whose many tensions might express a vital yet ambiguous American concept – “the pursuit of happiness”, which is embedded in democratic ideals albeit very often equated with individual success. While acknowledging indebtedness to Stanley Cavell’s Pursuits of Happiness: The Hollywood Comedy of Remarriage (1981), a seminal collection of articles on classic comedy, Halbout considerably enlarges the scope of his analysis. He focuses on an impressive corpus of 136 movies (some with flimsier affiliation to the genre than others), 40 of which are discussed and analyzed in detail. His ambition is to examine the structure, narrative tropes and idiosyncrasies of the genre but also how historical, social and institutional context helped shaping it. Borrowing from Rick Altman’s Film/Genre (1999), Halbout envisions screwball comedy as a social construct, a product negotiated and discussed by different groups whose interests greatly differ – be they creators, producers, viewers or censors – and change throughout the course of time.\n\n3The book is divided into three parts. Part one, “The Screwball Expression: A Genre Shows its Credentials” focuses on the elements which defined the genre. Chapter one delineates the sources and influences which led to the birth of the screwball. In 1934 – that is the very year the PCA was implemented – three comedies were released which formed the gist of the screwball. It Happened One Night (Frank Capra), Twentieth Century (Howard Hawks) and The Thin Man (W.S. Van Dyke) were irreverent movies which made fun of the wealthy, parodied generic conventions, displayed frantic rhythms, narrative twists, and wordplays. A polysemic and ambiguous term, “screwball” aptly defined the genre, where novelty and tradition collided. The thirties were characterized by turmoil (the Great Depression) and hope (the New Deal). Hollywood reflected such ambivalence. A fresh generation of screenwriters were hired, who addressed contemporary concerns and the American loss of ideals in the public as well as in the private sphere. The working class were granted a voice and openly criticized the idle elite. Positive discourse was however maintained through the fairy-tale-like ending of the plots which very often promoted social reconciliation.\n\n4Chapter two circumscribes the men and women who established the genre. Paramount, Columbia and RKO produced the most comedies in the thirties, and those studios relied on the directors’ autonomy. Actual “Jack of all trades” (46), the screwball directors learned their craft occupying varied positions in the silent era and most were familiar with technical, writing or even acting constraints on set. Their versatility accounted for the genre’s formula and its many variations. Similarly, the iconic actors and actresses of the screwball combined physical prowess with minute facial expressions and comedic rhythm. Halbout easily moves from detailed analyses of the scripts (Easy Living, 53-54; No Time for Love, 55-58), directors’ and actors’ backgrounds (Frank Capra, George Stevens, Cary Grant, Irene Dunne) to generic archetypes, shedding light on the unique inventiveness the formula.\n\n5Chapter three focuses on narrative and stylistic conventions which are examined both structurally and diachronically. The plots fall under two main headings – “first encounter” (using and debunking fairy tales’ elements) and “remarriage” (where the conjugal relationship is renegotiated). Both focus on an inexpressible yet omnipresent theme: sex. Both can branch out indefinitely thanks to a variety of narrative structures and character types but also because the importance given to social context creates subcategories. Halbout then proceeds to a taxonomy of generic tropes in their full complexity and variety, exploring how the antagonistic couple generates transgression and ambivalence and how the social or intimate crises at stake can suggest possible regeneration. He finally examines the progressive changes in storylines throughout the decade, arguing that “the genre’s inherent instability” (120) demanded a vast corpus study. By the mid-forties however, American society had radically changed and the hybrid plotlines, heavy intertext and (self) parody that made the success of the screwball resulted in generic saturation and exhaustion. Screwball comedy narratives revealed uncannily prophetic: “Comedy is all about invasion and evasion, destruction and renewal. And behind the laughter, the games, the fight and the disguises lurks the constant question of extinction or metamorphosis” (88).\n\n6Part two, “Screwball Discourse: Interdiction and Indirection” sheds light on the (external or self-imposed) forms of censorship which contributed to the genre’s characteristic visual and verbal suggestiveness. Chapter four contextualizes the advent of censorship. It reviews the many social and economic changes the Great Depression brought about, insists on the growing influence of the talkies in redefining modern America, and scans the indignant responses of various conservative pressure groups who claimed scenarios mainly promoted sex and violence. In a dire economic context, the creation of an in-house regulatory body was mainly driven by economic reasons, but its consequences were far more reaching – from genre standardization to negotiations for approval, Halbout tackles the “creative push and pull between conservative forces and Hollywood creators” (152), which generated the screwball’s allusive and elliptic nature.\n\n7Chapter five provides a fresh outlook on the PCA’s recommendations and methods, supported by Halbout’s research in the institution’s archives which allow the reader to have first-hand access to the permanent tensions between censors and studios. Every stage of the film, from inception to synopsis and script(s) was scanned, assessed and commented upon. Well-documented examples reveal the number of memos, notes, discussions – and subsequent changes – necessary before final approval (The Talk of the Town, 154-156). The PCA’s obsession for control nevertheless gave way to loopholes, namely inconsistencies in the films’ evaluation and a desire for systematization which proved insufficient to grasp the allusive modes of communication developed within the scenarios.\n\n8Such exploration of the archives permits Halbout to draw up a very precise inventory of creation surveillance in chapter six. Scripts were subject to many rules and regulations which covered tangible elements as well as subjective notions: improper or rude dialogues were asked to be rewritten and movie titles changed; bodies’ proximity or exposure were carefully scrutinized as well as actors’ and (above all) actresses’ garments – all the controls evidencing a willingness to negate desire, seduction and sexuality. American institutions and their representatives were to be depicted with great care to promote an exemplary democracy. Screwball comedy resulted in a paradoxical blend of realism and prudishness: contemporary issues were addressed in effervescent urban settings while female characters donned oversized pajamas and married couples favored twin beds. The press played the role of final regulatory body, endorsing the efficiency of internal monitoring, granting the movies a “seal of approval” (188) and toning down any elements overlooked by censorship. After a decade however, the PCA was growingly criticized for failing to deliver. Screwball comedies had deftly developed “an arsenal of hard to control narrative transgressions” (192).\n\n9Resistance and creativity are the hallmarks of screwball comedies. Either hailed or condemned by the screenwriters and movie directors, the PCA’s restrictions triggered diversion strategies which formed the grammar and style of the genre. Chapter seven, the longest of part two, reviews tactics developed to contravene the code. Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife’s screenplay is minutely compared with its original French boulevard play (1921) and celebrates Ernst Lubitsch’s mastery of ellipses, innuendoes and suggestions (198-203). Screwball comedies relied on a subtext which was conveyed both verbally and visually. A vivid, inventive language ripe with wordplays, metaphors and a touch of slang underpinned the genre’s predilection for sexual matters. Slapstick gags, objects symbolism, camerawork and movie stars’ antics exposed traditional male/female stereotypes but also made fun of authority figures (fathers, heads of women’s clubs, policemen) and suggested physical intimacy. The various avoidance strategies established complicity with the viewer by relying upon their interpretative skills. Interestingly, the movies’ promotion campaigns blatantly ignored such strategies and explicitly worded the movies’ covert intentions.\n\n10Part three, “The Screwball Celebration and the Democratic Discussion”, offers a historical perspective on the genre, evidencing how the plots, family relationships, couples or social concerns fostered deep reflection on 1930s America and how private life gradually entered the public sphere. The emergence and expansion of the middle class brought about social and cultural changes. Consumption was key for the new generation of urban workers bent on leisurely activities such as dancing, going to the theater or to the movies. Pleasure entered the public sphere and prompted a cultural and political debate. Chapter eight reviews how discourse on marriage permeated the thirties. If sex and intimacy had been discussed as early as the 1890s, the ideological foundation of marriage changed radically, shifting from economic contract to love/sexual fulfilment. Mutual happiness became a central question and was discussed in essays and studies as well as fiction. Screwball comedies capitalized on an existing debate and attempted at redefining marriage. In the narratives, intimacy prevailed over the restrictions imposed by the public sphere. Chaos and disruption targeted all forms of conservatism. Representatives of the old order (romantic rivals, tyrannical fathers, moody judges, witless policemen) were ridiculed. The institution of marriage was desacralized: couples expedited their weddings, did not marry at all or drew up their own charters for conjugal life (Mr. and Mrs. Smith, 258). Notions of masculinity and femininity were challenged as female characters recurringly initiated change in the couple. Could the fictional redefinition be the premise for a fledgling social contract?\n\n11That is the focus of the final chapter. Tensions and unease pervaded the thirties: the success of political extremisms and populism revealed growing divides in American society. The screwball reflected those tensions, but their endings contributed to promote consensus and democratic ideals. The nonsensical, rebellious and iconoclastic nature of the plots and characters was mitigated by conclusions which somewhat reestablished conventional order. Ambitious women became supporting housewives. Linework was envisioned both as a driver for union (requiring cohesion) and social progress (heralding professions committed to fairness and freedom). In short, the fictional couple, a representation of the smallest social unit, reconciled and suggested regeneration was possible. “Screwball comedies, while explosive in their structures, reveal themselves to be inclusive in their narrative destination, successfully placing the myth of individual action, work and its benefits, within a larger, collaborative, democratic context” (286). The inclusion was expressed visually as the protagonists gradually appropriated the public space. If the screwball was defined by (spatial and social) paradigms, the couples’ relentless movements (fleeing to a new destination, driving through the city, roaming the streets) pointed to decompartmentalization. Public spaces stood as playgrounds but also homes for all classes to inhabit. Love was recognized in crowded spaces (hotel lobbies, department stores, train stations) where collective celebration replaced wedding ceremonies. The genre was a means to renegotiate the American social contract, which might explain the overwhelming yet short-lived success of screwball, the Second World War and its aftermath propelling the nation into a completely different era.\n\n12This diachronic and cross-sectional study of screwball comedy is a rigorous and nuanced work which constantly brings to light the complexities of a highly unstable genre that captured many contemporary ideological challenges. Halbout’s thorough approach provides historical, social and institutional context to the movies. His study covers the filmic texts, but also the intertexts (parodies, quotations, self-references) and paratexts (posters, press articles, marketing campaigns). Each chapter is divided into headings and subheadings which allow to circulate easily between the themes, tropes and social issues addressed. Halbout conveys the pleasure of the screwball through minute analyses supported by engaging pictures and illustrations. He never fails to summarize preexisting theories on specific filmic issues (genres, narrative structures, censorship) before discussing their relevance for the screwball. A didactic and dialectic book, Hollywood Screwball Comedy, 1934-1945, Sex, Love and Democratic Ideals offers a fresh and insightful perspective on the genre."
