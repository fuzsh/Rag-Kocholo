        "text": "What is an allusion?\n\nAn allusion is a literary device that makes an indirect reference to people, places, things, or events, either real or imaginary. Allusions express complex ideas in a simplified way by drawing a connection to something that is widely familiar or understood.\n\nAllusions must not be obscure or else it may not make sense.\n\nTypes of allusion\n\nThere are five main types of allusions:\n\nhistorical\n\nmythological\n\nreligious\n\nliterary\n\npopular culture\n\nHistorical allusions reference historic events or people that are significant in some way. An example is Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech:\n\n\"Five score years ago\" is a historical allusion to Abraham Lincoln's \"Gettysburg Address.\"\n\nMythological allusions make references to the myths stemming from various cultures. Some of the more popular references in English originated in ancient Greece and Rome.\n\nCupid is a great example of a mythological allusion. The winged angelic figure alludes to the Roman god of love, known by Eros to the Greeks.\n\nWhile mainly identified as biblical allusions in the western world, religious allusion can reference aspects of any religion.\n\nAs the creature who tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden, references to snakes typically suggest wickedness or deception.\n\nIn the Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling introduces Nagini, the antagonist's snake, as an allusion.\n\nLiterary allusions consist of writers and poets referencing characters, settings, plot points, etc., from previous novels, dramas, and poems.\n\nThe Fault in our Stars by John Green: Throughout his novel, Green references several aspects of William Shakespeare's play The Tragedy of Julius Caesar. The title of the book itself directly references a line from the play: \"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, / But in ourselves, that we are underlings.\"\n\nPop culture allusions refer to something contemporary, typically from a song, television show, or movie:\n\nReady Player One by Ernest Cline: Both the novel and movie version make numerous references to pop culture, including Back to the Future, Tron, Jurassic Park, and Friday the 13th.\n\nAllusion examples\n\nThe following examples contain well-known allusions from each type:\n\nHistorical\n\nBenedict Arnold: Benedict Arnold is known for defecting to the British while serving in the American military during the Revolutionary War. When someone is referred to as a \"Benedict Arnold,\" they are being called a traitor.\n\nAlbert Einstein: Albert Einstein was a famous scientist known for his level of intelligence. Referring to someone as an Einstein suggests they are incredibly smart.\n\nTitanic: The Titanic was the name of the \"unsinkable\" ship that struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage and sank. When someone identifies something as a \"titanic failure,\" they mean something was massively unsuccessful.\n\nMythological\n\nPandora's Box: If someone opens Pandora's box, they are causing unnecessary problems. In Greek mythology, Zeus gave Pandora a box and advised her never to open it. Her curiosity got the best of her, and upon opening it, she released sickness and death upon the world.\n\nHerculean: Being described as herculean derives from the Greek hero Hercules, who had god-like physical strength.\n\nAtlas: If someone references carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders, they are alluding to the Titan Atlas. Zeus punished Atlas for siding with the Titans in the war against him and the other gods. As punishment, Atlas must carry the world on his shoulders.\n\nReligious\n\nThirty Pieces of Silver: Judas betrayed Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. When someone is said to do something for thirty pieces of silver, it insinuates they have compromised trust, loyal, or friendship for personal gain.\n\nDavid and Goliath: The story of David and Goliath focuses on the smaller David unexpectedly defeating the giant Goliath. As an allusion, David and Goliath represent the success of an underdog.\n\nGood Samaritan: In this biblical parable, a priest, Levite, and Samaritan encounter a traveler who had been beaten. Out of the three men, the Samaritan is the only one who helped the beaten traveler. Therefore, whenever someone shows kindness to a stranger, they are identified as a good Samaritan.\n\nLiterary\n\nJekyll and Hyde: The story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde tells about a respected English doctor who develops a serum to mask his dark side. Instead, he turns into evil Mr. Hyde. If someone shows two strikingly different sides to their personality, they may be referred to as Jekyll and Hyde.\n\nDon Quixote: Cervantes’ character Don Quixote goes on a knightly mission to right all of the world’s wrongs. Someone “quixotic” is very idealistic, sometimes to the point of impracticality.\n\nScrooge: If someone says, “He’s such a Scrooge,” they allude to the cruel and miserly character in A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens.\n\nPopular culture\n\nKryptonite: As Superman's only weakness, kryptonite is often referenced as an item that directly impacts someone's figurative or literal strength.\n\nAndy Warhol: The American artist known for his paintings of Campbell soup cans commented on the surge in media consumption: \"In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes.\" Now, when someone receives media attention for something considered trivial, they are said to be experiencing their \"15 minutes of fame.\"\n\nThe Wizard of Oz: When Dorothy lands in Oz, she tells her dog, \"Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.\" When someone is in a new place or circumstance, they commonly allude to Dorothy's statement to indicate discomfort or lack of familiarity.\n\nPeople make use of allusions in everyday speech, whether or not they know it. The following are common examples of allusions:\n\nRomeo and Juliet: Shakespeare’s romantic young lovers\n\nAchilles’ heel: A weak spot, alluding to the myth of Achilles, a great warrior\n\nCatch-22: From Joseph Heller’s novel, a dilemma with no good resolution\n\nTurn into a pumpkin: When someone stays out too late; Cinderella’s coach turned back into a pumpkin\n\nSpartan: Could describe a sparse room or a self-disciplined person; alludes to warriors from ancient Sparta\n\nWhat is an allusion in literature?\n\nAuthors incorporate allusions to add depth and meaning to their work by referencing already established ideas. Some well-known allusions in famous literary works include the following:\n\nHamlet by William Shakespeare: “See what a grace was seated on this brow, / Hyperion‘s curls, the front of Jove himself, / An eye like Mars‘ to threaten and command.”\n\nMythological Allusion: Shakespeare's titular character references three Roman gods to illustrate how much he admired his father.\n\nHeart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad: “The two knitting women increase his anxiety by gazing at him and all the other sailors with knowing unconcern. Their eerie looks suggest that they know what will happen (the men dying), yet don’t care.”\n\nMythological Allusion: In Conrad's novel about the impact of colonization on Africa, his protagonist finds two knitting women who are seemingly aware that the men will soon die. The reference to the two women is an allusion to the Fates in Greek mythology who spin (birth), measure (life), and cut (death) the threads of life.\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee: \"The Cunninghams are country folks, farmers, and the crash hit them hardest.\"\n\nHistorical Allusion: When protagonist Scout Finch asks her father, Atticus, if they are as poor as the Cunningham family, he responds by alluding to the \"crash.\" Atticus' reference is to the stock market crash of 1929, which helped usher in the Great Depression, leaving farmers in the mid-west at a loss.\n\nFahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury: \"Montag stopped eating … he saw their Cheshire cat smiles burning through the walls of the house.\""
