        "text": "Michelle Pfeiffer is heading to the ranch.\n\nThe three-time Oscar nominee will star in and executive produce a “Yellowstone” spinoff series titled “The Madison,” from creator Taylor Sheridan.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nI (Barely) Survived 'Horizon': How Kevin Costner's Western Epic Fails Even His Most Diehard 'Yellowstone' Fans\n\nKevin Costner Rules Out 'Yellowstone' Return: 'I Loved It and I Know You Loved It'\n\nKevin Costner 'Read All the Stories' Spouting Untrue Rumors About 'Yellowstone' Exit: 'I Was Disappointed Nobody' at the Studios 'Stepped Up to Defend' Me\n\nThe show, which was previously in development under the title “2024,” follows a New York City family in the Madison River valley of central Montana. Per Paramount, “the series is a heartfelt study of grief and human connection.”\n\n“Michelle Pfeiffer is a remarkable talent who imbues every role with emotional depth, authenticity and grace. She is the perfect anchor to the newest chapter of the ‘Yellowstone’ universe, ‘The Madison,’ from the brilliant mind of Taylor Sheridan,” said Chris McCarthy, Paramount Global co-CEO and the president and CEO of Showtime and MTV Entertainment Studios.\n\n“The Madison” is produced by MTV Entertainment Studios, 101 Studios and Bosque Ranch Productions. Executive producers include Sheridan, David C. Glasser, John Linson, Art Linson, Ron Burkle, Bob Yari, David Hutkin, Christina Voros, Michael Friedman, Michelle Pfeiffer and Keith Cox.\n\n“The Madison” joins “Yellowstone” spinoffs “1883” and “1923” — while more series set in the television universe are in development.\n\nMeanwhile, the final batch of “Yellowstone” episodes — sans Kevin Costner — arrive on Nov. 10 on Paramount. Costner, the star of “Yellowstone” for the first five and a half seasons, exited the series over Paramount’s choice to split Season 5 into two parts, which the actor said interfered with his work on his four-part Western film series, “Horizon: An American Saga.” As “Yellowstone” was filming its final episodes, Costner was still expressing a desire to close his arc as the ranch-owning patriarch John Dutton, but he and the network were ultimately unable to come to terms.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney+ in August 2024\n\nWhat's Coming to Netflix in August 2024"
