        "text": "The year 1983 was not exactly a vintage year for films, but now, at the end, it looks to have been a lot better than it promised to be during the spring and summer. At that point it appeared quite possible that the makers of plastic monsters and directors-as-puppeteers had taken command of the commercial film industry. The prospect was scary without being in the least bit exciting, like second-rate horror films.\n\nSome of the most popular if not exactly most compelling performances of 1983 were given not by actors but by the special effects men who made Superman fly and by mechanized dolls - the tired old white shark in ''Jaws 3-D'' and George Lucas's stock company of disguised teddy bears in ''Return of the Jedi.'' Live-action actors who can act, it seemed, might soon be obsolete.\n\nThen, too, there was the matter of helicopters. I suspect that at this minute there are people on campuses all over the country writing learned theses on the esthetic impact on movies of helicopters, both as ends in themselves and as means to ends. Ends in themselves? Helicopters are the leading characters in John Badham's ''Blue Thunder'' and play supporting roles in the same director's ''WarGames.''\n\nEven more tiresome, though, is the evolution of the helicopter as a screen technique or tool - some would say crutch - as freely overused by today's filmmakers as jump-cuts, zooms and freeze frames. I have the impres sion that at least 70 percent of today's films wouldn't ever get off the ground if the directors had been denied those introductory helicopter shots that drop us gently and boringly into the movie's locale. Clint Eastwood's ''Sudden Impact'' is a nonstop demonstration of an adage that must be stitched on every sampler in Hollywood: When in doubt, call in the helicopters. Almost every other sequence either starts with the camera descending onto the scene in a helicopter or sailing off, heavenward, by means of a chopper. I can't prove it, but I doubt that the late, great Luis Bunuel - one of this year's major collections by the Grim Reaper - ever made use of a helicopter. If he did, it must have been done so unobtrusively that I can't remember it. Bunuel's masterpieces are shot mostly at eye level, which, though it doesn't deny the existence of God, doesn't call on Him to correct the inadequacies of the director, the writer and the other partners in the film's creation.\n\nHowever, even if the year produced only two films that I think stand a chance of becoming classics, there were finally so many films of far above average quality that the making up of a 10-best list was especially difficult and - let's face it - in some instances absolutely arbitrary. One can always supplement a 10-best list by appending the list of the 10 runners-up, but even these 20 titles don't hint at the variety and the sometimes unexpected excitement of this year's releases.\n\nFour of this year's most important events were, in effect, reprises: the rerelease of Alfred Hitchcock's incomparably elegant ''Rear Window,'' featuring what must be the quintessential James Stewart performance and one by Grace Kelly that forever captures her idealized beauty and wit; the rerelease of Luchino Visconti's ''Leopard,'' which demonstrates, among other things, that the young Burt Lancaster's talents were really no less than those of the older man we have applauded in ''Atlantic City'' and ''Local Hero''; the Regency Theater's retrospective devoted to the comic genius of Preston Sturges, and, finally, a film that isn't, to be perfectly correct, a theatrical film.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
