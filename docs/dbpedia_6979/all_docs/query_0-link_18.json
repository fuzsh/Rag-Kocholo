        "text": "Incident of the Captains Wife\n\nGil Favor and his men come upon an U. S. Army fort commanded by a woman and deserted except for a few civilians. Trail boss Gil Favor picks three men to accompany him to pick up supplies. They arrive to find the fort deserted except for a few civilians, two sick soldiers and Nora Holloway, wife of the commanding officer. Nora, who yearns for a promotion and a desk job in Washington for her husband, is a woman of action. Her husband has led half of his company of cavalry out to fight a band of Comancheros, white outlaws who have allied themselves with the Comanche Indians and forced the abandonment of another Army fortress. She has taken command of Fort Tracy against her husband's orders and sent out half of the cavalry to win the battle and gain her husband a promotion. Gil and his men realize that the practically abandoned fort will soon be a target for the Comanoheros. So they assume command and get ready for an attack. (TV-PG)\n\nToni's Boys\n\nAfter a number of attempts on the Angels' lives, Charlie hires Antonia Blake to protect them. Toni's boys (Bob, Matt and Cotton) are expert detectives but the Angels resist their orders to stay undercover and not venture out of Toni's mansion. Racketeer Danny Flores is tipped off to the presence of an investigation in which Tiffany figures prominently. They are sleuthing his modeling agency so he captures her in hopes of drawing the other Angels around. The guys uncover Flores' winery, a front for a scheme to infiltrate an elite gathering but Flores recognizes Kris and Kelly as hostesses at this affair for the rich, and in an effort to save them, Toni's boys are forced to blow their cover. Flores' men overcome the guys and then proceed with their original plan to seal the Angels behind a brick wall where they will suffocate. Toni's boys storm the hacienda and wine cellar."
