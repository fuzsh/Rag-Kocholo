        "text": "Citation preview\n\nROMANTIC\n\nJAMB HARVEY\n\nReading Romantic Comedy is like going to the movies. It re-creates for us movies we’ve come to love: movies the way they were when, in 1934, four in particular—It Hap¬ pened One Night, Twentieth Century, The Thin Man, and The Gay Divorcee—heralded the arrival of the golden age of the Hollywood romantic (“screwball”) comedy. Over the next ten years, some of Hollywood’s brightest di¬ rectors and stars turned out some of America’s most en¬ during and\n\nbeloved\n\nfilms.\n\nThe\n\nscrewballs — slangy,\n\nirreverent, playful, skeptical, and “powerfully, glamor¬ ously in love with love”—constitute a genre of American film unique in its combination of the innocent and the worldly, of swank and slapstick. Now critic James Har¬ vey— writing with brilliance and humor—gives us the first truly comprehensive book about these movies and the people who made them. Harvey helps us to see in a new way the films of Ernst Lubitsch, “the master” (who, more than anyone else, shaped the thirties Hollywood comedy, with such mas¬ terpieces as Trouble in Paradise and Ninotchka), Frank Capra (who, after It Happened One Night, made movies that often seemed to be screwball comedies, but whose intentions had become inspirational), Howard Hawks (.Bringing Up Baby, His Girl Friday), Leo McCarey (who made “the definitive screwball comedy” in The Awful Truth), Gregory La Cava (My Man Godfrey, Stage Door), and George Stevens (The More the Merrier). Finally he discusses the career of the great Preston Sturges, who, in the early 1940s, consolidated the triumphs of the screw¬ ball era and gave them a new twist with his gift for “a kind of offhand profundity” in a remarkable series of films: The Great McGinty, The Lady Eve, The Palm Beach Story, Sullivans Travels, and The Miracle oj Morgans Creek, among others. Harvey looks at the stars, examining their perform¬ ances and their personas to discover their essential screwball qualities. In Carole Lombard we see a “talent for infectious craziness”; in Jean Arthur, the “extraordi¬ nary ordinary” type; and in Irene Dunne, the “paradigm of the screwball heroine,” a deeply sensible woman with a passionate susceptibility for being amused and for “going wild.” Harvey makes us understand how Cary Grant could give sublimely screwball performances and still manage to become the icon of thirties male glamour.

So that whatever this book is I owe in one way or another to him. And it was David Lindner, editor of the now sorely missed Dance Life magazine, who first invited me years ago to write about Astaire and Rogers—an assignment that started everything. You need a lot of people to help you when you write a movie book. I’m spe¬ cially grateful to all those at the him archives and him companies who enabled me to see movies (many of them rare and almost inaccessible) when I needed to—to none more than to Charles Silver at the Museum of Modern Art Film Study Center, but also to his colleagues, Ron Magliozzi and Ed Carter; to Stuart Lindner, who is at Films Inc., and to Don Rosen and Marcie Gollup and Rhonda Bloom, who used to be; to Herbert Nusbaum at MGM; to Barbara Humphreys at the Library of Congress; to Charles Hopkins and Robert Rosen at the UCLA Film Archive; to Ron Haver at the L.A. County Museum; to Ray Penn and Bonnie Berman of Swank Films; and to Rodney Recor at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. William K. Everson lent me many hlms and never declined a request I made. I also want to mention John Belton of Columbia University, who turned up a rare copy of Lubitsch’s Angel just when I had de¬ spaired of finding it anywhere; and Howard Otway, who screened Swing High, Swing Low for me one night after hours at his Theatre 80 St. Marks. My friend Clyde Griffin at the New School guided me through my early days of running projectors and showing films, and would somehow always come up with a vacant room or space for me to show them in. Howard Mandelbaum and Carlos Clarens at Phototeque, and Mary Corliss and Terry Geesken at the Mu¬ seum of Modern Art Film Stills Archive, helped me through the long and pains¬ taking job of choosing the final illustrations. Lisa Rodenskv of Wellesley College saved me months of labor by transcribing the dialogue of all the major Stui •ges\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS films from videotape copies. And Bill Pass of UCLA did valuable research for me in the Sturges archive. I am also grateful to the staff of the UCLA Special Collections Library for their kindness—and above all to my cousins Grace and Glen Vining, who always made my visits to L.A. so special and happy. Another sort of help—equally necessary—has come from friends 1 could al¬ ways talk about movies with: Bob Garis above all, but also my friends Ann Noerdlinger, Richard Schwarz, Ron Overton, Nancy Goldner, Noll Brinckman, Howard Mandelbaum, and Peter Shaw. Andy Pawelczak and Nancy Cooper helped me through many small and larger crises over the writing days. And Charlotte Sky and Vic and Dylan Skolnick, by inviting me to hold classes at the Huntington Cinema, gave me the most satisfying experience of teaching movies that Eve ever had. I also want to thank the Department of English at the State University of New York at Stony Brook—particularly my colleagues Joe Pequigney and Dick Levine—for all their understanding and support during the time I was working on this book. My thanks, too, to Lillian Silkworth and Joanna Kalinowski. And to Mary Maguire at Knopf, who guided the book through pro¬ duction, to Mel Rosenthal, who served as the books production editor, and to Peter Andersen, who designed it. There are places Pm indebted to, too: the Thalia and Regency theatres, the two movie houses that have done more over the years than any others to keep repertory cinema alive in New York. As I write, the Regency is still prospering while the Thalia (although it now has branches at the Thalia Soho and the Cin¬ ema Village) is endangered—by realtors and gentrification. What accounts for such places being around for us at all, it seems, is the commitment of the people who run them—of Erank Rowley at the Regency and Richard Schwarz at the Thalia. And everyone who cares about seeing the classical Hollywood movies as they were meant to be seen—on big screens, in real theatres, with responsive audiences—owes them a particular gratitude. Some of the important people who figure in the history covered by this book— Irene Dunne, Claudette Colbert, Rex Harrison, Joel McCrea, Billy Wilder, Rouben Mamoulian, the late Walter Reisch—generously allowed me to inter¬ view them; and I want to thank each of them again. And for their recollections of Lubitsch and Lubitsch’s Hollywood, I want to thank Mary Loos and Dorshka Raphaelson. My thanks, too, to Sandy Sturges—not only for permitting me to use the Sturges archive at UCLA, but for sharing with me so many extraordinary memories of her husband. Above all, I want to express my debt to the remark¬ able Samson Raphaelson—whom I came to know because of this book, who contributed so much to it, and who died before it was finished. I miss him still. Finally I want to give my love and gratitude to Paula Fox and Sheila Gordon, to Bob Garis and Connie Harrier—who “lived” this book with me (so it seems to me) through the years, reading it in manuscript and sustaining both it and me by their responses and insights and friendship.\n\nJ.H.\n\nPreface\n\n. . . that sustained feat of careless magic we call “thirties comedy -PAULINE KAEL\n\nT\n\nHIS\n\nBOOK\n\nis about the screwball comedy, that extraordinary comic-\n\nromantic inspiration that invaded Hollywood in the thirties, that reached its climax, and end, in the forties, and that has left behind it an almost incredible number and variety of wonderful movie comedies—films that seem more aston¬ ishing to us now than they could have seemed to audiences of their own time, who took a certain level of wonder for granted, especially in romantic comedies. At the time, it was widely assumed that whatever else movies were, they were certainly ephemeral. It doesn’t look that way now. Hollywood’s so-called Golden Age seems against all odds to have left us some of our most enduring works of imagination. The movies in fact seem to have left us as many such works, as many permanent occasions of amazement and delight, as has any art form of our century. Especially the movies of the big studio era of the thirties and forties, the period of what Andre Bazin calls the classical American cinema. And at that period’s height, probably the single most widely successful style—the mode that seemed to inspire the highest flights and tap the deepest energies, not only of individual filmmakers but of Hollywood and the spirit of Hollywood itself— was the romantic movie comedy. It came to be widely known as “screwball’’—originally a publicist’s term— around 1936, when Gregory La Cava’s My Man Godfrey, with Carole Lombard’s dizzy rampaging heroine, seemed to compel the description. But screwball comedy was a wider category than the term itself suggests: it named a style associated less with scattiness or derangement than with a paradoxical kind of liberation, with romantic exaltation of a very down-to-earth kind. This paradox was the peculiar, energizing complication that made the style so congenial to Hollywood—so expressive of both the place and the fantasy—and so magical to audiences in general.\n\nX 1 1\n\nPREFACE There was almost nothing in the screwball mode that wasn’t familiar from long usage in theater, vaudeville, popular fiction, or earlier films. But watching Pow¬ ell and Loy or Astaire and Rogers, audiences in the mid-thirties forgot they had ever seen any of it before. And in a way they hadn’t. Nineteen thirty-four was the turning point, the year when it first began to seem as if the Hollywood movie had invented romantic comedy. Suddenly, in The Thin Man and It Happened One Night and The Gay Divorcee, in actors like Dunne and Lombard and Grant, Powell and Loy and Astaire—all the familiar, borrowed elements came together in combinations so new and fresh, so electric, and so intrinsically movielike that familiarity became revelation. What follows is about that revelation: about the movies and the movie stars it generated, about the directors and writers who interpreted it to the world, and, above all, about the two filmmaking giants, Ernst Lubitsch and Preston Sturges, who gave almost the whole of their matchless careers to it. And just as Sturges can be said to end the great era of the romantic comedy movie—consoli¬ dating its triumphs with a remarkable series of films in the forties—Lubitsch begins it.\n\nAUTHOR’S\n\nNOTE\n\nThe illustrations in this book (with the exception of a single chapter) are pro¬ duction stills—that is, photos taken on the set between filmings. Stills are meant for the most part to represent the action of the movie, but they don’t exactly reproduce it. What they do convey, however, is the glamour and glow of the original film experience. That’s why I’ve preferred them to frame enlarge¬ ments—whose quality is always less glamorous than that of on-screen projec¬ tion. The only place where I have used frame enlargements is in the AstaireRogers section, where I analyze a dance (“Let’s Face the Music”) in such detail that exactly faithful images seem crucial. All the quotations from movie dialogue in the book are taken directly from the movie itself—never (unless otherwise specified) from a screenplay or shoot¬ ing script, sources which nearly always differ markedly from what the actors on the screen finally say and do. And so also, all the directions and descriptions of action, intonation, or intention that occur in such dialogue passages, and which appear in parentheses and italics—such as the word “dryly,” for example, below: MAX FOR I)\n\n{dryly): That won’t be necessary, Mr. MacDonald . . .\n\n—are my insertions, my own interpretations of what’s on the screen or in the performance, and not the director’s or screenwriter’s. The only exceptions are those instances where I quote from the written text of a play or screenplay; the parenthetical directions are then, of course, the original author’s.\n\nJeanette MacDonald and Ernst Lubitsch on the set of Monte Carlo.\n\nPART\n\nThe Lubitsch Era,\n\n1929-1933\n\nJeanette MacDonald with her hair¬ dresser, Jack Buchanan, in LubitscKs Monte Carlo.\n\nLubitsch: The Naughty Operetta\n\nLubitsch was a giant . . . his talent and originality were stupefying. —ORSON WELLES, in a 1965 interview\n\n“It's a silly story. Only possible with music.” — DUKE OTTO VON LIEBENHEIM, in Monte Carlo\n\nC\n\nOMEDY WAS Hollywood’s essential genius. And probably no one, not even\n\nChaplin, did so much as Ernst Lubitsch did to shape the spirit and style, even the substance, of Hollywood comedy. No one who made films did so without being aware of the latest Lubitsch triumph or ingenuity, the newest brilliant example of his famous “touch.” And though his standing with critics and audi¬ ences fluctuated over the course of his career, the awe and respect he was held in by his filmmaking colleagues never varied. To many he was simply the best director in Hollywood-—“the masters’ master,” as David Niven called him. He was a small man with a cigar in his mouth at all times, a glinting eye, and a very downright manner. He had that most dependable of charms: the gift of being able to confer life and size and excitement on whatever took his interest, and to impart that excitement to others. If he didn’t embody glamour by Holly¬ wood standards, much better by Hollywood standards, he had it to give, imper¬ sonally and generously. Screenwriter Samson Raphaelson claimed that he never saw anyone in that “territory of egoists” who didn’t light up in the company of Lubitsch. He was a generally acknowledged “great” filmmaker who nonetheless worked comfortably, it seemed, inside the studio system instead of at odds with it. Un¬ like a Chaplin, or later a Welles, he never had to be ostracized or put in his place, never slapped down or disciplined. Lor the most part, he was a company man—so much so that he even became a mogul himself for a short time in 1935, when he was Paramount’s production chief: the only time in Hollywood history\n\n4\n\nTHE LUBITSCH ERA, 1929-1933 that a first-rate film artist would be given so much actual power. The experiment failed, of course; but the wonder is that it was even tried. It is hard to escape the suspicion that other filmmakers may have valued his films in a way for their lack of substance—that they admired Lubitsch for his ability to make much out of almost nothing. Such a talent could be only useful in the Hollywood of the great studios, and the filmmaker who had it (who more than Lubitsch?) was someone to be watched and learned from. Hollywood also admired—the exact word for it—his dirty jokes. A Lubitsch film was always famously risque. And yet he was never hassled by censors, either before or after shooting. To people in the industry, that was no negligible accomplishment. Contests with the censor were not only a challenge but an industry-wide obses¬ sion. And the ability to get really dirty jokes into your script or picture, and to get away with them, was a universally approved one. In this respect, as in others, writers and directors in the studio system often had the psychology of army noncoms. They felt powerless, but they knew where the power was, and there was no satisfaction or distinction in defying it and bringing it down on yourself. But to outwit it and mock it and then to be rewarded for your mockery (see Hecht and MacArthur’s The Front Page) was almost the highest satisfaction—apart from the money—that labor in the studio ranks could offer. To this psychology Lubitsch was a model and an ideal. For it wasn’t just mockery and dirty jokes that he got away with: it was intelligence itself, in a system that tended to empower stupidity. The spirit in those “wonderfully intelligent eyes” (in his associate Steffie Trondle’s phrase) seemed to win over every obstacle—for a while. Lubitsch films always had a certain highbrow following, even at a time when a fondness for movies was often something serious people either concealed or apologized for. Lubitsch, it’s true, could be as “Hollywood” as anyone—as vul¬ gar and philistine sometimes as any of his filmmaking peers. Still, a Lubitsch movie was something different. It was nearly impossible for an American intel¬ lectual of the thirties and forties to sit in front of a Lubitsch him and not feel— however much he might dissent from it otherwise—a certain kinship to the man and the mind that had produced it. No other major American filmmaker—not until Orson Welles, at least—produced this effect so strongly. You had to make allowances for a Capra or a Ford, even at times for a Chaplin. But not for Lu¬ bitsch. Movies, it was agreed generally, spoke a preliterate language. But not a Lubitsch him. A literate viewer might attack or dismiss his movies, but he didn't at least have to translate them. It was therefore not surprising that a cinemaphobe like George Jean Nathan should make an exception of Lubitsch (and The Marriage Circle) when deploring Hollywood, as he did frequently, or that Ed¬ mund Wilson could praise a Lubitsch him (as he did both Kiss Me Again and Lady Windermere's Fan) in exactly the same terms he might use for a serious new novel.\n\nLUBITSCH: THE NAUGHTY OPERETTA\n\n5\n\nRonald Colman with\n\nBut the Lubitsch career—which spans Germany and America, silents and\n\nMay McAvoy in Lady Win¬\n\ntalkies, and some thirty years—went through several phases, all of them re¬\n\ndermere’s Fan;\n\nmarkable. While still a minor actor in the Max Reinhardt Company, he began\n\nBert Lytell (at\n\nhis movie career as a silent-screen comic, appearing as a stereotyped lowcomedy Jew, usually a department store clerk struggling to make good, in a series of comedies he was soon directing as well as starring in, with titles like Schuhpalast Pinkus (1916) and Der Blusenkonig (1917). Even as late as 1919, when he had already become an important director of feature-length epics, he was still being seen on German screens as Meyer aus Berlin—though this was the last such film he would appear in. The first serious feature-length film he directed was also his first film with Pola Negri and Emil Jannings—an Egyptian-curse melodrama called Die Augen der Mumie Ma (1918). It was followed by Carmen (1918), also with Negri, and Madame DuBarry (1919), again with both Negri and Jannings. It was DuBarry that turned the minor Jewish clown into the most prestigious director on the international film scene. Lubitsch was twenty-seven. “The master of tragedy,”\n\nright) looks on.\n\n6\n\nTHE LUBITSCH ERA, 1929-1933 he was called; “the Reinhardt of the cinema,” “the Griffith of Europe.” He had a gift (derived from his tenure with Reinhardt) for film spectacle, for the effective deployment of huge crowds and enormous budgets. And the worldwide success of Madame DuBarry virtually created the German film industry overnight, mak¬ ing it a force in world cinema. And even though Lubitsch continued to direct comedies, both short and feature length, it was his epics he was famed for— films like Anna Boleyn (1920) and Das Weib des Pharao (1922), which were marked by an ability to combine the large public event with the intimate per¬ sonal detail. Like Griffith, Lubitsch was called a “humanizer of history.” But unlike Griffith’s, Lubitsch’s personal detail was generally comic and ironic— rarely sentimental. So he came to Hollywood at the end of 1922—but not, as it turned out, to make the bigger and better historical spectacles that “the Griffith of Europe” might be expected to do there. Lubitsch wanted, he said, to do “modern stories of American life.”* This notion came to him, it seems, only after he had done Rosita (1923), his first American film, with Mary Pickford as a seventeenthcentury Spanish street singer—and a box-office flop. (Pickford called him a “director of doors, not people.”) Around this time he saw Chaplin’s A Woman of Paris (1923), and it was a revelation to him. He signed with Warner Brothers and commenced a series of five films as small-scale as his earlier successes had been big. Sophisticated domestic comedies—The Marriage Circle in 1924 was the remarkable first one—with small casts of recurring performers (Monte Blue and Marie Prevost in three) and ingenious plots with recurring themes (sexual infidelity in all five). And with these films Lubitsch achieved once again— though on quite different terms than before—that combination of critical and commercial success which had distinguished his German career. From one point of view, however, each phase in his early Hollywood career can be seen as a kind of retrenching, a deliberate act of scaling downwards. And there were always observers ready to note this reductive pattern and to deplore it. In 1926 writer-actor Jim Tully in Vanity Fair saw Lubitsch’s decision to do films like The Marriage Circle as a refusal of “the greatest opportunity ever given to a director”—namely, the chance to become the “modern Moses” of Hollywood, someone who might lead the film industry out of its self-imposed wilderness; instead, Lubitsch had chosen to do “frothy films for sophisticated chambermaids and cinema critics.” Later on, Dwight MacDonald, who differed with this view of the domestic comedies, nevertheless deplored Lubitsch’s next phase, the operetta films of the early thirties. “Ernst Lubitsch enjoys the greatest reputation of any director now active in Hollywood,” MacDonald wrote in 1933, and added: “but this is based largely on his silent films.’’ * Precisely what he never succeeded in doing—since nearly all Lubitsch’s important American movies have European settings.\n\nLUBITSCH: THE NAUGHTY OPERETTA F ilms like Lady Windermere's Fan (1925), one of the silent cinema’s most extraordinary achievements. Lubitsch boasted when filming was done that he hadn’t used a single line of Oscar Wilde—no doubt because he knew just how good his own version was, even larger and richer than the original in some ways. Surprisingly, Lubitsch’s approach emphasizes character and “emotional values” over wit. The movie’s Lord Darlington (Ronald Colman) is genuinely ardent and troubled, a much more complex figure than Wilde’s. And not again until Garbo in Ninotchka (1939) does a Lubitsch film offer such a complexly observed hero¬ ine as Irene Rich’s Mrs. Erlynne. Lubitsch’s general effect on the Wilde play is to move it closer to moral and psychological realism. Through most of his early sound films, however, he seems to move determinedly in the opposite direc¬ tion—away from accepted modes of seriousness. People are so used by now to talking about Lubitsch as a giant of film history, as a major artist and filmmaker, that it can be surprising to discover how para¬ doxical and even perverse in a way the larger part of his achievement was. As if he defied his own eminence: this most “important” of filmmakers chose for the most part to work on almost aggressively unimportant projects, in minor modes and on trifling materials. Partly, of course, like any Hollywood filmmaker, how¬ ever important, he was maneuvering for survival. And more than many, he was a cautious and practical man. But in fact the kind of froth he was drawn to wasn’t all that commercial. Nor was it even very prestigious. It wasn’t “art” that he worked in the name of, but “sophistication.” And a rather ersatz form of it at that: the Continental theatrical tradition of the boulevard comedy, a haut bour¬ geois kind of swank, having more to do with daydreams of elegance than with the real thing. At his best, however, he could transform even this material. Clearly he took inspiration from it. His fondness for obscure Hungarian plays of the well-made school was a widespread Hollywood joke. (“It’s not enough to be Hungarian.” one saying went, “you’ve got to have a third act too”—Hungarian third acts being notoriously defective.) “I have a special weakness,” he once told an inter¬ viewer, “for the Continental type of thing, works like Molnar’s.” And, he might have added, works like Lehar’s. Lubitsch made five operetta films—all with Maurice Chevalier or Jeanette MacDonald or both—in the first five years of the sound era, beginning with The Love Parade in 1929.\n\nO\n\nNCE\n\nUPON\n\na time—in The Love Parade—there was a mythical kingdom\n\ncalled Sylvania, whose ruler, Queen Louise (Jeanette MacDonald), was not married. Nor has she ever been married (she is very young). Phis fact en¬ tirely preoccupies, it seems, all the people of her kingdom, from elderly cabinet ministers to children in school to the band in the palace courtyard, which plays\n\n7\n\n8\n\nTHE LUBITSCH ERA, 1 929-19 3 3\n\nThe rising of Queen Louise: Jeanette MacDonald in The Love Pa¬ rade (Virginia Bruce at left).\n\nthe wedding march under her bedroom window in spite of her express prohibi¬ tion against such music. What can she do? The obsession is everywhere she turns. “Don’t tell me you weren’t talking about it,” she says, opening a meeting with her cabinet. “You’re always talking about it.” Talking about what? the cab¬ inet ministers inquire innocently—playing dumb. But she knows—we know— that they were talking about it. In Sylvania, they always are. . . . There is no escape. Even in dreams. When we first meet this queen, she is being awakened in her cathedral-like\n\nLUBITSCH: THE NAUGHTY OPERETTA bedchamber by a group of ladies-in-waiting, who are as interested in finding out about her dreams of the night before as they are in assisting at her morning toilet. Radiant against the bedclothes and clutching a pillow, the young queen gratifies their curiosity by singing to them. \"‘Dream lover, fold your arms around me. / Dream lover, your romance has found me. . .\n\nShe rises as she sings,\n\ndescends from the dais, and stands at the foot of her bed in full-length undress. “Knowing too well,” she sings in her lingerie, “dreams never tell. . . .” Now she idles before us in medium shot as her attendants take up the chorus. As they pipe away behind her, she lowers her head shyly, kicks her foot out, puts a hand on the back of her neck, stretches on tiptoe—then, with arm upraised before her, moves with sudden dramatic emphasis to the right, into a peignoir held out for her by one of the ladies. She seats herself, and the ladies, still singing, kneel around her and produce mirrors for her to see herself in; she fluffs her hair and joins the singing again. The music beedul-dee-umps to its close. The queen rises and sings the final prolonged note, her arm upraised again; and holding it aloft as before, she follows it out and off, sweeping through a curtained door with her retinue following. End of number, empty set—which the camera holds for a few frames, presumably allowing us to collect our wits. We’ll need them: in the next scene she takes a bath. The “Lubitsch era” has begun. It’s all old stuff in a way. Lubitsch is frankly transferring the conventions of a stage number to the screen, retaining and even heightening the staginess. To movie audiences of 1929, the elements of the scene would have been familiar: the star in step-ins, the opening song about a dream romance, the proscenium arch framing: all occur, for example, in David Butler’s Sunny Side Up (1929), released just before The Love Parade, and a great popular success. Janet Gaynor sings there about her dream lover (“He’s ideal, but he’s not real”); but she does so in close-up, gazing and dimpling right at us, sitting in a chair and fully dressed. She appears in lingerie later on. But she thinks she is alone—until she notices the bemused hero (Charles Farrell) sitting on the bed and watching her, causing her to pose prettily and then flee.* What is new in The Love Parade is the way the familiar elements are com¬ bined, and the resulting Lubitschean tone: both dry and ardent, both dazzled and knowing. MacDonald is presented to us with a mixture of formality and leering, of operetta swank and strip-show prurience. The prurience has a be¬ nevolent quality. Those ladies-in-waiting are genuinely solicitous. The solici¬ tude gets nuttier as it gets elaborated, however. “I’m held in your spell,” the queen sings, and the ladies literally help her into the high note—lifting her from the bed to a standing position as she hits it. Once she is upright and on to *The same movie ineludes a musical production number called “Turn On the Heat,” in which undulating chorus girls not only melt igloos and glaciers but cause a forest of trees to come thrusting up through the ground around them: a sample of the kind of “risque” effect Lubitsch was not interested in.\n\n9\n\n10\n\nTHE LUBITSCH ERA, 1929-1933 the next note, they bow and withdraw as discreetly as if curtains were parting around her, to leave her at the center of the frame. What’s important to notice here is that the absurdity of all this, rather than destroying the affectionate tone the scene has set up earlier, really amplifies it. This effect is characteristic of Lubitsch, for whom pomp and ceremony tend to be functions of an essential good nature, especially when they are insanely elaborated. Lubitsch, of course, is kidding the operetta style here, heightening its artifice and absurdity at every point. It would be a mistake to suppose that he is camp¬ ing, however—or seriously making fun. He is not interested in subverting the style or in being superior to his audience’s (presumed) enthusiasm for it. He shares that enthusiasm. In his way. The matter is complicated, to say the least, by MacDonald’s lingerie. It’s not just her figure that we’re invited to admire but her dignity under the circumstances. This perilously maintained dignity is one of Lubitsch’s great subjects. One of the strongest biases of his comic vision is to see us all as trilling in our underwear. And if he shows MacDonald this way here, it’s not to undermine her song (that intention probably wouldn’t even have occurred to him) but to remind us what it is she’s singing about: the fact that all this operetta “prettiness,” all the piping and trilling, all this gentility and civility and soprano rapture, are really about getting laid. Lubitsch isn’t being sardonic when he makes this point—far from it. The contrast between these genteel the¬ atrical forms and their final, very ungenteel meanings only makes those forms more treasurable to him—and to us, as he shows them to us. This wonderful joke—the identification of high aspiration with low cravings, of the most high¬ falutin forms with the most down-to-earth realities—is of course basic Holly¬ wood.\n\nAnd\n\nthough\n\nLubitsch\n\ncertainly didn’t\n\n“teach” this joke\n\nto other\n\nmoviemakers any more than he originated it, he did teach them more than any- v one else did about how to shape and repeat and perfect it. And no one else, it is commonly agreed in Hollywood even today, ever told it quite as well or as elegantly as he did.\n\nQ\n\nUEEN Louise’s\n\nproblems begin to be solved when Count Alfred (Maurice\n\nChevalier), her military attache in Paris, is recalled to Sylvania—in dis¬ grace for his amorous activities. The queen reads the detailed official report on those activities in Count Alfred’s presence. She smokes furiously on a cigarette as she turns the pages, more and more rapidly, pausing only to look up and glare at him. The ultimate outcome of this interview is a private supper in her quar¬ ters, while her aged cabinet ministers watch from the garden and note the count’s progress. “If it goes on at this rate,” one of them observes grandly, “then we are entitled to the highest hopes.” The difficulty in all this, as these ministers have explained to the queen, is that a queen’s prince consort really has nothing to do.\n\nLUBITSCH: THE NAUGHTY OPERETTA\n\n1 1\n\nQueen Louise\n\nNothing to do? cries the queen (can she have been misinformed?). Well, of\n\n(MacDonald)\n\ncourse he has something to do; but such a marriage is not a situation that most\n\nback in bed; Count Alfred\n\nself-respecting men would enter into. Count Alfred, on the other hand, seems\n\n(Maurice\n\nto have been swept off his feet, and to be unsuspecting into the bargain. It isn’t\n\nChevalier) on\n\nuntil the wedding ceremony that he gets a hint of what’s in store for him—when\n\nhis way back to Paris.\n\nthe priest pronounces them “wife and man.” The rest of the story details the predictable stresses of this arrangement, which climax when the prince consort decides to break loose from the palace and return to Paris, compelling his royal wife to submit at last to his husbandly authority. “My king!” she exclaims as they embrace, and reprise the title song, before fadeout. In a way, the whole him is like that final duet: all the important scenes are between Alfred and Louise. And except for their low-comedy counterparts, his butler and her maid (Lupino Lane and Lillian Roth), who do their own duets from time to time, there are no other clearly personalized characters in the film. Still, there are several opportunities for spectacle, as might be expected in “the\n\n12\n\nTHE LUBITSCH ERA, 1929-1933 Griffith of Europe’s” first talkie. The queen reviews her troops—and sings “The March of the Grenadiers” (“Ev’ry uniform / Taking a heart by storm . . .”). The palace sets emphasize vastness and grandeur, and when the queen goes to the opera, the halls and great staircases are lined with guards standing at atten¬ tion—and singing. But mostly Lubitsch uses these spaces by emptying them out. Chevalier crosses a great hall to fetch his pajamas from another room. The queen runs up the grand staircase after him—in long shot, a tiny figure in the distance, with arm upraised futilely as she scuttles out of the frame’s upper edge. The royal wedding scene was described in the studio’s publicity releases as “perhaps the most dazzlingly spectacular scene yet witnessed and heard in a talking motion picture.” But Lubitsch’s relation to spectacle and to big-budget effects has become by this time rather curious. Not only are his vast sets used mainly to diminish and isolate his characters: even when he fills those sets, he seems oddly remote from the effect that results. He shows us the great wedding procession with all the involvement of a tourist taking snapshots: now from this angle, now from that (including an aerial shot from above—why not?), with no kinetic relation to the spectacle itself. The sequence is a clear instance of some¬ thing that was to become more and more a feature of Lubitsch’s work in the sound period: a kind of alienation—a dry, chill distance—from his own biggest effects. The joke he’s building up to here is about the very different degrees of defer¬ ence accorded to the queen and her new husband. In effect, we see two wedding processions: his and hers. First, hers. The guests are massed in the palace’s great throne room. The lord chamberlain gives three great knocks on the floor with his massive staff. There is an answering fanfare of trumpets; a choir bursts into full-throated song; and two great doors swing wide to disclose the queen in her bridal gown, proceeding slowly forward, her great jeweled train supported by page boys, her ladies-in-waiting just behind them. She moves slowly and shyly down the great staircase under the arched swords of her grenadier guards—until she reaches the foot of the throne and the officiating priest. Next, the prince consort—to-be enters. Cut to what looks like the door to a small closet. Bump-bump, goes a page boy with a baton. An off-screen organ plays a jaunty little fanfare, and out comes the bridegroom, looking cheerful and vacant. The organ thumps and tootles and he walks quickly out of the shot. Appearing in the next shot at the queen’s side. The humiliating (for him) ceremony ensues. “And you. Prince Alfred ... do you promise to be an obedient and docile husband . . . ?” Lubitsch turns Hollywood elephantiasis to almost delicate account. The massing of details in this sequence becomes a function of his wit and is char¬ acterized above all by its thoroughness. Nothing has been overlooked, for ex¬ ample, that might enhance or amplify the count s humiliation—from the size of\n\nLUBITSCH: THE NAUGHTY OPERETTA his door to the look on his face. The sound of that off-screen organ is exactly, inspirationally right: a sort of vague cheerful tootling, encouraging but dim. In the same sequence, we watch a huge, beturbaned Turk—the ambassador “from Afghanistan”—expostulating in nonsense syllables against the marriage cere¬ mony and its anti-male bias. But what is funny here is the way Lubitsch has framed this figure, in a long, static two-shot with an impassive Eugene Pallette, one of the queen’s ministers. Pallette stares equably ahead, sunk in himself, while the bulging-eyed Turk at his side fulminates massively in a stream of plosives and popping sounds. It takes a particularly rude sound, however, to startle Pallette into attention, to make him give up that equable forward gaze. Pallette in this shot is a typical Lubitsch figure: we can tell from his face that his relation to the outside world is both fitful and reluctant. And he is content¬ edly remote from the furious figure at his side. It is also characteristic of Lu¬ bitsch to imprison two such figures in the same extended shot, and to end the “most dazzlingly spectacular” sequence in the film with this odd, slightly and slyly irrelevant “climax.” Lor it’s clear that what he likes best about the spectacle in this film is the chance it gives him for waywardness, for anticlimax. And the effect isn’t always a comic one. Later on, when the queen goes to the opera—she is dramatically alone, having been abandoned by her husband—she marches in formal progress and lonely splendor down the staircase and through the great hall of the palace, past the chanting ranks of her grenadier guards. Lubitsch ends this convention¬ ally stirring sequence on an oddly rapt note, entranced and suspended, as his camera watches MacDonald in profile in a long, lateral tracking shot. As she walks forward, the line of her coat emphasizing the slouch of her body and the motion of her hips, she is as self-contained as Pallette was. But there is some¬ thing else quite different: an impersonal, even unconscious pride of youth and beauty in the movement, underlined by the gaunt elderly cabinet minister who walks behind her. She walks to the beat of the grenadiers’ song, raptly—and it’s almost as if the movie is holding its breath as it watches her to the fadeout, sauntering into darkness. But in The Love Parade it is less usual for the camera to follow movement than it is for a character to walk out of the frame, leaving the camera, and us, behind, where we stay for a few frames. An effect of cutting like a retard in music, it’s also an editing technique of Lubitsch’s silent films which persists in his talk ies until well into the thirties. People don’t just go out of a Lubitsch frame: they vacate it, leave it empty. We see them and then we see their absence, an empty chair or desk or space—a slight hesitation before we see where they have gone to, in the next shot. The signature step of this film is a quick exit, often in the wrong direction—or what looks like it to us. We are never quite sure where things are outside our immediate view. People enter Lubitsch’s shots\n\n13\n\n14\n\nTHE L U B I T S C H ERA, 1 929- 1 933 from unexpected points—how did they get there? The camera pans slightly and we see them where we didn’t expect them to be. This evenly maintained, quiet, steady disorientation about physical spaces is crucial to Lubitsch’s style. The movie frame in this style becomes a sort of register of the world beyond it—a world nearly always dislocating, unexpected in some way. Alone in this frame, with its connections to the unseen, people tend to look uneasy (they haven’t seen it yet) or discomfited (they have). Jeanette MacDonald has the ideal Lubitsch face: always slightly astonished. Even composed, she looks alarmed. And when she looks determined—as she often does, being a queen—that is a joke. Lubitsch conditions us to perceive almost any sign of determination or intention in his characters, any hint of autonomy, as primarily funny facts. Partly because the immediate world of the film is so unpredictable. But also because in a longer view it is just the reverse: Lubitsch’s heroes and heroines are the puppets of a very conventional sexual fate. Whatever they do either to promote or to impede that fate, we learn to feel, is mostly beside the point. Prince Alfred has declared his intention to leave wife and Sylvania at once— back to his carefree bachelor life in Paris—and he is packing his bags in his rooms. He doesn’t even answer his phone when his wife calls him from her rooms. She sobs on the top of her bed, heartbroken. Next we see her crossing the great hall, her sobbing now very distant. She has decided to go to him, and she looks almost poignantly small and dim as she scurries up the great staircase and out of the frame. Outside his door, she gets no response. Until he comes out—in silence—and crosses the great hall in the direction of her chambers. She runs after him, then past him—excitedly—looking over her shoulder as she goes. She reaches her room again and jumps promptly into bed. He enters the shot, and she lifts the bedclothes: looking up at him, with a kind of witless jocosity. But he has only come to fetch his pajamas from a nearby chair; he does so and exits. And she is up again—and after him. Back across the great hall, for the third time. Predictably, in this passage—extended, it seems, by almost nothing but its own confidence—those transits through the great hall culminate with the queen in bed \"‘asking for it” again, lifting the bedclothes and then being rebuffed. Lubitsch never relents in his radical reductive Hollywood vision. The problem at the beginning of this movie was getting the queen laid, and it is still the problem here at the end. But the most Lubitschean joke of all is the fact that this particular “point” should be the payoff to such a nuanced and elegant pas¬ sage of film, with its formal structure and repetitions. It’s the structural equiva¬ lent to MacDonald trilling in her underwear. And although the point is predictable (as always), the joke itself, its timing and form and inflections—that jocose look when MacDonald lifts the bedcov¬ ers—is (again as always) surprising. Just as we are never really uncertain about\n\nLUBITSCH: THE NAUGHTY OPERETTA the ultimate intentions and fates of Lubitschs characters, we are always uncer¬ tain about their immediate intentions—in crossing a room, or running to catch up, in entering a shot or leaving it. In The Love Parade we learn to expect that almost any pattern of movement will resolve itself in some unexpected way. And this moment-to-moment unexpectedness creates an important tension with the reductive, know-it-all meanings, the generic comic vision in which nothing is unexpected—in which either sex or money, or both, explain everything, or at least every human aspiration we can believe in. But as we see and experience a Lubitsch film, we are never made to feel as if we know it all, or that anyone could. The lubricity of The Love Parade, even with its implicit cynicism, is like MacDonald herself in the film: wondering and wide-eyed, full of happy energy and unquenchable surprise. W hen MacDonald and Chevalier have crossed that great hall for the final time, we get to see Chevalier alone when he reaches his own room again: col¬ lapsing across his bed with a grin of triumph. Suddenly he hears a door. He looks frowningly out of the frame. Cut to a close-up of MacDonald in front of the door, which is now closed behind her. No longer wide-eyed and ardent and beseeching as before, she looks subdued, opaque, deliberately unreadable— and she is silent. The prince approaches her. They are in a two-shot: “The key, please,’’ he says quietly. She looks away. No reply. “Trying to use force again, Madame?’’ She looks away still. At length it develops that she does have the key: she looks the way she does in this scene because she has hidden it in her sleeve. That overdetermined quality that Andre Bazin complains of in the basic Hollywood cutting style (shot/reverse-shot), in which the significance of each shot is all too readily fixed and declared, really seems not to be a feature of The Love Parade. There are too many images in it like MacDonald in front of that door—in which the point is precisely our uneasy non-recognition of the point, our uncertainty (even if only temporary) about just what this face means. It’s true that behind the surface is still another surface, and that the sugges¬ tions of privacy and mystery in Lubitsch people are always going to be resolved in a joke or a witticism or a double entendre. But the larger joke in these films is in a sense about complexity—about the fact that human beings are constantly and inconveniently surprising, self-deceived, contradictory. And in a way Lu¬ bitsch gives us the experience of complexity—the surprises, the perceptions of contradiction, the discovery of hidden meanings—without the content. The Love Parade is an exercise in style, rather purely. But it’s a style that pays tribute to, even embodies, the unpredictable and incalculable. Lubitschs style has a moral grace that undercuts the script’s often complacent cynicism, the chortling naughtiness of some of the jokes. Lubitsch has put on the screen a world where people live in a more or less continuous state of mild astonishment: not the sort of place where the complacencies and attitudes implied by “cynicism” and\n\n1 5\n\n16\n\nTHE LUBITSCH ERA, 1929-1933 “naughtiness” could seem very central. He is in full, happy command of a movie style that not only portrays but tends to induce the habit of wonder. And Jeanette MacDonald is its chief interpreter. She is also the focus of the magical feeling in The Love Parade—as well as its chief comic agent. Lubitsch’s own habit of wonder about her was something he would continue to explore in the even more accomplished comedies to come.\n\nJeanette MacDonald at the casino in Monte Carlo.\n\nM\n\nacDonald\n\nWAS\n\nan official Lubitsch discovery.\n\nShe was a featured\n\nBroadway player when movie star Richard Dix saw her in a short-lived show called Angela (with Eric Blore) in 1928. Dix asked her to make a screen test for Paramount. Nothing came of this test, however, until a year later when Lubitsch saw it—and promptly entrained for Chicago, where she was appearing in a show called Boom! Boom! He decided that this was his Queen Louise and signed her up. Her earlv screen personality was largely a Lubitsch invention— a very different image from the one she is now mainly (and unhappily) known\n\nLUBITSCH: THE NAUGHTY OPERETTA for: the genteel and often preposterous singing heroine of all those MGM oper¬ ettas with Nelson Eddy. But this metamorphosis happened, of course, after her Lubitsch years. In 1930 it was different. The Time magazine reviewer then could refer to her as a player chiefly distinguished by “her aptitude for undressing before the camera quickly and almost completely, with becoming grace and without embarrassment.” Monte Carlo (1930), her next film with Lubitsch, both confirmed this talent and revealed others. Lubitsch “the master,” wrote the Pho¬ toplay reviewer, has turned “a conventional prima donna” into “one of the best comediennes on the American screen.” Their rapport from the beginning, it seems, was in their common sense of humor: in his movies she was always European, and she said of him after his death in 1947 that he had “the most American sense of humor” she had ever known. Her “Americanness” both challenged and baffled him. By several ac¬ counts, he was in love with her. And if the passion was unrequited, the friend¬ ship wasn’t; it survived even Nelson Eddy and professional separation and lasted—close and funny and warm—until his death. It was just their mutual incongruity that Lubitsch valued, of course, and used for comic point. The con¬ trast between them was like the one he put on the screen between her and Che¬ valier: European rake and nice American girl. He liked those lingerie shows better than she did, and there were some arguments—most of which he won. She had a singing coach in constant attendance, a woman with the richly evoc¬ ative name of Grace Adele Newell. Lubitsch pretended never to know quite who this personage was—referring to her,\n\nwhen asked,\n\nas “Jeanette’s morals\n\nteacher.” He knew what he had in her from the start. Under his direction she is more than a charming, elegantly self-mocking comedienne: she is the quintessential Lubitsch heroine, as exactly suited to his comedy of dry astonishment as anyone ever would be. She is not exactly a “natural” comedian. There is a faintly cere¬ monial air to even her lightest moments, a sense of decisions taken and lessons learned behind almost everything she does. But it was just this that endeared her to Lubitsch, who was never really attracted to “naturals” of any kind. It was just those tensions and contradictions in MacDonald’s performing personality that made her “his type”: her primness in undress; her essential reserve in ges¬ tures of abandon; her ability above all to retain a real and impressive dignity through the most adverse scenes and circumstances. His affection for her gal¬ lantry in such moments is something you can feel through his driest inflections. She is always the slightest bit overemphatic. Even her beauty: the rather heavy-jawed plangency of her face; her big, lustrous, heavy-lidded eyes. She is not really a formidable woman; she is too indomitably good-tempered, too sunny and enchanted and enjoying herself for that. And it is one of Lubitsch’s tenderest, most affectionate jokes about her to cast her, as he does over and over again,\n\n1 7\n\n18\n\nTHE LUBITSCH ERA, 1929-1933 as a lady imperious, authoritative, domineering—a queen, a countess, the rich¬ est woman in Ruritania—a willful beauty, awesome in repose and awful in wrath. Above everything, MacDonald has—as Lubitsch so clearly saw—a gift for ardent nonsense, a knack for playing absurdity with total, stunning conviction as well as comic edge. Monte Carlo, Lubitsch’s second sound film, seems largely built around this facility of hers. In spite of the movie’s title, we don't see much of the casino or the gaming tables or of any locale but the heroine’s hotel suite— where she spends most of her time fighting an embarrassing yen she is getting for her hairdresser (Jack Buchanan). Grappling with a passion that she can’t even afford to notice: she is, after all, a countess. (He in fact is a count, but she can’t know that until the end of the film.) Soon, though, she yields to her desire quite fully and happily: it’s the naming of it that she has to fight against. She tries to be affronted, even at the height of passion. “That’s what you get,” she cries brokenly after emerging from a disabling kiss with the hero, “for being nice to your servants.” Monte Carlo is an advance in many ways over The Love Parade—in lunacy and witty extravagance as well as its mastery of sound film techniques. It is also brisker, more streamlined, purged of all extraneous stagy elements (like the Lupino Lane—Lillian Roth interludes in The Love Parade). Everything is more intimate. There is less space around what it shows us: the cutting is faster and the framing is tighter. It is also bawdier: the “ris-gaiety,” as it was called, is even more relentless, more inventive than before. MacDonald makes her obligatory first entrance in underwear. But this time she is running to catch a train (when the middle-aged conductor looks startled at her state of undress, she explains coldly that she has “just come from a wedding”)—escaping a marriage ceremony whose nutty logic is epitomized by the chinless and ineffectual bridegroom (Claud Allister) singing a song to the assembled guests about how he is going to get her back, “caveman style” (“She’ll Love Me and Like It”). The songs in Monte Carlo are generally witty, and possibly even benefit from not having to be tailored to the require¬ ments of a familiar screen personality like Chevalier’s. English music-hall star Jack Buchanan makes his American film debut here as MacDonald’s leading man. (His appearance wasn’t regarded as a success, and his next American film wouldn’t be until twenty-three years later, Vincente Minnelli’s The Band Wagon.) The song lyrics are by Tin Pan Alley veteran Leo Robin and have the requisite Lubitschean flavor, especially “Trimmin’ the Women,” about how to get your kicks by being a hairdresser (“Satisfy the craving / Linger-waving!”). And some of the film’s boldest jokes are set to strains of lilting melody, including an exchange about the heroine’s calling the hero by different names (her imperi¬ ousness again) of her own devising, and his promising to “come” to all of them.\n\nLUBITSCH: THE NAUGHTY OPERETTA I he bawdiness and the looniness are of course connected, mutually reinforc¬ ing. lhat connection is what MacDonald’s look of alarm is about, and why the movie makes that look so central. The action begins with one of those classic movie images of successful flight and freedom: the runaway bride. Countess Helene Mara (MacDonald) has run out on her wedding to a silly-ass duke, Otto von Liebenheim (Allister)—a man who, she says, has “everything a woman wants . . . nothing but money.” The countess, leaving her wedding gown behind and wearing nothing but her underthings and a coat, boards the first train out of town. When she finds out it’s headed toward Monte Carlo, she resolves to gamble her future at the gaming tables and sings “Beyond the Blue Horizon” out the window, as the train rushes, chugging and whistling, toward the promise of a new day. But promises of flight and freedom in Lubitsch films have a way of not paying off the way they should. Far from being the story of an adventurous and reckless heroine, coquetting her way through a glamorous and glittering capital, baffling and taunting a lovestruck hero, and so on—the movie is about a woman in her hotel room, the bills unpaid, falling in love with one servant while being coldly observed by another (her maid, played by ZaSu Pitts). The image of Countess Mara as breaking loose turns out to be mainly ironic. (Also, we learn that this is the third time she’s escaped from the same marriage to the same man.) She is neither an adventuress nor a free spirit but a “woman of propriety,” as she is described by the opera singers of the final sequence. And her creator wouldn’t have it any other way: a lady’s “propriety” is one of those elegant civilized ar¬ rangements he particularly values. For Lubitsch, it could almost be said, all constraints and formal manners are a dirty joke—a delightful one. But it’s no wonder his favorite heroine looks steadily alarmed. And Lubitsch’s camera, like MacDonald herself in this film, tends to stare. It does fewer of the blinks, starts, and double takes that mark the style of The Love Parade. Those effects of dislocation and discontinuity that he gets by cutting in the earlier film, here tend to be contained in the same shot. Where the basic visual device of The Love Parade is the shot/reverse-shot, in Monte Carlo it’s a two-shot—long, laconic, stationary—with two faces in the same frame, offering an image of violently opposed self-absorptions, registering simultaneous but radically different inner experiences. As when Buchanan, the disguised count, first “does” MacDonald’s hair. He shampoos it by mistake, an error that calls for an immediate and strenuous rinse-and-dry. Followed by a shot of MacDonald sitting indignant under a billowing cloud of her own hair while Buchanan stands over her like some mad orchestra conductor and wields the hand dryer: the hair has a life of its own as she seethes below it and the ecstatic Buchanan “works” above. But the movie’s most memorable instance of fiercely missed signals between\n\n19\n\n20\n\nTHE LUBITSCH ERA, 1929-1933 people trapped in the same movie frame is the opera box sequence between MacDonald and Allister. MacDonald has fallen in love with Buchanan, then quarreled with him and thrown him out—an event that has made her late for the opera. The compliant duke is waiting for her in their box, and the opera— Monsieur Beaucaire, about a hairdresser who is really a nobleman in disguise— is well underway when she arrives, distraught. “Have I missed very much?,, she inquires. “Oh, no, no,” replies her suitor, always anxious to make her happy. “Only the first and second acts.” And when Allister—who has a monocle, an imbecile sunniness, a perpetually open mouth, and a tendency to lead with his teeth—asks her whether she found the hairdresser, MacDonald instructs him angrily never to mention hair or hairdressers to her again. She changes the sub¬ ject; “What’s the opera about?” she inquires. Allister looks forward, and struck to the heart. But he is obliged to tell her: it’s about this hairdresser. She looks at him. “I can’t help it,” he says, reasonably. Once she has taken this informa¬ tion in, however—gravely and at length—she decides to hazard some questions about it. COUNTESS (looking away): What’s wrong with this hairdresser? DUKE {a toothy grin in reply): It’s a silly story. Only possible with mu¬\n\nsic. . . . (She looks at him.) Imagine—a lady falling in love with a hair¬ dresser. [Pause. She continues to gaze at him.) COUNTESS (still staring at him): That’s possible . . . even without mu¬\n\nsic. . . . (She looks frontwards again.) Things like that happen every day ... 1 should say so . . . —Tell me—did she marry him? DUKE: Oh, no. She had no idea he was a hairdresser. She’s only just found\n\nit out. COUNTESS: Then what did she do? DUKE: What could she do? She threw him out, of course. . . .\n\nThe countess’s astonishment at this last information is almost more than she can support. She turns and stares at the duke again, burningly. She draws back, still staring, her hand at her throat. At length, by virtue of scrutinizing the duke it seems, she appears to have taken this new and astounding fact in: she nods gravely. “She’ll regret it,” she says, in a tone so baleful and tragic that the duke looks suddenly terrified. He continues to look front. The take here is nearly three minutes long: a steady, deadpan, unblinking contemplation of absolute impasse and mutual incomprehension, of burning¬ eyed blindness and choked passionate misunderstanding. It’s the joke of human isolation, and the recurrence of such two-shot effects suggests just how fond of that joke Lubitsch is. It should also suggest why Monte Carlo features a heroine who is largely precluded from breaking loose, even when she sets out to do so. Lubitsch treats even space and motion in the film in a way that underscores the\n\nLUBITSCH: THE NAUGHTY OPERETTA point: break loose to where? from where? Once again, as in The Love Parade, MacDonald walks in profile, with the camera tracking laterally beside her. She is walking—watched by the hero and his friend—through a garden on her way to the Casino: alone, in twilight, trailing a fan, moving purposefully and looking straight before her, with nothing on the soundtrack but the faint crunch of gravel under her feet. It is a deliberately odd, deliberately deadpan effect—like the shot of a Lubitsch door, oddly prolonged, oddly laconic (like the door too, it turns out to be the buildup to a joke). But also, like other such moments involv¬ ing MacDonald, it is privileged and oddly beautiful. And the beauty has to do with something melancholy, with our sense that she is “going nowhere.” The path seems improbably endless; her relation to the camera never varies; nor, seemingly, does the backdrop of shrubs and bushes she walks in front of. And Lubitsch cuts between her and the two men standing and watching her in a way that suggests she never gets any farther away from them. It’s appropriate, then, that the most stirring moment in the film should be a song number, by Buchanan and MacDonald, about going out—and that it should lead to their coming right back again. They are going to the Casino (but when they get there, the sight of the duke sends them hustling out again). Bu¬ chanan is meant to be “lucky,” and this is the night when they expect to recoup MacDonalds losses. They are dressed in their evening clothes and ready to go. They sing: Always In all ways Rely upon me . . . Should any doubt come, Wait for the outcome Hopefully! They walk on the second chorus—music-hall style—strolling and strutting into an outer room, where she dons her wrap, he knots his silk scarf and pops his hat on. MacDonald’s stroll is a kind of sideways walk, leading with one shoulder and looking invitingly over the other. And they sing, of course, on and on, and out the door. We ll find a happy ending— If you will keep depending— Always In all ways On me. . . . What’s nice about this is the sense of a very qualified kind of elation—a music-hall number in a hotel room. But it’s not like Astaire dancing over table\n\n21\n\n22\n\nTHE LUBITSCH ERA, 1929-1 933 tops and sofas: these singers don’t transform or transcend their environment— indeed, they never lose sight of it. Nor do we. The constraint and limitation are there in the music, the movement, in the slight charming awkwardness, in the jaunty angle of MacDonald’s elbow as she leads the way to the door, in the way the sexual and romantic excitement is modified by the slightly self-conscious, slightly self-mocking roguishness.\n\nIndeed,\n\nthe whole music-hall strolling\n\nstyle—which Buchanan and MacDonald are both peerless at—is an image of excitement held back, of transport smiled over and shrugged at, of elation of¬ fered almost diffidently. What makes the number stirring is precisely this sense of constraints both accepted and surmounted. The Lubitschean festivity: gal¬ lantry and gaiety within limits that nobody dances beyond or away from—or even sings about very convincingly.\n\nL\n\nUBITSCH MIGHT\n\nhave been repeating himself dangerously with these oper-\n\nJ etta films—or so many people were beginning to feel. But another such film was just what Maurice Chevalier’s screen career, faltering since The Love Parade, seemed to need by 1931. The Smiling Lieutenant (1931)—a LubitschChevalier film without MacDonald—was a hit both critically and commercially. It was made at Astoria, Long Island, while Lubitsch was also functioning as “supervising director” of the studios there. And it was co-written by Samson Raphaelson, the New York playwright who was quickly to become, and remain, Lubitsch’s favorite screenwriter. In the early days of talkies the movies seemed to take giant steps almost from month to month, and technically this is the most accomplished of the early Lu¬ bitsch sound films. In sets, camerawork, background music, alternations of sound and silence, the whole film achieves a fluency that makes The Love Pa¬ rade and Monte Carlo look comparatively stilted. And yet nothing in The Smiling Lieutenant calls attention to these feats of smoothly functioning technique (no sequences as flashy as, for example, the “Blue Horizon” number in Monte Carlo): what’s most impressive is the quiet confidence of it all. Although at times the sets seem constricted (this was Long Island, not Hollywood): the parade with Princess Anna in her carriage is very cramped and small-scale—even if we don’t think of comparable moments in Monte Carlo and The Love Parade. And the various palace halls and chambers don’t cover the daunting expanses that Lubitsch seems generally to have preferred in these films. But otherwise, the movie’s locales are a triumph,* more articulated and interestingly detailed than ever (there are obvious painted backdrops in Monte Carlo, even in interiors), from the rococo and gingerbread of the palaces to the elaborate tracery of trees * Hans Dreier is the credited art director—as he was on most Paramount films of the period, including all of Lubitsch’s.\n\nMaurice Chevalier sings about his\n\nand street lamps in the beer gardens and street corners of the lieutenant’s be¬\n\nbugle in The\n\nloved Vienna.\n\nSmiling Lieutenant.\n\nKing Adolf of Flausenthurm (George Barbier) has a spinsterish daughter, Pri ncess Anna (Miriam Hopkins), who takes both alarm and offense on a visit to Vienna when Niki, an Austrian lieutenant (Maurice Chevalier), smiles and winks at her as she is passing before him in official review. The fact, as we see, is that he is winking at his girlfriend, Franzi (Claudette Colbert), who is standing across the street from him making love signals just when the princess’s carriage happens to pass between them. When he is called to account by the enraged King Adolf, Lieutenant Niki tries to save his neck by making an urgent personal appeal to Princess Anna. He is so successful that she insists—to his horror— upon having him for her husband. And soon, with the ensuing approval of Em¬ peror Franz Joseph himself, Anna’s infatuation has the power of the Austrian empire behind it. Niki has no choice. Neither does Franzi: she walks out of his\n\n24\n\nTHE LUBITSCH ERA, 1929-1933 life, passing under a street lamp and disappearing into the darkness to mournful theme music and a lingering fadeout. But come the royal wedding night, Niki exercises in private what he has been denied in public: his chance to say no. Anna, who understands these things dimly at best (she even sucks her thumb at moments of stress), is left on her bridal night with nothing to do but play checkers with her father. And when, after a while, Franzi turns up in Elausenthurm—she is touring with her all-girl orchestra—she and Niki resume their affair clandestinely. But one night Franzi goes to the palace for their usual rendezvous and instead finds Anna waiting for her. When Franzi sees how unhappy the young princess is, she takes pity on her. She gives Anna some much-needed lessons in pleasing a man—and walks out of Niki’s life for the second, and presumably final, time. The lessons do their job: Niki is so enchanted with his sexy new wife that he resolves to settle down with her. It’s all much like The Love Parade, of course—with elements of Monte Carlo thrown in. What’s missing is the MacDonald heroine, and other things, too, that seem (for Lubitsch) to be related to her: those daringly extended privileged mo¬ ments, like the opera box sequence in Monte Carlo or her back-and-forth pursuit of Chevalier through the marble halls of The Love Parade. The Smiling Lieuten¬ ant is a work of nearly total assurance. But that assurance seems cold, cautious, even lifeless. Having attained it, Lubitsch takes no chances with it, or so it seems: there are almost none of the risks or hesitations, none of the dislocations or daring suspensions-of-meaning before a joke, that mark the two earlier films. And that tone of dry astonishment that MacDonald in particular commands— that propensity to motions of surprise and wonder that transfigures the obsessive “naughtiness” of the other films—is mostly missing from this one. We are left with the “naughtiness”—and a certain sourness, too, which sur¬ faces in spite of the film’s declared intentions. In a sense the MacDonald heroine isn't missing: she is divided between these two heroines. The prim, virginal side goes to Hopkins’s Princess Anna; the dashing, ardent, yielding side to Colbert’s Franzi. But clearly Lubitsch isn’t easy with this split, or with the simplifications it entails. These latter, in fact, trigger something worse than unease. The jokes about Anna’s sexual retardation—including the thumb-sucking—are cruder and cruder than they should be. And there is a tendency to punish the sexy heroine, too. The self-judgment of Franzi’s “girls who start with breakfast\" speech (the point being that they don’t get invited to the other meals) is an example. So is the odd, cold way the film lingers over her suffering—with full violin threnody in the background—when she is shunted aside for the princess. And Chevalier is alarming. Always animated, here he seems demented— particularly in his opening song (the score is by Oscar Straus and Clifford Grey), where he boasts about being a member of “the Boudoir Brigadiers.” Chevalier\n\nLUBITSCH: THE NAUGHTY OPERETTA sings this song right into the camera and makes a great play throughout of put¬ ting his thumb to his mouth and blowing a make-believe bugle: We’re famous near and far For our ra£-tuh-tuh-£a£-tuh-tuh-£a/i/ What’s unsettling is that each time he comes to this refrain—chortling and gri¬ macing and rolling his eyes—he seems determined to outdo the last time. It’s unnerving because, for all the leering, there is no suggestion of real carnality. Indeed, there hardly ever is in a Chevalier performance. (In some ways, ironi¬ cally, he is the Nelson Eddy of the dirty joke.) And the more excited he gets, the less he suggests passion or erotic life of any kind—the more he suggests impotence and the effort to “get it up,” joking and grimacing to the bitter, hope¬ less, soul-shattering end. Chevalier singing about his “bugle” could serve as an emblem for everything D. H. Lawrence meant by the modern audience’s pro¬ pensity for “sex in the head”—by our affliction with “the dirty little secret.” That affliction seems to trouble the whole film—at times like a madness. Lubitsch’s method here is as unrelenting as his star’s. Every reference to a mu¬ sical instrument, for example (and there are many), carries the same charge of ribald meaning. Franzi, we are told, plays the violin. “You should see her fin¬ gers!” says one admirer. “She has the daintiest little fingers!” She plays it in public, too, Princess Anna informs her father, the king. He is not surprised. Do all women like that play the violin? the princess inquires. No, but they play, replies her father. “So you play the piano?” says Franzi to Niki, flirting with him. “Someday we may have”—she is very roguish here—“a duet.” “I love chamber music,” replies the eager Niki. And on and on and on. You begin to feel that the real Lubitsch touch is an elbow in the ribs—tirelessly, even mani¬ acally reapplied. But even when he’s uninspired, Lubitsch can be funny. Just when we are beginning to give up on him, he does something comic and sanative. Niki and Eranzi actually do play a piano and violin duet. And they do so in a perfect deadpan manner, as if to say: what did you think we were talking about? And the ribald music metaphor does in fact begin to take on some life near the end of the film, when the two women in Niki’s life finally meet. This sequence is nearly the best in the movie: full of energy and wit and self-delighted outra¬ geousness. It is also—and probably significantly—the scene in which the two “sides” of the Lubitsch heroine, sexy and proper, at last come together in this film. Franzi, against her own best interests, decides to help the Princess Anna win her husband back. She asks first if Anna can play the piano. The answer is yes. But what can she play on it? “Etude for Live Fingers,” “Cloister Bells,” and “A Maiden’s Prayer’’ turn out to be the unhappy Anna’s specialties. Franzi is un-\n\n25\n\n26\n\nTHE LUBITSCH ERA, 1929-1933 discouraged. “Let me see your underwear,” she says. Anna lifts her skirts to reveal a pair of thigh-length panties secured at each knee with a ribbon. “Clois¬ ter Bells,” remarks Franzi dryly. And she flashes her step-ins at us. This turns out to be a song cue. Franzi sits at the piano and sings: Jazz up your lingerie! Just like a melody Be happy! Choose snappy Music to wear! Viewers who associate Lubitsch with some idea of “good taste” have probably forgotten this moment, and the many, many others like it in his films. This song number works, if at all, precisely because of its bad taste, because of its sheer happy vulgarity. Especially when the two women start to jam it together at the piano, which is played throughout the sequence in a rollicking, ricky-tick style. “Get hot!” sings Colbert. “Ell try,” answers Hopkins—and makes a sustained but off-key sound. “Not so hot,” chants Colbert and thumps the piano keys. “It sounds like eighteen-fifty.” Hopkins tries it again, better this time. “You’ve got it now, that’s nifty!” cries Colbert, with a real high-rolling abandon at the piano and a slight squeak in her singing voice when she hits “nifty”—which is just the right word too for the break-loose jauntiness of the whole sequence. A bit late, but the rest of the movie seems oddly freed by this new and lively tone, as if the romping, self-declaring vulgarity had set something off. At any rate, there follows a sequence with the dreamlike, hallucinatory edge that the best Lubitsch jokes often have: a series of swift tableaux designed to illustrate the effect of Anna’s lessons on her husband. It’s a passage both deranged and comic, far from the cautious leering tone of the movie’s earlier parts. Hopkins is seen playing her own piano now, alone and unassisted, in a raffish barroom strut-and-slide style. Niki, on his way out as usual but attracted by these strange sounds in the palace, stares at her from the doorway, incredulously. She is smok¬ ing a cigarette—it dangles from the side of her mouth. She is dressed in a tatty¬ looking robe; she looks tougk and experienced and a little bored. Niki stares. Now she is seated and is reading a book—in the same robe. A canary in a nearby cage starts to sing, piercingly. Anna rises, removes her robe, and throws it over the cage—silencing the canary and revealing herself in her new stepins: she strikes a pose by the now shrouded cage, a waggish look over her shoulder as she does so. Niki is astonished—about time, too. The movie is nearly over.\n\nLUBITSCH: THE NAUGHTY OPERETTA\n\nA\n\nfter\n\nThe Man I Killed (see chapter 2) Lubitsch turned once again to the\n\nl. operetta film, once again to the teaming of Chevalier and MacDonald. Although he had originally meant only to produce One Hour with You (1932)— after he and Raphaelson had written the screenplay, George Cukor was assigned to direct—a close watch on the daily rushes left him dissatisfied with Cukor’s work, and he took over the direction himself. So there can be no question about it: it was Lubitsch himself who did this trashing, or at least trivializing, of his own most prestigious early work. One Hour with You is a remake of his first important American film, The Marriage Circle (1924), and is in every most obvious way a diminishment of it: the silent classic—sardonic, original, often grimly ironic—has been turned into this standard (by this time, very standard) Lubitsch musical. One Hour with You at once follows The Marriage Circle closely and entirely transforms it. The plot, common to both films, revolves around two married couples, one happy, the other distinctly not so. The happy wife insists that her husband—in both versions he is a doctor, and wealthy—pay some personal attention to her best girlfriend, who is very unhappily married. What the wife doesn’t know is that the friend has already resolved to seduce the husband. And what all three of them don’t know are the hopes of the friend’s own husband— in both versions, a professor. With the help of a private detective, the professor has set a trap to catch his wife in an infidelity so that he can at last divorce her. And to round out this pattern, the doctor’s wife is also being pursued by a wouldbe seducer. But he is an ineffectual Other Man type, a mostly comic figure, and therefore never really a serious possibility for the heroine, as Mitzi (Mizzie in the silent version), the sexy best friend, is for the hero. The two versions of the Mitzi figure mark the differences between the two movies. In the silent film, Marie Prevost’s mischief has a malevolent, even a pathological edge, whereas Genevieve Tobin, in the musicalized version, seems merely silly and reckless. And Adolphe Menjou, the professor of The Marriage Circle, has an acrid disdain and a weight of bitterness, both a weariness with his wife and an anger at her, that Roland Young in the sound film doesn’t even hint at—in spite of the little chuckle he keeps giving (“I have no sense of humor at all,” he insists ominously to the discomfited Chevalier) and the thin smile that accompanies it. The pain and hatred and discord that Menjou and Prevost con¬ vey so powerfully in the silent film are emotions entirely missing from One Hour with You—just as they are missing for the most part from Lubitsch’s subsequent work. For in trivializing (and, presumably, commercializing) the materials of the earlier film, Lubitsch is also, paradoxically, moving in the direction he was most\n\n27\n\n28\n\nTHE LUBITSCH ERA, 1929-1933\n\nThe seductress and the doctor: two versions.\n\nserious about. Not only does One Hour with You restore those elements of style\n\nMarie Prevost\n\nand angles of view that The Smiling Lieutenant had scanted—the hesitations,\n\nand Monte Blue in The\n\nthe vacated frames, the daring long takes, the incongruous two-shots, the images\n\nMarriage\n\nof solipsist discord—but these defining Lubitschean traits are once again at the\n\nCircle (above);\n\ncenter of the movie experience, where they belong. One Hour with You not only\n\nGenevieve Tobin and\n\nconsolidates past gains but makes new ones as well. The collaboration with\n\nMaurice\n\nSamson Raphaelson, with his special gifts for comic characterization, is clearly\n\nChevalier in\n\npaying off here, in exciting ways. One Hour with You is the most richly peopled\n\nOne Hour with You.\n\nof all Lubitsch’s early operetta films. And in this respect especially, it foreshad¬ ows the triumphs of Trouble in Paradise and The Merry Widow (which are also Raphaelson screenplays). It begins to define a Lubitsch specialty: his odd, funny mimicry of the inner life, intensely lived. The minor characters here— even the very minor characters—have a disconcertingly independent life. There is a girl who licks envelopes in a government office (the film takes place in modern Paris). She appears fleetingly in one of those montages that detail the passage of a crucial document through various hands. This particular document is the legal announcement that names Doctor Berthier (Chevalier) as corespon-\n\nLUBITSCH: THE NAUGHTY OPERETTA\n\ndent in the professors divorce suit against his wife, Mitzi. What we see when this particular girl licks this envelope, its contents so devastating to the film’s hero, is that she rolls her eyes lasciviously—confirming our worst fears about all those unseen “girls” in all our lives. The professor hires a detective (Richard Carle) to shadow the duplicitous Mitzi. We see this figure early in the movie, when he visits the professor, pre¬ sumably one of their initial interviews. He is not what we expect from a movie detective, let alone a Parisian one: he looks more like a New England store¬ keeper or a rural county judge. What he looks most of all, however, is impassive: a shrewd, turkey-faced, white-haired, elderly man, keeping his own dignified counsel. He does so sitting next to Young, the professor, on a couch, in a twoshot. The off-screen object they are looking at (and musing over) is, it develops, a hanging portrait of Mitzi. Mitzi herself is on the premises in another room. She is, as usual, going out. She talks to her husband through the door. “Oh, sweet¬ heart,” she calls. “She’s lying,” says Young to the detective. “Lie back,” the other advises. More melodious endearments through the door. The wife takes her leave. “I don’t want to disturb you,” she calls through the door. Young looks\n\n29\n\n30\n\nTHE LUBITSCH ERA, 1929-1933 at the detective. The detective makes a face. More goodbyes are exchanged, and there is the sound of a door slamming. The two men, still in their two-shot on the couch, look blankly forward. The detective is gazing at a cigar in his hand— a gift from the professor. It is unlit, and he turns it slowly between his fingers. “In Switzerland,” says the professor at length, slowly and thoughtfully, “we have a very peculiar law.” The detective continues to look at the cigar. “If a husband shoots his wife,” the professor continues, “they put him in jail . . .” Pause. The detective raises the cigar to his nose and smells it. End of scene. No one else in Hollywood would have put that detective in such a scene, or given him the kind of emphasis that Lubitsch does. What’s clear is that Lubitsch likes to surround his main characters—to “crowd” them in subtle ways—with minor figures of ominous reserve and opaqueness. Mitzi, for example, has a lady’s maid (Barbara Leonard), a pretty blonde. This character has no name and practically no lines, but she is on the screen with Mitzi during all the latter’s scenes at home. (Genevieve Tobin and Roland Young, on the other hand, are seen in the same shot only once—and even that occasion they share with a very nervous Chevalier, placed significantly between them.) Mitzi is a small, deli¬ cate, birdlike woman. Her maid is tall, big-framed, blank-looking. When she is seeing her mistress to the door, walking behind her deferentially, she is as faceless and withdrawing as a servant (slightly taller) could be. And, of course, we are intensely aware of her as a result. And whenever she is called upon (not often) actually to speak or to respond in some way, she and her mistress turn out to be at hopeless cross-purposes. Mitzi gives her the night off—to get rid of her—and she declines. Mitzi feigns an illness so that Doctor Chevalier might be called—and the maid rushes to her side instead of to the phone. It’s Mitzi who loses her composure at these moments, berating and shouting at the uncom¬ prehending girl. But when, near the end of the film, the professor finally watches his detested wife leaving for good—in a long parade of opulent baggage to a waiting car out front—he shares the window with the maid. They are side by side, leaning on their elbows, watching Mitzi go, and they are smiling—to¬ gether—the same thin smile. It’s in a supporting character like Adolphe (Charles Ruggles) that we can most easily see what Lubitsch owed to the Raphaelson collaboration. Adolphe is the standard absurd Other Man figure—hopelessly pursuing MacDonald as the heroine, Colette—but with wonderful, surprising details within the familiar out¬ lines. Adolphe is a dyspeptic-looking man, who dresses up as Romeo and then calls Colette on the phone: “What? What? . . . Not a costume party?” he gasps—and Lubitsch promptly shows him in a full-length shot, holding the tele¬ phone and looking distressed in tights and ruffles. Adolphe is always trying to make urgent love to Colette. Clearly he thinks of himself as out of control; but an odd prudential streak is always intruding itself, even at moments of extremest\n\nLUBITSCH: THE NAUGHTY OPERETTA passion. “Let’s run away!\" he says desperately—then adds, fervently, “You’re still a young woman.\" Though, of course, she\n\ncould be younger, he keeps seem¬\n\ning to feel—and that notion keeps cropping up gracelessly: he seems helpless to resist it. Colette at one point tries to send him away by pleading her own sadness of heart, and he tells her that sorrow only makes her “more beautiful . . . more feminine . .\n\nHe hesitates here, but he really can’t stop himself:\n\n“. . . Younger,\" he concludes unhappily. Colette, though, unlike us, never really hears any of this. She is always pre¬ occupied when she is with Adolphe. And their relationship occasions some of Lubitsch’s best solipsist joking. Colette and Adolphe are on the terrace over¬ looking the garden. She is out there looking worriedly for her husband Andre (she has good reason to be worried: he is in the garden with Mitzi). And Adolphe is by her side, making his usual ardent love to her—praising the moonlight in this case. “I tell you,\" he says, “if I didn’t have such a splendid education I’d yield to the animal in me” and he makes a little face (he always does after an emotional outburst). At this last remark MacDonald turns, touches her throat, and gives him her best look of burning-eyed incomprehension—as if he had just made some hard-to-identify but possibly crucial sound. Presently she turns, lifts her skirt, and steps onto the gravel path below. The camera tracks slowly before them as they walk: MacDonald looking agitatedly about her, and Ruggles con¬ tinuing in the same vein of thoughtful absurdity: “Colette, how does the moon affect you?’’ No answer. “It turns me inside out and upside down. . . . Yes, yes, I admit I come from a very refined family. But should a refined gentleman not have any luck? . . . Does one have to be a roughneck to get along in this world?” At this (the timing is very precise) they both stop, both looking in the same rightward direction—the first sign of union in the scene, and quite accidental. Pause—whereupon Colette utters her first words. “I wonder where Andre is,” she says—and walks off, leaving Ruggles startled and alone on the screen. The Lubitsch epiphany: alone on the screen, ditched and discomfited. In other movies, actors command the screen when they’re alone on it; in Lubitsch, they are stranded there.\n\nA\n\nSTRANGE footnote to this period in the Lubitsch career is the fact that the\n\nChevalier-MacDonald movie which probably most people think of as the pinnacle of the Lubitsch style, is not by Lubitsch but by Rouben Mamoulian, that most eclectic of gifted thirties directors:\n\nLove Me Tonight (1932). “The Lu¬\n\nbitsch film that Lubitsch was always trying to pull off but never quite did,\" says critic Tom Milne. This time MacDonald is the Princess Jeanette, pining away in a countryside castle in France. Chevalier is Maurice, a tailor from Paris, who is trying to collect some overdue bills from the princess’s spendthrift cousin, the\n\n31\n\n32\n\nTHE LUBITSCH ERA, 1929-1933 vicomte (Charles Ruggles again). So that he can visit the castle without exposing the vicomte’s impecuniousness, Maurice pretends to be a baron. Princess Jean¬ ette suffers from fainting spells, and everyone in the castle is concerned about her, especially when she is brought to ground just after meeting Maurice in the woods. The doctor is called. He asks the princess to undress, and she does so. He learns during his examination that she is a widow.

He leaves the castle in disgrace. Jeanette, at first shocked and angry, then bereft and lovelorn, mounts her horse and rides after his train. She brings it to a halt by standing astride the tracks: a Valkyrie with a riding crop. “I love him,” she cries in explanation. “That’s not a railroad problem,” replies the engineer. But Maurice gets off the train, and they embrace in a cloud of steam. Love Me Tonight really does deserve its reputation. The screenplay (by Samuel Hoffenstein, Waldemar Young, and George Marion, Jr. ) sustains its wit and fan¬ tasy better than any of the Lubitsch-directed films do. And the Rodgers and Hart score is one of the glories of thirties musicals. Even the supporting cast— Ruggles, Charles Butterworth, C. Aubrey Smith, and, best of all, Myrna Loy, playing a sexually insatiable countess—comes close to outdoing Lubitsch. But similar to Lubitsch as the Mamoulian film seems (Mamoulian even reproduces some of Lubitsch’s effects of delayed cutting and off-screen surprise), the com¬ parison is still misleading. The spirit behind Love Me Tonight is very different from Lubitsch’s. It is not the film “that Lubitsch was always trying to pull off.' That film is The Merry Widow, still two years away. Love Me Tonight, in the meantime, doesn’t even come close. The Lubitsch films preceding it, even The Love Parade, are chamber films, essentially small-scale and intimate. Love Me Tonight is a kind of bravura effu¬ sion. That bravura element runs through all of Mamoulian’s films, different as they may be in other respects: from Applause (1929) to High, Wide and Hand¬ some (1937), from Blood and Sand (1941) to Summer Holiday (1948). Mamou¬ lian is a spectacularist; Lubitsch, the erstwhile “Griffith of Europe,' is not. The “symphony” of Parisian street sounds that opens Love Me Tonight is a fair sample of the Mamoulian “touch.” (He had used the same device in his Broadway pro¬ duction of DuBose Heyward’s Porgy in 1927, and then repeated it in his 1935 production of Gershwin’s Porgy and Bess.) An even more dazzling instance is the way, near the film’s end, he expands and orchestrates the castle’s shock at finding out who the Baron Maurice really “is”—through a witty Lorenz Hart song lyric (“The Son of a Gun Is Nothing But a Tailor”) and a montage in which each echelon of the serving staff absorbs the appalling revelation, from the valet (“To think 1 pressed his coat and vest / When he’s the one who could press the best”) to the chambermaid (“I used to flirt until it hurt / While he stood there in his undershirt ”) and on downwards. This number—surely one of the great extended “reaction shots” of film his¬ tory— has a largeness and sweep that characterize the whole film. And that use of a montage to open out a song and situation is a favorite Mamoulian device. When Maurice first comes to the castle, Mamoulian shows each of the principals waking the next day and singing an appropriate verse of “Muni\n\n(C. Aubrey\n\nSmith leads the sequence off), as a way to show Chevalier’s enlivening effect on\n\n34\n\nTHE LUBITSCH ERA, 1929-1933 the place. Best of all, perhaps, is the early introduction of “Isn’t It Romantic?”: Chevalier sings it in the morning in his tailor shop, and it travels through various unlikely groups—Parisian cabbies, soldiers on maneuver, gypsies by a camp¬ fire—until it reaches the Princess Jeanette languishing in the moonlight on her castle balcony. Mamoulian’s impulse toward this “integrated musical” style (as he calls it in interviews)—his impulse to expand his effects and then pull them together in showy and virtuosic ways—has almost no echo in Lubitsch’s method and temperament. The distance between the two directors’ styles is suggested by the different forms they give to the MacDonald heroine’s “problem” in Love Me Tonight and in Monte Carlo: the distance, respectively, between the images of a fainting spell (a cry and a graceful arc to the floor) and a tension headache (a line in the forehead and a general irritability). While Love Me Tonight is too much in the Lubitsch mode to be described as warmhearted, it does verge on a kind of fairy-tale sweetness, to a greater degree than Lubitsch with similar material was ever in danger of. It was just this aspect of the original story idea—“a kind of fairy-tale romantic magic”—that Mamoulian has said he was attracted by, when Adolph Zukor asked him to do the film as a way of keeping the two salaried stars working profitably (Lubitsch was oc¬ cupied with Trouble in Paradise at the time). Love Me Tonight is a marvelously funny him, and nearly as enchanting as it is meant to be. And for all its dryness, it never risks being disagreeable or discordant—as Lubitsch, in spite of his resolve to be lighter than air, so often does. And yet it is partly this same risk that makes Lubitsch seem difficult and even mysterious and finally more consid¬ erable, where Mamoulian’s him seems, by comparison at least, rather easily triumphant. Both at his best and at his worst, Lubitsch is closer to danger.\n\nLubitsch: A \"Serious” Film\n\nT\n\nhe Man I Killed (1932) gives some idea of that danger. It’s Lubitsch’s only “serious” film of the sound period, and in relation to his work in general it\n\nis one of the most revelatory films he ever made. It was a commercial disaster, and thus became a turning point in his career. He never again risked the kind of ambition it showed: the moral centrality, the direct appeal to the conscience of his audience, the recognizable “importance” in both subject and style. When it opened, Robert E. Sherwood, speaking for middlebrow seriousness, called it “the best talking picture that has yet been seen and heard.’\n\nWhile Dwight\n\nMacDonald predictably—writing for an arts journal called The Symposium— took an opposite line, dismissing it as “a Teutonic tearjerker.” Samson Raphaelson recalled in 1978 that he worked on the screenplay with some feelings of aversion (“The whole thing gave me the creeps, in fact”), which apparently were not shared by Lubitsch. The Man I Killed is a monstrous, miscalculated, fasci¬ nating film. In fact it gives everyone the creeps—at least everyone who feels its power to any degree. And its relation to the comedies is deep and illuminating. No doubt Lubitsch expected not only to extend his range with this film but to enhance his reputation. It’s the first interruption in the cycle of operetta films (and the film he did right after it was another operetta, One Hour with You). At the time, probably no mode of seriousness was more generally available to au¬ diences and artists of “good will” than the antiwar drama. The source play, by Maurice Rostand (son of Edmond, author of Cyrano), is in a debased Ibsenite tradition: the well-made play of social protest, with lots of carefully crafted re¬ versals and ironies and an air of urgent self-consequence throughout. These qualities remain in the film: they even have something to do with its power. Lubitsch begins with a montage: Armistice Day, 1919. Celebration: a parade framed between an amputee’s stump and his crutch. Bells, and a long, slow tracking shot past beds full of wounded. A priest in his pulpit offers thanks for peace, and the camera tracks past rows of glittering sabers as the officers kneel\n\nPhillips Holmes in Lubitsch's The Man I Killed.\n\nin prayer. After the service a young man (Phillips Holmes) goes to confession and tells the appalled old priest (Frank Sheridan) that he has killed a man. In the war. We see the event in a flashback: the Frenchman Paul bayonets a young German who has leaped into his trench—then finds and reads an unfinished letter the German had written to his girl. The priest is relieved: Is that all? he says. “You are free from crime. You have done nothing but your duty.” But this assurance only makes Paul more distraught and desperate: he no longer believes in duty. The priest has an inspiration. Perhaps Paul can find some help for his anguish by going to the dead man’s home and family, by finding some way to make a personal reparation to them. Paul sees hope in this. “God is with you,” says the priest. And so Paul arrives in Walter Holderlin’s home town, a small German village, where, being a Frenchman, he is met with suspicion and hostility. Not, however, from the family he has come to visit: Doctor Holderlin and his wife (Lionel Barrymore and Louise Carter) are happy with anyone who brings news of their dead only son, and Paul pretends to have known Walter in prewar Paris. But as\n\nLU B1TSCH : A “SERIOUS” FILM time goes on, he is unable to tell the Holderlins or Walter’s fiancee, Elsa (Nancy Carroll), who he really is. But Elsa and he fall in love, and she discovers the truth. She prevents him, however, from telling it to the Holderlins: he has begun to replace Walter in their hearts, and for their sake, she tells him, he must go on replacing him. The “family” gathers in the parlor. Doctor Holderlin produces Walter’s violin, their dearest relic of him, and hands it to Paul—who draws back in horror. “Don’t be afraid to make us happy,” says the elder Holderlin. Paul takes it—and plays it. While Walter’s fiancee accompanies him on the piano, and Walter’s parents beam at him from the couch. A son has come home to them. Samson Raphaelson in 1978 remembered the excitement of writing this last scene: he and Lubitsch together “riding high on the sheer corniness of the whole thing.” But there was a problem, nonetheless, with the new “son’s” final closeup, though the problem didn’t emerge until shooting was completed.
