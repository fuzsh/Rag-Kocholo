Manager Bill McKechnie's team finished third in the National League with a record of 89–65, a full 16 games behind the St. Louis Cardinals. On June 10 of this season, Joe Nuxhall made his major league debut. At age 15, he is the youngest confirmed player ever to play Major League Baseball. He pitched just two-thirds of an inning, giving up 5 runs on 2 hits and 5 walks. He would not appear in the majors again until 1952.\n\nFrank McCormick (.305 avg with a .853 ops while slugging 20 Home Runs and driving in 102) headed up the batting attack, while on the mound 35-year-old Bucky Walters (23-8 with a 2.40 ERA in 285 Innings) regained his position as Ace of the staff while leading the NL in Wins. Notable among those supporting him was a Rookie named Jim Konstanty (6-4 with a 2.80 ERA in a half season of work) who would go on to great fame for the Phillies down the road...\n\n1944 Detroit Tigers - from Master Season Set with Roster, CMBA Pitching Ratings, and Player Stats inside envelope ... Manager Steve O'Neill's team finished second in the American League with a record of 88–66, just one game behind the first place St. Louis Browns.\n\nDick Wakefield (.355 avg with a 1.040 ops), Baseball's first ever \"Bonus Baby\", returned from teh War at mid-season to spark the Tigers offense, which was pretty much just Pinky Higgins (.801 ops) and Rudy York (.792 ops) at that point.\n\nOn the mound dual Ace's Dizzy Trout (27-12 with a league leading 2.12 ERA in also a league leading 352+ Innings. Two other categories he paced the AL in were Complete Games with 33, and Shutouts with 7) and Hal Newhouser (29-9 with a 2.22 ERA in 312+ Innings, leading the league in Wins, the first of three consecutive and four overall times he would do so, and with 187 Strikeouts) had the type of season franchises can only dream of receiving...\n\n1944 New York Yankees - from Master Season Set with Roster, CMBA Pitching Ratings, and Player Stats inside envelope ... Manager Joe McCarthy's team finished in third place in the American League with a record of 83–71, finishing 6 games behind the St. Louis Browns.\n\nSnuffy Stirnweiss (.319 avg with a .849 ops, he led the AL with 205 Hits, 125 Runs, 16 Triples, and 55 Stolen Bases) exploded into a star in his first full season to lead the offense. Right there with him was Johnny Lindell (.300 avg with a .851 ops while leading the AL with 297 Total Bases) and Nick Etten (.293 avg with a .399 on-base and .865 ops) who lead the AL in Home Runs with 22.\n\nThe mound staff was paced by Ace Hank Borowy (17-12 with a 2.64 ERA) and Tiny Bonham (12-9 with a 2.99 ERA)...\n\n1944 Pittsburgh Pirates - from Master Season Set with Roster, CMBA Pitching Ratings, and Team & Player Stats inside envelope ... Manager Frankie Frisch's Pirates squad finished second in the league standings with a record of 90–63, still 14.5 behind the St. Louis Cardinals though.\n\nBob Elliot (.848 ops) and Jim Russell (.859) led the hitters, while on the mound Ace Rip Sewell (21-12 with a 3.18 ERA) had his second consecutive great season. One of those helping him out was 28-year-old Rookie Preacher Roe (13-11 with a 3.11 ERA) who would go on to do some great things for the Dodgers down the road...\n\n1944 St. Louis Browns - from Master Season Set with Roster, CMBA Pitching Ratings, and Player Stats inside envelope ... Manager Luke Sewell's Browns team finished first in the American League with a record of 89-65, one game better than the Detroit Tigers. In the World Series, they lost to the team they shared a stadium with, the Cardinals, four games to two.\n\nThe Browns were one of the unlikeliest pennant-winners in history; in nine out of the previous 10 seasons, they had finished in the second division. However, 1944 was the peak of wartime baseball. The shortage of players dragged the talent level of the entire league down, which benefitted the team. In 1944 the Browns were relatively untouched by the military draft. Nine players on the roster were 34 years old or older. Their all-4F infield included 23-year-old shortstop Vern Stephens, who led the league in RBI (109) and was second in home runs (20). St. Louis started the season with nine straight wins and continued to hang tough in a four-team race with Detroit, Boston, and New York. It came down to the final week, when the Browns defeated the Yankees five times, winning the pennant by 1 game over Detroit. It would be the only championship the franchise would ever win in St. Louis.\n\nTheir two main mound stars were Ace Jack Kramer (17-13 with a 2.49 ERA in 257 Innings), who seemed to come from out of nowhere in a breakout season, and Nels Potter (19-7 with a 2.83 ERA in 232 Innings). Coming out of the Bullpen to do great relief work for the club was 36-year-old George Caster (6-6 with a 2.44 ERA) who lead the AL with 12 Saves and completed 34 of the 42 games he appeared in...\n\n1944 St. Louis Browns - from GTP Series with CMBA Pitching Ratings, MG Symbols, Roster,\n\n...[Message truncated]\n\n1945\n\n1945 Brooklyn Dodgers - from 1945RR Season Set with CMBA Pitching Ratings, MG Symbols, Roster and Player Stats inside envelope ... Manager Leo Durocher's Dodgers finished 11 games back in third place in the National League race with a record of 87-67.\n\nLeadoff Hitter Eddie Stanky hit only .258 but led the NL in Runs Scored with 128 thanks to his then record setting total of 148 Walks that gave him a .417 On-Base Percentage. That didn't even lead the team though as veteran Augie Galan (.307 with a .864 ops) posted a .423 On-Base. Brooklyn's entire starting outfield hit over .300 on the season as Dixie Walker (.300 avg with an .820 ops and league leading 124 RBI's), Luis Olmo (.313 avg with a .818 ops and 110 RBI's), and Goody Rosen (.325 avg with a .840 ops and 126 Runs Scored) all had excellent seasons.\n\nOn the mound, Ace Hal Gregg (18-13 with a 3.47 ERA but a league high 120 Walks) led the way, while 19-year-old Ralph Branca (5-6 with a 3.04 ERA in only 15 starts) was very wild but showed he had a good career ahead of him once he could curb his wildness...\n\n1945 Chicago Cubs - from 1945RR Season Set with CMBA Pitching Ratings, MG Symbols, Roster and Player Stats inside envelope ... Manager Charlie Grimm's Cubs won the National League pennant with a record of 98–56, 3 games ahead of the second-place St. Louis Cardinals. The team went on to the 1945 World Series, which they lost to the Detroit Tigers in seven games. It would take 71 years before the Cubs made it to another World Series.\n\nPhil Cavarretta (.949 ops) won the NL Batting Crown with a .355 Average, and also led the circuit with a .449 On-Base Percentage and was rewarded with being named the NL's MVP for doing so. His biggest supporters at the plate were Stan Hack (.323 avg with a .826 ops) and Andy Pafko (.298 with a .816 ops).\n\nThe Pitching Staff led this team with Ace Hank Wyse (22-10 with a 2.68 ERA in 278+ Innings) topping the mound work. A quartet of veterans supported him in Clause Passeau (17-9 with a 2.46 ERA), Paul Derringer (16-11 with a 3.45 ERA), Ray Prim (13-8 with a 2.40 ERA), and Hank Borowy (11-2 with a 2.13 ERA in only 14 Starts)...\n\n1945 Detroit Tigers - from 1945RR Season Set with CMBA Pitching Ratings, MG Symbols, Roster, Player Stats, and 1971 Fleer R.G. Laughlin World Series Set Card inside envelope ... Manager Steve O'Neill's team won the American League pennant with a record of 88-65, a mere 1.5 games ahead of Washington. They then went on to win the 1945 World Series, defeating the Chicago Cubs 4 games to 3. It was the second World Series championship ever for the Tigers.\n\nHank Greenberg (.311 avg with a .948 ops in only 78 games) returned from the war in July after having missed four seasons to military service. Greenberg, at age 34, picked up where he left off, hitting a home run in his first game. Without the benefit of spring training, he returned to the Tigers, was again voted to the All-Star Team, and hit a dramatic pennant-clinching grand slam home run in the 9th inning on the last day of the regular season. He also set a major league record with 11 multi-homer games in 1945. Hank's biggest supporters at the plate were Roy Cullenbine (.277 avg but with a league leading 102 Walks to give him a .398 On-Base. He had a .849 ops and drove in a team high 93 runs) and Rudy York (18 home runs and 87 rbi's).\n\nAce pitcher Hal Newhouser (25-9 with a 1.81 ERA in 313+ Innings, all league leading numbers, as were is 29 Complete Games, 8 Shutouts, and 212 Strikeouts) was named the American League's Most Valuable Player for the second consecutive season. Dizzy Trout (18-15 with a 3.14 ERA) and Al Benton (13-8 with a 2.02 ERA) each had fine season for the club as well...\n\n1945 St. Louis Cardinals - from 1945RR Season Set with CMBA Pitching Ratings, MG Symbols, Roster and Player Stats inside envelope ... Manager Billy Southworth's Cardinals went 95–59 during the season and finished 2nd in the National League, only 3 games back of the Cubs. St. Louis had a chance to become only the second ball club after the 1921-24 Giants to win four consecutive NL pennants. However, the war finally drained the Redbirds of the talent needed to win a championship. Of note though, the Cardinals set a Major League record which still stands, for the fewest double plays grounded into during a season, with only 75.\n\nWhitey Kurowski (.323 avg with a .894 ops) led the offense while slugging 21 Home Runs and driving in 102, numbers that were trailed by only one in each category by Buster Adams (.800 ops). A 22-year-old Rookie by the name of Red Schoendienst (.276 avg and a league high 26 Stolen Bases) started his Hall of Fame career this season.\n\nAn early season trade for Ace Red Barrett (21-9 with a 2.74 ERA for the Cardinals, and he led the NL with a total of 23 Wins) really boosted an already respectable staff that had Rookie Ken Burkhart (18-8 with a 2.90 ERA) and Harry Brecheen (15-4 with a 2.52 ERA) on it...\n\n1945 Washington Senators - from 1945RR Season Set with CMBA Pitching Ratings, MG Symbols, Roster and Player Stats inside envelope ... Manager Ossie Bluege's Senators went 87-67, and finished in second place in the American League, just 1.5 games back of the Detroit Tigers\n\n...[Message truncated]\n\n1946\n\n1946 Boston Red Sox - from 1946RR Season Set with CMBA Pitching Ratings, MG Symbols, Roster, Player Stats, and 1987 TCMA Greatest Baseball Teams Card Set inside envelope ... Manager Joe Cronin's Red Sox finished first in the AL with a record of 104-50, which was 12 ahead of their closest pursuer Detroit. This was the team's sixth AL championship, but their first since 1918. In the World Series, the Red Sox lost to the NL champion St. Louis Cardinals, whose winning run in the seventh game was scored on Enos Slaughter's famous \"Mad Dash\".\n\nBoston was led by their All-Star left fielder, Ted Williams (1.164 OPS), who was in his first year back in the majors after serving as a fighter pilot in World War II. 1946 was Ted Williams first of two MVP seasons, and the only time he ever won a pennant. He was among the league leaders in many offensive categories, with a batting average of .342, 38 home runs and 123 runs batted in. On July 14, after Williams hit three home runs and eight RBIs in the first game of a doubleheader, Lou Boudreau, inspired by Williams' consistent pull hitting to right field, created what would later be known as the Boudreau shift (also Williams shift) against Williams, having only one player on the left side of second base (the left fielder). Ignoring the shift, Williams walked twice, doubled, and grounded out to the shortstop, who was positioned in between first and second base. The Red Sox played a three-game series against an American League all-star team following the end of the regular season and the beginning of the World Series. While the Red Sox had clinched in September, the St Louis Cardinals and Brooklyn Dodgers would play a three-game playoff for the National League pennant, pushing back the start of the World Series. The Red Sox hosted the three game exhibition series beginning October 1, 1946, at Fenway Park. The Red Sox won two of three, but Williams injured elbow when hit by a pitch and though X-rays of his arm showed no damage, but his arm was \"swelled up like a boiled egg\", according to Williams. It would plague him in the Series against St. Louis.\n\nWhile Williams led the offense the mound work was headed by the big three of dual Aces Tex Hughson (20-11 with a 2.75 ERA in 278 Innings) and Dave Ferriss (25-6 with a 3.25 ERA in 274 Innings), and Mickey Harris (17-9 with a 3.64 ERA)...\n\n1946 Boston Red Sox - from GTP Series with CMBA Pitching Ratings, MG Symbols, Roster, Team & Player Stats, APBA Card Handbook Team Breakdown, and APBA Write Up inside envelope ... ...\n\n1946 Boston Red Sox - from ATG Volume Set ... ...\n\n1946 Brooklyn Dodgers - from 1946RR Season Set with CMBA Pitching Ratings, MG Symbols, Roster and Player Stats inside envelope ... Manager Leo Durocher's Dodgers finished the season tied for first place with the St. Louis Cardinals with identical 96-58 records. The two teams played in the first ever playoff series to decide the pennant, and the Cardinals took two straight to win the title. Notable was the fact that ith their star players back from the war, Brooklyn had jumped back into serious contention.\n\nNotable was the fact that this season was the team's – and Major League Baseball's – last non-integrated one. On October 23, 1945, the Dodgers had signed Jackie Robinson as a free agent. Robinson was the first black player to be officially a part of a major league organization in over 60 years, since the barring of Fleet and Welday Walker in 1884. For the 1946 season, Robinson was assigned to the Montreal Royals, the Dodgers' top farm team. Later in the offseason, the Dodgers signed two more players from the Negro leagues, Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe, who were assigned to the Nashua Dodgers.\n\nThe most potent bat in the lineup was Dixie Walker's (.319 avg with a .839 ops while driving in 116 runs), while it's sparkplug was Eddie Stanky who led the league in Walks (137) and On-Base Percentage (.436). THe Pitching Staff had no stars, but was a deep and consistent crew...\n\n1946 Detroit Tigers - from 1946RR Season Set with CMBA Pitching Ratings, MG Symbols, Roster and Player Stats inside envelope ... Manager Steve O'Neill's defending Champion Tigers finished the season with a record of 92–62, twelve games behind the Boston Red Sox.\n\nDetroit was led at the bat by first baseman Hank Greenberg (.977 OPS) who led the AL with 127 RBIs and led the major leagues with 44 home runs, and 23-year-old George Kell (.327 avg with a .811 ops) who developed into a star showing the swing that would win him a batting title in the future.\n\nOn the mound by Hal Newhouser (26-9 with a 1.94 ERA in 292+ Innings with 275 Strikeouts), who led the major leagues in Wins and ERA, and Dizzy Trout (17-13 with a 2.34 ERA in 276+ Innings)...\n\n1946 New York Yankees - from 1946RR Season Set with CMBA Pitching Ratings, MG Symbols, Roster and Player Stats inside envelope ... The team finished with a record of 87–67, finishing 17 games behind of the Boston Red Sox. On May 24, Joe McCarthy, who had managed the team since 1931 and led them to seven World Championships, resigned. Although he had b\n\n...[Message truncated]\n\n1947\n\n1947 Boston Braves - from Original Season Set with CMBA Pitching Ratings, MG Symbols, Roster, and Player Stats inside envelope ... Billy Southworth's Brave squad went 86-68 to finish in third place in the National League, 8 games behind Pennant Winner Brooklyn.\n\nBob Elliott (.317 avg with a .410 on-base and .927 ops while slugging 22 home runs and collecting 113 rbi's) led the offense and became the first third baseman in the history of the National League to win the MVP Award for his excellent season. Early Torgeson (.885 ops) and Tommy Holmes (.776 ops) gave Elliot the most help at the bat.\n\nDual Aces Warren Spahn (21-10 with a 2.33 ERA in 289+ Innings) and Johnny Sain (21-12 with a 3.52 ERA in 266 Innings) teamed up for the first time this season and were so far and away the best of the Boston Staff that they inspired the famous saying of \"Spahn and Sain and pray for rain!\"...\n\n1947 Boston Red Sox - from Original Season Set with CMBA Pitching Ratings, MG Symbols, Roster, and Player Stats inside envelope ... Manager Joe Cronin's Red Sox finished third in the American League with a record of 83-71, but 14 games back of the Yankees. 1947 was the year lights were added to Boston's home Fenway Park.\n\nTed Williams led the AL in Batting Average (.343), On-Base (.499), Slugging (.634), OPS (1.113), Total Bases (335) Runs Scored (125), Walks (162), Home Runs (32), and RBI's (114) in an amazingly dominant season to lead the offense while winning the Triple Crown for the second time.

On April 15, Jackie Robinson was the opening day first baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers, becoming the first black player in Major League Baseball. Robinson went on to bat .297, score 125 runs, steal 29 bases and be named the very first African-American Rookie of the Year.\n\nDue to the suspension of Leo Durocher for a year for \"conduct detrimental to baseball\", coach Clyde Sukeforth managed the first 2 games of the season on an emergency basis, but declined to manage for the full season, so Burt Shotton took over as manager for the rest of the season. The Dodgers won the National League title with a 94-60 record and went on to lose to the New York Yankees in the 1947 World Series.\n\nBeyond Robinson's historic efforts the player who made the biggest splash was 21-year-old starting pitcher Ralph Branca (21-12 with a 2.67 ERA in 280 Innings) who became an All-Star in his first full season. Veteran Hugh Casey (10-4 with a league leading 18 Saves, he also Finished 37 Games) shinned out of the Bullpen.\n\nOf note was the appearance on the scene of another couple of Rookies in 20-year-old Outfielder Duke Snider and 23-year-old Catcher Gil Hodges.

They played the Brooklyn Dodgers in the World Series, winning a close-fought seven-game series that featured memorable moments like Cookie Lavagetto's walk-off double in game 4 and Al Gionfriddo's famous catch that robbed Joe DiMaggio of a potential home run.\n\nDiMaggio (.913 OPS) was the heart and soul of the team and won the AL MVP Award. With Charlie Keller (.954 OPS) being limited to barely a quarter a season due to an ailing back, veteran Tommy Henrich (.857 OPS) turned back into the feared hitter he was in his youth to give Joltin' Joe help.

The Dodgers finished third in the National League after this tumultuous season with a record of 84-70, which was 7.5 off the pace set by Boston.\n\nJackie Robinson (.820 ops) was moved to his natural position at second base and thrived with SS Pee Wee Reese (.753) in the field while leading the team at the bat.

With a record of 97-58, Cleveland won one of the toughest pennant races in baseball history by defeating the Boston Red Sox in a one-game playoff. The Indians also finished the regular season with a 2.5-game lead over third place New York.\n\nAL MVP and future Hall of Fame shortstop Lou Boudreau hit .355/.453/.534 with 18 home runs, 106 RBI and 109 runs scored, and was the centerpiece of one of the best hitting infields in baseball history. Second baseman Joe Gordon (32 HR, 124 RBI, 96 R) and third baseman Ken Keltner (31 HR, 119 RBI, 91 R) also received MVP votes, as did Hall of Fame outfielder Larry Doby (.301/.384/.490, 14 HR, 66 RBI).\n\nHall of Fame starters Bob Lemon (20-14, 2.82 ERA) and Bob Feller (19-15, 3.56) were the stars of the AL’s best pitching staff, which led the league in ERA (3.22), shutouts (23), saves (30), and allowed the fewest hits as well (1,246).

Following their 1948 World Series championship, the 1949 Indians season proved to be a disappointment. Despite having the best overall pitching and fielding statistics in either the American or National Leagues, the Indians finished a distant third place behind the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox. A team roster that boasted seven future members of the Baseball Hall of Fame (Lou Boudreau, Larry Doby, Bob Feller, Joe Gordon, Bob Lemon, Satchel Paige, & Early Wynn) could not deliver a second consecutive championship to Cleveland. During the season, Indians fan Charlie Lupica spent 117 days on a flagpole, waiting for the Indians to regain first place. They never did, and he gave up his pursuit when the Indians were mathematically eliminated on September 25.\n\nLarry Doby (.857 ops with 24 home runs) was the best bat in the lineup which was deep and balanced, just not overly dynamic. Player Manager Lou Boudreau (.745) fell off last year’s numbers for instance, though new addition Mickey Vernon (18 home runs and a .801 ops) was a plus.\n\nThe Pitching Staff received excellent performances from Starters Bob Feller (15-14 with a 3.75 ERA) and Ace Bob Lemon (22-10 with a 2.99 ERA in 279+ Innings), and Swingmen Mike Garcia (14-5 with a 2.36 ERA), Al Benton (9-6 with 10 Saves and a 2.12 ERA), and timeless 42-year-old Satchel Paige (4-7 with a 3.04 ERA)...\n\n1949 Cleveland Indians - from 1949RR Season Set with CMBA Pitching Ratings, MG Symbols, Roster and Player Stats inside envelope ... ...\n\n1949 Detroit Tigers - from Original Season Set with XB's, CMBA Pitching Ratings, MG Symbols, Roster, and Player Stats inside envelope ...

The team scored 1,027 runs, one of only six teams to score more than 1,000 runs in a season in the modern era (post-1900), and, along with the 1999 Cleveland Indians, are one of two teams to do so post-World War II. This was the last time that the Red Sox would win at least 90 games until their return to the World Series in 1967.\n\n\"The Splendid Splinter\" Ted Williams (1.099) of course led the offense, but he was limited to just over half a season this year after seriously breaking arm in the All-Star Game.

Buzzie Bavasi was also hired as the team's first independent General Manager.\n\nOf special note this season was that Vin Scully joined the Dodgers' radio and television crew as a play-by-play announcer in 1950. He spent 67 seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers, starting in 1950 (when the franchise was located in Brooklyn) and ending in 2016. His run constitutes the longest tenure of any broadcaster with a single team in professional sports history, and he is second only to Tommy Lasorda (by two years) in terms of number of years associated with the Dodgers organization in any capacity. He retired at age 88 in 2016, ending his record-breaking run as their play-by-play announcer. He is known for his dulcet voice, lyrically descriptive style, and signature introduction to Dodger games: \"It's time for Dodger baseball!
