        "text": "After reading Rosterman's articles about where they are now players, I was inspired to create this article about the minors and some of it's history. I think this stuff is pretty fascinating and at times I geek out about learning about it. Would I have shamelessly \"re-appropriated\" much of this material from elsewhere if the league wasn't in a self-induced coma? Possibly not, but either way I still love to share things I find out and learn about the greatest game on the face of the earth.\n\nSo proceed on dear traveler and be forewarned, for here be dragons (ok that miiiight be a huge stretch but you can't blame a guy for warning you this might be a little dry for some folks )\n\nAn Overview and Brief History of the Minor Leagues\n\nThe earliest professional baseball league, the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players of 1871 to 1875, commonly referred to as the National Association, comprised all fully professional teams. This system proved unworkable, however, as there was no way to ensure competitive balance, and financially unsound clubs often failed in midseason. This problem was solved in 1876 with the formation of the National League (NL), with a limited membership which excluded less competitive and financially weaker teams. Professional clubs outside the NL responded by forming regional associations of their own. There was a series of ad hoc groupings, such as the New England Association of 1877 and the Eastern Championship Association of 1881. These were loose groups of independent clubs which agreed to play a series of games over the course of one season for a championship pennant.\n\nThe first true minor league is traditionally considered to be theNorthwestern League of 1883 to 1884. Unlike the earlier minor associations, it was conceived as a permanent organization. It also, along with the NL and the American Association (AA), was a party to the National Agreement of 1883. Included in this was the agreement to respect the reserve lists of clubs in each league. Teams in the NL and the AA could only reserve players who had been paid at least $1,000. Northwest League teams could reserve players paid $750, implicitly establishing the division into major and minor leagues. Over the next two decades, more minor leagues signed various versions of the National Agreement. Eventually, the minor leagues joined to negotiate jointly.\n\nIn the late 1890s, theWestern League run byBan Johnson decided to challenge the NL's position. In 1900, he changed the name of the league to theAmerican League (AL) and vowed to make deals to sign contracts with players who were dissatisfied with the pay and terms of their deals with the NL. This led to a turf war that heated up in 1901 enough to concernPatrick T. Powers, president of the Eastern League, and many other minor league owners about the conflict potentially affecting their organizations. Representatives of the different minor leagues met at the Leland Hotel inChicago on September 5, 1901. In response to the NL–AL battle, they agreed to form the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (NAPBL), sometimes shortened to National Association (NA), which would later adopt the trade name \"Minor League Baseball\". The purpose of the NAPBL at the time was to maintain the independence of the leagues involved. Several did not sign the agreement and continued to work independently. Powers was made the first president of the NAPBL, whose offices were established in Auburn, New York.\n\nIn 1903, the conflict between the AL and NL ended in the National Agreement of 1903. The NAPBL became involved in the later stages of the negotiations to develop rules for the acquisition of players from their leagues by the NL and the AL. The 1903 agreement ensured that teams would be compensated for the players that they had taken the time and effort to scout and develop, and no NA team was required to sell their players, although most did because the cash was an important source of revenue for most teams. The NA leagues were still fiercely independent, and the term minor was seldom used in reference to them, save by the major-market sportswriters. Sports news, like most news generally, often did not travel far in the days before radio and television, so, while the leagues often bristled at the major market writers' descriptions, they viewed themselves as independent sports businesses. Many baseball writers of that time regarded the greatest players of the minor leagues, such as Buzz Arlett, Jigger Statz, Ike Boone, Buddy Ryan, Earl Rapp and Frank Shellenback, as comparable to major league players. Leagues in the NA would not be truly called minor until Branch Rickey developed the first modern farm system in the 1930s. The Commissioner of Baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis fought Rickey's scheme, but, ultimately, the Great Depression drove teams to establish systems like Rickey's to ensure a steady supply of players, as many NA and independent teams could not afford to keep their doors open without the patronage of Major League Baseball. The leagues of the NA became subordinate to the major leagues, creating the first minor leagues in the current sense of the term. Other than the Pacific Coast League (PCL), which under its president Pants Rowland tried to become a third major league in the Western states, the other leagues maintained autonomy in name only, being totally economically dependent upon the AL and NL.\n\nIn 1922, the United States Supreme Court decision Federal Baseball Club v. National League (259 U.S. 200), which grants baseball a special immunity from antitrust laws, had a major effect on the minor leagues. The special immunity meant that the AL and NL could dictate terms under which every independent league did business. By 1925, major league baseball established a flat-fee purchase amount of $5,000 for the contract of any player from an NA member league team. This power was leveled primarily at the Baltimore Orioles, then a Triple-A team that had dominated the minors with stars.\n\nClassification history\n\n19th century\n\nThe earliest classifications used in the minor leagues began circa 1890, for teams that were party to the National Agreement of 1883. The different levels represented different levels of protection for player contracts and reserve clauses:\n\nClass A: contracts and reserve lists protected\n\nClass B: contracts and reserve lists protected, but a major league team could draft a player for a set price\n\nClass ? contracts protected\n\nClass ? contracts protected, but any higher class could draft a player for a set price\n\nClass E/F: no protection\n\n20th century\n\nAfter the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues was founded in 1901, classifications were redefined:\n\nClass Aggregate population of\n\ncities in the league Salary cap\n\n(per month)\n\nteam / player Draft fee Protection fee Class A more than 1 million $1800 / $175 n/a $50 Class B 400,001 to 1 million $1000 / $125 $300 $30 Class C 200,001 to 400,000 $800 / $100 $200 $20 Class D up to 200,000 $700 / $75 $100 $10\n\nDraft fee set an amount for a team in a higher class to select a player; n/a for Class A as it would be up to each team to negotiate with an interested major league club.\n\nProtection fee reserved a player to a team, even after a contract expired, preventing the player for seeking employment with any other team.\n\nAll minor leagues were classified, and had the following assignments entering the 1902 season:\n\nClass A:Eastern League,Western League\n\nClass B:Connecticut State League,New England League,New York State League,Pacific Northwest League,Southern League,Three-I League\n\nClass ?no league until 1903\n\nClass ?Cotton States League,Iowa–South Dakota League,Missouri Valley League,North Carolina League,Pennsylvania State League,Texas League\n\nAdditional classifications added prior to World War II were:[11]: 15–16\n\nClass AA (\"Double-A\"): added in 1912 as the new highest level.[15] Double-A remained the highest level through 1945.\n\nClass A1: added in 1936, between Class A and Class AA.[16] Two Class A circuits, the Texas League and theSouthern Association, were upgraded to A1 to signify their continued status as one step below the highest classification, then Double-A, and a notch above their former Class A peers, theNew York–Pennsylvania League andWestern League.[16] Class A1 remained in use through 1945.\n\nClass E: added in 1937, as the new lowest level, for players with no professional experience in Class D or higher.[16] The only Class E league that existed was the four-teamTwin Ports League, which operated for less than a full season in 1943.[16]\n\nPostwar changes\n\nIn 1946, with the minor leagues poised for unprecedented growth, the higher-level classifications were changed. Class AAA (\"Triple-A\") was created and the three Double-A circuits (the Pacific Coast League, International League, and the American Association) were reclassified into Triple-A. Class A1 (comprising the Texas League, which had last operated in 1942, and the Southern Association) became Class AA. Class A remained the third-highest classification, with lower levels still ranked Class B through Class D in descending order, with Class D being the equivalent of later Rookie leagues. The impact of the Korean War in 1950 caused a player shortage in many cities below Class B.\n\nIn 1952, the \"Open\" classification was created.[17] ThePacific Coast League (PCL), which had been rated Triple-A since 1946, was the only minor league to obtain this classification, which it held through 1957. At this time, the major leagues only extended as far west as St. Louis, Missouri, and as far south as Washington, D.C. This classification severely restricted the rights of the major leagues to draft players out of the PCL, and at the time it seemed like the PCL would eventually become a third major league. The PCL would revert to Triple-A in 1958, due to increasing television coverage of major league games and in light of the Dodgers and Giants moving to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively.\n\nReorganization of 1963\n\nA significant reorganization of the minor leagues took place in 1963, caused by the contraction of clubs and leagues during the 1950s and early 1960s. In 1949, the peak of the postwar minor league baseball boom, 448 teams in 59 leagues were members of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, with the number of teams falling to 324 in 1952, and 243 in 1955. By the end of 1963, only 15 leagues above Rookie-level survived in the United States and Canada.\n\nAfter the 1962 season, the Triple-A American Association—which had lost key markets such as Milwaukee, Kansas City, Minneapolis–Saint Paul and Houston to the Major Leagues since 1953—disbanded. The surviving International and Pacific Coast leagues absorbed the four remaining American Association franchises. Meanwhile, at the Double-A level and below there were even more significant changes:\n\nThe two existing Class A circuits—the Eastern League andSouth Atlantic League—were upgraded to Double-A, joining the Texas League and the unaffiliatedMexican League, then Double-A, as members of this classification. This move was caused by the disbanding of the Southern Association after 1961, leaving the six-team Texas League as the only US-based Double-A circuit in 1962. In addition, many Major League parent teams had frequently treated the pre-1963 Eastern League and South Atlantic League asde facto Double-A circuits, one step (rather than two) below Triple-A.\n\nThe Class BCarolina League andNorthwest League, the Class CCalifornia League,Pioneer League andNorthern League, and the Class DFlorida State League,Georgia–Florida League,Midwest League,New York–Penn League, andWestern Carolinas League were all designated Class A leagues. The unaffiliated Class CMexican Central League was also designated as Class A.\n\nThe Class DAppalachian League, then the only \"short-season\" circuit, was given a new designation as a Rookie league.\n\nDesignations below Class A disappeared because the lower levels could not sustain operation during a large downturn in the financial fortunes of minor league baseball, due to factors including the rise of television broadcasts of major league sports across broad regions of the country. As part of the 1963 reorganization, Major League clubs increased their commitments to affiliate with minor league teams through Player Development Contracts, outright ownerships, or shared affiliations and co-op arrangements.[22]\n\nFurther changes after 1963\n\nThe minor league system that evolved following the 1963 reorganization remained in place through 2020, categorizing leagues into one of six classes: Triple-A (AAA), Double-A (AA), Class A-Advanced (High A or A+), Class A (Low A), Class A Short Season, and Rookie. Furthermore, Rookie was further informally subdivided into Rookie Advanced, complex-based Rookie, and international summer baseball.\n\nTriple-A: The American Association was revived as a Triple-A league in 1969 and flourished with the minor league baseball boom of the 1980s and 1990s. However, all of its teams were again absorbed into the International and Pacific Coast leagues in 1998 as part of a sweeping reorganization of the minors' top classification. The American Association and the International League also played an interlocking schedule during the late 1980s as part of theTriple-A Alliance. The Mexican League was upgraded from Double-A to Triple-A in 1967.\n\nDouble-A: In 1964, the South Atlantic League changed its name toSouthern League. In 1971, because of continued contraction (and Major League expansion) that left each circuit with only seven teams, the Texas League and Southern League formed the 14-teamDixie Association. The arrangement lasted only for that season, and the records and history of the constituent leagues were kept distinct. In 1972, each league added an eighth team, rebalancing their schedules. The leagues subsequently returned to prosperity with the revival of minor league baseball that began in the 1980s.\n\nClass A: two additional classifications evolved from Class A. Under the rules governing the affiliated minor leagues, these became separate classifications, despite the similarity in name:\n\nBeginning in 1965, Class A Short Season leagues played approximately 75 to 80 games per season, starting in mid-June and ending in early September, designed to allow college players to complete their college seasons in the spring, be selected in the MLB draft in June, signed, and then immediately placed in a competitive league. The classification was eliminated prior to the 2021 season, with the New York–Penn League and Northwest League as the only active leagues at this level.\n\nFurther information: Class A Short Season\n\nTheClass A-Advanced classification, one rung below Double-A, was introduced in 1990 for theCalifornia League,Carolina League, andFlorida State League, splitting the Class A level even further. Entering the 2021 season, three new \"High-A\" leagues were introduced in replacement of prior leagues at this level.\n\nRookie Advanced: TheAppalachian League andPioneer League were classified as Rookie Advanced leagues beginning in 1991.[24][25] The players in these leagues were thought to be further along in their development than players in the pure Rookie leagues, and hence games were more competitive. Teams in these leagues were allowed to sell concessions and charge admission. In practice, many major league teams would have either one affiliate at this level or one affiliate in Class A Short Season but not both, making themde facto equivalent. The Rookie Advanced classification was eliminated prior to the 2021 season.\n\nRookie: In 1964, the Pioneer League stepped down from Class A to Rookie league status, and the first \"complex-based\" leagues, theSarasota Rookie League and theCocoa Rookie League, made their debuts. The Sarasota Rookie League underwent a name change to the Florida Rookie League in 1965 before becoming theGulf Coast League the next season. The Cocoa Rookie League lasted only one season, and theFlorida East Coast League of 1972, based in the same region of the state, also existed for only one year. In 1989, a counterpart to the Gulf Coast League, theArizona League, made its debut and it continues to operate as a Rookie-level league for MLB teams with spring training facilities based inArizona.\n\nThere have also been some failed start-up leagues. During the 1970s, three official minor leagues (members of NAPBL) attempted unsuccessfully to revive unaffiliated baseball (teams not associated with specific MLB franchises) within the organized baseball structure. These were the Class A Gulf States League (1976) and Lone Star League (1977), and the Triple-A Inter–American League (1979). None lasted more than a full season.\n\nReorganization of 2021\n\nIn October 2019, Baseball America reported that Major League Baseball had proposed dramatic changes to MiLB that would take effect after expiration of the Professional Baseball Agreement, which governed the MLB–MiLB relationship, at the end of the 2020 season. This included the elimination of many minor league teams.\n\nIn mid-November 2019, more than 100 members of theUnited States Congress signed a letter sent toCommissioner of BaseballRob Manfred opposing the proposal, noting that it \"is not in the best interest of the overall game of baseball\" and that it would \"devastate our communities, their bond purchasers and other stakeholders affected by the potential loss of these clubs.\" A response from MLB highlighted that the proposal aims to improve player travel and working conditions.\n\nOn November 21, 2019, Minor League Baseball released a statement, asserting that it is \"unnecessary and unacceptable to wipe out one-quarter of minor league teams\" and characterized the proposal as a way \"to improve the profitability of MLB\". Manfred rebuked Minor League Baseball for releasing the negotiations to the public and threatened to cut ties with MiLB altogether.\n\nThe following changes, which represent the first significant overhaul of minor league classifications since 1963, have since been implemented:\n\nTheMajor League Baseball draft was moved from mid-June to July to coincide with theMLB All-Star Game, and reduced from 40 rounds to 20.\n\nThe Rookie-levelAppalachian League was converted to acollegiate summer baseball league designed for rising freshmen and sophomores.\n\nTheindependentAmerican Association,Atlantic League, andFrontier League and formerly Rookie-levelPioneer League became MLB Partner Leagues, with the ability for MLB clubs to acquire players from the Partner Leagues to assign to affiliated clubs.\n\nTheMLB Draft League, a \"showcase league\" for college players expected to be selected in the annualMLB Draft, was formed, with each team in the league playing a 68-game summer season. Four teams from theNew York–Penn League (Mahoning Valley Scrappers,State College Spikes,West Virginia Black Bears, andWilliamsport Crosscutters), one from theEastern League (Trenton Thunder), and one from theCarolina League (Frederick Keys) comprised the initial league when it debuted in May 2021.\n\nThreeindependent league teams—theSt. Paul Saints, theSugar Land Skeeters, and theSomerset Patriots—were brought into MiLB. The Skeeters became the Triple-A affiliate of the Houston Astros, the Saints became the Triple-A affiliate of the Minnesota Twins, and the Patriots became the Double-A affiliate of the New York Yankees.\n\nThe number of MiLB teams, not counting teams in the complex-basedArizona Complex League andFlorida Complex League, both of which are directly owned by MLB, was reduced from 160 to 120. Short-Season A and domestic non-complex based Rookie leagues were eliminated entirely.\n\nTheNew York–Penn League was shut down, leaving seven of its teams without an invitation to join another league.\n\nAffiliate invites for 2021\n\nWhen MLB teams announced their affiliates for the 2021 season on December 9, 2020, each of the 30 MLB teams had one affiliate at four levels—Triple-A, Double-A, High-A, and Low-A—for a total of 120 affiliated teams. Approximately 40 teams lost their MLB affiliations; the Fresno Grizzlies were demoted from Triple-A to Low-A; and the majority of surviving clubs at High-A and Low-A swapped levels, with the former Florida State League and California League dropped down nearly as intact units, the Northwest League and Midwest League promoted with 75% of their teams, the majority of the Carolina League shifting to the South Atlantic League, and the old SAL being parceled out among three leagues.\n\nLeague realignment\n\nOn February 12, 2021, Major League Baseball announced new league alignments for all 120 affiliated Minor League Baseball clubs effective as of the 2021 season. Contrary to previously published reports indicating that realignment would retain the names of the existing minor leagues, Major League Baseball elected to abandon the names of existing minor leagues in favor of a new, class- and region-based naming system.\n\nTriple-A was divided into two leagues: Triple-A East, consisting of 20 teams aligned into three divisions (Midwest, Northeast, and Southeast); and Triple-A West, consisting of 10 teams aligned into two divisions (East and West).
