Rarely do I get into a “ranting” mood, whether it’s on this blog, or on Twitter. Honestly, I am not going to tell anyone how to fan, because I know I find it annoying when people try to tell me how to fan. I understand people “fan”… Read More Three Things Royals Fans Should Keep in Mind During This Rough 2023 Season\n\nBrad Keller Remains a Solid Starting Option for Royals Despite Rough Recent Starts\n\nBrad Keller continues to be an enigma for Matt Quatraro and the Royals coaching staff. The 27-year-old Rule 5 Draft pick is coming off two rough seasons in which he posted a 5.39 ERA in 2021 and a 5.09 ERA in 2022. Over the last two years in Kansas City, he has produced a combined… Read More Brad Keller Remains a Solid Starting Option for Royals Despite Rough Recent Starts\n\nFive Pitches from Royals Pitchers (Illustrated Through GIFs) Worth Paying Attention To in 2023\n\nI want to write a quick post on the day off, especially since I probably won’t be able to on Friday, as I will be in attendance for tomorrow’s game against the Braves at Kauffman on Friday. Though the Royals are 4-9, they are coming off a strong 10-1 win over the Rangers at Globe… Read More Five Pitches from Royals Pitchers (Illustrated Through GIFs) Worth Paying Attention To in 2023\n\nWhat Can Royals Fans Take Away from Brad Keller and Brady Singer’s First Starts of 2023?\n\nThe Royals finally won their first game of the year on Monday night, which also proved to be my first win of the season in person, as I was in attendance for the Royals’ 9-5 onslaught of the visiting Toronto Blue Jays. The Royals’ offense has been a mixed bag thus far through four games… Read More What Can Royals Fans Take Away from Brad Keller and Brady Singer’s First Starts of 2023?\n\nDiving Into Three Concerns After the Royals’ Rough Opening Series Against the Twins\n\nTo be honest, my expectations aren’t really all that high, to begin with when it comes to this 2023 Royals squad. I basically have projected them to win about 74 to 75 games, but that is coming from a rose-colored lens of knowing this group of Royals players way too well. If one looks at… Read More Diving Into Three Concerns After the Royals’ Rough Opening Series Against the Twins\n\nBrad Keller is Making His Case for the Royals This Spring (But Will It Stick?)\n\nIf there’s one pitcher on the Royals roster this Spring who has seemingly benefited from the new Royals coaching staff this Spring, it may be Brad Keller, who is entering his last season of team control with the Royals. In three appearances this season, Keller has been stellar, as he has produced a 3.52 ERA… Read More Brad Keller is Making His Case for the Royals This Spring (But Will It Stick?)\n\nDiving into Carlos Hernandez’s Pitches via PLV and Run-Value (And What It Could Mean for the Royals)\n\nThe Royals are currently 7-1 in Cactus League play and are seemingly gelling well under new manager Matt Quatraro and the revamped Royals coaching staff. It is nice to see the full Royals Spring Training roster perform well together before many matriculate to their respective country teams for the World Baseball Classic. A positive for… Read More Diving into Carlos Hernandez’s Pitches via PLV and Run-Value (And What It Could Mean for the Royals)\n\nAn Intro to Royals “PLV” Pitcher Deep Dives\n\nI am just going to do a quick post tonight. That being said, there have been a couple of developments that have been released by Pitcher List that I have gotten excited about and wanted to share with Royals baseball fans who aren’t familiar with Pitcher List and the features that they have on their… Read More An Intro to Royals “PLV” Pitcher Deep Dives"
