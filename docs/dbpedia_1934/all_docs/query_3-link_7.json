        "text": "OCCH is pleased to announce the appointment of Hal Keller to its Board of Directors. As a founder of the organization in 1989 and President and CEO for 26 years, Hal brings valuable insight and experience that will help drive long-term sustainable growth for OCCH.\n\n“We are very pleased that Hal is now serving on our Board of Directors. He has been a pioneer for this organization that has benefitted from his respected track record as a leader and champion for opportunity, equity, and the advancement of affordable housing,” said Catherine Cawthon, OCCH’s President and CEO. “OCCH’s success is a direct result of Hal’s guidance, and we eagerly look forward to his new role on our Board.”\n\nAfter retiring at the end of 2019, Hal returned briefly as Interim President in October 2020 and then transitioned to a consulting role through March of this year. Hal has been involved in affordable housing for over 40 years as a consultant to state and local governments, an administrator of state and local housing programs, and as a neighborhood organizer and tenant advocate in addition to his decades of service to OCCH.\n\n“I am thrilled to continue to serve OCCH in this new role.” Hal said. “I am looking forward to working with the OCCH Board, Catherine, her leadership team and the rest of OCCH staff as we continue to expand ways to serve our partners and impact residents and communities.”\n\nHe holds Master of Arts degrees in both Public Administration and Social Work from The Ohio State University and a Bachelor of Science in Applied Social Science from Case Western Reserve University. Hal continues to serve on the boards of a variety of organizations including the Affordable Housing Trust of Columbus and Franklin County and the YMCA of Central Ohio. He is a former Director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland."
