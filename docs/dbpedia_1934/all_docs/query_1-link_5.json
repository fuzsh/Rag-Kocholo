        "text": "This past November at the swanky Omni La Costa resort in Carlsbad, Calif., a group of National League general managers walked through the lobby and descended the stairs, ready to meet the media for a league-mandated availability. Several yards away, an assistant GM, after hearing a joke that he could soon be elevated to the top spot and be the one holding court, let out a laugh.\n\n“No way,” he said. “This is the best job in baseball.”\n\nMore and more people in the industry tend to agree. As baseball front offices have doubled and sometimes even tripled in size over the past 10-15 years, the old race to be the No. 1 decision-maker isn’t a race at all for some – particularly given how the salaries for assistant GMs or general managers who work under presidents are rising.\n\n“I can tell you this firsthand: there is no bigger jump between any two jobs to (the No. 1 spot of) GM,” said one former GM who still works in baseball. “The public nature of it, the demands of it, the ownership, the media, the fans. It’s a complete change. It’s not like anything anyone has been used to and it’s only getting harder as Twitter keeps going. There’s so much scrutiny on it that people are like, ‘Screw it, I’m happy making a nice living and can be around my kids and go out to dinner without being recognized.’”\n\nTeams now have more than two assistant GMs on average, and the proliferation of the role is seen by many as a good thing – but is it without drawbacks? Is it just a way to hire friends and largely exclude those with different backgrounds and talents?\n\nIn any case, AGMs stay with their teams longer than those in any other front-office role. In a study conducted by The Athletic, the median tenure of an organization’s general manager is 5.5 years, with the president of baseball operations (for clubs who have one) lasting an average of 8.5 years with their current team.\n\nThe top assistant GM job? The average tenure is 13.5 years – by far the most among front office and top on-field positions – followed by the second AGMs, who sport a median of 10.5 years with their current teams. Contrast that hitting and pitching coaches who, in general, are currently lasting two years or less with their organizations, and the job security really comes into focus.\n\n“I don’t want to be a general manager,” longtime Yankees senior vice president and AGM Jean Afterman told The Athletic’s Lindsey Adler in 2019. “I’ve got other things I wanna do with my life. I think life is a banquet!”\n\n*All table numbers through December 2021\n\nWhy has the AGM become such a popular role? Thanks to skyrocketing front-office salaries, the lure of relative anonymity and job security, there’s a faction of people perfectly happy to not be in charge.\n\n“The plum job is a GM under a president,” said a longtime baseball executive. “You get the GM title and salary and get to sit in on the GM things but someone above you is making the decision and it’s their head that rolls.”\n\nThat such a role even exists is due to the recent trend of title inflation, which dates to 2007, when Baltimore Orioles majority owner Peter Angelos wanted to hire Andy MacPhail to help shore up the baseball side of things. The problem was the Orioles had the late Mike Flanagan serving as executive vice president of baseball operations, which essentially was the club’s GM. MacPhail – who had come from a CEO/president role with the Cubs – had to have a title greater than Flanagan’s, so Angelos named him the president of baseball operations, essentially the top front office executive, with Flanagan under him as EVP/GM.\n\nThat was the gateway to a surge in title inflation, where teams understood that if they had a young, promising assistant general manager they could promote them to the GM role with a president above them. It was a win-win, as teams didn’t lose young front office members they valued, while those individuals were still essentially a No. 2 or No. 3 person – though paid at a far higher level than before.\n\n“The Marlins did it with (Michael) Hill and (Larry) Beinfest (as president and GM). They were the first to kind of do it in a strategic inflation way,” said the former GM. “The Cubs popularized it with Theo (Epstein) and Jed (Hoyer). (Andrew) Friedman did it and brought in Farhan Zaidi (under him). Now it happens more often than it doesn’t. The way it is now, instead of 30 people making a million you have 60.”\n\nZaidi left the Dodgers’ GM job to take the top job in San Francisco as president of baseball operations. After initially not replacing Zaidi, it’s been speculated by some in the industry that Friedman could promote AGM Brandon Gomes to GM. (Editor’s note: The Dodgers officially promoted Gomes to general manager on Tuesday and added two new AGMs, hiring former Washington Football Team chief legal officer Damon Jones and promoting director of baseball operations Alex Slater.) Those rumors started after his name surfaced on the Mets’ list for their vacant GM job (which eventually went to Billy Eppler, under team president Sandy Alderson.)\n\nThe Mets saw firsthand the difficulty in luring some of the game’s top AGMs to New York for a promotion. While there was plenty of industry skepticism over certain elements of the job – including the level of autonomy and whether owner Steven Cohen would pivot if Brewers president David Stearns ever became available – there was also a faction of No. 2’s and 3’s who have no interest in being the top lieutenant and certainly not in New York.\n\n“If you want to be a GM and that’s what’s driving you, the Mets won’t scare you away,” said one longtime assistant GM, who was not under consideration for the job. “I do think there’s something about New York and the way they are covered, and the pressure. It’s different being a No. 2 in Cleveland or Milwaukee, or a place where you have two beat writers and no one cares like Tampa or Oakland. Those guys have a cushy gig and oftentimes don’t want to leave that cushy gig.”\n\nAdded the executive: “Guys are making a million dollars to not be in charge. There’s not the financial incentive to take a chance. Back in the day, you got a promotion, you just went. But AGMs were making maybe $100,000-150,000, which is still good money but there’s a big lifestyle difference between that and $650,000. There’s not a big lifestyle difference between $1 million and $2 million (annually), unless you really care about setting up your great-grandkids.”\n\nWhile the competition for front-office talent remains fierce, most organizations abide by the general rule of allowing their employees to interview for a job elsewhere if it’s a promotion. So if you don’t title-inflate people you value, you risk losing them. That’s why a good scouting director often comes with the assistant GM or VP title now, as do international scouting directors and other department heads. This winter, the Phillies raised eyebrows when they hired 27-year-old Ani Kilambi from the Tampa Bay Rays. They did it by giving him the assistant GM role.\n\nThis isn’t to say that no one wants to run a front office anymore. But it’s no longer the only way to make really good money, “at the cost of any shred of normalcy or anonymity,” as one AGM put it.\n\nSome people interviewed for this story thought the trend is a good thing, a way of growing front offices to keep current employees happy and well-paid as organizations place added emphasis and funds on growing and retaining talent.\n\n“We still do see at the lower levels, scouts and minor-league coaches don’t make shit, but I think a lot of this is healthy globally in terms of the industry,” said the former GM. “It’s a good thing employees and wages are catching up to the work, even though it hasn’t caught up in the lower levels.”\n\nOthers fear this trend is, inadvertent or not, a way to keep baseball’s insular culture intact, leaving minority candidates and those not considered part of baseball’s brainy new wave out. The current group of front offices, which are filled with Ivy League grads, look, act and dress so much alike that it led a reporter to pose a question about it at the GM Meetings.\n\n“Has title inflation become another way to say, ‘Hey, I’m going to get my buddies from school paid?” opined one frustrated AGM, who has a baseball background and didn’t go to an Ivy League school.\n\nCertainly, some qualified people who do aspire to get to the front office’s top spot could be overlooked as the sport continues to grapple with serious diversity issues at its upper echelons. Afterman is one of just a handful of women in AGM roles or higher, and while Kim Ng was named Marlins GM in November 2020, White Sox president of baseball operations Kenny Williams pointed out in an impassioned plea at the GM meetings that the handful of non-White men in the room had all already been in prominent roles in the industry before they were promoted.\n\nWilliams told The Athletic’s Ken Rosenthal what bothers him the most in recent years is a double standard: Teams place less emphasis on experience when promoting certain White men to top executive positions, yet cite a lack of experience when denying those same opportunities to people of color and women.\n\n“As I told the group, I’m not saying that someone in that room shouldn’t be there,” Williams said. “I’m saying give others an opportunity.”\n\nZaidi, who was born in Canada and raised in the Philippines by Pakistani parents, told Rosenthal his academic credentials — he graduated from MIT and earned a doctorate in economics from Cal Berkeley — make him more a person of privilege than a true outsider among current front offices.\n\nOne longtime assistant GM, who is a person of color and doesn’t have an Ivy League education, told The Athletic he’s at peace with never getting the top role. But to never be considered while candidates with half his age and qualifications frequently are hurts.\n\n“I just want one interview,” he said. “Just one.”\n\nThe Selig Rule, created by former Commissioner Bud Selig in 1999, requires teams to consider minorities when filling vacancies for manager, general manager, assistant general manager, scouting director and minor league director. The thought process was that by forcing a more diverse picking pool, hiring numbers would improve. But from 2010-17, the number of minorities in control of a club’s baseball operations department increased only once.\n\nIn 2011, four general managers were diverse hires. Ten years later that number is still at four, with MLB clubs getting a 2021 racial hiring grade — done yearly by The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES) — for president of baseball ops/GMs of a C-minus, (13.3 percent). That’s the same grade as last year.\n\nTeam gender hiring in the vice president category — which includes directors, managers, asst. GMs, senior managers, general counsel, legal counsel, senior advisors, and assistant VPs — was graded as an F, with women in 22 percent of those positions, which is down from 2020. Racial hiring received a C grade with 15.3 percent of people of color in those roles last year.\n\nIn October, MLB sent out a memo to all 30 clubs with modifications to the “Selig Rule” that addresses internal promotions in hopes of creating more diversity. It will be years before we can properly evaluate what changes, if any, that creates.\n\nIn some ways, the story of the AGM title is that it’s vague enough to capture a lot of different job descriptions, and prestigious enough to make poaching difficult for other teams. Good people can find their way to new responsibilities with new leadership, giving them the ability to remain productive and in their role even as the person at the very top changes. And certain leaders, in certain organizations, will give people longer to find their right place.\n\nWhy do people stay so long with a single organization in that AGM role? For a few different reasons, really. Some of it has to do with the internal politics of running an organization.\n\nCertain organizations just hold their personnel longer than others. Here are the top 10 and bottom 10 organizations by average organizational tenure across the roles we tracked.\n\n*All table numbers through December 2021\n\nSome of these teams have recently undergone huge changes, and probably for good reason, so that’s why they’ll end up on the bottom of the list. But why are the Dodgers and Astros also down there among the shortest tenures?\n\nSome of these teams have had long runs of success, and so you’ll see them at the top. Other teams, like the Royals, have had long runs of stability in the front office without sustained runs of success. Kansas City’s Dayton Moore is entering his 16th season with the organization and was promoted to President from GM/Senior VP in September, (with J.J. Picollo promoted from AGM to GM.)\n\nExecutive poaching might be at fault for some of the better teams having more turnover. And a few down seasons might not be enough for every organization to make full-sale changes. And the AGM title itself is a way for teams to retain productive people longer. Since most teams only have one general manager, and most teams have two or more AGMs, giving an important cog in the front office the AGM role practically ensures they’ll stick with the team longer.\n\nBut there are also different leadership philosophies at play.\n\n“If you’re in a position to hire, you want to see what’s out there and it’s your responsibility to do that,” said one front office executive. “If you hire from the outside over your internal candidate, you’ve just sent that person a massive message. ‘We don’t think you’re ready and even when you are, we’ve just hired someone in front of you.’ There’s a real art to it. Too internalized and you can stagnate, but what if your people are progressive and open minded and out there searching and learning?”\n\nSome do still see the AGM role as a stepping stone on the way to running a team themselves. For them, the proliferation of the title is an annoyance, a road block, something worth rolling their collective eyes at — or wondering if the composition of baseball’s front offices will ever truly look different.\n\nSome, like the scout who turned down a management position because he told The Athletic, “I just want to go out and see players, just let me do that and I’m happy,” see it differently. The AGM role is well-paid, and vague, meaning most AGMs can find their way to the responsibilities that fit them best. And there’s none of the heartburn that comes from shouldering all the limelight as the head person in charge.\n\nTo some, it’s the best job in baseball. If you’re lucky enough to get it."
