As a boy he helped at the family general store and developed a life-long love for the outdoors. He was a disciplined journal writer; his journals span 1938 to 2016. Later in life, he turned these journals into a multi-volume family history full of family photographs. He enjoyed playing baseball and was a fantastic pitcher like his father. Cal was scouted by several professional teams like the Detroit Tigers, but he ended up signing a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds. However, he cut his baseball career short when he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps the summer before the Pearl Harbor attack. He became a first lieutenant and B-17 pilot with the 97th Bomb Group of the 414th Bomb Squadron and is credited with 51 missions during his overseas duty, 1943-1944. After the war ended, Cal settled in Pinconning, Michigan with his wife Dottie. The couple had married on November 23, 1943, before Cal’s deployment. Cal and his family created Pinconning’s first airport, Sportsmen’s Field, in Saginaw Bay. Cal worked many jobs, including as a private pilot, as a crop duster, a professional photographer, and a school bus driver. He returned to the military as a flight instructor at Randolph Field/Lackland AFB in San Antonio, Texas, during the Korean War. After the war, he worked for Magline, Inc. After retiring in 1985, he spent time with family, traveling, and caring for f his fruit trees. He worshiped with Dottie at St. John’s Lutheran Church for most of his adult life. Later, he moved to Midland, but continued to be ministered by his Pinconning pastor. He was preceded in death by his wife of 77 years, Dorothy (Dottie); his parents, his elder son, Michael Robert Carstens; and his siblings. Cal died in 2021 and was survived by his children Kenneth, Diane (Robert) Tomczak, and his grandchildren.\n\nKen \"Casey\" Carstens:\n\nKenneth Charles “Casey” Carstens (February 12, 1949-) grew up in Pinconning, Michigan. He began playing as a baseball pitcher in his teens. From 1963 to 1969, Ken, like his grandfather, father, and uncle, played in the Northeastern Michigan Baseball League (NEML). The NEML existed between 1916 and 1986 and consisted of advanced sandlot, college ball, and professional baseball players from around northeastern Michigan. Ken attended Central Michigan University (CMU) on a baseball scholarship. However, during his sophomore year he injured his throwing arm and had to give up pitching. Ken had an interest in anthropology and archaeology since he was ten when his father gave him a cigar box full of arrowheads found at the family airport. By 1963, Ken began collaborating with teams of archaeologists from the University of Michigan. In 1969 CMU only had two anthropology courses and neither were about archaeology. Ken sought assistance from CMU President William Boyd who eventually hired archaeologist Karen Chavez (A.B.D., Penn). Ken also worked with Dr. Hal Mahan, the first Director of the CMU Center for Cultural and Natural History, as Mahan built the museum and had the first archaeological field school at the Lalone site in Arenac County. At the Michigan Academy of Sciences, Ken was the first CMU undergraduate to present a paper and published the paper in The Michigan Archaeologist. Also, as an undergraduate, he published a report on the Museum’s second archaeological field school at the Tobico Site in Bay County. In 1971 Ken graduated from CMU. He next earned his M.A. and Ph.D. under Professor Patty Jo Watson at Washington University-St. Louis. The pair co-developed the first floatation recovery machine for archaeological research and published results of their work in the book Of Caves and Shell Mounds (UA Press/Tuscaloosa, 1996). Copies of this book and two others authored or co-authored by Ken are available in the Clarke Historical Library. Ken took his first academic position at Northern Kentucky University in 1976 and two years later took the directorship of the anthropology and archaeology programs at Murray State University. He retired from Murray State University in 2007 with Professor Emeritus status, but continued to teach web-based anthropology and world history courses at the university until 2016. In 2016, he took a per course faculty position at Missouri State University in Springfield. Between 1971 and 1976, while on active duty with the U.S. Air Force, he played as a catcher for an Air Force fast-pitch softball team during the spring of 1972. In 2022, Ken was inducted into NEML’s Hall of Fame. In 2024 Ken visited the Clarke. Besides being a highly respected archaeologist and a thorough genealogist, he is a charming and kind person, the type of person you wish you had as a friend.
