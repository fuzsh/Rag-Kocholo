        "text": "After learning that Fred had been shot at Pop's shoppe by an unknown, black hooded assailant, Alice, Hal, and Betty rushed over to Riverdale General Hospital, where Fred was undergoing surgery. To no surprise, they are met by Jughead, Veronica, and Hermione. They entered the lobby to find Archie pacing back and forth, covered in his father's blood. As the kids embraced, Hal, Alice, and Hermione checked in with the nursing station. While Archie headed into the hallway to call his mother, and inform her of Fred's shooting, Alice accused the Southside Serpents of potentially being involved, and looked to Jughead for answers. In consideration of everything that was going on, Hal whispered to her that now was not the time.\n\nAlice and Hal briefly appeared in one of Fred's dream-like hallucinations following the shooting. They sat together in the crowd at Archie and Veronica's Scottish themed wedding.[9]\n\nFan Mail from the Black Hood\n\nAlice and Hal greeted Betty as she returned home from school that evening. The envelope that Betty had brought in earlier that morning from the front porch was \"fan mail\" from the shooter, who was calling himself the Black Hood. He wanted them to publish his letter claiming responsibility for the shootings of Fred Andrews, Moose Mason, and Midge Klump, as well as the murder of Geraldine Grundy in Greendale. As proof that he is who he says he is and that the letter is from the actual killer, inside the envelope was Fred's missing wallet and Geraldine's glasses.\n\nAlice and Hal then headed down to the Mayor's office, where they turned the evidence over to Mayor McCoy and Sheriff Keller. In the spirit of public safety, Mayor McCoy suggested that they refrain from publishing the letter. However, Hal and Alice felt it was their responsibility to inform the public that there was a killer freely walking about Riverdale, targeting his next victim. Printing such an article would cause town-wide panic, Sheriff Keller said. He requested a media black-out for at least the next twenty-four hours. He'd be taking the letter into evidence, but claimed that he would send them a copy afterwards. However, there was no need for such doing. Hal and Alice had made their own copy just before sending it to the printer for tomorrow's front page.\n\nThe next day, Alice and Hal were approached by Polly, who after reading their published article of the Black Hood's letter in the Register, decided that she would be leaving Riverdale for her own safety. She had already made arrangements at the Farm. What Farm, Alice wondered. Polly explained that she was referring to the very same Farm that she and Jason had planned to run off to before he was murdered. Hal suggested that Polly settle down, so that they can talk about what to do next. Polly was worried about her well being, as well as the well being of her unborn babies. With the killer targeting sinners, she was no longer safe in Riverdale considering that she was an unwed mother carrying her cousin's babies. Over Alice's dead body would she allow Polly to run off and give birth at a Farm, though she didn't have much say in the matter as Polly had already made up her mind. She stormed off, with Hal not far behind, hoping to talk some sense into her.[10]\n\nWith the Black Hood free to terrorize the town and target the residents of Riverdale, Alice and Hal took precautions in order to ensure the safety of their family by installing brand new locks on the door.\n\nAlice and Hal confronted Betty after learning that Poll had left town despite the fact that she had told her not to. They sat Betty down at the dinning room table because she had let Polly go without alerting her Alice. When Betty tried to justify her actions for helping her sister, Alice burst into tears, revealing how she was constantly terrified for her daughters' safety knowing there was a killer on the loose. Every time Betty walked out the door or didn't answer her phone when she called, Alice worried that something terrible had happened to her. It was the acts that she and Polly did in secrecy that made it difficult for their mother to protect them. They even label Alice as a monster for trying to protect them. This upset Alice to the point where she left the room, leaving Hal and Alice to cope with the revelation.\n\nTwo days had passed since their discussion with Betty, and so Alice and Hal attended the Town Hall meeting, where Mayor McCoy welcomed all to the event in hopes that she could address their concerns and if possible, ease their minds, as she too shared their desire to protect their town and their children. Mayor McCoy and Sheriff Keller then announced the introduction of a town-wide curfew and helpline that residents can call to report any suspicious activity. Alice likened the police department's actions to the Red Circle's plan and expressed that it had come time to solve the real problem of Riverdale; the Southside. Although Mayor McCoy tried to stop Alice's speech, focusing exclusively on the Black Hood, Alice snorted, continuing to feed and give voice to the indignation of a town; the reporter suggested closing the Southside High School, a drug spreading center, and also suggested increasing police patrols. Alice was opposed by Fred Andrews, who claimed that demonizing one another was counterproductive. Alice was about to reply when Betty and Jughead burst into the meeting, saying the Black Hood was headed to the Town Hall according to the message they deciphered. Alice had no time to reply before Betty had the meeting evacuated.\n\nWith the Town Hall meeting brought to an abrupt end, Hal, Alice, Betty, Jughead, Sheriff Keller, and Mayor McCoy reconvened at the Cooper's house, where they hoped to gain a better understand of how Betty and Jughead knew where the Black Hood would strike next. Betty handed them the letter, which was sent to her by the Black Hood, along with the cipher that she had earlier turned over to Alice, revealing that she had withheld evidence from them in an attempt to solve the cipher herself.[11]\n\nSecret Serpent Past\n\nAlice entered Pop's for her usual meal. However, while there, she grew alarmed by Pop Tate's supportive words. She became even more concerned after noticing that all the customers were staring at her. Alice discovered that Betty had published on the front page of the Blue and Gold, a defamatory article about her arrest during her adolescence, titled \"Alice Cooper's Secret Serpent Past\". Upon returning home, Alice and Hal questioned Betty on how she found about the article since she had erased any trace from any public archive. Maybe it was one of the Southsiders you attack in your paper, daily, Betty replied. She constantly talked down on FP, Jughead, and the Serpents, despite previously being one herself. Alice suspected that Betty's publishing of the article was out of revenge, but as Betty explained, she did it in the name of justice and Alice's \"holier-than-thou\" attitude. Alice ripped the newspaper page, barely holding back her tears while staring back at her daughter before Betty left the kitchen.\n\nA couple days later, Hal attended the Lodges' SoDale Gala Opening, where he became reacquainted with an old friend; Hiram Lodge. Just between the two, Hal told Hiram that the article Betty published of Alice's mugshot, took a toll on her, so they both decided it would be best if he covered the event alone. Much to Hal's surprise, Alice showed up at the SoDale Gala Opening, completely owning the scene in a fabulous red snake print dress and a golden snake-shaped necklace. Alice left the various attendants totally astonished, including her husband who had just finished saying to Hiram Lodge that wasn't a good idea for Alice to show up in public after the defamatory article. Later, Alice barely avoided appearing bored during Hiram's speech to his guest. [12]\n\nAlice and Hal briefly appeared in Betty's anxiety induced nightmare along Polly. The three of them gathered in the living room by the fire place, as Betty came down the steps. They wished her a Merry Christmas. Moments later, Hal, Alice and Polly. In Betty's nightmare, they had been murdered by the Black Hood.[13]\n\nMeeting Chic\n\nAlice and Hal learned from Betty that Polly gave birth to the twins at the Farm. As Hal tried to cope with the news, Alice struggled to hold back her tears. So Hal questioned why Polly hadn't informed them of this. Alice surmised that Polly didn't want them to be apart of the babies' lives. Alice then asked Betty if Polly was alright and if the children were healthy. Betty reassured her, stating that Polly is fine and the babies are healthy. Betty revealed that this wasn't all she had to share. After some digging, she found an address for Alice's son and her biological brother, that was given up for adoption many years ago. His name was Charles Smith. With Polly gone, Betty assumed that this would better their lives, but Hal would beg to differ. He scolded Betty for prying into something that had nothing to do with her or Polly. Betty exclaimed that she did it for her mother, though she was clearly upset by the recent revelation, Alice agreed with Hal, deciding then that it was best to end the conversation.\n\nThe following evening, Betty returned home with Chic hanging over her shoulder as Alice and Hal sat in the living room reading books. She called out to them for help as Chic's arm had been sliced open. Hal, Alice and Betty took Chic to the kitchen, where they grabbed the first aid kit and applied medical care.\n\nAfterward, they laid him down in Polly's room to rest for the night. Hal stood by the doorway as Alice comforted Chic and explained that they had a lot to talk about.[14]\n\nAs the Coopers sat at the breakfast table, Hal began an intrusive line of questioning of Chic, starting with how long he planned on staying with them. Alice stated that he was free to stay for as long as he wanted to. Hal claimed that he was simply trying to plan his life. When Betty brought Chic home, he was bleeding profusely from his arm. Hal wanted answers on why Chic was in that condition. Betty told Chic that he didn't have to answer her father's questions but he did so regardless. Chic's attacker's name was Marcel. He ran the Hostel, and sometimes, he booked clients for them. The night Betty showed up, Chic wasn't in the mood to work, but Marcel attempted to convince him otherwise. Both Hal and Betty both expressed interest in the type of clients Chic catered to. Chic replied that he had clients ranging from nice to even nastier than Marcel. If Hal preferred, Chic could specify, along with showing him a decent collection of scars that he had acquired over time. Betty also had scars, crescent marks in her palms, from digging her nails in them. Like Betty, Chic once dug his nails into the palms of his hands.\n\nTwo days had passed since their previous sit down at the breakfast table, though Hal had still not grown past his antagonizing of Chic. He asked if Chic knew that he was sitting in Polly's seat. He was not only sitting in her chair, but sleeping in her bed as well. Chic was filling a void, as far as Hal was concerned and it was the only reason Chic was staying with them. Alice and Betty urged him to stop though, Chic was surprisingly unbothered by Hal's remarks. Everyone needed something, to his point. Furthermore, he didn't expect to be staying with them for free. He never had.\n\nOn Pickens Day, Alice had prepared a hearty breakfast for the family in preparation for the celebration at Pickens Park, especially since it would be their first outing as a family. However, Hal would be staying behind as he had a few odd jobs around the house to catch up on.\n\nDespite claiming that he was staying home to catch up on a few odd jobs around the house, Hal confronted Chic at Pickens Day. He asked if Alice knew what kind of person they had welcomed into their home, in the room next to Betty's no less. While they were gone, Hal went through Chic's computer. In doing so, he discovered what Chic had been doing online with his \"clients\". Betty insisted that he stop harassing him, though Chic wasn't the only subject of Hal's anger. He even scolded Betty for bringing Chic into their lives and into their home, more specifically, Polly's bedroom. Alice remarked that Polly was no longer apart of their lives and that therefore, it was no longer her room. Hal insisted that Chic had to go and that Alice knew exactly why. Alice reminded Hal that she had thrown him out the house before and that she would not hesitate to do it again. Heading the warning, Hal took off.[15]\n\nAs Hal stood by the front door while holding a suitcase, Alice and Betty attempted to convince him to stay at the house but he was adamant in leaving for as long as Chic was staying with them. Though Alice wasn't willing to entertain his insane notion. She and Betty tried to explain to Hal that Chic wasn't hurting anyone and that he had found a job at the Bijou. He had even offered to pay them rent. So Alice had no idea what was Hal's beef with him. Hal replied that Chic was a stranger, though Hal wasn't even making an effort to get to know him. However, Hal refused to change his stance on the matter. Before leaving, he told Alice and Betty to call him once Chic was gone. In the meantime, he'd be at a ShareBNB down by the Register.[16]\n\nIn the late hours of the night, Hal called Betty to tell her that he was on his way to the house for toiletries but he didn't wish to get into a fight with Alice about Chic. Upon his arrival, he was overwhelmed by the strong aroma of bleach. Alice supposedly spilled tomato soup on the rug and she didn't want it to stain. After remarking that it must've been a lot of soup given that the house smelled like a hospital, Hal headed upstairs to get the toiletries he had come for.[17]\n\nIt had been a long time coming, and so Hal decided to sit down with Alice, and ask for a divorce. Alice asked if he was still seeing Penelope Blossom. Which he wasn't. Furthermore, the divorce had little to nothing to do with Penelope. Hal explained that it was about how he worshiped Alice like a goddess for 20 years only for her to side with Chic, a stranger, over him. Betty too. He couldn't believe that they chose Chic. However, Betty claimed that she was on Hal's side in regards to Chic. She too wanted him out of the house. As for selling the Register, he explained that Hiram Lodge offered a fair price, half of which he was willing to give to her as long as she was willing to agree to set him free immediately. Little did Alice know, Hal's sudden want for a divorce had something to do with Clifford Blossoms' upcoming will-reading.\n\nThe next day, Alice interrupted the will-reading when coming to confront Hal over him asking for a divorce for the sole purpose of cutting her out of the will. This led to a confrontation between Alice and Penelope. After Alice was escorted from the premises, the will reading continued.[18]\n\nAfter getting a call from Betty that Alice is feeling lonely and abandoned, Hal arrives at the house with flowers for her and Alice. However, Alice is allergic to peonies. Hal tells her that he'd really like to come back home. If they do this, there can't be anymore secrets, which means Alice has something to tell Hal regarding Chic. She reveals that Chic isn't his son. Which he always suspected though he didn't care. He only wants to come home. Their secrets can't hurt them anymore and they can be together again.\n\nHal later attends \"Carrie: The Musical\" play in support of Alice and Betty.[19]\n\nThe town gathers for Midge's funeral to pay respect. Cheryl sings a song in Midge's honor. She and the rest of the River Vixens are dressed in all-black cheerleader uniform. Midge's death has seemingly taken a great toll on Riverdale, Mrs. Klump and Moose especially. Hal stands alongside Alice and Betty as the service commences.\n\nLater that day, Sheriff Keller arrives at the Cooper house to question Chic as he has been talking to everyone who was at Riverdale High School the night of the musical. A couple people claim they saw Chic backstage just before the show. Hal tells the Sheriff that Chic no longer lives with them, but that they can bring him down to the station tomorrow. Sheriff agrees and then leaves. Once he is gone, Alice wonders why Hal threw Chic under the bus. Hal questions what Alice is worried that Chic will say. Betty interjects that Alice is just overprotective of Chic.\n\nAfter learning that Chic is an impostor and that he is tied up in the basement, Hal blows up. He demands to know what they were doing. Alice begs him to calm down, but with a psychopath in their basement, Hal is irate. When Hal decides that it's better to let the police deal with Chic, Alice says that they can't because she would go to jail as well. She reveals that Chic killed a man in the house and that she helped him cover it up by disposing of the body. Alice lies to Hal and tells him that Betty had no involvement in the cover-up. It was only her and Chic. When Betty tries to speak up, Alice tells her not to say another word and to go to her room.\n\nAfterward, Hal supposedly leaves the house in search of Betty after she exited through the basement with Chic.[20]\n\nAt the Cooper house, Alice, Hal and Betty were having breakfast. Hal notices that Betty is troubled and asks if there is something on her mind. Betty claims that she had been thinking and had come to the conclusion that Chic was a test. Everything that he did to them and brought on them was a test. Betty believes that they're stronger after surviving it. Alice remarks that this supposed strength remains to be seen, but Betty is positive that they are stronger. Furthermore, they'll survive whatever comes next.\n\nThe next day, at the Cooper house, Betty explains that given the fact that Hal has been so busy at the Register, she proposes that Alice join him. She is already moderating the debate. Betty sees no reason why she shouldn't report on it as well. Alice likes the sound of this. As does Hal. Betty even offers to help with proofing and layout after school. Hal couldn't be happier to have them both back the the Register.\n\nAt the Register, Alice and Hal head out for dinner while Betty hangs back to finish up her work.\n\nLater, at the dinner table, Betty reveals to Hal and Alice that when the Black Hood was first killing people, he was also calling her, asking her to do things as they were alike. He offered to help get rid of Chic. So Betty delivered Chic to the Black Hood. If Chic's dead, that makes her accomplice to a murder, and Betty's okay with that. There's always been this darkness inside of her. She thought Chic could help her understand it, but really it was the Black Hood who did. She says all this to potentially bait Hal, who she suspects of being the Black Hood. Alice is left speechless. Hal holds Betty's had and tells her about his own darkness. When he was away from Betty and Alice, it felt like he was drowning it. This is why they need each other.\n\nThe night of the Mayoral debate, Alice is on stage and welcomes all in attendance at the event. Jumping right into the debate, fear and unrest rule the streets, so Alice asks how Hermione Lodge plans to restore safety to the town. Hermione claims that they're already making strides. She and Hiram personally recruited Sheriff Minetta from Centerville after Tom Keller resigned. Not one week on the job, and he's supposedly apprehended Midge Klump's murderer. Fred argues that they don't actually know that Fangs Fogarty is the killer. Regarding his comment about calling for blood, Hermione enlightens him about the Dark Circle, who she refers to as a dangerous, radical group that traffics in terror, violence and street warfare. This group, she points out, was started by Archie. The debate is abruptly interrupted by the Black Hood on the balcony with a rifle, who start shooting at the crowd. Alice finds safety, and Hal and Betty manage to find each other and hide for their safety.[21]\n\nDuring the riots between Northsiders vs Southsiders, Alice is at the Register and is relieved to hear that Betty is okay. When Betty asks about her father, Alice informs her that Hal is out calming the riots.\n\nLater, at the Cooper house, Hal enters the living room, pleased to see that Betty made it home. Alice explains that Hal came up with an idea to watch home movies. She figured she would indulge him given that they're practically on lock-down due to the riot. Hal grabs the projector and plays for Alice and Betty old home videos of himself as a child, being disciplined by his mother. On the video, Hal's mother tells him that his father did something very noble in massacring the Conway family as they were sinners, thus the revelation that Hal's father was the Riverdale Reaper. Hal states that sinners have to die. He was then ordered by his mother to convince Joseph Conway to accuse someone other than his father of being the killer. While his father may have allowed Joseph to get away, Hal will do better, his mother says on the recording.\n\nWhen the video ends, Hal tells Alice to take out her tape-recorder as he wishes to share his story. First of all, Hal reveals that Great-Grandpappy Cooper wasn't murdered by his brother. Instead, he was the killer. He killed Great-Grandpappy Blossom and then took on the Cooper name to create a new identity for himself. The Conways discovered this secret. Mr. Conway blackmailed Hal's father/Betty's grandfather. So he killed them for being sinners. As for Joseph Conway, the sole survivor, Hal did what was asked of him by convincing Joseph to accuse an innocent man. Joseph was easy to manipulate both as a boy and a man, Hal explains. He goes onto tell Betty and Alice about his darkness. The same darkness that runs in the Cooper family, which now lives in Betty. Hal approaches Betty and demands that she say who he is. \"You're the Black Hood\", Betty says as her eyes fill with tears. Hal is responsible for shooting Fred Andrews as well as killing Miss Grundy, the Sugarman, Midge, and Dr. Masters. But the shooting at the Mayoral debate was not Hal's doing.\n\nHal explains to Betty and Alice that he became the Black Hood because Riverdale is a town of sinners and sinners have to die. Hal recalls Betty speech at the 75th Anniversary Jubilee, where she says that the town must do better. It reminded him of a promise he made to his mother, that Riverdale would do better. So Hal picked up his father's sword, so to speak and continued the work that he and Hal's grandfather started. The purging of sin. Betty asks why Hal wanted this discussion recorded. Hal replies that he wanted everyone to understand what happened when they find them. It would seem that Hal plans on killing Betty and Alice, along with himself.\n\nAlice taunts Hal. She always knew he was a mama's boy. She claims that he can't do anything for himself. Betty advises her mother against antagonizes him, but she continues to do so nonetheless, pointing out that Hal can't do anything right. Not even be a serial killer. She calls Hal out for being a sinner and questions what Fred could've possibly done that would call for his death. Hal explains that Fred was an adulterer. However, given that Hal had an affair with Penelope Blossom, Alice tells Hal to kill himself. Or maybe Hal should kill her, Alice states. She informs him that she slept with FP, who in every way that Hal's not, is a real man. With Hal distracted, Betty grabs a shovel from the fireplace. As his anger builds, Hal chokes Alice. Fortunately, Betty hits him over the head with the shovel from behind, knocking him to the ground, Alice then hits him with the shovel."
