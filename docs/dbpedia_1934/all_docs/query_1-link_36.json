        "text": "Founded in 1945, the Humboldt Crabs are the oldest, continuously-operated, collegiate, independent, wood-bat, summer baseball team in the country. 2023 will mark the 79th consecutive year of operations for Crabs baseball. The team is currently based out of Arcata, California. Mailing address: PO Box 4422, Arcata, CA 95518\n\nThe Crabs’ roster is made up of NCAA eligible collegiate players mostly from the West Coast.\n\n• To go to the 2023 schedule page, CLICK HERE.

Nor are the Crabs affiliated with any baseball leagues. The Crabs are currently an independent team.)\n\nThe Crabs mission is four-fold:\n\nTo promote family entertainment by providing high-quality summer collegiate baseball games to the public at a reasonable price;\n\nTo provide talented collegiate-level baseball players with a positive summer baseball experience;\n\nTo support youth sports programs (with an emphasis on baseball or softball) in the Humboldt County area with contributions of funding and/or equipment as funds permit in addition to annual baseball skills camps and clinics operated by Humboldt Crabs players and coaches;\n\nTo preserve and build the tradition of Humboldt Crabs Baseball.\n\nSPONSORSHIPS & SUPPORT: Humboldt Crabs Baseball, Inc is a 501(c)(4) community-owned organization. A volunteer board of directors rely on the support of community partners & sponsors to keep the Humboldt Crabs Baseball operation functioning.

No donation is too small. A box of baseballs is around $130.00.\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nAs a non-profit organization, the Crabs rely on a dedicated group of non-paid volunteers for the day-to-day operations. The volunteer Board of Directors range in size from 12 to 15 individuals. Each board member is responsible for handling many behind-the-scenes tasks that allow the Humboldt Crabs Baseball team to continue operating. If you’d like to volunteer or work for the Crabs, please contact our Board of Directors President to inquire (see email address below).\n\nThe Humboldt Crabs Board of Directors was first established in 1995 when the team was on the verge of collapse. A group of community members who loved Crabs baseball rallied to save the team and created a non-profit organization to handle the daily operations. In the past 20+ years, the Board of Directors, with the help of many loyal and dedicated community sponsors have grown the fan base to the point where the Crabs have set attendance records, pulling in more than 34,000 fans in the months of June-Aug. The team gives back to local businesses in the summer months when the bulk of the students from CalPoly Humboldt have left town, infusing millions of dollars into the local economy from the visiting teams, visitors, fans, players and their families who spend time in Humboldt County just to come and watch the Crabs play.\n\nThe current Crabs Board President is David Sharp. Sharp is a former Crabs player and baseball coach.
