        "text": "Bing Crosby was always one of my favorites. I loved him in the “Road” movies with Bob Hope. I make it a point to watch “White Christmas” each holiday season. Bin and Danny Kaye were just great in that movie.\n\nI also remember thinking that Bing Crosby reminded me so much of my uncle. I could never decide if the connection was their looks (they did look a little alike), they way they were with words or just that the way Bing looked in an Army uniform reminded me of how my uncle looked in his.\n\nAs much as I followed Bing Crosby as a movie star and as a former owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates, I never knew that Bing Crosby drank wine. Never knew he had a wine cellar. Thank goodness he had a wine cellar.\n\nBack in the ’60s, Major League baseball was still trying to get accustomed to having blacks on its teams’ rosters. A lot of games were still being played in the daytime. There was no ESPN (that’s right, there was no ESPN). There was no instant replay or fake grass on ball fields. The vines at Wrigley Field were not yet full-grown and all those old ballparks that have been replaced with new ones (except Fenway Park in Boston) would still around and filled fans that had bought cheap tickets.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, you could ride a trolley card to Forbes Field. Drink beer or get a snack at any of the bars or restaurants nearby. There were seats at old Forbes Field that were obstructed by large steel supports. A program cost 50 cents and a hotdog just 30.\n\nBack in the 60s, Major League Baseball had yet to decide that archiving important games through their television broadcasts was a good idea or not. MLB had yet to decide whether or not it was important enough and if there would be a use for those films later down the road. After all, back then sports writers would so vividly describe a game that who needed video.\n\nOn October 13, 1960, the area known as Rush Run, just north of Rayland, and that area’s greatest contribution to the world of sports gave all of us one of the greatest sports moments in history.\n\nBobby Thompson may have hit the “shot heard round the world”, but the quiet, laid-back Bill Mazeroski hit the greatest home run of all time. On October 13, 1960, with no outs, no one on base, a 1-0 count and the game-tied at 9-9 in the bottom of the ninth at Forbes Field in the Oakland District of Pittsburgh, Bill Mazeroski blasted a homer over the head of Yogi Berra and just over the 409 mark in left field to give the Pirates the 1960 World Championship.\n\nIt was a shot that has been talked about for 50 years and will be for the next 50. It was a hit that not only made the humble Mazeroski a household name, but directed the attention to the great second baseman who would eventually be inducted into baseball’s Hall of Fame.\n\nIt’s a home run that had been shown over and over for years. The highlights of Maz rounding the bases, waving his helmet with a grin from ear-to-ear have been seen by millions. Pictures of Maz seem to pop up in most every book that documents the history of baseball.\n\nThrough all years, the highlight films, the pictures, the stories, it was game itself that had been lost in time. For you see, until just very recently, there was no known tape of the seventh game of the 1960 World Series. Unless you were in Forbes Field that day or was able to watch the live broadcast on television, you did not get to see the game. Until Robert Bader decided to go snooping around Bing Crosby old wine cellar/old film vault.\n\nIt was in December of 2009 that Bader, vice president of marketing and production for Bing Crosby Enterprises, was rummaging through Crosby cache of old film canisters in his wine cellar that he happened upon a gray canister marked “1960 World Series”. He found five canisters, screened the 16-millimeter films and found that they contained the entire broadcast of Game 7 of the 1960 World Series with legendary broadcasters Mel Allen and Bob Prince calling the game.\n\nJump forward to 6 p.m., November 13, 2010 at the Byham Theatre just across the Roberto Clemente Bridge from PNC Park, the Pittsburgh Pirates home these days. With a packed crowd estimated at near 1000 that included movie star Michael Keaton, former Steeler great Franco Harris, current Pirates’ majority owner Bob Nutting and a contingent of 1960 Pirates with their families looking on, the long last film of that famous Game 7 was played to a public audience for the first time.\n\nA phone call from Herald Star publisher Alex Marshall on Friday provided me with the opportunity to be one of those in attendance on Saturday. Alex and I were fortunate enough to be seated with Pirate contingent I the theatre and were guests at the reception held at the Renaissance Hotel just prior to the showing.\n\nGetting the opportunity to speak with the 1960 Pirates on hand along with some of the other dignitaries at the reception and screening was not only a real thrill, but an interesting night of conversation.\n\nMaz was hospitalized a couple days earlier and was unable to attend, but his close friends and former teammates were there with wide smiles and old stories to tell.\n\nBob Friend, who had pitched in two earlier games in the ’60 World Series and was called in to relieve in the ninth, told me that he wished that Maz was there, but more concerned with his health. With all that was going on, our conversation included talk about his many visits to the area with Maz and enjoying ribs at Bill’s in Yorkville. He tapped former Pirate catcher on the knee and told him “Maz took us there a lot and those are the best ribs I’ve ever had.\n\nHe also told me what a special night it was for all of the former Bucs, Telling me that “you relive the memory of the game in your head over and over, but to see it again reminds you things you kind of forgot”.\n\nVera Clemente, the wife of Pirate great Roberto Clemente, was also on hand and did well representing her husband who died in plane crash on New Years in the early 70s just after the season that saw him collect his 3000th and last career hit.\n\n“Roberto loved this city,” she told me and later repeated when called on to talk at the screening. “He really loved playing for the Pirates. They were family to him and family to us. He never wanted to play baseball anywhere else.”\n\nWhen I told her that everyone loved her husband, I her soft, broken voice, she said that he loved every one of his fans too.\n\nAt the Bynam Theatre, not only did the screening of Game 7 take place, but it was part of a special broadcast that was taped for MLB Network. With Bob Costa on hand to host the event, the game was shown in three inning segments before breaking to get comments from some of the former Pirate and 1960 World Series MVP Bobby Richardson of the Yankees. Incidentally, A DVD of the Game 7 will be available for sale on December 15 on the MLBNetwork.com.\n\nAs the program advanced inning-by-inning, it was easy to see that the 1960 Pirates were a team of destiny. And Maz was destined to be the game’s hero.\n\nIn the bottom of the eighth, the Pirates scored five runs to take a 9-7 lead and recorded the third out in the inning with Maz in the on-deck circle.\n\nIn the of the ninth, the Yankees would have had Tony Kubek batting in the inning, but Bill Virdon’s bad-hop ground struck him in the throat in the bottom of the eighth and forced manager Casey Stengel to go to his bench. Later in the frame, Dale Long, who career included a stop-over in Pittsburgh, pinch-hit in the slot, singled to left and eventually advanced to third on a Mickey Mantle hit.\n\nWith Yogi Berra at the plate, Long at third, Mantle at first and just one out, Berra drilled a rocket to first baseman Rocky Nelson. Nelson, who had homered for the Pirates in the first, quickly stepped on first for the second out, but just missed taking Mantle as he alertly dove back to first. Keep in mind, Nelson tags Mantle, game over and Maz’ homer never happens.\n\nIn the hallway after the showing I spoke with Hal Smith, whose three-run home in the bottom of the eighth had give the Bucs a 9-7 lead. I told him the people back home would thank him for setting up Maz’s homerun. He told me that it’s been a long time, but he’s just glad that he played a part in winning the game. Then the aging Bucco catcher told me, “This is all really too much for me. I really need to rest.”\n\nGo ahead and rest Hal Smith, Bill Mazeroski and the rest of the 1960 World Champion Pirates. You did your job. You gave us something on October 13, 1960 that we can continue to talk about for many, many years to come."
