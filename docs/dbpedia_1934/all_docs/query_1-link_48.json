        "text": "He would play two seasons at UD, first under coaching legend Bob Hannah, and then under Hannah’s successor, Jim Sherman. Both seasons ended with conference championships and trips to the NCAA Regionals. In Schneider, UD had “a leader who could make the people around him better,” Hannah recalls. Sherman noticed “the ideal combination” of listening skills, intelligence and “being in the right place at the right time” that would lead Schneider to success.\n\nAs catcher, Schneider’s truly elite skill was his arm. In the 2002 season, he threw out all 29 potential base-stealers who attempted to run against him. But it was a three-game series against Virginia Commonwealth that showcased Schneider’s individual dominance, according to former assistant coach Dan Hammer.\n\n“A runner trying to take second base on Johnny gets thrown out by 15 feet. The next two runners, same thing,” says Hammer, now an admissions counselor at UD. “We didn’t have to hold runners on base the rest of that series. They didn’t want to test Johnny. He was that good.”\n\n“John’s curiosity about the game, his appreciation for it and the players, and his way about him—they all made him a coach in the making,” says Scott. “We started him on this journey; the rest, that’s a credit to John.”\n\n“You’re paying your dues,” Schneider says of his years in the minors. “You’re not making much money. You’re playing on back fields with a few people in the crowd. Bad hotels, bad food. I remember telling my girlfriend at the time, now my wife, Jessy, ‘I know my sacrifices will pay off later.’ I actually said something akin to, ‘There are 30 MLB managers. I think I can be one of those 30.’”\n\nSchneider’s minor-league journey was equal parts lengthy and successful. He managed teams to championships at three competitive levels before being promoted to the Blue Jays’ coaching staff in 2018.\n\nIt had taken 16 years. Finally, Schneider had reached the Majors.\n\nAlthough the storybook ending failed to materialize when the team exited the playoffs in the first round, Schneider remains undaunted. “You can’t please everybody,” he says, “but you stay who you are, and you understand that not every decision works out the way you wanted.”\n\nAwash in responsibility and routine, the MLB manager seldom allows himself time during a season to take stock of his luck or merely enjoy his surroundings. But there are occasional moments, like a batting practice before a home game last fall when his youngest son, Greyson, was shagging fly balls in the outfield as his oldest son, Gunner, stood beside him. A young fan clamored for the attention (and maybe autographs) of Toronto players and coaches, before handing Gunner a marker and asking for his John Hancock.\n\nIt was yet another awestruck moment in a career that has been decades in the making.\n\n“It’s cool to provide that opportunity for them, to raise my boys in a major-league clubhouse,” Schneider says, taking a deep sigh. “This all, sometimes, feels like a dream.”"
