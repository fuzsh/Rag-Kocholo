        "text": "A couple years later, that same kid found himself on the rooftop of his grandparents’ house. Edgar had lived in Barrio Maguayo since he was a baby, raised by his grandparents Mario Salgado and Manuela Rivera after his parents divorced. Now, over a decade later, his parents were back together, and they planned to move the entire family to New York City.\n\nEdgar was having no part of it.\n\n“I was in a real hard situation,” Martinez told The Seattle Times in 2001. “I wasn’t sure what I was doing, but I went with my feelings. I felt my grandparents needed me. I felt it was the right decision.”\n\nAn hour before his parents and siblings were set to leave, Edgar climbed onto the roof, refusing to leave behind the people who’d raised him.\n\n“Now I understand that it was better that way,” his mother, Christina Salgado, told El Nuevo Día. “In New York he wouldn’t have done anything. Maybe he would have studied and worked.\n\n“I’m proud of him for being such a good son (buen hijo), a good human being (buen ser humano), and for being so humble (tan humilde).”\n\nEdgar is as synonymous with “tan humilde” in Dorado as he is with “The Double” in Seattle. He still owns the one-story house he grew up in on Calle 13 — the one-story house where he learned the value of hard work.\n\nMario drove a carro público — a taxi that took customers around town — while Manuela did chores around the house. They didn’t believe in lazy weekends or big egos.\n\n“It was all about respect, strong character and loyalty,” Martinez said. “I think that translated into the way I approached my work. Into the way I approached the game.”\n\nIt translated, alright. Growing up, Edgar was always doing odd jobs. From selling shish kabobs on the sidewalk to working as a cashier at Panadería El Coquí, he earned a reputation for dependability. For self-motivation.\n\n“He was a cashier, but he also baked bread, made pastries,” the bakery owner, Frank Caballero, told ROOT Sports, then called FOX Sports Northwest. “He did everything there was to do here — including mopping.”\n\nAs the years passed and his schedule filled, Edgar grew more and more ingrained in his community.\n\n“What can I say?” Felipe Romiguio, a friend of Manuela’s, said to ROOT. “He was a muchacho del barrio — a local guy who grew up with us here. And for that we’re very proud of him. A simple man — un hombre sencillo.”\n\nHis schedule was anything but sencillo. 19-year-old Edgar would go to school from 6 to 10 p.m., drive to work at General Electric from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m., sleep a few hours, and then practice baseball. He’d play games on the weekends.\n\nHe was busy, but he thrived on being busy. Just like Manuela and Mario. So when the Mariners came calling and he left for Bellingham, Edgar chose to focus on a place 3,738 miles away.\n\n“[My grandparents] knew about my career,” he said. “My cousin would bring them the paper every day. My grandfather’s eyesight was bad so my cousin would read him what I did [on the field]. He was able to appreciate what I was doing.”\n\nWhen Edgar signed his first big contract in 1992, he paid for Manuela’s heart medicine. When his grandparents fell into debt, he bought their home on Calle 13 and remodeled it for them.\n\nHe’d played baseball, he’d made it, and he didn’t forget where he came from.\n\nOn December 19, 1982, Carmelo Oquendo pulled up to the yellow one-story house on Calle 13. Although he was a few minutes early — he had arrived at 7 AM and Edgar wasn’t expected back from work until 7:30 — Oquendo didn’t mind the wait. This was too important.\n\nCarmelo was the general manager of La Central de Dorado, a semi-pro team in Puerto Rico. He’d watched Edgar’s career progress over the years, and believed he had major league potential.\n\nSo on an early December morning in 1982, Oquendo made a decision on Edgar’s behalf.\n\n“The Mariners are having a tryout. Get ready, I’m going to take you there,” Carmelo told Edgar. “Pick up your stuff, let’s go.”\n\nWithout Oquendo, Edgar wouldn’t have even known this tryout existed. Coming off of an eight-hour shift at the factory, the last thing on his mind was a shot at professional baseball, thousands of miles away. But the general manager refused to take no for answer, driving Martinez 30 minutes to Estadio Juan Ramón Loubriel in Bayamón.\n\nBased on the results of Edgar’s first few tryouts, he didn’t feel overwhelmingly confident.\n\n“I found out later that [previous scouts] were looking for more power, more speed, and more strength in the arms — which I never had,” he said. “They just didn’t look into other skills. Skills like accuracy, feel for the game, a different type of hitter besides power.”\n\nHe added: “Those are the skills that Marty Martínez saw.”\n\nMarty Martínez was a scout for the Mariners at the time. Nicknamed “Baseball Marty” by former manager Chuck Cottier, he served countless roles in the organization. For more than a decade, Marty was an interim major league manager, a major league coach, a minor league manager, a minor league coach, a scout and a supervisor of Latin American scouting.\n\nMarty was honest — sometimes brazenly so. He wasn’t afraid to butt heads with other scouts.\n\n“He didn’t impress easily,” said Tulsa World writer Barry Lewis, who met Marty when he managed the Tulsa Drillers. “If he vouched that a guy could play, it carried extra weight. He looked beyond home runs, RBI and batting average.”\n\nLuckily for Edgar, Marty was impressed.\n\n“I liked his bat, of course,” he said to The Seattle Times. “I liked his hands. He threw the ball so accurately. A little bit of a funny motion but [he threw it] perfectly to first base, all the time.”\n\nBy the end of the tryout, Marty and fellow scout Coco Laboy were between two players: Edgar and a catcher. They could only offer a contract to one. Marty vouched for Edgar, so Edgar got the contract.\n\n“I never did listen much to other scouts,” he said to The Seattle Times. “I had my own ideas on things.”\n\nMarty’s impact would transcend that tryout. He became an advocate of Edgar’s throughout his entire career. When Edgar averaged .173 in Single-A Bellingham, Marty convinced Mariners GM Hal Keller to move him to the instructional league in Arizona. When Edgar was bouncing between AAA Calgary and the Mariners, Marty kept telling him not to be discouraged — to be patient.\n\n“He was a father figure to me, to all of us,” Edgar said. “He taught us how to behave, all of the things you need to do to succeed. He protected me.”\n\nThirty-seven years after that December tryout, Edgar still knows how many potential roadblocks he encountered on his road to the majors, and how Marty guided him through them all.\n\n“Organizations are always evaluating if you should move up to the next level,” he said. “Marty advocating for me was huge, because I don’t think a lot of people saw me the way he did.”\n\nMarty advocated for Edgar, so now Edgar advocates for young players in Puerto Rico. He returns to Dorado and teaches the next generation how to stay inside the ball, how to be patient at the plate, how to hit to the opposite field. He paid for the college education of Kevin Robles, a former Mariners minor league catcher from Dorado, and helped train him.\n\nEdgar does this quietly. It’s not about attention. It’s about returning the favor. (devolverle el favor a la próxima generación.)\n\nAfter the tryout, Carmelo Martinez met up with his cousin for a literal (and figurative) game of ping pong. As a tiny white ball whizzed back and forth across the table, they discussed Edgar’s future.\n\nOn Edgar’s side was pragmatism. He was getting a college education, had a well-paying job, had his whole family in Dorado. Why would he risk that for a $4,000 signing bonus?\n\nOn Carmelo’s side was idealism. Carmelo had seen how American ballplayers hit. He’d seen how Edgar hit. He gave the edge to Edgar.\n\nNevertheless, it was a tough sell.\n\n“When we were growing up, Edgar hit rocks with a broomstick,” Carmelo said. “He made things look easy. I told him he was a better hitter than the [minor leaguers] I saw in the states. He really didn’t want to sign. I kind of pushed him a little bit, and he finally gave up. And I’m glad he did.”\n\nCarmelo and Edgar’s childhood sounds like a baseball Cinderella story. Growing up together in Dorado, they played every day, rain or shine. They’d hit anything they could get their hands on — bottle caps, stones, large raindrops from a gutter — taking as many as three or four thousand swings a day.\n\n“When he was younger, the main thing I tried to teach him was to hit the ball to right field as a left-handed batter,” Carmelo told ROOT. “In baseball, if you can go to the opposite field more times than you can pull the ball, you got a shot in the big leagues.”\n\nCarmelo was often referred to as an unsung hero of the Padres’ first postseason run in 1984. He passed that attitude along to his cousin as he traveled through the minors.\n\n“I always told him, ‘Let people talk about you,’” Carmelo said. “‘You don’t have to say anything. Just produce.’ He’s a quiet guy who keeps his head down. But he did a lot of damage.”\n\nIf Clemente is Edgar’s hero, and Marty was his father-figure, Carmelo Martinez is his mentor.\n\n“I felt pretty good at the time about where I was going,” Edgar said. “I felt like taking a chance for a low amount of money was taking a risk. Carmelo was the one who convinced me.”\n\nOn Sunday, July 21, in Cooperstown, Carmelo Martinez will be sitting front and center at the Clark Sports Center as his close friend — compadre — walks across the induction stage. The perfect ending to a historia de Cenicienta — a Cinderella story.\n\nCalgary Cannons owner/president Russ Parker needed a third baseman. Spring training for the 1987 season was rapidly approaching, and Jamie Allen wasn’t getting any healthier. The Cannons were a new franchise — their inaugural season was two years earlier — but attendance was already high. Parker wanted to keep it that way.\n\nSo he asked his farm director, Bill Haywood, to find a replacement.\n\n“I got ya a third baseman,” Haywood told Parker. “Don’t expect much. He’s a pretty good glove but you’re not gonna get much offense out of him.”\n\nNeedless to say, Calgary got plenty of offense.\n\n“I think it was a big jump for Edgar, coming up from Double A,” Parker said. “He wasn’t tearing up the league there. But we needed a third baseman, so it was a bit of a break for him.”\n\nEdgar took his break and ran with it. He’d batted .264 the season before, not cracking the .300 threshold he was accustomed to. What he lacked in offense he made up for with his glove, earning a .960 fielding percentage — tops among all third basemen in the Southern League.\n\nBut 1987 was a turning point. Everything clicked.\n\n“I felt like I was getting close to the big leagues,” Edgar said. “I struggled a bit in Double A. In Calgary, everything came together. It was a confirmation that if I can hit here, I’m going to hit anywhere. In the minor leagues you have to make some adjustments. I was able to make those in Triple A.”\n\nEdgar embraced Calgary and Calgary embraced Edgar. He was there during the golden years of their franchise — the years of Vizquel, Valle and Buhner.\n\n“He was a part of a team you don’t often see at the Triple A level,” said Mark Stephen, a former Cannons broadcaster. “The Mariners affiliates of 1985 to ’94 produced a heck of a lot of big leaguers. Not only that, but Seattle was the closest MLB team we had. We got the Blue Jays on TV, but that’s not quite the same as going to a game.”\n\nEdgar gave Cannons fans a lot to root for. Through the first 129 games of the 1987 season, he batted .327 with 31 doubles and 10 home runs. The Mariners called him up for their last 13 games. The following year he won the Pacific Coast League batting title. Seattle came calling again.\n\nDespite his success, the back-and-forth wasn’t easy — especially after nearly 7 years in the minor leagues. But Edgar had faith in his ability. He knew he’d make it, it was just a matter of when.\n\n“He was sent down on two occasions,” said Parker. “The players were allowed 72 hours to report once they returned to Triple A. I’ve known other players who took as much time as they possibly could, and didn’t come back with a very good attitude. Edgar was just the opposite of that.\n\n“He would be on the field the next afternoon. I don’t even know how he got there that fast. But he wasted absolutely no time.”\n\nThe third and final time he was called up was in 1989. The hard work paid off. Edgar Martinez was in the majors for good.\n\nIn 2015, Russ Parker and his family came to Tacoma to watch the U.S. Open golf tournament. The night before the event they attended a Mariners game.\n\n“I always like to get there early. We were looking down on the field, and there’s Edgar,” Parker said. “I didn’t know why he would be there.”\n\nHe wandered down to the field to say hello, where he was promptly informed by an usher that he wouldn’t be able to speak with any of the Mariners personnel.\n\n“We got talkin’ away, and [the usher] looked around and said, ‘You know what, go ahead,’” Parker said. “So I went down to the backstop area. He was close enough that I could yell at him.”\n\nEdgar came over and visited with his former GM, reminiscing on their days in Calgary. Eighteen seasons later, his reputation was all that changed.\n\n“I’ll always remember our farm director saying, ‘Got ya a third baseman — don’t expect much,’” Parker said with a laugh.\n\nIt’s laughable, in retrospect: how a Hall of Fame caliber player could be so underrated for so long. Edgar’s now exceeded all the expectations he can possibly exceed. His moment in the sun is finally here.\n\nEdgar Martinez got the call on Jan. 22, 2019 at 5:18 p.m. He was in a Manhattan hotel, surrounded by his immediate family. In typical Edgar fashion, he was stoic. He calmly expressed his gratitude six times, smiling quietly as BBWAA Secretary-Treasurer Jack O’Connell turned the phone over to Hall of Fame Chairman Jane Forbes Clark.\n\nMario and Manuela would have wanted him to check his ego at the door. So even after he secured a spot in baseball’s hallowed ground, there would be no showboating.\n\nCarmelo Martinez got the news one time zone and 1,610 miles away. He was managing a game for Los Cangrejeros de Santurce, a Puerto Rican professional baseball team, in San Juan’s Estadio Hiram Bithorn. The game stopped, the players cleared the field, and everyone stood for a special announcement: Edgar Martinez, Dorado’s adopted son, was going to Cooperstown.\n\nDave Niehaus’ voice boomed through the loudspeakers of Hiram Bithorn as the video board operator replayed “The Double” for all to see. It was followed by about 10 minutes of congratulations — felicidades — on the big screen by everyone from Iván Rodríguez and Carlos Beltrán to Tony Peréz and Francisco Lindor.\n\nThree time zones and 3,442 miles from San Juan, former Calgary Cannons employees and media gathered at a local baseball academy. Russ Parker and Mark Stephen sat around the TV in heightened silence, flanked by former Cannons jerseys, bats and balls. When Hall of Fame President Jeff Idelson uttered the name “Edgar,” the group erupted into applause, celebrating the storybook ending of a career they knew was destined for greatness.\n\n“We were all pretty excited,” Parker said. “Somebody said, ‘You must feel like a proud papa.’ I guess I felt something like that. It’s special for a lot of fans here.”"
