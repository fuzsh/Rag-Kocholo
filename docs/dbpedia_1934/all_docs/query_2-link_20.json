        "text": "The Royals join Major League Baseball and fans across the nation in celebrating “Opening Day at Home” today, the scheduled start of the 2020 season.\n\nWhile we all wish live baseball games were being played, Major League Baseball is making the best of this opportunity, given the circumstances, by making 30 games nationally available today across various platforms. The experience is intended to invite fans to feel a sense of community and unity on a day many were looking forward to while underscoring the importance of staying home and staying healthy.\n\nOn Thursday night at 5:05 p.m. CT, Royals fans can watch Game 5 of the 2015 World Series, in which the Royals clinched their second title in franchise history at Citi Field in New York. The game will air on royals.com and Las Mayores Twitter.\n\nWhile we wait to re-live the championship-clinching game, let’s take a few minutes to revisit some of the most exciting Opening Day games and achievements in Royals history.\n\nOn Opening Day 2019, the Royals defeated the White Sox, 5–3, a win that was fueled by 7.0 two-hit, shutout innings by Brad Keller. At 23 years, 244 days old, Keller became the youngest Major League starter to win on Opening Day since José Fernández (21.243) in 2014, and the youngest in the American League since Félix Hernández (22.363) in 2009. Keller also became the youngest in the Majors to record 7.0 innings and allow two hits or fewer on Opening Day since Bob Feller’s no-hitter (21.165) at the White Sox in 1940.\n\nAlex Gordon made his 12th Opening Day start in 2019, matching Amos Otis for fourth most in team history, trailing only George Brett (18), Frank White (15) and Hal McRae (13). Gordon has started each of the last nine Opening Day games for the Royals, matching Brett (1975–83) for the third-longest streak in Royals history, trailing only White (15, 1976–90) and McRae (12, 1973–84).\n\nEight of Gordon’s 12 Opening Day starts have come in left field, more than any other player at that position in Royals history:\n\nMost Opening Day starts by position:\n\nPitcher: Kevin Appier (7)\n\nCatcher: Mike Macfarlane/Salvador Perez (5)\n\nFirst Base: John Mayberry/Mike Sweeney (6)\n\nSecond Base: Frank White (15)\n\nThird Base: George Brett (12)\n\nShortstop: Fred Patek (8)\n\nLeft Field: Alex Gordon (8)\n\nCenter Field: Amos Otis (11)\n\nRight Field: Danny Tartabull (5)\n\nDesignated Hitter: Hal McRae (10)\n\nOf the Royals’ 51 previous Opening Day games, three have ended with walk-off wins, including the Royals’ inaugural game at Municipal Stadium vs. Minnesota on April 8, 1969. Kansas City won its first game in 12 innings on a walk-off single by Joe Keough.\n\nThe Royals also won on Opening Day in walk-off fashion in 1972 on a John Mayberry single in the 11th inning vs. the White Sox, and on a Carlos Beltran two-run homer to cap a six-run ninth inning in 2004 vs. the White Sox.\n\nHere are a few Opening Day team records:\n\nMost runs scored: 11 in 1979 vs. Toronto\n\nMost hits: 14 in 1969 vs. Minnesota\n\nMost home runs: three in 2004 vs. Chicago and in 1983 at Baltimore\n\nThirty six different players have homered on Opening Day in a Royals uniform, but none have done so twice in the same game. George Brett had a club-record four career Opening Day dingers, followed by two from Frank White, Hal McRae, Alex Gordon, Mike Moustakas and John Mayberry.\n\nThe warmest Opening Day in Royals history came on March 31, 1998, when the Royals defeated the Orioles in Baltimore on a 91-degree day at Camden Yards. The warmest Opening Day in Kansas City came on April 2, 2007, when the Royals beat Boston 7–1 on an 80-degree day at Kauffman Stadium.\n\nOn the flip side, Kansas City’s coldest Opening Day at home came on March 31, 2011, in which the game time temperature was just 45 degrees.\n\nTwo Royals starting pitchers have gone the distance on Opening Day, including Dick Drago, who allowed just one unearned run in the team’s first game of the 1971 season, a 4–1 win at California. Drago also threw a complete game in a 2–1 win vs. the White Sox in the following season’s opening game in 1972. Two seasons later, Paul Splittorff took a tough-luck complete game loss in a 6–4 setback to begin the season vs. Minnesota.\n\nBud Black is the only Royals pitcher to win twice on Opening Day, as he earned the win in the season opener in both 1984 and 1985.\n\nKevin Appier started a Royals-record seven Opening Day games, three more than Dennis Leonard. Appier went just 1–4 in those seven starts, despite a 3.69 ERA (16 ER in 39.0 IP).\n\nThe Royals are just 18–33 in their 51-year history on Opening Day, but they’ve won three of the last five, including a 4–3 win vs. the Mets in 2016 that followed a ring ceremony to celebrate franchise’s 2015 World Series win."
