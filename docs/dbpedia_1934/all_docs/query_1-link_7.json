        "text": "Major League Baseball has hired five regional supervisors to handle coordinating the many daily details for all 11 affiliated full-season leagues.\n\nThe five regional supervisors come from a variety of backgrounds, including a former league president, a former farm director, two former minor league general managers and a former minor league player.\n\nThe regional supervisors will be responsible for handling the day-to-day issues that arise among teams and leagues throughout the season and offseason.\n\nPreviously, many of these responsibilities had been handled by league presidents and league offices, but those were eliminated in the switch of governance of the minors from Minor League Baseball to MLB.\n\nRonnie Richardson will be the supervisor for Triple-A East and Double-A South. Augusto “Cookie” Rojas will be responsible for Double-A Central and High-A Central. Kim Parker will be the supervisor for Triple-A West, Low-A West and High-A West. Eric Krupa will be responsible for Low-A Southeast and High-A Mid-Atlantic. Ronnie Glenn will be supervising Double-A Northeast and Low-A East.\n\nRichardson had served as the farm director for the Braves and the Royals. Parker comes to the role after two decades working with the Burlington Bees, most recently as the general manager for the past three years.\n\nRojas was the general manager of the Triple-A New Orleans Baby Cakes from 2016-2019 and the senior vice president of sports & entertainment ventures with Triple-A Wichita in 2020. Krupa was the president of the South Atlantic League for the past 13 years.\n\nGlenn was a minor league player in the Angels organization from 2015-2017. According to his LinkedIn page he was working as a relationship manager for Congress Wealth Management, LLC before taking the new role with MLB."
