        "text": "During the 18 seasons he performed in the majors, left-hander Claude Osteen pitched 40 regular-season shutouts, the same total as Sandy Koufax and more than Lefty Grove (35) and Lefty Gomez (28).\n\nThat doesn’t count the unofficial shutout Osteen crafted for the Cardinals.\n\nFifty years ago, on Aug. 15, 1974, the Cardinals acquired Osteen from the Astros for minor-league pitcher Ron Selak and a player to be named (another pitching prospect, Dan Larson).\n\nRusty from inactivity and unable to find a groove, Osteen didn’t produce a win for the contending Cardinals, but he did deliver a special performance in a remarkable game.\n\nEntering in the 14th inning, Osteen held the Mets scoreless until the 23rd _ 9.1 innings, or basically the equivalent of a complete game. Though he departed with the score still tied, the Cardinals eventually won in the 25th.\n\nPrep phenom\n\nOsteen was born in Caney Springs, Tennessee, a hamlet 45 miles south of Nashville. As The Tennessean newspaper noted, “Almost everybody who lives in Caney Springs is kin to Osteen.”\n\nGrowing up there, he played baseball in cow pastures, learned to throw a curve and advanced to a 4-H Club team when he was 12. At 14, he moved with his family to Cincinnati, where his father took a job with General Electric.\n\nPitching for Reading High School, Osteen was 29-3 in three varsity seasons, including 16-0 as a senior in 1957 when his team became state champions.\n\nThough his high school coach scouted for the Dodgers, who made an offer, Osteen accepted a contract with the Reds on July 2, 1957. “I signed with Cincinnati for several reasons,” Osteen told the Nashville Banner. “My folks wanted me to, for one. Besides, (the Reds) promised me I could stay with the club for a while instead of going right out to the minors.”\n\n(Cardinals general manager Frank Lane said to the Cincinnati Enquirer, “We were interested in Osteen, but not to the extent of … putting him on our roster.”)\n\nMajor step up\n\nFour days after signing, Osteen, 17, made his big-league debut against the Cardinals at Cincinnati. Si Burick of the Dayton Daily News described him as a skinny southpaw, “his cap cocked on the side of his head,” who “doesn’t look strong enough to throw the ball to the plate.”\n\nAccording to Earl Lawson of The Cincinnati Post, Reds pitcher Art Fowler, 35, took one look at Osteen warming up and said, “My son can throw harder than he can.”\n\nCardinals backup catcher Walker Cooper, 42, told Osteen, “Little Leaguers are supposed to pitch from 40 feet out,” Lawson reported.\n\nEntering in the seventh inning with two on, one out and St. Louis ahead, 10-3, Osteen faced five batters. He retired two, walked one, gave up two singles, threw a wild pitch and yielded a run. “A lot of fun,” he told the Enquirer. “I was a little nervous and I thought I might have been worse than I was, but it was a thrill.” Boxscore\n\n(Catching the rookie from Caney Springs, Tennessee, that day was Ed Bailey from Strawberry Plains, Tennessee.)\n\nThe next day, Osteen faced the Cardinals again and pitched a scoreless ninth. Boxscore\n\nHaving fulfilled their pledge to let Osteen experience the big leagues, the Reds sent him to their Nashville farm club managed by Dick Sisler, the former Cardinal. Called back in September, Osteen made one scoreless relief appearance against the Cubs, striking out Ernie Banks with the bases loaded. Boxscore\n\nGood moves\n\nOsteen spent most of the next two seasons (1958-59) in the minors. Primarily a reliever with the 1960 Reds, he had a 5.03 ERA and was demoted the next year.\n\nOsteen never got a win for the Reds. Other pitching prospects, Jim Maloney and Jim O’Toole, advanced ahead of him. In the book “We Played the Game,” O’Toole said, “I didn’t let anybody push me around like they did Claude Osteen. He’d throw what the catcher wanted instead of his best pitches and get hit hard.”\n\nIn September 1961, with the Reds on their way to winning the pennant, Osteen, 22, was traded to the Washington Senators, an American League expansion team. The Senators finished in last place in each of Osteen’s first three seasons with them (1961-63) but he got to start regularly and figured out how to survive.\n\n“The big difference in my pitching now and when I was in the minors and with the Reds is I no longer try to strike out a lot of guys,” Osteen told the Nashville Banner in July 1962. “I realize I can’t strike out everybody up here. So I’m just trying to make them hit a bad pitch and let my fielders do some work.”\n\nOsteen’s breakout season came in 1964 when he won 15 for the ninth-place Senators (62-100). Afterward, the Dodgers acquired him in a deal that sent slugger Frank Howard to Washington. The move vaulted Osteen from baseball’s basement into a starting rotation with Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale.\n\nHollywood material\n\nWhen he joined the Dodgers, Osteen’s teammates nicknamed him Gomer because they thought he resembled actor Jim Nabors, who played the character of Gomer Pyle on “The Andy Griffith Show” (1962-64) and then on “Gomer Pyle: USMC” (1964-69). “One day, Jim Nabors comes to the clubhouse and we start talking about all that downhome stuff _ he’s from Alabama _ and doggoned if we didn’t become good friends,” Osteen told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nOsteen (15 wins, 2.79 ERA) joined Koufax (26 wins, 2.04) and Drysdale (23 wins, 2.77) in forming a formidable top of the rotation for the 1965 Dodgers, who dethroned the Cardinals as National League champions.\n\nAfter the Twins beat Drysdale and Koufax in the first two games of the World Series, Osteen turned the tide with a shutout in Game 3. The Dodgers went on to win the title in seven games. “If Claude hadn’t beaten us in that third game, we’d be the world champions,” Twins first baseman Don Mincher told The Tennessean. Boxscore\n\nThe Dodgers repeated as National League champions in 1966 (Osteen won 17 and had a 2.85 ERA) but were swept by the Orioles in the World Series. In Game 3, Osteen allowed one run in seven innings but Wally Bunker pitched a shutout and the Orioles won, 1-0. Boxscore\n\nOsteen was a 20-game winner for the Dodgers in 1969 and again in 1972. He had double-digit wins in each of his nine seasons with them. “He is as dependable as sunset,” Jim Murray wrote in the Los Angeles Times.\n\nDodgers manager Walter Alston told The Tennessean, “There’s not a more reliable guy around … He gets about as much out of his stuff as anybody in the majors.”\n\nIn 1973, Osteen was 16-6 for the first-place Dodgers with one month remaining in the season, but he lost his last five decisions and the club went 12-14 in September, finishing second to the Reds. Afterward, he was traded to the Astros for outfielder Jim Wynn.\n\nHouston, we have a problem\n\nOsteen was the Astros’ first $100,000 salary player and was expected to make them contenders. [The highest-paid player in 1974 was White Sox slugger Dick Allen at $233,000, according to the Miami Herald. Leading the 1974 Cardinals: Bob Gibson ($160,000), Joe Torre ($140,000), Lou Brock ($110,000).]\n\nOne of the foes Osteen did best against in 1974 was the Cardinals. He beat them with a complete game in May and did it again in July. Osteen entered the all-star break at 9-7 with a 3.15 ERA. Boxscore and Boxscore\n\nThough his fastball wasn’t sinking, and his curve and slider were hanging, “I was winning mostly on know-how and moving the ball around,” Osteen told The Sporting News.\n\nFollowing the break, Osteen started twice and got shelled. He didn’t appear in a game for the next 17 days. “It was a very frustrating thing for me to find myself sitting on a bench,” Osteen told The Tennessean.\n\nOn Aug. 15, in a game against the Cubs, Osteen was told to get ready to relieve J.R. Richard. While Osteen warmed up, manager Preston Gomez waved for him to come to the dugout. “That’s when he took me aside and told me the deal had been made” with the Cardinals, Osteen told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\n\nStranger things\n\nThe first-place Cardinals projected Osteen, 35, as a replacement for ailing starter Sonny Siebert. Cardinals general manager Bing Devine “told me he had not bought my contract merely to have me help them finish out the 1974 season,” Osteen said to The Tennessean. “He said he thought I had a couple of more good years. I agree with him.”\n\nIn his Cardinals debut, a start against the Braves, Osteen couldn’t protect a 5-0 lead and was lifted in the fourth. For the 14th time in his career, Hank Aaron hit a home run against Osteen, sparking the Braves’ comeback. Boxscore\n\nMoved to the bullpen, Osteen was used mostly in mop-up roles. As a starter, he’d developed a rhythm, knowing he’d pitch every four days. This was different.\n\n“I had no idea how to go about being a reliever,” Osteen said to United Press International. “I didn’t know how to warm up, how long to warm up, how to get used to sitting around, waiting so much. At first, I found I was wearing myself out getting up and down (and) throwing.”\n\nOne and done\n\nIn a game against the Mets, Cardinals manager Red Schoendienst turned to Osteen in the 14th inning. Pitching like he had in his prime with the Dodgers, Osteen held the Mets scoreless until being relieved by Siebert with two outs in the 23rd. The Cardinals won in the 25th when Bake McBride scored from first base on a wild pickoff throw.\n\nOsteen’s line: 9.1 innings, no runs, four hits, two walks. Boxscore\n\nThat was Osteen’s highlight as a Cardinal. He made eight appearances for them and was 0-2 with a 4.37 ERA. Osteen called the 1974 season “a totally lost year” and “confusing,” the Post-Dispatch reported.\n\nAt Cardinals spring training in 1975, Osteen was “a prime candidate for the job as No. 5 starter,” according to the Post-Dispatch.\n\nThe Cardinals, though, had acquired another veteran left-hander, Ray Sadecki, 35.\n\nOsteen posted a 3.91 ERA in 23 innings during spring training. Sadecki had a 9.00 ERA in 13.2 innings, but the Cardinals opted to keep him and release Osteen. Sadecki is “used to coming out of the bullpen,” Red Schoendienst explained to the Post-Dispatch.\n\nCardinals coach\n\nAthletics owner Charlie Finley said a deal to sign Osteen “is virtually completed,” the Oakland Tribune reported, but the White Sox swept in and got him instead.\n\nOsteen, 36, made 37 starts for the 1975 White Sox but lost 16 of 23 decisions in his final season. His career record: 196-195, 3.30 ERA.\n\nOsteen bought a chicken farm near Hershey, Pa. During the 1976 baseball season, he was pitching coach for the Phillies’ farm club in Reading, Pa.\n\nIn October 1976, the Cardinals hired Vern Rapp to replace Red Schoendienst as manager. Osteen was surprised when Bing Devine called, asking him to meet with Rapp in New York during the 1976 World Series to discuss the Cardinals’ pitching coach job.\n\n“I had never met Rapp,” Osteen said to The Tennessean. “I spent about three hours with Vern, talking about pitching. Before we finished, he picked up the telephone and called Bing and told him I was the man he wanted.”\n\nOsteen spent four seasons (1977-80) as Cardinals pitching coach. He had the same job with the Phillies (1982-88), Rangers (1993-94), Dodgers (1999-2000). Three Phillies pitchers won Cy Young awards with Osteen as their coach _ Steve Carlton (1982), John Denny (1983) and Steve Bedrosian (1987).\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nPitcher Nelson Chittum never spent a full season in the majors, but during his time there he mingled with the sport’s aristocracy. For example:\n\n_ In his big-league debut with the Cardinals, he got a start against the Dodgers and was opposed by Sandy Koufax.\n\n_ In parts of three seasons in the majors, Chittum was a teammate of Stan Musial and Ted Williams. Chittum and Musial were road roommates for a while with the Cardinals. Then, with the Red Sox, Williams delivered a hit that helped set up Chittum to earn his first win.\n\n_ In his best game as a Cardinal, Chittum struck out a pair of future Hall of Famers, Roberto Clemente and Bill Mazeroski.\n\nIn 40 big-league appearances, Chittum was 3-1 with a 3.84 ERA. Most of his professional career was spent as a starter in the minors. He was 91 when he died on July 15, 2024.\n\nPitching prospect\n\nChittum moved with his family from Harrisonburg, Va., to Elizabethtown, Pa., about 20 miles from the state capital of Harrisburg, as a youth.\n\nA right-handed pitcher, he threw two perfect games in high school. After he graduated in 1951, Chittum was approached by the Cardinals but opted instead to attend Elizabethtown College, according to the Elizabethtown Chronicle.\n\nAfter two seasons of college baseball for coach Ira R. Herr, Chittum, 20, was signed by Cardinals scout Fred “Dutch” Dorman in October 1953. A week later, he was inducted into the U.S. Army and served for two years.\n\nAt 23, Chittum made his professional debut with the Cardinals’ Fresno farm club in the California League in 1956. A lanky sinkerball specialist, Chittum posted a 23-7 record in the regular season and pitched 266 innings. He earned three more wins in the playoffs, giving him a total of 26 for the year.\n\nPromoted to the Cardinals’ Houston farm club, managed by Harry Walker, in 1957, Chittum was 16-12, developing a slider taught to him by pitching instructor Johnny Grodzicki.\n\n“Nels is a low ball pitcher,” Houston general manager Art Routzong said to United Press. “He’s real tough and he’s got marvelous control until he lets loose with a high one. He’s hard to hit, real hard, when he keeps that ball down.”\n\nHouston catcher Ray Dabek told the wire service, “You ought to get behind the screen and watch his ball move. He’s really got something on it. He has a good fastball that sort of sinks, and a good slider. Real good.”\n\nBig-league debut\n\nAfter compiling a 12-8 record and 2.84 ERA for manager Johnny Keane’s Omaha farm team in 1958, Chittum, 25, was called up to the Cardinals in August that year and given a start against Koufax and the Dodgers at Los Angeles.\n\nKoufax, 22, was not yet the dominant ace he would become later with the Dodgers. He entered the start with a season record of 9-5 and a 4.19 ERA.\n\nThe first two Cardinals batters of the game, Curt Flood and Gene Freese, hit home runs against Koufax. The Cardinals totaled four runs in the inning.\n\nStaked to the 4-0 lead, Chittum held the Dodgers scoreless in the first two innings. Koufax was taken out in the second.\n\nThe Cardinals made it 5-0 when Chittum got his first big-league hit, a single against Babe Birrer that scored catcher Gene Green from second.\n\nChittum, however, was unable to hold down the Dodgers, in part, because of poor fielding by his teammates. With two outs in the third, the Dodgers scored on a Gil Hodges bloop single “which Freese lost in the sun and which should, instead, have been taken in short left by Del Ennis,” the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. A Chittum balk brought in the Dodgers’ second run of the inning, cutting the St. Louis lead to 5-2.\n\nIn the fourth, the Cardinals scored three times, extending the lead to 8-2, but the Dodgers knocked out Chittum before he could retire a batter in the bottom half of the inning. Ken Boyer let a Charlie Neal grounder go over his shoulder for a fluke single. Two more singles followed, loading the bases. Carl Furillo, batting for reliever Fred Kipp, then doubled, driving in all three runners and making the score 8-5. After Jim Gilliam bunted for a single, Jim Brosnan relieved Chittum.\n\nBrosnan limited the Dodgers to one run in six innings and got the win. Boxscore\n\nSt. Louis shakeup\n\nChittum next made two relief appearances for the Cardinals. The best of those outings was when he pitched 4.1 scoreless innings against the Pirates, including strikeouts of Clemente and Mazeroski. Boxscore\n\nThree nights later, in the series finale versus the Pirates, Chittum started. He gave up three runs (a Dick Stuart solo home run and a two-run shot by Bob Skinner) in three innings and was the losing pitcher. Boxscore\n\nChittum pitched in nine more games, all in relief, for the 1958 Cardinals. According to the Spokane Spokesman-Review, the quiet rookie roomed with Musial on a couple of road trips.\n\nWith 10 games remaining, Cardinals general manager Bing Devine, on orders from club owner Gussie Busch, fired manager Fred Hutchinson.\n\nA month later, with new manager Solly Hemus, the Cardinals traveled to Japan for a goodwill tour. Chittum opted not to go because he had committed to playing winter baseball in the Dominican Republic. “Maybe I missed my chance to impress (Hemus) in Japan,” Chittum told the Minneapolis Star Tribune, “but I know I didn’t stand much chance in the St. Louis organization.”\n\nMoving on\n\nAt 1959 spring training, Cardinals pitcher Sal Maglie (who would become an instructor that season) said Chittum needed to develop a better curve to stay in the majors, the Elizabethtown Chronicle reported. Then, on March 15, 1959, Chittum was traded to the Red Sox for pitcher Dean Stone.\n\nThe Red Sox assigned Chittum to their farm team at Minneapolis, managed by Gene Mauch, who told the Star Tribune. “Nels … was one of the best right-handers in our league last year (with Omaha). He beat the top clubs.” One of those wins was a shutout against Minneapolis and Stone.\n\nRed Sox farm director Johnny Murphy, a former Yankees reliever, noticed a flaw in Chittum’s delivery and worked with him to correct it. “When I let the ball go, it was traveling up instead of down, and it was taking all my stuff off,” Chittum told the Elizabethtown Chronicle. “John changed my motion so that now when I release the ball it travels in a downward arc.”\n\nChittum was 11-5 for Minneapolis when the Red Sox called him up for the last two months of the 1959 season.\n\nOn Aug. 28, 1959, the Orioles led the Red Sox, 4-2, in the seventh when Ted Williams, batting for catcher Sammy White, doubled, scoring Frank Malzone from second and getting Boston within a run at 4-3. Chittum entered in the eighth, pitched three scoreless innings and got the win, his first in the majors, when the Red Sox rallied. Boxscore\n\nIn September, Chittum got two more wins, beating the Indians and Senators. He finished 3-0 with a 1.19 ERA for the 1959 Red Sox. Chittum allowed earned runs in just two of 21 appearances and no one hit a home run against him.\n\nNo vacancies\n\nSal Maglie replaced Boo Ferriss as Red Sox pitching coach in 1960.\n\nOn April 6, on their way from spring training in St. Petersburg, Fla., to San Francisco to open the 1960 season at the new Candlestick Park, the Cardinals stopped in Scottsdale, Ariz., for an exhibition game against the Red Sox. Chittum, in relief of Bill Monbouquette, pitched 1.2 innings against his former team and gave up one run. Ted Williams had two singles in three at-bats but was upstaged by Stan Musial, whose three-run home run versus Ted Bowsfield in the eighth carried the Cardinals to a 13-10 victory.\n\n(Asked on a 1962 questionnaire to name his biggest thrill in baseball, Chittum answered, “It has to be being teammates with two of the all-time great players _ Stan Musial and Ted Williams,” the Spokane Spokesman-Review reported.)\n\nChittum began the 1960 season with the Red Sox but on May 6 was traded to the Dodgers for Rip Repulski, the former Cardinal, and assigned to the minors. (In his first at-bat for the Red Sox, Repulski hit a grand slam. Boxscore)\n\nChittum never returned to the majors. In 1961, he was “packed and almost out the door” on his way to the Angels, an American League expansion club, but at the last moment the Dodgers reconsidered, the Elizabethtown Chronicle reported.\n\nAfter pitching his last season for Rochester in 1964, Chittum managed a men’s clothing store and then became a U.S. postal inspector.\n\nIn February 1965, baseball innovator Bill Veeck told a banquet audience in Lancaster, Pa., he wanted to see interleague play, the elimination of the intentional walk, and a designated hitter for the pitcher.\n\nAsked his opinion of a designated hitter, Chittum told the Lancaster New Era, “That’s a bunch of baloney … That would take the fun out of it. It’d be like telling some guys on a basketball team they had to play defense and couldn’t shoot.”\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nJohn Lackey was a big guy (6-foot-6) with a big presence on the mound who often came up big in the biggest games.\n\nTen years ago, on July 31, 2014, the Cardinals acquired Lackey from the Red Sox for outfielder Allen Craig and pitcher Joe Kelly. The Red Sox also sent the Cardinals a minor-league pitcher, Corey Littrell, and $1.75 million cash.\n\nJust nine months earlier with the Red Sox, Lackey beat the Cardinals in the decisive Game 6 of the 2013 World Series, making him the first pitcher to start and win the clinching game of a World Series for two franchises. As an Angels rookie, he started and won Game 7 of the 2002 World Series against the Giants.\n\nDavid Eckstein, shortstop for two World Series champions (2002 Angels, 2006 Cardinals), said to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch about Lackey, “The bigger the stage, the better the performance. The bigger the game, the better he is.”\n\nLackey’s success in big games was an obvious quality that appealed to the Cardinals. Another was his demeanor. On the mound, Lackey was intense, edgy. Or, as Cubs catcher David Ross described it to the Chicago Tribune, full of “competitive fire.” The Cardinals would benefit from that kind of approach.\n\nPitching provides path\n\nLackey, naturally, came from a big state _ Texas. He was born and raised in Abilene. In high school, Lackey played almost exclusively at first base and hit .541 as a senior.\n\nHe went to the University of Texas-Arlington as a first baseman, but also was given the chance to pitch his freshman season. Then he enrolled at Grayson College in Denison, Texas, where he planned to play one season before transferring to Texas Tech.\n\nAt Grayson, Lackey, a right-hander, developed his pitching skills. “I like it a lot,” he told the Abilene News-Reporter in May 1999. “It gives me a chance to be in control of the game. It’s been fun so far. I still like to hit, though.”\n\nGrayson won the national junior college baseball championship in 1999 and Lackey canceled his plans of transferring to Texas Tech when the Angels selected him in the second round of the 1999 amateur draft.\n\nThree years later, in June 2002, he made his Angels debut, replacing Scott Schoeneweis in the starting rotation.\n\nRookie won’t rattle\n\nLackey, 23, made 18 regular-season starts for the 2002 Angels and was 9-4. He lost just once in his final seven starts of the season and won the game that clinched the Angels’ first playoff berth in 16 years.\n\n“A lot of John’s success is due to his makeup, which started long before he pitched in the major leagues,” Angels manager Mike Scioscia told the San Gabriel Valley Tribune. “His passion for the game and his makeup and his willingness to work … You mix that with his talent, it’s an incredible combination.”\n\nIn the American League Championship Series against the Twins, Lackey started Game 4 and pitched seven scoreless innings for the win. Boxscore The Angels clinched the pennant the next day, reaching the World Series for the first time.\n\nWhen Scioscia chose Lackey to start World Series Game 7 versus the Giants, Angels closer Troy Percival told the Los Angeles Times, “You couldn’t ask for a better man to be out there than Lackey. He’s not scared of anything.”\n\nLackey did the job, allowing one run in five innings and becoming the first rookie since the Pirates’ Babe Adams in 1909 to win a World Series Game 7. Boxscore\n\nNoting how Lackey established the inside fastball early in the game, Angels pitching coach Bud Black told the New York Times, “You can’t discount experience, but a lot of times youthful aggressiveness pays off.”\n\nLackey said to the Los Angeles Times, “If you don’t want to go out there with a little pressure and pitching in big games, you shouldn’t be around.”\n\nLackey pitched eight seasons (2002-09) with the Angels, posting a 102-71 record, then became a free agent and took a five-year contract from the Red Sox for $82.5 million.\n\nGetting it done\n\nWhen the Red Sox missed qualifying for the playoffs in 2010 and 2011, “Lackey became one of the symbols of what had gone wrong,” the Boston Globe noted. “Fans booed him and Lackey’s angry exchanges with reporters caused team officials to wince.”\n\nLackey tore a ligament in his right elbow during the 2011 season, managed to make 28 starts but had a 6.41 ERA. He underwent surgery and sat out the 2012 season, when the Red Sox (69-93) finished in last place.\n\nJohn Farrell, a former pitcher, replaced Bobby Valentine as Red Sox manager in 2013 and Lackey returned to the rotation. The 2013 Red Sox had the best record in the American League (97-65). In the playoffs, Lackey beat the Rays in Game 2 of the Division Series and won Game 3 of the League Championship Series against the Tigers. Then he beat the Cardinals in the decisive Game 6 of the World Series. Boxscore, Boxscore, Boxscore\n\n“You can foresee him being successful for years to come because of the style of pitcher he is,” Farrell told the Globe. “He can put the ball on the ground. Because he throws the ball on a downhill angle, he doesn’t rely on velocity as much.”\n\nWhen the Red Sox floundered in 2014 and sunk to last place in July, they shopped Lackey and fellow starter Jon Lester.\n\nFinding a bargain\n\nThe 2014 Cardinals needed a boost. After losing, 12-1, to the Padres on July 30, the Cardinals (56-50) were in third place in a five-team division. That day, they acquired pitcher Justin Masterson (4-6, 5.51 ERA) from Cleveland for a prospect, outfielder James Ramsey.\n\nSeeking another starter, the Cardinals had their eyes on Lackey, Lester and the Rays’ David Price, according to the Post-Dispatch.\n\nLackey, who would turn 36 in October, became their focus. In addition to his 11-7 record for the 2014 Red Sox, Lackey had an enticing contract structure. Though owed $5.08 million for the remainder of 2014, a clause in his contract gave his team the option to bring him back in 2015 for a salary of $500,000.\n\nWhen the Cardinals agreed to include Joe Kelly (2-2, 4.37 ERA), along with Allen Craig (.237, 44 RBI), the trade was made.\n\nGet to work\n\nCraig and Kelly were “cherished teammates” among the Cardinals and the trade “left the clubhouse stunned,” the Post-Dispatch reported.\n\nCardinals general manager John Mozeliak was “a little stunned,” too, “by the immediate take of disappointment” among the players, he told the Post-Dispatch.\n\nOne of the players who applauded the deal was a newcomer, catcher A.J. Pierzynski, 37. Released by the Red Sox on July 16, he signed with St. Louis five days before Lackey was acquired.\n\n“He brings a presence,” Pierzynski told the Post-Dispatch. “He brings competitiveness, He wants the ball. He’s won big games wherever he’s been.”\n\nAs the Post-Dispatch noted, Lackey “proved reliable, if not dominant,” for the 2014 Cardinals. In 10 starts, he was 3-3. Additionally, he “brought an edge to us,” Cardinals manager Mike Matheny told the Post-Dispatch.\n\nFrom 2.5 games out of first place on the day Lackey was acquired, the Cardinals finished atop their division, two games ahead of the runner-up Pirates. The Cardinals were 34-22 after Lackey joined them and finished at 90-72.\n\nTrading Craig and Kelly sent a message that served as a wakeup call to Cardinals players. “I think we came out of it as a stronger, tougher, more energized team,” Mozeliak said to the Post-Dispatch.\n\nWins matter\n\nIn the 2014 National League Division Series, Lackey pitched a gem in Game 3 (seven innings, one run) and beat the Dodgers. Boxscore\n\nHe started Game 3 of the National League Championship Series versus the Giants and was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the seventh inning with the score tied. The Giants won, 5-4, and eventually prevailed in the series. Boxscore\n\nBack with the Cardinals in 2015, Lackey, 36, was 13-10 with a 2.77 ERA and led the team in starts (33) and innings pitched (218). No Cardinal has pitched that many innings in a season since. Video\n\nThe 2015 Cardinals (100-62) had the best record in the National League and were pitted in the playoffs against the third-place finisher from their division, the Cubs, a team they’d defeated 11 times in 19 tries.\n\nIn Game 1, matched against Jon Lester, Lackey was superb (no runs, two hits, 7.1 innings) and St. Louis won. Boxscore\n\nIt was a different story in Game 4. Lackey allowed four runs in three innings. The Cardinals came back and tied the score, but the Cubs prevailed and advanced to the next round. Boxscore\n\nGranted free agency, Lackey joined the Cubs, whose manager, Joe Maddon, coached the Angels when Lackey was with them. Reflecting on how Lackey didn’t want to be bothered on days he pitched, Maddon said to the Chicago Tribune, “Honestly, you can’t talk to him that day in the dugout.”\n\nLackey was 11-8 (including 1-1 with a 2.03 ERA versus the Cardinals) in 29 starts for the 2016 Cubs. Though he didn’t win a game in the 2016 World Series against Cleveland, the Cubs prevailed for the first time since 1908.\n\nAfter a final season with the Cubs in 2017, Lackey finished with a career record of 188-147 and three World Series championship rings.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nA right-handed pitcher and protege of Cardinals ace Harry Brecheen, Jerry Walker became the right-hand man to Cardinals general manager Walt Jocketty.\n\nWalker was involved with professional baseball most of his adult life. At 18, he went from high school to the majors with the Orioles and was nurtured by Brecheen, the pitching coach who’d been a World Series standout with the 1946 Cardinals.\n\nAt 20, Walker became the youngest pitcher to start in an All-Star Game. He played eight seasons in the American League with the Orioles (1957-60), Athletics (1961-62) and Indians (1963-64).\n\nAfter his playing days, Walker managed in the minors, then returned to the big leagues as a scout and went on to become a coach and general manager. For 13 years (1995-2007), he was an executive in the Cardinals’ front office, advising Jocketty on player personnel. Walker was 85 when he died on July 14, 2024.\n\nMighty leap\n\nBorn and raised in Ada, Okla., Walker was a high school baseball phenom, posting a varsity pitching record of 52-1 and leading his club to state titles in 1956 and 1957. He hit .529 as a junior and .526 his senior season.\n\nMost big-league teams tried to sign him, including the Red Sox, who projected Walker as a third baseman, but he chose the Orioles, in large part, because of Brecheen, an Ada resident. “Brecheen had a great deal to do with Walker’s decision,” the Baltimore Sun noted.\n\nBrecheen told the newspaper, “I’ve known the boy and his family for a long time … I thought when I saw him in high school that he had the best curve of any kid I’d ever seen.”\n\nAfter signing with the Orioles on June 28, 1957, Walker joined a pitching staff with the likes of former Negro League fastballer Connie Johnson, World War II combat veteran Hal Brown and ex-Dodgers standout Billy Loes.\n\nA week later, Walker made a jittery big-league debut at Boston’s Fenway Park. With the Red Sox ahead, 6-2, Orioles manager Paul Richards sent Walker to pitch the seventh. He issued walks to the first two batters _ two-time American League batting champion Mickey Vernon and Jackie Jensen (past and future AL RBI leader) _ and went to a 2-and-0 count on Frank Malzone before being relieved by Art Ceccarelli, a winless left-hander. Malzone mashed a pitch that soared over the the head of right fielder Tito Francona for a triple. Boxscore\n\nAfter three relief appearances, Walker made his first start, facing the hapless Athletics at Kansas City. Nervous and overanxious, he didn’t last an inning. Boxscore\n\nBreakout game\n\nA month later, after a few relief stints, none longer than two innings, Walker got his second start, this time at home, against the Senators. Though destined to finish in the basement, the Senators had Roy Sievers, the slugger from St. Louis who would lead the American League in home runs (42) and RBI (114) that year.\n\nPitching with the poise and stamina, Walker shut out the Senators for 10 innings and got the win, 1-0. He allowed four singles and a walk, totaling 111 pitches.\n\n“Here is a kid who had never pitched nine innings in his life,” Paul Richards said to the Baltimore Sun. “The high schools where Jerry played limit their games to seven innings.”\n\nBrecheen told the newspaper, “We knew he had a lot of ability, and he’s got a lot of heart.”\n\nWalker dressed quickly after the game and dashed out of the clubhouse. As the Sun explained, “With a pocketful of hot change, the quiet-spoken, crew-cut kid was busting out all over in his (eagerness) to reach the nearest coin telephone to place a long-distance call to (his parents in) Oklahoma.” Boxscore\n\nSeeing stars\n\nAfter a tune-up season in the minors at Knoxville (18-4, 2.61 ERA) in 1958, Walker was one of three 20-year-old pitchers (Jack Fisher and Milt Pappas being the others) who contributed to the Orioles in 1959.\n\nWalker sizzled early, winning his first four decisions, including a five-hitter against the Yankees. He struck out Mickey Mantle three times. Boxscore\n\nIn a rematch in July, Walker again beat the Yankees, fanning Mantle three more times and totaling 10 strikeouts for the game. “For 20 years old, you’d have to say the young man was amazing the way he struck my men out,” Yankees manager Casey Stengel said to the Sun. Boxscore\n\n(Though he whiffed 12 times versus Walker in his career, Mantle had an on-base percentage of .500 _ 13 hits and 11 walks _ against him and slugged four home runs. Of Walker’s four career wins versus the Yankees, three came in 1959.)\n\nA month later, Stengel, the American League manager, chose Walker to start in the All-Star Game at Los Angeles. Walker got the win, allowing one run in three innings. He twice retired the Cardinals’ Ken Boyer, struck out Eddie Mathews and got Willie Mays and Ernie Banks to ground out. Boxscore\n\nWorking overtime\n\nOn Sept. 11, 1959, the first-place White Sox, headed for an American League pennant, were at Baltimore for a Friday doubleheader on Westinghouse Night. As the Sun noted, “The air was electric with tension.”\n\nJack Fisher shut out the White Sox in the opener, 3-0, limiting them to three hits. Boxscore\n\nWalker started Game 2 against a lineup headed by future Hall of Famers Luis Aparicio and Nellie Fox. He gave up two singles in the first but the White Sox never advanced another runner as far as third the rest of the night.\n\nWhite Sox pitchers Barry Latman (9.1 innings) and Gerry Staley, the ex-Cardinal, were superb, too, but Walker was better. He pitched 16 scoreless innings and the Orioles prevailed, 1-0, when Brooks Robinson’s two-out single versus Staley, 39, drove in Al Pilarcik from third.\n\n“That two 20-year-olds should pitch 25 scoreless innings in one night against the league leaders, even the light-hitting White Sox, borders on the unbelievable,” wrote Ed Brandt of the Sun.\n\nHis colleague, Lou Hatter, offered, “Walker’s performance was extra-special, incredible and then some.”\n\nWalker told United Press International, “I could have pitched another couple of innings.” Boxscore\n\nHe finished the year 11-10 with a 2.92 ERA, but never had another winning season in the majors.\n\nOn the move\n\nIn 1960, Walker suffered from allergies “that sapped his strength,” the Sun reported, and posted a 3-4 season record. “From what they told me, I guess I was allergic to just about everything,” Walker told the Kansas City Times. “They gave me some shots and also some pills to take regularly. The shots are a long-range treatment and the doctors seem to think they should clear up the trouble completely in two or three years.”\n\nTraded to the Athletics in April 1961, he spent two years with them, went 16-23 and got dealt again, to Cleveland, where he played his final two seasons in the majors. A highlight came on July 13, 1963, when Walker pitched four scoreless innings of relief, helping Cleveland teammate Early Wynn, 43, get career win No. 300. Boxscore\n\nIn May 1964, Walker was loaned by Cleveland to the Cardinals’ Class AAA farm club, the Jacksonville Suns, managed by Harry Walker (no relation). His teammates included pitchers Mike Cuellar, Bob Humphreys, Gordon Richardson and Barney Schultz, who went on to help the Cardinals win a pennant and World Series championship that season.\n\nWalker was 10-9 with Jacksonville, including a one-hitter in a 1-0 victory versus Richmond in 10 innings. Called up to Cleveland in September, he pitched his final big-league games that month.\n\nStill in the game\n\nWalker was a manager in the Yankees’ farm system for six seasons (1968-73) and his pitchers included a pair of future American League Cy Young Award winners _ Ron Guidry and LaMarr Hoyt. Walker was a Yankees scout from 1974 to 1981, then became their pitching coach for parts of the 1981 and 1982 seasons.\n\nFrom 1983-85, Walker was Astros pitching coach. His staff ace was Nolan Ryan.\n\nAfter a stint from 1986-91 as special assignment scout for the Tigers, Walker was promoted to general manager by club president Bo Schembechler and tasked with rebuilding the roster. As Gene Guidi of the Detroit Free Press noted, “Walker stepped into a tough spot in Detroit. He wants to make the Tigers a better team but he has few marketable players to trade and a limited spending budget to pursue free agents.”\n\nIn Walker’s first season as general manager, the Tigers were 75-87. They improved to 85-77 in 1993, but the franchise underwent an ownership change, and Walker was fired in January 1994.\n\nCardinals influencer\n\nIn November 1994, Walt Jocketty, who replaced Dal Maxvill as Cardinals general manager, hired Walker to be the club’s director of major league player personnel. “He was the first guy I hired in St. Louis,” Jocketty told the Cincinnati Enquirer.\n\n“Walker’s duties will feature special assignment scouting and recommendations to Jocketty,” the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.\n\nThree years later, in February 1997, Walker was promoted, with the title of vice president of player personnel. The Post-Dispatch referred to him as Jocketty’s “right-hand man.”\n\nAccording to the Cardinals 1997 media guide, Walker “assists Jocketty in personnel matters with the major league club and he is also responsible for overseeing the Cardinals player development and scouting activities.”\n\nOne of the up-and-coming Cardinals staffers in 1997 was a scouting assistant, John Mozeliak. According to the Post-Dispatch, Walker was a mentor to Mozeliak.\n\nDuring Walker’s 13 years with the Cardinals, they won two National League pennants (2004 and 2006) and a World Series title (2006).\n\nIn October 2007, Jocketty was fired and replaced by Mozeliak. “One of Walt’s strong points was how he used his people,” Walker told the Post-Dispatch. “He allowed Mo (Mozeliak) to be involved, to increase his responsibilities.”\n\nWhen the Reds then hired Jocketty to be team president and general manager, he brought in Walker to serve as his special assistant for player personnel.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nOn Sept. 4, 1987, Vicente Palacios stood on a big-league mound for the first time, a 24-year-old Pirates rookie from Mexico making his debut at Houston’s Astrodome. It must have felt to him like standing atop Mount Everest. He’d been rejected by two other organizations, White Sox and Brewers, making him wonder whether he’d lost his chance of ever reaching the majors, but here he was, pitching in the same game with none other than Nolan Ryan.\n\nSeven years later, on July 19, 1994, his 31st birthday, Palacios was back on the mound at the Astrodome, this time as a member of the Cardinals. He’d been through multiple shoulder surgeries and experienced more rejection, but managed to persevere.\n\nPalacios had his greatest game that night, holding the hard-hitting Astros to one hit in nine innings and pitching a shutout for the win.\n\nTraveling man\n\nBorn about 20 miles inland from the port city of Veracruz along the Gulf of Mexico, Palacios was 19 in 1983 when he pitched his first season of professional baseball in the Mexican League with El Aguila de Veracruz (The Eagle of Veracruz).\n\n“There was no question he was one of the top three or four pitchers in Mexico,” Terry Collins, then a scout for the Dodgers, told The Pittsburgh Press.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox purchased his contract in 1984 and sent him to the minors. A right-hander, Palacios didn’t do enough to impress while in the White Sox system. They loaned him to the Mexico City Reds in 1985 and to El Aguila de Veracruz in 1986 before releasing him.\n\nDesperate to revive his career, Palacios, 23, experimented with developing a different pitch. “I did it on my own,” he told Bob Hertzel of The Pittsburgh Press.\n\nThe pitch Palacios came up with was a variation of the split-fingered fastball. “It’s kind of like a forkball,” catcher Mike LaValliere said to The Press. “He holds it like a knuckle-curve, only it doesn’t spin much.” Pitching coach Ray Miller described it to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette as “a knuckle palm ball,” and broadcaster Jim Rooker, a former pitcher, called it “a knorkle ball.”\n\nPalacios learned to master the pitch in winter ball in Mexico after the 1986 regular season, drawing interest from scouts for the Pirates and Brewers.\n\nThe Pirates signed Palacios on Dec. 4, 1986, four days before the baseball winter meetings, but the Brewers outmaneuvered them. Because he wasn’t on the Pirates’ big-league roster, Palacios was exposed to the Dec. 8 Rule 5 draft, and, much to the Pirates’ chagrin and embarrassment, was selected by the Brewers.\n\nThe draft rules required that the Brewers keep Palacios on their big-league roster throughout the 1987 season or else give the Pirates the chance to take him back.\n\nAt 1987 spring training, Palacios was nurtured by the Brewers’ 20-game winner and countryman Teddy Higuera, who focused on the mental aspects of pitching, such as managing emotions and making adjustments to game situations.\n\nHowever, Palacios didn’t advance enough to earn a spot on the Opening Day roster, and was sent back to the Pirates.\n\n“We really wanted to keep him,” Brewers general manager Harry Dalton told The Pittsburgh Press. “We saw potential in him. We would have kept him if he were a little more poised, a little more mature.”\n\nUps and downs\n\nThe Pirates sent Palacios to their Class AAA Vancouver farm club in 1987 and he thrived under the guidance of pitching coach Jackie Brown, who altered his pitching mechanics. “When his mechanics got straightened out, he started feeling better about himself,” Pirates director of player development Buzzy Keller told the Post-Gazette.\n\nPalacios was 13-5 for Vancouver and led the Pacific Coast League in ERA (2.58), shutouts (five), innings pitched (185) and strikeouts (148).\n\nCalled up to the Pirates in September 1987, Palacios made his debut at the Astrodome, working two scoreless innings (sixth and seventh) in relief of Mike Bielecki and matching zeroes with opposing pitcher Nolan Ryan. Boxscore\n\nFour days later, Palacios made his first start and outdueled Rick Sutcliffe, holding the Cubs to one run in eight innings and getting the win. Boxscore\n\nBased on that success, Palacios was in the Pirates’ plans, but then came more setbacks. He had shoulder surgery in 1988 and again in 1989.\n\nHis comeback bid in 1990 began with Class AAA Buffalo, where Terry Collins was the manager and Jackie Brown the pitching coach. Palacios made 28 starts for Buffalo and had a 13-7 record.\n\nThe Pirates, in the thick of the 1990 title chase in the National League East, brought him back to the majors on Sept. 5. Manager Jim Leyland used Palacios in relief and got rewarded. In seven appearances covering 15 innings, Palacios allowed no runs and earned three saves, including one against the Cardinals, and helped the Pirates become division champions. Boxscore\n\nBecause he joined them after Sept. 1, Palacios was not eligible for the playoffs.\n\nNonetheless, his career seemed to be on an upswing. With the Pirates in 1991, Palacios was used as both starter and reliever. Though he spent a month on the disabled list because of shoulder problems, he posted a 6-3 record, with three saves and a 3.75 ERA. In seven starts, including a shutout of the Expos, his ERA was 2.72. Boxscore\n\nThe Pirates repeated as division champions in 1991, but Palacios was left off the playoff roster because his season record against their foe, the Braves, was 0-3.\n\nIn 1992, Palacios won his first three decisions, but then his shoulder began to ache. He was placed on the disabled list in June, had his third surgery, missed the remainder of the season and was released. The Padres signed him, watched him at spring training in 1993 and released him. He returned to the Mexican League with the Yucatan Lions, who dealt him to the Aguascalientes Railroadmen.\n\n“A lot of people think when you go to the Mexican League, you’re done,” Palacios told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “Then when I got traded from (Yucatan), I was worried. I started thinking there’s something wrong.”\n\nAs he had before, though, Palacios soldiered on, earning 20 saves in the Mexican League in 1993 and pitching a no-hitter in the playoffs.\n\nOn Dec. 23, 1993, the Cardinals signed Palacios to a minor-league contract and invited him to spring training as a non-roster player.\n\nNo quit\n\nPalacios won a spot on the Opening Day roster of the 1994 Cardinals as a reliever. “I’m very impressed with his stuff,” Cardinals pitching coach Joe Coleman told the Post-Dispatch. “The only question is his durability. He’s sneaky quick and throws that ball (from) out of his uniform. It’s tough to pick up. He’s got a fastball that rides in on their hands, and he’s got the forkball to go along with it.”\n\nIn the Cardinals’ season-opening win against the Reds at Cincinnati, Palacios played a key role, pitching two scoreless innings in relief of starter Bob Tewksbury. He escaped a bases-loaded jam in the seventh by striking out Reggie Sanders. Boxscore\n\nAfter making nine relief appearances, Palacios was moved into the starting rotation on May 3 when two pitchers went on the disabled list. He lost seven of his first eight decisions, but received poor run support. The Cardinals averaged 1.1 runs per game in his seven losses as a starter.\n\nLacking better options _ the 1994 Cardinals would finish with a team ERA of 5.14 _ manager Joe Torre stuck with Palacios.\n\nOn July 18, the Cardinals blew an 11-0 lead and lost, 15-12, to the Astros at Houston. The next night, Palacios, with his 1-7 record, was given the start against the Astros’ Darryl Kile.\n\nThe Astros, managed by Terry Collins, had a lineup with two future Hall of Famers, Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio, plus Steve Finley and Luis Gonzalez, and would lead the league in RBI that season.\n\nIt looked to be a mismatch, and it turned out that way, too _ but not in favor of the Astros.\n\nPalacios issued a walk to Bagwell in the first and gave up a leadoff single to eighth-place batter Andujar Cedeno in the third, then retired the last 21 batters in a row, completing a one-hit shutout in a 10-0 Cardinals triumph. Boxscore\n\n“I kept the ball down, mixed my pitches and stayed ahead of the hitters,” Palacios said to the Associated Press, “and our guys made a lot of good plays behind me.”\n\nHe made two more starts, then returned to a relief role, as Torre tried to find plugs for a pitching staff leaking runs.\n\nPalacios led the 1994 Cardinals pitching staff in strikeouts (95) and was second to Bob Tewksbury in innings pitched (117.2). His season record: 3-8, 4.44 ERA.\n\nWith the 1995 Cardinals, Palacios got raked (5.80 ERA and .300 batting average against) before he underwent his fourth shoulder surgery in July. “I’ve got to find a new shoulder,” Palacios said to the Post-Dispatch.\n\nThe Cardinals released him four months later.\n\nDetermined to keep pitching, Palacios eventually worked his way back to the Mexican League. In 1999, with Broncos de Reynosa, he made 43 relief appearances and was 5-2 with 10 saves and a 0.95 ERA.\n\nThe Padres, managed by Bruce Bochy, signed him and on April 20, 2000, five years after he pitched for the Cardinals, Palacios, 36, was back in a big-league game. His opponent: the Cardinals.\n\nPitching in relief of Brian Boehringer, Palacios faced 13 Cardinals batters and gave up six runs, including home runs to Eli Marrero and Rick Ankiel. Boxscore\n\nHe did better after that, allowing no runs in four of his next six relief appearances, but the Padres released him in August.\n\nOnce again, Palacios returned to the Mexican League and pitched there until 2003 when he turned 40.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nCardinals rookie Herman Bell seemed an unlikely candidate to accomplish one of the franchise’s most remarkable pitching feats.\n\nOne hundred years ago, on July 19, 1924, Bell pitched two complete games in a doubleheader and won both against the Braves at St. Louis.\n\nBefore joining the Cardinals, Bell primarily had been working as a cowpoke on a cattle ranch and pitching on pasture diamonds for semipro teams.\n\nHe went on to pitch in three World Series and have a role in one of Babe Ruth’s epic clouts.\n\nSoldier and cowboy\n\nHerman “Hi” Bell was born in Mount Sherman, Ky., 10 miles from Abraham Lincoln’s birthplace in LaRue County, but moved with his family to northwest Iowa when he was a youngster.\n\n(When he joined the Cardinals, his teammates nicknamed him “Hi,” from the expression, “Hiya, how’re you doing?” according to Sid Keener of the St. Louis Star-Times.)\n\nBell attended school in Sibley, Iowa, 10 miles from the Minnesota border, and also resided in Alton, Iowa, according to The Sporting News.\n\nIn 1917, when he was 19, Bell enlisted in the Army during World War I and completed his service in 1919. He then worked on a ranch in Colorado for three years (1919-21), the St. Louis Globe-Democrat reported, and played semipro baseball for town teams in Iowa, Minnesota and South Dakota.\n\nBell expected “to become a regular cowboy for the cattle ranch” near Colorado Springs, according to the Alton (Iowa) Democrat.\n\n“There are probably no baseball pitchers in northwest Iowa the superiors of Herman Bell,” the Alton Democrat noted in October 1921. “He has no ambition, however, toward entering professional baseball, and has already tried ranch life and likes it.”\n\nBell apparently had a change of heart, because in 1922 he played for the Sioux Falls (S.D.) Soos of the Dakota League in the Class D level of the minors. When the league folded in 1923, Bell went back to pitching for a semipro team and was discovered by Cardinals scout Charley Barrett, who signed him late that summer, according to the Globe-Democrat.\n\nAfter a good spring training with the 1924 Cardinals, managed by Branch Rickey, Bell, 26, was on their Opening Day roster.\n\nStarting out\n\nA 6-foot right-hander, Bell’s first six appearances for the Cardinals were in relief and he wasn’t particularly impressive, allowing runs in four of those games.\n\nThen he got a start, in the second game of a doubleheader against the Pirates at Pittsburgh, and pitched into the 15th inning before allowing the winning run. “The youngster pitched exceptionally well,” The Pittsburgh Press reported. Boxscore\n\nFive days later, on June 4, Bell got his first win, pitching a complete game versus the Phillies at Baker Bowl in Philadelphia. Then he lost his next three starts, giving him a 1-4 record. Boxscore\n\nDouble wins\n\nThe Cardinals faced consecutive home doubleheaders _ Saturday, July 19, against the Braves and Sunday, July 20, versus the Phillies.\n\nFor Game 1 of the first doubleheader, Rickey chose Bell to start for the Cardinals (34-49) against the Braves (33-50).\n\nBell, who entered the game with a 4.80 ERA, retired the first 22 batters in a row before Ernie Padgett lined a double to right with one out in the eighth. Cotton Tierney followed with a single, scoring Padgett, but those were the only hits the Braves got versus Bell. He completed the two-hitter, a 6-1 Cardinals victory. The Braves’ No. 3 batter, Casey Stengel, went hitless. Boxscore\n\nBetween games, Rickey had Allen Sothoron and Bill Sherdel warm up, presumably with the notion of starting one of them in Game 2, but then the manager had an idea. He asked Bell whether he wanted to pitch the second game.\n\nAccording to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Bell replied, “Sure.” Rickey said, “Well, then, you’re the pitcher. Go to it.”\n\nRickey told the newspaper, “My purpose in sending Bell back was to instill confidence in the youngster and to give his teammates greater confidence in their pitcher. He is a big, strong lad and his pitching motion is such that pitching 18 innings entails no great effort.”\n\nBell retired the first 13 batters in Game 2. Just as in the opener, Ernie Padgett doubled for the first hit against him.\n\nWith the Cardinals ahead, 2-0, the Braves made it tense in the ninth. After Stengel’s two-out single drove in a run, the Braves had runners on first and third, with Stuffy McInnis, a career .307 hitter, at the plate.\n\n“A trying moment for a pitcher who’d worked 17.2 innings,” the Globe-Democrat noted.\n\nMcInnis hit a grounder to third baseman Specs Toporcer, who threw to second in time to retire Stengel for the third out. Boxscore\n\n(An oddity of note: The Cardinals had seven baserunners thrown out attempting to steal. In Game 1, Braves catcher Mickey O’Neil nailed five runners, and in Game 2 Frank Gibson stopped two.)\n\nThe Post-Dispatch described Bell’s pitching as “sensational.” The Globe-Democrat added it “was all the more remarkable considering that it rained during the greater part of both games.”\n\nSportsman’s Park didn’t have lights then.\n\nAs the Post-Dispatch reported, “At one stage of the opener it appeared as if the teams would be lucky to play the full nine innings. In the fourth and fifth innings of the nightcap, the ball was difficult to follow because of the darkness caused by the low black clouds rolling out of the west.”\n\nBabe vs. Bell\n\nBell went winless the rest of the season, losing four more decisions, including an Aug. 6 start against the Braves, and finishing 3-8.\n\nHe spent the next year in the minors, with the 1925 Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nBack with the Cardinals in 1926, Bell was a reliever and spot starter for a team that won the franchise’s first National League pennant and World Series title. In 19 relief appearances, Bell was 3-2 with a 1.27 ERA.\n\nBell’s lone appearance in the 1926 World Series against the Yankees came in a Game 4 relief stint at St. Louis _ and it was a doozy. In the sixth inning, Bell faced Babe Ruth, who had slugged home runs against starter Flint Rhem in the first and third innings. No one had hit three homers in a World Series game.\n\nBell worked the count to 3-and-2, then challenged The Babe. “Ruth waded into the fastball and put all his shoulders and back behind the 52-ounce bat,” the New York Times reported. “He caught the ball as flush as an expert marksman.”\n\nAs the New York Daily News noted, when Ruth made contact with Bell’s pitch, there was an “ominous crack, as loud as a rifle report” and the ball took off “as though propelled by high-powered explosives.”\n\nThis wasn’t one of Ruth’s arcing rainbows. It was, as the Daily News described, a “streak shot straight for the bleachers in center field, a direct flight.”\n\nAccording to the Times, “It is 430 feet to the bleacher fence. The wall is about 20 feet high. Back of it stretches a deep bank of seats, and almost squarely in the middle of this bank” is where Ruth’s home run landed.\n\nThe Associated Press reported, “It was a terrific smash.
