        "text": "The second half of the Iowa Cubs season is underway and some of the Chicago Cubs’ biggest prospects are already in Des Moines or could be making their way to Triple-A soon.\n\nThe Des Moines Register recently chatted with Jason Kanzler, Chicago’s director of player development to talk about some of those players.\n\nDuring the interview, Kanzler chatted about the development of prospects Owen Caissie, Moises Ballesteros, the rise of Matt Shaw and one player who has caught his attention.\n\nOwen Caissie has been impressive during his first stint in Triple-A\n\nCaissie, a left-handed hitting outfielder who was acquired in the Yu Darvish deal, has enjoyed a strong start to his Triple-A career. The 22-year-old hit .277/.385/.461 with an .846 OPS and 18 doubles and nine home runs in his first 81 games with Iowa. Caissie is ranked the third-best prospect in the system, according to MLB Pipeline, and is still a youngster in a league full of experienced players.\n\n“I think he’s done a great job,” Kanzler said. “He’s extremely young for the league, extremely young. So, this has been a good test for him. I know he’s learning a lot and I know this experience is going to help him when he’s a major leaguer.”\n\nSo, what’s next for Caissie to work on? Nothing specific.\n\n“I think we’d like to watch him and see him continue to develop,” Kanzler said. “There’s nothing overly specific. He’s at a stage where holistically, development is something we would be happy to see and I think he’s set up perfectly at this level, at his age, with his mindset, to do that.”\n\nMoises Ballesteros can hit and catch\n\nBallesteros, a left-handed hitting catcher, has rapidly risen through the system this season. After destroying opposing pitching in Double-A, he was promoted to Triple-A. Ballesteros hasn’t missed a beat. In his first 24 games with Iowa, the 20-year-old hit .292/.340/.490 with seven doubles and four homers. MLB Pipeline ranks him as the fifth-best prospect in the system.\n\n“We’re very pleased with how well he’s done this year and how quickly he’s grown as a hitter and as a person,” Kanzler said. “We challenged him quite a bit in spring to do some things and obviously he has the hit tool and he can really handle the bat with the best of them and we’ve been very happy with the way he’s done. It’s been a great journey for him and I’m sure he’s as excited as we are with the progress.”\n\nBallesteros has drawn rave reviews from behind the plate by his Iowa manager Marty Pevey, a former catcher himself. Kanzler said he’s happy with the progress Ballesteros has made as well.\n\n“He’s come along,” Kanzler said. \"He’s come a long ways. I think generally when you have a bat-first type of catcher profile and Moises, to his credit, has made his bat the main talking point, the defense can be lost on people. But he has actually improved substantially on defense. And it’s really exciting what he’s done.”\n\nBryce Windham has flown under the radar\n\nOne under-the-radar player who has caught the attention of Kanzler in Triple-A, is Bryce Windham. The versatile 27-year-old has played almost everywhere for Iowa. He’s caught, been at first, played second and logged time at all three outfield positions. Windham even made a highlight reel catch with a potential home run-robbing grab in center earlier this season.\n\n“We’ve asked him to do so much this year, especially with all the movement in Triple-A and the random injuries, everywhere,” Kanzler said. “His ability to play many positions and do it like a pro has been really helpful for us and a real testament to his character.\n\nThe wait continues for Matt Shaw\n\nEver since the season started, the clock has been ticking on when Matt Shaw would arrive in Des Moines. The 22-year-old was a first-round pick by the Cubs in 2023 and has impressed everyone in the organization with his bat. In 76 games with Double-A Tennessee this season, Shaw hit .258/.361/.435 with 11 doubles, two triples and 11 home runs. Could he make it to Iowa this season?\n\n“We’re going to do what’s best for Matt Shaw and his development,” Kanzler said. “But, obviously he’s hitting well. I think no one can say otherwise, given the numbers. He was only drafted not too long ago so we’re going to do everything we can to make sure that we prioritize his development and his longtime success to help the Cubs.”\n\nTommy Birch, the Register's sports enterprise and features reporter, has been working at the newspaper since 2008.
