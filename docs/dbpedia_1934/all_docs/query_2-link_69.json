        "text": "The Big Ten men’s tournament opens today in Chicago with a pair of first-round games featuring Illinois, Nebraska, Northwestern and Rutgers. (We're just waiting for a Michigan/Michigan State rematch.) Sure, it’s hoops time right now, but baseball season is coming (no matter what the weather report says), and the Big Ten has produced plenty of big-league talent. With that in mind, let’s take a look at the top Detroit Tigers to come out of the Big Ten. (And yes, we’re going to count the four most recent conference members, even if they weren’t in the Big Ten when the player was in school. We’re also only counting main campuses.) Let’s get started alphabetically:\n\nMore: Michigan vs. Michigan State is best college basketball rivalry. Here's proof\n\nIllinois: Hoot Evers, OF\n\nThe buzz: If you came to a Tigers game in the late 1940s, you might have thought fans were booing whenever Evers came to the plate. But, no, they were just yelling “Hooooooooot, ” in honor of the Texas-born outfielder. Evers spent just one year at Illinois before flunking out — allegedly on purpose — and signing with the Tigers. He got one game with the big club in 1941, and a season in the Texas League, before losing three seasons to World War II. After World War II, he spent six full seasons in Detroit, making the All-Star team twice while hitting .292 with 63 homers in 737 games. He was traded (with George Kell and Dizzy Trout) to the Red Sox in 1952, and had a short stint back in Detroit in 1954.\n\nHonorable mention: Catcher Tom Haller, a backup on the 1972 AL East champs, whose claim to fame as a Tiger was catching a game in ’72 with his brother, Bill, as the home plate umpire.\n\nIndiana: Greg Shippy, C\n\nThe buzz: Just three Hoosiers even made it into the Tigers organization, and none of them made the majors. The best was likely Greg Shippy, who was drafted in the sixth round in 1973. He made it as high as Double-A Montgomery in 1977-78, where he was teammates with much of the core of the Tigers’ 1984 world championship team. Shippy hit .217 in his two seasons in Double-A.\n\nHonorable mention: None.\n\nIowa: Hal Manders, RHP\n\nThe buzz: There’s just two players to choose from for the Hawkeyes. Manders spent parts of three seasons with the Tigers in 1941-42 and 1946 (bookending his service in World War II, of course). Manders went 3-0 with a 4.31 ERA in 54 ⅓ innings for the Tigers in 28 appearances.\n\nHonorable mention: None.\n\nMaryland: Charlie Keller, LF\n\nThe buzz: Keller spent just two seasons with the Tigers toward the end of his career; in Detroit, he was a well-paid — $35,000 over two seasons — pinch-hitter, hitting .283 with five homers in 104 games. That was long after he was expected to star for the Yankees, who signed the left-handed slugger out of College Park in the late 1930s. “King Kong” did have a brush with history in Detroit, however; he made his first big-league start in Detroit in 1939 on May 2, the day that Lou Gehrig’s then-record consecutive-games streak ended. (Keller went 2-for-5 in a 22-2 Yankees victory. Who needs Lou Gehrig, anyhow?)\n\nHonorable mention: None.\n\n[Get the scoop on the Tigers every week with the Freep's Tigers newsletter!]\n\nMichigan: Charlie Gehringer, 2B\n\nThe buzz: The Fowlerville native spent just one season in Ann Arbor, signing with the Tigers in the fall of 1923. He made his Tigers debut in September 1924, spent most of 1925 in Double-A and then the next 17 seasons earning his spot in the Baseball Hall of Fame. “The Mechanical Man” was induced into the Hall in 1949, had his number retired by the Tigers in 1983 and a statue of him stands above the outfield at Comerica Park today.\n\nHonorable mention: Catcher Bill Freehan, who made 11 AL All-Star teams, all with the Tigers, and later coached the Wolverines’ baseball team for six seasons.\n\nMichigan State: Kirk Gibson, OF\n\nThe buzz: Gibby also played just one season of college baseball, though it came in his junior year at the school, in the middle of a College Football Hall of Fame career for the Spartans. Gibson hit .390 with 16 homers and 21 steaks in 48 games for the Spartans; armed with the leverage of being able to return to football, he fell to the Tigers in the draft with the No. 12 pick. It worked out pretty well; he hit .277 with 195 homers over 12 seasons in Detroit and was the heart of the 1984 World Series winners. (He also won the NL MVP in 1988 and hit some home run in the ’88 Series that gets brought up now and again.)\n\nHonorable mention: RHP Frank Owen, who went 1-3 with a 4.34 Era in the Tigers’ inaugural season in 1901, then spent the bulk of his career with the White Sox, posting three 20-win seasons from 1904-06.\n\nMinnesota: Jerry Ujdur, RHP\n\nThe buzz: The Tigers of the early 1980s had two Minnesota natives in the rotation. One was Hall of Famer Jack Morris. The other was Ujdur, whose best season came in 1982 when the Tigers called him up from Triple-A out of desperation and were rewarded with a 10-10 record and a 3.69 ERA. That was his best year wearing the Old English D. Ujdur, who was drafted in the fourth round in 1978, came into 1983 with a hold on the No. 4 starter job and put up a 7.15 ERA in 34 innings. He finished his career in 1984 with Cleveland.\n\nHonorable mention: None.\n\nNebraska: Joba Chamberlain, RHP\n\nThe buzz: Chamberlain was one of many patches used by Dave Dombrowski in his attempts to plug the Tigers’ leaky bullpen during their run atop the AL Central in 2011-14. Chamberlain was signed from the Yankees before the 2014 season and was stellar for the first half, posting a 2.63 ERA in 37 ⅔ innings before the All-Star break. After, he had a 4.97 ERA. His struggles continued into his second season in Detroit; he had a 4.09 ERA in 2015 before being released in mid-July.\n\nHonorable mention: Not a Tiger, but did you know that former Buffalo, Kansas and Liberty football coach Turner Gill spent three seasons in the Cleveland farm system? I did not. (He hit .199 in Single- and Double-A, just a hair under his .208 winning percentage in two seasons at Kansas.)\n\nNorthwestern: None\n\nThe buzz: No Northwestern alum has ever made the Tigers’ roster. Indeed, Dan Konecny, taken in the 17th round in 2004, 493rd overall, is the only Wildcat to play in the Tigers organization. Konecny (who was drafted ahead of Lorenzo Cain, Chris Carer, J.P. Arencibia and Jerry Blevins in that round) lasted just two seasons in the Tigers’ system.\n\nHonorable mention: None.\n\nOhio State: Joe Sparma, RHP\n\nThe buzz: Sparma might have been better playing AGAINST Michigan than he was playing IN Michigan. A two-sport star at OSU, he passed for 200 yards and two touchdowns in a 50-20 win over the Wolverines in 1961, then threw a no-hitter against the Wolverines in 1963. (His career ERA at Tiger Stadium: 3.61.) He signed with the Tigers soon after, and was in the majors by 1964. He never quite put it all together for the Tigers, with his best season coming in 1965 when he had a 3.18 ERA in 167 innings. Still, he played his part in Tigers lore, throwing a complete-game gem against the Yankees on Sept. 17, 1968, to clinch the AL pennant for the Tigers, who would go on to win the World Series. Sparma faced three batters in that series, retiring one and allowing two hits and two runs in Game 4 against the Cardinals.\n\nHonorable mention: DH/1B Frank Howard, a four-time All-Star, finished his career with the Tigers, hitting 13 homers in 1972-73; reliever Fred Scherman appeared in 212 games for Detroit over five seasons (1969-73) and had a 3.39 ERA for the Tigers.\n\nPenn State: Phil Page, LHP\n\nThe buzz: The only Nittany Lion to suit up for the Tigers, Page spent parts of three seasons from 1928-30 in Detroit. He finished his time in Detroit with a 6.37 ERA in 59 1/3 innings. He was one of 22 pitchers to allow a grand slam to Lou Gehrig, doing so in the first inning on Sept. 10, 1929.\n\nHonorable mention: Shortstop Tim Brookens, the twin of longtime Tiger Tom Brookens, never made the Tigers’ big-league roster and spent two seasons in Double-A backing up Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker.\n\nPurdue: Red Killefer, UTIL\n\nThe buzz: Killefer grew up in Paw Paw and bounced around the semi-pro circuits before signing with the Tigers in 1907. He saw limited playing time in parts of three seasons in Detroit, hitting .236 in 52 games, and feuded with then-Tigers owner Frank Navin, who dealt Killefer to the Senators in the middle of 1909.\n\nHonorable mention: None.\n\nRutgers: Frank MacCormack, RHP & Jeff Frazier, OF\n\nThe buzz: MacCormack played just one season for the Tigers, putting up a 5.79 ERA in nine appearances (eight starts) in 1976. The Mariners took him in the expansion draft before the 1977 season. Frazier, the brother of All-Star Todd Frazier, was drafted by the Tigers in the third round in 2004 and had 23 at-bats for the Tigers in 2010, hitting .217 with one double in 23 at-bats.\n\nHonorable mention: None.\n\nWisconsin: Harvey Kuenn, SS\n\nThe buzz: Wisconsin’s first All-American in baseball, Kuenn was an instant star with the Tigers, hitting .325 in 19 games in 1952, then winning AL Rookie of the Year in 1953. He made the AL All-Star team in all seven of his full seasons in Detroit, hitting .314 with 53 homers and 242 doubles. He’s also part of one of the most discussed trades of all time; the Tigers dealt Kuenn, the AL batting champ in 1959, straight up to Cleveland for Rocky Colavito, the AL’s home run champ in 1959. The deal worked out for both teams in the short term, but there are still Indians fans who blame “The Curse of Rocky Colavito” for their ongoing World Series title drought (which actually stretches back to 1948).\n\nHonorable mention: Catcher Red Wilson, who hit .265 as a backup for the Tigers from 1954-60."
