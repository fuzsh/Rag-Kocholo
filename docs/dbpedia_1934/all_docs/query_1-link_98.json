        "text": "Keaton Aldridge is hoping to make the most of another opportunity.\n\nThe hard-throwing right-handed pitcher from Birmingham is currently playing with the Eastside Diamond Hoppers in the United Shore Professional Baseball League. The ultimate goal is to return to a Major League Baseball affiliate after being released by the New York Mets last year.\n\n\"I still wouldn't be playing if I didn't think I could make it back (to Major League Baseball),\" Aldridge said. \"It's not all rainbows and sunshine, but unless something happens injury-wise, my goal is to make it back to affiliated ball and try to get to the big leagues as quickly as possible while getting better playing (in the USPBL).\n\n\"This is a unique situation. It's a different kind of league. We don't play every day, which most leagues do. Honestly, in a lot of independent leagues, it's tough to get picked up out of, but I know they have a good relationship here with scouts and farm directors and people like that.\n\n\"So I took the opportunity and I'm thankful for the opportunity and it's good,\" he added. \"I'm very happy and it's working out well.\"\n\nAn interesting transition\n\nAldridge, who turns 26 Friday, has thus far leap-frogged through a rather interesting baseball career in which he has transitioned from one side of the battery to the other.\n\nDuring his high school and college careers, he was a catcher.\n\nAfter attending Birmingham Seaholm High School as a freshman and sophomore, Aldridge transferred to Glenwood High School in Phenix City, Ala., graduating in 2011.\n\nAldridge earned an athletic scholarship to the University of Memphis, where he played for three years. In his final year as a junior, he hit .300 while starting 29 of 38 games. He then transferred to the University of Tampa to finish his college career and was a member of the Spartans' NCAA Division II national championship team.\n\nEven though Aldridge went undrafted after graduating from Tampa in 2015, he never gave up his dream of playing in the major leagues. Because of his strong arm, scouts from the New York Mets saw potential and signed the 6-foot-2, 205-pounder as a free agent with the intent of turning him into a pitcher.\n\nThe conversion had a painful start.\n\nTwenty pitches into his pro debut in fall 2015 with the Mets' Rookie League team in Port St. Lucie, Fla., he blew out his right elbow.\n\n\"I didn't even make it through my first inning of pro ball. I wasn't very happy, to say the least,\" Aldridge said. \"I was just signed and playing on one of the back fields and I blew it out on my 20th pitch. I had been throwing bullpens and live BPs, but this was my first game of rookie ball.\"\n\nDream has never wavered\n\nAldridge underwent Tommy John surgery — ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction — and missed the entire 2016 season.\n\nAfter extensive rehab, Aldridge restarted his career as a closer in 2017 for the Brooklyn Cyclones, the Mets' Single-A affiliate in the New York-Penn League. He eventually got called up to the organization's Single-A affiliate Columbia in the South Atlantic League.\n\nThe Mets then released Aldridge, but the dream has never wavered.\n\nAldridge's passion for baseball led him home to the USPBL.\n\n\"I got released kind of out of nowhere by the Mets last October. I threw for a bunch of teams just to kind of keep it together,\" Aldridge said. \"I'm from Birmingham and I had the opportunity to come home and live at home for the first time in nine years and it's been a pretty good opportunity.\"\n\nAldridge, whose grandfather Stan owns Indianwood Golf & Country Club in Lake Orion, said it's rewarding to be playing in his hometown.\n\n\"It's nice. My parents would also come to see me play, but they never got to see me on a consistent basis,\" Aldridge said. \"I have friends who had never seen me play because I have been all over the country. Now they get to come and enjoy it. It's a unique opportunity, for sure.\"\n\nUSPBL offers hope\n\nThanks to some tutoring from Justin Orenduff, the USPBL's director of baseball operations and a Los Angeles Dodgers draftee who was a two-time All-America pitcher at George Washington and VCU, and the coaching of manager Paul Noce, Aldridge has found some success.\n\nAldridge is a closer for the Eastside Diamond Hoppers and has pitched 14 innings in 13 games. He has earned two saves, the latest in a 3-2 win over over the Utica Unicorns during which he allowed one run but struck out the side in the bottom of the ninth inning.\n\n\"It's been going well. I've been having some success,\" Aldridge said. \"I added a new pitch about six weeks ago with a new little curve ball that I throw now and then. But it's really just been working on fastball command and moving the ball around the plate.\n\n\"I'm mainly attached to my fastball. I mean I'm 93, 95, but I can run it up to 96 (mph). I've been groomed to be a late-inning reliever. I'm a little bit on the crazy side, so it's worked out well.\n\n\"I know pitch sequencing and reading hitters quite well just from being behind the plate for so long,\" he added. \"It's definitely been a benefit for the pitching side. Every time you go out there, you're working on stuff, trying to get better and learning different things.\"\n\nAldridge can take hope from former Hoppers teammate Logan Gillaspie.\n\nLike Aldridge, Gillaspie is a former catcher turned pitcher. He recently became the 22nd USPBL player to catch on with a Major League Baseball organization as he signed a contract with the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\n\"Realistically for me, it was pro ball or bust. I enjoyed myself in college and I got a great degree,\" said Aldridge, who majored in international business. \"But I wasn't going through all of that just to hang it up after I graduated.\n\n\"I'm trying to make it to affiliated ball and, eventually, to the big leagues. And once that doesn't happen, I'm done. Once that dream is gone, I'll be hanging it up, gather my thoughts and think about what I want to go into.\n\n\"I couldn't be more thankful for the opportunity and I hope to take advantage of it,\" he added. \"It's nice to be back home to go through the ranks and get back to affiliated ball.\"\n\nThe USPBL, in its third season of play at Jimmy John's Field in Utica, is meeting its goals of providing affordable family entertainment while sending players on to Major League Baseball affiliates. Aldridge aims to be another one of those players.\n\nMichigan connections\n\nAldridge is not the only player from Michigan playing in the four-team USPBL. Following are the others listed on the rosters:\n\nBIRMINGHAM-BLOOMFIELD BEAVERS: Seth Freed (infield), Bay City; Jack Hranec (infield), Ortonville; Todd Weiss (outfield), Bloomfield Hills.\n\nEASTSIDE DIAMOND HOPPERS: Pat Adams (outfield), Warren.\n\nUTICA UNICORNS: Donald Goodson (utility/pitcher), Detroit.\n\nWESTSIDE WOOLLY MAMMOTHS: Clifton Landess III (pitcher), Carleton; Ethan Wiskur (outfield), Clio.\n\nContact Marty Budner at mbudner@hometownlife.com.
