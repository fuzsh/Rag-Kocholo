        "text": "THE mortality rate for general managers has risen dramatically. Once a safe and secure job with the promise of lifetime employment, the general manager's position now challenges the manager's for high-risk living in baseball. In 1985 alone, seven clubs have changed general managers.\n\nMost recently, Houston dismissed Al Rosen, who moved to San Francisco, which had dropped Tom Haller, and the Chicago White Sox ended Roland Hemond's long tenure as their general manager. Earlier in the year, Seattle asked Hal Keller to leave, Pittsburgh discharged Harding (Pete) Peterson, Cleveland ended Phil Seghi's run as its general manager and St. Louis sent Joe McDonald into the unemployment market.\n\n''Managers used to be fired for losing games, which they probably still are,'' said Pat Gillick, the general manager who built the Toronto Blue Jays into American League East champions. ''Now general managers are getting fired for losing huge amounts of money. General managers used to be able to put the blame on managers. Now you have a situation where they have to share the responsbility. The financial stakes have become so great, you're not only losing games but you're losing games and millions of dollars. The general manager is being blamed for it.''\n\nLike Gillick, John Schuerholz is a general manager who need not fear for his job. He is the general manager of the Kansas City Royals and he has continued the successful operation he inherited four years ago from Joe Burke. The Royals have won six division championships in the last 10 seasons and have averaged slightly more than two million fans, excluding the strike season.\n\n''If a team lost money, it used to be maybe $400,000 or $500,000,'' Schuerholz said. ''Now it can be $6 million or $7 million. If the person responsible for that doesn't do his job well, it translates into millions of dollars in losses. So they're being paid more and they're being fired more often. The dollars we're talking about that this man impacts makes his job different.''\n\nThe general manager, Schuerholz went on, is responsible for creating a product. ''That's what his organization markets,'' he said. ''So it goes back to the product he puts together. Some people say the general manager is more important than the manager. He puts the organization together, the farm system, hires the manager, gets the players. If all of that isn't successful, the organization loses money.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
