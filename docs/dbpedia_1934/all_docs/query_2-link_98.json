        "text": "When waivers expire on ex-Dodger pitcher Steve Howe July 15, chances are good that he eventually will sign with another major league club as a free agent, according to a sampling of big-league executives.\n\nMost of the seven interviewed officials expressed reservations about taking a chance on Howe, given his history of drug abuse and personal problems. But there was agreement that Howe will find employment somewhere, quite likely with a contender in need of bullpen help.\n\nNot everyone was happy about it.\n\n“I think it’s unfortunate, but somebody probably will take a shot at him,” said one prominent National League general manager, who requested his name not be used.\n\n“The (Alan) Wiggins thing is an example. And that’s a tragedy. You can gather from that how I feel about taking Howe on my team.”\n\nWiggins, despite an acknowledged drug relapse this spring, was acquired by the Baltimore Orioles in a trade from the San Diego Padres. In his first game with the Orioles Friday night, he reached base safely three times, stole a base and singled home a run.\n\n“An awful lot of clubs would be very wary of taking a chance on Howe,” another National League general manager said. “Even if they needed pitching, they wouldn’t be interested.\n\n“We don’t know if Howe is OK or not. The Dodgers know what they’re doing. They’re not going to let somebody go if they feel he has future value.”\n\nBill Giles, president of the Philadelphia Phillies, said that before the Dodgers gave Howe his unconditional release, they asked if the Phillies were interested in trading for him. Giles said they weren’t.\n\n“I have a hunch there will be interest, but we’re not interested,” Giles said. “Our bullpen is pretty set. (Don) Carman and (Dave) Rucker are both left-handers.\n\n“But if I was a betting man, there’s much better than a 50-50 chance that someone, particularly someone who has a chance of winning it, will take a chance on him.”\n\nDave Dombrowski, assistant general manager of the Chicago White Sox, said that if Howe and his attorney, Jim Hawkins, contacted the White Sox, the team would listen.\n\n“I’d have to say we’d listen to their situation, but I’m not saying we’d definitely take him,” Dombrowski said. “But we’ll always listen to someone.”\n\nWhite Sox reliever Bob James is tied for the American League lead in saves with 17, but Chicago could use a left-hander as a setup man for James.\n\nHowever, Howe said last week upon his release that he needed a “relocation and reduction of stress” and cited the pressures of playing in a large city like Los Angeles. Chicago would seem to pose similar pressures.\n\nFor the same reason, Anaheim would appear to be out of the question.\n\n“I think the Dodgers are on the right track,” Angel Vice President Mike Port said. “Priority No. 1 has to be Steve Howe and his stabilization. Get him back on an even basis, and the baseball will follow thereafter.\n\n“Because of the job our pitching staff has done, the natural question for us would be, who would we replace (with Howe)?”\n\nA smaller market like Seattle, on the other hand, seemingly would offer a less stressful environment.\n\n“That’s true,” said Hal Keller, general manager of the Seattle Mariners. “But it’s still the major leagues, and he’d still be facing major league hitters.”\n\nKeller would not comment on whether the Mariners had an interest in Howe and refused to say whether the Dodgers previously had contacted Seattle about a possible deal.\n\nCleveland Vice President Joe Klein said the Indians had no interest. “He would not be an impact player for this club,” said Klein, whose club is in last place in the American League East. “If we were in second place, maybe it would be different, but we’re in seventh.”\n\nThe condition of Howe’s left elbow also is of concern to some teams. Howe had surgery to re-route the ulnar nerve on Jan. 9.\n\n“There’s no doubt if he was in his old form, he could help a club,” one American League official said. “But we don’t know how he is.”\n\nAt one time, Howe was arguably the most dominating left-handed reliever in the league.\n\n“Frankly, we don’t have any interest,” said John Mullen, general manager of the Atlanta Braves. “We have 11 pitchers, and we’re trying to make room for Len Barker.\n\n“But it’s a sad thing. He had so much talent when he came up, we regarded him as one of the best left-handed relief pitchers in the game. To have these things happen to him is really a shame.”"
