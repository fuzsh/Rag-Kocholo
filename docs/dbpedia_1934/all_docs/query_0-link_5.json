        "text": "In the process of conducting research for the “Minors vs. Majors” chapter for my upcoming book “Hardball Retroactive,” I tabulated the overall won-loss records among the minor league affiliates for every Major League franchise since 1963. Further investigation allowed me to ascertain the largest gaps between MLB teams and their farm systems, divided into two distinct charts:\n\nteams with the best overall minor league winning percentage as compared to their Major League record during the same season\n\nteams with the top Major League winning percentage as compared to their overall minor league record during the same season\n\nthe second chart in each section depicts the Major League winning percentage for the selected teams over a ten-year period\n\nTerminology\n\nOW – Overall Wins (All Minor League Affiliates, Season) OL – Overall Losses (All Minor League Affiliates, Season) OWPCT – Overall Win Percentage (All Minor League Affiliates, Season) ORANK – Overall Rank (All Minor League Affiliates, Season) Y0 – Y9 – Major League Win Percentage over Ten Year Period Y0-RANK – Major League Win Percentage Rank in “Year Zero (0)” RankDiff – absolute value of the difference between ORANK and Y0-RANK\n\nExample: The 1997 Oakland Athletics concluded the season with a record of 65-97. This equates to a .401 WPCT in Year 0. The A’s affiliates combined for an overall record of 372-324 (.534 OWPCT). Oakland’s record in the subsequent season (1998), denoted as Year 1, improved to 74-88 (.457 WPCT-Y1).

The Metropolitans finished last in the National League with a record of 61-101 (.377), residing in the cellar for the fifth time in six seasons. Yet there was a glimmer of hope as Tom Seaver (16-13, 2.76) captured Rookie of the Year honors. Primarily under the direction of Joe McDonald and Nelson Burbink, the Mets’ farm system thrived from 1966 through 1971 and sustained the big league squad into the mid-1970’s. The “Miracle Mets” shocked the world in ’69 and the Mets played above .500 baseball for five straight seasons (1969-73). The talent stockpile included Nolan Ryan, Jerry Koosman, Ed Figueroa, Jon Matlack, Tug McGraw, Amos Otis and Ken Singleton. Ryan missed most of ’67 due to military service after obliterating the opposition in the Western Carolinas League, striking out 272 batters in 183 innings as the Greenville Mets’ ace in ’66. The “Ryan Express” whiffed a MLB-record 5714 hitters and spun 7 no-hitters over the course of his remarkable 27-year career. Koosman eclipsed the 20-win mark in ’76 and ’79 and racked up 222 victories with 51 WAR through 19 MLB seasons. “Kooz” placed runner-up in the 1968 NL Rookie of the Year and 1976 NL Cy Young balloting. Figueroa enjoyed a four-year run from 1975 to 1978 with 18 victories per year and an ERA of 3.12. Matlack (15-10, 2.32) merited 1972 NL Rookie of the Year honors and supplied a 3.18 ERA over thirteen big-league campaigns. McGraw saved 180 contests with a 3.14 ERA in nearly two decades of Major League competition. Generating 40.7 WAR in 17 campaigns (14 as the Royals’ center fielder), Otis twice led the American League in doubles and swiped 29 bags yearly during the Seventies. The runner-up for 1979 AL MVP with a .295 BA, 35 round-trippers and 111 ribbies, Singleton coaxed 90+ bases on balls eight times and paced the NL with a .425 OBP in 1973. 1967 New York Mets Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Bernie Smith LF .309 4 52 Richard Noe 13-7 1.37 Don Bosch CF .263 5 31 Jim McAndrew 10-8 1.47 Ken Singleton RF .277 4 41 Danny Frisella 11-5 1.88 Mike Jorgensen 1B .295 5 41 Tug McGraw 10-9 1.99 Bob Heise 2B .298 1 37 Jerry Koosman 11-10 2.43 Tony Canzano SS .248 3 34 Arsenio Diaz 3B .258 17 58 BULLPEN WLS ERA Steve Chilcott C .290 6 45 Jay Carden 13-7 1.69 Malcolm Warren 12-6 2.25 BENCH POS BA HR RBI Ed Bauta 4-4 2.22 Tom Robson 1B .319 12 44 Ed Figueroa 12-5 2.05 Denny Lundgren 1B .225 18 54 Jim Bethke 10-8 2.58 James Plant 3B .226 15 55 Michael Gerich OF .271 6 30 Johnny Lewis OF .218 11 41 Jerry Morales OF .248 8 48 Greg Goossen C .234 11 37\n\nRebranded as the Rangers after abandoning Washington D.C. prior to the start of the 1972 season, Texas toiled through consecutive 100-loss campaigns. Farm director Hal Keller supervised a talented crew which topped all organizations with a .584 OWPCT in ’73 and runner-up with a .566 mark in the following year. Under the fiery leadership of Billy Martin, the Rangers placed second in the American League West with 84 victories in 1974. Texas notched 94 wins in ’77 and seized the runner-up slot in consecutive seasons (1977-78). Known as the “Human Rain Delay” for the inordinate amount of time he required to finish an at-bat, Mike Hargrove secured the 1974 AL Rookie of the Year with a .323 BA. The first-sacker eclipsed the century mark in bases on balls four times and paced the Junior Circuit with a .424 OBP in ’81. Four-time National League batting champion Bill Madlock retired after 15 seasons with a .305 lifetime BA. Jim Sundberg accumulated six consecutive Gold Glove awards (1976-1981) as the Rangers’ backstop. Lenny Randle eclipsed the .300 mark twice in a four-year span (’74 and ’77). Len Barker led the American League in strikeouts in back-to-back seasons (1980-81), recorded 19 wins for the Tribe in ’80 and pitched a perfect game against Toronto on May 15, 1981. 1973 Texas Rangers Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Don Castle LF .325 9 88 Jeff Scott 14-9 2.83 Vernon Wilkins CF .310 3 47 Jackie Brown 10-1 2.34 Doug Ault RF .276 19 88 Rick Henninger 12-5 3.81 Tom Robson DH .316 38 126 Wade Frye 8-6 2.49 Mike Hargrove 1B .351 12 82 Len Barker 7-1 1.37 Mike Cubbage 2B .312 13 65 Pete Mackanin SS .302 7 55 BULLPEN WLS ERA Bill Madlock 3B .338 22 90 Stan Thomas 15 2.75 Jim Sundberg C .298 5 40 Wayne Popiolek 4-3 2.47 Michael Miller 4-5 2.41 BENCH POS BA HR RBI James Raynor 4-5 2.82 Steve Greenberg 1B .281 8 71 Dave Moharter 8-5 3.23 Roy Howell 3B .242 15 47 Bob Jones OF .277 9 71 Ron Pruitt OF .277 8 55 Dave Moates OF .302 4 63 Dave Criscione C .276 4 47\n\nThe Astros earned high OWPCT marks in successive seasons (2012-13) while ranking last in the Majors over three straight years (2011-13). We will focus on 2013 as the organization placed runner-up with a .569 OWPCT. While the jury is still out on the long-term results of the franchise’s rebuilding plans, Houston’s near-term triumphs include a playoff berth in 2015 and a victory in the 2017 World Series. George Springer claimed the 2017 World Series MVP award with a .379 BA and 5 long balls after averaging 29 doubles, 32 circuit clouts and 114 runs scored over the past two seasons. Carlos Correa, the #1 selection in the 2012 Draft, secured 2015 AL Rookie of the Year honors and produced 28 two-baggers, 22 jacks and a .288 BA for the Astros in three seasons. Jonathan Villar pilfered 32 bags annually over six minor league seasons with the Phillies and Astros. “Villi” ripped 38 two-base knocks and 19 four-baggers while pacing the NL with 62 stolen bases in 2016 for the Brew Crew. Domingo Santana (.278/30/85) capitalized on a full-time role as Milwaukee’s right fielder in 2017. Chris Devenski (12-9, 2.38) thrived as a reliever for the Astros since his promotion in 2016 after a severe flogging as a member of the Lancaster JetHawks (A+) three years earlier (4-2, 7.88). Lance McCullers, Jr. furnished a 3.18 ERA and struck out 10.1 batters per nine innings with the Quad Cities River Bandits (A) in 2013. He maintained a 19-16 record with a 3.60 ERA and 10.2 K/9 through 58 starts with Houston (2015-17). 2013 Houston Astros Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Andrew Aplin LF .278 9 107 David Martinez 14-4 2.57 George Springer CF .303 37 108 Jake Buchanan 12-7 2.96 Preston Tucker RF .297 25 103 A.

Arizona returned to respectability in Year 3, capturing a playoff berth in 2017 with a 93-69 mark in the regular season. David Peralta aka “Freight Train” paced the NL in triples (10) while establishing career-highs with a .312 BA, 17 jacks and 78 ribbies for the D-backs in his sophomore year (2015). The pitcher-turned-outfielder spent three seasons in Independent Ball before Arizona signed him as a free agent in 2013, where he quickly worked his way through the minors to merit a promotion to the big leagues in June 2014. Twice involved in three-team trades early in his career, Didi Gregorius slumped to a .226 BA in his second season with Arizona, earning a demotion to the Reno Aces (AAA). The slick-fielding shortstop added power to his game, boasting a .281 BA with 30 two-base hits and 22 round-trippers over the last two years for the Yankees. Jake Lamb mustered 30 doubles and 30 circuit clouts while driving in 98 runs per year over the last two seasons. “Lambo” reached the Majors in 2014 following a stellar campaign chiefly with the Mobile BayBears (AA) where he batted .327 with 39 two-baggers. 2014 Arizona Diamondbacks Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Alex Glenn LF .285 24 89 Brandon Sinnery 14-7 4.02 David Peralta CF .297 6 46 Aaron Blair 9-5 3.56 Danny Dorn RF .310 12 50 Braden Shipley 7-8 3.86 Rudy Flores 1B .301 28 100 Ryan Doran 8-3 2.71 Garrett Weber 2B .318 9 48 A.J.

Reaping the benefits of a budding minor league operation helmed by Joe McIlvane and Steve Schryver, New York reeled off seven consecutive seasons above .500 (1984-1990) culminating in a World Series victory in ’86. Dwight “Doc” Gooden whiffed 300 batsmen in 191 innings as an 18-year old at Lynchburg (A) while teammate Lenny “Nails” Dykstra ignited the lineup with a .358 BA, 105 stolen bases and 132 runs scored. Gooden logged a 157-85 mark with a 3.10 ERA, 1.175 WHIP and 45.3 WAR through 11 seasons with the Metropolitans. Dykstra (.305/19/77) placed runner-up in the 1993 NL MVP race as the center fielder for the Phillies as he topped the circuit in hits (194), bases on balls (129) and runs scored (143). Kevin “World” Mitchell seized the 1989 NL MVP award, posting a league-high 47 moon-shots, 125 ribbies and a .635 SLG. 1983 New York Mets Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA John Christensen LF .322 14 87 Dwight Gooden 19-4 2.50 Lenny Dykstra CF .358 8 81 Kevin A.

On a positive note, the Rangers’ .565 OWPCT ensured a swift recovery. Nomar Mazara swatted 20 big-flies in his first two big league seasons and eclipsed the 100-RBI plateau in 2017. Joey Gallo dialed long distance 41 times in 2017 despite a .209 BA and 196 strikeouts. Part of the ransom sent to the Phillies in return for Cole Hamels, right fielder Nick Williams debuted in 2017 with a .288 BA, 14 doubles and 12 homers in 83 games. 2014 Texas Rangers Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Ryan Cordell LF .318 13 59 Andrew Faulkner 12-5 2.73 Jared Hoying CF .271 26 78 Chi Chi Gonzalez 12-6 2.66 Nomar Mazara RF .271 22 89 Sam Wolff 9-5 3.37 Ryan Rua DH .306 18 74 Alec Asher 11-11 3.80 Preston Beck 1B .255 11 77 Jerad Eickhoff 10-9 4.08 Seth Spivey 2B .332 3 27 Hanser Alberto SS .273 7 58 BULLPEN WLS ERA Joey Gallo 3B .271 42 106 Phil Klein 10 0.52 J.P.

The Rockies struggled for five seasons to return to relevance, emerging with a Wild Card berth in 2017. Charlie Blackmon (.331/37/104) collected the 2017 NL batting crown and placed fifth in the NL MVP race while leading the circuit with 213 base hits, 14 triples, 137 runs and 387 total bases. Corey Dickerson drilled 30+ doubles in back-to-back seasons (2016-17). Trevor Story (.272/27/72) placed fourth in the 2016 NL Rookie of the Year balloting. David Dahl (.315/7/24) missed the entire 2017 campaign due to injury after a promising debut through the final two months of the previous year. Will Harris owns a 2.99 ERA with a 1.105 WHIP and 9.5 K/9 in 290 relief outings through six big-league seasons. 2012 Colorado Rockies Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Andrew Brown LF .308 24 98 Christian Bergman 16-5 3.65 David Dahl CF .379 9 57 Ben Alsup 14-5 3.63 Kyle Parker RF .308 23 73 Tyler Anderson 12-3 2.47 Harold Riggins 1B .302 19 76 Edwar Cabrera 11-5 3.05 Taylor Featherston 2B .299 12 53 Brandon Hynick 9-7 3.32 Trevor Story SS .277 18 63 Brendan Harris 3B .317 9 63 BULLPEN WLS ERA Will Swanner C .302 16 61 Adam Jorgenson 16 1.86 Kenny Roberts 4-1 1.85 BENCH POS BA HR RBI Will Harris 4-1 2.08 Jordan Ribera 1B .285 10 54 Russell Brewer 1-3 2.09 Josh Rutledge SS .306 13 35 Mike Ekstrom 3-1 2.53 Charlie Blackmon OF .289 6 37 Corey Dickerson OF .304 22 81 Matt McBride OF .344 10 87 Julian Yan OF .282 16 57 Tom Murphy C .288 6 38\n\nPhiladelphia leads all franchises with three entries in the Best OWPCT – Worst WPCT chart. Steve “Lefty” Carlton (27-10, 1.97) recorded nearly half of the victories for the hapless 1972 crew. The Fightin’ Phillies resurfaced in 1975, kicking off a decade of winning baseball in the City of Brotherly Love. Mike Schmidt made his MLB debut in September 1972 following an exceptional year with the Eugene Emeralds (AAA). “Schmitty” launched 36 moon-shots and plated 104 baserunners per year from 1974 to 1987 counting 8 seasons atop the charts. The 3-time NL MVP and 10-time Gold Glove winner retired in 1989 with 548 home runs and 116 WAR. Bob Boone similarly earned a promotion to the Phillies subsequent to an outstanding campaign in Eugene, hitting at a .308 clip with 32 doubles and 17 jacks. The seven-time Gold Glove backstop caught 2,225 games over a 19-year career. Bobby Abreu (.316/25/79) and Scott Rolen (.298/26/89) highlighted an otherwise mundane roster that managed only 65 wins. Excepting 2002, the Phils played at or above .500 ball from 2001 to 2012. The Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons (AAA) featured shortstop Jimmy Rollins, who made his big-league debut in September 2000 following a productive year comprising 28 doubles, 11 triples, 12 homers and 24 steals. “J-Roll” captured the 2007 NL MVP award, leading the league with 20 three-base hits and 139 tallies to complement career-highs in batting average (.296), base hits (212), homers (30), RBI (94) and total bases (380). Marlon Byrd eclipsed the century mark for runs scored in three successive seasons in the Phillies’ farm system (2000-02) while batting .307 with 29 doubles and 20 taters in the same stretch. Playing for 10 teams in a career that spanned 15 years, Byrd squashed at least 20 big-flies four times and set a career-high with 43 two-baggers and 89 RBI for the Rangers in 2009. Ryan Madson fashioned a record of 59-35 with an ERA of 3.58 during his minor league career including a 14-5 mark with a 2.59 ERA with the Piedmont Boll Weevils (A) in 2000. Converted to relief work upon promotion to the Majors in September 2003, “Mad Dog” twice saved at least 30 contests in a season and holds an ERA of 3.35 entering the 2018 campaign. The 2015 squad held the fourth-best OWPCT while struggling to a 63-99 mark. It remains to be seen if the current group of prospects can restore the Phillies to playoff contention. Rhys Hoskins established a Major League record when he homered 18 times in his first 34 games (2017). “Hosk” clobbered 34 blasts and knocked in 104 baserunners per year during his ascent to the big leagues (2016-17). One year subsequent to his selection as the Phillies #1 pick in the June 2014 Draft, Aaron Nola debuted with a 6-2 mark and a 3.59 ERA in 13 starts. Nola struck out 184 batsmen in 168 innings in 2017 and fashioned ratios comparable to his minor league output (2.57 ERA, 1.057 WHIP). 1972 Philadelphia Phillies Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Joe Lis LF .338 26 58 Dave Downs 15-7 2.41 Mike Anderson CF .298 17 56 Donald Kreke 15-7 3.14 Jerry Martin RF .316 12 112 Chuck Kniffin 13-1 2.11 Bob Spence 1B .294 18 61 Roy J.

Only the lowly Pirates tallied more losses in the Major Leagues with a 57-105 mark. Seattle’s farm system, on the other hand, finished second with an overall winning percentage of .538. Kyle Seager blistered the opposition with a .340 BA and 37 two-base knocks at three minor league affiliates (2010-2011). “Corey’s Brother” merited All-Star status along with a Gold Glove at the hot corner in 2014. Seager produced 33 doubles, 25 circuit clouts and 85 ribbies annually in six full seasons since 2012. Despite injury and inconsistency during his five big-league seasons, Michael Pineda carries a 1.190 WHIP and 9.1 K/9 into the 2018 season. An All-Star selection in his rookie year (2009), Pineda fashioned a 31-14 mark with a 2.50 ERA and a WHIP of 1.186 during his stint in the M’s farm system. 2010 Seattle Mariners Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Jake Shaffer LF .336 9 78 Anthony Vasquez 11-9 2.46 Greg Halman CF .243 33 80 Michael Pineda 11-4 3.36 Johermyn Chavez RF .315 32 96 Luke French 11-3 2.94 Mike Wilson DH .278 25 78 Erasmo Ramirez 10-4 2.97 Rich Poythress 1B .315 31 130 James Gillheeney 10-11 3.55 Kyle Seager 2B .345 14 74 Nick Franklin SS .283 23 65 BULLPEN WLS ERA Nate Tenbrink 3B .318 14 70 Forrest Snow 9 0.60 Guillermo Quiroz C .286 7 46 Anthony Varvaro 9 4.02 Brian Moran 6-1 1.73 BENCH POS BA HR RBI Stephen Penney 5-3 3.53 Dennis Raben 1B .291 20 66 Robert Rohrbaugh 4-2 3.70 Kevin Mailloux 3B .296 15 52 Ramon Morla 3B .323 17 49 Matthew Cerione OF .287 12 42 Kevin Rivers OF .332 11 48 Blake Ochoa C .285 9 32\n\nThe 1982 Athletics compiled the second-best OWPCT (.635) in the last 55 seasons, trailing only the 1979 Yankees (.639). Oakland secured four playoff berths and played above .500 ball in six successive campaigns (1987-1992). Tony Phillips scored 104 runs, coaxed 107 bases on balls and laced 27 two-base hits per year over an eight-year span (1990-97). The Expos first-round selection in the 1978 Amateur Draft equaled his minor league OBP of .374 (in the Athletics’ system) over an 18-year career. Mike Davis leveraged a .299 BA with 38 steals for the Tacoma Tigers (AAA) in 1981-82 to attain a full-time role as Oakland’s right fielder from 1983-87. Registering 27 doubles, 16 dingers and 23 steals annually during that timeframe, Davis established personal-bests in ’85 with a .287 BA, 34 two-baggers, 24 homers, 82 ribbies and 92 runs scored. 1982 Oakland Athletics Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Jim Bennett LF .278 29 115 Mark Ferguson 17-6 1.77 Mike Davis CF .316 12 68 Chris Codiroli 16-4 2.03 Tom Romano RF .340 26 98 Tim Conroy 15-4 2.25 Dave Hudgens DH .301 24 82 Mike Warren 15-4 2.92 Phillip Strom 1B .294 15 73 Eric Barry 13-2 2.40 Keith Drumright 2B .329 0 29 Tony Phillips SS .297 4 47 BULLPEN WLS ERA Bob Bathe 3B .288 9 41 Jeff Kobernus 13 1.72 Bill Bathe C .281 17 57 Paul Josephson 13 1.92 Ed Myers 12 1.63 BENCH POS BA HR RBI Todd Fischer 8 1.12 Jim Eppard 1B .376 1 41 Allen Edwards 12-4 3.21 Greg Robles 1B .371 7 52 Danny Goodwin OF .301 11 58 Anthony Laurenzi OF .362 8 38 Mitchell Page OF .305 14 59 Charlie O’Brien C .295 6 46\n\nPale Hose prospects Frank E. Thomas, Robin Ventura and Jack McDowell contributed to a solid seven-year run in the Windy City as the team yielded winning records in six seasons (1990-96) including consecutive first-place finishes within the division in ’93 and ’94. The organization yielded a .582 OWPCT in 1989 in stark contrast to the Southsiders’ last-place finish in the AL West (69-92, .429). In addition to the three superstars listed above, Chicago also drafted Ray Durham and Alex Fernandez during Larry Himes’ stint as the club’s General Manager. Thomas amassed 70.6 WAR over a 19-year career encompassing back-to-back AL MVP awards (1993-94), 521 home runs and a slash line of .301/.419/.555. Ventura collected 6 Gold Gloves at the hot corner while accruing 49.4 WAR in sixteen seasons. Lance “One Dog” Johnson delivered a .304 BA with 39 steals per season as a farmhand for the Redbirds and the Pale Hose, virtually identical to the .299 BA and 34 stolen bases that he averaged in full-time play with the White Sox and Mets over an eight-year span (1990-97). 1989 Chicago White Sox Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Derek Lee LF .286 11 48 Sam Chavez 18-6 2.23 Lance Johnson CF .304 0 28 Carlos De La Cruz 15-7 2.55 Todd Trafton RF .259 12 56 Riley Stephens 14-7 2.12 Frank E.

The Athletics’ farm system featured a future Rookie of the Year (Ben Grieve, 1998) and MVP (Miguel Tejada, 2002) in 1997. Two years later, the Green and Gold led all franchises with a .573 OWPCT, capping a triumphant 12-year run for their minor league operation. Grieve (.350/31/136) annihilated the opposition with Huntsville (AA) and Edmonton (AAA) then slashed 32 two-base hits and launched 21 moon-shots per year through a half-decade with the A’s and Devil Rays (1998-2002). Tejada tallied 51 WAR in 16 seasons and produced a .291 BA with 35 doubles, 24 bombs, 100 ribbies and 94 runs scored annually as a starting shortstop from 1999 to 2010. Excepting 2007, “Miggy” played in at least 156 contests every year during that timeframe. Ramon J. Hernandez compiled a .301 BA with 24 two-baggers, 17 jacks and 104 RBI over two seasons for the Visalia Oaks (A) and Huntsville Stars (AA) in 1997-98.

The talent pool from the 2016 minor league roster bodes well for their near-term success, including Gold Glove center fielder Byron Buxton, shortstop Jorge Polanco and starting pitcher Jose Berrios. Buxton (.334/12/77) split a splendid 2013 season between the Cedar Rapids Kernels (A) and the Fort Myers Miracle (A+), legging out 18 three-base hits, nabbing 55 bags and scoring 109 runs. The Gold Glove center fielder tagged 16 taters and swiped 29 bases for the Twinkies in 2017. A teammate of Buxton with the Kernels in ’13, Polanco contributed 32 doubles and 10 triples along with a .308 BA. “Chulo” assumed the starting shortstop job in the Twin Cities in 2017, lacing 30 two-baggers and driving in 74 runs. Berrios fared much better in his sophomore year, posting a 14-8 mark with a 3.89 ERA and a WHIP of 1.229. “La Maquina” aced his minor league assignments, fashioning a record of 49-25 with a 2.77 ERA, 1.075 WHIP and 9.6 K/9. 2016 Minnesota Twins Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Adam Walker LF .243 27 75 Stephen Gonsalves 13-5 2.06 Edgar Corcino CF .273 8 59 Felix Jorge 12-8 2.69 Daniel Palka RF .254 34 90 Jose Berrios 10-5 2.51 LaMonte Wade DH .293 8 51 Cody Stashak 10-5 2.80 Zander Wiel 1B .259 19 86 Fernando Romero 9-3 1.89 Luis Arraez 2B .347 3 66 Jorge Polanco SS .276 9 39 BULLPEN WLS ERA Nelson Molina 3B .300 2 43 T.

The only team in our survey to finish first in the Majors in winning percentage while the minor league operation ranked last is the 1984 Detroit Tigers. Victorious in 35 of their first 40 contests, the ’84 crew handily seized the World Series after dominating the Junior Circuit. Nearly replicating the feat three years later, the Kitties sustained their winning ways through 1988 before commencing a prolonged period of inferior play as the club finished below .500 fifteen times in seventeen seasons (1989-2005). Mike Henneman recorded 20 saves with a 3.63 ERA in 117 outings for the Tigers’ minor league affiliates. In ten big-league seasons he eclipsed the 20-save mark seven times and furnished a 3.21 career ERA. Chris Hoiles (.310/29/82) established personal-bests in virtually every offensive category in ’93. One of three Detroit farmhands included as “players to be named later” in an August 1988 transaction to acquire Fred Lynn from Baltimore, Hoiles averaged .282 with 15 wallops during his three-year stint in the Tigers’ system. 1984 Detroit Tigers Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Mark S.

Merely a handful of prospects panned out including Pedro Feliz, the third baseman who drilled 29 doubles and 18 long balls per year from 2004 to 2009. Sustained by four straight MVP seasons from Barry Bonds, the Giants remained a playoff contender until 2005, when Bonds suffered a knee injury and missed nearly the entire campaign. San Francisco endured sub-.500 ball through 2008 then returned to prominence with 3 World Series titles in 2010, 2012 and 2014. Ryan Vogelsong debuted with San Francisco in September 2000 after compiling a 3.89 ERA through three minor league seasons. Laboring to a 5.86 ERA through the ’06 campaign before revitalizing his career during a three-year stint in the Japan, Vogelsong thrived in 2011-12 as he averaged 14 wins to complement an ERA of 3.05. 2000 San Francisco Giants Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Carlos Valderrama LF .315 13 81 Jon Valenti 13-5 3.86 Brett Casper CF .243 15 70 Kurt Ainsworth 10-9 3.30 Jake Messner RF .320 19 68 Chad Zerbe 9-4 3.68 Damon Minor 1B .290 30 106 Jim Lynch 7-4 3.18 Ryan Luther 2B .300 7 48 Jerome Williams 7-6 2.94 Juan Melo SS .295 12 50 Pedro Feliz 3B .298 33 105 BULLPEN WLS ERA G.

The nadir occurred in 1998 when the Atlanta farm system posted the second-worst OWPCT among all franchises. Rafael Furcal scored at least 100 runs in four consecutive campaigns (2003-06) and pilfered 31 bags yearly over an eight-year stint (2000-07). The 2000 NL Rookie of the Year stockpiled 96 steals and tallied 96 runs between Macon (A) and Myrtle Beach (A+) in ’99 after nabbing nearly one base per contest in the previous year (60 SB in 66 games). Macon (A) profited from Marcus Giles’ breakout season in ’98 as the second-sacker clubbed 38 two-baggers and 37 round-trippers while hitting .329 with 111 runs scored and 108 RBI. The 2003 All-Star established career-highs in his first season in a starting capacity with 49 doubles, 21 clouts and a .316 BA. Mark DeRosa experienced a four-year stint as a starting super-sub from 2006 to 2009, rapping 30 doubles and 17 long balls per season with a .281 BA after clubbing 21 doubles annually over four campaigns in the upper minors (1998-2001). Bruce Chen (15-8, 3.09) shined as a member of the Greenville (AA) rotation and capped his effort with 4 September starts in ’98. Chen pitched for 11 MLB organizations and composed a winning record over 17 seasons despite a 4.62 ERA. Odalis Perez compiled a 2.95 ERA and struck out 9.8 batters per nine innings as a member of the Atlanta farm system. The southpaw attained All-Star status in 2002 with the Dodgers as he established personal-bests in victories (15), ERA (3.00) and WHIP (0.990). 1998 Atlanta Braves Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Gene Schall LF .300 22 73 Bruce Chen 15-8 3.09 George Lombard CF .308 22 65 Ruben Quevedo 11-5 3.24 Jeff Spencer RF .261 28 79 Micah Bowie 11-6 3.48 Ryan Lehr 1B .285 13 69 Kevin McGlinchy 10-9 3.34 Marcus Giles 2B .329 37 108 Rob Bell 7-9 3.28 Mark DeRosa SS .267 8 49 Wes Helms 3B .275 13 75 BULLPEN WLS ERA Steve Torrealba C .273 10 37 Joe Winkelsas 22 2.33 Will Fleck 14 2.65 BENCH POS BA HR RBI Adam Butler 14 3.60 Rafael Furcal 2B .328 0 23 Greg Mix 3-5 3.51 Steve Goodell SS .296 8 26 Odalis Perez 7-7 3.86 Howard Battle 3B .330 10 50 Travis Wilson 3B .330 10 52 Jerry Salzano OF .302 7 49 Jerry Simmons OF .275 11 40 Dax Norris C .261 9 47\n\nMinnesota eclipsed the .500 mark in 8 of 9 seasons since Ron Gardenhire assumed the managerial reins in 2002. When the minor league system plummeted from the fourth-best OWPCT in 2009 to the worst out of 30 teams one year later, the big league crew followed suit as the Twins posted 90+ losses in four straight seasons (2011-14). Ben Revere, the Twins first-round selection in the 2007 Amateur Draft, scorched the opposition with a .328 BA and 37 steals yearly prior to his promotion to the big leagues in September 2010. “Revy” paced the National League with 184 safeties in 2014, surpassed the .300 plateau in batting average for three successive seasons (2013-15) and averaged 35 steals over a five-year period (2011-15). Trevor Plouffe slammed a career-high 24 wallops in 2012 and ripped 40 doubles two years later. “Special T” socked 28 two-base knocks per year as a Minnesota minor leaguer over a half-decade (2006-2010). 2010 Minnesota Twins Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Ben Revere LF .305 1 23 Kyle Gibson 11-6 2.96 Aaron Hicks CF .279 8 49 Dan Osterbrock 9-9 2.65 Angel Morales RF .280 5 55 Liam Hendriks 8-4 1.74 Joe Benson DH .259 27 62 Bobby Lanigan 5-4 3.48 Brock Peterson 1B .245 19 57 Tom Stuifbergen 6-4 2.98 Steve Singleton 2B .267 7 50 Trevor Plouffe SS .244 15 49 BULLPEN WLS ERA Anderson Hidalgo 3B .316 3 28 Anthony Slama 17 2.20 Danny Rams C .238 16 69 Kane Holbrooks 9 2.10 Dakota Watts 8 3.10 BENCH POS BA HR RBI Kyle Waldrop 5-3 2.57 Chris Parmelee 1B .285 8 61 Andrei Lobanov 3-2 2.64 Oswaldo Arcia OF .375 14 51 Danny Ortiz OF .259 11 43 Lance Ray OF .289 3 33 Brandon Roberts OF .327 3 38 Jose Morales C .264 3 25\n\nSt. Louis endured a seven-year stretch in which the minor league operation placed 25th or lower five times. While the Redbirds reached the playoffs six times in seven tries (2000-2006), the farm system finished dead last in OWPCT in 2001. Coco Crisp paced the AL with 49 steals in 2011, swiped at least 20 bags eight times and established career-highs in home runs (22) and runs scored (93) in 2013. Crisp furnished a .306 BA in back-to-back campaigns (2001-02) and made his MLB debut with the Tribe in August 2002 after his inclusion as the “player to be named later” in a deal for Chuck Finley. Bud Smith sizzled throughout a dominant stretch in the upper minors (2000-01), posting a 25-7 record with a 2.46 ERA and a WHIP of 1.170. Smith hurled a no-hitter against the Padres and placed fourth in the 2001 NL Rookie of the Year vote, but his star faded quickly and he was demoted after yielding a 6.94 ERA through 10 starts in his sophomore year. Three-time All-Star Dan Haren manufactured 13 wins per year with a 3.70 ERA and a 1.169 WHIP while starting at least 30 games in 11 straight seasons (2005-2015) after fashioning a 3.16 ERA and a WHIP of 1.130 as a Redbirds farmhand. 2001 St. Louis Cardinals Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Coco Crisp LF .306 11 47 Jimmy Journell 15-6 2.39 Chris Morris CF .294 2 39 Kevin Sprague 10-8 3.38 Dee Haynes RF .290 13 72 Chris Narveson 7-6 2.31 Chris Duncan 1B .260 16 75 Rick Ankiel 5-5 2.25 Stubby Clapp 2B .304 5 33 Blake Williams 4-10 2.43 Jutt Hileman SS .255 9 35 John Gall 3B .311 8 77 BULLPEN WLS ERA Keith McDonald C .261 11 42 Scotty Layfield 31 1.84 Jeremy Lambert 17 3.09 BENCH POS BA HR RBI Mike Crudale 9 3.25 Jesse Roman 1B .271 3 39 Doug Kohl 3-5 2.08 Bo Hart 2B .305 5 34 D.

Milwaukee paced the NL Central with 96 victories, securing the club’s second playoff berth since “Harvey’s Wallbangers” appeared in the 1982 World Series. Khris Davis clobbered 40+ clouts and surpassed the century mark in RBI during back-to-back seasons following a trade to Oakland in February 2016. “Khrush” drilled 26 doubles and 22 dingers for the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers (A) in 2010, then hit .350 with 21 two-base knocks in only 82 games two years later. Scooter Gennett stunned the baseball community when he rocked 4 home runs against the Cardinals on June 6, 2017. He obliterated his previous career-bests with 27 wallops and 97 ribbies for the Reds in 2017 after producing 30 doubles per year and a .298 BA as a Brewers prospect. Tyler Thornburg emerged as a late-inning weapon in 2016, striking out 90 batters in only 67 frames and saving 13 contests while furnishing an ERA of 2.15 with a 0.990 WHIP. “Thorny” delivered a 2.85 ERA with a 20-10 record spanning two seasons and four affiliates for the Brew Crew (2011-12). 2011 Milwaukee Brewers Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Khris Davis LF .280 17 84 Mike Fiers 13-3 1.86 Caleb Gindl CF .307 15 60 Tyler Thornburg 10-6 2.57 Brock Kjeldgaard RF .270 24 76 Wily Peralta 11-7 3.17 Mat Gamel 1B .310 28 96 Nick Bucci 8-11 3.84 Scooter Gennett 2B .300 9 51 Cody Scarpetta 8-5 3.85 Edwin Maysonet SS .290 3 39 Taylor Green 3B .336 22 91 BULLPEN WLS ERA Martin Maldonado C .287 11 59 Santo Manzanillo 17 1.75 Rob Wooten 8 3.09 BENCH POS BA HR RBI Dan Meadows 6-4 2.68 Erick Almonte 1B .303 6 42 Eric Marzec 4-2 1.69 T.J.

Despite a five-year slump on the farm, the O’s maintained their triumphant ways in the AL East through 1985. Cal Ripken Jr. rapped 29 two-base hits and 19 four-baggers per year over a three-year stint in the Baltimore system (1979-1981). The “Iron Man” attained comparable production across two decades in the big leagues, averaging 30 doubles and 22 blasts. Mike Boddicker crafted a 55-38 record with a 3.26 ERA and a 1.183 WHIP in the minors. He finished third in the balloting for 1983 AL Rookie of the Year with a 2.77 ERA to complement a 16-8 record, then earned All-Star status in ’84 while leading the American League with 20 wins and a 2.79 ERA. 1979 Baltimore Orioles Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Vern Thomas LF .273 14 69 Brooks Carey 14-9 2.81 John Denman CF .280 7 44 Mike Boddicker 13-9 4.24 Drungo Hazewood RF .231 21 64 Don Welchel 10-10 3.38 Tom Chism DH .312 11 60 Nate Snell 9-9 4.09 Dan Logan 1B .282 21 79 Dave Ford 6-5 3.55 Tom Eaton 2B .273 0 33 Bobby Bonner SS .291 7 67 BULLPEN WLS ERA Cal Ripken Jr. 3B .286 8 62 Billy Presley 18 1.45 Willie Royster C .307 4 26 Joe Kerrigan 11 3.51 William Purdy 7 2.82 BENCH POS BA HR RBI John Flinn 6-6 2.70 John Stefero 3B .275 8 42 Jeff Schneider 3-7 3.43 Ron Diggle OF .255 13 38 Stan Hendrickson OF .279 4 25 Mark Jurena OF .276 5 26 Dallas Williams OF .277 12 52 Dave Huppert C .223 5 37\n\nThe Chicago Cubs captured the division title in the National League East with 96 victories in 1984, ranking second in the Major Leagues behind the Tigers in winning percentage. Yet the Northsiders’ farm system languished in the midst of a three-year slump (1983-85), bottoming out with a .439 OWPCT in ’84. Over the ensuing decade Chicago only eclipsed the .500 mark twice (1989 and 1993). Future Hall of Fame right-hander Greg Maddux fashioned a 6-2 record with a 2.63 ERA in 14 games (12 starts) for the Pikeville Cubs (Rookie). Jamie Moyer prepared for a quarter-century in the Majors with 30 victories, a 2.43 ERA and a 1.070 WHIP over three seasons in the Chicago farm system. Subsequent to a fine ’82 season with Midland (AA), Joe Carter (.308/36/150) hammered opposing offerings and pilfered 51 bases over the next year and a half as an outfielder on the Iowa Cubs. Billy Hatcher registered a .295 BA with 107 runs, 12 triples and 65 steals over three seasons (1982-84) to merit a cup of coffee with the Cubs in ’84. 1984 Chicago Cubs Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Dan Norman LF .284 21 76 Steve Engel 11-7 2.68 Billy Hatcher CF .276 9 59 Johnny Abrego 10-10 2.54 Joe Carter RF .310 14 67 Jon Perlman 11-6 3.79 Joe Hicks 1B .266 37 90 Jamie Moyer 9-3 1.89 Gary Jones 2B .291 6 44 Tim Grachen 6-12 3.39 Dan Rohn SS .268 8 46 Tom Lombarski 3B .269 15 47 BULLPEN WLS ERA Don Werner C .283 25 77 Brad Blevins 19 3.59 Porfi Altamirano 17 3.03 BENCH POS BA HR RBI Ron Meridith 8 3.17 Jeff Jones 1B .304 20 82 Greg Bell 8-1 1.80 Trey Brooks 2B .261 14 43 Jim Phillips 7-7 3.25 Bryan House 2B .270 6 37 Rick Hopkins SS .272 6 33 Bruce Crabbe 3B .307 4 26 Jim Dickerson OF .277 14 64 Joe Henderson C .260 9 38\n\nOakland appeared in three consecutive World Series from 1988 to 1990, yielding winning percentages above .600 in each season. The Athletics organizational record dipped below .500 in ’88 before rebounding with a vengeance, compiling twelve straight campaigns with a winning record (1989-2000). Felix Jose garnered a promotion in September 1988 after hitting at a .317 clip with 29 doubles for Tacoma (AAA). The right fielder achieved All-Star status in ’91 when he set personal-bests with a .305 BA and 40 two-base hits. Scott Brosius smacked 39 two-baggers and 23 long balls with Huntsville (AA) in ’90. Brosius (.300/19/98) capped an All-Star season with the 1998 World Series MVP award. Ron Coomer provided a glimpse of his Major League potential as the third-sacker for Modesto (A) in ’88, thumping 23 doubles and 17 big-flies while plating 85 baserunners.

The Bucs farm system experienced a nearly parallel collapse, ranking among the bottom half of the OWPCT charts in fourteen successive campaigns (1988-2001). Granted free agency in ’91 after toiling over six years in the Atlanta system, Al L. Martin finally spent an entire season on a Major League roster as Pittsburgh’s primary left fielder in ’93. A versatile threat on the farm with 26 steals and 21 two-baggers per season (1986-1992), Martin contributed his supreme output in ’96 when he established career-highs in batting average (.300), runs scored (101), hits (189), doubles (40), RBI (72) and stolen bases (38). Carlos Garcia stroked 21 two-base knocks and nabbed 22 bags annually as a Bucs farmhand (1987-1992). Garcia compiled a .280 BA with 20 doubles and 15 stolen bases per season during his stint as the Pirates’ starting second baseman (1993-96). A .307 minor league batting average vaulted Kevin Young to the big leagues in ’92, yet he struggled to secure a full-time job until five years later when he returned to Pittsburgh following a singular campaign in Kansas City. “Little Hurt” topped 40 doubles, 25 homers and 100 ribbies in back-to-back seasons (1998-99) and averaged 31 two-baggers and 20 taters as the starting first baseman for the Bucs covering a six-year stretch (1997-2002). Corner infielder Tim Wakefield converted to mound work after scuffling to a .189 BA at Watertown (A-) in 1988. A record of 25-12 with a 3.09 ERA convinced the Pirates’ brass to recall the knuckleballer in July 1992. Wakefield placed third in the 1992 NL Rookie of the Year and the 1995 AL Cy Young balloting while winning 200 games over a career that spanned 19 big-league seasons. 1992 Pittsburgh Pirates Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Al Martin LF .305 20 59 John Hope 11-8 3.47 Keith Thomas CF .280 20 66 Tim Wakefield 10-3 3.06 Eddie Zambrano RF .284 16 79 Rich Robertson 9-7 3.12 Rich Aude 1B .283 11 63 Dave Doorneweerd 9-13 3.04 Jim Krevokuch 2B .292 7 59 Rick White 8-16 3.94 Carlos Garcia SS .303 13 70 Kevin Young 3B .314 8 65 BULLPEN WLS ERA Brian Dorsett C .289 21 102 Blas Minor 18 2.43 Joe Ausanio 15 2.90 BENCH POS BA HR RBI M.

Oakland’s farm system failed to produce a winning mark in the final decade of Charlie Finley’s ownership (1971-1980). The Big Green Machine ranked worst among all MLB teams in OWPCT during the ’73 and ’74 campaigns after finishing next-to-last in ’72. “Disco” Dan Ford achieved personal-bests in batting average (.290), home runs (21), RBI (101) and runs scored (100) as the Angels won their first division title in 1979. Ford manufactured a .354 BA and a .667 SLG during his second season with the Burlington Bees (A) in ’72. Manny Trillo composed a .306 BA with 26 two-base hits per year in successive seasons with Oakland’s triple-A ball club (1972-73). The four-time All-Star second baseman collected a trio of Gold Glove awards in four campaigns with the Phillies (1979-1982). Phil Garner laced 29 doubles to complement a .330 BA with the Tucson Toros (AAA) in ’74. “Scrap Iron” amassed 26 two-base knocks and 22 stolen bases per year while alternating starting assignments between second and third base over a nine-year stretch (1975-1983). Claudell Washington registered 30+ thefts four times and averaged .279 with 20 steals as a starting outfielder through fifteen seasons (1975-1989). The two-time All-Star batted .330 as an Oakland prospect. Chet Lemon’s .877 fielding percentage in 318 games at the hot corner compelled a position change to center field in ’76 following a trade to the White Sox in June 1975 for Stan Bahnsen. “The Jet” set career-highs with a .318 BA, 86 ribbies and a League-leading 44 doubles in ’79. Mike Norris (22-9, 2.53) fashioned a WHIP of 1.048 and placed runner-up in the 1980 AL Cy Young race. The smooth-fielding hurler delivered an 8-4 record and a 2.21 ERA for the Burlington Bees (A) in 1972 and later collected back-to-back Gold Glove awards (1980-81) as a key member of the Oakland rotation. Mound mate Steve McCatty tallied 14 victories in consecutive campaigns (1980-81) and claimed the ERA title with a 2.33 mark while finishing second in the 1981 AL Cy Young vote. McCatty flourished as a reliever with the Vancouver Canadians (AAA) in ’78, notching 7 wins and 11 saves with a 3.11 ERA in 39 outings but pitched almost exclusively as a starter throughout his 9-year career with the A’s. 1972 Oakland Athletics Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Douglas King LF .266 14 61 Buddy Copeland 11-6 2.40 Kirk Allison CF .281 2 38 Bill Kelso 11-7 3.22 Dan Ford RF .354 18 61 Glenn Abbott 9-16 2.96 Champ Summers DH .308 10 54 Bill VanBommel 9-9 3.51 Reggie J.

On the farm, the operation faltered momentarily as the Reds’ affiliates combined for the third-worst OWPCT in 1970 before rebounding to the third-best mark in the ensuing year. Milt Wilcox generated 12.4 career WAR, primarily as a member of the Tigers’ rotation from 1977-1984. Ross Grimsley Jr. won 18 games with the Orioles in ’74 and achieved All-Star status as an Expo four years later when he notched 20 victories with personal-bests in ERA (3.05) and WHIP (1.156). 1970 Cincinnati Reds Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Stan Swanson LF .283 9 51 Milt Wilcox 12-10 2.84 Danny Godby CF .273 6 41 Ross Grimsley Jr. 11-8 2.73 Elvio Jimenez RF .275 11 51 Charles Higgins 11-7 3.20 Donald Anderson 1B .285 7 44 Timothy Grant 11-7 3.45 Mike Lisetski 2B .264 6 40 Clarence Cooper 8-11 2.62 Frank Duffy SS .263 7 33 Kurt Bevacqua 3B .261 15 67 BULLPEN WLS ERA William Ferguson C .280 7 51 Dooley Womack 14 2.19 Larry Gable 14 2.19 BENCH POS BA HR RBI Pat House 10 3.04 Frank Kimball 1B .246 7 31 Steve Blateric 8 2.72 Ron Theobald SS .309 0 28 David Hill 7-2 2.57 George Runk 3B .290 4 49 Gregg Slape OF .244 10 33 Tom Spencer OF ,285 3 50 Jay Ward OF .243 12 45 Bill Plummer C .260 7 42\n\nThe Dodgers ranked among the top minor league systems in the Sixties apart from the ’65 season. While Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale led the Blue Crew to a World Series title, the farm system went into a collective tailspin, placing 19th among 20 teams with a .447 OWPCT. Don Sutton mastered the art of pitching during his lone year in the minors, striking out 239 batsmen in 249 innings and fashioning a WHIP of 1.024 between Santa Barbara (A) and Albuquerque (AA). “Black and Decker” supplied 14 victories annually over a 23-year career with a 3.26 ERA, 1.142 WHIP and 65.5 WAR. Jack Billingham accrued 12.1 WAR over 13 seasons, averaging 14 wins with a 3.77 ERA in the Seventies. Bill Singer (14-15, 4.52) yielded mediocre results for Spokane (AAA). “The Singer Throwing Machine” earned a spot in the Dodgers’ rotation in 1967, won 20 games in ’69 and ’73 and retired after 14 seasons with an ERA of 3.39. Los Angeles posted losing records in ’67 and ’68 coinciding with Koufax’ retirement then rallied with ten straight winning records from 1969 to 1978. 1965 Los Angeles Dodgers Affiliates\n\nLINEUP POS BA HR RBI ROTATION W-L ERA Jim Fairey LF .323 20 79 Don Sutton 23-7 2.35 Ken Washington CF .284 21 83 Joseph Ramirez 10-7 2.57 Raynor Youngdahl RF .273 22 88 Floyd Murry 9-8 3.18 Tom Hutton 1B .294 20 63 Michael Pitko 7-11 3.00 Nate Oliver 2B .284 11 44 Charles Spell 4-10 3.61 Tommy Dean SS .268 6 55 Johnny Werhas 3B .281 20 75 BULLPEN WLS ERA Buddy Hollowell C .262 11 63 Ken Page 10-4 1.69 William Corrigan 10-9 1.93 BENCH POS BA HR RBI Jack Billingham 7-3 3.03 Mel Corbo 1B .278 14 68 Michael Mathwig 7-4 2.96 Clarence Jones 1B .281 18 79 Robert Proctor 3-7 3.25 Luis Alcaraz 2B .268 13 40 Don LeJohn 3B .395 4 38 Al Ferrara OF .307 14 33 Dick McLaughlin OF .307 2 57 Barry Erdos C .280 10 58\n\nReferences and Resources\n\nBaseball-Reference Retrosheet – Transactions Database The information used here was obtained free of charge from and is copyrighted by Retrosheet.
