Nick Pivetta made his second start for Boston, allowing a run on three hits with three strikeouts in three innings. Alex Wood worked two innings in the start for San Francisco and gave up a home run to Omar Narvaez.\n\nWith a good young rotation and a deep lineup, the Braves are looking for their first World Series title since 1995. While San Diego is much improved, World Series MVP Corey Seager and Los Angeles are well-positioned for a run at another championship. The last time the All-Stars descended on Atlanta, Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter had three hits and two RBIs in the AL's 6-3 victory at Turner Field in 2000.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)DENVER – Nolan Arenado hasn't expressed this much optimism since signing his $260 million contract with Colorado two years ago. Ad“They really care about winning,” Arenado said of the Cardinals. He wanted to move on.”The Cardinals acquired Arenado for what some considered a steal: left-hander Austin Gomber and four minor leaguers.

Blackmon began the game batting an astonishing .500 for the Rockies. Blackmon was on deck when Trevor Story, who doubled twice and singled, grounded into a game-ending double play. Rockies: Following an off day Thursday, the Rockies begin a stretch of 20 games in 20 days starting Friday night in a series opener against the Texas Rangers. Colorado RHP Ryan Castellani (0-0, 0.00 ERA) is slated to start against the Rangers RHP Lance Lynn (2-0, 1.16 ERA).\n\nARLINGTON, Texas Texas right-hander Corey Kluber left his first start in almost 15 months after just one inning Sunday due to shoulder tightness. The two-time Cy Young Award winner was making his first appearance for a team other than Cleveland after an offseason trade. The Rangers said Kluber reported feeling the tightness in the first few pitches and it got worse as the inning progressed. He was close to returning when he sustained an oblique injury during a rehab start last August. He was a 20-game winner in 2018, and the AL Cy Young Award winner in 2014 and 2017.\n\nColorado Rockies shortstop Trevor Story (27) makes the tag on Texas Rangers' Elvis Andrus (1) who was attempting to steal in the fourth inning of a baseball game Saturday, July 25, 2020, in Arlington, Texas.

Rodriguez)ARLINGTON, Texas Daniel Bard won in his first major league game in more than seven years, pitching 1 1-3 scoreless innings in relief for the Colorado Rockies in a 3-2 win over the Texas Rangers on Saturday. A first-round pick by the Boston Red Sox in 2006, Bard made his big league debut three years later. The Rangers left 12 runners on base, including multiple runners in the fifth through eighth innings.

The first round will be a best-of-three series and the pairings will be 1 vs. 8, 2-7, 3-6 and 4-5. BRAND NEW HOMEThe Texas Rangers officially open Globe Life Field, their new $1.2 billion stadium with a retractable roof. Bumgarner signed an $85 million, five-year deal with the D-backs during the offseason after spending 11 years in San Francisco. Roberts said Kershaw might be able to return as early as the team's series against the Diamondbacks that begins July 30."
