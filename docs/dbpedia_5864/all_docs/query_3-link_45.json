        "text": "Twenty years after its theatrical release, Seabiscuit remains one of the best sports dramas to grace the screen.\n\nJuly 25, 2023\n\nSeabiscuit remains the best movie ever made about the world of horse racing.\n\nMay 19, 2023\n\nDirector Ross, his team of technicians, and performers (including 10 portraying the title character) made one of the greatest sports (and family friendly) films of all-time which will quite easily double for some as the light at the end of many tunnels.\n\nJanuary 13, 2022\n\nThe film is being pulled along at every instant by the gravitational force of its inevitable heartwarming and cathartic conclusion.\n\nFebruary 16, 2021\n\nSeabiscuit is a sports film with a heart, featuring great race sequences and a wonderful story.\n\nNovember 16, 2019\n\nWhile not as epic as one might think given the studio build-up, Seabiscuit is nevertheless destined to become a classic.\n\nNovember 15, 2019\n\nA high-quality telling of the inspirational true story behind America's own Phar Lap, an equine powerhouse that became a hero of the Depression era.\n\nOctober 14, 2019\n\nSeabiscuit starts slow, finishes fast, not an eye without a tear, not a throat without a lump. It jumps out of the gate as a front-runner in the race for Hollywood's Triple Crown: best actor, best direction and best picture.\n\nJanuary 5, 2018"
