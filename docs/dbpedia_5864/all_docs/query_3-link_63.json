        "text": "This set of hand-stitched nylon silks representing the distinctive red and white colors of the famed C. S. Howard Racing Stable was an original prop from the 2003 Universal Pictures film Seabiscuit. The legendary champion race horse was a beloved sports figure during the Depression era of the late 1930s. Seabiscuit's immense popularity was rekindled with the release of best-selling book by Laura Hillenbrand upon which the Academy Award nominated film for Best Picture was based. The silks were depicted in the film as being worn by Seabiscuit's loyal jockey Red Pollard, as portrayed by actor Tobey Maguire, who had risen to fame the year prior for his role as the Marvel comics superhero Spiderman. For Seabiscuit, the actor had to adhere to diet regimen to match the lighter weight requirements, yet retain the athleticism and strength needed to channel the champion jockey. Maguire is shown wearing the Howard silks in numerous scenes throughout the film. The significance of the silks as an often-seen key visual in the film is evident by it being individually catalogued and registered by the noted Hollywood Memorabilia company Premiere Props in association with Universal Pictures. A certificate of authenticity denoting the same signed by representatives of both parties accompanies the silks."
