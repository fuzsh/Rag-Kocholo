        "text": "This is the prime award, where a group of people (or, in the case of the Nighthawk Awards, me) decide what the best film of the year is. It was complicated right from the start, of course, because the Academy Awards, the first awards group, had two different awards: Outstanding Picture and Quality Production. The first, according to the rule book was “the most outstanding motion picture, considering all elements that contribute to a picture’s greatness” while the second was “the most artistic, unique, and/or original motion picture without reference to cost or magnitude.” The italics are my emphasis because it’s that first award that went to Wings, often considered the first Best Picture winner which shows that right from the start, the Academy was focused on large productions. That’s the reason that films like The Great Ziegfeld, The Greatest Show on Earth, Around the World in 80 Days, Out of Africa, Braveheart and Titanic have Oscars. Well, that and questionable taste from the Academy.\n\nThe first critics group (sort of) was the National Board of Review and they began in 1933, followed two years later by the New York Film Critics. They agreed in that same year but the award went to The Informer which won everything but Picture at the Oscars. The Golden Globes arrived in 1943 (before the first three groups had ever agreed) but didn’t start splitting their award up until 1951. They did complicate the idea of a “Consensus Award” by having Foreign films (including British) not eligible for Picture. After complete lack of consensus in 1943 (four different films won the four awards), 1944 gave us the first film with three awards (Going My Way). In 1946 The Best Years of Our Lives would be the first to win four awards but that still wasn’t a sweep because one of those was the new BAFTA award which would complicate things by often being on a different calendar (the award was actually in 1947). Consensus got trickier in the 50s with A Streetcar Named Desire winning because it had the most points and noms (4) but only one win while two other films had two each. Also, many years had no limit on Globe or BAFTA nominees so the Consensus list was very long. On the Waterfront would set a new points record (410) and noms records (5) and would be the first film to win both critics awards and the Oscar but it would lose the BAFTA (to a film from a different year). Bridge on the River Kwai would become the first film to sweep all 5 awards. A Man for All Seasons would win 5 awards but in the year the National Society of Film Critics added a sixth award (which often went to a Foreign film). In 1974, Day for Night would become the first film to win the Consensus without an Oscar nomination thanks to two critics wins and the BAFTA win. The LA Film Critics would another award in 1975 and the Boston Society of Film Critics another in 1980. All the President’s Men would be the first film with 6 noms while GoodFellas would set new records across the board for points (650), noms (8) and wins (6) as the Chicago Film Critics and PGA added two more awards, all of which would be thumped by Schindler’s List, the only film to ever sweep all existing awards with 10 and a points record (910) that has not been matched and the highest Consensus percentage post-1946 (49.19%) by a considerable margin. Two years later the Critics Choice finally added the 11th and final award (six critics, five awards groups) with L.A. Confidential the first to 11 nominations with only Hurt Locker (10) also managing double-digits since.\n\nFor a full list of my own 9 point films (anything high ****) see the full Top 2000 list.\n\nnote: Critical Acclaim. That’s a phrase I will use below several times. So that I don’t have to keep repeating what it means, it’s based on the Consensus Awards that I do. My feelings don’t play into those awards except by the percentages I assign. 100 points for a win, 50 for a nomination. 100% for the Oscars, SAG, BAFTA, NYFC, LAFC, 90% for the BSFC, CFC, NSFC, 80% for the BFCA, NBR, 70% for the Globes. Then, I calculate percentage of the total points. That’s because in 1943 (the first year of the Globes) there were 990 total points and in 2011 there were 2795 total points, so the percentage of the total points is the best way to account for historical changes in scores. So, the film with the highest percentage of the year’s total points has the most critical acclaim under the definition I am using.\n\nThe Academy Awards\n\nFirst, I’m doing this all as one post – no summarizing the post-2011 down below. This is complete through 2021. Second, there are a lot of tables here rather than text.\n\nSummary:\n\nI have covered each year in this category through 2020. Just go to the search bar of the blog and enter a year and look at it to get an idea for the years themselves.\n\nAs for trends, well the Academy with its focus on large-scale productions and major studios missed the boat for quite a long time. In the first six years, the Academy picked the two worst winners ever and a third among the 6 worst and had two years (1929, 1931) that couldn’t even average a good film among the nominees. Through 1934, they had only nominated 4 of the Top 200 nominees. Things started to improve in the latter half of the 1930s with 1935 being the first year to average a deserving Best Picture nominee (76 or higher) and 1939 the first year to average over an 80 as well as the first year with five great nominees (but not all 10 – don’t believe the hype). Still, none of those years even hits the Top 60 among Oscar years and the first 12 years (through 1938) are all among the 20 weakest Best Picture slates. In 1944, the Academy dropped to 5 nominees (it was variables through 1933, 12 each in 1934 and 1935 and 10 each through 1943) but didn’t necessarily start getting better. Though 1946 had two Top 100 nominees and 1947 set a new mark for highest average nominee (86.4), neither of them could still crack the Top 30 for years. The 1950s were actually a considerable step back. Though it had two of the best winners it also had two of the worst and the average winner was just an 80.6 after an 88.4 in the 1940s. The nominees had dropped from 81.25 to 77.04. No year even cracked the Top 50 and 1956 was one of the worst years ever. The 1960s were an improvement but still mixed with 1961 the best to date and 1963 the worst since 1931. The winners averaged a 90.4 but only had three Top 100 films. The 1970s finally saw Best Picture become what it should be. The nominees averaged 84.68 and the winners averaged 93.4 with 1972 becoming the first in which the average nominee was a great film and 1973 becoming the first Top 10 year. From 1972 to 1979 only two years were outside the Top 25. The 1980s both got better with 1980 and 1982 the first with nominees averaging 90 and two top 10 finishes for years but also worse as the first decade where the worst nominee was chosen three times (1985, 1985, 1989) and an average winner was the exact same as an average nominee (86.1). The 1990s were a bit odd with one terrible year (1995) and three great years (1991, 1993, 1994). But starting in 1991 and running through 2003, the Academy either picked the best of the nominees (91-93, 96, 98, 99, 03) or the worst (the rest). 2002 exhibited that oddness with the best slate of nominees by far (96 average) and awarding the weakest of them. The oddness continued with the weakest film chosen in 2005 and then the best for the last three years of the 5 BP Era. Then in 2009 came a change to 10 films, then in 2011 back to a variable which lasted through 2020 with a switch back to 10 in 2021. The interesting bit is that in spite of not nominating The Dark Knight or Wall-E in 2008 and prompting the switch, the Academy had been doing great; from 2001 to 2007, the Academy had five of the six best years in history. Since the final switch, the nominees have mostly been solid but undistinguished. The years have ranged as high as 12th (2017) and as low as 53rd (2011). It has included mostly great films (four years averaged above 90) but also some bad ones (seven nominees outside the Top 500). What’s more, they have yet to pick the best nominee in any year since the change. They picked the 2nd best several times (2009-12, 14, 15) but lately have been much worse (7th, 5th, 7th, 7th in the last four).\n\nSequels:\n\nThe Bells of St Mary’s was the first to earn a nomination and The Godfather Part II was the first winner with Return of the King following years later as the second winner. Other nominated films are The Godfather Part III, The Two Towers, Toy Story 3 (the first one nominated when the original wasn’t), Mad Max: Fury Road and Black Panther (sort of).\n\nGenres:\n\nNo Kids, Horror or Sci-Fi film has ever won. The single winners are Action (The French Connection), Adventure (Mutiny on the Bounty) and Suspense (Silence of the Lambs). The Crime films are grouped (1972 and 1974, 2006 and 2007). Fantasy never won before 2003 but has now won three times. Comedy has gone long gaps between wins (1938-1956, 1977-1989, 1998-2011). Musical won five times between 1958 and 1968 and only twice since then. War is split – two World War I films, two World War II films, two Vietnam films, one Iraq film. Western went almost 60 years between wins and then won again two years later. Drama’s nadir was the 70s – just three wins. It’s peak was the 40s – it won every year from 1941 to 1950 and 16 times from 1937-1955. Its largest gap is 6 years (1969-1975) but followed that with 10 wins in 14 years.\n\nGenre Wins % Drama 50 52.63% Comedy 13 13.68% Musical 10 10.53% War 7 7.37% Crime 4 4.21% Western 3 3.16% Fantasy 3 3.16% Mystery 2 2.11% Action 1 1.05% Adventure 1 1.05% Suspense 1 1.05%\n\nOf the nominees, every genre is covered. Action took until 1971 for a nomination but won with its first. It also went 26 years between noms from 1974 to 2000. After not earning a nom until 1971, Horror earned four in six years then didn’t earn another until 1999. I don’t count Silence (like many do) but count many films that others don’t (Clockwork Orange, Black Swan, Get Out). Sci-Fi took until 1977, earned another in 1982 and then jumped to 2009 but since then has seven more; they do very well with also earning Tech noms with all but one earning Sound and all but one earning Visual Effects and surprisingly well in Screenplay (only Gravity didn’t earn a nom). Kids has been grouped (one in 1939, two in the mid 40s, two in the mid 60s, two in the early 90s, two in the late 00s). Mystery has now gone 18 years since its last nomination. Fantasy earned its first nom in 1935 but didn’t get its second until 1981 and its third until 1990; only half the Fantasy films nominated for Best Picture earned a Visual Effects nom but they all won the award. Adventure earned 8 noms from 1931 to 1938 but only 6 since and only two since 1972 (Master and Commander, Revenant); it has done poorly in Director (5 noms) but very well in Editing (11 noms, 3 wins) to go with Picture. The heyday for Suspense was the 40s (seven noms from 1940-47 including three for Hitchcock films) with only seven since and none since 1993. Westerns had a huge gap from 1969-1990 without a nom and a smaller one from 1992-2010. Crime once went 30 years without a nom (1937-1967) and its best period was not the 30s (just two noms) but 1985-1996 (six noms); of the post-1937 nominees only Hell or High Water didn’t earn a Director nom, all earned writing noms and all but Atlantic City earned Supporting Actor noms (several earning multiple). In fact, the 17 Crime films nominated for Best Picture from 1967-2019 earned a combined 23 Supporting Actor noms with 4 wins. War films have had several eight year gaps between noms (1962-70, 1970-78, 1998-2006) but never more than that. Most War films earn Director, Editing and Cinematography noms as well (15 added all three of those). Musicals don’t do well in major categories; while Musicals average 6.54 noms (versus 6.45 for all Picture nominees), over half their noms don’t earn a Director nom, over half don’t earn a Writing nom and a whopping 10 (21.2%) earn no major noms outside of Picture (compared to less than 10% of all Picture nominees). Musicals have had at least one nominee in every decade but what most people think of as a Musical (people burst into song) went nearly 30 years between Cabaret and Moulin Rouge. Musicals account for just 8% of all Picture nominees but account for 19% of Picture nominees nominated for Editing, Cinematography, Score, Art Direction, Sound and Costume Design. It took until 1931 for a Comedy to be nominated and Comedies, even with more than 5 nominees in lots of years now, still average less than one nomination per year and from 1944-1949 the only nominee was The Bishop’s Wife. In 1973, three Comedies were nominated and The Sting won and in 1977 two were nominated and Annie Hall won but none were nominated in the three years between. The biggest gap is five years 1989-1994). Even with the expanded era, there were no Comedy nominees in 2016 or 2020 though Comedies have benefited from this era with 21 nominees in 14 years after just 21 in the previous 28 years. In contrast to Musicals, only three Comedies have failed to earn another major nom and none since 1936 though only two Comedies earned those six Tech noms (The Sting, Shakespeare in Love). Comedies are especially weak in Visual Effects (one nom), Sound Editing (two), Song (four) and Foreign (two). Drama films average 3.25 nominees a year and even averaged 2.67 nominees a year in the 5 BP Era (1944-2008). In the original expanded era, (1932-1943), Dramas had a whopping 67 noms including 7 just in 1939 and set a new record in 2020 with 8 (out of 9!). Dramas have never had a year without a nominee have never had a decade with fewer than 25 noms and have had several years where it had 4 of the 5 nominees. While many Dramas have had no other major noms only two have done so since 1956 (Selma, Ford v Ferrari). Though 8 Dramas have earned no other noms except Picture, Dramas as a whole average 6.48 noms for their Picture nominees while Dramas that win the Oscar average 8.78 nominations and average 5 wins.\n\nGenre Noms % Wins % Drama 308 52.74% 50 16.23% Comedy 81 13.87% 13 16.05% Musical 47 8.05% 10 21.28% War 32 5.48% 7 21.88% Crime 21 3.60% 4 19.05% Western 16 2.74% 3 18.75% Adventure 14 2.40% 1 7.14% Suspense 14 2.40% 1 7.14% Fantasy 10 1.71% 3 30.00% Mystery 10 1.71% 2 20.00% Kids 9 1.54% 0 0.00% Sci-Fi 9 1.54% 0 0.00% Horror 8 1.37% 0 0.00% Action 5 0.86% 1 20.00%\n\nForeign Films:\n\nThere have been 12 nominees over the years. The first was Grand Illusion in 1938 but the next wasn’t until Z in 1969, the first to also earn a Foreign Film nomination (and win). Of the 12 films, only six also earned Foreign Film noms (they all won). Parasite became the first to win the Oscar. Two films were American made films in other languages (Letters from Iwo Jima, Minari). Of interest, while Grand Illusion received no other noms, the other 11 were all nominated for Director and Screenplay.\n\nSingle Nominations:\n\nThis was common early on; from 1928-1936 15 films received a Picture nom with no other noms with Grand Hotel even winning. After that, it was just three more (Grand Illusion, One Foot in Heaven, The Ox-Bow Incident). Just two nominations was also common early on (12 films from 1928-36 including one winner), became rare (one in 1943, one in 1951) then non-existent (none again until 1994) and then sprang back into being more common with the new expanded BP era (five since 2009).\n\nOther Categories:\n\nThere will be four charts. This first one is Best Picture winners (of which there are 95) with how often they win in other categories. There are no current streaks as Picture was literally the only award that Nomadland and CODA shared. The last active streak of more than two years was Director from 2006-11.\n\nCat Wins % D 67 70.53% AS 43 45.26% Ed 34 35.79% AD 28 29.47% A 27 28.42% Ci 27 28.42% Scr 26 27.37% Sd 23 24.21% Sc 20 21.05% CD 20 21.05% SA 18 18.95% AS 13 13.68% SAS 13 13.68% VE 6 6.32% Sg 5 5.26% Mk 4 4.21% SE 3 3.16% Fo 1 1.05% An 0 0.00%\n\nThis is the number of Oscar wins in other categories for Best Picture nominees. The second number is the total number of Oscar wins ever in that category with the second percentage being what percent of all Oscar wins in that category was won by a Best Picture nominee. The last Director winner not to be Picture nominated was Divine Lady in 1929. The only Adapted Screenplay winners are The Bad and the Beautiful, Sling Blade and Gods and Monsters. The last Actor winner was Crazy Heart in 2009. As can be seen in comparing the next chart, every film nominated for Picture and Animated Film or Picture and Foreign Film has won the latter.\n\nCat Wins % TW % D 93 15.92% 95 97.89% AS 91 15.58% 94 96.81% Ed 74 12.67% 88 84.09% A 75 12.84% 96 78.13% Ci 88 15.07% 121 72.73% Sd 64 10.96% 90 71.11% AD 85 14.55% 120 70.83% Scr 68 11.64% 107 63.55% AS 60 10.27% 96 62.50% Sc 84 14.38% 136 61.76% SAS 53 9.08% 86 61.63% SA 50 8.56% 86 58.14% CD 48 8.22% 91 52.75% SE 21 3.60% 49 42.86% VE 26 4.45% 84 30.95% Mk 13 2.23% 42 30.95% Sg 23 3.94% 88 26.14% An 2 0.34% 21 9.52% Fo 7 1.20% 74 9.46%\n\nThis chart is the number of Best Picture nominees nominated in each category.

Years Ranked\n\nThis is very different than how I rank all the other categories. Rather than rank it against the other potential nominees, I rank the years against themselves (the actual winner is irrelevant to the rank). I create two numbers: the average nominee and the average rank (ranks derived from the above list). I then divide one by the other to help even out the two lists. That system weights the rank more than the average because of how it works out. And surprisingly there can be some big differences. For instance, 1982 ranks at #9 for average (90.2) and but only #26 for rank (241.80). That’s because there are a lot of films rated 94 or above so the best 1982 films, while high in points aren’t that high in rank (it has no film above #177). Overall, it ends up at #25. But for 1992, which is much lower in average at #47 (84.0), it scores at #24 in rank (229.6) because the one bad film doesn’t bring down the rank as much as it does the average. So it ends up at #27 overall. As a result of these differences, you can also have a year like 1980 which ranks at #12 for average and #10 for rank but #9 overall.\n\nI’m not going to list the nominees for every year because that’s a lot of typing but I will have comments. But you can find them all in the individual years (except 2021). So, here are the Best Picture slates for each year and how they rank relative to each other.\n\n2002\n\nthe best year by far, even awarding the weakest of the nominees – the first year with 5 **** films and even the weakest is a Top 200\n\n2007\n\nthe second year to have four **** nominees\n\n2003\n\nthree Top 100 films brought down by one mid *** nominee\n\n1994\n\nvery very similar to 2001 – a high *** winner with four mid to high **** nominees\n\n2001\n\n2005\n\njust a little different with a slightly weaker winner but three Top 50 films (the only year to do so)\n\n1973\n\nif the five nominees had matched Director (Last Tango instead of A Touch of Class) this year would have ranked 2nd all-time (and closer to #1 than #2)\n\n1991\n\nlike wise, if Thelma & Louise was nominated instead of Prince of Tides, this year would be #3\n\n1980\n\n1984\n\nthree Top 100 choices and then a low ***.5 and a mid ***\n\n1993\n\nwould have been #3 all-time if they had rightly chosen The Age of Innocence instead of The Fugitive\n\n2017\n\neight great films and a mid *** – pretty much as good as you will get from a year with more than 5 nominees\n\n1976\n\n1996\n\n2019\n\neight great films and then Joker\n\n2010\n\npretty much as good as you can get from 10 nominees – eight great films, two very good films – for all years with 10 nominees the best 9th and 10th nominees (127 Hours, The Fighter) – but kept down by only having one Top 100 film\n\n2012\n\n1974\n\nif they had nominated Day for Night (Director nominee) instead of Towering Inferno, this would rank a very close 2nd and would have been the best year by far for a long time\n\n1986\n\n1979\n\n2013\n\n1975\n\nrare year where the film without a Director nomination is actually the best nominee\n\n1972\n\nhad they nominated Sleuth instead of Sounder it would be #7\n\n2004\n\n1982\n\nas mentioned above, the first year to average a 90 among the nominees but has no film in the Top 175 – the only year in the Top 32 without a Top 100 nominee\n\n2014\n\n1992\n\nThe Player instead of Scent of a Woman would jump it to #3 but that’s the rare substitution where the bad film was nominated for Director\n\n1989\n\nthe winner, at a 67, is -22.40 compared to the average nominee, the third worst of all-time\n\n1990\n\n2018\n\nit wasn’t a great year but picking Green Book as the winner is still damn dumb\n\n1997\n\n2009\n\nThe Blind Side obviously didn’t belong but there wasn’t an obvious replacement (based on awards and other Oscar noms); Star Trek earned PGA and WGA noms and that would have moved this year up to #24\n\n1961\n\n1946\n\nthree films in the Top 120 is still this low when your other nominees are The Yearling and The Razor’s Edge; just bumping the latter for Director nominee Brief Encounter moves it to 3rd; if you also bump Yearling for Screenplay nominee Children of Paradise, it’s #1 by a long, long way\n\n1983\n\n2006\n\n1981\n\n1971\n\njust about as low as possible to go when you have three Top 100 nominees in a 5 BP year; leaving Fiddler on the Roof and just bumping Nicholas and Alexandra for the 5th Director nominee (Sunday Bloody Sunday) moves this year to 4th\n\n2016\n\n2020\n\n2015\n\nmight seem the same but they’re not – 2020 doesn’t have a mediocrity like Hacksaw Ridge or Mad Max: Fury Road but it doesn’t have anything in the Top 190 either; 2016 has a Top 40 film but three films below ***.5\n\n1962\n\nthe rare year where Director doesn’t help at all – David and Lisa is just as bad as Mutiny on the Bounty and while Divorce Italian Style is 11 points better than Longest Day, Miracle Worker is 11 points weaker than The Music Man though a straight Mutiny – Miracle swap moves it into the Top 10 and also adding in a Longest – Divorce swap brings it to #4\n\n1948\n\n1947\n\n1977\n\nif I include Close Encounters, which absolutely belonged in the race and was nominated for Director instead of Goodbye Girl (the film without Director) it goes up to #22, but if I instead use it to replace Turning Point (the weakest nominee) it goes up to #10\n\n1998\n\nthis is what happens when every film is at least worthy of consideration (***.5 or above) but no film manages the Top 125 and only two of the five nominees are **** – it’s worth noting that even if the five best Oscar nominated films from this year were the nominees (Out of Sight, Shakespeare, Private Ryan, Gods and Monsters, Truman Show) it still only reaches #5\n\n1988\n\none of those strange years where there is a much weaker nominee (Working Girl) but it’s actually a Director nominee as well – but if you replace it with Director nominee A Fish Called Wanda, it jumps up to #20\n\n1966\n\nreplace non-Director nominee Sand Pebbles with Director nominee The Professionals and it leaps up to #20\n\n1964\n\n1999\n\nsimilar to 1966, replacing Green Mile with Being John Malkovich and ending up at #20\n\n2021\n\nit’s not all about Don’t Look Up but just replacing it with Macbeth moves this year up 25 spots\n\n1985\n\nironically, the winner is the problem here so there’s no easy fix – at 22.2 points below the average nominee, the fourth worst winner in relation to the nominees in history\n\n2011\n\nExtremely Dumb and Incredibly Annoying brings the year down – if you just drop it and only have 8 nominees (allowable in that year), the year goes up to #29 but if you substitute Screenplay-Actor-BAFTA Pic nominee Tinker Tailor instead it goes up to #25\n\n1978\n\nrather than nominate Interiors, which earned Director, Screenplay and Actress noms and whose director Woody Allen, had a film that won all those awards the year before, they went with An Unmarried Woman – the substitution moves it up 25 spots\n\n1969\n\ntwo top 100 nominees are balanced out by two bottom 100 nominees\n\n2000\n\n2008\n\n1957\n\n1943\n\n1940\n\n1939\n\nyes, it goes down here – no bad films but only five great ones and no very good ones – the most over-rated year in history\n\n1941\n\n1967\n\nGuess Who’s Coming to Dinner still keeps it from the top but dropping Dolittle for In Cold Blood moves this to just outside the Top 10\n\n1951\n\n1987\n\nyes, why nominate Empire of the Sun when you can nominate Fatal Attraction? the switch cost this year 40 spots\n\n1950\n\ntwo Top 50 films and three films that can’t even make the Top 450\n\n1960\n\n1949\n\n1959\n\n1995\n\nat 26.2 worse then the average nominee, that, in one sense, makes Braveheart the worst choice for an Oscar winner ever\n\n1945\n\n1944\n\n1953\n\n1954\n\nonly On the Waterfront is truly great (at 21.2 better than the average nominee, the fouth most deserving winner by that criteria) but just replacing Three Coins in the Fountain with Director nominee Rear Window does raise this year over 40 spots\n\n1938\n\n1958\n\n1935\n\nof the 11 best films nominated for any Oscar, 9 were nominated for Picture; unfortunately there were 12 nominees – just dropping the worst two moves it up a dozen spots\n\n1965\n\n1942\n\n1952\n\nThe Greatest Show on Earth is the second worst winner based on comparison to the nominees (24.6 below the average nominee) so the year can’t be good but just replacing Ivanhoe with Bad and the Beautiful (for decades the only Adapted Screenplay winner without a Picture nom) and the year goes up 30 spots\n\n1955\n\nof the 7 best nominated films at the Oscars, only one (Mr. Roberts) earned a Picture nom – but it didn’t earn a Director nom – but substituting East of Eden (Director nom) for Love is a Many-Splendored Thing does make this year jump 25 spots\n\n1970\n\nmanages to finish outside the bottom 10 in spite of two of the worst nominees ever (Airport, Love Story) – not helped by Director because the second best nominee (Five Easy Pieces) wasn’t nominated while the worst (Love Story) was plus Fellini Satyricon, the fifth Director nominee, was even worse than Love Story – still, just substituting Director nominee Women in Love for Airport moves this year up over 20 spots\n\n1927-28\n\ncomplicated by having two categories but thanks to Sunrise is the best of the early combined years\n\n1968\n\ngoing with the Director nominees instead of the Picture nominees puts this year in the Top 40 even with Oliver and Romeo and Juliet\n\n1937\n\nno easy fixes when you have four nominees below ***\n\n1936\n\n1929-30\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front is the most deserving winner ever by the criteria of being 30.0 points better than the average nominee\n\n1932-33\n\nan interesting year in that every film nominated for an Oscar that was ***.5 or better was nominated for Picture but that’s still only five of the ten nominees\n\n1931-32\n\nno great films (one of just four), one mediocre, one bad\n\n1934\n\n12 nominations in a year where only three great films earned any noms (and all were nominated for Picture) – even lopping off the bottom two nominees only moves it up a few spots\n\n1956\n\nthe only year after 1932 with no great films and it only even has one very good film (King and I) and that just barely makes that\n\n1963\n\nTom Jones was the easy correct winner (29.4 better than the average nominee) – dropping non-Director nominees Cleopatra and How the West Was Won for Director-Screenplay nominees Hud (one of the most surprising snubs ever) and 8½ raises this year almost 30 spots\n\n1930-31\n\na big, big drop from #92 to #93 as this has the second worst winner and only film that even reaches *** – but at least putting in the Screenplay nommed Gangster films (Public Enemy, Little Caesar) instead of Trader Horn and East Lynne would have moved it a lot of points even if only a few spots\n\n1929-30\n\nthe worst winner, no nominee that even qualifies as good and only one Oscar nominee in any category above *** (Street Angel low ***.5), there’s no saving this year\n\nThe BAFTAs\n\nSummary:\n\nThe BAFTAs have a strange history. They began in 1947 with just two awards with Best Years of Our Lives winning Picture and Odd Man Out winning British Film. Already that was separating things out since Best Years had won the Oscar in 1946. The next year, Picture expanded to seven nominees with Hamlet winning but losing British Film. An Oscar break came in 1949 with the BAFTA going to Bicycle Thieves. In 1950, they agreed with the Academy again with All About Eve. In 1951, came another Foreign winner and literally every film nominated for a BAFTA (17 in all) was nominated for Picture with An American in Paris becoming the first film to win the Oscar but lose the BAFTA (as opposed to not being nominated). For the next number of years there seemed to be unlimited nominees with the British Film winner always among them but only occasionally winning Picture. In 1958, Room at the Top became the first film to win the BAFTA in the year before being an Oscar nominee. Nominees dropped to four in 1964 with occasional British Film discrepencies (in 1965, for instance, when Darling won British Film without a Picture nom over two films nominated for Picture). Three Oscar winners in a row won the BAFTA for the first time (and last until the late 90s): Lawrence of Arabia, Tom Jones and My Fair Lady, all with British subjects but that wasn’t three BAFTAs in a row since Dr. Strangelove won in 1964 with Lady pushed to 1965. Director became a category in 1968 and The Graduate (a year after its Oscar win for Director) became the first film to win both, setting the trend. Because of differences in release dates, no film Oscar eligible in 1970, 1973, 1976 or 1978 won the BAFTA with three films eligible in 1974 winning the BAFTA in 1973, 1974 and 1975. In 1983, Educating Rita became the first film to win the BAFTA without a Director nom. In 1985, Purple Rose of Cairo won with just 4 total noms (and one other won) over Amadeus and Passage to India which had 9 noms each. In 1987, Jean de Florette won while losing Foreign Film to The Sacrifice which had no other noms. In 1989, Dead Poets Society was the only nominee with a Director nom and it won Picture while in 1992, Howards End won with just one other win. Four Weddings and a Funeral won while not even getting nominated for the newly revived British Film while The Full Monty won while losing British Film to the non-nominated Nil by Mouth. The King’s Speech finally set things right by winning Picture and British Film, the first to do since the 60s. It was also part of a record six year stretch where the BAFTAs agreed with the Oscars (08-13) but since then it has only agreed once (Nomadland) and in 2021, CODA wasn’t even nominated.\n\nGenres:\n\nDrama accounts for 63% of the 76 winners including the first 10 in a row. Comedy adds another 17%. No other genre has more than 5 wins. Drama also covers 51% of the nominees with Comedy adding another 15%. Nothing else even breaks 5%.\n\nSingle Nominees:\n\nIn the early years, Picture (and British Film) was the only category so many films won the award without another nomination (7 of the first 13 winners). Through 1964 there were 81 films that earned a Picture nomination and nothing else but it hasn’t happened since. In the same stretch there was another 21 films whose only other nomination was British Film. Since 1965, only three films have earned Picture with only one other nom: A Man and a Woman, Bonnie and Clyde, When Harry Met Sally.\n\nForeign Films:\n\nIn the early years when the BAFTA had split categories for British films (through 1964), there were a lot of Foreign Films that earned Best Picture noms (66 to be precise) with even several winners (Bicycle Thieves, La Ronde, Forbidden Games, Wages of Fear, Gervaise, Ballad of a Soldier). They fell off after that with just 9 more nominees and two winners (Lacombe Lucien and Day for Night back to back) before Foreign Film was introduced as a category in the early 80s. Since that was introduced, every Foreign nominee has been a Foreign Film nominee but not necessarily the winner with Jean de Florette winning Picture and losing Foreign Film. Roma is the only other Foreign winner since then. There have been seven nominees, two of which lost Foreign Film (one to another Picture nominee).\n\nOther Categories:\n\nSince over half the nominees come from the early years before Director was a category, the crossover with Director is much less than with other groups. Since Director began only Educating Rita and Purple Rose of Cairo have won the BAFTA without a Director nom. In the same period, only Day for Night, Last Emperor, Revenant and 1917 have won without a Screenplay nom. In the early years, films (except Hamlet) won Picture and British Film every time they were classified as the latter but since British Film was re-introduced four films won Picture and lost British Film before King’s Speech finally won both and the other two eligible films since also won both.\n\n5 Weakest BAFTA Winners:\n\nGladiator\n\nThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\n\nJulia\n\nChariots of Fire\n\nGervaise\n\n10 Worst BAFTA Nominees:\n\nDon’t Look Up\n\nDavid and Lisa\n\nThe Adventures of Robinson Crusoe\n\nNever on Sunday\n\nRomeo and Juliet (1954)\n\nJoker\n\nThe Sun Shines Bright\n\nTaking Off\n\nBugsy Malone\n\nZorba the Greek\n\n10 Most Acclaimed Films to Not Earn a BAFTA Nomination (based on Consensus Awards percentage):\n\nTerms of Endearment\n\nSideways\n\nOrdinary People\n\nAll the King’s Men\n\nCries and Whispers\n\nNashville\n\nAround the World in 80 Days\n\nRaging Bull\n\nSunset Blvd.\n\nThe Lion in Winter\n\n10 Most Acclaimed Films to not Win the BAFTA (based on Consensus Awards percentage):\n\nL.A.

So go here and you’ll find both of their categories.\n\nThe Critics Choice Awards\n\nSummary:\n\nThe original year (1995) just had a winner (Sense and Sensibility) but after that, they immediately jumped to 10 nominees a year. They pretty much go with the Consensus. Since they began only one film has won the award without at least two other Best Picture wins (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) while only two films with more than two wins have failed to earn a CC nom, both of them foreign (Amour, Drive My Car). No film has lost the CC that has more than 5 Picture wins and the only one with 5 not to win are Drive My Car, Parasite and Moonlight.\n\nThree Worst CC Winners:\n\nGladiator\n\nA Beautiful Mind\n\nNomadland\n\nThree Best CC Nominees That Didn’t Win:\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nLone Star\n\nThree Worst Nominees:\n\nDon’t Look Up\n\nExtremely Loud and Incredibly Close\n\nJoker\n\nThree Least Acclaimed Winners (based on Consensus Awards Percentage):\n\nOnce Upon a Time… in Hollywood\n\nThe Shape of Water\n\nA Beautiful Mind\n\nThe Producers Guild of America\n\nSummary:\n\nThe PGA took until 1989 to start handing out awards, long after most of the other guilds. They began kind of oddly by having eight nominees. But they also established a strong connection to the Oscars. In that first year, all five Oscar nominees were among the PGA nominees. Only Braveheart has won the Oscar since without a PGA nom, most films win both and there is strong overlap between the nominees (72% through the end of the 5 BP Era, 87% since) with complete overlap from 1992-94. That’s because the PGA only had 5 nominees in those years. In the early years, they couldn’t seem to settle on a set number of nominations (8, 3, 6, 5 (3 years, all Oscar nominees), 6, 5 (6 years), 6, 6, 5, 5). Then, in 2005, they added an Animated category and for two years had five nominees in each and then two years of 5 in Picture and 3 in Animated. In 2009, they moved to 10 for Picture and 5 for Animated with Up getting nominated in both. Because they are producers, this is also essentially a “production” award so sometimes big films get nominations without nominations elsewhere. There has also been one tie (2013 – 12 Years a Slave and Gravity). The PGA, in 1991, did one of the strangest things when they passed over Bugsy (DGA, WGA nom, Oscar, Globe noms) for At Play in the Fields of the Lord (only nom). They have also passed over GoodFellas, Traffic and The Pianist (for My Big Fat Greek Wedding).\n\nThree Worst PGA Winners:\n\nDriving Miss Daisy\n\nGladiator\n\nGreen Book\n\nThree Best PGA Nominees That Didn’t Win:\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nPulp Fiction\n\nFive Worst Nominees:\n\nDon’t Look Up\n\nScent of a Woman\n\nJoker\n\nAt Play in the Fields of the Lord\n\nHacksaw Ridge\n\nFive Least Acclaimed Winners (based on Consensus Awards Percentage):\n\nThe Big Short\n\nCODA\n\nBirdman\n\nLittle Miss Sunshine\n\n1917\n\nFive Most Acclaimed Films That Didn’t Win (based on Consensus Awards Percentage):\n\nL.A.

Their next award went to Topaze but in 1934, they agreed with the Oscars for the first time with It Happened One Night.\n\n1935-1943:\n\nThe New York Film Critics began in 1935 and it immediately began an odd stretch for the two groups. They would agree six times in the first nine years and not one of those six films (The Informer, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, The Citadel, Grapes of Wrath, Citizen Kane, In Which We Serve) would win the Oscar (though all were nominated). The only Oscar winner in that stretch to win a critics award was The Life of Emile Zola in 1937 which won the NYFC. The Consensus would also be confusing since In Which We Serve won both critics awards in 1942 but earned an Oscar nom (and thus appears in the Consensus Awards) in 1943. Two films in this stretch won the NBR without an Oscar nom (Night Must Fall, Confessions of a Nazi Spy).\n\n1944-1953:\n\nThis decade makes for an interesting time as the New York Film Critics began to align very heavily with the Oscars (7 films won both including four in a row from 1944-47) while the NBR failed to align with them at all (no winners, five films failing to be nominated). It also saw the first critics awards for a Documentary (True Glory) and for a Foreign Film (Paisan, Bicycle Thieves). No film during this era won both critics awards.\n\n1954-1957:\n\nThis was some true synchronicity. All four years the same film won both awards and the Oscar on top of that with three of them adding the Globe and one even adding the BAFTA (Bridge on the River Kwai). 1954 had marked the first time since 1934 that an NBR winner won the Oscar. The four straight winner is tied for the longest streak by the NBR (although the later streak had two years with multiple winners). The four year streak ties the NYFC record which would be tied again later. The four year stretch is the longest streak of the two groups agreeing.\n\n1958-1965:\n\nThe last stretch with just two critics groups. The NYFC stayed with strong Oscar crossover (5 winners, 3 nominees) and the NBR went back to weak crossover (one winner, three snubs). Sons and Lovers and Tom Jones were the only films to win both groups.\n\n1966-1974:\n\nThe National Society of Film Critics began in 1966 with Persona (a British film from an Italian director) and then followed that up with three straight Foreign Films. In their first nine years, M*A*S*H was the only American film to win (and one of just two Oscar nominees). The NYFC started with two Oscar winners, then five straight nominees (including two rare Foreign Oscar nominees) before going with Day for Night (the first NYFC winner not to earn an Oscar nom) and then Amarcord (marking the only time in the 20th Century back-to-back NYFC winners failed to earn Oscar noms). In this stretch, the NBR picked more Oscar winners (3) than Oscar nominees (2). The NBR and NYFC agreed once (A Man for all Seasons) and the NYFC and NSFC agreed twice (Z, Day for Night). The NBR and NSFC never agreed.\n\n1975-1979:\n\nThe LA Film Critics began in 1975 and did so by awarding two films (one of which won the Oscar), neither of which was Nashville, the first film to win the NBR, NYFC and NSFC. They followed it up the next year by doing literally the exact same thing (All the President’s Men was the trifecta winner and the first American film not directed by Robert Altman to win the NSFC). Annie Hall became the first NSFC winner to win the Oscar (and it won the NYFC). The LAFC made it three out of five at the Oscars to start off by picking Kramer vs. Kramer, the first film in which it agreed with another group (NYFC). Thanks to multiple winners from the NBR and the LAFC, four of the five Oscar nominees in 1975 won a critics Best Picture award.\n\n1980-1988:\n\nThe Boston Society of Film Critics began in 1980 and were much more like the NSFC, awarding Foreign films (3 of their first 8) and ignoring the Oscar choices (only 4 noms, no winners). The NSFC continued their independent streak (just 2 Oscar noms, no winners, 4 films picked by no other groups), the LAFC (two Oscar winners, only Brazil failed to be nominated) and NYFC (3 winners, all others nominated) continued to have strong Oscar streaks. The NYFC and NBR actually agreed five years in a row (80-84) although the NBR had seven winners in that stretch and the NBR had its strongest Oscar showing (four straight winners, all but two films at least nominated). Also, continuing back to 1975, the longest stretch of Oscar winners that won at least one critics award (75-84).\n\n1989-2021:\n\nThe Chicago Film Critics finally made it a big six, making things different by looking more like an awards group (more categories, nominees first, then winners). During this period, Chicago had the highest Oscar win count (12) with NYFC and LAFC having the least (6 each, a 16 year gap at LAFC from 1993 to 2009). The NBR, surprisingly, had the most Oscar noms (all but 4 of their winners) while the NSFC had the fewest (16 winners failed to be nominated). GoodFellas became the first film to win five awards (all but NBR) with Schindler’s List the first to win all six, which happened again with L.A. Confidential and The Social Network.\n\nBest by Group\n\nNYFC: Citizen Kane\n\nLAFC: Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\n\nNSFC: GoodFellas\n\nBSFC: GoodFellas\n\nCFC: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of
