This is the story of Elsa Martinelli, who is forced to make an agonizing choice: fight for her land in Texas or move west to California in search of a better life.\n\nLike so many of her neighbors, Elsa courageously faces the hardships and sacrifices that came to define an entire generation during the Great Depression as they fought for the American Dream.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nWe love books that truly transport you to another time and place, and few books do that quite as well as The Four Winds. You feel the dirt and the direness that so many experienced.\n\nWe knew people from Oklahoma and Texas fled looking for a better life in California during the Dust Bowl years, but this novel opened our eyes to how poorly they were treated and how much they were discriminated against when they arrived, no matter how hard they were willing to work.\n\nAlso Featured on These Book Lists:\n\nBest Kristin Hannah Books\n\nUnforgettable Dust Bowl Books\n\nBest Books of 2021\n\nBook Summary\n\nGloria needs to reinvent herself after a family scandal.

She is best known for her work in the 1930s during the Dust Bowl. In this riveting historical fiction, we get to see the world through her lens.\n\nDorothea arrived in San Francisco at 22, determined to make her way independently as a woman. However, she soon married a talented but volatile painter, Maynard Dixon. By the early 30s, her marriage was floundering as much as the economy. So, she took to the road with her camera, creating images that inspired, reformed, and defined the era.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nWhile we weren’t very familiar with Dorothea Lange before finding this book, we’ve seen one of her most famous works, Migrant Mother, many times. It’s a lasting reminder of the human suffering that came during the Dust Bowl years.

Harper Lee actually penned this novel in the late 50s (the decade in which the story was set), but her early publisher had reservations and recommended she take a different approach – resulting in To Kill A Mockingbird. People either love or hate Go Set a Watchman.

The year is 1938, and no American zoo has successfully housed giraffes before. The female zoo director of the San Diego Zoo believes she can do it. The giraffes have just survived a hurricane en route to the East Coast, and Riley Jones, the curmudgeonly head zookeeper, is responsible for safely transporting the giraffes from New York City to San Diego.\n\nAmerica is still in the throes of the Great Depression, and the Dust Bowl conditions continue to ravage the drought-stricken Southern Plains states. A coast-to-coast trek with giant animals is no easy feat. Jones begrudgingly teams up with a starving teenager named Woody to help him make the journey. The adventures along the way include run-ins with circus con artists, being tailed by a female photographer looking for a big scoop, an emotional visit to Woodyâs hometown, and so much more.\n\nAt its heart, this is a coming-of-age story. Now, at the age of 105, Woody recounts his 12-day cross-country trip with Jones and the giraffes and how it shaped his life.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nAfter we both gave this book 5 stars, we recommended it to others in a variety of age ranges.

Frank Baum. The book follows two storylines: one tells the story of Maud’s youth as the rebellious daughter of a leading suffragette and the early years of Maud and Frank’s marriage on the prairie.\n\nThe second storyline takes place in 1930s Hollywood when Maud learns that MGM is adapting The Wonderful Wizard of Oz into a movie. Then 77, Maud finagles her way onto the set in hopes of ensuring the producers stay true to the spirit of the book. She meets Judy Garland and recognizes in the young woman the yearning that defined her own life story.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nOne of the highlights of 1939 was the release of the endearing film The Wizard of Oz.

We hope you enjoy learning a bit more about this period in history.\n\nFollowing the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the majority of the 1930s would be defined by The Great Depression. In 1932, nearly 25% of the US population was unemployed, which rose to nearly 33% in early 1933.\n\nBeginning in 1931, the US suffered the worst drought in its history, leading to the Dust Bowl years. Strong winds stripped the topsoil from the ground, devastating farms throughout the Great Plains. This forced many to move in search of work and better living conditions.\n\nThe Empire State Building was completed in 1931.\n\nDuring the 1930s, many bank robbers and murders gained celebrity status – a strange phenomenon unique to this decade.\n\nThe Third Reich rose to power in 1933 and began instituting a series of measures to persecute Jewish citizens. Throughout the decade, Hilter undermined the post-WWI international order, withdrawing from the League of Nations and building up the German army. When Germany attacked Poland in 1939, it marked the start of World War II.\n\nThe 21st Amendment passed in 1933, repealing the 18th Amendment and ending prohibition.\n\nAlcatraz Federal Penitentiary (aka “The Rock”) opens near San Francisco. It is used to hold some of the most dangerous and well-known US criminals.\n\nPenguin Books produced their first paperback books in 1935, making affordable literature accessible to the masses.\n\nThe US Social Security Act was signed into law in 1935.\n\nThe 1936 Olympics were held in Berlin, Germany amid a very tense political atmosphere. Hilter viewed the games as an opportunity to prove his theory of Aryan racial superiority. However, he was humiliated when African-American sprinter and long jumper Jesse Owens won four gold medals for the US.\n\nThe Spanish Civil War began in 1936, and continued until 1939, when Franco conquered Madrid.\n\nAmelia Earhart became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean in 1932. Sadly, she disappeared over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 during an attempt to circumnavigate the globe.\n\nIn 1937, the Hindenburg, a German Zeppelin airship, was scheduled to make 10 round trips between Europe and the US. On the first of these flights, the Hindenburg caught fire while attempting to land in New Jersey, killing 35 of the 97 people aboard.\n\nIn 1938, Seabiscuit beat War Admiral in what came to be called the “Race of the Century.”\n\nThe Wizard of Oz, starring Judy Garland, premiered in 1939.\n\nFIND YOUR PERFECT BOOK LIST"
