        "text": "A Century of Film\n\nAdapted Screenplay\n\nIt didn’t take long for screenwriters to realize that what had been successful in other mediums could be successful in film as well. After all, what is probably the first great film, A Trip to the Moon, came from H.G. Wells before Melies visualized it.\n\nThe awards groups knew it right from the start, with Best Writing (Adaptation) a category in the very first Oscars. Great literature could be adapted but the not-so-great could also transcend its original material. My whole project of going through the Adapted Screenplay, year by year, is a documented history of the kinds of great (and not great) works that have been adapted into great (and not great, but award winning or nominated) films over the years.\n\nMy Top 5 Adapted Screenplays in Film History:\n\nCasablanca\n\nThe Princess Bride\n\nThe Seventh Seal\n\nThe Godfather\n\nTouch of Evil\n\nThe other 9 Point Adapted Screenplays (chronological):\n\nThe Petrified Forest\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath\n\nThe Philadelphia Story\n\nThe Maltese Falcon\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives\n\nBrief Encounter\n\nTreasure of the Sierra Madre\n\nAll About Eve\n\nA Streetcar Named Desire\n\nRashomon\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai\n\nPaths of Glory\n\nTouch of Evil\n\nSome Like It Hot\n\nDr. Strangelove\n\nWho’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf\n\nChimes at Midnight\n\nM*A*S*H\n\nMonty Python and the Holy Grail\n\nAll the President’s Men\n\nBeing There\n\nBreaker Morant\n\nTerms of Endearment\n\nA Room with a View\n\nGlory\n\nField of Dreams\n\nGoodFellas\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs\n\nSchindler’s List\n\nThe Age of Innocence\n\nEd Wood\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption\n\nTrainspotting\n\nThe English Patient\n\nL.A. Confidential\n\nThe Ice Storm\n\nOut of Sight\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nThe Hours\n\nAdaptation\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\n\nSideways\n\nBrokeback Mountain\n\nnote: I rate all aspects of film on a 9 point scale. They also correspond to the 100 point scale for Best Picture. Films above *** (76-99) all land on the scale. 1 point is for 76-79, just worth mentioning. 2 points is for 80-83, a weak mention, 3 points is for 84-87, near great, 4 points is for 88-89 (which is ****), a solid nominee, 5 points is for 90-91, a very solid nominee, 6 points is for 92-93, a weak winner, a 7 points is for 94-95, a worthwhile winner, 8 points is 96-97, the kind of winner you can’t complain about even if it’s not your #1 choice and 9 points is for 98-99, the very best of all-time. The above list are my 9 point films for Sound through 2011, listed chronologically.\n\nThe Writers\n\nBen Hecht\n\nThough Hecht would eventually direct some films, he was primarily a writer and the first major writer to come to Hollywood and transition into this new system (he was already well-known as a playwright, namely for The Front Page and he had been a reporter in Chicago). While both of his Oscars were for Original Story, he was actually a better writer when it came to adapting.\n\nKey Films: Wuthering Heights, Scarface, Design for Living\n\nRobert Riskin\n\nFrank Capra’s writer all through the thirties and one of the top person when it comes to points in that decade, whether it be Nighthawk Points or the Oscars (where he won one and earned three other nominations, all with Capra, all for adapted scripts).\n\nKey Films: Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, It Happened One Night, You Can’t Take It With You\n\nJohn Huston\n\nThe only writer with a lot of mentions on my own list to not have an original Screenplay on the list. He was the consummate adaptor, mostly for male oriented material with tough guys in hard situations. He’s 4th All-time in Oscar Points and in the Top 10 for the WGA and just outside the Top 10 at the Nighthhawks.\n\nKey Films: The Maltese Falcon, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The African Queen, The Asphalt Jungle\n\nBilly Wilder\n\nThe writer who, more than any other, has the best balance between Original and Adapted and the relatively rare writer (ten all-time) to win Oscars in both.\n\nKey Films: Some Like It Hot, Double Indemnity, The Lost Weekend, Sabrina, Stalag 17\n\nAkira Kurosawa\n\nThough his Samurai films were mostly Original, his other great work was mostly Adapted and the four films listed here are just the tip of the iceberg. To their own shame, the Oscars never nominated him for writing but he’s in 4th place at the Nighthawks.\n\nKey Films: Rashomon, Ran, High and Low, Throne of Blood\n\nStanley Kubrick\n\nHe never won an Oscar (in five nominations) and the Globes somehow never even nominated him for writing but he did win a WGA among his five nominations there and at the Nighthawks he wins three Adapted awards.\n\nKey Films: Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, Paths of Glory, The Shining\n\nErnest Lehman\n\nAnother pure writer (he produced as well but never directed), Lehman earned four Oscar noms but never won. However, he’s third all-time in WGA points where he won a whopping five awards.\n\nKey Films: Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf, West Side Story\n\nWilliam Goldman\n\nAnother of the rare breed to win Oscars for both Original (Butch Cassidy) and Adapted (All the President’s Men). Also, he’s well known for writing multiple great books about the process of being a screenwriter in Hollywood (if you’ve never read Adventures in the Screen Trade or Which Lie Did I Tell you need to – they are among the very best film books available).\n\nKey Films: The Princess Bride, All the President’s Men, Misery\n\nThe Academy Awards\n\nSummary:\n\nThere is much to be read here and a bit to be read here as well. The former includes some tidbits about the history of the category, how it has dominated among the major Oscar films of all-time as well as some bits about the long history of great writers from other mediums who managed to earn an Oscar nomination but not win the award itself. I failed to mention Tony Kushner in that original bit and since then Nick Hornby also earned a nomination without winning.\n\nDirectors:\n\nWilliam Wyler’s films have the most nominations (10, including two wins) but John Huston is the most dominant since he earned seven nominations for writing his own films. Fred Zinnemann is the only director whose films won three Oscars (with three different writers) while Coppola, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Alexander Payne and George Seaton are the only writer-directors to win multiple Adapted Screenplay Oscars.\n\nFranchises:\n\nOf course this is the category where franchises would be eligible but most people don’t think highly of the writing in franchises, so nominations haven’t been that prevalent. That being said, they are more common than perhaps you might think, beginning in 1936 with a nomination for After the Thin Man. After that, it was a long wait until The Godfather Part II came along. The next one to get a nomination also won (Return of the King). Since then there has also been Before Sunset and Toy Story 3.\n\nGenres:\n\nAdapted is really heavy in Drama, far more so than Original Screenplay is. It accounts for a whopping 57% of the nominations and an astounding 65.48% of the wins. It has won 55 times, with Comedy (10) and Crime (6) the only other genres with more than three wins. Comedy (70 noms to Drama’s 231) is the only other genre with more than 20 noms. Adventure and Sci-Fi have never won the Oscar and there are six genres that have only won once.\n\nBest Picture:\n\nThirty nine films have won Best Picture and Adapted Screenplay, far more than Original Screenplay, and another 15 Picture winners were nominated for Adapted Screenplay. Every Picture winner from 37-47 and 13 of the 15 from 55-69 were Adapted Screenplay nominees or winners. It took until 1976-78 for three straight Picture winners not to earn a nomination here and there have been only two other such streaks (97-99, 09-11). 33 films have won Picture, Director and Adapted Screenplay compared to 11 doing that with Original though Going My Way, because of the screenplay intricacies, is counted on both lists. It took until 2009-10 for Original to do that in back-to-back years while Adapted did it five straight from 42-46. Only eight Originals have won Picture, Director and a lead acting Oscar while 19 Adapted have done it. In total, 241 films have been nominated for Picture and Adapted Screenplay, well over 50% of the total nominees as opposed to just barely more than a quarter of the Original Screenplay nominees. Until 1996, The Bad and the Beautiful was the only Adapted winner without a Picture nomination and there still have only been three (Sling Blade and Gods and Monsters are the others). From 1937 to 1942 every Adapted nominee earned a Picture nomination. Until the late nineties it was rare to have a year with just one Picture nominee among the Adapted nominees (there has never been a year with zero) and in 1964 and 2010 they all were nominated.\n\nForeign Films:\n\nThis is one place where Original is much better. It took until 1946 for Adapted to have a Foreign nominee (by which point Original already had a Foreign winner) and Open City only counts because of the way the categories were structured (today it would be Original). By 1969, at which point Original had a several year streak going of at least one Foreign nominee a year, Adapted was only reaching its fourth nomination. But the seventies were much stronger (nine nominations including two each in 75 and 76) and through 2011, there have been 21 Foreign nominees though there still hasn’t been a Foreign winner.\n\nSingle Nominations:\n\nUnlike Original where it happened for years, no Adapted winner has won without at least another nomination. Until 1996, no Adapted film won without at least two other nominations. A whopping 36% of the Original Screenplay nominees received no other nominations as compared to the less than 10% for Adapted. Original has never gone more than two years without a single nominee while Adapted once went six (37-42) and only had one from 1932-42.\n\nOther Categories:\n\nPicture, of course, is a huge match-up, with over half the films nominated for both. Director also appears among more than half the films and all the acting categories match up far more than for Original. Even Visual Effects crosses over (Forrest Gump and Return of the King won both). No film has yet won Adapted and Sound Editing. There has been little crossover with Animated Film (two Adapted nominees, both won Animated – Shrek and Toy Story 3) and with Foreign Film (three Adapted nominees have won Foreign but obviously nothing has won both).\n\nPoints:\n\nBecause the two screenwriting categories are not only fluid but also overlap depending on how the script is categorized, I keep just one point spreadsheet for both writing categories. So here are the points for all the writing categories at the Oscars.\n\nTop Oscar Points by Decade:\n\n20s: Joseph Farnham – 160\n\n30s: Robert Riskin / Frances Marion – 200\n\n40s: Billy Wilder – 240\n\n50s: Michael Wilson – 240\n\n60s: Robert Bolt – 200\n\n70s: Francis Ford Coppola – 320\n\n80s: Woody Allen – 240\n\n90s: Woody Allen – 200\n\n00s: Ethan and Joel Coen – 160\n\nnote: Farnham, Marion, Wilson, Bolt and Coppola didn’t receive any points outside of those decades.\n\nTop 10 Oscar Points:\n\nWoody Allen – 720\n\nBilly Wilder – 600\n\nCharles Brackett – 400\n\nJohn Huston – 360\n\nBen Hecht – 320\n\nFederico Fellini – 320\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola – 320\n\nEthan and Joel Coen – 280\n\nJoseph L. Mankiewicz / Carl Foreman – 280\n\nPaddy Chayefsky / Robert Benton / Oliver Stone – 280\n\nTop 5 Oscar Winners:\n\nCasablanca\n\nThe Godfather\n\nL.A. Confidential\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\n\nAll About Eve\n\nWorst 5 Oscar Winners:\n\nSling Blade\n\nCimarron\n\nGigi\n\nOut of Africa\n\nDriving Miss Daisy\n\nWorst 5 Oscar Nominees:\n\nLove Story\n\nAirport\n\nSling Blade\n\nFatal Attraction\n\nPeyton Place\n\nTop 5 Oscar Years:\n\n1993 (Schindler’s List, Age of Innocence, In the Name of the Father, Remains of the Day, Shadowlands)\n\n1951 (A Place in the Sun, A Streetcar Named Desire, Detective Story, African Queen, La Ronde)\n\n2005 (Brokeback Mountain, Munich, Constant Gardener, History of Violence, Capote)\n\n2002 (Pianist, Hours, Adaptation, About a Boy, Chicago)\n\n2011 (Descendants, Hugo, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Ides of March, Moneyball)\n\nTop 5 Oscars Years by Oscar Score:\n\n1993 – 100 (Schindler’s List, Age of Innocence, In the Name of the Father, Remains of the Day, Shadowlands)\n\n1951 – 97.4 (A Place in the Sun, A Streetcar Named Desire, Detective Story, African Queen, La Ronde)\n\n2005 – 97.3 (Brokeback Mountain, Munich, Constant Gardener, History of Violence, Capote)\n\n2011 – 97.1 (Descendants, Hugo, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Ides of March, Moneyball)\n\n1982 – 96.8 (Missing, Sophie’s Choice, Verdict, Das Boot, Victor/Victoria)\n\nnote: The difference between this list and the previous one is that the first one is a flat total based on my 9 point scale. In this one, it’s comparing my top five films to the ones the Oscars actually nominated. So, in the first one, it’s how good are the nominees. In this one it’s how good are the nominees compared to what else was eligible.\n\nWorst 5 Oscar Years:\n\n1929 (The Patriot, In Old Arizona, Valiant, Leatherneck, Our Dancing Daughters, Wonder of Women)\n\n1931 (Cimarron, Criminal Code, Little Caesar, Skippy, Holiday)\n\n1942 (Mrs Miniver, Random Harvest, Pride of the Yankees, 49th Parallel, Talk of the Town)\n\n1930 (Big House, All Quiet on the Western Front, Disraeli, Divorcee, Street of Chance)\n\n1956 (Around the World in 80 Days, Baby Doll, Lust for Life, Giant, Friendly Persuasion)\n\nnote: 1929 technically shouldn’t go there since I’ve only seen four of the six nominees (The Patriot and Wonder of Women are lost) but none of them earn any points, and it’s the only year with a flat zero for a score.\n\nnote: The Worst 5 Years by Oscar Score are the same five.\n\nTop 5 Films to win the Oscar (based on quality of film not writing):\n\nThe Godfather\n\nCasablanca\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai\n\nSchindler’s List\n\nWorst 5 Films to win the Oscar (based on quality of film not writing):\n\nSling Blade\n\nCimarron\n\nGigi\n\nOut of Africa\n\nOn Golden Pond\n\nWorst 5 Films to earn an Oscar nomination (based on quality of film not writing):\n\nFatal Attraction\n\nI Want to Live\n\nLove Story\n\nAirport\n\nSling Blade\n\nYears in Which the Worst of the Nominees Won the Oscar:\n\n1931: Cimarron over Little Caesar, Criminal Code, Holiday, Skippy\n\n1932: Bad Girl over Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Arrowsmith\n\n1936: Story of Louis Pasteur over Mr Deeds Goes to Town, Dodsworth, My Man Godfrey, After the Thin Man\n\n1939: Gone with the Wind over Mr Smith Goes to Washington, Wuthering Heights, Goodbye Mr Chips, Ninotchka\n\n1958: Gigi over Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Separate Tables, Horse’s Mouth, I Want to Live\n\n1961: Judgment at Nuremberg over West Side Story, Hustler, Guns of Navarone, Breakfast at Tiffany’s\n\n1981: On Golden Pond over French Lieutenant’s Woman, Ragtime, Pennies from Heaven, Prince of the City\n\n1989: Driving Miss Daisy over Field of Dreams, Born on the Fourth of July, My Left Foot, Enemies a Love Story\n\n1994: Forrest Gump over Shawshank Redemption, Quiz, Show, Nobody’s Fool, Madness of King George\n\n1996: Sling Blade over Trainspotting, English Patient, Crucible, Hamlet\n\n2001: A Beautiful Mind over Fellowship of the Ring, In the Bedroom, Ghost World, Shrek\n\nOscar Scores By Decade:\n\n1930’s: 48.6\n\n1940’s: 67.0\n\n1950’s: 58.7\n\n1960’s: 67.7\n\n1970’s: 70.9\n\n1980’s: 78.3\n\n1990’s: 78.6\n\n2000’s: 79.3\n\n2010’s: 92.9\n\nAll-Time: 70.1\n\nGolden Globes\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Globes began their Best Screenplay Award in 1947, simply giving an award to Miracle on 34th Street. They were then inconsistent, giving awards in 1948, 51, 53 and 54 but having a slate of two nominees in 1949 and three each in 1950 and 1952. The first three to win the award were all Original but the next five were all Adapted. Then the Globes dropped the category just as they were re-opening their other categories to full slates of nominees again. It wouldn’t be revived until 1965 at which point it would become regular (5 nominees with a handful of exceptions with six nominees).\n\nMany genres have won at least once (Kids, Suspense, Musical, War and Western have won just once). Though a number of films with 6 nominations have failed to earn Screenplay noms (two of which came during the period where the category didn’t exist), no film has earned 7 or more Globe noms without a Screenplay nom. A Star is Born (1976) is the only film to win 5 Globes without a Screenplay win (or even a nom). The only Foreign nominee is The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.\n\nGiven that the Globes have twice as many Picture nominees and half as many Screenplay nominees as the Oscars, it’s not surprising that the only films to win Screenplay without another nomination were all in the era where there were no nominees in categories other than the winners. It’s also been fairly rare for films to earn a Screenplay nom with no other noms with just 16 films over the years and only 11 since the category began with a full slate of nominees in 1965.\n\nWinners often win something else; just 10 of the 47 winners since the award began again have failed to win another Globe. Most of them win Picture, with 29 films winning both awards though only four of those won Picture – Comedy and until 1998 the only film to win both was The Goodbye Girl, which is ironic, since it lost both to Annie Hall at the Oscars. It is perhaps notable that of the four films to win Screenplay and Picture – Comedy, three were original (Sideways wasn’t) while in Drama, of the 25 films to win both, only three were original (Love Story, Chinatown, American Beauty). Since 1965, The Hospital is the only film to win Screenplay without a Picture nom (Gandhi was a “Foreign Film” and it won Foreign Film).\n\nThere will be a lot more trivia about this category at the Globes in the forthcoming Globes post.\n\nTop 10 Globes Points:\n\nWoody Allen – 320\n\nStirling Silliphant – 240\n\nRobert Bolt – 240\n\nOliver Stone – 240\n\nAaron Sorkin – 240\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola – 200\n\nAlexander Payne – 200\n\n12 writers – 160\n\nnote: The following list makes distinctions between original and adapted but the Globes themselves have never done so. This is because I wrote no piece on the Globes for the Original Screenplay post.\n\nBest Winner (Adapted): The Godfather\n\nBest Winner (Original): Chinatown\n\nWorst Winner (Adapted): The Ninth Configuration\n\nWorst Winner (Original): Love Story\n\nBest Year for Nominees: 2004 (Sideways, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Aviator, Closer, Finding Neverland)\n\nWeakest Year for Nominees: 1965 (Doctor Zhivago, Collector, Slender Thread, Agony and the Ecstasy, Patch of Blue)\n\nLowest Critical Acclaim for a Globe Winner (Adapted): Charly\n\nLowest Critical Acclaim for a Globe Winner (Original): The People vs. Larry Flynt\n\nHighest Critical Acclaim for a Globe Nominee (Adapted): L.A. Confidential **\n\nHighest Critical Acclaim for a Globe Nominee (Original): The Piano\n\nLowest Critical Acclaim for a Globe nominee (Adapted): Frenzy\n\nLowest Critical Acclaim for a Globe nominee (Original): Mulholland Drive\n\nHighest Critical Acclaim for a Globe snub (Adapted): A Room with a View\n\nHighest Critical Acclaim for a Globe snub (Original): Melvin and Howard\n\nBest Screenplay for a Globe snub (Adapted): The Princess Bride\n\nBest Screenplay for a Globe snub (Original): Raiders of the Lost Ark\n\nBest Globe Nominee Not Nominated by Any Other Group (Adapted): A Few Good Men\n\nBest Globe Nominee Not Nominated by Any Other Group (Original): House of Games\n\nnote: The reason there is no “Worst Nominee” listed for either Adapted or Original is because the worst nominee won the Globe. What fucking morons voted for those scripts?\n\nnote: L.A. Confidential had a 20% higher Consensus score than any other Adapted film that failed to win the Globe.\n\nThe BAFTA Awards\n\nSummary:\n\nIn some ways, possibly even more of a nightmare than the Oscars. The award began as Best British Screenplay in 1954 and continued that way until 1967 (I only count it towards the Consensus in that stretch if it’s for a film that already has other nominations). It is interesting to note that in that stretch they gave the award to four films that won Best Picture at the Oscars including one (Lawrence of Arabia) that didn’t win the Oscar (the other three were Bridge on the River Kwai, Tom Jones, A Man for all Seasons). Then, in 1968, the year that they changed their awards system (dropping the British categories), they changed it to just Screenplay with no regard for whether it was original or adapted (an odd choice at the same time the WGA was finally making that split). From 1968 to 1982, it was a four nominee, one award category and interesting to note that in that 15 year stretch, with no British requirement, only two Oscar winners for Best Picture won (Midnight Cowboy, Annie Hall). Then in 1983, it finally broke into original and adapted as separate categories though it would continue to have four nominees (with some exceptions) until 1999. Like with Original Screenplay, it wouldn’t agree much with the Oscars before it expanded to five Oscar nominees with only three films winning both (Out of Africa, Dangerous Liaisons, Schindler’s List). Since 2000, six films have won both awards and only Last King of Scotland won the BAFTA without an Oscar nom.\n\nFor the following categories, I will only discuss both the Screenplay category as it existed from 1968 to 1982 (ignoring the British Screenply category) and the Adapted Screenplay category from 1982 forward.\n\nGenres:\n\nAction, Adventure, Fantasy and Kids never earned Screenplay nominations and 14 of the 17 winners were either Comedy of Drama (7 each).\n\nIn Adapted, Adventure is the only category without a nomination. Drama has dominated the winners (15 of 29) but a number of genres have squeaked out one win (Fantasy, Horror, Kids, Musical, Mystery, War). Drama accounts for over half of the nominations.\n\nBest Picture:\n\nThe only film to win Picture without a Screenplay nomination during those 15 years was Day for Night and seven films won both. Of the 60 Screenplay nominees in the era, 42 were nominated for Picture.\n\nIn Adapted, nine films have won both and another seven films have won Picture with an Adapted Screenplay nomination. Just under half of the Screenplay nominees have earned Picture noms (65 for 133). A whopping 11 films have won Adapted Screenplay without a Picture nomination in less than 30 years while it’s only happened 3 times in over 80 years at the Oscars.\n\nSingle Nominees:\n\nDuring the 15 years of the single category only two films managed to earn a nomination without any other nominations: Blazing Saddles and Airplane.\n\nIt was fairly common in the early years of Adapted Screenplay to have a nominee with no other nominations (seven in the first seven years) but much more rare since then (six in 22 years).\n\nForeign Films:\n\nThree Foreign Films earned Screenplay noms with Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie winning the award. Twelve films have earned Adapted noms though only Jean de Florette and Diving Bell and the Butterfly have won the award.\n\nOther Categories:\n\nScreenplay had large crossovers with both Picture and Director (over half of the Screenplay nominees were nominated for each). Since Adapted Screenplay came about every category has crossed over with it at least once (even Song thanks to Tootsie which was bizarrely nominated for Adapted Screenplay).

However, for the first several years it was just an award (with no nominees) and it was a single award, regardless of the source. In 1997, they started splitting the award into Adapted and Original but it was still just one winner each. Then in 2001 they got strange, adding nominees, but combining it back into just one award. It started with three nominees, went to four the next year (perhaps because of the double winner for Charlie Kauffman’s two scripts) then to five, and moved back and forth between five and six until 2008. Then in 2009 they finally split into two separate award nominations although the number of nominees continued to be inconsistent.\n\nAs with other groups, the point leaders will be listed under Adapted Screenplay, especially since the history of this award has been so very strange.\n\nTop 5 BFCA Points:\n\nAaron Sorkin – 200\n\nEthan Coen – 160\n\nJoel Coen – 160\n\nAlexander Payne – 160\n\n7 writers – 120\n\nBest Winner (Combined): The English Patient\n\nBest Winner (Adapted): L.A.

First, when they began in 1948, they had five different categories, covering four genres and a “Best Written Film Concerning Problems in the American Scene”, which was mostly filled with scripts nominated in another category as well. Second, they seemed to have no limit on nominations in that first year so there were 50 total nominations that first year. Third, they didn’t have rules about where things belong so Treasure of the Sierra Madre won the Western category and lost in the Drama category. For the first three years, things continued the same, though, at least by 1950, they had the nominees under control with a limit for five in most categories. In 1951, Westerns were dropped for a new “Low-Budget” film category which was thankfully dropped in 1952 along with the “Problem” category. So, by 1952 they were at least down to three categories with five nominees in each. But Musical (a category often filled with subpar nominees as is detailed in my Adapted Screenplay post laments from 1952 to 1968 though at least after 1964 it never again had five nominees).\n\nBy 1967, long after the Academy had mostly fixed their problems, the WGA finally addressed theirs and made things worse. They added an Original category but didn’t drop anything else, so Bonnie and Clyde became the first film since 1949 to win two WGA awards. Finally in 1969, they actually got quite clever and broke things up into Adapted and Original, divided by Comedy and Drama. That works for me, although I sometimes question their classifications (Butch Cassidy is a Drama? Catch-22 is a Drama? Patton, explicitly based on a book, is Original? Terms of Endearment is a Comedy?) Also, unlike the Globes, they never explicitly named their category Comedy / Musical which makes it stupid to list Cabaret which is a Musical but is definitely not a Comedy. The other problem, of course, which I am well aware of from my own Nighthawk Awards, is that there are not a plethora of awards-worthy Adapted Comedies. By 1983, the last year of that category division, it had been five years since Adapted Comedy had the same number of nominees as Adapted Drama (not helped by considering a film like World According to Garp as a Drama).\n\nSo in 1984, the WGA made one final adjustment and ended up with categories just like the Oscars and the BAFTAs (though the BAFTAs had only been doing it for a year at that point): Adapted and Original. Of course, the problems weren’t done and for this, I will break my “2011” curtain for a moment, and act like it’s 2020, which it is. The first problem is that the WGA doesn’t have the same considerations about what makes an adapted screenplay as the Academy does. That’s how The Last Emperor is nominated as Original at the WGA but wins Adapted at the Oscars or Moonlight actually wins the WGA in Original but Adapted at the Oscars. In 2005, they went the opposite way, considering Syriana Adapted while the Academy decided it was Original. The second thing is that the WGA is first and foremost a union. Unlike the other guilds who give the awards based on what they think is the best work of the year, the WGA refuses to acknowledge scripts that are written by people who aren’t a guild member (any Tarantino script, which is why Pulp Fiction didn’t technically sweep all the awards) or don’t hold to the guild standards (which is why none of the Pixar films have ever been nominated in spite of their numerous Oscar nominations). The WGA, I’m sure, thinks this makes them look strong and united while I think it makes them look insular, weak and petty. That’s why there was a five year stretch where three films (King’s Speech, Artist, Birdman) won the PGA and DGA and weren’t WGA nominated (two of them going on to win the Screenplay Oscar). Every year we have to decide going into the Oscar nominations which films might have taken a hit by being passed over by the WGA and which films simply weren’t eligible for their privileged award.\n\nTop 10 WGA Points:\n\nWoody Allen – 1000\n\nBilly Wilder – 800\n\nErnest Lehman – 560\n\nI.A.L.

They gave it for three years then put it away for almost 50. It took almost a decade before the NYFC revived the idea in 1959. Like the NBR, they didn’t bother to distinguish between an original or an adapted script; the NBR gave its first two awards to adapted and then to an original while the NYFC went with an adapted the first year and an original the next year. Other awards groups as they would follow will do the same with the NSFC starting in 1967, the LAFC in their first year of 1975 and the BSFC in their first year of 1980. The CFC would start with a single award in 1990. The NBR revived their dormant award in 1998 and then expanded it in 2003 to encompass separate original and adapted awards with the CFC following suit in 2006.\n\nThe first two NBR winners and the first NYFC winner were all adapted (Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Fallen Idol, Anatomy of a Murder). But the various critics awards for Best Screenplay soon became the playground for Original scripts as only 11 Adapted scripts had managed to win an award from 1959 to 1988 before things really began to finally open up (see the next section).\n\nMultiple Wins:\n\nFor a long time (over 20 years, including 21 films), the only films to win multiple critics awards were Original. Drugstore Cowboy finally broke that run in 1989, becoming the first Adapted script to win multiple awards (it won three). It was an ironic choice to break that barrier since it wouldn’t win any other awards or even earn any other nominations from the awards groups. It was then followed two years later with three wins for Naked Lunch which did the exact same thing. L.A. Confidential would become the first to win five awards (all but the NBR which wouldn’t revive the category until the following year). Sideways would then become the first (and only) film to win all six Screenplay awards.\n\nMultiple Films:\n\nIt’s rare for an award to go to more than one film. There have been a couple of ties but the only case of a writer winning an award for multiple films was 2002 when the NBR (in their last year before the split awards) gave it to Charlie Kauffman for Adaptation, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and Human Nature.\n\nForeign Films:\n\nStory of Adele H is the only Adapted Foreign Film to ever win a Screenplay award.\n\nSingle Awards:\n\nNo Adapted Screenplay has ever won multiple critics awards without winning at least one other critics award. Only three have even won a single award without winning any other awards (Cider House Rules, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, In the Loop).\n\nOther Awards:\n\nIf you can do math, you know that 95 films have won Screenplay and additional critics awards. Of those, 48 won only one Screenplay award but those single winners include some of the biggest films ever at critics awards including (in points order) GoodFellas, Schindler’s List, Hurt Locker, Silence of the Lambs and Terms of Endearment. Those five films won a combined five writing awards but 23 Picture awards, 19 Director awards and 28 acting awards. The only other comparable group are those that won five or more Screenplay awards because those four films (listed above) won a combined 21 writing awards but also 20 Picture awards, 19 Director awards and 16 acting awards. Overall, 52 films have won Screenplay and Picture, the biggest overlap (followed closely by Director with 49). Aside from Squid and the Whale (exempted above), the only films with four Screenplay wins without a Picture win are Adaptation and The Queen. Screenplay awards have overlapped with every critics award (even Art Direction though just once – Inception).\n\nBest by Group\n\nNYFC: L.A. Confidential, 1997\n\nLAFC: L.A.

But I don’t always have a full slate of nominees and some years I don’t have any nominees.\n\nDirectors:\n\nFive directors have had eight films nominated, three of them writer-directors (Huston, Kubrick, Wilder) and two of them not writers (Hitchcock, Wyler). David Lean’s films have the most wins (4) but he only wrote one of them (Great Expectations). Kubrick, Welles and Wilder won three awards each while John Ford and Ang Lee were non-writing directors whose films won three each.\n\nFranchises:\n\nFanny (the 1932 film though eligible in 1948) is the first sequel to earn a nomination. After that it’s a bit of a wait until The World of Apu. The Godfather Part II is the first sequel to win the Nighthawk. After that there are 10 more that earn nominations through 2011 including two Star Trek films and three Harry Potter films though only Return of the King wins the Nighthawk.\n\nGenres:\n\nWith 41 wins and 186 nominations, Drama is the biggest genre but that’s to be expected, earning between 40 and 50% of both marks. Comedy is next in the high teen percentages for both noms and wins. No other genre has more than 25 noms (just under 6%) or less than 6 (1.41%). Crime is the only other genre with more than 6% of the wins (8 wins for 9.41%) while Adventure and Sci-Fi have never won.\n\nBest Picture:\n\nOf the 85 Picture winners just over half of them win Adapted Screenplay (47). Another four Picture winners earn Adapted noms. Five films do manage to win Adapted Screenplay without a Picture nom, all of them coming in at #6 for the year (That Obscure Object of Desire, Being There, French Lieutenant’s Woman, Hours, Education). In all, almost exactly half of the Adapted Screenplay nominees are nominated for Picture.\n\nForeign Film:\n\nEight Foreign Films win the award, starting in 1929 (Nosferatu) and most recently in 2000 (Crouching Tiger). That includes Bergman twice and Kurosawa twice. In total, 52 Foreign films earn nominations with Kurosawa (5 noms) and Truffaut (4 noms) leading the way.\n\nSingle Nominations:\n\nSixteen films manage to earn an Adapted Screenplay nom with no other Nighthawk noms with increased frequency lately (four times from 2001 to 2011 after only four times from 1974 to 2000).\n\nOther Categories:\n\nPicture has the biggest overlap (239 films) with Director not far behind (231) with Editing and Actor both over 200 while Actress is barely over half that. Every category overlaps at least 10 times but no film has won both Adapted Screenplay and Animated Film (though ten films have won Animated Film and earned an Adapted Screenplay nom – the only film with an Adapted Screenplay nom without an Animated Film win is Toy Story 2).\n\nTop 10 Nighthawk Points:\n\nIngmar Bergman – 1040\n\nWoody Allen – 960\n\nBilly Wilder – 840\n\nAkira Kurosawa – 680\n\nStanley Kubrick – 480\n\nCharlie Chaplin – 440\n\nJoel and Ethan Coen – 440\n\nFederico Fellini – 360\n\nPreston Sturges / Dudley Nichols / Michael Powell / Emeric Pressburger – 320\n\nErnest Lehman / Orson Welles / John Huston / Luis Buñuel – 320\n\nTop 10 Nighthawk Drama Points:\n\nIngmar Bergman – 1160\n\nAkira Kurosawa – 1000\n\nBilly Wilder – 480\n\nMicheal Powell – 400\n\nEmeric Pressburger – 400\n\nJohn Huston – 400\n\nStanley Kubrick – 400\n\nDudley Nichols – 320\n\nOrson Welles – 320\n\nEthan and Joel Coen / Christopher Nolan – 320\n\nTop 10 Nighthawk Comedy Points:\n\nWoody Allen – 1160\n\nBilly Wilder – 760\n\nCharlie Chaplin – 520\n\nLuis Buñuel – 520\n\nPreston Sturges – 400\n\nCameron Crowe – 400\n\nI.A.L.

Things haven’t changed among the genres: Drama accounts for 65% of the nominations and 75% of the wins since 2011 (Comedy won the other two). Sci-Fi, which didn’t get its first nomination until 2009 got its second and third (Martian, Arrival). The connection between Adapted and Picture has really diminished. The Century of Film ended with three straight Picture winners without an Adapted nomination and after two films that won both (but not Director), there was a two year gap, another that won both (but not Director) and now three straight years where the Picture winner didn’t earn an Adapted nomination. It’s still stronger with nominations though, with 29 of the 40 nominees since 2011 earning Picture noms. There have only been four films with a single nomination, although three were in 2017, the first time there were three in a single year (Logan, Disaster Artist, Molly’s Game) and the first time there multiple in a year since 1977. No Foreign film has been nominated since 2007. The Director connection has really weakened (only 14 of 40 nominees). Also, the Adapted winners haven’t been winning other things. Five of the eight winners since 2011 won no other Oscar. To get five Adapted winners that won no other Oscars before that you had to go back to 1995. But before that, there had only been 6 films to win Adapted with no other wins in the first 68 years of the Oscars. Adapted once went 26 years without doing that (1938-64) while it’s now done it three years in a row.\n\nTop Oscar Points for the 10s:\n\nAaron Sorkin: 160\n\nTop 10 Oscar Points:\n\nWoody Allen – 720\n\nBilly Wilder – 600\n\nCharles Brackett – 400\n\nJohn Huston – 360\n\nEthan and Joel Coen – 360\n\nBen Hecht – 320\n\nFederico Fellini – 320\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola – 320\n\nJoseph L. Mankiewicz / Carl Foreman – 280\n\nPaddy Chayefsky / Robert Benton / Oliver Stone – 280\n\nGolden Globes: Steve Jobs became the first film since 1971 to win Screenplay without a Picture nomination. Of the four films to win Picture and Screenplay since 2011, notably, three of them were in the Comedy category. Birdman added Fantasy to the list of genres that have won the award. No film has earned a Screenplay nom with no other noms making District 9 the only film since 2001 to do so still.\n\nTop 10 Globes Points:\n\nAaron Sorkin – 360\n\nWoody Allen – 320\n\nQuentin Tarantino – 320\n\nStirling Silliphant – 240\n\nRobert Bolt – 240\n\nOliver Stone – 240\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola – 200\n\nAlexander Payne – 200\n\n13 writers – 160\n\nBAFTA Notes: Since 2011, every winner has been Comedy (3) or Drama (5) with Drama accounting for 27 of the 40 nominations. Best Picture is even more divorced from Adapted Screenplay since 2011 with no film winning both and only two Picture winners even earning a Screenplay nom while three Screenplay winners weren’t even nominated for Picture. Only three films have managed a nomination with no other nominations since 2011 (Beasts of the Southern Wild, Hidden Figures, Molly’s Game) and no Foreign film has been nominated at all.\n\nTop 10 BAFTA Points:\n\nWoody Allen – 720\n\nEthan and Joel Coen – 320\n\nQuentin Tarantino – 280\n\nJean-Claude Carriere – 240\n\nAnthony Minghella – 240\n\nCharlie Kaufman – 240\n\nSteven Zaillian – 200\n\nRuth Prawer Jhabvala – 200\n\nRonald Harwood – 200\n\nAaron Sorkin – 200\n\nBFCA Notes:\n\nTop 5 BFCA Points:\n\nAaron Sorkin – 280\n\nEthan Coen – 280\n\nJoel Coen – 280\n\nAlexander Payne – 160\n\nJosh Singer – 160\n\nWGA Notes: I’ve already covered above the problems with the WGA lately. It’s a quandary each year trying to decide how the WGA affects Oscar predictions based on what films are simply ineligible (in 2019, Once Upon a Time), which are snubbed (in 2019, the initial thought on Two Popes) and which just have category confusion (in 2019, the final thought on Two Popes which apparently the WGA considered original).\n\nTop 10 WGA Points:\n\nWoody Allen – 1000\n\nBilly Wilder – 800\n\nErnest Lehman – 560\n\nI.A.L. Diamond – 480\n\nNeil Simon – 480\n\nFrances Goodrich – 440\n\nAlbert Hackett – 440\n\nRobert Benton – 440\n\nJohn Huston – 400\n\n8 writers – 360\n\nCritics Notes: Before Midnight became the first Adapted film to win multiple critics awards for Screenplay but no other awards.\n\nThe Nighthawk Winners:\n\n2012: Lincoln (Oscar, WGA, Globe, BAFTA, BFCA, NYFC, NSFC, BSFC, CFC)\n\n2013: Wolf of Wall Street (Oscar, WGA, BAFTA, BFCA, NBR)\n\n2014: The Imitation Game (Oscar, WGA, Globe, BAFTA, BFCA)\n\n2015: Carol (Oscar, WGA, BAFTA, NYFC)\n\n2016: Arrival (Oscar, WGA, BAFTA, BFCA)\n\n2017: Call Me By Your Name (Oscar, WGA, BAFTA, BFCA, CFC)\n\n2018: If Beale Street Could Talk (Oscar, WGA, Globe, BAFTA, BFCA, CFC, NBR)\n\n2019: Little Women (Oscar, WGA, BAFTA, BFCA, CFC)\n\nChart / Consensus Notes:"
