The police question cooking-obsessed Song-Hee (Eun-jin Bang) in Apt. 301, who consults her cooking diary to verify that her last meal with Yoon Hee was Soup with Mushroom Sauce. Well, not exactly.

About Schmidt (2002),\n\nDir., Alexander Payne There he is, flat on his back with a crooked neck after losing a bedtime battle with a water bed: Warren R.

Early in the movie, a crate of small turtles (NOT sea turtles) is shown making its way to a kitchen). Alice Adams (1935),\n\nDir. George Stevens Poor Alice (Katherine Hepburn) is no match for her small town's Swell Set. We first see her poor ailing father in bed, fed impatiently by his unsympathetic wife: \"Why Virgil, you're not eating your soup. Don't want to? Oh but you must eat it. You must to get your strength back. You've got to get good and strong so you can smile all around and get around again.\" Then we see Alice trying to impress Arthur (Fred McMurray) with a formal dinner prepared by hired maid Malena (Hattie McDaniels) on a VERY hot night. It's a disaster, just as Hattie predicted. \"What a lack of imagination to prepare anything so hot on a night like this. Please take this dreadful soup away,\" Kate expostulates. Thanks to Bev McMullen for the cite. Amarcord (1973),\n\nDir., Federico Fellini In this family memoir, Fellini shows Zanin and his family arguing around the kitchen table. When Uncle Orfei chugs wine straight out of the bottle, Dad says \"No drinking before the soup!\" But when soup is served, the arguments just intensify.

Ethan Krusemark (Stocker Fontelieu) tries to help him out:\n\nEK: Hey, let's walk over here. It's a little private and you can sample our gumbo.\n\nHA: That's okay, I've got an acid stomach. That Cajun cooking kills me.\n\nEK: Pity about your stomach; you'd have enjoyed our gumbo.\n\nAnd Harry tosses a live crab into the huge boiling vat as he walks in for the promised heart to heart. Moments later, we find Ethan immersed headfirst in the pot, dead as a doornail.\n\nThen too there's Epiphany Proudfoot (Lisa Bonet), also fated to meet a bad end, defending her voodoo practices: \"Oh, yeah, I know. You gotta kill the chicken to make the soup.\"\n\nThanks to Anon. for the contribution!\n\nAnimal House (1978),\n\nDir., John Landis It was 1962. Delta Tao Chi House of Faber College had selected its pledges. Dean Wormer (John Vernon) was not happy with Delta activities--and placed it on the dreaded double-secret probation. That was just about the time that Flounder (Steve Furst) ran afoul of Neidermeyer (Mark Metcalf), his commanding officer at ROTC, for wearing his Delta pledge pin on his uniform. Enter Boon (Peter Riegert) and Otter (Tim Matheson), who retaliated by hitting golf balls at Neidermeyer. Oops. What a hook: lands right in the soup kettle in the school cafeteria kitchen. ...Much later, we find John 'Bluto' Blutarksy (John Belushi) cruising the garbage trays in that same cafeteria. Hey, there's a bowl of soup (watery beef onion?) with a golf ball in it. Mmmmmmmm. He picks out the golf ball and eats it in 3 bites.\n\nMany thanks to John Fox, historian and master archivist, for the contribution.\n\nAnother Day in Paradise (1998),\n\nDir., Larry Clark Junkie and crook Sid (Melanie Griffith) ministers to a couple of druggie young kids in this gritty, anti-hero road movie, saying: \"Don't let the fact that I'm spooning chicken soup into you blind you to the fact that I'm far from a role model.\" Around the World in 80 Days (1956),\n\nDir., Michael Anderson Phileas Fogg advises a server on his ship to Bombay, , \"My Thursday noon meal has always been, and always will be hot soup, . . .\" Thanks to Trevor McMullen for the cite. Arsenic and Old Lace (1944),\n\nDir., Frank Capra Mortimer Brewster's (Cary Grant's) Aunts Abby and Martha have taken quite a shine to bumping off old men with, per gallon of elderberry wine, a teaspoon of arsenic, half a teaspoon of strychnine, and just a pinch of cyanide. That doesn't prevent them from mothering the rest of Brooklyn:\n\nAbby: How's Missus Brophy?\n\nOfficer Brophy: Oh she's better, thank you, but, uh, a little weak still.\n\nAbby: Oh, well I'll go and get a little beef broth for you to take to her.\n\nOfficer Brophy: Oh, Miss Abby, please don't bother. You've done so much already.\n\nAbby: Oh, stuff and nonsense. I won't be a minute. As Good As It Gets (1997),\n\nDir., James L. Brooks When Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson), the meanest man in the world, begins to thaw in the company of Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt), he starts by babysitting the dog of neighbor Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear), who has been brutally beaten. When he then actually brings Simon a bowl of soup, Simon can only focus on his own depression instead of on the fact that gay-bashing, curmudgeonly Melvin is now actively comforting him. As Young As You Feel (1951),\n\nDir. Harmon Jones In this comedy of John Holdges (Montey Wooley), forced into retirement then saving a company from bankrupcy under false pretences, Thelma Ritter (Della Hodges) comments on the dire financial situation with the remark (can't you just hear her say it?) \"With the price of soup bones going up....\" Thanks to the king of soup spotters, Steve McMullen--who gives this 3Â½ soup tureens out of 5. Babette's Feast (1987),\n\nDir., Gabriel Axel Turtle soup kicks off the greatest meal these simple Jutlanders ever dreamed of eating. The movie opens with Martina and Filippa, Danish puritan sisters, taking the poor and sick villagers bowls of good soup. Only later do we find out why that soup is so good: it's been prepared by one of the great chefs of the world, transplanted to Jutland after a brutal French uprising in 1871. When this chef unexpectedly wins the lottery, years later, she spends every sou creating a 5-star meal in honor of Martina and Filippa's deceased pastor father, including this turtle soup. Happily, a famous Danish general is present at the meal who has the discrimination to say:\n\n\"Quite definitely, this is a genuine turtle soup. It is truly the best turtle soup I've had in years.\"\n\nThe Ballad of Josie (1967),\n\nDir., Andrew V. McLaglen What was that soup that Jason (Peter Graves) eats while ogling sheep rancher Josie (Doris Day) at the Wyoming men's political dinner? (Thanks to Bev McMullen for the cite!)

Batman (1989),\n\nDir., Tim Burton Batman (Michael Keaton) invites Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) to dinner at the Bat Mansion in the formal dining room. The following conversation ensues: He says, \"How's the soup?\" She says, \"Excuse me?\" He says, \"The soup, how is it?\" She says, \"Great.\" She says, \"Could you pass the salt?\" \"Sure,\" he says, \"Did you have a hard time finding the house?\" \"Oh no, not at all,\" she says. \"Good,\" he says. She says, \"Do you like eating in here?\" He says, \"Oh yeah. ...Do you want to know the truth? I don't think I've ever been in this room before. Do you want to get out of here?\" \"Yes,\" she says. And they pick up their flat soup bowls and spoons and join Alfred in the kitchen. Batman Returns (1992),\n\nDir., Tim Burton Alfred (Michael Gough) serves vichyssoise to Batman (Michael Keaton) who is at work in front of his computer...and who immediately complains that the soup is cold. Beauty and the Beast (1991),\n\nDirs., Gary Trousdale, Kirk Wise In the Disney Animated Film Beauty and the Beast, in the scene where they are both eating lunch together, the Beast had a hard time drinking the soup with a spoon until Belle shows him to drink it directly from the plate and so they do together. (Thanks to John Beauchamp of Miami, Florida, for the contribution!)\n\nAnother opinion from Katie in Manchester, UK: \"I would just like to point out that in Disney's \"Beauty and the Beast\" the soup you refer to is in fact porridge. You will notice its lumpy consistency and the fact that they add sugar and mile to it to make it easy to drink.\" And, of course, she's right. Never mind that porridge has evolved from the soup category in modern times. Behave Yourself (1951),\n\nDir., George Beck Farley Granger (Bill Denny) has a problem: he's found a dog with a criminal past. When he tries to get rid of it by pawning it at a pet store, the wife of the shopkeeper comes around the corner and yells: \"Your soup is gettin' cold . . . like ice.\" The pet shop owner responds: \"So its gettin' cold.\" (Thanks to Beverly McMullen for the cite!)

The Bicycle Thief (1949),\n\nDir., Vittorio DeSica In their desperate sojourn to recover a bicycle, Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) and son Bruno (Enzo Staiola) stumble into a church-run soup kitchen where the poor and homeless customers are literally locked into a chapel to ensure that they hear Mass before being fed. Billy Madison (1995),\n\nDir., Tamra Davis Dopey Billy (Adam Sandler) must repeat elementary, middle, and high school grades, in 2-week increments, to not be cut out of his father's billion dollar hotel business. Along the way, he shows us how to slurp soup as an art form. Thanks to Graham Bierlein for the contribution. He comments, \"Nobody else seems to enjoy their soup as much as he does. If you own the DVD, the slurping is a lot funnier in Spanish.\" The Birdcage (1996),\n\nDir., Mike Nichols Gay couple Armand (Robin Williams) and Arnold (Nathan Lane) Goldman are putting on their best straight act to entertain the parents of son Val's fiancee--the arch conservative Senator (Gene Hackman) and Mrs. (Dianne Wiest) Kevin Keeley. What better than a nice dinner? So Agador (Hank Azaria) whips up a little so-called \"Guatamalan Seafood Chowder,\" with whole hardboiled eggs in it--serving it up in pornographic Greek boy soupbowls--and no entree. \"No entree? NO ENTREE?\" \"Thees peasant soup IS an entree...it just LIKE a soup. What you think?

Bowery at Midnight (1942),\n\nDirs., Wallace Fox In this \"poverty row\" cult classic, Dr. Brenner (Bela Lugosi) is, by day, a professor of psychology. By night, he appears to be Karl Wagner, a sweet soul with a soft touch who runs a nightly Bowery mission, spooning out bowls of soup for needy tramps with nowhere to go--but, in reality he is a fiendish criminal, using his soup kitchen as a front for a criminal gang that commits robberies for him...only to be killed by him for their troubles. Surprise ending: when the law catches up to him and chases him back into the soup kitchen, his mad doctor co-conspirator (Lew Kelly) leads him to a secret basement where all his murdered associates--now brought back to life by Doc Brooks--are waiting for him.... Opening dialogue of bums in The Friendly Mission:\n\n1st bum: \"See the guy [Bela Lugosi] handing out the soup? He's the guy that runs the place. I'll give you a poisonal introduction....\"\n\nLugosi: \"Good evening. I see you brought your needy friend with you tonight.\"\n\n1st bum: \"Yeah, he's a pedestrian from Pittsburgh.\"\n\nLugosi: \"You're very welcome, my friend. Here you'll find food for your body as well as comfort for your troubled mind.\"\n\n2nd bum: \"Yeah, but can I have some soup?\"\n\nLugosi: \"Of course, my friend. What happened to your hand?\"\n\n2nd bum: \"Oh, it's nothing. I just hurt it a little bit.\"\n\nLugosi: \"Oh, but just the same, you better take care of it. Miss Minerva, there's a patient for you.\"\n\n2nd bum: \"Yeah, but what about the soup?\"\n\nLugosi: \"Never mind, there's plenty of soup here.\"\n\nThanks and a hug to Art Meyer for the contribution.

Coping by pouring their energies and money into the upcoming band competition, two band members are severely dressed down by two women in the town. As they walk off, one says to the other, \"Soup for brains, the pair of them.\" (Thanks to Steve McMullen for the contribution, gleaned on vacation in Edinburgh, Scotland) The Bride Wore Red (1937),\n\nDir., Dorothy Arzner Gold digger \"Anni\" (Joan Crawford) has set her cap for rich Rudi (Robert Young) and celebrates their engagement at a tense dinner where Rudi's former fiancee chooses the menu. Contessa (Billie Burke) breaks the tension: \"Isn't this onion soup good?\" \"My favorite in all the world,\" agrees Rudi. (Thanks to Bev McMullen for the cite) Bridget Jones' Diary (2001),\n\nDir., Sharon McGuire At her first formal dinner party, Bridget (RenÃ©e Zellweger) creates a sensation when she produces peacock blue leek soup...thanks to tying the leeks with blue yarn before popping them in the pot. Brokedown Palace (1999),\n\nDir., Jonathan Kaplan Poor Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) get set up in Thailand, caught with some kilos of heroine in their luggage, and end up sentenced to 40 years in a perfectly dreadful prison...with only scummy rotten soup to sustain them. Bruce Almighty (2003),\n\nDir., Bruce Shadyac Infantile tv reporter Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is unexpectedly visited by God (Morgan Freeman) at a point in his life when he's pretty frustrated.

Bueno Vista Social Club (1999),\n\nDir., Wim Wenders Compay Segundo, Cuban musician extraordinaire, opens this documentary in 1998 Havana, looking for his old neighborhood music and dance club. As people in the street try to help the 90-year-old tres player, he stops to ask the cameraman: \"You know what I eat when I drink too much? Black coquetero soup. Consomme, chicken consomme.

When a gangland war begins, fought with cream pies against a higher tech machine gun that shoots marshmallows, Bugsy goes to a soup kitchen to enlist homeless guys in the fight. It's all heart, seeing soup being ladled into bowls and guys sitting at a table slurping it while Bugsy (lip-syncing a song) tries to convince them to help him smash Dandy Dan. This classic is a fave of Steve McMullen, who saw it in the theater with his girlfriend, soon to become his wife. Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell (1968),\n\nDir., Melvin Frank It's a great scam: Italian beauty Carla Campbell (Gina Lollabrigida) gets romanced by three G.I.'s during World War II--then has each of them pay alimony for the daughter they think is their own...until they all show up to visit their long lost daughter. How did unwed Carla pick her married last name? From a can of Campbell's soup she found on the shelf.\n\nMany thanks to S. Best in Brampton, Ontario, for the contribution. Butterfly Tongues (2000), or La lengua de las mariposas/A lingua das bolboretas in 1999,\n\nDir., JosÃ© Luis Cuerda In this shattered memoir of 1936 Spain on the brink of civil war, soup operates as a symbol of family tranquillity: first, boiling over on the stove when Moncho (Manuel Lozano) argues with his mother (Uxia Blanco) over the existence of God and the devil; second, served from a tureen as a sacrament of family life--the traditional Galician soup with pork and lots of cabbage; and third, offered to Don Gregorio (Fernando FernÃ¡n GÃ³mez) as a restorative after he wades into a river with Moncho to save him from a dangerous asthma attack. Not that such friendship saves the good professor from being carted off at the end to be shot as a Red. Caddyshack (1980),\n\nDir., Harold Ramis In this over-the-top comedy, Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) diplomatically comments to Judge Smalls (Ted Knight), \"Oh, this is the worst-looking hat I ever saw. What, when you buy a hat like this I bet you get a free bowl of soup, huh? Oh, it looks good on you though.\" Cat People (1982),\n\nDir., Paul Schrader It's an ominous start to a feline gothic tale when Irena (Nastassja Kinski) comes to New Orleans to meet her mysterious older brother Paul (Malcolm McDowell). Turns out they're from an ancient cat-god race and can only mate with each other without turning into killer panthers. Paul has been marking time, chaining himself in cages and turning to religion, with only the occasional kill. Now it's the big moment. Voodoo-looking Female (Ruby Dee) presides at the dinner table. Paul says the blessing and they cross themselves--then Female serves the soup. \"Hmmmmmmmm,\" Paul says. \"Watch out. This is hot,\" Female says. Irena tries to break away and make a phonecall. \"Well, sit down now, then, you can call after dinner,\" Paul insists. \"This is Female's Special Gumbo. Special Gumbo tonight from yeseterday's chicken,\" Paul says ominously. \"Right, right,\" says Female.\n\nMany thanks to movie meister Gerry Nepomuceno, who not only suggested it, but also told me where I could rent it.\n\nLe Cavaleur (1979),\n\nDir., Phillippe de Broca Edouard Choiseul (Jean Rochefort), concert pianist and aging fast, finally burns through all the wives and mistresses in his life and finds himself alone with his music and one small student in remote Ploumarech. Enter daughter Pompom with news of her pregnancy. In the film's climactic moment, he leaps up, alive again, shouting, \"How about that! Andre, I'm a grandfather! Good, good. I'll grow a beard and wear a velvet bathrobe. Your (Pompon's) kids on my left, your sisters on my right, me in the middle serving soup--and there I'll stay!\" Charlotte Gray (2002),\n\nDir., Gillian Armstrong Such a bitter relationship between cantankarous father Levade (Michael Gambon) and his communist son Julien (Billy Crudup), who is risking all in the resistance in German-occupied France. They briefly reconcile before Levade is carried away to a concentration camp: Sit down, says Levade, serving up soup from the fireplace kettle. It's still warm. It's important to eat. A Chef in Love (1996), or Les mille et une recettes du cuisinier amoureux,\n\nDir., Nana Dzhordzhadze It's Tbilisi, Georgia, in the 1920s and soviet comrade Zigmund (Timur Kamkhadze) is finally able to force his beloved Princess Cecilia Abachidze (Nino Kirtadze) out of the house of great chef Pascal Ichak (Pierre Richard). Ah, but not out of his bed nor arms. Coming home one day, Zigmund hears them at it through the bedroom door. That's when, resonating on many different levels, he fetches a big pot of soup and gobbles it up in big spoonsful as he strides back and forth in front of that door, listening raptly to the sounds of pleasure just out of his reach. Cleopatra (1963),\n\nDir., Joseph Mankiewicz In this stunning epic, which launched the scandalous romance of Liz and Dick, Roddy McDowell takes on Octavius' wooden dignity following the death of Richard Burton's character, saying \"Antony is dead? You say that as if it were an everyday occurence. The soup is hot, the soup is cold. Antony is alive, Antony is dead.\" A Clockwork Orange (1971),\n\nDir., Stanley Kubrick In the making of this shattering political allegory, based on the novel by Anthony Burgess, Malcolm McDowell endured Kubrick's outrageous demands for perfection, nearly drowning after his face was pushed into a saucepan of soup and Kubrick refused to shout \"cut!\" Clue (1985)\n\nDir., Jonathan Lynn In this silly knock off of a Milton-Bradley board game, the usual suspects gather at the mansion. Butler Wadsworth (Tim Curry) ushers them into the dining room. Cook (Kellye Nakahara) serves sharkfin soup as the first course. Professor Plum (Christopher Lloyd) slurps, then Miss White (Madaeline Kahn). Miss Peacock (Eileen Brennan) takes charge, stopping everyone \"dead\" with a long soliloquy ending in \"...and, oh my, this soup's delicious, isn't it?\" That's right before the monkey brain course...and all the murders. Thanks to Graham Bierlein for the contribution. Cold Comfort Farm (1995),\n\nDir., John Schlesinger CORRECTION: Thanks to the sharp ears and excellent research of Heather McKay in North Melbourne, Australia, this soup reference has been entirely discredited. \"Sukebind\" is the correct reference, apparently a neologism made up by CCFarm author Stella Gibbons from \"honeysuckle\" and \"bindweed\" to signify a weed whose annual blossoming portends fertility, passion, and fruitfulness.\n\nThis one is pretty obscure, but attested to by some of the most rigorous contributors to Soup Goes to the Movies, Bev and Steve McMullen: \"When Flora's (Kate Beckinsale's) cousin Elfine (Maria Miles) announces her marriage to a rich local young man, (which Flora helped engineer), the farmhand shouts that she was promised to him. He is dissuaded and he grabs the maids assistant (who he has fathered three children by) and throws her over his shoulder and heads out the door. The cook says \"... there will be another one when the soup vine blooms.\" A minute later there is a shot of a blooming vine on a fence. We are sure she said soup vine. We listened to it three times, but dialects are in play here.\"\n\nCold Dog Soup (1990),\n\nDir., Alan Metter Michael (Frank Whaley) and taxidriving Jack Cloud (Randy Quaid) try to get rid of Michael's hot date's dead dog (an overdose of olives and margaritas) so Michael can get back to a hoped-for night of pleasure. When they hopefully stop at a Chinese restaurant, Madame Chang (Nancy Kwan) says that Jasper has been dead too long to make \"cold dog soup\" even if you add watercress, white pepper and a few scallions. She adds, \"I can't serve stiff dog. It's not fair to my customers.\" Corpse Bride (2005),\n\nDir., Tim Burton I recognize that voice: it's Albert Finney as father of the non-Corpse Bride exclaiming, \"There's an eye my soup.\" The Courtship of Eddie's Father (1963),\n\nDir., Vincent Minnelli Tom Corbett (Glenn Ford) loses a wife, can't find a new one to suit him and son (Ron Howard), so he hires a maid, Mrs. Livingston (Roberta Sherwood), for the domestic chores. What does she do? Plays Spanish language records, reciting \"La sopa...la sopa....\" Thanks to Steve McMullen for the sighting! Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon(2000)\n\nDir., Ang Lee Tea rituals are everywhere in this dreamy epic, but a soup worthy of Master Chef Chu--in Lee's earlier Eat Drink Man Woman--is revealed in an early scene when the policeman Tsai's knuckles are rapped and he is told to wait until the master serves himself first. And then, wait, that was Shark Fin Soup that Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang) ordered at the inn, right before she destroyed the joint and all the guys in it. Crush(2001)\n\nDir., John McKay 25-year-old Jed (Kenny Doughty) endears himself to his former teacher Kate (Andie McDowell) with his snakeskin cowboy boots and his gauche soup slurping.

W. Pabst In this wrenching silent film melodrama, Thymiane (Louise Brooks) is raped, forced to give up the resulting child, and sent to a brutal reform school where in one very long scene all the bad girls are eating their soup at a long table in rigid synchonization. The soup--all the girls are given to eat--is a disgusting thick black goo served in thick wooden bowls. When Thymiane escapes both the school and her later life in prostitution to be adopted by a German count, she returns to the school as part of its aristocratic board...and exposes its horrors when one of the board members shows her delicate turtle soup in an exquisite porcelain cup, saying \"Wonderful--you must taste the delicious soup they make here.\" Dinner at Eight (1933),\n\nDir., George Cukor Carlotta (Marie Dressler) intrudes early on her hosts the Jordans (Lionel Barrymore and Billie Burke). \"I had a wonderful lunch, with four lawyers,\" she says sarcastically. \"I was on the 88th floor you know, the Sky Club. A cloud floated by right into my soup plate.\" Thanks to Bev McMullen for the cite! Dinner for One (1963),\n\nDir., Heinz Dunkhase Aged Miss Sophie (May Warden) enjoys her annual birthday celebration with long-dead friends, all played by James the butler (Freddie Frinton), who faithfully serves mulligatawny soup each year. \"Little drop of soup, Miss Sophie?\" \"I am particularly fond of mulligatawny soup, James...I think we'll have sherry with the soup.\" \"Sherry with the soup? yes...oh, by the way, the same procedure as last year, Miss Sophie?\" \"Same procedure as every year, James.\" This 17-minute film has become a cult classic in Germany on New Year's Eve, watched by some 13 million Germans. Domestic Disturbance (2001),\n\nDir., Harold Becker Bad guy Ray Coleman (Steve Buscemi) confronts just as bad guy Rick Barnes (Vince Vaughan) at his wedding: \"Did you register for a soup tureen? That's what I woulda gotten you...if I'd been invited.\" Door to Door (2002),\n\nDir., Steven Schachter CP-victim Bill Porter carves out a niche as a door-to-door salesman, only to see his livelihood dry up as demographics shift.

Sharp words escalate into furious ANGER which leads to violent fighting and torrents of soup flowing down the stairs of the apartment house, which ultimately burns to the ground.
