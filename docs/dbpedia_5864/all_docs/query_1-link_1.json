        "text": "Seabiscuit an American racehorse who turned into a legend had two different forms of entertainment created after him. The first one was a book it was called Seabiscuit: An American Legend it was written by Laura Hillenbrand. The second was a movie created on July 25, 2003. Both forms of entertainment were similar and at the same time highlighted on different forms (change better wording).\n\nThe Braddock family faced economic hardships during the great depression. In the Cinderella Man movie, the man cut off the power because they weren’t paying the electric bills. Another scene was when they were eating baloneys to survive and Mr. Braddock hands the little girl his baloney. This depicted their economic hardships and inability to buy sufficient food for the family. The reason for the economic hardship was clear. During his conversation in the bar after working on the docks, Mr. Braddock tells his friend that he even invested his money on a taxi.\n\nCinderella Man came out in the year 2005, it is a non fiction movie directed by Ron Howard. It is based on the story of a boxer during the Depression, James J. Braddock. Braddock had to over come many adversities such as the economical and societal conditions. Another adversity he had to overcome was living in the Depression and all the things that go along with that. Braddock’s character traits shown in the movie are all important and appropriate due to the harshness of those times.\n\nDuring times of need, one seeks comfort from the world around them as it rages on inside and out, corrupting everything in sight. War expressed in both the books, The Great Gatsby and Seabiscuit are similar in that they offer two different insights of fighting physical and mental wars; manifesting internally, in their settings, and on the people around them. War takes many shapes and is dealt in more than one way. How you deal with it, is what matters.\n\nThe film Cinderella Man is based on a true story of an Irish-American boxer. During The Great Depression, ex-boxer due to an injury James J. Braddock (Russell Crowe) works as a day labourer until his former manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) offers him a one time fight against a young rising boxer. After Jim had a shocking win he goes back to boxing full time despite his concerned wife Mae Braddock (Renée Zellweger). Nicknamed “The Cinderella Man” for his rags to riches story, Jim is set out to fight the defending champion, the menacing Max Baer. This film is a historically accurate representation of what people had to go through during The Great Depression and shows this with the obstacles that were overcome.\n\nThe Great Depression took place in the United States in the 1930s. Northern California, Salinas Valley was affected by the Great Depression. Many farmers lost their properties and were forced to find other work. Banks were forced to foreclose on mortgages’ and had to collect debts. Hundreds of thousands of farmers packed up their families and few belongings, and headed for California. The Great Depression left many people in poverty and caused them to face unpleasant events. This is how life was like for the characters in Steinbeck’s novel Of Mice and Men. Mostly all the characters in this novel suffered from loneliness. Some of the men desired to come together in a way that would allow them to be like brothers to one\n\nCinderella Man is a famous, nonfiction film that was directed by Ron Howard and produced in 2005. The timing of the production of this film can strike as interesting, and maybe even odd; this is because the film begins in the times of the roaring 20’s, when the United States experienced a peak in economic successes. However, the 20’s is not the only developed time period, rather, it is the 30’s that most of the action in the film protagonists’ story will take place. Jim Braddock, a well known, wealthy, married man takes the lead position to show audiences the first-hand impact that the Great Depression had on families of all backgrounds. Braddock's riches-to-rags-to-riches story has inspired the value behind family and hard work and brought hope to his neighbors and fans who found themselves also struggling to find work and pay their bills during one of the greatest the economic downturns in history.\n\nIn 1929, tears swept the nation and gloom bestowed itself upon a once happy place. The Great Depression had started. People lost everything ,so many became migrant workers. Of Mice and Men, a classic novel written by John Steinbeck, emphasizes many sad themes, but gives us a good insight on what life was like in the 1940’s for many people. Although there are other themes, rootlessness, loneliness, and poverty are extremely prominent throughout the novel in many characters.\n\nCinderella Man is a flim based on the rise of World Championship boxer James Braddock. Braddock's life was affected heavily by the great depression, and the film does well to show this. The film also does a good job of chronicling the life of the everyday man during the great depression. This essay aims to discuss the role of the stock market crash in the beginning of the great depression, the effects of the depression on the life of the everyday man, and the effects of the depression on the life of James J Braddock and his family.\n\nThe two stories of “Cinderella” are “Tam and Cam”; and “The twelve Months: A Slav legend adapted by Alexander Chodzko. These stories have similar ways in portraying the hard working Cinderella including her suffering, but they are different in Cinderella’s motive of rescue one tale use violence if necessary; the other just more of a genuine resourceful approach. This means this character isn’t relying on a prince charming to be her rescue, so this makes the concept different from the other because “Tam and Cam” Cinderella lives forever happy with her lover, while “The twelve Months: A Slav legend adapted lives by herself and then a farmer she likes shows up. These tales went for a more sophisticated setting, each displaying the peasant overcoming the struggle; in which she is set free from all of her hurting. Throughout each story Cinderella is taking and caring she always seemed to get the short end of the stick. But, when the odds back fired on the step-sisters and step-mother the karma was naturally set upon to benefit Cinderella in her favor “Tam and Cam” or set in motion by her as payback to get even with her rival characters of a family in “The twelve Months: A Slav legend adapted lives.\n\n“What goes around comes around, that’s what people say. So all the pain you caused me will come back to you someday” (Unknown.) The theme of “what goes around comes around” is exemplified in both the Grimm version and the Disney version of Cinderella, however the Grimm version definitely exemplifies the theme more effectively than the Disney version does.\n\nFrom black people to white people, to the old and the young, almost every person was discriminated against in some way during the depression and even today. Steinbeck’s novel Of Mice and Men takes place during the Great Depression, 1940s era and describes a very realistic situation about characters who are simply trying to get by and chasing the “American Dream” but struggles with conflict within themselves and the outside world. Discrimination was a common theme of Of Mice and Men and greatly affected the lives of the characters in the novella. Some characters include: Crooks, Curley’s wife, and Candy. The novella is a realistic representation of discrimination in society.\n\nThe story Of Mice and Men took place during the 1930’s. That time period was very different from today. Race and gender were very important characteristics that determined whether a person had the opportunity to make money. The 1930’s were also a time where people started questioning life and the American culture. Many people like John Steinbeck thought that life was very unfair and questioned whether if life was even worth living. In Of Mice and Men John Steinbeck demonstrates that mans dream is destined to be destroyed by a cruel reality."
