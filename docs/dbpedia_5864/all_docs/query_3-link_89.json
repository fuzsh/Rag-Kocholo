It has since been updated.\n\nAs the 2024 Kentucky Derby prepares for its annual run at Churchill Downs, it’s worth looking back on the best movies about horse racing.\n\nWhile the world of horse racing might not be as mined for cinematic storytelling as, say, football or basketball, there are still some good movies out there that deal with racing horses and the jockeys who ride them.\n\nSome of these stories are ripped right out of the history books, while others take real-life elements to add weight to fictional stories.\n\nWe’ve compiled our five favorite movies that deal with horse racing, and we think they’d make for great viewings around this year’s Kentucky Derby."
