She established herself as a notable dramatic actress on Broadway over several years, winning a Tony Award in 1954 for her skill in a difficult role, playing an unsympathetic, even abusive character, in Horton Foote's \"The Trip to Bountiful\" with Lillian Gish and Eva Marie Saint. Her first film role was playing the estranged mother of James Dean's character in Jenseits von Eden (1955). This debut performance earned Van Fleet an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.
