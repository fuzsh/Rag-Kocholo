        "text": "If the weather and course conditions cooperate, Saturday will be one of the busiest days for top-level turf stakes. It will be one that goes a long way toward shaping championship campaigns the rest of this year.\n\nThe Grade 1 Arlington Million will anchor the card at Colonial Downs in Virginia where the feature may yield a Breeders’ Cup candidate or two, and the Beverly D. (G2) will be an automatic qualifier for the Filly & Mare Turf.\n\nStakes Tracker: This is where to get a 2nd look.\n\nThe Fourstardave (G1), a win-and-you’re-in for the Breeders’ Cup Mile, is the feature on a reconfigured Saratoga card that picked up two turf stakes pushed back a week because of rain.\n\nEllis Park and Emerald Downs host their biggest days of the summer come Sunday. But it is a track in the gateway to Canada’s west where the first of this week’s noteworthy stakes will be run Monday.\n\nMonday\n\nManitoba Derby, Assiniboia Downs, 1 1/8 miles, 3-year-olds\n\nAwesome Road will be on his third trainer in as many races. A debut victor last summer for Brad Cox at Ellis Park, the $600,000 colt has gone winless in six races since. After being handled by Robertino Diodoro for a fifth-place finish May 27 in the Texas Derby, the son of Quality Road was transferred to Rick Wise and was made the 7-5 morning-line favorite for the year’s biggest horse race in Winnipeg. Last year’s renewal was part of the inaugural version of what has been renamed the Western Canadian Derby Series. It was removed this year because of a government anemia quarantine of Assiniboia Downs, leaving only the Aug. 24 Canadian Derby (G3) at Century Mile and the Sept. 14 B.C. Derby (G3) at Hastings.\n\n2024 Manitoba Derby LS\n\nPost Silks Horse / Sire Rating Trainer / Jockey Last Start / Next Start HRN 1 Magnolia Speed\n\nClearly Now 0.00 Lee Delaronde\n\nDane Dawkins 3rd, Derby Trial S. 30-1 Last Race 3rd, Derby Trial S. 2 Lucky Appeal\n\nBreaking Lucky 0.00 Lee Delaronde\n\nArthur Budhu 4th, Derby Trial S. 50-1 Last Race 4th, Derby Trial S. 3 Bricklayer\n\nAlways Dreaming 0.00 Larry Gourneau\n\nLuis A.

The Godolphin homebred made up six places going 1 3/16 miles that day at Saratoga, and he is stretching back to a distance at which he has won six times in eight starts. In U.S. races this year, Nations Pride’s trainer Charlie Appleby is 32: 11-7-6, most recently winning Friday with Cinderella’s Dream in the Saratoga Oaks (G2). This will be the smallest-ever field for the Million, which began in 1981 in Chicagoland. Chad Brown, who holds the record with four training victories in the race, will miss the Million for the first time since 2012.\n\n2024 Arlington Million G1\n\nBeverly D. (G2), Colonial Downs, 1 3/16 miles (turf), fillies and mares, 3-year-olds and up, Breeders’ Cup Filly & Mare Turf automatic qualifier\n\nFev Rover defeated four rivals last year in Colonial’s first hosting of the Beverly D. Now 6, the Ireland-bred mare by Gutaifan will try to win it again, this time against five other starters. The millionaire owned by Tracy Farmer and trained by Mark Casse was a beaten odds-on favorite in her last start, finishing a troubled second in a rainy, one-mile Nassau (G2) on June 29 at Woodbine. Canada’s 2022 horse of the year Moira comes into the Beverly D. off her second-place finish July 13 in the Diana (G1) at Saratoga.\n\n2024 Beverly D. Stakes G1\n\nSecretariat (G2), Colonial Downs, 1 mile (turf), 3-year-olds\n\nThe winner of last month’s 1 3/16-mile Belmont Derby Invitational (G1) at Aqueduct, Trikari may revert to one mile Saturday for the Secretariat, which drew nine 3-year-olds. However, he was one of the three colts cross-entered in this race and the Saratoga Derby Invitational (G1), which was pushed back a week because of rain. Connections for Trikari, First World War and Fulmineo are expected to wait out iffy weather forecasts before making a decision on where to go.\n\n2024 Secretariat Stakes G2\n\nFourstardave (G1), Saratoga, 1 mile (turf), 3-year-olds and up, Breeders’ Cup Mile automatic qualifier\n\nIn a battle of recent graded-stakes winners, Appleby goes with the 5-year-old Ottoman Fleet against Brown, who counters with 4-year-old Carl Spackler. Ottoman Fleet also sports back-to-back graded-stakes triumphs, including the Wise Dan (G2) on June 29 at Churchill Downs. This handicap is one of the few Saratoga turf stakes that Brown has not won. Carl Spackler rolls in for him off last month’s narrow victory in the Kelso (G3) over the same course and distance.\n\n2024 Fourstardave G1\n\nSaratoga Derby Invitational (G1), Saratoga, 1 3/16 miles (turf), 3-year-olds\n\nThis race, which was redrawn after rain pushed it back a week, opened up when top two morning-line choices Diego Velázquez, who went back to Europe, and Cugino, who was reported to have a fever, were not re-entered. Appleby is coming back in with Legend of Time, the Pennine Ridge (G2) winner who finished a close third last month in the Belmont Derby. Carson’s Run was a stakes winner last out at Monmouth Park. If Trikari and Fulmineo stay at Saratoga rather than go to Colonial Downs for the Secretariat, they, too, will come in off stakes victories. First World War also is cross-entered in the two races for 3-year-olds.\n\n2024 Saratoga Derby G1\n\nSaratoga Special (G2), Saratoga, 6 1/2 furlongs, 2-year-olds\n\nKeep It Easy, who cost St. Elias Stable, West Point Thoroughbreds and CJ Thoroughbreds $450,000 at a yearling sale, broke his maiden on second asking by trainer Dale Romans on June 27 at Churchill Downs. His four-length win going six furlongs was worth a 79 Beyer Speed Figure, according to Daily Racing Form. That is the best for any of the juveniles in this field.\n\n2024 Saratoga Special G2\n\nTroy (G2), Saratoga, 5 1/2 furlongs (turf), 4-year-olds and up\n\nEven though this race also was postponed one week and redrawn, the story did not change. Cogburn looks more than ready to defend his 2023 victory in this race while bolstering his case to be a division champion. The 5-year-old millionaire trained by Steve Asmussen is coming off a record-setting performance in the Jaipur (G1) on Belmont Stakes day. He has finished first in five of his last six races and is 3-for-3 at the Troy distance, all since his successful switch from dirt in the spring of 2023.\n\n2024 Troy G2\n\nCanadian (G2), Woodbine, 1 1/8 miles (turf), fillies and mares, 3-year-olds and up\n\nThe Woodbine racing office does not divulge probable starters, but of the 20 nominees, workout cycles suggested Gamely (G1) third-place finisher Forever After All, Gallorette (G3) runner-up Five Towns, Nassau (G2) third- and fourth-place finishers Millie Girl and Full Count Felicia, Modesty (G3) victor Fast as Flight, 2023 Woodbine Oaks winner Elysian Field, Brazil-bred allowance winner For Flying and Sheepshead Bay (G3) runner-up Star Fortress were possibilities to start in this US$144,139 race.\n\n2024 Canadian Stakes C2\n\nYellow Ribbon Handicap (G2), Del Mar, 1 1/16 miles (turf), fillies and mares, 3-year-olds and up\n\nAnisette would be the certain favorite for this race if she were entered. On either side of a five-month break, the 4-year-old Awtaad filly owned by Eclipse Thoroughbred Partners and trained by Leonard Powell won the American Oaks (G1) and the Gamely (G1) in her last two starts. The Del Mar racing office said intentions for its three weekend graded stakes were coming up light, so it actually did not list any probables or possibles for the Yellow Ribbon. Based on workouts, recent results and entries elsewhere, 11 of the 15 nominees looked like they could fit this race into their schedules.\n\n2024 Yellow Ribbon Handicap G2\n\nSorrento (G3), Del Mar, 6 furlongs, 2-year-old fillies\n\nNight Beacon, a $45,000 Spun to Run filly who won her May 10 debut at Santa Anita for trainer Ryan Hanson, was the only nominee who was listed as probable for the Sorrento. The track racing office expected either Nooni or Casalu would be entered by trainer Bob Baffert with the hope that both would start. Each won by open lengths in her five-furlong debut. Nooni got a 78 Beyer for her victory. Vodka With a Twist, who won the $225,000 Debutante Stakes on June 30 at Churchill Downs, would bring a 2-for-3 record into the race if Phil D’Amato sends her.\n\n2024 Sorrento G3\n\nSunday\n\nEllis Park Derby, Ellis Park, 1 mile, 3-year-olds\n\nCatalytic and Who Dey, both of whom felt the glare of the Churchill Downs spotlight during the spring and early summer, will bookend the signature race on the Ellis Park calendar. Catalytic returned from his 19th-place finish in the Kentucky Derby to come in a close second July 5 as the odds-on favorite in the listed Carry Back. Who Dey finished only 1 1/2 lengths behind to take fourth in the Pat Day Mile (G2) before he came in second as the 7-5 favorite June 9 in the Matt Winn (G3).\n\n2024 Ellis Park Derby LS\n\nBest Pal (G3), Del Mar, 6 furlongs, 2-year-olds\n\nGetaway Car, Mischief River and Tiz Happy, all debut winners in their only starts, were the only horses listed by the Del Mar racing office as possible starters. Trained by Bob Baffert, Getaway Car is a Curlin colt who cost the SF Racing partnership $700,000. Bow River Ranch’s Chris Galpin and trainer James Galpin, both known in quarter-horse circles, bought Into Mischief colt Mischief River for $500,000. Calumet Farm homebred Tiz Happy is a Runhappy colt in the Doug O’Neill stable.\n\n2024 Best Pal G3\n\nLongacres Mile, Emerald Downs, 1 mile, 3-year-olds and up\n\nNominations were not due to close until Monday at 3 a.m. EDT for the $150,000 race that began at the old Longacres racetrack in 1935. After three years at Yakima Meadows, the Mile was moved to Emerald Downs in 1996. Entries will be taken Wednesday for this weekend’s race."
