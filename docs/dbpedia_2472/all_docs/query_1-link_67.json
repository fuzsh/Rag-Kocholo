        "text": "JUDITH ASH\n\nDecember 3, 1942 – March 12, 2022\n\nAtlanta Chapter\n\nWith a rich sense of place and purpose, Ms. Judy Ash filled each room she entered with a distinctly powerful yet elegant energy. Her aura was that of a woman who was fortunate enough to know precisely where she’d come from and exactly who she is. Where she was headed, however, was generally a coin toss, and she would embrace any new adventure with open arms.\n\nBorn to Thomas Edward and Julia Parker Young in Pinopolis, SC, she was blessed to have a solid groundwork for her spiritual and personal development. Her mother expanded Judy’s childhood home to make room for Punch ’n Judy Kindergarten, where the focus of the curriculum was music, and Judy’s Shetland pony, Candy, made regular appearances. One of her best childhood friends was Beth Lacey, and the two of them enjoyed exploring the vast area where Lake Moultrie was being built. So much hustle and bustle! Just down the road, the Gills owned a huge horse. Ms. Judy knew that she’d be eternally lucky when she fell from the large equine on her 13th birthday and received 13 stitches on her scalp.\n\nMany summers were spent on her paternal grandfather’s tobacco farm, where each day was orchestrated like a symphony. It was fun and interesting work for a young girl eager to learn, and every day there were at least a dozen people, many cousins and many hands, gathered for a hearty dinner. To balance the tough physical farm labor, Judy’s maternal grandmother was a seamstress who sewed for Ava Gardner, and also crafted a beautiful wardrobe for her granddaughter.\n\nFrom the earliest memories of an idyllic youth, Judy was always encouraged to reach for any goal she might fancy. She took Flamenco dancing lessons in Charleston, captained the basketball team, and cheered for the Berkeley Stags while running school organizations. She toyed with the idea of becoming a detective or a doctor, but her love of travel was calcified when she spent her Converse College Junior year studying abroad in Paris and Rome. Judy had already seen much of America after working in Yellowstone during summer breaks. So, she traveled with three of her classmates Julie Cook and Sally Carr who sailed on the Holland American line from New York City to meet another friend Monies Smith to make the Hotel Lutetia their new home base in Paris. The Carrs had arranged for a case of champagne for the crossing, and absolutely nothing could’ve been finer as the young women savored every moment of that adventure.\n\nAfter leaving college, she embraced an opportunity to live with her maternal grandmother in Miami. In Southern Florida, Judy fell in with a boisterous and worldly crowd. Delta was hiring women to learn their new computer system, and it was there that she learned an important lesson: Machines are only as smart as the people running them. That experience led to an introduction to the flight crews, for which Judy quickly signed up. It was a thrilling time to be a stewardess – first for Delta, and later for Pan American World Airways from the ’60s to the ’80s. She loved all of the stops from Tehran to Tokyo, but her favorite was Hong Kong. Another highlight of that job was being able to assist American soldiers flying out of Saigon for their R&R during Vietnam. Pan Am offered that service for free. It was in the World Wings International group that she continued to foster her loyalty to her Pan Am friends.\n\nIn time, she married the charming Charles (Chuck) Ash from Mahwah, NJ, and they settled in Litchfield, CT. She had a dual career of nurturing a family that includes two sons who now have families of their own, supporting her husband’s marketing career, then building herself another successful career in real estate, Ms. Judy retired to the comfort of her original childhood home on the Pinopolis peninsula, where Candy once roamed. Her myriad of close friends and family kept her busy and active. Each week was a fun and busy schedule of civic engagements on the Board of the Red Cross, Honorary Commander of Charleston Air Force Base, and the Advisory Committee for the Wings Club, Board Member of the Berkeley County Aviation Committee, Garden Club of America, women’s forums, competitive flower arranging, bridge, book clubs, and church meetings at Pinopolis Methodist Church where she maintained her membership for more than seven decades.\n\nMost importantly, Ms. Judy treasured her friends and family, always ready to dispense humor and wisdom. She leaves behind a brother, Tommy Young and his wife Catherine Traynham of Folly Beach; her niece Isabelle Sydney Young, her husband Paul Pearson and their daughter June. Two sons, Bernard Snow Ash and wife Lize-Marie Hottegindre of Incline Village, NV (Lake Tahoe); Guyton Parker Ash and wife Susan of Charleston. Six adored grandchildren: Violette, Phebee, Max and Tallac Ash of Incline Village, NV (Lake Tahoe); Oliver and Charlie Ash of Charleston. She kept close to her heart dear friends who cared for her over the years, especially Clara Hampton, Bertha Lee and Frank Nelson, and Terry Griffin. She’s predeceased by her beloved husband of 34 years, Charles Frederick Ash II.\n\nDuring a moment of recent reminiscence, Ms. Judy commented, “Most of my life, if I thought of something to do, I did it.”\n\nServices will be held at Pinopolis Methodist Church on Thursday March 17th at 11am, immediately followed by a Celebration of Life gathering at 155 Broughton Hall Road, Pinopolis, SC. – Ms. Judy’s childhood home.\n\nMemorials may be sent to the Lowcountry Red Cross at 1926 Kerry St., Charleston, SC 29406, Wings Club Foundation, or World Wings International.\n\nCAROLYN YERKOVICH FERGUSON\n\nAugust 30, 1943 – April 28, 2022\n\nPortland Chapter\n\nCarolyn Jean Yerkovich was born in Portland, Oregon August 30, 1943, to George and Marie Yerkovich. She attended Beaumont Grade School and Grant High School. In 1961 she entered the University of Oregon, where she earned an elementary education degree, was a member of Alpha Phi sorority, and became a Duck supporter for life.\n\nAfter college, Carolyn was hired by Pan American World Airways and became a stewardess. Based in San Francisco, she met a charming, Southern-mannered gentleman and Pan Am pilot, Bill Ferguson. They married in 1968 and lived in Menlo Park, California where their first two sons, Will and James, were born. In 1971 they moved to Medford, Oregon where their third son, Michael, was born. Carolyn was a devoted mother, fiercely loyal, and she was an ever-enthusiastic supporter of her family, friends, communities, schools, country, and causes. Bill passed away in 1997.\n\nCarolyn’s passion for cooking and her culinary wizardry were legendary. Her from-scratch preparations made any event deliciously memorable. She loved to travel with friends and family, but particularly enjoyed cooking school destinations, making multiple visits to her favorites, Yetabo (France) and the LaVarenne at The Greenbrier in West Virginia.\n\nThroughout her life, Carolyn found tremendous gratification and pride in volunteering or otherwise serving her community. At St. Mark’s Episcopal Parish, she was on the Altar Guild and served as Director of Religious Education. She volunteered in various long- and short-term capacities at Hoover Elementary and was also a Cub Scouts den mother. As a Medford Junior Service League member, she played a big role in creating and publishing a cookbook. Carolyn was a proud and contributing member of Hillcrest Committee (past president), PEO (past president) Rogue Valley chapter of the American Red Cross Board and Executive Board, the University of Oregon Alumni Board, University of Oregon Museum of Art council, the Colony Club (past president), Asante Rogue Regional Medical Center Board, World Wings International, Friends of Alba, and the Twin Towns Olympic Committee.\n\nCarolyn cherished her numerous lifelong friendships and rarely missed a reunion of any kind. She enjoyed annual getaways with college and high school friends. Locally, her Medford social connections meant the world to her. Water aerobics, book club, gourmet group, bridge, investment club, birthday group were longtime favorites. Carolyn was a loyal Oregon Ducks supporter, avid fan, and football season ticket holder for more than three decades. Around 2009, she met Birk—a widower who shared her love of all things Ducks and was a fellow Grant High alum. Their mutual affinity for scotch likely added to their chemistry. They quickly became dear friends and spent the next decade enjoying nightly dinners together and driving up and down the West Coast to Duck games and Carolyn’s family events.\n\nSurvivors include her sons, Will, James, and Mike (Amy); sister, Marybeth; brother, George (Jeanne); grandchildren, Walker, Graham, Bennett, and Audrey; several nieces, nephews, cousins, and faithful friend and companion, Richard “Birk” Birkenshaw.\n\nFuneral service is scheduled for Tuesday, May 17, at 1:00 pm at the First Presbyterian Church, 85 South Holly Street, Medford, OR 97219. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in memory of Carolyn to The Hillcrest Committee, Asante Rogue Regional Medical Center, University of Oregon Foundation, or the charity of your choice.\n\nCHRISTINA INGRID KOEHLER\n\nJune 6, 1939 – February 26, 2022\n\nReno, Nevada Resident\n\nChristina Ingrid Koehler (née Hagblom) was born in Uppsala, Sweden on June 6, 1939. Affectionately known as Tina or Mormor, Tina’s life read like an old Hollywood movie script. She had quite a spirited youth growing up in Linköping, Sweden with her parents Gunnar and Kerstin and siblings, Gunilla and Jan. In the early 60’s she worked in a hotel reception in Lysekil, Sweden and then as a surveyor in London, UK. She eventually landed in Heidelberg, Germany where she studied German and met interesting people from all over the world. This is where she found her wanderlust and love of adventure, along with an appreciation for good food and good wine. It was also in Heidelberg where she first met her future husband, Joe, a US Army serviceman.\n\nIn 1965, Tina was part of an elite group of smart and beautiful women recruited from Sweden to serve as stewardesses for Pan American World Airways. Upon arriving in New York, she reconnected with her old friend Joe Koehler. After living the single life in Manhattan for a few years, they were married in Linköping, Sweden and settled in New Jersey where they raised their two daughters, Louise and Anna.\n\nTina had an amazing career with Pan American World Airways and then worked for Delta Airlines as a flight attendant, until she retired in 2009. Tina traveled the world and took her family with her. Wherever she was, it was a party. She had a huge joy for life and laughter. Tina was mischievous and always coming up with a prank, a surprise or some crazy scheme to make people laugh. She was a matchmaker and took pride in helping facilitate many wonderful relationships! She left an undeniable and incredible impression on everyone she met, including President Nixon, Arthur Ashe, Ella Fitzgerald, Omar Sharif and Pavarotti among others.\n\nTina was known to be very spontaneous, hardworking, well-mannered and very cultured. She was kind and extremely generous. Most of all, she was a great wife, a true friend and an amazing mother and grandmother. She loved her family and friends deeply and even as her illness progressed, Tina never lost her toughness and tenacity. She fought the good fight. Tina also never lost her sense of humor and was still joking just hours before her passing.\n\nIn her final years she settled in Reno and lived with her daughter Louise, son-in-law Kurtis and her grandchildren, Joe and Charlotte. Together they enjoyed many adventures including trips to Lake Tahoe, San Francisco, as well as many lively visits to the casinos. She LOVED her Buffalo slot machines, and she especially loved a jackpot!\n\nTina passed away peacefully at home, with her daughter Louise at her side on February 26th. She leaves behind two daughters Louise (Kurtis) Koehler-Packer, Anna (Mike) Brewer, four grandchildren (Joe, Charlotte, Derek and Mia), sister Gunilla Karlfeldt of Danderyd, Sweden, cousins, nieces and nephews and countless friends and acquaintances around the globe. She is predeceased by her husband Joseph F Koehler and her brother Jan Hagblom.\n\nA private service will be held in Reno, NV on March 18th followed by a celebration of her life and her spirit. Her ashes will be interred in New York with her husband Joseph and in Sweden at her family plot in Ängelsberg. In lieu of flowers, donations are welcomed in her memory at Seniorsinservicenevada.org\n\nJEFFREY KRIENDLER\n\nSeptember 3, 2022\n\nWorld Wings International Advisory Board\n\nJeffrey F. Kriendler, the public voice of Pan American World Airways during some of the airline’s most tumultuous years, and beloved by countless colleagues around the world, died on September 3 in Miami.\n\nJeff had been hospitalized after a fall in his home. He was 76 years old. Jeff joined Pan Am in 1968 as a management trainee in the Flight Service department. He went on to hold senior management positions with Pan Am in both Flight Service and Dining Services, and later in the Public Relations department. In 1982, he was named Vice President of Corporate Communications, and from that time until the airline ceased operations in 1991, Jeff was the airline’s chief spokesperson, an exceptionally high-profile job of dealing with the media, investors and the public.\n\nJeff loved Pan Am. “Jeff was Pan Am,” said Ed Trippe, son of the airline’s founder, Juan T. Trippe, and chairman of the Pan Am Historical Foundation. And Pamela Fiori, a friend and former editor of Travel & Leisure and Town & Country magazines, remembered, “He was such a wonderful and gifted man – totally dedicated to his career at Pan Am, both during and after his days in Corporate Communications.” No matter how serious the issues facing the airline, Jeff responded to the media and the public with sincerity and pride in the company — from the sale of the huge Pacific Division in 1985, to the tragic Lockerbie bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988, to the airline’s eventual bankruptcy and cessation of operations in 1991.\n\nLike so many airline employees, Jeff was an enthusiastic traveler. There was likely no Pan Am destination (in the 1980s, nearly 100 cities worldwide), that he had not visited, usually multiple times. Wherever he went, he made long-lasting friends. Sports was another of his passions. An avid golfer from a young age, he closely followed the PGA tour, and he was an avowed Yankees fan. And Jeff was a bit of a “news junkie”: Ask him about any current news event, and he would recite every detail of the issue, and never hesitate to give you a strong opinion of the matter.\n\nJeff was born in New York City, the son of Florence and Bob Kriendler, one of the owners of the legendary “21 Club” – or the “Numbers,” as Jeff would call it. He graduated from Cornell University’s well-regarded hotel school. But hotels were not to be in his future; it was the airline business he loved. In 1991, shortly after Pan Am’s bankruptcy, Jeff suffered a mild stroke, and he moved from New York to Miami (he always hated cold weather, he would say). In Miami, he was active as a member of the Board of Directors of the Pan Am Historical Foundation, and worked with the City of Miami on many Pan Am history-related projects. In 2011 and again in 2017, he collaborated with James Patrick Baldwin on books about Pan Am — Aviation History Through the Words of its People and Personal Tributes to a Global Aviation Pioneer. He also wrote anthologies of Eastern Airlines and Trans World Airlines, and was a contributor to various aviation publications.\n\nHe is survived by Catherine DeMoura Kriendler, his daughter by his former wife, Melanny Aoas; a sister, Karen Kriendler Nelson and her two children, Mark Kriendler Nelson and Christopher David Nelson (spouse Amy Rees and daughter Simone Rees Nelson); and a brother, Jack Kriendler and Jack’s wife, Wendy, and their two daughters, Jennifer Kriendler (spouse Julius English), and Dana Kriendler, as well as many beloved cousins.\n\nMARY BARNETT NOOSINOW\n\nNovember 22, 1934 – July 29, 2022\n\nLos Angeles Chapter\n\nMary Francis Barnett Noosinow will always be remembered as an incredible force of nature with an indomitable spirit. Her life embodied her motto, Carpe Diem, “seize the day”. We will miss her intellect, fierce passion, and her delightful sense of humor.\n\nThe daughter of James Andrew Barnett and Mary Catherine Glos, Mary Francis Barnett was born November 22, 1934 in Washington, D.C., spending her childhood and adolescent years in Danville, Virginia. Tragedy to her family came early as her father passed away in 1937 from Leukemia when Mary was only three. As a widow, her mother would move to Attleboro, MA for better job opportunities to support their family. Mary would finish Attleboro High School in 1952.\n\nThen in 1954, at 21 years of age, she dared to reach for her dreams. Gathering her funds and without telling her mother, she paid her way to fly from Providence, RI to LaGuardia Airport in New York. Mary was vying with the many hopeful young women ambitiously seeking the life of world travel. Interviews were being held with the prestigious Pan American World Airways, a pioneering airline and first to fly worldwide.\n\nOf course, Mary landed the job. The Pan American training young women had to undergo was rigorous. Back then called stewardesses, these young women were schooled in charm, etiquette, cooking, languages, appropriate dressing, VIP handling and many other rules set forth by Pan American World Airways. A further requirement in those years: one had to be attractive. Pan Am stewardesses then set the standard all others attempted to emulate. Mary was then assigned Pan Am routes to Europe, the Middle East and Africa. At one point she was based in West Berlin, where Americans had the air-rights and Pan Am operated a hub.\n\nStewardesses were glamorous women during those early days. Attractive and beautifully uniformed, they were personified elegance. Long layovers meant they could experience the cities they flew to. Pan Am stewardesses did see the world. However, the job was also demanding. They were expected to remain gracious and keep their countenance in stressful situations. They had to cook when assigned to first class. Those were eggs made in a frying pan. There were no microwaves on board. She even served Eleanor Roosevelt who at the time flew coach with the people.\n\nIt was in Istanbul, Turkey that she would meet her future husband, Jerry Noosinow, a Pan American flight engineer. In 1958, they discovered the Lake Mohawk community of Sparta Township. This lake town located in northern New Jersey was a popular homebase for many in the airline industry due the close proximity to Newark, Laguardia and JFK airports. Mary fell in love with this village called Sparta and soon became a mother with the birth of Lisa and thirteen months later her son, David. She fully immersed herself in many aspects of the community. She acted in the local theater, Magic Mountain. She had a passion for photography which led to converting a spare room into a darkroom to develop pictures. To this day we still share those black and white pictures of the 1972 Lake Mohawk Red Devils and Sparta Warriors. She used her talents for fundraising for the teams, setting up her table full of action photos to sell to the parents at the next game. Seeing a lack of places for teenagers in the sixties she worked with others to create the creative space “The Barn”, a safe place for kids to hang. Our home was always the place where all our friends wanted to hangout. She loved sharing herself with our friends. If someone was having trouble at home, they were welcome at our house. Mom gained the moniker “the cool Mom”\n\nHer love of cooking blossomed in this small-town setting, starting with her passion for Julia Child and French cooking. But Mary didn’t stop there. There was a Time Life series at the time, with each volume devoted to a particular country’s cuisine. We can remember our childhood through the variety of food cuisines she taught herself: Mexican, Mediterranean, Thai, and let’s not forget the seven-course Chinese banquet with whole fish. She would host huge parties back then of 50-60 people and loved entertaining her friends from around the lake or down at the Jersey Shore. Food was definitely her love language throughout her lifetime.\n\nEventually, Mary would move to Ft. Lauderdale. In 1979, Pan Am would gain the right to have tour groups going into China and formed their World Tours division. The airline put in the call to their past stewardesses to join them by leading these first tours into China. Mary was ready and embraced the opportunity to travel and adventure again. Pan American World Tours eventually went out of business, and she continued her tour guide work with Club Universe. She had great fun helping people experience China in the most positive way. After divorcing, Mary would establish herself in Los Angeles, CA and continue her adventures in the travel industry.\n\nShe then moved away from tour guiding and got a job with the wholesale travel company InterPacific Tours International and rose to Vice President of Sales (1984 – 1995). She was a sponge for knowledge and immersed herself in every culture this company and following companies would expose her to. She became a top expert in her field, all the while battling four significant bouts with cancer from 1999 to 2022. Nothing stopped Mary. When asked how she manages all of that travel, trade shows (alone) and selling, she just smiled and said, “I rely on the kindness of others”. And in turn, she herself was always ready to help others when needed, whether it was in a work situation or personally.\n\nWith her experience gleaned from InterPacific and then Pacific Delight Tours (1996 – 2008), she later started her own small concierge travel business. By the last portion of her career, she had traveled to China close to 100 times, coupled with many trips to India, Thailand, most of Asia. She globe-trotted around Europe as well, with Italy holding a special place in her heart, and all along the way meeting and befriending people around the world.\n\nIn 2012, Mary found her final work family with SITA World Tours. There she flexed her skills creating custom travel itineraries. She was especially proud of their work on specialized Women’s Travel opportunities. She finally retired in November of 2021. Mary was sad to leave her work family and friends but ready for that well-deserved time to devote to family. She continued to be a member of World Wings International, the philanthropic organization of former Pan Am flight attendants, Skal Los Angeles, and Proshttps://support.curebound.org/team/439878t.\n\nIn addition to her achievements in her travel career, she was a wonderful mother and grandmother. She showed the family the world, every trip would include a culinary lesson in that country. Each grandchild was taken on a special individual trip with Grammy to China when they reached twelve years old. Many meals at home were prepared with flavors from around the world.

Betsy was a World War II baby, born on December 3, 1944, to Navy Commander John F. Wickes, on assignment in the European theatre, and Winifred G. Wickes, in Portsmouth, VA. The family moved post-war to Miami, FL, where John began his career as a pilot with Pan American World Airways. Three of Betsy’s siblings, Jack, Cecelia, and Nancy, were born in Miami. The family relocated to Long Island, NY, and finally to Randolph Township, NJ, where Betsy’s youngest sibling, Stephen, was born. She graduated from Dover High School in 1962.\n\nBetsy headed off on her first solo adventure at the University of Idaho, where she studied home economics and Spanish. There she joined the Campus Union Party and the Debaters Club and developed lifelong friendships. In 1966 she graduated from the Pan Am International Flight Academy in Miami and began a 53 year career as a flight attendant and purser with Pan Am and United Airlines, traveling throughout the world. Work routes in Asia, Australia, the Middle East, and Europe were supplemented by vacations all over the world – safari and pyramids in Africa, an environmental tour of the Galápagos Islands, annual theatre trips to London, museums in Paris, Hobbiton in New Zealand, the Panda Breeding Center in China – she visited all seven continents!\n\nMany things brought joy to Betsy. NPR was her constant companion wherever possible, opera anywhere she could find it, and theatre of all genres. Newspapers, in which she always found amusing articles or ads. Searching for, and finding, great bargains. Good food – of all kinds. Siamese jewelry, introduced to Betsy by her father, became a treasure to find and to share. She loved penguins. All penguins.\n\nIn between flights Betsy lived in Seattle, the city she loved, and traveled around the US to visit her 11 “niblings”, the children of her brothers and sisters. Auntie Mopsy was a loving, eccentric, challenging presence in their lives… creator of wonderful Halloween costumes and Christmas stockings, cheerleader at soccer and hockey games, glamorous date when needed, and enthusiastic attendee for plays, debates, and concerts. Cooking lessons, museum visits, expeditions of all kinds were de rigeur when Auntie Mopsy visited. And with her came the magic suitcase… always containing something unusual. Australian butter. Chinese pupus. Bizarre finds from the rummage sales she loved. Artwork, framed in Beijing. And even, on one occasion, a melon. She taught all of the niblings the joy of traveling, the value of exploring, the worth of trying new things, and the art of packing. These were put to good use on solo Mopsy-nibling trips to London, Paris, Baltimore, and Washington DC.\n\nBetsy retired from United Airlines with plans for more family visits, increased social activity with the Seattle Chapter of World Wings International, Soup and Cinema at the Nordic Heritage Center, garden parties with friends, “treasure” hunting, and continued travel adventures, all of which were put on hold by the coronavirus pandemic. She gracefully made the adjustment from world traveler and social butterfly to being house-bound by the pandemic, and was able to maintain her quirky sense of humor, but she missed the her active life she was used to and seeing her family, especially her niblings.\n\nBetsy was pre deceased by her parents, John and Winifred. She is survived by her brothers, Jack (Julia) of Indianapolis, IN, and Stephen (Lisa) Wickes of Bloomington, IN; her sisters, Cecelia (David) Knapp of Bloomington, IN, and Nancy Volpe of Albuquerque; and her beloved niblings, Katie Conovitz (Brandon), Michelle Roe (Brad), Elizabeth Knapp, Maggie Wickes (Kevin Callahan), Adrienne Knapp, Andrew Volpe, Anna Brodie (Andy), Teresa Volpe, Matthew Wickes (Samantha), Hilary Wickes (Justin Bailey), and Caroline Wickes. “Griblings” (great nephews/nieces) Sawyer, Coco, Jack and Asher Conovitz, Henry, Augustus, Ulysses, and Wilma Roe, Vivi and Chip Callahan, Winnie Volpe, Oscar Brodie, Josephine Wickes and Walden Bailey also survive, along with her many dear friends.\n\nBurial will be at Valhalla Gardens in Bloomington, IN, next to her parents, and a memorial service will be held at a future date. Memories and messages can be left with https://www.fergusonlee.com/obituaries . In lieu of flowers, donations to KUOW Public Radio, 4518 University Way NE, Seattle WA 98105 (“In memory of Betsy Wickes,” Attn: Melissa Laird) or\n\nhttps://www.kuow.org/donate , and the Pan Am Historical Foundation ( https://www.panam.org/remembrance-donations ) would please Betsy. Her headstone, at her request, will portray the Seattle Space Needle and the Pan Am 707, her favorite jet. Betsy was never boring and certainly never average… she was truly a unique spirit.\n\nMARGARET “MARTY” WOODMAN\n\nJanuary 26, 2022\n\nSan Francisco Chapter\n\nWife, mother and retired Pan American turned United Airlines Flight Attendant, Margaret Woodman passed away quietly in her sleep at 0600 on Wednesday January 26th. Marty was surrounded by her loving family, including her husband of 50 years, Eric Woodman. Rick retired early to care and watch over her, spending the last 9 years taking every midweek lunch and dinners with her, so Marty always knew she was cherished.\n\nShe was born to an Italian-American US Army Air Corps soldier, Nicholas Vitolo and Italian local firebrand Ann Longo Vitolo at the tail end of WWII in Bari, Italy. Not yet 2, Marty moved to the United States with her mother on one of the many “War Bride” ships carrying the next generation of Americans to their new home country. The family eventually settled in Orange County, CA and, much to the consternation of papa Nic, had 3 more daughters, Roseanne, Sheri Jo & Donna.\n\nAs a Pan Am stewardess, Marty traveled the World from 1968 until 1986 when she transitioned to United Airlines as part of their acquisition of Pan Am’s Asia-Pacific routes. She would continue with United until her retirement in 2008. Marty immersed herself in an education only world travel provided: from adventurous treks in Nepal, to photo safaris in East Africa, to Israel after the 1973 War, and so much more. One of her fond memories was the time she spent flying Military Air Charters during the Vietnam War, transporting servicemen & orphans back to the US. She had the privilege of meeting heads of state, entertainment stars and more during her flying career. Marty had compassion and tolerance for all humans regardless of race, religion or financial status. Meeting new friends was her forté.\n\nNo beautiful, young professional of the time could avoid a stop at the Squaw Valley ski resort in Lake Tahoe, CA. Pay no mind to never having skied before, the proper attitude & attire can pave the way to an entirely different adventure! That last sentence WOULD be on her gravestone – if she was the kind of person to spend eternity lying down. She would meet her life partner Rick on March 31, 1971 at The Chamoix while trying to pretend to have the first clue about skiing. She accomplished this feat momentarily by wearing all of the most fashionable ski clothes (most likely purchased on whirlwind tours of Europe & Asia) to the best Après Ski spots in the resort. She just chose to skip the actual skiing. Absolutely brilliant!! It wasn’t until just after their marriage that her ski-addicted future husband discovered the ruse. Luckily for all of us, he had already fallen head over heels for the beautiful woman of the world – they would be married SIX Months after meeting. They shared 50 years of marriage together, allowing her to learn to ski and for them to share the beauty of snow-clad mountains all over the world.\n\nAfter 8 years of partnership circling the globe on wild adventures with her beau, the pair decided to settle down in Redwood City, CA and have their first child, Garrett, followed shortly thereafter by their next son, Gavin. Now, as a team of 4, Marty made sure to avail her family of all that the planet had to offer. Global travel and a world of education ensued which eventually led her boys to follow in her footsteps, now with their own careers in aviation.\n\nSon Gavin started his new position as a pilot for United Airlines exactly 1 week before Marty shed her mortal coil. She saw him receive his United Airlines pilot wings and was wearing his new pilot wings on her deathbed. She was prepared for her final flight. All passengers are accounted for, Margaret. You are clear to close the cabin doors for departure. Son Garrett is currently a corporate pilot based out of the SF Bay Area and although he missed her passing, he’s rather certain that she said her final goodbye to him on his flight home from Paris with the most dazzling display of Aurora Borealis seen from the cockpit that anyone on board the aircraft had ever seen.\n\nMarty is survived by her adoring husband Rick, her sons Gavin, and Garrett who is married to Ginae, and 2 equally wild grandchildren Grant & Genevieve. Somehow she managed to give life to 2 full generations of GW monogrammed towels.\n\nWe’ll miss you forever! Every time we get a seat as a non-rev passenger, we’ll know it’s because you put in a good word for us with the archangel of Space Available travel. Every mimosa served when we take our seats will be in your honor! “Woodman party of 4, please report to the gate agent for your seat assignments.”\n\nInstead of burial, her ashes will be scattered with bits of chiffon and brightly colored silk from a mountain top, to be carried by the wind to the four corners of the earth.\n\nIn lieu of flowers the family requests donations to the Alzheimer’s Disease Research charity.\n\nA celebration of Marty’s life is scheduled for 6:30 pm, Saturday, March 5, 2022 at the Hiller Aviation Museum, 601 Airport Road, San Carlos California. More information will be posted at https://www.mykeeper.com/profile/MargaretWoodman/. RSVPs on the web site are requested no later than February 25th."
