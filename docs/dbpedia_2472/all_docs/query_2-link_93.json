        "text": "Joy Boy was a man from the Great Kingdom born 900 years ago at the start of the Void Century, as well as the very first pirate in history.[1] An extremely relevant figure in the Void Century, Joy Boy played an important role in the history of Fish-Man Island and left behind a certain item of unimaginable value on the last island of the Grand Line, thus becoming a legendary and remembered figure in the world.\n\nHe was first mentioned on the Poneglyph read by Nico Robin while at the Sea Forest.[2] Based on the historical recordings of this that Joy Boy left on the Poneglyphs, it was believed that Joy Boy would return around 800 years after the Void Century. After Monkey D. Luffy awakened his Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit, the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika (also referred to as the Paramecia Devil Fruit \"Gomu Gomu no Mi\"), and his heartbeat took on the sound of the \"Drums of Liberation\" (解放のドラム, Kaihō no Doramu?), Zunesha stated that Joy Boy had returned, indicating that Luffy has become the new \"Joy Boy\".[4]\n\nQuick Answers\n\nWho was the first person to hold the title of Joy Boy in One Piece?\n\nThe first person to hold the title of Joy Boy in One Piece was an extremely significant figure from the Void Century. He played a crucial role in the history of Fish-Man Island and is known for his affiliation with Laugh Tale. This Joy Boy lived more than 800 years ago and made a promise to the residents of Fish-Man Island, which he unfortunately couldn't keep due to unknown reasons. The title of Joy Boy has since been passed on, with Monkey D. Luffy being indicated as the new Joy Boy.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat significant role did Joy Boy play in the history of Fish-Man Island?\n\nJoy Boy played a significant role in the history of Fish-Man Island. He arrived there during the Void Century and made a deal with Poseidon involving a colossal ship called Noah. Part of the deal was to raise Noah with Poseidon's help, but Joy Boy failed to keep his promise for unknown reasons. He left an apology on the Poneglyph in the Sea Forest. Despite this, the residents of Fish-Man Island promised to keep Noah safe until an 'appointed time'. Joy Boy's actions and the mystery surrounding him have left a lasting impact on Fish-Man Island.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat item of unimaginable value did Joy Boy leave behind on the last island of the Grand Line?\n\nJoy Boy, a legendary figure in the world of One Piece, left behind a treasure of unimaginable value on the last island of the Grand Line. This treasure, discovered by Roger and his crew, resulted in making Roger laugh, and Roger decided to name the island \"Laugh Tale\". The exact nature of this treasure remains a mystery, adding to the intrigue and allure of Joy Boy's legacy.\n\nProvided by: Community\n\nWhere was Joy Boy first mentioned in the One Piece series?\n\nJoy Boy was first mentioned in the One Piece series in Volume 64, Chapter 628 and Episode 548. This is when Nico Robin reads about Joy Boy on the Ryugu Poneglyph, sparking intrigue about this mysterious figure from the Void Century.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nHow is Joy Boy connected to the Void Century in One Piece?\n\nJoy Boy is a significant figure from the Void Century in the world of One Piece. He left a mysterious treasure on the final island of the Grand Line, which became a target for many pirates. He is also known for his connection to Fish-Man Island, where he made a deal with Poseidon involving a colossal ship called Noah. However, he failed to keep his part of the promise, leaving an apology on a Poneglyph. The legacy of Joy Boy continues to influence the events and characters in the One Piece universe.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nAppearance[]\n\nJoy Boy has been noted to strike a strong resemblance to Monkey D. Luffy by Emet. He has only been shown as a silhouette so far, during which he appeared to be wearing a wide-brimmed hat resembling a straw hat, capri pants, and a cape while having a conversation with the Iron Giant.[5]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nAlthough his personality as a whole is unknown, Joy Boy had foresight and cared about his friends, as he left a concentration of his Haoshoku Haki to Emet in order to help him in the future after his own death.[5]\n\nAbilities and Powers[]\n\nJoy Boy and his allies were considered so powerful that their might was the sole reason the First Twenty could be convinced to band together to defeat them.[3]\n\nVoice of All Things[]\n\nJoy Boy possessed the ability to hear the Voice of All Things. He was able to communicate with the robot Emet.[5]\n\nDevil Fruit[]\n\nFurther information: Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika\n\nJoy Boy ate the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika, a Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allowed him to become an incarnation of the ever-playful sun god, Nika. It gave him a body with the properties of rubber, giving him the freedom to fight however he wanted.[1] Joy Boy appears to have \"awakened\" his ability while maintaining his personality, as indicated by the ribbon of flaming smoke around his shoulders and torso when he is transformed.[6]\n\nHaki[]\n\nMain article: Haki\n\nJoy Boy is one of the very few people in the world who wield Haoshoku Haki. He had the power to tie his Haki into a knot, allowing it to be preserved for centuries and released in a powerful burst. Said burst was of such intensity, it knocked almost every Marine near the island of Egghead unconscious, save for the Vice Admirals who were stunned by the power of the Haki. It also seemed to act as a counter to the esoteric powers of the Five Elders, cancelling their transformations and sending three of them who had been summoned to the island back to Mary Geoise.[5]\n\nImu felt the powerful burst of Haki on Egghead all the way from Mary Geoise.[7]\n\nHistory[]\n\nBiography[]\n\nJoy Boy was born in the Great Kingdom 900 years ago at the beginning of the Void Century. At some point, he set out to the seas and became the first person ever to be called a pirate.[1]\n\nDuring his life, he became a comrade of Zunesha.[8] At some point, he would meet with Emet, informing the Iron Giant that the time for something was at hand. He informed the machine that he intended to seal some of his Haki within it, for use at a later point, for if it was ever in mortal danger.[5]\n\nMore than 800 years ago, during the Void Century, the residents of Fish-Man Island made a promise with Joy Boy. He attempted to raise Noah with Poseidon's aid, but broke his promise to Fish-Man Island due to an unknown reason.[9]\n\nJoy Boy was eventually defeated by the Twenty Kingdoms, which marked the end of the Great Kingdom and thus the Void Century.[3] At some point Joy Boy attempted to preserve the three Ancient Weapons for future generations to inherit, for unknown reasons.[10]\n\nAt a different point, Joy Boy came across an island, which would later be named Laugh Tale by Gol D. Roger, and left behind a treasure that would become known to the world as the One Piece.[11]\n\nLegacy[]\n\nThe original Joy Boy left messages regarding his return 800 years later. One of those messages was to Fish-Man Island and to Poseidon, apologizing for breaking his promise, and promising that someone would fulfill it in the future.[9] Another message was left at the unnamed island, claiming that he would return in 800 years' time before he died.[11]\n\nOver 20 years before the present, when the Roger Pirates conquered the Grand Line by reaching the then-unnamed island, they read the message and learned the true history of the world but decided to leave it as is, realizing they were too early.[12][13] Roger found the story hilarious and declared that he wished he and Joy Boy could have lived during the same period upon learning the true history, and subsequently named the island Laugh Tale.[11]\n\nFish-Man Island's half of the promise was almost broken during the events of the Fish-Man Island Arc, when Monkey D. Luffy was asked to protect the island no matter what the cost, even if it meant that Noah had to be destroyed in the process. Before Luffy could destroy the ship completely, Noah's fall was stopped by a group of Sea Kings that were summoned unknowingly by Shirahoshi, thus saving Fish-Man Island and maintaining the nation's promise to Joy Boy.[14][9] However, the ship was still heavily damaged. The Sea Kings then took the ship to the Sea Forest, where they planned to fix it.[15] When Dr. Vegapunk broadcasted his dying message during the Egghead Incident he revealed to the world what he knew about Joy Boy including that he was from the Great Kingdom and his status as the original pirate.[1]\n\nJoy Boy's long-sealed Haoshoku Haki was eventually released by Emet to save the life of Monkey D. Luffy from the Five Elders on Egghead.[16]\n\nSecond Coming[]\n\n“ You couldn't be Joy Boy... either, it seems... ”\n\n— Kaidou about Luffy[17]\n\nAccording to King Neptune, there is a legend in the royal family regarding the person who will fulfill Joy Boy's promise.[9]\n\nAmatsuki Toki used the abilities of her Devil Fruit to travel to Wano in the future in search of the day of Joy Boy's return.[18][19]\n\nDuring the Roger Pirates' journey, after Kozuki Oden joined, they travelled to Fish-Man Island and on their way, both Roger and Oden heard the Sea Kings talk about the birth of someone who will lead them in 25 years along with the new Poseidon.[20] After the crew's discovery on Laugh Tale, Oden returned to his home in Wano Country, which also had a connection to Joy Boy, and made plans to open up the enclosed land in preparations for Joy Boy's return.[21] However, his efforts were foiled when the shogunate was usurped by Kurozumi Orochi aided by the pirate Kaidou, culminating in Oden's death during the Legendary Hour, thus he left the task to his retainers.[12]\n\nAt an unknown point in time, Kaidou also learned about Joy Boy and began searching for the next one for an unknown reason. Kaidou also came to believe that Joy Boy would be someone who come and defeat him in battle someday.[17] King, a member of the Lunarian race, seemingly believed that Kaidou himself could have become Joy Boy and changed the world, although he eventually came to dismiss the figure as a mere legend.[22] Sometime after Oden's death, Yamato, Kaidou's child and an admirer of Oden, took up his name and after learning the truth from Oden's journal, worked to fulfill his dream.[23][24]\n\nAfter Monkey D. Luffy was knocked out by Kaidou on the Skull Dome rooftop during the Raid on Onigashima, in his unconscious state, his heartbeat gained the qualities of what Zunesha claimed to be the \"Drums of Liberation\" (解放のドラム, Kaihō no Doramu?), causing the ancient pachyderm to declare that Joy Boy had returned.[25] Luffy soon regained consciousness with a wild grin, as the awakening of his Devil Fruit activated. He then transformed into his Gear 5 form for the first time and challenged Kaidou again.[4]\n\nAfter Luffy won the match, as the Emperor plummeted through the crater he was punched into, Kaidou recalled an earlier conversation he had with King where he said that Joy Boy would be the one to defeat him, implying that in his final moments, he recognized that Luffy was the same Joy Boy he'd waited for after all.[26] After the battle Kozuki Momonosuke the shogun of Wano honored Luffy's wishes by not revealing his name to the people of Wano, so they now know him as Joy Boy and heard how he defeated Kaidou; thus, the name Joy Boy has become a legendary figure in Wano as its citizens greatly express their gratitude.[27]\n\nMajor Battles[]\n\nJoy Boy and the Great Kingdom vs. the Alliance (the Great War)\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe Encyclopedia of Things That Never Were by Michael Page and Robert Ingpen describes Joyboy as a figure from Caribbean folklore associated with humans' need to dance, sing, and celebrate. Joyboy has been probably brought to the Caribbean islands along with West African slaves. He smiles at all the world's problems and cures the ills of humanity by playing his drum. Whoever hears his music is forced to dance and sing until they cast off their black veil of despair.\n\nThis is a considerably similar description to that of Nika, whose powers were once used by Joy Boy as well.\n\nJoy Boy's perceived attire heavily matches Luffy's attire during the Raid on Onigashima.\n\nReferences[]\n\nSite Navigation[]\n\nMajor Events:Literature:\n\nSignificant FiguresArchaeologists:Explorers and Pioneers:Pirates:Marines:World Government:Leaders/Royalty:Holy Figures:Animals:Fictional:Misc.:\n\nVoid CenturyAncient Weapons:Artifacts:Great War:\n\nRelated ArticlesStory Arcs:Locations:Other Artifacts:Others:\n\nOccupations:Organization:Designations:Culture:Related:\n\nParameciaCanon (Natural):Canon (Artificial):\n\nS-Shark (Sui Sui no Mi)*\n\nS-Bear (Nikyu Nikyu no Mi)*\n\nS-Snake (Mero Mero no Mi)*\n\nS-Hawk (Supa Supa no Mi)*\n\nNon-Canon:\n\nZoanCanon (Natural):\n\nMonkey D.
