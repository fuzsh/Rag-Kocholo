        "text": "The cause of death was Alzheimer's disease and bladder cancer, his son, Michael, said.\n\nMr. Bales, who was born in Carnegie, Pa., received a bachelor's degree from the University of Pittsburgh and a degree in drama from the Carnegie Institute of Technology. He studied ballet with Frank Eckl in Pittsburgh, and modern dance with Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman in New York.\n\nMr. Bales was a featured member of the Humphrey and Weidman company from 1936 to 1940, also appearing at Radio City Music Hall and on Broadway, and he performed with the Dudley-Maslow-Bales Dance Trio from 1942 to 1952.\n\nHumor and Folk Elements\n\nA dramatically strong performer, his mimetic talents informed the approximately 16 dances he choreographed, through 1951. The trio used humor and folk elements in its dances when American modern dance was fairly somber. ''Es Mujer,'' among his best known dances, was a meditation on a sailor and the women in his life.\n\nHe was even better known as a teacher. He taught at the Humphrey and Weidman studio at the schools of dance at Bennington College and Connecticut College, and at the University of California at Los Angeles, New York University, the Juilliard School and the New Dance Group Studio."
