To be placed in a drawing for concert tickets or a Local Spins gift pack, sign up for email updates and the weekly newsletter here: https://localspins.com/subscribe-local-spins-mailing-list/\n\nTHE READER RESPONSES:\n\nAmy Austin – I think it would be Railroad Earth. I’ve seen them 5 times since the first time I saw them at Bell’s in 2011.\n\nSteve Sly – I have lost exact count, but bands that I have seen around 20 times would include Blue Oyster Cult, Kansas, Queensryche, Foghat & Yes.\n\nBarbara Potyraj-Robinson – Neil Young\n\nMartin E. Hannah – John Mayer\n\nDavid Ellyatt – It is hard to say, as I have been to so many shows since my first one in 1984. But in 2019, I started a spreadsheet of all the concerts I have attended and since then, The Accidentals are leading the pack as I have seen them 8 times.\n\nRene Nicholas – Believe it or not, Donny Osmond! The Osmonds were the first concert I ever went to, at age 11 in 1971. When Donny became a solo act later in life, I saw him 5 times, so a total of 6. The Who (Roger Daltrey) is a close second with seeing The Who 4 times and Roger solo once, for a total of five times. Ask me again in a few years and my answer will be Greta Van Fleet.\n\nJohn J R Robinson – Either Bela Fleck (in various bands/duos) or Donna The Buffalo.\n\nIsaac Powrie – Umphrey’s McGee and Greensky Bluegrass\n\nValerie Meinecke – Springsteen\n\nElle Lutz – Jackson Browne and Jason Isbell, there’s a theme here. I like great American songwriters.\n\nTom Crandle – Sloppy Seconds and Mustard Plug. 30 plus times each.\n\nJanna Bouma Hasselbring – Todd Rundgren\n\nMike Metchikoff – Jimmy Buffett by far…probably 18-24 times from 1978 through 2018.\n\nDanny Alex – Grateful Dead, but Greensky Bluegrass is catch up rather quickly\n\nRichard B. Kelley – For me, it’s The Rolling Stones: 41 times since 1975. Every tour.\n\nMickey Benes – Styx\n\nAnthony Anderson – Umphrey’s McGee 290 times followed by Phish 49 times. My 50th Phish show is Aug 6th at Van Andel!\n\nJohn Sinkevics – For me, it’s no contest: Elton John and by a wide margin. (20-plus times.) Of course, this doesn’t count numerous and beloved local/regional acts who I’ve seen literally countless times (Billy Strings, The Crane Wives, The Accidentals, The War and Treaty, May Erlewine, Greensky Bluegrass, Legal Immigrants, The Concussions, etc). And for national acts I’ve seen multiple times but can’t exactly remember how many (but a lot): Steve Earle, Alejandro Escovedo, Bob Seger, Bonnie Raitt, The Eagles, Joan Osborne, and gee, I forget.\n\nAndrew Moody – Dang, I can barely afford ELTON ROHN VIP tix\n\nJimmi Koelzer – Tull\n\nMark DeWitt – Rush, seven times.\n\nDenny Gramza – Jackson Browne, Bob Dylan\n\nSteve Middendorp – The Black Crowes- 6 or 7 times, plus other Robinson side projects CRB 3 times, Magpie Salute 2 times.\n\nMichael J Vizard – I wonder what Aris would say. I just looked at his list: Genesis 17 times and The Tubes 9 times.\n\nAdam Kenyon – Ben Folds 11 times.\n\nJohn Matthes – Peter Gabriel x 6\n\nKevin Riley – I’d say probably the Avett Brothers. Probably have seen them 6 times.\n\nBrian VanOchten – The Verve Pipe (lost count after a while). Runners-up: Bryan Adams and Van Halen.\n\nRick Powell – Peter Gabriel …pretty much every tour since he went solo after Genesis.\n\nShazzer McBroddle – King Crimson, Kraftwerk and California Guitar Trio\n\nScott VanderSchel – The Verve Pipe. Too many to count.\n\nKelly Scott Kelly – Thanks to our friend, Troy Garcia I’d have to say Bruce Springsteen.\n\nRandy Cleves – Rush. Lost count, but pushing 20.\n\nLani Jordan – Springsteen — headed for concert #13 in Philly August 24. Second is Rosanne Cash with 9.\n\nSarah Fairbanks Keen – Pearl Jam by a wide margin. Shows #21 and 22 coming up at the end of the month. Give or take a couple.\n\nBrandino Proch – I don’t know what my Desmond Jones or Mustard Plug counts are – probably pushing 20 each – but Phish is at 26 and will be at 31 by the end of the week!\n\nJamee Valdez-Welch – Sometimes your local favs move away, but you always travel around the country or Mexico to see them= Greensky Bluegrass #144 times. Phish soon to be 75 times. Umphrey’s McGee #53.\n\nKelly Latimer – The Avett Brothers. 16 times since 2018. 1 more show this year. Next closest? Kenny Chesney or Tim McGraw. Guessing maybe 7-8 times.\n\nJames R. Murphy Jr. – Bruce Springsteen. Then, the Kinks.\n\nBob Schader – Genesis!\n\nTricia Boot – In the last 10 years, I’ve seen Trombone Shorty seven times (including once in NOLA). But reading these other responses is making think I need to step up my game in terms of traveling to see my favorites!\n\nBrian Haik – The Allman Brothers Band! Seen them 22 times all across the country. Twice with Dickey Betts, 20 times with Derek & Warren.\n\nDon Bidell – Santana…over 70x since 1977\n\nBen Wade – Clutch – the show at 20 Monroe next month will be my 10th or 11th time.\n\nMichael J Vizard – Captain Geech and The Shrimp Shack Shooters…7 times…\n\nDaniel P Hudelson – The Guess Who, maybe 10 times back in the day, and four more during the 2000-2001 reunion tours, plus several solo Burton and a Cummings Bachman show.\n\nMyrna Jacobs – Kenny Rogers. And band. My brother-in-law played bass with him for 40 years.\n\nMike Metchikoff – Jimmy Buffett by far…probably 18-24 times from 1978 through 2018.\n\nRick Wilson – The Who five times\n\nLee Chase – Little Feat – 8 or 9 shows, and several Michigan bands (e.g. MC5, SRC, Alice Cooper, Frost etc.) that I saw play countless times.\n\nCharles Honey – The Kinks/Ray Davies, 7X. Best was Ray solo at the Michigan Theater in Ann Arbor, backed by the 88s. Also Schoolboys in Disgrace concert in Detroit circa 1976. First time at Ford Auditorium in Detroit, with Captain Beefheard the opener! Leo Kottke a close second, maybe 6 times starting at MSU Erickson Kiva, State Theater in Kazoo a couple times, Meijer Gardens and St. Cecilia twice.\n\nAustin Whipple – Ween: 4 times, all in Chicago.\n\nVanessa Clark – Greensky Bluegrass and Tool\n\nBev Fischer – Elton John, Bob Seger and Michael Bubble.\n\nJeremy Ensley – Beach House, and I’d buy a ticket immediately if they came around again.\n\nAndrew Ogrodzinski – The Grateful Dead with Jerry 50×. After Jerry dozens. Lost count.\n\nEric Langejans – Doc Watson. I would guess that I have seen him play 80-90 times\n\nMario León – Bonnie Raitt countless times.

Gov’t Mule-23 times.\n\nMehgan Bechtel -I’ve seen Phish over a 100x, which isn’t really that unusual for their fan base. So excited for the upcoming hometown shows.\n\nCarol Watkins – Nathan Walton and The Remedy\n\nTaylor Watson – In the 40-50 range for Umphreys McGee\n\nChelsea Perry – Papadosio\n\nMike Ensing – Bruce Springsteen with or without the E Street Band – 61; 65 counting Movies at the theater (No Nukes, Live in Dublin, Springsteen & I,. Western Stars). First show – Wings Stadium 8/7/78 – 7th row center; Latest – Wrigley Field 8/9/23 – right field seats.\n\nPaul Wyatt – Two way tie: Dylan and Up With People, twice each.\n\nJerry Ford – Prince, Jimmy Buffett and Bruce Springsteen. All 11 times. There’s a wierd mix for you. Lol.\n\nDarlene Cooper – Bob Dylan, saw J Geils a lot.\n\nNed Rouse – Todd Rundgren\n\nTom Herold – Elton John.. over 30 times\n\nBrian Hoekstra – Matthew Sweet, Built To Spill, Flaming Lips, Green Day, Nada Surf, Superdrag, Lemonheads\n\nPhill Kulas – Moto for sure\n\nMike Dodge – John McLaughlin and Ani DiFranco. Same amount.\n\nKevin Murphy – Electric Six. Probably 15 times.\n\nMelodee Van Bogelen Horsford – Pink Floyd ( in some incarnation) and Lynyrd Skynyrd\n\nEric Sky Walker – Counting Crows. Somehow they still manage to make every show unique.\n\nChad Stanton – Well, Y’all already know my answer anyway, but Poco of course! Part of our fun as fans was that we got to know them all quite personally, and even got Christmas cards from them. I helped them get their last 3 gigs in Michigan. After that, would be The Moody Blues, twice with a full Orchestra! And then Emmylou Harris. But as for Local, May Erlewine, and The Willeys.\n\nScott Stefanski – Phish- 14, Rush- 12, Porcupine Tree- 6\n\nEvan Woots – Umphrey’s McGee 100+\n\nMark Bates – Phish; I’ll see them 10 times this month alone so I’ll be in 40s somewhere.\n\nBarbara Hass – Greensky Bluegrass\n\nWilliam Johnson – Ben Folds 6 times.\n\nIsaac Powrie – Umphrey’s McGee and Greensky Bluegrass around 35-40 times.\n\nSteve Lubbinge – Butthole Surfers\n\nTom VanHammen – Bonnie Raitt\n\nClayton Boothe – I don’t see national acts often…and usually only once. But I have seen Elton John twice — both times in Grand Rapids. (Maybe even three times…believe I saw the Two Faces tour once in Dallas in the 80s with Billy Joel.) The Who twice, also both in Grand Rapids, nearly 10 years between shows. Jackson Browne twice, once outdoors at Meadowbrook in suburban Detroit and once solo acoustic in GR. The folks I’ve seen five or eight or ten times each or more are only my Michigan local faves including Ralston Bowles Songwriter, Drew Nelson, Lynn Thompson, John Merchant (Ludington based) and the defunct Sweet Japonic.\n\nMeegan Holland – James Taylor and Bonnie Raitt (three times each)\n\nJeff Martin – Neil Young 5 times & once w/ CSN&Y. (the 1993 show was him backed by Booker T & the MG’s).\n\nWendi Watts Lewis – Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers and coming in a close second place is Miles Nielsen and the Rusted Hearts.\n\nAnn Fisher – John Prine\n\nBrandon Ward – I’ve seen Yes 15 times. (Plus 3 Jon Anderson shows)\n\nMichael Feddema – Desmond Jones, no doubt about it 🤘\n\nLin Otherlyn – Moody Blues\n\nDave Adams – Either Steely Dan or Journey.\n\nStuart Poltrock – RUSH In the 80s.

Love them all!!!\n\nJames Gerard Collins – Seth Bernard and Wookiefoot. No idea how many times.\n\nKaren Dunnam – Garrison Keillor, either solo or with the A Prairie Home Companion show, six times in 40 years. Randy Rainbow, four times. Canadian Brass, five times\n\nJustin Stover – Pedro the Lion\n\nLes Older – I’ve seen Neil Young 44 times!!\n\nKevin Viilo – Steely Dan. James Taylor. I cry every time I see James.\n\nLar Fitzgerald – Dylan with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. It was like 4 concerts in one. I sat right behind Bob Seger (Pine Knob) and didn’t realize it until security nabbed him and he appeared on stage for encores “Knockin on Heavens Door.” The Stones in Silverdome in ‘76, it was like watching heavenly deities come to life, or something as rare as dinosaurs!\n\nDon Small – Neil Diamond..35 times.\n\nSam Swart – Saw Elton in Vegas. It was, unfortunately, the cringiest show I’ve ever seen. Completely pointless stock footage displayed on the screens, not a lot of energy from Elton, himself. $2k not well spent\n\nMichael Packer – Toss up for me: either Peter Gabriel or Dave Brubeck\n\nTom Slendebroek – REO 5 times.\n\nJess William Mac AnTòisich – Dinosaur jr\n\nTerry R Altman – Grateful Dead\n\nTom Henry – Springsteen. About a dozen or more times.\n\nBrad Hastings – Greensky Bluegrass followed very closely by Umphrey’s McGee\n\nThomas Leonard Saxe – Steely Dan, over a dozen, and Todd Rundgren, about an equal amount.\n\nMary Ellen Murphy – Steely Dan.\n\nTimmy Linscott – i’m still alive eddie vedder GIF\n\nJennifer Alexander – Dr. Dog\n\nShelly Anderson – I’ve seen James Taylor 8 times.\n\nMichael Hempstead – RUSH – seven times.\n\nCatherine Haik – The Black Crows\n\nEric Albertson – The Rolling Stones. 5x.

Next might be The Neville Brothers, Del McCoury, or BMFS.\n\nStu McCallister – Tragically Hip\n\nSteve Dater – Elton John, Billy Joel, Bob Seger\n\nCarol-Lee Weber- Al Dimeola – 15 Times. He was my favorite before Tom went to work for Edward VH.\n\nMitch Wood – McCartney x3\n\nBrad Vander Ark – KISS 58 times, not on purpose\n\nHolly Sillman Martin – Billy Strings and Gregg Allman.
