New, lower price!\n\nStarring: Montgomery Clift, Lee Remick, Jo Van Fleet, Albert Salmi, Jay C. Flippen, Barbara Loden, James Westerfield, Frank Overton, Bruce Dern, Malcolm Atterbury. Written by Paul Osborn based on the novels of William Bradford Huie and Borden Deal. Directed by Elia Kazan.\n\nSet in the early 1930s and filmed on location in the Tennessee Valley, an idealistic TVA agent (Montgomery Clift) is assigned the task of convincing the locals to move from their property so that a beneficial dam can be built. One major barrier stands in his way, a feisty old woman (Jo Van Fleet) who simply refuses to budge from her land. A masterful recreation of a troubled and complex period in American history is marked not only by its astounding locations, its first-rate performances, but by its forward-thinking and undeniably powerful social impact. A quiet and moving classic.\n\n\"The Wild Language...The Wild Hungers...The Wild Furies! As surely as the river rises, it had to happen...\""
