        "text": "Tupper, Sir Charles Hibbert (18551927), lawyer and statesman, was born at Amherst, Nova Scotia, on August 3, 1855, the second son of Sir Charles Tupper, Bart. He was educated at McGill University and Harvard University (LL.B., 1876), and was called to the bar of Nova Scotia in 1878 (Q.C., 1890). From 1882 to 1904 he represented Pictou in the Canadian House of Commons. From 1888 to 1894 he was minister of marine and fisheries in the Macdonald, Abbott, and Thompson governments; and from 1894 to 1896 he was minister of justice in the Bowell government. He was one of the \"bolters\" of January 4, 1896 ; but resumed office as solicitor-general in the Tupper government. In 1892 he was agent for Great Britain in the Behring sea arbitration; and he was created, for his services in this arbitration, a K.C.M.G. in 1893. In 1904 he retired from politics, and devoted himself to the practice of law in Vancouver, British Columbia. He died at Vancouver on March 30, 1927. In 1879 he married Janet, daughter of the Hon. James McDonald; and by her he had four sons and three daughters. He edited a Supplement (Toronto, 1926) to the Life and letters of his father, by the Rev. E. M. Saunders."
