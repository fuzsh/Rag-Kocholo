N.U. Unruh is percussionist for Einstürzende Neubauten and "Euphoria in the Age of Digital Information Transfer" is, surprisingly, his first solo album. Unruh's idea was to compose sequences entirely from the sampled sounds of various digital devices to give musical life to everyday items not normally heard in that context. The audio library is extensive: motors, oscillators, alarms, beepers, phones, toys, video games, door bells, office machines, etc. provide all sorts of beeps, blips, tones, drones, lo-fi animal calls and human voices. Each of the 26 tracks, most in the less than 1 minute to 3 minute range, are a whirring din of these audio bits arranged into multi tracked mini symphonies. Cheesy sounds and playful melodies are plentiful and the most promising tracks tend to be the shortest and least developed. The final "Appendix" sample track provides most if not all of the samples one a time in succession. By this point it all seems rather silly, tedious and pointless ... much like a room full of toddlers feverishly banging away at the sound triggering buttons on their toys while others simultaneously play video games. And considering that I'm pretty bored with and/or annoyed by most of these sounds in my day to day life, they don't do much more for me organized into less than interesting 'songs'. "Euphorie.." will be filed away and most likely never listened to again ...
