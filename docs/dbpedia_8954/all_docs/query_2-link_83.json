        "text": "Honors Student Jai McDonald took the time to speak with Professor Bill Offutt about the Watson Fellowship. Bill oversees the process of all Watson applicants at Pace University and guides them throughout the process. In this video series, Bill describes what the fellowship entails. If you're interested in learning more, take a look at the following article to read Jai's full interview with Bill: https://lnkd.in/gsfTkrjw\n\nAre you interested in attending graduate school at Northeastern? Stay tuned for our #MLKMondays series, where we highlight old and new MLK fellows. Read below to see how the fellowship has impacted one of our Fall ‘23 fellows, Isaiah: “The MLK Fellowship has allowed me to focus on my studies in a way I surely would not have been able to without it. It has also given me ample opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals and learn from them all.”\n\nThe secret is to start.... 1 step at a time. A simple tip but the ACTION can be daunting. Last year I took that 1 step, applied and enrolled at Capella University in their doctoral program. I feel ecstatic to celebrate reaching a halfway point. That first step is hard and then the next one - BUT Keep going. Apply, Enroll, Learn, Try Out, just do it!! #gradschool #neverstoplearning #becomingdrDwayne #transformation\n\n⚙️STEM @ CCHS means many things, but most of all it means using your imagination, creativity and innovation to make the world a better place! 🧑🏽🔬Led by Dr. An Nguyen, STEM Research Mentor, our students' research projects speak to both individual passions and global improvements. They are combining science, engineering, art, math, and of course technology, to find new and innovative solutions to a diverse set of problems. 📽️Take a minute and find out more about our 23-24 STEM Mentees and their incredible research: 🔗https://loom.ly/WrVGf18\n\nI'm excited to kick off this year's IUP U-SOAR program! This year, I am working with my faculty mentor, Dr. Terilyn Huntington, and researching how Star Wars can serve as a cultural/political mirror concerning our understanding of contemporary terrorism. This is important because Star Wars is the world's most popular franchise. If millions tune in, then it is bound to have a political/cultural impact on our understanding of specifically terrorism. This is a really fun project! It was inspired by a recent special topics course in the Political Science Department. PLSC 481 Sex, Superheroes, Sports, & Security, taught by Dr. Huntington, explored how international relations and media go together. I cannot wait to get started on this fun research endeavor combining a hobby (Star Wars) with my professional interests (Political Science).

I immediately knew what it meant -- at least to me. Ebow is one of a mere handful of #SterileProcessing professionals around the globe who hold the FCS distinction (Fellow Central Service) through HSPA, an honorable distinction earned through deep research, commitment, and publication within our industry. And as soon as I took this challenge coin into my hand, I knew what I had to do. So yes, at this very moment, I'm working through the FCS application, determining my research topic, and buckling up for a step I should have taken long ago. Thanks Ebow, I needed the push. Let's do this thing. 💪 [You can find out more about the FCS Fellowship program and current Fellows by visiting: https://lnkd.in/gD6dhK6c] #FCS #Fellowship #Research #Application #Challenge #Growth"
