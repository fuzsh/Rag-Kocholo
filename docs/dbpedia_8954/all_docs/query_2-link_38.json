        "text": "Since its founding on April Fool’s Day in 1980, German industrial greats Einstürzende Neubauten have been at the vanguard of rock music’s experimental outer boroughs.\n\nAnd on April 5th, the band will be releasing their 13th studio LP, a double album called Rampen (apm: alien pop music). It finds the combination of Blixa Bargeld, N. U. Unruh, Alexander Hacke, Jochen Arbeit, Rudolph Moser and Felix Gebhard returning to their early roots while unveiling a customized sound they’ve been working on these last 44 years.\n\nSince the mid-80s, Neubauten has been experimenting on stage with improvised pieces they call “Rampen,” crafted with open ends for further exploration.\n\nThe recordings of the Rampen that the band performed in 2022 during the encore on its last Alles in Allem tour have been utilized as the basis for the new album.\n\n“Rampen (apm: alien pop music) is pop music for parallel universes and in-between worlds ‒ for hyperspaces and interzones,” according to the band’s official press statement. “It is microcosmic and intergalactic at the same time. It’s a demi-sophisticated claim outside of all physical laws, with which Einstürzende Neubauten enters a stylistic no man’s land between the past and future. There’s a return to the roots on one side, while a new art form emerges on the other from powerful eruptions of noise encountering cryptic, often fragmentary lyrics: popular music for aliens and outcasts. Anti-pop has become alien pop. Outlandish. Spun like a cocoon. Unheard. Sonus inauditus. Not unintentionally, the reduced artwork on the cover is reminiscent of the iconic layout on The Beatles’ White Album.”\n\n“It’s based on the idea that the Einstürzende Neubauten is just as famous in another solar system as The Beatles are in our world,” adds frontman Blixa Bargeld. “On the album, I found a few solutions and formulated things in ways I haven’t formulated them before, because they were never so clear to me. I’m someone who believes you can achieve knowledge through music. It’s always been that way. I follow the conviction. I’ll find something in the music that I didn’t know before. And sing something that I didn’t know. Something that turns out to be true. Or, to take this down a notch, something that at least has meaning.”\n\nThis album promises to be the next step in the group’s non-stop evolution, culminating in a new wave of Einstürzende Neubauten music, one open to infinite possibilities.\n\nListen to the album’s first single, “Ist Ist,” below.\n\nRampen (apm: alien pop music) Tracklist:\n\nWie lange noch?\n\nIst Ist\n\nPestalozzi\n\nEs könnte sein\n\nBefore I Go\n\nIsso Isso\n\nBesser Isses\n\nEverything will be fine\n\nThe Pit of Language\n\nPlanet Umbra\n\nTar & Feathers\n\nAus den Zeiten\n\nIck wees nich (Noch nich)\n\nTrilobites\n\nGesundbrunnen\n\nVIDEO: Einstürzende Neubauten “Ist Ist”"
