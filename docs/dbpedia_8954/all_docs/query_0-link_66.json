        "text": "Last updated March 9, 2021\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic began unfolding in March 2020, the Pierce Atwood Class Action Defense Group began tracking an emerging wave of class actions related to the coronavirus. Despite unprecedented court closures and changing procedural rules, COVID-19 class actions steadily proliferated across industries, jurisdictions, and areas of law. The impact of COVID-19 on business operations, consumer activity, and economic forecasts made clear that the filings to date are only an early indication of what is to come as the effects of the pandemic continue to reverberate throughout all sectors and regions of the country. Litigation related to COVID-19 executive orders, reopening plans, and relief legislation will also continue to develop as governmental actions continue into the future.\n\nThe following is a categorized summary of more than 1,400 coronavirus-related class action complaints filed in 2020, highlighting the core allegations of each complaint. We note that significant litigation is ongoing and anticipated to continue throughout 2021.\n\nAlthough Pierce Atwood will continue monitoring new class action filings, this will be our final update to this tracker. For more information on class action litigation related to COVID-19, please contact the attorneys in Pierce Atwood’s Class Action Defense group. Other guidance and information related to the COVID-19 pandemic is available on the firm’s directory of COVID-19 resources.\n\nClick Below to Skip to a specific area of law:\n\nBanking and Debt Collection\n\nEducation\n\nEmployment\n\nEvent Cancellation and Service Disruption\n\nGovernment and Civil Rights\n\nHealthcare Providers and Nursing Facilities\n\nInsurance\n\nPrivacy and Cybersecurity\n\nProduct Pricing, Marketing & Labeling\n\nShareholder and Securities Litigation\n\nTransmission and Exacerbation of COVID-19\n\nWebsite, Digital, and Physical Accessibility\n\nBanking and Debt Collection\n\nBanks and financial institutions are facing class action litigation aimed at preventing foreclosures and suspending debt collection.
