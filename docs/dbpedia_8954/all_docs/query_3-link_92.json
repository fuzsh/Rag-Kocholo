        "text": "My wife and I made a “jaunt” to the Ferry Building recently, just to throw some money at our favorite food purveyors, and because the 2 and 3 haven’t run since April, we now have to walk to the Transbay Terminal to pick up a 38. No problem really, and you get your choice of seats. However….by the time we get a stop away from Powell Street, the bus is over the limit for safety and the driver doesn’t have to stop if he doesn’t want to, so we blow right past Powell. He lets two people off at the corner of Mason, just to lighten his load, and continues.\n\nTwo blocks from Van Ness, he blows by another stop but this time, a woman runs after the bus and catches us at the next red light. Boy, does she let him have it!\n\nF-bombs and middle fingers and demands to open the door. Plus, she keeps stepping in front of the bus to keep him from going.\n\nTwo light cycles later, the driver finally tells her that he’s only allowed 30 people on the bus, so she goes down the side counting people.\n\n“You only got 26! Let me the [f-bomb] in!”\n\nBut this time, he gets off before she can get in front.\n\nBut wait! There’s more!\n\nThe next stop is Van Ness. We see five people standing in the street with arms outstretched and another eight or so on the sidewalk. There is no way these people are going to let this bus go by! Our bus has to stop.\n\nThe result is that a dozen more get on, and now the bus really IS crowded. People with masks around their chins, pissed off people who’ve been passed by for how long….I can’t blame them.\n\nLuckily, our stop is next. Except the driver won’t stop to let anyone off because there’s one—one—guy at the stop.\n\nI stand up and pull the cord hard; not like it does anything, as he blows past the Laguna stop as well.\n\nFive of us scream at him: “Hey! We’re trying to get off and reduce the number of passengers!”\n\nFinally, he stops in the middle of the next block and lets us out. #fuck2020 #putmorebussesonthestreet\n\nDriving north on Mission Street, I came up to this rookie bus driver running a “double-header,” slow and late. The rookie and his bus should have been about 10 blocks ahead of me. As a result, his bus was bursting at the seams, and my bus was almost empty.\n\nWe arrived at the 22nd Street bus stop together, him in the lead, me and my bus right on his tail. There were a lot of people waiting, and they looked angry and irritable. As soon as the buses stopped (he in the zone and me double parked behind him) the people waiting ran and jumped on his bus.\n\nHere was this poor sap doing all the work for both of us. And now he was making me late too. Through my rear view mirror, I could see another trolley bus about five blocks back. I blew my horn at the rookie, and when he stuck his head out the side window, I called out to him:\n\n“Hey, man, you’re making everyone late. Skip stops! Don’t stop for anyone in the betweens.”\n\nThe rookie made a face at me like he didn’t understand, but then he closed his doors and pulled his bus out into the traffic. He went past the 23rd Street stop and double-parked about half a block before the 24th Street intersection and started unloading passengers in the middle of the street.\n\nObviously, this goes against all the operating Muni rules, and, it didn’t work. The ten people or so waiting at the 24th Street Zone ran into the street heading for his bus.\n\nJust as they were closing in on the rookie’s bus, the rookie slammed his doors shut and pulled his bus into the second lane, away from the running pedestrians. He left them standing there, in the middle of the street, stunned, confused, and completely pissed off. I wanted to pull my bus into the zone, but I couldn’t, that same group of people was blocking my way.\n\nSo I opened my doors. As they started boarding my bus, every one of them had something to say. “Did you see that?” one passenger asked as she went up the steps, “He just took off and left us standing in the middle of the street.”\n\n“That’s what he was supposed to do, lady. That’s why I’m here–to pick you all up.”\n\nBut another passenger was not so polite: “What the hell do you mean? Man, you bus drivers are all a bunch of assholes.”\n\n“Yes, sir,” I tried to calm the man down, but he wouldn’t let it go.\n\n“I’m going to report you, you idiots.”\n\nI could have explained, but I knew it wasn’t going to matter. The hype was up, and when the hype is up there’s really nothing you can do to stop it.\n\nAt times like this, the only thing a bus driver can do is to just sit tight and take all the shit as best as he or she can take it. Hold your breath until the stink passes by.\n\n“Goddamned government employees!”\n\n“I’m going to report you too, you son-of-a-bitches.”\n\nWhat could I have said?\n\n“Yes, sir. Yes, man. Have a nice day.”"
