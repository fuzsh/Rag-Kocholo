The UNK professor views recreation as a way to improve someone’s overall well-being by benefiting both physical and mental health and encouraging social interaction.\n\nHer classes get students out in the community, where they experience the local parks, hike/bike trails and other amenities. She led a project, along with UNK’s Recreation Majors Club, that created a disc golf course in Kearney’s Centennial Park and was part of the committee that developed the Patriot Park ballfields.\n\nA member of the Nebraska and National Recreation and Park Associations, Moorman has served on the Kearney Park Board since 2002 and the city’s trails committee since 2013.\n\n“Dr. Moorman has had a tremendous impact here at UNK and in the state,” said professor Nita Unruh, chair of the kinesiology and sport sciences department.\n\nThat impact is represented by the plaques displayed in her office.\n\nMoorman received CHI Health Good Samaritan’s Healthy Community Award in 2017 and the Nebraska Recreation and Park Association’s (NeRPA) Distinguished Service and Lifetime Achievement Award in 2015. She has three other NeRPA awards recognizing her contributions to the community, state and profession, and accepted the UNK College of Education Outstanding Teacher Award in 2014.\n\nPrior to joining the UNK faculty in 1996, Moorman taught middle and high school science in Oklahoma, developed a youth recreation program in Guatemala while serving in the Peace Corps, worked as an environmental educator and held various positions with the University of Arkansas, where she earned her Doctor of Education.\n\nAlthough she’s retiring at the end of August, the 62-year-old doesn’t plan to slow down anytime soon.\n\nShe enjoys kayaking, long-distance biking along trails across the Midwest and participating in the Nebraska Senior Games. Moorman grows fruits and vegetables at her home northwest of Kearney and plays guitar at Prince of Peace Catholic Church, and she wants to find more time to volunteer at Rowe Sanctuary and visit family members scattered across the country.\n\nhttp://unknews.unk.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Moorman-Clip-new-challenge.mp3\n\n“I’ve done the same thing for 23 years,” Moorman said. “I’m ready for a new challenge. I’m ready for new adventures.”\n\nHer colleagues, on the other hand, aren’t quite ready to see her go.\n\n“Marta is one of the most compassionate and empathetic individuals I know,” Unruh said. “She is a truly wonderful person, willing to help anyone. I hate that she is retiring, but I am excited all the same.”"
