Germany

The origins of the German surname Unruh can be traced back to the northwestern region of Pomerania. It is likely that the name is derived from the name of the place where the original bearer lived or held land; thus, Unruh would indicate "one who came from Unrow," a village on the coast of the Baltic Sea. It is also possible that the surname Unruh is of nickname origin, deriving its meaning from the Middle High German word "unruowe," which indicates "restless or quarrelsome person."1
