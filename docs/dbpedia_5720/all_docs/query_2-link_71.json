        "text": "Sam Fast, Media Specialist\n\nSam was born and raised at the First United Methodist Church of Orange. Throughout his childhood and youth, he was involved in many of the ministries around campus. After graduating, he remained active in the church, joining the staff in the spring of 2016. Besides working in the office, he is also a licensed pharmacy technician. Sam also loves video games and playing and watching ice hockey.\n\nHis main responsibilities are producing weekly worship materials, the church newsletter, and website maintenance.\n\nContact: [email protected]\n\nMike Short, Music Director\n\nMike has been the Director of Music at FUMCO since September of 1988. He directs the Sanctuary Choir. After working for the Orange Unified School District for 40 years, Mike recently retired from his position as the Choral Director at Orange High School. He is the Founding Director of the Orange Community Master Chorale. He received his Bachelor of Music degree from Chapman College in 1979 and his Masters in Choral Conducting from California State University Fullerton in 1987. Mr. Short is married to Vicki, and they have two adult children and three grandchildren.\n\nSylvia Coussa, Bell Choir Director\n\nSylvia has been directing the Hand Bell program at 1st United Methodist Church since 2006. She has participated in many different aspects of church music her whole life. This includes both vocal and instrumental aspects. Sylvia was a church organist for over 25 years. She has sung in church choirs since childhood. She earned a Bachelor's Degree from Long Beach State and a Masters degree from Azusa Pacific. Mrs. Coussa was credentialed for teaching grades K-8. She retired from teaching in 2001.\n\nTo Sylvia, the planning and preparation of music to be used in a worship service is a very spiritual and rewarding experience. Her belief is that the musicianship and readiness of each member of the bell choir is important, but more importantly is the realization that they are in a leadership position for each person in worship.\n\nIn her spare time, Sylvia enjoys reading, crossword puzzles, and gardening.\n\nContact: [email protected]"
