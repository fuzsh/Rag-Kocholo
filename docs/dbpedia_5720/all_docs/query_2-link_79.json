        "text": "Seasons of Authority and Seasons of Inheritance\n\nHe just received a journal from the first martyr that he had been putting payments on for years. Then he got a baseball bat from someone important. And he got Catherine Colmans white gown.\n\nBill’s name is actually Billy, not William.\n\nWe are a class that is excited about the anointing that people carry.\n\nWe don’t worship the saints or their possessions but we do need to keep the testimony of what God did through them.\n\nHe’s dreaming about putting together a museum for the revivalists of history. Having people perform their monologues and keeping record of their accomplishments.\n\nThis isn’t the topic today, but it’s cool.\n\nMatthew 11\n\nGod switches the lesson plan so that we don’t get addicted to a pattern but addicted to His voice.\n\nThe moment He has you giving everything away, He will begin to teach you saving.\n\nThe moment He has you learn to get wisdom from people, he will pull the councilors from your life and teach you to listen to Him. And back and forth.\n\nGod is teaching us to be successful.\n\nWe are an outcome based people and that’s not bad. But the Lord is also teaching us to love process.\n\nv11\n\nJohn the Baptist is living in old testament times. Before the new covenant.\n\nIt is said that he had the spirit and power of Elijah but we don’t have any examples of power besides preaching.\n\nThis does not say that the least in heaven is greater than John.\n\nWhen israel was in Egypt going to the promised land, they put the lamb on the doorpost, and then they God through the red sea and it’s the “baptism of moses” then they have to cross the Jordan River to get to the promised land. This is a prophetic portrayal of the second baptism that would come by faith to the Children of Israel. Not all of Israel crossed into the promised land.\n\nPeople on both sides of the river (HS baptism) are part of Israel and they were taught to fight together. Those who did not cross fought their battles with swords and spears, while those who crossed walked around walls and shouted. Both were powerful but after crossing the baptism, they were not using the natural weapons of war. On the promised land side, they often lead their armies with choirs because they won due to who’s they were.\n\nJohn is great in heaven, but he didn’t get the opportunity to cross the “second baptism” (receive the Holy Spirit) so he is lesser than all believers in the new covenant.\n\nThe kingdom realm gives you access to God that none of the OT prophets had access to. When Jesus came to John, John said give me a baptism of the Holy Spirit and fire. he could see that he did not have access to what all of Christ’s disciples would gain through the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe least in that realm of anointing is greater than the greatest without the anointing.\n\nDon’t be satisfied with a baptism of the spirit that meets all of your doctrinal qualifications, only be satisfied with a burning fire within you that cannot be stopped or contained that gives you expressions of power beyond human reasoning for which only God can be given credit.\n\nJohn G Lake was like this, he went after more even after receiving the HS.\n\nDon’t try to impress people with what you have or with your hunger. Enjoy it in the secret place and in public be a servant of all and give out all that you have.\n\nOne night in Weaverville while they were worshiping in a small group, Bill had everyone pick one element of God’s being and praise Him about that without changing the subject.\n\nWe are to love Him with all of our mind, so we had been used to praising in tongues but we learned how to focus on worship with renewed minds.\n\nWe would worry a lot less about what people thought of us if we realized what little they did.\n\nAfter the meeting Bill asked, what did you experience?\n\nThey all said that when they felt like they came to the end of what they knew about that aspect of God, then revelation came and God showed them things about his (love,mercy,joy) that they didn’t know.\n\nSometimes you won’t get more until you’ve given away what you have.\n\nv12\n\nMark 10:15 You can only enter what you receive. Matt 11:12 The violent take it by force. There is a discrepancy here.\n\nIt is essential that we learn the seasons of the Spirit in our life. Because there are seasons when we will only get things through violence (faith). But other seasons, we just have to receive things that we haven’t gotten with childlikeness.\n\nSometimes we have seasons where we feel the need to go and proclaim and pray the goodness of God into things with fasting, crying, weeping before the Lord. Sometimes it takes that type of violence and faith. It may take groans and tongues and deciding not to be satisfied until God gives it to you. It is not to be done only with your peers or to impress people. This is to be done so that you build personal history with God. This is like Hannah who gave birth to Samuel. A baby chick needs to fight it’s way out of the shell otherwise it will not be strong enough for the outside world. So when it is the season for fighting, you must do that. He does this so that we learn our authority.\n\nOther times you cannot get something that way. Other times, the only way you will get it is by being a child and letting Him bring it to you. He does this so that we learn our identity.\n\nWhy would he have us learn two separate things? It is frustrating.\n\nWe must learn both authority and identity.\n\nWe learn what to get through authority and what to get through identity.\n\nYou might think that you need to fight for the big things and ask for the small things… that’s not the case. “ask of me and I’ll give you the nations”\n\nPerhaps the reason we haven’t received the nations yet is because we are fighting for them instead of receiving our inheritance.\n\nWe must pray for wisdom to know which season we are in.\n\nSometimes we are in a season of violence when all of our friends are in inheritance. It isn’t wrong for us to be different and in our own season.\n\nSometimes the whole church body you are in is in a different season than you.\n\nDon’t feel the pressure to be pulled out of your season.\n\nQ&A\n\nExplaining seasons, is it possible to be in a span of time where you need to respond to one thing with an application of faith and to another thing you need to receive?\n\nI don’t think of things in terms of which season I’m in. I think of things in terms of how to respond to a specific circumstance. I’ve experienced times when I’ve prayed for something and I’ve known that it grieved the Lord, then I know I’m supposed to just wait and accept it.\n\nWaiting on the Lord means, pay attention to where the Lord is and go there. You are in pursuit even though you are waiting. You are ambushing the Lord. (Face to Face with God chpt Setting an Ambush)\n\nBill’s automatic response is to go after things violently and then when he discovers that he’s been shadow boxing after three months he says, “Ok, plan B”. I’m not always good at discerning seasons but I am good at noticing when something isn’t working.\n\nWhen Bill talks about breakthrough he is usually talking about gaining access to something he doesn’t have.\n\nAs you learn to do something, you begin by copying what someone else has done and then you begin to get ideas of your own. The same is true in ministry, if you go from scratch you might\n\nBill doesn’t pray about his character. He used to, but now he only prays about himself when he needs to confess when he was a jerk. But he doesn’t want to look at himself and pray about himself, he wants to obey God.\n\n“In my early days I prayed a lot but it was all about me until I realized that all infants are all about themselves, but as we step into maturity, we change the subject”\n\nDon’t pray, oh God test me… that’s probably wrong. And don’t sing “I’m so dry”… I’m standing in the middle of a river. Avoid declaring lies over yourself.\n\nOne of the great challenges in our life is to remain hungry and satisfied. There is something about being thankful for what God has given you,. Thankfulness causes whatever you have to increase. After jesus thanked God for the loaves and fishes then they grew. Be hungry and thankful. Don’t stop either.\n\nDon’t allow yourself to become so hungry without thankfulness that you get frustrated. That’s unhealthy.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
