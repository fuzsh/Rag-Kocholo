        "text": "Letters to the Editor\n\nImpeachment: Is that all there is?\n\nJuly 6, 2024\n\nDEAR EDITOR: Some may see it as just another day in Paradise. I can remember when I first became involved in politics. It was 1974, Richard Nixon was going to be impeached — Watergate. He resigned and ended his presidency. I said to myself, “Is that all there is to Nixon’s ...\n\nDon’t focus on cold; Look at leadership\n\nJuly 6, 2024\n\nDEAR EDITOR: Joe Biden gave a weak performance in his June 27 debate with Donald Trump. Don’t look at just those 90 minutes as failed versus his 51 years in public service! It’s simply this — the leader of the free world was sick.

The ...\n\nSee something, then say something\n\nJuly 6, 2024\n\nDEAR EDITOR: Recently in Coitsville Township, I was walking across the road to get my rural mail and Vindicator at the mailbox. Suddenly, a white pick-up truck with double wheels on the back came barreling down the road at a fast rate. I had my eyes on lookout for the truck, since I could ...\n\nSound off! Readers share their thoughts\n\nJuly 6, 2024\n\nTrump said he would stack the courts, he did. Using threats in primary elections he took control of all Republicans, it worked. Using wealth, he slowed all criminal cases against him, it worked. He expressed a desire to be president for life and with the immunity case going in his favor, in the ..."
