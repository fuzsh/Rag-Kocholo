        "text": "Miracle Mile (2024)\n\nMy current magnum opus is this feature length faith-based road trip comedy I directed. I wore a number of other hats as well, including co-writer, actor, co-editor, VFX artist, colorist, and more! It has screened in seven theaters across the US, with incredibly positive audience reception.\n\nLogline: Needing a miracle or two, a lovestruck young man, his cranky grandpa, and a recovering combat veteran set out in a rickety van on a road trip from hell, leading to divine destiny.\n\nHeroes Honor Festival\n\nI had the privilege of editing and color grade a series of interviews of Vietnam veterans that were screened in a festival in Daytona, Florida that had over 30,000 attendees. The event aimed to be the “welcome home” event that those veterans did not receive 50 years ago. Each interview had to be cut down form 45 minutes to a mere 4-7 minutes, forcing me use my editing and storytelling skills. These were my three favorite interviews.\n\nSend Proof\n\nI played a part in editing and promoting this feature-length documentary titled \"Send Proof\" that medically examines miracle claims. The film includes several prominent figures in both the Christian and Skeptic movements including Dr. William Lane Craig, Bill Johnson, James Randi and Dr. Michael Shermer. Send Proof has received press from Fox News, Yahoo, CBN and The Christian Post.\n\nBethel Church\n\nI got to be a camera operator, editor, and colorist for this interview between Bill Johnson and Michael Brodeur for an e-course on Apostolic Voices. The interview can be seen in five parts on Bill Johnson's YouTube channel. Part 1 is attached below.\n\nFamily Water Alliance\n\nOur goal with this short interview was to make complex issues about farming make sense to a general audience, while also being visually entertaining. This goal was met in the way I instructed the interviewees to explain their point, the order in which I edited it, and the footage I use to demonstrate their point.\n\nThe Carbon Sequestration Gang\n\nThis is another short interview where I helped the client make complex issues make sense to a general audience, this time to raise awareness about what caused the California wildfire crisis and how to fix it. The version of this video we posted to Facebook now has over 10,000 views!\n\nShort Films I Directed\n\nWhile I have made countless short films since I began filmmaking in 2008, below are my top four favorites.\n\nA Long Weekend\n\n\"A Long Weekend\" was my final short film before moving onto features. It won six awards including Best Director at the Couch film festival, Best Editing in the Portland Comedy Film Festival, Best Local Film in the Chico Independent Film Festival, and Best Cast and Best Film Finalist at the Alternative Film Festival. See the trailer and full short film below.\n\nLogline: A lazy teenage girl must complete a procrastinated essay on the eve of its due date. Unfortunately, she has to babysit her energetic young siblings on the same evening.\n\nA Day Late\n\n​\"A Day Late\" screened in five festivals in 2019 and won the Award of Recognition in the IndieFEST Film Awards.\n\n​Logline: A rugged, yet nimble man must fight to save himself from a hostile dealer after completing his end of a bargain…a day late.\n\nWhy People Don't Text Back\n\n\"Why People Don't Text back\" screened in six film festivals in 2018 and won the Award of Merit in the Young Filmmaker category in the IndieFEST Film Awards in 2018.\n\n​Logline: A teenager struggles to live in the real world while friends incessantly bombard him with texts at inconvenient times.\n\nTrial 47"
