        "text": "YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio — Youngstown State University’s faculty union president said it is “appalling” for Bill Johnson, the incoming president and a conservative Republican congressman, to hire two of his U.S. House staffers for university positions — including one at $170,000 in annual pay — while the school considers laying off up to 13 faculty members.\n\n“The board hired a politician to be president in a closed-door search, sprung this divisive choice on the YSU community, caused a public relations nightmare that alienated numerous generous donors and now they’re further bloating the administration,” said Mark Vopat, president of YSU-Ohio Education Association, the faculty union.\n\nHe added: “Given all the cuts in the past few years, how can YSU afford this?”\n\nWith Johnson starting Monday as YSU president — a day after his resignation from Congress takes effect — he is bringing two staff members from his House office with him to the university.\n\nThey are Sarah Keeler, who’s worked for him since February 2011, including as district director since November 2014, as special assistant of government affairs, and Maria Bova, a constituent services caseworker since August 2019, as associate director of government affairs.\n\nKeeler will be paid $170,000 annually. She was paid about $115,000 annual as Johnson’s district director.\n\nBova will make $57,360 annually. She was paid about $45,000 in Johnson’s congressional office.\n\nAlso, Johnson hired Tim Harrington, chief operating officer and vice president of operations for BOC Water Hydraulics in Salem, as his executive assistant for $92,000 annually. Harrington is replacing Cynthia Bell, who held the position for 16 years, and was paid about $69,000.\n\n“We need faculty in engineering, nursing and other departments,” Vopat said. “We’ve got these open positions and we’re spending more than $310,000 on support staff for the new president.”\n\nVopat said the positions filled by Keeler and Bova should have been posted.\n\nHe also said the starting annual salary at YSU for a professor with a doctorate degree is about $55,000.\n\nBecky Rose, YSU spokeswoman, couldn’t be reached Friday for comment.\n\nYSU hasn’t had a fully operating government affairs office for a number of years and is the only state university in Ohio without one.\n\nMichael Hripko was YSU’s associate vice president for external affairs, government relations and economic development from December 2018 to July 2020. In that role, he served as YSU’s primary contact for federal, state and local governments as well as business and community organizations.\n\nVopat said of the salaries and the two new jobs, “I don’t understand the priorities of the university. It’s got the faculty very upset. This is extremely frustrating.”\n\nThe YSU board of trustees on Nov. 21 hired Johnson by an 8-1 vote. His three-year contract includes a base salary of $410,000 — the most in the university’s history — as well free housing, a $750 monthly car allowance, other perks and the potential for bonuses.\n\nDuring Johnson’s 13 years in Congress, he’s been critical of higher education, including administrative salaries.\n\nIn a Feb. 21, 2021, social media post in opposition to a plan to forgive college student loans, Johnson wrote: “Don’t these colleges and universities — who are charging an ever-rising, astronomical tuition with huge administrative overhead and salaries, who are advancing this cancel culture philosophy in their liberal halls, and with what appears to be a low return on student investment — bear some responsibility too?”\n\nVopat said of Johnson: “Given his statements about bloat in higher education, it is shocking to see that his first additions to YSU are three high-paying administration positions.”\n\nMany have objected to the decision to hire Johnson on Nov. 21 through a confidential search including alumni, faculty, students, former YSU trustees, two former YSU presidents, donors and retired staff.\n\nThe opposition has been primarily to Johnson’s politics, including his votes objecting to the 2020 presidential election as well as his positions opposing gay marriage and abortions, and what he says is “indoctrination” at some universities. Johnson has said he would not let his politics interfere with the job of president and would work to continue to make YSU a place of inclusion.\n\nSome students are planning a walkout at 10 a.m. Monday — Johnson’s first day as president — in opposition to his hiring.\n\nAlso, there is a rally planned in support of Johnson at noon at Tod Hall."
