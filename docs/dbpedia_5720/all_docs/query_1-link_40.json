        "text": "CLEVELAND -- Nowhere in Ohio is the political assault on higher education inflicting more harm than in the Mahoning Valley.\n\nBut hurting higher ed seems precisely what’s intended. With the support of Gov. Mike DeWine, the Youngstown State University board of trustees has offered the university’s presidency to U.S. Rep. Bill Johnson, who has never spent a day working in education, at any level.\n\nJohnson, a seven-term Republican from Marietta whose district includes much of the Mahoning Valley, has said he plans to resign from Congress and accept the YSU board’s offer to start in March. He would replace Jim Tressel, best known as a football coach but who came to the YSU presidency after spending more than two years as an executive vice president at the University of Akron.\n\nJohnson’s nondescript congressional resume includes one item for which he will be forever remembered -- trafficking in the most destructive falsehood in the history of American politics, the bald-faced lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump. More specifically, Johnson voted against certifying the election results in some states, citing “credible allegations of election fraud.”\n\nThe congressman’s claim was a vile falsehood. A Washington Post survey found that at least 86 sitting judges at every level of the nation’s legal system examined Johnson’s so-called “credible allegations” and ruled in ways that “comprehensively dismantled the arguments advanced by Trump in his effort to get the courts to subvert Joe Biden’s victory.”\n\nThose findings lead to the conclusion Johnson is either dumb or a liar. Pick your poison.\n\nWhat were YSU board members thinking when they named to the presidency of an important regional university someone involved in an attempt to disrupt the transfer of presidential power required by the U.S. Constitution? What’s more, how can board members (and the governor) care so little about other human beings that they would embrace the appointment of a sexual bigot, an outspoken opponent of gay marriage who seems to harbor an obsession with what goes on in the privacy of one’s bedroom?\n\nFred Flintstone would have been a more enlightened choice.\n\nIf the Ohio State University board had hired someone so woefully unqualified, the board would be drawn and quartered on the Statehouse lawn and Les Wexner would close the school, pending the hiring of someone with real-life experience in higher ed.\n\nBut when the Youngstown State board makes the very same colossal blunder, the governor of Ohio says it’s a good hire.\n\nIgnoring boos and angry opposition from students and faculty members in attendance, the YSU board voted 8 to 1 in late November to offer Johnson the $400,000-a-year job. The only board member to oppose Johnson’s hiring was Molly Seals, who was named to the board by former Gov. John Kasich. Not surprisingly, all of DeWine’s appointees supporting hiring the election-denying Johnson. Three of them have even contributed to his re-election campaigns.\n\nCalls placed to YSU board chairman Michael Peterson, vice chair Charles George and Johnson’s congressional office went unreturned. But two persons familiar with the raging controversy told me that YSU trustees are privately confident that anger over their betrayal of the public trust will eventually dissipate.\n\nIt won’t. People who actually care about YSU and the Youngstown community won’t allow that to happen.\n\nWith more than 11,000 students, Youngstown State University might be the economically challenged region’s most important asset. That the board of trustees would make such an irresponsible decision -- and that DeWine would support that decision -- represents an epic betrayal of the Mahoning Valley.\n\nActor Ed O’Neill, a YSU graduate who starred in the hit Hollywood sitcoms “Married with Children” and “Modern Family,” said he is returning his YSU degree, asking that his name be removed from anything related to the university and ending all donations.\n\n“I’m ashamed of them,” O’Neill said on a televised podcast. I feel betrayed …. Can you imagine being a gay member of the university, possibly married, and this is the president of the university? That’s an insult.”\n\nBruce Zolden, the CEO of Phantom Fireworks, has said the YSU board’s “slap in the face” to people who care about the school may prompt him to remove his name from a new building. Zolden donated $5 million to the school for the building’s construction.\n\nAshley Orr, YSU Class of 2016, and another of the thousands of alumni opposing Johnson’s appointment, is the school’s first and only graduate selected as a Rhodes Scholar. Orr, who is probably far wiser than the governor or any of the pro-Johnson board members, called the selection process used to pick Johnson “unforgivable,” branding it as another example of how far-right governors and legislatures are attempting to interfere with higher education.\n\nIndeed, the Ohio Senate has already passed a bill that would impose ideological restrictions on faculty members and administrators of the state’s public universities. The bill, sponsored by State Sen. Jerry Cirino of Kirtland, is still pending in the Ohio House.\n\nNo one has a better understanding of Youngstown and its politics than Bertram de Souza, who spent more than 40 years as an editor, columnist and reporter at the Youngstown Vindicator. Johnson, de Souza told me, “is an intellectual lightweight who speaks in sound bites,” his appointment engineered by people who care about neither the university nor the community at large.\n\n“The eight trustees who voted for him knew Johnson did not possess necessary academic qualifications to lead a four-year public university,” said de Souza. “That’s why they shrouded the selection process in secrecy. Johnson is a right-wing politician with ideas that are a threat to the LGBTQ community, immigrants and academic freedom.”\n\nAnd the governor of Ohio and eight stooges on the Youngstown State University board of trustees are just fine with that.\n\nBrent Larkin was The Plain Dealer’s editorial director from 1991 until his retirement in 2009.\n\nTo reach Brent Larkin: blarkin@cleveland.com\n\nHave something to say about this topic?\n\n* Send a letter to the editor, which will be considered for print publication."
