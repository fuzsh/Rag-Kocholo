        "text": "Dear Editor:\n\nI mean, how can Bill Johnson sit for an interview and tout how “pleased” he is as the University’s fraudulently appointed educational leader? Especially since apparently no one in the community had a clue. No one, that is, outside the so-called board of “trustees,” who were complicit in his clandestine hiring. An employment, I might add, that occurred behind closed doors with minimal, if any, input from the YSU community: students, parents, faculty and staff alike. Also, what about the exceptionally generous three-year, million-dollar contract plus the many additional freebie perks he received? Not to mention the additional $319K being paid to personal staff Johnson brought with him on his Trojan horse.\n\nI mean, what effrontery for this man to claim “we have to be good stewards of the dollars we are given by the taxpayers,” after securing monies enumerated above without even holding an open forum to answer community questions prior to being hired.\n\nNow here’s the clincher. In his interview with The Vindicator, Johnson stated: “I have a complete, total open-door policy for anybody that wants to talk to me.” Really? Well, if that’s the case, why has this disingenuous individual refused numerous requests for him and Board Chairman Michael Peterson to sit in a preannounced open forum and discuss his vetting process — or lack thereof — prior to his hiring? Also, how did they come up with that million-dollar contract? Why? Because it was all done in secrecy, in the proverbial smoke-filled backroom of political intrigue. That’s how. We don’t want to talk to Mr. Johnson, we want to talk with him to discern and clarify how he came to YSU from that dysfunctional legislative body affectionately known as the Congressional Swamp. What was that entire trajectory?\n\n“Without justice, courage is weak.” — Benjamin Franklin\n\nTERRY CROGAN\n\nBoardman"
