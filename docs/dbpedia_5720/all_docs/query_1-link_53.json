        "text": "I have been watching politics for a long time and am very interested in the race between Jennifer Garrison and Bill Johnson. It is amazing to me that Mr. Johnson calls himself a leader when he has accomplished so little in the four years he has been in Washington. While he has said that he is satisfied with the work that Congress is doing, I can’t agree. This has been the worst do-nothing congress ever-and he is satisfied!\n\nSo let’s take a look at what he has accomplished. In almost four years, as a primary sponsor, he has had five bills become law. In 2011-HB 2646 that temporarily increased VA funding for capital improvements (nothing in Ohio) but decreased money for comprehensive service programs. In 2011-HB 2383 that required the Veterans Administration to send notices to veterans about information needed. In 2013-HB 3542 a bill to remove fire hydrants from lead regulation. In 2014-HB 2175 to require that President Roosevelt’s D-Day Prayer be added to the memorial. In 2014-HB 3548 to expand the definition of trauma to include “extrinsic agents” in grant funding. A decrease in comprehensive service for veterans (but giving them better notices), excluding fire hydrants from lead regulation, adding a definition and adding the Roosevelt Prayer.\n\nMost of these accomplishments are minor and do not have any positive impact on the citizens of Southeastern Ohio. That is not leadership for us. I don’t want to go where he is leading.\n\nWe need a change. Vote for Jennifer Garrison. She did a great job while working in the Ohio House. She will do a great job in Washington.\n\nSam Gwinn\n\nMarietta"
