        "text": "“Even though you all have political preferences, they rarely show in your paper’s reporting”\n\nTo the Editor,\n\nI want to comment on Mr. Bill Johnson’s article, “We need local newspapers.” What a well-written and applicable story for today’s politically charged society.\n\nOne of the big reasons I read your paper is because even though you all have political preferences, they rarely show in your paper’s reporting. If I may, your newspaper reminds me of the days when people like Walter Cronkite reported.\n\nThey told the truth and left us to form the opinions. Most publications today report their biased opinions [on both sides of the fence] and leave us to try and sift the truth from them.\n\nI will not subscribe to our local corporate big name newspaper because of the way they go all the way one side. No one is entirely right or entirely wrong. Even though Mr. Johnson’s article is true, correct and practical, it must be said that each new generation cares less and less about the real truth.\n\nA growing larger number of readers prefer sensationalism or the best “story” as verses truth. If people were presented with the truth, instead of biased stories, both decision-making and voting would be affected and done differently.\n\nEvery week I look forward to the release of your newspaper and the refreshing views it brings. My sincere thanks to you and the staff for the wonderful work you do and the caring you put into your profession.\n\nWith sincere gratitude, George Berlenge, Pompano Beach\n\nCat in New Pelican gets adopted\n\nTo the Editor,\n\nGreat news. You featured Jorge for us [on the pet page]. This wonderful cat was adopted and his adopter said she saw him in The New Pelican and went to Coral Springs Petsmart to meet him. He’s about five years old so that’s even better when the older cats find homes. She also came back and adopted Hazel.\n\nThank you.\n\nTerry Arbour, Florida Humane Society\n\nBuilding meaningful parent and child participation\n\nTo the Editor,\n\nAs an early childhood professional, I may have had similar experiences with others who share my passionate interests and recognize the impact of supporting and sustaining quality care and education in the Lighthouse Point community.\n\nBuilding the opportunities for interactions with parents in the early school settings seems to be crucial for the development and education of children. It’s important to encourage and motivate parents to be more aware of their role as the child’s first teacher.\n\nOffering educational services in the community will build opportunities for positive interactions with parents to establish trust and a collaborative partnership allowing for successful learning opportunities for children.\n\nAmarilis Marin, M.A , E.D., Lighthouse Point"
