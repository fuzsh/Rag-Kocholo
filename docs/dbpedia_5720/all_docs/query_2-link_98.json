        "text": "The reason I tell people to not listen to Bethel music is because it can attract people to the theology of the church behind it. Bethel is a word of faith movement (see: Faith | Spiritual Gifts & Debunking Word Of Faith Theology). Bill Johnson is often defended for what he preaches, but I hope today’s video helps break through some of contradictions being taught.\n\nAlso, if you are concerned about Steve’s video appearing to be mean-spirited, I do want to share some more resources that help breakdown the issues with Bethel. The ones we should be struggling with are not the ones who are pointing out the issues with Bethel. We should be angry at Bethel preaching falsehoods. For years, I loved Bethel music, I honestly did not realize what the movement was teaching, and that was my own error. So, I do not want you to be misled, either.\n\nI understand the video I share below is not going to cover all of the concerns related to Bethel, you might be unaware just like I was. The leaders at Bethel are really the ones attacking the word of God. They are twisting scripture and preaching things that are simply not true. It is not okay to protect lies. It is not loving for us to allow these falsehoods to be taught and not speak up. If you would like more research, please check out the following:\n\n03/24/2023 – Physics of Heaven | Counterfeit Vs.

Soon after the Mike’s review, Bethel quietly removed the book from their shelves, but they have not publicly recanted and called out the teachings of the book.\n\nWhen Heaven Invades Earth | An Honest Look at Bill Johnson’s Teachings & Why It Matters by Melissa Dougherty\n\nBethel/Bethel Music/Jesus Culture/Bill Johnson by Michelle Lesley\n\nThe Truth about Grave Sucking at Bethel Church by Fight for Truth\n\nBethel & New Age Spirit Animals by Doreen Virtue (Covers Kris Valloton claiming he hears from the Lord, and reading symbols in animals, which is a type of omen, violation of Deuteronomy 18.

How does this contradict scripture?\n\nBill’s wife sadly passed away from sickness. Please pray for the family. Steve isn’t making the video to be cruel, but rather plead and show how damaging the false teaching of the word of faith movement is.\n\nBill Johnson preaches we can declare and decree healing. However, we cannot decree and declare, it is not Biblical. Why is declaring and decreeing wrong?\n\nWhat is the hypocrisy when the Bethel school of supernatural ministry got COVID?\n\nBill gives great advice for what we should do for the sick during COVID, but what is missing from what he usually preaches?\n\nBill Johnson claims miracles are connected to the Gospel – why is this a problem?\n\nHow does Bill Johnson contradict his own words when he talks of someone who is suffering and showing Christ?\n\nWhy is it wrong to say everyone who has faith will be healed, and then say well, not everyone will be healed so they shouldn’t feel bad if they are not healed?\n\nWhat is Steve Kozar’s background and why is he speaking against Bill Johnson and those who promote similar theology?\n\nCheck Out: It’s Time to Reconsider Bill Johnson- He’s Dead Wrong by Steve Kozar\n\nIf link below does not work, please click the link above.\n\nThe Gospel Message: With the Good News means there’s bad news. We all are sinners and condemned. We all deserve the just punishment of God’s wrath. Christianity is unlike any other religion because we cannot earn our way into Heaven. God saw the weakness of man and his utter depravity. Yet, He showed us grace. Jesus, God, One Person of the Trinity, became God in the flesh, the God-Man. He was always perfect and sinless. And His humanity was perfected on the cross, living the full sinless life. He became our atonement sacrifice. Dying in our place, taking on the wrath of God upon Himself. He died on the cross, and He was resurrected because death could not hold Him. Jesus is the answer. We, as guilty sinners, need His blood to pay off our debt of sin. For all who put their faith in Him – meaning eyes are opened to the Gospel, we see ourselves as a sinner, we see the need for Christ, we desire our Savior, and we see the ugliness of our sin. Putting our faith in Jesus, we seek HIs forgiveness and repent from our sins, we turn away from our old way of life. We, through the work of the Holy Spirit, continue to become convicted of sin daily. Our eyes will never be the same again. We see things in a different light, and the truth of Christ affects how we live and serve Him. Christ tells us to count the cost. Salvation is a serious topic, it is not to be taken lightly. For a breakdown of this powerful message, understanding how Christ could be God and Man, why God required sacrifices, and more -please see: Why Did A Loving God Kill His Son? (Does God Hate?)\n\nIf you think you know the Gospel, check out these questions and see how prepared you are for the day someone might ask you why you believe: The Gospel Challenge (30 Question Quiz) – Are You Ready To Defend Your Faith?\n\nScripture To Meditate On – (ESV) Ephesians 5:19-20 – Addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart, giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nCommunity Prayer – November ‘22"
