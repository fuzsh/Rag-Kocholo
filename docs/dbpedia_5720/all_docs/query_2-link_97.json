        "text": "BOX\n\nName: Bill Johnson\n\nAge: 66\n\nHometown: Marietta\n\nOccupation: Member of Congress; lieutenant colonel, retired, U.S. Air Force\n\nPrevious offices held: Member of Congress since 2011\n\nFamily: I reside in Marietta with my wife LeeAnn and son Nathan. I’m also the parent of three other grown children: Joshua, Julie, and Jessica, and have six grandchildren.\n\nU.S. Rep. Bill Johnson, R-Marietta, is being challenged this Nov. 3 by Democrat Shawna Roberts of Belmont County for the seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for the 6th Congressional District.\n\nJohnson is seeking his sixth term.\n\nThe district includes all of Harrison and Carroll counties and the southern half of Tuscarawas County.\n\nWhat follows is Johnson's response to questions submitted to him by The Times-Reporter. Roberts did not respond to repeated requests for information.\n\nWhy do you think you should be reelected?\n\nMy life and career have always centered around a commitment to hard work and making a difference in my community.\n\nBorn and raised on family farms, I learned early the values of hard work, honesty, and sacrifice. Those values have stayed with me throughout my life and have made me the leader I am today.\n\nThe people of eastern and southeastern Ohio deserve a leader in Washington who hasn’t forgotten where he comes from, who shares their values, and who works to solve problems rather than score political points.\n\nWhat are the top issues facing the 6th Congressional District?\n\nAccess to broadband internet is a key challenge because it impacts economic development (remote working), healthcare (telehealth access), and education (distance learning). I’ve worked, and will continue to work, with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other agencies to get accurate data about the extent of the rural internet access problem. And I will support the necessary funding to ensure that those areas that are unserved and underserved by private sector internet service providers are given priority connectivity options.\n\nWe also must find ways to bring Americans together. The violence and lawlessness must stop. When protesters are screaming \"Death to America\" and police officers sitting in their police cars are ambushed and shot, there is something deeply troubling going on in our culture.\n\nCommon sense police reform bills, like Sen. Tim Scott's legislation, should be considered. I believe most police officers are good and decent Americans doing a very difficult, thankless, and important job.\n\nIn an effort to build empathy, make college more affordable, create stronger communities and give young people more opportunities to learn the value of serving others, I've introduced legislation called the 'Scholarship for Service: Building Better Americans Act\" that would provide a scholarship for two years of college for those high school graduates who choose to serve their nation (or community) in the military, emergency medical service, police force, firefighter, or as a teacher's assistant.\n\nHas the United States properly handled the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nFirst, I think it’s important that we do not forget that it was China who unleashed this virus on the world, and that the World Health Organization (WHO) was slow to push back on China’s obstruction. Here in America, I think decisions have been made with the best of intentions, but we’ve now seen the incredibly harmful impact on the economy and people’s lives in states that decided to shut down their economy for long periods of time.\n\nThankfully, we’ve flattened the curve and prevented many of the initial projections from coming to fruition, but that is cold comfort to the families who’ve lost loved ones to this deadly virus. Moving forward, we need to make decisions based on what we now know, rather than dire, worst case scenarios fueled by the national media&mldr; and, we also must carefully study the unintended costs (health, cultural, social, and economic) of taking such dramatic actions.\n\nWhat should Congress be doing to help those have lost their jobs because of the pandemic shutdown?\n\nRecovery has been slow but steady, and I hope to see that continue. I supported the CARES Act to help people and small businesses facing financial hardships as well as hospitals, and I support the Senate’s efforts to expand upon that help. Sadly, the Speaker of the House wants to use the economic downturn during the pandemic as a way to pass a laundry list of spending on unrelated liberal programs rather than focusing on those who really need help. I will continue to fight for solutions that help the millions of unemployed, as well as the small business owners who truly are the backbone of our economy&mldr;because they are the ones who will put Americans back to work again."
