        "text": "The Bible gives us the history of the human experience with The triumphs, the failures, the redemptions, and ultimately, the enduring love of the Father for His Creation. Nowhere is this love seen more clearly than through the life of Jesus Christ. In this foundational message by the best-selling author of When Heaven Invades Earth, Bill Johnson shares the importance of Jesus in understanding God’s love for humankind. Modern interpretations and theology point to God as being angry, vengeful, and genocidal, attributing to Him some of the very worst aspects of the human condition. The Old Testament is an incomplete picture, as God portrayed through Jesus is a very different God indeed. In Jesus Christ is Perfect Theology, Bill Johnson reveals how Jesus completes the picture of God presented in the Bible, and provides to us the measure by which we should judge all things.\n\nBill Johnson and his wife Brenda (Beni) Johnson are the Senior Pastors of Bethel Church in Redding, California. Johnson is a fifth generation pastor.\n\nJohnson was born in Minnesota in 1951 and became a Christian as a young child. Soon after, Johnson read seven books on prayer, which significantly affected his perspective and subsequent ministry.\n\nBill Johnson and his wife have three children: Eric, Brian and Leah.\n\nJohnson speaking at a conference\n\nBill Johnson and Beni (Brenda) began as singles pastors under his father at Bethel. In 1979, they became senior pastors of Mountain Chapel in Weaverville, California.\n\nWhile pastoring in Weaverville, Johnson attended a 1987 conference led by John Wimber, founder of the Vineyard Church Movement. According to Johnson \"A number of healings and manifestations broke out and I didn't know what to do with it. I didn't object to it, I wasn't opposed to it; I just didn't know how to pastor it in a way that it would continue and increase\".\n\nIn 1995, Johnson attended the Toronto Blessing revival at the Toronto Airport Vineyard church. Johnson relates: \"In Toronto I said, 'Lord, if You touch me again I will never change the subject.' So I went up for prayer every time it was offered. I didn't have anything dramatic happen, but I came home and said, 'I am going to give the rest of my life to this.'\"\n\nIn February 1996, after 17 years of leading the Weaverville church, the Johnsons were invited to become senior pastors of Bethel. Today Johnson describes Bethel as a church where \"everything we do either fuels revival or is fueled by revival.\" Under his leadership, Bethel left the Assemblies of God in 2006 to become a nondenominational charismatic church.\n\nAccording to a recent book written by Johnson, \"Face to Face with God\", Bethel is \"a church where supernatural encounters with God happen regularly, miracles are common, and the congregation has an infectious passion for spiritual growth.\" The church has approximately 1,500 members, and a School of Supernatural Ministry.\n\nTheir Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry has 1,200 students enrolled with over 370 from other countries. Johnson leads a network of churches dedicated to global, multi-generational revival, Global Legacy. Johnson has written a number of books and travels extensively as a featured revival conference speaker. Johnson is also involved with the Northern California Revival Fellowship, a group of north Californian pastors committed to revival.\n\nSource: Wikipedia"
