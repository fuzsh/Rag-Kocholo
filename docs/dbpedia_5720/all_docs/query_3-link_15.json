        "text": "I remember attending countless sporting events when my children were in school or on organized community sports teams.\n\nIt was always a joy to support them, cheering for their success. And if, for example, my son made a good play, I would stand up and yell, “Whose son is that?!” Parents’ hearts swell with pride at their children’s success. We want everyone to know we are related!\n\nIn a very unusual sense, I feel like I’m on the front row again, watching as sons and daughters step onto the playing field of life and give their all for the glory of Christ. And once again, my heart swells with pride as I see God honor their yes with glorious exploits in His name. But what is more important to me than all of their accomplishments is who they have become. What they are like when they’re not on the stage. How they treat their spouse, or how they raise their children, or even treat the waitress at a restaurant. I am so moved by what I see from the life of this author and friend. And I stand now with great joy, declaring over Chris Overstreet, “Whose son is that?!”\n\nJesus came to earth commissioned by the Father. His assignment was to destroy the works of the enemy and reconcile the world back to God. He lived a perfect, sinless life and demonstrated the power of God through healing and miracles, ultimately destroying the power of sin and bringing us into right relationship with a loving Father through His death and resurrection. But He didn’t stop there. After His resurrection, Jesus said to His disciples in Matthew 28:18-20, “All authority has been given to me. Therefore, go into all the world, make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to follow all that I taught you. For I will be with you always.” In other words, He looked at you and me and said, “Tag, you’re it.”\n\nJesus is the eternal Son of God. But the great mystery of Scripture is that even though He walked the earth as 100% God, He was also 100% man. Jesus chose to live in the limitations of a man dependent on the Father and empowered by the Holy Spirit. He even said of Himself, “The Son of Man can do nothing on his own…I only do what I see the Father doing” (John 5:19). Why is this important? Jesus was modeling for us a lifestyle that is possible to follow. Not only that, He said that “whoever believes in me, greater works than these will he also do” (John 14:12). Jesus modeled the normal Christian life. He set the standard. Then He invited us to follow.\n\nChris Overstreet is one of those remarkable individuals who has chosen to say yes to this invitation. He is one of the boldest preachers of the gospel that I know, and his lifestyle of absolute devotion to Jesus is contagious. In Capturing Heaven’s Attention, Chris shares both personal stories and important biblical truths that will provoke and inspire any reader to catch the heart of God for people and live a life in partnership with the Holy Spirit for transformation.\n\nWe see in Scripture that it is the desire of God that “none would perish, but all would come to repentance” (2 Peter 3:9). Each of us has an important role to play in seeing that dream in God’s heart become a reality. We must preach the gospel with boldness and pursue demonstrations of His love through signs and wonders, trusting the leadership of His voice. Chris does a wonderful job illustrating this—how the life of a believer empowered by the Holy Spirit of God can impact the world around them. And it’s not for a select few; it is for everyone who responds to God’s invitation.\n\nThis gospel of Jesus is so radical that there could be a temptation to let the culture around us redefine the gospel. This cannot be. The gospel is meant to redefine culture. Acts 10:38 says, “Jesus was anointed with the Holy Spirit and with power, and he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.” I love the whole verse, but especially the last part. It tells me that when God is with you, certain things are expected to happen.\n\nFor years, Chris has been a valued and trusted voice in the Church, encouraging us to pursue the bold preaching of the gospel. I love the mandate that he carries and believe the encouragement in this book is vital for the hour that we are living in. We have been commissioned into a life of raw obedience and surrender to the Lord. We are not called to be merely spectators, but a people gripped by the heart of God who can illustrate and demonstrate the same gospel that Jesus preached. It’s all a part of God’s divine plan for humanity."
