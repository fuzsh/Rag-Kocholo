        "text": "Forget about redesigning your living room or adding curb appeal how about redesigning the world!\n\nAuthor Bill Johnson reveals the secrets of using Gods unlimited supply of everything to transform your family and community, your job or business, the nation and the world.

Goll\n\nIntroduction\n\nChapter 1: Co-laboring With God\n\nChapter 2: The Creative Edge\n\nChapter 3: The Value of Mystery\n\nChapter 4: The Language of the Spirit\n\nChapter 5: Invading Babylon\n\nChapter 6: The Practical Side of Things\n\nChapter 7: The Spirit of Revelation\n\nChapter 8: Celebrating the Living Word\n\nChapter 9: Redesigning Our World\n\nChapter 10: Pulling Tomorrow Into Today\n\nResources\n\nEndorsements\n\nBill Johnson has an appetite for friendship with God, and all the mystery, revelation, power, and glory that comes with it. He cant bear to miss out. He contends for breakthrough, for the impossible, for all that only God can do. And in passion and worship he calls on God to allow us to experience what we thought we reserved only for the future. Bill is living in revival now, and it is a rare joy in this book to let him lead us to higher ground and increasingly taste the powers of the age to come.\n\nRolland and Heidi Baker, Directors & Founders of Iris Ministries\n\nI always cry when I read Bill Johnsons books. I cry because I am provoked to desire that has no language but tears. Its as if I am on the threshold of a kingdom that my spirit longs for and there is suddenly language and definition to concepts that have hitherto only rattled around in my spirit. As I read Dreaming With God, my spirit echoed the final words of the book: The thought of missing something that could have been the experience of my generation is pure torture. I cant possibly sleep in this atmosphere, because if I do, I know Ill miss the reason for which I was born. Dreaming With God inspires me to live with God more deeply.\n\nStacey Campbell, Cofounder, Be A Hero\n\nAbout the Author"
