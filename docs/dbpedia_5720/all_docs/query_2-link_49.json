        "text": "09/19/2015\n\nBill Johnson is a fifth-generation pastor. His father was the senior pastor of Bethel Church from 1968 to 1982. Bill Johnson was a pastor under his father’s leadership at Bethel and subsequently pastored a church in Weaverville, California for 17 years. He was influenced by John Wimber, founder of the Vineyard Church movement, and by the “Toronto Blessing.”\n\nIn 1996 Bill and Beni Johnson were invited to be senior pastors at Bethel Church. In 2006 Bethel separated itself from the “Assemblies of God” (pentecostal denomination) and became non-denominational.\n\nToday, Bethel Church has several thousands of members and hosts several schools. The Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry has around 2,000 students."
