        "text": "Dear?Editor,\n\nIn an October 5, 2014, Letter to the Editor, a local gentleman chastised Bill Johnson for being a ‘Carpetbagger’ because he was not born in Ohio. Democrats would do well to remember that Robert Kennedy, born in Massachusetts, and Hillary Clinton, born in Illinois, both ran for, and were elected to, the United States Senate as ‘Carpetbaggers’ from the State of New York. Personally, I was born in Michigan, but I’ve lived my entire adult life in Ohio. If I were to run for office, would that make me a ‘Carpetbagger,’ too? Or, what about the many Valley parents and grandparents who immigrated legally to the United States from other countries. They settled here. Worked here and raised their families here. Are they carpetbaggers? Certainly not. In short, none of us had any control over where we were born. We can only control, as adults, what we choose to believe in; what we are willing to fight for and where we live, work and raise our families. Bill Johnson and I chose Ohio. We are adopted sons of Ohio and proud to be so.\n\nIn any election, the question is not, “Where did a candidate come from?” The question in every election is, “What will a candidate do tomorrow for the United States, for Ohio and for the people of his or her district?” Bill Johnson has a record of service to the nation and Ohio that is one of distinction. An Air Force veteran now in his second term representing Ohio’s 6th Congressional District, Mr. Johnson has defended coal jobs, the second amendment and Medicare funding. He’s fought Obamacare, fought for a balanced budget, fought incompetency within the veteran’s administration, as well as to preserve our nation’s military readiness. And so, in the parlance of my Democratic friends, when you choose a candidate for Ohio’s 6th Congressional District: Ask not, ‘Where were they born?’ Ask what they will do to improve our communities and what values will they fight for, if elected.\n\nChristopher Gagin\n\nSt.?Clairsville"
