        "text": "Updated: August 5th, 2024 – The article about Billy Graham’s death and people praying for his mantle was removed on Charisma news. So I have looked for other articles regarding people praying for his mantle. I do not support the articles, rather, just want to show how people were praying for his mantle.\n\nAt the time of this post, Bethel has removed Physics of Heaven from their bookstore. The removal happened soon after Mike Winger released a video on the book and discussed how various people from Bethel, including Bill and Beni Johnson, had a part or influence in the book. Currently, there has been no public recant or repentance of Physics of Heaven or similar books like it.\n\n*Holds hands up*\n\nPut the pitchforks down.\n\nFirst, I do want to say I appreciate how readers care about teachers getting called out. No one wants teachers to get called out for slanderous reasons. People want to be loving toward teachers. Sadly, I fear false teachers manipulate well meaning believers this way. I’m not okay with people getting manipulated. Being manipulated is humiliating when we realize someone has had us under their control and influence. I’ve been manipulated for decades. I don’t want you to suffer.\n\nIf you’re upset Bill Johnson is being called out, that’s ok. Please understand where I am coming from and why his teachings are giving me concern.\n\nOne video is not enough on the topic, totally understand. I wanted to make sure I could have more evidence available on how Bill Johnson and Bethel, in general, promote grave-sucking or grave-soaking before recommending the video for today, as the video does not give a lot of background. I wanted to understand where the claims of Bill promoting the idea of grave-soaking were coming from because he (Bill) has been known to deny the practice when asked. Maybe, Bill Johnson then does not promote grave-soaking?\n\nIf you’re new to my blog, this is not my typical style for Recommended. I usually dive right into a video summary made of questions that get answered in the recommended video or resource. But for the sake of the topic, I know I need to provide more context and evidence. I care about doctrine and I do not want my readers to be mislead. I appreciate my readers want evidence. I do, as well.\n\nConfusion: Didn’t Bill Johnson say he does not support grave-soaking?\n\nYes, he has said he does not support grave-soaking, yet he supports the idea of obtaining mantles that have been left behind from previous generations.\n\nThere are a number of videos in which leaders like Bill Johnson and Kris Valloton both say they do not support grave-soaking. The idea that a person could absorb or transfer the (anointing) of faith, power, or influence of a dead (said-to-be) Christian, while at the gravesite of said Christian.\n\nWord of the Day – Mantle: Which is where we are going to get the word “mantle” for today. If you’re familiar with the story of Elijah, right before he is taken up to Heaven, his student Elisha asks that he receive a double portion of Elijah’s spirit, which is known as the mantle, power, of Elijah. His request is granted to him. Often in the word of faith movement or WOF, we see leaders talking about the “mantle” and the story of Elisha is referenced. (I’ll provide some resources on mantle teaching soon.) Another similar term is download.\n\nCreepily, when Billy Graham died the WOF movement was praying for his mantle of evangelism. Unlike the scripture, in which Elijah was alive, people are praying to receive an anointing that a dead person had (or an anointing the people are believed to have). There’s an odd association with the dead and anointing. Keep this in mind. See article on Charisma News.\n\nAdded: 08/05/2024- The Charisma article is no longer available. Here are some other places to read about people praying for Graham’s mantle. I do not support the articles, false teachers listed, nor recommend you follow them. Notice the symbolism, subjective reasoning/experiences being used in interpretation. See: The Passing of Billy Graham and the Dispersing of His Heavenly Mantle, Billy Graham’s Mantle – Beware of false teachers being listed, and check out some of these links for why – Benny Hinn, Lou Engle see also this article.\n\nNote: We don’t have to pray to have the exact gift or power that someone else had. Jesus Christ and His indwelling Holy Spirit are enough. In fact, it is the Holy Spirit Who decides our gifts, not us.\n\nIf Bill Denies Grave-Soaking, How is He Associated With It?\n\nWe need to understand why Bill Johnson is associated with grave-soaking, when he claims he does not support the practice. Let’s first ask, what has he said or promoted in the past that suggests he encourages the practice?\n\nOur answer is found when we look at a book known as, Physics of Heaven. This book has multiple authors, including Bill Johnson and his late wife, Beni Johnson.\n\nIf you want to dive into the book and understand the problems, here are some resources on Physics of Heaven:\n\nMelissa Dougherty – Can Christians Redeem New Age Practices?\n\nMike Winger – NOTE: Mike actually used to speak lightly on Bethel, but after a thorough review of the book, Physics of Heaven, he now tells his audience to, “Run from Bethel.” – See his video on Physics of Heaven – Bethel and Bill Johnson’s Bridge to the New Age & Spiritual Fakery\n\nTheology Mom – Is Bethel Church Promoting New Age Ideas Again?\n\nProblem of Physics of Heaven? – Overall, the book encourages New Age practices, while slapping the term “Christian” on them.\n\nIn fact, I recently saw a comment of a lady who got out of Wicca. She had stated, as a previous witch, she was familiar with the various practices referenced in Physics of Heaven because the belief of Wicca is soaked in New Age. I got her permission to share her comment.\n\nBill Johnson’s Quote, the Root of Grave-Soaking\n\nA quote by Bill Johnson in Physics of Heaven tells us the idea we can reclaim a mantle that has been unclaimed, “where they (mantles) were left.” It’s not far-fetched to then associate a mantle, a power (anointing), that has been left in the ground of a previous believer. Let’s look at Bill Johnson’s quote found in chapter 4 of Physics of Heaven.\n\n“There are anointings, mantles, revelations, and mysteries that have lain unclaimed, literally where they were left because the generation that walked in them never passed them on. I believe it’s possible for us to recover realms of anointing, realms of insight, realms of God that have been untended for decades simply by choosing to reclaim them and perpetuate them for future generations.” – Bill Johnson *Emphasis mine\n\nAppears to be said in Chapter 4 – see: Chapter 4: Recovering Our Spiritual Inheritance by Bill Johnson\n\nBill Johnson Teaches Mantles Left Behind Should Be Taken Back\n\nWhile Bill Johnson denies he supports people going to graves and trying to absorb the faith of a previous believer, he also teaches in his portion of Physics of Heaven that is possible to claim the mantle, power, knowledge, anointing, of someone. The mantle has simply been left behind.\n\nSo, why is it hard to believe that students of Bethel would associate mantle teaching by going to a gravesite of a said Christian influencer, and try to reclaim the mantle of the deceased that in Bill’s own words “has lain unclaimed literally where they (the mantles) were left?”\n\nAs far as I’ve seen, Bill Johnson has not recanted from Physics of Heaven. The book is still promoted and mantle teaching is still going on. It appears the idea of grave-soaking then roots from the teaching of mantles being passed down. Bill Johnson may not have used the words grave-soaking, but he has used the words (paraphrased) “recovering mantles where they have been left behind from the past generation.”\n\nLeadership Doesn’t Want to Correct Misunderstandings\n\nIn the video below, we will see a leader of Bethel say that the leaders of Bethel, including Bill Johnson, do not stop students from practicing things they, the leaders, may not promote. I find it disturbing for leaders, who are meant to be shepherd figures, let their sheep run any which way they feel called to for pure spiritual experience. Leaders should not worry about squashing the faith of anyone who is practicing something against Biblical doctrine.\n\nIf our faith is founded in falsehood, then we need to be corrected because our faith isn’t genuine in what is true.\n\nSince the teaching of mantles is taught and reinforced, it seems perhaps this is one reason why the leaders are not rebuking the students in a way we would assume to see.\n\nFor more resources on grave-soaking or grave-sucking & mantle theology:\n\nGot Questions: What is Grave-Sucking?\n\nGot Questions: What is a mantle?\n\nStacey Lacik– Syncretism: Where the Old and Unholy Come Together\n\nNow, let’s just into today’s Recommended video.\n\nTo encourage you to check out the video, I’ve summarized the video mostly through questions so you have an idea of what is covered. If you would like to hear the answers, please check out the video.\n\nKey Point: Shaking uncontrollably was not a good thing in scripture.\n\nDaniel 4\n\nIs having the mind of a beast a good thing?

He claims the leaders of Bethel aren’t encouraging the students, but they also will not rebuke the students, either.\n\nKey Point: Banning says if students wanted to walk into walls, Bill Johnson isn’t going to say anything about it. What does the Bible say when people deviate from doctrine?\n\nWhat did the late Beni Johnson (wife of Bill Johnson) do on C. S. Lewis’ grave?\n\nWhat other grave did Beni Johnson hug?\n\nBen Fitzgerald (son of Christalignment founder) who is a leader in the charismatic movement, what does he say about the grave-sucking?

We all are sinners and condemned. We all deserve the just punishment of God’s wrath. Christianity is unlike any other religion because we cannot earn our way into Heaven. God saw the weakness of man and his utter depravity. Yet, He showed us grace. Jesus, God, One Person of the Trinity, became God in the flesh, the God-Man. He was always perfect and sinless. And His humanity was perfected on the cross, living the full sinless life. He became our atonement sacrifice. Dying in our place, taking on the wrath of God upon Himself. He died on the cross, and He was resurrected because death could not hold Him. Jesus is the answer. We, as guilty sinners, need His blood to pay off our debt of sin. For all who put their faith in Him – meaning eyes are opened to the Gospel, we see ourselves as a sinner, we see the need for Christ, we desire our Savior, and we see the ugliness of our sin. Putting our faith in Jesus, we seek HIs forgiveness and repent from our sins, we turn away from our old way of life. We, through the work of the Holy Spirit, continue to become convicted of sin daily. Our eyes will never be the same again. We see things in a different light, and the truth of Christ affects how we live and serve Him. Christ tells us to count the cost. Salvation is a serious topic, it is not to be taken lightly. For a breakdown of this powerful message, understanding how Christ could be God and Man, why God required sacrifices, and more -please see: Why Did A Loving God Kill His Son?
