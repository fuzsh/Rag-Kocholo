Bill's term formally began on September 17 after his official acceptance of the role.\n\n\"I'm excited about this new role. As a member of the local tech community, I understand the challenges associated with growing tech companies in our region. I look forward to working with my peers to help alleviate these challenges and develop a community that fosters innovation and attracts top tech talent,\" Bill says.\n\nWEtech Alliance's mission is to help grow technology companies, at all stages of growth, that champion innovation in Windsor–Essex and Chatham–Kent.

By joining the board, I am hoping to tackle these issues more efficiently together, as a single cohesive unit,\" Bill says.\n\nAs Scribendi's IT Manager, Bill is the lead architect on all development projects, including new proprietary software, new web properties, and a custom customer relationship mangement system. He is dedicated to improving the company's technologies and keeping them running at full capacity.\n\n\"Being the Head of IT and Software Engineering at Scribendi is a demanding role. At the end of the day, I am only as good as my team. We have been fortunate enough to have built a small—but talented—IT team here at Scribendi. However, this took a lot of time and effort to achieve, and as we grow, so do these challenges. I am looking forward to helping solve these problems—not just for Scribendi, but for the entire tech community in Windsor–Essex and Chatham–Kent,\" Bill says.\n\nFollow Scribendi on Facebook or Twitter for more news.\n\nAbout WEtech Alliance\n\nAs one of seventeen Regional Innovation Centres in the province of Ontario and funded by the Ontario Network of Entrepreneurs, WEtech Alliance is positioned to provide access to a broad suite of business advisory programs, funding opportunities, and an extensive network of entrepreneurs, mentors, and resources that can fuel your company's growth.
