        "text": "John Wernette, Naples\n\nBill Johnson\n\nThanks to your excellent investigative reporting regarding Bill Johnson's boondoggle behavior as the president of Enterprise Florida, it can be safely concluded that the 'old boys network' is alive and well.\n\nJohnson's outrageous monetary gifts to his cronies deserves nothing less than being forced to leave his post, which he has so badly misused — I trust that he was deservedly fired.\n\nAnd I hope that he will not receive any further bonus charity from Florida, since he has already been so generously rewarded. It is far past time to stop throwing money down the drain in the name of 'job creation' — if this is what it gets you."
