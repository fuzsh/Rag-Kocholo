Over the course of 11 lessons, Mr. Johnson has walked us through a practical theology of the Christian’s experience with dark providences such as chronic pain, devastating illness, reversals in our circumstances, and death itself. All along the way, Mr. Johnson has impressed upon us the importance of persevering in the Faith which we have received as a gift from God in Christ.\n\nTo access these lessons, you can visit our Sermonaudio page here, or use the embedded player below."
