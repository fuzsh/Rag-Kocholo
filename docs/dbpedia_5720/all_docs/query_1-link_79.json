        "text": "Given the deep connections between systemic racism and law enforcement that galvanized the nation's attention beginning in 2020, a special issue on Latinx crime and detective fiction might initially be perceived as out of step with the times, risking glamorizing the various agents and agencies of law enforcement (police officers, detectives, attorneys, judges, courts, the carceral system, etc.), rather than calling attention to the ways in which the dominant institutions of \"justice\" in this country have often perpetuated the oppression and suffering of minoritized groups. Yet the guest editors of this issue of Diálogo have audaciously brought together a series of essays that speak directly to the concerns of our contemporary moment. Furthermore, as the editors point out in their superb introduction, crime and detective fiction have enjoyed immense popularity across a variety of media (novels, films, and television series), and thus have had a profound impact on popular cultural understandings of criminality, justice, and social expectations of law enforcement. In this sense, exploring how Latinx artists have become involved in and transformed the genre of crime fiction opens fruitful lines of inquiry that connect the urgency of real-world problems with the study of Latinx texts.\n\nThe research articles presented in this issue collectively examine the ways in which Latinx artists have turned to noir, crime, and detective genres in order to raise questions about how to achieve real social justice in a society built upon the historical legacies of white supremacy, classism, and other forms of structural oppression and bias. One group of essays focuses on the ways in which contemporary Latinx writers are updating and transforming the genre's traditional gender politics, placing queer and female protagonists at the centers of their stories. A second group of articles examines changing representations of Los Angeles, from a city that was the locus classicus of postwar Hollywood films noir (films which often erased the presence of Latinx communities in Los Angeles) to a city that is now a Latinx metropolis. And finally, the last set of articles introduces us to fictions that invoke the economic inequalities and transnational conflicts along the US–Mexican border as a prime setting for stories of crime and corruption, as well as the occasion for utopic hopes for social justice.\n\nThis issue is also brimming with contributions from creative writers and visual artists, including a brand-new story from author Alicia Gaspar de Alba, as well as interviews with detective fiction writers Marcos McPeek Villatoro, Carmen Amato, and Aya de León, all of whom are diversifying Latinx detective fiction in various ways. We are also fortunate to be able to include in this issue artworks by Salomón Huerta and David Bacon, whose arresting images provide a perfect complement to the noir fictions discussed by our contributors. As Huerta mentions in his artist's statement, his still-life paintings featuring evocative juxtapositions between familiar household objects and guns function for him as portraits of his father. In their stark and suggestive beauty, these portraits also offer provocative meditations on the construction and contradictions of Latinx masculinity. Bacon's alluring photos—part of a series he calls Film Set for a Chicano Noir—powerfully combine the moodiness and melancholic atmosphere generated by noir visual effects like chiaroscuro with Bacon's sharp photojournalistic eye, resulting in these portraits of what Bacon describes as the \"bare-knuckle, hardscrabble\" city of Fresno. We are truly fortunate to be able to feature the works of so many wonderful artists in this issue!"
