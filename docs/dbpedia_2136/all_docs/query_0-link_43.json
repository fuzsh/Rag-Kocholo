        "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, let's dive into the riveting world of intellectual conversations, where words tango and waltz like they've had one too many espressos. It's like a linguistic ballet where the only rule is that puns are always en pointe. Now, in this magical realm, ethos takes center stage. It's not just a conversation; it's a commitment to understanding, empathy, and openness. It's like a trust fall, but with words. And if you've ever been part of an intellectual discourse, you know it's not just a chat ‚Äì it's a bridge connecting minds. It's like building a friendship over a cup of coffee, but with a dash of Socratic wisdom. And let's talk about emotion. Oh, emotion, you sly dog weaving your intricate threads through the fabric of intellectual conversations. It's like a rollercoaster of feelings, only with fewer screams and more \"aha\" moments. Shared laughter under the moon, vulnerability laid bare ‚Äì it's an emotional TED Talk with a two-drink minimum. Logic, my friends, is the guiding thread in this grand tapestry. It's not just expressing feelings; it's dissecting ideas, challenging perspectives, and navigating the waters of reason. It's like a Sherlock Holmes investigation, but instead of solving crimes, we're solving the mysteries of life. And let's be honest, sometimes life is just a foggy train ride, and intellectual conversations are our trusty conductor guiding us through the chaos. Now, in a world full of fleeting interactions and surface-level connections, the art of intellectual conversations is like finding a hidden gem in a sea of small talk. It's like upgrading from a pop song to a symphony. So, as you ponder the power of these discussions, think about how you can add more substance to your life. Maybe swap a small talk session for a philosophical t√™te-√†-t√™te. It's not just about embracing the art of intellectual discourse; it's about unleashing the profound beauty of connection and understanding. And now, my friends, as we embark on this journey of embracing growth, let's leave behind the shallow waters of small talk and set sail into the deep, meaningful seas of intellectual discourse. Because in the end, it's not about the quantity of words; it's about the quality of the connection.

They start talking but aren‚Äôt getting anywhere. She thinks ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not listening to me!!!‚Äù then she feels frustrated and starts raising her voice. Raising her voice is the behavior she does as a result of the initial thought and the feeling it creates. Now, this behavior doesn‚Äôt resolve the problem of being unheard, because her partner is probably either going to shutdown, or start raising his voice too. Then they‚Äôre back at square one üòû But, if it‚Äôs so unhelpful, why is this the go-to behavior? Why not just ‚Äúdo something different‚Äù? Most of the time, in the heat of the moment, we‚Äôre not consciously aware of the chain of events that gets us to an unproductive behavior. And there‚Äôs a reason for that. We take in 10000 bits of information per second. If we were consciously aware of every bit of information coming in, we would literally go insane ü§Ø We only have the capability to be aware of just 5% of what is happening internally and externally in a given moment. That means that only 5% of your thoughts, feelings and the resulting behaviors are conscious. The other 95% are unconscious. ‚Ä¶Maybe 5% of the time you‚Äôre able to catch yourself and make a more productive choice‚Ä¶. But the rest of the time you‚Äôre going to do what you‚Äôve always done - what comes naturally to you. üîë The solution is to reprogram your unconscious so that productive behaviors come naturally to you. How do you do that? With NLP. NLP works with your Unconscious Mind. In our work with couples, we shift what is happening in the unconscious 95% and align your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors (both consciously and unconsciously) with the same goal. When we do this, you experience rapid, easy, and permanent change. This is the missing piece of the puzzle for many couples. #NLPforCouples #marriagecoaching #marriageproblems #marriagesupport #communicationtools #CommunicationKeys #CommunicationInMarriage #RelationshipInsights #RelationshipTips #RelationshipInsights\n\nLadies and gentlemen, let's dive into the riveting world of intellectual conversations, where words tango and waltz like they've had one too many espressos.

Then today, the concept of being inexperienced came up with some of my peers and we briefly chatted about the BENEFITS of being inexperienced - meaning you ‚Äúlack experience, knowledge, or skill.‚Äù As I think about what I‚Äôve done across my life professionally and personally, here are some concepts that I leverage when I‚Äôm in a situation where I lack knowledge or skill. Be the court jester Much of history views the role of the court jester as an entertainer or someone who went into battles to mock (and distract) the enemy. An important subset of jesters were critical advisers to a King or Queen - telling them the truth in a light-hearted manner when no one else would speak their mind. Or even tell royalty they might be wrong. My role as a ‚Äúcourt jester‚Äù at work would be to ask the challenging questions no one else will ask or share direct feedback via an unpopular opinion or reaction to whatever an executive might think is absolutely the right perspective. Seeing a decision through an entirely different perspective helps the decision maker to reevaluate and improve their thinking. Be Curious George too! You don‚Äôt need to be a monkey like Curious George‚Ä¶but definitely be super CURIOUS. One popular technique is asking ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù at least five times to be super inquisitive. You can also use basic phrases like ‚ÄúTell me more‚Äù or ‚ÄúHelp me better understand‚Äù. Not having knowledge or skill about something helps you to be GENUINELY curious to learn and understand more than you currently do. When you have previous experience with something, you might be in a confirmation bias mode rather than trying to objectively understanding the situation. Authentic curiosity puts the other person at ease because you demonstrate your willingness to listen deeply and understand empathetically. Mirror Mirror on the wall If you have specific knowledge or skill about a situation, you may be listening to simply find an opening where you share your own wisdom. When you are inexperienced, you can more easily reflect someone‚Äôs comments or point of view back to them directly - without including any of your confirmation bias. Many times I‚Äôve simply replayed back, in my own words, what I listened to someone say and they are often surprised about how their comments would have been potentially received by many others. Your ability to be objective with someone else is much easier when you have little to no knowledge about what they are experiencing. For the record, I‚Äôm not suggesting that we should be intentionally ignorant across the board. My point is to encourage you to jump into situations that might feel uncomfortable based upon your inexperience. And realize you can still be extremely valuable to other individuals, teams or organizations - whether as a Court Jester, Curious George or a mirror! #leadership #coaching #expert #curious\n\nMINDS It's not often to run across someone who is intellectually a match. To have discussions on a wide range of topics, with the same depth regardless if it's silly or serious. To feel free and open to tip over the bar of boundaries, with mutual respect, unbiased judgement, and active listening. And most of all to leave from a conversation not only delighted, but also mutually enlightened. Without those things, I think theres no real mental stimulation or growth if there's no expansion. Even in dialogue. So when is small talk useful and when is it time for it to be over? It's hard to talk in depth to people with poor listening skills or those who are easily distracted. Not to mention those who make stereotypical assumptions and speak like internet generated Ai Bots. Such a turn-off. Which is why I believe meeting likeminded people is the real accomplishment. Whoever has found that for themselves are blessed.\n\nEver thought of increasing your #Intellectual #Age? In a recent conversation with an avid learner Abhimanyu Yadav, I stumbled upon the concept of #Intellectual/ #MentalAge that has nothing to do with our biological or body age. Often you would come across people who may be in their 20s but strike conversations of substance and depth. Whereas some people appear to be experienced but are often found conducting loose talks and making erratic decisions. So don't worry if you are the youngest amongst the lot. Here are 5 techniques of increasing your Intellectual Age: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Surround yourself with people of substance üôé‚ôÄÔ∏è üôé‚ôÇÔ∏è You are the average of 5 people you spend most time with. Find the right people you want to be the average of! 2Ô∏è‚É£ Read the room üëÄ Observe the body language and demeanor that people carry and the message they send out through that. If not imitate, learn and adopt some best practices from there. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Listen intently üëÇ You may not have much to contribute. But that's alright. Listen intently and learn from their experience. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Ask right questions ‚ùì When you listen intently, you will easily be able to build questions from their inputs and context. 5Ô∏è‚É£ Smart conversations üó£ When you speak, be sure and mindful of where and what you are saying. Ask yourself if your words will be a value add in the discussion. 6Ô∏è‚É£ Reflect üí° Spend minimum 15 minutes daily with yourself and reflect on your thoughts, conversations and decisions you made in the entire day. And then ask yourself - how can I become better tomorrow? Remember, right #behavior, #attitude and #intelligence is what ultimately builds your Intellectual Age and not your experience!\n\nToday I had the pleasure of interviewing Jamil Zaki for an Amazon Talk about his new book, \"Hope for Cynics: The Surprising Science of Human Goodness.\" Wow, what an elucidating and inspiring conversation! Some key points that resonated with me were: ‚Ä¢ Cynicism (the theory that people are selfish and untrustworthy) is like a tractor beam because of our negativity bias. It increases the incidence of depression and loneliness and shortens lifespan. Interestingly, it does not make you a better critical thinker (more cognitive intelligence) or better at detecting bad actors than non-cynics. Cynicism is not effective as a defense mechanism, and it makes you unhappier and less healthy. ‚Ä¢ The antidote to cynicism is ‚Äúhopeful skepticism.‚Äù It‚Äôs not having ‚Äúblind hope‚Äù and assuming that everything (and everyone) is awesome. But it is believing that humans can be good (trustworthy, open-minded, generous, and compassionate) and running taking some small leaps of faith to test if that‚Äôs true (you might call that running some experiments and gathering data). ‚Ä¢ Research has shown that the average person greatly underestimates the goodness and positive intent of the average person. We tend to remember negative examples more easily than \"average\" positive ones, and (social) media certainly doesn't help. \"Average person treated co-worker in a helpful manner!\" just doesn't quite grab you as a headline, right? ‚Ä¢ There is a difference between hope and optimism. Optimism is believing things WILL be better (which may result in inaction because it‚Äôs going to get better anyway) while hope is believing things CAN be better (which spurs action because you need to do something to get that result). Jamil shared some simple ways to start developing your hopeful skepticism by running some experiments: 1/ engage in ‚Äúpositive gossip‚Äù ‚Äì talk about the good things that others are doing, 2/ go deeper in conversations ‚Äì move out of the shallow end of the pool into slightly deeper waters, 3/ talk to strangers ‚Äì you may be surprised by how willing they are to engage in dialogue and connect as humans. To learn more about this salient topic, pre-order Jamil‚Äôs book: https://lnkd.in/g2UfUgy4. It comes out on Sep 3! #hope #cynicism #skepticism #empathy #relationships #connection #emotionalintelligence #mentalhealth #success\n\nYEAR-END LESSONS Values I've learned these past two years. Continuity is the new Consistency Receiving is the new Listening To join in a race running event, you may fumble & fall -- so much for CONSISTENCY !! Hey, it happens. But you're not disqualified if you get up and CONTINUE‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è It's crossing the finish line that counts. Disruptions & Interruptions happen. Listening isn't just the art of perfecting how to keep your mouth immobile when someone else is pronouncing their ideas, or spilling their guts. Passion is following your heart, listening to your heart. Listening is receiving & embracing the heart - whether it's your own or another's. If at the conclusion of a discussion, you have managed to listen with your heart & understand what has come from someone else's heart - then THAT'S Emotional Intelligence !! While it often requires some disciplinary discourse to hold our responses while others speak, it is far more challenging to bear witness to our own soul, to lay bare our soul in an innocent & childlike fervor -- to enjoy the self-exhibition/self-revelational experience of welcoming others' feelings. Real listening involves trusting, intuiting and understanding -- forming the basis for authentic human brain development. True open-minded-ness requires genuine open-hearted-ness - - and/or the opportunity to set our own beliefs free from the restricted demands of culture, social protocols and early childhood traumas, which heavily influence our adult behaviors and habits. The primary function of our intuitions: To help us learn outside & beyond our beliefs, and acquired experiences. Intuition is Diversified information processing -- not restricted information processing. Intuition isn't dependent on a consciousness factor, nor is it confining precognition to our guts, or merely being alerted to danger. Simple words are encouraged as devices to make ourselves more understandable to others, or our hopes that we'll better understand each other. Sophisticated Complex emotioning (what we are capable of, as opposed to complicated emotional trauma) is what makes it possible for us to understand ourselves - to receive & welcome ourselves, so that we may understand how to be reciprocal receptors of emotional telepathic communication (empathic) with others. When we misunderstand our own feelings, or others' heartfelt words, no amount of AI technology will make it possible for us to become magically telepathic, because that is only possible via emotioning -- As opposed to just sending out \"texted\" words on the organic invisible platform of the universe's natural wireless system. \"B2B\" (brain-to-brain) telepathy in humans is only a fully-vetted possibility based on our emotional intelligence platform. \"Can you feel my thoughts\" is the new \"Can you read my mind\". Wishing you all (in advance) a Happy New Year filled with nurturing the authentic anatomy of Intuition.\n\nHappy Monday everyone! I must say my #SocialSaturday engagement was a rousing success and I am so happy to see so many new faces amongst my followers as well as all those genuine connections I am making through active engagement. Today I'm going to weave my expertise in #Communication into my own #MentalHealthJourney and how it has transformed my own self-perspective in spite of a traumatic childhood and only recently admitting I have never truly loved myself. There might be some #neuroscience I learned about as well. Everything I am talking about is backed by several scientific studies, but I encourage you to look up the academic articles yourself on google scholar as an exercise in information literacy and critical thinking. Citing everything would make me run out of posting space! In case you weren't aware, reading a sentence, writing down a sentence, speaking it out loud, or thinking it all activate different pathways in our brains. If you think, you read, you write, and then you speak out loud, new pathways are opened, our brains get curious, and by repeating this process over and over again eventually your brain will adopt your new way of thinking. The main issue is our brains are inherently lazy and want to make quick decisions, so it will also intrusively tell us not to waste time on things like this. It's the main reason why the most effective way to memorize new knowledge is to read it, absorb it, write it down, repeat it out loud and then in your head while you read it again. This, of course, varies from person to person, but I promise you it is effective. It's how I am learning to love myself. Every day I spend a few minutes in my journal writing at least these 4 sentences and then speaking them out loud to create new neural pathways as quickly as possible. \"I love myself!\" \"My goal is to spread knowledge, understanding, kindness, and caring judgement free!\" \"I am worthy, I am enough, I am a survivor, and I must experience and process all my emotions in a healthy manner.\" \"No one owes me anything no matter what, and I do not owe anything to anyone else.\" I literally just said these out loud to myself and my cats this morning while I'm writing this! These are the phrases and sentences that work for me personally, so please keep that in mind. If you think they will help you, then please use them. We all need to be kinder to ourselves. You cannot be kind to another human if you are unkind to yourself. As always, thank you for sharing space with me. Please comment and react, I really do love interacting with others on here. Repost without your thoughts if you want your connections to join the conversation or repost with your own thoughts if you want to share your perspective with others. #MentalHealth #MentalHealthAwareness #CPTSD #PhD #ExpertInCommunication #ExpertInMarketing #ExpertinPR #DearPhDs #Therapy #TherapyWorks #Neuroscience #BrainHack #InformationLiteracy #CriticalThinking #Networking\n\nüî•5 Reasons why you procrastinate & how to break the vicious cycle! üî• - You‚Äôre a smart woman with dreams to chase and goals to crash! Yet you catch yourself procrastinate. Let‚Äôs unpack ‚Äúwhy‚Äù ‚¨áÔ∏è 1Ô∏è‚É£Behind everything that you do or not do, there is a belief about yourself that holds you back! ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too old to change jobs‚Äù ‚ÄúThe more I work with myself, the most difficult it is to meet someone‚Äù etc. ‚û°Ô∏èAnd without knowing you sabotage yourself limiting your next step. ‚û°Ô∏è I want to invite you, for start to be aware of your self-talk. 2Ô∏è‚É£Procrastination is also synonym of fear. Fear of failure or success, of what will people say or how your parents will react, of not being good enough, of change‚Ä¶ you name it! ‚û°Ô∏èAnd what is your response to fear? You freeze, fly or fight. In other words, avoid, get stuck or passive and do not take action. 3Ô∏è‚É£‚ÄùI‚Äôm just perfectionist!‚Äù Love this one. When we work together, we will talk to this part of you, with curiosity and love, and allow her to express herself, using proven NLP tools integrated in my method. It is just a part of you, not you! 4Ô∏è‚É£Another reason your procrastinate could be lack of clarity and vision. In other words you do not know what you want and why. Thus no motivation to start. 5Ô∏è‚É£Or going a step deeper: lack of mission and unclear identity. Who am I? What is my set of values and what do I prioritise in life? When you have this clear, you‚Äôre not doubting about what is important for you. And I can help you deep dive in your values and explore in a safe environment what is your mission üî•Drop a fire in the comments if you recognize one of those 5 reasons behind the last time you had planned to do something, but eventually you postponed. - Kind reminder: self awareness is happening step by step with curiosity and love. We all choose to procrastinate because we do not have enough evidence to take action! Help yourself to find the evidence. Do not punish her. We‚Äôve got this! #stopprocrastinating #takecontrolofyourlife #womensempowerment #womensempowermentcoach #nlpcoaching #perfectionist #claireloulicoaching #productivitytips"
