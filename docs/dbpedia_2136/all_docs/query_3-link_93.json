It can be translated to mean ‘loved by people,’ ‘grace,’ ‘favor,’ ‘noble,’ or ‘kind.’ There are many hypotheses regarding the origins of the name Lida. For example, Lida is believed to be a short form for several names, including Alida, which in turn is derived from Adelaide. The name can be translated to ‘nobleness’ or ‘nobility.’\n\nLida is believed to be the French derivation of the Germanic name Adalheidis, which is a combination name of two words Adal, meaning ‘noble’ and the suffix Heit, meaning ‘kind,’ ‘sort,’ or ‘type.’ Another interpretation of the name’s origins is that it is a short form of the name Dalida, which, in turn, is derived from the Hebrew name Delilah. This name can be translated to mean ‘delicate’ or ‘weak.’\n\nThe name Lida can also be used as the short form of another name Lidia, which is derived from the Ancient Greek Lydia. It is a topographic name that is given to someone from a coastal region in Asia Minor. This name was believed to have been given to the place after the legendary king named Lydos. Yet another hypothesis concerning the name’s origins is that it is derived from the Lithuanian name Lyda. It is also known to have originated from Lydimas, which can be translated to mean ‘slash and burn agriculture.’\n\nLida can be pronounced as ‘LEE-dah’ or ‘LYE-dah.’ While its variations include Leida, Lidah, and Lyda. It also has pet names, such as Lidia and Liddy. Though there are a few references to Lida in the fictional world, it can be a unique choice in the 21st century.\n\nHow To Pronounce Lida?\n\n‘Lida’ In QR Code\n\nLida On The Popularity Chart\n\nAccording to the US Social Security Administration chart, the popularity of the name Lida was high in the 1980s.
